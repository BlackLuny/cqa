6wZbsPn2aa	Ah, the JD and Kim saga. Hahaha.<br>  <br>  Well, they began to date at the very end of the 5th season, and her telling JD that she was pregnant after their very first date was the final few seconds of the season 5 finale.<br>  <br>  During the 6th season, JD and Kim decide to keep the child after much debate. They stay together for a while and then Kim is offered a job in Tacoma, Washington. She takes it, and leaves JD behind, BUT they are still a couple.<br>  <br>  In the middle of the 6th season, JD goes to Tacoma to surprise Kim when she gets her first ultrasound. He doesn't want to miss it. He shows up at her new hospital and she tells him she had a miscarriage. The two of them talk all night and decide to just stay friends.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm pretty sure this is exactly what you're asking for, but just in case, I gave you additional info. Anyway, Turk and JD go to Phoenix and Kim happens to be there giving lectures. Turns out, she is still pregnant and she lied to JD because "her hormones went crazy". And, during this time, which is near the end of the 6th season, JD is extremely angry at her. I would be too...|`|hrTOu2z1aa	If you are in season 6, JD is mad at Kim because she told him that she miscarried their child but lied.  He sees her at a medical conference and finds out the truth.|`|mansEgYQaa	Kim is mad at JD because. Well i think you are in the episode where  she is having the baby right ( cause that is the only one i can think of where she is angry at him) and what happened is he said he did not love and only hoped for it and said well kind of said if it were not for the baby he would be out of it. And she got mad because of that, and plus he forgot to give her, her pain killer before she went into birth.

d2uGruHiaa	I don't know, but I'm a Capricorn. And I've been having mixed emotions lately to the point where I don't know who to believe and what to believe and who to believe in. I'm tired of getting hurt by those I truly care about and get nothing in return for everything I've done- not even a simple, "thank you". =X|`|CEEQDSCFaa	im feeling pretty good actually, i think my chart is making beneficial aspects to capricorn now, and like fiery earth im more determined like nothings impossible, and have a stronger urge to get ahead<br>  <br>  theres also a big change coming next week, im moving thousands of miles south, im gonna live there now, and will look for a new job, could be for the better, although i have to leave my friends behind, damn this is gonna be emotional lol|`|gjNB9HtUaa	im a moon cap and moon caps are not usually that emotional.<br>  i guess it affects me as not being too emotional, just being well-grounded.<br>  <br>  (:|`|SdpWsTlQaa	Be careful. Capricorns are very fragile right now! Don't take things the wrong way and don't over anlyze yourself and loved ones. Try to relax and do things to better yourself.|`|242f11da22f6e80dc6556c8c44c86acbaa	Hi Eden:)<br>  <br>  Lunar transits are typically fairly minor influences (since the moon moves so quickly it doesn't have the staying power to really be a major influence while transiting) which work on people's emotions. The effect of the transit will have much to do with the aspects which are being made by transiting Moon to natal placements, and also to the house which is being transited. Cappy Sun people could find themselves wearing their emotions on their sleeves, Cap Moon may find themselves overloaded with emotional stimuli....something along those lines.|`|6UaTAmkMaa	idk?|`|MWe4hMm1aa	i'm a sun cap and i hate when the moon is in this position. i might not even know it then i check and of course the moon is in cap. i feel my best when the moon is in gemini or leo. gives me a bit of a lift. <br>  <br>  i wish caps weren't so prone to depression :(|`|lpyWVR2oaa	Actually makes me feel more grounded and wanting to get started on new projects. Its a Cardinal Sign afterall. When the transit Capricorn Moon conjuncts the Capricorn Sun, there's bound to be some urgency to get back on the 'right' track, be it out of a phase of manic depression, getting a new project started or whatever..<br>  <br>  ~Capricorn Sun & thankfully not Capricorn Moon~
rRCTvT7Saa	Rock basically started with the blues.  The blues would essentially create all the genres that are most popular today:  rock, jazz, country and, even though I don't consider it real music at all, rap (since rappers rip off drum beats from artists like Zeppelin.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the first true rock and roll artist was Chuck Berry.  Look up his song "Johnny B. Goode"--it's a classic!<br>  <br>  Oh, and rock--like blues--was started in America.  The main difference is that blues was first started by actual slaves in America.  When rock came about, there was no more slavery, thanks to Abraham Lincoln!|`|Zxl8oyIraa	Well u may not know it but this is a bit of an opinion question really, because wat would u consider the birth of rock? Robert Johnson making the guitar part of the music scene, Elvis bringing rebellion to the table, the mass production of the fender in 1948. If ur looking for songs, the originals will hardly be wat some ppl call rock now. Elvis had 'Jail House Rock' and Johnson had 'Love In Vain'. try those. It started with blues in the south.|`|vgcY5jHuaa	Late 1950s - Early 1960s<br>  Rebellion from society at the time<br>  Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley and Bo Diddley<br>  One famous example was Hound Dog by Elvis Presley

That kind of thing. Sometimes questions don't get seen on the front page of the category, so no one sees it.<br>  <br>  However, if they just say something like yes, no, that sucks, something dumb and doesn't answer the question, then yes it does annoy me that they would put a link to their own question.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Yes, my sister used to that, until one day a friend of my asked a me question and sister answered and told her "she asked, I'm suppose to answered."|`|KPLDOfxxaa	I just don't like it when the question is in another section and I click on it...Then I have to change back to P&S, and I'm lazy so I won't like that.|`|YxGyd2yZaa	Nope!

2k8TEiRtaa	That is a very Good country song Jon. I was even thinking a melody for it as I read it. very good.<br>  <br>  Join a songwriters association. Give it a melody and send it in. The critics there are different. I know they will like the lyrics. They may tell you to add a bridge to build up to the chorus. But this song is not difficult to find a melody for it. The words are crafted to fit a semi fast beat. Which is popular nowadays. I wrote songs for a long time and still do every once in a while. It can get habitual. If you send lyrics only to a critic, they will tell you that a song is not complete until it has a melody and is put together completely. Save your drafts since you had the idea. It is now your song. In case somebody wants to steal the lyrics, they can't because you have the drafts to prove it's yours. To copyright songs is not difficult at all. You can copyright songs , several at a time using only one form and a small fee to the federal copyright office.|`|Q7jLqFZmaa	It's hard to say, but the lyrics are very good. If you can sing this, post it on youtube, then we can see if it's really good. But as far as the lyrics go, it's excellent!!!! :-)|`|TnXTCznvaa	it's pretty good.
r9lfDeRmaa	Why weight the machine down even more, the arms are so big I would think that the pilot would not be completely exposed but only partially.<br>  Considering they are deep within the earths core there can't be that much light even if they do have power. I think throwing extra shadows into the works would create for a disadvantage, especially since the machines swim through air like squids swim through water.<br>  <br>  There is no point in glass, or enclosed cockpit considering they don't need to be protected from the elements.<br>  <br>  I admit the design probably isn't the best they could have come up with, but what do you expect from people living thousands of miles below the surface for thousands of years fighting self-aware machines.They probably didn't want to make those Mechs too advanced, so they went simple.

AA10974198	This song tells the story of a man who shoots a sheriff who is harassing him, but is wrongly accused of killing the deputy. Marley said that some of the song is true, but would not say what parts.|`|AA10690200	you'll never understand it even if we write a dissertation on this matter... ya gotta smoke a little ganja to know the meanin.. ya man!|`|64oOqELCaa	happiness idk???|`|ShHiuBd4aa	Someone told me that someone was accused of killling a sheriff and a deputy. He admitted to killing the sheriff, but not the deputy. <br>  i dont know who it was though.|`|jJjfeylmaa	the only other way that i've heard that used besides its literal meaning is blowing a load, and i don't think that's what marley was sayin. straight up he's just saying he shot the sheriff, but not the deputy.|`|kELDXjkgaa	I think it is just meant to be ironic|`|V2SHuCM6aa	well this relates to when he was accused of shooting the deputy. he decided to be his own lawyer and he pleaded guilty for a crime as an alliby to another crime. saying he couldnt have shot the deputy because he was busy shooting the sherrif at that time and dat. <br>  <br>  \LOL im sorry i just had to say it its so funny i have no idea|`|3SsYoxKCaa	its like how you are blamed for something, but u are actually innocent of that crime. however, you did do SOMETHING wrong.
AA11313798	I think the girl who plays Chun Li is actually part Asian.<br>  <br>  But anyway, I agree with you about Dragon Ball. I thought it was pretty dumb. How can you let a white guy play an asian guy role? Nobody lets an Asian dude be Batman.<br>  <br>  I thought that was pretty wack. But it seems like they usually add non-Asian to make an Asian film successful...unless it's mean to be Asian and dubbed English... like the crouching tiger movie.|`|ytR8i8S6aa	i cant help u on the casting of the charaters. but fyi, its not dragon ball z. its based on the original dragon ball, back when goku was 15. u should know that if ur a real db fan
t2M1kXY4aa	I love it, too.<br>  <br>  I like that it portrays crime-solving from an unusual angle.  It's not just a "cop" drama.  It shows how homicides and other suspicious deaths can be explained and solved by using the victim's body itself as evidence in the crime.<br>  <br>  The CSI shows also do that, but have a much colder, more "clinical" feel.  The emphasis is on the evidence and the lab on those series'.  With "Bones", the interpersonal dynamics between the characters is an important part of the story, and I find it to be an easier show to watch and enjoy than those others which focus more on fingerprints, body fluids, and DNA.|`|FZ1jvTQaaa	I love it... <br>  I want a Seely Boothe.|`|AA11406674	Best Show on Television.

You need to get a hold of yourself. ~I LOVE DEREK|`|kyTBaYFlaa	you should be more honest at the beginning. you are trying too hard.  you are probably very accommodating and eager to please at first. men like that.  it seems to them that you have everything in common and you agree with everything they say and like to do whatever they want to do and laugh at all of their jokes and everything is great. then later you will try to assert yourself and the men are probably like wow where did that come from right out of left field. all of a sudden they realize that you don't really think the way they do or like the things they like and they want to bail or at least slow down.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	I hate to reference Bill Clinton, but what did he say about repeating the same thing and expecting a different result?<br>  I think you may be mistaking the endorphin rush of a new relationship for love. If it is going to last more than a month you need to be best friends. Ask yourself, would this still be fun without the sex part? Slow down, that, at least, will make it last longer.|`|56XwyVW9aa	You love the butterfly stage.

All the men are falling!!!!!|`|lIc2OKY2aa	Sounds like your unstaible, you don't need a man in your life all the time. Take a break, have a little fun. Don't come off too strong, men will think that your too clingy and taking things way too fast. Don't be to worried about losing a guy because you guys aren't thinking about marriage. If it doesnt work out, it wasnt ment to be, just move on in life.|`|CYVGvfeOaa	i guess you're just a loveable person that when someone first meets you, they can't get enough, you know? you're kinda like-unhuman to them. like perfect.<br>  <br>  but then they come to realize you are a human and you do make mistakes or whatever and though that should make a person much more likeable, it turns some people away.|`|ekpg6v1Kaa	I find this very unusual? but my opinion does not count its how you are feeling at the time and how you deal with it.  For some unknown reasons this is happening then i suggest you seek therapy if you need it they should have the answer.|`|HgNd8LUzaa	I think you should hang out with your girls. Go shopping, talk, have fun.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	In your dreams. And why would this be a bad thing?|`|9A4yzQBWaa	its all in your head they don't love you|`|ciT6oNLLaa	then you dont make men fall in love with u. u fall in love with them <br>  <br>  take a break do something like sports for a while<br>  <br>  hang with your girls<br>  <br>  get your mind off guys<br>  <br>  and its usually beacouse u have something in your life you havnt had so ur using your love for guys to fill the wound in ur hole. heyits normal ive dun it too.... exept wiht girls . but it gets tireing after a while. just fix that wound. and mentally get help and hope and pray for the best.

t2M1kXY4aa	It wasn't made clear why he was having dialysis ... apparently, that will be revealed in the next episode.<br>  <br>  It seems like ER has been sort of tying up all its loose ends, which makes sense, since this is the last season.  The one thing I've not been able to understand is what purpose the character of Dr. Banfield is.  <br>  <br>  The scenes for upcoming episodes that were shown after tonight's episode indicate that she will be the key to Carter's crisis.  I am just now starting to understand what her role in the cast is ... obviously, it was part of a "grand plan" to finish the series with a bang.|`|58BL2wkjaa	I thought it was a dialysis machine he was hooked up to.  So maybe he caught a bug that attacks the kidneys or liver in Africa?|`|mB7wW7r3aa	When I saw him in the ward, my first thought was he had AIDS, would fit him working in a third world country.

I guess we will find out on Thursday at 10PM EST. :)|`|X1uOh8ylaa	As soon as I saw that scene I knew it was him. He must be suffering from a kidney ailment, he was getting dialysis.

QZzQdh43aa	You can easily fall in love with Taureans born between 20 April and 29 April — they are romantic at heart and tend to stimulate your own passion and need for love. <br>  <br>  Any Taurus born between 30 April and 10 May will also be reasonably compatible. The problem with this group is that they will be overly concerned with financial security and could demand an unfair share of input from you. Sort out money plans with them very carefully. <br>  <br>  Taureans born between 11 May and 21 May are far too grounded for your liking and could be a challenge for you.

ADBMrG87aa	They wanted to this character to differ greatly from that of Emily's.  Emily was classy, elegant, soft and overly sweet so this new character Rebecca is the total opposite.  They've done this before, look back at Luis/Lorenzo Alcazar.|`|6BTvuPwcaa	I think they have her being this personality because Emily was so sweet and nice.  I bet they are building it up and it ends up (since Emily was adopted) that they were twins or something.  They say twins (usually) have opposite personalities.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I think that they're trying to distinguish her as much as possible from Emily to start with (rude, shorter hair, lots of make-up, etc.) but in time they'll probably tone her down.|`|xYTagSIyaa	I agree with Crystal, I think some people get tired of playing certain goody two shoe style characters as they are so one dimensional.  People on soaps can play one character for their whole life.  Emily was sickeningly sweet, even I was getting tired of her.  <br>  She may have told the writers she could not take it anymore and needed a change and this is how they have chosen to do it.  <br>  Rebbecca will be everything Emily was not, that is why they have gone to all this trouble and I am sure she will never be sweet again.  <br>  I think it will make for good watching though.
lpyWVR2oaa	Are you familiar with reading your own natal chart and so on? If there are a number of First House planets found in Taurus, then this is likely to make you feel more Taurean than Virgoan. Alternatively, if the chart ruler Venus is found to be a dominant planet in your chart, then this may make you feel more Taurean as well.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, because these two signs are pretty similar in the sense that they are both Earth signs, it can be rather hard to tell them apart. One big difference is the rigidity and stubbornness found in the Taurus personality. So if you feel yourself bearing grudges, not being able to let go of past hurts/people/things easily and being very obstinate at the same time, then you're likely to be influenced by some very prominent Taurus energies.<br>  <br>  The horoscopes you mention are basically too generalized and commercialized in my opinion and are thus, not worth following rigidly. But when you choose to, follow your Sun sign because they're written meant for the Sun and not Rising.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	It's possible, I think. <br>  <br>  Sometimes I think I act more like my rising sun, Aquarius, but I also act like my sun sign.|`|2CYfjPA6aa	I know what you are talking about, I am a Pisces with Scorpio rising, I feel way more like a Scorpio than a Pisces most of the time.<br>  <br>  The rising sign is your "mask" or how others perceive you... how you look to others, your appearance etc. The sun sign is your "core" or soul.

Grant M|`|2lByIoqGaa	Yes, but the only reason they taste funny is cuz of all the makeup and cheep clothes.... not cuz clowns ARE funny, cuz they aren't o_O|`|GO0FqfOIaa	hahahaha. lol<br>  <br>  you are funny. :]|`|XNJK09ZDaa	lol yeah they also eat their relatives when they die [x|`|6y5wgdmHaa	Really?|`|5NsgLFPRaa	Sounds like that could be true|`|MYGBQgd4aa	they dont eat kind people either...they taste too sweet|`|UBdiyHu5aa	Or lawyers... cause they're poisonous.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	Cannibals don't discriminate. They eat whoever they can get their hands on. <br>  <br>  Also, most 'clowns' aren't tasting funny these days.|`|TEsS7jq7aa	How would they taste different from any other person? Do cannibals eat the clothes too?|`|iLsjaMIyaa	hahaha .. idk. i'm not a cannibal =)|`|9ilXVowLaa	hahaha|`|9GDBpl8Faa	haha. Probably. Who would eat clowns anyway?

GO0FqfOIaa	People say i am shallow, but yer. I can't help it. I try not to be.

But that doesn't change the fact that you *are* shallow.|`|Kr9CowEXaa	Just don't be so public or obnoxious about it and people should calm down about it. That's what I do|`|GB858dS0aa	it is okay to be shallow. at least you are honest.|`|zopegiT4aa	no, but it doesn't mean you're not shallow|`|ozCn1feYaa	i don't see how that's shallow..like you said.<br>  everyone has preferences!|`|Y3k3x3eRaa	It is true that you cannot help what or who you like, but how you state these opinions is when you will run into trouble.<br>  <br>  If you do not accept peoples difference and are quick to point out what you think of as faults it is likely that people will become angry with you.<br>  <br>  You must understand that not everyone holds your same preferences, so you should not look down on people for their differences or difference in preferences.|`|88KRRWPzaa	u got to live ur own life|`|IRMmQ1FHaa	Being a prick is being a prick.

rRCTvT7Saa	Rock got popular because it was something new--something fresh.  Plus, kids' parents hated that stuff (I'm guessing) so kids would listen to it to be rebelious.  Of course, rock and roll didn't get extremely popular until a little band called the Beatles came out.|`|89xzNpVaaa	Became popular, and those who became popular, were rock artists and that spread to people, for ex. The Beatles.|`|oiqNhzz1aa	The style of music they played in the time that they were popular was very different than what was before them.  The new sound with the instruments and lyrically catapulted them into the living rooms of the younger generation of the time into listening to something that the parents would consider vulgar.  As time has progressed to present time, the lyrics, dancing, and musicianship has progressed to what you hear on the radios and buy in the stores now.|`|APNLYQgoaa	People thought Elvis was good looking.

6DGLxJ1daa	Overall, I'd say work on bells or 'pitched note' instruments. But make sure to keep up your technique for all other instruments.  Percussionists need to be versatile in their skills.  Many percussionists have good technique on snare and bass and auxiliary instruments but cannot play bells/marimba/xylophone, so the whole band's sound is limited when nobody in the back can play the important bell parts.  <br>  <br>  Specialize in whatever makes you happy, whatever you enjoy the most, but make sure to keep up technique in everything else and always learn as much as you can so you can participate and perform your best all the time!  That's the most fun of all.|`|tnu4mYKAaa	Bells|`|et9gdoDKaa	I was in percussion in middle school! lol<br>  My favorites were bells and marimba<br>  ^If you can play piano, it's a piece of cake.

I had to watch a few times as well just to get the idea. It was kind of like "The Matrix," you had to watch it a few times to understand.|`|56bNLJykaa	It was alright.. I liked it very much at first, when I got into more high quality foreign films a bit less, but still "good"|`|AwBVoWOaaa	I loved it.<br>  I think is bizarre, quirky, funny, sad and awesome. To me this is Jake Gyllenhaal's best film.<br>  <br>  I love the soundtrack, the direction, the script, the special effects, the colors. Fantastic gem.<br>  <br>  I think the moral is that some things are bound to happen for the greater good and that we're all destined to do something whether we like it or not. Maybe to maintain a balance, a structure.|`|vc67fw68aa	It was good ... I didnt get the chinese girls character ... I know there is symbolizm but I cant figure it out!! <br>  <br>  any help!?

ME4XWNmRaa	Yes, they influenced millions of  people and their music will live on.Each one was larger than life when they were alive. They were all taken from us way too early and they are and will always be missed.|`|eOLAnGiSaa	Yes, each and every one of them. <br>  "Imagine", "Purple Haze", "Light My Fire", and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" are all great hits.|`|89xzNpVaaa	Yeah all of them will be but i think Kurt Cobain needs more time to be as legend in generally all rock music., but he is a legend in Grunge Music. ( Happy Birthday to him) R.I.P.|`|kHv0CuaMaa	John Lennon, Jimmi, and Jim will. Cobain has false fame.

4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I would like to see old but classic jokes with Conan as he moves. He's a funny guy and his material works with him|`|fQgbBx7caa	He is a joke.|`|Jz7KDYoEaa	They just recently started using the masturbating bear again after years of him being absent. They long gave up on their funnier characters like Pimp Bot 3000. I prefer Greg Ferguson now. I do hope they keep If They Mated on Conan though and that weird channels gag and the weird Max Weinberg/Conan chemistry and the Max just being a perv stuff. Classic material.
5c079cb1c9fa7ffe7d3cdc8fa57061a6aa	she was horrible in the first one<br>  <br>  the whole tom cruise thing just made her image weird i guess<br>  <br>  she's not really good<br>  <br>  the new one wasn't good either<br>  i blame the script/ dialogue<br>  <br>  maybe kate beckinsale could have done a better job|`|9ilXVowLaa	b/c she's too brainwashed to make any decisions|`|iQ13PoEiaa	because tom cruise probably tied her up and threw her in a closet, keeping her from doing anything. because he's insane. <br>  <br>  and retarded. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and dumb. in general.|`|rgwFBtkwaa	She wasn't very good in the other one. Also they often change the leading ladies (think James Bond) to keep the men interested!|`|uGtKfdR2aa	because she's busy and do not have so much time for work...<br>  busy on her family, she'll get to act on movie at the end of 2009
8yE2sYGeaa	Probably not, just owing to the amount of problems in getting the production going|`|8NTXSKRiaa	I dont think it will be as big as Twilight. Firstly because they canned Catherine Hardwicke which made the movie what it was Awesome. Secondly, Edward cullen does not have much of a role becuase he leaves Bella. And Kristen Stewart reprises her role as Bella Swan. I have nothing against her really but she is so stiff and her acting was not believable with the twiching which makes it hard to believe that she is getting into her character... But hopefully it will be sucessful and it might be since Taylor Lautner AKA Jacob Black is back who might become a better of a hearthrob than Edward cullen..|`|sq4qM8mOaa	Well in my opinion the twilight movie wasnt as good as the book so i think because of that some of the hype for the New Moon movie will be lost...|`|uE9S4ooAaa	I'm really not sure, there is a new director, so we'll have to see. But I wouldn't exactly call Twilight a success...
AA10954273	This volume is looking up.<br>  <br>  I liked the scene where Sylar admitted that he's a serial killer, technically.  And Bennet getting drugged was good.  The Hiro and Ando story was a complete waste of time, though.
iAuvoQeHaa	It's hard to recognise her and her features are distorted because of swelling people! She looks like she's had multiple blows all over her face.<br>  <br>  Those are her tattoos. It's being treated as legit by other media. TMZ haven't said who their source is. But I doubt that they'd put it there if it wasn't genuine, they could get into very serious trouble otherwise. They were quick in declaring the early fake pictures. Her features are all swollen because of the beating. The photo matches witness statements and original statements made when it happened. It's just awful.<br>  <br>  It's sad that she's probably hidden this abuse for quite awhile, maybe hoping against hope for an improvement, because their careers and images are involved. She must have been quite afraid for herself to throw the keys out the car. In the photo she just looks defeated and resigned.|`|Z6RfbYq5aa	To be honest I don't think so, because there are photoshopped images going around of rihanna. How did TMZ get these pictures when the police did not even release the pictures at first?...(that's what I'm wondering)....and if it was a picture taken for evidence, it would definately not have that type of background....It's too many red flags for me.|`|Xpx61b1yaa	I think it is, because that would be Rihanna after her face swelling a lot. and I heard that someone, her mom or a friend took pictures. Then that friend or her mom could have sent them in to TMZ. TMZ couldn't lie about something like that. They would get suid too much money|`|dlaS6e7zaa	Something seems fishy about the whole entire situation. I'm currently ignoring the media because they tell false things sometimes and also it just doesn't seem right.. In the end only Rihanna and Chris know what truly happened.|`|776e689c6bcb3bd7689f1c9c6994e898aa	I been reading this LIFE magazine today and this picture came up<br>  saying how rihanna is actually suing whoever that put up that photoshopped picture of her.<br>  So its fake!!|`|1scwV5bJaa	maybe, mostly TMZ provides the real photos and videos|`|y6Myl0Imaa	lmao thank u for posting this link thats deff her daaaaaaaaaaaaamn|`|uDl5lUtdaa	Looks photoshopped to me.|`|AA10974198	Looks like it. The tattoo there is a dead giveaway <br>  <br>  :(<br>  <br>  Poor girl|`|HqfF4bFNaa	dam that's crazy if that's her, chris should get his *** beat|`|eMccVmBkaa	i dont think it is her cuz what sorta person would want to take a picture of them with a battered up face????|`|SKscCpZJaa	i dont think so|`|flspL64taa	it kinda looks like her, does she have that tattoo on her shoulder?|`|ICOmnGIUaa	i would say no. It looks like a little too much|`|nMMx77wQaa	i dunno.....And does she even have that tattoo on her shoulder? But  if it is her thats jacked up|`|HsiDiRB5aa	hahah no <br>  i highly doubt it|`|W3ATWJRNaa	Nooooooo. that could not possibly be her. Her lips are completely different and everything. That CANNOT be her. and if it is i understand why they would be sending him to jail, he is dangerous to do that. But again i STRONGLY believe that that is NOT her!!<br>  (Maybe, but ya know)|`|ixyNeBhWaa	I don't know.  But I do know that a good story sells.  So be sure that this might blow all out of proportion, like the Caylee story.  There are more children out there being murdered but for some reason her story is always the main proposal.|`|OIhN9B9xaa	It looks like some one knows how to use photoshop really well. Trust me, if you know how to use photoshop correctly, you can definitely pull this off.|`|U0bgBYiVaa	It's not true because rhiana <br>  decided not to open a law suit.<br>  And under the photo <br>  it says chris said sorrry <br>  and weakness in its<br>  case.|`|iQ13PoEiaa	yeah. they said that it looked like she had horns on her forehead after it happened, and that picture certainly looks like she has some horns.|`|O1NOuJ5Caa	Well...it is TMZ haha.<br>  <br>  Regardless...it kind of looks like her, but I'm just not quite sure it is her.|`|iO08zbtDaa	Nope<br>  Photoshopped fo sho!!|`|AA12035186	TMZ isn't the most reliable source, so probably not.|`|AA11878029	I have been beaten by a man ..so yes if that's what she put out but i believe it was probably much worse !!|`|AA10531094	Yes, why wouldn't you think it's her, because she's not pretty in that picture?  If you were beat up. . . you wouldn't look pretty either.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	it's not nice to spread rumors|`|PXfUyd5aaa	I kinda think so...TMZ is quite over-the-top, but their sources are still reliable and they're right most of the time.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	no way|`|drzN1kkuaa	Oh my, haha I doubt it, but Im on the fence about it too.<br>  <br>  I dont think Chris did that much damage to her<br>  <br>  And plus on her shoulder theres a tattoo, which Rihanna doesnt have!|`|x81bKkFqaa	Most likely it is her, she has the same tattoo and tmz would get in trouble for posting false pictures of her.|`|yHYWdQAbaa	wow... just...wow o.o|`|cI0dF22yaa	That's going overboard.<br>  NO NO NO!<br>  hahaha :))|`|6doMlTGoaa	Hell no~|`|9z0dzBjAaa	i think they want attention|`|decWPAHkaa	No! I don't believe half the stories that are presented in the media.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	she wanted black dick, that stuff is crucial
OffM2Ndiaa	dude yes. no question. steven tyler is a beast!!!!!!!!|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Not my taste but, they are a decent band.Steven Tyler is a class A vocalist to say the least. Aerosmith is a talented band.|`|2KI7LxUXaa	Theres a HOOLE in my SOUULL <br>  hmm<br>  <br>  yes aerosmith is great ...if you dont have kids singing the songs in ur ear during PE...|`|WHcBV7rLaa	Nope!<br>  Not my taste. Too screechy|`|v588UNt6aa	Yeah, one of the greatest rock bands ever.|`|ME4XWNmRaa	I love Aerosmith, i love the albums Rocks, Toys In The Attic, and Get Your Wings the best. Their music was incredible back then and though it sounds more commercial now, it is still highly enjoyable music. They were more raunchier when they were younger, and the music now reflects their age nowadays.|`|eOLAnGiSaa	Yeah, Aerosmith is great. They had a string of really, really, really great albums in the '70s, with Aeromsith, Rocks, and Toys in the Attic. Of course, they have tons of unkillable hits like "Dream On", "Walk This Way", and "Sweet Emotion".
Osze34UFaa	"Leave Out All The Rest" is one of their best songs.  It is not your typical love song, but it is especially sweet when you really listen to it.  "Shadow Of The Day" is an apparent love song.  "Faint," "Crawling," and pretty much all of their songs could also be considered love songs.  Again, you have to pay close attention when you hear them in order to get this perspective.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Peace & Love!|`|B0UEI0Nraa	My December,With You, or Shadow of The Day.<br>  Linkin Park isnt really a romance type of band, but those would beh my idea of romance songs by them =]|`|Y1W0K1wuaa	I love Breaking the Habit... but other then that they mainly sing about fighting and breaking up..|`|VAjGaQJqaa	in the end

Vowing never to kill, he tries to escape his past as the Hitokiri Battousai, the greatest killer of the Bakumatsu. However, an old menace, in the form of Shishio Makoto, the successor to the Hitokiri Battousai, threatens the peace of the new Meiji Era. Shishio and his Juppon Gatana are ready to start a new revolution to correct the evils of Western influence.<br>  <br>  Black Cat (Action)<br>  Train Heartnet and his partner Sven are sweepers (bounty hunters) who capture wanted criminals. Train once belonged to a secret organization (named Chronos) but later withdrew. Now he hunts down an enemy who wishes to destroy those who cannot use the power of Tao or who he sees fit to live.<br>  <br>  Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles (Action/Romance)<br>  It's about a group of four people that come from different dimentions; there names are Syaoran, Sakura, Fay, and Kurogane. They have to travel to different dimensions in search of Sakura's memories (also known as here feathers) that scattered around the galaxy or she will die. Syaoran is her childhood friend, Fay is a powerful magician who doesn't want to return to his world, and Kurogane is a powerful warrior who wishes to return to his world. Together they travel through various dimensions with the help of white mokona (they had gotten mokona from the Witch of Dimentions) to find a solution to their different goals.. <br>  <br>  D.N Angel (Action/Romance)<br>  This is about a boy (his name is Daisuke) who has a famous thief named Dark who is basically his other side. Whenever Daisuke looks into a picture of a girl named Risa he transforms into Dark. Dark steals art work to seal away evil things inside it. This anime is also about Daisuke being in love with Risa, then finding out he is in love with Risa’s twin sister Riku. <br>  <br>  Ouran High School Host Club (Comedy/Romance)<br>  Haruhi, a scholarship student at exclusive Ouran High School (a school full of rich kids), breaks an $80,000 vase that belongs to the "Host Club", a mysterious school club consisting of six super-rich (and gorgeous) guys. To pay back the damages, she is forced to work for the club, and there she discovers just how wealthy the boys are and how different the people at that school is compared to every one els that she is usually around. <br>  <br>  Fruits Basket (Comedy/Romance)<br>  About a young high school girl named Tohru who begins living under the same roof as the most popular person in the hole school, Yuki Sohma.  Tohru finds out that certain members of the Sohma family have a curse on them, when hugged by members of the opposite sex, they turn into animals from the zodiac. Since Tohru is a girl living with three of the zodiac guys, she sometimes turns them into animals (obviously). There's a lot of things in this that would make you laugh so much you wouldn’t be able to breath.<br>  <br>  Flame of Recca (Action/Romance)<br>  Becoming a ninja is just a childhood dream for sixteen-year-old Recca, until a fateful encounter reveals he has inherited ninja powers, including the ability to wield fire!

One day he was being chased by some bandits on his way to the ruins. He had goten stuck in the ruins so he decided to go and look around in them, thats where he had found an orginoid, that gave him his own zoid, and a zoidian (Feona) that didn't remember anything from her past. So Van decided to help her & left the village with thoes two following him. Thats were their story begins.

The series tells the story of Tohru Honda, an orphan girl who, after meeting Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure Sohma, learns that thirteen members of the Sohma family are possessed by the animals of the Chinese zodiac and cursed to turn into their animal forms if they embrace anyone of the opposite sex or their bodies come under a great deal of stress. As the series progresses, Tohru meets the rest of the zodiac and the family's mysterious head, Akito Sohma, and eventually resolves to break the curse that burdens them.<br>  <br>  The name spellings used in this article are those given in the official Region 1 DVD and English manga releases. Names are given in Western order, with the family name last. Takaya named most of the Sohmas affected by the curse after the month in the former Japanese lunisolar calendar that corresponds to their zodiac animal.[1] The exceptions are Kureno and Momiji, whose names were swapped by mistake;[2] Kyo, who as the cat is not part of the official zodiac; and Yuki.[3] According to the author, no other names have meanings.[4]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fru..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fru...</a><br>  <br>  Special A ::::<br>  <br>  Hikari Hanazono has always been second to Kei Takishima. When they were six years old, their pro-wrestling loving fathers introduced them to each other. Assuming that she was the best in wrestling, young Hikari challenged Kei to a wrestling match only to be thoroughly defeated by him. Ever since that fateful incident, Hikari swore to beat Kei in school grades, sporting events - anything. To do this, she has enrolled in the same school as Kei since elementary. Now she attends Hakusenkan, an ultra elite school, that costs her carpenter father a lot of money. Hikari and Kei are the top two students in the school, with Kei holding firmly to that number one position. While Hikari considers Kei to be a rival and important friend, she is completely unaware that Kei loves her. The story primarily focuses on Hikari and her constant attempts to defeat her one and only rival, Kei, and how she finds love in their rivalry.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_A" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_A</a><br>  <br>  Aishiteruze baby:<br>  Aishiteruze Baby is a shōjo manga series that revolves around the life of Kippei Katakura, a popular high-school playboy who flirts with any girl he sees, without thinking about their feelings. His life is turned upside down when one day his aunt abandons his five-year-old cousin Yuzuyu at his house. Kippei is assigned the task of taking care of Yuzuyu for the time being, and he must learn how to become the "mother" she needs. As Kippei learns how to care for Yuzuyu, he also learns to care for Kokoro, a quiet girl at his school, who helps him out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aishiteruze..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aishiteruze...</a><br>  <br>  chobits:<br>  <br>  The story centers on the life of Hideki Motosuwa, a repeat student attempting to qualify for university by studying at Seki prep school in Tokyo. Besides a girlfriend, he dreams of having a persocom (パソコン?): an android used as a personal computer, which is expensive. On his way home one evening, he stumbles across a persocom in the form of a beautiful girl with long hair lying against a pile of trash bags, and he carries her home. Upon turning her on, she instantly regards Hideki with adoration. The only word the persocom seems capable of saying is "chi" (ちぃ, Chii?), thus he names her Chi. Hideki assumes that there must be something wrong with her, and so the following morning Hideki's neighbor Hiromu Shimbo tries to analyze her with his mobile persocom Plum, and after Plum crashes concludes that she must be custom-made.<br>  <br>  Shinbo introduces Hideki to Minoru Kokubunji, a twelve year old genius who specializes in the field of custom made persocoms. Minoru's persocoms, including Yuzuki, a fairly exceptional custom made persocom, are not able to analyze Chi either, and thus they conclude that she may be one of the Chobits, a legendary series of persocoms rumoured to have free will and emotions. Although this could be a possibility, Minoru is confident that it is only a rumour. Yuzuki also adds that she does not resemble any persocom model in any available database and so she must be custom made after all.<br>  <br>  A major part of the plot involves Hideki attempting to teach Chi words, concepts, and appropriate behaviours, in between his crammed schedule of school and work. At the same time, Chi seems to be developing feelings for Hideki, at an emotional depth, which she is not supposed to possess, and Hideki struggles with his feelings for her. The need to figure out more about Chi and her mysterious functions and past becomes a stressing pull for the characters in the series.<br>  Hideki discovers that his feelings intensify for Chi<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chobits" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chobits</a>|`|yQwtxNsCaa	love hina but it only has comedy and romance if you haven't seen it you got to see it man it hilarious

15Uz3lO2aa	Yes, there are actors unions:<br>  <br>  SAG: Screen Actors Guild<br>  <br>  AFTRA: American Federation of Television and Radio Arts<br>  <br>  AEA: Actors Equity Association<br>  <br>  <br>  Just because actors love their job, doesn't mean it's not work. The entertainment business has the longest hours in one working day than any other profession... and they are paid accordingly.<br>  <br>  A lot of celebrities are famous yet talentless... these people used networking to get them where they are. Just as in any other profession, people can suck at what they do, but they got the job because of who they know.<br>  <br>  Over the years, entertainers have not been getting their proper pay due to downloading/bootlegging music and movies. The record industry is going under because of this.<br>  <br>  It is worth it for them to get paid because people need entertainment in their lives just like they need a doctor or hairstylist. A doctor may love to be a doctor, yet ppl never question if his work is work. A hairstylist may love her job but is never questioned whether it is work or not. Entertainers are wrongfully questioned because the spotlight is on them even when they are off work. The camera's don't stop when the director yells cut. Their lives are captured continuously.<br>  <br>  Acting is as old as storytelling, Music is as old as rhythm. It's part of what makes us human. Respect it.|`|9ilXVowLaa	i do believe there are unions-Sag,screen writer's guild.<br>  Actong to me is not work,nor is singing.<br>  just my opinion.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	I'd say 6 months of 12 hour days shooting scene after scene on set after set all across the world sounds like pretty hard work to me.<br>  <br>  They are paid according to the demand for their work. They are only paid as much as we the consumers allow them to be paid via the tickets and merchandise we buy.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	If they are actors, they belong to a union, and pay dues and everything.  Tv and movie actors usually have very long days.  It can take hours for a shot to be filmed, and they sit around in full makeup and costumes until it is done.  Some celebrities like Paris Hilton get paid to show up at a club, just so their name will draw a big crowd.  A few actually work on designing things, but most of the time they are the name behind someone else's creative forces.  Musicians of course spend a lot of their time composing, and recording, and touring and yes that can be considered hard work--especially if you are a fairly new artist and can't afford the cost of a plane to jet you to each show.|`|gAOAdOHraa	I think that what they do is work and I'm sure they work long hours so the public thinks what they do looks easy.  I do think they get paid too much money.  Just think if that money was evenly distributed in society how much better life would be.  Brad Pitt once said that he is an actor and gets paid to act and doesn't want the media in his life all the time.  I think that if he is receiving that sort of money then he needs to put up with the media.|`|l7fiAHRLaa	You know they don't make themselves celebrities, the media does.|`|AA12092217	id say some of them are egotistic snobs who are paid far to much|`|AA10326997	Yes, I do think most celebrities are working.  Not all, but most.  Acting is work, and is HELL on your personal life.  So is singing or working in music.  I have family in both professions, and I never get to see them. They work all the time.  They're not famous, but they work with some very famous people. The stories they tell me about how celebrities lose their private lives and have to resort to all sorts of tricks just to keep some semblance of a normal life makes me realize that it must suck to be a celebrity.  Success is great, but I'll pass on fame. <br>  <br>  And, yes, they do have unions for the entertainment professions.  And most are artists, except for those who are celebrities for just their wealth or some such.|`|2vidb5ZAaa	They are workers and entertainers<br>  <br>  <br>  their job is to be an entertainer<br>  <br>  they work hard (well most of them)<br>  for what they do and it took them a while to get there <br>  its not just turning rich overnight (for most)<br>  <br>  they embrace their own talent and get paid for it<br>  thats good<br>  =)<br>  <br>  i feel bad for the ones who are so filthy rich<br>  that they dont know what to do with the money<br>  and end up going down the deadly road of drugs|`|1neMZoRLaa	I do consider what they do work, but I think it's retarded how they get so much attention.They're mostly musicians and actors.They are useless.They aren't a nessesity to have in society. Doctors save lives, but they don't get attention from the media at all. I can think of alot of jobs that  deserve more attention than celebrities.|`|g2JqGIOCaa	Yes, they work.<br>  <br>  Some work a lot and get paid very little.<br>  <br>  A very small number of them become very popular (for no good reason) and end up working less and making much, much more.<br>  <br>  The big stars, or celebrities are extremely overpaid.  The production crews and especially the stunt people are the ones who should be making the big bucks, not Brad Pitt or Julia Roberts.|`|FBvadJxZaa	Work is putting your ability *or inability* to do something to get something accomplished.<br>  <br>  Celebs are paid per movie, or per season. I don't know about interviews, speaches etc.<br>  <br>  Oh yes, anytime their name is out there, they get paid. Some of them,no it's not worth anything.<br>  <br>  both, they work,but yet they are paid to entertain us. <br>  <br>  No more rights than anyone else. only they have acheived that that was their goal of being an entertainer.<br>  <br>  Some do work with unions,yes i believe.<br>  <br>  Yes Celebs are considered artist. <br>  <br>  Good question btw!! Star for you!! ;-)|`|6YLBfhc7aa	NOUN:<br>  <br>     1. Physical or mental effort or activity directed toward the production or accomplishment of something.|`|AA11991925	i believe some ccelebrities work .. some do not and take the credit for it|`|7wY015Ysaa	It depends what you been by 'celeb', media whores are worthless... but people who write songs, and make brilliant music which can change peoples lives deserve the money they get for the hours of hard work and use of their talent.|`|3BfNshHYaa	pay for celebs? not rly fair....<br>  fireman work all day saving lives yet they dont get paid nearly as much as celebs do... maybe our world is just desperate for media and entertainment
rgwFBtkwaa	It depends how secure you are in your relationships. I don't think anyone would find it that easy but if you were completely comfortable in the love your partner has for you, then you'd just have to deal with it and try not to get jealous because it's part of their job. It would make it easier if they told you about how much he smelt or that she doesn't find people like him attractive or something. <br>  You would definitely have to tell magazines that you were comfortable - you wouldn't want them to get a whiff of anything else because they would report it the next day as a new scandal. <br>  I suppose Jennifer didn't have an inkling about Brad & Angelina because she thought he as totally besotted by her. I don't think it was the love scenes that tipped them over the edge - I'm sure it was getting to know each other and realising they were meant to be (in their eyes anyway).|`|Uv6fADcaaa	I would fell totally comfortable... Jealousy is derived form insecurity, which isn't attractive... hence, the man leaving the insecure person.<br>  <br>  It's just a job, exp you have taxes at home and your husbands an accountant... are you jealous of the time he devote to other peoples taxes,lol... no.  I know it's not the same... but you get the point. They aren't really having sex anyhow, unless your man is in the porn industry... then you have a whole other bag of issues to work through...
MAGcwMUfaa	well it made me read the question.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	I was born naked and I live naked as much as the law allows, naked to me is normal!|`|icmvhWndaa	haha u have nothing better to do than think of this quetion!|`|mggll8dRaa	Just Bare-ly......!!|`|s7UWLOS9aa	Yeah. sure?|`|BdQbVLk0aa	hell yeah... but its not exactly the weirdest word(statement) I've ever heard that make you think "What?" and tune into the conversation...

FeZR63f8aa	I don't base my opinion of artists on others' opinions, though I am a little shy of sharing my opinion with people sometimes because of their extreme distaste for the artists I like, such as some of the ones that have gotten pretty mainstream.  Sometimes I'll defend though, but I'm not going to ignore something I think is good. I like a lot of stuff I hear.<br>  It bugs me when people are down on people like Green Day and My Chemical Romance.  They got to where they are right now through a lot of work and good music, so just because they've gotten really popular is no reason to hate on them.<br>  Also Fall Out Boy, to a lesser degree since I only have From Under The Cork Tree.<br>  If I don't like a band, it's their music I don't like.  Like, I have no problem with saying I'm not a huge fan of Hinder or Nickelback, but that's my opinion, and I'd never say I HATE them.<br>  Everyone's always going to have their opinions and so agreeing to disagree, respecting other people's opinions, would be really great.  I wish people would do that more, instead of the opinionated "I HATE GREEN DAY!" or "MCR SUCKS!"|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  I think there are quite a few of those people around here though.  I for one don't care what anyone else here thinks of the music I listen to/don't listen to.  I think I've been very vocal in the fact that I despise The Doors, and a lot of people on here love them.  If I dislike a band, I will let it be known, but if I do like a band, I will stand up for them no matter what.|`|Zxl8oyIraa	every now and again i find myself disagreeing with some ppl, mainly because of them liking screamo or disliking korn, but i just avoid that question b/c they clearly dont want my kind of advice any way.<br>  <br>  p.s. i hate green day for real. i guess wat ud call pop rock voices lik theirs just really piss me off somethin fierce.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	I actually can't stand Green Day recently I don't know why.. even stuff off of Dookie bothers me.<br>  <br>  I have to say I've turned a shoulder to U2 (whom I used to like). I don't dislike them, I've just been "meh" about them lately.<br>  Especially hearing their new song "Get on Your Boots". BONO shut up|`|OLCoFKQraa	It's a defense mechanism for metalheads and punks, simply making it a rule that popular = bad is a way of ensuring that the corporate brainwashing never works, but the problem is beating the reverse brainwashing too, it's tricky to know whether you hate something because it's popular or not, getting around the reverse brainwashing is tricky, but I think I'm in that place now, it took me till my late 20's.|`|qAfnWKQCaa	Nope. I like the Sex Pistols and I'm not into that subculture crap. That gets me a lot of criticism from all sides.<br>  <br>  I listen to some of the oldest most mainstream music out there, I also listen to new underground hard rock. If you dont define yourself by your music then it wont offend you when people dont like your music.|`|Rc5oLRXAaa	yes. i love rock/metal, but recently, its become just a fad. a bunch if people like slipknot, metallica, ac/dc now and i don't like it. i was a fan of slipknot way before Vol. 3. i mostly like the stuff from the iowa album. but now all bands have become pu$$ys and sold out. that's why i hate what used to be my fave bands|`|Catsy82Caa	i've never heard green day all that much but i like that dude's voice<br>  <br>  uhhh yeah i'll admit i'm guilty of doing that primarily with acts like limp bizkit or linkin park<br>  <br>  i still think they're trash but i've only heard maybe one song from the both of them|`|87deabd3c525e7aca518d4cbf44e4df0aa	Nope. I don't even ever openly bash any musician or band on here anyway. I don't really like to waste my time talking about something I don't like. It's pointless.|`|vgcY5jHuaa	No, I hate bands because I do, not because other people pressure me to.|`|fc9ecb5a900817a0bcf8f6fa3590baf3aa	No, I dont think it really matters. If everyone liked the same exact things, life would be really boring.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	4 words.... I'm a slipknot fan.<br>  <br>  There's your answer right there! =P|`|KKlP1Kpoaa	actually i like the exact opposite of whatevers "in". like what u want and be damn proud of it. so i like 70's bands and not the rap metal hiphop crap everyone else does....sew me!!!! also greenday.....thier first songs were decent but they took a down hill run. thier songs just get boring after a short time. but dont let that change your own opinion|`|2i6TPlauaa	No, I really dig Kanye West|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Sounds liek Metallica.<br>  <br>  A lot of BAndwagon hate.<br>  <br>  Me, personally, could not care less what anyone else thinks.<br>  <br>  I like what I like, and hate what I hate for one reason only.<br>  <br>  Because its how I feel about it.  Period.
jeZmqhNcaa	I guess, as long as I liked the house, but I would plant trees or something so I couldnt see it|`|GB858dS0aa	no it is too creepy.|`|ssrLnvvWaa	i live right next to a funeral home|`|XKWJg9Ruaa	Probably not. I'm a big chicken when it comes to dead people.|`|8MZuVAKiaa	Of course I would... where would there be a wrong in that? it's not like they all awake at night and become flesh-eating zombies or anything... it's just a yard filled with boxes, filled with people who have peacefully moved on with life.<br>  I wouldn't care at all.|`|h5p9exIDaa	Hi Vance,<br>   No way!!! Cemeteries give Me the Creeps and No way will I buy a house close to one..Even if the place was Free,I still wouldn't take it..<br>   Do you remember, "The Night Of The Living Dead"!!!<br>  Your Friend,<br>  poppy1|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	I love cemeteries.

We have an old cemetery on our property.   We maintain it and keep it trim.   It's a nice place to be.   The tombstones date from the 1700s-1948.   Even though we never knew these people, we honor their life.  We have fenced it and put in a bench.  I know that there are some buried there without markers, so some day I hope to research that and put up some kind of marker for them.   I am sure their spirits would appreciate it.|`|et9gdoDKaa	Why not? You'll be IN the cemetery one day anyway...|`|AA10326997	Absolutely, if the rest of the neighborhood was nice.  It's like living next to a park or the golf course for a good view, but without the noise.  <br>  <br>  You know, cemetaries aren't that bad.  The worst thing about them is probably the kids who think it's cool to go drinking in them at night.  Otherwise, what harm can it do?  Even if I did believe in ghosts, I would think they'd haunt where they lived or died, not where they're buried.|`|8OHsqwo6aa	i grew up about 2 blocks from a cemitary. all the kids in the neiborhood loved to play there.  it's a place where there are always conversations with God and that kind energy stays there.  It's very peaceful. don't be surprised if you find yourself taking walks there.|`|y7IiZwuYaa	HELL NO..... they freak me out........ i had to walk by one, one night.... well actually i ran by it|`|dFNaSqBUaa	HAHAHA<br>  <br>  I don't think i would.<br>  <br>  See there might be all rumors but what if?<br>  <br>  The WHAT IF<br>  <br>  Thats what would always keep me away....<br>  <br>  What if a dead body rises....from its tomb...?<br>  What if you see shadows....and there is no one there?<br>  What if you heard noises.....coming from the cemetary?<br>  What if your dogs doesn't stop barking at the cemetery?|`|nlGXGRLvaa	sure if I were allowed to piss on the graves.|`|Yngu1eu7aa	well if i wouldn't because i get creeped out by it, but if don't believe in ghosts and spirits and stuff then should buy one. i mean they're cheap and all and the neighborhood looks nice|`|q34vCB3Qaa	maybe|`|L8TdPM0yaa	Yes! Just check it out, make sure it isnt haunted by a mean ghost, A nice ghost is EXTREMELY fun to have around!|`|Pnn3VgFpaa	Ofc! Dead people are not dangerous, gotta watch out for the ones that are alive!|`|iQ13PoEiaa	absolutely not. not only does it give off a really ominous feeling, a lot of stuff goes down. satanists. haha. you know. stuff like that.|`|DNknBxRWaa	Sure :D<br>  *thinks*(then i can bury the people i killed)<br>  <br>  aw shoot did i say that out loud....|`|qaw8BwqTaa	Why not? Cemetaries are always considered spooky due to the movie industry, however they are very pleasant and Holy!|`|9JVFeo0Maa	Yeah, if I liked the house, as long as the house wasn't built on the cemetary I am all for it.|`|MiulNPYNaa	It depends on if your bothered by it or not. My friend lives right next to one, its basically his backyard, and it doesn't bother him at all|`|iLsjaMIyaa	Nooo.... i'll freak out all the time =)|`|3DmwSkdnaa	No, I'd try to avoid that house|`|2WbR3IvFaa	Hell No|`|VAfyKWmUaa	Oh hell no....Lmao|`|lyIPfqbvaa	I would....cemetaries are among the quietest places I know of. It'd be good to go out in the middle of the night and just listen....listen...then run away terrified|`|Y44ZKI97aa	nooooooooooo...nope nope nope. NO.|`|Cie6smHaaa	No I have a cemetery-phobia|`|aBALRxBUaa	Hell yeah. It's not like the neighbors are gonna complain about you being too loud.|`|ht4Yzzu9aa	yeah, I would, who cares.|`|MAGcwMUfaa	Yeh why not.|`|NlXWdRcQaa	I probably would. Cemetaries don't really freak me out, it's just a place. ?|`|9m9gHZhpaa	yes|`|B66JN4NRaa	yeah they dont scare me at all [cemetarys that is]|`|ZGvpWQ1Aaa	i would. :) i can't resist a good ghost hunt!|`|r1lGbEKqaa	no way. If you give me the house for free, I wouldn't even want the house.|`|g8hNrohLaa	Sure, and I'd go there late at night and see if there are any spirits lurking about.  :D|`|FVfBm86Caa	in manila people live in them. they have shops and tv in tombs|`|9HSSXeEcaa	no way it wwould scare the hell out of me|`|WzCSfPYlaa	I'd buy a shotgun too just in case.|`|xxSGhywoaa	I grew up my entire life surrounded by two cemeteries.  Coincidentally, now that I've moved out of my parents'  house, I'm surrounded by churches.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	nope.. thats way too close, and my neighbors would be just TOO quiet..|`|AA10716061	I would as long as if it's located in the good parts of town|`|grifjdr0aa	sure.  QUIET NEIGHBORS for a change.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Yes. I have actually lived next to a cemetery...<br>  <br>  I have news for you...<br>  <br>  "their dead"...<br>  <br>  They are not going to show up in my front yard and mow it for us!|`|mggll8dRaa	Of Course, why not.....??|`|AA10286634	I live in the u s.  From an anthropological standpoint, i probably do live in a cemetery.  People were buried where the soil was the softest, like near a waterway, and I live on creek bed.|`|yYXWcAgYaa	y not buy it <br>  its kewl seriously|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I am more afraid of the living than I am of the dead!|`|vMeSBnE1aa	our area in the philippines is near the cemetery and i dont see any problem with it.|`|CoEVVkNhaa	I live near 18 actually and probably 1.3 million people are buried there.|`|s7UWLOS9aa	I already live right next to a funeral home.|`|st2zmU88aa	Maybe|`|XEGG1l6Raa	yes. why are people afraid of dead people. im not. im scared of the ones that are alive. ghosts? ehh...
0XSvQt2Aaa	I think that it looks that way too. MAybe she is trying to strut or something. LOL|`|rwXcLTNvaa	Yeah, I have noticed that, and that may be in her character as that would be really awkward if it wasn't.

AA12256905	I graduated from the Film Production program at VFS. If you are really competitive, then you can get a job, but not a big one. You have to work really hard for a few years and try to get to know the big ones in the industry in person to get higher. Let's not forget that the job opportunities are narrow and there are tens of thousands of VERY talented people who are standing in the line to get hired as well. <br>  Canada does not have a big film industry anyway and now due to the economy depression it might even get worse.<br>  VFS offers one of the best programs in visual effects in North America, but no matter what they promise you they can't secure you a job upon graduation.<br>  Animation and special effects course is a one year program which costs about 35,000 for a Canadian resident. (over 50 grands for foreigners) And since it is a private school, they don't offer credit courses, so you won't be able to use them for higher education.<br>  If you are going to attend, do have a plan for student loan payment in case you don't get your dream job right away.|`|4wkIOVDoaa	Film is hard to get into but if ur talented you'll get there. You pretty much have to make short indie films on you're own. My bro is into that stuff and he says school can be a waste of time for creative people. Maybe just do a semester and see how you like it.|`|EQvFckORaa	<a href="http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com" rel="nofollow">http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check

rXlyHk1Raa	Yeah. There would have been no Damageplan, therefore Dime wouldn't have been shot. Plus they might have put pressure on Metallica to put out better albums<br>  <br>  MQ: Guns N' Roses... the good kind|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Am I the only one who cannot stand Pantera. Phil Anselmo was a anoying little sh*t. I will give it to you though Dimebag was a pretty cool guy.<br>  <br>  I wish Cliff Burton would have never died, I think Metallica would have been strong until 1996 he was a good song writer. Not to discredit Newsted because he is a decent bassist.|`|ty3nnq2uaa	Yeah<br>  I start daydreaming thinking ........Pantera..... still around.........next album round the corner..........and then the harsh reality comes on and the bliss is gone.<br>  well whatta do??<br>  whats happened is happened<br>  And yeah it would be great if Cliff Burton was around<br>  but truly speaking i love death Magnetic<br>  i think it was their best album after Master of Puppets<br>  only lars needs to improve<br>  and trujillo was awesome|`|M7E1uIsKaa	^ agreed ^<br>  <br>  I Love Phil!  But he f*cked up!  I wish Pantera was still around.. but maybe its good that they broke up when they did. Atleast they didnt turn out like other bands (cough*metallica*cough) and start putting out crappy albums. <br>  <br>  <br>  RIP dime :(|`|Zxl8oyIraa	it would in fact be fantastic. are we assuming dime bag would, u know, live? anyways, yeah itd be great|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	Yes, I think it would have been. Fans would probably be happily anticipating their next album, waiting for Dime to play one of his spectacular riffs. <br>  <br>   I wish the original Metallica was around. I wish Layne Staley was still alive, so Alice In Chains could form as well.|`|DioXrjBIaa	Mmm, just maybe! <br>  I have turned to Megadeth, Kreator and Death Angel for my thrash needs now =D<br>  <br>  BA: System of a Down.|`|CRksMyK0aa	for sure my brother.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Well I mean Woulda, Shoulda, Coulda. it happened and that's it, its done. <br>  <br>  But okay I will brain storm your Q its cool. I just like to stay in reality as much as possible =P<br>  <br>  Yeah if Phil would have never hit the Dope I think Pantera would still be together. I am not putting it ALL on Phil but he chose dope over his band the brothers gave him several warnings to stop and clean up so they could rebuild a foundation of trust. But phil kept hitting the needle.<br>  <br>  Sure I wish they were still together. Then Dimebag would also still be here
6CztVG3xaa	It was a solid movie.  Not a typical directorial outing for Darren Aronofsky, but it was captivating...and even though Aronofsky is an amazing director, Michey Rourke is the reason to watch this film.  Anyone else playing Randy "The Ram" Robinson just would not do.  <br>  <br>  The story itself is nothing spectacular.  Just the story of a washed-up wrestler trying to make a comeback...but again I stress, Mickey Rourke is without a shadow of a doubt, the reason to watch this film.  Playing opposite him also, Evan Rachel Wood and Marissa Tomei hold their own and put in great performances.  <br>  <br>  So on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the best for me, I would say it comes in at a solid 7.5.  Definitely worth your time, but leaves you with a feeling of sadness and uncertainty afterwards.|`|84db822e80c8ab6223d50689fd25b00aaa	I really liked the movie too.<br>  I learned a lot about amateur wrestling and all that wrestlers go through to entertain audiences.<br>  I like the way it ended, because it seemed realistic, as did the rest of the movie, and the performances from all of the cast members were excellent.<br>  I hope Mickey gets the Oscar!|`|5bt3ujJraa	i found it good but boring, i expected more, it was overrated

07e298f31128d8990fbe7f91e4f12ae4aa	well it's kind of a weird thing. No body should ever raise a hand to another person.<br>  <br>  However: out of temper I reach over and smacked my boyfriend when he had his eyes closed. He reached up and smacked me back on the arm.<br>  Years later I think I deserved it at the time. I had a black and blue mark on my arm for a week. <br>  <br>  I don't hit anybody these days.<br>  And if I did I would know there would be consequences.|`|mggll8dRaa	It will Cost A Man if He does, if not Jail, then Big-time in the Wallet;<br>  <br>  Better to stay clear of the 'Bad Girls'.....!!|`|a4LWildhaa	Never !|`|4d3Md9pnaa	If she's doing it to intentionally harm me and it actually WILL harm me, I'll hit back.<br>  <br>  My "rule": If it's going to kill me, I'll either run like hell or defend myself.<br>  <br>  If she's just messing around, I might playfully hit back.|`|AA10047060	honestly i don't like physical abuse especially in the movies remeber<br>  WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT? it made me nervous 2 watch|`|Cil20kdYaa	absolutely not!<br>  girls shouldn't hit guys either though|`|yYXWcAgYaa	a guy cant hit a girl no matter wat happened|`|KKx8Mb63aa	Well, I'm a girl and if I hit a guy I expect to be hit back.<br>  No harder than necessary.<br>  <br>  If a girl punches a guy as hard as she can trying to hurt them, then the guy should hit her back. She asked for it.<br>  That is called equality.|`|Y51w7dNUaa	i think its wrong but hey dont do what you dont want to happen to you thats my motto and im a girl so O_o why the thumbs down?i have a right to my opinion jeez|`|tvHM7hdDaa	legally yes.<br>  Hover, the unspoken rules of society say no.|`|C7baXdSZaa	No you just have to be a man and take it!! You just sit their like a vegetable while she hits you lol|`|DlMsJPwUaa	Nope, not cool|`|uB2K3XD0aa	sure....if he takes lessons from chrish brown first he can...|`|JpfECkjzaa	id feel bad....im too big to touch girls like that|`|AA11189849	I had to teach this to my little boy.  SOME girls think that it is cute or that they have the right.  They do not.   <br>  When my little boy was five and an angry little girl about 9 punched him hard in the chest while at the park  (none of them saw me right behind him as they came down the slide)  She was yelling at him saying he couldn't play with them. And  my poor little boy stood with tears in his eyes, stunned.  He didn't hit her as I taught him. But boy, did I give that little brat the scare of her life!  She ran so fast after I confronted her in a VERY scary way.  (I didn't touch her, though.)<br>  So yeah, there are all sorts of gray areas.<br>  <br>  Now, can a guy hit a girl if she hits him first.  Legally? No.  It is assault both ways.  Did you know that if I came up to you and pointed at you and poked you lightly, and you said you felt pain, that is assault?  <br>  If she hits him, he can have her arrested.  If she attacks him, it is on and he can defend himself.  Not all Brown Vs. Rhiannah or anything like that but defend himself.<br>  <br>  I don't hit guys.  I've thrown a few drinks in men's faces in my hey-day.  I'm not proud of it but they deserved it.|`|mwdwDOaWaa	When angry, a person is not himself (from a man's point of view). He may resort to physical violence as his pan- ultimate show of authority. God did make man physically stronger than women, so that he may be her protector, not her abuser.<br>  <br>  Only a weak man will strike a woman, no matter what.<br>   Q #1 "Do you think that if a guy is...lets say, punched by a lady does he have the right to punch her back?

"<br>  A#2 NO<br>  <br>   Q #3 "Do you think that if a guy is...lets say, punched by a lady does he have the right to punch her back? "<br>  A#31 YES, somethings things, hormones, emotion and anger are just beyond the person's control.|`|Syn2excFaa	I would not slap back because that isn't right. If I was slapped then there probably was a good reason for it. Even if there was no reason I wouldn't slap back. The only reason I would defend myself is if I was about to get seriously hurt or my life was at risk. A slap can't break your bones or kill you so no I would not slap back.|`|y7IiZwuYaa	If a girl thinks shes man enough to hit one then she better be ready to get hit back. If i hit a man first, then he can hit me back but if i don't hit you first keep your hands off of me. Slap? hahaha yea right i would be throwing punches|`|UbM3YHS5aa	umm it depends;)  if she hits you like a dude then she can take it like a dude but if its a little slap then man up and take it   lol  honestly no a man should be a man and walk away.|`|aBALRxBUaa	Punching a woman is uncalled for. But if she really deserves it, why not a backhand across the chops? Only if she really deserves it.|`|PGq1Jm4Maa	NO NEVER EVER EVER!|`|mns5yLmRaa	I don't know about this one, I don't think that guys should hit girls but what are you supposed to do??|`|UdemZ27caa	HAHA i'm always hitting guys. But playfully...!<br>  Guys are usually rougher and stronger so it wouldn't be fair for them to hit back.|`|88KRRWPzaa	no!|`|Cie6smHaaa	Seriously stop abusing me.|`|ssrLnvvWaa	in self defense sure then yes. But if they got in a fight and she hit him he should try to be the bigger person and walk away.|`|UBdiyHu5aa	I think you should be able to smack the s**t outta them. Some of them even like it!|`|561nzKviaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo im a girl and theres a law and you will get arested|`|4b7598fb11241e3ead2dd43bfb020adcaa	No no no. I don't think a guy should ever hit a girl, even for self defense. That's like wrong on so many levels|`|QooHtEC6aa	i don't know. ask Chris Brown|`|60484e1a567d1571767f63b8cb41172baa	A "guy" might, but a man would not.  A man can subdue a woman.  Yes, it's wrong for a girl to strike out at you.  But as "man," you supposedly, have the physical strength to subdue her, so there is no need for it on your end.  Better yet, just walk away.  Because if a female does that to you, show so little respect for you, why would you want to be with her or waste your time with her? PS. Tv is not real life, and part of the problem our society has today, because of the garbage and trash on tv that kids grew up thinking it was norm, when it's not!!!.

KTg4Gl1faa	He was a rising star in the 80s with movies like Pope of Greenwich Village, Rumble Fish, 9 1/2 weeks, Body Heat, etc.  He was really good looking.  He starred in the movie Wild Orchid, which co-starred his future wife (Carrie Otis?).  This movie was famous becuase rumour was that the final overhead sex scene shot recorded actual penetration.  He started to party too much and made bad decisions and he pissed off studios.  In the 90s he became a boxer (apparently not a bad one).  He's been trying to restore his career in the 2000s.  Problem is he had a bad reputation, no one cared that he was gone and he wasn't what he once was.  Due to injuries from his boxing career and rumoured plastic surgery (botox in particular) his face was radically different.  If you see a split screen of then and now it would blow your mind.  He made the movie the Wrestler which is getting rave reviews and he's up for an Oscar.  He won the Golden Globe for best actor last month.<br>  <br>  He's trying to use this as a comeback.  Question is will he be able to maintain it.  He started trash talking  a real wreslter (Jericho) and was in talks to participate in a WWE event.  His agent told him not to do it, as he'd lose any credibility he recently gained.  Sadly, photos of him don't help as his wardrobe is quite flashy and his hair is often long and greasy.  It doesn't help his image.  It sort of feeds into the charactericutre of himself that he's being percieved as.|`|7gpAdJGaaa	HE DON'T TAKE NO GUFF FROM NO ONE ASK JOHN CLAUD VAN DAMN|`|dBS6a7nXaa	Philip Andre "Mickey" Rourke, Jr. (born September 16, 1952)[1] is an Academy Award- and SAG award-nominated, BAFTA Award- and Golden Globe Award-winning American actor who has appeared primarily as a leading man in action, drama and thriller films.<br>  <br>  Trained as a boxer in his early years, Rourke had a short stint as a pro fighter in the 1990s.

DLk9SRjRaa	If you liked Jack Johnson proper than you won't be disappointed.  it does contain the tracks used on the album, as well as a whole lot of outtakes, alternate versions, and a lot of entirely different songs.  I personally think its worth owning for disc three alone, so if you're really into to that era of miles(JJ, Bitches Brew, etc) definately go for it.  I personally love it, especially all of the takes of right off, and honky tonk. It's ultimately a must have for fans of the era.|`|AW2PENW3aa	it's alright if you like Willie Nelson...

iz4dA2Mjaa	Lol, u re so funny, I see your point. I think no matter how mtv for instance claims to accept gay people and include them in the real world, there is still a limit because there are still a lot of people out there who think there is something wrong with being gay. I believe this is why most networks just stick to more heterosexual based shows, however, i would like a dating show, were gay men had to compete for the love of one gay man and not on a gay tv chanel, but on a regular network. At that point i will believe we are accepting gay people better.

I'm glad his character, although it is the new LEAD character, isn't just a Grissom replacement.  It wouldn't have made sense (and probably would've alienated some diehard Grissom fans) to have a new character take over the crime lab.<br>  <br>  I loved Grissom for his quirkiness and analytical, detached, methodical approach.  Showing him as dramatic and emotional (in his last episodes) was out of character for him.<br>  <br>  I DO agree with the answerer above, too ... I miss Warrick!

tcvQwTa5aa	the best matches are the other fire signs,Aries and Sagittarius,more so the Aries.Leo and Aquarius are opposites yet can be very good for eachother in the long run.The worst match is presumably the Leo and Cancer.I am a Leo married to an Aries and even though we have our little power struggles we're very good together (in bed and out).|`|b157af2401c92b177ac9b80e3f36d329aa	For you it is important to look for someone less egoitic than you. Obviously don't look out for another Leo.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	You want me to tell you what you like ?<br>  really weirrd.. But i guess someone who gives you lots of attention and compliments. A fun extroverted girl or guy who loves to party all the time party all the time PArTY all the tiiiimE!
0vlm2OZcaa	Go with someone who meets the age requirements.|`|ErmcT4uUaa	Wear a fake beard and wear a beer t shirt|`|r9lfDeRmaa	I agree with the first answer, just wait. Or get a chaperone to go with you.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	wait a year|`|nUdbTUtHaa	Take someone that is 21+ (older brother, one of your dads) they have to buy a ticket and go in with you, but then they can just leave<br>  <br>  If the theater is really that strict and wont let you in (with the whole checking IDs thing) then yeah, just have someone older come with you, buy your tickets, walk in with you, then leave after like 10min or so.|`|8jQ3FBpAaa	pay some hobo to buy you a ticket.|`|9m9gHZhpaa	have an adult take you|`|uPRYwa3zaa	if you don't want to steal buy a ticket for something rated pg 13 and go into the r rated movie, just know what theater everything is in because sometimes the R rated movie is right infront of the ticket checker that's what happened to me one time. but if it's like a weekday the ticker checker won't even be there usually so you can basically sneek in no problem|`|AA10237782	Draw a beard on ur face|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	If you don't look 18 then they will ask for ID. I wouldn't try...When I went to go see Sex and The City, a couple of kids got taken out during the movie because they were underage. It must have been so embarrassing for them. But if you really want to try...I suggest wearing sun glasses so they can't see your eyes, and how nervous you might be. Wear more adult clothing, not some Hanna Montana shirt. Wear something you would normally see adults wearing...lol steal your moms clothing or an older sisters. Lmao ...unless you're a guy.|`|W4IOLSzbaa	Buy a ticket for another movie and assuming the R rated movie's door is out of the way/line of sight of the ticket taker/employee just walk right in other wise you're screwed/ask someone older to take you/buy you a ticket|`|qfSKgxDsaa	Buy your tickets online or not by a person (like at the machine that takes your credit card at the theater)  that way you get the tickets and then they shouldn't check when you go in; just want to know if you have a ticket ;) sure fire way to get in|`|rlfaVhlxaa	shave off the few strands of pubic hair you have and tape them to your face. theyll think you have a beard and wont i.d. you. or you know you could always have someone else buy the tickets for you....|`|qU8HqQsOaa	get tickets 2 a different movie and go in tat 1 by an accident lol m8 work..... u should try<br>  or get ur parents or some random adult u know 2 take u in|`|ulhyTxoGaa	good luck trying to get in.  theaters have been getting stricter about checking id's and crap.|`|5nmFtzgqaa	I'm not sure about your theater, but for the one where I live,<br>  you can buy the ticket no problem, but getting past the ticket guy is the worst.<br>  Try buying a ticket for another movie in the same area.<br>  In my theater, there's two sections that have a long hall of theaters,<br>  and I think that's how a lot of them work,<br>  so try buying a ticket for another movie that you can get in to,<br>  that's really close to the one you want to see,<br>  and see if that works.<br>  Awkward if you get caught though!<br>  Good luuuck!|`|DM2M5LK4aa	It all depends on the people who work at the theater.  You can get in easily if they let you in and don't ask for I.D... on the other hand, if they do ask for I.D. before they sell you the tickets, you may be screwed.  Furthermore, I know some theaters where I live that actually check I.D. at the door to be sure that you are in fact old enough to get in.<br>  <br>  So find the right theater to go to, or a teenager who works there that doesn't care.. or pull off some James Bond crap and sneak in through a back door.  I've done all three.|`|iEJTAVP3aa	maybe get a parent to buy it.<br>  or if they wont let you,<br>  make sure you ask for an adult ticket, not concession or student or something,<br>  dont bring your friends with you if they look younger <br>  make yourself look older.<br>  go to the counter that has a guy your age there, then he might 'sneak' you a ticket<br>  hahaha ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  im guessing you wanna see my bloody valentine?<br>  im 14 and i got in :D|`|eZrK3Jhzaa	well all you need to do is buy a ticket for a pg or pg 13 movie that airs at around the same time, then just walk into the R movie.<br>  if anyone asks you, just say that your dads inside or something :)<br>  its really no big deal.|`|uvICu0gNaa	just ask a random person to be your guardian lol thats what me and my friends did once good luck|`|ADSCOgxmaa	by a ticket to the theatre RIGHT beside the one you wanna see then walk into the other one dress in clothes that make you look older or gangster then you get left alone trust me it works homie|`|mtgrfJvSaa	buy tickets to another movie thats starts the same time the one u wanna see and once ur in go into the one u wanna see|`|SyYwJOZNaa	Have an older friend buy your tickets.<br>  Or find some random person who is of age.|`|IRMmQ1FHaa	Bribe a homeless man.

Either way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or...   Dress like a woman.  What?  Its possible, be in the ticket line with a man at the window.  Flutter your eye lashes, he wont check your id.|`|sFwS0fkgaa	take ur permit, if ur 16 and have a permit they might be bad with math and mistake u for 17 and if they catch u,<br>   tell them to be cool about it,<br>  ...like us teenagers never seen boobs and blood (Sarcasm)|`|rT7CHczsaa	bg

WJvXapq8aa	that movie has not been dubbed... Partly b/c someone would have to license it and seeing how our conservative country (if you live in the USA) when it licenses something cuts out even the possibility of a love interest, i doubt that movie will ever be dubbed.

GywOmWfIaa	Fruits Basket|`|6qDhXpWfaa	Natsume Yujincho - but it isn't the main character =P<br>   <br>  It's about this guy who can see faerie creatures and learned that his grandmother could too when he moves to where she used to live. His grandmother left the "book of friends" behind which has the names of faeries she beat. The names let her and now him control the faeries who have their names in the book. He decides to give back those names and in doing so meets and interacts with them like he hasn't before, which changes him.<br>  <br>  Guru Guru Pon-Chan - manga<br>  <br>  It's about this dog who can turn into a girl when she puts on this collar. When she becomes a girl she meets this guy that she falls for and eventually he finds out she's actually a dog, but still likes her. <br>  <br>  Fruits Basket<br>  <br>  It's about a girl who discovers the family secret of Yuki Sohma, the popular guy and 'prince' of her school. The secret is that some members of his family are possessed by spirits of the zodiac and change into the animal they're posessed by when they're hugged by the opposite sex.|`|wiOYuubmaa	winx club...does a fairy count as an animal?<br>  <br>  Here's a list of a bunch of vampire anime's I found on this site:<br>  <br>  Vampire Hunter D:Bloodlust<br>  Chibi Vampire<br>  Hellsing<br>  Blood+<br>  Vampire Princess Miyu<br>  Blood: The Last Vampire<br>  Black Blood Brothers<br>  Trinity Blood<br>  Rosario + Vampire<br>  Vampire Wars<br>  Hitsuji no Uta<br>  Monster Princess<br>  Tsukuyomi -MOON PHASE<br>  Kigeki<br>  Vampiyan Kids<br>  Robin-Witch Hunter<br>  NightWalker<br>  Vampire Knight|`|FNDoFvGLaa	Toykyo mewmew if your older but if ur like 4 mewmew power...

She looks like a girl, she's supposed to be 16 yet has the body of a porn star and there is a reason for this. Through most of the series she even thinks she's human, but events lead her to finally find the truth to what she really is.<br>  <br>  Turns out she's really an android killing machine programmed to think she's the late Mefon Li by her uncle. Purpose to get revenge on a pirate lord Goryu. And there's another twist, limited life span.|`|Z15TM1VQaa	I hadn't made summaries for some of the animes on the list and I don't really have time to wright them but I'll put them on the list anyways. I'm not going to say that the summaries are that good but they are at least better than having none.<br>  <br>  <br>  Winx Club<br>  Bloom is an average teanage Earth girl going into highschool or thats what she thinks untill she meets princess Stella of the planet Solaria. Stella just happened to be in truble at the time when Bloom had first meet her, but after Stella tells her what was happening Stella ends up telling Bloom that she is a pixi, and a powerful one too. So Stella takes Bloom to a highschool for pixies and Bloom starts to live in a world she would only be dreamming about if she hadn't met Stella.<br>  <br>  Full Metal Alchemist <br>  This is about a pair of brothers that did a taboo and are trying to undo what they did. Durring there adventer they end up finding out things they shouldn't know that can distroy the country and kill everyone they know, so they are trying to stop that from happening.<br>  <br>  Yu Yu Hakusho<br>  Yusuke Urameshi is a street fighter with a tough guy approach to everything, but no one ever expected a sudden act of heroism on his part: dieing, from trying to save a little boy from a speeding car. When he arrived in the afterlife, he is informed that no one was expecting him to die that way, and were not prepared for his arrival. Yusuke is eventually revived, and is assigned to work for the Spirit Realm as a Spirit Detective in the human world. No one knows what this idiot will do but most times it seems like he ends up winning just by a little luck (or a cheap shot).<br>  <br>  Dragon Ball & Dragon Ball Z<br>  This anime is about a young boy named Goku meeting people, finding out what Dragon balls are, looking for the Dragon Balls, and a lot of other things that happen in Goku's life. Goku is really funny he thinks that anything you say is (or can be) related to either food or fighting<br>  <br>  Tokyo Mew Mew<br>  <br>  Gundam Seed & Gundam Seed Destiny<br>  <br>  Blood+<br>  <br>  Inuyasha|`|eQuKskdtaa	Mmm well Naruto is human, but he is a jinchuriki, which means he has a monster sealed inside of him...|`|7gmdPXc4aa	Dragonball Z, Please!

And it's also exactly what your looking for, though I can't give to much away. You can watch it on crunchyroll...but I think it's licensed now, so just watch it on veoh or download it on the veoh web player beta.|`|LIawiL9Gaa	Inuyasha was the first to come to mind, but as the person before me stated, there are too many anime series with such plot.|`|AA11942532	Yusuke from Yu Yu Hakusho is one main character that I know of.

You can make it sound cool if you really strum the first few chords hard on the lower strings.<br>  <br>  If you're playing electric guitar and want lead guitar stuff then you'd want something easy yet fun...like AC/DC is easy stuff to get into.|`|52otNiElaa	Guitar doesn't want u back, how could you ever leave her!|`|QUFAKk1paa	thanks for reminding me about alkaline trio. i totally forgot about their Good Mouring cd.|`|ambPUDB4aa	Smoke on the Water is an easy song to play i have heard|`|mtgrfJvSaa	chop suey, the hell song and really cool guitar songs are  we three kings and canon rock|`|OoftsMLhaa	METALLICA ALL SONGS<br>  <br>  or just blackened :P|`|vHNb0qvlaa	depends on how good you are, i could play riffs like message in a bottle, helicopter intro, damit intro stuff like that. if your not that good start of with police cas there pretty easy.|`|172gMslOaa	Nutshell by AIC.

Helga still likes him but he just doesn't seem to want to know.

See what fame does to you!<br>  <br>  To some it all up for ya...real music doesnt sell...Its a proven fact!|`|q4XUy0Duaa	LOL..If I carried a shovel around, I'd get arrested quicker than if I carried a gun.<br>  <br>  It makes you appreciate artists even more when you have to really look for them.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Honestly, a good way to find new artists is to ask for people here to put you on to new music and most of 'em will post links of their best songs.  I've found some good music that way, and this way you don't have to waste too much time digging through every album an artist dropped to see if you like 'em or not.|`|hjz4G3P6aa	you have to sell out to be mainstream- if any particular underground rapper is universally regarded as the best then hes no longer underground and you have some sell out like ice cube (as much as i love NWA)|`|os6FaEBlaa	Think about it this way. They do try to do that, the thing is that we throw dirt back on them burying them.<br>  <br>  I enjoy digging for artist. Because if you find artist no one's heard of then you can say that you introduced a person you told them about to, to them.<br>  <br>  It shows how much you will go to find good music.|`|f6522a133ad73f5b55bf2bbba116748daa	It seems ironic to me that we sit around complaining that there's no good music anymore, like our parents said to us, and their parents to them and so on and so forth.  You reach a certain maturity in life when you want more meaning out of your life, even if that includes the music you listen to.|`|haxPqmIgaa	I got aresseted three times for carryin a shovel waht happened:<br>  <br>  Oficer checks mi car, opens the trunk finds 3 machine guns and 5 packs of finished beer. mother ****** puts handcuffs on me and I wake up da next mornin in Jail and i find out it was b/c of the shovel!

It was ok. Not too crazy about the artwork. The plot is well developed but things can get a little bit annoying at times.

AA11097124	ahhahah he got plastic surgery, what else?<br>  <br>  his dad would always make fun of him for being black and having a black nose<br>  <br>  so now hes white with skinny nose.|`|iAuvoQeHaa	When he was a kid he had a big broad African American nose and when he was an adult he got it thinned like a lot of entertainment people do and it first it looked okay but he didn't know where to stop with it. It's like an anorexic (which he may also have been) who is so hung up on weight that they still think they're fat looking. They don't see what everyone else sees. Now he has to keep having reconstructive surgery to stop it crumbling and it seems like a skin eating bacteria is attacking it. He has a very serious form of body or image dysmorphia I think. The plastic surgeons who carried it out should be sued.<br>  <br>  (Yes I did hear that his father was abusive and teased him about his nose all the time, and being on camera all the time probably magnifies your insecurity ten times over.)|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	he has had many plastic surgeries on his nose because he is sensitive about his appearance.  He also lost weight at times due to 'dancing off the weight' which caused his nose to drop.  It is speculated that, that is why he often wears a mask to hide his nose.|`|kmwZnASgaa	michael jackson probably molested it too|`|AA12303060	What nose?|`|QoWi0hzWaa	ewww|`|KlMMOJaLaa	it bumped and it broke!   gore...|`|pn1NXuIbaa	I ate it.|`|ZKjATnFfaa	Ok heres what happend, when he got plastic surgery he got his nose replaced with a fake one but he has more than one fake nose and he has fake lips and eyes.|`|PvoJtgUQaa	what happened to reality? Where have you been?|`|Iniu9pzeaa	it looked around and saw the rest of him and bolted|`|LHaYBsJmaa	it ran away...|`|u3mGPBlFaa	you mean he still has it?|`|1uvrkDWNaa	It ran away from his face.|`|JLayHNZCaa	The cat got it?|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Really bad multiple plastic surgeries.  Now he is stuck sharing a nose with LaToya.  That's why you never see them together.|`|HURcAIu2aa	nose job more than 1<br>  people make a huge deal about it. Its not a big deal it dose not even look that bad I give it a 7 or 8 out of 10|`|pT514qPUaa	Maybe he broke it..<br>  Then he has a surgery for his nose.., but I heard it's not working..<br>  But he's OK.., his nose never fall..|`|yHYWdQAbaa	he sneezed.. and now he can't find it anywhere..:)<br>  .....back to the operating roomXD
QgxCbEk5aa	I think Madonna is afraid to get older so she tries her best to stay skinny, and pretty with the help of plastic surgery and other beauty applications. If however, she finally decides to let her grey hair, chubby cheeks, and wrinkles run its course naturally, then I would think she's pretty enough to accept the beauty of maturity and embrace her golden age. It's a pity women and  men these days do not want to age gracefully but tries so hard to look young, well if this shenanigans continues I gurantee you their will never be the sweet grey headed grandparents and aunts that we have now in the future.|`|iAuvoQeHaa	I think that she was but she went through a phase of wearing way too much makeup and she overdid it in the gym. She looks better when she's softer and more natural looking.|`|ebhu7ABvaa	Not without makeup. When young, she was cute...but not crazy hot. It was her personality that made her attractive. Energetic and sexy on stage.|`|gFbq7NgCaa	no offence to madonna or madonna likers/lovers  but i think heck no she is not pretty at all|`|QoWi0hzWaa	Negitive.|`|heAH8iFoaa	Naa.she's too old to use the word pretty|`|AA10509009	What?!

Today, not so much.|`|Q5E2s3R5aa	Yes when she acted her age.<br>  <br>  It's like she is fighting against her age.|`|KlMMOJaLaa	definitely not!|`|dejqLjaLaa	Not really.|`|80ehnLBJaa	Madonna is a stunning woman in person. She squeezed my hand and winked at me during her Reinvention Tour in 2004. She was gorgeous.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  When she is on stage/working, she may come across a bit harsh.  But, that is for her art/message.  She is toned down and natural in the real world.  Take a look at a picture when she is with her children. The world is youth obsessed.  Perhaps, she feels the need to stay as young as possible for the sake of her career?  She works hard to have the body she has.  I wish I had as much energy as she does.  Age is only a number.  50 is not old.  Just because someone may be over a certain age, that doesn't mean they aren't attractive or they need to disappear.  Madonna, herself, said she didn't think she was beautiful.  But, she thought she was stylish.  Beauty comes from inside.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/ap_Madonna_080207_ssv.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://a.abcnews.com/images/Entertainmen...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/16/article-1078044-0220F96F000005DC-52_468x645.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/1...</a>|`|hZVJRW7uaa	No, not really.

iGYUDPKhaa	Haha.<br>  BMTH is amazing. Legendary would probably be a better word.<br>  However, they're NOT the heaviest they'll go..<br>  I'm a HUGE fan of TDWP. I loveeeee them! :]<br>  Idk if all fans of TDWP like BMTH, because some people just don't like extreme hardcore shiz like BMTH.<br>  <br>  My favorite song by BMTH?<br>  SUICIDE SEASON!<br>  <3|`|DbtS5jzEaa	I am not a fan of BMTH...I only like my screaming with clean vocals :)<br>  <br>  Sorry Belong I disappoint hehe!<br>  <br>  Haven't seen you in a while though :) <br>  <br>  HIIIIIIIIIIIIII|`|FeZR63f8aa	I like Bring Me The Horizon, I wish I could go to Taste of Chaos to see them, but I have MME/ACT testing the day of and the days after it, so I'd never be able to convince my parents to take me or let me go. :(<br>  <br>  I like The Devil Wears Prada too.<br>  <br>  BMTH isn't the heaviest I'll go, but I'm not sure what is.<br>  <br>  Favorite song?  "Chelsea Smile". :D|`|dduWesM5aa	BMTH is okay, i they're not NEARLY as good as people say... i think it's just because most girls think Oli is hot lol. as far as heaviness is concerned i love deathcore, and i'm into way heavier bands, like Born of Osiris, Veil of Maya, After the Burial, Winds of Plague, Meshuggah, Through the Eyes of the Dead, etc...<br>  So yeah, IMO they're okay, my favorite song by them is Braille.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I actually don't really see much of a connection between TDWPs music and BMTHs. But I definitely know what your saying about them having a lot of the same fans and I am one of them. I love both bands. Hell, they are both in my top 10 bands.<br>  <br>  My favorite Bring Me the Horizon song is probably Off the Heezay. I love that song!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsI1TfuwrXU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsI1Tfuwr...</a>|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	I like both bands. But I’ve only recently started listening to TDWP.<br>  I’ve been listening to BMTH since they first came out with their EP<br>  And nobody knew who they were. Which is kinda weird now….<br>  But yea .<br>  <br>  Song? I like football season is over and medusa the most|`|YwtXSUAdaa	I like them both..... Bring Me the Horizon is definitely not the heaviest I will go though.|`|tKRLTmssaa	I love the devil wears prada<br>  but i don't like bring me the horizon<br>  I like screaming as long as there are clean vocals in it<br>  i lose interest in bands that are just all screaming<br>  i personally can't tell the difference between the chrous and everything else<br>  i dunno maybe i haven't listened to the right bmth song?|`|4HNsOXpvaa	I love Bring Me The Horizon;<br>  I was just listening to them :) haha. They're<br>  pretty amazing, I would have to say. I head bang to them & The Devil Wears Prada in my carrr :)<br>  <br>  My favorite song my BMTH<br>  Is either,<br>  For Stevie Wonders Eyes Only or Re: They Have No Reflections.<br>  <br>  I also like<br>  Chelseas Smile<br>  & <br>  Diamonds Aren't Forever.<br>  Etc.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	I love BMTH.<br>  I never really listened to TDWP much so I don't really have an opinion of them because I don't know what they're really like. My Favourite BMTH song is Diamonds Aren't Forever because it's the first song I ever heard from them and it's the song that got me into them so I love it. & Pray For Plague is awesome too.|`|UAWiu1hUaa	In my opinion BMTH doesnt even compare to how good <br>  The Devil Wears Prada is.<br>  Thats just me.<br>  I Looove TDWP.<br>  <br>  I do like a song or 2 of BMTH but not all that into them.<br>  Diamonds Arent Forever.<br>  <br>  I cant wait to see TDWP again on April 21st In San Fran.<br>  Will youu be there???|`|6LjFeRKoaa	i love bmth!<br>  and tdwp!<br>  <br>  my favorite song is<br>  "diamonds arent forever"<br>  or<br>  "chelsea smile"|`|C33jsdydaa	I heart BMTH<br>  favorite songs, Diamonds Arent Forever and For Stevie Wonders Eyes Only<br>  And i also like TDWP<br>  <br>  Not the heaviest ill go, but i really like them XD|`|wJIm06qHaa	I like TDWP much better.|`|Ft3uhn4paa	both are good<br>  <br>  bmth: pray for plagues|`|xmiv9qJXaa	I love BMTH.  I'm in love with their new cd.   Chelsea Smile is my addiction.   I like TDWP too, but i think i like BMTH more.  it's a close call.<br>  I love Jeremy's vocals for TDWP but i like how Oli sings more than the lead singer of TDWP.|`|aCoWEAjCaa	I know answer of your question|`|65zKevOvaa	BMTH is one of my favourite bands<br>  I like their songs like<br>  Braille (For Stevie Wonders's Eyes only), Play for Plagues, Chelsea Smiles and Medusa.<br>  you should check out their "Suicide Season" Album|`|GPBNuwgZaa	I don't much like those kinds of bands anymore.

12QJ9QMRaa	hmmmm.<br>  <br>  Subpar Music.<br>  <br>  MallMetal Maggot Psycho fans always rammingthem down my throat as if the band was gods gift to metal.<br>  <br>  Their own ego.  By their own words, they are apparently "the Heaviest Band EVER".<br>  <br>  Pointless memebers that contribute little or nothing.<br>  <br>  The stupid outfits.<br>  <br>  The Fans.<br>  <br>  The fact Corey Taylor actually SINGS for stonesour, but sound like rubbish with slipknot.<br>  <br>  Average guitar playing.<br>  <br>  A decent drummer, but if you liten to the amggots, he is the god of all drums.<br>  <br>  the fans.<br>  <br>  They ar ea gimmick that has gotten old.  Shock Metal with no real shock value.<br>  <br>  The Fans.<br>  <br>  In general, there are about 1000 bands htat are far superior to them in every way.  That would not be enough reason to hate them, except for the annoying fans that cant stop thinking they are HArcore TRVE KVLT underground MetalHeads because they listen to Slipknot.<br>  <br>  And of course, the arrogance of the band.<br>  <br>  <br>  and did I mention the fans?|`|FeZR63f8aa	I don't mind Slipknot, I don't know what the problem is, there might be a bad stereotype or vibe associated with them or something.  Or maybe people are sick of everyone liking them?  I don't know.<br>  I don't know much Slipknot though, so I can't say that I'm a fan, but I wouldn't mind being a fan from what I have heard from them.|`|M7E1uIsKaa	I dont hate them.  I just saw them last week in concert. and they were actually pretty good!  They're just not..i guess.. metal enough for me.  I dont really care for nu-metal... I used to listen to them a lot in high school.  I kinda think of them as a band for the younger crowd.  but theyre not all that bad!!<br>  <br>  eh.. I dont like stone sour at all.  I like slipknot WAY more|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Yeah, one of the main things I don't like are the like 2-3 members that don't do anything. Also they have such a hardass attitude but they aren't.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	I don;t hate them...they are just not the greatest band....<br>  <br>  I think they are overrated in many ways...but Corey does have a great voice....<br>  <br>  Listen to<br>  <br>  zzxyz Rd by Stone Sour...imo Corey should stick to stone sour|`|aklHEB3xaa	Slipknot's debut was O.K. nothing groundbreaking, in musical style and in their show, it was just that O.K. Since then they seem like a band lost or one that is trying too hard. StoneSour is pretty vanilla also. But that's just an opinion and we all have them. Try looking into Animal Alpha for some newer metal, they are the most interesting thing I've seen in awhile.|`|AgQForcYaa	9 members--- What the hell do they all do?!?!?<br>  <br>  They sound like crap. <br>  <br>  They're nu-metal. <br>  <br>  Their fans are weeeeeeeeeirdos...<br>  <br>  I don't get the whole "maggot" thing. <br>  <br>  There are tons better bands that pulled off the mask gimmick a lot better.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Dude, I've been trying to figure that out for 3 years XD<br>  <br>  <br>  I will agree with what everyone is saying here about the fans. Most slipknot fans piss me off. But I don't let that get in the way of the music which I like.|`|Zxl8oyIraa	I'm personally a small fan of them (I like about 5-10 of their songs) but im guessing the reason ppl dont lik them is their numbers, the strange content of their songs, or their wierd appearance. yknow, masks?|`|h1yGVkkfaa	For you to think that all these answer are saying they dress funny and have to many people.You obviously didn't READ Killerpeaches answer.|`|CFCvmA3oaa	slipknot is alright|`|65zKevOvaa	I just don't like their costume<br>  thats all|`|Catsy82Caa	i don't have one because i just follow the crowd and assume they suck|`|1vCoaf08aa	I hate them because<br>  <br>  The fans are annoying<br>  9 members, does it take that many to sound like 3 or 4 would?<br>  Stupid masks<br>  Overrated drumming<br>  Annoying vocals

oy2KSYpMaa	well, i have to say that i prefer serj tankian to ozzy osbourne.<br>  and i definitely prefer system of a down to black sabbath.<br>  <br>  dont get me wrong. i love black sabbath. but ive loved system of a down for longer.<br>  <br>  favourite black sabbath songs would have to be "paranoid" and "ironman". <br>  now i know that they are like the most predictable black sabbath songs, but i like them.<br>  <br>  favourite serj tankian songs are "praise the lord and pass the ammunition", "empty walls" and "the unthinking majority". plus he is absolutely amazing live.<br>  <br>  favourite system of a down songs are "chop suey", "vicinity of obscenity" and "byob" [which is awesome on guitar hero].|`|sxeEySH9aa	To me they dont seem like comparable bands.  They arent exactly in the same class, and I don't just mean because Sabbath is clearly in a class of their own.  I just mean it doesn't seem fitting to compare these two bands because they're so different.  There are things about each band respectively that is better than the other and most, out of respect will choose Sabbath because well, they're f-ing sabbath, but I dont see how they are even comparable.|`|uwZ6QasDaa	SOAD FTW!!!!|`|DbtS5jzEaa	I think ozzy and Sabbath epically wipe the floor here|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Iron Man<br>  Needles<br>  <br>  Black Sabbath|`|FeZR63f8aa	Serj over Ozzy and System of a Down over Black Sabbath.<br>  This is personal preference, I know that Ozzy and Black Sabbath are like epic, but I like the others better, though I still do like both Ozzy and Black Sabbath.<br>  <br>  I like "Empty Walls" and "The Unthinking Majority" by Serj (yeah, I know, stereotypical, but I've not heard much yet).<br>  I like "Chop Suey" and "Stealing Society" by System of a Down.<br>  I like "I Don't Wanna Stop" by Ozzy. :P<br>  I like "Paranoid by Black Sabbath (also stereotypical).<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't give ones less known, but I don't know much by Serj, Ozzy, and Black Sabbath, and only have Hypnotize and Mesmerize by System of a Down. I know that doesn't make me much of a fan, but I'm not gonna lie.<br>  -_-|`|2bVxBCgzaa	god, you can't be serious????!?!?!?!?!!??!?!!??!?!???!??!?...<br>  <br>  ozzy is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  serj is awful !!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  ps- happy birthday to Tony Iommi- thanks for that heavy metal thing; you know, the one that saved my life?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!???!!!!!????|`|JqqRFFsyaa	Really, dude?

pmMPjdo0aa	well i realy loved reading that book but from this portion of her website i dont think its likely that House of Scorpion will become a movie : "To Billy:  The publisher has control of the movie rights to House of the Scorpion and doesn’t seem interested in doing much with them.  Apparently there was a movie called “The Island” that was about clones and was a box office dud. This scared off any interest in Hollywood.  Hollywood is all about making money, but film makers make bad decisions all the time.  They ignore good books and ruin some of the ones they do film.  You might want to visit the website Rotten Tomatoes to find reviews of City of Ember, Inkheart, The Golden Compass and the Wizard of Earthsea.  I also think they ruined the second Narnia film.  They get carried away with special effects and forget all about the story.  I suspect that many Hollywood directors have never been children at all, but were hatched from lizard eggs."

HJkfIq8Waa	Belting out is when you sing the high notes wherein the pressure of the air for you to resonate to make a sound is from the diaphragm while in screaming, the pressure is from the throat and that will definitely hurt your throat after singing..<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps ;D|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	belt- To sing in a loud and forceful manner<br>  scream-#  To utter a long loud piercing cry, as from pain or fear.<br>  # To make a loud piercing sound|`|Wm7f02DDaa	Belting is controlled and sounds good mostly singin from your gut

AXcCyoo8aa	First off, yes. And both myself and my best friend (who also watches LOST) are convinced that LOST is not a TV show...it's a RELIGION. Think about it, you can't miss one week otherwise you're pretty much damned, every Wednesday is worship day, you find yourself trying to pick apart the episode to piece together the meaning/significance of certain events....LOL (I'm joking by the way...for the most part ;)  )<br>  <br>  And my favorite characters are Ben (because Is he good or is he bad...I DON"T KNOW!!!!) , Locke (I've always loved Locke and found him way more interesting than Jack right from the start), Daniel (because he's just awesome and is adorable in his awkwardness), Richard Alpert (Because he seems to know everything about EVERYTHING) and Desmond (Because I have a thing for scottish dudes... and he's awesome....and did I mention Scottish???...). Oh, and Hurley. In his I ? my Shih Tzu T-shirt. Throwing a hot pocket. 'Nuff said :)|`|dMBSE8ilaa	Who doesn't?! lol if someone doesn't watch it, then they're crazy!<br>  <br>  Anyways, my fave characters are Miles and Hurley, I like the funny people, lol.And Sawyer! He's funny too.|`|365ffadfb5791af94012e18f6f8d2a42aa	yep of course LOST is the BEST SHOW EVER!! <br>  i like em all but im pretty fond of Desmond and Hurley<br>  Locke is pretty cool too and Faraday is growin on me<br>  if Ben would quite flip floppin from good to bad --but i think no matter what he says he lying --hard to tell somtimes<br>  Sawyers a hottie --Kate is too ! LOL <br>  <br>  : )<br>  Wednesdays episode was CRAZY!! i absolutely LOVE it!! more more more|`|HEs6bzOtaa	I love lost and my favorite character is sayid<br>  <br>  Anyway anyone here a kyle xy fan because if you are<br>  Please go to www.savekylexy.com and press save kyle xy<br>  If you can sign a petition it might not get cancelled <br>  Please help|`|zovrJ0yXaa	desmond and locke. its all about locke. when he does sumthing, we get answers. and lets be honest, we watch lost for answers, not to see some multilcultural soap opera|`|LBovv7Sxaa	Locke<br>  Ben<br>  Richard<br>  Frank Lapidus<br>  Sayid<br>  aaaaaaaaaaaaand JACOB!|`|xbwLbzHqaa	Every week, it the best show ever!! Whoever doesn't watch it is missing out big time. My favorite characters are Sawyer, Jack, Locke and Kate. And in a love to hate him kind of way, Ben.|`|t3zEvX2Gaa	Definitely Sayid bc hes bad a. But I really like Jack. And as odd as it sounds I like Linus. Hes smart and I like it!|`|q59m8G9uaa	Best show on TV!!!<br>  <br>  Favorite charcter are Locke and Sayid<br>  <br>  This season is going great so far!!
8yE2sYGeaa	Play his music. His personal actions do not detract from the music|`|4w9gmvumaa	No, you should play it.  That way your daughter will think it's okay and that Daddy approves.  She'll be sure to bring home a winner like Chris Brown to your doorstep when she starts dating!|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I'm unsure. I mean the kids probably don't really care or know any better so go ahead.<br>  <br>  But I took my songs of him off my iPod.|`|kmwZnASgaa	haha no, the beotch rihanna had it coming<br>  but CB's music sucks, i only listen to him when he does a hook for a bad *** rapper or something, but alone his music is just crap...<br>  <br>  and i agree with the chick who mentioned MJ, i still bump MJ's music cuz its down, but CB is just plain gay =/ lol|`|AA10652430	That child is so oblivious to what is happening. I'd suggest turning her onto a better singer (who's not like Chris Brown).<br>  Maybe Ne-yo. (They sound similar). <br>  Yeah don't play his music.|`|r7bmz65eaa	that's not a true picture<br>  <br>  it's perfectly fine to play his music|`|0792099af4d32f715881d4a39d91aee9aa	I dont see why not. If she knows the situation ask her what she thinks it is HER party lol. I still listen to his music. Things happen and we all move on. If that was the case then we'd stop listening to music period because of all the sh!t the artists have done. lol.|`|gkfX5IQaaa	that's not even Rihanna<br>  and they havent even released any pics of her and they wont<br>  <br>  i dnt think its wrong he's still a musician|`|LId3qnI1aa	Its always wrong to play his music. <br>  <br>  Nothing to do with the incident, his music just sucks.<br>  <br>  <br>  =]|`|zAAeLFLuaa	Dont support him<br>  Well I cant tell you what to do<br>  But I wouldnt<br>  Ive already erased all his music from my ipod<br>  Not that I ever listened to it|`|c573f7ac6e5d1bec7e5fc59b2cf6d1adaa	I believe that's a personal choice.  There's a lot of music artist who's music i'll listen to. I just won't buy it no more.|`|jBM7e88raa	play it if you like it|`|Hjy0qwFPaa	that don't even look like Rhianna at all to be honest|`|I59qE0WNaa	its ok.. nobody knows what REALLY happend.|`|iAuvoQeHaa	I don't like what Amy Winehouse does but I still love her music. I wouldn't give her music to a daughter of mine though.<br>  <br>  It's important not to send kids confused, mixed messages. Isn't there something else that you can play? I think it's really important to teach young girls strength and confidence in themselves and to stand up against this abuse. That's the best gift that you can give her. Have you sat down with her and discussed what has happened? It's just had so much prominence in the media.|`|AVYBazOEaa	Huhhh?<br>  Im sure you can still listen to his music just cuz he did that.<br>  Yes I know he beat Rihanna up and I don't like him for it;- But I still listen to his music.<br>  There's no need to confiscate it all from her just cuz he did that.<br>  Im sure he wont pop out and beat your daughter up so I wouldn't worry.|`|IWFI6ey4aa	people still listen to T.I. after he's been arrested 32 times<br>  <br>  people still listen to Bob Marley after he smoked his brains out<br>  <br>  people still listen to rock bands even though their pants are atrociously tight<br>  <br>  and yes, the other poster commented about michael jackson... need we say more?|`|psvFWDN8aa	That picture was photoshopped, btw.<br>  <br>  Anyways, you should play it.|`|u3mGPBlFaa	don't think so.. just tell your daughter that we all screw up sometimes, (but don't tell her THAT..)|`|ply8AJrcaa	no waay. play it.<br>  look what micheal jackson did, people still play his music.|`|A1DgICqCaa	go for it nobody if that is what you got planned <br>  <br>  <br>  ?dej

1htWVUa9aa	Did the man kill himself because he had been marooned on an island and was told he was eating seagull sandwiches, and so when he was rescued he ordered one and when it tasted nothing like what he had been eating, he realized he had been eating something else the entire time, and it was probably his beloved because he had not heard from her on the island, so he killed himself out of remorse?|`|UtbyRpAhaa	my guess...Did the man kill himself because he accidentally cut himself?...|`|BpRbWoFCaa	wait do you want to know the answer, or do you want to play the game?

dBS6a7nXaa	Book because the movie cut out so much! They had to cram everything into one movie. Edward didn't even say "Do I dazzle you?" !<br>  I hope New Moon will be much better. And it should, too because they changed the director.|`|cI0dF22yaa	Of course the books, the movie wasn't satisfying for me.<br>  It was okay, it's just that they didn't showed the scenes I like.<br>  For example, the chapter of "BLOOD TYPING".|`|iEJTAVP3aa	book<br>  but i read the book before the movie came out<br>  so the book made the movie worse for me, cause it wasnt as good as the book.|`|YSsfesMyaa	I liked the book better, but I also love Robert Pattinson!

E9MF18FRaa	wheelchair because you can have people push you around and get gd service lol :)|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Crutches,  When you fall down down you can get back up without the assistance of azzho passersby who look away as though nothing happened.     My brother was in a wheelchair and people are harsh.    Meg<br>  <br>  <br>  I could use crutches to put a smack down...........Joe|`|VI5nTwwoaa	I hated a wheelie, once I got good on crutches they are not bad.|`|xvT1rqasaa	Wheelchair, because you can wheel everywhere, and crutches hurt.|`|QooHtEC6aa	wheelchair<br>  crutches make your armpits hurt|`|f4ehvRQlaa	i prefer wheelchair or an cane..|`|d4ShTYfXaa	Def. crutches.

paHjJrrdaa	I couldn't agree more! Come on, he's not even that cute!!  And why does he never have his shirt on all the way?  I would SOOOO LOVE it if he and Chloe run away together.  That girl couldn't act to save her life!|`|XRPtuwoTaa	Yup, but it's kind of funny that they've got a male hoe; usually it's a woman.  Dr Dan claims that Chloe's his true love, but didn't he use the same lines on Chelsea?  Kate's a different story - once a hoe, always one|`|AA10411829	I agree. Wish he would get off the show. He's obnoxious and is a womanizer.|`|5tvM9T7vaa	I've always liked Chloe, but never Daniel really.  And he's gotten worse.  I think Kate's s lu ttie r than Chloe, though.

They often get called out on it and people don't help them.  For example I saw one person today give a list of spanish verbs and expressions and wanted to know their answers.<br>  That's kind of a caveat off of your question, but it kind of applies...|`|IHK2suw7aa	I needed to know how to get the cover off my phone.<br>  No one would answer :[<br>  but I went to the mall to one of those guys who sells covers, and he took it off.<br>  Looked like he was going to break my phone.. but what eves. lol.|`|f2fYOlFxaa	The deleted ones....|`|PcbSjpYPaa	I think it's just me but about 1/4 of the questions I asked no one answered...lol!

vSTtAfOWaa	I think it is nice. I like how they are staying true to how they did Twilight's title art. That was pretty cool.<br>  I am looking forward to seeing the wolves! And also seeing who they cast as my favorite character, Seth Clearwater. Did they cast him yet? Also I want to see how powerful the scene where Edward leaves Bella is. I want them to make it really good. Make it painful for the viewer to watch as well. Because when I read it, I was in pain. I want to get the same effect while watching the movie. And also I am looking forward to my favorite part of all in the book, when Alice comes back. I was almost crying tears  of joy while I read that.<br>  I think they picked the perfect Cullens and I love Taylor for Jacob. But I am not happy about the probability of Dakota Fanning as Jane. She is really nice but I really don't think she is a Jane.|`|aZxbMKRCaa	looks fine.<br>  i just cant wait for the whole thing... as much as i cant wait to see it this year, i wish it took a bit longer with more care and a bigger budget...<br>  its going way to fast|`|8lCdutKeaa	I think its just..<br>  Fan Art?<br>  I don't think its the real thing..<br>  not sure,<br>  but anyway..its pretty cool xD<br>  ..

People are in love with the idea of him and associate him with Rob Pattz and he is only an actor and Edward is fiction! So people need to see this and understand that's it just a fantasy and get on with their life! There are much more talented actors out there that Rob Pattz can't compare to such as Heath Ledger and other ones with much more experience.Rob Pattz is a teenage heart throb that will soon be 4 gotten after the Twilight craze blows over.Someone else who's hotter and can act will take his place soon enough.|`|g2JqGIOCaa	Who is Robert Pattinson???????????????????????

Hope that helps.|`|43b5ceb8930fec5387ea5919b6ed23a9aa	nope sadly. :/<br>  it was the episode where micheal's ex-girlfriend, jan has a baby and they throw her a baby shower.|`|rwGTRUj0aa	I have been dissapointed by this season and the last. get back to the funny! how come jim doesn't pull pranks on dwight anymore? its getting too sitcomy and not the show i fell in love with.
YBYJjSQwaa	Slash is top notch to be sure, but you must be too young to really remember THE GREATEST: Mr. Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin.<br>  <br>  Slash grew up on Page and emulates his laid-back don't-care attitude. <br>  <br>  Also, Page had the chops to really stretch his abilities and experimented with sounds and stretched the limits of the guitar itself. <br>  <br>  So, I'll let you have it, since Slash still has years in which to actually become the greatest. But in truth, Jimmy Page still holds this title. Even Slash says so.<br>  <br>  Fun question! Great choice!<br>  <br>  To check out Jimmy's range and skill:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PNsoC1ExU&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PNsoC1E...</a><br>  <br>  To witness Jimmy's absolute cool:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAgz91-MA9s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAgz91-MA...</a><br>  <br>  Hey, just remember that Page created the "I'm too cool to jump around so I will just BE HERE and strut a bit" style and attitude.<br>  <br>  Slash is HOT, no doubt, but don't forget where he picked up his style!<br>  <br>  Thanks! You got me searching all sorts of great guitar solos ans such. I am rocking out and it's your fault!  COOL!!|`|AM33tqYAaa	he is the greatest when it comes to melody, and riffs<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs0C9M5ahvQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs0C9M5ah...</a>|`|9bSCOZB1aa	Sorry man, but I think Hammett, Satriani, Vai, Vaughan, and Clapton have him beat.|`|bWI43goqaa	NO YOU ARENT!!!!!!!!<br>  i think he has TONS of soul and talent, sure eddie is fast but everyone has a different style, youd like the vids on my profile page man!<br>  <br>  <br>  SLASH 4 EVER!!!!!!!|`|bQgOppFsaa	You are entitled to your opinion, but I believe differently!|`|cNtvdDrlaa	Slash and Jerry Cantrell (from Alice in Chains) are probably some of the best from  late 80's/90's rock.|`|DioXrjBIaa	I will always support Eddie Van Halen.... Sorry :]|`|502WrMH8aa	Slash is great but I would have to say Nuno Bettencourt is better.|`|RvnBuOROaa	i saw something about king and hammet and evh and herman li.<br>  theyr not. they dont have much feeling or unique-ness to them.  (theyr TECHNICALLY amazing.  but theirs so much more to good guitar than technique. dont get me wrong i love them all, but if they put more feeling into it, and less crazy shred solo i would like it better)<br>  slash is good, i love the vibe all his stuff has.<br>  id say randy rhoads though, because he had the concept of mixing classical and rock, which was pretty much unheard of at that time.<br>  and that, to me is one of the best ideas ever, because he was good, and EXTREMELY innovative.<br>  <br>  for alive, i'd say either tom morello, prince (hes good, but i dont like his music), or yeah probably slash would be in there.<br>  <br>  but hes nowhere near as amazing as rhoads. nobody is. rhoads was the best.<br>  thats a fact.|`|enuhJDoaaa	Sure, if Kerry King, Kirk Hammet, Dave Mustaine, and Randy Rhodes were dead. I would include Dimebag, but he's dead. =(<br>  <br>  Slash is vastly overrated regardless.|`|yciJslC4aa	Great but not the greatest.<br>  Compare him to: Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Kirk Hammet, Yngwie Malmsteen, Herman Li, Sam Totman <br>  and he probably loses|`|KKlP1Kpoaa	hes great but clapton, hendrix, allman, page, vaughn, all rock harder. but he is not overrated|`|bP58ZLWMaa	Yes|`|WU4MHq3aaa	yep... you are<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: smallfry... Randy Rhoads is dead... RIP|`|DbtS5jzEaa	no there are others like you<br>  <br>  I love Slash but he wasn't the greatest.|`|utTFiz3gaa	i love Slash!<br>  <br>  i am a big fan of his and there's no doubt he is a very good and dynamic/influential guitarist :)<br>  I respect the heck out of him for his work with Guns N Roses at the time.. and i still love him now|`|16t0eV0Uaa	No offense, but he is just a dime a dozen in terms of talent.<br>  <br>  Still I think his work with Guns N Roses, the riffs he wrote are pretty damn good and I feel as if they had to be made.|`|Zxl8oyIraa	hes good, but there are better.<br>  Kirk Hammett<br>  Dimebag Darrel<br>  Tony Iommi<br>  Jimi Hendrix<br>  <br>  I'd prolly place them above slash|`|pNUtnoC8aa	No your not the only one, I for one thank he is overrated. Don't get me wrong Slash is talented and a decent guitarist, I just think there are better from that era.

tYSTd9GIaa	One thing to realize, united kingdom or anywhere, music is affected by the goings on of the time, a reaction if you will to politics, religion, philosophy, etc.  Music and Art many times go hand in hand in that reaction.  If you are talking the last 50 years in the more modern arena of music, then you would almost HAVE to start out with the Beatles as they affectively changed music in the succeeding generations as we knew it.  Perhaps talk about the influx of rock, rock hair, loosening of society moral values and how that all affected the more liberal points of view of today.  One could even infuse the music itself with pictures/art etc on a power point monitor. good luck!|`|CFCvmA3oaa	Um this is just a guess could i had to asnwer i similar questian but anout australia.<br>  <br>  I would say that people would have been influenced by music.

6Fuh3iqIaa	In the manga, Onizuka didn't show any romantic feeling whatsoever to both character. He just treat them like a friend and a student. Nothing more. The anime counterpart hinted about the romance between the character here and there but the manga counterpart showed us that Onizuka is more interested on being a good teacher.<br>  <br>  I would say Onizuka might end up with Azusa because they both enjoy being a teacher. Urumi probably love Onizuka more because of the way she slit her wrist when she know Onizuka was dying but I highly doubt that Onizuka has a feeling for her. Its more like one sided love if you ask me.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Azusa Fuyutsuki is who he has deep feelings for.<br>  <br>  Kanzaki was saved from her destructive ways, but he stills sees her as a student, HIS student, and he never tries to put the make on his students

Jb26nbekaa	Crawl down the center aisle panting "Water...water." Make your way up to the stage and either have someone give you a glass of water, or have one set up there already. Either way, once you get it, pull a comb or brush out of your pocket, dip it in there and comb/brush your hair. If someone handed you the glass of water, say thanks, and crawl away. <br>  <br>  Get a big cardboard box (tv size), and put a couple of bowls filled with warm water inside it. Walk/run/whatever down each aisle, slinging the box back and forth in your arms, or hands. This will cause some of the warm water to splash out of the box corners and all over anyone around you. As you're doing this, scream "Guess what I just got!!!" Once you make your way onto the stage and after you've sprinkled most everyone in the audience, have someone onstage with you ask what you just got. Your simple reply is..."puppies!"<br>  <br>  This one is quick. Get up on stage and say..."All those who believe in telekinesis, raise my hand." Then giggle a little. Then slowly raise your hand, while acting like you don't know what's going on. Then say, "Wow. That was freaky." Or say whatever. Then say to the audience, "Actually I wanted to do something else. I wanted to do a little bit of..umm...something called...umm...it's called...umm" Then have someone in the audience yell out "Mindreading!" Then just say, "Thank you very much...have a great nite."

sFASHCNRaa	1)i'd save the one elderly man because with him living, he would save MILLIONS of people. even though the 100 children are innocent...they cant save millions. what would have made this question better would have been if the elderly man had committed an unspeakable crime in the past.<br>  <br>  <br>  2)i'd give it to the dumbest person because he might stumble upon a smart and kind person who can help him use that info to better mankind. the hitler wannabe would just use it to help himself and hurt others.<br>  <br>  <br>  your teacher is a VERY smart person because this is one of the most interesting assignments ive heard of. i sorta wish my teacher was like this lmao. -___-|`|fY6SFuh9aa	****.|`|BdQbVLk0aa	1) the 100 innocent children... who knows, maybe one of them is going to become a scientist and cure cancer (besides, maybe our science isn't developed enough & we could end up with something that, while it does cure cancer, it could turn us into bloodthirsty zombie things *from the movie: I Am Legend* :P)<br>  <br>  2) first, I'm going to answer your "a) Which option would increase the chance of survival for mankind, and b) which would be better for the WELFARE of the human race. Or are they the same?" questions:<br>  <br>  a) the Hitler-like dude would increase the chance of survival, they may choose only certain people, but they would increase the chances of survival<br>  <br>  b) Giving it to the dumbest person on earth would be better for the welfare of the people. It may be better just to die out instead of living through hell that the Hitler-like person may cause.<br>  <br>  now, to "answer" the question: <br>  - To me, there are a couple of holes in the question: Can we get the information and pass it on through the media or to someone else who can do something about this or etc.? because I'd give up my life to save the human race like that. will the other 2 people die too, upon receiving the data 24 hours prior? or is that only for us? could we tell the dumb person to pass it on to a certain person? There are too many questions for me to be able to answer this, sorry|`|KPLDOfxxaa	1) Elderly Man who know the cure for cancer, because once he will find the cure he will save over 100 peoples life. So it would be silly to save 1000 kids and keep letting people with cancer die.<br>  2) Give it to the really stupid person, he might ask someone smart what it is and that person will do something successful with it.|`|gIitANOkaa	1. 100 innocent children... give them a chance to live life or suffer lol...<br>  <br>  2. dumbest person on earth... just because you're dumb doesn't mean you don't have a heart...<br>  <br>  *<br>  *<br>  *<br>  Dear Y!A sweeties, check out haroldsaenger on Youtube, thanks lots of ???|`|vgcY5jHuaa	1. The elderly man, as he would save thousands more people.<br>  2. The dumb guy. The dictator would abuse the information.|`|TEsS7jq7aa	1. The elderly man...he'll save way more than 100 children.<br>  <br>  2. Dumb...the dumb person still might handle the information correctly. An evil dictator like Hitler would for sure withhold it.|`|INTei8Obaa	1) not save anybody<br>  <br>  2) not giv the vital information 2 anybody and keep it a secret till i die|`|ow1x7fHTaa	h<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApPSgGz4drmOe3CiO1fsHl3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219192940AACPp0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|jqnlyM7vaa	wow. those are hard. :O|`|BeGtptXGaa	My response would be : i don't know. short and concise :)|`|3BfNshHYaa	1) If i didn't know the man would cure cancer i would save the children definitely.  but if i somehow could tell the future magically i would save the man because saving him will create a chain reaction... saving so many more ppl than the 100 kids.<br>  <br>  2)I would give it to the dumb person-as long as they had good values and were a good person in general-and give them SPECIFIC instructions and tell them that the whole world rested on their shoulders, get them worked up and hope it works.  giving it to the dumb person would be taking a chance, but if u gave it to a man like hitler he would be guaranteed to destroy the welfare of the human race<br>  Would u rather have a chance of saving the world, or make it guaranteed that everyone dies?  Me?  id go with a chance|`|c15rWijuaa	1. I would save the elderly man. If he were to cure cancer, not only would this generation be saved, but thousands of others as well. And yes, one of the hundred MAY turn out the cure to cancer or another disease, but it isn't guaranteed. The question says that the man WILL find the cure for cancer. I personally don't like relying on chance. I would still save the man and avoid the "what ifs".<br>  <br>  2. I honestly don't have an interest in the welfare of the human race (specially if I am going to die), so as a last act of spite I would tell the evil dictator... : D Cause I am just mean like that.<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  No, because in the long run, would you not be the cause of the death of millions of others, simply because you let the man that could save them die? Again, the question says that the man WILL find the cure, it says nothing about whether or not the children will do anything beneficial for the world. So it comes down to, do you sacrifice these hundred, for the millions or do you save these hundred and sacrifice the millions? That's basically what it is.|`|ufTjv25Jaa	1) I would definitely save the man with a cure for cancer. One and a half thousand people die from cancer each day (in the US, more in the whole world) and this man could save so many lives by finding the long awaited cure. Yes, these children are innocent and there families would be at a great loss but it is nothing compared to the pain and sufferering that cancer patients and their families go through every day across the globe.<br>  <br>  As for number two, I would say the dumb person. He would be able to find some use for this information, even being as dumb as he is. A Hitler like figure could destroy humanity and the whole world. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.

AIhL8wLkaa	Amy Lee = not attractive, good vocalist<br>  Cristina (not Christina, lol) Scabbia = hot, great vocalist|`|yciJslC4aa	I could see how they make that connection but I agree Christina is hotter. I don't know about way ahead vocally. I think they both have awesome voices. Very clean, very pure. And that is far from a knock on Christina because Amy Lee is far from ugly and has a very good voice. Just my two cents. Probably about all its worth|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Yep.<br>  <br>  I will go with the hotter.<br>  <br>  Vocals I call it a draw.  <br>  <br>  Christina is great, but Amy puts a lot more emotion in her singing than almost anyone.<br>  <br>  Still, I prefer LC to Evanescence.  (though I am a fan of both)|`|JqqRFFsyaa	Uh...I steal KP's answer. He echoes my thoughts perfectly there. But, Angela Gossow can give Cristina a run for her money, beauty wise.

RavvDVpVaa	Pete Rock (Quality wise, he's the best of all time, he can take 10 records put the them on top of each other make them all harmonize and blend them seamlessly to where it just sounds like 1 record)<br>  <br>  DJ Premier (The most consistant of all time, ill kuts and scratches, great ear for samples, he can take a few little tiny pieces of a record that are fractions of a second stretch them, take a little something a turn it into a lot,  make it into something classic, he's the GOAT as far as sequencing goes,)<br>  <br>  Prince Paul (3 feet and rising, de la soul is dead, bulloon mind state, need I say more? Quality!!! With gravediggaz he made a new sub-genre of hip-hop (horrorcore) although no one else did it like Gravediggaz, A prince among theives was the goat hip-hop concept album, he's got so many ideas and he's so creative, beat wise you can never tell when it's a prince paul beat, he doesn't have a set style, all you know it's it's going to be dope)<br>  <br>  Madlib (Very consistant, the best at the moment, dope dirty loops, he's old school with the sp-1200, he won't sacrifice that 12 bit sound of the sp for newer equipment, he finds the most obscure samples that no one else would know what to do with, he does can do all genre's of music, as yesterday's new quintet, he plays all the instruments, samples them and it sounds like a real jazz group)<br>  <br>  J Dilla ( Very unqiue and left feild, not only did he sample but he played instruments, his chop game was nuts, he had some of the dopest most distinct kicks ever, he made his drums off timing to give them a funkier more live feel) <br>  <br>  <br>  Kanye West (Him and Just Blaze are very consistant, the best mainstream producers, they brought sampling back to the mainstream)<br>  <br>  Large Professor (Very funky, he taught DJ Premier how to filter his own basslines, great ear for samples, Paul C and him ghost produced Erik B & Rakim's let the rythem hit em', he introduced Pete Rock to Tom Scott's the honeysuckle breeze (the record he used for TROY), <br>  <br>  Rza ( Other than OB4CL & LS, Most of his success was because of the emcee's he worked with rather than the quality of his beats, look at ODB's first LP, it sounded like someone just randomly pointed at some records and said "hey loop that **** up", people liked it because of ODB, not the beats<br>  <br>  Dr. Dre (he hasn't produced an album on his own since The Chronic, he took all the credit for the production on doggystyle even though, Daz and Warren G did a lot of the beats)<br>  <br>  9th Wonder (uses the same drum loops all time, and it gets very repetitive, he was good from 02-05)|`|DDmFQU7raa	Wow!

I don't really know what it is that makes me enjoy them and look forward to them so much, but I do. Perhaps it is just the fact that so much drama happens in hospitals on a daily basis. I have to say that I believe hospital scenes host the best acting by individuals; normally, in accidents, the actors go crazy with emotion. Some of that stuff is unbeatable; others are horrible. So, I guess it takes some to loose some. My favorite soap, ATWT, has quite a few hospital scenes, a couple times a week, and I really enjoy seeing them bringing actual illness and treatment into soaps as well.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Not really, they can sometimes be very awkwardly done. i esp hate seeing one doctor who is a specialist in say...the heart and had a major story line w/someones heart surgery all the sudden consulting on a case that involves a head injury, it's stupid. for instance DOOL- Dr. Jonas was brought on as this big wig doc w/expertise in (what was it? the pancreas?) transplants but now all the sudden he's a cancer specialist, an OB/Gyn,  a brain surgeon, and emergency trauma room doc!...ummm confused much?<br>  they act as if this is a small time doc in a clinic not a big time doc in a large hospital. lol|`|WyxxDgSeaa	Not really.  The regular stuff like having a baby is ok. But, for instance, Days of Our Lives has trivialized everything from loss of a limb to cancer.

Not fair, I know.|`|8JYe6IRfaa	"Always" is waaaay too strong a word. "Sometimes" is more appropriate. Sounds like you're hurtin'. Relationships aren't meant to be from time to time...be they friendships, lovers, colleagues, even family. <br>  <br>  Why?

Look below for more information..<br>  <br>  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.<br>  <br>   Today, Macs use the same hardware as PCs. Why spend extra to get the same CPU chips, graphics cards  and OS X isn't as secure as you think.. Look below.<br>  <br>  WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:<br>  <br>  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows.

This is not legal and I would not recommend it for security and legal reasons, the purpose is to show that there is nothing special about the MAC.<br>  <br>  A)Price...<br>  A similar equipped PC is much cheaper to purchase than Mac. Lets use Dell (but you can compare with another PC Brand if you like)<br>  <br>  **(LAPTOP)<br>  Dell Inspiron Laptop $849 dropped to $799<br>  15" Screen<br>  CPU: (upgrade to) 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100<br>  Memory: 3GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM<br>  Hard Drive: 320GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm<br>  Optical Drive: Blu-ray Disc Combo (DVD+/-RW + BD-ROM) - WRITES DVDS,CDS, READS Blue-Ray Disks<br>  <br>  Macbook $1349 just dropped to $1224<br>  13" Screen (SMALLER)<br>  CPU: 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (SAME)<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 (SAME)<br>  Memory: (upgrade to) 2GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM (LESS RAM)<br>  Hard Drive (upgrade to) 250GBSerial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm (SMALLER HARD DRIVE)<br>  Optical Drive: (DVD-ROM/CD-RW) - (Writes CDs, DVDs, cannot read Blue-Ray) (WORSE AND 1/2 SPEED)<br>  <br>  **(DESKTOP)<br>  <br>  PLEASE NOTE: I'm comparing Apple Mac's vs Dells best deal. If you decide that you must have an all-in one. The Dell all-in-one has more ram, wireless keyboard and mouse and equivalent to $400 for free making the Imac still more expensive when you upgrade the Imac to try to match. Personally I don't think the All-in-Ones are a good choice, and consider them overpriced, lack expandability and repairs both more expensive and require the entire computer.<br>  <br>  PS: Apple knows that they must make Macintosh look different than PC so all Macs except the Mac Pro will not have a tower option. Apple's low end lacks expandability but it makes the Mac "look different", if Mac had a tower for low-end, more people would realize the similarities between the two.<br>  <br>  Dell: (Right Now) Specs Below costs $809<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ Dell Inspiron QUAD (4 Processor) CORE<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: 3GB Ram<br>  HARD DRIVE: 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 16x DVD/CD Read/Writer<br>  GRAPHICS: (upgrade to ) ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  The Best Deal Mac is not the Mac Mini since it has no monitor, keyboard, mouse, very skimpy on options and setup... IMac is better price than the Mac Mini.<br>  <br>  IMac ($1400)<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ DUAL (2 Processor) CORE (SLOWER CPU)<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: (upgrade to) 2GB Ram (LESS RAM)<br>  HARD DRIVE: (upgrade to ) 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 8x DVD Reader/Writer (1/2 speed)<br>  GRAPHICS: ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  **END OF DESKTOP<br>  <br>  B) SECURITY:<br>  <br>  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.<br>  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.<br>  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.<br>  <br>  C) VIRUSES<br>  <br>  The argument that OS X has less viruses is true,  but that is against XP, BUT Mac OS X has viruses (which is significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".<br>  Viruses on Mac are rising significantly.<br>  <br>  Google/Yahoo Mac Viruses<br>  <br>  <br>  D) WINDOWS LICENSE is discounted with PCs<br>  <br>  You do not pay the full price, for instance Dell -> you pay $50 or less for Vista Home Premium If you buy a Mac and want Vista, you pay full price.<br>  <br>  <br>  E) EXPANDABILITY & REPAIR...<br>  <br>  Repairs are more expensive than PCs since the IMac, Mac Mini are compact units, and Apple charges a premium for their services. Some repairs can be done by another repair service but the compact design of the computer causes problems.<br>  With an IMac, if the problem is with the monitor, the whole computer would have to be brought in.<br>  IMac and Mac mini lack expansion.<br>  <br>  <br>  F) PROBLEMS<br>  <br>  Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-quality-dwindling-my-macbook-pro-sob-story/"

better|`|0NzcNoL6aa	none<br>  pc<br>  mac's are ugly|`|3TlCF4Qvaa	Just adding to the previous person's post.The White MacBook is now $999, instead of the $12xx he said.?That makes it more afofrdable.The White macbook, and the Unibody macbooks, also have a way better nvidia graphics card than the Dell, it is about 5x as fast.<br>  Whether which one is better, it just depends on your prefrence.Most professional photographers use Mac OS, becuase it is a great OS to run your programs.<br>  I own 2 laptop PCs, a Black MacBook, and a HP DV9000 with Blu-Ray, and a 2.8Ghz Centrino 2 Duo CPU,<br>  The MacBook and HP were the same price, and to tell the truth, i like the MacBook better, becuase it gets around 5 hours of battery life, when the most i can get out of my HP is 2-3.Meanwhile, The HP has a dedicated graphics card, and the MacBook has a shared one.<br>  If i were to do some advanced gaming, with a high graphics game, the HP would be better, yet the MacBook is still able to run things like call of duty 4.With the new MacBooks, gaming is actully good, just make sure the one you buy has an Nvidia graphics card in it.<br>  Now, about the Mac OS being hacked in 2 minutes blah blah blah....apparently they were using an old, unupdated version, while Vista had a full, totally updated, and as such, was better at combating viruses, and hackers.Also about the iSight camera built into macs./I have never heard of a case in which this has been done, and the camera can be a great asset, and plus, most notebook windows computers these days have one too.<br>  like i said before, it depends on what you are planning to do with it.<br>  If you want a stable OS, that is great for Photoshop, internet browsing, typing in microsoft office, or any other thing, Go for the mac.<br>  If you plan on doing some serioujs gaming, with games that have an extreme reqirement, buy the PC, although you might want to fid one with a better graphics card, if you are gaming.<br>  One more thing about the mac...<br>  IF it breaks, you can just take it to your nearest Apple sotre, and thell tell you whats wrong, and attempt to fix it.Where else can you do this with a windows computer without sending it in to the manufacturer.<br>  Thats just my two cents, and thank you for looking at my opionion|`|7zItsd96aa	definitely black one!<br>  <br>  <br>  brown one looks

dnpB79V1aa	Pretty well. Knowing oneself is a journey that never ends, because as we live we are changing, even when we don't notice. <br>  <br>  But I think I've maneged to get to know myself...<br>  <br>  She’s a complicated girl, yet very simple. She’s like so many others, sill none is like her. Her life is full of contradictions, but she understands all very well. She’s the type of girl that is with people all along, but they never really notice her, they never quite remember her, and very few know who she truly is. <br>  <br>  She likes to think a lot. She can spend hours just thinking; and she can be days, or even weeks thinking about the same thing. She thinks, thinks and thinks. She likes to see meaning in things, and even though she can accept that some things happen just because, see insist in finding deep meaning in stuff. She thinks about right and wrong, the things that should be, and the things that shouldn’t, and she likes to think about the how things are and why. She believes she understands the world, and she even though she does, she hasn’t grasped completely all that implies. She’s very innocent and na?ve. She knows about the world, but she lives in her own little world, full of love and beautiful ideas. She’s sometimes shocked to find realities very different to hers, where love does not reign.<br>  <br>  And that's just an intro to myself. =)|`|dd28c22317b4d1a575582b739470bc71aa	I would know myself as follows:<br>  <br>  1.

p0D4dxEqaa	Rappers are parasites, they have no musical talent, so they use other peoples songs.|`|YB9hxefFaa	they throw something familiar in there so people can identify with it. I agree with you. I think some selected few have talent, it's just not my thing.|`|IeH4C24Daa	its not that there "rippin off" of the people as you say. they just probably feel as if they can relate to the storys of the people from the songs so they place the lyrics in there to make the story from there perspective. and your not going to just let a good song idea pass you by so they do what they have to do. but no reason to say there haters or anything thats just immature. all music genres whether its rap, heavy metal, country, techno whatever it is, they are all talented and they work hard for what they do to please people, you know?|`|8b737d89865a513d3f8c17d297426433aa	because they have no sense of originality..they rip other musicians because they think they can do much better than the original...in their minds they think they are improving the songs but actually they aren't..they are egotistical but not all of them because the original artist/s actually let them rip their music off...and in that case the word is not "rip off"...|`|VTGm3UNBaa	There are great rappers out there. They truly embody the essence of what rap was created to be. And then there are untalented musicians who cannot make up their own songs. I feel your pain. I have trouble finding my songs too through the sea of rap. I think that the genre needs a revamping. Some super talented rapper needs to come and show everyone how to do it. Then maybe the trend will change<br>  <br>  "hip hop is the movement dat'll never die..<br>  <br>  no other coutry, rock, wtever u dumb ppl listen to<br>  sold a million copies like lil wayne in 2008 ..<br>  ya digg" - Stunna <br>  <br>  It dies with your literacy. How can you possibly begin to call us "dumb" when you cannot even spell.  <br>  <br>  As to the best selling album thing. <br>  <a href="http://digitaldreamdoor.nutsie.com/pages/best_sold_albums.html" rel="nofollow">http://digitaldreamdoor.nutsie.com/pages...</a><br>  Apperantly a lot of rock, country, and everything else, has sold over a million copies.  In fact I don't even see lil wayne on that list of best selling albums. Must be because the lowest is 7 million. He missed it by a bit. <br>  <br>  Don't be fooled into thinking your genre is the only genre. Don't be a bigot. You're only making yourself look less intelligent and lowering other peoples opinions of people who listen to rap.|`|wPNtVytKaa	As I understand it, calling it "Sampling" obliterates all copyright infringements. <br>  Long Live Vanilla Ice!

So all you have to do is practice.|`|f4ehvRQlaa	normal. but i never met an guy that blushes when he talks to a girl. i bet you're cute. even though im a bisexual boy.  :-)<br>  <br>  but i dont blush. lol|`|VqFzDnvOaa	aw that's not weird. i'm sure it doesn't happen when you're around girls you know well? i get shy too, it's okay :)|`|YzCTq13caa	Sex=boost in confidence and smoothness.|`|uK8QFrziaa	haha its cute! you dont have to get rid of it! besides i dont think you can anyways. i would prefer a guy who blushes when he talks to me over a guy who pretends to pay no attention to me! its funny cause they think they r being cool and attrative but really its about as dorky as it gets. just sayin :)|`|gIitANOkaa	Don't change... girls love it... they think it's cute...<br>  <br>  *<br>  *<br>  *<br>  Dear Y!A sweeties, check out haroldsaenger on Youtube, thanks lots of ???|`|BE0zSvlkaa	pretend the girl is a guy? lol, but i actually like it when guys talk to me like they would talk to their other guy friends it makes me more comfortable idk why...|`|7zItsd96aa	some girls will find it cute that you get all nervous and start to blush :)<br>  embrace it|`|phDTu7c1aa	No. You'll grow out of it once you get out a little more.|`|W2mVRIIzaa	aww blushing is always cute..especially wen guys do it.. maks the girls smile xP so appreciate it lol|`|wLLvYW95aa	talk to more girls. it sounds silly but trust me|`|2Hd2lNxwaa	aaaaaaawwwww....i wanna give u a hug :)|`|abtseeqbaa	firstly i would like to say that remove the word 4m ur mind that u feel blush when u talk to someone becoz basically this kind of words remains in our mind n we think in a blush manner becoz in prior we had think in that manner thats why , so just remove the difficuities 4m ur mind when u r close to someone n share the feelings whatever u possess to have n dont think that wat will be the effect on that person.<br>  okay so just go through it n i hope really ur attitude will change if u follow the instrutions prior ,|`|IegOHQXOaa	awwwe that's adorable and no it's not weird at all. Plenty of guys and girls still get flustered when talking to a possible love interest. I know I do! I'm sure the only way to "get rid" of that behavior is just to let loose, don't think you're being judged and just be comfortable with yourself. <br>  <br>  But as girls above have mentioned, it's cute it won't bring you down.|`|37237eb344fb20d6e5cc90ea130bd1e8aa	I'm sorry I'm a guy and I couldn't help but to answer ur question.. Dude... 1stable why are u asking a girl? You should ask us guys how to control that lol. I don't think there is a logical way to do that. Just be you I guess. I know girls like it when we are ourselves and we don't try TOO Hard. Make sure to breath in and out. Idk dude... experience I guess. Lol|`|lALZajnMaa	awwww how cute is that?! lol xD<br>  you're only 20. its okay.<br>  i have a lot of 20 year old friends who blush still [:<br>  and my dad still blushes too =P LOL|`|5OORL0IWaa	its cute i think ummmm smoke weed u will be more relaxed

Not every guys fantasy when they are clawing and pulling each other's hair out. Those fights are far nastier than when  guys fight because they don't have the physical strength and they don't break and separate when told to. We almost had our principal involved with one. Girls are much more emotional and will use tooth and nail for their advantage. I would much rather get between two guys fighting. I know what to expect. Guys  throw a punch or two and when told to stop,  they do.|`|1f140d50ba658a4e56492c81dcafaf32aa	lets put it this way, if you get stuck in the middle of a guy fight, you could be pushed into the other person but you will most likely just get shoved to the side.  getting stuck in the middle of a girl fight, more damage could be done to you than the two girls in the fight combined|`|McfrauFnaa	only if they start to use other objects in the fight. otherwise, just let it happen. it's extremely entetaining though. i could watch that all day, lol|`|GO0FqfOIaa	If you are a guy no. but any one else yer. why not? But if the chick is getting the $hit bashed out of her, i would say jump in! or stop it. :] what ever floats your boat. :]|`|NIYYN6tpaa	You should see my YouTube black girl fight..........It shows to black girls fighting and other girls filming it like me and guys just standing around doing nothing so I guess not unless that just a black thing|`|7nDpz7vyaa	No way, are you crazy?

She has a first amendment right to say it, even if it isn't nice.|`|A7niY1pDaa	Ask her to give me some of whatever she's on...cause I'll love to have an affair with Marilyn Monroe. jijijiji.. just kidding. she won't do anything. statistically speaking only 0.34% of people who publicly threat celebrities really go about and do it. The facts point toward persons who don't make their threats public. They just do it.|`|6Iqh6ReMaa	Just let the pathetic woman ramble. She probably has no intentions of actually kidnnapping his daughter. It's the internet, people make things up and act stupid all the time just for kicks usually. I don't think you should worry about it :)|`|x7vB4P5Naa	hhmmm....well, it is just a comment, but I guess if she started stalking or doing sick things like that, then that would be a warning sign.
6pk6HnuSaa	neither phases me at all ?<br>  <br>  ignorant, intolerant people are not my problem|`|xxSGhywoaa	Neither, I'm not a pussyfoot|`|uiKAI8bWaa	They would both make me laugh.<br>  However I am white & macho so I know nothing about it I guess.<br>  Both sound scary really.<br>  To hear someone use racist comments to others makes me angry if I can do something about it & sad if I can't.<br>  I rarely stand by is someone is being called any name.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VOelicUauU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VOelicUa...</a>|`|c3MFIbeUaa	Racist comment a it shows a lack of intelligence and indifference in helping to solve the worst injustice known to man. Hatred for another because of the color of their skin and not their heart.<br>   My sex life is none of their business and i know they speak out to try to egg me on to their low level.<br>   I am not a homosexual but i can  for the most part be a happy individual in my life.<br>   I suggest they learn the meaning of Gay and not just the slang version. It shows their educational level.<br>   I try not to allow someone to belittle myself but a racist comment belittles us all.|`|vMeSBnE1aa	the racist comment, but i can tolerate it though coz of the stupidity that comes with it<br>  <br>  the gay thing would be funny coz i really look and act straight.|`|grifjdr0aa	really, neither, I'm pretty thick-skinned.

Racism stinks.|`|4nQVsEHnaa	probably the racist remark|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	I dont let either bother me..|`|RQfLKOPQaa	People wouldn't say anything like that to me. Not to my face anyway. In any case I have a thick skin, stuff like that doesn't make me angry. If I had to chose one I would go with the racist remark. It would probably offend me more. As for someone calling me gay, either I am or I'm not. I don't think it's an insult.|`|SUG8wXmUaa	racist comment|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Actually,weirdly enough,none.<br>  Thinking about it,it might be the racist comment,but when it will happen in real life,even though I get mad all the time over the stupidest things,thinking about what would make me more mad,I would have to say none.|`|AA11536708	They can call me gay all day long.  It doesn't mean that I am, but who cares?  Racism would not be tolerated.  Being called gay is like being called white...who cares?  You either are or you aren't...but a racist comment is like being called "white trash."  That is MEANT to hurt.|`|SIqFa1mzaa	The racist remark probably.  <br>  <br>  I've experienced both though and they both made me angry/sad.  The gay comment shouldn't even bother me, but anything that's meant to put me down is hurtful.|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	calling me a racist remark|`|uIIvMi68aa	neither would make me mad.I know im not gay and racist comments dont effect me.I just laugh at who ever does either one because when they realize I dont care, it would piss them off even more.So I win.|`|Tj2xROpwaa	hmm. since i am white probably someone calling me gay. i don't have anything against gay people in fact i love them but i could never be gay.|`|2qW1Q9fZaa	the ssecond one definitelyyy!|`|wFsqpdN9aa	Racists..

I believe people are entitled to their own opinions about me, but that doesn't mean i have to care. I have more important problems to solve than some idiot making a racist comment or calling me gay.  Besides, i find it amusing when somebody says something like that and you just kind of shrug. It leaves them kind of shocked, which is very amusing.  Not to mention, if you get angry, then they will have won.  They will successfully caused you to lose control of your maturity and emotions, because of them.|`|HQqM89Kuaa	IWouldn'tReallyCareEitherWay...<br>  ButIThinkARasistCommentIsWouldBeMore<br>  Hurtful.|`|Mq9GSSHhaa	Neither would make me really upset. I'm white and straight and I'm cool with gays and other races. So it wouldn't bother me if someone made a racist comment about me. It does however, bother me when people make gay jokes and racist comments about other people. That REALLY bothers me.|`|0BJWUl5raa	racist.|`|gIVCTObMaa	racist|`|jki8W5khaa	racist|`|7zItsd96aa	hmm..depends on who says it<br>  <br>  if its a total random..it wouldnt bug me..cuz tht person cleary doesnt know me .so it would be quite pointless to get angry or offended and even if it was someone that i knew...very well or not...i wouldn't per se be mad at them calling me gay or passing a racist comment to me..id be more disappointed in them for sinking that low in life that they need to make such comments lol|`|km6rtHPpaa	racist comment|`|h2i92yA7aa	probably the racist. I abhor any kind of intolerance.<br>  plus, I could care less if people think I'm gay.|`|cxKR99KIaa	someone passing a racist comment on you|`|ply8AJrcaa	a racist comment|`|QOlZ9qv0aa	It  would  be  harder  to  disprove  a  racist  comment  the  a  gay comment  so  I  vote  racist.|`|svSlfTduaa	Racist comment... duh!<br>  <br>  The homosexuality accusations FLY at my school - it's all in good humour. But racism?<br>  <br>  ><|`|iygl6BlLaa	I think the gay comment would make me more angry, but I don't really like what this says about me... hmmmm. Something to think about, I guess.|`|37237eb344fb20d6e5cc90ea130bd1e8aa	some passing a racist comment on me.<br>  <br>  I'm not gay but I'm mexican after all lol.|`|G2OdDlmjaa	if someone said something racist at me i will throw one right back<br>  but racist will do the trick|`|MWrwnHM2aa	Someone saying a racist remark on me.<br>  :)|`|5OORL0IWaa	Id have to go with n either you know what they say....."Im RUBBER AND YOU"RE GLUE WHATEVER YOU SAY BOUNCES OFF OF ME AND STICKS BACK TO YOU."|`|a5KpcodFaa	Neither just consider the source and move on, it takes all kinds for the world to move around.

2a9jRZGRaa	Rolls Royce<br>  <br>  A blonde walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer. She says she's going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce. The car is parked on the street in front of the bank, she has the title and everything checks out. The bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the blonde for using a $250,000 Rolls as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An employee of the bank then proceeds to drive the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there.<br>  Two weeks later, the blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, "Miss, we are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. What puzzles us is, why would you bother to borrow $5,000?" The blond replies......................"Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"

AA12390047	I wish I owned the DNA lab in Llanview and got paid everytime some one needed testing.<br>  Rex will be David's son and David will be Bo's son.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	that's a twist I never even thought of,,how interesting would THAT be! And what a wrench in would throw in the works as it is now,,I say bring it on  LOL|`|rFZtQuV2aa	Maybe David is Bo's son and Rex is David's son.  Case closed.|`|EQP8VZwiaa	Good point. The DNA test will prove David's a Buchanan but they'll never know for sure who his father is.|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	It really depends on when Emma conceived.  I was thinking that, too ... if Emma got pregnant after Rex/Bo slept with her, then of course David is Bo's first-born!  But if she conceived sometime after Bo and Rex returned to 2008 - after she had slept with Asa again - then Asa is the Proud Pappy!<br>  <br>  I was also thinking of how David started losing his reflection in the present ... evidence that his existence was in jeopardy?  Maybe Rex/Bo sleeping with Emma assured his existence ... or - again - maybe it was when the real Asa slept with her.  And ... could his conversion to Buddhism have been sort of a direct result of the changes his body was going through?<br>  <br>  Anyways ... either way, I think that all the tests would prove is that he is a Buchanan.  If they're not doing any extensive tests, it will only prove that he is related to Asa, Bo and Clint.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't mind them going 'round and 'round on THAT one for a while (power-hungry Clint and self-righteous Nora need to stew in their own discomfort for once) ... if not for the fact that evil-a$$ Dorian - the original Evil Evelyn - will be profiting from her spoils and destruction!|`|AA11202477	I've been watching this show so long that nothing surprises me anymore. I've watched Clint go back in time and almost marry Vicki's grandmother; they went to a hidden city called Eterna; after 30 years Victor Lord wasn't dead, yada yada yada. So it wouldn't surprise me if David turned out to be Bo's son, and Bo turned out to be David's son at the same time. Wasn't watching during the time travel thing this time, but believe me - if it can be bizarre, they'll take it there.|`|w2pctbRWaa	I read spoilers on this web site & they r pretty accurate.  Here is what it says bout David's paternity:  <br>  <br>  Although a first DNA test will show David as Rex's father, the next one will show that he isn't - and that Bo is David's father! Remnants from the 1968 storyline? Stay tuned! <br>  <br>  This website is usually updated every 2 days.  Enjoy! =)|`|ADBMrG87aa	Excellent point!  The dna test will probably prove that David's a Buchanan but the test probably won't narrow it down to whether he's Asa's son unless they match against Asa's dna and so far them Buchanans aren't bright enough to think about that.|`|dbKj55akaa	Well in the spoilers/ previews for next week it did talk about the DNA results not being what was expected. I have been wondering about that as well.  I just hope it ends well for David and Dorian.|`|mIUjnujeaa	I thought the same thing while the flashback thing was happening. I thought it would be great as hell to see the look on dame dorian's face!|`|XRPtuwoTaa	excellent reasoning.  Maybe Rex's DNA will match the Buchanans since he was Bo in the 60s - that would be a funny twist|`|Agw4pXAnaa	Good point, LOL.  That whole story line there was a little nuts.|`|DfbR2Traaa	You really know your soaps!  that sounds pretty good to me if i think about it also.  thanks|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	yea i was kinda wondering the same thing. but do Rex Bo and Gigi even remember the time travel thing? dont they think its a dream? so if sokme how it does say David is Bo's son Bo is gonna wonder how since he thinks that he never slept with Emma. im so curiious to see how this storyline will play out.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	That is what I think might happen as well! I hope they distinguish that he is Bo's and not just a Buchanan.Because that will make all the difference in the inheritance. If he is Bo's he gets nothing!
XRPtuwoTaa	supposedly Thomas Edward Cramer ran away & wasn't ever w/ Lexie.

I think he ran off to give her her life back with Ab and her son.  Right?  It was so long ago, I could be wrong.

Its impossible for them to have the same exact personalities just because they are identical.|`|fLigyqHeaa	it's not the face... it's the feeling that gets ignited... you'll just know, if it's really love... you'll only ask if you're not sure... say, it's just infatuation or something like that...|`|p8q5o6x5aa	I believe a person in love would know coz they have a different kind of connection so that even if it is an identical twin you would be more inclined to approach the person you are connected with.
96qC7bY2aa	It's just kind of meh.  It was good enough to watch once, but I probably wouldn't watch it again.  At least it had its unintentionally funny moments.|`|Wxx9JZWJaa	It was pretty terrible.  It was actually so bad that it was funny and once you watch it, you'll see what I mean.  The story has a little potential, but the way it is carried out is stupid and the acting is generally bad.  To quote someone else in the movie theater I saw this film in: "Well, there's two hours of my life I won't get back."  You might laugh, but it pretty much goes along with other recent horror films...if it's not worse.|`|dQKrrdyuaa	samee. it was just like ok, in my thoughts u may love it. who knows, if you have it watch it.

I KNOWWWW!!! i was soooo pissed off to hear they won... cuz i seriously thought they'd be gone by now >=( Strikers had waaaay more better performances in the past and its pretty obvious america wants FK gone after bein on the bottom for sooo long. FK are there just cuz they're eye candy for Shane and JC...its ridiculous. It sux to even think they mite end up being in the finals bcuz of wut ABDC has done the past 2 seasons by preventing two crews from the same region going against each other. And since BF and Quest are both in the west coast, there's a chance MTV's gona be retarded and make one of them go. This show is sooo rigged it pisses me off...Hopefully the finals are Beat Freaks and Quest!!! (i like both, so im rootin for both lol)|`|4EaPygCuaa	stop hating on Fly Khicks. The reason Strikers went home was because they gave their worst performance of the season that night while Fly Khicks gave their best. Whatever happened on the previous episodes doesn't matter, the judges base the elimination off of the performances of that episode. Going in to it Strikers were at a disadvantage having to dance to Pose which isnt a popular song and having to break. It doesn't help that Mike (the guy in the middle) got really lost too.|`|PHCvBIhBaa	Believe me, I said the exact same thing.  As soon as I heard, I texted my sister "WTF" and she texted at the same time "WHAT?" We can NOT understand why the judges would keep them in.  My sister said it perfectly with "when dance crews do stuff that everyone and their sister can do that's lame"  Honestly, I don't see Fly Khicks do anything that a lot of girls can do, and to say they are on the same level as Beat Freaks or Quest Crew?!?!  Utterly shocking..  I raelly liked Team Millinia, was really sad when they got booted.  I think the only reason they stick around is that Shane Sparks gets turned on by all the "sexy dancing".  The judges better get rid of Fly Khicks next week.  I'm torn as to who I want to see win, but I'm going to go with Quest Crew.|`|43f2065c02647908da40c12f178ef19caa	I totally agree!!|`|JPeF814Caa	yah... sadly saying that sex does sell.<br>  <br>  <br>  beat freaks ftw!|`|l1vzoQ1uaa	i know right !? -.-|`|yD5pz3Cnaa	totally agree with you.<br>  If Strikers All Stars hadn't messed up, I'm sure they would've stayed on.|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	I thought for sure they'd be out this week. Hopefully it'll come down to Quest and Beat Freaks, though. But if it doesn't and somehow Fly Khicks manage to knock out Quest, I'd love to see Fly Khicks go up against Beat Freaks in an all out chick fight. They'd most likely get their butts kicked because they're no where near Beat Freaks.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	Fly Khicks had a good performance, but I wish Strikers All Stars made it through.

KTg4Gl1faa	No decision has been made but it doesn't look good.<br>  <br>  1.  Main cast have commented they are ready to move on and were relunctant to sign on to the current year.  Some have already left.<br>  <br>  2.  Ratings and show standing have been falling every year, this year is no exception.  The longer a show is on the air, the more expensive it is to make.  Falling ratings and increase cost reduce profitability.<br>  <br>  3.  The CW did look into making a show about Robin (from Batman) in his pre-Batman years.  Public feedback was so negative the project was killed within days.  So there are no similar shows in line to replace it.  But that doesn't mean they won't end it.|`|XBGaYJ2waa	I don't think anyone knows for sure yet, last I heard was it depended on Tom Welling and whether he wanted to do another season. I hope there's another season too.|`|U3KAgO0baa	From what i hear the CW is working on a show based on the Comic Character Robin (from batman and robin) and if they choose 2 green light that show it will be the end of smallville...<br>  Sorry...

18RphOP6aa	It's his opinion....people don't have to like the same movies or books as everyone else.<br>  What gets me is people who don't watch a movie because of what someone says or because there is alot of hype around it and they have to be individuals. I learned not to listen to what people say about movies....there's something about mary for example was supposed to be a great movie...please it was terrible<br>  Just ignore what he says and if you want to watch Twilight then watch it.|`|w2lRPkYiaa	because, its a bad movie and frankly, its a bad book.|`|RcBkUBsfaa	make him watch it!!!!!!!!|`|YCcZleIKaa	I did watch it and wish I wouldn't have. Totally ruined the books.....|`|MpFAiatIaa	Are we still debating about this? I think it was a good movie and a good book.  You just have to have an imagination.  What about Harry Potter? That has some "unbelievable stuff" in there...why aren't people hating that? I just think we should stop arguing over Twilight being a good book or not.  We all have our own opinion about everything and no one can't really change that so go ahead and make your comment and then move on.|`|fF98hm8xaa	Woahhhh, there are entirely too many Twilight haters out there! I personally LOVED the movie and can't wait to read the book.

I would say your maybe 13-15 years old so you're forgiven but don't say such ridiculous things like that, it's embarrassing.|`|gCTbN4Jbaa	Books....Amazing.<br>  <br>  Movie...not so great.<br>  but i don't fret, because this will be the weaker out of the 4.

(yupiiiii)....pero que recuerde son los mismos personajes mueren unos como Charlie ( a como llore)...Mrs. ecko..aparecen como Desmond con super visiones futuristas(no estaba muerto andaba de parranda jajajaja)... Como el papa de locke (en la isla), o Jacob (el due?o de toda la Isla inmortal)<br>  y luego que si Claire y JAck son hermanos, y luego que le Ben esta enfermo tiene cancer y lo tienen que operar Jack...hablando de Ben es un desquisiado..su papa era de la limpieza de Dharma y el su hijo....y mato a todos con la alinza de los otros "inmortales"<br>  <br>  y luego que el barco que llego que no era de la penny, pues quien sabe quien saco a Jack y Kate, eso si pobre Jack todo demente drogo y eso si kate no le quiere ni hablar, esta afuera queriendo ir otra vez a la isla a rescatar a los demas, ni modo no le quisieron hacer caso a Locke.....creo que son 23 episodios..<br>  <br>  y luego que el accidente del avion lo provoca Desmond...con el pulso electromagnetico de no querer seguir aplastando los numeritos la primera vez...<br>  lo que si esta bien de risa es que Hurley es millonario vd?<br>  y la juliet y el jack se gustan...iuuu...no quiero que se queden juntos..<br>  <br>  Lugo la hija del Ben y la Rousseau estan igualitas...parecen clon<br>  <br>  A y por cierto no estan en el purgatorio!, aunque no acabo de entender que es el humo negro..nanobots?? es la MUERTE indudablemente, pero y...que mas, si alguien sabe expliqueme..o el inconsiente..culpa<br>  <br>  Chistoso no??|`|1Xt9lXONaa	los que están filmándolos también están perdidos|`|8YHs2SVzaa	wow, cuanta materia gris no...<br>  <br>  pero la verdad esta medio confuso, es algo como kien primero: la gallina o el huevo..|`|eL9ewZrzaa	aha lo estaban filmando...|`|ihteWRXMaa	hay camaras ocultas como en truman show|`|riLuzjgBaa	Y por ke no vas por ellos para ayudarlos si tu ya sabes donde estan???|`|zZQfQurKaa	Es que no sabes a que Isla llegaron... es ni más ni menos que Gilligan es que los está filmando....

I'm not really disgusted, more like its nothing new.<br>  <br>  But I like a lot of her songs.|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Some people didn't believe that she was beaten by Chris Brown. <br>  <br>  It's kind of sad that no one in the music industry is speaking against Chris brown.|`|zAAeLFLuaa	Yes, it is so sad<br>  And the fact that theyre showing the picture like that|`|AA11133948	I don't know how anyone can deny that is Rihanna. The tattoos on the pic match hers, and you can see in the facial features that is her. <br>  <br>  Its very unfortunate that somebody released this photo. It shows that people will do anything to make a buck these days. Rihanna may be a celebrity, but she is a human being too. Doesn't anyone realize that she might have some embarassment about the situation. Nobody ever wants to be a victim of family/ domestic violence. I know that LAPD will find the leak and make sure that whoever is responsible is terminated.<br>  <br>  It is sick and wrong to publish this on the internet and TMZ is just as guilty as the officer that leaked these photos. TMZ has no shame!|`|coa3oXMXaa	It disgusts me that a man would even think about laying a hand on a woman... It's also never right for a woman to physically hurt a man either. <br>  This picture infuriated me. Even if it is fake that's probably what poor Rihanna looks similar to now. <br>  And for the people saying it's a good thing she was beaten and 'got what she deserved:' What the hell? So you don't like her music; punch her in the face? No woman, famous or not, should be physically harmed because you don't like her, her music, or something about her...|`|vSuiommVaa	We do not no what happend.<br>  Most of what weve heard in the news has been followed by "allegations"<br>  All that we know for certain which has happend is that there was some form of argument between the two of them and it seems like it was partly physical.<br>  <br>  Of course there is no reason to hit a woman as its wrong in so many ways.<br>  <br>  But we do not know why it happend, how long it was happening for and other things.<br>  <br>  And im pretty sure we never will.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Looking at the picture makes me feel sick in my stomach.<br>  Its horriffic yet it happens everyday :||`|u3mGPBlFaa	How 'bout a round of applause?<br>  <br>  Standing ovation..<br>  <br>  (tsk, tsk)|`|BongqGikaa	I THINK ITS DISGUSTING...i mean damn ive been in fist-a-cuffs before but got damn her face?? she isnt innoncent in all this it just so happened he got caught.... thats his bad|`|j4F3ruYNaa	I do..I'm one of her biggest fans and I came so close to tears.

QGBYOLIxaa	I'm a Taurus and I can tell you we like rich food, comfortable and beautiful surroundings, artistic, trustworthy, stable, stubborn, jealous, possessive, and we rarely can handle spicy food. Spicy food usually irritates a Taurus stomach real badly. We like routine, stability, security and we like to make money. We love sex, foreplay and require a lot of chatting. Taurus usually make good spouses and parents because we will defend our loved ones at all costs. I feel sorry for the fool who tries to hurt our loved ones, because they will run scared once they see how mad we get.<br>  <br>  Things that may come in handy when trying to approach a Taurus is not coming on too strong. Be funny, witty, calm and cool. If we like you, you'll know because we will always try to touch you somehow, by tickling, hugs, we'll constantly "accidently" touch you, and kiss your cheek quite a bit too. <br>  <br>  The Taurus' sweet spot in the neck. We love when the person we're attracted to touches our necks. All Taurus are different - some like soft kisses on the neck or a gentle stroke of your fingers down their neck, others like a nice bite or to have their necks grabbed (firm, but not too hard like if you're going to sufficate us). Once you get your Taurus started hold on for the ride. Taurus are usually slow at first (not because we're lazy, but because like to savor each moment), but as our urge increases we go harder and faster. A Taurus can sometimes require another round later on in the day or even in the middle of the night.<br>  <br>  If you want to get a Taurus something try something that smells nice, or something that looks pretty/nice/attractive, food, nice clothes, jewelry, make-up. <br>  <br>  We are very logical so never underestimate a Taurus. Even when you think we don't know, we do. And if we don't, we will soon enough. Your Taurus will mirror anything you do. If you are affectionate, they will be more affectionate. If you are mean, we can be so much meaner. And if we catch you being unfaithful, we sure will make you cry. Basically, do onto your Taurus what you want done to you. <br>  <br>  Taurus are compatible to Virgo, Capricorn, Cancer, Pisces, and Libras. They usually clash with Scorpio because it's our direct opposite sign, but can once in a blue also get along with them.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped, if you have any more questions feel free to write or ask. ^_^|`|a6v7XnJwaa	Taurus About Your Sign...<br>  The Taurean's characteristics are solidity, practicality, extreme determination and strength of will - no one will ever drive them, but they will willingly and loyally follow a leader they trust. They are stable, balanced, conservative good, law-abiding citizens and lovers of peace, possessing all the best qualities of the bourgeoisie. As they have a sense of material values and physical possessions, respect for property and a horror of falling into debt, they will do everything in their power to maintain the security of the status quo and be somewhat hostile to change.<br>  <br>  Mentally, they are keen-witted and practical more often than intellectual, but apt to become fixed in their opinions through their preference for following accepted and reliable patterns of experience. Their character is generally dependable, steadfast, prudent, just, firm and unshaken in the face of difficulties. Their vices arise from their virtues, going to extremes on occasion,such as sometimes being too slavish to the conventions they admire. <br>  <br>  On rare occasions a Taurean may be obstinately and exasperatingly self-righteous, unoriginal, rigid, ultraconservative, argumentative, querulous bores, stuck in a self-centered rut. They may develop a brooding resentment through nursing a series of injuries received and, whether their characters are positive or negative, they need someone to stroke their egos with a frequent, "Well Done!" Most Taureans are not this extreme though.<br>  <br>  They are faithful and generous friends with a great capacity for affection, but rarely make friends with anyone outside their social rank, to which they are ordinarily excessively faithful. In the main, they are gentle, even tempered, good natured, modest and slow to anger, disliking quarreling and avoiding ill-feeling. If they are provoked, however, they can explode into violent outbursts of ferocious anger in which they seem to lose all self-control. Equally unexpected are their occasional sallies into humor and exhibitions of fun.<br>  <br>  Although their physical appearance may belie it, they have a strong aesthetic taste, enjoying art, for which they may have a talent, beauty (recoiling from anything sordid or ugly) and music. They may have a strong, sometimes unconventional, religious faith. Allied to their taste for all things beautiful is a love for the good things of life pleasure, comfort, luxury and good food and wine and they may have to resist the temptation to over indulgence, leading to drunkenness, gross sensuality, and covetousness.<br>  <br>  In their work, Taureans are industrious and good craftspeople, and are not afraid of getting their hands dirty. They are reliable, practical, methodical and ambitious, within a framework of obedience to superiors. They are at their best in routine positions of trust and responsibility, where there is little need of urgency and even less risk of change, and a pension at the end. Yet they are creative and good founders of enterprises where the rewards of their productiveness come from their own work and not that of others.  <br>  They can flourish in many different trades and professions: banking, architecture, building, almost any form of bureaucracy, auctioneering, farming, medicine, chemistry, industry Taureans make good managers and foremen surveying, insurance, education and, perhaps surprisingly, music and sculpture. They make an ideal trustee or guardian, and can attain eminence as a chef. Some Taureans are gifted enough in singing to become opera stars or to excel in more popular types of music.<br>  <br>  They are more than averagely amorous and sensually self-conscious, but sexually straightforward and not given to experiment. They make constant, faithful, home loving spouses and thoughtful, kindly parents, demanding too much of neither their spouses nor children. They can be over possessive and may sometimes play the game of engineering family roles for the pleasure of making up the quarrel. If anyone offends their amour proper they can be a determined enemy, though magnanimous in forgiveness if their opponent makes an effort to meet them halfway.<br>  <br>  No other sign in the zodiac is closer to earth then Taurus. The main objective in leading a Taurean life is primarily (though not entirely) to maintain stability and physical concerns. Your inner spiritual sense longs for earthly harmony and wholesomeness. When you fully understand this, and work toward this end, you will no longer need to blindly reassure yourself with external possessions and comforts. A realization that finding this inner peace will cause all of the above mentioned positive things will overtake you and your life will be very full.<br>  <br>  Ultimately the Taurean needs to discover their truest, deepest and highest values. When they know what is truly valuable, they are no longer chained to people and to things that have to do with lesser values. The greatest indication of value to a Taurean is beauty, which cannot be owned, only appreciat|`|5NqNvbetaa	they usually aren't fond of kids, and if they have kids they think it's no big deal, they like routine and do not find routine boring the way most do, they like security in all aspects, hard-headed, logical and realistic, grounded, hate spontanaety|`|33l1SqrRaa	This will tell you everything you need to know:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(astrology)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(ast...</a>|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Us Taureans are all about comfort zone.|`|Ru3Y8Mhdaa	I could definitely tell you about Taurus for I am one myself.

We are very stubborn, and clingy as well.  Last but least really nice people makes us very gullible.

The thing is that something has got to be airing at all times. Radio doesn't want dead air (silence) Time is money on the radio. So if they're not pushing a commercial or a song, the DJ is there to keep things smooth and rolling.

sgRDJUXqaa	I didn't hate it, but I did find it to be overrated.  Sure, the action was great, and every scene with Heath Ledger was incredible.  But that's about it.  One thing that I didn't like were the multiple story lines.  They could have had their own movie but instead, the writer chose to lump them all together.  Really, 15 minutes of Two Face?  Don't you think you could dedicate an entire film to his mayhem?  And every time you think the movie is over, it's not; there is yet another story line and another climactic ending.  But wait, that's not all.  Get ready for a third one!<br>  <br>  I don't know.  It was just too much packed into one movie.  They could have devoted more time to just one of the story lines and saved Two Face for the next movie, but instead it felt rushed and not very well fleshed out.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying it was a bad movie by any means, but best movie ever?  Nah.  Too much too fast, and will somebody please tell Christian Bale that his Batman voice sucks.|`|dSmoB64Yaa	I think It's a near perfect movie and Heath ledger created one of the greatest villains in movie history. The two flaws in the film are: They packed in too many long extended scenes. The movie is a bit too long and each part of the multiple storylines are dragged on a little bit too long. The film could have been at least twenty minutes shorter. It did build up tension and suspense very well, but let's face it most of us were putting up with long scenes and just waiting to see Batman or the great Heath Ledger as the Joker, come back on onto the screen again. The other  flaw was Chrisitan Bale's voice. It was kind of silly and overdone. He should have just done what he did in the first film and not try so hard to compete with Ledger. Batman is the hero, Bale didn't need to out act Ledger. Let the Joker steal the film. It's OK to just be the hero and kick his butt in the end. It's like a game of basketball, when another teamate is scoring every time he has the ball. Don't try to be a super star and ask for the ball. Set your hot player up and pass to him. Feed the hot hand and let him go do his thing.  Don't try to make Batman sound harder and scarier than the Joker. Ledger was on a roll,  just pass him the ball and let him lead the film to victory|`|8bb58fa4a42dc6a54ae5600a0d408c42aa	I loved it. I know a lot of people that didn't like the hype and it turned them off to the film.|`|rn5xImvTaa	who cares? if you like the film enjoy it.I know I do.|`|HdS25o2saa	I haven't really heard many people say they hated it, I thought it was good but I wouldn't rate it in the best 100 movies I've ever seen, Christian Bale's Batman and Heath Ledger's Joker are very different characters to what Batman fans are used to, it's kinda like remaking Star Wars and completely changing all the characters personalities. All the hype about it was a big turn off, 99% of the hype was about Heath Ledger, I think that had he not died it still would have been very successful but would have made about half as much at the box office.|`|lJcbQ00Haa	Love it. But I have a friend who hates it even though she loved the first one. This is the same person who stops liking all her favorite bands the second they gain some popularity, so there's that. It's "cool" to hate things that everyone likes, it makes you different. Or, you know, "original." (Not that this is the reason why everyone who hates it hates it. I'm just sayin'...)|`|YWjhqlxbaa	I didn't want to watch it because I thought that Jack Nicholson should have been the Joker instead of Heath Ledger. <br>  <br>  I mean I love Batman. I LOVE IT!<br>  <br>  But the 1989 version with Tim Burton as the director. <br>  <br>  I also didn't want to watch it because people made a big deal out of it. <br>  <br>  That's just my opinion.|`|FAEiMcIWaa	Wonderful action movie ...I totally agree|`|5uUSJNSLaa	i dunno. but i loved it. go the joker.|`|cTJqaCcQaa	really? i don't hate the dark knight....its one of my top 5 movies|`|K9MJwEVkaa	I totally agree lol|`|OURb1rnTaa	i did not hate it, but fell asleep. thought it was overrated.|`|JzYlcuXzaa	I liked it too.<br>  <br>  I haven't really heard a lot of people say they didn't like it.

qsKu5WiMaa	In 1999, Ken Carter, a successful sporting goods store owner, accepts the job of basketball coach for his old high school in a poor area of Richmond, CA, where he was a champion athlete. As much dismayed by the poor attitudes of his players as well as their dismal play performance, Carter sets about to change both. He immediately imposes a strict regime typified in written contracts that include stipulations for respectful behavior, a dress code and good grades as requisites to being allowed to participate. The initial resistance from the boys is soon dispelled as the team under Carter's tutelage becomes a undefeated competitor in the games. However, when the overconfident team's behavior begins to stray and Carter learns that too many players are doing poorly in class, he takes immediate action. To the outrage of the team, the school and the community, Carter cancels all team activities and locks the court until the team shows acceptable academic improvement. In the ensuing debate, Carter fights to keep his methods, determined to show the boys that they need to rely on more than sports for their futures and eventually finds he has affected them more profoundly than he ever expected|`|8bb58fa4a42dc6a54ae5600a0d408c42aa	I'd start with Wikipedia.

uRSUeFQ9aa	In a nutshell:<br>  <br>  You have a hard time giving and receiving compliments, there was little grounding for the self and thus, you have searched for "who you are" for quite some time.  Also, I'm betting that you are self-defensive.  Your parents cause you great stress, and they might be the source of why you have been so self-defensive and self-protective.  Also I'm guessing you might have moved houses or even cities when you were 9, possibly around january of '94.|`|d2dkgYRaaa	I'm moving to Phoenix by March 30! How funny.

At that moment I do a counter clockwise sweep with my left hand, grabbing his wrist. Then I stomp on his right foot with my right foot, and under-hook his right armpit with my right arm. This has his body bent and slightly twisted, while I then trow all of my weight backwards...and that my friend is some considerable weight! When we are at about a 45 degree angle, I take my right arm (still in his armpit) and slam him in the back of the head. This takes his forward momentum and transfers the force to his face, which will be the very first thing to hit the ground. Also at the point of you hitting him, you have moved your weight on top of him, adding to the damage when he hits the ground. If done hard and fast enough, this move will totally incapacitate the slimebag. And even if it doesn't, you on top of him from behind and can grab his ears and slam his face into the pavement a few times. I guarantee that this will take the fight right out of him. And if, by some miracle it hasn't...quickly stand up at his feet. When he starts to get on his knees, kick him in the goodies like you are kicking the winning field-goal at the Super Bowl.

rwXcLTNvaa	There will be a sixth season, and they said they are going to try to turn the show around and ''fix it''. Besides the actors are under contract for 7 seasons. So even if the seasons are going to have 10 episodes, they are still going to happen if Shoda says so.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	I think there might be one more season.  That show literally went to hell in a handbasket.  Even the people getting paid to act on the show are getting sick of it. I personally haven't watched it for a couple of seasons now, it just got too much for me to stand.  I'm not so sure about Private Practice either....|`|qizx0Xvjaa	To me greys anatomy has lost it.

942aa1d4b1e1ff8040ff86dbb6b64d3daa	If you want your daughter to make some serious money, she needs to be very compromising and willing to take risks.  There's no such thing as an easy getting in,  She has to be willing to broaden her spectrum.  There were model contestants who appeared on the Tyra Bank's top models show who didn't make it to the finals because they were not willing to exploit themselves.  And in Hollywood, exploitation is a must.  If you do not want your daughter to make serious money, then you shouldn't suggest that she gets into modeling.  I myself am an expert when it comes to interviewing models.  I do it for a living.  All of the models who didn't make it to stardom told me that they wish they had been more open-minded and willing to exploit themselves a little more, no matter what.  Usually, when models get eliminated from the suites, they feel so depressed that they start doing porno movies.  Once they meet the producers there, they find out that they really have to be a lot more exploited and flirtatious.

As you may have known already, it is filler arc, a flashback of Kakashi's past. Probably 13-14 years ago...<br>  <br>  The purpose of the Kakashi Gaiden is to somehow be an intermission between Naruto Part I and the part II, Shippuden..a delaying tactic actually...since the part II hasn't been completely made into anime...|`|AA11147301	Kakashi Gaiden is going to air sometime around Febuary 15th...|`|1d76ed78293eb7f67e19aec8ec8d0ee2aa	My favorite site is <a href="http://shc221b.blogspot.com/2005/08/naru..." rel="nofollow">http://shc221b.blogspot.com/2005/08/naru...</a> the pictures are big!

It's spelled Gaara from Naruto.  Gaara is not emo, he does not want to ******* throw himself off a cliff, cut his arm til physical pain takes over the emotional, or even think about crying any where, anytime!  Gaara kicks ***, 'kay? He is a leader - as in the Kazekage!  The most powerful person in the village of sand.  Those black rings around his eyes are not from eyeliner.  The bijuu he contains will take over Gaara if he falls asleep - therefore those black rings are from insomnia.  You know that tattoo on his forehead in red that's a kanji, that says 'Ai' or love.  Gaara is love, how many emo people are loving?|`|5f152bea292486a353cbd4279d462da7aa	O.o'. I dont know whether i should be laughing at you, or feeling bad for you.

XeA4ZGhsaa	It's awesome to finally meet another young trombonist who also practices!  Anyway, like you said, theory isn't going to make you the best.  There aren't certain books or things you need to get better tone.  What you need to do is listen to some proffesionals so you know what you're supposed to sound like.  Also, when warming up, buzz on just your mouth piece.  Also try to slur between notes alot to listen up your embouchure.  Also make sure you give enough air support and make sure you warm up enough before a performance.  The most important thing is air support.  Take big breaths and have good posture.  I had the same problem.  Now I am first chair in jazz and symphonic.  Hopefully this will also work for you.  Good luck! ^__^|`|jdgtAsQMaa	Hey, here is a good tip to improve your tone quality:  When you are practicing at home, before you play a section of a song buzz it first (on just your mouthpiece).  The more times you do that before playing a section, the better your tone TRUST ME.  You will definetly notice a difference in that section.|`|v3lYdPvOaa	Practicing on just the mouthpiece is very important in developing a core sound on the trombone.  If you can play a tune on just your mouthpiece, when you play it on your horn it will sound much better.  Also try to focus on proper air support.  Place your hand just above your bellybutton and say a hearty "ho, ho, ho."  This is where the air should come from when you play.  Poor breath support can also ruin your tone.<br>  <br>  I might also suggest switching mouthpieces.  A 12C is a beginner mouthpiece.  You are probably ready to switch to an intermediate mouthpiece which would be a Bach 6? or its equivalent.<br>  <br>  As far as books go, every trombone player should have a copy of Arbans Complete Method for Trombone.  It's essential for developing technique.  I also suggest "Melodious Etudes for Trombone" by Rochut.  This book will help you with legato and slurring and is also excellent for developing a good core sound.<br>  <br>  And for dents, they usually have little effect on your sound.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

CHbsJMyVaa	Don't worry, they haven't disbanded just yet!<br>  <br>  "Chase This Light"<br>  After their tour with Green Day, Jimmy Eat World headed home to Tempe and started working on material for a sixth album. This album is to be produced by legendary producer Butch Vig (Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth). Some of the new songs mentioned by drummer Zach Lind on the Jimmy Eat World Band Blog (<a href="http://www.jimmyeatworld.com/band)" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimmyeatworld.com/band)</a> are "Carry You", "Chase This Light", "Be Sensible", "Firefight", "Distraction", "Electable", "Stop", "Beautiful Is", "Dizzy", "Big Casino", and "Gotta Be Somebody's Blues". The song "Carry You" originated as a track from Jim Adkins' side project Go Big Casino. (Previous Go Big Casino songs that eventually appeared on Jimmy Eat World albums include "Hear You Me", "My Sundown", and "12.23.95".) The album will be out in September worldwide and be titled "Chase This Light." [1]|`|8H8NnjEFaa	no they haven't broken up. they just havent created an album in awhile. kinda like a rest for awhile.
3e0fec73501e99630cd4c9fdbcf104d0aa	My step-brother was also born on Friday the 13th (August 13) and has definitely had a life of high ups and low downs.<br>  <br>  In answer to your question, in numerology the number "13" is considered a Karmic Debt Number, so often those born on that day, or those with a 13 somewhere in their charts will face some additional obstacles in life.  This doesn't by any means mean that they can't be successful; quite the contrary some are very if they can learn to really focus and work hard.  <br>  <br>  A "13" in a chart can mean you will have to work doubly-hard sometimes to attain your goals.  Often these people can fall into the trap of laziness or will just give up because they want to take short-cuts to be sucessful.  They can have a poor self-image.  They tend to scatter themselves in too many directions, and may not have the discipline to perfect themselves in one area or stay in one field for too long.  In order for someone with a 13 to be sucessful, they need to keep their environment clean and organized, follow-through on things, including all appointments and never ever procrastinate.  But it will take work.<br>  <br>  Often, though, there are other numbers at work within one's chart that can have an effect too on a person's ability to overcome obstacles.  This would explain why "13" (as alluded to by another poster) is not always an unlucky number for everyone.  For example, my brother is also on a Life Path of 8, and I've never met anyone with an 8 Life Path who did not have an issue with money to overcome, which, by the way, happens to be his main source of ups and downs.  He is terrible at managing his finances (and fully admits this!), and a good deal of his problems stem from the fact that when he has money, he spends it, whether he has debts that he has obligated himself to or not.  He also has no plans to save for the future, and can get incredibly disorganized when depressed, so it's often a live-by-the-seat-of-my-pants kind of lifestyle.  So while he may not understand why his life has been filled with all these ups and downs, the rest of us who know him and can be objective are saying to ourselves, "Uh, huh, we know EXACTLY why he's struggled all his life!" (LOL!)<br>  <br>  Numerologically, based on your DOB info provided, you also have a "19" Karmic Debt in your chart, and often those with a 19 also have a problem learning what 'freedom' actually means, so that is a common obstacle for them.  They tend to resist help, almost stubbornly, they have a real problem taking advice because their independence is self-imposed.  They have to be reminded that as important as it is for them to be independent, we all need assistance and support sometimes, and that doesn't make us any weaker for taking it every now and again or for at least kindly listening to the advice of others, whether we take it or not.<br>  <br>  You are also on a Life Path of 7, which may make you very spiritual and somewhat introverted.  You are kind of a loner, at least in terms of your thoughts.  It may be difficult for you to get close to people.  You can be charming and the life of the party, though, when you choose to be.  Although you can be quite social, you do need your own time to retreat back to the solitude of being alone, so sometimes this can make intimacy difficult because you definitely need your privacy.  This can also make you feel empty at times, and maybe even overly cynical, selfish or withdrawn.  You may be jealous of others and too critical of yourself.  You do have the ability to be sucessful in life, but you must learn how to be independent without isolating yourself.  Most "7"s find themselves in middle-age, when they have had more life-experience and feel wiser about life.  They are drawn to careers in business, religion, insurance, invention, research, science and the occult.<br>  <br>  A "13" birthday also typically means you have a love of family and nature.  You have artistic talent that you should develop.  You can be a hard worker and have excellent concentration as long as you are taking good care of yourself.  You may feel like you have as yet to find the work you truly love.  You may flit from job to job trying to find your place.  Your challenge is to make the most of what has been given to you.  Stick with a job for awhile and strengthen your skills in a particular field so you don't wander from job to job or relationship to relationship.  You can be stubborn at times.  Maintain order and discipline, and make the most of what the universe sends your way.<br>  <br>  I hope this gave you some insight into the number "13" and answered some of your questions.  Good luck to you!|`|KAVQ3uJIaa	My boyfriend was also born on Friday Nov. 13th.  He has been very unlucky as well.

1yuwwUJHaa	I dont know too much about the donald reference, but i've included a link saying it's not true.  but there are a few that I have seen. The one that stands out most in my mind was the Lion King. There's a scene where the word sex seems to materialize (from clouds or stars, , .i dont recall)  <br>  <br>  The company said that it was added in post by the SFX department (special effects) and that in fact was what it meant.<br>  <br>  Some claims are 'real', however... in the case of the resucers, some editor put 2 frames of a topless woman..millions of copies were recalled (it had been in the film for decades)<br>  <br>  Some people look at it as a marketing ploy. . (publicity stunt) <br>  many are worried about the (subliminal/subconsious) negative affects these things will have on their children. Before you jump on the bandwagon, consider this. When you first heard about these scenes, could you immediately identify them, or did you have to go back and look at them? (those w/o the movies went out to buy them) Adults are certainly more capable of catching an "inside" joke and the chances your child will notice is slim  at best. <br>  <br>  Look at shrek....they had open, obvious comments that were, in my opinion put there for adult/parent enjoyment..comments kids would probably have NO idea was being said.<br>  <br>  Take for example the scene where shrek, donkey and fiona first see the castle. <br>  <br>  Donkey says replys to fionas amazement at the big castle...<br>  "Shrek says he's compensating for somthing. I think that means he's got a really small..."<br>  <br>  "DONKEY"<br>  <br>  I died when I heard that. . .was I worried about my kids hearing it or whatever.  Nope...they had no clue...<br>  <br>  or the "eat me" gingerbread comment...<br>  (granted, those arent disney . .but i'm hoping you get my point)<br>  <br>  Personally i'd be more upset about a lemming documentary that Disney made back in 1958, where they forced lemmings to jump off a cliff to "document their suicidal behavior"  did disney know about it? who knows...<br>  <br>  LOL i dont know if i've helped at all or simply bored you with my babble...regardless....take care and have a great weekend!|`|JcDgoMWQaa	What?

E7liDKEWaa	Could be this one?<br>  Chris Brown wrote an answer song titled "Cinderella" with the same melody but different lyrics. It had been released to radio stations by June 12, 2007. In it his verse replaces Rihanna's second verse, but they share the third verse and the final chorus. His chorus, however, differs from Rihanna's: instead of "You can stand under my umbrella", he sings "You can be my Cinderella". It is unofficially titled "Cinderella Under the Umbrella". The remix was not well-received on Pop radio, and most Pop stations stopped playing it because of complaints from listeners. However, the "Cinderella" remix is exclusively played in most Urban radio formats where the original version initially received little attention.

AA11096795	ATWA is an acronym for Air, Trees, Water, Animals and All The Way Alive. It was first termed by Charles Manson in the early 1970s.

0e54929c245a461efa623779a6639147aa	In my opinion, all 4 bands mentioned are great, but I personally like DBSK best. They also are currently the most popular boy-band in Korea. However, Shinhwa is the LONGEST running boyband, so I guess they deserve credit too. SS501 has often been compared to DBSK and some people say they are 'rivals' (since they both have 5 members who sing and dance). Super Junior and DBSK are both from SM Entertainment, so I think they are more of friendly rivals (lots of SuJu members are friends with DBSK, and vice-versa). I don't think I could even compare DBSK to Shinhwa; not for talent, but for their age difference, maturity, and number of years they've been together as a group. I respect all 4 groups, and think they have their own special talent and charisma, which makes them each unique from the another.|`|9CZpgolaaa	if u ask me... i would sae dbsk<br>  they are best looking.. have best dances.. sings the best..<br>  hahas..<br>  but super junior is not bad because they're pretty cute as well.. quite funny at times..<br>  shinhwa songs are not bad but they're quite old already.. so u can see they're not tt good looking anyomore.. hahas.jk.|`|LzwZMVuRaa	acutally i heard that shihwha said that dbsk are the best juniors^^ i think that dbsk and super junior are tyed because they are friends and they have soooo much fans all over the world|`|gXAnvEfFaa	dbsk is pretty good.

56aPsgD0aa	I see no problem with my daughter watching the show. Girls like boys, it's normal. Girls like to dress up, that's normal too. What's important is that they know their identity is not that of a TV character, and to respect themselves. If you rely on a TV show to teach your daughter to stand up to bullies, then you are allowing her to be taught more than that by the TV. I teach my daughter to respect herself without relying on a character from Disney channel. When Miley does something I don't think my daughter should do, I know I've taught her that's not real life. She can enjoy the show for what it is, a show.|`|ax6DRc5Yaa	miley isnt a bad role model for your dauhter. shes a great one. she has never kissed anyone on the lips except her costar, cody, and that was only fo the show. her and nick use to date but now theyre just really good friends. shes a Christian girl and got really upset about the pregnancy rumors taht were going around. she said in an interview that she believes in being a virgin and staying pure until marriage. i dont like the way she wears short skirts sometimes but honestly, she doest wear them that much. she has a great realationship with her family and her and her dad are really tight. shes grown tho since she first starred on hannah montana. in the first season of the show she was only 12-13 yrs old. now shes gonna be turning 15 soon in november. shes growing up but that doesnt mean shes a bad role model for your daughter. hope i helped. =D|`|3xYbbUFcaa	well i dont know i mean she is growing up u know.|`|HbrSuxcYaa	uhh I don't agree with you. if you look around at some of the other girls around here. EVERYONE DRESSES that way. its not just Miley and ur daughter. If you don't like it just tell your kid to stop watching it.What are girls those ages suppost to think about? Their school work? I think not. When i was 14 i thought of everything but school work and my sister is 14 now she dresses just like that. not because of something on tv. just because she knows she can and she'll get away with it. I know where you're getting at with this but kids have their own way of expressing themselves you can't tell them oh you cant wear this you cant wear that. they wont like that very much....

DN1IpZUhaa	First of all, heck yes... I love Breathless.<br>  <br>  I tried to do some research for you, but came up empty handed.<br>  <br>  My first thought was that you could get a copy of the film with English AND French subtitles... find the section you wanted, then read the subtitles in French.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like any copy exists with both languages in subtitle.<br>  <br>  Then, I thought you might be able to find it in the script.  I was able to find an English translation of the script, but couldn't find the words 'girl', 'jerk', 'rich man', or anything.  Struck out again.<br>  <br>  My last thought was that if you read/speak French, you could get a French copy of the script and just read through until you found the line... or something like that.<br>  <br>  Sorry I wasn't much help, but I also just wanted to give a shout out to another Jean-Luc fan...

PpmlbwxOaa	Both and neither, sometimes lyrics, sometimes music. Sounds like you are having problems putting lyrics to music?right? A trick I use is I will hum the melody of how I hear what the words will sound like, or I sing nonsensical words/sounds (not real words) that sound like what I want the lyrics to sound like (sounds silly but I used it for years (until I blew my voice) taught my bands new singer same trick, now she does it, the words will slowly come. It's your song/music so you know the feeling or message you are trying to convey. Let the music speak to you, it will tell you how the lyrics should sound. It is up to you to fill in the words to the story.|`|BjQZ95HOaa	it differs with people. try it yourself.  For me, I find lyrics distracting when I'm composing. If you can't compose without lyrics, then try getting an old poem and sing to it.

A piece of this sort of astrology deals with the planets (referred to as Graha). 'Graha' is the term used to refer to any heavenly body or point that one believes has the power to cause an impact on the lives of humans. <br>  <br>  For most, this translates into planet, but Graha also involves lunar nodes (Rahu and Ketu), as well as sub-planets (upgrahas) that are not planetary bodies but still viewed in the same manner. Interestingly, Uranus and Neptune are not listed the category of Graha. <br>  <br>  An example of one of the nine Grahas is called Chandra, which is viewed as a 'lunar deity.' Chandra is a youthful, attractive male with fair skin and two arms that are mostly seen holding a club and a lotus. He rides on a chariot (expressed as the moon) and travels across the sky each night. Ten white horses (or a single antelope) are seen pulling his chariot.<br>  <br>  Since the deity is linked to dew, he is one of the gods representing fertility. Sometimes, he is also called Hishapati (lord of the night) and other times, Kshuparaka (one who illuminates the night). Other associations include 'Sattva Guna,' which possesses ties to the Mind, also known as the Queen (or Mother). <br>  <br>  Following more details concerning this Indian astrological figure, you will find that Chandra is also father of Budha (also known as the planet Mercury). Marriages in his life include Rohini, Anuradha, and Bharani, who make up the 27 Nakshatras (also known as constellations) and the daughters of Daksha<br>  |`|PwlAGkrraa	ya i do believe in astrology bcoz sometimes it proves to be correct after all they r based on stars na. just try once u ur self will notice it ok than all the best.think its a guess work where u enjoy in believing and waiting it to be true when ball is in u r court. ok than bye bye |`|foyS73yYaa	I think, Astrology is nice way to know own futur&past bcouz in acent time mostly astrologiest available& now is also available but ratio is down compare to acent time. so lastly i can say that we belive but not more few time|`|RY5LqkWaaa	Nope..bt sometimes i think about believing it..<br>  I belive in God, bt not astrology.|`|WMXY3kxtaa	I think we must belive in our self.......<br>  do not worry....give freedom to your self....and be faith in ourself.....<br>  that's ALL|`|SOMwyDhXaa	sometimes

I gotta get this record!"<br>  <br>  Now, I am sure there might be an occasional artist in the Genre that I would like more than others ( I think I got Fiona Apples debut, along with a Sarah McLachlan album and Dolores O'Riordan's newest, if those are in this Genre), but as a whole, I like my music more memorable.<br>  <br>  And I guess that is why I don't really pay attention to it.  I don't mind mellow, or low key, but it still needs things to make it stand out from the masses, and generally speaking, at least from my limited exposure, it doesn't.<br>  <br>  I really don't know what the hallmark differences between Aldult Alternative and Adult Contemporary are TBH.  Michelle Branch (I actually sorta like the Wreckers) or Celine Dion... kinda blends together.<br>  <br>  Usually when I want mellow, I pull out my Jazz or Celtic music collection.  Just seems to be a more stark contrast, and a more lasting poignant feel to that music for me.<br>  <br>  Good Q, though.  Not something talked about too often here, and it certainly got me thinking.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	Matthew Good (not to be confused with Dave Matthews) is a great adult artist and is very underrated in my opinion. So is Raine Maida.<br>  <br>  I don't mind SOME of the artists you listed, but maaaan I can't stand Colbie.|`|fSYDOxX8aa	It's OK in small doses, but I wouldn't get a whole album's worth of adult alternative songs.<br>  <br>  BA: Don't really have one.<br>  BA2: I don't mind hearing "How to Save a Life" from time to time.|`|YlCgMDVwaa	I didn't know what it was TBH.  If its those bands....then I do not like it at all.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Hey Lily! :)<br>  <br>  Well, I find artists like Jack Johnson, The Fray, etc. a little...boring, I'm afraid. I find their music kinda bland, personally. Like there's not a lot in it. As you said, its very simple. I want some real emotion in my music, some awesome guitar solos, some FEELING!!! XD<br>  <br>  You know?|`|DbtS5jzEaa	I will let you in on a secret...but shoosh don't tell no one<br>  <br>  I love Colbie Caillat shhhhh<br>  <br>  Try out Jason Reeves like her only a dude...they sing together quite a bit actually. <br>  <br>  I like other artist who are Adult Alt...but it's not my favorite genre...<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  BQ: Jason Reeves<br>  BQ2: Photographs and Memories - Jason Reeves|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	Yeah, I like some of it.  I've heard a lot of different bands/artists being labeled as that though, so honestly, I'm not entirely sure what is and is not adult alternative.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Not my cup of tea exactly, but I don't really hate it.  I'm kind of in between on it actually.  Some of it just absolutely sickens me, but I listen to some here and there.|`|ebxwADDcaa	that genre is good, but i gott be in the mood. otherwise it gets boring for me. <br>  <br>  BQ - eh, does DMB count?<br>  BQ2 - if yea, The Space Between by DMB|`|nYqtw9DWaa	I actually enjoy it.. it is relaxing.<br>  <br>  bq: Jack Johnson|`|qLqYSeqRaa	I like a lot of it, but there are times when I am totally not in the mood to listen to it.<br>  I love Jack Johnson though!|`|wTNAOcl1aa	Yeah i like a very small bit. Mainly Jack Johnson. He is a beast. Haha.|`|XHwhhSgaaa	I used to like a few Michelle Branch songs and a couple from the Fray, but that didn't last long at all.  They tend to get more boring and monotonous each time you listen to them.<br>  John Mayer's song Say What You Need to Say (or whatever its called) is really boring. He sings the same line toooo many times. But the guy was kinda cool on Chapelle's show.|`|UDqQNYglaa	Ummm<br>  I think Bush and Fastball kind of fall into that category. Those are two 90s alternative bands that I REALLY like. I don't care for much of it, though. I take it in small doses and I usually feel like blasting Bloodbath or Hypocrisy right after listening to it.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ: Fastball, Bush<br>  BQ2: "Out of My Head", "The Way", "Glycerine", "Machinehead"|`|TlU3zj61aa	I actually realized as I read this question that I have been moving out of my harder metal/punk/rock music and more into this kind of stuff. I've been listening to artists like Jason Mraz, John Mayer, Foo Fighters, Matchbox 20m Secondhand Serneade, Jack's Mannequin etc...and I didn't really realize it until you brought it to my attention. lol<br>  BQ: I think I am going to have to go with John Mayer|`|2FIbamFgaa	just Jack Johnson. Not so much the others.<br>  BA: Jack Johnson for sure<br>  BA2: None really, I guess anything by Jack Johnson. I met him once... cool guy, cool guy.<br>  But it all depends. I really have to be in the mood to appreciate it.|`|zZPbmxWkaa	I think it's okay. Not a big fan of it. I like some Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz, and a some Sara Bareilles (except for Lovesong, she's pretty good).|`|WbMxgSXLaa	I personally don't care for it... I mean I used to like some things afew years ago, but recenty I think all of them sound the same... I have nothing against that genre, it's just not for me anymore|`|ad3M8wViaa	Gives me a headache! The Fray is good but I really don't like all those other artists. Jason Mraz annoys me, along with Sara Bareilles.<br>  <br>  BQ: The Fray.<br>  BQ2: Over My Head.|`|372458a63fdf2cfd5035da966e6ddf39aa	I think it's kind of a boring genre, but the lyrics are usually pretty good. I just wish they could put those words to some instrumentals that won't put me to sleep.|`|AgQForcYaa	Myeh, that's the kinda stuff my mom listens to... I can only take two or three songs, and then I'm like "all right, ma, I needs sum heavy metulz!!"|`|AA12135515	Some of the names up there are among The Most tiresome names in pop music today, IMO.|`|qPNLkZfVaa	I think it sucks beef!|`|i0hw36Ihaa	The Wallflowers-One Headlight.<br>  <br>  Just find it. I know you have heard it.|`|k7jGZydJaa	I don't like it. It makes me very anxious and depressed.|`|wOc4Dqllaa	I dislike the majority of it, and loathe some of it. I always have, 'cept when I went through a short Lifehouse and John Mayer obsessed phase.<br>  <br>  BQ: The Counting Crows, unless you go with Wikipedia's definition, in which case my answer would be R.E.M.<br>  BQ2: Anna Begins, Perfect Blue Buildings, Mr. Jones and pretty much anything else off of the Counting Crows' first record.|`|6LcHJbHjaa	Actually i think it's pretty good, i like lots of dave mathews, phish, and jack johnson, but it's not the genre i'm crazy about it, but i like to put it on when i try to go to sleep or that kind of stuff. <br>  <br>  Don't know why it's called Adult Alternative though.

I was a real hot rodder then.  He did purchase a Pontiac that had been souped up and used to run in the local speedway races.<br>  <br>  Boy, did I have fun, fun, fun with that one!  Then he switched to a Nash Rambler.   Go figure.|`|fce6b20339c75fb9fb439e1ea485621aaa	No,he drove a Chevy blazer.My mom drove the Thunderbird. :)|`|CRuxWsi0aa	No, Batmobile|`|fFe75M3Baa	Nope, a Harley|`|yiBSvLf8aa	Yes, ;)|`|AKVQNGcOaa	idk but he drives a prius now|`|UY3zl9dFaa	No, it really was my "father's Oldsmobile"|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	No but he had a super cool Ford Galaxy 500.  Loved that car.
MKcIpLXIaa	Not a whole lot, lol. He's just a DJ... hypes up tracks, gets top rappers together to make hot songs and releases them on an album.<br>  <br>  He is a solid producer though, you know it's his song because he yells out "Beat Novacaine" in the same annoying voice... he doesn't produce many tracks though.
ixHwF4apaa	i prefer oral shopping|`|5OgCrE3Yaa	I personally like online shopping. There is less hassle. You don't have to deal with long lines etc...And it only takes like what 3 days to get by paying for the 3-7 day shipping.

My old roommates were Vocal majors so they were obsessed with cleaning the house because breathing dust or mold can affect your voice so I swear those girls vacuumed and dusted in their sleep. It was like 24/7. But what's GOOD for your voice is TEA.|`|Hy6INg6Naa	Trying to sing like Brian Johnson of AC/DC or Geddy Lee of Rush are bad.|`|pxTvnAtJaa	Sword swallowing I'd imagine|`|zU1lJ5YXaa	With alcohol it's a case of moderation being the key. Also, don't drink heavy before a performance.<br>  The most important thing is to avoid straining your voice: if it hurts to sing or feels tight, something's not working right! <br>  Talking loud and yelling all the time can make your voice hoarse.<br>  It's important to exercise your voice to improve the range and staying power of your notes, but you have to make sure that you're not singing from way back in the throat or forcing it too hard out of the nose, both are uncomfortable and the tone won't be as clear, and eventually will take a toll on your voice.<br>  Singing with any sort of cold or flu is an absolute no-no.<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|3d65ce43ba27d8d0d29bb7d9241e044caa	Try to sing from your stomach, pushing with the diaphragm. Don't make the power come from the throat so much, cause that will prolly cause strain|`|Qwt2Uaulaa	I don't know about alcohol but you should never eat or drink dairy products within an hour of performing or non-casual practicing.|`|X5MVvaDuaa	Smoking.|`|GZm2gcaCaa	Singing is bad for your singing voice|`|xVIHOPXLaa	alcohal, definitely.|`|B86AhUPwaa	smoking|`|XeN4Jabxaa	Umm...

There are people who've never touched a weight in their life that are ripped because of their body type and their low body fat %.<br>  <br>  People are so, so different in this area.  But, if you build muscle and get lean, it can only help.  If you're reasonable thin already, you can see amazing things in 2 months.|`|88uIjItaaa	1 do 100... it will take time for sure.

It's kinda not fair to compare the Beatles to the Jonas's who learnt at such a young age. Nick was a Solo artist when he was like 8 - 10, and the youngest Beatle was like 15. The Beatles are rad too, it's kinda hard to pick. Go figure.<br>  <br>  ?M.|`|D0E3csbKaa	wow is this even a question?<br>  <br>  no comparison should be made whatsoever.<br>  <br>  the jonas brothers are a 5 minutes of fame boy band, the Beatles are forever.|`|zLilrd1Haa	OK THE BEATLES R THE BEST BAND ON THE EARTH!

The yahoo news page has an article on it right now.  My nieces are living the same as you, too.  Try to stay neutral and be as pleasant as possible under the circumstances.  Try  to spend some one on one time with each parent, stay out of their problems, distract them if they appear to be headed for a fight.  Talk to each of them separately and tell them even though you know they have their own issues, the mental health and well being of you and your brothers is still their responsibility.  Happiness to you sweetheart.|`|HV1UIaSQaa	I think that your Dad should be more mature about the situation (don't mean to offend at all).

OCCzu7bFaa	Belting, without a doubt.  <br>  <br>  Think of your voice like the engine of a car that switches gears.  You can only go so fast in first gear before you have to switch into second gear, or you do a lot of damage to your vehicle.  Similarly, singing opera requires the use of registers in the voice, meaning that as you ascend the scale, your throat (i.e., larynx, pharyngeal cavity) has to create some sort of different shape to accomodate the higher notes.  Usually this means your larynx will get lower and your pharyngeal cavity will get a little bigger. This helps you to ascend the scale with ease and control.  <br>  <br>  Belting uses the lowest natural register in your voice (which is chest voice--the register that we all speak on) and forces it up the scale without making any adjustments, similar to a car trying to drive 70 mph in first gear.  <br>  <br>  Operatic technique is difficult in that you have to have training and practice for years to master it, but it is the healthiest choice for you if you plan on singing for more than just a few years.|`|AQFwSLgiaa	Basically it's opera. Opera singers have to use their stomach to belt out their notes out. There is a way to do it but it takes a lot of time and practice. Opera singers need to belt out their voice so people from the back can hear them. Opera and belting go in the same category because thats what opera singers need to do. Its the most hardest thing to do but you need a lot of practice and years before you can master it. Opera singers go up and down the scale and its a hard thing to do and I know this because I take opera. When you first start it, its hard but the more you practice the more you get it, the better it comes to you. It depends on the way you belt your notes out. There's a right way and a wrong way.|`|uPDAmpdFaa	Belting isn't singing. It's a damaging form of yelling. That leaves Opera as my only answer.

556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	"Can you motivate to get up and get things done?"<br>  <br>  Not always...*lol*  Ok, more like not usually.  Seriously, I get stuck in a half-feral funk at least half the time, so I am most likely the *worst* person in the world to ask this sort of question, but...<br>  <br>  I do know this much, that the *Pressure* you put on yourself doesn't help.  The more you stress out and insist on what you *should* be doing, the less likely it is that you'll find yourself wanting to unplug and get it done.<br>  <br>  So.  Here's what you do.  Take that list of things you've "gotta do", and cut in in half.  Decide which things you are going to do "Today" and which ones you're going to do "tomorrow" or "Monday".  If you have two options, pick one, give yourself the whole day to get it done, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  And once that decision is made--and you've thus liberated some time--admit that *this* is what you should be doing right now.  There's nothing wrong with chilling out for a few minutes or even an hour if that is *indeed* what you're doing.  So committ yourself to doing just that.  Get it done.  Go with the flow of where you are now until it leads you *naturally* away from the computer.  Have you had lunch yet?  Have you taken any restroom breaks?  Ok then, there you go...those might be good times to consider unplugging, when it feels like the right time to do so.<br>  <br>  And in the meantime, skip the stress and *be here* whole-heartedly.<br>  <br>  It works for me...ok, maybe half the time.  ^_^  Did I mention being a really *bad* person to ask about these things...?  *lol*|`|hG48Lhnzaa	No I have to wait until the last minute when the pressure finally gets to me.|`|B5fdh5oIaa	Ok, here is the best answer :<br>  Staying motivated is a struggle-I know that — our drive is constantly assaulted by negative thoughts and anxiety about the future. Everyone faces doubt and depression. What separates the highly successful is the ability to keep moving forward.<br>  <br>  There is no simple solution for a lack of motivation. Even after beating it, the problem reappears at the first sign of failure. The key is understanding your thoughts and how they drive your emotions. By learning how to nurture motivating thoughts, neutralize negative ones, and focus on the task at hand, you can pull yourself out of a slump before it gains momentum.<br>  <br>  How to Boost Confidence<br>  <br>  The first motivation killer is a lack of confidence. When this happens to me, it’s usually because I’m focusing entirely on what I want and neglecting what I already have. When you only think about what you want, your mind creates explanations for why you aren’t getting it. This creates negative thoughts. Past failures, bad breaks, and personal weaknesses dominate your mind. You become jealous of your competitors and start making excuses for why you can’t succeed. In this state, you tend to make a bad impression, assume the worst about others, and lose self confidence.<br>  <br>  The way to get out of this thought pattern is to focus on gratitude. Set aside time to focus on everything positive in your life. Make a mental list of your strengths, past successes, and current advantages. We tend to take our strengths for granted and dwell on our failures. By making an effort to feel grateful, you’ll realize how competent and successful you already are. This will rejuvenate your confidence and get you motivated to build on your current success.<br>  <br>  It might sound strange that repeating things you already know can improve your mindset, but it’s amazingly effective. The mind distorts reality to confirm what it wants to believe. The more negatively you think, the more examples your mind will discover to confirm that belief. When you truly believe that you deserve success, your mind will generate ways to achieve it. The best way to bring success to yourself is to genuinely desire to create value for the rest of the world.<br>  Developing Tangible Focus<br>  <br>  The second motivation killer is a lack of focus. How often do you focus on what you don’t want, rather than on a concrete goal? We normally think in terms of fear. I’m afraid of being poor. I’m afraid no one will respect me. I’m afraid of being alone. The problem with this type of thinking is that fear alone isn’t actionable. Instead of doing something about our fear, it feeds on itself and drains our motivation.<br>  <br>  If you’re caught up in fear based thinking, the first step is focusing that energy on a well defined goal. By defining a goal, you automatically define a set of actions. If you have a fear of poverty, create a plan to increase your income. It could be going back to school, obtaining a higher paying job, or developing a profitable website. The key is moving from an intangible desire to concrete, measurable steps.<br>  <br>  By focusing your mind on a positive goal instead of an ambiguous fear, you put your brain to work. It instantly begins devising a plan for success. Instead of worrying about the future you start to do something about it. This is the first step in motivating yourself to take action. When know what you want, you become motivated to take action.<br>  Developing Direction<br>  <br>  The final piece in the motivational puzzle is direction. If focus means having an ultimate goal, direction is having a day-to-day strategy to achieve it. A lack of direction kills motivation because without an obvious next action we succumb to procrastination. An example of this is a person who wants to have a popular blog, but who spends more time reading posts about blogging than actually writing articles.<br>  <br>  The key to finding direction is identifying the activities that lead to success. For every goal, there are activities that pay off and those that don’t. Make a list of all your activities and arrange them based on results. Then make a make an action plan that focuses on the activities that lead to big returns. To continue the example from above, a blogger’s list would look something like this:<br>  <br>     1. Write content<br>     2. Research relevant topics<br>     3. Network with other bloggers<br>     4. Optimize design and ad placements<br>     5. Answer comments and email<br>     6. Read other blogs<br>  <br>  Keeping track of your most important tasks will direct your energy towards success. Without a constant reminder, it’s easy to waste entire days on filler activities like reading RSS feeds, email, and random web surfing.<br>  <br>  When my motivation starts to wane, I regain direction by creating a plan that contains two positive actions. The first one should be a small task you’ve been meaning to do, while the second should be a long-term goal. I immediately do the smaller task. This creates positive momentum. After that I take the first step towards a|`|mHjPfszWaa	HI and I can't help you at all. I am in a funk and I can't get up and do anything either! Sorry!

Good guys stay virgins until they become bad guys. Typically the act of transition is when you pay for a hooker, losing your good guy status and virginity in one fall swoop.|`|qeYLthiVaa	I also wonder... (Funny thing, I was just about to ask that same question, when it said that somebody had asked that on the side thingy...LOL)|`|By1DJAUOaa	BAD GUYS- ALWAYS SEEM TO GOOD TO BE TRUE BUT AREN'T<br>  GOOD GUYS- THEY ARE SO HIDDEN AND YOU CAN NEVER FIND THEM|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	They tend to over exaggerate things.

Slept with tons of women because its a phase for them.  They get out all their agression, wildness, weird fetishes whatever on the bad ones and dont think they are worth marrying.  I think what girls love most is trying to tame a bad guy into a good one, then they marry them.|`|W2qyu5zFaa	Every girl knows they can't settle down with a bad guy. No girl wants to get hurt. I personally have never liked bad guys though. I didn't see a point in wanting to be with some one who wasn't good enough for me and didn't treat me right. I have more self respect than that.|`|DuSFKygEaa	Bad Guy =  Lots of fun and excitement.<br>  <br>  Good Guy = Not that much fun but she'll have a roof over her head, food on the table and a car.  Security.<br>  <br>  Really Good Guy = Combination of both but without the Police involvement.|`|1c6Jwbevaa	Its the way of the world women get treated like crap for years and then the marry us good guys and we get to deal with all the emotional problems that occur after the bad guys.|`|0QFKm3WLaa	The women date every type of guy till they find the right one (not in every case, of course).

They date good guys cause there nice and doesn't have to do anything about jail.|`|AA10241705	The same reason most men would rather date Ginger from "Gilligan's Island", but marry Mary Ann.|`|sPScyaF6aa	Same reason men date the "bad" girls but marry the "good" girls. You figure it out, lol.|`|ZawzpmaGaa	Cause the bad guys are just for the fun but good guys last you a life time.|`|bGtsDFxiaa	Because they're hypocrites.|`|XFctazuhaa	the bad guys brace us for the married life, so that why we already know that worst that can happen.|`|5Zcq3LXOaa	the bad men will leave you when you have a child<br>  SIMPLE|`|IpgzUP8Raa	cause most girls have an extreme lack of any hint of intelligence|`|tUSx6V0Paa	cuz bad guys are fun but good guys last a lifetime.|`|AA10413990	Thanks for asking. Some of these answers have been hilarious!!|`|GCF3k9mbaa	so far i've been stuck with all "bad"|`|Qlj2dnzhaa	Some people do it the other way round... and regret it. =P<br>  <br>  In my personal experience, I have ended up dating 'bad' guys because they're the most outgoing, charming ones. They are easy to spot, know exactly how to make you like them and have an indifferent attitude that, in the right men, is bizarrely compelling. Of course, this is usually because they have been out with lots of women before, know what they like and aren't too worried about whether you like them or not because there's more where you came from.<br>  <br>  Good guys are harder to find, usually don't approach you and initially don't seem as funny and charming. It often takes a while for you to realise their full potential. :D<br>  <br>  So there. Bad guys are fun, but would discard you if someone better came along, and good guys are for keeps. :)|`|CFFxtileaa	Because the man they marry always tends to be the 'good' guy for them, when they've found the 'good' guy, it just means they've found the right guy for them, and that means he is 'good'. For them at least,<br>  <br>  x|`|2tBJT53Kaa	Bad is exciting<br>  good is boring<br>  when they get hurt enough to learn that bad guys are bad for a reason.<br>  Duh and they say men are stupid!<br>  <br>  Men are simple.<br>  Women want a man to fulfill their every need.<br>  Men want every women to fulfill their one need.  LOL|`|tD0nI64xaa	Because we want the "bad" guys while we're still young, free, and wild.<br>  But to actually settle down, we'll marry "good" guys.<br>  Everyone has to grow up.|`|2WiKH3Hkaa	They date "bad" guys for fast times and they marry "good" guys to suck them dry and then toss them away.|`|qjzVEYL9aa	Dating is merely a selection of whom one wants to marry. (its an eliminating process)|`|dMS6uaxbaa	Because they're dumb and want to lose they're virginity in a way they'll regret it just to ***** about it later.|`|xbdrWhcZaa	because the good guys deserve better than a girl who would pick the "bad boy."|`|tIg3low2aa	They know the bad ones won't marry them!|`|QkzxVTikaa	Does it matter? Marriage is for losers, anyways.|`|6csDwEB5aa	because|`|NBT5PoRVaa	cuz their stupid jerks and hate me|`|st5reHVjaa	cause we know that we'd never marry a ''bad'' guy because they're not marriage material. they wont commit|`|gvnNy7Rtaa	Because bad guys won't stick around to keep you.

vV1hPhfWaa	Well, Che Guevarra most likely isn't in American textbooks because he had no direct influence on our history.  Granted, he was assasinated by the CIA.  But, I do believe that gets covered more in college courses.  I think it's pretty obvious that Malcolm X has little to no pagespace in textbooks because of a socio-political agenda and to a lesser extent, a religious agenda.  Some would call his policies extreme in that he promotes violence to combat violence.  His ideals are less about turning the other cheek and more about crackin the spines of the cheek slappers.  However, I'm sure the less ignorant teachers are more than willing to give an accurate account of his history.  It should be required information in my opinion though.|`|wyIccGvaaa	because people are racist butt monkeys!...<br>  it's Guevera :]|`|bb0487e3f4e58641a40d9c9b91ae1826aa	The people that approve the textbooks don't want them there.|`|7Ohs5ABCaa	They want to keep you pacified so you don't fight back.

Me and 3 other girls were playing beach volleyball in the background. I passed the ball to the girl across from me and she smacked it really hard. It bounced off my head and rolled to the front where the actors were reciting their lines. I laughed so hard that I started to pee my pants, and I immediately ran off the stage! It was sooo humiliating.|`|welQ5nSqaa	I have two.<br>  <br>  1.) Spring break me and my friend went to a resort with her mom and it was 10pm and her mom was out so we Cranked Kelly Clarkson and danced around like idiots and were watching our reflections on the glass and singing. And turns out the window was open and there was a group of guys outside watching us and listening to our horrible singing.<br>  <br>  2.) I went to this party with my older friend and I was to shy to dance and when my friend and these guys finally got me to dance I noticed this foul arm pit smell so the whole time I'm dancing I'm trying to keep my arms down, I ended up leaving after one dance. And here's the catch it wasn't even me that smelt it was the guy that we were dancing with! I felt to embarrassed for just leaving and bailing on my friend.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Caught my parents doing it in the kitchen at five in the morning once.

AA11543960	No. Marriage is pointless. You spend so much money on a silly ring, then invest even more dollars in a wedding that no one's going to remember anyway. Then five years later you're filing for divorce, which is considerably more expensive. You do not need to get married to stay committed to someone and to prove you love him or her. Sometimes its healthier for the relationship if the couple stays unmarried.|`|v86sOx7Gaa	Marriage from yesteryear and today are no where near the same. Today when most couples have problems they just tend to call it quits and don't try to work there problems out. But then again, unlike years gone by, if a spouse is in an abusive marriage they're not looked down upon for leaving the marriage.I also believe it's not necessary that couples have to get married to be committed.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Yes, only if the persons being married believe it is though. I believe my marriage is very strong, and we both (hubster & I) have strong marriage values now.<br>  <br>  I don't believe it's essential for couples to marry to be committed. I wasn't married for many years, but I was always committed to my relationship.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	no and no|`|iOYCCaoYaa	No. Marriage has changed too much! People aren't committed to one another any more! They don't even spend enough time together! Your second question, I think I covered it. Happy late Valentines Day!

It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to do so.  You are a role model to many girls your age.  Secondly, if you remain cold often you may want to consult your doctor.  You could possibly have a problem with your blood circulation.  It's usually not anything major but there are ways to help this by talking with a doctor.  Also, make sure you are wearing plenty of layers.  It's easy for your body temperature to change during the day because of the food you eat and the fluids you drink, as well as how active you are.  You can always try eating hot foods like casseroles, soups, chili, etc and drinking hot drinks like coffee or hot tea.  I hope this helps.|`|qe3NQIwgaa	go to the store and buy emergen-c  <br>  <br>  its in the vitimine section. its a blue and yellow box with packets inside. i think its like 8 dollars or so but it IS AMAZING!!!! you will not only feel better in like 15 mins, but you will be good for hours. then you need to mix another one with water.<br>  <br>  trust me you should be better in about 24 hours. <br>  <br>  my boyfriend builds windmills for a company, and they work very long hours, usually about 15-18 a day. when he or his buddys gets sick they drink thoes, and are fine.<br>  <br>  TRY THEM!!!!

You can say the plot was cliche`, but hey, it holds the box office record. Name one person who hasn't said "I'm the king of the world!" See, it plays one of the biggest roles in pop culture. Everyone makes "King of the World" Titanic/DiCaprio references. All in all, the movie is fantastic and my personal favorite.|`|Z4mLZxLcaa	Well my favorite movie has to be Fight Club<br>  because. What makes this movie so wonderful and my favorite movie is that. It as a film is that it has the potential to foment real and not just reel discussion about our society, our values and the man-woman wars. the movie also has solid acting And Edward Norton's performance is just shy of brilliant, the amazing direction, the special effects, the crazy twist and elaborate production design make Fight Club a wild ride and one of the greatest films of all time.

I don't care if you think the movie absolutely sucked, because it's somewhat true, but Stephenie Meyer is an awesome writer and I am so tired of people hating on her work.  I am not obsessed, and it is true that the girls obsessed with Twilight (and/or Edward Cullen) can be too over-the-top , but do not judge Twilight, series or movie, because of the crazed fans who just go overboard on their obsession.

B0avgIpRaa	1 ?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  #2  The Magic Of Ordinary Days - based on the novel by Ann Howard Creel (53rd in Collection) - <br>  <br>  1944. World War II. Colorado. Livy Dunne (Russell) has been thrown out of her home by her father, Rev. Dunne, because she's pregnant and unmarried. She's banished to rural Colorado, to go through with an arranged marriage to a lonely farmer, so her child will have a father. When she arrives in the tiny town, Livy and her betrothed are wary of each other. Worldly Livy is bored by Ray and the hardscrabble life he leads — ?despite his inherent goodness and wisdom. As the months pass, Livy learns more about this calm, practical self-effacing farmer. Slowly almost imperceptibly, Livy realizes she may have found "home" quite accidentally.<br>  <br>  Stars: Kerri Russell, Skeet Ulrich and Mare Winningham<br>  <br>  <br>  
c1fd95ce4f2271fcb56582108da06e9aaa	It sounds like you are remembering scenes from the same movie, "Love Comes Softly" with Katherine Heigl.  She is widowed when her husband falls off the horse and dies, then thrown into an arranged marriage with a farmer.  She is pregnant with her dead husbands child, and comes to fall in love with the new husband after a period of time.  It airs frequently on the Hallmark Channel.  It will be on again Nov. 8th.<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345591/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0345591/</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Comes_Softly" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Comes_...</a>

AA11760531	iPods don't have radios on them.  You can buy a radio transmitter for them.  I bought one at Target and it plugs into the bottom, where the charger goes, and it allows you to listen to the radio on your iPod.  It also comes with headphones; it cost me around $25, but I get my money's worth out of it. |`|0WCt5VdNaa	Um, Ipod's don't come with radios, and they don't evolve radios the longer you have them.<br>  <br>  If it didn't come with a radio, it's not ever going to have one.  Good luck finding an iPod with a radio.

For extra comfort. Thankfully my periods are not all that much anymore and I don't have them often anymore. They are slowing down. I am 31.|`|oRrwl7Zcaa	Both. <br>  Tampons tend to leak more but im able to move around without discomfort.<br>  And Pads because sometimes i just don't feel like shoving anything in the baby maker.<br>  |`|MbUXTe0oaa	Pads, I'm not comfortable with tampons. They just don't feel right to me.|`|PULQiKsJaa	tampons - you don't know they are there|`|A8CaVRWeaa	Tampons all the way. When I used to wear pads, I used to feel dirty and feel a bit degraded because I personally felt like I was wearing a nappy! Now that I wear tampons, they are discreet and cleaner too. Also if you insert tampons properly, you cannot feel them.<br>  <br>  Also! You shouldnt have to restrict your lifestyle just because you are on your period. Tampons allow you to do what you want when you want, eg, swimming.|`|3aV4lcCqaa	After having an operation they said use pads for a while and i never went back to tampons - only when i am on holiday. i dont have really heavy bleeds anyway so its not like i am sitting in a pool of blood anyway.  also, i worry that i might get toxic shock syndrome or forget its in there so pads for me. |`|fnww1lHiaa	pads for bedtime because having a tampon in for many hours can cause complications. my friend had a tampon get stuck in her and they had to do a sugery to get it out. theres a warning lable i think on the box for how long to leave it in. but tampons are good for during the day when you need to be active and not feel like your wearing a diaper!|`|i976XDKVaa	tampons... you dont notice it at all and u feel totally safer... u can run, jump and swim with they in and u totally dont feel it...<br>  i rekon its way more comfortable and its way better...<br>  plus its less to dispose of and carry around...<br>  its easier cause u dont have to dispose as much, and u arent sitting in ur stuff! and its cleaner...<br>  tampons are wayy better :D|`|Y7Amc5pHaa	tampons are much more comfortable and you can go swimming in them but pads are less scary ... lol... pads are good when you start out but they do feel like nappies at times... make sure u get a gd brand like U because its thin but good... but never, EVER swim with pads on... its festy. lol<br>  <br>  xxx|`|GQVo184caa	Depends on the situation. I wear a tampon to work or when I'm out, but if I'm just sitting around at home, I'll usually wear a pad. I admit, SOME do feel like diapers...but the thinner ones are not so bad. However, they all feel nasty when they are soaked! |`|AA10942669	Pads.<br>  Tampons feel weird. Imagine having something stuck in you and hanging down for the day...and you KNOW its absorbing. AGH.

It DOES NOT feel like you are wearing a diaper.  You barley even notice its there plus its safer.  Wait to go swimming after your period, geez.|`|aXZEZylUaa	Tampons.  I like to load them with little firecrackers for major effect when I explode in anger.|`|44d1bd70ebb6dde45e70346ef061d012aa	Tampons; They absorb more and with a towel they are just messy to clean up after (sorry!)|`|q13MVn5laa	coz it helps them for their periods<br>  it absorbs the blood and doesn't leak|`|RBP1fVzXaa	pads at home<br>  <br>  tampons when i'm out..
RVuKX5Biaa	yeah i know how that is. you need to just keep practicing. get better. start singing in front of people little by little. |`|h6SQubTLaa	it's easier said than done but it's all about "baptism by fire".  You have to sing in front of people every opportunity you get... for your teacher, family, friends, concert, etc. The more you sing in front of people the more you get used to it... if you know you're good, then people will enjoy it and you'll get over any self-criticism you have.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh and always be prepared for what you're going to perform|`|WyCUIsABaa	focus on music and sing your heart out AND SOMEONE PLZ ANSWER MY QUESTION ON ASKING THE BOY I LIKE OUT|`|3d65ce43ba27d8d0d29bb7d9241e044caa	Hey, I'm sorta in the same boat...I sing actually quite a bit at church, and being up there so much and singing lead has helped I think to help get over the shyness. Now I won't say I'm over it totally, but it has helped...Also, I think if you sorta close your eyes when you sing, and don't really look directly at your audience all the time, or even focus on the back of the room, looking past the people--I do that sometimes. I think over time, you'll adjust to singing in front of people...just start getting out there and doing it.

Y1aAGPURaa	Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while out shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite traumatic. Don't be naive enough to think it couldn't happen to you or your friends.<br>  <br>  Here's how the scam works:<br>  <br>  Two seriously good-looking 20-21 yr old girls come over to your car as you are packing your bags into the trunk. They both start wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. Its impossible not to look. When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say 'No' and and instead ask you for a ride to McDonald's.<br>  <br>  You agree and they get in to the back seat. On the way, they start undressing. Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and starts crawling all over you while the other one steals your wallet.<br>  <br>  I had my wallet stolen December 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, and again on the 17th, 20th, 24th &29th. Also January 1st & 4th. Twice on the 8th, again on the 16th, and 20th, two times yesterday and very likely again this upcoming weekend.  So tell your friends to be careful.<br>  <br>  P.S. Walmart has wallets on sale for 2.99.|`|zZ0gU40Kaa	there are two guys in a elevator, and one says to the other;<br>  <br>  "There is this awesome joke I know! It's hilarious! Well, there once was this blonde..." <br>  <br>  The other guy interrupts him and says;<br>  <br>  "In case you haven't noticed, I am blonde."<br>  <br>  So the other guy says;<br>  <br>  "Oh sorry!" And starts again, really slowly.<br>  <br>  "TTTTHHHHHEEERREEEE OOOOOONNNNCCCCCEEE WWWASSSSS THHHHIIIIISSSSS BBBBLLLLOOOOONNNDDDDEEEE..."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BTW; If you are blonde, this is not meant as an insult in anyway.
fIEmi84Laa	Instead of just singing, try doing vocal exercises for thirty minutes. There's alot of videos on Youtube and there's a guy called Eric Arceneaux who has some good advice. You can't just sing, because you might be singing the wrong way and that won't help at all. Drink alot of water and if you can't afford going to singing lessons forever, try it for a short time. It's really worth it. You can try investing in a book like Singing For Dummies (comes with a CD).<br>  <br>  DON'T SING WITHOUT WARMING UP.|`|KrkftOfkaa	Depends.  If you have "bad habits" in singing then you will only reinforce those bad habits.  If you are doing everything "properly" you will be reinforcing the good habits.  Like anything that you need to train and practice for if you do so with bad habits then that is what you are going to learn.  Have you had voice/singing lessons or worked in a regular choir that has tried to teach you proper methods?  It wouldn't be a bad idea if you haven't.<br>  <br>  IIRC:  John Bon Jovi had to retrain his singing voice in the late 80s early 90s.  He was singing "wrong" and was going to destroy his voice if he kept up what he was doing.|`|WJcH24xCaa	Yes.  If you have proper training and practice every day you will get better.  If you put in the effort there's no way you can't improve.<br>  *Just make sure you warm up poperly and drink heaps of water.<br>  Good Luck!|`|mAjyNjV5aa	yes it should but this book has helped me a lot.  hope it helps you to!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Singing-Style-www-borntosingmusic-com/dp/B0018JJ1RU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235073451&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Sin...</a>|`|NlYGbqnkaa	You might not get better but you will get more comfortable about singing in front of others. In turn you will sound better.|`|qvHllIgeaa	I think that you would be better off getting a singing couch because they have experience .|`|GKUme2asaa	yes u should because if you sing every day then it could be possible : ).

Go to a Radio Shack or maybe even a Wal*Mart or Best Buy and buy the correct adaptor. It shouldn't be much money and if your docking station is worth the money, it's worth saving.<br>  <br>  You can also find on Craigslist or eBay; or go to the site for the manufacturer. They'll probably have a tech support or parts section where you can order the correct adaptor.<br>  -a guy named duh|`|fMCpNalNaa	yes this is dangerous.you need to take precaution|`|00b1157f788b43beca78be0761b70101aa	In fact it's better because in a 9volt cord the wires are thicker and will take a higher current than the 7.5volt and that way it's not likely to get hot or cause a problem.|`|yPOdBF52aa	i don't think it should blow up or anything crazy. im in conceptual physics right now so i should know but id give it a try anyway

I used to like Nsync alot when they were popular (their music..I didnt like Justin until he got a solo career then I had a crush on him for a few months) but i only like a few of their songs now. plus I do not know of their personalities but the JB I have seen alot on what makes them who they are and they are regular funny guys with a good heart. JB band is better because they have instruments and they write more of their songs. they are also way more attractive. after having a solo career Justin was only pretty good looking for a while so my crush on him was small.|`|zLilrd1Haa	Britney spears....ik but i hate them both but britney has had more experience.  plus miley cyrus said that she recently cut her uvula.

Even though mostly men have this crazy idea that the jonases are terrible, they write their own music, play their own music, they tour more than nysnc.  so even if haters give this a thumbs down or whatev, i give them credit and i think they are awesome.  people who hate these guys just don't know whut to do with their lives and just feel like they need to hate something to get anger out or something.|`|kmzCMDlHaa	Britney Spears and Nsync!

Ihi0lR1Taa	This soap is the cause of my Sin Senos No Hay Paraiso running only 30mins.  I purposely turn it off as soon as I see it coming on ( I don't need another novela to get hooked on) but Wikipedia says...<br>  <br>  El Cartel de los Sapos (English title: The Cartel of Snitches) or El Cartel is a Colombian Telenovela that first aired on June 4, 2008 on the Colombian network Caracol TV. It is based on the book by the same name by Andrés Lopez Lopez, alias Fresita, (a former drug dealer), who wrote the book while his years in prison. In his book, he writes about his experiences while in the Cartel and what happened within the cartel "El Norte del Valle". In the TV series, each character from the book and the locations were changed. "El Cartel", stars Manolo Cardona, Karen Martinez, Diego Cadavid and Robinson Diaz.<br>  <br>  I have seen comercials and it looks pretty good.

If you are bootlegging them or seeing them on computer, which is illegal, I guess you can watch Bride wars. There's really no "action" but lots of girl fighting and plenty of laughs. That's PG.

Depending on if you're just visting somewhere and you pick up local accents. Or, jsut someone you just met or someone you know? Because if it's someone you just met that is kind of embarassing because they could take it as you picking on them. Me, I picked up a southern accent from being in SC after 2 days. And went back and had it right away again because it's just what I knew there. But no one said anything because I hadn't talked to any of them before that..lol|`|3BfNshHYaa	Oh yeah, same thing without the accent.  Whenever I hang out with someone for a while, I start to do things that they do.  Like my friend does a lot of hand motions, so I started doing that too without noticing.

4GiIXWUXaa	No, I could not.<br>  <br>  If it got to the point that either/or wanted to see other people OR was interested in other people, it would be time to call it quits, for a while or for good. I would never cross the line into infidelity, granted that is only technically possible in a marriage or during the course of engagement, but still ... i would never.<br>  <br>  I also am too mature to play games like i am in High School and be a female philanderer. Neither do i tolerate that kind of behaviour from the man i may be with.<br>  <br>  I am by no means a jealous person. I do not treat (BFs/SOs whatever you want to call them) as if they are three years old. He's a grown man, not my child. I do not make a fuss over his having female friends, or ... his wanting to go and socially spend time with friends (even if it includes female friends); I do not make a fuss over who calls him, i don't expect (or like) to be called every day or 50 times a day ... so i do not require, demand or expect that. I also do not do that to him.<br>  I don't demand money, i work hard and will pay my own bills and buy what i want with my own money. I do not demand, request or expect "presents" "dinners" or whatever else. I do not demand time every week/weekend or his compliance to all of my needs; If he wants to spend a Sunday and watch Football all day with his friends, brilliant! My attitude is: you go for it. I will be home, and have a great time.<br>  I am actually very laid back about it (relationships) because i enjoy my own personal time, and time with my own friends just as much as i am certain that he does. Relationships require compromise yes, but one shouldn't have to give up their hobbies and interests solely to appease the other. It's give and take, 50/50.<br>  <br>  Also, I am very much in favour of honesty, trust and respect being at the core of any relationship. Without those things, it'll never work.<br>  Every person has "rules" LOL so, my general feelings and basic rules are as follows: I do not treat you [him] like a child, therefore do not treat me as though i am one. I am not your [his] property, you do not own me and I can leave and call it quits at any given time; the same applies to you [him.] IF for any reason you [he] is/are unhappy, please let me know and i will do what i can to make you [him] happy. IF for any reason "this" (whatever "this" is or may be) is not working out then it is what it is, we can call it quits, no worries. ((** FLICK ! **)) lol.<br>  <br>  Also, I may forgive you [him] for just about all else, but do not lie to me. If you lie, it's over. If you "cheat" on me, it's over; since i gave you the option of being able to talk to me about how you felt, and "taking a break" from the relationship IF and when you [he] wanted. So, cross either of those two lines, and you're done.<br>   <br>  I will not yell, scream or cry. I'll just walk out of your life and never come back; and i won't even acknowledge that you exist. It's really that simple. ((** FLICK ! **)) lol.<br>  <br>  So, as mentioned No, no no never; never would i be unfaithful. If i am unhappy i say so, if the differences cannot be worked out and i am still unhappy, (or he is) i call it quits; maturely of course. ((** FLICK ! **)) lol.<br>  <br>  There is never a reason to lie, and there is never a reason to be unfaithful. If he can't keep it in his pants than he is not for me. If he is dishonest, he is not for me. :)<br>  I'm a grown woman. I have no qualms about giving any man the ..... ((** FLICK ! **)) LOL! ;P<br>  <br>  xoxo ?<br>  <br>  PS: And you know that by "you" i am not meaning you personally (obviously) but generally in reference to "him" (the BF/SO/Whateva ...) lol|`|Xzs6X7sZaa	Would I?

If people want to help then you start an organization that can help the cause you're going for. People shouldn't depend on the government for everything. They can't fix everything that's why it's a democracy so the people can do something about their lives that the government can't fix.

QJTOvC98aa	I could say the same thing about people faking Southern accents.    I get ticked every time I watch a movie/show and someone has the worst fake Southern accent - i.e. that lady in Private Practice.|`|S4W7FojCaa	But Bale and Ledger are americans...what accent are they supposed to have for the roles?And it just pisses you off...if they can do a good accent then I don't mind. It doesn't take the feeling out of the movie for me.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	No one is twisting your arm to see these movies. Vote with your wallet and don't go see movies like this if it offends you.|`|gOecloPMaa	You are aware the films you hinted were nominated for Oscars?    If you watched The Dark Knight and focused on Ledgers accent, then you need help.    Talent over nationality.|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	How come Hollywood keeps hiring Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Venezuelans, etc etc etc to play Mexican or Mexican/American Characters?    Lou Diamond Phillips plays the famous Mexican American Ritchie Valens in "La Bamba". He's Filipino!!!    Benjamin Bratt plays a Mexican American gangster in "Blood in Blood Out". He's from PERU!!!!    Al Pacino plays a Cuban in "Scarface", he's ITALIAN!!!!    That's just the way it goes my friend.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	You didnt post a question so I wont post an answer. This is a global forum so you should stay outta here, keep to yourself in U.S.A not the same as america... Got it ?|`|MM8rqTMtaa	I'll take Ledger's Joker over Nicholson's any day.  I get pissed at Hollywood lumping all asians together.  Japanese actors playing chinese or korean characters because Americans don't know the difference.  How many Japanese actresses were in Memoirs of a Geisha?  None.

HgRYP3cJaa	that's just stupid, but a lot of ppl get reported for silly things.  I think we should rise up.  Yes, i would challenge that.|`|RmIeoU7raa	The same thing happened to my fiance.  I think you definitely should protest.  You didn't say anything offensive what so ever|`|Zz1HI5VHaa	Yes dispute it. Worst case scenario is you lose.

You'll never stop the idiots. Let it go.|`|FDt7cC8haa	no, you're the goof....    what the hell were you thinking?|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Some of the things they deem inappropriate is beyond me.Should you protest? My guide is this "is the reward of winning greater than the output of energy in complaining". You have to judge.
Cp6ACouDaa	Yes mame I have, on several different occasions.|`|wzue5Xzbaa	Not lately.|`|AA10409668	No.  I don't even bother anymore.  I'm a firm believer that "truth always prevail"  --------------------
mMmNEljxaa	Well I was finishing off a pub crawl after a full on Mexican meal in Edinburgh, Scotland. My friends and I were waiting for a taxi I thought I would get some cancer sticks from the machine whilst I wait, on fiddling for my change ￡10 fell out onto the floor. This @rsehole of a geezer stood on it knowingly.... at this point the taxi arrived fairly fecking quickly...... Good job too because I had enough booze in me to fight ANYONE! And when I asked him politely to move his foot because my money was under there, the Scumbag replied "what tenner?" I asked once more whilst getting a bit annoyed but my idiot friends were shouting for me to get into the Taxi ARGHHH!!! I couldn't do a thing, but I sure would of given him a Glasgee kiss on the forehead it would have broken his ribs or nose if I jumped I would have had to fight them all, bollocks# to that and reluctantly walked away.|`|TT0rCi8kaa	I was in Bristol, on a night out, and on the way to meet some friends at Lakota, and two young lads stepped out in front of me, and demanded i give them all my money. I told them I had no money, and one of them pulled out a knife. I smiled at him, (always disconcerting) and told him to "piss off or I'll take that knife off you and stick it up yer erse" His friend backed off, and i stepped towards him, and slapped the knife out of his hand, and when he bent to pick it up, I kicked him in the face. They both ran off, I picked up the knife, carried on to Lakota, where I handed the Knife to the doorman, and told him what had happened. <br>  The doorman then let me in for nothing, and I had a brilliant night. <br>  So the moral of the story is, ...well, I don't know, just don't try to mug me!|`|Pgam2HLuaa	Arise Lord Percy, the Penniless Pensioner.<br>  <br>  Actually, I can top even Pensioner Percy's tale of woe. A few years back, I went out on a four day bender with some chums (usual stuff, , intellectual discussion, reading pretentious poetry, a container load of gin and a bus load of Romanian gypsy girls) only to wake up and find that all of my internal organs had been stolen. I was jolly cross, I can tell you!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I suggest you give Maureen the 10 points. She sounds a right old boiler when she's had a few and she's clearly still spoiling for a fight.|`|ec38f4feb12dd01422eeeeb1fa7ed784aa	I most certainly have, every month the government rob my pensions, was it not sufficient that they took tax off my earnings, was it not sufficient that they taxed the contributions that I payed into a system that steals it? no !! they tax it once again. 200 years ago they would have been on Tyburn Hill waiting for the hangman, for that was the end for highway robbers. It isn't as if it was a great deal of money, it is the widows mite, they should hang their heads in shame. I fought for Queen and country for 28 years and locked up dangerous people for 18 years so those bastards could sleep with their wives / boyfriends (or both) safely at night. they repay that debt by stealing your pension.|`|nooi0ldjaa	i've never been robbed, but i've had stuff stolen from me<br>  <br>  but i got it back :)|`|olGdiTnVaa	<a href="http://theenvelope.latimes.com/media/photo/2007-02/27793109.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://theenvelope.latimes.com/media/pho...</a>|`|u3xDS7i8aa	i was robbed of my intelligence|`|LxYQccQ3aa	N|`|B2Itq6Fcaa	yes<br>  <br>  was at my car out in stop and shop somewhere in or near boston my freidns went in i stayed in the car windows done taking a little nap guy  put the knife in and by my throat and asked for my girls pocked book which was on the passenger seat<br>  <br>  i opened the door real fast knocked him away and knocked him down and stomped him. ppl from around came were confused but in the end he ran away and he left the knife so i took it was a nice knife<br>  <br>  no, but the basterd left a big dent on my new car i was pissed|`|1EyRZm4Faa	I was really really drunk one day, and I was sorta being stupid, cause my friend was trying to help me(You're awesome dude) Though I pulled away really quickly and I fell right into a glass table, I was really drunk though all I remeber was broken glass everywhere, Me bleeding then I was in the hospital. There was some **** that went on at the hospital, though the people stole my gamecube (wasn't even mine), a pack of cigarettes, my gameboy and a bong (wasn't mine ether).  <br>  <br>  I had a few suspitions of who it was, though I could never really tell who...I was so smashed that day.|`|RluCMVUSaa	Yes, yes I have... Ted he stole my heart and we are in a game of cat and mouse that will hopefully never end though I did catch him long enough to drag him to the alter.<br>  <br>  The extent of my being robbed was having my truck broken into.  The people were idiots though they missed all of the speakers and equipment under/behind the seats and couldn't get the deck out of the dash so ended up just breaking it and ripping the face plate off.  They made off with about $20.00 in cash, all of the CD's the face plate and a knife.  We have extra coverage for the audio equipment so we got a new window and stereo and a camera system... since the camera system no one has messed with the cars/house.|`|rPywKtJRaa	Yes, my car was broken into they stole about 500 CD's my CD/Radio player, a spring jacket and a bible which was in a case so they probably thought it was more CD's.  They were never caught.  When I lived with my parents the house was broken into and they found a safe box of money with probably over 1500.00 in it.  The funny part is that I think it was one of my best friends that did it.  Never trust a crack head...never.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other then that Scoundy keeps stealing my knickers, right off my body too!|`|qvW5ZYruaa	A man came up to me and said "Hand over your money"<br>  He didn't take anything. <br>  He weren't caught but man was it funny. Every self-respecting thief knows not to rob a girl wearing dirty jeans and an 'I Am McLovin' t-shirt.|`|LDv4dqLraa	Some years back I was doing a children's show and I had a ventriloquist dummy robbed from my dressing room - the thief was never found and neither was the dummy. All that was left was a top hat.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  BE: hee hee <sniggers cheekily>

(First Middle and Last).<br>  <br>  I am UNIQUE.<br>  <br>  xoxo ?<br>  <br>  PS: There are only about 100 listings for people who share my same 1st & Last name in combo (and some of them are multiple listings from various places of residence; I have 2 listings accredited to me). There are only appoximately 45 people who share my first and last name combination, in the US (not sure about the world though lol). But no one else (unless they're frauds) has my entire Full Give Name.  Again, I AM Unique. :P|`|C9etNNBAaa	that's all true but <br>  no one is the same.<br>  not even twins.<br>  so everyone is unique in their own way.<br>  material wise yeah we aren't.

I only have the circuitous edge of what the press has said....once anything has hit the press it is watered down or diametrically it is blown far out of proportion. I reserve judgment in this situation as 1) I wasn't there 2) I don't know if it was for publicity or any other contrived reason 3) If what I have heard is even in any way correct......and to be honest i am NOT holding my breath. This is none of my affair & though the reports have been sketchy leaning toward him having done it.... the two of them are the ones that know better than anyone else what happened. Media saturation can make any of us have a knee jerk response.....they are two of the luminaries who are current and happening. I will leave the answers to the experts and conclude by saying that there is NEVER a good reason to abuse anyone.<br>  <br>  Garbo

A03NJA26aa	I was wondering the same thing. It's my guess something from Africa or maybe after all the years later, the damaged kidney from when he got stabbed is no longer working. Who knows, it's been a while. I hope he doesn't die, he is my favorite, just seeing him hooked up to machines has me worried!|`|E6OPEYQ0aa	Carter did NOT lose a kidney when he was stabbed.  Benton was antsy to remove it to stem the internal bleeding, but cooler heads prevailed and Anspaugh convinced him to save it.  After they were successful in getting the kidney to profuse, Anspaugh said that "he could have lived with one kidney, but I didn't have the heart to tell him."|`|LDQj2A8iaa	Yes, that was a dialysis machine.  Dialysis has absolutely no relation to leukemia which relates to the while blood cells.  Dialysis filters toxins out of the blood when the kidneys cannot.  I would like to know what has caused Carter's kidney problems leading to the need for dialysis.|`|aDOkQs8paa	I just read on another spoiler website that Carter is having dialysis on his one remaining kidney (lost the other one in the stabbing that left Lucy dead).  Apparently it's not working well and he needed to come back to the States to get treatment.  He goes to Northwestern for the treatment where Dr. Benton (Eric LaSalle) runs into him....  I am glad to see him (Carter) back....  he and Anthony Edwards were my favorites...just hasn't been the same since then.|`|7KEhZelvaa	yes it was a dialysis machine, I have been searching the web this morning trying to find out why. He said that Kem was in Paris visiting her mother and that she was fine but it does make you wonder if they are still together. I have watched every season of ER since its inception in the early 90's I thought that Carter had either lost a kidney or it was severely damaged in the stabbing. If he didn't lose it it would partially explain why he was on dialysis. It doesn't look like it is a one time treatment so it is a prolonged problem. Hopefully they will give us the answers we are looking for very soon. I am glad to see that he is back regardless|`|bJqtNHV0aa	Either way, his kidney was damaged. So either it has failed, or he picked up something in Africa. Im also assuming that he and Kem are not together otherwise Im pretty sure that she would be there to help him thru all this. Isnt it poetic that they brought him back on Valentine's day, the same time that he was stabbed. I also read on another thread that they are going to bring Doug and Carol back. It was mentioned that there would be a large reunion, but to attend Carter's funeral. So sad if that is true...|`|VCtTEHqhaa	i thought it was dialysis too. maybe he has kidney failure from when he was addicted to the pain meds after the stabbing (where he lost 1 kidney from that)|`|FyJXKUCXaa	it seems like he has kidney failure. remember he has only one kidney. the other he lost when he and Lousy where stabbed.|`|ETcBRko3aa	Yes.  So, he has something that is leading to kidney failure......<br>  <br>  Probably AIDS since he has been working in Africa in AIDS clinics.  AIDS does cause renal (kidney) failure.<br>  <br>  I looked on the internet and I could not find a spoiler to next week's episode.

To many cultures, astronomers and things have all pointed to the same year and date. Who knows? It has something to do with a shift in the universe on this date but why it is suppose to cause the end i dont know. I guess we will all have to wait and see and have a end of the world party the weekend before.  lol.|`|lfNk8MaFaa	Absolutely nothing.  o Uo|`|ilHtdYdTaa	The same thing that happens every year.|`|5l5eCRdOaa	All the planets are suppose to be in line and create a crazy gravity for us.

sR7jM0UCaa	I'm getting really irritated with some of the people in my school. I don't know...maybe it's me but I don't really like it when someone tell me to smile and be cheerful when I just don't feel like it. I appreciate the fact that they want me to be happy but they just don't understand. It's not that easy. I'm trying my best but somehow, it doesn't feel right. I don't think they know exactly how it feels when you feel like you have this massive load inside your body that's pulling you down. It's not that easy to just pull yourself together and pretend that everything is alright. It's not and if I ignore it, it will find its own way back to me.<br>  I want and wish that I could pretend that everything is fine but to be honest, I'm pretty scared.<br>  <br>  =[|`|7QGVRViJaa	I'm havin guy trouble.

There's not much you can do about it other than not hanging around with the guy again.|`|Up6wkVLvaa	If your really that disgusted by a (hypothetical) erection at the age of 14 I'm afraid you're probably likely to turn out to be a lesbian.|`|AA11536708	Just stay away from him.

P0Fjh59Eaa	That's what it looked like to me. Looked like Lucas went to Daniel's apartment and Chloe was there...and then BOOM.<br>  <br>  have no idea, but gezz i'm PISSED OFF that they allowed Lucas to fall off the wagon over Chloe, are you kidding me!! after all the crap he went through w/Sami and he stays strong all the sudden because of Chloe he becomes weak? wtf EVER!|`|XRPtuwoTaa	looked that way to me.  Hopefully Lucas had nothing to do w/ it.  Maybe it's someone from Dr Dan's past who's not happy w/ him shacking up in Salem|`|WyxxDgSeaa	Earlier in the show, a fire alarm went off in Doctor Pervert's apartment and the manager said it was a false alarm. Apparently, it wasn't!  When Dr Pervert left to go to the hospital, leaving Chloe to wait for him, the camera showed something outside his apartment, like a radiator or heater or something. That must be what exploded. Chloe blew one way and maybe the clueless Lucas blew the other way, if he was still outside the door shouting. These three can all blow away as far as I'm concerned. But now, I suppose there will be yet another boo hoo session at the Bradys Only Hospital.  LOL

apwmvXuMaa	Just don't have sex in public & the rest is in good standing with me.|`|gLJBnqYmaa	It's okay as long as all clothes are on and no kids under like 10-12 are watching.|`|gij21Eyhaa	It's okay, so long it's not so obscene<br>  for all.|`|Amkmles0aa	we need to stay out of it|`|fEfNcumxaa	i prefer attraction|`|95uXmC94aa	It's alright with me. Sometimes you glance by mistake and it's embarassing. If it's gets carried away I mind it because of the kids around.

But I dont mind when other people do it as long as its not over the top.|`|aeODdMATaa	It doesn't bother me, as long as they keep the clothes on.|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	As long as she is giving me the kisses. I care not who she is. lol It's ok as long as they don't take it too far.|`|W1xs3vYBaa	It depends on what you mean by affection and the degree.<br>  <br>  Making out is inappropriate because it means that there is a transfer of bodily fluids, which is unhygienic and unsightly. Pecks are fine in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Holding hands, arms, bums is fine as you walk. Stroking each other, groping, and making each other noticeably aroused crosses a line. <br>  <br>  Sex crosses the line.|`|r3o10XbAaa	I don't care that much, but sometimes it can get really annoying. for example, my brother and his girlfriend are always touching each other in sex. my brothers like touching her boobs and she's just laughing, and their kissing and stuff like that, when your trying to hang out with them because they invited you, it just gets old.|`|Y864Eegjaa	it depends if its just small affection it doesnt matter but if its like slobbering all over each other thats really annoying|`|tLVZXLRSaa	If its holding hands or just a peck, I don't mind. But if you're slobbering and groping each other, get the hell out of my sight.|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	I don't mind it if it's the right people and not a real old couple or something like that! That's just creepy!|`|BXbnLxNJaa	as long as they arent borderline making love right in front of me I really dont mind.|`|0427afd3b8a595188f3d1223ecf1fb2aaa	I don't mind.<br>  But a little goes a long way when you're not on the receiving end.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	If they are being really disgusting I hate it...but maybe if it's just a little bit affectionate, I'm fine with it.

WOOOOOOO! People emotions are nothing to freak with!  And yes, accountability is necessary in order for some to stop!<br>  <br>  I have not anyone slandering me yet, thankfully, as my contacts goes. But I feel like this: If you got a problem with someone, take it in private. Don't make mass media out of it on here for others to read. All that does is whoever is doing it, it is going to make that person look bad for doing that!<br>  <br>  Well, dealing with what I deal with in personal life, I learned not to be shocked when bad things happen to me socially speaking. Actually, out of seriousness, when something GOOD happens to me socially speaking, I can go into cardiac arrest and it's very trying not to be skeptical!|`|2fGHF3RQaa	Yes,  that would surprise me., I don't think I have any contacts that would do that, and  I don't like it when people are rude and nasty to any of my friends/contacts when their answering  their questions. There's no reason for them to be disrespectful, and I always give them a thumbs down.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Most definitely!|`|utTFiz3gaa	you bet i do! i would me more than shocked actually|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	It has happened to a contact i know! But there are a few that it would surprise me if they did!|`|AA10554783	Yes I would, i had one that turned on me and then slandered other contacts, I wish yahoo would hold people in account that like to slander others to cause paranoia and gossip.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Yeah, a couple<br>  <br>  Better not think about it FFAF.................... :p|`|UjPArJZ6aa	If they turned on me or other contacts?

f1VOXfvBaa	I think some (not the Jonas Brothers, of course) have a bit of talent, but not enough that they would get anywhere without Disney behind them. Also, Disney makes them all sing ridiculous music.<br>  <br>  And what always ends up happening to these Disney stars once they become too old is:<br>  <br>  they either vanish off the face of the earth, and have to fend for themselves with little education or real experience, or<br>  <br>  they become Britney Spears.<br>  <br>  But personally, I do not hate most of the current Disney stars (Not counting the Jonas Brothers- I DO hate them).|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	i hate them all so very much|`|9ilXVowLaa	i try not to|`|CArzkDIUaa	I think they make bad decisions on who they let in|`|fEfNcumxaa	they humans|`|FCRX9MJMaa	I totally agree with you.

The only people from Disney that actually had any talent were Raven Symone and Kyla Pratt, and all the others are pathetic. I can never understand why America is so hung up these silly little kids' bands that are mainly for 10yo girls. It's sickening. Anyone that finds their music interesting needs to have his/her ear removed, because they don't know good music...It bothers me that the Jonas Brothers actually call themselves a ROCK band.|`|356aee609aa08102078a2960b94765e9aa	I don't know...I mean I wouldn't call their music fake.  I remember when I was a teeny bopper I was listening to Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys.  It's just fun music, not all music has to have a deep meaning.  It can just be there for the sole purpose of getting you to dance.  The people who listen to it are young and that's all they really need at that point in their lives.|`|NlXWdRcQaa	You're my new best friend :P  I hate them too.  They have no talent whatsoever.  They're overrated, and they're annoying also.  I don't care what other people think about them, I don't hate on people who like them though.  I accept people for who they are and not what they listen to.  ?|`|Z4pj79fDaa	I hate disney bands and singers . They're songs are pointless and stupid.

There seems to be a lack of musical talent in the Disney bands. Their fan base seems to be the very young generation to the tween age.

Ned was too much of a good guy for her. Since then she's made some really bad choices. Ric? And Jerry? Too ridiculous! Diane may be with a mob bodyguard, but he's sweet and loving. I wish that Alexis would fall for a nice guy for once.|`|xYTagSIyaa	She was married to Jax once and that worked well for them both as they kind of did it for fun and not as a serious marriage.  The character Alexis has her set personality to like the bad guys though and if she were to fall for someone nice, she would be playing out of character.<br>  Alexis is both good and bad and she is interesting, who knows maybe she will get together with Ethen, even though he is much too young for her.

ELbs3Dpwaa	The time leading up to the rupture are very painful.  You can't stand up straight, fever, throwing up.  Miserable.  After hours or days, depending on the individual, the pain will become excruciating as the appendix swells with infection to its maximum size.  Once it bursts the pain ends immediately.  Unfortunately, the infection has now been splattered all over your insides and will kill you.  Doctors have to go in and clean out your insides, you are on antibiotics for a long time, stay in the hospital for a week or more, and have a longer recovery time than if it was removed before the rupture.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	It must hurt pretty badly.<br>  <br>  The acid that gets released is extremely dangerous for the organs.<br>  <br>  As said above, you'll be in agony a few hours before it leads to an eruption.|`|yB3Jek85aa	yeah that's your organ so im sure it going to hurt|`|AA10098461	You sweat profuselyy, you get a fever, you throw up a lot and your eyes fall back in your head....you feel it!|`|QpPzXqIVaa	if your appendix bursts, you die within minutes. hopefully they'll have taken it out by that point...<br>  i'm sure you would feel it.|`|b4twAWp7aa	Yes, it happened to me.

91a2b9fe0d0ef5781c3a0beca8dcdd82aa	i do believe in God. but probably different than you. i think of Him as a force, not a Being. but He is leading us to a bright future.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	I've been effectually called by the Holy Spirit to be one of God's people.<br>  <br>  That's the best explanation I can give.|`|I1K6SC43aa	Yes, I believe in God.|`|HQKfZEKxaa	I don't. Whoop.|`|CYVGvfeOaa	I say YES LORD YES LORD YES YES LORD AMEN!<br>  <br>  because i trusted in him once and he delivered me. perhaps we are making a mistake, but i believe that God exists and he is the one and only. also, there is historical proof of the miracles Jesus did and that the Bible is historically correct. It was a long lesson we had so i don't remember the specifics, but yeah. I mean, not believeing due to not knowing is not your fault, but when you have the Bible telling you GOD EXISTS and giving you facts and not to mention the fact that God loves you no matter what makes it unexcuseable to deny it.<br>  <br>  i have had a bunch of second thoughts but i guess i just learned to trust god and that when you give him your worries, life seems so much better. i know i've made a bunch of mistakes and god has helped me through all of them. whether i realized it or not. which i do eventually realize about two years later or so.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	I believe in god.

ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Rebekkah, Who ever said that calm MUST be boring? One CAN find a LOT of pleasure in a nice calm day and still not be bored, my dear friend. At some point in our lives, we reach a point where we do NOT have to be constantly running around in order to have excitement in our lives. One can get a lot of excitement from reading an exciting book. One can find excitement in a calm walk through the woods, simply wandering and discovering new and different animals and plants. ONe can find excitement in laying back and watching the night sky in a calm and serene manner.<br>  <br>  At my stage of life, I have found that it is the BORED people who tend to be the sole source of their own boredom. These are the people who seem to have to live their lives constantly on the go, al the time. They are unable to find excitement in the common little, everyday things that keep us going from day to day. It is almost as thought they find that it is themselves that they can't stand to be near and need the attention of others in order to give their lives meaning. It's so sad too, for many of them are almost totally dependent upon outside sources for their meaning and are unable to find meaning within themselves.<br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the Green Witch

Nothing I've learned about Fred Astaire has given me any clues either, except that he made more money than I realized. It just sounds right though that Paul Banks would say it. I don't know. You can try www.songmeanings.net for overall interpretations of the song, but no one there seems to consider it important enough to focus on. You could ask there. Good luck!

TthGozvwaa	I dont think that Brad drowns. I believe he will go to the cabin with Sharon and Nick and Phyllis tries to shoot Sharon and Brad jumps in. I am not sure really. That is what I think. I have not seen todays episode yet. Should see it tomarrow. I am at work during the day so I cant see it till supper time. But I do think that Phyllis needs meds because she is so obsessed with SHARON!!! Gosh|`|b95adf9df97c91be72d1af840c313197aa	fromwhat i've read and gathered, tommorrow noah remembers who saved him (brad's one glove is mixed in with noah's clothes at the hospital)and thurs, someone screams when he's found..........i thought i had read he was supposed to be shot taking a bullet for sharon; hell i was hoping for that sort of exit|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Well considering that they have his last airdate as Feb 5th or 6th, l think still have a few days to go to see what really happened to him.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I missed that part.

Vj43BqcDaa	The fire signs are the most dynamic.  It's hard to pick just one because it affects different areas for them.    Aries - dynamic leader  Leo - socially dynamic  Sagittarius - physically dynamic    I suppose if I had to pick just one, it would be Sagittarius since it is mutable (always changing) and the most active, which is the closest to my definition of dynamic.  But all three signs possess amazing levels of drive and energy, especially compared to a dreamy little Pisces like myself.    =)|`|A3dQS6k2aa	Aries|`|xpiGWrdMaa	leo|`|qg11igznaa	I bet you anything that the folks who wrote 'Aries' are Aries' themselves. That's the way that sign roles. I would say scorpio for dynamic. Scorpio tend to have pretty magnetic personalities, but they're secretive too.

AA10783140	Hmmm...EJO as the new LV/CSI boss...I LIKE IT!...almost like the days as Metro-Dade(now Miami-Dade) PD Lt. Martin Castillo on "Miami Vice"!...Jerry Bruckheimer should be pleased!    Lawrence Fishburne should go back to Broadway and leave the REAL TV stuff to the pros!...    BTW, congrats to former "CSI:" star William Petersen for getting his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this morning!...he really deserved it!|`|btrMdy5Uaa	I think you may have something there! I like EJO! Great actor, but totally keep Laurence Fishburne too though! I like him a lot too!|`|AA10783240	Monty's RIGHT!    What the heck was Anthony Zuiker THINKING???...    Sure, Larry Fishburne's not bad, but even William Petersen would've approved of EJO as the new "boss"...if EJO was comfy playing Lt. Castillo on "Miami Vice" many years ago(gee, has it been 26 years already?), then I think "Gris" and Anthony would have no doubts about casting this legend!

v588UNt6aa	Dude I'm gonna have to agree with you........and disagree. Personally I agree that Green Day is one of the greatest, popular, and most successful bands of......well ever. Next is Oasis and Nickleback. I don't really like them, so I disagree. I think Nirvana is great. As for Pink Floyd and Led Zeppilen........ I think they are kind of overrated, but that's just me. Keep in mind there a lot of worst bands out there like Jonas Brothers and Linkin Park. Finally, yes Green Day is my favorite band, and I hope your ready for American Idiots followup - 21st Century Breakdown! OK, peace :)|`|Jj8fJ8x6aa	are you high?<br>  <br>  bands like nirvana, zeppelin, and pink floyd were pioneers in the kind of music they made, in their own way they changed rock music. Green Day is a copy of the Clash and The Ramones, nickelback is a whorible copy of old southern rock and grunge, and Oasis is a copy of the Beatles and The Who.|`|4cdb7483e4e06664fd51041ac8118e42aa	Oasis is ok, Green Day are sell outs, and Nickelback is the most generic crap I have ever heard.  I like American Idiot, but it is not "classy"<br>  <br>  Your worst list has great bands on it.|`|AgQForcYaa	..................................<br>  <br>  Ooooooh, boy, you're gonna get your @$$ handed to you...<br>  <br>  And American Idiot is NOT the best-selling album ever. Maybe in Green Day's whole discography, but NOT of all time.|`|dQvKvnVuaa	I totally disagree with you!!!!<br>  <br>  I don't care for any of your "best" bands. I don't care either way about Nirvana, but Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin are amazing!|`|fdklyKuHaa	No no<br>  <br>  no<br>  no<br>  no<br>  no<br>  no<br>  <br>  If you think f*cking Nickleback is better than Nirvana, YOU NEED HELP.<br>  <br>  I bet you're one of those teens who doesn't appreciate older music.|`|zM9Lj21waa	sorry to hear about your childhood accident involving your hearing...|`|WWVz3Jqvaa	umm mine is the exact oppisite|`|RvnBuOROaa	green day is in the middle.<br>  nickleback is not rock. theyr radio pop garbage (yahoo would kick me off if i said what i really thought). oasis is middle.<br>  <br>  you gotta remember though, all the worst bands of yours influenced all the best bands.<br>  i dont really care for pink floyd, but nirvana is probably the most amazing grunge band of all time, and led zeppelin was really the first rock (not rock and roll. thats like elvis. rock is different).<br>  so honestly i think you should be cut up into little pieces and eaten and then killed.<br>  <br>  TSD your an awful person.<br>  saying that just because nobody has heard of a band means their awfful... their not the best, but since when has fan base become more important than music?  maybe you should look harder for new music.<br>  <br>  mackenzie L you have no understanding that there are people who like different things do yoou? one of my favorite artists is a blues artist from the 20's - 30's. what now? thats older than anyone you know.|`|WU4MHq3aaa	this is joke.... or.... APOCOLYPSE!!<br>  <br>  and the best selling album ever is the Eagles Greatest Hits<br>  <br>  Also... Green Day's popularity doesn't come close to Led Zeppelin's, Pink Floyd's, and Nirvana, and also... I don't see any Green Day tribute bands or bands influenced by Green Day<br>  <br>  and Macenzie L.... <br>  <br>  don't stereotype!  I'm 12 facking years old and thats not even teen... and look at me..|`|RtG5Iarbaa	I think 'Worst' is where 'Best' is supposed to be.|`|NqIdetVMaa	OK no.<br>  Like others have said with out bands like zeppelin and floyd paving green day and others would be nothing.<br>  Green day wasn't bad before American idiot but now they straight out suck.<br>  Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon was one of the best selling albums ever thats a lot more you can say for them than green day.<br>  It is the number 3 best selling album world wide.<br>  None of the bands you listed are even close.|`|Zxl8oyIraa	Seriously? promptly kill urself. now. ur opinion is the complete opposite of wat a normal persons should be. <br>  <br>  Dont actually kill urself, i couldnt live with myself, but i digress. bad kid bad kid|`|AA11618061	Best<br>  <br>  Pink Floyd<br>  Led Zepplin<br>  Stevie Ray Vaungh<br>  CCR<br>  <br>  Worst<br>  <br>  Lynard Skynard<br>  Aerosmith<br>  ACDC<br>  <br>  <br>  mmm|`|4ObhfxoIaa	LMAO, yeah okay I'm with you<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *rolls eyes* <br>  <br>  And it's "they're" not "their"<br>  <br>  Go to school.|`|89xzNpVaaa	<----------------, You see who's that?<br>  Yeah, now you know whats my top band, well, its the same as the first answer, your worst is supposed to be my best, and my worst is your west.<br>  Green Day verses Pink Floyd?<br>  Nickelback verses Nirvana?<br>  Led Zeppelin verses Oasis?????<br>  ???????????????????????????????<br>  Shame.|`|vgcY5jHuaa	This is the most obvious troll i've ever seen.

I don't think Nirvana is that great so I'm with you on that one. But Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin are incredibly influential bands who have stood the test of time. I highly doubt Green Day, Nickelback, and Oasis will have the same future. Also, if Led Zeppelin never existed, I highly doubt a band like Green Day would even exist. Nickelback is widely criticized as being generic, and I agree with that. Sure, they make good money, but that doesn't mean anything when it comes to greatness in the big world of music. Oasis was a good band, but they didn't do anything groundbreaking. Some people don't like Pink Floyd because they can be a little avant garde sometimes, but to say that they don't sound professional is completely ludicrous.

If you are late with your payments, your case will be discharged and you'll have to start over. That's expensive and it doesn't look good on your record. Plus, you only get one chance for a do-over. But if you go back to court and ask for your case to be re-evaluated based on current circumstances, you can prevent that. The judge has the authority to postpone the plan, lower payments, or do whatever it takes to make it work.

irSBrZiQaa	Yes Katie found out about it while her and Brad were trying to be friends. Katie was really upset with Brad and told him that she never wanted to see him again. Bard told Carly that Katie now wants nothing to do with him because he kept Carly's secret. Carly decided to go to Katie and told her that Brad wanted to tell Jack the truth, but she begged him not to tell. Katie then forgave Brad and that's when Brad offered to help Katie make a baby.
j6poSs16aa	I agree! I wished that they could have one atleast one award! I love Coldplay (im listening to them right now! haha) I also went to one of their concerts, it was amazing!<br>  <br>  P.S.

They ok, so they won at the Grammys but I think it's a huge shame that they weren't recognized in their own country.|`|v8F2UeXCaa	i love coldplay, a lot of people don't as they lack a brain and anything that has words is too much for them to handle! they deserve to win a lot more than they do. i have honestly loved every album|`|AA10974198	I quite like Coldplay but I just wanted to say that you should have written "who else thinks Coldplay should HAVE won something at the Brits?"<br>  <br>  Sorry, but that mistake always annoys me|`|O4etrWnSaa	Ripoffs.|`|3KldFOWSaa	Duhh, the good ones are always robbed.|`|yjyBbVJoaa	I cannot believe Katie Perry won and they got left out.

Woods is a grown woman and is good friends with Aubrey. She didn't want to be in the group anymore either. Diddy deserves no respect. Did you know he barely paid these girls despite their two platinum albums. Diddy treats his artists like dirt. Why do you think Mary J. Blige jumped ship all those years ago. He doesn't pay his artists and disses them. Diddy has only one use for females and it's not making records. Aubrey is a cute girl and she's working her angle. Hey, she's getting paid and the rest of those girls are just gonna get forgotten.

uPDAmpdFaa	I'd need more info to know what you mean by bad. I'm just going to assume you mean it's filled with static and garbled. If that is the case, your audio card or audio chip isn't powerful enough to process your recordings. You'll need a something more powerful and dedicated like an UBS or Firewire audio interface or an professional internal sound card used for audio recording.
g2GogSALaa	Hmm, I don't know why everyone is UPSESED with Twilight.|`|UepGEiR9aa	i saw twilight online last night...i HATE to admit it, but i liked it...BUT!<br>  <br>  it's nothing to fangirl over...and edward is too cute! sorry....that was my girly side talking...|`|k1FenuRLaa	edward is  butt hot  !|`|CArzkDIUaa	teenagers.|`|yeYL8Udoaa	because it is apparently a good book....

The books were decent, a good read. As for being a screaming rabid Twi-hard and having a huge crush on Edward, um, no. That's just annoying and dumb. I've taken to telling Twilight fans this: 'And then Buffy staked Edward. The End.'|`|AU0KODQbaa	Ok, well obviously you are talking about the movie. Well yes, the movie SUCKED *** and Robert Pattinson is so friggin stupid, and such a bad actor! So, yes I agree it sucked. But I love the books.

They all act as though they're best mates, telling each other "oh I love you". I just think "hang on, no you don't love them, in fact you barely know them.

It does make good tv though lol|`|AA12030694	i think its horrible the way people steal if i were there i could not steal i would shake there hand before we decided to try and ensure a split as we are all just trying to get on and helping eachother makes it easier for all<br>  <br>  i just watched the latest show and felt so bad for the woman

Very good joke! :D|`|YpxGfmdKaa	Haha! Good one !  This is an old one!    An englishman, scotsman and an irishman are on a plane together when it begins to divebomb, sending them to certain death. In order to escape, the plane has to loose lots of weight quickly to allow it to continue to fly. They decide that each man has to throw out a possesion.  'I'll throw out a rose, 'cos theres lots of them in my country' says the Englishman.  'I'll throw out a thistle, 'cos there's lots of them in my country' says the Scotsman.  'I'll throw out bomb, 'cos' theres lots of them in my country' says the Irishman.  Luckily, their plan works and they survive, and they each go home to their families.  As the Englishman comes home he sees his dad weeping and says 'Dad! Dad! Why are you crying!?' to which his dad replies 'a rose fell out the sky and the thorns slit your mothers throat!'

She nearly fell backwards!!!!|`|DcCECelaaa	I'm a prankster too and I worked with a guy in Manhattan named Mike in my area of the corporate office who thought he was SO funny, he'd call 976 numbers with the recorded ladies doing all the heavy breathing and moaning like they were in the throws of passion, then forward the call to office people at their desk and watch their stunned faces.  Ha-ha-ha...So funny.<br>  <br>  Well I got this advertisement in the mail from a photographer who used a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader as one of his models.  It had that swirly blue canvas in the background so it looked homespun enough to be believable as a friend vs. a stock professional photograph.  Mike had recently traveled to Texas (my home state) for the first time and came back GUSHING over how beautiful the women were just walking around the Dallas/Fort Worth airport.  Then a light went off in my head as my plan formed to one-up Mike on all his stupid pranks.<br>  <br>  So the next day, I casually left the photo of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader on my desk which he immediately picked up on when he went by.  "Who's this?" he asked.<br>  <br>  "Oh that's my cousin, Becky.  She's a real sweetie." I said.  Now we had a policy of answering each other's phones when we were away from the area, so I called a female friend with a thick Texas accent and got her to call me at an appointed time when I would be away and Mike would be next desk over.  She called, he picked up for me, and then she laid in on REAL THICK, asking first for me, then who he was, telling him she was from Dallas, how cute he sounded over the phone -- the whole bit!  I showed up after they established raport and took the call but then followed up by telling him she was interested in talking to him again.  <br>  <br>  So I gave him her phone number and they proceeded to chat off and on for about 3 months, all the while, I'm snickering so hard it was all I could do to keep from peeing on myself!  Mike thought he was talking to a real Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader when the real Becky was anything but.<br>  <br>  Then Mike had a birthday get-together planned at a local watering hole (drinks after work) and I decided to bring my full prank to fruition.  I had Becky call and say she was coming to Manhattan for her best friend's wedding and wanted to meet him, but only had a couple of hours (which of course happened to coincided with his birthday event after work).  So he made the invitation and it became a real date which he was looking forward to for about a week and which gave me time to prepare.<br>  <br>  I called a singing telegram company (Eastern Onion) and found a lady who was perfect.  She was a self-described LARGE, 300 pound black opera singer with a bawdy Mae West routine.  So when Mike's birthday came around, I had her waiting and sent a page from Becky for him to meet his party at the front. And when she saw him, she called out to the crowd, "HI MIKE!  I'M BECKY!  You thought you were gonna getcherself a hot little Texas Tamale?  Well honey, you gotcherself the MANHATTAN MAMA!"...and everyone could hear glass shattering as Mike's jaw hit the floor.<br>  <br>  The Manhattan Mama went on to do her comedy bit, totally humiliating Mike but in good fun.  He got a real kick out of it and thanked me, albeit a bit begrudgingly because he knew now I held the title for best prank on our floor.  He said it was the best he'd ever been through because it lasted for 3 months.  And in the end, he did remain friends with the real Becky although they never met in person.<br>  <br>  But as I recollect, that was one of the best pranks I ever pulled.  I hope it spawns a few fun ideas for you.

Hopefully, tomorrow will be as windy as today was, and I'll be carried off again.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I'm so sleepy right now I want to fall out of a window.

Locally, at least. Just go out for Sunday drives. Pick a direction and head out for the day....usually back by nightfall. We live(d) in the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, in the heart of Texas. There''s lots of interesting things within driving distance. That was way back when gasoline was a decent price. For the last 28 years, my husband and I take road trips 2 or 3 times a year. We pick a theme. This year we are doing a number of Historical Texas Court House trips. That will be about 4 trips to get them all in. And then I want to do a series of trips to see old Texas ghost towns. But my dream road trip would have to be the entire length of Route 66. From beginning to end.|`|nooi0ldjaa	ha ha, i have before<br>  <br>  one time my dad came home from work and said<br>  "ok pack your stuff we're going to alaska!"<br>  and we did, and it was fun...and now we're planning on moveing up there.|`|GwwcqUCoaa	Yes, and first time I did was probably 10 minutes after I got my driver’s license.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	Probably not, but I did once just go northwest without maps on unknown roads to see where I'd end up.

I mean, won't people who know your real name still remember your real name, and some might even still call you by that... I don't know, it just seems complicated to change a name. But I doubt it will mess everything up|`|r3o10XbAaa	whats your name?<br>  its not like it matters, were just a bunch of people on the internet, i'm just curious...<br>  well, about the name thing, people should just do what makes them happy and confident. If you need to change your name to be happy and confident, then do it. You shouldn't worry about messing everything up, do it to make yourself happier. Everything will work out. Don't worry :) Just do whatever you need to do.|`|zxRkdozwaa	no i dont think it will mess anything up at all, <br>  I've changed my name in 8th grade and it worked (but i did go back after a while becasue i couldnt get used to it) but since its a small change it should be good. best of luck.|`|HgNd8LUzaa	I used to hate my name because everyone was always like "A man DUH" but then I found out it means love :)<br>  <br>  If you wanna change it, it's your choice.|`|xZ3rZbshaa	Why would you be ashamed of your name?

As for those pros that you may call it, they may seem to have stayed in the casino too long to notice that the roulette was starting to wear and tear so they can figure out the next outcome. It is probability of a certain color coming out is the same as anything else. Don`t run the risk of losing your money even if it has the risk of getting it back twofold. You might just lose all of it.|`|LI0Q5aKPaa	no in roulette the tiny ball has no mind of its own if it lands on black the first time it has the same chance of it landing on black the second time trust me that is not true. think of roulette just like a coin toss.|`|YoC5ksLkaa	no its just a theory there is no way 100% know what the next number is gonna be dont do it|`|FhVobWpeaa	Me either get yea behind me satan|`|PlHjhwtAaa	maybe, but no one likes a cheater|`|n00kRXVYaa	yeah why not|`|9nRMFgaPaa	with roulette you dont need to pay to play just sit at a table out of the way and write on a piece of paper what you would put down if you used money and stay for an hour or two if on your peice of paper you are winning then give it a go.|`|mBLeqsH2aa	It makes sense that it would work.|`|gFM4V8FRaa	ur soo lame...tryna make money by using answers..

If you told Guns n Roses to cover the most musically difficult linkin park song, they would laugh and have it figured out in about an hour. If you told Linkin Park to cover the most musically difficult Guns n' Roses song, they would laugh and say F U because they would have to devote about month to figure out some of the musical stuff that Slash can do. Let me ask you this, who is the lead guitar player for Linkin Park? any idea? OK Slash is one of the most widely recognized guitar players in the world. Linkin Park's dude would have no chance of outdueling slash in a guitar contest.|`|EhrB7nUXaa	WTF Guns n Roses has WAYYYYY more talent then linkin park! 4 realz.. Sweet Child of Mine and Welcome to the Jungle r the best songs EVRR!<br>  <br>  Linkin Park has some good songs 2.. like In The end, What Ive Done, and Numb.. but STILL!<br>  <br>  Guns n Roses are way better then Linkin Park.|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	I like Linkin Park, but they can't hold a candle to Guns N Roses. None of them have anything on Axl Rose or Slash. I'm sorry. Old school beats the new school anytime.|`|vgcY5jHuaa	I believe you. Guns and roses is infinitely superior to them, and I'm sure they know that.|`|v588UNt6aa	Any band is better than Linkin Park.

hs9Mibf5aa	Totally agree she should have stayed.<br>  <br>  Same mistake(s) over and over.  Benjamin had a SOLID plan, and one word that he was a 'threat' and they got rid of a good player.  DUH - everyone is going to consider you a threat, and talk about you.<br>  <br>  Candace performed extremely well at camp, - did you see her in the physical challenge?  She was no Crystal - made her shot, and everything.  Good swimmer, athletic.. Tsk, tsk, Benjamin - you could have voted her off later - like you yourself will probably be, if you don't get that by now! But no.. he let his ego take over.  And naturally, the others didn't want to 'speak up'.  So Sierra's safe another week, and maybe another.. I like the girl o.k., but no way should she have been kept over Candace.<br>  <br>  18th Season and they Still become a victim of their own egos.  Karma will get him, and Sierra will probably outlast him now.|`|lCE5sziNaa	I wish it was Coach.|`|AA11502346	Apparently her big mouth got her in trouble.  They should've kept her.<br>  <br>  As much as I do not want to see Sierra go (I didn't want Sandy to go either; I have this thing with rooting for the underdog), the tribe is better off with Candace and without Sierra (considering that she's fighting back strep throat + a fever; she could be at risk for catching pneumonia or something worse).|`|4imsjgE2aa	They always seem to make weird, bad decisions on the early votes. She spoke up and they got scared? <br>  <br>  My favorite is when they vote off a strong guy the first two or three times at Tribal Counsel.  They aren't even close to merging!

BKr3y30maa	For me a guy has to have a sense of humor but know when it's time to be serious.  He has to have a J.O.B.....it doesn't have to be this super high-paying job, but he at least has to have one.  He has to like children because I have a son, and if he has children of his own....he has to be a good man that takes care of his kids and is involved in his children's lives.  Cannot be a drug user.  If he drinks, that's ok.  But no way in hell am I dating an alcoholic.  And of course, it always helps that we have at least a few things in common. That pretty much wraps up my qualifications.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Yup there are two physical features a guy must have (eyes and biceps) and all other physical features can be overlooked.<br>  Then there are five qualifications that are a MUST:<br>  No smoking<br>  Spontaneous<br>  Sense of humor<br>  Intelligent<br>  Reliable|`|AA10415600	yes they must be female and...<br>  <br>  <br>  that's about it, i think

I’d visit at least 50 countries in 18 months.  (~$1 million)<br>  - With the remaining $51.32 million to $53.32 million I would put:<br>  - $27.32 million in various savings accounts<br>  - $28-$30 million in monthly CDs and I would live off of the money earned (~$46,700 to ~$50k a month or $560k to $600k a year) and redeposit the $28-$30 million each month.

It was my first time. That's right, I lost my Amazon.com virginity today. I got some old "Mindwarp" books by Chris Archer. It's like X-men, only with thirteen year-olds. Pure nostalgia.|`|bLnjJ6Cbaa	I bought two books!! I was on campus at 7:30 this morning, two hours before the start of my first class, and no one was around. So I decided to wait for either the library or the bookstore to open. The bookstore opened first, I went in and saw, for the first time, that there was a small table with a pile of good books that were cheap. I purchased a collection of short stories by Kate Chopin, and T. S. Eliot's "The Waste Land" and other poems. The first time I've bought books that weren't for school in months! It really made my day!

If so then you're gonna be hard pressed to find them to stream anywhere.  Both seasons are out on DVD right now.  You could check the p2p's or torrents ... that might be your only hope for finding them online.<br>  <br>  The animated show that is airing on the Cartoon Network right now can be streamed from starwars.com.<br>  <br>  May The Force Be With You ...|`|9rBNcGIAaa	There's only one legitimate place I've found, the rest seem like scams :-/ You can watch it over here though: <a href="http://www.vostuu.com/watch28015.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vostuu.com/watch28015.html</a><br>  <br>  They make you do a little survey but after that it's good to go :)|`|OLFR7hKzaa	try <a href="http://videobuster.page.tl/" rel="nofollow">http://videobuster.page.tl/</a>

We won't wake up saying "The universe is blankity blank miles wide and blank miles high!" Research and experience is what we need. Does the sky end? Will we figure it out?|`|pUyRX8Qdaa	yeah, but even the Creator needs a Creator... so here's what i think...<br>  <br>  "Yahweh" [ the creator as we know him ] comes from a race of celestial spiritual beings of vast wisdom and higher intelligence beyond human comprehension...and he probably went his own way to create his own creatures, starting with the Angels. then he went on to create the firstborn human being, Jesus...and then by using his powerful intelligent Angelic creatures, Father Yahweh said, "let us now create planets, and living things and let us make my children on our image"...so then Adam and Eve did he create in the image of himself, in the image of his firstborn son, Jesus, and in the image of his angelic creatures that bear his holy name.<br>  <br>  You can't just say "God" appeared outta thin air one day and created the Universe... Yahweh [ God] had to come from one of the galaxies in the Universe...because there are hundreds of millions of galaxies!<br>  <br>  this must be true...otherwise the 'big bang' theory makes more sense, and no one will be able to prove God's existence unless He comes from a race of celestial spiritual beings that have legs, arms,ears, eyes, head and voice!<br>  <br>  Yahweh is a walking being with a voice to speak his demands and commandments, so that tells you that he also must have a beginning...because all living things must have a beginning.<br>  <br>  You can not say that "God" just is...because that is unlikely the truth.<br>  <br>  So, whatsoever Yahweh created bears his name. And all that He created is under his authority and rulership and Laws and Mercies.<br>  <br>  that is what i believe... <br>  <br>  and No...not all the answers are found in scripture...just enough to get by until we find out all the answers about Yahweh the Creator.<br>  <br>  Don't say you know the answer, because we will not know the answers until we die and advance to the next level.|`|kJMzyFrsaa	It appears to be much more than we could have ever imagined...<br>  <br>  Not only is the enormity looking outward fantastic but looking inward is equally fantastic. Sub atomic particles are as endless as our universe...<br>  <br>  It only humbles oneself to realize this...|`|skYjY1craa	Zzzzzzz..Zzzzzz....|`|PkUBJMd9aa	i  think the video is crayyyyyzeee!|`|rbjzHWabaa	i don't get what you're asking could you email me or add what the meaning of this video is because now im curious!

Little kids like cartoons, Smarties like Dr. House (its very challenging to keep up with the terms). When Im Alone I just want to see Frasier, my younger brother says that Prison Break is the best show ever, but if you are a women you probably like greys, housewives and the like, since they are written by women for women. But the Truth is that any show that you decide to watch, will be more meaningfull if you start at the beggening and never skip an episode... Its not the same adventure if you watch resident evel 3 before the firstone or before even playing the game. Oh Well is just a thought.    Every Tv Series has a number one episode that is called PILOT.  This is the Clip that writers use to "convince" the Producers that their Show is good.  I truly recommend that if you want to dedicate time into watching a tv series you start by googleing many series pilots so you have a good preview of what the show is about.|`|yg0ojTxZaa	Desperate Housewives    Easy!|`|U0re5hicaa	desp house definitley|`|kH3IaPPIaa	Prison break!|`|fwtq3bQ3aa	i would say lost and prison break 100%|`|QfR8GupEaa	Desperate housewives  i LOVE Gabby|`|phWUBtviaa	I watch desperate housewives, lost, greys anatomy, and prison break.

nfOxiQ2zaa	As detailed in The Art of the Pirates of the Caribbean, the proposed story for the fourth film was for Sparrow and Barbossa to meet up in the newly founded New Orleans, before they sail to find the Fountain of Youth together.

I wouldn't recommendskipping any early Grey's episodes. I think you can pretty much start watching Grey's in real time every Thursday and catch up at the same time. I did it. Though if you don;t want to spoil it, you should just catch up first, then watch season 4 online.( Ironically, the only Grey's that I'd skip is about half of the episodes in Season 4. They're boring as he**.)|`|oVRA1ze2aa	can they cancel that show already.I am sick of Mc dreamy, Mc steamy and  them all doing that dumb dance.

I thought Grace Kelly, Rita Hayworth, Ava Gardner and Veronica Lake had better style than her.|`|iAuvoQeHaa	She was the unusual type. A mix of different ethnicities. She had really nice style and charm on film.<br>  <br>  Really, she was probably the first 'waif'. Her thinness was actually because she was starved during Nazi occupation of her home country Holland.|`|9z0dzBjAaa	yesss!<br>  shes so freakin pretty!|`|fZdBaMl1aa	I think she is gorgeous. but you should read her biography she has had the most interesting life.|`|EyAAFfaMaa	Audrey Hepburn, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful women ever. She had an amazing sense of style, was a great actress, and had a nice personality. She was graceful, and elegant. She is and always will be both beautiful and iconic. <br>  <br>  But, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. That's my opinion,though.|`|rgwFBtkwaa	Yes I think she's gorgeous but I think it depends on the movie and the character she's playing. In Breakfast at Tiffany's she was really beautiful because she had this mystique about her that was very appealing. Look at that - <a href="http://www.allmoviereplicas.com/mtblog/image/audrey_hepburn_blog.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.allmoviereplicas.com/mtblog/i...</a><br>  I agree that in some photos she can be rather mousy.|`|RhzWwYI6aa	She really was THAT pretty.... <br>  <br>  But I don't think that it was just her looks that made people fall in love with her. It was her ability to act, her personality, and the characters that she chose.|`|VHxZuaOfaa	In those times she was, and she does have a look of Sophistication while lets say Marilyn Monroe has the sexy but not trashy|`|7gpAdJGaaa	I THOUGHT SO WHEN I WAS WITH HER DOWN AT THE BEACH

They are close in the sexual relationships, but that is not enough. Gemini is the type who tries to live a full, busy life but not so with Scorpio, as Scorpio is more centered on the idea of self improvement. Scorpio is sensual, passionate, demanding, jealous, inflexible. Gemini is fickle, flighty, superficial, lighthearted, changeable. Gemini is a social creature, Scorpio likes privacy. The representatives of Gemini'sign take everything too easy for the Scorpio. The Scorpio is purposeful while the Gemini are always doubting. It will probably be a kind of relationships that is not easy to cope with with difficult marriage as a result.|`|QZzQdh43aa	noo, don't even try<br>  <br>  i'm a scorpio who tried to pursue a gemini man once<br>  the two minds just don't agree on anything. almost every opinion is different, and you might find scorpio to be too intense and not free-spirited enough for you. you will feel suffocated.|`|oD84tRxBaa	yeah its pretty good.

I would highly suggest going with Apple's MP4 codec, it offers great compression while still keeping great video quality.
JzYlcuXzaa	In Windows Movie Maker, there should be an option to Import Audio.  Click there and browse through your files and find your Limewire or Shared folder.<br>  <br>  Just click import and the audio file should open in your editing timeline.

The movie wasn't like really good, it was ok and that is only because of Carrell.|`|dajfpt7iaa	it was fair but i think it slipped out of the subject otherwise it could have been a better movie|`|840e6a182a0c8998e0fc8fdf077673a2aa	I didn't like it much, it wasn't very funny at all.

RgymoiIQaa	Sara isn't about a witch or maybe she is a witch. But it seems to me the song is more about love, or maybe a lost love. Stevie Nicks from Fleetwood Mac has admitted she is a witch.
lpyWVR2oaa	What's his Moon sign? If it is found in a vastly different element like Fire or Air, then this might lighten up the Scorpion personality.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, the keyword describing this man is 'intense' - his depth of emotions and intensity is not for the faint-hearted. At the same time, he's also deeply passionately in his beliefs, ideals and also can be rigid, stubborn and obsessive/jealous when in love. You may not know what he's thinking of much of the time and he can also be manipulative and distant at times. Domination and having the upper hand, power and control issues mean a great deal to the Scorpio stellium native.<br>  <br>  In general, he won't open up to you until you have earned his trust and that's necessarily a bad thing. Once he is assured of your love, he can be one of the most ardent and loyal, committed partners around. His love for his partner or kids is not the shallow, superficial type but tends to run deep and last long over the years.|`|7HEZhx46aa	What the heck is a stellium? Tell me you're not SERIOUSLY letting a silly superstition guide your love life. If he has a brain in his head, he won't have any relationship with you and it'll have nothing to do with his sign -- it'll be because he's smarter than you.

1204e9a4f0121ebac48e7d8f61d56242aa	I'm not clear on what information you want, but I think that you will find that that particular scale is known as the Spanish Gypsy scale. It is very close to the Double Harmonic scale which is A, Bb(A ) C , D, E, F, G , A.    Musician, composer, teacher.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	It would be more useful to notate it with the Bb as above. The Spanish gypsy scale comes from Moorish influences, so it is same as arabic.  George McKay lists it, as the spanish gypsy scale, with the one mentioned by the above, coming between that and the Algerian scale.  These are names given by westerners, and are more suggestive to feel.  On guitar, I think you'll find Jimi Page and Steve Howe use your scale, though not in the realm of classical, in the usual sense.  The natural major chords A, Bb, and D minor are used, the others being diminished and unstable. You can add many tones to this scale for greater utility. A "C" going down and a "B" going up would give you more chords and harmonic force.  It's good to play with these things, that's why they call it playing music

bYJVqzlfaa	Didja' know that Eddie Van Halen started out playing drums until he tried switching instruments with his brother Alex one day?      Try the guitar for a few weeks.  Make sure he can hear you trying it.  If you still want drums after that, bring it up then...|`|5eGs0wKPaa	maybe you ought to give it a try and when he sees youre not into it hell understand that drums are you niche or whatever passion u understand|`|HGnWKRzyaa	I think you should actually give guitar a try. Guitar is so amazingly fun once you get into it. And the thing with drums is that if you buy a set and you don't sound like how you want to sound, you are going to hate it for the first 30 minutes.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	you dont need drums to learn to play drums. just air drum it and buy some when you get better. learn some guitar, it wont hurt, and itll give you practice with rhythm and stuff for the drums in the future... take it from me. I play piano, guitar, and drums|`|PRCfCSDxaa	You might as well give it a try. I know how you feel. I got a Gibson for my birthday but I have no one to teach me how to play. I know some basic stuff but damn, it's much harder trying to teach yourself. I'm more of a drum person, too and my dad won't set them up until I am more focused with guitar. So basically, we are both in the same situation. I'm trying to learn it though because it is pretty fun when you get something down that you like. It's just guitar is so hard for me lol!|`|QnAEEmB3aa	John Mayer wanted to be an actor first of all, he then decided to become a musician. Johnny Depp wanted to be a musician instead of an actor.  Sometimes, what you think you want isn't what you really want. Give the guitar a try, you might be the next Hendrix but if it doesn't work out, then you can get drums.    Hope this helps :)

P0Fjh59Eaa	EJ raped Sami the same night that Lucas and Sami made love.   Two babies were conceived, one was Lucas' one was EJ's. the boy Johnny is EJ's son, the girl Ally is Lucas' daughter.   after Sami and Lucas broke up for what?? the hundredth time now? because Sami wanted to protect her family from Stefano and he promised to leave her family alone if she divorced Lucas and married EJ. so she did, but then she signed annulment papers when they thought Stefano was brain dead....course EJ didn't turn the papers in and Sami had to get a formal divorce, and Lucas was in prison for shooting EJ.  anyway...on the night Lucas got out of prison after doing a favor for the cops, he walked in on Sami and EJ getting busy. she finally gave into her feelings for him. Lucas was pissed (understandably so) and that was it for them.  She hated EJ after that (or so she said)...then found out 3 months later that she was pregnant w/EJs baby....again, this time a girl.    so she has a total of 4 now. Will, Johnny, Ally and the new baby who isn't named yet.|`|AA12043358	A few years ago, EJ raped Sami and she became pregnant. She was also pregnant from Lucas at the same time and therefore she had twins.  Johnny is EJ's and Allie is Lucas'.   She married Lucas and then divorced him in order to save her family from Stefano.   She was forced to marry EJ.  On the day of their marriage Lucas, who I think is taking the rap for Wil, shot EJ and EJ was paralyzed.  But he did not stay paralyzed for long.  Lucas went to jail.  In the meantime Sami resisted EJ's advances until one fateful day when Lucas got out of jail early.  Lucas walked in on Sami and EJ in bed.  As a result Sami became pregnant.  She is unaware that Nicole switched her baby with Mia's.|`|LkTcLWTOaa	to clarify belle's answer, nicole got the doctor to switch the babies so now she has sami's baby and sami has mia's.|`|AA12181093	Awhile back, Sami had twins, a boy named Johnny & EJ is his father; & a girl, Ally & Lucas is her father.  EJ's now the father of 2 more kids, another one with Sami, another girl & Nicole miscarried her DiMera kid but pretended to be pregnant & convinced Mia to give her daughter to Nicole to raise.|`|EioOPbzbaa	Sami was raped by EJ before her wedding to Lucas and became pregnant with twins - the son Johnny belongs to EJ while the daughter, Allie belongs to Lucas.  Sami's daughter was switched at the clinic by Dr. Baker with Mia's baby (which Nicole had taken).  Nicole and EJ took Sami's baby home and Sami has Mia's baby.

His riches, his sins, his entire life are worthless without his faith in Jesus Christ. He attributes his successes and battling alcohol and drug addiction to his faith. The wine poured over the bounty before him I believe symbolizes the blood of the the Lamb. Jesus Christ shed his blood and died for our sins. Johnny Cash know his debt for all his sins were paid, not by his achievements or riches, but by Christ and Christ alone.<br>  <br>  It's a passionate and thought provoking video in my opinion.<br>  <br>  (sorry, I had to say alcohol but I really believe the video is a 3 minute look at his life and reflects his passion in his faith. He literally gave his life to Christ).|`|HqcH85SMaa	I think it was done in anger - all his friends are gone.<br>  <br>  Such a depressing  song.|`|We6rY8ynaa	dlr 710 is right about the Greek thing but I believe he means it to be a metaphor for the blood of Christ covering his sins throughout his life.

xqrwDmyUaa	It's being remade twice, ugh one is titled Oz and the other The Wizard of Oz. Should be awful. It'll only be good if one of these decides to stick to the original book, which has never been done in a movie before (but was close to being done in a difficult to find tv series).<br>  If I had to cast it, I would make it animated, it's the only why you can complete the story (or at least get a good start to a series) without it looking campy. And I would have a bunch of no-namers do the voices, except for Jack pumpkinhead which I would have Steve Busemi do, no idea why I just hear his voice when I read Jack. plus it's not a HUGE role (which is great, to have one recognizable voice in a supporting role).<br>  I think one of the remakes is animated to be honest I can't remember which one.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Phillip Seymour Hoffman as The Lion.<br>  <br>  Adrien Brody as Tin Man<br>  <br>  Lauren German as Dorothy<br>  <br>  Jonathan Sadowski as The Scarecrow<br>  <br>  Goldie Hawn as The Witch|`|xAohpW0Saa	They Made a mini-series of it, well a futuristic version anyway ha ha <br>  Its called "Tin Man" i have it on DVD its good i liked it.<br>  You should see it.<br>  Good cast.<br>  :]|`|MscsFimNaa	Dorothy: Zooey Deschanel<br>  Wizard: Nathan Lane<br>  Scarecrow: Johnny Depp???<br>  Tin Man: Christian Campbell<br>  Lion: Bill Murray<br>  Wicked Witch: Roseanne Barr|`|25HCZmPZaa	dorothy: Dakota Fanning<br>  Tin Man: George Clooney<br>  Lion: Will Ferrel<br>  Scarecrow: Bill Murry<br>  The witch: Anne Hathaway

d2RV8HTmaa	I hope it doesn't hurt his show coming on earlier, but I have faith in Conan that he will be successful, maybe even more because of the earlier timeslot.

I absolutely love Conan!|`|f9soMMuiaa	With Jay Leno staying on NBC and doing the same show pretty much, I think Conan will just retain all of his jokes and format onto the Tonight Show without worrying about alienating the original Tonight Show audience because they're probably just watch Jay earlier and then switch it off when Conan comes on.|`|f398f25935df15199d59845b04e83828aa	No, ill just watch Craig Ferguson on the late late show which is waaay better than Conan.|`|6qngoElyaa	No, I will just watch him on the Tonight Show.|`|dF5L4miFaa	conan's hilarious. he'll do fine.|`|ghPzWipnaa	why would he try to be like jay leno? conan will always be his awesome self.  i'm sure they will carry over many of the same jokes and stuff.

yciJslC4aa	not really. I don't pay any attention to the dashes.  The dashes are just spacers. Occassionaly people will tab like 12-----12-12-12------12<br>  to emphasize to show one note, brief rest, quick triplet, brief rest and another note or something of that sort but really the dashes don't mean anything. You can't really read rhythms from tabs|`|LWooaBQhaa	The dashes are almost like "rests." They just mean that you're not playing there, and usually if the tab is well written the amount of space will correspond to how long you rest. <br>  <br>  Basically the dashes are blank space, you don't have to "do" anything!

2BpkXSnqaa	I think this movies offbeat. Good direction and story is good with its excellent music. And does not have love songs and all coming after every now and then. I hope it should win an OSCAR. After golden globe, an Oscar will be another feather in A R Rahman's cap.<br>  The movie did bring in 10 nominations, but it has some serious competition going against The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which received 13 nominations. <br>  <br>  The morning after its seven-Bafta triumph, here are 10 reasons why Danny Boyle's crowdpleaser is unsurpassable in the race for the little gold men<br>  <br>  1 It is good enough to win – and it helps that it has poor competition this year. <br>  <br>  2 Like its hero, it is the dark-horse, outsider candidate that has come out of nowhere with no stars.<br>  <br>  3 In the crucial voting period, it is the film that continues to do great business wherever it plays.<br>  <br>  4 The people who like this film adore it – there is no other film in contention that has such an enthusiastic following.<br>  <br>  5 For years now, the Indian film industry has been a much discussed but marginalised phenomenon. Now the western audience begins to see what "Bollywood" is like and is reminded of old Hollywood.<br>  <br>  6 The fable-like structure of the film has the strength and simplicity of a fairytale.<br>  <br>  7 The film is full of delightful newcomers.<br>  <br>  8 It is all about money at a moment when no topic concerns us more.<br>  <br>  9 The profound hatred or mistrust of corrupt wealth and the consequent adoration of lucky poverty could not have a better dramatic demonstration.<br>  <br>  10 The new air of magical realism is about to crush photographic realism in the movies.|`|TyydcRfeaa	One of the best films of 2008 and should definitely win best picture Oscar as it presses all those buttons that the industry loves. A great concept - that all the questions on 'Who wants to be a millionaire?' have some significance in the life of a Mumbai street urchin. I think this will have added resonance for those who have visited Mumbai and Agra, but even if you've never been to India you will warm to this movie. The acting is excellent, from the children up to the adult protagonists, the story is believable and well paced, and the end credits are very uplifting. The soundtrack is also fantastic. It has the distinct feel of a European Independent film, like Cinema Paradiso, with the whole life story of the leading characters being played out. It may be a bit schmaltzy towards the end for some, but this can be overlooked due to some great cinematography and emotional performances. A classic.|`|FAEiMcIWaa	Coool...Slumdog is a touching movie and i liked it personaly...|`|5XYtvUUgaa	over-rated movie<br>  <br>  but the chances are there that its music would get an oscar atleast|`|co2FV3fwaa	I dont like the movie as in this u will c the dark part of india.India got a lots of other things too which was never shown in any of the movie.Films like lagaan and slumdog india is projected like a poor and dirty city.It becomes famous in a day that the movie is nominated for oscar.So all the viewers who dont know much about india they think that the complete india is like this...<br>  Slums are everywhere even in developed countries <br>  and the name i hate too wot DOG means|`|XCmYNbemaa	It might win. But then what's important to asses is why we feel it deserves it? No doubt the movie is gripping in its narration but I think upcoming movies like 'Barah Anna - <a href="http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://barah-aana-the-film.blogspot.com/</a>   is much better and authentic in its portrayal of the common man.|`|GwrPvxyhaa	yes it deserves the oscar....<br>  Its not just a movie... its a perfect reflection of our Society.!!!!!!!|`|QxBitq9Uaa	Yes but not because it is the best film but because it will have the financial backing.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	It has very bright chance to win Oscar.|`|8bb58fa4a42dc6a54ae5600a0d408c42aa	I thought "The Reader" and "Benjamin Button" were both better films. You can never tell with the Oscar voters, they tend to avoid the hype when it comes to best film.

iDfEBcgHaa	Venus in the first house makes your physical structure appealing.  Anyone can have acne, no matter how good-looking they are.  Aquarius Ascendants can have sensitive skin, so perhaps something in your diet or lifestyle (stress? allergies?) is contributing to your acne?  Diet has a huge effect on the hormones our body produce.  I know this isn't astrological advice, but seriously, get a good exfoliation gel (use it twice a week) and a cleanser (everyday) if you haven't tried it already.  No one has to know. :p<br>  <br>  The division of houses in a chart really depends on the type of chart.  Some have houses equally divided, some don't.  It's no big deal for your first house to span three signs.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	first of all,if you're tired of the acne,try some Proactiv.I had to use it a few years ago but I had to stop.I am too sensitive and it gave me a rash.It seems to be the answer for alot of people though.If I were you I would spend more energy trying to find the solution to the problem instead of looking for the cause.I mean no offense,please don't think I've insulted you.Good luck.|`|ku8TmLRgaa	HELLO JUSTIN YOU'RE VERY HANDSOME|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I have an Aquarius rising, Mars in House 1. I don't get acne unless I'm on my period. Aqua risings are supposed to have clear skin.<br>  <br>  But acne can be due to genetics. Or do you eat a lot of greasy foods? But mostly acne is due to genetics. <br>  <br>  No, it's not a bad thing to be concerned with your looks. I'm the same way.|`|069d241743d397f7bc4dca280e447738aa	Health-wise:<br>  <br>  Venus rules all forms of inflammation regarding glans ( tonsils etc.);  and maladies of the skin, usually due to toxins in the blood or body being released through this organ.<br>  <br>  Mars rules inflammation, and many eruptive diseasess, anything to do with fire and sharp pain, really.<br>  <br>  Thus combined (Venus in Aries) in the first house this could cause acne, since this house rules the face and head in particular. If Pisces is Asc, the diet should be strikly watched and any unusual heavily processed foods, medicines, alcohol and drugs should be strickly avoided.

31tFu0oMaa	lol i think you already know doll|`|WtxzFbvtaa	Simple basic etiquette comes into play here...To resolve the issue, as you enter the bathroom...take note of how the toilet seat is affixed to the toilet...then put the seat where you need it...then put the seat back as it was before you walked in.  Also, I have a rule around here...Any time you enter a room, look for something you can do to make it better before you leave it.  If that is picking up a towel off the floor, stuffing a candy wrapper in the trash or simply straightening a pair of shoes setting next to the wall.  If we all work together, together we shouldn't have to work.<br>  <br>  Edit:  However, I will admit this process works much better in theory.|`|WIlH1LOEaa	Down, if you left a floater!|`|q4pLY5F8aa	Seat up.|`|xXyy51Efaa	It is supposed to be good manners to put the toilet seat down.

It really should be about singing, and nothing else. However, with a show this big, you're going to get some people who go for the money- it's inevitable. So, considering, I think they made the right choice. Those three ARE very good singers, so let's give them a chance.|`|WiTdZAZsaa	no one|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	I voted for Danny and Alexis (she is a great singer,though), but I also really wanted to see the other spot go to Tatiana. Yes, she is a mess but that's because she wanted this so badly. That's passion.  Plus, the girl can SING! So I think she really deserved to still be there.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I totally see where you're coming from. I tried to make the same point last season when everyone complained about how half of the contestants had past record deals or were on Star Search,or whatever. Everyone thought they didn't deserve to be competing in an "ameteur" competition, but I thought they deserved it more because  they actually put years of work and dedication into their dream,but fell short,yet they picked themselves back up and decided to give it one more shot. So I thought they should deserve it more than someone who just decided to audition on a whim, for lack of anything better to do. That's why I was so glad to see David Cook win last season because he's been performing since he was 10, started his first band at 15 and recorded 7 Indie CDs, all before he even auditioned. He paid his dues, so it's nice to see it all finally pay off. I just hope whoever wins this season can appreciate it as much as he did or Tatiana would have. Hopefully they can bring her back as a wildcard because she deserves another shot.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	You're baffled? Most of them sucked.

vqUVWPBAaa	Over the Christmas holidays the CBS soaps made it a point of show casing  V8 Juices as part of Campbell's "Make Every Serving Count" campaign.

I read part of a fan fic story that was SOOOOO poorly written that I had to laugh at what was an attempt at drama. As long as it's written well on a topic I'm a fan of, I'm totally interested in it!<br>  Like if it was Flintstones fan fic and I didn't care for Flintstones, it wouldn't interest me. LOL!

gE3dM9T1aa	You won't necessarily get a girl's interest by what type of music you listen to.<br>  However, you can find girls you share common interests with.<br>  The easiest way to find out if you like the same music as someone is to ask them what their favorite band is or what type of music they have on their mp3 player.<br>  That will give you something to talk about, and might help you catch a girl's interest.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|luSKstMLaa	some chicks like metal , but only like punks.<br>  bands like ;<br>  <br>  Sugarcult (a song called "pretty girl" is a good song. if you like it, and you tell her to listen to it and she digs it. thats a really good sign)<br>  <br>  All time low<br>  Cartel<br>  Mayday parade<br>  yellowcard.<br>  <br>  ect.<br>  <br>  <br>  and for yourself i really recommend<br>  <br>  Bullet for my valentine<br>  korn<br>  slipknot<br>  trapt<br>  SOAD<br>  The prodigy<br>  and papa roach|`|RDegkqjDaa	You're reading into this a bit too much... Music is just common ground for conversation - basically everyone in the world listens to music. Yes, there are loads of girls who like those bands (I love TDG and Nickelback), but it shouldn't matter to her what bands you like. You can use it in conversation, but don't think she'll like/dislike you just because of the bands you like.<br>  Good luck :]|`|d0fc65f726f4bd56a6ce4f789ee11991aa	That's stupid. The girl shouldn't care about what music you listen to. Music is a personal choice for everyone. Someone is always gonna hate a band or singer. <br>  I mean yeah..it would be cool if you guys liked some kind of the same music..like if you're both into guitars or something but that shouldn't matter to her. And also don't be so stereotypical. Not all girls like the same music. Do all guys like the same music? no.<br>  But to answer I'm into alternative mostly, and pretty open to most things. I know plenty of girls who like the bands you like. I personally don't though. See? Not all girls like the same music..|`|X5RIiL7Paa	i dont understand the question|`|bxji3S56aa	man if you're trying to get a girl to like you based on the music you like, you're going for the wrong girls.|`|J36FKvkHaa	My favorite bands of all time are Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd.<br>  My current rotation consists of classic metal - old school Metallica and Sabbath,mostly.<br>  <br>  I've mostly dated guys who are into either ska, "indie," or metal, and those are genres that I totally dig, too. No offense, but those bands make me puke. I would have to walk out of the room if I heard that **** playing.<br>  <br>  Good luck getting your girl, though! ^_^<br>  <br>  EDIT: To the above posters - I'm a girl and I don't like "pop-punk" **** or rap. Wtf kind of girls do you know? That's just gross.|`|6fsBkK7saa	Well, I'm a girl, and I listen to rock/punk/hardcore/metal/etc, and I have friends (who are girls) who like that too, gender doesn't have anything to do with music taste. So don't worry, not all girls think that metal is crap. In fact, many girls love it, it can even be a great conversation starter if you have a similar taste. If a girl you like dislikes metal, it shouldn't be a problem either, I mean, if she likes you, it's becouse of who you are, not your music taste. She won't bother. (If she does, she's not worth it.) Don't worry about it.<br>  Oh, and, Three Days Grace rocks!! :]|`|dYGnVjjoaa	Girls like two types of music.<br>  Alternative and Rap, I'm talking about stereotypical girl from today though.<br>  <br>  Learn to play accoustic songs that girls like to get em interested in you. I think you will do fine, but finding a girl has more to do than just the music you like.|`|oy2KSYpMaa	im a girl and i go weak at the knees for hellogoodbye.<br>  their songs are so awesome.<br>  if youre a metal/harcore/alternative fan you might not like them.<br>  but its worth giving them a shot.<br>  <br>  i mean i used to listen to a hell of alot of metal.<br>  and now im really into hallogoodbye and i go nuts for them.|`|UXUKwJSwaa	You can get a girl with just about any type of music. <br>  You just have to find the right type of girl.
SSD3jj7baa	I hope that he does the show  well, but I really cannot see it happening.  I was really disappointed when Conan announced that Fallon would replace him cause first off no one ever will replace Conan only the show's title.  Fallon has some very large shoes to fill following the names of Letterman, and the great Cone-Bone.  I guess we will all see how well he can do at this job.  <br>  <br>  But right now the only way to answer this question is the way Conan's Triumph the Insult Comic Dog would, Jimmy Fallon would make a great host on Late Night, for me to poop on!|`|euBPdaeQaa	I don't like either, but Jimmy really sucks.|`|1bcYl6SKaa	Well I say give him a chance.  No one thought that Conan could do a good job replacing Letterman.<br>  Also, not to date mymyself too much but I remember when Craig Kilborn (the original host) left the Daily Show and they brought on Jon Stewart and we all went "WTF!!! WHY Jon Stewart???!! Crap this show is going down the toilet"<br>  Now we cannot imagine anyone replacing him...ever.|`|ub23m7Praa	I don't think he will.|`|f9soMMuiaa	To be honest, one or two years in, I think he will get replaced. But again, Carson Daly is been up for half a decade and running. With Jay and Conan on before him, NBC might probably has decided to stop investing in late night and won't care enough for Fallon's quality as a host. So if this is the case, he will stay and we'll get 2 Carson Dalys that no one would watch.|`|w38WJqFGaa	No one is qualified to live up to Conan. NO ONE I SAY, NO ONE!!!!!<br>  <br>  Ahhhh the *** stamp just popped into my head for some reason.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	I hate Jimmy Fallon.

06iOhuHWaa	because Tyra's dumb and wants to be "different"<br>  or maybe cause its a show for female models.. and we have cycles. bahaha. id like to know the real answer to this myself|`|18RphOP6aa	Because the girls change all the time, there's a constant cycle of new models. At least that's my opinion.
1wXYKfJQaa	At the beginning they were called The Quarrymen... but when they startd to get a contract, they changed to The Beatles  as a tribute to Buddy Holly and The Crickets<br>  The Year was 1961 I think|`|FTjgKbJQaa	along time ago|`|CdTe8MO4aa	maybe the name the roaches sounded disgusting<br>  lol|`|ZJZ7JhyNaa	well, they originally had it as the quarrymen, but after a while they had it as "The Beatles"

A1DgICqCaa	thur public records<br>  <br>  <br>  ?dej|`|AA10652430	Yeah. I was surprised it was released like this...<br>  Almost a week or so after the incident. I thought it would take quite a while for the okay to release those photos.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	TMZ has big $$$|`|fRIEHBJOaa	i think it's good, so now chris brown supporters will see what an abusive bastard he is.  people need a reality check. she shouldn't be embrassed, CHRIS BROWN should be embrassed. i feel so bad for rihanna. maybe she needs to see the pic over and over again so that she wont resume their relationship, which so many women do. it's so sad. she loves him, but wants his ABUSE to stop, but i dont see that happening. i'm sure she's hoping that this incident will be the thing to get him help, so they can have a happy life. but of course we all know, nothing is going to change; the abuser just gets smarter.|`|I59qE0WNaa	thats horrible..|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	I don't have a problem with it.|`|fe9gWZJtaa	someone in the police dept thought i can make some quick big cash if i release this pic. scumbag! i hope that they get fired! and for the rest of you how is it public record? just cuz she is a celebrity doesnt give us the right to be all in her business! she is suppose to be protected and if i was her i would sue the police dept for letting this happen!|`|DmRMWfCPaa	Apparently the photo was leaked by one of the LAPD personnels, according to a statement released by the LAPD. They are investigating the issue.|`|P3g90Iowaa	i feel bad that they released it on her birthday<br>  but i have no sympathy for her<br>  she's an asshole if he did supposedly hit her before<br>  she gave him herpes too|`|V3t83pytaa	damn she almost looked dead in the photo i defenitley didnt think it was this bad some charges should for sure be filed.|`|oyr13KYmaa	public record|`|e22d860a438caf4890cabe65ea654fecaa	For the money of course.

nxGLJ0Etaa	A legitimate modelling agency NEVER asks for money. They will most likely take your money and stop returning phone calls and cut off all contact with you. Don't be fooled by this scam!<br>  <br>  Research a good modelling agency, take some poloroid pictures of yourself, or ask a friend to take some headshots and use those to show to the casting agent.|`|1XK93Bl8aa	She's right about the need for a portfolio or even a small collection of shots. Whoever the client is, chances are they'll want to see how your look transfers to film/photos before they even consider booking you. It all depends on the client and what they're looking for though.<br>  <br>  I warn however, be careful. Do your research on the particular agency and maybe even any affiliates of it, in case it's a scam ( yep, it still happens to people all the time ).  $895 seems a bit steep for some portfolio shots.  Handle the finances with the photographer or the studio. You shouldn't have to pay the agency anything tho, if it's legit.  :) good luck.

It needs to be stopped, and stopped NOW... before it's too late. =||`|NYKf3ZPaaa	Twilight is not such a great work of art that it will stand the test of time. It should die out with this generation. Unlike harry potter :] which i think is amazing.|`|pj5bUjbQaa	ha ha  your awesome!!!!  <br>  I actually just read a question where a woman knows exactly where every scene of the movie was filmed!!!|`|CavFs99Waa	I know!

ArNod5F1aa	Well, Drake's first mixtape came out around 06, and another in 07, and then of corse SFG just recently. Drake used a Wayne sample on the 2nd mixtape, and that got Wayne calling him and wanting to record w/ him and sign him. Ive always liked Drake more than Wayne, and when you hear then on the same track, you can tell both take some of what the other's always done, but Wayne is a sell-out, so if Drake wrote some stuff for him, which I have heard he has, i wouldnt be surprised
thcr8Y5vaa	BI RAIN...|`|Isxq5DhOaa	Bi Rain is good but it definately has to be DBSK!!! XD<br>  <br>  =D|`|z7vnbirMaa	DBSK in terms of voice...<br>  Bi Rain in term of dance...<br>  se7en in term of music...|`|JZCAtWezaa	In my opinion, DBSK is the best b/c they are so well-rounded. But in terms of dancing, Rain wins.|`|cy6lepbeaa	DBSK all the way!
