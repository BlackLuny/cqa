20090225145410AA8Jvgc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I'm writing a story! Here's the first chapter! Do you like it?	Little Golden Locket                        I woke up and peaked out my window. Something was very wrong. My mother and father were on their knees with handcuffs on. There was a very tall handsome young man. He had golden brown cropped hair and dreamy green eyes. I ran up and put on the first set of clothes in my dresser. I grabbed my worn-down coat and dashed through the door.     “Let my parents go!” I screamed on the top of my lungs.     “Oh, you must be their daughter Annabelle. I’m Jayden. My father is arresting your parents for stealing food.” replied Jayden.     “Yes, my name is Annabelle and WAIT! You don’t understand my family is poor and we cannot afford food.” I yelled with all my might.     “You can’t just go around stealing food Annabelle. I don’t care how poor you are YOU CAN’T STEAL FOOD! It’s against orders!” proclaimed Jayden.     “So, where are my parents being taken to and how long?” I questioned.     “They are going to prison for a few weeks. I can’t say exactly how long because that depends on their behavior. Could be weeks or could be months.” Jayden announced with a grin.     “Very well then!” I expressed firmly,      “Can I ad least say goodbye to them?”     “If you must!” Jayden said with a sigh. I walked over to my crying parents.     “Mom! Dad! Please don’t leave me!” I cried.     “You will do well on your own. Trust me!” stated my tired old mother as her and Dad were on their way to prison.     Great, now what do I do. I’m alone with no food and no one to love me. I walked back to my house hoping to get some sleep.   Several hours pasted. I got up and made breakfast. I could hardly move knowing I might not be able to see my parents ever again. I turned on the electric stove and placed a black pan on it. I got two eggs from the fridge and cracked them into the pan. I stirred the egg white and the yoke in circular motions. I turned off the stove and poured the egg into my dish. I added some butter for extra flavor. I poured a cup of orange juice and then sat down at the kitchen table. I ate and then fell asleep again on the couch. I slept through lunch and dinner. By the time I woke up it was midnight. I scrambled into my room and onto the bed. I fell asleep again hoping this nightmare would go away.   I woke up and cleaned up the house. I cleaned all my plates, pans, utensils, and cups. I had the same eggs again, and I made them the same way. When I was done with breakfast I thought I would write in my journal for a little while. I got this journal for my sixteenth birthday--- since it’s the only thing we can afford.                                                                                                                                  February 25, 2009   Dear Diary,    Yesterday I met this amazing guy. His name is Jayden. We talked for a little while but then I was tired so I just went inside and fell asleep. I made eggs for breakfast. I hope I get to see this guy again!   I heard a knock on the door so, I went to answer it. It was Jayden. Jayden walked over to me with a smile. I never noticed how his skin glows in the sunlight.     “I can take care of you!” Jayden smiled.     “Excuse me? How old are you?” I asked.     “I’m seventeen! Do you think I’m too old to hang out with  a sixteen year old?” he laughed.     “I don’t need a babysitter!” I quoted trying to walk away but, he stopped me.     “Don’t consider me as a babysitter. Consider me as a friend hanging out with a friend!”     “Alright then. If you insist. Where should we go?” I explained.     “I think it’s time for lunch.” He said as I looked down.     “I don’t have any food remember?” I tried to explain to this gorgeous stranger.     “That’s okay. I’ll give you food. Come to my place.”     “Okay thanks! Where is your house?” I asked.     “It’s on the lake.” He smiled.     “You own that beautiful house on the lake?” I was so amazed.     “Yep! Let’s go!”     As we walked I was beginning to think I actually like this guy. He was perfect. His cropped golden brown hair matched his green eyes perfectly. He was wearing a blue button down shirt with dark navy blue jeans. It was a lot better than what I was wearing. I still had on my long pink shirt with my ripped up jeans with holes on the knees! My hair was frizzy with static. I kept trying to fix my hair when Jayden wasn’t looking.   I was in shock when we reached the house. It was gorgeous. The front door was a light brown wood color. The walls on the outside were gray stones. His roof was brown hay colored stone. It looked like a two story house. He grabbed the door and let me go in first. His first room in the house was a big hallway filled with dozens of portraits. The rug was blue and the walls wear a pearl white. I walked down the hall with him carefully studying every portrait. There was one I came across that looked exactly like me. The caption said “My Dream Wife!” Is he engaged? Did he have a fiancé? I wanted to ask but I was too shy.    We reached the end of t

20090225150913AAsMIx8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I want to be an author, but I doubt I can make a living off it. How do I go about it?	I'm 16 years old (female), and for years, my dream has to been to be an author and make novels for teenagers alike. I've started on one, and I've been working on it for a few months. It's pretty long (mostly because I love to blab on - it's just my talent), and I dream to one day get it published.      However, even though it's in my dream to make novels, I doubt I can make a living out of it, unless my book is successful (that's basically saying I'd like to live off winning the lottery). I've never given it a second though, to what else I can do besides writing (I can not be a journalist - I suck a lot at structure writing, I can only write freely and creatively like in a novel) for a living.      I don't know... I just never gave it a thought till now. But in any case... I wanna get this book published by the end of the year. Is it possible? If I finish it 2-3 months from now, can it be possible for me to get it published before 2010? Keep in mind i have no idea how the publishing process goes.      Thanks in advance.

20090129004658AAaFFv7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please read is there anything wrong with my story? is it not good?	i post my stories on fiction press but get hardly any reviews can some one tell me is their anything wrong? i thought this was one of my better ones! please help       World Domination      Prologue      “Tomorrows the day, peter are you ready,” the taller of the two boys addressed the shorter one who sat in the corner of the small dark room.      “How many times are you going to ask me that question,” peter responded irritably.      “Well it’s just never been this close before, everything we’ve planned so far, I just can’t believe were gunna do it.”      “What you feeling a little scared?”      “**** no man, my bodies flowing with adrenaline right now!” said the boy his voice booming with excitement, he had almost forgotten to whisper due to his mother and farther who were sound asleep in the other room. Still thou I wonder what its gunna be like after we do this. We probably won’t be here anymore.      “I got over that a long time ago man, I thought you did to, Jesse.” Said peter.      “Well if we do die tomorrow then at least we’ll finally know.”      “Know what?” asked peter who was now drifting off into a deep sleep, his voice was weak almost a whisper.      “The secrets, of the universe!”      the sun rose the next morning illuminating the dew covered grass and the glistening street’s, it was over all a beautiful morning, no one could foretell the horrible events that could possibly occur that day. The two boys got up and dressed them selves in all black, they filled there back pact’s and stuffed there clothes with as many guns as they could fit.      They headed down the stairs earlier then normal for they did not want to say good bye to anyone in the house. They placed the backpacks in the back seat, got in the car and took off on the road to school.      “Do you remember the plan?” asked Jesse who was seating in the driver’s seat of the car and seemed to be a little nervous.      “For the umpteenth time, yes I do,” peter responded obviously annoyed by the other boys constant nagging.      “Ok just making sure.”      The boys arrived at school in almost no time; they had only lived a few miles away.      “Were early,” said peter.      “Damn it!” the boy screeched. If we wait its gunna feel like a ******* life time! I knew we shoulda waited and ate breakfast with mom and dad like normal.      “Be patient, were early there’s nothing we can do about it there’s no use in complaining.” Said peter calmly, he had always been the calmer one of the two he had a emotionless expression that he wore on his face all the time, it seemed as if he saw no good in the world. He had smooth bronze skin and very short hair; it was obvious the boy was black. The other one Jesse was a white boy with curly black hair; he was the impatient one who always wore an aggravated expression, he was tall but skinny and wore bifocals, he seemed as if he was the target of constant bullying.      “These people have gone by free for to long!” the boy bellowed. They should suffer like they make me suffer every day!      “And they will,” said peter finally a faint smile appearing on his face. In exactly 15 minutes. Suddenly there was a knock at the passenger door. Both boys looked but there was no one there. They turned to each other in silence, their hearts pounding had someone figured out their plan? No that couldn’t be if they did know then why would they come directly up to the van filled with guns and explosives. Peter slowly opened the door and pulled a small black pistol that had been tucked in his pants, he held it behind him thou never exposing it. Standing right in front of him as he steeped out of the vehicle was a man he had never seen before.      “Who are you, what do you want?” peter demanded, still hiding the gun behind his back.      “I know of your plan,” said the man blatantly. Shock caught peter off guard, his eyes widened and his facial expression changed from one of calmness to one of anger as he revealed the gun from behind his back aiming it directly at the mans chest.      “I don’t think you’d want to do that,” said the man.      “And why the **** not?” demanded peter, Jesse was now frozen in his seat fearing the police were out side.      “Because I have the bigger guns my friend,” the man rose his hands as if he had just revealed something amazing, and he had. Two men stepped from behind the boy’s car baring 2 rifles. Realizing he was out matched peter slowly placed his weapon on the ground. I’m not here to stop you thou. Peters face lit up once again with shock.      “What do you mean?” asked peter who was now completely confused. After hearing the turn that the conversation had taken Jesse now stepped out of the truck and slowly walked around to the passenger’s side.      “Then why a-are y-you here?” asked Jesse trying to sound tough and confident but to no avail.      “Merely a suggestion, you could walk into this school and murder everyone inside, you may feel like gods but after today it’s all over, you may even loose your lives. Your revolution will be small and p

I wrote a story in Lizzies POV (lizzie is the girl that talks to jacob in the Park page 333 of Breaking Dawn)   Here is what i have so far..... tell me wat ya think         I was walking toward the picnic tables where my friend, Jenna, was waiting for me when a tall good-looking guy walked by me starring in my eyes. He looked like he was focusing on something. He looked at me for about 30 seconds and then finally stopped with a disappointed look and a sigh. Maybe he was looking for someone. Oh well I thought.      When I got to Jena she started talking full speed like always.    “Well yea so after I left I walked by this really…. Hot guy looked like he thou-” I interrupted her    “Wait what? Say that again”    “I was talking to Tabatha and she had to leave so I was walking here and some big tan guy walked by me starring real deep into my eyes….kinda weird he looked like 20 so he is only 3 years older…. Hmmmmm… maybe I should go talk to him”    “Big tan guy? Yea he was starring at me earlier. Looked like he was looking for someone. You shouldn’t go talk to him though.”   “Why?” she asked.   “Your not legal age so don’t get your hopes up.”   “You gonna go talk to him? No hottie is gonna notice you. You’ve never had a boy friend”   That was rude. She was implying she was prettier then I.   “Yeah, I think I will”   “Your weird sometimes Lizzie” She mumbled.   “I know, I said under my breath”      I walked in the direction he was heading for earlier. I ended up in the parking lot. He stood against a black Vanquish, his back to me.
20090129005532AAED9nE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would like some feedback on a short dialog piece i have written?	basically this is a more or less philosophical exchange between a more or less pessimistic man, and a optimistic girl. their ideologies clash all the time, and this is just a short example i made in a few minutes. it starts with the girl asking the question, mid discussion. not that i purposely didn't put any in between thoughts and actions or descriptions because, as i have said, i made the dialog in a few minutes, and its just an idea right now. this can also be considered a part of one of my earlier writings, though not the same excerpt:      "are you giving me a lecture of a battle between good vs evil?"   "the thing is, people have neglected to tell that evil has already won, there was no fight, there is no battle. there is no good left to be found."   "what about me?"   "the few good left, is a dieing breed, and is overshadowed by the evil that exists. even the beauty of your light is darkened and cannot be seen through the thick cloud that has been casted."   "you know...in the darkest of our nights..event he darkest of our days..the light which we are shines the brightest."   "i think its YOU who's giving me the lecture."   "i think you might be right."   "im trying not to think."   "good. its a bad habit."          "...how come i cant see it then?"   "see what?"   "this "light" that you speak so highly of. how come i cant see it?"   "maybe its cause you turn away from it, close your eyes and shut yourself away from it. or because you run from it. maybe its cause your too scared to look into it. i don't know. its something you should be asking yourself. but i do know this..and you do too. wherever there is light. anywhere there is even the smallest source, darkness vanishes. it runs. fear strikes it, and it disappears."   "are you saying that i am this darkness? the very thing i want gone?"   "that...and imagine what would happen..imagine what it would be like, if we all chose to be the light that we are- instead of denying ourselves. imagine if we all chose to play the role of the good."   "ive learned that imagining and hoping, only leads to disappointment."   "then your denying yourself of what makes you human."

Hey everyone, I have a propane bottle (a little smaller than a 2 liter soda bottle) with a blow-torch tip, with an adjuster to let out a certain amount of propane. I light the end with a flint or a lighter. If I purchased the right glass rods, would I be able to use that as a glass-blowing torch to practice to see if I would like to get into the industry? Also, where would I be able to purchase beginners rods, for making things such as tobacco pipes, water pipes, as well as other items that would be sold at a tobacco store? I'm thinking about opening my own store, and have no experience at all, but am very interested in art / design. Any help would be greatly appreciated. If that blow torch wont work at all, then any links as to where I would buy an appropriate beginner glass-blowing torch would be great. If anyone has any online guides as reference to blowing pipes and such, that would be a great help too. Thanks in advance, Zach.

20090129005331AAzvrIQ	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How Do we Unifying Light Workers and Peace Makers to bring peace to the world? Does it help? Pl suggest ideas?	There is very urgent requirement of peace to this world. And we also know that there are millions of people who are seeking peace. The problem is that they are not unified in their approach. There are millions of beautiful souls on this earth who are mediators, healers and channels etc. Different ways, methods are employed to bring peace. I wonder what if all such positive forces unite together. No doubt Golden Age will not be far away, in that case...   This is not the time to think of individual path, religion or philology. This is the time of unification. Future religion is no-religion. Future religion is universalism. Let us try to unity different ways and methods into one unified approach to bring peace.  This is an attempt to unity such workers with . No religion. No boundaries. No sermons. No leaders. No membership.  Just awareness of One humanity.   On 26th February 2009, Thursday, we have arranged a unique Event at Bangalore (Koramangala Indoor Stadium).  It is channelling Light by all the gathered for 7 minutes from 19.30 hours (IST) for healing the world.  We appeal to everyone to join us from your own places, at the same time, to channel the Light.     The technique is very simple. Sit comfortably. Close your eyes and relax. Imagine that there is a huge globe of bright white Light above you. Imagine Light from the globe descends, enters and fills you up. Experience the Light for a minute. Then imagine the Light spreading out around you filling up your home, locality and then the entire earth. Spread the Light for seven minutes.   Millions of Light workers are expected to participate in this movement. Millions of astral beings, masters are blessing this movement from the higher planes.  We the humans need to carry the light and love showered by the masters from the higher planes.    The Light has Intelligence, Power and Future.  The Light is God. The Light brings Change in hearts, nature and environment.  There will be no conflicts.  No wars.    Let the Movement spread through you.  Channel the Light and pass on the message.    Visit  http://www.lightchannels.com/      Light channeling video on youtube:  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=CYY54HKCuV...    Help yourself and help the world.      Divine Love

Tudo o q nasce morre. Um dia o nosso sol irá explodir, eliminando qualquer possibilidade de vida no nosso sistema solar.      Dentro da Terra, a quebra de átomos aquece o manto. O manto mais quente é mais leve e sobe, onde se solidificou formando a crosta terrestre. Esse movimento de convex?o do manto move as placas q formam a crosta, formando os abalos sísmicos. Os abalos formam o relevo, enquanto q o intemperismo (chuva, vento, gelo, temperatura, a??o antrópica) o destrói.   A crosta vai aumentando de expessura a medida q mais manto vai se soldificando. Vai chegar uma hora em q a crosta vai estar t?o grossa q o manto ? irá conseguir movê-la, ent?o a atividade endógena cessa. Cessa a forma??o de relevo e só resta a destrui??o do relevo.   O intemperismo transformará a Terra em uma esfera lisa, como a lua. Sem relevo ? há rios nem mares, ou seja, n?o há modo de sustentar nosso padr?o de vida.      Se tudo irá acabar numa explos?o, no assoreamento total dos rios e mares ou por uma bala perdida n?o importa.    O q importa é q um dia a nossa vez irá chegar, e mesmo deixando descendentes, sabemos q no futuro n?o haverá quem nos descenda pois eles ser?o destruídos pelo curso natural das coisas ou por um projétil metálico.      Ent?o por que vivemos? Para onde vamos? Onde vamos almo?ar? Será q estou pensando em coisas demais? Deus existe e o nome dele é Newt? Devo parar de ler O Guia do Mochileiro das Galáxias?

20090129013848AApager	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Critique my story piece?	Well, I have already posted this story piece, but I have edited it and tried to make it sound better. It is quite rough and probably very lame, but I would just like to know your opinions, and if you have any pointers or tips, please feel free to tell me!   I do not actually know where this story is going or what it will be about, I just felt like writing so I did!   Thanks :)               Tony Chen shivered as  he stepped in off the cold, busy, city street.   He smiled slightly as he entered the doorway of his favourite French restaurant.(Name Unknown yet) Feeling the warmth of the restaurant's interior, the cold, stiff, muscles in Chen's body relaxed and he made his way over to the front desk.   The young host welcomed Chen with a warm smile, took his coat, checked for his name on the list and guided Chen over to his table. Glancing around, Chen admired the elaborate decorations and furnishing the restaurant boasts. Lining the red, white and blue feature walls,  hung dozens of beautiful French paintings depicting French chefs, food and wine.   Chen's table was number 14, his favourite. Mainly because it was ove4r near the left-and corner of the restaurant, where it was more private and secluded, and also the warm glow of the crackling fire nearby, added to the appeal. A smile spread across Chen's face, he could remember so clearly the night he proposed to his wife, at this very table.   The young host pulled out a chair for Chen and clicked his fingers sharply, summoning a waiter.   Chen seated himself graciously and settled in. A waiter dresses in a white uniform hurried over and handed Chen an extensive wine list. Handing the list back with his choice, Chen glanced down at his gold watch.    Three minute past eight.   “Messieur? I have your wine here for you.” A deep voice said.   Chen looked up to see the waiter holding a bottle of red wine.   “Thank you.” Chen smiled, as the waiter poured a glass. Chen ran his fingers through his short, dark hair, flecked with the odd middle age grey, and straightened the tie on his grey suit.      Chen sipped his drink and pondered what his client, Suzanne Molan, wanted tp discuss with him tonight. Frowning a little, he wondered why Molan had not returned his calls. Chen had not spoken with her apart from their initial meeting at Rosewood Legal Services. As a lawyer, Chen found it frustrating when he had little to no contact with his clients, and Miss Molan was proving to be very elusive. He had called her several times during the week, but to no avail.   A glimmer of red in the corner of Chen's eye stirred him from his deep thoughts.   He looked up and saw her at once.   Standing at the front desk, in enormously high heels, stood a tall attractive and confident looking lady of around thirty. She was wearing a close-fitting blood red silk dress, that drew attention to her slim but curvy figure.   A thick wave of blond hair framed the sharp edges of her face.    The excited young host seemed delighted to have such an attractive customer, Chen watched him check for her name on his list, and walk her across the restaurant to table 14. Suzanne Molan seated herself in the seat adjacent to Chen. “May I suggest a mellow Shiraz?” The young host suggested warmly.   Molan nodded her head and smiled, “Yes, sir, thank you for your suggestion.” Her voice low and soft. Clicking his fingers again, the host summoned a waiter to take Molan's order.   The host hovered at their table, grinning down at Molan whilst the waiter took the order. “Messieur? I think you have customer's waiting.” Molan pointed out, inclining her head towards the front desk.   Turning around to see the line of three groups of disgruntled looking customers, the host replied, “Right you are, mademoiselle, right you are.” He rushed off looking quite disappointed and muttered, “Yes, yes! I am coming!”      Molan then turned to face Chen, and murmured “Good evening , Mr Chen.”   “And to you Miss Molan, and to you!” Chen replied smiling. “So what brings us here tonight. What would you like to discuss?”   “Oh, just a few business matters Mr Chen.” Molan smiled taking a sip of her wine.

Feedback please before i turn it in! any revision would be great! (if you are confused please explain where i wasnt clear)         Without the slightest hesitation, he went to the door of the right. With all eyes on him and the arena silent, he opened the door the only noise coming was he squeaks of the door. There were no roars or growls, just silence. Relief spread throughout him; he knew he could trust her. He knew that she wouldn’t betray him for she was his lover. He thought the worst was over and took a step back as he awaited his bride. He turned around to give the princess a smile of gratitude. She looked pale, anxious. She tried to hide her sorrow and regret, because she knew it was right. It was the best, but still she wondered had she made a mistake? Then the strangest thing happened; the sand on the ground behind the door crunched. Very slowly and steadily were footsteps. Out flew the tiger with a menacing roar! The crowd went wild as the all stood up to get a better view. He was ripped to shreds, torn limb from limb. The princess couldn’t bear to watch so she turned around. But nothing could drown out the sound of his shrieking of this horror. The same image running through her head drove her insane. She had done it! She had to pretend this did not affect her so. The king was there and so were her people. So the princess just sat there with her eyes closed. Not cheering or her eyes watering, all she did was sat there waiting. She had done what no one had done and prided herself in it. So why did she feel a twinge of regret? Shortly afterward, the crowd dispersed, some mumbling, some shouting, some still sobbing and asking why. The princess sat, unmoving, eyes still closed, until every one of them had left. Whispering to her father that she’d like one more moment to gather her composure, he too left, and she found herself alone with the man she’d loved. She opened her eyes and looked into the arena. There left the remains of his mangled body. But this was not her fault! She would not have been pushed to such extremes had another woman but the wretched bride to be had been waiting behind the door on the left. So the princess would not blame herself! And the woman that her lover had loved would be punished. She would pay. For if she couldn’t have him, then no one else would.

     i hoped so...      i pulled up to our meeting spot in the infamous red BURB   he called me over to his spot   and then came the nerves...      we both jumped out our SUVs   blood pumping fast   so damn weak in the kneees!      as i walked on over he stood there so inviting   i blushed and skipped quickly right over   we hugged and DAMN it was so exciting      ya...our hugs are truly something else (:      that night was magical; got a little tipsy off our beers   he smiled as i dragged him on the dance floor;   told me he hasn't done this in years      we laughed and talked and danced and smiled   i could tell right away   his spirit was hiddin, perfect, just like a childs      and so from that night on i felt it was my job   to always show him the brighter side   to let him kno he can always have fun; that that side of him hasnt yet been robbed      we grew to like....and even to love   it was something more than just a fling   hes more like a gift from above      but then i was stupid and hurt him real bad   things didnt end up working out;   we lost everything we'd grown to have      i thought long and hard about how to make things right   i knew at that moment   i had smothered a glowing flame; i lost an inner light      so i came to my senses; and had to speak from my heart   i knew i couldn't lose him   but i also had to be smart      i could not lie anymore, he didnt deserve it   further more, he was my best friend   and there was no way i was gunna quit      i let him know just how much i really cared   even tho   i may not have always been there...      tom has taught me so much about being a good person   and i knew what i had to do   get him back into my life; and lead a life just as he dooo      he inspired me once again to be all that i could be   i worked with him to understand his pain   and he worked to set his misery free      as the trust grew again, so did our minds   we began to realize that lifes not always so easy   but its about enjoying the suprises & the unlikely finds      hes more than a lover to me now, a best friend, or a mate   he's someone i choose to look up to   when my body soul and mind feel out-of-state      he encourages me all the time   and i love him to death   from our movie dates to our stop and shop sundaes   his spirit comes alive in my every breathe      though our relationship is clear as muddy water   there is one thing ill always know   one thing that will never be slaughtered...      and that's that our bond is deep; we have eachothers back   we can understand fuly   how to keep our love down pat      its about accepting our love for what it is   not then, not later   but for what it presently is...      no matter what we will always have eachother   through thick and thin   through any kind of weather      he knows i'm here for him to be himself   he knows i'll do my best   to share my compassion, smiles, and wealth      and by wealth i don't mean money   rather i mean the abundance...   the abundance of joy i feel when i can call him my honey!      my lover, my friend, my strong soldier boy   whatever we may be   i'm always here, before and after his deploy      oh ya...did i mention he's leaving me!   yes he's leaving for iraq   to go and discover first hand, what he can truly be      im not worried or sad, no those emotions aren't for me   i'm excited and proud   of my tommy B.      he's a naturally born leader and i know he will always prevail   whatever may happen   he'll always put up his sail      strong and intellectual   he will become unstopable   he swears he's the man   and i'm beginning to believe its really not all that unprobable !      now if he only knew, all that i can see   he would know just how amazing he is   he would have no problems, none but me..
