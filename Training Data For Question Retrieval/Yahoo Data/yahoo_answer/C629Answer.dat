That's HIS child and as long as he is not breaking her arm, and molesting her, shyt you need to take your police self and write a ticket on your azz for being all up in someone elses household. It really ticks me off how others are meddling in other peoples affairs with 1/2 the story. The Holy Bible speaks of this: Take the plank out of your own eye, before you try to take the plank out of someone elses. That means mind your own business and when you do something happens you can see clearly. And you're not seeing cleary you're just being messy!!!

Tell your friend that you are worried about her and that you are there when she needs you.|`|ANsznbWsaa	I wouldn't tell on him if it was only once, but call child services immediately if it happens again. But I'm confused, if he beat her up I'd call right away. If he just hit her once, then I wouldn't.  He doesn't deserve to have his child taken away and a strike on his record for a mistake. I don't know that's up to you though.|`|IdXKAU84aa	That's a very difficult situation.

WgdduoRDaa	That you are still very young, you are still becoming comfortable in your own skin. Its okay to be confused or curious. Trust me as you get older it gets worse. Be patient, and, if you feel comfortable talk openly with your parents if they are good people.

She's not over her ex-boyfriend, either, so if I were you, I'd move on.|`|Nw8xop5qaa	She's more than likely telling your friends more of the truth. Also, she's probably in the state of mind of not wanting to hurt you. She's going on and acting as if every things okay- and she might be trying to force herself back into the mode of liking you, by doing things that couples do. Believe me, there could be millions of explanations and thoughts that are going on in her head. She could be feeling confused, guilty, confused, a wee bit needy, and probably (yet again) confused. She might be bringing up her ex boyfriend due to the fact that she hasn't gotten over him... completely.

Um i cant really think of anything else.|`|xdnZd7WBaa	guys who are confident but not cocky,<br>  sensitive but not emotionally needy,<br>  true to themselves and their beliefs but not a prude who won't listen to others beliefs and ideas,<br>  nice (genuinely), not in a suck-up type of way|`|PMMX6H1Kaa	funny, honest, self confident, cute, loyal,  the feeling that he will always be there for her when she needs him.|`|5JNzzwzKaa	humor, self confidence, loyalty, and one of the most important, feeling that he is always there for her when she needs him.<br>  <br>  It varies though|`|kp4s5TBhaa	three main things i like in a guy:<br>  <br>  1. intelligence.<br>  intelligence is a huge thing. they've got to have wit. they don't have to make good grades, because grades don't prove anything. i can't stand stupid guys. i won't tolerate it. they're usually the jerks, anyway.<br>  <br>  2. nice.<br>  this includes manners, etc etc. i don't want them to be a push over because i want someone who has their own mind, but they must have morals. as in talking to people in a respectable way. not being all loud and attention seeking. i like modesty and humbleness.<br>  <br>  3. mama's boy.<br>  i love mama's boys. it's so cute. i guess it's because of the fact that it assures me that they're not a jerk to girls.<br>  <br>  looks really don't matter to me that much. it's the personality that determines their attractiveness. i can think someone is so hot, but if they're personality is blahhh, then they start turning ugly to me.|`|1Q1yw0myaa	i like guys who are sweet and sensitive, but they aren't afraid to give you a kick in the a** every now and then.  have to be nice, and funny.  respect is a biggie on my list.  i don't like it when guys take advantage of me either.  fun to be around.  spontaneous, caring, sexy... ;]  i like guys who have a lil muscle on em, not too skinny.  eye color doesn't matter much.  good smile.  piercings are fun (snakebites are hawt). ;] hair has to be long like this: <a href="http://content2.myyearbook.com/zenhex/images/quiz49/243907/243907_res1_231395res1sexy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://content2.myyearbook.com/zenhex/im...</a> . dark hair or light.  <br>  <br>  yummy ;d<br>  <br>  <3|`|MpOdHSNDaa	well one of the most important thing is for him to be funny, outgoing and sweet another thing is for them to be sweet with his mom woow i love that cause that makes me think that he will be like that with me|`|pVaZty4Maa	everything|`|om6kya7faa	We want you to tell us how  YOU feel .. honesty ... you  being yourself is alwayz a plus ...we like  somebody funny ..and someone who can hold a convo ..|`|vAL1Rahaaa	hugs, kisses, no cheating, dont be a dick face, talking to her, holding her hand,staying up all night not saying a word, <br>  <br>  idk we like most anything, except rude selfish jerks|`|TyQsGapmaa	They like well endowed men.|`|etszzyataa	big ding dong
RK04Jktraa	Wow shadow... that's a little... profound, now isn't it?<br>  <br>  Just relax, trust me, it'll all come naturally.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Awww.<br>  <br>  I would bring a little bunch of flowers (something like daisies which are friendly but not mushy).  Just talk to her the same way you would anyone else.<br>  <br>  At the end of the date, offer to pay for her, but if she says no, then let her pay. If you pay after she says no she might feel obliged to go on another date ;)|`|yiKrPkdiaa	the key to any relationship is honesty. i think that the best thing you can do first is let her know that you are a little nervous. that will make the environment less awkward. you should not feel obliged to buy her flowers. personally, i would find it sweet if a guy offered to pay for a cup of coffee, but she shouldn't be expecting you to do something like that. the MOST IMPORTANT thing you can do is be yourself.  NEVER try to fake it. if she's really gonna be the kind of girl whose worth it, you wont lose her after the first date. i hope that helps.|`|tm9egUBraa	The best you can do is to act calm. It's only a first date so I don't think you should act too desperate here. Depending on the girl flowers could be ok, or it could be a turn off so it might be best not to get them. As for paying, the way you make it sound is that its more of a casual thing. You're just meeting for coffee right? <br>  If you really want to pay you can offer to, but if she declines don't keep following up. <br>  Just try to keep a conversation going and sound interested.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	I think the best thing for you to do is to be calm and cool..Dont show her that you're nervous; she's probably nervous too. Yeah you should take her out too so  that you dont look as if you are cheap. also just be polite and be yourself, most importantly. It doesn't matter where you meet someone, when it's meant to be; it will be.|`|uq0ga8bcaa	im not sure, if see ask u where u live, DONT!!!! it might be a trick to rob u or something....|`|G1vrftqxaa	if you have enough money to buy her flowers then do so but you do need to pay that shows that you are a man and  you can take care of her cause you is not a baby no more and she is not your mama she dont need to pay for you   dont be nervouse or say stupid things and if she seems bored chage the sublect and dont do all the talking let her talk to       good luck
AA11198190	l would say they obviously enjoy your company.Go with the flow and be friends.<br>  You will know when to back off if you feel like you are being used or whatever.All girls need friendship and company of their own sex.|`|Eug52iQDaa	You're a lucky lady to have two nice women take you under their respective wings.  Accept them at face value until they prove that they have other motives (which I really doubt).  Obviously you're a lady that is easy to be nice to.  Don't change!<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|4NOSvnHHaa	Sounds to me like they want to be your friends! Trust them, hang out with them, go have fun like a normal person should be doing.

I'm not saying like don't be responsible or anything lol, I'm just saying that you should have fun... and trust them. <br>  <br>  They wouldn't hang around so much if they didn't geniunely like you.

But you know what they say, once a cheater, always a cheater. :( Sorry to hear that, and it sounds cliche but you can do better!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	why are you focused on an ex who is a total jackass?  move forward with your life.  he's an ex, and what he did and what he does currently, does not matter.|`|FeRC5jkoaa	Yeah, he's definetly a sociopath.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Why do you care if he's your x?   Leave it be and go on with your life - away from that guy.  You're wasting time thinking about your past.
6zzwFVTaaa	go ballroom dancing, nothing wrong with that<br>  Thinking about sex is normal at your age, all boys do, but don't go out and tell the world (or yahoo)<br>  and women/girls  like emotional warmth,love and affection BEFORE sex <br>  If you can't handle that, pay for it or "help yourself"|`|TyQsGapmaa	Yes ballroom dancing is a sport like figure skating is!

F3LBgfvwaa	I wonder about that too. If anything it's a little sadistic since a girl's first time is usually painful. Men are strange creatures.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Mans ego.|`|2uXNtCUlaa	because it shows she has not slept around with other guys. Like the quote says from Memoirs of a geisha " a man likes it if no eels have been a women's cave"  there are tons of perks.. 1) bragging rights of being the first one to "pop the cherry and 2) no risk of getting an SIT or AIDS|`|Q0rbUZDMaa	I honestly think the whole thing is pointless. And that, especially when it's not a loving relationship, that guys place a lot less emphasis on sex than girls do.<br>  <br>  but please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  It is not a question of being her first or a virgin girl. It is Human to err.<br>  Love fundamentally is dependent on TRUST. If that is missing it is no Love|`|q2POh1dEaa	no diseases|`|2U0BtIZ8aa	i think that guys tend to choose girls who are version because:><br>  <br>  1. they have no STD or STI<br>  2. the girl could give it to anyone, and they choose him. it boost his self esteem<br>  3. she is not experience, so the guy feel over power<br>  4. they get to control and b an *** about it (this depends on the guy thou)<br>  5. they think its sth worth bragging about coz they took the virginity of a "virgin"<br>  edit:<br>  6. they got nothing to compare too<br>  7. they are innocent and cute<br>  (as other had mention)<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|vRmAMmh0aa	Well first you know that the chances of catching anything are brought to a minimal, and it's going to feel better than a girl who's "been around". There is also the fact that most of girls want "the right guy" to be there first so it makes the guy feel as if they level up to this standard that's usually set.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	Well I want to be a girls first because I am a virgin too... And it would mean a lot to me to lose my virginity to a virgin. I don't wanna be with a woman who has more experience than me.<br>  <br>  For guys in general.... virgins are innocent which is incredibly attractive, they're clean, and you know they have nothing to compare your abilities to so you will be their best.|`|AA12377177	Virginity is overrated. Insecure guys like women with no expeience so they have nothing to compare them too. By the time most women are 25...they remember their 1st time as being nothing but bad and akward sex.<br>  <br>  Some men need a women who know how to handle a "set of tools". A 1st timer just can't do the job right.|`|TyQsGapmaa	Any girl who is not a virgin when she marries is a whore and should stoned in the street!|`|gQ1KzUByaa	Its a mental state of mind that you have like a certain power over her.|`|As1UneW9aa	it's a sentimental thing.|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	they're more of a challenge|`|AA10671601	Most girls don't want their first (****) to be with a random person they want it to be with someone special, someone that cares for them, but after that n after they break up the girl kinda does any guy|`|xFueK4ZFaa	well arrogant guys say think its important to be first because not only did they take something away that they can never have back, but they got a "tight" pussy.<br>  <br>  <br>  assholes....  (:|`|uYJdvnqxaa	I'm not a guy,but I would guess because it makes him feel special.Because she decided to give it away for the first time,and she chose him.
8e581713f59c039fe027d13dcc6d5f76aa	I think she would have broken up with you if that was her intention.  It sounds like she is confused about where your relationship stands and wants to step back and take a look at things and have some space to herself.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just depends on how she feels afterwards.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Usually a "break" happens before you actually break up... sorry man =(|`|EmUhDWxZaa	since im a girl i mite kno watz going on,wen a grl stopz loving u it MITE mean that shez happy with another guy or she thinks you're cheating but im not sure,u should talk 2 her and c watz on her mind,dont chase after sum1 who isnt worth it!|`|NV9lGq87aa	she wants to go out with other people and see if she cares for them like she cares for u or if they care for he like u care for her|`|yeJ8HT8Oaa	breaks usually lead to break-up.|`|5ojgFcmGaa	i think she just confused atm. give her a little break and maybe that's what she just needs|`|uq4wHTAKaa	Sorry babe, it is the end.

Steve Felmley, says two of the women shoved the victim in a car Friday and took her to a Border Patrol station.<br>  <br>  A Border Patrol agent, Michael Bermudez, said Monday they took no one into custody and called police to deal with the women.<br>  <br>  The police spokesman says they don't ask crime victims whether they are in the country legally, so the 28-year-old is free.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the three women are being investigated for unlawful imprisonment.<br>  <br>  Felmley says, "I don't think this plan is working out the way they thought it would."<br>  <br>  (with information from Bellingham Herald)|`|IvMPh09baa	yes... she gonna come kick your *** when your sleeping.<br>  <br>  if i were you, i would sleep with one eye open.<br>  <br>  either that or go back to work at the whore house where he originally met you.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	You will always have to watch your back.  If I ever catch the woman that my husband had an affair with, I would blind side her, with embarrassing comments.  I wouldn't hit her, but I'd let everyone around us know that she slept with my husband and ruined our marriage (as did he).  Why wouldn't I hurt her?  You should have thought about this before you slept with a married guy.  Too bad for you.|`|dXs0A2xlaa	well my advice is to pack your bags and leave town. obviously that whife is going after you! GOOD LUCK!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <3/ gretch|`|ITfBQzg6aa	Duh ***** wat you think is gonna happen she gonna ****** let you sleep with her husband??<br>  <br>  That's how Dumb bitches get killed..|`|6b7eeb4f41fa6f871211ccd21d079e24aa	Does she know?<br>  <br>  Not sure about that. <br>  <br>  Did you stop seeing him?|`|5Xp59a3Iaa	If you were sleeping with my husband and I knew, I'd be all for an attack too. I'm sorry, but as an about to be married woman I find it a shame that you act like you're "offended" by the idea that married wives get so defensive. <br>  <br>  It's not a sacred union for nothing, sweetie. And don't try to justify it by saying you're not the first he's been with. Personally, I think all and any partners a married man, or woman even, has had other than their spouse should be tied up, lined up and put in front of a firing squad.<br>  <br>  More power to the spouse if they pick up a gun and join in.<br>  <br>  It's nature. Try to take a cub from a lions den, get eaten. Try to take a married man's attention from his wife, get beaten.<br>  <br>  That's the way it has been, and so it well should be!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	While you might be "the other woman" the man is the one who strayed.<br>  <br>  Sometimes women in your position have intimacy issues and they select married men because these guys are actually unavailable... no strings.<br>  <br>  Most married women realize it when their husbands are cheating.  So, if you're not dead by now, maybe she doesnt' care.|`|AEN68aJgaa	Oh yes, she will find out sooner or later.  Trust me. It may take a while...but she'll find out.<br>  <br>  She'll look at his phone, she'll ask around, she'll start putting two and two together...<br>  <br>  I know, I am THE wife and know what I need to know about the OTHER WOMAN.<br>  <br>  If you stopped seeing him...continue to do just that, don't do this "ping-pong" thing with him.<br>  <br>  Although I never did anything to harm the other woman...only called her mother's house and told them who I was...<br>  <br>  I would never physically do anything to her.  My time is too precious.|`|7aoHmM4baa	i have a feeling that you are trying to joke<br>  everybody knows your a skak now...anyway<br>  yes if i found out my husband was cheating<br>  i would jump on her and mess up her face bad<br>  then i would call cops on them for etempted murder<br>  i ll twist everything up|`|AMkMHOAyaa	GOD SAYS DO NOT COMMIT ADULTRY SO I SAY YOU FORGET HIM AND REMEMBER GOD YOU WAS TAUGHT RIGHT YOU DONT NEED THAT LITTLE MONEY HE GIVN YOU GO PRAY|`|mtOVRAnbaa	WHAT she deserved to do is stomp your @** still your brains fall out ya head...

It would be harder for her to reach you, and the distance would likely dissipate some of her anger.  Also, because the married man has cheated with several women, she's more likely to be angered at her husband rather than any one woman acting as a home-wrecker.  It's symptomatic of the man's infidelity than any one woman trying to displace her from her home.<br>  <br>  Yes, married men's wives sometimes do attack the home-wreckers.  You have done right by ending this relationship, and I would recommend avoiding these types of relationships in the future to avoid the very fears you're expressing.|`|MePS1Rpsaa	Howdy,<br>  <br>  I'm a wife whose hybby cheated on me.<br>  He told me himself, I had met her earlier this year at a party.<br>  Nope I did'nt take revenge, or anything...<br>  I think it was enough for me to know that he told her that he told me, <br>  she has to live with the fact she ruined 2lives, mine and our son's.<br>  My hubby(we are'nt divorced...yet) also lives with that guily...WAS IT WORTH IT???|`|4Cq268Ofaa	sounds like you are doing her a favor, maybe you should call her and let her know.

He might be more comfortable just calling you by your first name.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Nephew. If you're getting technical you can say he's not your biological nephew, but your sister's stepson.

jTV6rLX3aa	a guy.<br>  <br>  Well, I'm female, but here are my reasons:<br>  <br>  *People tend to not stereotype guys as crazy/overly emotional (even though quite a few guys are). Women do get stereotyped as such regardless of whether or not it is true.<br>  * Words like b*tch, wh*re, c*nt, and **** exist for women. For men, d*ck, *ssh*le, d**che, and b*stard exist. Only, the last two are really insults to women (b*stard being a son of a b*tch..insult ot the mother not the man). Besides, possibly, player, there is no insult to men that insult their promiscuity.<br>  *If a guy gets very drunk, people don't judge him as much as they would if it were a girl<br>  *Guys stick together better/longer than females do <br>  *Smart/motivated females are detested by a lot of insecure guys. Smart/motivated males are typically respected by both genders.<br>  *Guys can eat till they burst and people don't care as much!<br>  * Guys are stereotypically stronger and can often run faster/jump higher/perform more stunts (which I equate to fun)<br>  * Guys can fool around (sexually) without too many repercussions. If a girl does the same, she risks a very dark mark on her reputation.<br>  * Guys get the instant respect which women must work much harder for.<br>  * Guys don't need to worry about a 9-month pregnancy, labor, periods, or menopause.<br>  *Guys can become world leaders far more easily (precedence)|`|5ojgFcmGaa	a boy...life seems so easy for boys but girls have to go through so many stuff but i love the fact the we have always boys there to adore us as well as boys like having their gfs but at the end is like this<br>  both need each other <br>  i mean what would be the world without MEN...<br>  i don't even want to think about it|`|gLeN67HTaa	i think its better to be a guy. there are a lot of reasons. guys dont have to shave/wax, they dont have periods, nobody stares at their chest while talking to them, a haircut lasts awhile for them, one wallet can last a long time where a lot of girls like to change purses (not including me), they can go to a water park and wear no shirt, they dont care if they are sweaty after sports, they dont worry about what to wear, they can have a mustache without people laughing at them (thats obvious...no offense), and it just seems like they dont have a care in the world. <br>  <br>  answer mine please?  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai6b.8br2uG.O48jGK98h0Dsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090215161910AAl9c4W">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Q0rbUZDMaa	I'm a guy and it's more fun to be a guy.

XmJZkFuMaa	Depends. <br>  <br>  If I came in and found them like that, I'd get the gun.  I'd shoot them and kill them quite dead, then claim temporary insanity.  Basically, I'd shoot them in a very lethal place, then empty the clip... it WOULD be temporary insanity to be honest, I'd go nuts...<br>  <br>  If this was long after the fact, I'd let the law handle it because I'd be afraid if I saw the... jerk... I'd go off on him until he was nothing but a bloody pulp.  Or if my daughter was older... right now she's 1 year old so they'd get the full mother bear ripping their faces off with her claws effect.  If she was like 20 or something I might be less "kill them!" reactant.  More "put them in jail til they rot" reactant.<br>  <br>  Add:  To clarify, when I say "them" I mean the rapist, not my daughter.|`|AA11285960	let the law handle it...if you go after them yourself, then you will end up in jail and then the rape victim will be missing her father when she needs him.|`|JO3HiGfHaa	Well that's a clear cut case.

52otNiElaa	It's called a joint. And yes that's bad, you chose the government over your sister.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Yeah that's a bad idea. Now if it was something like heroine you might be doing her a favor by turning her in, but weed isn't a big thing so you should have left the cops out of it.|`|YLezctqpaa	Well atleast they should be<br>  able to stop her, Good luck in the future~|`|JGpirCtLaa	Drugs are illegal, tell your parents or talk to her. If she got in trouble by the cops, maybe she won't do it again and will avoid future trouble.<br>  It's a good thing that you are looking out for her, she could get involved with a lot of bad things later on if you don't do anything about it now.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Say goodby to your sister.|`|S4y7V4diaa	That was dumb of you. You should have just called your parents|`|O1MITmaGaa	yes, I'd say it was a bad idea.<br>  #1 your sister might get into a whole lot of trouble<br>  #2 going to the sheriff shouldn't always be the 1st option<br>  <br>  a better way to have dealt with the problem was to<br>  a) confront her some other time<br>  b) try to encourage her from smoking pot<br>  c) find groups she could join to stop her smoking<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  1. maybe the cops won't arrest her; maybe they'll try to help her out<br>  2. I HOPE. I don't know what cops do. But it probably would've been a better idea to help her and give her a chance before risking her to arrest by the authorities.|`|tot8Q2Faaa	Yes. I have two sisters one is older and one is 2 years from me. And I would never snitch on them. I respect them for who they are. <br>    I am not sure what kind of issues you have with her, but no matter what the problem is I would have never even thought about doing that.<br>    But what can you do now that was then and this is now. I would apologize or tell the cops that I made it up.|`|9aa3974d6e3a58df61ffe6d9c9eaa029aa	Yes, it is bad.  Family should be consulted first.

So yeah if the cops do anything about it you should feel like you ruined a life.|`|TFrJBvxHaa	wow. wow. You my friend, are so naive its gross.

Its called a joint.. anyway sounds like u are trying to cause trouble...
OmIu2vkwaa	First of all, hell yeah to a man who wants to give his woman pleasure! :) That's the way it should be! ;) I used to never have the confidence to let a guy what I liked in bed, but now that I've been with my man for 1.5 years I've learned you have to let him know. At first I'd let him know what I liked by moaning louder or he'd notice my breathing increase or feel my pelvic muscles flexing in pleasure. So I'd say first to pay attention to the signs her body is giving you. If she is laying there limp, you're not hitting that magic spot. I'm assuming you know what a clitoris is, and also that it's her key to pleasure. Before my man even goes down on me I like him to kiss me and I like to feel his skin on mine, and even him go after your basic erogenous zones. Try kissing her collar bone and shoulder blades, and then move slowly down her torso until you reach her pubic area (where the hair is/or would be) and kiss her softly there using your tongue a little bit. Slowly kiss all around her clitoris and once she seems antsy or can't take it anymore start first by licking it slowly, making sure its nice and moist. Women typically get off the same way a man does. We need constant stimulation, if you mix it up every few seconds it might feel good, but once you find that stroke she loves. go to town. Good luck.|`|8pCGMSFYaa	no worries. you will get it. just have to pay attention to her reactions/cues to the different things that you do while you're down there with your tongue. dont be afraid to try things with it. it can be as simple as just moving it around @ first, my boyfriend wasnt great @ it, but he was the first ever to make me come from it. the best thing to do is suck on her cLitori s. thats the most sensitve part. focus on the clit, but then kind use the tongue to explore the vaginal area, then return to the clit.  try to relax & get comfertable doing it. dont think negative thoughts. just go with it, you'll catch her one day.Gosh, its the best feelling in the world. makes me feel guilty when i come from it. good luck. practice will make perfect.|`|LYausP2Eaa	1.start off slow around clit area<br>  2.lick clit area<br>  3.nibble<br>  4.bite<br>  5.follow her every movement<br>  6.look into her eyes<br>  7.hold onto her hips<br>  8.follow her every movement even when she moves<br>  9.keep licking as hard as you can<br>  10.stick it up in her as far as you can<br>  11.finger her at the same time<br>  12.make sure your both comfortable<br>  13.watch porn|`|nETw4eOKaa	keep practicing.<br>  i like when my man put's his tounge in my whole.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Well first thing is every woman enjoys it just a little differently you need to get her to open her mouth and tell you when your doing a good job.  Women do not all the time react in a way you can tell you hit the spot or your tempo is right.  The usual way that gets most women off is to just lick the clitoris hood and don't stop try to breath slowly.  I like to use my finger and get the clitoris uncovered if its not erect and out and lick directly on it. Some women can't handle this some LOVE it. Usually place my upper lip above the clitoris my tongue licking and HUMMMM a little.  Pressing hard into the vagina with the tongue makes some women go wild right away.  BUT the key is to get her talking to learn what she personally likes.|`|AA12135516	Practice makes perfect but until then, concentrate on her clitoris but don't be too rough (unless she likes it that way.) You should be able to tell by her movements if you are on the right spot & if you are whatever you do don't alter your position. There's not much room down there to miss the clitoris so give it time you should be fine.|`|6RgLDckAaa	Lol I AM A GIRL AND I LIKE GIRLS TOO AND THE ONLY THING I CAN TELL YOU IS GIVING ORAL SEX TO A FEMALE IS EASY AS ABC<br>  WHO EVER DOSENT KNOW THAT IS SILLY LOL|`|5XwY9aP8aa	Practice makes perfect.|`|pVaZty4Maa	focus on that one spot {i hope u know what im talking about} and trust me you will do great {i love it when my man does that to me} :)|`|JZtY6Ymmaa	keep practicing even at work...roll your R's i hear Spanish is good for that

wHgBnMipaa	My fiance hates dances too, and the only reason he went to prom with me is because we had been dating a couple of years before it happened.  If I were you, I'd try to figure out what kind of things he is into--sports, video games, movies, etc.--and invite him to do something involving that.  It's your best bet!|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  It is plain simple invite him for coffee at the restaurant. That sets the ball rolling|`|8e6bf87407d27763999b285294398d00aa	If he likes to drink & u have no problem with that, then make him drunk. Dance with him, get little bit tired & make him hot. After that go to bed dance with him again, but this time up down dance.<br>  <br>  He will love dancing forever.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	Most white guys do hate dances. They're crowded, noisy, and it never fails even if the girl says she won't make you once you get there the girl WILL try to make you dance.<br>  <br>  Just do other stuff. Is dancing all you do for fun? Thats kinda sad.... Movies, coffee, dinner, bowling, all sorts of stuff.|`|fKYi3IJ2aa	He sounds like my boyfriend. He probably just doesn't like the whole getting dressed up and being around crowd thing (thats why my b/f doesn't like them). Try something thats not as formal as a dance.

7iEk06aDaa	Your pain is so obvious and I wish that your mom could see it like we do. It sounds like your mom is focusing all of her attention on her 'new' family, and has put you somewhere off to the sidelines, except when she needs to use you, of course. I have said this before to other young adults in your situation, and I'll say it again. It's time to move on with your life. Leave your mother to hers, and focus your attention on your own family. Stop letting your mom rule your heart, cuz it's bound to get broken. Your grown now, it's time to cut hurtful ties that bind and be free to go on with your life. Your mom is all about negativity, and you need to stay positive for your own children and stop letting her poison your thinking. You can do it.|`|Xlpv8WDtaa	screw that *****. prove her wrong.|`|5lXouSKAaa	Wow..<br>  <br>  She should appreciate the fact that you're caring and actually do stuff for her. If your mother can't see you for who you are, then that's her loss. In times of trouble, rely on your friends... or your husband. <br>  <br>  I don't think she hates you. Perhaps she is only taking out her anger on you. Maybe you remind her of something that's happened in the past... Sorry to hear about your situation and hope everything works out for the best.|`|GsRpZJX5aa	try talking to her...if that doesnt work<br>  you can only try to be the best person you can be<br>  it prob sounds hard but if she wants to be rude like that<br>  and not even care about having a good relationship with her<br>  own daughter then forget about it. make urself happy!!!|`|oEfa2myTaa	Look out for your self, life is two short to put of with other peoples problems.|`|mIyUCey4aa	I've been in your situation. Mom chose her abusive husband over me. I tried to help her but when she couldn't help her self I let go. But you know what hun, in the end you have to let go. If she can not appreciate the things you do for her then let her go. You have a family of your own and children that need your attention. Stressing over someone who cares less about how you feel only takes away time from the things that are important and a priority in your life. I have 2 kids of my own with a 3rd on the way, I'm 24 going on 25 and have been married for 6 years. My mom is a total nut. I don't allow her around my kids because she is irresponsible and ruthless. If she calls, it only needs to be of good news as I don't have time for drama. Something you must realize dear is that you are in control of your own actions. As much as you'd like for her to come around, and no matter what you do to try and make her change her ways towards you, it is up to her in the end. You just make sure since you now are a Mother that you give that unconditional love to your children as you wish it was given to you.|`|GcIcwHLPaa	Mediate and confront.<br>  <br>  Ask her what is the issue, get it out on the open. It's not fair to be treated like that by the one's closet to you.|`|7xcuZlkwaa	She may just be really caught up in what shes doing<br>  <br>  i dont think she hates you just tell her how you feel and get your mom back!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|zVVybJFXaa	Of course you're sad because you keep allowing your mother to hurt you. Your mother sounds like she needs professional help. Does she abuse your brothers? If so, you should contact social services to get involved and break the cycle of abuse. <br>  You need to focus on your family (husband and children). There is nothing wrong  with seeking counseling for yourself. If anything, you will learn how to heal yourself. "You can't change people, people can only change you." Distance yourself from being hurt by your mother and seek a licensed therapist to help work on you.
Likst1Mxaa	This happened to me when I had a good friend working with me... I used to get teased by the older ladies about how I had a crush on him (which I didn't and still don't).<br>  <br>  There's only one thing you can do... hold your head up. Don't change what you have been doing - still talk to him the same way you have been. If you say anything or start ignoring him you'll just be confirming the lady's "important" message.<br>  <br>  He must be immature if he believes that you have a crush on him (and got some old woman to tell him haha). She is probably jealous that you two are young and single.<br>  <br>  PS- Bob is right - you can claim harrassment, and sexual harrassment at that. Talk to your union.head manager if it keeps going!|`|RK04Jktraa	File a harassment claim. Tell her first that you are going to if she doesn't stop.|`|QYzzuvdBaa	Make sure she did say something to your boss then scedule an imformal meeting with your boss and the gossip Queen and hash it out between the three of you,perhaps when she is confronted by you and your boss her story will change a bit.And perhaps your boss will tell here that he doesnt approve of work place gossip especally if it effeects the harmony of the work place.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	This lady is a real piece of work huh? You will have people like this throughout your life and unfortunately you have to deal with this person at work. The best thing that you can do is just to remain true to yourself and trust that the truth will come out. This woman has nothing better to do than to harass an innocent person and she is probably jealous of you in some way and that is not your problem, it is hers. If this continues, you need to take it up with human resources and explain the situation that is going on here. I hope this is helpful to you and I hope she gets fired:)!
ZciTIyuCaa	The thing is, it's not really that hard. If you give one more attention than you give the other, the one being left out is likely to get jealous.<br>  <br>  So ask one a question, such as: "What kind of music do you like?" or something like that. Then after she replies, turn to the other and ask, "Well, what about you?"<br>  <br>  They both get equal attention and that's a good thing.<br>  <br>  After you warm up the conversation the girls will find something to talk about. They just want you to START the conversation, they have no problems finishing it.|`|f846739cc7909493f5273e70425c0163aa	Don't worry too much, you will get better with time and practice<br>  just remember what people like, your conversations will be more fun.

Wouldn't you want it to come naturally?|`|1k7LIZVWaa	If you are living together or having sex with him you are "giving him the milk for free".  He will think about marriage when he grows up and is ready for the commitment.  If you are ready and he is not, maybe you should try to find someone to love that wants marriage and a family and things you want.  You can't "make" someone love you or want to spend their life with you.|`|elhcuN19aa	You have to prove your worth to him....<br>  Too many women hope and wish and it never happens because some guys doubt the lady is "worth it"
wXaGIPSPaa	Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweed are Happily Unmarried.Has lived with model/actress Shannon Tweed since 1986, but they've never married. Simmons has said that while he respects the rights of those who choose to marry, it's not something he ever plans to do; specifically, he doesn't feel man by nature is meant to be in a monogamous relationship. "The only thing wrong with marriage is that one of the persons involved is a man," he often says.|`|3wjOk0Saaa	If I had all the pussy they get, and the money they make... DAMN right I would be happy

9ko5WUFkaa	I hope you are a troll.  EDIT: Oh you are - I just looked at your other questions.  Is it your pregnant wife or girlfriend?  Or are you really gay?  the only thing that seems consistant in your trolling is that you may actually be 22 - though your mental age is clearly much lower.<br>  <br>  Cause otherwise you are a prize winning jerk!!!<br>  <br>  You are not a decent guy - not by any definition of the word.  You are only 22 and already on your second marriage.  This is not a good sign as to the type of person you are.  Yes, you did abuse your first wife.  She shouldn't of slapped you but if you are not mature enough to come up with another solution than punching her then you are in the wrong.  Never hit a woman.  <br>  <br>  As to your cheating - and yes, being on a dating site when married is still cheating, or at least leaving your options open - you are disgusting.  If your second wife is pregnant to you I feel really sorry for.  Of course she's going to be moody.  If you are having a child you're meant to be ready for that.  Pregnancy is hard.  I hope she finds out and leaves you.  She would be much better off than to stay with a clearly selfish, uncaring pig like you.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  It's funny how you can spot a troll from thier previous questions.  This was asked just ONE day ago byt he same fool.<br>  <br>  HOW DO I MANAGE HER DRAMA?<br>  my gf kicked me outta her home. shes pregnant with my kid. basically, she thinks i am lazy. i moved in with her a few years ago, while i was in college. i am 22, and shes a nurse and is 26. she makes good money and even gave me her credit card. <br>  <br>  i jus tell her i want to releax. we lead a good life. house, car, anything really. most of it is also paid off even without me working at all. shes just naggin on me, i even slapped her a few times. i am a great guy, havent cheated at all. she makes about 6grand a month.......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And I wasted time on this....I'm not sure which is sadder?|`|61Fwbi79aa	You are just wrong in so many ways.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Abusive and disgusting.

If a woman is man enough to hit a man, she is man enough to get hit by a man. Don't be using that I'm a woman crap to get cheap shots in. If this happened just once I wouldn't say you are abusive. There is mental abuse, you didn't mention anything about how you treat your wife verbally, emotionally or mentally.<br>    You need to get your crap straight. Apparently you didn't learn your lesson from your first marriage about the dating site and cheating. Maybe one of two things will happen. Her and your unborn child will leave you, or you can see how screwed you are and start working on making yourself a better husband and future father. Would you want your son to be like you or have a man like you do the same towards your daughter???|`|frtBRjDdaa	no it does not make you a woman abuser. But i think you should have stay with your ex because even if she was uncaring or even you should have understand her in her condition.and as you say you are a decent guy you should not have punched her.what if your second wife leave you or is a member of a dating site?<br>  you would not accept it saying that she was very kind or like this before.I am not blaming you but as a married man you should have compromise with your wife even if she was to be blamed|`|neUazW6daa	you shouldn't even call your self a man if you laid your hands on any women. You need to think about your mom or sister or if you do have a daughter her when she gets older would you think its o.k. for a man to hit her?  don't you think it was nothing that she slapped you? didn't you think it hurt her more what you did to her than how hard you hit her. Guys like you make me feel like they should never be taken seriously you like to hurt but not get hurt. Regardless of how she disrespected you think about her feelings to because it goes both ways. Yes maybe you found someone that is very good looking but that beauty is not going to last forever. Guys are stupid at first girls are the sweetest thing boys to than again months or years later they change and are the worst husband or wife. They forget the love the keeps them together they cheat thinking they found something better but are they really? She knows you have a wife do you really believe that you can trust her knowing that she was o.k. with that like she can find someone else who's married and pretend that her and him have nothing to do would you rather live with that than with someone you could feel safe and know that through anything she will stick beside you with love. Abuser that is to little of word to describe you should be embarrassed of your self.
KJxwNfsaaa	i dont think its a big problem like she needs help.<br>  & it is common.<br>  us girl we want what we cant have, <br>  and when we get it, we dont really want it anymore.<br>  theres really nothing wrong with it, its just part of our genetics.<br>  but it will pass, good guys will come along and she will want to keep them for a while.|`|a386ef2869afa3e59c3ae1150654e650aa	I like your friend, email me.
Kh5o3QCcaa	Tell his wife- she will definately put a stop to it... or him.  l0l.<br>  <br>  <br>  Or the next time he does it when other neighbors are out yell at him "Quit, I already said I won't sleep with you PERVERT!"<br>  <br>  If you are much younger and he is much older, the effect will be great.  Not only will he stop, but then all of the neighbors will begin glaring at him.... and not in the same manner as he is you.|`|UrNMuhFKaa	This is so easy - first off don't tell someone else to handle it.<br>  The next time you find him looking at you, stop turn straight at him put your hands on your hips and give him the strongest, firmest, coldest stare you can muster up and don't stop starring at him until he turns away in shame. <br>  This will embarrass the heck out of him and i guarantee it will stop him from starring.<br>  Stop being so weak.|`|umGi6gTcaa	How young are you? If your a teen I would yell out "Freakin pedophile always checking me out." Otherwise yell out "wtf are you staring at?!" or just flip him off.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work or you're too shy to do that then you can either tell his wife, write her an anonymous letter or do what I'd do and ask the guy why he's always staring at you and tell him he's creeping you out.|`|vlEeaB4baa	I would just ignore it,  if you weren't looking back, you wouldn't know he was looking.  My first thought was that maybe you should tell the wife, but it might seem kind of silly if you go knock on her door to tell her that her husband is looking at you.  She might be asking why the hell you're looking her husband's way.   I wouldn't worry about it too much.  If he crosses some sort of line, tell his wife... otherwise flip up the middle finger and give the perv something to stare at!!|`|31d0a24439ecffe20e04cb85a1238aecaa	looking and staring are not justification for legal action.  If he does anything else (standing outside your house, etc.) then you can get an injuction to make him keep his distance.|`|SkgJYDaCaa	How old are you? This is really creepy. If you are a minor and he's doing this you need to tell your parents. You never know what this guy could be capable of. He's obviously looking at you in a creepy sexual way, and he doesn't even try to hide it. There is no excuse for what he is doing, you dont want his attraction to you to go any further (like him becoming obsessed and stalkerish) Good luck sweetie, and seriously tell someone who has the authority to take care of this situation like your parents who can then tell his wife.|`|QYzzuvdBaa	You need to tell him to stop and not depend on someone else to do it,but if he has never talked to you or tried to make any attempt to talk or actually do something to you there insnt much that can be done .Aint no law about looking at someone|`|NUOGcCBYaa	Is he much much, older than you? Not that it matters, find out where he lives. Go knock on his door, and R-A-T him out to his wife...........|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Are you a young girl?  Living with parents?  If so, maybe talk with your mom or dad about this situation...|`|AEN68aJgaa	Tell his wife.|`|a8f5edcc140b36ea895725f1c1fa0ff7aa	tell his wife he is creeping you out!!!
7fdeTRhPaa	Sleep with a ho on the side.|`|csUUr11gaa	You should talk to your significant other about it first.  Don't just continue on unsatisfied, and you shouldn't break up with them immediately either.  Communication is important in a relationship.  Simply have a private conversation with your mate and be honest with them.  Good luck :)
zLzwaCpcaa	Don't be afraid to just go up to her and ask her. It seems like you get along well, so there's no reason why she should reject you, and if she says no, well..at least you know how she feels. As far as popularity groups go, I don't think that should matter. Just go with your heart and all should go well.

rIzx4OEWaa	The best thing you can do is write to her an tell her how she is making you feel. Sometimes people we like strike out at those nearest to us because so much is going wrong in there lives an they feel the need to let it all out. But it is not right that you have to take this abuse so tell her so, an say you would still like to remain friends but will not accept this treatment any longer an that if it continues she can look else where for another friend an move on. She is very lucky to have someone like you stand by her after all she has put you through well done for being such a good friend. I hope she comes around an your friendship gets better soon.|`|M8HVkIikaa	HAve a personal talk with her...maybe she is bi-polar or its puberty...or shes annoyed with you|`|r3uKj1Azaa	sounds like hormonal 'issues' to me.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	you just need to speak to her about it. falling out with your best friend is tricky and you don't want to make things worse but talking to each other is always the best way :) you need to discuss things; and maybe it will get solved. tell her exactly how you feel; and she should understand - because you should know how each other thinks :)

3mAgM405aa	Anal sex is quite enjoyable and will take some preprep before engaging in it.<br>  <br>  Begin by:<br>  <br>  1. Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|deg9d50faa	it actually feels great|`|e4DAjaYUaa	Have him be very gentle dont just push it in depending on the size of his penis depends on how bad it hurts.

0DIHY37daa	you should tell your mom how you feel about the new baby thing and let her know that its dangerous for her to have a baby at such an old age, and let her know that you worry about her<br>  its wrong for you and your sister to invade her privacy by looking at her texts, that isn't fair to her<br>  you can't tell your momnot to have sex, she is an adult and she can make her own choices, but if you feel she isnt setting a good example fo you and your sis you can tell her how you feel, but in a respectful way good luck!
ajgC0KPhaa	So you're specifically asking to imagine that the interest is only one-sided.<br>  If she actually spoke her feelings, instead of making a physical move, I would not distance myself from her. But I would also make sure not to get closer with her either, not until my mind is made up. If I didn't like her back, I would have this deep feeling in my gut telling me that I should stay away from her, but eventually that feeling goes away, and then I can talk to her, asking if she is willing to stay friends.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  .|`|mDMnhqwdaa	If he didn't like her back he maybe would because he wouldn't want to give her the wrong impression or signals.|`|HGRBtDIiaa	things would be a little weird at first because i'm not a lesbian so i wouldn't like her back, but i get over things quickly and i'm sure that we could move past it and still be friends|`|pSNex1a1aa	i would try as nicely as possible to tell her that i'm straight and distance yourself abit.

YLajQcFkaa	Its a fact you have to work at it.  Your mind will probabbly sooner or later work it out and WHAM an orgasm happens.  I a guy had to work at having one the normal way for a very long time. Not to get off the subject but I masturbated an unusual way for as long as I could remember and the normal way didn't work.  You need to clear some time and get all comfortable and just work at it every way you can think and in the common ways most women masturbate.  The rest here is a little more information.<br>  <br>  Sure a lot of women have orgasms all the time and come easily.  BUT not all young women have gotten to this point.  A young inexperienced novice at the act of sex woman needs time to adjust to the new sensations a flesh and blood penis creates and her mind needs to get adjusted emotionally.  Yes some women can go there whole life without having one orgasm  <br>  <br>  In college a VERY sexually active girl told me after sex she never had an orgasm and was afraid she would never have one.  She was a very high strung girl so I took her on a skiing vacation and once she was relaxed and happy she has her first and second until she lost count.|`|eYolwN1laa	It really takes practice to reach orgasm..keep trying it will be worth it trust me!<br>  <br>  Tips?

62gMbgb1aa	well what is sure is that you both still like each others and are happy with the situation you are in, cause it gives you a good feeling that you are still together. dont be affraid to ruin the friendship because you know that what is happening now is not just a friendship, each one of you is waiting the other to make the first move. just try to think why you broke up, what were these things that made you break up and if it is not a big deal just wait a little bit and give him some hints so he can make the first step. in the other hand, if what happened previously is unforgettable and is serious problem that keep you from being together, then cut everything now and move on with your life.<br>  N.B: always do what you feel and what you are convinced of, never listen to your friends, even the closest ones do not know how you feel!<br>  good luck|`|iflwrl1Gaa	tell him how you feel<br>  lifes short no joke|`|5XYtvUUgaa	pen down your feeling and mail me at heartylover@gmail.com|`|oubC3TCOaa	I've been there before, just let him go.<br>  It's the best. Trust me.|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	Complex issue with relatively simple answer. You still like him but dont want to date again as it was a disaster last time. Its too hard to be friends this way, especially when you feel pangs of jealousy when you see him with other girls. Also if he is flirting with you and you still like him, you might get talked into a 'friends with benefits relationship'. That will be great for him, however typically not great for girls as they want more and the guys just like regular sex without strings attached.<br>  <br>  Basically don't be friends at least for a while until you are over him. It would help to find somebody else too.
AA12135516	You have no choice you just have to go straight up to him & ask but make sure you're honest because whatever you need the money for he's got a right to know.

I'm sure you know if he treats you well in other ways, money isn't everything so if he is a good boyfriend, than as long as he's going to school it shouldn't matter.

Sounds like the exact situation she was in. He was a really nice guy and treated her great but he didn't have a car, buy much for her, or take her on a ton of dates. He did have a job but he was usually saving his money. She would buy him lots of stuff and didn't expect him to buy a ton  of stuff for her because she did but thought it would have been nice. I'm just saying it is a common thing. At age 20 it's not something to write a guy off over if you feel he's the guy you could marry. The fact that he's taking 15 units shows responsibility and that in the long run he wants a job. That's the whole point of going to college is for a career. He might feel that if he focuses on college right now it will make his career blossom a few years down.  I would maybe have a little talk with him if you don't think it'd be explosive. Don't make him feel bad for not buying you a ton of stuff cuz that's not what a relationship is about. Just let him know that you're juggling a lot in your schedule to have a job and school and that you can't always afford to always buy him things. Maybe just each buy your own stuff unless it's  gifts.|`|lc3VvZKvaa	he can go to school and have a job at the same time, unless his parents are rich.. he should get a job and you shouldn't pay for him, he should be buying you things.

LOL.|`|mMBzpldbaa	there are many different "british" accents. for example, i have a typical edinburgh accent and my partner is from slightly further southwest and has a more typical lowland scots accent. you really have to be more specific. there is more to britain than the posh english.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *rolls eyes*|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I dated a British girl for a couple of years, and she is/was such a perv (in a good way) LOL (I think she learned it from Americans ;-)|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	I dont see how an accent would make a difference really|`|ddP3klT3aa	I hate British accents. But thats just me.
da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Yeah we try to for a few minutes after work but it doesn't last very long.  Neither one of us can sit still for too long so we'll sit there and try to relax after a long day but it never works !!|`|zNjACkxpaa	Yes sadly we find ourselves in front of the tv instead something more "fun"|`|htWw0OlCaa	I really wouldn't know... My husband and I don't talk to each other for some reason....|`|v7Wflu78aa	I wonder if either them would like to bring more life into their relationship?<br>  <br>  I am guessing that one or both of them long for a feeling of connection, but they don't know how to connect - and the TV is the painkiller that stops them from realizing how much they hurt.<br>  <br>  I read articles (NY Times, science magazines) that get me excited.  Then, I talk about the articles, and how they relate to my life, and what I like to think about.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the husband and wife are so scared of each other, that they aren't even willing to venture an opinion.  Or, they are so out of touch with their desires, they have no way of knowing what they want.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Nope, we don't have TV to avoid this very thing.|`|mCM363I9aa	?|`|VXhOLgDEaa	Oh my gosh...if you don't have any children...then you have no idea how lucky you are to have so much free quality time. My husband and I only have ONE child and she's 10 mths old....and we have no time to do anything together or relax. We're lucky if we can sit in front of the tv together and watch a 30 min show. There are a lot of things you could do....watch movies...drink wine...cook gourmet food together...go out on a date...Idk..my husband and I used to do so many things...but 10 mths feels like 10 years ago..I don't even remember...|`|Bv3Dm11paa	Yeah but to exhausted to do anything else. We like to watch our fave shows with a glass of wine. Sometimes we do crafts together, although he likes crafts more than me. But I don't feel the need to talk or do things because we work together all day.|`|AHZ7fgQHaa	It's easy to fall into that. You need to get active and do things sometimes, even if you don't feel like it. Afterward you realize you enjoyed it.|`|7532035b5814c446a2ae6b23cc1f6519aa	I walk my dog or do yoga to destress OR cook if I'm starving. My boyfriend sits down and plays his xbox/playstation until dinner is ready...|`|8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	no we do not own a television.  we never have.   consequently we spend time talking to each other and playing with our children.|`|HZgjUguWaa	yes and???
PEYHoWWQaa	TO GIVE ME TO THIS WORLD  OR DO  SEX|`|NtFC5sn4aa	i feel sorry for you if he yels at you. if you do take nyquil and advil and stuff like that offten then cut back your body does not need that all the time... maybe get closer to your dad, it could help depending on you dads personality  and yours!...STUDY i was doing bad in school now im doing better...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	stop doing them... he is not stupid as you may think he is.|`|mMBzpldbaa	lol, because i had problems in school when i was younger, my brother gets it in the neck. all you can do is prove it to him by trying a bit harder in school. with parents, every little helps. if you're used to getting c's, try working for a b in one test... then try it for the next one etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  by the way, i love your username... my boyfriend's turkish and teaches me cute little phrases like that as well :) we say that every day to each other :)|`|RDgyb7W8aa	you have a bad example to follow,  but couldn't you try to do better in school.  Get closer to your father by asking him to help you with your homework.  I am sure when he sees that you are making an effort to be more responsible, he might stop yelling and allow you more freedom|`|9hYOeeEAaa	try not to do all those things...if you are used to getting C's, aim for a B for the next test...study harder, and aim for high B's and A's and so on...you can do it if you just put more effort into your schoolwork...try not to do all those promiscuous activities...you're only 15 and very very young...|`|1jIzBUkhaa	your dad love you and your sister, he care what is happening around you . he is part of you every day life, maybe being with him more will help stop the yelling. let him in to your life.after all he is your dad|`|D3rw1C8faa	You know the answer.  "I'm nowhere near as bad as my sister was" is an admission of guilt statement. You just admitted you are doing "bad" things but because your sister started out this way and  you haven't yet ended up like her is no reason to continue doing what you are doing. Face the facts and fess up (even if it is to yourself.)  Get off the "medicine."  Every addict starts out this way.  Every addict says to themselves "I won't let this get out of hand.  I am not that kind of person"  or "I would never let myself get as bad as my sister" (or brother, or cousin, or uncle, etc.) Get off the medicine- you don't need your kidney's shutting down or your brain cells to die faster than they do already. Stop being a follower and start being a leader.  Why follow sad or pathetic footprints?  Do you have a younger brother or sister?  If you do, then straighten up.  If you do not, then pretend that you do.  Picture yourself living the kind of life you dream of and your life will start turning around.  You have to keep yourself on the straight and narrow.  Pretend that in a few years you will be running for public office of some sort and that you will be publicly scrutinized. Do not do anything considered "bad" or "corrupt" and no body will be able to say anything bad about you.  Have high standards for yourself and hold them!   Your grades bad?  If you really want to turn things around, make an appointment with your teachers and talk to them.  You will be amazed at the things they can suggest and surprised at the things they can help you do to succeed.  <br>  Stop passing yourself around! You don't have to sleep with guys to get them to like you.  Sleeping with them has nothing to do with whether they like you or not.  Stop having sex and the guys will start thinking "She is different than the other ones.  I like her."  They will respect you a lot more than they do right now.<br>  Love yourself and good luck!!
AA10065812	*** I hate to break it to you, but he is still a child, just as you are.  Do you really think just because you're getting close to 18 that means you're mature?  The only reason males get to be adults at age 18 is because of the draft.  You get it be default without any of the responsibility.  Have you ever thought about fighting for a woman's right to register for the Draft?<br>  <br>  Males are drafted at age 18 because their brains are still undeveloped, and it's the peak time their bodies make efficient use of energy and oxygen.  Males don't reach full maturity until age 30.  Female reach it at age 24.<br>  <br>  Be patient, it won't long before both of you can do anything you want, free of parental influence.  You'll have 60+ years to be together.|`|OiUiEMr0aa	ugh i got the same prob cept im on the other side....my dad is so crazy...he treats me like a child too....he wont even let me have a girlfriend??????WTF im sophmore year but im more mature than guys my age...i still have a gf though shes 17 and it was one of the italian foreign exchange students so now shes all the way across the world. shes coming back in the summer but its soo anoying cause my dad doent even know shes my girlfriend wich has its benefits haha but still...he has to chill i hate him for that.

Yes. =(
86PFQF4raa	I know what you are feeling darling,we miss each other badly and like crazy,I  connect with you,and were so in love.I read your signs with a smile on my face.We want to be in each others arms kissing passionately.I love you so much sweetheart.You are my heart.|`|pOTigVYPaa	I'm great at it!  I always know when something is up with him.  I'm what they call a Sensitive anyways.  I pick up on vibes.  I'm usually 100% on every time.|`|jCMSybAnaa	Not very good.  He's not very reactive.  If he's really mad about something, I'll find out much later when we're in the middle of a great conversation.  How silly.|`|a5b774126a207d8d38e9c6854bb56b66aa	well im kinda good @ it i kno when something is wrong & know when hes happy he's good at knowing mine too he always know what im feelin at da moment|`|iizKx4Bvaa	know my hubby like I know the palm of my hand. Very very well.|`|moOPCMRcaa	i would say i'm very good at this because i can always tell when my husband is upset, even though he's been away for work for about a month. so the fact that i can still pick up on his feelings with our relationship being totally over the phone right now, i think says a lot.|`|aU1ch9Agaa	so so, i used to be able to tell when she was down, due to the fact that she would become overly busy with housework.<br>  <br>  my friend mildred sent me|`|wJZAwxrpaa	I"d say i'm real good that is why i'm not with them anymore and have'nt been for the last two years.|`|dTaGzh6Haa	I'm very good, especially when he has been very bad.|`|1Bs0sNViaa	I know him like a book.|`|Xx9Pr6RAaa	i am good at it|`|qUmZCJ79aa	Great!
86PFQF4raa	I promise sweetheart i wont ever cheat on you.You are the one i love.I love only you darling.|`|KwNpyp3saa	No. Get divorced if you are that uphappy or tempted!|`|7royFhIgaa	NO/Never|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	i don't know|`|74c578a4ee7c0202c5ff65f3549946efaa	It's a possibility.  i'd like to say no, but i'll never know until i'm old and realized i did/didn't.  Most women on here said no, but women cheat as often as guys.  The reason guys didn't answer is because we're more realistic, we know it's always possible.  We're not women, we're not stupid, we know that we might.|`|EioOPbzbaa	No, and it is funny that the only ones answering are women.  Men cheat all the time and wouldn't admit it if caught with their pants down.  If I get that unhappy I would just divorce him - I also believe that karma will take care of the cheater.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	never ever ever never|`|39e9dda5be0b2e2098eda11c3273a895aa	no, I love my husband to much and would never hurt him like that|`|GQUaFGHLaa	No, I have no reason to cheat.|`|AA11812186	Never say never.......|`|jCMSybAnaa	No.  I sure wish I saw some answers from guys (preferably no's).|`|iizKx4Bvaa	Well I am on the fence. I think I already did. Does thoughts and online count? if so he knows and likes it.lol|`|SqDYg0Zdaa	what kind of question is that, i mean are you looking for reason for a quilt-free fling? if you love someone i mean really love them why would you want to go else where or hurt them like that? you people keep forgetting that the other person as feelings just the same as you.....|`|3bf6bf2fa95deff37a266b5813651ca7aa	I should have but never did.It's all good, my butt is saved from Bad karma..I can't wait until it catches up to my ex husband.|`|1Bs0sNViaa	I know it's wrong but it crosses my mind everyday i really don't know.|`|ihS1d5Ftaa	Nope|`|u1uECuFNaa	No.|`|QCfOUgxnaa	Nope.  No way.  Never.
Xb7kaCkiaa	no age really<br>  <br>  i am 13 and i get called hot<br>  >:\|`|AA12135516	Usually when you start developing...puberty!|`|i85Dui0maa	i lost all my baby weight at 16 but it wasn't tell i hit 18-19 that i became really attractive ...now this is not coming from me this is what my friends and family and husband tell me .....i also around this age got a lot of attention from men .......i was always very awkward growing up ...you eventually realize who u are|`|aIF5mGrZaa	It's about appearance not age silly.<br>  If you LOOK hot most likely they will call you hot!|`|z20FPXO8aa	well when you hit maturity and lik looking at your body naked alot then thats when your hottt.<br>  many women hit this stage after menopause!!<br>  so its more of a personal preferance|`|KFT6ZbSbaa	after you go through puberty. like when ur 13-16|`|AXh7WLSJaa	It started at the end of 8th grade for me.
CHF7VtElaa	my mom told me the same thing. the thing is i don't care because i see him in a different way than she does and you should too. we've been together for a year and going strong (: so go for it.|`|12gvcc2Daa	tell your mom to stuff it! doenst matter if she finds him attractive... in fact its probably better off if your mom isnt attracted to your boyfriend. what matters is what you think, and if youd pick quasimodo out of a crowd of good looking studs then that syour business.|`|fHRe4YfEaa	Explain to her that you aren't vain, and tell her that you know he's not the best looking (even if you don't :)) But that you really like him and you don't care :)  Your mom should respect that looks mean so little to you :)<br>  Good luck!|`|CnzIrGp1aa	thats a gud thing so ur bf wont cheat with ur mom|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	thats horrible. dont let your mom decide who you can date. especially based on just his looks
uldindq5aa	well if you know you want to marry her and spend the rest of your life with her what is the difference between now and a couple of years?<br>  if you feel what you say you feel for her then propose because a couple of years really isn't that much of a difference..<br>  good luck, i hope you guys are really happy together..|`|iTVoXWjxaa	Do you have a job to support a kid.  After your married, she will want children.  Are you ready for a big responsibility?  You seem genuine; however, realize women change once they have you lol. Its okay though, my advice is set a date on the marriage, let her know within 6 months, your going to get a present.  She'll wonder what it is, lol.  Good luck.Take some time to think about it my man.|`|44QPXU5eaa	You can always get engaged and not married straight away|`|goY0JHzlaa	Do not get married unless you are certain the time is right. Rushing into things is not always good.|`|HFHNxQ0vaa	propose and have a long engagement!|`|8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	how will your support her?|`|zNjACkxpaa	Getting married because some one else wants to is a bad idea. You are very young.|`|p8yphpjYaa	You say you are ready, but then you say you don't know if you want to yet. Don't do it until YOU are ready to make that commitment!! Obviously she knows how old you are, and if she had a problem waiting for you, she wouldn't be dating you to begin with. If you start out a marriage by doing something huge like this because you think she would get upset if you don't...it makes for a bad beginning. You may think it would be worth it to just suck it up and do it now because she probably wants to now, but later in life, you just might start to resent her for that, and that wouldn't be fair to her! She won't understand why you're feeling resentment, which will make her think all kinds of things. Better to wait until you are both ready to take the next step; it won't work if it's just one of you that's ready. I do think it's obvious that you love her though, if you're thinking of doing something as big as proposing to her, and that you're thinking of her feelings and dreams for her future. She'll wait for you if she wants you in that future. Good luck!|`|pOTigVYPaa	There is something holding you back.  I really think that emotionally you aren't ready.  You may be ready financially, but you really need to be ready mentally, physically, spiritually, financially and emotionally. Don't propose just because she wants you to.  Propose when it's right for you as well.  Otherwise there will be problems latter on.  Perhaps you need to break away for awhile to get some breathing space in the relationship.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	Why do you want to wait?  You mention that you are "only 21," but why does that mean you can't be engaged/married?  If it is not an issue with her, what are you waiting for?|`|ykZIewoCaa	Wait awhile, find a the best ring you can and purpose.  Then wait a year or two till you marry.  No reason to move too fast.|`|iD4ejChZaa	no, you need about 4 more years to get where she is at, in her head.
NB1cbRm0aa	this is very confusing,<br>  <br>  but I say let it go-do not see him. this will only make it worst & take longer for your feelings for him to fade away. Completely avoid him.<br>  <br>  If a few weeks pass by without seeing him and you STILL miss him, maybe then you should do something about it but if he loves his girlfriend very much it's a tough situation....<br>  <br>  If you lose feelings for your boyfriend, don't stick around...makes no sense to...|`|jg9w6IbQaa	i dated this guy about a year ago. we had the same friends so even after we broke up, i saw him ALL the time. i secretly liked him for about six months after we were through. i got over him and started talking to this other guy. this other guy has become one of my best friends. i really like him and i have love for him. but, there are those days that i see my ex and truly miss him. i just shrug it off knowing that it wasn't meant to be.
5HvxRNIyaa	have you talked to her if not , when u see her next time ask her if she can be ur friend or her name. good luck  man lol. i'll probably the girl

XH2o1MM6aa	.It's a sign of maturity that ex lovers can remain friends.As this party is for his ex's 21st's sister.If you were invited to this party.Then you should go.If his invitation was for him and partner,fine.If not don't go as you'd be seen as a gatecrasher.

dIblcI7aaa	Just be nice, go up to him and casually say "Hi." Small talk is an easy way to start a conversation, like introducing yourself and stuff.
bL9APqogaa	I know exactly what you mean. I have thought lots that my parents are way too protective of me to. I am a teenager too and sometimes want to do things that my parents won't allow. Did you know that they are keeping you away from lots of the evil and wickedness of this world? Think of some teens that you know that their parents let them do anything and everything they want, are they into drugs and other bad things? Your parents love you and want the best for you.(maybe they do go a little too far sometimes). <br>  Well, I would say that part of it may have to do with you living in America but don't teens overseas have the same problems? Yes sir. they do. The part that has to do with you living in America is that you see everyone else doing it. <br>  Sometimes one has to just say fine and obey. I have had to do that a lot. We are put into families to obey and honor each other. Your parents are incharge of you. <br>  I hope this has been helpful to me. Talking to a trusted adult (non-family member usually works best) about your problems helps a lot too. IT has helped me so many times. <br>  I wish you God's riches blessings!|`|NMhlBbPIaa	BRIDE OF CHRIST IS RIGHT.  I COULDN'T OF SAID BETTER MYSELF AND I'M A PARENT.

I'M GONNA BE 32 YRS OLD AND IT SEEMS THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO MUCH WORSE.  THERE IS A LOT OF EVIL OUT THERE.  YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES AND BE SMART.  ALWAYS GO WITH YOUR INSTINCT.

ePpCKNT6aa	if you like the girl and you know she's not seeing anyone else just try asking her on a date first, don't ask her to be your girlfriend right away.

WAgeAuvbaa	Eh Lady,<br>  I just answered another of your questions......<br>  Your husband the missionary twice a month guy......<br>  Think you are looking for something else in this friendship.  My advice end the friendship, become friends with your husband again.  You must have had a magic spark at one time, find it together again.<br>  I find it very disheartening that your husband does not care about this.  Please realize that you must work at home before you look away.  Maybe the steak at home takes longer to prepare and sometimes turns out tough or chewy, but the alternative is a fast food burger, yeah its there when you call, quick fix, but rarely satisfying in the long term, then you always worry about the waste of calories.<br>  Try to sort things out with your hubby, talk to him instead of asking all of us.

You should investigate your own problems in marriage to determine why you are seeking a relationship outside of your marriage.  Perhaps you feel it's "safe" cause he's way over there and you are way over here.  But you're only hurting yourself. Nip it in the bud now!|`|EioOPbzbaa	I would ask your husband what he thinks.  If you are interesting in carrying on behind your husbands back, do him and yourself a favor and get a divorce then go at it.  You shouldn't care more about the single man's feelings than how your husband would react.|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	I live in a vacation spot, i've banged lots of women on vacation, but you're guy doesn't like he has that MO.  Sounds like he wants more but doesn't know how to close the deal.|`|6OgJK9E4aa	It's better to end the whole thing because you're allowing temptation to enter into your life.  Why risk your marriage?|`|dTaGzh6Haa	On any level this is not a good thing you are doing. Men are men and women are women. Quit screwing with your own head!|`|DenLZAL1aa	He knows you are married, so now you know he has no ethics, in that he has no regard in possibly breaking up a family, by his continuing to communicate with you. Therefore you can see, it is about him, not you, or your family. You need to trust your instincts.|`|4426582303692fa8410a0ca12979ceb7aa	What do you mean if? You mean 'When'....|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	If you think there is a difference in cultures, American and British, and that some 'British' men can and do have platonic relationships with females, you are 100% absolutely correct.<br>  <br>  Given his age and upbringing, he would know how to properly treat a lady with dignity and respect.|`|EzZk2pyNaa	Single man might better watch out, because he might get his butt kicked by married woman's husband.|`|qUmZCJ79aa	If your married you shouldn't be keeping him as a friend.  Does your husband know about your friend!|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	Why not try being blunt?  Tell him you like him as a friend, but you would feel more comfortable if you were sure he was not after more than that, as you would not cheat.  You could also mention that you are only unsure because of the difference in the way English and American men act (as you mentioned here) so that he knows he did not do anything inappropriate.  I am sure that if he is just after being friends he would not mind having that boundary established.<br>  <br>  I doubt that he would try to start a long distance infidelity, that would take someone with a whole lot of issues, there is no shortage of women here :-)
v811KD7raa	i wouldnt call at all cos i know how much parents having affairs wrecks kids heads|`|OOwUlO4Jaa	I would call more times, and I am seeing a married woman.|`|bZCSRu8Iaa	It depends on her family situation.. first try to know about her family then u will get an idea about|`|Qe95LNxYaa	respect the woman that she is married and i would just text or call her couple times in a month a i am a guy 100% polish and gentleman
Molu004zaa	Wtf? Why do you WANT to be a doormat and let him control you? Better yet, why do you think that women are 'lesser' than men? :/ Stupid girls like you shouldn't be allowed to breed. Women have been fighting for womens rights for DECADES and you go and say THAT? :/ Idiot.
qZ0310yVaa	take your time you are a sweetie|`|54qBK15laa	I look for girls who love to hang out all the time.  They have to have a sense of humor and they have to be nice/sweet.  They have to want a relationship forever and they have to not cheat on me.
azIJoIdIaa	those are all little subtle signs if he likes you ;)|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Hey girls for that whole staring charade you always claim, don't look into it too much, I know when I find myself bored out of my mind in class my eyes tend to wander and I just stare at random people out of boredom. As for the texting thing, how much does he text you? Does he initiate it? The thing about saying he loves you, you should just forget about that lots of people I know say that to everyone.As for the doesn't like when your mad at him and ignoring him, I think people typically don't like it when people are mad at them or ignore them. And for making you laugh maybe he likes being Mr. Funny Guy and wants to make everyone laugh.
3df62cd5d4c4550eefa351b54399e098aa	Leave it alone.  That is a very touchy subject for anyone, especially a guy.  As long as you two are happy together and there are no problems why should it matter what other people say - true or not.  Maybe one day he will open up and talk about with you if he has been.   Until then just enjoy your time together.
nBKSMnTSaa	I think he likes you back. If he didn't like you and he knew that you liked him, then he wouldn't <br>  1) let you hug him. <br>  2) hold your hand<br>  3) LET your hands touch <br>  4) dance with you<br>  <br>  By stating that you and your ex-bf's dance looked HOT, I'm pretty sure it was him being jealous in guy language. ;) <br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|RQYL0Aicaa	stop messing with your ex in any way besides talking.<br>  your crush might back off thinking you still like him.<br>  and, it seems as he does like you, body language is very strong. it seems like he was doing a lot of caressing with you shoulder and holding your hand. <br>  i say stop with the ex, and hang out more with the crush.<br>  he likes you|`|GAnCdatkaa	Prom night and puppy love!!!<br>  Go for it girl!!!|`|xDOkuxOXaa	YES KISS HIM IF U WANT?|`|j9D1wL0baa	yeah, lol its all right there. from what i read his totally into you.|`|TOPTB10Baa	Forget to ask your question at first? xD<br>  Yeah, he probably does.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	;-) yeah, I think so.|`|b08f23f64cf67ed7e34f8ed0781dfd16aa	No doubt that you both have mutual feelings about eachother. That is the sweetest thing I've ever heard. You know.. my best friend, guy friend.. well he asked the girl he likes.. well her best friend out only because he wanted to know about the girl he liked.<br>  <br>  So he probably just asked ur best friend our to know more about you or to get closer to you. I think it's working. :)<br>  <br>  G'luck!!!!|`|5jQVj4Pfaa	If he told you that you should have asked him to the dance earlier, then yes, he probably likes you. Guys don't usually hold hands with girls or put up with so much cuddling unless they're really good friends with them or they like them in some form of crush way.|`|pxuDr2T4aa	Yes yes yes yes yes. so start sending signals but be subtle bout it make sure they r a lil murky at first and as the relationship progress make it clearer|`|UxbjvAaRaa	Sounds like it to me/|`|VgiUGqxtaa	Ermmm.....<br>  <br>  Yes
w4l8NajJaa	hmm if i had to estimate i think it'd be like 1000 lol|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	17000?<br>  Really?<br>  I dont reach 200|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	That's a lot of texts.|`|JcV2nn4jaa	R U CRAZY...of course that is toooo much...by the way, i hope you have unlimited txt|`|lBe3zws1aa	WHOA?<br>  thats a bit to much<br>  i send like .. 450!|`|bo13uXxnaa	If you have unlimited go you! If you don't, sorry.<br>  Oh last month: 2174|`|tmfJFtILaa	Wow thats a lot. I would say I send about 6000 texts a month.
4IHe4rPYaa	ur first true love will be sometime around ur late high school years. all you can think about is that person and you always want to be with them. its fun while it lasts but it rarely lasts for more than 6 months unless theyre the one.|`|PogMq7Pcaa	bestest thing ever :P im in 7 grade and im in love with an 8 grader<br>  <br>  my only problem is we have no proof he loves me back :'( evn tho sum of my friends say he likes me idk|`|BPGz4Sa6aa	its really...reallly sweet and magical....but you;ve got a LONG way to go,|`|WoAAdxHEaa	not for awhile for you. i would say maybe sophomore year you could start to understand what real love is like.<br>  <br>  It's amazing. It's the best feeling ever. And it' not obsession like some people think. Its wanting the absolute best for the other person even if that means them being with someone other than you.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	its a nice feeling because the guy you are with will make you feel special and beautiful...when making out you will feel butterflies in your stomach... you cant stop thinking about them the world and everything seems so perfect, and your always happy, and your eyes change...but you know what i hope you dont fall for the jerk ones because they will treat you like s***(speaking from experience).But you know what sucks about love that sometimes that person you loved so muuuch will break your heart.... it sucks (sorry if im being really pessimitic but i just got my heart broken recently and i feel bad...  :(|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	just hold on..there is tome for everything..but dont mistaken love with attraction..they are to different things...<br>  love doesnt care if the guy is ugly or not attraction does dats just a small tip|`|ykZIewoCaa	Long after high school.  In high school, you don't feel love, you feel lust.  Some day you'll understand more.|`|YDUmNLFVaa	It is totally amazing(: you are just on this love high, and you'd do anything for that person to make them happy, even if it means giving something up for them. You'll fall in love, and you'll know when you are. It's just like wow I love him/her. And you'd just really do anything for them, and be there for them, and cry with them, and smile with them, and make them laugh, and have fun, and just love them!|`|z3QsWmzpaa	it will happen to you when you meet the right person and you know its love because well . . . you will just know i dont know how to explain it its just the feeling you get when your around them or when someone says there name its just wonderful<br>  good luck on finding mr. right =]|`|IcUsSPeUaa	Love, when reciprocated, I'd don't doubt is the greatest feeling in the world. Love, when not reciprocated however, I think is the biggest living hell possible to be put through. I personally, have never experienced anything more painful.|`|yayDgY0qaa	Yes it will. I fell in love last year in 4th grade. it is great!!! I liked this boy who was cute but now not really and he asked me out at the end of the school and dated for 2 weeks.|`|REoNMbanaa	In a way, he's right. But, still. You usually know that you love someone when it seems like everything about them is amazing or perfect. Like, you think that their flaws are cute instead of annoying.<br>  -Em|`|5n13XFuhaa	ot   can be amazing but also painful <br>  you can get hurt so easy when you have fallen for someone <br>  so make sure its the right person<br>  it happens naturaly btw|`|JcV2nn4jaa	Its suck kid, believe me.  I have been in love and its just plain suck, SUCK, SUCK...don't ever do it|`|KFT6ZbSbaa	it is the greatest thing ever.|`|YBU8nL9uaa	Your heart explodes from the butterflies flying in your heart! Your stomach always feels full when you are with him, and you can't eat or drink anything (you cant do anything but to look at him and admire him). He looks like the perfectiest guy ever, and everything he does (even something bad) looks WONDERFUL. It's just plain wonderful, and when you get your first love, you WILL know it right away!!! There's no way of you not noticing how it feels like. YOu have to have at least one true love in your life, and DUH, because almost everyone gets married and even unmarried WERE gone through a true love, but that true love dumped her. Oh, you would also want to kiss him everyday and everything! It is wonderful!|`|45cb8df5c4e4ff5a3eee13ff752766d6aa	its great unless the person doesnt love you back but in most cases they do and when you and another person are in love your relationship would last long.and you would be happy with that person and that person would be happy with you.it will happen to you your probably a nice person im not sure i havent met you.but it will happen you will see im a 9th grader i have fallen in love twice but have not found right person yet|`|AI2VoFP4aa	when will it happen or when will you think it happened? well youll think youre in love about ten times before you actually are. you cant truly be in love until you know what you want in a guy and in the seventh grade this shouldnt be something you even think about. just worry about being a kid, it goes by so fast dont be in a hurry to grow up once you do you miss the years when you werent stressing over dating bills and work. and once you do think youre in love which will probably be in high school dont have sex just because you think youre in love chances are you arent its just hormones and one day youll regret not waiting for real love the kind you wont find until youre mature and so is he.|`|Vr6L81iiaa	Love is such a simple yet complicated word. No one knows for sure when they will fall in love, and often times you'll think that you're in love when you are really not. In life, you could fall in love with a million guys before you find the one. <br>  Falling in love can be ridiculous. Ever heard of the saying "love is blind"? It is true, love is blind. But when falling in love, it is the best feeling in the world, as if your whole life revolves around this one special person that you could never imagine living without, but you love it.|`|rT3MfFvuaa	At your age it is the most intense feeling you will ever experience.  A seventh grader means absolutely nothing to me because I am not from the USA but I gather you are under the age of 17.  This feeling will consume and colour your entire life for however long it lasts.  Revel in it and enjoy it because you are unlikely to feel like this again quite so strongly.  Your first love will always stay in the shadows of your memory even after you are happily married!|`|kzIVGEfgaa	Love... Wow... It's a strong word that's said way too often. <br>  <br>  Don't go out looking for it, it will find you. <br>  When you're in love, and I'm not talking about puppy love, you truly feel it. Love is when the whole world shines when you think about them and the whole world is gloom when they aren't around. It's a really deep feeling that only you will know when it's there. <br>  <br>  There is no time frame for it. It happens when it happens just do me a favor, don't spit it out whenever you feel like. Don't get a boyfriend and claim you love them after a couple weeks.|`|nPlDZGHzaa	its when you think about them all the time when your with out them, and have dreams about them, and then constantly say the wrong thing and embarass yourself when your with them.<br>  <br>   Oh yeah, and if when you go in for the kiss for the first time, and are so nervous you totally miss, then their the one|`|hHes4d7uaa	Honestly, I don't know. I think you want to spend time with the person more and more, you want to know about them, you want to treat them well. They're the first person you want to tell when you hear good news or bad news or a funny story. Your curious about them. You want to do things for them. You get butterflies in your stomach when you see them. Mostly, I think you want to be there for them, and make them happy.|`|z4uljKi1aa	Don't rush into it. I haven't been in love either. But I, too, am only in the seventh grade. I hear it feels like the best thing in the world. They say that love is the happiest word in the dictionary.|`|3ExfmAa4aa	It will soon happen to you if you know how to handdle it =]<br>  Love is love... it feel great trust me..|`|wJl9a1Tqaa	it is like you find someone that you love mor than enyone you have ever loved|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	it the best ever
HUSq3VbPaa	Well, if the first girl likes you back then you might wanna try dating her. But relationships where you never see the person doesnt ever relly work. So if you like her friend, then id say go out with her.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Ask the one you never see out lol, stoopid :P|`|szcA8CDyaa	Ask her out would be 50% chances you got. She might say yes because she likes you and she might say no because you like somebody else and if you broke up, she will think that you'll go out with her friend.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	It's not like you're offering to commit to marriage.  You're young and need to enjoy your youth.  Just do what feels right and have a good time.  You're generally in a no win situation, but you'll all get over it after a couple of months.|`|tRsobsD3aa	It doesn't matter who you text a lot. It matters who you have stronger feelings for. If you go out with one friend just know that you wont be able to go out with the other. So choose wisely, and follow your heart.|`|ieDarpkVaa	Doooooo it! Nothing can go wrong and even if it does she'll only hate you and you will look like an idiot for the rest of your life, but sure, DO IT! Nothing bad can happen to u!|`|PbESq4Cyaa	The one who cooks better|`|2DbnttgXaa	i would go with the one you see more often. Don't feel bad, be honest with her, if you like her more, then tell her that, also explain to the other girl that you don't like her as much and need to stop texting her because you don't want to upset anyone by texting your girlfriends best friend.<br>  the best advice i was ever told:<br>  be honest, tell people exactly how you feel.<br>  <br>  good luck (:|`|TOPTB10Baa	Well really, you should do what you want and be with who you like more..<br>  But to be honest, I'd hate to be the girl you really like and find out you're going out with my friend. No one likes when that happens.<br>  Ask her friend out if you like her more.<br>  But if you don't, then don't to that to the other girl.|`|zb70sXfPaa	i think that the girl u dont see is a keeper usually i like not seeing a boy that much cuz then the relationship will move faster and will go for a while if its strong! but the other girl may not work since it may be akward for her to be with u cuz ur one of her best friends i take it?!!? but ya thats just my opinion<br>  <br>                     GOOD LUCK|`|a8faa51f64a988b0e4081e561a610820aa	Take a chance and see what happens. If you get rejected, it may hurt at first and feel a little awkward. But you will survive and grow from it and feel glad that you had the courage and bravery to take the chance! Good luck!|`|rb1LY5SLaa	you should just go with what your heart says. If she gets mad, explain to her that you can't help how you feel and that you can't help that you like her more than her friend.|`|AOVlNkbTaa	Don't ask either of them out until you know which you like the most. Get to know them both better.|`|vDAfx6kOaa	chances are if she is a good friend she would stick to girl code and stay away from you<br>  if not she is a skeeze and why would you want that?|`|CGYDhXRNaa	go with the one you see physically.. online or mobile relationships usually epically fail|`|3UvIC3xAaa	when u ask her out you will stop worrying.<br>  if she says no she says no.<br>  if she says yes, be happy.<br>  knowing is better than not knowing|`|rQ80uhdHaa	go for the friend, like you said, you see her more often than the other one

Also make it clear to family and friends that you don't want people popping up at your house and that they need to call first. We have made it perfectly clear, that no one is to just  up without calling first.  I live in NYC so I know what it is liked to be piled on top of people but it doesn't bother me that much. Just be glad that somebody is thinking about you.|`|AA11103763	Look at it this way, you have the best (free) security system in the world!  My neighbors are the same way, but we all look out for each other. Think of it at it as a blessing, (yes, an annoying one), but there are a lot of people who care enough about you to want to know where you are and if you are OK.

Your not comfortable with yourself and therefore you can't possibly feel comfortable around other people. You need to realize that your just as important as everyone else. What you have to say and your input is as worthy as your classmates. If you are a religious person, no matter what religion, you can find a basis in that religion for self worth and how to resource it. The important thing is you begin to develop your own inner peace and confidence. By posting here alone you've demonstrated that you can express yourself anonymously. Continue to work on it and it will be easily overcome. Good Luck.|`|ohqH8z0daa	haha...story of my life. That was extremely similar to my situation right before starting high school, and now I'm pretty happy with where I am. Confidence is important. At high school, try to get to know people.... Introduce yourself, because you're starting with a new slate and people won't have a predetermined idea of who you are. Once you end up with your circle of close friends, they'll be the people who matter most to you, and trust me, you won't care nearly as much about your social status as before. Good luck and have fun!|`|5R0omMVnaa	Be more confident. Why are you so nervous? You only live life once so just relax more and enjoy the ride. People generally look fo someone who is-<br>  <br>  -Chilled<br>  -Funny<br>  -Decent looking<br>  -Nice<br>  <br>  Everyone is at least one of these so just calm down.|`|48W167cBaa	You're in the exact same situation I was in. I had one best friend- I was in eighth grade. I was a little dorky, but I had my handful of friends. Everything I said ended up being stupid-sounding, and I got weird looks. I thought I was pretty decent looking also.<br>  <br>  First, be confident in yourself! I know you've heard it forty thousand times, but the forty thousand times you've heard it haven't gotten to you yet. Until you feel like what you're saying should be heard, you're not going to feel good about yourself. <br>  <br>  Once I got into high school (i'm a freshman), I started fresh. I was outgoing, and involved myself in group conversations. I started those awkward conversations with people I didn't know, and now I have the closest group of friends I've ever had. Was it hard to talk to those people that first day? Of course it was. I had to break out of my comfort zone, and break those boundaries I had made the year before.<br>  <br>  You'll finish the rest of the year- you can do it. The most important thing is to be yourself. That was one of the biggest mistakes I made last year- trying to be someone else so other people would like me. Really, I didn't like them- why was I trying to get them to talk to me? Honestly, I was desperate for friends.<br>  <br>  Really, you want quality over quantity. Be yourself, and you'll make friends who really like you, for you. Stay strong, and keep trying. You'll do great next year. You really will :)|`|CoNRevnraa	Just try and be more confident! <br>  Sometimes you just have to make yourself go out there and talk to people! <br>  I kno being shy is a problem for a lot of people, including me, but if people see that you are self-confident and talkative, you're more likely to meet new friends! :]|`|4dZl8Yiiaa	maybe you are just shy!<br>  be have 2 or more  friend.<br>  it's just a symbol that your not shy.
OeRzlZPnaa	Honestly this is a question that no one can answer for you. It's got to come from you and no one else. Just look at your options and if it helps write out the benifits of going and not going and what would happen if you couldn't go and what would happen if you could go. Use that as a guide to help you. If you do decide to stay in NY do remember if you keep a long distance relationship you can always move with him later, but this might not be what you want to do.
AA10065812	*** About ten years too early, not including the fact that there may be statutory rape issues.  Never enter into a relationship, especially physical, until age 24, otherwise you have an 85% chance of the relationship failing.  <br>  <br>  Age 24 is when you reach full maturity.  It has only been two years since you BEGAN developing conceptual thought process, which includes the ability to understand love.  Right now you are feeling a desire and a wanting, but it isn't love.  The hormone driving the urge is the exact same hormone that drove your desire to have that newest toy not that many years ago.  You will not have the full ability to logically balance that urge with logic until you reach 24.  This applies to all females.  Males don't reach this until age 30.<br>  <br>  Be patient, you have plenty of time.  Keep you panties on and your head on straight.  Finish school, go to college and make something of yourself.  Than, you will be ready for a commitment.  If she can't wait, she not ready for a commitment.<br>  <br>  Here's a book to read.<br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess up Their Lives <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Women-Do-to-Mess-up-Their-Lives/Dr-Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060976491/?itm=3" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a>|`|O36qjj7Oaa	14 is way way way to young to be engaged to either gender.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	NO - If she really loves you then she will wait till you are 18 before she continues any relationship.<br>  <br>  You cannot get "engaged" at 14.  And besides, I'm willing to bet you will feel totally different about things in the next 4 yrs.  You haven't even decided on a job, being on your own, taking care of expenses and a lot of other things.  Probably all you are thinking of is "playing house" with her. And don't even bring sex into the picture either!|`|o6xLWwZvaa	That's great if you know you will be with that same person for the rest of your life. However, why get engaged? Couples don't have to be engaged to express their love for each other. Although you have said you don't plan on getting married until 19 or 20. So why not wait until you are at least 18 to be engaged. <br>  <br>  I think, thinking about marriage at the age of 14 is too young.<br>  <br>  EDIT: some people are saying your girlfriend is too old for you. I disagree. If I am doing the math right she is only what 4 maybe 5yrs older then you? She's really not that much older. My husband is 5 -6yrs older then me, depending on the time of year.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	It's a little young,Maybe a promise ring would be more appropriate at this time.People change every seven years so they say.If you are still interested in each other when you reach 18 or 19 then get engaged.By then you will definitely know you want to be together for the rest of your lives.Hope this advice helps .|`|DenLZAL1aa	14 is too Young, and your girlfriend is subject to laws when she is over 18, aiding to the delinquency of a minor and sexual abuse of a child. You are in a dangerous relationship, because she is too old for you.|`|AA11635601	When I was your age, same sex dating was considered a form of self-mutilation, not unlike suicide, aimed as a hostile attempt to hurt and antagonize parents we felt had failed us.  Same thing with early marriage, sex with either gender, running away, drug use, and so on.  <br>  <br>  Good thing we're so much more enlightened nowadays.  Now we even know to call it "gay", which means happy and carefree.  And to think we once thought of it as a sign of desperate misery and crying out and acting out in helpless rage and futility.<br>  <br>  Mmmm mmm.|`|p8yphpjYaa	You can't understand because you haven't been there yet, but BELIEVE me, you change so much between the ages of 18 and 23! Take your time, enjoy your life, and do what feels right to you, but understand that it is possible that the person you love right now may not be a good fit for you by the time you're 25. You still have a lot of growing up to do, let it happen! I'm not saying it's not possible to be happy at 25 with the same person who made you happy at 14; it does happen to some people, but not as often as those who wait a little longer to get so serious.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Girl you are too young. It's not even about your age, it's just the fact that you are growing and changing every single day. What you want now is not what you want in a few years or even months from now. Come out to your family, but I would leave out the engaged part. They are going to think it's stupid and won't support it at all. Just work on telling your family that you're homosexual and only announce an engagement when you are out of high school with a proper ring|`|3iljgiZRaa	It is way too young - people are going to laugh at you and think that you are down right retarded!<br>  <br>  I am not saying that you don't know what love is - I loved for the first time at 14 years old... I KNOW it can be REAL... but I also know the odds of it lasting forever are slim to none. For your sake, I hope it's the real deal, but just beware that people are not going to respond very well to the engagement of a 14 year old.|`|AA11198190	At 14 you have not even started living............<br>  life is all about exploring who you are.<br>  You are far to young to even contemplate a relationship....of any kind.<br>  Concentrate on school,find out who you are and what you want to do in life............|`|AA10988719	14 is too early to get engaged no matter if it is a boy a girl or a monkey.  neither of you are experienced enough or mature enough to make that kind of decision or commitment.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	YES,you are too young to even think about being or getting engage. finish school enjoy life as a growing teenage and think about marriage way down the road,|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	your way to young to be engaged! your 14 and dont know what love is!|`|AA11605508	I'm an ancient old fart at thirty-seven, and I do think that in this day and age, fourteen is way too young to consider an engagement or any long term commitment ceremony.  <br>  <br>  You have at least another fifty years ahead of you with this girl, should you want to have some sort of commitment ceremony - gay marriage is not legal in the majority of the states in the U.S. (I assume you are American, due to your mentioning high school). Why rush to get engaged? <br>  <br>  Also,  I have friends who have been together for twenty years and never married - you don't have to have some engagement ceremony to show someone you love them and want to be with them.|`|GrCj35muaa	being engaged when you are 14 doesn't really matter, that is more of a personal thing between you and the one you are with because you can't legally get married until you are 18. i would recommend keeping the engagement to yourself until you are old enough to legally get married, especially since your partner is about 16, maybe 17 years old, she will be frowned upon. You can go ahead and promise yourselves to each other but no one will take you seriously until you are of age to take action.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Why are you hanging out with such an older girl? SHe's too old for you. Same sex has nothing to do with it. It's the age difference that bothers me.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	yes it is a bit too young to be engaged.

I count from 50 to 1 and then again if it is not enough.  When I feel I am calm, I declare that this is level 1.  (it is the Silva Method).  Then I go to my inner sanctuary.  (that I took from a book by Shakti Gawain).  The inner sanctuary is a dwelling that I have built in my imagination.  And it is according to my own needs and to my liking.  I can encounter friends, or be alone.  The possibilities are endless.  There also, I meet gurus who answer my questions.  They do have good points about my situation.  They reveal to me items I had neglected.  All this is in my imagination.  It is my own conscience reviewing things but it is nice to see people (I live alone mostly).  At a certain moment, I never know when exactly, I fall asleep, peacefully.  I like to go to my inner sanctuary.<br>  <br>  But when I have a headache, I count from 50 to 1 and then I repeat to myself that it is passing, it is going away.  It never goes away until I take a medication.  But it calms me down and it makes me wait a little before taking the medication.  Sometimes, it has passed.  Rarely but I keep hoping it will happen again.|`|BILIAKSOaa	You can just sit and have a movie day with your friends. You do make overs and spa treatments. You could also go to a salon. If it's to much money then you could try those at home spa treatment things. (: Yoga sounds good too. I've never tried it, but I'm so stressed with school it sounds like it would help.

j9D1wL0baa	this is really hard to get past, there really isn't a way to get past it, you just go on living, i know it has happen to me, but i think it as made me a better person in way, see what i did is locked myself in my house for 3 weeks then my friends finally got me through it, 1st i started talking to people then i started making more friends, and it help me become more outgoing and then i realized that he wasn't really that good for me, i mean i still love him with all my heart, even though his hurt me so much. its really hard to get pasted it, just talk with friends have some me time then make new friends, start dating, and finally you'll meet some else, that will be better, it just takes time, and also its different for everyone, some people cant get past it because they have no one for them, so talk to someone.<br>  <br>  i really hope i helped and hope you can <br>  get though it, i know how hard it is.<br>  if you don't have any friends that are really<br>  that close.

Losing your love, hope, and trust is only possible if you replace it with bitterness, distrust and resentment...not so much in the person that let you down--but in the concept of love itself. <br>  <br>  If you do not attach the disappointment you experienced with this man to relationships in general-- then you will never lose your hope, trust or love.<br>  <br>  Sometimes we invest ourselves so much into someone and they let us down. But if you allow your disappointments to take root and apply them to future relationships you will always be on guard, suspicious and overly cautious.<br>  <br>  Change your way of thinking on this one. Your disappointment is in this one individual--not in relationships themselves. Do not ever take any failed relationship as rejection. Accept them for what they are and you will always keep your self-esteem in tact.|`|pBG646HVaa	Move on. He's not worth it.

"Parents Don't Pick Favorites" My ***.|`|6PbyKpHzaa	My mother does the same thing with me and my brother. It drives me insane. All that I do is push and push until I get what I want. But, don't push to hard to wear you make her upset.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Anne if a boy likes you,he'll find lots of excuses to be around you.Laughing,pushing and even being a nuisance. Anything to make you notice him.If your interested just do the same to him.
0NwZPBgQaa	give her some space..maybe she was just having a bad day. apologize and tell her that you didnt mean to get her mad.|`|ZDnLfB5daa	When you make a girl mad there is not much you can do. Trust me i have had a lot of guys make me mad, but anyway all you can do is tell her how sorry you are and that you will never do it again. Then if all else fails give her time, let her be mad at you but she will come back to you. Just remember time heals all wounds.|`|BEoHK8V2aa	AWW, you know what you should do- you should build a really huge card tower and give it too her, with your apology, that would be cute. Anyways good luck, and she won't stay mad for long- she was just overreacting.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	Well, first you should admit that what you did was childish, send her a card and a small teddy bear and tell her that you were only teasing and that you didn't mean to upset her. A sincere apology should do wonders.|`|6zDYJRjmaa	are you in 4th? im just kidding. give her alittle bit of time, and give her a sincere apology. If shes worth it, shell realize shes being immature and overreacted. If not, watch the village. its the best movie ever|`|wdC8o0Doaa	Make her a cute little card or something to show you took the time to apoligize and let her cool down and say sorry to her face. She will forgive|`|ReCy0Omxaa	Wow...tell her ur sorry...What grade r u in?|`|e8SPmZULaa	hm ok well backround info in girls for you- they LOVE dramatics.<br>   and yeh if she still chucks a massive spaz at yo about it just leave the fight go for a few days and still say hi to her and things if you see her even if she doesnt say it back because normally it makes it hard to be angry.<br>  <br>  but i dont know... u say she wont forgive you and i rekkon thats slack, stupid and childish.. it was a card tower for gods sake..<br>  <br>  i rekkon tho.... you should somehow make like a massive tower of cards for her and glue them together and give it to her :D that would be cute hahah and yeh dont forget to add in and tell her u know u've said it a thousand times but your really sorry and tell her how much of a friend she really is to you and dont want her angry.<br>  <br>  x|`|lHc6lgF0aa	She probably got so mad because she worked hard on it, (it IS hard to make the cards stand up right to make a tower), and you destroyed the point of her efforts. <br>  Also, it COULD be her "Time of the Month" (I tend to become a psycho b!tch and be really irrational when it's mine)|`|afoSVEKQaa	wow! ya know.. she's probably PMSing. orrr she was actually really upset. I say you buy her a deck of cards.. with a little note saying :<br>  <br>  "I'm truly sorry for wrecking your card house"<br>  <br>  she'll probably think that's really sweet. i'd forgive ya!|`|PKtqcw5yaa	if i was you then i would send her {or put in her locker or maybe if u want in person} a deck of cards and write something really cute on the wrapping and say your sorry when you give it to her.|`|vu8JNSI0aa	If shes really one of your closest friends it will work out soon. You should probably start by saying sorry|`|BtR8zpySaa	you should buy her a chocolate & say ur really sorry :)|`|8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	why would you ruin something another person is working on?

Leave her alone.|`|Hx47O8llaa	Yea she kinda did go over board..<br>  <br>  I would just be like:<br>  Listen I'm REALLY sorry..I will help you build it again<br>  <br>  I dont know...thts what i would do|`|707gOCvbaa	You destroyed something she was looking to take some pride in doing. Buy her a card and write in  it how sorry you were and you never meant to jeopardize your friendship by doing something so foolish. good luck.|`|CyiTtpbOaa	haha, i agree with christina<br>  <br>  but you really made me want to build a card tower|`|Plq0BGSgaa	what you did was immature<br>  <br>  <br>  apologize<br>  <br>  <br>  stop being a jerk off|`|2qpzoNGpaa	u jerk
GF1PEO2Xaa	Erm, tell him that you're parents are taking you somewhere, and then you don't go to the dance.|`|8ee4GOb9aa	Say: I'm really sorry,im not trying to hurt you but i dont think im going to the dance anymore|`|9XjtEdEqaa	tell him as soon as possible and just say you dont feel like going and its not because of him.

WK8MZlLdaa	Talk to her. If you are shy it might be difficult but just go and say hi. ask about her, what she does etc. if you feel you connect well anything that follows will be natural. <br>  <br>  If u want to ask her to lunch then ask her. shes completely blank at the moment. u know nothing about her. so just go for it.
nU84u2poaa	im 15 too! how about we experiment ;), i live in virginia :]
8QO17Xw1aa	boys are reallllly bad at hiding it when they like you. if he acts as if he likes you, then he probably does. also guys think they are being really subtle when theyre not.<br>  <br>  here are some signs:<br>  he stares and then looks away really fast<br>  he tries to touch you in any way possible (shoulders, hands, etc)<br>  teases you, makes fun of you (in a joking way)<br>  compliments you<br>  lock eyes with you when he walks into the room<br>  his friends look at you when they are talking<br>  he stutters when he talks to you<br>  **obvious one: he looks down every once in a while when you are talking, almost as if he is embarrassed<br>  he goes out of his way to do nice things for you<br>  he texts/calls/facebook chats you out of the blue and may even use an excuse, like asking what the homework was<br>  <br>  if youve noticed like three or four of these things then he defintely likes you. <br>  <br>  if you dont like talking to him on the phone, just talk to him in person!!! its much better anyway. if you guys end up going out, talking on the phone will get easier<br>  <br>  good luck! peace<3|`|TAMGy07Daa	OK, look. I am 15 years old. and if you stare alot. its a sign. just ask him out.
hI4m3Pnqaa	Don't kill yourself. Whatever you do. Do not kill yourself. You can go to a school counselor, or you can see if you can stay at a friend or relatives house. and if you really want a new family you can get CYF (Children youth and family services) involved.  I am going through a thing were i also want to kill myself bcuz i have a cousin who has been beaten me for a couple months now and has just bit the crap out my little sis. So i know how you feel. Just please i am begging you please don't kill yourself. Anyway you will be out of that house in just a few years. If  your parents dont pick you up from school stop at a store and get you something to eat or call the police and they will make your parents let you eat. If anthing like this ever happens again call the police. You are suffering soemthing called Child Neglect and your parents can go to jail or you can be put into foster care. CAll the police and talk to a school couselor they will help you. Please i am begging bcuz no child should have to suffer from this.|`|F47MyGDSaa	If there's any type of abuse or neglect (that includes not feeding you), you need to tell someone. And him beating your mom is NOT right. And if it happens often, you also need to tell someone. Can you try to live with another family member, or maybe you can get yourself into a foster family, or some safe shelter. Contact your Local Youth Services, and they should have some information for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Nice name :]|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	you can call social services and ask them to put you into foster care.|`|IvIatEg3aa	Um well if he actually doesn't give you food for three days, then well he could probably get in trouble. Legal trouble, I mean. Anyways, I suggest talking to a school counselor who can probably direct you to some teens with dysfunctional families agency or something. Hope everything works out for you!|`|90faa4cd94ef7f4fc6117ba415c52a62aa	dear , there are alwayz 2 solutions 2 a problem , either u find a solution 2 it or ignoire it completely n change ur path completely .<br>  wats ur pick ?|`|36aPSk4oaa	Get professional help - like a counselor at school, or if things get bad, the police.
f0XuYQsbaa	i think he has an interest in you without a doubt. just make it happen. get that confidence going and get talking. trust me im sure youre amazing just get him hooked :)|`|uU28jSyeaa	ok now it seems to me that he really likes you but, he doesn't know how to tell you and the rumor isn't true but, if u give it a little time i think he will come around and then you'll never know when he might just want to be more than friends!!!!|`|FcqDWdF1aa	Plain & simple he either dosen't know u like him or he doesn't like u.|`|IDR7hraXaa	Either he likes you or he is just being friendly and polite. You can get to know his feelings only by striking conversation with him Good luck!|`|OOwUlO4Jaa	You like him and it sounds like he likes you, if you leave it too long he might think he has been wound up by the rumors. make you claim and be a hot chick for him, he can't refuse you.
MfcTIdlraa	First, Macey Kay, he is not your responsibility.<br>  Suicide takes a huge amount of bravery, believe it or not.  I have been in his position for nearly 18 years and I still live.  It is really hard to do.  Don't tell him anything about dumping.  Please.  He doesn't need that now.<br>  What he needs now is a therapist and/or a psychiatrist.  Speaking of suicide is no laughing matter.  It is very serious.  Speak with his parents secretly about what is going on and urge them to get help for him.<br>  My thoughts and prayers are with you.|`|VZPtCkweaa	if you DON'T want to dump him, then DON'T! and DON'T think about it! it's NOT a problem right now!|`|19loAHyBaa	Take your power back. Call his bluff.<br>  get out before your in to deep because it isn't fair for your boyfriend to lay that kind of pressure and guilt on you. Break up with him, and be firm about it. He won't kill himself. He just wants to manipulate you, and make you feel guilty. But by doing that, he's not going to change your mind about how you feel about someone. He needs to grow up and learn that you can't manipulate and guilt someone into loving you. <br>  besides  people whom actually commit suicide VERY rarely threaten people and talk about it...because that is not what suicide is.|`|RxLSxs6Zaa	its not your fault if you want to dump him, hes just trying to make you feel bad. if you ever do wanna break up, just be straight up honest with him. then tell someone older and in charge that he's thinking of killing himself so they can get him some help.|`|KXgfAvsSaa	GO TO HIM|`|uLHtXibRaa	Lol..boo hoo...right..you believe this you will believe anything..tell him to grow a brain..|`|jrzttATfaa	I am 29 and I have heard this numerous times myself and they are all still alive... Don't believe him it is a way to try to hold onto you. Most people that talk about killing themselves won't. Tell him don't talk about be about it.. Nah don't really say that just ignore it and if you want to dump him do it. He will see there are more fish in the sea!!|`|2drqM7u8aa	just tell him that you care for him a lot and you don't know what you would do if he weren't there. if he has told you that he wants to kill himself, tell him that how much pain you would be in without him with you. good luck and hope this helps =)|`|ghOEi92Naa	if you cant break up with him without feeling like he will hurt himself, make him break up with you. do all the stuff he hates.|`|XGzBJ5XPaa	The guys a maniac if he's serious, think what he could end up doing to you
lPXhIga9aa	when she is in bed, tell her you love her and touch her boob. take of her shirt a little and kiss her neck. whisper when you talk and kiss her lips. head south a little, and kiss her boob. if she likes it, hump her, but start soft. if she doesn't like it, stop and give up until she does it to you! <br>  Good luck, and i hope i helped.|`|IzztdPIfaa	Ethan, IMHO, you need to spice things up.<br>  <br>  My perspective is that marriage makes you feel trapped. It makes every little thing much more important because you feel stuck with it for life. It alters your expectations of each other and you don't feel you live up to them. Not surprisingly, you feel bad, you row, then you can't show affection because you don't feel it. <br>  <br>  Communication is key. Spicing things up is, too.<br>  <br>  My wife and I tried this website ... Hundred sex games ... It is Erotic, in its noblest meaning. It was like falling in Love all over again. Our relationship has reached a new level thanks to a few of those "games" that we have carefully selected.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fire-up-your-sex-life.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fire-up-your-sex-life.com/</a>|`|Lt03NhXPaa	well just ask her if she is ready to have sex and move slow. dont try and rush it maybe she is waiting for the right time|`|B5WbBKDOaa	you should have started before see became your wife, see you on divorce court|`|d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa	Send her flowers, do the dishes for her, and beg her. LOL|`|W1rCsvTzaa	When was your sex life good?<br>  How long have you been together?<br>  When did it start to go bad and why?<br>  When did it stop entirely?<br>  <br>  Until you explain, there is no way to give you suggestions.|`|qUmZCJ79aa	Create a romantic setting.  Make a night of it with candles, dinner, wine,romatic music, and a couple of slow dances. Let it go from there.|`|EioOPbzbaa	Why do all men forget what their wife loves - it is a long, passionate kiss, moving down to neck and gently kissing her - you should remember from there.  As a background soft, romantic music, start a fire if cold enough, a blanket and pillows in front of the fireplace, or candles and rose pedals in a hot bubble bath.  Don't feel bad, my husband doesn't recall anything either.|`|jCMSybAnaa	Set the mood with music and something cozy to lay on.  Kiss her like you've been waiting to see her all day and then let your hands embrace slowly, not just your favorite parts, but everywhere.  When she's ready, you'll know.  Have a great evening.|`|iizKx4Bvaa	say honey can I introduce you to my friend. Let her meet him and get to know him well. Things should go smoothly. Have to have an introduction ceremony though.lol|`|eVK2zZsOaa	If you have to ask, you don't need to do it. That is something you should already know.
laGzhW44aa	Wow, you sound like you deserve better than her. You want love, she wants money, so why would you want her?<br>  <br>  It's alway hard when there's a break up, but, count your blessings, you are better off w/out her and its time to place importance of your time, your money, and yourself on you.  I wish you lots of luck!
C8DOT8Y7aa	Introduce yourself. There are so many ways to introduce yourself. Sometimes, it's the deciding factor in a friendship. You need to find a way to meet him. You can have a friend introduce you or go to a party he goes to, but if all else fails, wait until he's alone and introduce yourself. <br>  Discover his interests. Find out what he likes to do and ask him questions about it. This leads to great conversations, and he will want to talk to you more often if he knows that you're not always going to talk about getting your nails done. After a while, he will start to show interest in things that you like, and you and he will start to become friends. <br>  Spend time together. This is a deciding stage in your relationship. Are you just a friend he sees every now and then, or are you someone he spends a lot of time with? This is the time during which you have to build your bond with him. If you don't, you will be "just another person" to him. You have to be patient, because the length of time spent in this stage varies from person to person. <br>  Make your move. By now, you should be good friends - really good friends. If you're really good at this, he will probably already like you. However, regardless of whether he has told you that he does or not, you should tell him that you like him. Just tell him - don't be all passionate about it. Tell him in a discreet way, so that it won't ruin your friendship, but make sure you get the message across. <br>  Take the next step. This is where it's different for every person. By now, you have either realized that you hate them, or you're even more in love. They either like you back or they don't. Whichever way it goes, you have to run with it.
5AaMDz91aa	Sounds like a hard situation.  I think that you are stuck.  There is a website that helps people through everything.  You can email them, call, chat online, or just read what some other people reccomend. I definatly think that you should talk to a grown up about this.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	The bad thing is that your mother won't quit drinking until she makes the decision.  Your father needs to go to Alanon and if it is available you should go to Alateen.  It will give you and your father understanding of your mother's drinking problem.  Sorry to say this, but your father has got to confront her... saying she needs help for alcoholism and if she don't he will divorce her and get custody of you.  That might make her want to go to rehab.  I used to drink a case of beer per day and I must have been a hellion to the family.
EIY722Hwaa	Well first you should change your name on this answers thing. (cuz it says brandon's girl) lol<br>  Next... you need to stand out. Don't act like all the other girls. Don't follow him around. Guys don't like needy girls. Have confidence and rock it. Take charge. Guys also like girls who know what they want. Always smile and hold your head high. Good Luck!|`|wmANJEoVaa	i got this weird feeling his name is Brandon LMAO
htWw0OlCaa	Believe me, I understand the lego thing....LOL... I have an 11 year old that is crazy about them. I think he has a lot as well, but knowing that there is so many things you can build with those things, that's why I keep buying them for him. You sound like you like them a lot as well. <br>  I would just let him know that you know it seems that you may have enough, but in reality you don't. Explain to him that the things that you want to build take up a lot of the lego's and you need more, and that he should already know that you are willing to pay for them, its not like he will be out of any money. I hope this has helped. Best wishes|`|NZuJR79oaa	If his issue is that you have too much stuff, maybe you could offer to get rid of something of equal or greater volume in order to get the Legos?<br>  <br>  Also show that you can handle the amount of stuff you have by keeping your room clean and organized.|`|4nWv0NRuaa	tell him exactly what you told us.<br>  or tell him its an advanced birthday present for you and that he doesnt have to give you a present for your bday.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Parents usually like the whole give give thing.  If he gives u the Lego, U can give him help around the house chores or something.  Try that.|`|9hYOeeEAaa	save up your money and buy it on your own, or ask it as a b-day or xmas present|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	beg... but i wouldn 't hold my breath.  when dad's say no... it's no.|`|m3Wza3xraa	really random question but you should just tell your dad that its going to be with your money and that you really needed and if he says no  cry a little your 14 you can still get away with it if you are cute!!!! dont say please tho just cry and pretend you dont want him to see and that they are natural!!!|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	Discuss it with him. Tell him you have enough money to pay for most of it or to pay him back and tell him why you want it with valid reasons. And if he still says no remember there are plenty of other opportunities to get Lego's later.|`|zvzjZwFnaa	he's probably worried that you'll be squandering your money,  just let him know about the stop motion movies you want to make and maybe even show him what you plan on doing by making a little demo video of what you are interested in.|`|AA11103763	Work out a payment plan with him to buy it. (You will do stuff around the house to work to repay him the money.)<br>  He probably feels that the money in the bank is for college.|`|XQGm3lfPaa	I dont care wat u do.  I am 13 and I like legos.  Try talking to your mom or save up.  Also try showing ur dad that u have no money.|`|zal6shPUaa	i like lego too. say ill pay you back and really pay him back when you get the money. works with my mom kuz i dont got no dad|`|88SGoW1Iaa	you might have to wait to get them as a gift , birthday or christmas. Theres a better chance you'll get them that way|`|CGYDhXRNaa	tell him how you feel and that you really want it. Get a girlfreind btw..Lego's wont take you far in life.|`|rHoOOV7Zaa	I'm not sure, but I would go upon it in a mature way. Plan ahead if you really want to get the Lego set.<br>  <br>  1. Find the exact prices.<br>  2. Find a mature way to explain why you want the Lego set, why you can't get them yourself and why you think you deserve to get it (have you done something extra responsible lately?).<br>  3. Explain your case to him.<br>  4. If he says no, you need to accept it and try to gain as much money as you can immediately to buy it yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CoNRevnraa	Have you ever considered that maybe you DO have a lot?<br>  <br>  But if you really don't, just try to reason with him and tell him that you will pay for it if that's what he wants, and that it'll help you with ur stop motion movies! <br>  <br>  (oh and its kewl that you make stop motion movies! haha)|`|NtFC5sn4aa	well i dont think you are too old its what you like not what anyone else thinks... save up your money or just ask your dad for it when you go to the store and tell him why u want it-dont sound babyish ... btw dont say where you live enough kids get moulsted out there...<br>  <br>  good luck...|`|1neMZoRLaa	beg him- try to make a deal such as *I won't ask you for anything for X months/days/weeks*<br>  <br>  you could also just buy it without him knowing.|`|ECmWJiQgaa	punch him in the head then tell him to buy you them!|`|OngBk4Ejaa	umm wow|`|vo1Rpaztaa	i used to play with legos just show him ur money
dFHsAXDMaa	You know what I have been exactly where you are right now I got married the saturday after I graduated from college to the man I thought I would love forever. I got pregnant had a little girl christmas eve 1991. He decided to quit his office job making 75,000 grand a year  two weeks later to fullfill a childhood dream of driving a big  truck over the road from massachusetts to california and back. It was never about the money he made great money driving enough to care for his family it was not having him around for help and emotional support, after having two more children in the next 3 years being young and naive thinking he would eventually wanna be home with his wife and kids I told him to move out and if I was going to be a single parent I was actually going to be a single parent <br>  <br>  never in my life was I so scared.... so depressed.... and so lonely... but I dug down deep and walked away and handled it. <br>  <br>  You can find that inner strength too everyone has it.<br>  <br>  everyone I knew my family and friends though I was crazy to want to do it alone my kids were two girls 3 and 1.5 and a boy 6 months old and I had giving him the choice to come off the road or it was over and he chose his truck. I realized I had married young too young andI had made my bed so to speak. <br>  <br>  I divorced raised my 3 kids worked two jobs for a while to catch on bills we had in my name while married that were never paid and cleared my credit. I had a business degree but hated being stuck behind a desk all day so I went back to school and got a nursing degree and now work taking care of terminally ill cancer patients I remarried  quite a few years ago to a wonderful man and had one more boy and my children are now two girls 17 and 15 and two boys 14 and 11. <br>  <br>  I have learned over the years that if God brings you to it... He will pull you through it. You will be okay, you have the strength to make the choices you need to make for you. Dig down deep...and do want you need to do to make yourself  and kids if you have any happy okay <br>  <br>  you can email me if you ever need to talk sometime I know it is nice to have an impartial ear to listen and not judge.|`|bL9APqogaa	Yes, having someone there to listen to is great. That helped me so much when I was struggling. Find someone you know you can trust and talk to. Spend some time with them and discuss your problems. Make sure they will give you good advice.|`|ePpCKNT6aa	do you have any friends or family members who you can talk to? because i think those who love and know you will offer the best advice.I'm sure there's  always someone out there who will listen to you, and everyone makes mistakes so try not to stress too much about it and try to think about what you can do to make your life better and how to become stronger. If you feel that you are alone and don't have no one you can talk to try chat rooms or counseling groups.|`|IHKovEwqaa	smoke weed =]<br>  trust me - this will give you the inspiration you need & will bring your stress level way down<br>  you will be surprised at how much you start thinking about what makes you happy<br>  one day you might just decide to start saving up your money & move out<br>  [ps - it's not a drug, and the positive effects of weed outweighs the negative]|`|sU9wrTr4aa	Have you tried counseling? What seems to be the problem? You never did say?
ZDnLfB5daa	Well, tell her to befriend this guy, get to know him, if he is not "in Love" with his current girlfriend they will brake up, then if your cousin still feels the same about the guy, she can tell him how she feels and if he feels the same they will probably make a good couple, but also tell her that boyfriends are not everything, if she does not have one it is not the end of the world.|`|9MZcwppMaa	Why does she need to have a boyfriend right this moment? There are more important things than constantly being in relationships.|`|0ZZT0mr5aa	just tell your friend to stare at him and grin if he reacts..... that means he has feelings for your friend|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	Ask him!|`|707gOCvbaa	Tell her to find a guy not taken. The one she likes is off limits and the ex is a no too. At this point she's back on the market and should find someone that would make her heart flutter. best of luck to her.

Unless your roommate is a jerk, he's not going to break into your room without permission, drag his xbox into your room, connect it and play games when your not around. That's just way to much work.

W1xs3vYBaa	Depends on your definition of genius. I personally dislike the term, a lot. I also personally associate it with someone who has accomplished something at the top of the field that no one else has, meaning someone who is innovative. <br>  <br>  From our society anyone with a capable mind is a genius, so I guess you are. Your IQ score is in societies range of "genius" IQs. You've demonstrated you can complete school work. You most definitely have the potential. <br>  <br>  What do you plan to do with your life- Sciences, Arts? What do you find that you are passionate about? What do you want to see changed in the world around you?<br>  <br>  <br>  Just remember that a lack of work does not earn you any respect, it earns you callousness, envy and disdain.

e1F55L7aaa	Just don't drop them off the roof.....LOL|`|NQwljNOoaa	You said a mouth full when you said you were too old for that stuff.  That is so true. Those guys are acting like juveniles. The only mistake you are making is that each time you acknowledge them, it is a form of encouragement to them.  You can't let them down easy.  They don't respond to easy.  You just have to be honest and tell them that you are not interested in them.  The guy who threatens to kill himself need psychiatric counciling and you need to tell him to go get professional help because he is not your responsiblity.  Tell them both to grow up and leave you alone because you need to do what is best for your child and the two of them are not good for you nor your child.  If they persist, then you may have to tell them that you will call the police (to scare them off) if they keep harrassing you.  If that doesn't scare them off, then by all means DO call the police.  You are growing up and they aren't so they need to be out of your life right now.  Good Luck!

Also, not everything that worked with your last girlfriend, may work with your current. Each girl is different.

AA12398373	With your mom as a role model, it's not to surprising that you are going to take on some of her character traits. But that doesn't mean that it has to be a life sentence.<br>  The next time you catch yourself falling in to the same undesirable behaviour as your mom, STOP YOURSELF. I know it's easier said than done, but you are already well aware of what is going on, so now all it takes is a conscious effort to change it.<br>  <br>  It's a well documented fact that most people can break a bad habit in about thirty days.<br>  So if you put your mind to it, just select one trait you want to change, and make a concerted effort to not engage in that behaviour for a whole month, and soon you will discover that you have unlearned this undesirable behaviour.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	See a therapist yourself, and encourage your mother to do the same.|`|47I8LVjXaa	sex change|`|64tEOMOZaa	Well think in what ways your mum need to change to improve herself, yet you do them instead. <br>  Try taking deep breaths when you see yourself getting angry, and try seeing someone to talk to.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Uh oh..that happens, happened to me.

LUNne2O5aa	Hey.. I know the feeling. I felt like you were describing one of my "close" friends chloe. she always says things like: "thank god i hang out with you guys, otherwise you'd be alone" or "seriously, i'm a genius. you're not. "I'm really pretty, don't you think? " "I have a such a great sense of humor, otherwise i wouldn't be here". And i told her that. everything i felt. Even tho i've never really had a real friend. but you shouldnl't take crud from her. it's definitely not as easy as it sounds. and of course if you don't i completely understand. i mean, i thought i'd be lost w/ out her too. but if your not that type of person, then I suggest hanging out with her less. Or if she has a sense of humor joke about it.... Hopefully she'll grow up. But if you really value her friendship, then ignore it. Or at least try. I think she might be insecure. Chloe DEFINITELY is. she always follows around people. And then she starts talking herself (probably because she doesn't know ANYTHING interesting to talk about). She also (sorry if i'm making too many judgements :) sounds like a social climber. But if you're sure you want to be her friend, then maybe hint at it, like: "hey blank, chill, we've already heard it before" (that's probably not my best idea) but you could also say soemthing like: "hey, look, if i wanted a boyfriend i would tell you, but since you're my best friend, can you PLEASE take it down a notch?" or send her a pamphlet for ego shrinking. :) good luck!!! i hate dealing with these people. best wishes :)<br>  Go ahead and send her that card. Remember to say it softly though, and maybe throw in a complement or two. like, i really treasure your friendship but i've already heard a thousand times about ________. also, if i want a boyfriend i can get one myself. i appreciate the effort but i'd like the freedom to make my own decisions. :) You are a great friend and i feel comfortable around you but i need to tell you this. Please, just please consider this from my point of view. how would you like it if i went around talking about how amazing i am? you wouldnt. <br>  Then maybe later on: Look i don't need your comments about my appearance. I'm not insecure. you don't need to be insecure FOR me. If i wanted to be, trust me you'd know. <br>  <br>  Sorry i'm not much help. Chloe's better now. she actually listened for once. :) I really hope this works out for you|`|CoNRevnraa	Oh, I have a friend exactly like that! <br>  <br>  I kno confrontation might be hard for some people to face, but if she's annyoing you THAT much, its time for you to talk to her about this! <br>  <br>  Just tell her that you're sick of her putting you down and embarassing you, and it's gone on long enough. <br>  <br>  Hope things work out! :]<br>  <br>  P.S: Haha "My best friends ego > Kanye West's ego" that's funny! :D|`|5R0omMVnaa	Stop talking to her.

You can tell her to shut up if she's repeating things. or you can tell her that there are certain things she has to keep to herself.

ZFtZGCHVaa	well me and my friend have like sort of the same experience. we both love each other like best friends should but sometimes its like your situation.<br>  she would be in your shoes and i would be in your friends. how we got it resolved (cause i was doing the same thing as your friend) we just sat in a room and talked to each other. we both took out a paper and pencil and wrote down everything that we didn't like about them and talked about it. then we wrote down things that we think should be fixed in the way we act and stuff and talked about that.<br>  well for me, it kind of opened me up and showed me how she felt. i hope that it works for you :)|`|kZ296wkraa	You cant live without her so deal with it.

If you be firm about it i promise she wont do it again. I really thing u need to like raise ur voice lol.......<br>  After you tell her be like look (name) i dont mean to hurt your feelings but i know how this boy likes you and i know that ur beautiful and i really dont care to here it anymore.

uMLHPt1saa	First of all, what did he ask you? that's an important one you shouldn't have left out.  <br>  <br>  Well It all depends, personally I would become really embarrassed because I would think that I had just tried to go out with a girl who hated me. I would ponder what to do in my bed at night. In the end I would trick myself into thinking the girl is a total jerk and that she could have been  nicer and at least answered the question. <br>  <br>  But that's just me.

That's the only reason I can imagine for being in a plural relationship.

HKkbqlIuaa	Honestly, the only recommendation I can think of is for you to talk to him about it. If you guys have a strong relationship, you should be able to be honest. Now, if he is changing and does not want to go out anymore, you should not expect it every weekend. However, you could make a compromise and go out every two weeks. This should make you both happy. The only other alternative I can think of is you going out with friends and leaving the hubby at home. Well, good luck with everything. As for making more friends, the community service suggestion is good, but will you really do it? If not, I would suggest maybe talking to people you see when you go play golf or tennis. If not, how about work?|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	maybe volunteer work or other community service|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Maybe you could do something for other people?  Like help out with Habitat for Humanity, or some other cause, where you actually do something useful instead of just drink and entertain yourselves?|`|HDqPQbxtaa	im married for 3 yrs now and we never go out to bars, although we did in our single days. i just figure that going to bars and clubs wouldnt benefit our relationship. so we do other things, like the movies, zoos, outdoor trips, travel, get away for the weekend to vegas or ny. just be creative, and enjoy each other the best you can. not saying to stop going to bars, but you should give your hubby first dibs on hanging out over friends. good luck!|`|JBfgUoDzaa	may be you can start volunteering and some other community things so you can make some friends there.
Bp8ls3XMaa	depends on the situation.  if he/she is still single, no problem inspite of how many rejections.  If another scenario, that would be long story.|`|Wo5Ezmwiaa	I don't think people want that guy/girl to be miserable with them, I think they feel like they can change their mind about them. They feel like maybe the guy/girl judged them too quickly, or that they could love them if they gave them a chance. I think people chase after a person for one of two reasons. One - they really really felt something for the person, and just aren't willing to walk away. Or Two - they felt like it was a sure thing that the person would like them back, and when they don't, they have to protect their ego and see if they can change their mind.<br>  I just think people do it because love is one of the things in this world worth fighting for. And if they don't get it the first time, they sometimes find it hard to back down when in their mind, they feel like this person could be really special.

But don't be surprised if he's a little distant.  Guys can't read minds either so next time he pisses you off be a grown up about it and just tell him.

0kseszAKaa	Hahaha. Hes messing with yah. My bro says that to me all the time.

Don't think anything of it, but next time he says it, smile and say **** you.|`|ixHwF4apaa	excuse him, after all he is brother. nothing wrong in it|`|l0xnIquFaa	he was probably just playing. brothers do that to sisters a lot. <br>  <br>  if it really affended u just ignore him for a few days and wen he notices that u are ignoring him tell u that he upset u and im sure that he will tell you that he was kidding and that u look great|`|pOTigVYPaa	Sometimes people speak before they think.

r4N245AOaa	Occurs from the 16th c. (or possibly 15th c.), in representations of rustic, humble, or childish speech, in which it may of course have been in use much earlier, though it is not given in the Promptorium or Catholicon, where words of this class occur. <br>  <br>  Of the actual origin we have no evidence: but the forms dada, tata, meaning 'father', originating in infantile or childish speech, occur independently in many languages. It has been assumed that our word is taken from Welsh tad, mutated dad, but this is very doubtful; the Welsh is itself merely a word of the same class, which has displaced the original Celtic word for 'father' = Ir. athair.|`|zHJufZTcaa	Go ask Daddy to tell you about the birds, and the bees....

l0xnIquFaa	i have  3 brothers 2 older, 1 young so i still have a brother with me at home. but i was pretty close to my older brothers so i get what you mean.  even tho u wont c him every day you can still call him and email him and IM him.  mayb you can buy him and yourself webcams and then you 2 can talk over the computer. me and my brothers call eachother a lot, and after a while u get used to it.  it will b ok, just spend as much time as u can with him now.|`|2lS1NC6Maa	Hey there, I'm in the exact same place. My only brother left for college, and I am left here all alone :-)<br>  one big way I keep in touch with my bro is with MSN messenger. It's a really nice way to just say a quick hello or good night, even if there isn't much time. <br>  My brother had some quotes and pictures of motercycles on the walls in his room, and I asked him if I could use them. They make me think of him and smile :)<br>  Lastly, something that made me feel a little less bad about missing him is I make his favorite kind of cookies (oatmeal!) and send them to him every once'n while. That makes me feel like I'm doing something to help him out a bit, which is nice.<br>  So good luck to you and your brother!|`|LGLArmjRaa	It will suck a lot but at least you get to see him on holidays. If he has a webcam you can even webchat with him. When my brother left for college we webcammed a lot and saw each other every break we could. It hurt being away from him, but the constant talking and seeing each other softened the blow a lot and at times it didn't even feel like he was gone. Just keep in contact with him. Good luck!|`|L99yxBRxaa	Its not like hes going away forever and ever.  What you need to do is just find a way to keep in touch while he's away.  Chat with him online sometimes or call him on the weekends.|`|JdEch19Paa	yeah i agree both get webcams and web cam maybe like every weekend to talk about whats going and stuff. and maybe get his email, aim, yahoo, myspace, facebook and keep in touch and always talk to him whenever hes on your mind nad ask how things are? has he met friends or anything? and before he leaves tell him you will miss him so much and see what you two  can think of to not miss each other so much. and when hes gone keep a calender and count down the days till youll see him.|`|4lkKXJCKaa	Well it is hard at first but it gets better you will get used to it, just look forward to the times he will come home to visit|`|YD7vAA2Naa	girl your brothers are leaving you are free from all those stupid jokes <br>  look being close to your brothers is great but hay that just means you'll have to do something great when he comes home for brake.|`|f7Ftz9gkaa	Well my brother moved into my room and took all the stuff i didnt have room for....<br>  but seriously just grow a pair.|`|I4wuyQGWaa	aww i hate that, my brother moved away last year ):<br>  <br>  my advice: keep in touch with him a lot, go down and visit him in college and send him mail every once in a while. also send him packages. for ex, i sent my brother candy on valentines day and easter. i also have pics of me and him in my room so its like hes always there. call him up every once in a while toooo<br>  <br>  hope i helpeddd|`|M5oMYc9Laa	Be supportive.  Accept it and wish him well.  You are a kid and can't see the big picture but most parents raise their children with the goal of higher education and independence in mind.  Before you know it, it will be your turn to do the same thing.  He is just going away to college, not moving to Mars.  He will still love you but it is time for him to take on the next chapter in his life. Wish him well.|`|PeAqoy1vaa	just call him when you can and when he's not busy and try to find ways to spend time with him. maybe once he gets settled in to college he'll let you shadow him on a day. that's what  i did with my sister. i got to see how a few of her classes were like, got to eat lunch at the cafeteria there, and got a tour of the whole place. and it was fun spending the whole day with my sister.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	its going to be hard, but short of calling/writing emails everyday theres not much you can do. you'll be surprised at how connected you can stay.... i was very close to my siblings my whole life, and my older brother left to college I was devastated. and i was 13, when the internet and computer thing started up, so there was no e-mail and the calling was expensive... but we kept in most constant conact, and his visits were always the best.<br>  then, now, im the one thats going to school, ALL THE WAY IN CHINA! so im REAL far from my little sister. at first i thought i was making her suffer like what id gone through, but in reality today its sooo much easier to be apart... you can talk all the time (via webcam) and we write the funniest stuff... everything will work out, and youll see those 4 years will go by in a blink.|`|BMIYf9okaa	My sister went away to college, and when I took her to the airport, I cried. People cope differently. I never told my sister I missed her, I just kept to my self. Eventually you get used to it (it takes a while). It took me a few months to get adjusted to my sister being gone, but even though you are adjusted, you will still miss your brother. That's how it is for me. <br>  <br>  Good luck. <br>  I hope things go well.|`|EGEOOZLXaa	Hide in his trunk and go with him. lol|`|xcPO9Io2aa	think of it, hes gonna come back and visit u rite?!..just keep in contact wit each other

So I say the best thing is just either ignore them or if you are confident in yourself, just toughen yourself up a little bit. Show them that you aren't the weak kid they think you are. Stand up for yourself but don't necessarily curse them out..it'll only piss them off even more. Just say things like "Yo what do you want?" or like "I'm tired of you guys" Ugh, I really hate immature, nasty teenagers...Just hang in there..you only have 3-4 more years..|`|uc5IwIzuaa	hmm you sound like i nice guy, seriously idk wtf their problems are but guys can be guys... but anyways just keep training and eventually beat the f**k out of them, or atleast one of them. and if you're not a violent kind of person then just ride it out and show them your NOT the weak kid they think you are.<br>  <br>  i really, really, honestly wish i could do more....|`|vKvSgkhHaa	Tell your parents, or another adult.  Any teacher at school.  Ask to speak to them in private, they will keep your confidence.  They will be able to work out a system for you to go "downstairs".  They will also watch you, so you don't have to worry about what might happen.  Please be a snitch.  A friend of mine went through something very similar he did not speak up and he started to withdraw.  This lead to depression, and more.  After it came out that this is what was going on I spoke to the consular at school she told me how the school and teacher will discretely watch for bulling so that it will be stopped.  Please share your story with an adult you trust tell them that you want help to deal with this issue. <br>  Please.  They will help.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	Welcome to the jungle called high school, these guys are going to bully you until you stand up for yourself. I am not sayin go out and take on half the school, but don't let them walk all over you because they will push you around until you dig in your heels and push back.|`|fwUfEMvRaa	Have you tried talking to your school's counselor?  They are specially trained to help you in situations like this.  They can give you advice on how to handle situations like you have described.  <br>  <br>  High school doesn't last forever (THANK YOU GOD!) even though it does seem like it when there are problems like this.  Probable what will happen to those bullies is they will be thrown out into the real world and find out in a hurry that their attitudes won't get them anywhere.  You will go to your high school reunions to find that those idiots are all fat and bald with ugly wives and stupid mean children.  <br>  <br>  Don't associate with any of them.

Im 16, and I dont think I look that young, but my hair stylist thought I was in elementary school when I was in 8th grade. haha I still get comments saying that I look younger these days. <br>  <br>  Just because that person thought you were in your 30's, doesnt mean everyone thinks your the same age. Not everyone looks the age they're supposed to be. Some look older and others way younger(me lol). But think about it, imagine all the advantages you have when people think that you look older. Who knows, that one person could have a complete different outlook on you then everyone else. <br>  Im not sure on ways to make you look your age, sorry. But im sure you dont look that old!|`|AjBpAPpdaa	Eat healthily, be a bit more active.

That's what I think<br>  <br>  Lots of luck<br>  -kiki|`|HeB9M5lgaa	Find out why he is this way. Has he always been like this or is it a new behavior? If he has always been like this then he probably won't change.  you could try talking to him perhaps you two can reach a compromise. Otherwise maybe seek some marriage counseling. Something is obviously bothering him.|`|7c7e9ee35d10a7b0e7e011d66f491c1baa	How long has your relationship been like this.  If this is something recent then he is PROBABLY cheating on you.  If this is something that has been going on for a long time then it may just be that the two of you have grown apart.  Try and talk to him and let him know how you feel.  If he brush it off, or give a cheesy explanation, then sorry sweetie he's cheating.  But, if he is willing to talk to you about it and fix the problem then work on it.  You have a gut and 9 out of 10 times it's always right.  Listen to it!  If things don't get better don't cheat just get out of the relationship.|`|AjjKETIxaa	Most two reason for Divorce:<br>  1.

If so, ask him to see a counselor.  If he refuses, tell him to go to couples therapy.  If he refuses that, he's not interested in your feelings to support and better the marriage.  I wouldn't cheat on him, but you are left with no choice to end the marriage or have a short separation to see what happens.  Affection is a huge part of marriage, as well as, being open with each other.  I was wondering if he was seeing someone else, considering what you have said.  I wish you the best of luck and be strong.|`|a4z1JHgLaa	You may already be doing this, but I'm going to suggest to try loosening up and having a little fun.  Go out for a night out on the town and ask him to come.  Sometimes, it can be really mundane staying in the same routine.  Maybe even depressing.  Do something light and fun like going to a comedy club.  If there's something he really likes doing, you could go and do it with him.  Don't ask for sex.  Just let the evening put him in the mood.  You might even spice things up with some sexy new under clothes.  Good luck to you and congratulations!  Ten years is wonderful accomplishment!|`|zHJufZTcaa	I think the biggest problem is couple fall into too much repetition in their daily lives. I have the same exact situation here, only the rolls are reversed. They start to take things for granet, and they forget to make time for each other. I know my wife always claims to be tired, and whatever other excuse you can think of. It sucks, and it makes you feel like crap, but as one "CHILD" replied.. "get a new man" is not as easy as it sounds, and isn't the answer when you love someone.|`|618b763bcbdec675a22a2a35212b1e29aa	i am in this same mess rite now.stop bitching at him,guys also need loving.most women think its all about them.they seldom try to turn the man on.start doing things you done when you first started dating.

We focused on our educations, our careers, and serving in  ministries while our friends married and divorced at younger ages.  We learned from their mistakes. <br>  <br>  I had four proposals (six if you count the guys who came back into my life and proposed a second time), but none of them where "the one."  I refused to lower my standards and was perfectly content to be single.  <br>  <br>  Then one day in church I looked up and there was my Mr. Right!|`|2keIEMFUaa	Yep!  I'm one of them and I'm a 100% WOMAN too.  I think it's because it takes a lot of work and I haven't found anybody yet that I'm willing to work that hard for yet?  NO! Really it's because I'm to darn picky at least that what all my sister say.  I am a wonderful loving person and I should have guys all over me but I don't and the ones that are forget it, not my type at all...  I have it pretty good on my own, I live by myself, I work at home because it's my job, I have a nice little MB sports car.  I do get lonely sometimes, but that's life. It's kinda of nice some times not to be bother or have to pick-up after someone everyday.  I am seeing someone right now and he comes and goes and I kinda like that too.  We will see what will happen down the line if anything.  Oh! By the way I just turned 53 Feb 4th and the best thing about it is I don't look my age when I tell people they can't believe it they think I'm in my 30's LOL and I don't act my age either.  I think it's because I've never been married or had kids to age me LOL|`|qouUjd7Raa	I am over  40 and never been married.

One of the reasons is, well, marriage isn't the ultimate goal for everyone, some are happy being unmarried.  Another reason could be that they are gay and only recently have we seen states allowing gay marriage, or placing bans on such an institution.  Really, if you think about it, marriage is just a piece of paper and a few rights/ tax breaks you didn't have when you were engaged.  Nothing in your love for that person has changed just because you spent thousands of dollars.|`|1EH32ennaa	well i know over ten people who havent gotten married and there over forty but ive also have seen people over forty who have been married mabey your happy with just or self or mabey before you know it you will find the right one but just have fun and live your life many people are not married and lived happy life ut yes i know many people who have never been married :)|`|jsIjyDEPaa	My great aunt is 83 years old and never got married.

Tw0Ci97Yaa	if u ever wanna talk about it, my email is smexyemolover15@yahoo.com.:)<br>  <br>  i think u should do chores around the house. to help her out. and wear slippers. shes probally under alot of stress. jus do it and see what happens. it makes sense that shed get mad about it. maybe its unreasonable, but atleast shes not a deadbeat and left you. or anything like that. i think if you are good people treat you good. idk about ur whole situation because my mom never yells at me. if i dont do somthing she reminds me to. sometimes i think shes crazy because she is never mad. even though i dont listen most of the time. lol, though i know sometimes it feels like we are more of the adults than the parents are, all im saying is that youre mom could be doing the best she can, and i think the most we can do as kids is just wear the slippers.|`|pOTigVYPaa	See a school counselor.  You've got major issues.|`|bL9APqogaa	I know what you mean.  I went through something similar. <br>  One thing that could help is (and this would be hard!) helping around the house a bit, like doing a chore or two. And if you could (maybe you can't right now) apologize for not helping her more. You might not be wrong but apologizing always helps. Try and listen to her more. I can never imagine how life must be for you! I can believe why you want to run away! I did too at that time in my life. <br>  IF you want to talk more to me, you can e-mail me.|`|5EHnbBX4aa	My Mom is addicted to alcohol and she is never at my house an she hits my sister and not me because my sister doesn't have a father so she cant go anywhere and i can  doesn't have a job and curses and doesn't do the important  things that she needs to do and she only does little useless things to make me and my sister think that she is a good mother  and had me at 15 and my sister at 17 i would rather have a bossy mom  because your mom cares about you but she showes it in a diifferent way|`|KXuNNj11aa	How sad, I hope you can talk to someone close to you that can help or advise you what is best.

E2OKRhwYaa	I know a girl who's 6'0 in the 9th grade! Being tall is a wonderful thing, I'm pretty tall and a lot of my friends are shorter then me, I used to feel weird but then I realized not to worry so much on something as silly as my height.

3lPL6pVBaa	America has not decided yet what good texting etiquette is, but I think your observation is correct: People don't always say hello or goodbye when they text.  <br>  <br>  I think that's why I prefer telephones.  I find texting unsatisfying.  And seeing someone face to face is even nicer than a phone call. :)  <br>  <br>  I would say just send a text message and forget it and get back to work.  If they text back, they text back.  <br>  <br>  If you're -really- frustrated . . . you can always give them a call and ask them what they think about what you just texted. :)  <br>  <br>  I used to date someone who loved texting and I would look down at the tiny screen with words on it and I'd think: I'd really rather be talking to her.  Words on a tiny screen are just not that compelling.|`|2Q3aOzebaa	I have no idea, but you're not alone. my guy friends do this to me all the time.  Even if we're not talking about crushes.  But for some reason guys never really want to talk about their crushes and such.

SFUM3Jgvaa	You don't seem mean. It's probably because you live in the US where 2/3 of the population is retarded.<br>  <br>  That would make sense in your case. They are retarded you aren't. <br>  <br>  Talking to retarded people is really hard and frustrating. I would just ignore both of them and don't even look at them when you pass them. COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM even when they are talking to your face. That should stop their theories and piss them off.|`|R2teBtllaa	wow thats straight jr.high drama at its finest|`|yrxENGqbaa	Tell the whore that shes a whore,skank,slut,etc. and tell her that at least i have a life and a future, I am not gona end up on a pole!!

She how she likes it!! <br>  <br>  *PAYBACKS A ****** (like her)|`|UMYda9Jaaa	Hate to tell you this, but paying any kind of attention to a boy is equivalent to flirting in high school. Even if you don't mean it, everyone else will think you do. It's the weird, annoying law of adolescence. Thank goodness all of that drama ends in a few years. <br>  <br>  Best way to get rid of them? Leave them completely alone and don't talk about them!
WjxqhZG9aa	I think you should do whatever is necessary to keep your marriage strong and the communication lines open. When there's honesty and respect in a marriage, there's no worry about infidelity.  <br>  I think that if you've done all the necessary things, and your husband cheats... by all means, leave him!  That's the only situation in which, I personally, advocate divorce.|`|5lFppGAVaa	No I'm not going to put up with anything and everything but I'm not going to jump ship just because of one incident.  Its easy to say what you would do when your not in the situation.  I have no personal experience but I'm watching my best friend go through this and she used to swear up and down she would leave if he cheated but it happened and she is still trying to make it work.  I tell you LOVE makes you do crazy things.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	I think you should really work hard at your marriage if you are married to a great person and are truly in love with that person and that person is really repentant and has made significant changes.<br>  I have come to learn that most men will cheat if given the opportunity so jumping ship is not always the solution.|`|Awywcn2Caa	It depends on how hard he tries. If he did give a crap and just kept up his cheating, I would leave. If he made a mistake and was really sorry and bent over backwards to work it out then I would at least try for my kids. Cheating can't ever be taken back or made better. But some women can deal with it and still live. But there will always feel like something is not right and the love can never be pure again.|`|hb94oOSeaa	I believe you should do what ever it takes as long as it does not compromise your self respect, physical or mental health and the well being of your children.<br>  There are some lines that when crossed there is no going back.|`|AA11122479	Some things are not forgivable and to me cheating is the ultimate assault on a relationship.

Then sit down with him and ask questions. He may not tell U the truth, but at least he'll have a chance to talk if he wants to. <br>  U simply have to weight the pros & cons of each situation. Once a man starts doing certain things (porn) it is hard for them to stop, so the woman has to ask herself how much can she stand? Same thing if U find out your man is gay. U just have to know how U feel about it first, and then approach the problem.|`|IvMPh09baa	depends, as long as doing so doesn't sacrifice my own self respect then yes.   but my husband would not ask me to do anything to make me disrespect myself just for our marriage.<br>  <br>  i will do what it takes as long as he is doing so also.  marriage is teamwork, it doesn't work if only one person is giving and the other is taking.  so if there is cheating going on, as long as we are both willing to get to counseling and tackle the real problem for the infidelity then yes I will stay and work on my marriage.  but if the cheating continues and he doesn't want to stop or get help for our problems, then that would mean he is no longer giving to our marriage and he is just destroying it.. so i would check out of the marriage then and there.|`|OHydEvTCaa	Yes because YOU make the choice to marry this person and  you have to think up possibilities and determine if you could stay with this person through the GOOD, BAD, and the UGLY! So whoever I marry ( LORD say the same!) I will trust GOD and him to not let me down!!|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	I would do anything for my marriage BUT some things such as involving another in our " bedroom " or something I would NOT tolerate.|`|vXubuAqzaa	i would do whatever it took to keep my marriage.. but cheating is  WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY out of line.. he could kiss my *** goodbye*
wgZVeLZPaa	I agree with Lisa M. FLAGS! <br>  If he is that concerned with what his friends think, it's always going to be like that. You can't make anyone like you, and if he tells you only the negative things they say you already have your guard up which would make for an uncomfortable meeting of the friends.<br>  <br>  I think you need to take a step back and think about this before you move in with him. If he's taking everything they say to heart and not listening to you, I think it's a sign that he might not ever take you seriously.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I'd drop a person like that so fast they'd end up in China!|`|dTaGzh6Haa	This guy sounds like a total jerk. As in, your total opposite. <br>  I'd think twice before becoming any more involved with him. The red flags are waving, girlfriend. You have been warned.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	You need to leave him.  He's not a very good man and he doesn't seem to respect you very much.|`|6BjZkRuYaa	Agree w/ Lisa M.  Why are you wasting your time with this guy?  I am totally suspicious of people who will tell you the sh1t others say about you!  WTF is that????  He sounds like an immature idiot. RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN,|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Apparently they are.
PKtqcw5yaa	omg. he is a jerk. u should record one of your calls with mike or an aim chat with mike that you had about him saying how he loves you. then u should show it to ur friend. explain to her about how big of a jerk he is and that u dont wanna lose your friendship over him.  hes an ***. what happened with chris by the way. y did he break up with u? what did mike tell him?|`|kZ296wkraa	you risk the chance she wont believe you but she needs to know. Get evidence via text messaging or record a conversation. He has the traits of a stalker|`|xTNxWlH7aa	well he is a dick no doubt depends if she really likes him you wont unless you do something like video tape him coming on to you cuz (from experience) friends chose lovers over friends so i mean i know its your friend but it has to hit the fan sometime so let her find out on her own|`|OTWaQCQ3aa	lol he sounds like a funny dude, being able to keep that up for such a long time. be friends w/ benefits. tell louise that too.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	tell her what you wrote here|`|6JOTtBSGaa	OH goodness, This Mike guy has issues. Tell Mike, In the rudest possible way, that your extremely not interested. Don't be polite, be the opposite of who you are. He ovb, loves you you really are. Tell Louise the whole truth, even the parts you think might hurt her a little bit. Invite her out to dinner, and explain the whole story. Tell her what you told.. Yahoo.. hahah tell her what he said. Explain to her that he really is evil and that if she were your friend, she would believe you. Everything will work out of she really is your good friend. Mike needs to get out of your life. He  is trouble, and a bit freaky. Tell Your parents or someone you trust. Like The police.. ahahaha But Be careful. Hope I Helped :)|`|5oIu1GlCaa	tell her this story.. that you just typed here.|`|t80nVuYbaa	give mike a good dose of his own medicine. dont get mad or sad. get even with him. he screwed up your relationship with Chris, so screw up his relationship with louise. i dont think that was fair of him to just screw up your life just because he wanted you. dont give him the satisfaction. and show louise this story, because hopefully she'll understand and believe you.
Qu6jpbNuaa	aww how cute! locker love!<br>  i think hes jusst flirting right now. and maybe he is starting to become interested. give it time and if this kind of stuff continues then he definitely likes you and you should for shizzz flirt back.
jlEyE088aa	Talk to her seriously.  <br>  <br>  Do some seraching in your inner self also.  Who knows, maybe you have to do some adjustments yourself.|`|fwUfEMvRaa	You are being an overly needy friend with her.  She sounds like someone who wants to be nice to everyone and you sound like someone who wants a friend to just be friends with you.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't pour out my heart to her anymore....she just isn't into that with you.  Maybe find another friend to talk about more personal issues with.....someone who might be going through the same things as you are.|`|gyBtDSiUaa	Theres to options:<br>  <br>  1. Go up to her and talk to her about how you feel.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  2.Just leave her, dont hang with her as much or talk to her as much. Try hanging out with new people. Maybe to her you come off too 'clingy.'<br>  If she was a good friend, like you say she is, she would come running back to you.
s8TTaIj2aa	it all depends on what kind of person he is and if you're his girlfriend and his bestfriend you know what he likes already go with you gut feeling. Try doing something sexy for him lingerie, blindfolds, etc. guys love that stuff and it will never fail.|`|NvcXC4Hyaa	I always try to pick a unique and special gift for my friends and loved ones. I found this great site — <a href="http://my-song.ca/s/bdo1!" rel="nofollow">http://my-song.ca/s/bdo1!</a> You go on and make a personalized song — I did it for my best friend’s birthday. I had a great time putting the song together. It’s completely personalized, and so cute! It’s something I know she won’t forget for a long time.|`|gn8Ak9Y5aa	Check out: <a href="http://my-song.ca/s/bdo1" rel="nofollow">http://my-song.ca/s/bdo1</a> they make personalized love songs, I was speechless it is the most amazing gift I have ever received. The song is completely tailor made for the recipient, it is HOT!!!!!!  Everything was original and one of a kind. That was the theme. Personalized gifts are always better, they come from the heart. Anyone can go to the mall and pick up a sale item or a CD, make it count. Good Luck!!!!|`|vHBvkROeaa	You may not have enough for your scrapbook but you can try offering him smth unique like a nice canvas printed with your photo together in the style you like. This way you will also avoid your faces to be seen as realistic as in photos (if you don't want that) by choosing the Che or Lichtenstein style and you also get to have a nice memory of your couple. Here's a source: <a href="http://www.photo-print-on-canvas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.photo-print-on-canvas.com/</a>|`|awhQ6avSaa	I actually just got my boyfriend a cute anniversary gift recently. If you go to <a href="http://noteableyou.com/the_gifts/" rel="nofollow">http://noteableyou.com/the_gifts/</a> you can make a really cute present for your boyfriend. You can also throw him a big surprise party with lots of alcohol for the big 21 :) hope that helped!|`|BPSC092daa	if you have an inside joke or something... get him something to go with that. my girlfriend calls me her Superman(long story) so she got me a Superman shirt. i thought it was cute!
8P6MmLv0aa	A lot of men use compliments to work there way into your nickers and if you've had a bad experience that can leave you uneasy when some one else give you a compliment that may be genuine.<br>  I can't say it going to be easy to to get over something like that as trust is a hard thing to fined again but not all guys are like that.<br>  some times a smile will get you through, you don't have to say anything back.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Sounds like you don't feel worthy of a compliment and that is what makes you uncomfortable, which I have had this too. Just smile and say thank you:) That's all you have to do. Eventually it will just come easier to you.|`|HhWDbdNOaa	thats what happened to me<br>  all i do is usually say<br>  thanks, that means a lot!<br>  or thanks, you too|`|CBa9G4j4aa	Just say thank you that's so nice of you. So in a way you are complimenting them back by saying they are nice. And it doesn't make you sound cocky or conceited because it's not like you are saying I know right or something. So just be polite =]
Bp8ls3XMaa	caught by surprise.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Yes, I know. This sounds cliché, but REALLY; be yourself. If you aren't yourself when getting to know a guy, and you end up going out with him, is it really fair to you that he likes you for who you're not? If that's confusing, just think of how long you're going to have to keep up the act. <br>  Get a new look! It can be as dramatic or subtle as you want; dye your hair pink (this may not attract some groups of guys), or get side bangs or layers, but dont get so caught up on looks. If he's a good person, he'll barely notice. The possibilities are endless, and this is sure to get your guys' attention! <br>  Ask your friends for advice; there is a good chance that some of them have had boyfriends. If not, think about if you have the TIME to have one, and if you are ready. <br>  Don't rush it. Guys are just as shy as girls, and when you reach up to kiss him on the first date, he might be happy, but he also might be a bit nervous and scared. Work your way up the ladder: Hugging', 'Holding hands', First kiss, 'Cuddling', French kissing and making out... you finish the rest. Just make sure that when you reach the end of the ladder, you go back to the basics every once in a while. It gets a bit tiring at the top, over and over again. <br>  Have fun! Relationships aren't supposed to be about stress and being 'tied down'. If you feel this way, consider taking a break from boys!|`|8P6MmLv0aa	I don't know about other men but if a woman said she likes me I would be very flattered and it would make me happy.<br>  but then that's me.|`|9Ed7cgAFaa	I wouldn't be reluctant; that sounds great. (Assuming she doesn't appear really desperate.)|`|8adee73ccc06e52ea84f99eba7588af8aa	Women tell men they like them?  This is in what country?
7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	Certainly it would<br>  <br>  I have to agree too that the school should be more responsible though no surprise there, all they wants is the money.<br>  <br>  I think its time you speak to that kid's mom. She should not have let such thing happen.|`|d23F89ECaa	That's happened to me as well, in many aspects.<br>  <br>  People take advantage of people.  It's been happening since the dawn of civilization.  And those closest to us sometimes do it the most.<br>  <br>  I don't like it and I never do it.  I know people who are rather popular in the Toronto music scene.  But I treat them just like one of the guys.  I know people who could afford to take care of every financial problem I have but I never ask for a penny.  And I know people who could get allot done for me but I always do it myself.  I don't even like asking for help in general but that's a different story.  But this, is a low blow and I'd be right pissed off about it.|`|sEzrs3Uyaa	why in the world did you write the check?  Sounds to me like your cousin is using you and you let her do it.  Untill you start saying no and doing what you know is right it will happen again and again.|`|FkunZ9q4aa	You shouldn't have paid for it.  It's not your kid.  You should have refused.|`|vTra7n5baa	Yes, this is arrogant behavior and your cousin is not your child.  Why should you pay for her?  However, you should have been more forceful with the office people telling them to take up the issue with your cousin before acting on it at all.  You may have helped this child, but you have further enabled lazy and inconsiderate parenting of your cousin.  She has got the message that you will cover her child's expenses and you must now seek to undo this.|`|sA8w2znyaa	Yes it would make me angry. It's just another case of family taking advantage of a person. It doesn't matter whether or not you could afford it, but she should've had the common courtesy to ask you. You're a nice person, so she put you in a position of doing the "right thing" because she knew 100% that you would.|`|48e1c61ac4e4edff368144a0ab70aa61aa	I wouldn't be angry at just my cousin, but the school as well!  It is really that easy to just point your bill at another direction?  <br>  But yes, you have every right to be angry and your cousin should not be treating you in such a manner, especially if it is regarding keeping her child in school.|`|KXuNNj11aa	Yeah, nothing like putting someone on the spot.  How rude of your cousin to have you pay her debts.  I would let her know that it won't happen in the future and that she owes you for what you paid at the school.  What a user.|`|dLxi6AQCaa	Your cousin is a dick,  and you didnt have to pay the bill just tell the school that you didnt approve it.|`|AA11270626	Take your cousin on "The Peoples Court" with Judge Maryllin Millian!!|`|CphIBXMaaa	Yes but U work hard for your money; and just because U can afford it doesn't mean U have to pay it!|`|gspTDufpaa	Jai, You already know the answer to that. But I do understand why you paid the bill. She is way too cute and smart to be kicked out of school just because her mom is a inconsiderate person.<br>  <br>  I would of done the same thing.|`|71VRvldJaa	Your cousin was waaay out of line to do that and you were crazy to pay it!  Now you've done it once, she'll be expecting you to do it again.<br>  However, If you don't mind doing it and you want to keep your little cousin in school, then its really not an issue is it!  I would definitely say something to her though.  Whether you can afford it more than she can is not the issue.  She was being very presumptuous and it was very sneaky the way it was done and I'd certainly tell her I didn't appreciate what she did.
OTvymEWGaa	You can put up "No Trespassing" signs on your property at the beginning of your yard, driveway, etc.  I would also notify the landlord-he may be unaware of all the problems that are going on.  After say 10pm with the noise, call the police.
GAnCdatkaa	19 is not old!!I'm 27 and I feel like I have <br>  turned into an old fart!! Job security, money,<br>  and finances.The government is ruining everyone's<br>  life!!Have fun while you still can!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bkgBLjuvaa	don't worry i'm the same, way ! i'm scared. :l
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	IT may have felt that way to you being that you havent had a girlfriend but it is different. They do it only for payment- but I could be wrong maybe she felt a little something for you as well - who knows. I am sure you can go out and find someone other than a prostitute- dont give up on yourself.|`|RBQrgByeaa	No, that's actually WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than a wife -- plus they leave when you're done. Are you ugly or shy?|`|f9sL3WgQaa	If you ask me..neither one can be true love. You feel true love within yourself..only you feel what you feel. so in reality only you can make you feel that way.|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	the lady you were with is maybe a very good business woman  and a good human being.<br>  <br>  she maybe was working on you so that you will come back for more, and keep coming back.<br>  <br>  maybe she is a s lonely as you are and like you, need the warmth of another human being. <br>  <br>  hope you find a girlfriend soon. a girl friend can give and share from the heart. likely, a girlfriend will have needs similar to yours. a girlfriend will likely not be experienced as the paid lady.<br>  <br>  as the lady above said, be careful of STDS and other parasites.|`|xnhwmontaa	lol wow....she probably does that for extra moneys. thats what it would feel like but minus paying her <br>  <br>  the girl ur doing this with doesnt love or even like you keep that in mind!<br>  <br>  <br>  and keep in mind all the STD's u probably already have!|`|vXubuAqzaa	i bet when she was kissin you and rubbin on you she was chargin you extra wasnt she?|`|hjc2y3TMaa	You cannot make love to a prostitute nor do you have the bond or friendship that a real relationship brings. It's about sex and sex is not the same as love...they are connected and yet totally separate. I suggest you try harder to find a real woman to share yourself with and then you can judge for yourself what love is or isn't.|`|naequcqlaa	I would no doubt say she was just better than the rest!  You just lucked out this particular time.  I do doubt VERY much that you w/find the same feelings w/her as you would w/a wife...at least I hope not anyway.  There's NOTHING like truly being in love w/someone.  Just NO difference in the world.  You'll see one day & realize just what the difference really is, then you'll just know what being in love is, & how deep it goes.  Best to you...:)|`|WjxqhZG9aa	No.  Any relationship with a prostitute lacks two key components... trust and respect.  You know that she isn't going to tell you all the details of her job, and you will always wonder and worry about contracting an STD.  Then you obviously don't respect her, even if you think you do, because you're paying her to be affectionate to you.  I don't doubt that you had feelings... but they're fake from her, so you won't ever find happiness down that road.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	No it is not like real love.  It is the kind of love you get when you pay for it. They will not be there for you in hard times or be devoted to you.  They are there for the money and when it is gone they are gone.  It is just sex and no love so you need to decide if all you want is sex or do you want someone who loves you and is committed to you.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	yes and you don't have to listen to them *****. you have to pay for sex either way, might as well not have to listen to them whine........|`|elhcuN19aa	Hopefully you tipped her for the extra stuff lol<br>  <br>  I know she will come back knowing she gets a dinner and a movie and get paid doing it lol|`|9yurQ85Eaa	Ewwwie! You need to find a different girl with a different profession. They can give you more love and warmth than a hoe.|`|mCM363I9aa	they can provide STD's|`|KmC0K59taa	The prostitute has no feelings for you whatsoever.  You are paying her to act this way.  It is not genuine.  She may be repulsed by you for all you know.  She acts like this with 10 other guys a night too.<br>  <br>  It's not wise to sleep with prostitutes.  You can still end up with herpes and warts.  Condoms don't cover up everything you know.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	No.  Absolutely not.  That chick was doing exactly what you paid her to do, that's their job.  A love partner is exactly that, your partner, and there is a lot more to it than sex, or cuddling, or watching movies.  If you want to meet a real person, then stay away from the prostitutes.  It's not an attractive hobby.|`|WhCCIuOEaa	Ok. I'm young but I know the difference between a false love and real love.<br>  She's doing all those things because you paid her and/or she wants a tip. Either way, shes just doing her job as a prostitute. It's not love just business, which is not how it feels like to have a love partner.|`|ff3Gcd5Oaa	A prostitute is a professional so even if you did find some particularly accommodating ones, no it can never be the same because SHE IS GETTING PAID TO BE NICE TO YOU!  How could this compare to being with someone who actually cares about you?|`|usgKQuS1aa	that is just sex, that is not love at all.  Lust is more of a word for it.|`|g6dOrpZHaa	Maybe she will be your girlfriend. It sounds like true love. Do you have the money to provide for her and take her away from her lovely lifestyle? Think about it honey.|`|IocgFjr2aa	You probably did feel a tinge of love. Which is pretty sad, considering you're paying her.|`|oqLqPwsJaa	Wow. Lolz. You have some major issues my friend.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	What you'd miss is the nagging part,|`|vRe6CwgEaa	False love|`|pqFT4pJWaa	if you gots enough cash they can|`|2keIEMFUaa	Yes! Only if she really truly loved you back.  But if your paying her then she is looking at you for the money not the honey, so don't read into something that may not be there on her part.  So if you want to have through true feelings then you need to get out and fine a great girl friend and besides you don't want to date Prostitutes just for the fact of getting STD's, you don't know what they may have right?  I have a friend who I love as my sister who is a Prostitute and poor thing has been married at least 8 to 10 times I can't keep tract anymore anyways I feel so bad for her because every time she gets married they always I mean always throw it in her face and they think she cheats on them which is not true she would love them hold heartly, and to this day she still wants to be married and she pretty too.  It's sad that she will always have that pass. So! think about it twice.
Z6kjwFcHaa	Wow, that's great!  If I were you, i'd write my name on an index card or something, and your number.  When you see him, sneak it to him.  The ball will be in his court, but giving him your number quietly is probably going to be the most "secret" way to do so.  Good luck, let me know how it goes!|`|9dL6NCoiaa	I DONT FEEL LIKE READING ALL THAT|`|rox9qcBraa	If there is that much thought and work...NO|`|lSooXAQTaa	I agree with hottie... who is hot.|`|mcDq2zq1aa	hot hot. be like oh ha do you have a phone? your cute we should hang out|`|NVg06Egwaa	Just try to act cool around him. You're so lucky this happened! If you're talking to him be like "You guys raised your dog SO well! She/He's SO SWEET!!!" and you two have something in common...you're incredibly cute!"<br>  <br>  or something like that. Then be like....we should keep you updated about Bailey (?), I should call you....." hint for the number!|`|oQ7J9mNBaa	okay well it seems like he thinks you are pretty because you guys didn't have a real conversation. but its a good start. try talking to him next time you go there. talk to him about the dog or anything else. just get a conversation going.|`|gHmgBfwxaa	he might like you.<br>  <br>  answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220194459AAXojta">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|xBd96wvRaa	Yes he likes you. <br>  <br>  You have the best resources already at your finger tips and it is not this website and you can talk to them - YOUR PARENTS. So many kids on this board just can't talk to their parents about anything. <br>  <br>  Trust what they tell you. Leverage their wisdom.|`|CKr7pB4Saa	maybe a guys opinion could help,nervous are always the coolest when you get to know them, make stupid jokes make him laugh and he'll warm up|`|5488d65a5a874c153dc0083bb5fcb518aa	aww; that's so cute, well since your gonna see him again ask him for his number or his s.n; hope everything works out :)|`|e6Kyqb22aa	The person above me has a good idea. go with it|`|sWEtd9aUaa	Sounds like chemistry. He's definately into you. If you cant get him alone and you really like him you should tell your mom or sister. If you dont wanna do that then you should make some excuse like Can I use your bathroom or something. Try to use body language and signal him to somehow meet you there or something and slip him your number. If you can talk to him a little. The easiest thing to do though is talk to him even though your parents and sister are there. Just act normal. Then when you leave say hey it was really nice talking to you. We should keep in touch. Do you have a number or screename you could give me or something. It should work.<br>  <br>  Good Luck <br>  : )
RzBjyzEzaa	Try talking to one of your other good friends, maybe it will bring you closer.  You can also talk to a counselor at your school if you need professional help, it sounds like your parents aren't any help.
s8TTaIj2aa	Talk to her it sounds like you and her are very close she'll understand and will make more time for you. If they just started dating then they still have the butterflies for eachother everyday and that feels really good you would prob. do the same thing if you found a guy you really liked. I know it's hard but, since you care for her you need to understand too and be happy for her.|`|EHqsVwSWaa	None that will make you feel better, but just wait patiently. The newness of their relationship will wear off and then she'll stop spending so much time with him. She's your sister, you can't "lose" her. Definitely find a couple of other friends though. That way there will be someone else around for you to hang out with.|`|dLxi6AQCaa	stop being selfish if youre sister is happy you should be happy for her.|`|sEzrs3Uyaa	Thats just the way it goes.  When your best friend get a boyfriend you won't see or talk to her as much either...Be patient your turn will come.|`|BgZA7lvQaa	That's part of life.   You are not loosing her, she is your sister.  Boyfriends come and go but sisters are forever.  Find things to occupy yourself with.  Personally, I don't like to be the third wheel.  Cheer up, eventually you will have your own boyfriend and "hang out alot" too.
Eg1G2mvVaa	That he is about to start eroding your self confidence so that he can treat you however he likes and you will stay because you think you can do no better.  In time he hopes to have you uttering the ever popular 'but I love him' as a response to all bad behaviours.|`|C8Djjxqkaa	He's an arrogant tosser.|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	It means that he thinks he is better than you - and you could do no better and he could do no worse....dump him!|`|8umXlm1Jaa	whisper *(he's secretly gay)|`|kfNBVZH6aa	That you ain't good enough for him|`|ot05RAj8aa	he thinks he's perfect for ya.
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	If he thinks that way maybe you should stop cooking for him alltogether and have him make his own food or like you said go out and buy it.   do that and after a while he may stop his complaining <br>  MEN! (sigh) they will never learn *LOL*|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Thats when I would start putting that tasteless benifiber in everything I fed him!<br>  <br>  He will spend so much time in the bathroom..he will stop eating what you cook and get out of the house for his meals|`|AA11447210	This is something he should've known about you prior to marriage...and it shouldn't be an issue. He can cook himself, or go out, if he doesn't care for what you prepare (assuming you don't intentionally prepare things you know he doesn't like)|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Just tell him that a good husband would keep his mouth shut!  You're not forcing it down his throat.  Make him cook, if he doesn't like it.|`|xnhwmontaa	I would say fine then you cook and throw a pan at him lol no just jokin but im sure that thought has crossed your mind! either he cooks or eats fast food...or try taking a cooking class together.|`|KqdhWG1maa	Honey, just take a cooking class!|`|5lFppGAVaa	I had this problem I like salty food my husband doesn't so I tried using less salt then he said it was bland.  So I stopped cooking he started I'm not a picky eater so I didn't say anything even if I didn't like it now if I cook something and he doesn't like it he just eats and stays quite.  We eat out a lot!|`|r90FAtrjaa	Just like a kid, if he don't like what's on the table he can go hungry or fix it himself|`|UUrqECXIaa	Or cook it himself.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	"Hey, Pizza Hut delivers," would be my response.|`|AA10988719	AMEN sister, AMEN.  let him cook his own or starve
6UhpC09Haa	*applause* :)<br>  u did the right thing, nobody should be forced or pushed into something like that, congratulations, u did the absolute right thing, he just wanted u for sex and u dumped him<br>  good job :)|`|x6by5r23aa	YES!! YES YOU DID.<br>  <br>  because he shouldn't just try to force you to have sex with him, <br>  obviously he doesn't care about you, he probably just used to to get in your pants, by the sounds of it.|`|s8TTaIj2aa	Yes you did the right thing if he's pressuring you then he doesn't care how you feel and that's a good enough reason to dump him.|`|BPSC092daa	you did the right thing!|`|OTvymEWGaa	You did the right thing.  No one has the right to bully another person into doing something that they are not ready to do--especially sex.  You will find someone else who treats you like you should--a queen.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|YfkWXy11aa	Thank God you dumped him you should be really proud of yourself. That is a special gift you can only give once so be sure the recipient is worthy.|`|1gI1mq68aa	yes it was the right thing 2 do because he could've just been using u the whole time. Plus u don't want to have relationship only based on sex. Wait until ur ready and u know it's the right guy|`|wQcFLCXRaa	yea definitly<br>  if he cant wait hes not good enough for you|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Yes it was the right thing to do. Boys will do this and you cannot give in. Some of them will even dump you as soon as you do. Stand by your morals and do not do things that you are not ready for. Once they are done you cannot take them back. Good going girl.|`|xaiNyZSVaa	yeah you did the right thing u should be proud of yourself :)

43CAj5M8aa	Porn isn't just for guys. I have known many women who watch porn or surf porn on the internet. Some people think that if a woman watches porn she's either gay, or a slut, but truth is she's just trying to get a nut too.|`|HoplcvGHaa	It is a bit more taboo for women to watch porn, but many women still do, it just isn't considered socially acceptable for women to act the same as men in regards to porn, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bonerpwner.com" rel="nofollow">http://bonerpwner.com</a> will forever be my release, and I'm pretty sure they have everything a man or woman could want.|`|RIjjgex0aa	Hott!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|zHJufZTcaa	Make room on the couch for me....

9X09kM4oaa	He probably just thinks your pretty cool, keep getting to know him and start talking to him about places he likes to go to and hangs out at. Yall could hang out and see where things go :)|`|AA10189217	he's just not that into you if he's not asking you out!
naequcqlaa	I sure would be hurt if my husband did that to me after I'd gone to the trouble of getting them & mailing them.  That really took nerve to even tell you this.  Bad enuf he did it, but to tell you too?  Not a wise thing on his part.  Now I honestly wouldn't blame you if you don't feel like sending him anymore things.  Of course that would definitely hurt.  Tell him you're going to save your time & money the next time...Can't blame you for that..Best to you...:)|`|xnhwmontaa	yes very|`|mCM363I9aa	depends what it was, guys are not like us girls. They do not like to keep stuff for memory.<br>  <br>  Insensitive bastard!!!|`|KmC0K59taa	It depends what it was he threw away.  Was it just stuff you bought at Walmart that had no sentimental value?  Was it a cheap shirt or stuffed animal?  Men don't keep things like we do.  My husband throws away greeting cards I buy him.<br>  <br>  As long as he's not throwing away pictures of your or handwritten letters, don't be so upset.  In your eyes what you are sending him might be worthwhile, but you have no idea what it's like over there.  He might see the stuff as useless clutter.  Ask him what he wants.|`|WjxqhZG9aa	When they're deployed, whether they have a tuff box or not, they really have limited space.  If it's things like cards and things, don't take it so personally.  Talk to him about it.  If they're things that you want him to bring back... have him mail them home when he's finished using them.  That's what my husband did.  It kept him from having to tote all of it from place to place.|`|GgMMvHI8aa	He is living with boxes and bags I assume. Save all the extra STUFF for when he gits home. ASK what he really needs.  <br>   <br>  Stuff is just stuff. Do not be so upset by it. Send cookies or treats, or a fave candy.|`|zliT7ugSaa	I would definitely be hurt.
wgZVeLZPaa	I think it's ok to want your own space. I think we all need a break sometimes. I haven't taken a vacation with the gals in a while, but usually once a year we go off somewhere just for the weekend. <br>  <br>  In other words - it is completely normal.|`|gjAZeRyfaa	Personal space is always a good thing,|`|7cjqT33Baa	My husband and I are solid and best friends and part of the reason for that is both of us enjoy being by ourselves and having our own space.  We do our own things and have our own interests.  Makes having time together that much more fun.  If you fantasize about a weekend away, do it!!  What is holding you back?  Even just a day trip somewhere alone can clear your head and rejuvenate you.  A healthy couple realizes they don't have to be together 24/7 and can enjoy time by themselves.|`|p8yphpjYaa	YES YES YES BY ALL MEANS YES!!!!!!!!!!!! Everybody needs to have some time to just be alone, or to spend time with friends. I wholeheartedly endorse weekend trips, some with the husband, some alone, and some with your best friends!|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	It certainly is normal,You should have your own space.That's what keeps a marriage alive and interesting.If you spend all your time together,sometimes it gets a little hum drum,so some time away ,even a few hours by yourself to do what you want,works wonders,"Try It".|`|ghz5D5iLaa	There is nothing wrong with that and we all need our own time. If you can, plan one away with the girls or alone even and relax. My husband takes his hunting trip and I take my girls trip every year.|`|KEdmwuizaa	there's nothing wrong with spouses taking a break from each other once in awhile. if a couple spends every waking moment together, it's just a matter of time before one or the other starts feeling smothered. a weekend away will give you a chance to revive, refresh, and recharge your batteries. take the break!|`|XpjUe2Gtaa	Personally I think it is normal.  My husband and I work opposite schedules sometimes, actually like tonight, and I totally enjoy sitting here with my laptop, tv, glass of wine and relaxing- silently- by myself.  Doesn't mean I love him any less.  :)|`|goY0JHzlaa	Nothing wrong with alone time for anyone. You and your hubby need to make plans for a weekend get a way where you both can be apart for alone time. I think it's healthy to want to be by yourself once in a while.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	so's mine. He always wants me right there. I told him he makes me clusterphobic. That he's in my space I can't breathe. He laughs we laugh. I take off whenever possible and visit people I don't see often enough. But that weekend away sounds soooooooooogood!!|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	I am with you 100%!!  Right now at this very moment, lol.....my hubby just nodded and said oh yeah that's right.  I need down time just like you and everyone else.  When you find out where you are going let me know I will go with you, lol.....|`|oGo4ftFMaa	You're not a terrible wife, how dare her say that. Goodness. <br>  Everyone needs space to themselves, he even wants it sometimes too I bet.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	No, some alone time is important for everyone
JOoqy9doaa	First, I'm very sorry for your pain. Sara was obviously a very lucky woman to have you giving her care and comfort.<br>  <br>  It seems that you work at a facility where more than one team member is going to work with a patient in their time there, and I'm guessing this is why you're wondering how the others wouldn't be grieving the way you are?<br>  <br>  I would say that they probably didn't have the same connection with her as you did. I've heard how emotionally challenging hospice and other long term care for the disabled can be, and I feel like after reading your question, that you and Sara had something on a higher level that she probably didn't share with anyone else. When you and Sara both provided that understanding and laughter for eachother, there was a lot more vested for you and her than the other people had. But I wouldn't say that their lack of outward remorse is an indicator that they didn't care. Maybe you just cared more, because you and her were on a different level. Personally I'm glad that Sara had someone like you to be there with her because it sounds like you really cared for her. That can definitely be hard in a field of work such as your own. It's also scary when someone is institutionalized, because the people that love that person are worried that they won't get love and care.<br>  <br>  Grieve and remember, but also know that she is in a better place now. And I truely believe that your efforts won't go unnoticed. I hope this helps and that you feel better soon, and I know I didn't really offer any advice... so I would say that give it time, remember Sara for the good, know that she appreciated it, and that maybe this experience will help guide you to giving the best care for people in the future.|`|949517353a847c7e512b934758a0b451aa	you dont really know how they feel maybe they are us not showing it but think of it like this in the medical field everyone is human and has feelings but at the end of the day people rely on you to take care of them so you have to be focused but its ok to feel the way you feel|`|e2e2ccd6c15e732cbfc8b82485ecb4ebaa	It is normal to grieve. Don't take responsibility for her loss or you will burn out on your work, and you won't be there for others.|`|71h39Q5faa	First let me say that I am so very sorry for your loss.  I have a child with special needs and I have taught and worked in the same field for over twenty years.  You become attached and loving to the people in whose care you are in trusted.  <br>  <br>  If makes perfect sense that after all this time and attention you would be devastated by such a loss.  A person never has to speak to you to touch your heart and you their spirit.  From what you have said you helped to make each of the days that you spent with her better.<br>  <br>  The people you work with may have experienced these types of loss more than you have.  They may have learned that you have to be able to grieve for a moment and then move on.  There may be many more losses as you care for individuals in poor health.  Some of us have to shut down to enable us to continue functioning.  We appear cold and maybe even unfeeling to the outside but we hurt just like you do.<br>  <br>  The difference is that if we express our emotions the same way that you are we could not continue to provide the service and care.  It would eventually become overwhelming.<br>  <br>  Take all the time you need to grieve.  Then move on to the next person who needs your loving care and touch to make their life better.<br>  Take Care.
eNzOnSxNaa	It's jealousy, for sure.<br>  I used have a friend like that, and I'm going to be honest, if I was jealous of her, I would sometimes say things like that to her.<br>  I mean, I don't mean to, I would just get jealous. It's just the simple truth.<br>  And I know she did it to me, too.<br>  <br>  She just wants to hide her insecurities by putting someone else down. She wants to see you get hurt so she can think she is better.<br>  <br>  What I do, is when someone says something like that. Just ignore it. Just like laugh about it (if they say it sarcastically) and change the subject. But, don't make it too obvious. <br>  <br>  Because I promise, if she does that to you, and you don't act mean back to her, she'll feel guilty later, really really guilty.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	I think maybe she is jealous of you, when she finally feels like she is successful she makes sure she uses it whenever she can|`|0lewWYJdaa	she is prolly really competitive in everything.<br>  just tell her to cut it out.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You may want to talk to her if you really value the friendship.  If you don't do that, her habits will most likely to continue until you blow your temper up.  Communication is the key to the friendship.
WyjRm10jaa	Please Mr..<br>  Be Nice..<br>  i think he try to get a new hobby..<br>  he just want to be someone who can do some help in advice..<br>  that is what friends are for..<br>  i think..
AA10188961	omigosh don't sweat it.  As parents we know you're doing it.  No we don't want to catch you doing it, but we know you're human.  Just be glad it wasn't the other way around!|`|1vCxa7pSaa	hahaha.  You mean jacking off? Yeah, hon, you can spell it out, its not that big of a deal.  Lots of people do it, and I'm guessing you're a guy, guys do it like a million times a day, its no big deal.
FkunZ9q4aa	Tell him he has been making you uncomfortable and that if he doesn't stop you'll contact authorities.  Sometimes if you go to the police, they'll just visit him or call him to "scare" him into leaving you alone (simply showing up is enough to scare him!).  If that doesn't work, they'll do a restraining order.<br>  <br>  I had to get a restraining order on an ex boyfriend...it was the only way to get him to leave me alone.|`|haN9IMbCaa	Well call Chuck Norris, because he once watched 60 mins in 20 mins|`|UJKF7LKiaa	Tell the cops.|`|Awv7stIJaa	Omg, talk to someone about this and try and get this under control.

Get this creepy guy away from you, hon.|`|8x0oe23aaa	ok to much to read so i just skimmed threw it just kick him and stand on your tippy toes and Say NOW RUN AND STOP STALKING ME U FOOL.and then say lol just kidding and he will stop stalking u cause he thinks your a freak.|`|BgZA7lvQaa	How does he know where you live?  If you didn't give him your phone number, tell him that I need the winning lottery numbers for the Powerball.  But anyways,  for starters change your phone number.  Tell him you have a boyfriend and you're not interested in anyone else.  Do not make eye contact or even look at him.  Do not flirt or lead him on (if you are positive you do not want his attention).  If he still doesn't understand, tell your boyfriend to explain it to him and be firm about it.  Hopefully he will get it through his thick skull and not be creepy.  If you feel he continues being creepy, tell him you are going to report him and/or get a restraining order.  If he still continues report him and get a restraining order.|`|f9yORGumaa	Have you tried calling the cops? A couple visits from them might get through to him. Also, try telling him how ugly and disgusting he is and that everytime you see him you wanna blow chunks.<br>  <br>  Actually....Just blow the chunks on him. That would def. scare me away lol. j/k.|`|lZU0XzfTaa	ew.<br>  get your boyfriend to teach him a thing or two about space.<br>  worked for me!! hahah :-)|`|xK75gTz9aa	change your cellphone digits and give them to your closest friends|`|AA12067891	If this guy is making you uncomfortable, then tis isnt harmless stuff he is doing. Since you already comfronted him, and you said your boyfriend has confronted him, you should talk to your parents and your school counselor. Also keep track of all the stuff he is doing, save the texts, and write down all of these incidents. Also you should consider changing your number if that is possible...|`|0i4sNq2waa	Get a restraining order.|`|YKK0IBbhaa	You really need to tell a teacher, your parents, someone!<br>  <br>  I've been in the same situation but it was nothing compared to this! This guy is ridiculous and it seems like he could snap any moment. I don't want to scare you by saying that but it is true. He isn't backing off anytime soon it seems even though you and your boyfriend are trying to get him to.<br>  <br>  This actually makes me really upset for you. I mean... GYMNASTICS PRACTICE? This guy is out of control. I was in gymnastics and I know the exposed feeling.<br>  <br>  Just please tell someone.<br>  <br>  I'm really worried for you<br>  <br>  This guy is a real creeper and the way you are feeling is just horrible. I hate for you to be going through that. It's not right and that isn't how girls should have to feel!<br>  <br>  Please get someone to help.<br>  <br>  If you need someone to talk to you don't hesitate to message me or anything!<br>  <br>  I wish you the best!|`|emJ79qagaa	I am in the same situation, with 2 GUYS=0 your not alone|`|mfVmXheSaa	Why did you give him your number?<br>  I mean you only talked to him once, stupid on your part|`|srAP6Vzvaa	all guys in highschool are going to undress you with their eyes. let's get that clear. now for the stalker he needs your boyfriend or your brother to give him a Beat-Down. like a good beating. or else this will progress to Obsession and that leads to Violence !!!|`|5feebbaef078c57e8b297a04969b8f72aa	Oh man that sounds like a serious problem.

Be it your parents, school administrator, or the police, whatever level your comfortable going to. Because the fact is, some ppl are effing crazy and will act impulsively.|`|e7ee85fc90821767f2ddefaae94e5723aa	Damn dude, im sorry!<br>  I really think you should tell your problems to your counselor, I know this seems a little bit extreme, but I really think it's come to that. Build up solid proof, like it would be better if you did that. And maybe tell your parents to talk to his parents? And he is definitely a stalker man! So be cautious, but don't be paranoid. A restraining order might be too extreme, and he may go over board (god forbid). Just take care, talk to the authorities, and be careful.|`|khzxySMfaa	Creepy.<br>  Maybe he's playing some kind of joke? Don't worry. Search for him on Google and see if there's any bad stuff about him there. Tell the authorities if it's truly creeping you out.<br>  That would be very frightening. Make sure all the doors are locked, the windows are closed, blinds are closed, and get a guard dog!<br>  <br>  -Megan|`|m7xoRoMLaa	OMG good thing you didn't give him your number.<br>  i have the kind of same situation. i thought this boy was cute and he found out. then he started saying her wanted to have sex with me and saying all this nasty stuff which was a total turn off. then he asks me oh do you like me anymore and i say idk then he gets upset. then he starts talking shxt! and he called me like 23 times! non stop dude! he said im so sexy and stuff and wanted me to do nasty stuff!<br>  now he keeps looking at me all weird and tries to make me jealous b/che's [madddd) =|. it's like idc! but just get a restraining order or something. tell the school he's bothering you or something. but don't write back or anything. be real stank to him and roll your eyes when he looks at you. but no contact. no texing! avoid him as much as possible!<br>  <br>  BtW:GOOD LUCK! =] =\|`|U7SnmcxYaa	call THE COPS. xD|`|ClZWgDoxaa	I'm sorry  but that is just plain gross! and creepy wow...

I know the feeling.  <br>  Talk with the school counselor, dean, anyone of authority and have them to tell him to back off a bit.  You and your boyfriend have already tried so there is really no other option.  His behavior is inappropriate and he needs to know it!|`|8aec0546f94fdaf776a271287b6cf78baa	When I started reading this I just thought 'oh poor guy, he's young, with raging hormones and feelings, and has fallen in love!'<br>  <br>  As I read on tho', I started to get more worried. He has stepped beyond 'normal' boundaries here now, and his behaviour can definately be classed as stalking. He may not be aware of how much he is distressing you. He has lost touch with reality, and possibly believes in his mixed up head that you and he are meant to be. If nothing is done, his behaviour will very likely get worse. I think he is showing signs of being very ill indeed.<br>  <br>  So.......... what to do? You must tell someone in authority at your college at once. Do not leave this situation another day. Is there a student welfare officer you can go to? A sympathetic teacher? Can your parents come to the school with you and ask that something is done to counsel and assess this lad before he does something even more serious? If he isn't warned that his behaviour has stepped over boundaries, then he could end up with psychiatric disorders, and you could end up in danger. DO SOMETHING NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|A7XL1eH6aa	LOL have your BF kick his ***...LOL just kidding.  Change your number and IGNORE him at ALL costs.  Or tell your dean or principal.|`|AA12021223	Just tell him off.lol<br>  <br>  There's a guy like that in my school, but no one likes him so he can't get mine or anyone else phone number.|`|IMjfnKhjaa	my good, you beatiful!!!!!!  sou brazileiro, estou dando apenas uma olhada por aqui!!! bjos!|`|SQMeVsD3aa	restraining order .|`|dLxi6AQCaa	LOL thats hilarious.   I wouldnt suggest you do anything violent to him because hes really weird and you never know how he can react(he could go berserk and kill you and your family).  I dont know if youve talked to him about it but maybe he doesnt see how weird he is being.  Just have a one on one genuine talk with him in a public area(you never know how he can react if you two were alone he could get mad and rape you) and tell him that youre not interested and that hes scaring you.  If he is a decent human being and realizes how uncomfortable he is making you, he'll respect your wishes.|`|VELbTFrfaa	omggg thats totally creepy! tell him to stay the fxck away from you! maybe you could even get a no contact contract or whatever theyre called where they have to stay like 100 yards away from you or whatever it is|`|e44b5ee6cee3f3f6ca0a4ca6d4ecfba3aa	You need to tell your mom/dad/trusted adult. <br>  <br>   I've heard horror stories of a guy becoming obsessed with a girl and he'll make up an imaginary relationship with the girl in his mind and then when she's like, "Dude, I have a boyfriend, this needs to stop.." he'll be like, "Well, if I can't have you..nobody can."   <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to scare you, and this is probably harmless and won't go anywhere but I'd tell him via text that he needs to stop texting you and leave you alone or you will go to the cops.  Make this very clear and make it so that he could not mix the message up in any way.  If it continues, keep copies of everything and tell your parents.  <br>  <br>  I hope everything gets better.  Always make sure to stay with your boyfriend or trusted friend until this clears up.|`|PqnM781yaa	That's really scary...<br>  you should try confronting with a trusted adult.<br>  Good Luck with him!|`|BfhdkauJaa	TEll cops, tell him to **** off, tell parents is tha best|`|nTATyynJaa	Whaaat the heeeckkkk that IS creepy. <br>  <br>  I have never dealt with this kind of situation. But I'm curious to know, how does he know where you live, or where your gymnastics classes are...??  Make sure you are doing all you can on the internet to protect yourself and your identity. Ex. Take your pic off yahoo answers. Make sure your profile on facebook is set so only your friends can see. Delete him off facebook and msn, CHANGE your phone number! <br>  <br>  Assuming you've already done the above, you need to speak up and tell a parent or teacher at school. You already feel emotionally and psychologically abused by this person, and you have ALREADY told him to stop and it has not stopped. Now you tell someone else. You've done all you can do. There's no need to feel guilty about anything. <br>  <br>  I sincerely hope this all works out for because its clearly causing unecessary stress that you don't need. <br>  <br>  Goodluck.|`|E3UX1SzWaa	lol well the way you look im not surprised. just rack him in the balls.|`|t6zrwGNraa	oh my goodness. he really needs some help. go tell a trusted adult immediatly. it IS very creepy how he's following you. tell your parents, principal, and guidance counselor. tell them not only is he harrasing you at school, but he is following you home and to possibly have the police involved. yes, this really is a criminal case- he has no right to stalk you like this! tell him to back off or your taking serious action. he sounds like someone who could rape a girl. get far, far, away from him. tell an adult with authority NOW!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220182800AAeJ4h9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  please help me?|`|gqJoae2Uaa	change your name number hair color and move to cuba.
mC2dRyuMaa	Well im not the best person to answer your question because ive only been with one guy but for two years now but what ive learned from my mistakes is u shouldnt go all crazy to figure out does he like u? what to do or say when hes around? all that i can really tell u is honestly just go up to him and ask him if he does. If he does then duh thats easy go out with him, but sadly if he doesnt **** him lol theres a bunch of guys out there and if he cant see what a great person u are then he aint worth ****. so gd luck =D|`|Qu6jpbNuaa	it could go one of two ways.<br>  <br>  either he likes you but he's really shy and doesn't think that you like him too .. or he doesn't like you and just thinks of you as a really good friend.<br>  <br>  if you like him you should flirt back. like give him a nickname or sumthing|`|569ea731f9e16970ab9b111b9d7b5f6baa	1. weirdd<br>  2. he makes fun of you? ouch <br>  3. who cares?<br>  4. making fun of you again?<br>  5. okay<br>  6. that means nothing<br>  7. also means nothing<br>  8. he makes fun of you a lot<br>  9. i don't understand..<br>  <br>  no he doesnt stop being a creep|`|RKfqVRhTaa	Dude!<br>  He totally likes you.<br>  Wow.<br>  Tease him, flirt with him.<br>  Then when you're comfortable enough, tell him you like him or ask him out|`|JeUhOli4aa	DEFINITELY LIKES YOU!!! :)<br>  There's no way he doesn't. He has to like you. <br>  Just joke around with him too and laugh at all his jokes, even if they aren't funny.|`|B4SF8sPraa	i dont know if he likes you he might just be an *** face|`|HCzZClfvaa	Hey ya,<br>  To me it sounds like he likes you too. Even if i don't know what MASH is?...<br>  I think you could perhaps flirt more? Or if you're bold tell him straight out how you feel. Hopefully he will say he likes you back.<br>  Hope everything works out. Good Luck!!!|`|P8O3dmmXaa	he obviously has some kind of interest in you. mabe you should just try flirting eith him and withoutout giving it off let him know u r interested and he will maybe try making a move or asking u something sooner or later. just talk to him in a flirty way, such as complimenting him, laghing at his joke, eye contact, in a big group make him center to your attention and so on.....good luck!!!|`|nritHWz9aa	He does but like 7 out of ten.|`|KGwpztjoaa	Probably just as a friend|`|Rih79dHNaa	it sure  does sound like he likes you<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  go for it|`|WQhV4Amgaa	well sherlock holmes would definately hate this case. (no offense but it's kind of obvious) the only way to find out is to ask him and make him know you're serious about him. if he thinks you're a joke he'll treat you like one.if you like him tell him! flirt buy him flowers or something like that. don't let him slip if you like him. love only happens once in a lifetime. if you let it slip you will be sad,mean,and heartless.|`|D9QLM6sRaa	Yes he likes you :), he can do that with any other girl but he choosed YOU.<br>  Just reply him back and be nice to him, send to him messages and tell him you remind me of....like what he is doing. Good luck :).|`|gaWZ79gNaa	he likes you.<br>  <br>  boys are weird and make fun of girls because they have a communication issue, it doesnt get any better either the older they get!!<br>  <br>  go to google :does he like me" and it will give you scenarios of when to know a boy likes you! :)|`|45cHcSY4aa	i need two points to ask a question.|`|ANDlaDYgaa	hmmm....i dont think he likes you i just think you guys are really good friends and like to joke around alot<br>  sorry|`|OKFE62fWaa	Hard to say.... but he probably does like u, so go for the long shot if you dare, tell him u like him. If you can't then just wait, if he likes you he'll tell you sooner or later...
MLmf1kU9aa	I'm in the same situation. Kind of. Sort of.<br>  <br>  First of all, be his friend first and foremost. You can't date him if you don't like him as both a crush and your friend. He'll get boring reeeeaaaal fast.<br>  <br>  Secondly, guys our age flirt alot with anything that moves and seems to respond. However, if you're sure he likes you, flirt back. How?<br>  <br>  Initiate banter. Get into quick little faux-arguments with him, keep his attention. If he starts to give you a nickname or keeps one doing one set of jokes that he knows will get a reaction from you, he's definitely interested. Lightly slap him as well. Not hard, just initiate contact. <br>  <br>  Also, if you guys have a common interest, talk about that as well. Use that as a starting base to learn more info about him, then ask him about his interests and such.<br>  <br>  After awhile, if you really like him and he responds well, ask him out. :)|`|7eYMkngZaa	say hey and strike up a random conversation <br>  such as "I like your shirt" or "did you see so-and so do this"<br>  <br>  and smile and look into his eyes, guys always dig that.|`|7PqwM6QXaa	hehe :)<br>  lol, try to have more contact with him, but not too much. If he teases you, hit him back, I once did that with a guy i liked and he ended up slapping my face (not really hard, like a playful one), and i slapped him back and we had like, a big playful pointless fight lol. Say hi to him when he will least exepect him, and when you say bye, hug him.

I prefer hiding it and I'm not allowed to date anyway so there's no point in impressing him.

HKkbqlIuaa	It's beyond weird. If your neice has bruises on her butt, he is hitting her too hard. Unless she bruises REALLY easily or is anemic, she shouldn't bruise from a normal, acceptable spanking. I do think his behavior is a little "off," but the bruises would concern me more than anything. I hope you get this taken care of as soon as possible.|`|mG8kWrTXaa	I don't think you're crazy- this guy sounds a bit weird. I wouldn't go to his house unless someone else is there. You said about your niece, is it your sister's child, and is this guy your sister's partner?<br>  What does the baby's mother think, she must've seen the bruises too?<br>  If you think the child is being abused, you should report it to someone.|`|wlgRsZpfaa	You should definitely put this to your aunt's attention and try and protect your niece. This man seems pretty strange, so try to ignore and stay away from him the best you can. I know it is hard for you to be around this weirdo, but you have to protect the little one.|`|rlvrgwWvaa	No, this is not weird. The bruises are not tmi, it's actually vital to know about them. He may be abusing her physically or sexually. If you think there might be a problem then I would suggest telling someone you trust other than your parents. Like a teacher or even the police if you feel it is right.|`|pHbVh9kIaa	oh yah, it's kinda creepy, but maybe it is not him, ask him wat is wrong wit u?<br>  maybe he doesn't like his wife or maybe the wife acts good but beats up ur neice! talking will solve ur problems and did u tell ur parents bout the bruises????or maybe he just has problemes!|`|c96d809951ae4f99effc004865caeff8aa	You are not crazy.<br>  <br>  How do you go about telling your parents?<br>  Don't just go in and start saying that he's a total creep because of his poor dental hygiene.  Tell them that he follows you everywhere, and that he touches you!!<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, report it to child protective services.<br>  Tell them that this man has touched you, scared your niece and that you are afraid of your nieces (and ur own) safety.<br>  <br>  He might be capable of rape.<br>  so don't wait till it's too late.|`|PbFL8jh2aa	I think this is weird too. Show someone the bruises and have a sit-down with your mother and tell her that he is really bothering you. Ask her to respect you and explain to her that you are genuinely scared. Admit that even if it does seem a bit silly (to her), ask her to help you to avoid him. Be sure to thank her if she does, and ACT MATURE. You are asking for her to respect you.<br>  <br>  Answer mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220191902AAR6rW8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|UvQcCL8Haa	Show someone the bruises! That is extremely important information. Save your niece before anything happens to her. Getting raped will scar her for life.

Best of luck.|`|KXuNNj11aa	Sounds very weird to me also.  I would definitely be keeping an eye on your niece.  He sounds like a real creeper.  I am surprised that your mom isn't a little more concerned.  Maybe next time you go you can ask your mom to please watch closely and see if she notices anything unusual.  Too odd for me!!!|`|eLUUA4ljaa	how old is your neice anyways? serios question i need to know<br>  cuz if she is too young she is super endangered

Likst1Mxaa	No, your teachers wouldn't be annoyed.<br>  <br>  School counsellors are ther to hear from kids who have been or are being abused. There's a number of kids in your school who see the counsellor (or other teachers) for the same issue. The school counsellor will have to tell DOCS about it, that if there job.<br>  <br>  Re 'crossing the line', there is a thing which your friend should have been told about. If a teacher finds out that your friend is being abused, is suicidal or is acting violent, they have to tell someone else about it who can help them. <br>  <br>  Teachers and counsellors are there to help kids :)

That makes you free from any stupid idea he′d ever have about hating you...<br>  Whatever he said, F*CK IT!!! You′re only the daugther, NOTHING ELSE.

Im so sorry about your loss because i could never imagine loosing a parent. Your going to be okay and those dreams are nightmares, there the farthest thing away from ever being true.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	It was just a dream Sweety. Maybe you feel some guilt about your dad dieing and this dream was a result of some of the things you had on your mind.  We dream about things we are thinking about before we go to sleep or what has been on our minds alot of times.  You need to find someone you trust and talk to them honestly about your feelings.  You may need to talk to someone who deals with this kind of problems.  You were so young when he died and you may have some issues that you need to deal with but it was not your fault.  It was his time to go and nothing could change that.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	Honey, what you are feeling is a complete loss about you dad, and that is completely understandable. I think for what ever reason you are feeling guilty for what I'm not sure it was not your fault..please talk to your mom or an adult that you trust for help.<br>  My thought s and prayers are with you.|`|Rb3MmzKlaa	It was his own fault that he got behing the wheel of a car when he was drunk.  It wasn't your fault AT ALL!  Unfortunately, when parents get divorced or one dies in an accident, sometimes the subconcience of the kid will kick in and say that it was their fault something bad happened.  I don't know the exact term for it but what it is basically is misplaced guilt syndrome (again not the right name; just the definition of what it is).  Bottom line; your father loved you... your dream means nothing in real life and you are not and never were at fault.|`|5TN6AcDBaa	I'm very sorry about your loss. If he was drunk, then he didn't know what he was saying. He might've felt that he didn't want to hurt you, so he took his life to refrain from hurting you. You probably dreaming about him because you miss him, so, if he was buried, you might try going to his grave and just talking to him for a while, and getting some emotional baggage of your chest. Once again, I'm sorry for your loss.|`|CvESLNnkaa	Often people of all ages deal with guilt when love ones die even if you have nothing to do with it.  You could subconsciously think that you some how caused the accident and to punish your self you make him hate you.  This is only speculation though, you didn't' cause the crash and dreams some times are cruel.  If it is really bothering you go to your school councilor about it they may be able to help or talk to your mom.|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	Honey, that was just a dream - nothing more.  You share no responsibility in what happened to your Dad.  I am sure it was just an accident.  Please try and talk to some type of counselor if you feel you need to...Good luck and have a good life.  Your Dad would want you to, and I am sure he loved you very much.|`|en74VE9uaa	thats a terrible dream, but its just a dream.is it possible you have thought of this scenario in the past? when you sleep your brain is in its maintenance stage so it projects some memories or thoughts. this obviously wasnt a memory, so it is a subconcious thought. <br>  <br>  i would  just forget about it and live on.|`|6UhpC09Haa	dreams are pretty stupid<br>  except mine, mine come true like all the time in one way or another, but thats very rare for other people<br>  so it means nothing, u just in a way wanna think thats its ur fault, its a weird mind thing, i cant really explain, but i know what it is, haha, sorry<br>  hope i helped :)|`|sPRaPt6Maa	Dreams dont always have a meaning. Talk to a psychologist maybe.|`|AA12398373	OK sweetheart. It's just a natural fact that when something terrible like your dad's death happens the child (you) finds a way to take on the blame for herself.<br>  <br>  So here's the truth.<br>  Your dad's death was never your fault. You didn't cause it. You had no influence over your dad's decision to drink and then get behind the wheel of a car. He was drunk, and he wasn't thinking clearly.<br>  This tragedy had nothing to do with you. Only the terrible loss in the aftermath.<br>  <br>  This dream is your way to blame yourself (see 1st paragraph). You aren't being fair to yourself. You don't deserve this.<br>  <br>  I highly, highly recommend that you write a letter to your dad. Tell him how you feel about his drinking, how he drove drunk, and how you feel about his dying and not being there for you in the way you so richly deserve.<br>  I know it sounds ridiculous writing a letter to someone who couldn't possibly read it. But you can go to his grave and read it to him.<br>  <br>  You see, I think you are pretty angry about not having your dad around like he should be, and who can blame you? The problem is, you have directed your anger at the wrong person. Instead of putting the blame on him (where it should be) you have put the blame on yourself.<br>  <br>  So write the letter. Use words that describe your true feelings like mad, sad, angry, or whatever you think applies. Tell your dad how HIS DEATH has screwed with your life. Tell him how you feel about his decision to drive drunk, and why you think he must have hated his life, and then tell him all the reasons why he should have LOVED it.<br>  This letter can be just between you and him, so you can say ANYTHING YOU WANT in it. <br>  Once you are done you can put the letter in a drawer, burn it, flush it down the toilet, or as I suggested, take it to his grave and read it out loud so he can hear it.<br>  Whatever you do with the letter once it has been written isn't nearly as important as the writing of it.<br>  <br>  If you feel you have to share it with someone else like a friend, your mom, or a sibbling, that's OK too. Just as long as you write down your true feelings about what happened with your dad, and the way you feel today because he is no longer in your life.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for your loss, and I hope that I have helped you a little in dealing with it. :-)|`|yKqOi9yraa	Sweetheart, first and foremost I am so sorry about your loss. Losing a parent is not something you ever really get over. As far as your dream, it sounds like you are beating yourself up over your Dad's death and somehow blaming yourself for it. You should not be doing that. Growing up with an alcoholic father myself, i understand your pain. My father almost killed me when I was 4 yrs old, he was driving drunk and told me to not wear my seatbelt and we got into a bad accident. I still have a scar over my right eye from hitting the dashboard. <br>  You need to realize that your father was the one who decided to drink then drive. You are not resbonsible for what happened to him, HE is. As i said before, it sounds like you are subconciously blaming yourself and in the nicest, most honest way possible I am going to suggest that you contact a therapist or counselor. I have been through about 12 in my life regarding my father and my parents subsequent divorce. Therapy can really help, just having someone to talk to and get all your feelings out without being judged or told that the way you feel is wrong. <br>  YOU ARE NOT TO BLAME FOR YOUR FATHERS ACTIONS.|`|B98LD8Ruaa	PLEASE don't think this is your dad coming to you....your dad is in a beautiful place full of love and grace and this would not be the message he would send you.  Our minds are crazy in a dream state.....and there are many things that can contribute to bad dreams.  Food, no rest, stress and movie that we watched before going to bed.....the car accident was a tragic mistake caused by his own actions and I am sure that if he could have a re-do knowing the emptiness he has caused you that he would have put down the bottle all together.  One day you will be together and this dream will not even exist as a memory.  Love your family, learn from your dad's mistake and be the BEST you, that you can be.  Take care.|`|KXuNNj11aa	Sorry to hear about your dad, what a terrible thing to have to deal with at such a young age.  I am sure the dream was just a dream.  They can be so realistic and it is sometimes hard to decipher the meaning behind them.  Don't worry, I am sure he loved you and you are at a sensitive age when subconsciously his death probably weighs on your mind.  Keep smiling!|`|E3UX1SzWaa	i dont think it means anything.  i think you were just thinking about your father and your brain just dreamed about it.  unfortunately it was a bad dream.  don't let it mess with you. im really sure he loved you.|`|fajdCVupaa	Honey dont listen to think of the horrible dream ever again. Its just the devil trying to mess with your mind. Your dad loved your very much and he will forever.|`|Xk22uO27aa	Just a dream, maybe you feel great gult of something, but I think it was just something, you cant controle your dreams.|`|OheLX0Ibaa	I feel really srry for u if ur dad died wen u were 6! just forget about the dream cuz ur father really did love u! all fathers do even wen they say they dont!|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	sometimes ur mind gets confused, i'm sure ur dad loved, u, its not ur fault he died. dont think too much about it, and u'll stop having dreams on this|`|70MRFokCaa	No wait it isnt your fault itsjust u think its your fault its your concence<br>  telling yo this<br>  bacially u havnt knownyour dad much so you feel like putting the blame on yourself and you feel sad about it then yur brain makes a movie out of it and that beacomes your dream lol<br>  hope i get 10 points for helping :)
y4zYkceEaa	It's totally fine to feel that way. You have a heart, I don't see a lot of people like you nowadays. It's sweet! Don't listen to those jerks calling you all those bad things, they're just insecure with themselves. Your the kind of guy a lot of girls would like to have around.

It seems you are a bit more mature than most 14 year olds. In the since that you are thinking outside the box, in that you are coming to understand real world issues. Law Enforcement is a good field to go in to. Perhaps, Police Officer is not the best though, unless you were to specialize in a victims unit program. Caseworker, Sociology, are two suggestions that you may be interested in. More power to you, I wish you well. Keep thinking about others. :)|`|n336SjRiaa	I'm glad you feel like this. if there were more people like you in this world, it would be a great place to be. don't listen to the wannabe macho mens at your school. as far as I know, your wanting to be in the law enforcement is a great idea if you are really passionate about it. girls are going to be lucky to have someone like you. it is a fact men are more physically stronger than women and it sucks how some take the advantage of that.|`|CboCF6Kuaa	its all right to feel like that. just imagine this<br>  pretend a group of gangsters gang up on you because they want to do something with this one girl you know.

You should stand up for yourself have some pride! :) <br>  <br>  <br>  ~alli|`|po85q148aa	The world needs more kind hearted people like yourself.  Don't pay attention to what the guys at school say.  Just shake it off and keep it movin.  You'll make a great husband some day and if you want to be in Law Enforcement one day, I say go for it!|`|BfQGEnaMaa	You could pray for others, that's what I do. You could donate money to help. Say to an organization like orphan's promise. But no you are not wrong in being sad for others.

Be proud of it and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. As cliche as that is, it's the honest truth.<br>  <br>  You're 14, but you've already got amazing clarity and insight and it's refreshing to see someone who can honestly tell the good from the bad. I, personally, am 16 and (speaking as a girl) I'd be amazed to find someone with as much integrity as you.<br>  <br>  People will always say really stupid sh*t to you. All I can tell you is that as long as you hold on to your beliefs, you'll do just fine. It's sad and disheartening to think that 14-year old guys are saying it's okay for girls to be treated the way they are...:/<br>  <br>  I think you need to step away from them and disengage. Find some new people to hang around. The guys you surround yourself with have either, sadly, bought into how people are told to treat women or just too ashamed to speak up and agree with what you're saying. It's not healthy and they're only going to hamper you into getting into your career of choice. Break away from them and find yourself new friends. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best in you choice of career. You seem to be a good match for it. :)|`|vcMqU3zsaa	I am a 14 year old girl<br>  Don't worry you are not gay, guys only say that because you are against something that is wrong.<br>  <br>  everyone at my schools thinks im a guy<br>  im not a guy i love guys<br>  just go for what right<br>  you know what is right<br>  <br>  those other guys that don't care are going to be the ones out in the world raping those children and getting teenage girls pregnant. <br>  those are also the guys that have experience cheating on their own girlfriend. <br>  it just shows that they are a man whore and that all they want is the fun out of the girls.<br>  all they want is to lick, suck, and **** their pussy and they want the boobs. <br>  <br>  do not let them get to you<br>  you can believe in what ever you want

Anyone that would do that is a douche bag though.|`|ZbcK1r2paa	Not necessarily he might just be curious I ask that question just to get a conversation going, but yes there is a chance that he does like you so just asking the guy couldn't hurt.|`|AjBpAPpdaa	It means hes interested ;).|`|7BZYUHpjaa	it means he's interested in you|`|1ceywpfVaa	I'd say yes ;)  No one goes right up to a girl just to say Do you have a bf?|`|wdnbwViFaa	that means he likes you and/or is interested in you :)|`|C8Djjxqkaa	No, men often conduct surveys on many aspects of society as a hobby.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|7y3OA7LQaa	you just be yourself and ask however you feel is appropriate. if you use some line that someone else made up you arent being yourself and that is set up for disaster.
467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	yes you did the right thing.<br>  your mom and sister are wrong for that.<br>  <br>  it would be just horrible to lead that boy on.<br>  <br>  but i advise you don't get into it with this Bryce boy just yet.<br>  give it a little bit of time.<br>  <br>  or rumors will start about you...<br>  getting around.
48e1c61ac4e4edff368144a0ab70aa61aa	I'd say to stay away from A.  You don't want any misunderstanding with your friends.  Remember, guys come and go, your friends will always be there!<br>  I don't know what E is trying to do.  He may be trying to show you how wanted he is and trying to impress you and make you want him as well.  But if you guys did hook up, I can't promise he wont exercise the same behavior with other girls in other classes.  So if you are okay with him flirting with other girls while he is with you, that is up to you.<br>  H seems to be really into you... I'd go for him.  But in order to get him to speak to you again, just keep trying to talk to him.  Don't talk to him about what happened or anything, just bring up small subject at each time and be friendly.  He will get over it in time.|`|8SEVTKz5aa	thats not alot, i enjoy reading ppls problems ;] (i needa get a life lmao XD)<br>  <br>  it seems like u have 3 great guys and its up to u who u should go out w.<br>  i & no one else can tell u what to do n who to go out w. since its whatever ur heart wants <br>  whatever u decide, good luck! =D|`|2NoxxqXkaa	^ ^ ^ ^ ^ I KNOW. SERIOUSLY. You will know when a guy likes you.... and you will know when a guy dosent like you.|`|AA10975334	Okay, so you have two guys that like you. Good, enjoy have fun, you don't need anything steady right now. Just enjoy your life as it is, who cares what others think about what goes on in your life that is your business. <br>  <br>  As far as the one that doesn't talk to you, well, let it be. we win some we lose some|`|W77MV7TWaa	wow. you seem like a classic dumb blonde. did you seriously just say you were in the "it" group? and you said "idk" like sixteen times.|`|NeTLzyE4aa	For 'H' you should go up to him and tell him that you were jus kiddin about not liking anyone because you were to shy to admit that you did and from there he probaly would ask you out or sumthin because he likes you.<br>  <br>  For 'E' do not get caught up with him he is a player and is trying to make you one of his hoes. He doesnt like you he's messing with your head. You can stay friends with him and tells him in nice ways that you love him as a friend. I've been in that situtation before.<br>  <br>  For 'A' he totally likes you. But if he went out with your friend thats a bad idea. Its Agaisnt girl code even if they are over eachother thats just taking your good friends sloppy second and even if you guys did go out your friend would act like she doesnt care but she really does. you should just continue to flirt with him but nothing more. A little flirting never hurts anyone, its` practice.<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall I think you should go out with 'H' he seems like the best choice for you and he already likes you so there is no curiousity. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped lots =)
HynN4MM1aa	WOW! WE should get together!!!|`|7cjqT33Baa	You need to make him an appointment at the doctor and see what is causing that.  It's not normal to be that sleepy and lazy, especially at your age.  He could have a chemical or hormonal imbalance and blood work can determine that.<br>  Also, if you are lazy all the time, it's hard to feel energetic.  When my husband is like that, I insist we get up an go somewhere and then he gets his energy going.  People need activity, we weren't meant to be lazy and inactive.  I feel for you because that would be really hard to have energy and be around your husband who sounds like a drain.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	You need to buy him some vitamins with iron it's not normal for a 24 year old to be sleeping all the time. Don't take it out on him until you go to see a doctor and he rules everything out. If nothing is wrong then you can hit him in the head and tell him to get off his *** and take you out.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	I think you need to get him to the doctors adn go into the room with him and help explain what's going on with him|`|AjjKETIxaa	How is your SEX life?
CDzStUPUaa	Relax; you shouldn't worry over this.  You just haven't met someone who's right for<br>   you yet.   Date around, but just to have fun.  One of these dates will turn out to be<br>   'the ONE' .... be  patient, it will happen! :)|`|dD5GJgrHaa	hot but boring simple...
tqqhXMagaa	I think that it is up to the parent on what to do. <br>  And I think in certain circumstances it is okay.<br>  i.e.- you were raped and got pregnant.|`|qQtYJZKWaa	I believe that, in the situation of rape or birth defects concerning the baby, abortion is not a good thing but a necessary thing (if it be the mother's wish). However, if it is used as a means of birth control, I believe that abortion is not condonable at all. If you want more of my opinion, u can email me. <br>  Hope it helps.|`|tudgm0S1aa	i am pro choice, however, i dont think abortion is a form of birth control, women need to make the best choices for them selfs, an unplanned pregancey can change everything. so make a choice based on facts rather then emotions. and there are always other options to consider.. good luck|`|M0HXWfQPaa	ABORTION IS MURDER!<br>  f**k "choice" !!!<br>  CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE SEX IF YOU CAN'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS.<br>  <br>  ****im aware of rape/incest = i understand the difficulties &with that ... is all it should ever be allowed. the a**hole that rapes a woman should be castrated!|`|2XXI8GmQaa	i think your body your choice. why bring a kid into this world to suffer? if your not ready or able to care for them the way they deserve to be cared for. a child deserves the world and all the love from his mother and father.|`|bR1jDMDRaa	I think it's wrong, however if it's a lot more than one, or there is something wrong with the child and the women can't handle it, then they should go through with it.|`|OTvymEWGaa	abortion should be kept private.  a decision made by a woman and her doctor with no one judging her.|`|aXHAaLNqaa	I think it's wrong. It's murder!|`|45UTKuamaa	If there is a problem that is going to kill the mother yes no problems why destroy a childs life before it starts|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I am pro choice. I don't believe I have a right to tell you what to do if I believe in it or not.|`|aNulrZNoaa	I believe most people do not know what they are talking about when it comes to this topic.  It is NOT a safe procedure to have by any means because abortion clinics are less regulated by the government than tattoo shops.  When people say that women should have a right to chose for thier own health they are ignorant and blind to the fact that it is more harmful than good - both physically and emotionally.  The only reason it's still legal is because it is an Extremely lucrative business for the government as well as the abortion "Dr"s.|`|69qn7muFaa	Actually, I'm in the middle.<br>  I'm not fully against it and I'm not fully for it either.<br>  If a girl is old enough to be able to carry her baby, then I'm against abortion for that.<br>  But if a girl made her own mistake and she's way too young to be able to have a child, then of course i'm going for abortion.<br>  It just depends on the situation..<br>  But for the most part, It is murder. It's like killing your own born baby.|`|YKCIubvKaa	Sometimes there is a woman who is raped and forced with this. Abortion or give birth. THAT should be their decision unmoved from people claiming this is MURDER. Its up to the psychological ability of the parent to cope and be able to live with that growing inside them. Some women can go through with it and give the baby to adoption but in no way should we force the woman who already went through so much to give birth to a child she doesn't want. For all you know saying that she can't she may do something more drastic. I would rather let her abort safely than put herself through more.<br>  Also thier are mothers face with a choice. You or the baby. Those mothers need to make that decision on their own. If you think about it either way is murder. To choose the baby you will die and leave this child without a mother. To choose yourself you are losing the baby. It's a tough and ugly decision that they should have the freedom of choosing.<br>  <br>  These are the only ones I care for. Pregnant teens who made poor choices need to learn. Although this child may hurt and suffer they WILL grow and hopefully do better than their mother. And lets be honest.. if a teen is able to abort so easily they do not think fully of what they are doing. They do not realize what they just did and they will do it again. I will congratulate all teens who may have learned their lesson but there is a large number who won't. And this lesson isn't just for teens...|`|jkL4K7otaa	if your gonna be stupid enough to have sex and unproteced sex at that then you better be ready for the consequences .....abortions should be illegall!!!!!!!!!1
8FbOtXAXaa	He likes you!!! He is trying to get your attention and unfortunately he is going about it the wrong way. Some guys don't know how to flirt very well and like this guy, he is annoying you more than anything and he is coming off as a jerk by making rude comments but seriously, the rude comments is his way of flirting with you. Sounds weird I know! And the fact that he is always trying to get your attention when you are talking to other guys proves that he wants that attention. He needs to go about this in a different way and I don't know if you like him or not but if you do, then I suggest that maybe you pull him aside sometime and let him know that if he likes you, then maybe stop saying silly things to you that you find a little hurtful. Hope you find this helpful!
5PBRR4NVaa	Threaten to call Dr. Phil.|`|bL9APqogaa	wow! That sounds bad! It must be so hard not to be able to talk to your mom! I am sorry about your cat dying. I know how it feels to have a pet die! <br>  One thing that you can do for your mom to tell her that you love her is doing something nice for her. like washing the supper dishes. Or something like buying her a rose. or something that she likes. Actions are much better than words. I find doing something proves my point more. And you could maybe do something or buy something for your dad too because he is part of the situation. Just to show him that you do care about him. It can be something small but something that they will notice. <br>  I hope that helps you! I hope that you can work this thing out with your parents! <br>  Blessings!|`|9baf99a809533cf33525302b1d6116afaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your cat and your family.  It definitely sounds like your mother is avoiding you.  Is there anything the two of you can do together that would bring her out of whatever shell she's crawled into?  Maybe going to the grocery or out for a walk or something?  It's not fair for them to say not to feel sad when a cat you had for eight years passed away.  Or to not take some responsibility into talking to her husband and letting him know he can't call you names (something we get told before the 1st grade!).  I hope you find some way of getting her to open up and just put her arm around you and talk.|`|KXuNNj11aa	I feel for you.  You sound like a sweet girl and very understanding. It is such a difficult age for you.  I don't know if you have tried to maybe write you mom a note.  I know sometimes if there is no confrontation and reading a heartfelt letter sometimes hits home.  I hope your mom realizes that you will be grown up before she knows it and each day should be special, because you never know when things may change. Sorry to hear about you cat, losing animals is so hard, but try to remember the good times and eventually the healing will happen gradually day by day.  Good Luck to YOU!|`|QAujyPu4aa	Omg i have the exact problem but she listens but for the talk i get the yelled at and mad talk wen i am upset and my brother gets the "serious talk" like really :P anyway call Judge Judy Judge Joe Brown and Judge David or watever judge or call operah ellen D or dr.phil or talk to a pscolighst

lgNsF5VIaa	Im so sorry to hear about your girlfriend Lauren. But sorry to say all you can do is be there with her everyday at the hospital, tell her how much you love her and dont let her forget it, let her lean on you when she goes to class, maybe get her a locket with a picture of you two if you havent already. I think all that might mean a WHOLE BUNCH to her. And i'll be praying for Lauren.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	If it were my guy I would be there every single day, the last thing that they would need is to have someone they love back out on them because they are sick.

Hang in there|`|6UhpC09Haa	id just want to be by her side<br>  im not like the average guy when it comes to dating and stuff<br>  i love holding the persons hand, so id do that, id smile a lot hoping that it will be contagious, hugs.. ehhh, only if she starts crying, id put my arms around her, she'd put her head on my chest, id put my chin or head on her head, its really quite simple if u think about it|`|bz1gqlXuaa	i think its incredibly important that you stand by her!

That's the most important thing. Even if you guys just sit and watch TV or sit with her while she sleeps, be there. Remember to listen to her. Ask her questions about her illness and treatments but LISTEN to the answers. Tell her about school and offer to bring her work to her and help with it. Be company for her when no one else will. People hate visiting hospitals so they tend to neglect their loved ones simply because they don't like seeing them in that condition and they don't know what to say.

Its a known fact.|`|R3OV3TJeaa	From the relationships I've seen it seems like men will put up with so much before they consider divorce.  Women get mad and use divorce as a weapon to throw in the mans face which is crap.

I'm a woman and I see my male friends get royally screwed.|`|mCM363I9aa	where is your source?<br>  <br>  if it's true then maybe because most men are insensitive to women and are not willing to change for good.

Take your pick.  But this is a two way street and have heard of men saying the same thing about the women they married.  The difference is that unlike men, women have support (girlfriends) that encourage them to divorce if they are not happy.  Why stay in a relationship where wither party is not happy??

This is VERY good! You are SO SO SO SO SO smart to remain abstinent. I can't even tell you how good of a decision this is. You are NEVER too old to be a virgin.

I PROMISE You, you will not regret this!|`|EHqsVwSWaa	There is no such thing as an age where a person is too old to be a virgin.

Alot of yong kids- middle school even, are having sex at way too young an age before they understand how important what they're doing really is.

There is no age that is too old to be a virgin, but my opinions is that thirties would just be sad.|`|aT71jM10aa	It's actually a good thing that you're a virgin. Im also 18 and a virgin. it's respective. there's no force, you should do it when you feel like it, when you really want to. don't just do it cuz u don't wanna be a virgin anymore, do it to enjoy it really and with a person that you really like. since you waited all this long, dont just give away to just anyone.|`|SRPh7SjVaa	It's not really the fact you need to worry about how old is too old to be a virgin...its the thing you need to not measure yourself to other people.

Save it until both of you will enjoy it, trust me. It's never a one sided thing.|`|0ccfcd99b2e5ab8a2e0909ee18e9dc6daa	No of course its not bad.

I suppose just to wait until u meet someone that u feel u can give ur body, mind, and soul to which hopefully will happen when u are married.  I want to wait til then as well but not everyone gets married so its all up to personal experience since everyone is different.  Good luck!|`|yOr4SOO4aa	No it's not a bad age to still be a virgin. It's so much better to wait than to regret all your life you did it with the wrong guy!! Just enjoy wile you are still a virgin, and try to take the right to choice when you decide to lose it. I think 30 is a weir age to still be a virgin haha|`|AQWX3Ue7aa	ur never to old wait till that 1 guy comes where  u arent scared anymore and if something did happen it would be okay.

Sorry its long, hope it helps.|`|xx8saTheaa	dude im the same way but when i go to church in this dude that was 18 having sex in our preacher tould him he was disappointed with him because of that my preacher tould me the question is is it bad to be married in be a virgin but im a virgin in i dont care im a get some|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	it's not a good or bad thing. whatever works for you, works for you. my best guy friend was a virgin until he was 23. worked for him. if you aren't comfortable then its not the right time. <br>  <br>  and i have no idea what this 60/40 bs you are talking about is... but your virginity shouldn't be left to percentages. i hate generalizations like that. your body, your choice- and neither is wrong.|`|AA11938597	By the picture, you seem extremely pretty and no doubt the "question" comes up. NEVER do anything you have in doubt. The "answer all" to not having sex before marriage is BS. What feels good and YOU are comfy with is the answer. Look within yourself and you well know the answer...You got it and don't look for it sooner than you want it.|`|tD0nI64xaa	Hey, it's your decision. I think it's cool you decided to wait. It'll be nice to come "pure" to your wedding night, eh? But it's all your decision. You're never too old. You're still young. Try to see what do you think we'll be the best for YOU.|`|1FitXo3gaa	im 16 and im about to have sex<br>  but i dont encourage it<br>  your 10 times better than me<br>  i just want to do it<br>  but i dont think your to old at all<br>  maybe at 23 your to old<br>  lolz|`|HU7iCAFAaa	tell the guy no funny stuff and go slow i don't know?|`|gkUOBRj4aa	What do you think? Truthfully, there's no "bad" or "good" with these kind of things. It all depends on your morals.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you my opinion, just to give you some different sides to help you decide on what you think. I will probably wait until I'm married, because there's so many life-changing consequences of sex. There's the more obvious ones, such as AIDS and getting pregnant. And it's not just getting pregnant. It's not only you. You have to realize that you're going to have an entire child in you. Its life depends on your choices, and it's your responsibility. Sex isn't something that you can just decide to do. I can't believe how wrong today's society interprets it. You have to realize that everything that happens afterwards is all thanks to you. <br>  <br>  And there's so many other people involved in this. Your family could be devastated, depending on their views of sex. They might never trust you again, whether or not that's their fault or yours. Your friends may never trust you again. They might see as a whole different person, as may everyone else you know. I just heard yesterday that my friend in middle school was pregnant. I'm not going to treat her like a different person, but it's so strange to know that somebody so sweet and fun actually had sex and has a living, breathing human being inside her. I also heard that she might have had an abortion, and I can't believe she could kill a life so easily. But even if you didn't, it would be so difficult to raise the child. You'd have to get many people involved, but who would do it? You could get the baby adopted, but it's such a hard decision to let go of something you made yourself and that's a part of you and is yours.<br>  <br>  And it's not just seeing you as a slut for having sex; it's knowing that you have a child inside or that you could die pretty soon because of AIDS. Victims of the disease are lucky to live 20 or 30 years after they're diagnosed with it. So, would you rather live to be a 40 year old virgin, or die before you even get there?<br>  <br>  I think that sex is way too highly valued. It's not something you have to do. Some people might argue that it's better to have fun while you live than live a pointless life. But I mean, some people say that bungee jumping and riding on roller coasters is living, but not everybody has to do it. I personally love roller coasters and hope to bungee jump one day, but I wouldn't risk killing myself to do it. There's so many other choices to have fun than just sex.<br>  <br>  And I don't mean to ruin sex for you, but this is just what I believe. One might also say that it's not like they're having sex a billion times, but as slutty and gross as it may sound, some people can get addicted to sex. Some people use it like a drug or like alcohol, and use it to get over issues in their lives. Would you want to end up like that?<br>  <br>  Although this might make you scared to have sex, I'm not trying to do that. It's not bad to have sex, just wait until you're married and have some support under you. Right now you're so young and you need to live out your life, but the consequences of sex could ruin it. When you love somebody and you feel that the time is right and you know that the person loves you, it will be a much better experience.<br>  <br>  I think you should think about how you feel about sex and what you value more. Then you can decide.|`|LaBxzWa7aa	Lose it whenever you want.<br>  <br>  The average for the average social teen is in the 16~21 range.|`|AA10516006	The very best thing to do is wait until Your married..

The majority of people lose their virginity to the wrong person and then regret it later on. Sex really IS a big deal...you can get an STD, you can get pregnant, and it definitely messes with your emotions. Lots of guys can have sex with a girl and then just forget about her. Girls aren't wired the same way. When a girl has sex with a guy, especially if he's her first, she becomes emotionally attached to him, and expects him to be there for her, but sometimes he just doesn't feel the same. Sex adds a lot of frustration and confusion to a relationship. NEVER have sex with a guy just so you can say you aren't a virgin anymore. Getting over the guy I first had sex with when after we broke up has been the hardest thing I've ever gone through in my life. Please just save yourself the pain.|`|llxGXgQxaa	Hmm... I'd say 40 years old is too old to be a virgin..<br>  I'm not a virgin myself and I'm the same age as you... but don't worry about it! Don't rush into something you're not comfortable with it.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Not at all, because having sex can create complications.  Wait until you finished college or university.  Possibly when you are about in the 20s.|`|J5KpCgeEaa	Your fine you should make your 1st time special.  I would say you have a couple more years of being a virgin without being too old.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Don't worry about, you think to be smart.  You should finish college and enjoy yourself.  I was the same way.  There are many girls with 2 or 3 kids and where is the father?<br>  <br>  You don't to wait until you get married, you wait until you are ready.  Don't tell your friend whether you are a virgin or not.<br>  <br>  I know some women died being a virgin, in the old fashion way when a woman had to be a virgin until she got married and they never got married, that not really fear.  Just relax the time will come when you will know.  God bless you.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	I'm your age and waiting for marriage, so obviously I don't think anything's wrong with this. Plus, who wants to get pregnant before they have someone there with you to support the kid. As for too old, I would say... 40 (year old virgin)! Just kidding, maybe 35. It starts getting really strange after 30 though. At least I think. Ha ha|`|AIftgLEGaa	There's nothing wrong with wanting to wait until marriage. It takes a lot of pressure off of dating too. There is no age that is too old to be a virgin. It's all what you think about it. My advice is that if you have any doubts, don't have sex, because there is no going back.|`|cmOGOLTdaa	It's not weird of you at all, its just responsible.  I personally dont think that I am going to wait until marriage, but just until I am in love.  It might be weird if you where like 30 and a virgin, but all that matters is what you feel.  Wait for love.|`|CcTVp28Paa	I lost my virginity when I was 15 to the biggest asssholle in the world who I thought I was in love with.  I regret it.

Ha kidding :] sort of...<br>  <br>  well anyways, a number of adults get married, and a lot have told me they regretted not being a virgin because it would have made their first time on the night of their wedding a whole lot more special. I have chosen to remain absitnent because I want my first wedding night to be very special, and it is true there are a lot of risks that can come of having sex, mostly is your not using condoms. For example - pregnancy, STDs, etc. In my opinion it is not bad, but you actually are someone younger girls can look up to as someone who abstains from having sex, and still haves fun and can get boyfriends, even without choosing to have sex.|`|ay2ksWhsaa	there is no age that is too old to be a virgin, have sex when you want.  and its NOT A BIG DEAL, sex isnt that fun, i dont no what the big hype  is, honeslty i dont find it much better than an HJ.

EhD32t2Kaa	First thing you should do is go up to your Ex friends and nicely say, please stop telling my friends untrue things about me. Then walk away. Then the next day, go up to your supposedly "real friends" and say something like, "How can you possibly believe all those things that those people were saying about me? I thought you were my real friends. I swear I never said anything like that." Try it. It usually works. I hope this helps!|`|yrxENGqbaa	First of all, if any of them were you're friends, then why would they do this; ignore them and act like it doesn't both you.

i6Ix28IPaa	You are dealing with the consequences of your past bad decisions.  There's no easy quick fix for the mess that you've created.  It's unfortunate for your daughter that she was brought into the middle of this.<br>  <br>  You need legal representation and documentation of his abuse.  Talk to a counselor at school for specific help that may be available in your area.|`|1IyzZTpjaa	You say you want a divorce, But you also say you have your own apartment. Why would you have your own apartment if you are married to this guy? Some of this just doesn't make sense. <br>  <br>  If any of this is true, I would suggest you  locate a woman's shelter and stay there for a few days with your daughter. Seek some counseling, and get that guy out of your life.|`|qG2SQAPuaa	He is verbally abusing you.  He wished death on you and an unborn child that belongs to the both of you.  Clearly he has anger issues. Kudos to you for trying to make something of your life by enrolling in school.  How long were you all together before you got married?  Did you not see these signs of "domestic violence."  On the flip side, as far as the myspace it may be beneficial to you and your family if you discontinue the use of it for a while.  Not sure if you want to just come out and tell him that you want a divorce...have you tried counseling?  Interesting, you all are married and you have your own apartment and your own food stamps?  You could also go to the police and get a restraining order.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Does he go out anywhere? Work maybe? Do you have any friends or family that can help you get out?

yNkxTJUjaa	You're young, plenty of time.<br>  <br>  My guess is that they're afraid of talking to you because they won't know what to do. One of my best friends is deaf, and he says its like that all the time.<br>  <br>  The best way to engage them is to be open and outgoing. I know that sucks! I have social anxiety. But hey, why not try throwing a party, or co-host with a good friend.<br>  <br>  Guys won't be as nervous about your being deaf so much if they know you're comfortable with yourself.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Yikes! the ppl above me have no idea! One saod that she's sorry ur deaf, another said its hard for two deaf ppl to communicate?<br>  <br>  Its EASY. Theres more to talking that using mouths. You could offer to teach some guys signing. I know about 100 signs myself, and it was pretty easy. Most of the stuff we talk about is made up on the spot, anyway.<br>  <br>  Not to mention MSN and stuff like that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Say! Thats an idea. FInd out some guys emails and add them to MSN. Then you can chat, and they'd get to know you better without the awkwardness of being in real life.|`|G9mIO5rvaa	maybe if you met other deaf boys they would like you better but the only problem is that it would be even MORE difficult to communicate. being deaf sucks! not that I would know....|`|R0Zs6ifYaa	i bet you are really pretty, maybe try enrolling in programs where deaf boys are, so you can communicate better.|`|jnEgsAHNaa	So I'm guessing you can read lips if you can see them say you are beautiful, that's awesome.  Well the reason why boys won't talk to you is because they don't know how to.  I'm almost positive that if I saw you for the first time, thought you were beautiful, then I definitely would talk to you, but maybe in your situation, they see you as an outcast (shallow people). So another reason would be that maybe they don't want to be seen around school with "the deaf girl", no offense.  All you can do is smile, make more friends, and they will introduce you to more people.  And if a guy really likes you and even knows of your deficiencies, then he would take the time to study sign language.  Hope you find that guy.  If you need a friend or someone to talk to, vent how you feel or whatever, you can add me on facebook, just email me, I don't mind.  Good luck, I know there will be a guy out there that will care for you deeply, just give it time, you are still in school.|`|kN0eajwbaa	I'm confused to be honest. <br>  I'm assuming you can lip read but then how can you talk because you can't hear yourself. Hmmm but if you turned deaf it would work.  <br>  <br>  Anyway...<br>  Maybe they're intimidated by you because you're 'hot'. <br>  Or maybe they just don't understand your disability and don't want to sound stupid by asking you.<br>  <br>  You should talk to some because whats the worst that could happen?|`|f0RHSKKeaa	omg those jerks, i am so sorry ur deaf

AA12398373	I am a musician myself (guitar) so it's hard for me to understand someone hating the playing of their own music on an instrument.<br>  <br>  However from your description, I can easily understand how your brother hates the experience of playing the piano for his parents. It sounds like it must be a torturous ordeal.<br>  <br>  I wonder what would happen if you could coax your brother into playing his piano for you at a time when his parents were out of earshot, and all he heard from you was glowing praise, and joy at his playing.<br>  I am sure he would be pleasantly surprised at 1st. But he would also be very likely to substitute his mother's criticism with some of his own.<br>  <br>  If I am right then it would prove that it isn't the piano that he hates so much as it is that he can't seem to please his parents no matter how much he practices, and hones his abilities.<br>  <br>  If his parents could back off, and encourage their son, and praise him instead of criticizing his hard work, I think that everybody could come out with a little more of what they want.|`|8IbZNRD0aa	i feel you should have a meal with him and bring that up during the dinner!!! :) maybe start off like oh uhh does____ (his name) like the piano because i have been watching and he seems not to like it very much!!! :) i hope this helps. i hope you get this all sorted out!!<br>  good luck|`|goc8Fc9Vaa	Maybe before you say anything to your parents, talk to your brother first and ask him if it would be okay for you to just slightly hint to them that he doesn't like playing the piano. That way at least your brother is aware that you are going to tell your parents something.<br>  <br>  And if he says yes then just ask your parents if they could just LISTEN to what you have to say and not say any input or opinions until you are completely done tell them everything. Then when they talk you listen to what they have to say until they are done. That way no arguements come about.<br>  <br>  I really hope things get better for your brother and parents.|`|dMmmzsvMaa	First ask your brother if he'd mind if you talked to them about it. If and only if he says yes, then you have to talk to them adult to adult. Tell them what he said and how it appears to you. Tell them what you think and how you see it turning out. Tell them what you feel about their part in the matter and how it makes you brother feel. Do all of this as one grown up talking to another. Keep your voice level and calm and look them in the eye. When they get that your serious and this is something to be taken seriously, then you can ask them to not impose their will on him anymore and explain why it would be harmful to him. This isn't about them, it's about your brother. Don't let them turn it into a power struggle. Present it as a series of facts and concerns. I hope that helps.|`|r7nm8TiNaa	Even at age-8, he should be able to talk to his parents about him<br>  not liking the piano. I don't think it's your place to say, anything to them about their child. As long as they are not physically, mentally, verbally abusing or neglectful in any way leave it alone. As long as he resist they are going to make him do this. It's called a power struggle!<br>   They will probably lessen his rehearsal time. if he didn't put up a fight. Tell him to start his practice without them telling him. It's like using reverse psychology.|`|zEo5WT1Taa	it seems to me your biggest problem is betraying you brother. so ask him if he wants you to talk to the parents.  if he does than thats all you can do.

5ajPMlrqaa	I've heard it said once that for a man to marry, it's more about the right timing. For a woman, it's more about the right partner.<br>  <br>  Yes, I do think some people marry to fit in to social pressure - consciously or unconsciously, they can't imagine being single and living alone (or with roommates) - they think that "single" is the odd marital status, it doesn't conform to normal, especially once you hit a certain age, and it's expected that you'll marry by a certain age or something is wrong with you. I think that marriage for many people fulfills more than just the idea of "true love", but it's the idea of having a constant companion or friend, someone who will always be there to go places with, share holidays with, etc - essentially, someone that you always have so you ----will not be alone-------. Marriage is the quickest way for somone to become UNalone.

She probably is getting older and more interested in 'doing it'.|`|TAMGy07Daa	sleeping half naked isn't a problem unless friends sleep over occasionally um if she's trying to draw attention tell her off away from your friends like this for example...<br>  <br>  "Go away ___ *name here* you slut"<br>  <br>  dont try and be loving sensitive. be harsh and she will understand you'r not taking this bull*** anymore.|`|CHF7VtElaa	she's a girl and most girls wants attention from other boys. maybe you should tell her that you don't appreciate it and about the sleeping half naked thing i think if you're not comfortable with it than tell her.|`|TZjUtyF5aa	she eithr A. likes one of them B. wants the attention or C. both...im guessing B
C8DOT8Y7aa	Cut off all communication. This is tough and it will be killing you, but really it's killing her more. She's starting to realize how much she needs you and how much she misses you. Cutting off communication is the biggest step. <br>  Recover Emotionally. You don't have a chance of getting your ex back if you're not emotionally calm and controlled. Women dislike needy, clingy, desperate men - so you need to pull your own life together before attempting to draw her back into it. <br>  Start talking to another girl. This helps for so many reasons. This will probably be too much for your ex. She will find out that you're talking to this girl, and it will get her back to you. **Use with caution as it may give the wrong signals, such as a sign that she should move on because you have.** <br>  Act like nothing is wrong. She's not going to want you back if you're acting depressed. Make sure you're laughing a lot and pretending to have a good time. This is so hard because of the break up depression. <br>  Look your best. Make sure your acne is gone, you get yourself shaped up, and looking good. She won't be able to resist.|`|OUtEtm2vaa	when she moves towards you or if you see her REDRUM!|`|8YEM7Qveaa	Sorry to tell you this, but once a cheater, always a cheater. I live by the one strike rule. If someone cheats on you, it will ALWAYS play on your mind what they are up to and you know that they are capable of cheating again.<br>  <br>  Love does make you think and do crazy things, but sometimes letting them go would be best for the heart.|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	why wood u went some who hurt you  if i where you i wood not take her back  you deserve  someone batter then that  so no|`|TZjUtyF5aa	well why moving on is out of the question i still suggest you try cause to me it sounds like shes using as a back up plan...but..keep your feelings in check and try not to ask too many questions or text her all the time b/c thats kinda needy..and if she cheated on you it seems like she doesnt care for you as much as you do her..you deserve better..try to get back out there but i get it..moving on sometimes just isnt possible.|`|mC2dRyuMaa	Well i know u must be hearing this but its true move on .. she not worth u being so hurt i understand how it feels to be in love and being hurt by the one u love is the worste type of pain ever trust me i know but why should u wait for her.

I was hurt, devestated, and went through a weird depressive state.  As time passes, you will become better, and trust me when I say that you will meet other women out there.  My GF just left me, and this was the woman I wanted to marry!  You're not alone compadre, and I guarantee that things will be better.  Even though it's hard, you have to smile and have a positive energy about you and then you will meet women.  2007-2008 were some of my best years as far as picking up women go because I was in a good state career and health wise and was always positive. Just be confident and it will be easy to meet women.  You're too young to feel this way over a girl.  Keep your head up and stay strong.<br>  <br>  -Love you brother.
wgZVeLZPaa	While he may be grieving, that is absolutely no reason at all to treat her like this. I think he's scared of living life without his mom, and perhaps even afraid of getting cancer himself. But that does NOT make his behavior acceptable.<br>  <br>  What she needs to do is tell him that much. "I want to support you, and I am so sorry about your mom - but I WILL NOT allow you to treat me like this. I love you and I want us to work, but you will not treat me like I've done something wrong, when I haven't."<br>  <br>  He doesn't need to get over his grief - that could take a while. But he should definitely think about his wife instead of it being all about him. She's going through this with him.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	be patient remember for better or worse just be there for him he just lost his mom|`|AA11969451	I understand that her patience with him may be thin and I do not think it was appropriate for him to put his hands on her...that being said...the death of a parent is a horrible experience. It sounds like he is grieving heavily. There is nothing she can do except be there if he wants to talk. She should not push him/ask him if he wants to talk...leave him alone. This is something he must do on his own.|`|HynN4MM1aa	Just being supportive and there is the best thing.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	It's pretty hard for us to advise, because we don't know what she is saying or doing that may be setting him off.  Honestly, he may just want to "cave up" for a bit and process on his own - I would get pretty annoyed if someone wanted to hang around and fuss over me and talk up a storm.  After I was widowed, I treasured time alone in the car, because there wasn't somebody in my face and on my case at all times, telling me what THEY thought I should be thinking/feeling/reacting/doing/not doing.  I'm guessing that she is thinking she is being supportive, but is really probably being a clingy, oppressive pain in the butt.  A lot of guys clam up when they are grieving - but a lot of women just don't shut up, and have to moan and groan and weep and yap and carry on, which would make me want to react the same way he did. You can see those two different styles of grieving don't mix well.  I'd say she needs to get out of his face and not be so overtly "supportive" in that oh-so-intrusive way that women often do (and BTW, I'm female, but I probably am wired more like a guy..) and just let him alone.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	Sounds like there is more going on than his mothers death, if she can't get him into counseling or a grief councilor than she needs to have him leave the apartment.  A order of protection might be something she needs to look into, he's a loose cannon and he could possibly do something very stupid involving hurting his wife.|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	Hum...I would say space is the best thing. People grieve in so many different ways. He seems to be having a very tough time with this. Death is a hard thing to go through. Was he close with his mother? I would tell her to be very patient with him. Three weeks is still a fresh wound my gosh its not like its been three years. Maybe she was pressuring him to talk. If I were her I would just be there when he wants to talk about it. Dont force him to open up. This is something he has to come to terms with himself. It takes so much time to heal. Maybe he just wants to be left alone. I would tell her to just leave him be. Dont talk about it. Its a tough thing to go thru. Good luck|`|7c7e9ee35d10a7b0e7e011d66f491c1baa	Some people grieve differently, it's only been two weeks.  However it does not give him  the right to put his hands on her or put her out.  Tell her to stay at your place for a while and give him a chance to gather his thoughts.  If he doesn't apologize for his actions within the next couple of days then it may be time to move on.  In all honesty I would move on now because the abuse has gradually graduated from mental to verbal and now physical.  If she stay it is only going to get worst.  If he will grab on her he will beat her.  This is the advice I have however, she know how she feels about her husband.  Her mouth may tell her to leave but her heart may tell her to stay.  She need to pray about it and ask God for guidance.  Please tell her to not make a hasty decision.
KXuNNj11aa	I don't know how old you are, but some parents have an age limit that they stand behind.  Maybe you can make a deal with them, like if you get good grades or do your chores or anything that would make them feel like you are responsible and willing to work for something you want.  You don't need a speech just speak from your feelings and explain your side.  Good luck!|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Do you know how big of a responsibility it is to take care of a belly button piercing or any type of piercings? Belly button piercings can get infected very easily and need to be kept clean constantly. I have seen the damages from piercings not kept clean. Some had nasty scars.<br>  <br>  If you have to write a speech, then I am guessing that your parents have already said no and you are trying to get them to change their minds. Well don't count on it. Just wait until you are 18 and don't need their permission so you have only yourself to blame when you are screaming in pain because you can't get the piercing out because it is full of puss.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I would like your attention to let you know, I am going out and getting a job, and I will save up all the money I earn to pay my own medical bills to pay for very possible infection I may get, and will not ask for any plastic surgery to cover up the scars if they are huge enough to notice. I further take on full responsibility if I get MRSA infections from this, I will not hold it against you while Im being cut and scrubbed on and stuck in the hospital and I will hold my grades up and my firends will collect all my school work and brnig to the hospital to me.<br>  Cite see utube videos of horrid infections from teens who thought it was ok to get a peircing. This might get me to change my mind, knowing I wont go broke fighitng off an infection you get. Although Id lose my house if you got MRSA because my ins would not cover a self inficlted or studio inflicted injury that caused such a horrid infection.|`|ZoeS825Kaa	Okay here it goes.....Mom(pause) Dad, I was thinking about how much crazier all of the boys would go if i got a belly ring.

Because that can come out when ever?<br>  <br>  Yea thats a better idea wow you guys are sooo clever!<br>  <br>  and do it quick so they think they actually thought of it<br>  <br>  PS millions of people have mrsa and are perfectly healthy! Pigs carry it in their noses :P not that there is ANY chance of catching mrsa from getting a piercing-->go to a reputable place! good luck!|`|TAMGy07Daa	If its a self express try and tell them what it exactly express's from you...?<br>  <br>  I for one, think button piercings are POINTLESS??|`|pOTigVYPaa	I think you need to wait until you're 18 for a belly piercing.
2xQuaZHwaa	It sounds like the mom is trying to punish her for dropping out. I don't know what you could do to help except encourage her to go to night school or go back to school|`|Wf8PbTraaa	hell yea thats unfair and its not right.<br>  <br>  but sadly theres nothing you or her can do til she turns 18. unless she can find some family member who will become her legal guardian until she turns 18 theres nothing that can be done.<br>  <br>  give her this advice: save up as much as you can and when you turn 18 move out.|`|Ho4mZ6mSaa	The problem here is not only the mother its the daughter as well. You could tell your friend to talk to her mother about her getting her High School Diploma that would be the first step. From there she has doors open if she ever chooses to go to College. The mother needs to understand that nothing is more important then school for this girl, I believe this is some bad parenting. If the mother does not go for it I suggest you tell the girl to move out that would be her best move because with her mother she won't get anywhere.
nOU8WvmDaa	Yes, one of the most highly guarded secrets of attracting women is that they have an unknown and subliminal attraction to electromagnet frequencies. All you have to do take a magnet, hook it up to a D battery and the put several of those in your underwear.|`|p0mCoRyMaa	ofcourse, didnt you know?|`|PoXgnA4Iaa	WTF......who are you?  What kind of question is that....?  Yeah, that whistle exists....my mom gave it to my dad when she left him on their 26th aniversary.....It costs $1.99 at 711 (sarcasm).  <br>  <br>  Hold on, my whistle's calling me, RETARD|`|1dP7Viiuaa	yup yup it does. just buy any normal whistle, stand in the middle of a 5-lane road and blow hard. all the hot chicks will come scampering after you.<br>  <br>  what do you think, these chicks are dogs or sth?<br>  <br>  dumbarse|`|Qu6jpbNuaa	oh my god you are such a retard.<br>  <br>  yea thats it hot chicks respond to certain types of whistles. i would SO like to see someone try that
1qkdHe8jaa	just walk up to a random girl (or whatever girl) and give her a hug. simple!|`|k07IyDvwaa	just say simply "can i have a hug?" and she probably will just say yes|`|yrxENGqbaa	You go to a party and slow dance then hug her. Or bring her to see a scary/chick flick/ sad movie and hug her if her emotions touch her. Or even just ask for a hug!!!|`|IHwp0THdaa	well, you can ask or just give, but whatever you do, DON'T LINGER. hug her then let go. if you feel resistance, you've held on way too long. :)|`|o3u2oG41aa	just go up and hug her lol.<br>  if she rejects then oh well but its a hug,<br>  not a kiss she is less likly to reject!|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Well there is always asking:) lol|`|L3n37nbNaa	just ask for a hug. just ask if u can get a hug..and she will probably  hug u.
fZKef53saa	Well I think the best thing to do is just talk to her
v1yefcFjaa	yeah don't do that. thats sooooo obvious haha. you're better off talking to him a little and tell him to call you then say i think i gave you my number before right? when he says no then give him your number and get his. then call up later and talk and get to know each other
5PBRR4NVaa	Maybe you should appreciate his good qualities if he has any.  <br>  <br>  Why focus on the negatives in this?|`|0gFdt7VUaa	Are you serious? You cant make someone go to work!<br>  You cant change someone else. You can only change yourself. Starting with putting your feelings for him aside. Your children's feeling should always come over yours or anyone elses ( within reason ) until they are old enough to care for themselves. Your children deserve and need to be cared for by both parents.<br>   You are supposed to make decisions as a unit. And he has chosen to make a decision, on his own, to stay home. SO I think its time for you to make a decision on your own. You either except the situation and make the best of it or get out of the situation. Those are your two options.<br>   Unless the two of you as a couple have made the choice for him to stay home, then he as a man, should be caring for his family.<br>   You cant change him!!!!!!!!<br>  Besides there are some perks to him staying home...childcare is expensive! I assume he does the cleaning and cooking too right? I mean anyone ( male or female )who is not working should at least do that much!!|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Cut him off... the "benefits of marriage" are not for someone who isn't earning them by being a breadwinner. Make it clear that this is a two-way street. If he wants something from you, he has to work and pay the bills. Lock the bedroom door and let him sleep on the couch. Hopefully that will motivate him.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you need to get out there and start working for your own benefit.  Find a friend, neighbor or family member to look after the kid, and go to work... even if working means two part-time jobs right now. Get your own bank account(s) and save your money. Don't let the husband know how much you are making... bring home a pittance, but the majority goes into the bank account.<br>  <br>  When you get enough savings built up, you need to confront the husband and tell him you want a divorce and to pack his bags NOW.|`|BE2vknbHaa	If nothing has change in 3 years chances are things aren't going to any time soon. The only thing you could do is give him an ultimatum. He needs to realize that its his duty to be a husband and a father and take care of his family. If he doesn't simply move on its hard but its better in the long run.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Unfortunately, you picked the wrong BOY to be the father and husband of your family.  He's not a man - he's not responsible, dependable, or even respectful.<br>  Sorry, but you can't FORCE a boy to become a MAN.<br>  You chose wrong.|`|AA12398373	Instead of trying to change your husband, it would be easier to just change husbands.|`|KXuNNj11aa	If it has been 3 years the chances of him changing and being a supportive husband sounds pretty slim.  I guess you could tell him he has x amount of time to get his crap together and mean it. If he does not live up to the agreement boot him out.  Life is to short too and your kids are too important to live unhappy
y4zYkceEaa	Yes it is. You shouldn't feel that way though. Get over him, he obviously doesn't have a heart! Move on hun. You're better off without him. ;))|`|HH90Eghaaa	Yes it is, its just not ok for you to act negatively on your feelings!|`|3kvV2oVDaa	Yes. Absolutely normal. Don't worry!|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	Its completely normal to feel jealous and upset. I would feel the same way as you right now if I was in your situation. <br>  People always move on, and you should to. If your ex flirted with his current gf while you were still dating, then that guy was not worth it. I know I wouldnt want my bf to flirt with other girls. <br>  You should go out with your friends and find a new guy. Maybe your ex bf would feel jealous too when he see's you and you new bf. He'll see what a great girl he missed out on. <br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|TycCeqtaaa	yeah it is normal to feel that way.<br>  i would say that he broke up with you to go out with her. (of course)<br>  drop the being upset part, you go out there and find yourself someone fun and exciting and maybe getting back at your ex would make you feel better.<br>  im not saying you have to get a boyfriend|`|HtHFHfDKaa	Yes you should be upset but obviously he is interested in someone else and you should do the same that way you won't be hanging onto him since he has already moved on.|`|0qjAT3yVaa	yep!!!! feel played too don't you?? life is a *****,many more to come|`|S852p6SXaa	yeah. im sorry he did that to you but you dont need a guy who dumps one chick for another, you need a guy who can only focus on one girl and that girl being you. if can he easily brake up with you for her then he'll proabably break up with her when another chick comes along. i bet when hes done with her he'll try to come back to you and when or if he does happen to tell him hell no and to get the fu(k out your face. you can do better.|`|sROU8U32aa	ive heard some guys do that just so they dont have to buy presents ...or maybe he just got tired/bored who knows? did he start acting more distant before he broke up with you? Well there's nothing to do but get over him. Sure it takes time but hang out with friends as much as you can, go see movies out in theatres, listen to break up songs or songs that make you feel happy and it's completely normal to feel the way you do. :) Best of luck!|`|roQIRcZVaa	Aw hunny I feel so sad.<br>  Yes, it is normal for you to feel jealous and upset!<br>  I mean wow, a day before your year too.<br>  <br>  Some guys are jerks.  He sounds stupid.  Whatever you do, don't call him.  don't text him.  don't go up to him at school.  Ignore him and act as happy as possible.  Hang around one of your "guy friends."  DON'T, I REPEAT DON'T BUG HIM.  Let him suffer.  Let him have that stupid girl.  You will find someone so much better for you.  That won't leave you for a girl.  That won't flirt with someone while going out with you.  <br>  <br>  And don't listen to anybody that tells you not to cry.  Cry all you want.  Cry in your room.  listening to loves songs.  Just cry and release everything.  Just please don't cry in front of him.  <br>  <br>  You will find someone better, trust me.  Good luck okay sweetie?<br>  <br>  <3|`|iizKx4Bvaa	those are actual feelings so yes it is normal. What you do with them is what will set you apart. Shake it off sudt it off and hold your head up high and move on to bigger better things. Doing well is the best revenge for anything.|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	Yes, if you still have feelings for him. I'm sure you feel like he dumped you for her and he has had this planned the whole time and that would be a good assumption.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yes, it's normal to feel jealous. The important thing is how you overcome that feeling.|`|i0yQ3Xbtaa	Yes. That's normal. You're not over him yet.|`|e0f49fac888b43634b65ba1815b4cab0aa	yep|`|ozRry8cNaa	duhh girl, of course it is normal to feel that way.   I mean he broke up with you a day before your one year anniversary,  any girl would feel that way.  Your upset because he is dating a girl right after her broke up with you.  And your jealous because another girl gets the man you were with for a long time.  It's natural to feel that way in your position, but there is a better guy out there for you, you just have to wait and be patient.  God has someone out there for you, you just got wait for them lol i know it sounds so cliche' and **** but its true.<br>  <br>  Your also angry because he was flirting with that girl before he even broke up with you,  and you should be. Guys shouldn't flirt with other girls when they already have a girlfriend.  And in my opinion, he was already probably going to break up with you long before he did and I apologize if that hurts but that's my thoughts on it. <br>  <br>  But just let this guy go and find a new one who is better than this one, have high standards for your next boyfriend and stick to them.  Be picky when your choosing a guy but not to picky, and have fun with the single life until some guy catches your eye.  Flirt, laugh, and have fun right now and be patient for your Mr. Right!!!|`|HfZeQR4Aaa	It's normal for you to feel jealous and upset. I know I would be! He was someone you cared about. You were thinking about the one year anniversary and he was putting the moves on someone else.  He's so not worth your tears. He is not ready for a commitment and this is proof. However, I recommend you get over him quickly. This proves to him that you are a strong person and that you don't need him.  Date one of his friends or a guy he doesn't like. Just date one of them and nothing more. That will mess up his ego. Or you can take the high road and act like he doesn't exist.|`|Kp2ZkZvAaa	Getting dumped after a lengthy relationship always hurts. Mourning the loss of someone that was there for so long is normal and the pain is real. It is normal to feel jealousy because for so long he was yours. Now from my experiences it is not good to show the pain in public especially in front of him. Show him you are alright even if you may not be. Its hard i know but its for the better. He sounds like a dick. Try to move on hang out with friends. Look for someone else to call your own. It takes time though. But yes every emotion you are feeling is normal.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	I would think that it is very natural to feel that way. Nobody likes to be rejected and it can be very hurtful to find out who you were traded in for. Just be sure not to dwell on these feelings. Go out and do something nice for yourself and remember that the right guy is out there for you. You just have to keep looking....|`|h0DHZNE0aa	it is completely normal.... :) it is the human nature to feel jealous/upset when someones boyfriend goes and flirts with someone, and then breaks up with them, and dates the other person.... it is normal, but you need to move on.... :) there are plenty of fish out there..... :)|`|tLyfneelaa	yes it is if you were dating him for long its normal for you to feel those feelings its hard to see someone that used to flirt with you flirt with someone else its a normal emotion to have in your situation|`|9IRukMtxaa	Definitely normal! But he sounds like a bastard and you don't want a bastard for a boyfriend do you? Lol you don't need a guy, seriously. Just have fun and forget him! Look for someone else - someone better.|`|wRjRMT3Yaa	Upset-yes<br>  Jealous-no. Never do this.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	normal? yes pointless? yes. hes obviously a jerk. forget him.|`|wnr9S9kuaa	It's normal, you're just not the type of person who gets over it fast.|`|F0NfKljZaa	It is not because then you know that you still have feelings for this guy.|`|MRODFWgmaa	Hell yeah its normal but this guy is a total douche!<br>  Wat an asss!<br>  I'm sorry! :/<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|B4SF8sPraa	that was his transition period he got bored of you maybe he thought hed get laid with the other girl|`|w0VgBIAjaa	yes- if you need a boyfriend e-mail me at justin.balke@yahoo.com You can cry on my shoulder baby i won't leave you|`|f46c1565dc71da44455bee05ec77e0c2aa	It is HIS loss.

Happy birthday to your daughter!!!|`|T3b4I4kXaa	How about a passbook savings account at a local bank? Teach her about saving part of her allowance or babysitting earnings, and show her about the interest it pays. <br>  Promise to match every dollar she puts away towards her goal... usually a car or college. Perhaps do this matching on a semi-annual basis just to motivate her.|`|xTNxWlH7aa	hmm well take her to stores when you go shopping see what she likes or you can by her something from the jonas brothers thier 3-d concert experience is out soon as well thier very populer with tweens|`|TAMGy07Daa	go around stores and see what shes interested in, dont buy it for her until her birthday arrives
wiCikxUAaa	If he doesn't want to get you what you want, ask him why did he bother to ask? Ask if he would be willing to buy you a necklace instead. If he says yes, you can say a ring is no different, it celebrates the anniversary. Not the loss of his independence.|`|9UQlhzitaa	try telling him that the ring to you is the same as you not kissing another guy or whatever fits with his personality<br>  <br>  i know the ring is emotional security to you ;but for a guy it has to be put in terms of respect or he will not get your point<br>  <br>  well i hope you get your ring,good luck|`|JdEch19Paa	tell him you want a promise ring. it means he is yours and hell be there for you whenever you need it. its not an engagement or a wedding its just a promise ring. my friends do this thing. my one friend together 3 years and they got each other promise rings. it was very cute.|`|YnCoiT5jaa	There are three rings in a relationship. 1.Engagement ring 2.Wedding ring 3.Suffering!!!!

Tell her that she once was your bestfriend and shes pushing you away by treating you like this and you want to move forwards being close. If she chooses not to listen and continues being that way then just distance yourself from her. Make school, and friends your number 1 priority and she'll realize that your actually the mature one. You'll grow up to treat people with respect and she'll whine and ***** her way thru life. Dont worry in time karma will bite her in the ***. If your parents are siding with you then they know how she is. Good for you for being your own person you dont want to act like that. Just know Karma is a ***** and shes gunna get hers if she doesnt straighten up.|`|fajdCVupaa	SweetHeart my sister and I are the same exact way. no joke at all. We fight all the time.It feels like no one cares about me or etc. My sister and I try to make the best out of it sometimes. Dont worry everything will be okay. You just need to let it take time.   :)|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	well maybe thats just part of who she is...shell eventually mature and realize that she shouldnt be acting like that towards u. she needs to know that she cant control u and if she misses the old u she'll stop
NjBkMl3Yaa	Honestly just make friends, close ones, go places with them like crazy. don't get involved in drgs and alcohol and stuff, it'll mess up your life forever...trust me on that. When you get into high school join sports, go to summer camp during the summer for those sports if they offer them. Or if you're not athletic get involved in something you enjoy...journalism, yearbook committee, ASB, photography, join clubs...dramais fun, choir is too, or join band or orchestra...<br>  <br>  Personally I am in journalism i write for the school newspaper, I am captain of the colorguard/wintergard team at my school, i play bass clarenet in concert band...I have a boyfriend...and maintan over a 3.5 GPA....with AP classes.<br>  <br>  Get good grades...it's the outline for your future high school is. don't shrug off your education whatever you do.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	get out as much as possible have adventures and live life to the fullest|`|uzcK1k9faa	don't have sex if macks ya life a mess trust me!!!!!!|`|nLDzpHxUaa	best age= 3. didnt have to worry about anything!!!<br>  <br>  hang out with your church friends(like go out and eat after church together)..or make some friends from school
6c010ec34eb50fa52c9a9cfde1163d14aa	I think ladies can still be very attractive, even sometime look better with glasses. find a style that fits you, or wear contacts if it makes you feel more comfortable. As far as braces go, I don't think it's a turn off at all.|`|CYLGIL7vaa	you could wear contacts and braces is just a matter of time. after that, you will have a perfect smile!!! <br>  ok here is what you do, talk to guys more and show them your personality. you cant do anything about your braces and maybe not alot on glasses so wear stuff that they think is kinda attractive and add your own creativity to it. looks arent everything you know!!! also be a little outgoing and socialize a little more. then they have to come to you!!!!!<br>  hope this helps!!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Just be yourself.  Look on the good side, the glasses is what lies behind your true beauty.  When you get your braces off, you will have a gorgeous smile that you will make the boys fall for you.  Just be yourself and keep your chin up.|`|xWq93Ckyaa	you could always get contacts.<br>  <br>  but a guy shouldn't not like you because you're wearing glasses & braces. he should like you for who you are. but in this crazy world we live in, everyone knows that people are judged by appearance. just have confidence in yourself.|`|QgCqvtTQaa	if they deserve you....then  they will see past the glasses and braces for who you really are and like you either way.|`|L9MDzufnaa	If they really like you, they won't care about that. Or get a guy who has those too!|`|7UKJY0v0aa	contacts...or just be really approachble and outgoing|`|KpiCMmmVaa	i doubt thats the reason.i used to have braces and glasses, i eventually got contacts though and if you really are feeling like that about it then maybe you should try out contacts.i like braces for some reason lol i think theyre cute.and theres nothing you can do about them anyway, until they come off and it will be worth it because of your perfect smile.  but if a guy is really worth it he wont care whether you have braces nd glasses or not.to really get a guy to like you doesnt just depend on looks.  youve got to be approachable and get along with them.pretty soon theyll see wut kind of person you are on the inside and that will shine on the outside. good luck :]|`|1nV16XyTaa	Well,<br>  dont let something silly like that stop you from thinking guys would like you,they probably already do! You just dont think it.<br>  <br>  Although if it is upsetting you,how about trying contact lenses? Or fashionable cute glasses.<br>  <br>  And as for braces,i have them and theyve never stopped a guy from liking me or anyone else I know that has braces.<br>  <br>  Get some confidence going and you'll soon find they'll come to you,|`|B4SF8sPraa	kinda not a problem i like glasses and braces to me are irrelevant i think glasses are always cute and braces barely ever show.. just get a little "friendlier" know what i mean cuddle bug more drop stuff in front of guys lick lips short skirts tight shirts :)|`|I7OqMnkfaa	oh man, haha first off.. guys shouldnt care about that!! but theyy dooo XD<br>  <br>  well braces are cute!! i love them and if you dont have a nice smile, they really make you look nicer. haha :D<br>  <br>  buttt like megan up top said, contacts help alot <br>  :)<br>  !!|`|q8Q73swmaa	i have glasses and i dont think there ugly. uhhm dont worry. my bf makes me have s**x with them on. allot of guys think there hot|`|tLyfneelaa	wow braces in my mind are sexy lol and guys like girls with glasses it helps them know there smart and have good vision lol if a guy really cared for you he would look past braces and glasses|`|F0NfKljZaa	That is what happened to me and i just was myself and the guy just had to accept that.|`|NiO0qTEzaa	It's really lame because when you have glasses and braces everyone thinks you're a nerd/geek/weirdo.<br>  <br>  Don't change to contacts if you're comfortable with your glasses. You shouldn't have to change to be liked.<br>  <br>  Just let your personality shine through, because a person worth being with you is a person who likes you for YOU, not a fake. Good luck!|`|PkUPp4s0aa	you're probably still young. the braces will come off eventually, and you can get contacts! in the meantime...either find a guy to like you for YOU...or work on loving yourself! i know it sounds stupid but you can't be happy with anybody until you're 100% happy with yourself! focus on you! have girls nights. stay in and watch movies that you enjoy. focus on school. eventually the right guy will come around :) till then just focus on yourself.|`|WQj1v4Ixaa	if they really like you than they'll understand perfectly. about how you feel if you tell them .they shouidnt care about the glasses or the braces .my girlfriend doesnt and were still together after two years|`|wQcFLCXRaa	well i had both but i got contacts and that really made a difference....try em
vYoyGziFaa	She's in the bathroom.<br>  <br>  Then call her and tell her to call home on her cell, in case they have caller ID.<br>  <br>  You and I both know she's dating a 24-year old who is telling her "Sure I love you. Now take off your panties", or she and her friends are doing drugs, or getting drunk.
fPDCgKjbaa	He probably has realised just how much his ex meant to him, and since he now relates you to the break up he resents you, misguided of course, it was his mistake, but that may be the cause of his avoidance.<br>  What happens next may depend on his ex. If she takes him back, he will have to avoid you even more than he is currently, which is a shame, but he may be willing to pay that price. Or, if she doesn't take him back, over time he should realise that he has a chance with you, and should be a little more open to your texts, etc.<br>  So what can you do in this situation? I suggest that, if possible, you try talking to him about his ex. This is probably going to be impossible though, so instead text only occasionally and when neccessary, to give him some space - you don't want to crowd him - but to still let him know that you are there. Eventually he will either stop texting you AT ALL or will go back to his usual self.<br>  <br>  Just a warning - he was willing to spend a day with you when he had a gf - whos to say that he wouldn't do the same with another girl if you were his gf?|`|zzzcJrCWaa	i think he realised that he wasnt doing something good to his girlfriend. his girlfriend was probably mad and told him not to hang out with you. we can get veerrryy jealous. lol|`|6LKEWFPoaa	He is like most men, they act all stupid when they get caught doing something wrong. He is a dog, move on!
Likst1Mxaa	Just walk off on them when they are acting immature or selfish. they'll soon get the hint.<br>  <br>  Also, try making new friends or getting involved with different stuff at school. You could do with new friends who aren't rude to you.|`|fG1h5WKxaa	i tot. agree wit aussie|`|xTNxWlH7aa	ok my advice is tell them how you feel not sure if you did just be like why are we going to hang if your not even talking see what happens i had a similar problem with a friend things never change cuz in the end people really only care about themselves and how they feel most friend chose a love/like over a friend anyways find better friends i did|`|nLDzpHxUaa	just be like "hey guys, you asked me to hang out so put your phones away and lets hang out!!" but put it in a joking kinda tone.
58e98bd59b1d79fc78aa1f834709971aaa	hes a loser..<br>  move on mate<br>  he dont want you<br>  <br>  you can and will do better x<br>  <br>  <br>  not all men are like this/ some of them are loverly..and thankfully.. ive got one of them... <br>  good luck x|`|Sxd0tXDwaa	he is not straight so stop tormenting him!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Ok well for starters, you know that idea you have about him begging you for forgiveness? You might as well let that one go, because it isn't going to happen. This guy clearly doesn't care how you feel, otherwise, he wouldn't have been yanking your chain all this time. <br>  <br>  To tell you that he thinks he's gay, and then proceed to still have sex with you whenever he wants, tells me that he's probably lying about thinking he's gay and being all confused so you won't think you can have a relationship with him, yet he still keeps you under his thumb for sex. He's USING you, and lying to you too. If a man really, honestly thought he may be gay, he'd be spending his time finding other men to hang around and figure things out with, not guilt-tripping a half@ss girlfriend into having sex with him. If I were you, I'd "help him out" by putting his picture on a dating site for gay men...or perhaps even talk a guy friend into "persuing" him. What a jerk, seriously. <br>  <br>  He's insulting you becuase you are letting him. He has no right to, but you're not helping yourself by allowing him in. You need to tell this guy that his game's over, you know he's as straight as an arrow, that he's a lying sack of crap, and to never call you again. Then don't answer his calls, his texts, or your door if he comes over. Break off ties with him and let yourself heal from what he's done. You will never heal if you keep letting him in! <br>  <br>  Good luck....!|`|70MRFokCaa	wat what men are hearless you know women can eb the same<br>  and not all man only your bf not us<br>  how can you judge us all the same by your bf reaction<br>  and i think he was using you o dump his sorry ask look fro a better man in your life beacuse he will come for yo<br>  hope i get 10 points for helping :)|`|F89MNQheaa	Dont stay with the man who is telling you he is gay.

How about have some self-respect?  Stop wasting your time on something that will never be and move on with your life.  It isn't that this guy is heartless, it's that he resents you for contributing to his confusion. Make it easier for both of you and don't have anything more to do with him.  You've already met someone else, so what are you waiting for?  There's nothing like a new man to get you over the crazy old one!

AA10065812	Yes she can, just as you can, than file for custody while in possession of the child.Sounds like you may need to consider making the first move.<br>  <br>  Looking at your question history, you are a bit of a doting father.  Most of your questions are about your children.  If you want to move first, here's what you need to know,<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>|`|veZLfnGFaa	Yes, they can and will if they get a chance.  Why do you put up with her and her boyfriend?  You could get custody of your child since she acts this way.|`|wqgEo3gyaa	No, depending on state law.  Do you pay child support through the court system?  Is everything legal on your end?  If so, no she cannot.  If you two do not have legal agreement over your child, she can do as she wants.  Take intiative----can you be the better parent?  If so, leave with your child before she does.  She sounds like an idiot.  And this child is so important.|`|GKPY3t56aa	Well, you really would be best to start building a case against her. Document all of the things that prove you to be the better parent. File for divorce and ask for full custody. You will need a lawyer.|`|R3OV3TJeaa	Get a divorce and get custody papers.  Then if she takes off with the child she'll go to jail.  But while you guys are married, I'm not sure if she'll get into trouble...|`|mCM363I9aa	no she can get in trouble|`|1IyzZTpjaa	They can try, and most will end up losing custody of the child for doing it. Vindictive parenting is not looked upon favorably by the courts. Your best recourse is to start documenting events that are going on. So if she does try to take off with the child you will have evidence to go to court with. <br>  <br>  People who use their children to threaten or get back at a spouse or partner do not deserve to have that child.  <br>  <br>  One of my Daughters friends took her child, left the state and wouldn't let the Dad see him. The Dad now has full custody and Mom gets to see him for an hour a week. She was lucky she got that much.

We're just evaluating.|`|NvRHYkuiaa	Men are visually stimulated. We see the physical before anything else, so the chest is the first thing. I try and look in her eyes first though.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Because girls have boobs.  Whether or not they are covered up, they are still boobs.  It's a natural reaction.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Guys are drawn to breasts because they dont have them, I bet if they did they would play with them all the time LOL|`|vwoqIUR6aa	LOL, what a stupid question.
fwUfEMvRaa	Your first responsibility is to your wife and children.  Your sisters were being horribly rude to your wife and it should of been stopped a LONG time ago.  There is a lot of anger and resentment on your wife's part about this and I can understand that.  <br>  <br>  As for the verbal abuse, that was stupid of you and self-serving.  It is one thing to say: "a bunch of pigs live in this house."  it is yet another thing to say that your kids are retards....self-serving again.<br>  <br>  You need to fix your marriage and if your church is telling you to divorce for any other reason except for adultery, you should find another church.  <br>  <br>  Both you and your wife are at fault and both of you need to grow up.  Stop being so concerned about your own wants and needs and start caring about the other person.  If you can fix your marriage you can save your family.  God speed to you.|`|JCVvvKjuaa	i think you should go home and talk to her tell her how you fill bc know matter what your kids love you in need you there in their life(speaking from experience with my dad)|`|KqdhWG1maa	I feel sorry for you my friend. I am 55 yrs old, been married twice. Married now and I know it can be very trying at times. I think you should go talk to some professionals.. and get opinions from them.  <br>  You are in a real bad state of affairs right now and only some professional help will get you through it.  <br>  My opinion anyway,  Goodluck to you.|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	There have been times when I really feel like I hate my husband. I tell him that I hate him and tell him lots of other things too. It's just the anger that takes over. When our husbands don't back us up on the way that we feel, (especially because you know for a fact that your sister mistreated her) we tend to blow up. I can understand where both of yall are coming from. Both of you should apologize and leaving isn't gonna solve anything.|`|0L2wWANcaa	Pretty complicated for sure. I have been to 2 counsellers with my wife and ended it yesterday but at least the issues are a little clearer in my mind so I can move  on. There was no abuse physically but we both had anger issues. Our children are full grown so that was not a factor either. I just wish you the best and no matter how bad it is it will get better . Good luck to you and your family|`|2keIEMFUaa	I think you both and the kids need get some kind of counseling very soon, and yes you should go home.  I think you both should get involved in a church and take your kids too.  You both need to stop fighting, yelling, etc. what you need to do is sit down and listen to each other and love one another and forgive one another.  God help this lost family in your son Jesus Christ Amen.|`|6BSHkiugaa	I am a woman that has not been physically abused but very verbally abused by her spouse for 17 years.  I must admit that his abuse has lead me to smack him across the face many times.  What I would really like from him but never get is a sincere apology and an acknowlegement of the hurt he has caused.  If you love your family you need to say you are truly sorry and mean it and change some how.  Good luck I am sure it is hard.|`|AA11895524	Well, take it from someone that has been on the other end of the inlaws abuse.  I have the motherinlaw from Hell and my husband never stood up for me.  So, I can see her point.  There are 2 sides to every story however.  The only thing I can suggest is marriage counseling and that will only work if both of you want to save the marriage.  It just depends on how much damage has been done on both sides.  I wish I knew what to tell you.  It's a hard situation to be in.  Good luck to you.
pblY82mWaa	first, u gotta clear it up. make sure u know what it is she can't take, then tell her that u wanna fix it, and that u want to keep the friendship alive.<br>  I've kinda been in this situation, but the other way around<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I hope everything works out.

The worst he is going to say is that he was "just" flirting nothing more. If not he has his opportunity to tell you if he is interested in you.  If he's not interested collect and move on.|`|PFm1dI55aa	He might just be a flirty guy. Befriend him before doing anything else.
5Xp59a3Iaa	My fiancee and I are expecting a little girl in late may/early june and I can already tell that he's going to be playing the protective daddy part.<br>  <br>  He's a marine and kind of pulls the "macho man" **** out on me sometimes, so I figured for sure like any other guy he'd want a boy, but suprisingly he can't wait to have this little girl. she's going to be a daddy's girl for sure.<br>  <br>  I asked him this question once, even though she's not even here yet, and he said that when you have a boy and you're a father you're in the mind set of "I'm going to teach you how to fight, how to be a man, how to play sports, etc" and when you're having a daughter it's a much more tender thing and he too used the words delicate frail and precious.<br>  <br>  so i guess with a boy it's a "training" thing, and with a girl it's a "nurture and protect" thing.|`|AA10043878	Three reasons: (1) Thier daughters can get pregnant and the sons can't. (2) Most fathers (and men in general for that matter) know that a female; especially a young one; has a MUCH greater chance of becoming a victim of crime than does a male/son, and; (4) men are just naturally more protective of thier women.|`|Zn6aOSkhaa	Think would you want your 17 year old daughter out at 11:00 pm?<br>  would you care if it was your son? would you be as harsh on your son?<br>  it is different because women / daughters are flowers - delicate and beautiful && angels. while sons/men are  a overgrown bush with thorns .|`|jfwmelYgaa	It's human nature for fathers.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Because he was once a teenage boy with raging hormones and he knows what guys are thinking.

Most you can join free.  There are many single ladies who are interested and looking for couples, there are also single men ( often too many of those but hey, a guy can try!). You can also try going to a nightclub and picking up a woman there. BTW threesome, foursome does NOT equal divorce. LOL. Swingers have a higher rate of satisfaction and lower rate of divorce than the rest of the population. Plus it's fun. We have done it and had a good time and all the worries we had turned out to be seeds planted by a society that does not have a normal view of sex. Our marriage is BETTER now that we opened ourselves up to each other more sexually.

It sounds like your mother might not have a big objection to the "living together" thing if she did it herself, but I think I would try to make sure they were comfortable with the situation rather than just announcing it. Perhaps the bigger issue is: do they like him, and would living with him be agreeable?|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	ask her. theres not much else to do, unless he would like to start sneaking around. and besides, youre more than at the age to make decisions about your life by yourself. so, be an adult, and talk to your mother about the possibility of him moving in. present that he would help with the bills.... and that should be the only thing you need to say.... unless the house is too small and adding another tenant would just be too much.|`|xcPO9Io2aa	well, the only way is to talk to ur parents about it. they're the only ones that can tell u the answer. II'm sure its gonna be fine unless ur parents r really strict|`|AA11367901	I would ask her. After I made sure it's what I wanted to do.|`|NC9FV8bLaa	Talk to your mom about it.  I'm sure it will be ok.|`|ZCTaWveqaa	yeah you should, why not? I mean, you're 21, you're almost done with school, hes going to medical school, you haven't got pregnant, you seem to be really happy with eachother, this is a coming of age thing. Its time to start things like this, and all the stabilty and responsibility seems to be there|`|mRWAn2vHaa	Since your parents are paying you should ask them first of all.  I personally do not recommend that you live with him.  That is my personal opinion.  You have to do what is best for you and learn from your experiences.  From my experiences, I do not recommend it. But definitely ask your parents first. Best of Luck.|`|VssLCEhGaa	Ask her first, even though he may be helping with the rent some people get uncomfortable with new people in their territory.

5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Did he REALLY call her in front of you or did he make a phone call to someone else making you think that he called her and told her that??? <br>  And why would he need to "mess" with some other womens head in the first place when he has you? YES i would say something had gone on and you need to find out exactl what it was|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah home boy is full of sh!t, leave a love letter around so he could see it then tell him that you are only messed with the dude head, men are such idiot.|`|IvMPh09baa	first off, what does she mean by "i hate that you have a man" ... doesn't he have you... a woman??? whats with the whole man thing?<br>  <br>  uh... yea, if he's talking to someone on a cell phone with that type of language that indicates cheating to me.  <br>  <br>  Its really up to you and what you consider cheating in your relationship, does it only have to be physical for it to be cheating?  I mean.. the text messages are leading to something.. and its definitely going to be physical.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	If he did this then the next time he will do more.  If he really loved you and was happy then he would not have done what he did.  He is being unfaithful to you by doing what he did and he has no respect for you.

If it were me I would have gotten rid of him when I found out.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	So, playing with someone's head isn't beneath him eh? Hmm, maybe he's playing with your head.

Will he tell you more than you already know?! Of course not. I would definitely say he is cheating. He might have called her and told her he doesn't give a damn about her and that he loves you. That doesn't mean he didn't cheat with her.|`|WjxqhZG9aa	I would consider that cheating regardless of whether anything physical happened or not.  If there was something missing in your marriage, he should communicate that to you, and put forth the effort given to her into your marriage.|`|MYbRICxqaa	He is definitely tempted to cheat on you. I hope he is telling the truth to you.|`|Awywcn2Caa	If my husband did that he would be out the front door so fast he wouldn't even know what happened. The End!!|`|R0U4qy6haa	he is full of bs-i have played those games before|`|CQsD09D6aa	R u gay? Maybe he is interested in women again. It happens|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Did you tell him to call her and say them things to her if that's the case it doesn't count because he will tell her you put him up to it and he didn't mean the things he said. She will believe him because he will convince her like he did you and everything will be good between them. Men will do and say anything and i do mean anything to stop the wife from attacking him and questioning him about another woman. Your husband is a lair and a cheat i know you still don't believe that he cheated on you not really. You are still in denial listening to that inner voice saying it isn't true he wouldn't do that to me. A lot of us women been where you are right now and even though it hurts just to think he might have cheated it's nothing compared to when you find out the whole truth about what he's been doing.  It's the lying that hurts more then anything because this is the man you been sleeping beside and believed in. He is the one who tells you over and over how much he loves you  just to turn around and stab you in the back and lie right to your face it's unbearable. Your heart will break in a million pieces and you will understand why it's called a broken heart because your heart actually aches. I sure hope for your sake it isn't true but i wouldn't count on it he does fit the profile sorry to say. My husband cheated on me that's why i can say with all certainty that your husband has been cheating on you. Call the number and talk to the girl if you don't believe. She will more then likely deny everything but you will know by some of her answers.Don't let him have his cake and you with it.|`|naequcqlaa	IF it was just a "cell phone thing" why did she say she couldn't wait to see him!  Who is he trying to kid anyway.  To me, that's a far cry from just doing a cell phone thing, that sure sounds like the "real thing".  Who's kidding who!  Yes, I'd say from experience he sure is full of it, & is in over his head.  I once had an "ex" who went back & forth between me & a bar maid g/f he picked up.  Yes, I was a fool for taking him back time & time again.  But, when he was w/me, he'd call her before he came up for bed to say good nite & assure her he was "sleeping alone"...I caught him, butted in on the conversation & told him to get up to bed, & that we only had one bedroom & we BOTH shared it when he was "home" w/me.  He got mad, but did come up to bed tho.  Notice I said an "ex" tho!  What a fool I was. Kept hanging in thinking it would get better?  No way.  His last call to come home I had it, accepted the fact this was never going to change & got the courage to finally say NO.  Haven't seen him in 20 yrs.!!!  Guess he sure got the message. I lost a ton of weight off my shoulders & have been just fine since.  Only time w/tell w/your situation tho, but I DO wish you the very best.  Remember...do NOT accept the unacceptable - ever..you'll be OK if you remember that one thing!  Good luck...:)|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Yes he is full of it.<br>  I confronted my husband about calls to other women on his cell phone.  He told me they were only friends.  The idiot that I was believed him.  Turned out he ****** all his 'friends'.<br>  Always assume the worst and become proactive.  You should not have alerted him yet.  Next time when you get the clue, try to put them all together first.  Try to catch him in the act if you can.|`|fwUfEMvRaa	Full of crap!  He wanted to cheat....was trying to cheat.....so he is a cheater.  So what if you too have grown apart.  That doesn't give him a license to "try" to cheat.  Cheating is cheating and I wouldn't trust him anymore.  This goes to show you that if your relationship ever has any problems he will find "companionship" elsewhere.  Get rid of him.  He isn't worth saving.|`|oqLqPwsJaa	Sounds to me like cheating. Cheating doesn't always have to be physical. Just because he called her and told her that doesn't mean that he wont find another one or even make excuses to this one and say he didn't mean it. He is def full of it and you don't deserve that. Good luck. Hope everything works out for you both! <br>  <br>  =]|`|mtOVRAnbaa	He's full of it.. I went through the same thing with an ex..!! and nobody would be "going crazy" thinking about somebody that they never met.. ask her yourself!! Talk to her yourself and find out the details... although hurtful could save you alot of grief later!! good luck and god bless! <br>  <br>  PS - It doesnt hurt to have a friend with you while you call her!|`|vPvYTPpvaa	from experience he cheated even though he didn't mess with her physically he did have her number and was texting her and even though he called her in front of you and said what he said dont mean anything cause he could probally have someone else on the slide|`|srAP6Vzvaa	hey Sheerini khanoom this guy of yours sounds like he is playing head games with you. for sure he is going to cheat on you sooner or later. im willing to bet your not taking care of him in the bed-room like other typical persian wives.|`|ff3Gcd5Oaa	He may not have cheated yet, but yup, he's full of it and if he hasn't cheated yet he's planning to. "Companionship" my big fat as*.|`|e76db008802a0af7f18fe0b86a6c24a2aa	cheater!|`|r90FAtrjaa	he is trying to have it both ways, bust him out|`|43CAj5M8aa	Messing with her mind my butt. I think he's cheating on you. Being a guy myself who has cheated before I would have to say that either that's just the beginning of him cheating on you or he already has. You need to ask yourself something. Why is he cheating? I know that it's not moral to cheat, but after I got caught and barely saved my marriage my wife and I talked and found out why I cheated. My wife didn't show me any affection. That's one reason I cheated. I found someone who gave me what she wouldn't. Now things are good with us. Cheating is not the answer though. I only wish I would have went to counseling to get things out in the open instead of cheating. Talk to your man. Find out what he lacks in your relationship.
MVY8xhXlaa	as a former "shy guy" i can give you a few hints<br>  <br>  1. DON'T focus on his shyness- it will be the focal point of your relationship- b.a.d.<br>  <br>  2. DO act normal, maybe get him laughing a bit so he relaxes<br>  <br>  3. DON'T give up- it's just a matter of time and you guys will be the best of friends<br>  <br>  4. DO act like he's in charge- it's humiliating to a guy to think the girl has more confidence than he does|`|jqFpxJ1Xaa	Take a chance and talk to him instead of waiting for him to talk to you. Maybe you should ask him why he's so shy for and what you guys could do to get over that.<br>  <br>  I think he does want to be your friend but he's just too shy.|`|bt6aHbc0aa	he probably likes you, just open up and he will too!|`|0rBEqVtHaa	he's into you....|`|nzAaOK0Kaa	He sounds like hes a shy guy, and also kinda into you but just doesn't want to show it in public, you can always try to get him to open up a little with out being to pushy, like asking "hey you seemed a bit sad at school today is everything ok" and he may say no and then start talking about it and then he might feel more closer to you or he might say "yea just some stuff happening" and just offer to listen to him and if he doesn't want to talk accept that and reassure him that your always there to listen and if he says"yea just some stuff happening don't worry about it" the once again respect that and let him know your always there. If he says"Oh am I" just say "Oh i just seems though cause when ever i walk past you, you have your head down, i was just wondering if you were ok" then whatever happens happens and that question will most likely reveal the type of guy he is and weather he's into you or not.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                               Hope i helped =D|`|vhUj6rTnaa	hes probably just shy. open up a little more and mayby he will too.  Theres also the chance that he likes you so that could be a reason.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	He likes you.  Make him laugh because shy guys love when girls have a sense of humour.
AA12135516	Be alone as little as possible because that's when you mope around the house & your brain starts working overtime & you get more depressed. Even though you don't feel like socializing or even talking with friends, force yourself to do it & keep active. I used to try to tire myself out cos i hated going to bed at night & just lying there awake thinking & crying. Time helps heal even though i do know that's not much help to you at the moment!|`|JLFGfaC3aa	Time is the only thing. After a while, you eventually start to forget the little things about the person and it slowly just fades away I guess. I myself had to get over someone that I loved for 2 years as well, (about a year ago) and I'm pretty much over them. Just don't think about it.

hs793CCxaa	What goes in, comes out - check his diet and how it is cooked! Fast food is full of MSG amongst other things - it doesn't do ANYONE any good. MSG is put in food JUST to make it more addictive i.e. they want you to buy it again and again. <br>  <br>  Fried food won't do him any good either. I don't know of anything in the body that should make it smell so bad - it goes in, is filtered, broken down and excreted. There must be a problem along the way!|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Sometimes my husbands poop stinks so bad it makes me want to throw up lmao.<br>  <br>  So i know how you feel|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Adding whole grains, and more veggies to his diet would do wonders.

I would think that someone who eats healthy foods wouldn't stink up the whole house.  My husband doesn't.  He eats well and is not overweight.  I bet your hubs is ingesting a lot of crap.<br>  <br>  I have a female coworker who stinks up the bathroom.  She has irritable bowel syndrome and I think that has something to do with it. <br>  <br>   Get one of those air fresheners that you can set on a timer to go off every 15 mins.  That ought to keep you covered.|`|AA12244965	Could be a number of reasons. Might want to use a vent more often, air fresheners, open windows, and/or have him eat healthier. Diet plays the biggest part though. For instance, smokers have pretty nasty smelling poop compared to regular peeps.|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Diet and likely lack of fiber.  But everybody's body is different.

Too much meat, junk food, fried food can cause that.  You may want to consider a healthier diet and you will see the changes.  Also he may have too much bad bacteria in his intestines.  You may suggest drinking acidophilus milk and eating yogurt.  Drink lots of water too.  Good luck.|`|pJJyH3vhaa	Ask him to eat more whole grain products, vegetables and fruit.

But if he does contact you see what he says. Give him time to think about this big piece of news you dropped in his lap.<br>  Why are you trying to get over him? Is he married? Are you married? Are you underage? <br>  It's hard to say if he is givng you space or if he's sick of you. So wait this out. Give it a couple weeks then email him back to say hi. See what happens.|`|aigFTh1Vaa	wait for him to call you back and don't worry about it. trust me if he really likes you then he talk to you again if not you dont want anyone like that|`|DRoSTA0Baa	u should stop emailing him and find someone new.

Passwords to accounts and all that this is a abusive relationship classic, the twist is it's the guy being abused this time. You need help.

ZOakpNy7aa	Sorry to be so blunt but i have to. He is not becomming attached to you He is playing games with you. If he intended on anything more that a good time with you he would have let you know about his girlfriend. And if he is bringing her up now he is just preparing you for the big brush off.What he is doing, Is planning ahead. He is telling you that you r getting mad, He is setting the stage to make it look like he had to dump you because you were turning into a jealous fatal attraction psyco, Then he dont look like the cheating,using,womanizing jerk that he is. use your common sense,Think it out make sure things fit make sure that what is going on makes total sense. And if you pull your mind away from what he is telling you and analize the whole situation. You will know if its real or if you need to get your head out of the love cloud and see that you r being treated as no more than his personal whore. Because long as u are the other woman you r the one he has no respect for. And you will soon loose respect for yourself because you r taking the back seat to another woman. waiting for your time and sneaking around.

If he's leary about what people are thinking about the two of you then he doesn't respect you or maybe he felt you were being possessive by touching him and letting other's know he's taken...who knows what was going through his mind & if this relationship is purely physical, you shouldn't care.|`|AA11436843	get rid. simple. this guys a cheating liar who wants his cake and eat it.....and you're the one letting him get away with it    you're worth more than that...get rid of him and find someone worthy of you|`|hitKzYhBaa	Our reasoning factors can get so off track when our hormones  get involved. If you guys really enjoy the intimacy with each other  leave it at that. Try not to figure out what the other is really trying  to let you know. Because sometimes they are just as not sure  of what they are trying to say as you are in figuring it out. He  has a girlfriend, not a wife so number one he has other ties which  he has not severed and it is possible to love more then one person.  If we continue to try to understand why a person acts the way the  do it becomes a ball of confusion and interrupts the pleasure we  are getting from this relationships and then things can end badly  or just end .

Just a thought...they might be able to count up to 4 and know what 2+2 equals up to.     Why are you waiting for his approval to keep your distance? If that's what you want to do, just do it, regardless of what he prefers. From what you say, it's not obvious what YOU  expect out of this. Do you want a more committed relationship with him, are you happy with the fling but want it to be less intense? Forget for one minute his wants and consider what you want.     As for being a problem, sounds like the only problem he has is Mr. Happy between his legs. You are not the problem and neither is the gf...he is his own problem. He's just trying to pass off this blame so he can sleep at night and look at himself in the mirror. C'mon, you deserve better than this, and if you don't think you do, then sorry hun, but he's already put you in your place: the other woman.

zgKBpvsYaa	I would seek the advice of a counselor on how you can deal with your anger.  I think if you hold all your emotions in and or ignore your situation your anger can turn into something different...possibly something a lot more serious.  It's important that you take bullying seriously and not just brush it off as something that people have to "tough out." <br>  As for those bullies there are a couple of things that you can do: 1. Avoid the bully and walk with a friend so that your not alone with the bullies. 2. Learn to control your anger.  Bullies tend to thrive on getting a reaction from you.  Therefore the better you can control your anger the less you would seem like a visible target.  Things like counting backwards are a great stress reliever.  3. Be brave, walk away, and ignore the bully.  Firmly tell the bullies to stop, walk away, and ignore their remarks and act like your not interested. <br>  <br>  If things still persist I would seek the advice of a counselor, teacher, parent, or someone that would listen and take you seriously.  Find someone that can help you with your situation.  Please don't ignore such things.  That's the worst thing that anyone could do.|`|lfWacvfnaa	lol|`|0xWb3YDmaa	It's called ignoring them and getting ovr ur anger|`|iflwrl1Gaa	pffft you think you've got problems<br>  you'll live
8t0DlWf8aa	moms are stupid some times..they want their children to find a reach boy/girl-friend..forget what she told you..she was lieing|`|mwrSbSVuaa	Okay, there's a couple of things here...How old are you?  If mommy thinks you are delusional and you are quite young, she may have a point.  If you aren't so young, mommy may be freaking out that her baby boy is in love or thinks he is in love.  Moms have issues with that sometimes because they have always been the leading female authority and now she's not so much.  Talk to the guy, I assume he's a boyfriend, and see what he has to say.  He knows her better than you do and may be able to explain a few things about her.  Just be gentle because chances are if she's freaking out over him being in love, he'll freak out thinking you are talking "bad" about his Mom.  Its called being a "Momma's boy", if you like him romantically, get used to it.  There's no changing her.  It's not all bad, though, if you can find ways to relate to her it will help a lot.  Or, your guy will have to grow a set and set some boundries with her (not likely by the way).Good Luck!!!  I've been there.  It CAN work, you just REALLY have to try.|`|1z8ttGFZaa	has her son done anything for you not to trust him?    and as far as his MOTHER goes....forget her because she cant tell what her son is really feeling, only he knows...  moms tend to do that because they dont like who their son/daughter is dating and most of the time they have already talked to their son/daughter trying to convince them to break up with their current bf/gf and they wont so they stoop low enough to go to the bf/gf feeding them a lot of Bs causing hurt so that maybe she can still get her way.

Same for not so amazing breasts..they are just bumps on your chest to you...but they are far more then that to a guy.<br>  2.You could fix that acne problem.  Plenty of stuff is available at the store.  And even soap and water can help..and not eating the wrong foods.  And if all else fails, there is always make-up.<br>  3.Never hurts to look good...get a tan, fix up your hair and such.<br>  4.Nice clothing.<br>  5.Self-confidence is the tricky one.  You could tell yourself that at least a dozen guys or so at school like you right now.  And at least 20-30 do in your hometown, and so on.

"Double dates" are what become most common. Your daughter might call it a date, but from personal experience it's not much of a true date. You just have to be open and let your daughter experiment if you will. <br>  The best advice I could give you is to be open. If you seem cool with letting her date and letting her go out with boys she will come to you with the information about who she's going with and things like that, but if you make it seem like she is so lucky that you are letting her do this, she might not be as open and tell you how the date went and things like that. <br>  Just test the waters and see what fits for your family. It'll all work out. <br>  But don't hover! Give her space. Girls who feel like they don't have any space will try to do worse things, if they feel like they are aloud to do something they will have less of a desire to do it!<br>  <br>  -Good luck (:|`|1Wgzz6OHaa	I'm looking for a girlfriend and I would probably say 14 is the right dating age. If you find out she has a boyfriend, you should probably meet him ASAP! Don't go overboard with requirements or else she might be likely to rebel and find an extremely inappropriate boyfriend. My girlfriend, who recently moved to Texas, was extremely nice and her parents wanted to know I was safe. I found out I got along with her father well, which is always a good thing. I'm almost 15 now, I was 13 when I met her but we didn't start dating until we were both 14. Tell your daughter it's a good thing if she has a friendship with a boy before she thinks about dating him. It's a good way to find common ground and it makes for a less harsh breakup if there is one.|`|5VHWy0Ggaa	i have a boyfriend who i've been with a year and a month, and i'm going to be 20 in less than a month... i've never really had any restrictions on dating though.<br>  <br>  when i was younger, sure i liked boys and had crushes, but i never really dated anyone. dates below middle school aren't even really considered dates. dates might be "hanging out." like watching a movie or going to the mall with that person... which they will need supervision, because they can't drive... but maybe they could go do their own thing while you're all at the mall.<br>  <br>  i would say that in middle school, i would have the birds and bees talk with her. my mom never talked with me about relationships or sex. be VERY open and honest with her. tell her that if she has any questions, you will answer them truthfully... this will open up communication between the two of you, and she will come to you with anything and everything. you may say that eventaully you don't want to know, but you really need to know. that way you can set boundries and limits... and even protect her, if that's what you have to do.<br>  <br>  if you do not allow her to date, and meet boys, still will resent you and eventually rebel. just follow your instincts because in the end everything will turn out. but really take my advice about explaining relationships and sex! because my mom never did, and i know when i have kids that's one thing i won't forget to do. i had to learn by myself through various sources. and not all of them were good... <br>  <br>  hope this helped :)|`|GegQJNzSaa	I think maybe 14 and daylight only,with lots of friends. I don't know what kids like to do anymore, mine liked to hit the mall. I roller skated,lol dated myself aye?Its hard to say when,boys are trying pretty hard before 14 to get there way. I guess if you feel she has good self esteem and is prepared for whats in front of her then somewhere around 13-14. None of my daughters got pregnant as a teen. I don't think any of them cryed over any boy for more then a week either. But then I never shut up about sex and broken hearts for years. My oldest says she will use my tactic on her kids.She just wanted me to shut up when she was 12. She is 31 now.I have a nineteen yr old and she is a happy kid. I guess what I am saying is 13,and never shut up again.

AA11353473	What a concidence!<br>  My best friend and I went to the movies today, her boyfriend went, didn't say ANYTHING to her at all, and after that, when he lefted, he texted her saying that he's really sorry.<br>  He was probably nervous, and didn't know what to say.<br>  You should tell him that it's okay, and not be shy (:<br>  EDIT - don't listen to the other answerers that say that he doesn't like you if he does that.

Was it agreed upon that you both were bringing a friend, or was your friend a surprise to him?<br>  If your friend coming was unexpected by him, then he may have thought that he and his friend could take advantage of you, and he was pissed off. <br>  If you both agreed to bring a friend, then maybe his friend was saying stuff about you and/or your friend. <br>  Whatever the case, he couldn't really like you, and treat you this way.<br>  Don't waste your time on this guy. Even if he does like you, why would you want to be involved with a guy who treated you like crap, and was acting like a total jerk? Even if he comes up with an excuse for why he did it, I would be very cautious with being alone with him, or getting too involved with a guy that acts like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.|`|2uXNtCUlaa	Yes he likes you he just is shy when you come up to him, he probably gets nervous because he does not know how you are feeling towards him. He obviously cares about you enough to text you and apologize for his behavior. I would say continue to talk to him some more, and when you feel more comfortable with him ask him out on a date but this time one on one. He will soon let his guard down around you. And begin to show you his true feelings. Best of luck|`|1zfwLsQpaa	He might like you but he is shy<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  He thinks he might like you but at others he realizes he doesnt so he ignores you<br>  <br>  he might have been pissed of the third person coming|`|m7VBQskEaa	uhm,if he doesnt wanna talk to you,he obiously doesnt like you|`|2n1D5TDRaa	mam u have a different case let me  give my view as i m boy i know why that guy ignoring u because so that u will think about her.   try to show attitude to him slowly i really say mam he is going to attract  towards u.    thanks|`|rC7l2BHlaa	Girl, obviously if he isn't going to talk to you when he's with friends then that kid don't like you. <br>  <br>  I'd say sorry but I'm not.|`|5ojgFcmGaa	maybe he was shy to act a certain way around his friend|`|NV9lGq87aa	he likes u but he doesn't want to show in front of his friend
v1yefcFjaa	hey sometimes you need to stand up for yourself. you know shes your mom and she has taken care of you for your whole life but by now you should have a good understanding of whats right and whats wrong. if your mom is yelling at you for no reason and you feel that it's wrong for her to do that then the best thing you can do is to stand up for yourself and say something. finding a job right now is tough but take what you can even if it's minimum wage. save every cent from your paycheck until you find a better job thats more secure and then move out when you have the money.     im not saying that you should just be disrespectful to your mom when she's wrong. im saying that you should give respect when you get respect.    Kids do not automatically owe their parent respect when they're born, respect definitely has the be earned. for example, you wouldn't expect a kid who was getting beat by their parents to respect them. like i said, respect needs to be earned from the parents and the kids.
vn2Lq7hIaa	Be accommodating to the chap, he's not breaking any laws. Right now he's fifteen,smoking, drinking, and skipping school, tomorrow his hormones will go crazy and he will diddle chic's too. All sort of normal stuff.    A chap at that age knows everything, there is little room for your advise, so let him take some hard knocks, they'll prove to be valuable lessons later in life.      I think you and your sisters role should be one of acceptance, without encouragement. Be there to and praise his accomplishments, and share the disappointments. Giving  love without constraints will show your confidence in him.     He will mature, and become a fine young man, because you LET HIM grow into one. Should he become a Father one day, the recollections of today will be a guiding light.     Good Luck in car sales, down one for me when it's slow!    God Bless|`|YVO3WyU1aa	Start leading him by example and stop being a hypocrite. good luck|`|RX9rGdXAaa	KKEP UP THE GOOD WORK!|`|7fdTdpfuaa	eh.. what exactly does he smoke?? weed?? well when i started smoking weed my gpa went way up high... maybe you should consider marijuana!!|`|ygimTNzoaa	Well ultimately its his decision. You can talk to him say is this what you want with your life, what I'm doing. You'd like a mobile home and try to make yourself sound like your not happy with your life. Say he still has a good chance to get something worth while going for his life he just needs to kick it up a notch and if he needs any help you will help him anywhere you can. I guess that's all you can really say right?|`|t0uIgY08aa	tell him how you feel, and what you would like him to be in life. But in all honesty it is his life and he will live it as he pleases. Your not a bad influence, it could be kids in school. I'm sure he doesn't remember your high school days. Thats where the influence comes from. But if he looks up to you, you should talk to him, and maybe he will actually listen... Good luck|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Don't do all that bad influence stuff in front of him.  Maybe have a talk about him about the importance of education, and how if you had a chance, you would've rather had gone to college and become something more.   ^-^|`|U34YHAyLaa	You have to be smart, and also ambitious and work hard.  If you're setting an example of not working hard, then he might be copying you.  He needs to see that for himself and start working hard in school.|`|BshLygwSaa	The best thing for you to do in my opinion and sit down and have a talk with him. Let him know that you don't want him to grow up and be like you because you feel that you need to make a lot of improvements but let him know what you would like for him to be when he grows up. If he doesn't want to be that then that's cool as well. Also try to not drink around him or smoke and let him see you doing it. He may be following in your footsteps so just let him know that you stopped drinking and smoking and be more educated. Help him with his school work. Give him some good pointers on life because as you know life is hard once you get older.|`|lsODR7A0aa	Let him know that skipping school will only hurt him in the long run. Try get him involved into different things take him golfing for bowling one night. When you are around him don't drink and not let him drink or smoke. He is not old enough and don't let him do it around you.    You can't make him be a doctor or a lawyer, you need to try and get him involved in other things to sway him away from the negative|`|ifMWpeA0aa	Talk to him.|`|ti3AEcIFaa	sit down and talkk to him and tell him how you fell.|`|c09e1f232acd578a9f591c5b83a68f43aa	Why don't you have a talk with him about how he sees his future and ask him if he had ever thought about any of the things you had imagined for him?|`|2rXWZkbnaa	You have to talk with him. Tell him that you dont want him ending up like you, then list all the bad things that have happened because you didn't get your education. This is good that you care like this and you still can go back to school and get your college diploma. Also this will show him that its good to go to college. It will benifit both of you. If you cant go to college during the day because of work then take an on line class.|`|gb9REJN4aa	It sounds like you're a pretty great uncle. But what you need to do is make it clear to him that he isn't impressing you with what he's doing. Next time you're hanging out or working on cars or whatever, just ask, "Are you going to go to college?" And no matter what he answers, you say, "You know, I never went to college, but you're really smart and you should be a doctor or lawyer or something. You could really make something with your life. I'm here living in this mobile home and selling used cars, and you know, it really works for me and I enjoy this chill kind of life (if you do--you can also say, "you know, I hate it," but only if you do, and it sounds like you don't)--but you could really make something even better of your life."    Then--and this is the hard part--you've got to just out and say that he needs to not skip school. That's the biggest issue out of all of these. If you regret smoking because of addiction or the money-suck, you can say that--but the main thing is to be honest about why you want him to do things differently. Instead of being a hypocrite, it means you're letting him learn from your experience. You can basically just say that.|`|WZVz5jWHaa	You are talking like a father-figure!  Sounds like you've done a very good job helping your nephew grow up without a father.  Just be supportive and help him see he can do wonders with his life.|`|na8ObA5Haa	its not you. he is doing what everyone kid does, GROW up and expierence things, you did it, i did it, now its his turn! let him be... if you hold him back it will only get worse when he turns 18
JyEoCBrJaa	I would wait on that. Maybe when ever you all hang out/go out on a date again. I think maybe the second or third time you should do that. Don't scare him off. Just say you had a nice time after the date and before you go to bed just text him and let him know again that you had a nice time and would like to do it again. If he doesn't get the hint, then by all means ask him do he want to be your boyfriend.|`|rJJKUJpaaa	If you do that it would like a miracle to a shy guy. Of course he would except what kind guy wouldn't|`|JiiSUGkvaa	No, I don't think it's a good idea. You don't want to seem too desperate. Even if you're not hard to get, play that way. Let him make the first move. It'll help boost his confidence. Give him to opportunity to be a gentleman, he'll like that. Oh, and you should save everything you have for the person you're going to marry, that's my opinion :)
2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Oooh, ME!!!!  I absolutely LOATHE those ridiculous games.  Every time I get an invite to a shower, all I can think of is "what kind of excuse can I make so I don't have to go and make a dress out of toilet paper?"  Baby showers are even worse.  The last one I was at had this really gross game where someone had smeared five different kinds of candy bars in five different diapers and we all had to guess by texture and smell which candy bars were which.  I know it was just chocolate, but it made me want to hurl all the same!!  Curiously, in all the "co-ed" showers I've attended, the men seemed to be exempt from these ridiculous games.  Here I am smelling a Kit Kat-smeared diaper and my fiance gets to just chill in the den with a cocktail.  SO UNFAIR!!!|`|29I8PWrxaa	I agree ... but I have to admit that baby showers are much worse than wedding showers.  But it really depends on who the shower is for and what types of games they play or the format of the party.    The worst game I've ever been forced to play was at a baby shower where they passed around these newborn diapers on which they had smeared different types of chocolate bars and we had to guess which brand of chocolate bar it was.  The ones with nuts in them and the Eatmore bars looked absolutely disgusting.  Totally lost my appetite right before they made us eat those little tiny sandwiches and steal each others pins if anyone said the word "baby".|`|sGP6s7uraa	My God, how negative can you ladies be?  Just be a "good guest" and do whatever the mother of the bride or mother to be wants (or is forced) to do.    Half the time, the hostess neglects to ask the bride/mother-to-be what her wishes are pertaining to HER shower.  The games are a display of the hostess's naivity and lack of communication towards their best friend/daughter/cousin/sister's wishes and the ability to throw a successful and "fun" shower for all.  Most hostesses feel obligated to do SOMETHING and (older) tradition has held that games MUST be played.|`|c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	i don't mind games, as long as it's clear that everyone has a choice of participation.  my bridal shower is in march and i hope they don't make it too painful...i guess i have to take part!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I hate the games too! I told my MOH that I don't want games, so we will eat and do gifts. The games put people on the spot and it can cause a bunch of people to be uncomfortable.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I agree... I'd rather just have a "get together" and enjoy each other's companies...  Females and Males...      Maybe a game of bags, or volleyball...     I think the games are there to "keep the guests" there longer, so it's not like they are just dropping off a gift and leaving... And to keep them entertained... But, in my opinion, we either need to get rid of the games or think of something else to bring the group together...    Showers are like high school... You have your different groupies in all the corners....  Ugh.. Can't stand them, haha|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I so despise events of those kinds that when I got married, I did not have a bridal shower - didn't want one.  As a kid, I hated going to them because of the dumb games that always were played - to this day, cannot believe women like this stuff.  It's just not my thing.|`|BUET39wmaa	I AGREE  i friggin hate that format of party    it's for little old raisin grannies and goody two shoes|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Me! I totally hate those ridiculous games.

FYI - should pathetic people do these "childish" games at showers, I never participate - I just zone out!|`|itbkP9HGaa	To each his own!  I always endeavor to be a good guest, and I find that when I go into a situation with a good attitude, I have a much better time.|`|AA12371207	I totally agree!

49Pr5cU3aa	Well...A guy is automatically turned on by women.Girl friend or not.And wrestling with a female is quite the turn on to a guy.Touching her and feeling her as u play rough is sometimes better than getting to the heavy stuff.If he has a girlfriend than you should ask him.Its really simple and if not that ask a source really close to him.maybe hes not really sure what he wants and that's common because all that's left after that is the simple fact HES NOT THINKING.which is the logo for men pretty much even for myself.Be real with him but more importantly be real with yourself.If hes playing games than move on even if you dont want to.It makes you stronger and wiser and u come first over him.  Think about it and tell me what u think.|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	If you already have doubts and you're not even seeing him yet, then move on.|`|oOyXJtNvaa	Sorry to break it to you but i have been in this possition MANY times!    1st boy. a close friend who had a little fling going on with one of my best mates... But i slept with him when i was drunk. He used me and i used him so that wasn't too bad and were still friends.    2nd boy... He was a PLAYER!! he had slept with 9 girls before me, But i didnt let it get to me and like a fool i slept with him a few times after some 'harmless flirting' Then he asked me out and after a month he cheated on me, got with my friend. We're still friends after a few months of me hating him .. He's slept with over 25 girls these days!    3rd boy.. I was drunk. Barely knew the boy, had sex with him at a party, got used by him big time! havent spoke to him since :(  Found out a few days later he had a girlfriend... in my school and she HATES me.    4th boy.. i just don't learn my lesson!  This is the one that sounds alot like your story.  I got friendly with him, started hangin out at his place, flirting all the time, just like the way you described. After a few nights sleeping at his place in his bed i was determained not to sleep with him. But one night i did... a few times. We still talk now and then but its obvious he only pretented to like me for sex.    Is the message obvious?... Boys pretend they are interested just for sex. Do not let yourself get hurt like i have been in the past year!|`|l7T0Ac3faa	he is a player don't waste your time with him..he likes attention but if you give it to him ..he's already use to that so he'll see you as any other girl ..so move on then he'll realize "why don't she like me??"" then come back ..if you really want a player you have to play hard to get but be careful cuz he could still play you|`|YVVK3ELTaa	You say you 'hear' he has a girlfriend. That's just it, they're rumors, may be true rumors, but you never know unless you ask him.  He seems a Little big headed in my opinion, asking you if he thinks you find him attractive and stuff, i mean think about it, i doubt you would have ever asked him first, like 'do you think i'm hot' unless it was like sex talk or something. The guy is kindamysteriouss you need to suss him out lol. xx|`|4dQjVb59aa	maybe he wants to be with you but wants to make sure you feel the same bout him before he leaves his girl talk to him about it

2KC467tFaa	You're single. Now is the time for you to redefine yourself. Volunteer, go to yoga, learn a new skill, take a fun class, learn how to drive a standard or motorcycle. As you learn new things, you'll get a confidence boost and feel empowered from your independence. Learn how to rely on yourself before you start dating again. You'll feel more in control and satisfied with yourself because you'll know exactly who you are. Hang in there, and best of luck to you!|`|FjUZjnSlaa	Meet someone else and talk to them... this is the fastest way. If there is no one else. Keep yourself distracted by putting in more hours at work, hang out with the family. Anything to keep you busy. The first week will be tough, but it will become easier. Also, avoid contact with this person! It only gets harder if you look at their pictures, text, see, or even talk to them.|`|4GnA33s3aa	To get over somebody you have to go and meet other guys and flirt with them. If that doesn't help then try to something that they don't do.That what I did when I try to get over someone.|`|Y9djVW1Naa	Keep yourself busy doing things you love.<br>  When you find happiness from yourself you will be able to find happiness with someone new.|`|Xtkkfm4Jaa	some can get over...some cannot !|`|8ad580cd99c0cf921506c236e4e80b8faa	For what purpose?|`|l43NSgHyaa	Surround yourself with your friends.  Really, it works.  Ask one of your friends to try a new hobby with you or to do an activity that will take up your time and energy.   If you're out and socializing, you'll get over it faster.   You'll be with people who care about you and you'll start to realize you made a good decision and you might even meet a new love interest.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	My grandmother used to say that the cure for one man was another. I am not sure I completely buy it, but I think that once you get out and meet new people and get distracted, it is easier.<br>  <br>  I will say that it took me a long time to get over one of my exes. Partly it is just the way that I am wired-I think about things way too much, even when I don't want to. Even though I am married, every once in a while I will think about him-not because I want to be with him, far from it. It is just my darn brain!|`|8a8CZqGLaa	For me it depended on the guy.<br>  <br>  The first guy I had no problem getting over since I dumped him.<br>  My second boyfriend only lasted a month or two, so I didn't need to get over him.<br>  The third guy I had to taper off of after we broke up. We couldn't quit eachother cold turkey since we were eachother's first loves.<br>  The last guy I dated it took two weeks of bawling to get over b/c he cheated on me, and I'd never been cheated on before and he dumped me for her b/c I didn't find out in time. I got a new boyfriend about a month later who also helped me get over him, and now I'm marrying that man. =)<br>  <br>  So I think depends on what the person meant to you and your relationship on how you get over them.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	lots of chocolate and sappy movies. lol.<br>  All kidding aside it's a good start right there.  Have your best friend's over, get some sappy movies (good to get all the tears out) and get your mind off of him for a night.  Lots of ice cream, some drinks etc. Just a good ole teen-age sleep over type thing.<br>  After that, it takes time.  Don't let yourself sit there idley for too long.  Meaning, get out, and do stuff.  Go out with friends for dinners, maybe join a dance class or something at a local community centre. Exercise is GREAT for getting out frustrations and sadness.  It releases endorphins which make you happy, at least temporarily.<br>  Treat yourself to something special, maybe a massage, a pedicure/manicure, 10 minutes in a tanning bed (another thing that will make you feel GREAT. like visiting a beach for a few minutes).<br>  <br>  In the long run, only time will help.  I know it's cliche but that's cause it's true.<br>  Good luck hun!<br>  <br>  p.s. don't worry about crying. Allow yourself 10 minutes a day to cry. in the shower, in bed, on the couch etc. you pick.  Then after a few days, only know yourself 5 minutes, then 5 minutes every other day and eventually you'll stop. I know it sounds weird, but it really does work.  Don't allow yourself to cry beyond that time period but don't avoid crying all together, then it just builds and builds and you'll end up breaking down somewhere you don't want to (work, at the mall, grocery store somewhere you don't want to lol)|`|Xcyaju2vaa	Day by day. Do not allow yourself to think about him. It takes some major effort to change your thought processes-but you CAN do it! Try something new. Change up your routine-especially try to avoid places you and he used to go. Try exercising! Good luck to you!!|`|a268c12b5ec47775ab6f4e878095ab26aa	go out and meet new people.<br>  Remind yourself of all the perks of being single.<br>  just have a good time flirting and dating other guys.<br>  soon enough youll have forgotten all about your ex.

AA10798898	time heals...but u cannot put a time limit in something like this...|`|Af8LQHR1aa	there is no specific time limit that you have until you finally stop grieving over a death. but obviously it is going to be a while. just imagine if your best friend died. i'm sure you wouldn't be like, oh well i'm over it. and live on normally after like a week. it takes time.|`|belxnL86aa	well considering he/she was your BESTfriend. id say about 3 seconds after their funeral, no longer than that. any longer than 3 seconds and you're considered a gay.|`|zzkmdusEaa	I don't think you can ever be quite over the loss of anyone, let alone a best friend. everyone is different. different people take different amounts of time to heal. So you cant really put a time range on getting over the death of someone close.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Sorry to hear about her loss
GmTMVmASaa	offer to work for it then, and eventually they will stop being angry and probably give you your phone back. don't worry about the mean answers people give, some people are just rude and vindictive and find other peoples problems funny in comparison to their own. your parents love you,and they will forgive you, trust me. hang in there, and ask mom is there anything you can do to help pay that phone bill.:)|`|wDeOJev0aa	Hello,  Your parents probably are upset because they have to pay extra money on a phone bill.  Money is tight these days and they don't need to have more pressure on them.  Try aplogizing to your mom and tell her you will watch your miniutes next time.|`|ScaAyzKHaa	The only way to get your phone back is to accept the punishment without complaint, apologize to your parents (without asking for the phone back, or making any promises), and wait. Don't bring the subject up again because that will just prolong the punishment. Prove to your parents that even though you let them down this way, you are still responsible in other ways (keep your room clean, do chores around the house without being asked, keep on top of homework, etc). You did something wrong, you need to accept it and wait for them to trust you again.|`|acxgIMviaa	get a job and pay for it yourself.    saying sorry wont change a 500 dollar texting bill (my sister did it)    work towards your own|`|AA12012230	I hate to say it, but unless you can afford to pay the bill yourself then you're going to have to deal with it.    If having your mobile off you is the worst thing that has happened to you today you should be grateful, but to me you sound like you're being a baby.     Wipe the tears away, go downstairs and apologise and offer to do some housework (but not on the condition that they give the phone back). If you act like a child- that is how you'll be treated.|`|a2HgB81Haa	Get over it. It was your fault and you probably knew you were running up a huge bill, so take your punishment and get on with you life.|`|Lr75hENEaa	well...i think u should try find the money and pay ur phone bill|`|wGw834Gkaa	You really need to accept your punishment.  No one ran up the bill but you.  You may need to wait until you are more responsible before you get your phone back.  The way things are now days your parents don't need you adding to their $$ worries!!!|`|pve5w0zGaa	pay your own bills if you want independence, untill then listen to your parents, because they are the ones who are paying your bills|`|b81H0vlYaa	Wow.  Get a job to pay for it yourself, then it won't matter how high the bill is as long as you make the money.  I didn't get anything from my parents when I was younger.  I had to buy my own phone, service, car clothes, everything.  I believe all people should learn responsiblity for finances and actions (meaning you should have been more responsible with your cell phone usage).  Just be glad you had it for the amount of time, and stop whining.  If you parents give it back to you, it will be their decision.  ------  Ok, if you are REALLY serious, and you won't get a job, talk to them.  See why you went over, try to think of ways to keep track of how much you use and how to limit it, even if it is carrying around a notebook with you.  Use the land line whenever you can.  Tell them it was an accident, you have learned from it and will do your best to not go over again (and mean it!).  Tell them if you get unlimited texts, you will text anyone out of your network, that way you cannot go over.  And if you do go over, give it up for the next month or two.      Propose a "deal" to earn points.  Your points can be redeemed for cell phone money.  For instance:  wash, dry and fold a load of clothes=3 points  Mow the grass=5 points  Wash and put up dishes=2 points  Clean the bathroom=5 points  Volunteer at a soup kitchen=15 points  Get all "A's" on your report card=10 points  And so on, find things you think your parents would like you to do.  Make sure you earn at least the amount that your cell phone costs them, and then you and your parents can decide what your reward is for the rest of it.  Earn up your overage from last month with points before you get your phone back, so they will see you are serious.    If that doesn't work, consider yourself lucky your parents still have jobs, you have enough food to eat, and you are not suffering from and incurable disease or condition.  In other words counting your blessings always makes me feel better.|`|OP6zAOULaa	Get a job, pay your own bill. When i was in high school i got onto a contract with my parents... and all of a sudden had a 600$ phone bill. find ways to help them pay th bill off instead of begging and pleading. that doesn't work. often. offer to help pay the bill. what i would suggent is getting a job and going with a city carrier. there usually 50$ a month with unlimeted service, although whe you go outside the city limits the phone doesn't work. but it is cheaper and you never go over your minutes. you may also be able to talk them into doing this. if your bill is constantly high this would be a better idea. or leave your phone at home more often so you dont get the urge to use it. This is all apart of knowing how to simplify and only using what recourses you have. I"ve always had a cell phone. but i've always payed my own bill. if you put this to work they may be more leanient on more because your showing responsibility. begging and crying doesn't help. it makes you look 2.
cEuFh0T8aa	if she is not going out with anyone ask her out without telling your friends because they will just keep asking you to ask her and it will get annoying ( if her b-day is before valentines ask her out on her b-day)    if she is make a rumor that will want her to break up with him|`|GbDAfs5Yaa	You can't make anyone like you and giving yourself a deadline means you're just putting more pressure on yourself.

jTV6rLX3aa	Do you ever see your ex? If so, you should talk to him and tell him that you are sorry for what happened between you two and that you still really care for him. Based on his reaction, you should be able to ascertain how he feels for you and how you would like to progress from there. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you are getting a lot of information through the grapevine, although I don't know why his brother would tell you false information. Even then, things can be misconstrued. If you still really care for him, you should try to speak with him in person. If he tells you it's over then you have no choice but to move on and find someone better suited for you.|`|Kbi3Cm41aa	let true love find you|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\|`|ZldKA17Iaa	move on|`|u5HmOfhRaa	move on!|`|VvRHin1Jaa	You should just let him go and move on!|`|vAL1Rahaaa	dang. wow well when i was 11 i fell in love with a 16 year older... and we made out and the next day he dumped me. and i moped in my room for 5 months. but you have to get over it... and move it because they're not worth the wait...|`|e6ffc07866095f4a39c50bd16b9859e5aa	if you love something let it go, If it comes back to you then its yours if it doesn't it never was.

Lets start off with the fact that if parents dont like who u are dating, its better to NOT... goes both ways. they realy will stop at nothing to seperate u two and if it hapends wne ur deeply into it, itll be heart breaking. (ex. my cousin and her ex fiance like 4 days ago wen her fam decided to kik him out cuz they never liked him now shes moving the COUNTRYYY cuz she cant stand being here without him). honestly time heals eveyrthing and u r young (as i assume based on the way u talk and ur situation) thats not to say i dunno how to help cuz ive been a teen and preteen myself.. not too long ago =). so just let time take it course and do as it shud. never get all upset oversomething cuz its really not worth it.. if its meant to happen it will whether u obsess over it or not..so save urself the energy and tears. and if the guy will go for his mom over u thne u dont need him ANYWAYSSS and he didint care enuf. just keep ur head up and stay strong cuz one day u will look at this and laff at how young and foolish u were... been there.. done that.|`|JLEx0jbXaa	just tell his brother to give him your e-mail lol but no seriously just try to talk to him and if he dont want to be bothered then f him.u cant be stuck on the past but im in the same predicamate and this is not my first time. but if he really loves you like you love him he will be back regardless of the other girl he is messing with.i mean u shouldnt have to beg for him back he is the one that did wrong not you.

Cheer up. 2 make u smile bit, read this <br>  Dear Tech Support, <br>  Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and valuable resources. <br>  In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activities, such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Going to the Pub 7.5, and Softball 3.6 <br>  I can't seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my other favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. <br>  Please help! <br>  Thanks, Troubled User..... <br>  ____________________ <br>  REPLY: <br>  Dear Troubled User: <br>  This is a very common problem that men often complain about. <br>  Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!!! It is also impossible to delete Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or purge, the program files from the system once installed. <br>  You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings: Alimony-Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife 1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application Yes Dear 2.7 to alleviate your program problems. <br>  The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE! Because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. <br>  Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance! Wife 1.0 does come with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5, and Do Bills 4.2 <br>  However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag 9.5 once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0 <br>  WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary with Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system! <br>  Best of luck, Tech Support|`|hw3jNGubaa	sure!hug hug! what is wrong|`|WJX994D2aa	yea<br>  *hugs*|`|nETw4eOKaa	ahaha!<br>   Okay.<br>  <br>  Awnser mine please.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj.xmJso82mR90AdaBJZcUvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220221725AAMFh85&show=7#profile-info-nETw4eOKaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|KJzIdPAlaa	*huggies*<br>  :D|`|f2f5de2feea0da330e1b307cdce13ba0aa	heres a virtual hug for you!!!<br>  whats wrong??|`|UxRoUTvCaa	*Hug*|`|cUhcsEcGaa	'YES'.

Women love to feel small compared to a Man. Strength is very attractive and broad shoulders often symbolize just that. Its symbolizes hard working men and women just cant get enough. So to answer your question, I do infact like a man with broad shoulders. Someone who can protect me and make me feel at eaze.|`|IwTkZ4jiaa	yes! <br>  i love broad shoulders, as long as they consist of something other than just fat, you have to have a little muscle in there.<br>  backs and shoulders are the biggest turn on to me and most of soccer team... yea we do have weird locker room conversations, but anyways, hope it helped somehow...|`|d67b3bee942a5faea13b08c9229ffe2baa	i've never really thought about it. depends on a lot of other things. mostly personality. most of the guys i know with wide shoulders are football players and a lot of them are kind of jerks so not really my type so far. <br>  <br>  but many women do, i know that.<br>  <br>  mine??<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiJ8Bii9Hka7CcEg83BWQWbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220195241AA66VGK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|gZpZUllWaa	yes i love it<br>  big wide shoulders and chests

BUT if you look at him and he is looking right back at you, and he does not look away, he is bold. as in he probably just wants to get into your pants.     hope this helps you ! =)    could any1 help me with my  prom problem?

There is a difference.  Please don't take responsibility for things that were beyond your control......  <br>  <br>  We have all been hurt in relationships, bad, and even good.  You pick yourself up, dust yourself off and learn from your mistakes. What is the saying, "time heals all wounds".  Believe me, it sucks to hear that, but it is oh so true.  Please, please, please just try to look at what was right, what was wrong, learn from it and move on.  Easier said than done, but it can be done.....  Take care Dear.......|`|2edf122eba2505771c7555a9a3b1ff3daa	I have.|`|neXoJrvkaa	we all have been hurt deeply but we cant stop there.life goes like this or else u cant get the right choice. and some things that we blame ourselves for are maybe gd in their place so that we can know our partner.it could be that ur jalousy helped u to discover that person.<br>  however jealousy is really normal but braking from this case must be a doubt u had and i think it is always true but we try to give ourselves chances but finally the dead end will take place.
q4nR5TTzaa	If your not madly in love with her and share the same feelings I believe you should break up with her. If you don't and you know this isn't going to work out why waste anymore of each-others time. I'm dating a guy 3,000 miles away he is in my home town and I'm away. He started drinking all the time and said it was because he missed me. I flat out told him that if he wanted this to work he needed to stop drinking.    If you do love her and want to be with her you two need to sit down and lay out some rules with one another. If you don't it will never work. If you care for her don't break up with her over this I think she just misses you and hasn't found a positive way to deal with it. Try to help her instead of getting upset just calmly talk to one another.  Let me know if you have anymore questions.  Just ask your self if you can see yourself with her in the future. If that's a yes continue to work on your relationship.|`|4582a857fe73584c0fff40c4f1537198aa	yes.|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Just because you had a fight doesn't mean it's over. Good Lord my wife and I argue all time but I'm not running to a divorce lawyer.|`|O3i7zJB2aa	GET OUT NOW!!!!!  Seriously, it will only get worse. Break up with her and cease all contact.|`|djjVYhWiaa	Tell her to stop being so selfish.  Your education is much more important than her at the moment -- you should be able to finish that and THEN progress onto going out there to live nearer to her later on.  She's being completely irrational.  Just try to calmly explain to her that you like where you are and that you'd like to see it through to the end.  If she continues being selfish, I would suggest breaking up or taking a break.|`|L5ioX6r1aa	You need to tell her everything you wrote here when you break up with her. Yes, she is madly in love with you, and she can't help being clingy, so I wouldn't take it out all on her. Shes gonna be hurt, she's gonna be angry, but you need to tell her why you think breaking up will be for the best. Don't give excuses. Don't try to "let her down easily" by making stupid stuff up. Be a man and be honest. Its the only way.|`|yp8NtB0faa	I think you need to talk to her about it.  Don't just break up with her and don't give her a reason.  Tell her she should respect ur decision not to transfer, and make sure she doesn't just want u to transfer because she doesn't trust u.|`|3Z4YFz29aa	she should be happy you can pursue your education where you are, not be selfish and want you to sacrifice that. If she can't stand you being off at college, she's clingy.    Time to move on and find someone more secure, trusting, and stable.|`|3YIjKQTEaa	Don't transfer. If it's really what you want to do then don't sacrifice it over a women. If it's meant to be she'll wait. if it's not there are more people out there.    the worst thing you could do is transfer and then a few months down the line she breaks up with you any way.    Don't sacrifice your education.|`|YVO3WyU1aa	I believe you answered your own question.  My experience has been if she is drinking herself to sleep when you are gone there is a good chance she will be drinking herself to sleep if and when you get together.  good luck|`|a1uoxczTaa	maybe u should break it off to help her. if u dont want to break it off n u have strong feelings toward her or u believe u cud get them toward her, u really should encourage her more and make her feel more confident about ur relationship. let her know that u will be there for her, especially when college is over. see what she wants that can work around u not having to transfer.|`|E5n8tRKoaa	um, no. she obvously likes you enough to stick with your butt through the whole issue of long distance. jeez, man. just love her.|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	leave her.  the biggest reason to leave her is she is selfish.  she would rather have you give up a future and education so you could be closer to her.  another reason is she is not letting you be you.  go have the "college experience" trust me it is the best time you will ever have, it will help to grow up, and help to know exactly what you want out of life.  don't stay with someone that you have to bow down to and kiss the ground they walk on.  focus on school and friends you don't need a serious relationship.  good luck|`|RWRqinXnaa	I think you should break up with her.  It's ridiculous that she would ask you to transfer after such a short period of time.  That's an incredibly selfish request.  She also sounds very needy and possessive.  Cut her loose it's better for you and her. She sounds like she'd be better off with someone who lives nearby and can give her constant attention.
JYQ6M5xmaa	put out a restraining order against him.
bID1Pd7Gaa	Do you need a rock to fall on your head? Yes, he still likes you.|`|96HWpdkFaa	It seems as if he does..maybe he realized what he was missing out on.    Talk to him about it.|`|P9oduCUgaa	yeah kinda or maybe he wast to be friends cuz he misses you.  or gf?  good luck babe.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	how about asking him. that would make moire sense than asking us.       Eat Funyuns.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	no, he doesn't like you.  don't guys use you like that, have some respect for yourself...have a standard.   I want my guy to do X, Y & Z with some room for grace. lets face it, guys just mess up..its their thing but you can still have a standard.|`|8rt7OR35aa	It sounds like he's regretting breaking up with you.  I think he probably likes you  again.    Talk to him about it again.  He may have changed his mind.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Yes, sounds like this guy likes you! Problem is that his feelings for you might of scared him a bit, so he pulled back. Don't worry sweetie, if it's meant to be, he'll come around. Just enjoy the relationship as friends that you still have.|`|X9RBRqL2aa	he still likes you but he is still torn whether he wants a relationship or not|`|AA12321034	It sounds like he does still have feelings for you maybe he regrets breaking up but feels like an idiot and don't know how to tell you.|`|fZfVM1unaa	Relationships are difficult.  We can love and hate the same person.  I might genuinely like certain things about you, and genuinely dislike other things.    Good relationships balance the pros and cons and require a certain level of tolerance.  As the lady in the relationship you should give him space.  If he "likes" you he will pursue you.    If you crowd him, he might want to get away from you even if he likes you.  It works both ways.|`|CA06qy8Laa	Yes he likes you.  If not he would totally be avoiding you.|`|NzzH2VNSaa	yes he dose....maybe he felt that his friends was picking on him.....or some other reason it seems that you went out for a long time and hes problem just wanted a break to get back with what he use to do before you got in his life....he probly is tthinkingthat dam this girl is mad good for me adn that am a total messesd up  fputtingign it off and btw guessinging on this trip he tried to find anyway possible to talk to you adn get as close as he can which are all signs flirtinging|`|Z8Gzb331aa	He definitely does like you! You should talk to him alone, and ask him if theres anything going on between the two of you, and if anything will happen!|`|fNNTPqZLaa	Sounds he does.   But be careful this time around, don't give in too easily.  Make him pay for leaving you. ;)  Play hard to get, sweetie.|`|nupjbK0Baa	Best answer to your question: Listen to the song by leeann rhymes called I may hate myself in the morning|`|T7b7tKvraa	well, he may still like you...    But i was a high school boy once, and he may have just remembered how much he likes being able to be intimate with you, both physically and emotionally.      I say, heads up, someone else might be thinking for him.
O1MITmaGaa	Wow, that's so sweet of her to still want to hang out with you even though you're quite younger!<br>  <br>  I'd say, go alone. if you bring along your own friends, you'll probably stick to your friends, and she'll stick to her, and you won't get to talk as much as you'd like.<br>  <br>  don't be afraid of them. if you're friend's there, she'll take care of you. act friendly; don't be shy - you have no reason to be: they're people you probably won't meet again anyway! so just be kind and keep the conversation going, ask questions.<br>  <br>  I know you don't want to be out of place, but there's a spot where you can be kind, friendly, and cool, while still being younger. but remember, respect them, and hopefully they'll respect you. it's important to #1 not act better than them, but also #2 to not act worse than them. you're just as important of a person, and you don't have to act like a subordinate or a weakling to fit in. that's not being strong and confident. just try to enjoy yourself and talk, get to know them. hopefully your friend will embrace you and not just stick to her 2 friends.|`|3jOG5V5caa	prayer always help me calm down when i feel nervous.  Just be yourself and don't think about the negative if you already have  the mindset that everything will go wrong the most likey it will happen since you already believe it will.  If you just focus on having a good time the more likely you will be able to open up and not let your shyness get to you.  I used to extremely shy so i know what i'm talking about.  Just be yourself and everything will be alright. I'm in college too and i noticed people here to be a lot more mature than highschoolers.  Again I just wanna stress "JUST BE YOURSELF" no one likes a poser|`|Likst1Mxaa	Oh well.<br>  Just talk to them the same way you would with people you don't know. If you do things together (eg bowling) you'll have more to talk about than if you go out for dinner etc.|`|UxRoUTvCaa	Just be yourself :D

71VRvldJaa	I would seriously think twice about selling out and moving to where someone lives you've had a long distance relationship with.  I've been there, done that and it was disastrous!  Long distance is VERY different from actually being together.  I sold my house, contents, vehicle and moved to the other side of the world to be with him.  It wasn't what we thought it was going to be and I ended up returning home.....to NOTHING of my own!  It would be a red flag warning to me that he hasn't suggested you moving in with him!  Hopefully he doesn't have a wife lurking in the background as my guy did!  If a man wants to commit to you.....get him to come to you!  I think if you pursue this, you will regret it and believe me, it takes a VERY long time to recover emotionally from something like this if it doesn't work out the way you're expecting it to or thinking it will.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Just ask him if you can move in with him. Lay it out to him.    You can't afford to move there and pay the several months advanced revnt and you'd like o move there and live with him. If he says no then just stay there.    There's no need for you to be so timid, but sinc eyou can't even ask him something as simple as that, thenmaybe you shouldn't be moving down there.

AA10975867	Okay there's only a group of 20. It will take them about 20 minutes to get out of their chairs, go to the bathrooms, comb their hair. Then they will spend 30 minutes talking about how lovely you looked and what a great place it is for a wedding. Then they will spend 20 minutes taking snapshots of each other in the beautiful gardens because they are all dressed up and looking good. I would have the caterer set up a punch bowl about 30 minutes after the ceremony ends and some veggies to much. Have a scrapbook or guest book at a table and ask people after the ceremony to take a few minutes and write you a personal message. Have their names on the top of each single page so they know they can use up a lot of space. 20 people would take over an hour to do this!! After your photos are done, you will want a "potty stop" yourself  before you will be rejoining your guests. You will mingle and they will take their own candid snapshots. That will take at least 20 minutes...badabing, your MC will be asking them to take their seats. Really. Time will go by fast! Don't spend a lot of $$ on loads of appies and drinks because then your guests will be too full to enjoy the meal.|`|a1esFJ53aa	You could make a program, maybe just a small page to give people ideas on times of the ceremony and let them know what will happen inbetween the wedding and reception, seeing as you're wedding is small, word of mouth would work just as well and be a money saver!    A good idea to fill in time would be to serve drinks, sometimes people have a cocktail hour between the ceremony and reception so they can set up for reception (if not done already) and have their pictures taken. Maybe have wine served at this time? If there are kids around, some childrens activities fto keep them amused would be great as they're more likely to be the bored ones!     Also, as they are close family and friends and there aren't many of them, maybe they could be in some of the photos too? like a group photograph? I'm sure they'd be interested in sticking around to see some of the photos being taken and be in some of them!    I hope these suggestions help, good luck and congratulations!|`|AA11946005	It wouldn't take 2 hrs to take photos if there are no bridemaids- it likely won't take even half that.  I agree with the people who suggest a cocktail hour- even with very simple foods, and the guests will munch and mingle and it should all go really well.|`|AA11312653	If this is how "most weddings" go these days, then Yours Truly is shaking her gray head and going tut tut. Hosts may choose to have two events on the same day, but there is no mannerly way for hosts to schedule a "time out" of several hours and then resume entertaining. You either fulfill your duties as host or you tell your guests goodbye. Offering snacks and booze doesn't make it OK -- Jack Daniels is no substitute for the host.    A dear nephew had been expecting a large set of crystalware on the occasion of his marriage. Then Auntie Kill was neglected for 2 hours because the newlyweds believed that their photo album was more important than their guests. The crystal was exchanged for a modest set of plain glassware and Auntie Kill treated herself to a spa day on the difference. I advise all wedding guests to do their gifting AFTER the party, and to give with a level of generosity that reflects the consideration and thoughtfulness with which the festivities were conducted.     Please arrange to acquire your photos in a way that does not include being abominally rude to your guests. And please omit programs. If your ceremony is so complex that observers need a printed handout to understand what is happening, then your ceremony is too complex. If people are wildly curious to know the name of a song or a bridemaid, they can ask at the reception. Use your money toward things that will actually add to your guests' enjoyment, like a more convenient time for your recpetion.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	Normally, they take pics of themselves too.  They also stand and watch the couple taking the pics.  You could try including them in some of the pics.  Afterward they usually go to the bar and have a drink until dinner is served.|`|5f37c1ca843baed941347175d05ad20eaa	I would just have a cocktail hour.  Have drinks and appetizers and let them mingle about while you take pictures.  Will it take you 2 hours?  I'd try to not make dinner that long afterwards.  I've never been to a wedding when there was that much time between the ceremony and reception.      As far as programs go, I wouldn't worry about it.  If you're not having bridesmaids and things like that, you won't have much info to put in there except the order of the ceremony.  And from the sounds of it, it'll be pretty short.|`|itbkP9HGaa	Pictures shouldn't take 2 hours.  Seriously, that's crazy.  My pictures took 45 minutes, and we also had our ceremony and reception at the same place.  We simply opened the bar and had cocktail hour while we took pictures.  This is fairly standard for what i've witnessed at other weddings as well.|`|DDSEGWFDaa	If you provide them with food and beverages (cheese tray and veggie tray is fine) they will happily amuse themselves.  They are all grownups and they know you have to do your pix.  They will just chat and have fun.  Alternatively, you could send them on a tour of the botanic garden, perhaps the garden could provide you with a guide.  Or if there's a tram everyone could hop on for a tram ride around the garden.      They're not 5 year olds at a birthday party -- no need to hire a clown!!  It was surprising to me that on my wedding day even the most difficult family members acted like lovely adults.  I think maybe the nice clothes bring out peoples' better side.|`|LVNbP6VWaa	My wedding is at noon and then everyone is going staright to the reception.  I am serving cocktails whilst the photos are done so that the atmosphere is relaxed and fun.  I have provided games for the children, but am hoping eveyone else will just relax and enjoy themselves! x|`|662f484d424f72f2a33ec7fc2ec39c16aa	Have a cocktail hour while you take your pictures.  How many pictures do you want?|`|xFv6LirIaa	Make sure they have drinks and appetizers to eat before the meal.  Have music playing and maybe even arrange for someone to sing a song while they wait.  Maybe you could have a disposable camera at every table and leave a note with it for people to take pictures starting now.  Have a book passed around for everyone to write down advice for you and your new husband.  Shoot i dont know, have a slideshow of you and your husband when you were kids and the family will get to see how everyone used to look.|`|29I8PWrxaa	Most people have a cocktail hour in between the ceremony and reception, especially if they are at the same location anyway.  And if you are having a small wedding anyway, you can probably afford to buy a few drinks for guests.  The guests will simply have a cocktail and make small talk while you take your pictures.    And yes, I would still make a program.|`|7VzbVzBnaa	Your scenario is far from normal.  I've never been to a wedding that was at noon and then the reception didn't start until 5pm.      Because your wedding is all in one location, then you need to host a cocktail and appetizer hour for the guests while you are doing photos.  For that small of a wedding, with no attendants, you need to complete the photos in 30-45 minutes and the food/drinks need to be flowing.  People will entertain themselves for this long, provided you take care of them properly with wine and small bites.      For the program, I'm not a program person.  I think they are a waste of money.  At a wedding this small,  they can get the info directly from you or someone close to you.      Added:  I disagree that a cheese & veggie platter will be adequate.  If it's a HIGH end cheese plate with things like Gorgonzola, Brie, and gourmet cheeses along with roasted vegetables, figs, and similar upper end items, then maybe.  A costco veggie platter with cubes of cheddar will not cut it.|`|O954bykraa	It is your wedding, so you can do anything you want, BUT :-)  Would you want to go home during a wedding? Does that sound reasonable, better yet respecful?  Yes, it is your wedding, but you should consider your guests.  Option 1. Create some sort of an entertainment for them  Option 2. Take your picture at another time, but it sounds like a lot of work.|`|hkwBR1moaa	I've never heard of a reception that didn't start right after the ceremony.  But most photographers have been doing this for a long time so they know how to get the pics they need quickly so that you can get on to enjoying the reception.  Where my reception is they start passing food and drinks as soon as guests arrive.  And guests are usually catching up with other relatives and friends that are there so the first 30 minutes go by quickly.  They'll be okay without providing 'entertainment'.
4IFXHz80aa	I dont think you should getting him drunk will be the best thing to do. i understand that you want to know the truth and you want him to be honest, but i dont think getting him drunk will fulfill your need. all this will prove is that youre going to have to get him drunk every time you want to know that truth and every time you want him to be honest with you. do you really want ot be in a relationship where your boyfriend is drunk all the time? and what if you get him so drunk that he doesnt remember anything about the conversation you had with him? he'll deny anything you say bc he doesnt remember. my advice is to either find another more predictive way of getting him to talk or leave him be. ask yourself this question. if you get back together with him, even if he tells you the truth, is he going to be a better boyfriend? you have to watch out for yourself in this type of situation. good luck!|`|WLLvMY3iaa	That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard of, do you know anything about the affects of alcohol?  If he will not have one real conversation about breaking up with you, honestly and sober than he is not worth your time.    How much have you bothered him about it? Or is he just exaggerating when he says stalker?|`|AGbusTqGaa	Why don't you just ask him the questions you want to know the answers too when hes sober?  And if you're that worried about him lying then don't forgive him.  Obviously there are trust issues.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Umm... this idea doesn't sound great.  You need to get him drunk for him to be honest?? Why would you want to be with someone who can't be honest to you when they're sober? Do you really want to be with someone that you have to trick to tell the truth? And how you do know it's even the truth if he's drunk.      How about telling him you need him to answers these questions honestly to move on with this relationship - in a sober state of mind. If he's unwilling or lies, well then you have your answer.
8zJPQRZfaa	love declarations and poetry after being a complete jerk! ;k i'd be liek "oh now ur nice i don't think so huny". i'd feel love for him and his personality, but after being a jerk i'd ignore him and find something new (i'v known a jerk so yeah). find someone new u deserve it ur a good person ;D|`|iufAPDeWaa	Both. but more so humiliating me. Who would do that if they loved you? So basically its a lie.|`|aBnZRJOcaa	both are big turn offs but the love thing is like ummm werid and ya|`|EXIflDhsaa	The fact he was too faced like dat wud do it fer me!|`|BeUi45dKaa	it wouldn't only humiliate me but it would also upset me,either way he acts like a jerk and them adds more pain to it by tryin to make me look stupid by declaring that he loves me and probably uses poetry lines from movies.that's just plain pissing.

VTGrUZbOaa	Base on your description, it seems that that guy has the same personality with me. I am a shy people, silent, a serious type and a kind of man who will never greet as long as I am greeted or talked first.<br>  <br>  I understand your side of being a lady who fear of being called cheap because tradition tells us that men must always make the first move and not of ladies.  But ... you know? If that guy really had the same personality with me, HE is so much grateful to met someone like you whom he knows who will understand and accept him the way he is. He is just a type of person who finds it hard when it comes on expressing himself and his feelings. I know he likes you very much! He is always thinking about you, about how are you, what are you doing, are you alright... and many more. But the problem is that he is too shy enough to open this feelings for you.<br>  <br>  Well, I guess... If this guy is not a waste of time for you... why not?<br>  Try the first move! :) but as well be cautious<br>  <br>  hmm... but I think that guy is not that type of person who will only cheat you.<br>  <br>  One thing that I admired on women is their ability of "Intuistic Insights". If that so... then... Follow your heart!  Your heart will make you see what the eyes coudn't not see, make you hear what your ears coudn't hear, and makes you sense what your skin couldn't sense<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	It generally normally works out for the best.|`|b2j5AE1oaa	10 words don't tell him you like him when you text him!<br>  my friend told that to the guy i like he was all kool and we haven't talked sense she told him so ya don't make my mistake|`|jKph4peTaa	he's already married he's just leading you on|`|vyq7IOukaa	Break out that flashlight and be careful he could be shy or Not like u too much.|`|0rBEqVtHaa	i wish i was that luky dude|`|Ey73y4Ypaa	Well you're right to not wanna come off too desperate. I don't know, I get what you're saying, it would be hard to just ask somebody out when you're nervous. Just keep talking with him whenever you can so you guys get more acquainted with each other and then that's probably the best time to ask him. I think most guys would be open to a date if they're not already taken.|`|KnQuTXozaa	Wow...from experience, long distance relationships are HARD. <br>  <br>  but it sounds like this could work =) my advice is to see him in person.<br>  NO JOKE. if this is going to work out, go visit. <br>  <br>  maybe that is what he is waiting for...maybe he is reserved because he hasnt seen you in a while.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|w1qFk1ytaa	lalalalala|`|05gBNxJcaa	I'll probably just be the answer you don't want to hear.<br>  but honestly he probably really likes you but knows you live <br>  too far away, so doesn't get too close.<br>  I know you probably can't get over how cute he is and how much chemistry you had at the wedding...but trying to date someone long distance is i can't say horrible...cause very few work out, but the majority doesn't work. <br>  being in a long distance relationship cause stress, jealousy, speculation, and unhappiness. cause u can't always be there with him.<br>  I had one long distance relationship..and we would of been great together if we lived in the same town...but long distance took so much out of us...we brought out our worst in each other after a few months.<br>  <br>  But if you think you can handle it...just be a little more assertive..<br>  flirt with him...act like he's lucky to talk to you. joke around and be like "hey i'm watching "blah blah" you totally should come over"  <br>  hopefully he will flirt back and you can see where it goes from there :]
Bb0i9RcEaa	In the past, I admit I have tend to go for looks and wow that was a failure. They were all jerks and cocky and had no real depth.<br>  I dislike most is a cocky guy. I like sweet guys with a great sense of humor who aren't afraid to make a move and show their feelings.|`|AA11263103	Dislike- they like you then they don't [ugh!], they are very confusing!<br>  Like-they make feel impotant, they are a best friend that you can kiss..lol.!<br>  Appearance- not really about 50/50 personality matters a lot too!!|`|UzFWLTquaa	Appearance for me is probably one of the least bit important things, I mean my boyfriend of 2 years is a twig but I am attracted physically because of his personality.  He is sooo funny and he always can keep up a conversation, personality is definitely the biggest factor for me.
fZfVM1unaa	This behavior is called "self grooming", it's an instinctual flirtation device.  Men do it too, only it's more subtle, so if he's pulling up his socks or stroking his chin, he just might have the hots for YOU.|`|0MnTXjn8aa	I try not to do that because it makes you look nervous.|`|pZevjTXGaa	yes|`|gUCjkj9oaa	yes|`|V20PTwMmaa	Umm lol|`|zzkmdusEaa	do you mean casually? or as a tease?|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	Never thought of it but I guess so. Hmm, didn't know taht about myself.|`|leneiWBlaa	yes if your looking at the guy you like and you bite your lip then yes we do find it attractive|`|hiSa7qthaa	Yes. It's just a cute, nervous habit most women have.|`|TS5swHMvaa	yes ma'am|`|qN6Bq0Emaa	I think she hasn't washed her hair recently|`|w5sK75MPaa	No I find it rather annoying|`|iX5p5pHwaa	kinda|`|eMFwMQGHaa	I love it when they brush their hair profusely and aggressively so they get hair everywhere. jk But yeah. It's hot.|`|BO28Mn8haa	lol it could be nice because he could visualize himself doing it to you. also, when you run hands through your hair it usually exposes more of your face, revealing more beauty (or less... if you wanna be analytical)|`|A7QUjI8eaa	Yes...|`|JH9IMMDtaa	yeah, a little bit... I like it when they curl their hair with their finger.|`|wvPwc4PGaa	yes|`|d2a3834786860b34ae904f14b9d846faaa	Yes,  as long as  she  doesn't   twist  it  and  pull it  a lot.|`|7tLDdtqGaa	YES YES YES!!!!!|`|Dwi2wih5aa	they think its sexxyyyy =P|`|58jwkbbSaa	Conceited much?|`|QguM97Oraa	Was this question just an excuse to tell the world you have nice hair?|`|Jh7KNXn9aa	Uhh pretty much anything down there attracts me.|`|ZqhaMRFqaa	sometimes

0a3d8785f8742829b2a54e45eb88c0e0aa	If he isn't remorseful whatsoever, and this isn't the first time that it's happened, then yeah, you should follow through and let him deal with the consequences of his actions.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Agree with Sherrie. If this is not the first time and he's made no effort to apologize, it's time to press charges. Sounds like he needs to be in a military school now, not later. They don't put up with that crap. And you didn't ruin his life, he did.|`|Ueo8QBPsaa	yes, totally do it, who cares about the guy and at least he gets to learn his lesson so next time he wont do this to another kid.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	well why did he hit you? There had to be some reason for this.I would not ruin his life in the Military over this.I would move on and stay away from him and if this should ever happen again then I would move toward  criminal charges.Hope your face feeling better.|`|Q5KFND17aa	why are you even asking this question? he's not worth of a life, so at least make it terrible for him. XD
qazXVoYdaa	well i think he likes you.. just not a lot<br>  most guys act different around their friends<br>  but if a guy really likes a girl <br>  then he wouldn't unless it was like to brag<br>  about you being him which you aren't so yeahh..<br>  you should just be straight up with him and<br>  ask him if he likes you or not and if he doesnt oh well<br>  if he does go on another date<br>  but also tell him to talk to his friends<br>  they seem like assh0les<br>  lol|`|bEsoWSRbaa	if he is shy then he is bound to say he doesnt like you when he does shy guys like that dont want to share their feelings unless they tell you and get out of the habit of being shy|`|Z59ozM6Uaa	the truth is he like you but he is a little afraid  that his friends may through out him from his gang
ss5vAWKSaa	This is definitely not normal. He acts as if he is in control of your relationship.  Girls always need to let guys know that they are in control.  This helps them avoid "controlling" and "abusive" bfs.  Take charge of your life and your relationship.  If you want to go to a party, go!|`|YbDf0uDHaa	he since controlling.  not normal.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	He sounds controlling. It's only a matter of time before he starts alienating you from your loved ones and beating you to a pulp. Run don't walk.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	He's scared you'll cheat on him probably.<br>  <br>  Tell him he should invest in some more trust, because at this age having a long-term commited relationship is hard enough without adding on extra terms and conditions.<br>  <br>  If you haven't given him any reason to think you'll be unfaithful, then TOO BAD for him.|`|LHhds2tQaa	I see it that he just wants to protect you. He doesnt want you to be exposed to that stuff. I dont really want my girl to parties. She cant because of her parents but even if she could I would have want her to go with me then it would be cool.|`|osDB9DTEaa	He's your boyfriend, not your father. If he's the jealous type, you'd might as well leave him. This is the beginning of what could blossom into an abusive relationship. Be careful.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	and you listen to him? wth|`|dsqm0x9Waa	not! that is not normal at all, you can go wherever you want, don't let him controll you! If he doesn't let you go to parties then there are either to reasons why: Either he hooks up with another girl at the parties, or he's an overprotective, controlling freak. You should not go out with him. If he's controlling you at this point, then think about later on. I won't even explain that. My advice, dump 'em!<br>  <br>  Hope u get through it all right!|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Depends.<br>  <br>  What reason does he give for not wanting to let you go?<br>  - Bad reputation of the parties? (ie. lots of drugs, drinking etc.) : normal and acceptable to be against.<br>  <br>  - No trust? - Bad sign, means he does not trust you to be faithful or smart.<br>  <br>  - Past expirience? With you? - show him you can handle it. With someone else? - tell him to get over it, you are you, not someone else.<br>  <br>  - No reason? Run away - warning sign number 1!<br>  <br>  Ask if he can/will join you - that way there would be no reason to not (let you) go.|`|BqXSymxjaa	Not! He won't let you? He's your boyfriend, not your parent. He can have an opinion and tell you he would rather you didn't go, but ultimately the decision is yours to go or not. At the same time, if you love him, you should consider how he feels when making decisions, but there is nothing wrong with you going to a party.|`|yNWgQcHkaa	yes very normal i dunt want my gf going to parties ... my reasons are simple.. <br>  1. i wuld worry about drinkin and drivin<br>  2.if u culd get ...(dunt report me pls)laid... <br>  3.he not sure were ur going.<br>  4.he might want u to be with him soz u guys can have more quality time...<br>  hope i helped|`|0p5c5gO9aa	hi,<br>  <br>  it is good for you and for him parties are good but not alone talk to him about it and then check what he is up to he must have a reason|`|0vo7tDP5aa	he's overly protective. an insecure, un-trusting, unconfident, jealous bastard. dump him. he's a joke. he thinks ur gonna hook up  with a guy. there needs to be trust in a relationship.|`|OvCcx6Xlaa	THEN GO WITH HIM NOT BY YOURSELF|`|AA10989594	he treating you like u were his sis.<br>  or like he is u dad.<br>  <br>  <br>  he might like you too much and doesnt want to lose you.tell him u want to go out,he should go to.|`|beeyHBnbaa	NOT normalllllll<br>  he should go with you and you guys should party together<br>  <br>  hes prob just jealous of other guys but <br>  its not normal <br>  u shouldnt let him hold you back<br>  when theres a party go..<br>  it shouldnt get in the way of u two|`|TSTEKBXdaa	hi there...<br>  i am sorry but i think this does not show the jealousy. rather it shows the great love for you.<br>  to know more plz contact me on lyallpurian@yahoo.com<br>  regards,<br>  khurram

b113be30ccec78ff9c59b9e34656f90caa	You should sit down and and explain to him that you are not trying to replace his mother.

He probably sees you as someone who is trying to take the place of his mother and finds that threatening. Be patient with him and take things really slowly. I suggest family counseling.
mbIbtkUEaa	dude, i am turning 17 soon and i have never dated anyone, im not worried, there is hope =}<br>  ---edit<br>  makes it more special i DO get one|`|eBKWte2aaa	Don't be in such a rush to grow up :) I'm sure you'll find a wonderful guy if you're just patient.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	Don't be so impatient! I was 18 before I had my first girlfriend (I'm a guy). Its no big deal...especially at 14, you can't even drive...how would you go on dates? <br>  <br>  lol sorry I just always thought it was funny when people have their parents take them on dates.|`|GEd48C24aa	its not a bad thinq at all.<br>  im 14 & have had 2 boyfriends my entire life.<br>  and as well , all my friends date like tons of quys.<br>  im proudd. haha.|`|hGWhzfFqaa	You're too young to care so much.|`|OmPehgJhaa	its fine im 14 and havnt dated anyone
yuOuoCfDaa	I know you feel like a step child.....sorry to say but your friend is half ***.  As soon as something goes wrong I can bet she will run to you for your ears & you to be ready to receive all of the nothings she has to say.  Once again another case of convenience.  Just keep in mind that alot of people are like that.  They have no sense of self or others feeling---no sense of anything regarding true committment, loyalty and they conveniently at their descretion  accommodate you in their lives.  Only to vacate at the first chance that they get the minute someone smiles or pay them the attention they seek.  Dont take it personal, you just experienced her vacancy sooner than later.  If you have no interest in being a part time friend, dont be a part time friend.  You dont need to lecture or tell her this, she already knows, because if you did it to her she would know the feeling.  For now she is engrossed in a new feeling you cant be mad at that but I can understand your feelings now that she doesnt even take time to spend quality time with you.  Now you have to live your life, not that you have to go get a boyfriend, but just spend time with other people socialize and interact with those that interest you.  Then your life will be colorful and interesting even though she is not around.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	Actually, and you won't like this, her relationship with her boyfriend is none of your business.  Its new, exiting and she's in love.  Just be happy for her.|`|3zm0jA0yaa	This is probably new to you  but I've been thru this many times before. If you talk badly about her boyfriend, it will come back to haunt you, even tho she may break up with him right now he is the hippest thing in her life. Its new to her and she is dumb in love, or she thinks she is. Just know that when the bottom falls out of this relationship that it is probably going to knock the breath out of her. The harder you fall in love the harder the breakup is. So look out for that.  In the meantime, just kindly let her know that you feel like you are being dissed over this guy, and that you've not done anything wrong to her to feel this way about. Say I know this is all new and stuff but I have been there for you for 4 years and I don't want to lose our friendship because of this guy. Say," I hope it works out for you (YOU don't have to mean it) but if it doesn't and he breaks your heart you'll need a friend, I just hope we will still be friends.   The thing is girls will go thru many boyfriends at your age, but a real girl to girl friendship is hard to find and should mean more to her than this. Let  her know that she'll have many boyfriends but a true fiend is hard to replace. Good luck to you. In the mean time try not to let it bother you so much. Do things with your other friends for a while and try not to be so available to her. You should fill up your time with a new friend or your other friends. Remember that she thinks shes in love (sickening I know) and she is going to do some stupid things, but forgetting your friend shouldn't be one of them. Get a new friend for now.|`|4d5JnwKvaa	What you all need is a schedule.  She should have a set time to spend with you and talking to you and a time to talk to her boyfriend.  She will regret spending the amount of time she did with her boyfriend if she does not have balance.  Everybody needs a break.  For example, I'm going out of town this weekend, my girlfriend is looking forward to that because she's going to have a girls weekend.  I know that she loves me, but she needs to talk to different people as well, and so does your best friend.|`|4oDn5zIpaa	okay first you have to understand her when you get a boyfriend most girls end up really fast thinking he is the one and stuff... You need to sometime ask her if there is a day you two can get your nails done or go do something together and make it a rule if you like a guy to to make it your day. Do not tell her like okay you cant talk about your  boyfriend it will seem to harsh. Tell her when you guys meet up that you want it to be a queit relaxing day with out interuptions and that we canT talk about guys, becuse it is our day. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. then say you know we never talk much or something and then tell her how you feel but be nice like say you know since you started dating ________ we do not get to do things or talk much and i dont want to loose my best friend but i am really happy that you found someone you love and i am not jellouse or anything i just think that you are kinda pushing everyone away and i just want to make sure everything is okay since being your best friend i care about you. then offer to put away sometime every other week or so to get together to have a spa day or somehting and to put away time one a week or so to talk to each other.    Most friends would understand but if she gets offesive something may be wrong like a controling boyfriend that is brain washing her kinda i know it sounds crazy but the same thing happened to me and my best friend and i she finally realized what i was saying about him was true and i had to get her out of the relationship.    If he is being controlling she is in a very difficult situation where she will be volnerable and fragial so dont be like he is bad for you and you need to get out of it.. she wont understand     things to look for for a controling relationship  1. he never lets her talk to her friends much or always wants her to be with him and wont let her do things with out him.  2. she will pulll away from everyone and seem very distant    also google this topic if you think it may be the case     HOPE IT HELPS|`|3RDOPzGeaa	Every girl has been through this with a friend so don't worry, it's not just you that its happening to. Girls put boyfriends before their friends and then they realize how much they messed up when the relationship ends. Right now she is just happy someone is interested in her romantically and living in lalaland so she isn't thinking of friendship. You can't tell her how crazy things are b/c she will just accuse you of being jealous. I've been through this with a friend and her relationship was ridic and after 2 weeks she said they were going to get married sometime and when I told her how crazy that was she accused me of being jealous and to this day she thinks I was jealous Lol. We aren't friends anymore.. Just keep it to yourself and act supportive. And if she's ignoring you then ignore her back for a bit until she realizes and the novelty of the relationship wears off.|`|YcyT38OIaa	Well, maybe she's just grown up before you did. I've had a lot of good friends my whole life, but when I met my fiance, she topped all of them pretty quick. Now, she was not my first girlfriend. I had like 5 others before her. And honestly, I did love and care about the others, but Gaby is just the best person I've ever met. And it's not just because she's physically ideal-looking to me. Other then being the most perfectly beautiful woman I've ever seen, she's also very intelligent, hilarious, wise, and logical. And there's other spiritual reasons that I doubt would interest you. She is really "Best Friend" material.     Now for some blunt, pure honesty.    From the way you express yourself and how you display your thought process, you seem like you could be an articulate 11 year old, or an immature 17 year old. Chances are you've never been in love. I'm talking about "real love" not movie love, or infatuation love, or food enjoyment and celebrity worship. And also, since similar people tend to become "best friends" ...neither has your friend who's fallen head over heels for this guy. Seems like she's very infatuated, clingy, and simply enjoys his company more than yours. Understandable, isn't it?     Don't be quick to label, but take time in your evaluations.    Seriously, be understanding here, and you'll realize that this is fine and normal. What does he have that you don't? Obviously, he's male. Also, there's something about him that makes her feel better about herself, than you can make her feel better about herself. He may make her feel beautiful and shower her with compliments or something, and make her feel wanted and give her that rush of infatuation. If she's straight, chances are that if you attempted to do the same, she'd get a little disturbed.    It sounds like it's her first relationship, and you've never had one. Don't sweat it. These things will happen. Your best option is to grow up and mature. How about being a better person, so that you can be a better friend? Not saying you're bad, but we can all strive to be better in the future, than we were in the past, and are in the present. Evaluate all life's situations, and choose your best course of action. You can do anything if you want it bad enough, and go about getting it in the right way.     The only way to find true happiness, is to be the best person you can be, in all areas.|`|rR5nIklWaa	shes in love  nothing and no body can stop it  i was 14 when i lost my v card to my boyfreind and i was only going out with him for a week   i lost all my freinds b cuz  i was with him every sec  i still to this day cant be with out him hes always there for me  like a best freind but better  its undescrible how she feels right now she problly doesnt even no that ur mad  shes too cought up  with him just stick it out i promise she will need a freind some day to tell all those boy storys to and dont throw all of those yrs away  u should be happy for her  SHE S FOUND  SOEONE

How inconsiderate is that, he called it off and got as he wished, to spend a few weeks on the grass that he thought was greener.  Now that he sees it's not green much less grass he wants to return to what he had.....AT HIS CONVENIENCE!!!  Absolutely NOT....do not encourage that let him throw his god forsaken tantrums, hopefully he has learned respect and what it's all about.  If he respected you and your feelings, he would have never handled the situation the way in which he did.  If he was any kind of a man with tact and consideration, he would have least tried the lets be friends or I need some space to sort things out option.  Leave him to sulk in his corner, who knows he might pull the same sh** if someone else comes along and he gets a stiff one.

Z9svX7r4aa	That difficult. He could, there is a chance he could, but guys can be very misleading, trust me, i learned that the hard way. Dont jump to conclusions that he does. Because it will just mess up everything if he doesnt.

O1MITmaGaa	wow.<br>  <br>  at least you're attractive, I guess.<br>  <br>  talk up. be open. be friendly. don't be afraid of what other people will think of you. at least if you talk they'll THINK of you, as opposed to not thinking of you at all.<br>  <br>  or you could just not worry about it that much. let things come and go.<br>  <br>  but really, if you want to be active and do something, then talk it up. and if the guys start talking about their gfs, make it a point to not care; the main goal should be to make friends, not go bf-scouting.|`|f8ON3dRfaa	Wait for the right guy to come along. A guy who respects and accepts you for who you are, shy or not.<br>  <br>  Don't look at guys with the mentality of whether they are 'boyfriend-material". But just look at them as friends and you won't feel that shy around them. Treat them the same as how you would treat your girlfriends. If you can, imagine them in skirts! <br>  <br>  What you can do if you're quiet and shy: Smile more. It's a non-verbal expression that speaks volume to another person. <br>  <br>  Imagine looking at a girl, wanting to talk to her, but she looks away immediately, frowning just a little and walking away even faster.<br>  <br>  Imagine looking at a girl, wanting to talk to her, she looks at you and just smiled, no words exchanged.<br>  <br>  Feel the different response you get and understand how others will feel. So, smile! It makes you more attractive and more approachable.|`|fh8bQdGkaa	I have the same problem with girls and I'm a guy, which worsens the situation. I'm sure you'd know the reasons why; (guy goes up to girl... guy asks girl out...etc.)<br>  Listen. If a guy comes up to you and you're interested even a little, it's time to break out of that shell and smile. If he has something to say, be engaged in the conversation. Maybe throw out a few things yourself. Guys LOVE when a girl seems interested, even just a little. Like others have stated, it's better to go with a mind set on making friends, not boyfriends. It makes it 10x easier that way. Oh, and if you're in college, go to something like an event. That gives you an excuse to go up to people. if you're old enough, go with a few friends to a bar maybe. But honestly, get engaged in school events, and have lots of fun! You'll meet lots of people. Potential dates too.<br>  You've got nothing to lose.|`|9s5duQmFaa	OMG...I understand what you mean.but maybe when you go to a new grade..like next year..you can open up a little.And also dont worry some guys are attracted to shy girls.:D|`|rwbKwEtgaa	talk to a person who talks alot so that way you don't have show your shyness.if he/she asks you any questions keep it simple.|`|nut1j5Ojaa	Knowing ya shy would make me interested in ya...... if ya had IM's ...

XH2o1MM6aa	.An education is priceless.Marines are ten a penny.So what academic requirements do marines have.He'll have the girls flirting,no matter what you do.What I do know is that your weird parents love you.Unconditionally.
dJoE8yedaa	Honestly, you deserve better. You probably think you love him because you need him to be a dad. Any fool can father a baby, but it takes a real man to be a dad. Pick yourself up. I know it will be hard, but it will be worth it long term. You will meet someone else one day, maybe even around the corner, who will love you and your son more than you'll ever know. No woman deserves that heartache, and if he's willing to put you through it maybe he's just not worth your love, dear.<br>  <br>  I'm shocked the other woman will allow him to put you through all that. She should know from experience what it's like to lose the father of her kids.|`|79aZQf4qaa	unfortunately he will have to deal with it. unless he isn't a real man to take responsibility|`|VHE22iNbaa	This guy is obviously immature, self centered and absolutely clueless. I doubt if he's capable of carrying on a healthy relationship. He probably comes from an emotionally dysfunctional background and won't be able to change without counseling.<br>  <br>  Having said that, nobody can make that decision for you. If you want to try and get him back, I'll recommend a book that worked for me. It also helps you analyze whether or not the relationship is worth saving. Just be careful what you ask for. You might get it.<br>  <br>  Here's my story that I told on another thread. You'll find the link for the book there.<br>  <br>  My story:<br>  <br>  I can tell you from experience that when your head is messed up it's very hard to decide what to do. When my boyfriend and I broke up, I did some really stupid things because I wasn't thinking straight.<br>  <br>  I finally listened to my best friend who had been trying to tell me to back off for a while. She's always messing around on the internet and found one of those on line books about fixing relationships but analyzing them first. It has some fantastic stuff in it. It worked for me because I was in no condition to decide what to do on my own.

If thats the way he behaves, then move on with your life and your love life.

7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Yes, he has to have a contact number.<br>  <br>  However, there is no law that states it has to be a home phone number.<br>  So if you were to purchase a pre-paid phone, and only gave him that phone number, you have at least given him a phone number.<br>  <br>  Plus with the cell phone, you could show the court how often he does call by the itemized billing.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	You don't "legally" have to until you have a decree which states you will provide one another with contact info, which most do state when there are kids. However, why would you NOT give it to him? They are his children as much as yours and the fact that right now he isn't around doesn't mean he isn't entitled to contact his children. That just isn't right. Don't be the person that interferes with your kids ability to have contact with their dad. If he doesn't contact them, then that's on him but if YOU prevent him from being able to contact them who do you think the kids are going to end up resenting eventually, Mom?|`|qj5MQX2waa	I think it would be best that you do,incase of an emergency.

When your kids are 20, do you want him to tell them that he didn't have a number for them because of you? If he doesn't call much, it's not like he's going to bother you. Do the right thing.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Not sure there's a law to force this but it would be the decent thing to do. No man should be entirely estranged from his children.
DDvDEB8waa	Well... You Have Four Explanations    1. He ran out of credit  2. There was some kind of emergency going on, so he couldn't text  3. He forgot  4.

A lot of guys hate it when girls get angry at them because they forgot or were busy.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	You NEVER text a chap like that.

If you do hear from him again it'll probably be ony intrested in sex once hes got it you wont see him again.  Alot of guys prefer a challenge and you clearly wasn't ne for him, i don't mean that to sound harsh on you but that's what men think like my dear.  Sounds a creep to me, id say forget about him and move on.|`|AA11246851	He did not let you down and you are not upset with him. You let yourself down and that's why you are upset. How many times you said you ain't gonna do this, ain't gonna believe this and this was the last time, but every time is the last time, ain't it? That's what's making you upset, as for him? He is a no value quantity for you right now, he will never be a someone unless  you adapt your own imagination to the person and not the person to your imagination, which would be impossible, 'cause that perfection does not exist. So instead of all this chaos you try to call a life, get real with yourself, because you are the one who matter most! As long as you know and do that and appreciate YOU, everything will fall into place and who you want will call because  they deserve your precious presence. Do not take anything less, think, why would you?!
qxgkhN8aaa	Hi Kate, where the hell do you heard that from ?<br>  <br>  If so then why don't you just change to be RUDE ?<br>  It's easy isn't it ?|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	the nice girl is my choice|`|37xGYYH0aa	Number One.<br>  <br>  Why? because the rude part will get annoying.  I personally rather have an affectionate caring girlfriend. not a stuck-up know it all|`|y5DAfNtHaa	I'd choose the nice girlfriend..<br>  rude girls are a *****...<br>  girls can be attractive in many ways.. not just the physical appearance..|`|p1bDWCUGaa	i would rather have a nice girlfriend because if you are rude than people would not hang out with me, and you would have people hate you|`|YR4VADGuaa	The nice one
XVTCsfWVaa	He will probably not call. That is ok . This a lesson of the heart we all learn at some point.<br>  It hurts when they move on so quickly. What is really bothering you is you found out he was dating her a month before you even broke it off with him. That really hurts.<br>  <br>  Since it sounds as you heard he wants the first gf back. He is hoping he gets a chance with her. It sounds as if she long moved on and so should you. You will.<br>  <br>  As for the girl with him right now. While she may not be as pretty as his others. The rule is it is not how attractive someone is that makes one stray but how they make them feel. She probably really boost his ego or whatever it is he likes so much.<br>  <br>  Not to say his dating another before the door was closed on you two was appropriate. It is not but some people no matter what their age do this.<br>  <br>  It is normal to go through and feel what you are going through. It is called "closure" You are trying to create your own closure so you can move forward. He left without any and you are making it for yourself. It is essential and important. SO it does not matter if he ever calls or not . You must work through it to move on.<br>  <br>  Sometimes we just like the idea of someone before we realize we really don't like them or want them back if given the chance.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Someone wonderful is in your future.|`|4LZNeVLTaa	honey i am so sorry thats how it was with me i dated a man for almost 2 years and he knew me more then anybody and i knew him more then anyone its that feeling you get with them that confuses you when its over, ya know?<br>  i say go out now an hook up with another guy and then try to date someone new, go out with friends, party, anything that keeps your mind off of him and believe me sweetie, when you finally know your kindof progressing getting over him you wont cry as often every night, yu wont sleep in as long you wont do all that stuff you hate. so just go out and have fun hes an *** and someday hell regret loosing you or any other girl he cared about because hell realize none of that **** matters he was beign immature. hope you feel better now?
YvvYtsjNaa	I agree with Sasha, but you are sending mixed signals.  The way to clarify confusion is not by groping, clarification comes from honest talk, hard as that may be.<br>  <br>  My advice?  Tell him everything you put into your question.  If he's an okay guy, he'll understand (I don't know what is age appropriate here b/c you don't mention your ages).  If he can't understand, then your relationship is better off cooling down and out.  You won't get hurt (anymore than you are).  It's amazing how much can be accomplished by talking it out.  Yes, since I've been there, done that, I understand how hard that can be.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Hizsm6m4aa	He's probably waiting on a que from you so just go up to him and start talking like nothing ever happened and see if he responds. If you still feel awkward then he will too.|`|d12fc193df6e894edda9b94f5055d626aa	Maybe it's because you gave him a vibe that made him think you don't like him anymore. Just tell him you still like him, start talking to him more.|`|Q2dJhKJraa	Dont feel bad, he was harrassing you! <br>  You should not want to be around people that are trying to force themselves upon you...<br>  Youll need friends that will respect ur space and privacy!<br>  Leave him alone
Wrf5orAuaa	Start off slow and gentle. Don't attack her. Savour her taste, nibble on her bottom lip...gently. Gradually increase the pressure a little as you progress, then after while slip your tongue in a little, just to give her a taste. Then as she hots up slip it in a little further and wait for her to reciprocate. You're home free then, old son.<br>  Start the wandering hands.|`|oAYCestzaa	just lean in for it!! <br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER! <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai2pZCDwB34CnsZGpURxLN_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220195650AA7lvhd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|4CsGde1qaa	Ha ha. Not laughing at you, I just find it kinda cute what your situation is. First, go for a kiss on her forehead. Trust me, she will go crazy for you in the inside and she'll be the one to give you the first kiss on your lips. Whoa whoa!|`|lO83ZvrZaa	What you want to do for the first one is this: ( I did this ) Make sure you are alone, or in a quiet place, then sit close together for a while, hold her, or put your arm around her. Then, lick your lips and just go right in and kiss her cheek. Then, if she looks at you, and moves closer, lick your lips again, and just slightly tilt your head, close your eyes, and liplock. Try not to scrunch up or clack teeth. The kiss will last 3- 10 seconds and feel amazing! After the first, you can experiment a little. Try licking her cheek, putting a little " tongue " into the kiss, and try sucking ever so slightly.|`|a7888a2850dcd5bad23ff441f00fa3e9aa	Okay, so I'm going to share some techniques with you.  One, stand about a foot apart, and look into her eyes.  Test to see if she is ready by reaching  to her hair on the side and see if she is receptive to you running your fingers through her hair.  This is a sure fire way of seeing if she is comfortable.  Now, come closer (about 3-4 inches away) and continue to look in her eyes.  Don't kiss her yet.  Let the anticipation grow.  You'll both get those butterflies in your stomach, and the longer you wait, the more she will want you to kiss her.  Then go in for a light peck on her lips.  Make it slow and soft.  Don't forget to tilt your head so you don't smash noses.  Once the kisses grow and become more passionate, consider opening your mouth a little.<br>  <br>  Now, when you are ready for your toungue to enter in the game, do yourself a favor, (and her) and only put your toungue partly in her mouth.  Lightly, softly, lick the tip of her toungue, her lips, etc.  Don't shove it in there and choke her.  <br>  <br>  It takes practice, but fortunately, it doesn't take too long until you both have it down.  good luck, man!|`|lSooXAQTaa	Pour milk all over your partener. I works i swear. It also feels amazing.|`|IwTkZ4jiaa	hun, there isn't a technique behind it... it really does come naturally. just if you use tongue, let her lead it and try not to be slobbery (aka, dont try to put your tongue down her throat.<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  have fun with it and good luck, a first kiss is something to remember.|`|au0LLn4caa	It comes naturally.

Be clear about how it was when you were with the two guys, separately but don't go into detail.

Get into a good coversation with your "target" and as the conversation's about to break off and you're about to go separate ways, non-chalantly ask, "Wow, that was really great, we should continue this sometime. Wanna get some coffee sometime or something?" And then you're home free.

ZOakpNy7aa	He was looking and  hoping for a response that would give him the oppurtunity to turn the spotlight around and now the other party is causing difficulties in the relationship. This way he can justify it to himself and to their friends.Look at all the e-mails shes a phyco etc.etc. Always keep in mind. For every action there is a reaction.The best thing to do here is wait for that last e-mail and reply with 1 word BYE gl|`|mYhuGonfaa	Totally confused by the wording of your question. But I'll give it a shot.    If a dude broke up through email, chances are, he has been really wanting to do this for quite some time, but cares for the girl and once he faces her he can't stand to hurt her in that way and watch her emotions come out raw. I'm giving this guy the benefit of the doubt, I've been in the situation before where it's just heartbreaking to leave someone when you still care for them as a person it is extremely hard to face them and watch them be torn up inside.    The emails were him justifying more for his own benefit than for hers. He was trying to explain so that he didn't feel like he was hurting her for no reason. Sometimes when we start to write things out, they become even more clear than our own train of thought.    In the other scenario, he's just insensitive and didn't have the balls to tell her face-to-face.|`|AA11441704	Everyone is right.
5agXk9ldaa	ok. than she is not your best friend|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Just tell her you won't put up with it anymore - and then don't. She's not a good friend if she is doing this nonsense. And she won't HAVE any friends if she continues acting this way.|`|bAnyRNZUaa	Put your foot down! Until you do, she'll keep pushing and pushing to get away with what she can.  IF she gets mad, tell her "Oh well you'll get over it" and hang up or leave.  You got to get your respect here. Don't be a doormat!|`|3KsFfj0Paa	ohemgee.

Tyj0gtqZaa	You need to sit down and tell him that he doesn't have to walk on egg shells.  That you will warn him when your uncomfortable so he can stop.  Tell him that you have wanted to kiss him and I promise you, he will.  Don't make the first move, some guys don't like that.  But, if you think he would, go for it.  It sounds like he wants to be with you, he just doesn't want you to get scared and run away.  Just talk to him, that's about all that needs to be done.  Don't do it through text either, it has to be in person.  Everyone is so much more brave in a text.  It means more if you tell him you would like to kiss him in person.  I hope this helps and good luck!|`|S6cyPVz7aa	If you want him to KNOW that you are comfortable with him YOU should make the first move. You stated that in past relationships you were afraid of intimacy; well prove him wrong this time. Let him know that you are not afraid of free falling and that you are willing to take the next step. Its doesn't even have to be a romantic time when you kiss him. Kiss him while he's ironing his clothes or during an episode of friends. It doesn't matter, you're in charge this time. Kiss him.|`|A885td7Jaa	hmmm... talk 2 him about wat makes u feel comfortable... Ok now if u want him 2 make d first move( as some of us like d guy makin d first move) well den don make n e obvious moves like kissin him....wat u hav 2 do is initiate it.... act as a catalyst... create an intimate settin or somethin.... and do at his place...:)|`|6wxgyGy5aa	As soon as the mood strikes, make your move.  He's probably concerned about upsetting you.  You said yourself that you've had intimacy problems in the past so he's probably just trying to avoid getting dumped as soon as he makes a move.  Kiss him, get that overwith, then when you have the chance to, talk to him about what you're comfortable with.|`|87d4tt6Raa	Usually id say let the guy be the one to take the first step..but in this situation, your prob. gona have to....|`|E5n8tRKoaa	um...you could always do that thing like in Hitch. go ninty percent and see if he closes the gap. if not, he obviously needs to initiate it.    or you could just tell him you want to kiss him.
uGFzzLYWaa	Why do you care if she is or not?    She'll tell you what she wants you to know. And you'll never know if is really is true, or if she's just saying it because it's what you want to hear.|`|fEuBJ3ZNaa	After 2 months.|`|58jwkbbSaa	It's never a good time!  That makes you sound like you want to have sex with her and that's all you want her for. Don't be stupid, just don't ever ask.|`|MLdykhQNaa	I would say this is a subject she should bring up.  She could not be a virgin and think she's doing something you don't like and be hurt.  Or she could be offended.  If you're looking for just virgins...good luck.|`|L2RqeYedaa	It would be really bad for you to ask her. If she wants to tell you, she will. Asking about someones personal history is taboo.

It's not necessarily a time period of how long you know her but more of where you feel you are at during your relationship with her.  In my opinion the best time to ask would be when you and her start to become intimate.  If you ask before then she may think that you would want to be with her more and get in her pants because of the fact she is one.  In a relationship there's no reason to really know why one is a virgin until the time comes.|`|vgAsDc7Zaa	u should ask her after u both get comfortable with each other. it could be a month, or two, maybe even five. But u shouldn't say it too early because she might think u just want to get into her pants, which may or may not be the case. I personally don't mind when guys ask my that question because it's easier for me to talk to people, but every girl is different. She might be the shy type, or even the one that looks shy but actually is a chatty box. :P   hope this helpss :)))|`|qKayh9rvaa	It depends on the person and how long you have been dating and if you are ready to take that step.     I would wait a few dates to start talking about sex because you don't want to give the wrong impression (that you are trying to get in her pants).     You should bring the topic up, and express your standpoint. If she is willing to talk about it, then you'll have your answer. But if not, don't pressure her. If things are meant to work out they will.     The last thing you want to do is steer someone in the wrong direction because of a sex question.    Good luck.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Well, there's a 1/2 chance that she would lie to you.    I would wait a month or two into the relationship before you ask...that's if she's your gf. If not, then ask like half a year later.

Let her tell you IF and when she wants.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I think if you're close enough to have sex, you're close enough to ask about their sexual past, or lack of one.

0d0W0nbVaa	Girly man, how the hell are ya???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|1nk8WPrtaa	I don't know, but if it makes you feel any better, your detailed story made me get wet!|`|5r2Csdzwaa	Ok you DOLT did you just have a sex change or are you schizophrenic? Your wife just said the exact same thing.    You watch way to much of that new show "the United States of DOLTISM!"|`|atYX4Ytqaa	It sounds like she may be embarrassed or doesn't even know why herself, hence her reaction to your bringing it up. Lemme fill you in on something, when some women aren't in the mood it's just that! It does not necessarily mean it's has anything to do with you! Try talking to her again and maybe discussing what does turn her on and you wont run into her "not being in the mood". Just a thought. Good luck!|`|PMQWI1Ojaa	She was watching tv?  Maybe she just didn't want to?  Um maybe you forgot to brush your teeth?  There could be a thousand reasons.  Do you call her snatch a crotchal region?  Try calling it a snatch that might help.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Well she'd enjoy it if your d!ck wasn't so dang small.  Try some Extenze, see if it helps.|`|7ewzmiNEaa	Face it - you just aren't as good as her other partners !!|`|KILFoc6kaa	Once again GROW UP and make up your own stuff, Trolls who are lazy are not funny|`|0yLrQUdsaa	Hmm..maybe your pressurising her a little?  Or you could try some new moves on her, she might get wet for you then.|`|qHnSIwvgaa	I feel your pain. I hate the way women get sex when they want it but we don't. And then when they want it and you don't, they get pissy when you dont give it to them.  So unfair.|`|6luv6gb2aa	You have to turn a girl on mentally and it is hard. We as men are just more physical. In other words we are easy to turn on. So if your not turning her on the way she likes she just wont be into it. Stimilate her with your brain then let your body do the rest.|`|j3U6zjHzaa	Dude why would you share this nasty story on the internet? What the hell is wrong with you? I wonder why she isn't turned on your a frickin creep....and here's an idea keep your frickin personal stuff  to YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!!|`|oTPcaQ0Maa	Maybe she does not have a high sex drive? A lot of women only get wet when they really want sex......maybe she is cheating? i always didnt want it from my guy when i was cheating. i only wanted it when i was all hot over thinking about the next time iw ould see the guy.|`|NEWbh3Plaa	She must not have been in the mood.  It doesn't mean there is anything wrong with you, maybe it just takes more than a couple minutes of kissing and grinding to get her motor running!  Maybe try giving her a back rub, then make out then go down on her until she c*ms.  She might like it a little better than the grind!|`|bmQilXDEaa	Alright!!!  turning on a girl is not like a light switch. you need to take your time to arouse her. kiss her, touch her, say some nice things. girls get turned on emotionally and mentally, they need to feel special and not just like a piece off a *s* s.   You sound like a great husband, that loves you wife and really cares. this should definitely fix your problem|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	ahh I love the pre pubescent questions you come up with.    you two never fail to make me remember when I was 14.    HA HA AHA HA HA.  way too funny.|`|AA11826328	I do not know you or your wife nor am I a doctor but,I do not think that your wife is grossed out by you (your words) it maybe something totally different, sometimes women have issues that you guys (men) do not understand, and we all know that a man is not the most sensitive  creatures on earth at times, maybe you need to try to find out if she is under some type of stress at work or something or if she is going through some type of change in the body, we as women do have problems that you guys do not understand nor want to know about at times, you all just say go get it fixed and sometimes it's not just that easy.  Just a thought try talking to her and actually listen to what it is she is saying okay?  Good Luck....  Lil Angel|`|FNDxZIJWaa	She's just gotta be in the mood.|`|7ZqSiZqUaa	If your first move when making love is to just get on top of her, no wonder sex doesn't last long!  there's a very big difference between making love and f**ng - making love is *sharing*, f*i*g is *taking*.    treating a woman like an inflatable doll, there to be used, jsut get on top, get your fun, then get off,  tends to make any woman "pissy".    Trying  being a little less "me" and a lot more "us" would be a damn good start!|`|1BddUQxIaa	Girly man...ohhh, i love the name!! i just think you need more practice. i'm here if you need me. you can practice on me all  you want. you can practice moving your hips around my crotchal region.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	You said that you had sex a lot but only when she wanted to. So obviously she is not grossed out by you. Trust me, most guys that are only getting sex when their wife wants it, can not say that they have sex a lot.     It sounds like you have no clue how to please a woman in bed. Fast sex that is done in 2 minutes? Do you not have any control over your orgasms?     It takes a while to warm up a woman.     The first thing that you should keep in mind is that women need foreplay to become aroused. You jumping on her naked and grinding yourself on her is not going to instantly arouse her and make her wet. It will probably just annoy.     Do not confuse a woman getting wet as being the same as a guy getting hard. It isn't.     Learn how to make love to woman properly, control your premature ejaculations and then you will enjoy a good sex life.     One more thing......85% of woman can not achieve orgasm from intercourse without any clitoral stimulation. Some woman can only achieve a clitoral orgasm and never achieve a vaginal one their entire lives.     Do you really know anything about your wife's orgasms or her body?    Or is it all about getting your own orgasm?|`|lXE75yQjaa	I really don't know..but I think you have a future writing erotic fiction..good luck!|`|O3fcLsKMaa	It's not necessarily that, depending on how old your wife is women get to a point where we can't control whether or not we get wet.  It's just like guys who have a hard time getting hard.  It's not that you're not turned on, it's just your body doesn't always react the same.  It's not like you can control being turned on physically and your body reacting a certain way to it are all involuntary.|`|Btsctjydaa	You're gonna need a bigger beanus.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	Try asking her.

IvMPh09baa	aww... i'm so sorry, i can imagine how rough this is.<br>  <br>  I suggest to help fill your time you do something special for him while he is away.  Something he would really like.  You could organize all your pictures and make a photo book of your fav pics together, you could sew him a blanket, i don't know... find a craft or hobby that involves you making something special for him.  Hopefully that will kill sometime and also make you feel better because you'd be spending your time doing something special for him.|`|Awywcn2Caa	Well my husband works overseas, oil not military, but he is gone a lot. Sometimes I got to the video store and start a new season of a t.v. series I haven't seen yet. Now I have a lot of shows I like though! But it does pass time. I think you can do that with netflix too. or Abc.com will let you watch episodes from previous seasons. Maybe that will help you till the summer comes then You can swim or play tennis. Just try new things. I have found sports and things that I like and never thought I would. Good Luck!|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Stay busy.  Get involved with your FRG. Volunteer.  Clean the house. Get organized.

H9Bzw0VNaa	i think he likes you... He probably just feels the same way you do, scared to say something because of your wonderful friendship.  As tough as it is (trust me I know, I'm going through somewhat the same thing), you should say something to him or else you'll never know and will ALWAY wonder.  It's hard to find somebody we click with, and I think that when we do find someone, we have to make an effort to be with that person... The worst that can happen is things will be a little weird for a couple weeks but then you'll go back to being friends and you'll have your answer and will wonder no more.. The best being, you may have a wonderful loving relationship with someone wonderful just by being honest with someone you care about.   Good luck n i hope everything works out!!! =)    It can be soo dam tough bein a girl and not being able to read guys' huh?!?! lol  <br>  <br>  They should all come with instructions lol <br>  <br>  =)|`|jTAWyIzqaa	That is a little of mixed emotions. Its honestly sounds like he like you too, but maybe he wants the every girl for a girlfriend. Or it may just be he likes you too much to be with anyone else and not enough to get something going serious with you. If you like him you do you say 'i really think i do like him.' So you may have some homework to do as well. He maybe your obsession too. Does it bother you when you see him on other girls or hugging them? Or you dont feel nothing. A guy can be just as confusing as a girl can at times. Just tread carefully and tell him how you really feel. dont be around the bush and get it set straight. You can move on and forget about him, while other girls can only wish they knew what you did:) Good Luck.|`|eRtb2MZFaa	If you like him. tell him if he doesnt like you back oh well. your 16 you will find someone else i dont want to be rude but there are ALOT of guys out there|`|2dF53Qfjaa	well, u should try talking to him once. Tell him how much u like him. And dont do it for what ur friends and classmates will think. Just think about it and talk to him and see if it'll work out. If it doesnt dont wry he's one of ur best friends. you'll always have him
1cpCb5S7aa	forget wat that guy just said..in middle school it can seem like a big difference but seriously...not that big of a deal. my best friend is in college (in still a senior) and other best friend is in 8th grade. so...just treat him like u would any other friend your age|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	honestly find a friend your age|`|GsRpZJX5aa	well, honestly it doesnt matter how old you are or how old he is, dude be yourself if he doesnt wanna be friends go look for another not everyone will like you.

IcnilUuUaa	I think it means that you like who you like whether it be a boy or a girl.  You are not putting any restrictions on your feelings, and that is ok.
vqM01n5gaa	I used to be that way and now I'm not. You just have to stand up for yourself. People who are your real friends will probably be glad if you change. But If people don't like you anymore because you stick up for yourself then they were never really your friends to begin with.|`|oNHtVHzsaa	ok here is how you do it. you have to stand up for what you believe in, if they are stubborn to you you should be stubborn back. u can do it in a nice way, but letting down your beliefs is not good. good luck and say hi to all the people that don't step all over you now. : )|`|lBKfmRWCaa	Don't ever stop being 'nice', just stand up for yourself and call people on the issue when they walk on you. If someone is treating you badly tell them about it, if they continue to do so, then they are no friend of yours and you are better off without them.<br>  <br>  It is hard to be assertive and stand up to others if you are not used to it but if you start you will not regret it.|`|1UiYpUWiaa	do you mean small as in short or small as in not very confrontational? <br>  being nice is not the problem , speaking your mind is.<br>  sounds like you lack confidence in your opinions, most likely from fear of negative feedback , that's perfectly fine it's something  we all feel, some people take that fear and turn it to hatred lashing out strong words and insults , others avoid speaking all together of fear of being told they're wrong and being insulted for it.<br>  what you need to do is practice speaking your mind and blocking emotions from negative feedback that most people lash out at you,every time someone writes an article or an "answer" he risks being told by others that hes wrong or being insulted for speaking what he believes, i agree that some folks talk before they think but that doesn't mean that every thing you say has to be right all the time!<br>  all in all try to voice yourself more and more, take the good and block the bed, if your friends can't respond kindly to your feelings then that's their problem not yours!
ABhmJepFaa	That's it! "Did you dare to eat my chocolate?" You see! communication!|`|O1MITmaGaa	Haha, I think it's quite cute.<br>  <br>  but from his perspective, yes maybe a little creepy, unless you know him pretty well. and because it's via internal mail service, it's not as bad as it could be. my advice is to not get so worked up and, if you two just happen to cross paths, to try to get a conversation going and not be too obvious about it? I'm not sure, but it'd be cute if he one day looked back and was like..."SA...hey, that girl I met has those same initials..."<br>  <br>  best of luck to ya!|`|1zfwLsQpaa	I would probably find it nice, but if it didn't have a name i'd be quite frankly scared|`|wHgBnMipaa	I would be flattered, not creeped out!|`|3vZuEKU9aa	That doesn't seem creepy at all. If anything, it's more secret-admirer-ish. Still, it might be best to suck it up and ask him if he liked the chocolate you sent him; being shy and anonymus isn't going to get you anywhere.|`|Gk7BeNPSaa	ummm thinking about it. in the work place, bad idea to tell someonne you like them. So out of work, have fun with it i guess. i would believe that he's liking the idea of someone liking him.|`|8C8uufq6aa	Hi Emily;<br>  As you stated, he has no idea who sent him the chocolates, and you'll never know what he thinks of you (or your gift) unless you ask.  Perhaps when you see him next (and if the time is right, ofcourse) you might consider telling him you hope he liked the unmarked gift ... and that you didn't want to create any gossip, so you didn't put your name on it for that reason. If he is interested in a potential relationship with you, he will take this as a "green light" in getting to know you better. If he doesn't, and you get a "red light" by the way he acts, don't take it personally.  Sometimes people have relationships they don't disclose to other people in the office (and sometimes even to their family!)  So go ahead and ask him if he got the chocolates ... if he's worth the chocolates, then it's worth it to at least know if he liked them, and you!|`|61Fwbi79aa	It wouldnt be creepy.

hKss8M9Raa	I was the "smart girl" in high school (quiet but opinionated) that alot of  the guys were jerks to (I think now that I may have intimidated them). I also didn't have much of a clue as to how to wear my hair or do my make-up. I wasn't really into that much then. I remember once a guy was so mean that he actually made me cry on my birthday, so I know where you are comming from. Here's the good news: you get to start all over in college! Somehow between high school and college I actually went from a bit geeky to popular. In college, people actually knew who I was and I was asked out on dates even though I think I was only asked out by one guy from my school in Jr. High/High School (and he had asked a lot of girls out). But change can happen! Maybe it's time for a new look? A new hair cut or a new clothing style? New make-up? I'm not saying that those are things that people should like you for, but they'll make you feel better and the more you like yourself and are comfortable with yourself, the more others will like you and be comfortable around you too.|`|D0KuQ4Qeaa	dont let the little things make such a big deal in your life.theres inorant men every where but were not all assholes so try talking to a couple you might get more than you bargain for|`|02XrxUUsaa	you should talk to some loser guys and since they are losers, they are probably just as scared of u as u are of them :P anyway, u can use them as practice and maybe make a few friends in the process and then the next time a guy talks to u, think of great guys like maybe ur dad, if u like ur dad, or some other really sweet guy and remind urself that not all guys are mean! some can be but a lot are really nice guys and u should not deny them all cuz of some jr,high jerks!!!|`|i8wCVoMsaa	well~ i think am i having the same situation? i'm not sure, but when i first came to CA, i was almost like you, but bcz i was in a girl's school, so that didn't make much difference... but it'll be much better when you are in university or college, cuz the environment around you is changed, and you'll find yourself get used to it, and it comes natural, so i don't think you need to worry about it. If you are still really worry, then i suggest that you should open up the topic first, that is, you approach them first before they approach you... good luck anyway...|`|NQdRVj8oaa	Well since you have plenty of friends that are girls then just hang out with their guy friends. If those guys are being rude of being hurtful to you then your friends won't be pleased by that. Which I doubt they'll do since the guy and you will have a connection. Take care.
7GExJyJdaa	personally...that's my type. <br>  im shy and quiet too. most people would call us boring and weird, but personally i like the quiet and shy type. because we are a mystery and people are jealous because they don't know what we are thinking. people who are loud give out half of who they are, people have to talk and get to know shy people for them open up.<br>  in conclusion, i like shy and quiet girls because they make me think and dig deep to know their mind, not their body.|`|bO25ntW2aa	Yeah they do but you still have to put yourself out there and show them your personality or they wont notice you|`|MX1shAbcaa	Yeah.. i'm sure some do but if you don't put your self out there that much socially and show intrest in boys, fewer will like you. ~Will

That's why they wait for men to come up and talk to them rather than risk rejection by coming up and talking to men.  Also, the person who gets to accept or reject has power over the person asking.  That's why women wait for a man to ask her out.  So she has the power to reject him (or not).|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	You sound like you are still at the age where most girls are too shy to make the first move.

Casually ask her what makes her happy and what she likes to do. Since you are to young to drive then find out if you can go to any outdoor places where she lives. you could also send her flowers. That's always a nice gesture. Have you thought about playing pool, air hockey, or other table games? you could also invite her and some friends over and play some board games. If there's a local YMCA or gym you could see if they have a pool and go swimming.|`|UHZUpzQcaa	Maybe go to her house or yours and cook dinner together and have a movie night?

I always had fun doing that.  I understand what you mean about it not being safe to go anywhere.  Maybe you can find another couple do double date with and drive to a place where its nicer.  You could each go out on your date and meet back up to drive home.  You could try to find a place not too far away to go ice or roller skating.  What is she interested in?  You could invite her over to your house, cook dinner for her or have a picnic on the floor.  It depends on what type of girl she is.  I've always enjoyed keeping things low key and just having a good time together.|`|Cadyoy2Vaa	take her to a tittie bar....but youd have to be an asshole then|`|avcYe27Raa	take her out to eat :) or have her hang at your place sry u took all the good ones lol|`|WXHeV3vMaa	hay man listen i hav ben in that sitscawasin be for just be ur sellf that what thay look for then soon u will be in there pants
tK7XacH7aa	I view flirting as just talking with the person and laughing and spending time with them. Just talk like you would to your friends and you should be fine.  Make sure you show him/hint him that you like him though. And at least appear to be having a good time with him.
XH2o1MM6aa	.He really likes you.Some guys are quite happy if the girl takes the initiative.So have a nice night out together,even if it's a dance.You can still point im in the right direction.
0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	You're not alone. But to answer your question, common sense developed an ego as large as all outdoors (called narcissism) and our whole culture seems to have fallen into the toilet.<br>  <br>  ok, so actually it's not that bad, but we certainly seem to be living in a throw away society. The difficulty is that some people have blurred the boundaries (of common decency) and applied that reasoning to their relationships.<br>  <br>  Things have value because they are useful. When they are no longer useful, we discard them. The blurring of boundaries happens when this reasoning get applied to our relationships. Such as: Don't bother with so and so, he's useless. The inference is that he has no value and should be discarded.<br>  <br>  It seems that some people throw away their spouses as fast as they throw away an old radio.|`|AA12371168	honestly you can't learn common sense. either you have it or you don;t<br>  most people don't. and i agree with you on that.<br>  if they ask if cheating is wrong they are really trying for someone to tell them what you did isn't, like something or someone forced them to do it.<br>  but maybe it seems like more people are doing it, just being with someone till something better comes along or they just get bored.<br>  some people think that there is a gene for it or in some ones nature not to be with just one at a time..|`|Ne7xr36Saa	When I see a question posted that is so simple, such as "Is Cheating Wrong"...

I'll be looking at this to see some of the answers you get because you are probably going to get nailed to the cross tonight by trolls and people who aren't going to think this thru before answering..... see you later....

Some things are best learned on our own and some thing don't need to be studied.|`|ul6P8doWaa	Obviously, common sense has been thrown out the window.  Either that or some people just simply lack it.  Don't worry, you're not the only one who feels like that.  I feel that if people have to ask then they view it as "a little bit on the justifiable side", not truly knowing the real definition of what "cheating" is.<br>  <br>  **I agreed with everyone that answered and therefore, give all a "thumbs up"....good job!!!|`|oXb4Wy6qaa	I agree completely.

Have you ever seen the movie "Idiocracy"? That is what the average american person will be like in 500 years. So sad, but I totally agree. Sometimes I think its for attention & to get their crap on the computer, but why not do it with style? <br>  Bad Ex: My eyes are bleeding, what should I do? <br>  Good Ex: How should I get rid of an ink stain on my cashmere sweater? <br>  <br>  Common sense is about as common as a gold brick in a homeless shelter.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	People are dumb, especially on the internet.
JiiSUGkvaa	sorry but i agree with your friend. if he can't make a small sacrifice for you then he isn't going to make big ones. by saying he merely wants to sleep in tells me that he's being selfish and that getting an extra hour of sleep is more important than what's really important to you. he isn't worth it, either have a serious talk with him face to face or dump the good for nothing...
fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Be smart, and be a friend. He may be on rebound and if that's true, he might hurt you later. Be a very good friend, and let him make the move. OK if you flirt a little. But do not let him turn you upside down.|`|RRzcbvvXaa	just turn up that flirting! :] Let him know that you are interested in him, so that he will get the hint. Once he gets the message, he will ask you out if he is interested too. also ask for his number and text him :)|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I don't think it is such a good idea.

I would just take it as a compliment that he is flirting with you and leave it at that.|`|4sTDtz7kaa	Well I think he likes you because if he was flirting with you and trying to take things out of my pockets he is trying to get your attention.

They just belive what they belive, religion is not supposed to be about needing 'evidence' or proof to believe it, it is about having FAITH and pure faith in the information that is given to you. If they genuinely belive it and have the faith in them, they won't tell you that you are wrong when you say Jesus isn't real, they won't care because they themselves feel it so they won't say anything. Therefore, the people that say YOU are wrong, are the people that are posers. Because, in fact, both of you are right, in your own head, both of you are correct so it shouldn't matter what eachother think. If you were purely convinved Jesus was not real, you, yourself would not care that somebody else thinks he is because you have already made up your mind. Taken all this into concideration, whoever you are talking about, neither of you have pure faith in what you believe.

I used to get totally bent out of shape when a holier than thou christian walked in the room or even when I would see christian funded commericals on t.v. It surrounds us logical freethinkers.But the thing is, we can't get mad when someone has been spoon fed religion all their lives and is lead to think a certain way, otherwise we would be no better than them. The best thing you can do is educate yourself in their religion so you can debate it with them, you will not win, but in the process you may just show them a new way of thinking. Sociologically speaking, we as humans need an origin, and studies have shown that believing in a religion is actually healthier for you. It all comes down to having a crutch to lean on, and that is what religion is for most people. They are scared to ponder that there is nothing after death, that life has no purpose. The unknown scares them and they find solace in religion. Don't waste energy being mad, you can't change the world, you can only do what you can to enlighten them.|`|96b1b355d08c721076e9540b69416845aa	*Many* people are wrong about religion, but just don't realise it. I find it really amusing.
manL9Xcwaa	i would say you should haves tons of friends in elementary because everyones kinda friends with everyone noones really discoved "cliques" yet. <br>  in high school you should have a lot but mostly just a few close friends.<br>  <br>  and at college you should have the most.|`|OLJekQVwaa	What is the point of this question? Its like completely random. But if you truly must know, your right! But I think in college you find friends that last longer.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	I don't agree with you.|`|mbbBfKTtaa	you got it down perfectly!!
qdQAQxg0aa	leave a message. Stop overanalyzing.|`|wnBkuzpzaa	yeah, definately leave a message, she's into you. she just doesn't know who it is.|`|WQ3uCllqaa	Why didn't you just leave a message in the first place? Save you some trouble. She was probably expecting you to and you made her wait all this time. You goose...|`|h1omg1IPaa	leave a message, if its restricted she doesnt know that its you calling
e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	well, to be honest, the movies and dinner gets boring sometimes. <br>  <br>  instead, try renting a movie, staying at home and watching it. :)<br>  <br>  instead of dinner, try a picnic. (when the weather is nice) or take her out on a coffee date to a nice cafe, but at night, so it's not boring and predictable. <br>  <br>  or try putt-putting. it's actually alot of fun.<br>  <br>  if you live near a park, beach, lake, take a walk along there with a pet, or just you two..<br>  <br>  or, (my favorite) go out on a drive. a night. take her out in the country (if you live near one..) and take her star-gazing. its very uncommon and very sweet. :)|`|5Sa1vP5kaa	Supper and a movie<br>  or<br>  A walk in the park, or well, a walk anywhere, so you can get to know each other|`|qPRWDaRLaa	I would stay away from going to the movies, it's a cliche. Instead take her somewhere that's out of the norm - ice skating or roller rinks are great atmospheres for keeping the conversation going without it feeling too much like an interview. <br>  <br>  Some girls are into arcades (Dave & Busters), it just depends on the girl. <br>  <br>  Dinner is good too - keep it casual. <br>  <br>  Just keep it light and fun and you'll be in for a second date.|`|mR3z2hFzaa	where do you live? find a park or a mall and walk around and get to know   <br>  each-other, talk about personal things (not too personal) her life and what she wants to do after school.....ask her what would be her dream guy and then ask if you qualify (it might sound silly but it works) make sure when you ask her this, its a good time, make sure a lot of humor  is going on between you and her...make her laugh.......email me if you have more interest in getting with her ill be glad to help!|`|tT04bRLraa	ha dont think so much about it. the simplest things tend to work out. something as easy as jus going to a movie. out to dinner. the obvious ones. jus go somewhere where you can be alone and have a good time
AA11777912	tell her you like her nose the way it is|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i think you can be honest and say that you support her and will help her, but you don't know much about the process<br>  <br>  i think she will appreciate that you are caring and you just don't know<br>  <br>  i don't know anyone who has had plastic surgery either, so i would have to be honest with them<br>  <br>  does she need a ride to and from the hospital?<br>  does she want you to pop in and see her? bring her movies? candy?<br>  <br>  there are lots of ways to support her<br>  :)|`|1umOKLqoaa	Don't do it. People will make fun of you. If you show up in school/work with one nose and the next month with another nose you will be laughed at. Ashley Tisdale remember? Plus everyone loves natural beauty.|`|T0Kg2IHSaa	tell her to suck it up lol jk sorry for being rude.<br>  tell her that everything will be fine because they are professionals.<br>  And im sure it will turn out fine!|`|qOBinxDsaa	Tell her shes perfect the way she is and doesn't need plastic surgery to change herself xD|`|vqsfiJgTaa	tell her to keep it regular!      dontt be araid telling her!<br>  <br>  <br>  pleasee help me with my questions! xxx|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	Tell her to check out the doctor thoroughly.  Check with the state to see if there has been any complaints and ask for references.<br>  <br>  This isn't a time to go with the cheapest estimate.  Get a good doctor.<br>  <br>  However, there are risks with any surgery.  So, she must understand that the results may not be exactly what she was expecting.|`|2tqdTCPQaa	first of all i agree with most....no plastic surgery would be safest and better because she should be happy with herself but alot people get something in their mind and want to do it...and i mean maybe she's not happy and thats what will make her happy....first if she is for sure she wants to go through with it...she needs to find the best surgeon to do it...cause that matters alot...do some research on surgeon and see if you can actually find people in reality thats been to them and ask their opinions...because sometimes you cant believe whats on tv or other things.....but be there for her through the whole thing...before by helping her prepare and get the facts about it.....and after...for support...and she will most likely need someone or thing to take her mind of the pain....so be there for her....sry so long lol|`|TyRjrSWLaa	dont do it! seriously unless she wants to end up like michael jackson just dont do it! there is nothing nastir than a fake nose trust me. tell her to keep her regular nose cuz thats just nasty. think what people would think if they found out what she did. so yeah DONT DO IT! its that simple|`|j4Mjc4Ecaa	Just be there for her!  If she goes through with this she'll need a ton of support.  Between the healing and the constant rumors after the nose job, someone has to have her back at all times.  Best of luck to you and your friend :]|`|QG1w0t2daa	You should tell her not to make any surgery, you know having natural beauty is BEAUTIFUL! <br>  <br>  okay, think in this way, would you think it's okay to sacrifice her health for a nose?|`|Dz5c3R0Iaa	i would just see how she weighs it . <br>  would she rather maybe have a pretty nose <br>  or have it look worse then it is ? <br>  its really her choice and some people have to do crazy things to be happy with there selfs .|`|kIpDDVc9aa	Aww, I would tell her she should accept what she looks like and not go for plastic surgery. Everyone's beautiful in their own way! :)
ulcL6cf9aa	i was in an EXTREMELY similar situation. If you guy are friends it is different then admiring from afar, but if you have just talked to him a few times, well, its a completely different situation. Some times (i am 13 to just saying) you get so caught up in how much you like a guy that you stop seeing all the things that are bad about him. This guy that i liked, I only talked to him sometimes..... and i REALLY thought i liked him for a while. probably like 2 months. Then roomers started getting out and he always acted all weird ed out around me. Then i started to notice how immature he was... ok moral of  the story, half the time the guy that you think is perfect and will love you forever once he asks you out isn't that guy. So why don't you get one or two friends to come over one of them should be another boy. then invite your crush over on the same day, make everyone crapes, and  just talk. its a great way to get to know a person, and chances are after you guys talk, you will find that you have a lot in common and he will probably like you if he doesn't already. or maybe you will end up not likeing him anymore and you guys can just be distant friends.|`|6TcRi70Yaa	If he is asking if you like things that he finds attractive in girls, he's probably considering you as a potential girlfriend.<br>  <br>   You should text him your feelings since you're comfortable with that method of communication.|`|oifGKbyCaa	if u wont ask him if he likes u. than ask 1 of ur friends to ask him if he likes u.or just text him.|`|t2sTqzu9aa	Well, ask him out or just tell him how you feel if you don't want to go that far.<br>  <br>  If he texts you all the time, he isn't just going to go "eww" or run away. And if you do get rejected, it'll be easier to move on.|`|qjEx8esgaa	if you really like him that much, then just ask him he likes you
IkrnvC2Naa	randomly text him nd ask for homework!<br>  then if something happened funny in the class a week later use that as an excuse to text him and be like omg did you see... today!<br>  goodluck :)
nwUCxz9maa	Just ask if you can use it, don't actually ask to have it. If you act kind've cute at the same time he'll probably hand it over without thinking twice and say you can keep it. Guys pretty much don't care about any old type of equipment/gadget once they get a new one.
nBQeSu2faa	If they are screaming at each other..there may be some other problems going on in their marriage...and alcohol does not help in these sort of situations    Don't get involved at all, keep out of their way.    You could arrange to meet your brother at another time..just the 2 of you. You seem very young to be drinking, so maybe you need to stop drinking.     I like a drink, but I have learnt over the years. When people don't know how to handle their drink or do not know when to stop...I can guarantee you there will always be trouble.|`|eh47fie6aa	She's screaming at her husband for letting an underage child drink. <br>  1 point for her.|`|GwQIYl56aa	I understand that your brother is just being a cool bro for hanging out with her little sister.. but he shouldn't be letting you drink!|`|PlVh12fpaa	just ignore the *****, when you see your bro maybe go for a work together. or do something with her not around.|`|8zgFyfibaa	Well, for one you are underage your 16. Second maybe she's screaming at him because he's setting a bad example giving alcohol to a minor. So I can't blame her, <br>  <br>  Not to be mean but, your brother is not such a "GOOD" brother if he's letting her 16 year old sister drink beer.
pblY82mWaa	just tell her what she wants to hear. start off with some random small conversation, like about homework or something, and once u get to know her u will have more things to talk about and then it will come naturally. When u guys get closer ask her out on a date.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
pGOvVUu2aa	It means getting stoned. marajauna. April 20th is National Marajuana Day. Hence the 420.|`|0jQcNWITaa	Hi there - 420 friendly means that the person smokes dope. So they want to make sure you do not mind if they do.<br>  Be careful and good luck!|`|85tAhnM9aa	Are you friendly with the idea of smoking pot. 420 is april 20th, national smoke pot day or something.|`|9hbsuDJFaa	We are "420 Friendly"<br>  <br>  Check us out at <a href="http://www.Four20.tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.Four20.tv</a>|`|T1mm8bWdaa	Not entirely sure, but I'd assume it means okay with smoking weed. 4-20 (April 20) is known as weed smoking day. It's basically a day where potheads smoke more than usual.|`|CYDNgWBVaa	is means u smoke weed
lFFhcoXZaa	Try this:<br>  1) Push the car down the street far enough to where you can start it without alerting your parents.<br>  2) Loan your car to a trusted friend a few hours earlier. Then have him wait around the corner with the motor running when it's time to make your get-away.<br>  Good Luck.<br>  PS - I'm going to phone your parents and rat you out, ha-ha.
AA11777912	it really depends on the girl<br>  and it depends on your personality<br>  i dont think race is a big deal|`|bo4MguzVaa	one of my best friends had an obsession for asian guys with long black hair.  I didn't dig it myself, but I think everyone has their own taste.  I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but she was shorter so her height complements the asian boyfriends height.  I'm 5"11 and I think maybe because the asians I knew where so short, I just couldnt think of dating them seriously (and vice versa).  Good people tho.|`|alxuJVsCaa	Depends on who you are and how well do they know you. Some White girls can just like Asian guys, because they're hot.|`|8d41beedea7b54aa494a0183d13589c0aa	Nope .|`|kVnvtgeuaa	Son keep on chasing 'em White girls.

It depends on the girl :)|`|muHctmaGaa	It's usually a personal preference, but I wouldn't be opposed to dating an Asian guy. I've already dated Asian (Chinese and Taiwanese) girls. And I happen to know dorky girls who watch too much anime obsess over Japanese guys in visual kei bands, so...|`|ENl3pqnGaa	well i do. i do know a lot that don't, however. some girls find it weird being with a guy who's a tinier build than they are.|`|rlEoPwjEaa	Some do and some dont...<br>  <br>  its a personal preferance.|`|Qi72Npkkaa	depends on ur girl
j4Mjc4Ecaa	haha she sounds complicated lol!!  anyway maybe she blames you for breaking up w/ her ex...cause you know you asked her out when they were dating.  I know it wasnt your fault...but sometimes girls can be well naive.  Another reason could be the fact that you two became friends.  I had this one guy friend who started asking me out and all, and when I said no things became veryyyyy awkward.  It was easier for me to hate him than to be friends while I knew he liked me.

If your like not that good looking then she will probably hate you. When she hated you at school it was because she saw you everyday. At summer you texted her a lot so she must've forgot about your looks. When you see her again she'll be like ''Ugh, I remember his face.''. The memories of hatred come back into her head and BOOM she hates you.|`|fgvBhOL1aa	LOL, sorry idk why we, girls, do this. It seems very weird and it doesnt make sense. But they are just confused and all they can do to escape the akwardness is try to convinced themself to not think about that. I can't really explain but ....umm...I suggest that you just ignore her and avoid her for a long time|`|AA10547149	you don't have to have just one girl friend.

But you made me LMAO, and you had a reason to call her that. XD But girls always seem way more confusing with love. I like this girl so much that no one understands. Its CRAZY, she doesnt like me though. Love is a pain in the a$$. You will find someone better, but if you still like her, tell her your really sorry and that you wish you could be friends again. Tell her that you feel differently than you did  awhile ago. Hope this helps!|`|dTt2gyJgaa	seems like shes not into you bra...its like shes playing games with you because she likes the attention your giving her. Im telling you I've been in the same exact position. EXACTLY!...THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO! you gotta find another girl....go out with her....forget about the other girl for a while.give her no attention what so ever ! (except once to show her you've found someone else..[make her jealous]. Once some time goes by she see's that the girl really likes you and you've been together for a while she will now want you more than ever.

RSm8aXgzaa	Sorry but you're nothing special.  You're actually kind of off key in a couple spots.  And if you can't go as high as Britney during the chorus, you probably aren't fit for the job of being a "future pop star."  Your voice is kind of weak and really moany.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	You have a okay voice, not the best, but you do this weird breathing thing where we can hear your breathe when you sing.|`|EMYImof1aa	um better than mine|`|mBUfy9zMaa	You have a great voice sweetie, my only advice would be to choose a song you can reach all the notes to.  Your an alto, and during some of those high parts you just stopped singing.  And to be a pop star, you have to know what songs suit your voice well, and that song was great, but it could have been better too.  Dont ever forget that.  Keep on working, and maybe try out for American Idol, I think you could make it really far, good luck sweetheart, I hope I helped some!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Omg absolutely ^-^|`|QHASqNDtaa	What does this have to do with singles and dating?|`|vKDwaqPraa	is your avatar a girl or a boy|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	You want the honest truth, I assume?  Your voice is incredibly plain and generic.  You sound a lot like the 100s of other young girls trying to be pop stars.<br>  <br>  The thing you all have in common is that you do NOT have great voices.  You have ordinary voices that can carry a tune.  Nothing special, really.<br>  <br>  However, with the right producer and sound editors, you could sound good enough to sell CDs.  But is your voice "good?"  In a word, no.|`|2XTkSV4daa	Yes you're great!! Except why don't you show yourself when you sing instead of this black screen? Nobody wants to watch black. Boring!

lRNAlYyXaa	Oh woah all the girls hug him? That is a tough one. There are so many question marks i'm not sure what you're asking.|`|RrBdmpa1aa	The best thing you can really do is confront it to him because you guys are friends and that's the best choice that is what happen to me and this guy i knew very well and he actually told me how he felt and it was very very sweet never knew if that was going to happen but it did now hes my best friend and on and off Again crush. But to that is just a way of you guys connecting in a way you feel you like him  in an other day you might be like. It actuallty depends on how you guys are around eachother. <br>  <br>  You should tell your friend to let you think about it becuase you nevr if your going to change your mind. It can happen trust me and then tell him if she sets you up with him say to him how you feel and talk like you normally do its the most humble and interacting way you can do when you have a situation like this. <br>  <br>  I hope i can help and bets wishes with you and him! :]]|`|bYvGNvrvaa	Your explanation is sort of choppy but it sounds like you should ask the guy you like out, you'll never get anywhere in life if you dont take risks.|`|jZ1g2pahaa	ask him out, whats the worst that could happen?|`|z6CBWSnFaa	lol.

wHgBnMipaa	I like to think of human beings as polymorphous individuals, meaning we are born sexless and then we all choose who we are attracted to.  You shouldn't feel at all strange by being attracted to both genders.  It could be a stage, but even if it is, who cares?  This is you, and you are the only person you are accountable to.  If today you're attracted to a girl and tomorrow to a boy, then that's just the way it is.  Live your life.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	You're bi-curious for certain, so why don't you experiment and find out for sure? You've nothing to lose.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	You sound bisexual. You don't have to pick one gender, just date who you want.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	If you're just looking that doesn't mean you're bisexual after all, women are better to look at.  Many women look at other women for different reasons, it's okay to admire other women's body.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	I think its natural to notice all good-looking people. I am strait but my husband and me talk about how other women look|`|ktOoGh6oaa	not really sure you might be just a stage. on a second note i like bisexual women :D|`|83bG38iBaa	in my opinion bisexuality doesn't exsist. it's just a stage people go through. they aren't sure whether they are straight or gay. it's when the person tries to find them self and what they want. again this is all in my opinion.<br>  <br>  second, you mentioned that you look at the male gender more so you are just probably wondering what the other side has to offer since you know what the male is like to date but that feeling of being with the same sex that you probably dont know about attracts you to think of it and wonder.<br>  <br>  i hope this helped but remember dont take my word for granted this is all in my opinion.
hYRP0x2Eaa	Sometimes we can't go back to the way things were, and forcing it makes it go in the totally wrong direction. Try apologizing to your friend and let her know that you don't want a guy to come between you two. No matter who this guy chooses, even if he chooses neither of you, tell her that you two will always remain friends. Long after the boys have gone.<br>  <br>  In order for any of this to work, you have to want to put your best friend before the guy. You must be able to accept the fact that he may choose her. Because you can't preach to her about remaining friends, then when he chooses her you totally flip out. You have to stay true to your word that you won't let this ruin the friendship. Hopefully she will stay true to her word as well.|`|HxHvhZAsaa	how do you find out hes your best freind? is that something you should already know? havnt you ever heard of hoes before bros? dont be skanks, then you wont have these problems|`|mIyUCey4aa	Talk it out. If she is willing to sit down and have a mature conversation with you about the situation then you two should continue to be best friends. If she refuses, well, maybe your relationship with her isn't as important as it is to you. The only thing you can do is approach her and try to talk it out. Go from there. Good Luck to you both!|`|9ckWrYxoaa	apologize... its dumb to fight over a guy with your bestfriend.

ZRgLHW3maa	well, haven't you ever heard, that when women are happy they gain weight? when a girl gets comfortable with a guy, then she will eat more and gain weight and it is so easy for women to gain it too.! when I started dating my fiance, I gained alot of weight, but he says nothing about. if you really love her and still think she is sexy and adorable no matter what, then deal with it.|`|ABAcvFVbaa	are u for reals dude just tell your girlfriend that u like her no matter what but that she need to take care of herslef becuase well ur freaking out and well i must say chocolate there bomb i am having the same problem with my weight but i am working on taking it off|`|231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	how old are you two? <br>  maybe you should offer her a gym membership for the two of you. say its something you can do to spend more time together.|`|LnibEXzHaa	that's a toughie.. <br>  is she gg thru some tough phase or having a trouble tt's making her eat so much?<br>  maybe u 2 can look thru some of the old photos tog or smthg tt will spark her to realise that she is gaining more than she shld?|`|bbLkL3JNaa	Ask her if she could join you at the gym together, or start going for nice hikes or bike rides with her.

Because most girls eat bunches when they are depressed, its weird but true. Talk to her to see if she is depressed or something is wrong, but you should know not to say nething to her face.

DO .. everything.<br>  <br>  Ok, here's what I mean by that:<br>  The situation of your girlfriend gaining weight & you wanting to do something about it is like walking through a field of land mines. Make one comment about her weight, and BOOM, you're dead (per say). lol.<br>  The best way is to tip toe around this issue, not saying to ignore it, but you are going to need to be both sensitive and sneaky!<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is to first uncover her eating habits. Where does she usually eat the chocolate /nachos/ pizza etc? At home? at school? With you? by herself?  What's she doing when she's eating?.. watching tv/ movies? reading?<br>  <br>  Alot of "couple" activities are also centered around eating, or atleast encourage it in some way. Cuddling and watching movies= popcorn/ chips/ pop etc... Basically, being a couch potato encourages these types of eating patterns. Try to understand where and when she's eating, maybe she's just bored and needs something to do with her hands. If you do decide to watch a movie, maybe have healthier snacks available like veggies & dip or ricecake snacks. If she asks you what's up with all the 'weird' new food, just say "ah.. i've just been thinking lately that i'd like to start eating healthier". (sneak factor)<br>  <br>  My best advice would be to get up off that couch, no more watching movies (except once in a while) and get out there! If you take an initiative to become more active with her, she won't be sitting idle munching on food. Go out and do things! Go bowling, play pool, go snowboarding / skiing.. go to the public indoor pool . go for a walk! <br>  That's a great one, suggest to her that you take a walk every night (be prepared to go with her!) Holding hands, looking at things with her sweety, ah, it won't even feel like exercise!<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is be supportive by being involved in the initiative to get her healthy. Be prepared to get involved, be energetic and outgoing. Maybe sign you two up for a class? kick boxing.. SO FUN. Spin biking? awesome.... Find a local gym or community center around you, they're always offering programs you can join. Most are pretty fun, and if you do your homework, some are pretty cheap!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck with this, stick with it & I guarantee you can get your girl back into shape in no time. :)
fOS41FAfaa	To me, men and women are equal. So it wouldn't matter. <br>  <br>  Some people are old fashioned and view it differently, It really depends on how old you are. If you do decide to ask him out, don't do it in public, it might embarrass him, and make him feel less masculine.<br>  <br>  To be honest, you should already know if he would mind or not if you're interested in him. If you don't even know that much about him, how could you know if you're interested or not. Get to know him more, before you try anything.|`|eAVMxMoMaa	I find it weird but <br>  then again i've never had a <br>  boy friends.

If you really love the guy, then go for it. Nothing should ever stop you if you really love him. For my Dinner Dance the night of graduation, I really liked this guy and I got the courage to ask him to dance with me. He wasn't dancing with anyone and seemed kinda sad.. I don't really like seeing him sad and stuff. So I just pulled all my guts together and asked him to dance with me. In reply, he smiled and said, "Sure, but I don't know how to dance." cus it was to a slow song haha. I don't regret it at all. Just go for it and see what happens. :] Good luck~!|`|8846f0723125b971fca35939e79a874daa	If I were a woman, I wouldn't.  <br>  <br>  1.) Suppy and demand.  Don't create an imbalance from the get-go, where he thinks you're always going to come to him, and chase him.  Bottom line: down the road, he might get lazy, stop pursuing you (if he ever began), and perhaps might get to a point where he thinks he's above you (that's understatement, by the way).  The female authors of /The Rules/, or whatever that book was a decade ago, were onto something -- be the chased, not the chaser.  Be in high demand, not in oversupply.  Romantic notions about this entire subject are nice, but let's stick with realism, the track record of human nature, and fundamentals of choice and desire.  You want to be sure that he /really/ chooses you.<br>  <br>  2.) More often than not (not true in all circumstances), men who don't take initiative with women tend to lack initiative in other areas of life.  If I were a woman, I wouldn't want anything approaching a loser or a coward of a boyfriend (or, heaven forbid, a husband).  That would be my greatest worry.  I wouldn't want someone who's afraid (of me, no less).  I'd want a successful (as possible), well-educated, confident, strong man.  Someone who's either socially at ease, or self-disciplined enough to be self-confident.  Ideally both.  In the animal kingdom (and in humanity), males compete with each other over scarce resources (females; and also in the case of humans, money).  The losers of the competitions become the lone wolves, exiled.  The winners -- some might crassly call them alpha males -- get the entire herd of females.  If I'm a woman, I go with the winner -- the genetic and Darwinian champ.  Why would I do otherwise? <br>  <br>  3.)  It's just more fun, no?  I imagine it's far more fun when a man chases you.<br>  <br>  4.)  During those periods when men aren't chasing you -- who cares!   Spend that time improving yourself (educationally, career-wise, monetarily, etc.) and your community.  Think Eleanor Roosevelt.|`|xrDzG0uKaa	Even though it is generally the guy that asks the girl out, it is still perfectly fine for a girl to ask out a guy. I have heard of alot of situations where the girl asks out the guy. If not the girl gives really big hints that she is interested in going out with the guy for example, one of my friends had been talking to the girl for ages and they both seemed to really like eachother but the guy didn't think that the girl would go out with her. anyway the girl send him a text saying : "do you think we will ever end up going out?" that gave the guy a very obvious idea that she liked him and the went out.

When he asks who it is and how you got his number just say who you are and that you got it from your friend. He will probably be relieved since you're both shy!!
ZjM0ghSnaa	I know its hard, especially when you have alot of feelings for this guy.<br>  All you can do now is be grateful that you two are still friends and can hangout. Most people dont stay friends, and it makes their whole friendship akward and messed up after a relationship has ended. Just keep in mind, that one day its possible for the two of you to get back together again, when he is stable enough to have a gf.

What should matter is your inner beauty, nothing outer. So keep looking, and I'm sure you'll find someone who is right for you.|`|p61Msx1zaa	OMG im tall as well but not that tall dont worry you will find someone my aunt is 6 3 nd had some bfs in high school and is now happily married dont worry you will find a really tall guy  and you should be a model!!|`|kX0aXkfBaa	oh wow 6'3"? thats really tall, haha. but dont let that get in the way. most guys love tall girls. im wayy too tall for my age too, but i dont let that bring me down. if a guy really likes you, they'd like you for you, nd not what you look like.<br>  hope this helps :)|`|6cpxxh8taa	find a guy thats 6'4''?<br>  maybe that will solve your problems? ;)|`|70pJeJ2Aaa	lol trisha you tuck it right out of my mouth just dont wear high heels<br>  im 6'8 but im a guy so idk but hang in there|`|w4XbSuB5aa	Just find a guy who is taller than you, won't be too hard cuz there;s a lot of tall ppl in high school. good luck hope u find a tall guy!|`|du5MNrQ6aa	find a tall one...<br>  <br>  or a midget...<br>  <br>  elevator smell different to midget.|`|wYK4Ye2Daa	Wow.

I, personally HATE them.  We pay for the welfare of lazy *** people that just don't want a job because they live off of OUR salaries and they complain that their 50" plasma tv is too small.  Unless you're disabled, which i suspect you're not, i suggest you take this question off of here before you really piss some people off.|`|r7sgshwKaa	What was the crime? I mean if you had nothing to do with it then why did you still get arrested?  I think you have bigger worries than your foodstamps being returned back to you, Your first priority is what to do about being arrested. You should talk to a family member of a friend about your foodstamps, Usually a friend or family member can get them for you, unless the foodstamps you have dont belong to you in the first place.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	You are writing us from jail??Just tell your caseworker exactly what happened.
mJbwemH8aa	Yeah me when the police gave me a ticket and i lost my job, whats going on here with u man??? is it a series or what?|`|GzL8X6vTaa	What power does it have?    It is the same as cash but you can only buy food with it.    I'm sorry I don't understand what you mean.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Nope  .. eating can be habit forming.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	No, it'd be nice to have someone else pay for our groceries|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	I know people who trade them for cash, buy cars, buy drugs.  they have a lot of power.  Oh, ya, ur the hedghog.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	Underestimated the power of food stamp?    I think there are people out there who abused the usage of food stamp.  They use food stamps to pay for the fun food, not the necessary food.    I suppose food stamp is powerful, in the sense that it feeds your children, if you don't have money to pay for your grocery.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	After running through that mental checklist of just what 3 bucks a day can buy.... can't help but be disgusted by the rampant fraud in the food stamps system.  It's a JOKE!  Stand at your local Kroger's...Safeway...whatever grocery store...you'll see it.  The people NEEDING food stamps have the ramen, bread and hot dogs.  The people abusing food stamps have steaks, sodas and candies. It's a joke.  Food stamps should not be the means to host a slammin' neighborhood barbeque.   But lets talk about the WIC program, its an even bigger farce.   People trading juice for cigarettes! lol|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Probably those of us who can afford to pay cash or credit for food.
mJbwemH8aa	Why do u want a divorce/.?? he seems a good person?? why the heck did u marry him in the first place....    Call yr lawyer and sue him for that.. then he will pay everything including yr lawyer charges.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	He probably does not want to put up the money. Get a loan or borrow the money and pay for it yourself. Move on and someday you will find real love.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	He's playing cruel mind games on you.  Go to Friend of the Court, explain your situation, and they should be able to help you.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The biggest thing here is unless you come up with the money, this attorney has every right to drop this case and then you will have to start all over. If this happens and probably will contact your local legal aid association for free help and sue your ex to be for everything youre legally entitled to. Save whatever paperwork you have from this attorney as it might save you some time but it looks like you have no choice here at all. So get ready to go to plan B and start again. Sorry and good luck|`|xHxi9p0Vaa	I had to find money wherever I could when I got my divorce. I borrowed from my family, I took the cash value of my life insurance policy, my 401k money... and finally, I had to arrange a payment plan to my attorney that he could live with. Could you talk to your lawyer about making arrangements?|`|AA10925759	If this was such a serious thing you would be using your words, caps and all of that.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	What does he tell you in his emails? You can email him, or call him you know.  Communication is non existent no wonder you have no idea what to do or what he wants to do.   Fire your lawyer and finish it up on your own.  He is in another city chances are he wont show up for the court hearing and youll get to do things your way. He hasnt done anything cause he doesnt want to spend the moooolah.  Most lawyers will close out the divorce and just put their fees as his responsiblity. I cant imagine just dropping the case then he cant collect.  If you ask him to put it in the divorce decree then he can sue your ex or garnish his wages. In the meantime hurry and put a hold on his tax refund so you get the whole refund to pay the lawyer.
71VRvldJaa	Jesus would stand by broken hearted but He did give each and every one of us free will so that means they can choose to do that!  However, for every choice you make...good or bad....there are consequences that they are held responsible for.    .....that's where I come in!    What would I do?  If he was a work experience lad.....which I'm assuming you mean like a co-op student....I would report it to the school and let them deal with it.  Not only is what she doing morally and ethically wrong.....it's illegal!    If I ever thought a Teacher or Employer was doing something like that with my underage son, there would be hell to pay!|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	I'd confront her about it. Let her know that she needs to stop or at least be more careful. If you catch her again you'll be forced to tell HR, because what she's doing is illegal, he's underage.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	Confront her that You know and that it is illegal.

If not I'd think about moving on.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Not that long unless we were under 17. Even then it would be hard. (yes that's a pun)|`|NUCCIFRtaa	Just wait until she say yes.. Never force woman.. If you force her, she will think that you love her just for the sex.. That's my opinion.. =D|`|3Z4YFz29aa	yes  sex does NOT equal love    love is more about respect than sex|`|7d2RmZb7aa	Love makes us do crazy things.

Either she might be waiting cause she is really that much into you, or she isn't and just stringing you along.

IrquK9N6aa	I had this problem with my husband last year. I decided to put together a wicker basket (which of course he didn't want, so I picked out one I liked!) Inside I put a bunch of his favorite things. I put body wash, men's shampoo, razors, shave gel, gum, a movie. You get the drift. I just filled it with alot of little things he likes. He loved it!  Hope that helps!  Trina|`|WQ1sjTPDaa	just give nice kiss on his eyes|`|TUNvbXbgaa	my husband and i do not do valentines day we both think it is over rated and a hallmark day. but you could cook him a nice romantic dinner with candles lit. buy him a nice romantic card.  you can get him a nice watch.|`|itbkP9HGaa	My husband and I don't do gifts.  We don't eat out, either, because we can't stand the wait.  We normally buy some quality steaks, grill, and have a romantic evening at home with a bottle of wine....and our 2 kids. lol.
el8yX5q3aa	yep you do need help.  so go find some.  OK?   there are free clinics and you need to get a better image of yourself and some options.  Getting help can give you those options and give you some different insights into opportunities.    You need some new friends too.  Get outside the circle you are in.  Join a church group or something and get away from people you know.  You are in the wrong circle.    Why don't you write down all the things you think are wrong.  then take one thing.  Work on it. forget everything else.  Manage one problem at a time....it won't be so overwhelming.    Please seek help....you are God's gift ....and God doesn't  make junk!   don't destroy it.    But get some help.|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	Don't put yourself down and don't blame yourself.  You're still young and you can't just lose hope like that.  You're in pain, it hurts that you're in that situation.  But having a negative way of thinking just make it worse for you. Forget about yourself for a moment think about other people who are in worse situations than you.  So many people want to keep their life longer, starving, divorced, heartbroken.  Don't feel like you're worthless.  You have a choice to be more positive, change how you view things instead of choosing to be miserable and ending your life.  You're feeling this way because you think you're no good.  Instead of wasting energy thinking, how about jogging or going for a walk.  Let the negative energy out, start exercising so you lose some weight.  Try going to employment agency if you're really desperate for work.  Go to stores, restaurants, wherever just ask for application or just hand in a resume.  You have to act rather than worrying and putting yourself down.  Change the quality of your mind. Buena Suerte!|`|BUET39wmaa	your life is worth more than all those reasons put together!!!  call a suicide hot line and get someone on the line to talk to|`|utGddhnVaa	have you ever wondered what the next 19 years are gunna be like? there's no need to end it. Your only gunna hurt people around you. Its very selfish to kill yourself.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	First of all, I think that you need to PUT DOWN THE ADVIL.  You are going through a rough time, but IT WILL PASS.  Second, I think it is great that you are living with your parents and have a place to stay.  Especially because they can keep an eye on you while you're going through this.     Girls are different than guys when it comes to attraction.  True, physical is a part of it, but it sounds like you are lacking confidence.  Confidence is a HUGE part of the female psyche.  Toughen up, get out there, and show a girl that you are tough.  We LOVE big guys who are tough.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	suicide is NEVER the answer. however, u CAN try reloc8ing. the recession problem is a fact of life that we must ALL deal w/. welcome 2 adulthood. what u CAN do about this is go 2 college & get financial aid 2 gain training 4 a new career. don't c this joblessness as a negative thing, but an opportunity 4 a personal improvement in yer own life. u CAN make something of yer life. u CAN turn it around 4 the better.      i'm in college w/ financial aid which is the ONLY way i'll EVER have a good start. u can sit down & make a list of ALL yer interests & what yer good @. this'll help college advisors/recruiters place u in the right major. they're there 2 help u. my college helped me start on the right road 2 an astronaut career. i've only just begun, & i'm gonna finish (among the stars)    Best Wishes!!!|`|WFP46Ek9aa	email me or call me if you want to  rustygirl_90210@yahoo.com  please dont kill yourself  my exboyfriend almost did it made me cry|`|ca0db37cc242f17eb06d3e3e4612fb74aa	Hey, man, suicide isn't really the answer.  And besides, downing an entire bottle of Advil isn't a fun way to go (had friends who tried it and they had a horrible time).    Life's too short to end it prematurely because you're not happy.  You CAN get a job, just keep trying.  It WILL pay off.

I dont think you're a loser... buck up... and keep moving forward!|`|QKU2vYoEaa	I wouldn't advise taking the advil, you don't wanna die, trust me. If you're on here asking for help, then it means you clearly want to live, or you'd have taken them by now.    It's really hard to find a job now and parents can be really pushy about it. Just keep trying and eventually you'll get hired. I know it's discouraging.    Don't worry about girls, if you're depressed right now then girls and/or a relationship can make things more complicated. Right now just focus on yourself and being content with and by yourself.    Good luck, don't do anything you know you might regret. Get to a doctor, get some help.

You say you are a bit over weight? Then go exercise, simple walking and jogging 30 min a day will help you with that. Try eating a little better as well, cut out some snack foods.     This is a tough time to get a job but keep looking im sure you will find one. If not you have more time to concentrate on your school work.     And for women and friends, try being more active in hobbies you enjoy. Its a good place to meet both no matter what the hobby. Its better to have 1 good friend then 20 "fake bitches" as you say.    Dont worry you are only 19 with your whole life ahead of you. You will never know what great things the future holds.|`|E4HsFpAzaa	please don't do anything crazy...  what you really need is to look on the bright side of life....  you have to fight for your life and not to quit!you have to be strong and you have to prove to yourself that you are not weak...  everything happens for a reason...it is ok if you have not already found it...  bend dont break...  anything can happen...  challenge yourself...dare to keep perspective...face your choices...  just dig a little dipper..nothing comes easy...visualize success....|`|4JuzDVrjaa	suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. situations change all the time, how sad would it be if you never got to see the woman you might marry or the children you might have...if i were in your situation i wouldn't give up. don't be a quitter, life is hard but the happiest people are the people who fight through it and focus on all the positive things in life. here's an exercise for you to try:  every day write down something your happy about, it can be anything, and try to keep your head up. don't give up. and remember God is real and he loves all of his children, just wants to be treated like a dad. hope i could help you.|`|Dzr2ZcdZaa	people look to suicide to solve their problems but it won't. it will cause more. think about the people surrounding you that love you so much but maybe you don't notice. please don't hurt the people who love you, because you might hurt them soo much they wouldnt be able to forgive themselves, just think of someone close to you being suicidal, how much would that hurt you?  the economy is bad right now. most of the people in the u.s. are having horrible money problems and losing jobs. your young and have so much life ahead of you. your still young so you just havent found the right person yet. im 26 and i didnt have my first boyfriend untill i was 19. it didnt last long but my next boyfriend was at 24, which im now engaged to. so focus on school and remember a setback is always an oppurtunity for a comeback.     anyone can give up but its up to you to pull through.|`|TzCN2zt3aa	First and foremost parents are hard when it comes to being over 18 and living at home with no job just keep letting them know you are looking and that's all you can do at the moment.     If you are having Suicidal thoughts you should talk to someone they have free hotlines I believe for this.     Secondly... There is alot of people looking for love no matter what size shape or color. To want to kill yourself over not having a girlfriend isn't the way to go. You need to realize that some girls and people are just plain rude. It's their lose not yours!!! You seem to be a great guy and I'm sure someone out there will be very sad not to have the opportunity to meet you. I know it's hard and it will be hard to find that special someone. But they are out there. So it's not your appearance it's them. Like you said the people you thought were your friends aren't I've had that alot lately but you will find someone and find new friends when you get out of a college and have a job. Meeting new ppl is always fun!     So put down the Advil and take a hot bath and a nap. Everything will be fine and will come into place soon. Just wait it out. Not everyone is having a perfect life out there. Some people find there soul mates off the bat some people have to go through loads of duds before finding that one. Some people are still looking it happens everyone so you aren't alone!|`|AA12321034	1. Killing your self would be EXTREMELY selfish!!!

I advise (not that i good at advising, but still) to give people a chance to know you better, and also press hard on studying - later it'll incease your chances of getting a nice well-paying job :) and that means a nice girlfriend 2 :))|`|tGik2gx1aa	even if you are so ugly which i find hard to beleive lookes arnt everything..i know that sounds like something a counselor or an agony aunt would say but i promise its true. and anyway you seem to think that all women are picky and shallow and were not..  please dont take the pills..please please..you dont need money because there are helplines that you can call an if you are desperate you can find free counsilers..  and even without girlfriends or a job you can appreciate the blue of the sky and how green the grass is..  life is beautiful no matter how **** you feel. everything is going to be ok..|`|6rvzeOsqaa	if you are really having suicidal thoughts, you need to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room NOW.    if you are simply feeling down at this moment, take a deep breath, hold it for a second, then release.  keep doing this until you calm down a bit.  try to release your feelings - everytime you breathe out, you are letting go of a bad feeling.    once you have calmed down - try to look at the larger picture -     you are only 19 years old.  when i was 19 i had only had one girlfriend also, and she dumped me.  but now i'm 29 and i've had lots of girlfriends - and i'm fat too!  my point is, things seem bad right now, but there is plenty of time for things to get better.    i think you should exercise - not just to lose weight - but because exercise is very good for depression.  right now go for a long walk outside.  try not to think about anything accept the sky, the birds, etc.  just walk.  you are 19, and things and your life is just beginning.    p.s.  don't take the ADVIL, it will just make you really really sick.|`|p5H70NEeaa	Don't do it man, your waaaay to young.  You don't have to have a girlfriend brother, Im 22 and have never had one.  Its not a big deal, if you rush that kinda **** your gonna wind up with some ***** just because you want to get laid.  Wait it out and you will find someone nice who respects you and cares about you.  Not all your problems will be answered in a day man, it takes a long time.  I went through a lot of **** when I was your age as well, believe me it gets better.  First, you need to get yourself motivated.  If your worried about being over weight, don't.  Go for walks, change your diet, start exercising.  You will eventually feel better, you don't have to look like a greek god to get a girl, you just need to be confident and funny.   The more you think poorly of yourself the more girls will be able to read that.  But this all takes TIME, I know it sucks man, but it does.  You just have to persevere.  Keep looking for a job, you don't have to be making much.    Deliver pizzas, anything.  I'm 22 living with my parents, no girlfriend, no job, and going to school.  Yeah it sucks cuz all my friends are out on their own, but its just not me.  Its no reason to get down.  Just focus on eating right, finding a job, and finding some nice friends.  Do not kill yourself, your situation is not that dire.  Give it time and you will be fine.  You must focus, work hard, and take your TIME... if you can force yourself to do this, everything will be ok in the end.  Life is long, but it is what you make it.  You can't sit around and think about the easy way out.  "There are no shortcuts to anywhere worth going", even death my friend.  Go talk to people, don't worry about making a girl your girlfriend or your friend.  Just talk, keep the conversation going, make people laugh, it will make you feel better.  And go do something for somebody else, helping people who are worse off than you will help make you feel better.  Volunteer at a hospital or something, get a foot in the door and if you work hard they will probably hire your.  Just trust me, there are much better options than killing yourself.|`|BcbQtdvFaa	Well, i've struggled with appearance issues and self esteem a lot. I know what it's like to feel like ****. I've had suicidal thoughts before. All I can say is just think things through. There's a lot of people like you out there and I'm sure the right girl will come along someday. I've never even had a boyfriend. I just hope somehow I can help you, but I don't really know how. Is there anyone you can talk too? There's always suicide hot-lines and stuff that I've tried before. Try to think about the good qualities of yourself, because I'm sure you have some. I hope you feel better. :]|`|mVM44fKgaa	Try to get a job at your college, maybe helping other people, that will help you to feel better about yourself too. I found that helping other people always helps me to feel better when I'm feeling down. Think about your family! They will certainly not be better off without you. And at least you have had a girlfriend! I know it seems like other people are so much better off that you, but that's not the truth. Everyone has their own thing going on, and you never know what problems they REALLY have.     P.S. appearance isn't everything. I am a good looking girl, and i have gone out with guys that aren't all that good looking because i liked them for their personality. A sense of humor helps a lot! And as soon as you put yourself out there to be rejected, the sooner you will get tho the girl who will say maybe, or even yes!    You have value to the world. You have to make it happen, once you accomplish something (which i'm sure you already have) you yourself will feel more valued.    Don't think you need someone else to make you feel whole. Fix yourself, value yourself, then if a girl is good enough for you, give it a shot, if not PEACE!|`|AA10294581	I kno exactly what you mean, ive have many suicidal thoughts even like this past week cz my friend jus left on saturday well like he came to visit for the superbowl and then now hes still in town but hes visiting with his ******* ex an me an him know we're perfect for each other but yet he stills goes and gets drunk with her.

0s93q8Ocaa	You KNOW the answer.  Can you accept living with a gay man?  Does he want to leave to pursue his life interest?|`|21Wk2mu5aa	Maybe he is using drugs again?   Sounds like he is probably just gay, though.     Unless you don't mind sharing him sexually with other men, it is time for you to move on.     You will probably never be safe having unprotected sex with your husband, either.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Gay things? What does that mean? He sucked somebody off? Or, took/gave it up the ***? What he was doing, can clue you in to why he's doing it. I don't know what drugs he took but whatever it/they was/were, it/they allowed him to lower his inhibitions to do things that he normally may not have done. That doesn't mean he didn't have it in him to do but that being high made it easier to come out. In other words, if he sucked somebody off and is doing it again, it's most likely that he's gay. If he let somebody stick him in his ***, that may have been because of drugs. The difference is in the satisfaction he got from it. For instance, somebody would pay him to suck them off. But, unless he was an on the corner prostitute, no one is going to pay him to let them poke him in his ***. That's more for his enjoyment rather than a means to an end.     He's probably bi but is unsure of your reaction if he admits it. Either that, or he's on drugs again.    Edit: I know plenty of gay/bi men. Just because a man has sex with another man, that doesn't guarantee he'll get a STD. Gay men are concerned with their health too so not all of them engage in risky behavior- meaning, unprotected behavior. If you decide that you don't want to be with a gay man, cool. But, don't judge him as if by remaining with him will open you up to a STD. One of the reasons guys remain in the closet is because of public perception. The best thing for you is to ensure that your man is being upfront and honest. If he's concerned about his health as a hetrosexual than he will be as a homosexual. It's his drug use that should cause you concern rather than his sexual preference. Homos don't steal or beat you to death because they're gay. Drug addicts steal and will beat you up if you don't give them money because they're on drugs so that presents the most danger.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	If he wants to do gay things he's most likely gay.|`|faT4MyVkaa	Gay.|`|8txWayVnaa	All I can says is "WOW!"    He's been in the closet all along, and the drugs were an excuse to come out for brief periods of time.  Pretty dark in that there closet, huh?  Is he finally stepping into the light?  Probably.    Good luck to you sweetie.  You're going to need it.|`|S7iQ9FkGaa	Your husband is gay. I know this sounds harsh, but you need to face reality. What you're experiencing is denial in its simplest form, which is OK. But it's even better when you accept the facts. Remember; HIV IS NO JOKE, USE CONDOMS!!!    Good luck to you!|`|GzL8X6vTaa	I think that is just an excuse that he used to justify his gayness.    He probably is gay and doesn't know how to admit it or come out.|`|VmQBhY6iaa	Maybe he's bi. Hey that happens in womans? why no in mens too?  hahahaha.....|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Buy him a battery operated ********* .. if he squeals when he opens the package ... Mystery Solved !|`|6wxgyGy5aa	He's probably bisexual.  You'll have to decide if you can handle his attraction to men|`|0qAmRjfOaa	He's Gay. If you decide to stay with him, make sure you use condoms. Men are not homosexual based on the circumstances. There are plenty of drug addicts that aren't gay. He made a choice and is hiding behind using drugs as an excuse to legitimize his behavior.|`|AA11826328	I am so sorry for you because I will not beat around the bush with you like you are trying to tell yourself, your husband is gay period any time a person have sex with the same sex then they are gay, even if they are having straight sex at times they are still gay your husband most likely was trying to find himself maybe he was confused while on drugs I am not for sure I do not know you all but, the humane heart goes like this...we are told growing up that we are suppose to grow up get married have children buy a home and a dog and live happily ever after but, that is not what everyone really want in their hearts, so they are confused and afraid and this is what happens, a man gets married have children and hurts a really beautiful hearted person.  I am sorry and I do not mean to sound mean or anything but, if I were you I would walk away now before things get really out of hand with your husband, because now days they it "On the down low"  I hope the best for you really I do and I hope things do get better for you....Good Luck....Lil Angel|`|oOR511mFaa	LOL no straight man would do anything gay no matter how intoxicated he was. You husband is gay. I would find a straight man.|`|is68T2vqaa	may be he is trying to convince you for such kind of relationship indirectly!|`|gdWXzQW6aa	HES GAY|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	just an excuse.        he's gay.      I don't know anybody who is on the fence about their sexual identity.  However living in denial about one's sexuality, well that happens all the time.|`|YVO3WyU1aa	You answered your own question.  Now what are you going to do about it?|`|102010aac688a75a496158bb50ff7535aa	So Gay|`|1UJLsTogaa	If it quacks like a duck......|`|TebPFTrJaa	He's GAY drugs was just a cover up|`|JDhptHC7aa	If he's done stuff and wants to do more he sounds gay or at least bi.    If it's just talk he's probably just curious.|`|WPd4MYt6aa	Yep, he's pretty much a fag.|`|Ek4pRjQraa	hes gay..
5r2Csdzwaa	So that DOLT of a husband is a Butthole Surfer huh? Well you can pick them that's for sure.    I suggest you leave him and let him move to San Francisco.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Yes. I had no problem with it and was always turned on by it. There was never a time when protection wasn't used, so that gave me comfort and then because he was honest about everything from the door, we had no problems with secrets or him leading a double life. Once we got together, he didn't go exploring. We always did things in 3some fashion because he's not at all attracted to men, just freaky situations.    I've never seen your other questions so I don't know if there was a problem to make this have come out. I can tell you that as long as your husband is honest about everything, it is possible for you guys to work thru this.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Being gay or bisexual is not a free pass to go have sex with other people.  These are things that are to be explored before you make a lifelong commitment to your spouse, unless your spouse is willing to share you with others.  Apparently, there are many people out there that are okay with this.      I have read you last question, and I think that you have a long way to go in your relationship with your husband before you get to this point.  He needs to first figure out what he is.  Then, you two need to discuss staying together or not.  THEN you need to discuss whether you are going to have an open marriage or not.  I wouldn't talk about an open marriage over dinner tongiht, I'd more likely discuss the gay part.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I was. I didn't. So he cheated.|`|lY1uPhmMaa	well thats just nasty if u have any dignity at all leave the scene|`|vKvNDPbDaa	it's obvious that you love your husband for even entertaining the thought of letting him do this.  this is a recipe for heartache and disaster.  prepare yourself emotionally for your marriage to end you deserve someone who is appreciates you entirely for the loving woman you are.  let him go.
nOmX8XGUaa	this happened to me and now my old best friend is just like another person to me. she probally  wants to move on.|`|VALxlwYSaa	YOU COULD ALWAYS SHOOT HER IN THE FACE.     Ok no,   Try talking to her again. In rl maybe? Seems to work better.   Though if it doesn't work just make it look like you don't care. [:     (I'M NOT USING CAPS I'M SHOUTING :D)|`|hitKzYhBaa	Are you sure your friend is okay? My mom told me  long time  ago she had a friend who did the same thing. However, that   friend was ill and in the hospital for a long time? If the friend is  okay then you might want to check if there is something going  on or being said behind your back. If this were a GOOD FRIEND,  excuse me, not shouting either, then she should let you know  what is wrong. You might want to question if this is the type  FRIENDS you really need.
IXskJPlVaa	You have been married for 10 years and now for the past 3 the marriage is falling apart. This is pretty bad. The other guy might be an attractive option but equally risky. Instead try professional counselling both for your husband and you - it might save the relationship. Also take help of friends and relatives - in whom you can confide. How's the sex life - if dull or none - revive - sex helps relieve a lot of tensions. Instead of taking any harsh decision first make all efforts to save and improve the present relationship.Best of luck.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You should leave because you and your son are being abused, not because you found someone new to have sex with. You're supposed to be protecting that boy and you're allowing him to be abused because you don't want to be alone. Get out of the marriage, go to a Women's Center for some counseling to find out why you thought the abuse was ok (so you don't keep making the same mistake) and THEN find another man.    EDIT: It is not a lack of communication that causes abuse, as this poster above says. Men are abusive because of flaws in their psyche, not because you don't talk to them properly. You can't fix an abuser, he has to fix himself. My god, it's irresponsible to post stuff like that.|`|nBQeSu2faa	You mentioned your husband is verbally abusive to you and your young son, you don't want to leave because of your son. If you can talk to him , then you need to point out where, when and how he is being abusive..if he is not willing to address the problem..then I would say..leave him and don't waste anymore years on this unhealthy relationship..also he is not a very good role model for your son...But the most important thing of all is.. DON'T leave your husband to go into the arms of another man..that would be a BIG MISTAKE..if you leave him ,take time out to get to know yourself..spend healthy time with your son, find out , what a strong woman you are, learn to stand on your own two feet..this should take a year or so ..then when you really know who and what you are ..then consider another relationship.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	they guy from the gym would make a good f-buddy but he's not the answer to your abusive husband.  If you've been with him for 10 years you could divorce and likely get alimony out of it.  Think it through before you take any action.  You should speak to a lawyer right away about the abuse thats the first step.|`|xlyk63xRaa	only opition is to communicate, that word can be the biggest home wrecker , without communication you cant exist in a marriage, its lack of communication that causes all the bad things to happen . eg. bedroom department problems . adultery , abusiveness.  you have to put your foot down stop rolling over and start to stamp your own authority, if he has a problem with that then he is hanging himself with his own tie. he will be digging the hole deeper and deeper for himself , in a reverse psychology type way , make sure you communicate more and pin point every single problem, atleast give him a chance to change after addressing every problem, you want to see changes, you aint asking...you want the changes.    you will get anything you want through communication.    dont listen to idiots saying....just think about number one and get out whilst you can blah blah . i got thumbed down for the most responcible answer your going to get.|`|8txWayVnaa	If you are going to leave, do it for YOU--not some guy.    Like you said--life is too short and children are very resilient.    Good luck to you.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	Two wrongs obviously don't make a right.  If you choose to leave you need to focus on raising that poor innocent rather than your own happiness, period.  By the way, the grass is rarely greener.|`|0qAmRjfOaa	Wow. If not for yourself than for your kids, you should want better. You are raising people who might someday think it's ok to mimic similar behavior possibly toward you or their mate. Set a good example.|`|xHxi9p0Vaa	Leave. But don't leave him for Gym guy, do it for you and your son. If you do it for the right reason, you will never feel guilty or stupid. Don't worry about being alone. There may be times when you are technically alone, but trust me, it is a million times better than being where you are now. If you do decide to leave, make sure you have a good solid plan for your exit before you act. I was in your shoes. If you would like to discuss anything with me - ever... just email me.|`|ylDHOIp1aa	alright as for u you need a new man in your life and need to keep your son safe the problem is do you want your son to be like his dad because he will if he thinks that how men are sapost to treat weman so i wood save your self and start a new life it is not as hard as you think be strong for you kid

You were best friends for years.  You went to school together.  You hang out a lot.  Then you flew away to spend "some time" (4 or 5 months?)" with your love.  I know you called her, but what did you say in your short phone calls?  Did you ask about her?  Did you say things like "I cant wait to see you again?"  Or, "I miss you so much!"  Did you make her feel you were calling her  and only her, or, were the phone calls all about you and this "love" of yours?  If the calls were all about you and this other girl, that might have been news she really didnt want to hear because she was carrying a well-hidden secret of love for you she was afraid to ever tell you about because she was afraid it would ruin a wonderful friendship she cherished with all her heart!  Unrequited love is such a difficult thing to deal with.  She probably felt "dumped."  There are extremes here on both sides, but I feel with all my heart she cares far more for you than just a good friend and she doesnt know what to do about it, so out of her love for you and your feelings for this other girl, she is trying to cut you loose so you can be free to pursue your happiness and she can also protect what is left of her heart because she doesnt have to hear your voice, feel your touch, think about what might have been.  This probably makes no sense to you or anyone else, but when I read your question, I was compelled to answer it because I had the same thing happen to me.  I will give you the same advice that was given to me years ago.  Go to her and talk to her.  Pour your heart out to her if your friendship really means that much to you and if it is really worth keeping.  I wont take up anymore of your time, but I took the advice that was given to me and the ending turned out to be a very happy one.  Good luck and much happiness in your decision.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	You have done absolutely nothing wrong she is feeling herself right now.  With all the "attention" that she is getting she doesnt know how to act and is stepping on you in addition to disrespecting you.  Let her be when she falls she will fall hard, and maybe even get a wake up call or learn some type of lesson    oops then again maybe you ignored her or did something to her, who knows its seems like someone is immature|`|Af8LQHR1aa	find new friends that actually care about you.  obviously she doesn't see what she is missing out on.  people change, and sometimes it is unfortunately for the worst.

You ain't gonna like it though. BECAUSE YOU LET HIM DO IT. Simple as that.    He KNOWS you aren't going anywhere, so he does whatever he wants. I can't believe you would want to raise children in an atmosphere where you are miserable. You don't think they don't "feel" it or "pick up" on it? They do and they will. Have some self respect.    I told ya you wouldn't like it. Truth sucks somethings.    Good luck and develop "thick" skin, you're gonna need it.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Tell him to take up fishing to relax!!!    He's cheating and I'd go a step further and say is addicted to interent pornography.  Trust me the dating sites are just a cover for what he's really doing on line.  You want to test how serious this is?  Take the computer out of the house!  While he's at work have the internet disconnected and move the computer out of the house.  If he has a meltdown than there is your answer.    Under no circumstances should a married man be trolling internet dating sites to relax.    Thumbs me down people I don't care the truth hurts.  If you truly have an active and healthy sex life he wouldn't be on the internet trolling for women.  I hate to say this so bluntly but your husband sounds like a sex addict.  That means you could give it to him 24/7 and it wouldn't be enough.  He needs help.    If he's serious about stopping this addiction (which he can't do on his own) than password protect the computer.  If he can't get on it he can't cheat on it.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	He is talking about a very intimate subject with women other than his wife. Yes, honey, it's cheating.|`|ZSznCJhSaa	He needs to understand that he should find a different way to relax. I know people say that it is a fantasy world, but thats not always true.    I left my first boyfriend for a guy that I met online. I didn't cheat and I broke up with my bf as soon as I developed feelings for the other guy, but I still feel badly about it.     Maybe you should try hard to excite him sexually. When he comes home one day, be wearing a sexy outfit or have the room decorated. Make sure that he has reason to focus on you.     If you get too emotional when talking to him, he may not listen to what you have to say and write it off. I would suggest writing a letter and having somone proof read it to make sure it is level headed. Just explain in a clear and concise way how it makes you feel.   Ask him if he would honestly be okay with you going to a bar and flirting it up with guys and talking dirty with them about having sex.     Explain to him that its the same situation, you wouldn't have sex with the guys in the bar just like he isn't going to actually have sex with these people online but that it still hurts your feelings.    Basically. Flat out tell him that this is in no way okay for YOU. Maybe other couples can handle it. But if its bothering you, thats all that should matter.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	My hubby talks a little dirty with some of his female friends (I Know nothing would ever happen)..it's difficult but I trust him.   If you know he wouldn't do anything, trust him.  If you can't trust him, what's the point of being married?|`|JuqxbJ3Daa	You must be a good wife. I wouldn't put up with that no more than pat stayed in Hell. That's very disrespectful to you. It sounds like your husband has an addition.

So you will just have to put up with it, won't you?    Ah, put like that, perhaps divorce IS an option, unless you are happy for him to carry on.|`|jCMSybAnaa	It's emotional cheating indeed.  Don't put a name on it to make you feel better or worse about it though.  How you feel is real to you, and if you want him to stop, continue to help him understand how it makes you feel and pray about it.  My husband was once addicted to porn, and he is doing fairly good now.  God has blessed.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Dating sites are very different from viewing porn photos/videos.  A porn star is never going to enter your real life...a "dating" person could very well show up at your door.      If you are not prepared to follow through on putting your foot down - he'll never change his habits.  He obviously can't keep his word to you - it's up to you as to whether or not you wish to continue to live like that.  Self-respect...get some.    Dating websites are not acceptable for a married man to be trolling...maybe you can cut off the sex until he can cut off the dating website trolling.  If you can't get him to see you're serious - next step - marriage counseling.|`|b8TgKnBwaa	Think of it as interavtive internet porn. The most he can actually do, without physically meeting with another person, is jerk off on webcam while some other whore is doing the same thing. Do you talk dirty to him? do you do EVERYTHING he wants to do behind closed doors? i mean, he's obviously not getting what he wants/needs from you.|`|cq11zfBWaa	Be honest with him about how this is affecting you emotionally.  Short of forcing him to attend counseling sessions, divorce or stalking him online; there's not a whole lot you can do.     As I said, the best advice is to be very clear about how it's affecting you.  In his defense, i'm sure it's harmless, but I wouldn't want to be in your position though.    tl;dr I'm sure he's a nice guy, but he sounds like a douchebag.|`|1cmPcgcoaa	He's not respecting you at all. Why is divorce not an option? Is smashing the computer an option?  Emotional cheating (and that IS what he's doing) is a total deal breaker.|`|eCSK4ouSaa	It seems to me that if he was engaging in the behavior prior to you getting married he is going to continue.  I have found that out in my 5 years of marriage.  You have to decide if you are willing to accept his behavior and if you are...move forward.  Since you say divorce is not an option, it seems as if you are accepting the behavior.  I hope that this all works out for you...God Bless You.|`|HtvLM4vdaa	He has a problem.  It's a sexual addiction.  You two need to talk about it and see if he wants to seek help to overcome that problem.
AA10975867	Bridal showers? Huge guest list? Who is this ? Ivana "Totally ridiculous and pathetic" Trump? It is wonderful for an older divorced or widowed woman to find a second love but it is really pathetic for any woman to put planning her wedding ahead of the wedding for her son! I can't even imagine it! But- here's the deal. You had your wedding. You are happy. You are in love. You got what you wanted and it was perfect. This crazy lady will be talked about, gossiped about for years. When people act shocked at her choices, just roll your eyes and say "Well, that's Marj, isn't it? Can't change her - can't shoot her!" and change the subject. You will come off as the lady and she will continue to be known as the nutbar. Don't get upset. If she was doing this last October, before your own dream wedding, you might have reason to be hurt. Take it as a compliment that she thinks you know everything, can do everything in the best way, and have great taste and leave it at that. ASk your parents to suck it up and attend the wedding. When people say "Hey, this is a great venue", they can sweetly say "Yes, our daughter found it" ,etc. and then they can also feel good about throwing the best wedding reception EVER! - so good that people want to copy it. Please don't say anything. It is just not worth it. Concentrate on your marriage and your love and your happiness. Nothing else matters.|`|ofCRTXw9aa	Get your husband to talk to her about it.

She can try to copy your day, but everyone there will know it was yours first.|`|c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	i'm not sure why she would do that, but my question is which wedding is first?  if the family is at yours and then she copies you, it will be obvious and embarrassing for her.  if you are really concerned, either talk to her about it OR make some changes and don't tell her about it.  dont' talk to her about any more plans you make and do something to make yours unique.|`|DDSEGWFDaa	It's great that your wedding worked out so well but now, after a few months, you should be realizing that the wedding was just about one day and your marriage is what's really important now.  You aren't a bride anymore, you're a newlywed.  Let go of the bridal stuff, throw out the Bride magazines, move on to this new exciting time of your life.    Your mother in law can plan any kind of wedding she wants.  That doesn't reflect on YOU, it reflects on HER.  So sit back with a pleasant smile on your face and let her be silly.  Your role as wife (as opposed to bride) is to respect your husband's family and treat them well.  So, be a charming bridesmaid, throw a small but very nice shower, rise above it all, and support your husband because this probably isn't easy for him.    Your parents shouldn't be bad mouthing your mother in law to you and you shouldn't be feeding into that.  If they want to come they should, if they don't care to come they should send regrets.  But don't run home to your parents with your marital dirty laundry.  That's a bad habit to get started on.|`|InZU5aaxaa	From what I have seen she looks up to you and is trying to mimic you to get the same pleasure out of her day that you got out of yours.     On second thought I would go through with the wedding and not say anything to any one about it. The best way I can describe it is they will be like "Haven't we seen this before?". If you ever watch Bring it On the original it sounds like you will have a repeat. One cheer group does a performance and the next group does the same one. There is no response from the audience because they saw the same routine back to back. Same with the wedding. People will not be astonished with her wedding. Also they will remember yours that whole day because you set the standard, so to speak.    Talk with your new husband because he should be able to talk to his mom and explain a few key issues with her. Maybe she could change the readings, the colors, the music, key things to make it her own. Be there to help guide her away from your wedding and making hers memorable in her own way.|`|3wWGjj4naa	tell her what you just told us...tell her that u love her and u support her in her new marraige but tell her that yall want your wedding to be yalls and that u workd hard to make it yours and offer to help her find other selections for her wedding.... and a few aspect of ur wedding in hers should be fine...but the song is over the top.... that is yalls song she needs to find other ideas.... dont be mean just calmly explain your feelings to her im sure she will understand...  good luck !|`|7VzbVzBnaa	I think it's time for a wake up call.  Calling her names like "selfish and childish" and getting so worked up isn't going to help, or stop, anything.      It's wonderful that you had the wedding of your dreams and yes, it sucks that she's copying you, but why is it hurting you so deeply and making you so ill?  Take a step back and shake it off.  Stop letting it get to you!  If the whole thing is a fiasco, let the blame fall squarely where it's deserved, on her shoulders.  After all, as many of the people on her site say over and over, it's IS ~her~ wedding.      Wash your hands of it.  No more name calling.  No more getting "so upset" about it.      Don't get me wrong, our friends copied our wedding as well, and did it poorly.  It upset me and I felt like I was stolen from, but now it's a funny story to laugh at and completely describes them - unoriginal and wanting to be like us.      Remember, her copying you doesn't change YOUR wedding day or discount it in any way.|`|76nTvO4iaa	This woman (a widow old enough to be your mother) is copying YOUR wedding.     It's not your place to say anything to her.  It is the responsibility of her son to pull her back in line.  He doesn't have the balls to say anything, so the wedding will go as (you) planned.   She will look like a fool by copying her son & DIL's wedding.    I know this sounds mean but don't say another word about this matter.  Believe me, her wedding is going to be talked about for quite some time after it occurs, but not in the way she hopes.  This isn't flattery - it's an attempt at competition and she's going to come up short.    Bring your hurt feelings & come here to vent.  ((hugs to Mia Bella))|`|kUE3Ddktaa	There's a saying about imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. I know it bothers you, but take it as a compliment - she thought your wedding was beautiful.    Her copying doesn't take anything away from your wedding day, and since there's really nothing you can do about it, there's no point in wasting any more of your time and energy worrying about it.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Talk to her about it.    There will be elements of her wedding that will be different from yours.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Your pathetic mom-in-law (I wouldn't call her that - it be worse) is a piece of work........meaning.........is using all of your IDEAS.  I would be way beyond upset.  What's wrong with your hubby?  Can't he speak up to his own MOM?  or he's a Momma's boy?    She's getting married for the 2nd time and wants again a full affair...........meaning, church hall, etc.  It's tacky!     She's jealous of you and your wedding so she decide to duplicate yours.    I would be tolerant of her but nothing else.    If you never speak up to your hubby, he, too, will walk all over you.    Mom-in-law's..........who says you have to like them.........you married her son NOT HER - THE WITCH!
5IkZ64aFaa	What an honor to be chosen to write these very important things.  Your family must think very highly of you.  I can't tell you what to say, but just be honest and tell them how they helped your grandfather.  Also tell them how they helped your family get through this time.  Add specific things the staff did to help.  For example, maybe one of the nurses always remembered what type of food your grandfather liked.  Just make it as specific as you can and speak from the heart....It will come out great.  Good luck!!  Counselor KB|`|3KyVMVncaa	Well, I think what you wrote when you asked your question was good. Just write something like.... Thank you for all of your support and kindness through out my Papa's stay at your hospital. The doctors, nurses and staff were of such help to me and my family. All of your efforts to prolong his life are more appreciated then you will ever know.....  I hope that gets the ball rolling for you sweetie. I am so sorry for your loss. Maybe try Google for thank you letters or obituary's?    Good Luck and God bless|`|aMQD2UnWaa	Stop for a second and think about how they made you feel.  Think from your heart.  Did you feel like they really cared about your grandpa? Did they treat him with respect?  Tell them what he meant to you and what their efforts meant to you and your family.  Those nurses and doctors are there to help people. They want to be there and by receiving this thank you letter from you will make their hearts smile.  It is very rare that people like that are actually thanked.  Bless you and I am really sorry for your loss.
AA10065812	I assume he has no court ordered custody or visitation rights?  He needs to get an attorney and file for them.    Im a Fathers Rights Advocate for 20 years.       Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.    Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.      Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  Youre that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,    Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.    If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  The organization it came from is defunct due to attorneys that tried to take it over and make money from it.    Take the time to learn what you can and should do.    http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...  http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice  http://www.rcfp.org/taping/  http://www.glennsacks.com  http://www.parentalalienation.org/|`|kMp5p3r7aa	thats a coward move. unless the father wants NOTHING AT ALL to do with the child.. then whatever  but if the father is paying child support, isn't a bum and wants to see the child.. then if the mother does that, thats horrible  and the mother is definately not thinking about the best interest of the child. a child needs a mother and a father|`|mVM44fKgaa	unless she doesnt want child support anymore, i would think not.|`|iKD1JUg1aa	if he has visitation right with the kids then she can move and change her number but he would have to know where she was moving to and how to get a hold of her.....now if he doesnt have that right then yea she does have the right to move and change her number without him having to know.....|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Now she can change her number if needbe but moving may be another thing. You dont say the move is local or out of state. An out of state and even some local moves (different counties) require her to get either Dads and/or the courts permission to move. To get the courts permission and over ride Dads objections, she would have to show the courts that it was for the good of the child and show she has residency set up and financial support to move forand a plan to satisfy Dads visitation rights. Not so easily done, but is legally required or she could face Federal spousal kidnapping charges which would be good for Dad. Hope this helps out. Good luck|`|3KyVMVncaa	No way! I think thats illegal. Call your local Social Services and report it. Thants not fair if he is paying and she is basically disapearing with the kid and his money.
fa335ee825ad135a15dc4479fdfadcf4aa	OMG the same thing happen to me when i was 22 but the thing is that it wasn't a relative, this old cleaning lady saw me and said "oh finish" don't mind me it was so weird. oh going back to the relative thing i mean you r going to be careful not to do anything else to make it worse and she probably already told your uncle. so i guess your uncle would come up to you and talk about it.|`|mVM44fKgaa	don't worry about it too much.. you can do many things    1. talk to her about it  - either say it was a one time thing, or you are stressed out or something   2. pretend nothing happened    (personally i would pick number 2, cause chances are that she won't want to bring it up either.)|`|IQjnK4ghaa	HAHA

Its okay, and if she is logical, she'll see it as a good thing. It means you're a healthy growing boy with normal desires.

3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	i hate watching or listing to people arguee of such little things!   my cuz got mad because i didn't put her in my wedding!   She and he will have to get over it!   it's your wedding and you need to have who YOU want in it!   if she gets mad just say  so you only asked me because you wanted to be in mine? crap i thought i ment something to you!  i guess i don't.. so we are even know!    as for the peeps who say family over friends i only agree with sisters and brothers not cousins!   cousines are like friends!  my cousin wouldn't be in my wedding she likes drama i don't!  sorry you will not still my attention on my day!   get over it! AND!!!  my friends been there for me more than my family!  so why should i let them have their prize winning spot light!     and who ever says friends come and go!  don't know how to be a true friend!  my friends or my true friends i have been with for over 30 years!|`|itbkP9HGaa	Its fine, you don't have to return the favor simply because you were MOH in her wedding.  You should choose who you want, and if she's mad, then she should keep those ungracious feelings to herself.|`|55zWUXcUaa	Of course it's OK, you should pick who you are closest to.  It's not a right to be your MOH and Bestman just because you were hers that doesn't really seem fair to me.    EDIT:  To Karen give me one good reason why family should always come first?  My fiance's family stinks.  He has been living with my family for 5 years because his mom kicked him out when he was 19 because he requested some money he had loaned her so he could afford school books.  His brother (who WAS the bestman) wanted the entire wedding his way because he is fighting with his father and was insisting his dad couldn't come anywhere near him and refused to even be at any of the parties if his father came.  When my fiance said that wouldn't work and he had a choice to be there for him or he can resign as the best man.  His brother resigned and told his mom and the rest of her family that my fiance kicked him out of the wedding party.  Now my fiance's mom and her entire side of the family aren't coming.  My point is family is not always there for you they aren't always reliable just because they are blood it makes no guaranty that they will act like family should.  So why should family be chosen just because you share a bloodline?|`|xDFaFeN9aa	I think you made a decision that was right for you and your fiance-and that is all that you can do. Sometimes friends ARE family and it's your choice on who you want supporting you on your special day.|`|SDxI3YgXaa	OF COURSE ITS OK!!!!! ITS YOUR DAY!!!!!!!! they shouldn't mind that you chose somebody else... i guess now they feel like there not as close to you guys as they thought they were.... so maybe you should talk to them... or you could just not you ur fiances best mans wife and just choose me to be ur maid of honor :P  hope i helped   CONGRATS ON THE BIG DAY!!!!   I HOPE YOU HAVE THE TIME OF YOUR UR LIFE!!!!  BEING MARRIED IS FUN!!!!(even though i have never been married... gosh im only 22)|`|EufY9W3laa	I had the same problem. So to alleviate it all, we just stuck with family. That way we didn't have to choose. Whenever anyone asks, we tell them that we wanted just family standing up with us. We are honoring our close friends at the reception though. Kinda like honorary bridesmaids and groomsmen. They will have a reserved table as well. Hope that helps and congrats on the wedding.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	hey you have to pick who you're closest to and the girl you think will have your back and help you while you plan your wedding.  no flakes in the wedding party, that's what I say.  as long as your'e going to have your cuz and her hubby in the wedding party she should be happy and if she's sad she's not MOH hopefully she keeps it to herself.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Yes... You need to have who YOU want...  Just tell your cousin your true feelings... She should still be grateful to be in your wedding....    I am having 2 of my best friends my 2 sisters and 1 future sister in law.... My brother's gf I did not ask to be part of my bridal party... I like her, but I don't want her up there... I know she mentioned that I would be in hers, but I just shrugged it off.  She doesn't seem to be upset with not being in mine either....    It's your choice...  No one can expect you to have everyone in the bridal party...|`|dPULl5hjaa	It's nasty on your part..........so you choose the best friend & wife OVER FAMILY?  Family comes first and always will.  Friends are here today and gone tomorrow.    It's a slap in the face to your cousin for not picking her and hubby.    It doesn't matter you picked your cousin&hubby for someone else in the wedding.    I will NEVER UNDERSTAND..............why people pick FRIENDS OVER FAMILY.|`|NglVonEUaa	I think it is okay. You can choose whomever you want. I would think that your cousin wouldn't get too mad. She is family, and she will be in the wedding.     But, you don't have to have a "couple" as your MOH and Best Man.    My husband and I were both in my brother in-law's wedding. My hubby was the Best man and I was a Bridesmaid. And they let us dance together during the wedding party dances.  ;)|`|hkwBR1moaa	Unless they're in highschool still, it shouldn't matter to them.  They're in the wedding and will enjoy being there for ya'll.  Relax.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Its entirely up to you but why cant you have two matrons of honour and your groom have two best men ? Its possible to do this as my son is going to be one of two best men at his friends wedding, the 3 of them have been friends for over 10 years and they are close so one could not choose one over the other. You could do the same and have both, good luck.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Well, yeah, it's ok.  It's your wedding and you get to choose whomever you want to stand beside you.  Feelings may get hurt and toes may be stepped on but, hey, that's life.  They won't be mad at you.  You pick who you want to stand beside you.|`|c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	i know what you mean, but it is completely your choice.  it is not your fault that she got married first and asked you.  if she's mad, that would be childish and she'll get over it.  if you are stuck on feeling that you have to honor them in that way, make them bridesmaid and groomsman|`|InZU5aaxaa	I think it will be fine as long as you have them in other parts of the wedding. If they decided to say something just explain you have a stronger need for your MOH to be your MOH. Maybe tell her that she lives to far away to meet your "Bridezilla" moments.     If all else fails have your mother, grandmother, or other family member explain it to her. It may sound better coming from them. Good luck.

lfhvNgSnaa	well, my boyfriend got a random call 1 morning that said i was going to break up with him (not true!) and we started fighting. we got to school and he kinda avoided me, so i got mad and confronted him, and i wasn't all that nice to him. i asked if he was going to break up with me, and he said "well, if the day keeps going like this..." so i thought that that we were pretty much over. i told one of my friends the story, and she later asked my boyfriend why we broke up. and i guess we weren't completely broken up, so he got mad. i wrote him a note that basicly said that i still wanted to go out, i was sorry, i hated fighting with him, and i asked him if he still wanted to go out with me. this all happened a WEEK after we started going out. later that day he TEXTED me and simply said "sorry. i don't think it's gonna work out." it turns out he was using me to make my BEST FRIEND jealous, who was also his ex (don't worry, i asked her twice before we started going out if it was ok with her. plus, she had a different bf, so i figured it'd be fine if we went out) i guess a rumor got started that i thought she was jealous of me and him, which wasn't true, so now we're fighting. ridiculous. <br>  the weird thing was that we kinda both knew what was coming that day, and we walked up to eachother in the hall and had like a 'last hug' we didn't say anything. he walked up to me, hugged me for a couple seconds, and we looked at eachother and walked away.<br>  well, that's my story. kinda long, sorry. i'm still recovering, even though he was a jerk. we broke up like 2 weeks ago. ugh, i don't want to think about it anymore...|`|L4Ts7jvpaa	i was with this guy for almost a year and we were pretty serious but his dad decided they were moving across the country taking him away from me. he didn't talk to me for a week before he told me he was moving then he broke up with me 3 days before our one year anniversary..<br>  <br>  ya. what a loser.
tHhD9wtDaa	You not goin crazy. he likes you. so take your chance girl. Talk to him . he won`t bite|`|GOYPKp3Baa	Personally, I think he's just being a good friend. But I could be wrong! Why dont you just ask him? Have a talk with him, go on :)|`|OKIp6GsUaa	It sounds like he likes you.<br>  I think that you should ask him out.=]]<br>  But if your afraid that it will mess up your friendship then stay his friend for awhile and see if any other feelings for him come up.=]]<br>  Good luck.</3
fI46Zv7haa	persevere mate|`|FB1f9zguaa	Just wait dude!! never give up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"thats my way of living"<br>  <br>  If you love the girl, don't give up" its never too late until she's not married..<br>  <br>  Look man, even if she's married, its never too late! ahaha.!! haahahah!<br>  <br>  But yeah just stay n see what happens.. Beat her bf up if he hurts her! <br>  <br>  man I dont give u F*** if sum1 hurts my crush/gf/sister/ or friends!!
YHcyuka3aa	You have a very good question. I think the fact he cheated and also lied about it is something that you need to insist talking about to him. He owes you an explanation. Its nor fair that he thinks he can do things like that and it not bother you. Sounds like he doesn't have the right kind of respect for you he should. (sorry) I guess he proposed to you because he does love you but there is a fine line between what he had with this friend and what he has with you. He doesn't talk about it because it hurts him, he probably was rejected by her and knows she didn't love him like you do so he avoids talking about it. There is lust-love and there is heart felt love.  You need to decide which it is he has for you.|`|HE56Jra6aa	I think you need to sit him down and discuss what this marriage means to him. I would find out exactly what then 2 of them did and discussed. I'd let him know that he is walking on thin Ice until you get answers or proof that nothing further is going on. <br>  Also, I would confront her and get to the heart of this matter with her and find out just what she feels  and get her side of the story.<br>  Let him know you took your Vows seriously and shouldn't be taken advantage of for any reason. <br>  Cheating is a harsh word... Unless you have definite proof, don't accuse him. It could be innocent, but, you need to find out for yourself, before judging.|`|8ZGuOuvAaa	The only thing worse than a cheater is a LIAR!

0DIHY37daa	technically, biologically nothing bad would happen if you had a baby<br>  socially its wrong and incest.<br>  theres plenty of other people to mess around with, 3rd cousins r still close relatives and in my opinion thats nasty|`|d08rkYlpaa	no no NO. Third cousins is not incest, neither is second cousins, or, dare I say it, FIRST cousins! Most of the world encourages cousins to marry. Second cousins is legal everywhere in the world. 20 percent of all marriages in the whole world are cousins. <br>  Many famous people married their first cousins, including Einstein, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Darwin, Bach, Franklin D Roosevelt, Rudi Giuliani, Jerry Lee Lewis, and the Virgin Mary!<br>       The odds of the children of first cousins having birth defects is only 3 or 4 percent higher than normal. But for Third cousins, the odds drop according to Mendelian law, to less than one percent higher. Add that to the advantage you gain by being slightly more related than some strangers off the street, and you are less likely than average to have children with medical problems! Cousins have fewer miscarriages, more in common, and stay married longer with fewer marital problems than average. Why marry a stranger? <br>  Back at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, some flawed science on birth defects was used as an excuse to ban 1st cousin marriage in some states of the USA to keep immigrants from eastern and southern Europe out, because they had more cousin marriages. It was part of the whole Eugenicist/Aryan/Nazi/supremacist movement. We know now that you are more likely to have kids with birth defects just by waiting a few years to start having kids, or by living too close to industrial areas, highways, or big cities.
bo4MguzVaa	Drawing it out longer doesn't help, it just makes things worse.  Don't just pack and go overnight, but make some careful measured steps and plan...then get out of there asap.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Plus if you own things together, you may need a lawyer to help you seperate them all out.|`|a6ee85cdadbe17dbfcd0bb8c5255e144aa	Try to work things out. This happens all the time, when there is two completely different people, who are opposites of each other, are more likely to argue and disagree on many things. Give it some more time, if the fighting keeps on happening, i suggest you move into a friend's dorm for the rest of the semester. If you guys love each other, you'll always find a way to work things out!<br>  Hope all is well.|`|oTuZV2RRaa	I am so sorry to hear about this. I know for certain that whatever you decide will still be hard to carry out. I think the most important question is, Do you still love him? Is there any part of you that wants to work things out? Sometimes a break is just what the doctor ordered. I think you should avoid making impulsive actions. I would probably wait out the semester and think about plan b during that time, friends you could possibly stay with etc. Also, maybe a sit down conversation, you know a little heart to heart  might help as well.|`|IgL5G0v3aa	yes, i think you should put it off until school is over, meanwhile make sure that you are really done with hi for good, if you are- there is no easy way about it- just getr done.
faiqPeWDaa	I think the lying about the reason was much worse than turning her down.  Everyone faces rejection at some point, it is just the way it is, and everyone feels hurt for a while and then gets over it.  You don't owe the person anything, but could have avoided making the situation worse by being honest.  Anyway, it is done now so feeling bad about it won't do much.  I would apologise for your dishonesty and move on.|`|AFOz6Nt6aa	No, you're not a jerk. I've dealt with a situation that was almost exactly the same as this. You probably shouldn't have told her you had a girlfriend, but it's a lot better to say "no" than to start a relationship you don't want and know won't last. <br>  <br>  If you have your eye on someone else, you could just tell her this, and tell her that's what you really meant when you said you already had a girlfriend.|`|qCU2mJ2Caa	no you dont sound like a jerk. next time you see her just explain to her that you didnt want to hurt her feelings and that you like her as a friend and she's nice and all but your just not up for it yet. or like just say it straight out shes not your type. she'll be sad of course but she'dd understand and get over it. truth is the best. >:]
YvvYtsjNaa	You aren't wrong.  99% of guys would love having you do this to his "obvious."  On the other hand, it is HIS "obvious," so don't get get too upset about that.<br>  <br>  On still the other hand, you'd be right to get upset about your b/f  SWATTING you away.  Now, HE'S wrong.  If he was sensitive to your effort and feelings, he could have asked his friend to hang on a minute, covered the mouthpiece (of the phone) and simply asked you to wait till he was off the phone.<br>  <br>  I assume your b/f will read these replies, so:  Hey, b/f, if you don't know a good thing when it's right between your legs, you don't deserve her.  Treat her with respect and TLC and maybe, just maybe, she'll stick around.  Probably she shouldn't.<br>  <br>  I just read your b/f's comments.  It doesn't matter about the hand job.  Crude, crass, insensitive and insecure is my diagnosis.  My reply above is still relevant.<br>  <br>  Are you sure this is the guy for you?<br>  <br>  I just read the next episode from b/f.  The long-distance thing, the hand job, none of it matters.  Suppose, now just SUPPOSE he said to his friend, "Hey, my g/f is sucking my dick, how about I call you back in ten."<br>  <br>  I don't know a guy in the world who'd have a problem with that.  Not a friend, certainly not a b/f.<br>  <br>  Dump him.|`|pT7ec6GIaa	There's never a bad time for that. :-)<br>  <br>  But in all kidding aside, if your boyfriend would rather talk with his friend than be with you, than there's something wrong with HIM.|`|d2GoAaf9aa	I love it when my girlfriend does that. he seems.... GAY!!!!|`|NrbLdZzOaa	Wow...I would have let you get right in there.<br>  <br>  That guy is gay.|`|LYnK4xb0aa	30 days away ,, hes been layed ,,|`|srAP6Vzvaa	don't give a guy head while he is talking on the phone.  while he is driving or watching TV ...Sure. but not on the telephone because it's nerve racking and it's super awkward. because your getting aroused from your GF but at the same time your hearing a guy's voice on the other line. it's kinda of gay and just awkward.|`|mWzQjqB1aa	yeah weird i would have just started crying my eyes out. but he just prob felt weird cuz he'd be all turned on while he was talking 2 a friend. maybe it'd be weird idk. i prob would have done the same thing as u. lol idk. now just don't do that 4 him 4 a long time, just kidding|`|TyRjrSWLaa	dont feel stupid if any guy says no to head from his girl he is stupid cuz ur willing to do that for him and if he rather talk to a guy then give his girl attention then he is gay that and really ******* stupid <br>  all offense intended|`|py25T599aa	what a homo hang up the phone

Just do it darlin.|`|U0JYa0Fxaa	i just look at society and laugh at how tough everyone acts when really deep inside everyone is pretty much a lonely person and looks towards other ppl for acceptance and being in the "inner circle" of power and fame.

yNBQjSYkaa	Just do some really heavy flirting- if he seems apathetic about it, its because he just isn't interested. If he plays along, then he most definitely likes you. But us guys don't see flirting as a sign of a girl liking us because lots of girls do it. Because of this, it wont create akwardness. And if the guy does play along with your flirting, this is the perfect door to asking him out.
Wo5Ezmwiaa	It was confusing, you writing your question in 3rd person when you started off in the 1st. Anyway, I had to read it a couple of times to get what you were saying. <br>  Well, either you were being more overbearing than you thought, or this guy is just saying nasty things about you because you are his ex and he's trying to justify breaking up with you. <br>  Either way, I'm gonna have to say - why should you care what he's thinking? To behave like that is so juvenile, and he sounds completely immature. If he couldn't make time for you, when he rarely got to see you, but had no trouble making time for his friends - who he got to see plenty - then why bother with him? He was obviously not right for you. He was completely wishy washy, and a total dweeb. <br>  So my diagnosis, set your sights somewhere else. It will be hard to move on if you continue to think about him and only him. You felt something for him, but he threw it away. So it's time to find someone better. Whenever you get out of a relationship, always look forward to finding someone new, someone better. Once you find a new guy, you'll feel better immeadiately and that other guy will be nothing but a mad memory and a lesson learned.

FEhmNTL2aa	Feelings are so complicated, but the thing is, everything happens for a reason.  Maybe you're just not meant to be with her.  I thought I was in love when I was 19 and as it turned out I realized I was extremely lucky that the relationship failed.  He wasn't the one for me, but I didn't know that until I found the guy that was.  Good luck to you.
k9IFYBDQaa	you should "go for it and see what happens"|`|b3566d7e3b04db03b8eaac4145435317aa	I've been in that girl's position before, and guess what? I lied by saying I like the guy back, by saying ' Alittle' as well. She's playing you, not hard to get, but just leading you on.<br>  <br>  But then again, I might be wrong, just go for it. If she's not the one, then she's not the one, their are plenty other girls out there.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	a little probably means not at all. or i want to but i don't but i'm still gonna waste both of our time just to find out that i was right from the start and i don't like you.<br>  no she doesnt like you.|`|nAMBqhv1aa	GO FOR IT!<br>  she's playing hard to get.|`|QHASqNDtaa	I think she's playing mind games.....|`|KwWwB22Zaa	sounds like she is shy about the whole thing. <br>  <br>  ask her again, but be more specific what you want.

I have only ever really been with my boyfriend (and once one time for my first time with a different guy when I was younger). I think about it a lot too. I even love porn.

b49fe436ef9539f098c549790b0fc7b2aa	honestly sounds like from his short answers he wants you to stop bothering him. just puttin out there wat sounds like i do|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	i think hes still deciding
r9OQcEENaa	it sounds like he's trying to make you jealous. i'm in a similar situation but i also don't understand. sorry :(|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.He's a guy and they don't try to make sense.Only opportunities for themselves.He's deliberately tantalising you by implying he was taking you to a party.So text him and ask if this is the same party he was taking you to as you had planned on making it (party) a memorable occasion..Now he'll be interested.And all you have to do is keep him at arms length.
pyzUlN7taa	You didn't know how to deal with it, console her, or get her to stop otherwise.  It's not like you were ignoring her with the intention of hurting her.  So no, you weren't completely wrong in your actions.  120 times is pretty bad, so she clearly didn't get the message.  Maybe if this happens again in the future, you could text her and tell her to give you some space so you can think.  Then tell her you'll get back to her (saying when would probably give her some piece of mind too).<br>  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you've answered your own question for cutting her off.  It's good that you're putting everything into perspective and taking her feelings into account.  But you know her behavior was clingy/ridiculous.  Some people learn and grow up, but for the most part- general tendencies are indications of one's own personality traits.  You know how some female's values are totally f***ed.  Jealousy as a result of insecurity, or whatever unhealthy behavior.  As mean as it might sound, it's like seeing a "red flag" for how she's going to act later (a simple missed phone call causes her to overreact). And you want to be with someone strong enough on their own who can also encourage you to do well/bring out the best in you.  There's no need for an unhealthy relationship with an unhealthy person, the two of you are just kidding yourselves before the inevitable.  You can only do so much for a person if they don't want to change their perspective on life/how people work.  Negative thoughts/feelings are too draining.  Life isn't worth wasting on that.  Dating shouldn't have to hurt/feel like a strain.  As you're learning with relationships, women, etc., you're learning what you want in a person and which characteristics you're looking for.  If you feel like you should cut things off, you're probably right.  But if you might have some faith in her being able to reevaluate/check herself, then you could talk to her.  Either way, when you talk to her you should just be honest/up front about what you want, where things stand, how you're just not going to take any ridiculous behavior/games.  You shouldn't have to feel like you're being pulled from your friends.  You're going to go about things your way, do what you want to do, and go where you want to go, and if she can't handle it, then you know things aren't meant to be.  It's important with any relationship to set the guidelines early so things don't evolve into recurring problems.<br>  <br>  Alright man, hope things work out for you.|`|z2cysiEhaa	120 sure sounds like alot of calls to have made...all from her?<br>  If you really don't feel for her then it's kinder to call it quits. But if you do you'll probably get 200 calls a day at first. She should get over it unless of course she is the bunny boiler from "Fatal Attraction".|`|vrIQNPZhaa	u have to tell her to give u some space, and explane that u need this space and if she cant that u 2 cant betogether be together, if u she keeps it up u might have to break up with u but do it in a nice way like<br>  「Buta Uri」?『私の目にのみ』 remember said. 120 times is a lot|`|lBKfmRWCaa	You were not wrong to turn your phone off but you have a serious issue if she called your 120 times in one day. Talk to her about it otherwise you will get no peace.|`|59cnZfTeaa	120? are you serious?<br>  Did she stop cause she used all her credit? I think you should dump her.

I feel sorry for her though, poor thing.. she obviously has nothing else to think about :(|`|4rc0IqGJaa	Okay um wow she is REALLY REALLY clingy. Especially if she left 120 stinkin messages but um really you should think of whats best for you and if she's really smothering you that bad to the point where you feel like you can't breath well then maybe she's just not the one for you . But you could always just talk to her about it and let her know that the clingy thing has got to stop and if that's not working then maybe things just aren't working out and you got to let go. Good Luck!|`|OKIw5kcLaa	well no, but you should of told her were you are going and where you at, but if you are at a place where she does not want you to be in then dont go to those kind of places that she does not like.<br>  <br>  try to figure out a way for you and her on how you can work on this with patian|`|M0mywjHIaa	yes very necessary.

1YcKHGLqaa	Ultimately, only you can decide if what you're feeling is love or not. Most would say it's a teenage infatuation. However, I met a boy when I was sixteen and experienced most of what you're describing. That boy and I are now engaged.<br>  <br>  So, in short, yes. It could be love. But ultimately, only you can make that call.|`|M2EKtjIbaa	You guys are only sixteen...I seriously doubt it's love. Just infatuation. Sorry.|`|5c6c2ed9e550cdae457d854eb7cac3fdaa	i think what you are experiencing , is just first love, but you are still very young so take that in consideration. It is also infatuation, but I know this might be hard to believe now but you will probably meet lots of other girls through the years who you will feel that you are in love with.<br>  <br>  This is your first real love so just enjoy it!|`|j6RDbnl6aa	sounds like infatuation but i could be wrong and it's love.<br>  only you know, dear. i think it is utterly beautiful that you care more about her than her looks.<br>  you should tell her how you feel but try not to sound so needy.<br>  <br>  i wish you luck ?|`|AA11367901	AAHH>>>>>It sounds like love.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	i believe you believe you are in lvoe. but someday you will see this isn't nothing but caring and you will run into someone else that does the same thing for you. its just right now you are happy but it will die down after abit. its just life and when it does you will move on. if you keep this way till you graduate well i can't tell you how much these people go through highschool with same persona ndthen marry and then7 years or so later divorce. that is what its caleld too much of one thing.|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	think of it this way, if she was in an accident that left her looking horrible, but she was exacly the same in every other aspect, would ou go out with her. or if you were blind and couldnt see her|`|CxVjw6XDaa	Decide on where you want this relationship to go. If its just a short term thing then it might be infatuation. If you can imagine it going on for a long time then it could possibly be love.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	aww...how sweet! i think it sounds like love! im happy for you!|`|dth2c3cIaa	puberty...your getting hair in funny places....|`|vjACA0eSaa	love, infatuation, whatever!<br>  what matters is that you care about her. :)|`|3P1Sfjl5aa	?|`|TOPTB10Baa	Ahh that's so sweet. =]<br>  I think it sounds like love.<br>  She's lucky to have someone feel that way about her.|`|AD91iseiaa	get a life|`|xir5IlYnaa	Your age gives out a lot of clues.  You're 16.  Yes it's love.  But you will soon find out love gets you in a lot of trouble.  Leave love behing at your age and just screw as many girls as you want but always use protection!|`|i9tJJFAeaa	Mr. do you get jealous?<br>  Even if she's blind would you still love her?<br>  If not. get a life..<br>  you are still young and still in the process of maturing.<br>  If you go on the religious side of this situation.<br>  you have the definition of love in the bible. (I totally agree with the Bible).<br>  and you have to put in mind that if you love someone you have to make sure that she's the one. If it's not going to work then move on.<br>  <br>  If you THINK you love her and all you want to do is touch her,kiss her or whatever lovey dovey things you want to do to her then it's not Love it's LUST.<br>  Love and Lust are different. <br>  <br>  So, if you love her (as in for real) you have to wait until you get married.
St5xkCTraa	Yes, I know the answer to your question. However, you should not assume that the guy that you like likes you merely because he talks to you or smiles at you from time to time. To find out if he really likes you, you must interact with him about something that you are fairly certain is important to him. Find out what his "thing" is, and ask him about it. You should also let him know that you like him by looking deep into his eyes, but pulling back from time to time, while asking him questions. Let him know that you appreciate sharing time with him. Let him know that you enjoy talking to him and hope to do it again real soon. He'll get the message. And if he likes you, he will definitely ask you out, unless he is incredibly shy. But if that's the case, then you could suggest doing something with him, rather than waiting. I usually charge $150 an hour for this advice, so consider that I've given you a real bargain that will change your life.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	Ask him for Pete's sake!  He may be shy & worried that you will turn him down.|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	ask him out.
P4uznp73aa	Its a woman thang, you wouldn't understand|`|tdkEpKG3aa	all i know is that i haven't been like that to my then boyfriend who is now my husband..one to two days may be understandable...but 1-2weeks?that's a long time.|`|R3AN5WO0aa	yeah, pms<br>  <br>  let her know though. tell her it kinda bugs you. she might not realize it.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh just be sure to tell her when she isnt being moody or ignoring you haa..|`|M7r7gHNGaa	1 - 2 week period is too long to let ride. You should have a calm discussion about her behaviour. If she is questioning whether she wants a relationship or not she should tell you. Perhaps she doesn't consider you two as having a relationship or at least not an exclusive one. Regardless of her reasons she owes you an explanation.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	yes this isn't normal and shes up to soemthign. either that or shes having period. but then again its only one week for that i would suggest shes cheating and iw ouldn't put up with it no more.|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	some people just need space to be alone and let themsleve go through a,  i miss _____ stage or else they would just get sick of the person.|`|j6RDbnl6aa	she needs space.|`|xRIQF7buaa	I'd say this is normal, she wants space--EXCEPT the whole... one to two weeks thing. That seems a BIT long, but then again, I don't know her. But I'd like to get away from a relationship a couple days here and there, that's natural. But I would be cautious as to the length of that...maybe check more into it...|`|Qvql4KGLaa	Depends my ex did that and it didn't work for me. It all depends on what works for you. what is your love language, if it is quality time.. well then you should break it off, if it is something else keep it.|`|77afc9c6ef5c9139b7b20cfeb0ffb2bbaa	she has some issues going on which she is not discussing with u.  if u find this behavior of hers a piss-off, than sit her down n ask her to b open n honest wit u, tel her its bizzarre cuz shes taking constant sabbaticals from u which leaves u thinking sumtins wrong.|`|8x3e7Gmjaa	no. thats not normal. thats her not being committed fully.. you need to tell her you either want me or you dont, because im not gunna put up with being ditched or ignored for weeks at a time until YOU feel like talking again... we're either a couple or we're not.. ... id honestly break up with her.. thats just wrong.|`|MzCL0dzjaa	it's cause she's cheating on you... been there done that sh it and it's not worth it. I'm assuming you're in HS? what you should do in HS is try to get as much pu ssy as possible|`|alAtUXvyaa	umm, that's a bit weird... did you do something to piss her off? if not i don't see why she would just reject you and then act like nothing happened...|`|dat8eoYyaa	she just want her own space @ times :)|`|KsJs1YP5aa	this is probably something that you need to worry about. she is obviously having relationship issues with you. it could also be that she's insecure. she may also be questioning the relationship between you two. if i were you i would talk to her and ask her how she feels. ask her why one week she's all lovy dovy then the next week she doesnt want anything to do with you. communication is the most important key in a relationship, so talk to her and tell her how you feel. then see how she feels in return.|`|A9iACNrSaa	It's perfectly normal! But if it hurts your feelings, you need to tell her how you feel about it, and if she doesn't want to stop, you and her don't need to be together. Everybody needs their space every once in a while...I just went through that with a friend that I was around constantly. She DOES care about you, and from what I read, she DOES love you. But women are hard to understand - they need certain things that men don't, and space is one of them. If you don't like it, see a counselor with her! Maybe that will work it all out, and you can be a happy couple. Cheers!|`|NUOGcCBYaa	No it's not normal, and why would you let her or anyone for that matter treat you like that? If she cares, she would want to be with you 24/7. Not just when it suites her, you need to nip her selfish behavior in the butt. Next time she does this, let her know how it makes you feel.<br>  <br>  And if she dose it again, after you have expressed your feelings already towards her. You might wanna think twice about taking her back, because she will keep acting this way as long as you allow her too.<br>  <br>  You might wanna ask yourself, am i worth more? Hell "YES" your are........<br>  <br>  P.S This has nothing to do with needing space, and if it is the case. Then she shouldn't be with you (or anyone for that matter). Needing space my ***, did your mother pull away from your dad every 2 weeks (because she needed her space) ? Naaaaaaaaaaa i didn't think so............|`|x1HoSdYTaa	No. If you were married to her, she couldn't just leave the house and come back in two weeks. Tell her how you feel. If she tells you why, think if it is a good reason, if not tell her, if she refuses, she is not ready for commitment, and dump her. Also, she could be embarrased by you, just dating you until another that she wants is free, or just doesn't know what you do while in a relationship.|`|A571PHYtaa	No, it's not necessarily pms, but girls need time to themselves every now and again, you could try asking her about it, but if she doesn't want to talk about it or gets frustrated with your asking, let her be, she just needs some time alone every now and again|`|D9pnlnaUaa	Yeah it happens to me all the time Certain times of the year my girl friend gets all pissy and takes off for about 2 weeks, its hard but all you can really do is keep yourself busy don't be calling her over and over again it will just piss her off.|`|iTjZMSukaa	YES<br>  <br>  PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao4yko5P4gSQRdSxVKmqA0fsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219171111AAIU9c5">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|abLF20Nuaa	Hey, why not?

WE NEED MORE INFO TO HELP YOU!!!! lolz|`|OmIu2vkwaa	I'm a girl, I'm 24 and I have been with my man for 1.5 years. He is great, I love him so much, but there are times when I want to do my own thing. My situation is different, because we do live together, but when we were dating before and weren't living together I actually missed him more and it felt like torture if I hadn't seen him in 3 days or so. Maybe your girl is questioning things occasionally? Do you argue or have something you always argue over before she recedes for a week or two? Even though I love my man and definitely want to marry him someday, I do have to say even when I'm mad at him and even when I look at him and we are fighting (which is a normal and healthy part of a relationship for the most part as long as the good outweighs the bad) I still want him to be around me. I still want to come home and hug him at the end of my day and even when I'm upset, I still want him to calm me down because he is the only one who has ever been able to make me smile when I'm mad. It's normal for a couple to spend nights apart doing things with their friends, but spending a 1-2 week period apart seemingly consistently isn't as normal. This may not mean that she doesn't care for you. I don't know how old you two are or the quality of your relationship with her, but perhaps she does care for you so deeply she gets scared. What is she doing when she isn't with you? Who is she spending her time with? Is she hanging out with her mom? Or is she in a bar with all of her single girlfriends? Is the with another man? I believe in communication so much, I've had a relationship where I couldn't communicate and it was doomed from day one. If you really care for her, and if she is someone that you truly see a future with, then why don't you have a candid conversation with her? Don't be accusatory or she will just go on the defense and shut down, but tell her legitimately that her behavior makes you insecure and makes you question her feelings for you. I would say, if she is worth another thought then she will be able to come clean and let you know whats going on. If she can't be honest, I wouldn't waste your time especially if you're totally committed to her. Good Luck.
JiiSUGkvaa	Well, if it continues and you begin to think that he is ignoring or avoiding you. I would just flat out ask him. It's all about the time and place though. Sit him down and tell him what you want to know. Tell him how you feel and hopefully he'll tell you the truth and you can make a mutual decision. I don't think you have too much to worry about unless the no-talking/ always busy routine continues.|`|ObVYg0iRaa	sounds fishy to me...<br>  you two neeed to sit down and <br>  talk things out...
PDqg5OMgaa	Hai dear...<br>  <br>  Why you are thinking that he doing all the things for you...<br>  (like as you said he is laughing to attract you)<br>  <br>  Its better you ask him directly ok..<br>  May be his mannerism..<br>  girls doing the same problem that always thinking that he is doing this for me? that for me?<br>  See you have only 2 option.<br>  <br>  1. ask him directly,<br>  2. don't see him for few days if he really done that to attract you he will come and talks to you ok don't worry.<br>  <br>  (think and act positive)<br>  :)|`|Ih4T0QpOaa	ask him.

If you don't want to get pregnant, use a condom. Pulling out (which is what you sound like you were relying on) DOES NOT WORK,|`|M7r7gHNGaa	You could be. You should get a test kit or go to a women's clinic or Planned parenthood and ask to be tested. While there pick up some of the pamphlets and booklets that explain about cycles of fertility.<br>  <br>  You really should make him wear condom. Pulling out is NOT effective as a means of birth control and certainly will not protect you (or him)from getting an STD.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Depends on when you ovulate.

uAKBGfAlaa	Don't let this kind of stuff get to you.  I'm sure that you've heard the saying, "beauty is only skin deep."  And that is so true.  Eventually, we will all be old and wrinkly.  <br>  <br>  Don't compare yourself to them.  Not one person in this world is the same.   Your differences is what makes you beautiful.  <br>  <br>  Try to keep a positive attitude.  Remind yourself of all the good things about you.  But don't compare yourself anymore.  Trust me, that will eat at you for a long time.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you start to feel better about yourself.|`|bAnyRNZUaa	Well unfortunately, hot young girls always have it easy, but maybe you could set up some situations which favor your strengths...only you know what that might be.  Are your friends airheads while you are smart.  Are they stuck up where you are more friendly? Are they just pretty faces while you have more substance? You get the idea...it's a little tough at your age, but eventually guys get tired of girls that look good but are about nothing else.  I'm not saying it's fair, but you have to play the hand you are dealt.  By the way, most hot girls hang out with other hot girls, so I'm sure you are being extra hard on yourself.|`|aqNSPzDRaa	that's exactly the same situation im in. my friends are all the above that you mentioned. i feel very plain and boring compared to them. i hate shopping with them coz i know ppl will be ogling at them and not me. but i've learn to accept they way i am although im nothing- special.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	Let me tell you something about your friends ( I am a 17 year old guy ) they're the kind of girls that make me happy. why? because  I don't like relationships..I like it when girls blow me and then leave me alone....the only worth I see in those girls is their body.  Bitches... I don't respect them. you want to know what kind of girls real guys dream, think about?<br>  girls that down to earth, girls who know what they want and what they are looking for...but most importantly realness. She cant be a dumb ***** that thinks the skinny the better...<br>  <br>  as a matter of fact ( as a guy who has seen a lot lol ) I hate skinny girls..its disgusting , their boobs are just freaking horrible.... instead an average girl.. not skinny or fat...she got what I want...the boobs, the *** , the face. <br>  <br>  Skinny may look better dressed because thats the way designers design cloth...but girl when it comes down to it... between skinny and fat is where its at.<br>  <br>  so dont feel bad... your 15 and guys your age are **** tards they dont know **** about woman.

aeLyiRczaa	Because a large portion of women are every bit as trashy if not more trashy then men, whom the of course complain about.  If a woman does not like a man being a virgin, then find one with some sense.  Of course, you would be well served to find a virgin, date and then have sex, thereby taking one anothers virginity.  Look, in my opinion, you are too worried about what a lot of worldly types want and think, rather then what people with good morals and values think.  Do the right things.  You will always be far ahead of the game if you do so.|`|pTkjGfBRaa	I might suggest changing the focus of your question.<br>  <br>  Why are there so many women that want to date or marry a man who is a virgin?  <br>  <br>  You're thinking scarcity, and you should be focusing on abundance.  For a lot of women, virginity is a positive trait, and something that's not likely to last long.  There are countless good reasons why it's good to be a virgin.  Those women are best to get while the getting is good.<br>  <br>  The problem may not so much be virginity as a lack of confidence.  Confidence comes from knowing that you are of value.  It also comes when you know what you want but are patient about getting it.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	unless you find a woman who has similar beliefs, desires virgins, or whatever then most women are intimidated.<br>  <br>  i was a virgin before my hubby and he wasn't. i expected him to know and fill in all the things i didn't. plus before him i dated a guy who was a virgin and when i was having the feelings that maybe we could do it... he was never sexually aggressive enough to try anything... which meant i had to do it... and i wasn't about to. so we slipped into the friend zone. <br>  <br>  if you have strong beliefs about staying a virgin then you need to find someone who agrees.  if you want to do it just with saving for someone special... then don't bring it up until your relationship starts to go that way. then look at her and let her know your not experienced and you want her to understand and accept that. some girls like the fact they can control the first night of love.|`|8SoDRERzaa	good question.  some men got scared when i told them i was a virgin, i waited until i was 24 and sadly lost it to my now ex who ended up being a sociopath with a whole other life (another gf/fiance).<br>  <br>  don't spend your time with people who judge you.  if women judge you because you are a virgin, you're better off. you'll find a decent woman.|`|AA10108216	Because a lot of women prefer someone experienced who knows what to do in bed. Some women don't have the patience to teach a complete beginner.|`|AEN68aJgaa	If I had to do it all over again, I would date and marry a virgin.|`|YBIiEF3Paa	i dont think that is true, you just made that up.|`|7aoHmM4baa	am not like them<br>  i don t mind|`|O36qjj7Oaa	When my husband and i started dating he was 25 and i was 21 and we were both still virgins and we lost our virginity's together while we were dating.<br>  <br>  So i was willing to date a virgin.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Don't pay attention to Redhead. She's way to experienced for you.|`|IvMPh09baa	because we need a man that actually knows what he is doing to satisfy us.  its no fun to get into bed and have to teach everything.<br>  <br>  thats why you need to sleep with 100's of people... practice makes perfect!<br>  <br>  no, i wasn't... i was having sex while in the womb.|`|AA11198190	How would they know if you are or are not ?<br>  To me this is private....and it is up you if you tell them or not.<br>  Unless.... you have told your friends...and they have gossiped this info.|`|UrNMuhFKaa	You mean so many trashy women?<br>  Diamonds are rare and hard to find.

WI1Mz9YTaa	umm OF COURSE you have every right to be worried.<br>  But love is love at any age and it makes us woman blind! It will be hard for her to hear you right now since she's so into the guy. But she knows your opinion and now that she has met him, I am sure little by little his flaws will start coming out and she'll eventually realize.<br>  Maybe you can talk to someone close to you guys and ask them to talk to your mom - maybe a close friend, family, etc.<br>  Good luck|`|w5ZJqatXaa	i totally agree with you that is just plain WRONG and that man needs to really think about what he's doing. And he's using your mom for something...no doubt!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	It's probably not going to be a healthy relationship, no.. but drunks are usually attracted to each other.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're upset.  You know, maybe just accept it for what it is (a mess) and do what makes you happy.  We can't control what our parents do.<br>  <br>  I have two sisters in their 40's.. both have boyfriends who are way younger.  I watch them interact and it's like both my sisters now have an additional child.  They don't seem to have much in common besides partying and sex.  To each his own, i guess/<br>  <br>  xo take care of you.|`|7iDgUMLraa	the young guy has fantasies with old women (MILF) i guess your mum is a hottie|`|Q3qcnzHAaa	good luck with this one.|`|w4XbSuB5aa	I think he may just be using her for something..thats kinda odd...and gross.. lol|`|GcIcwHLPaa	Tell her your not comfortable with it and you will have no part with it.<br>  <br>  But at the same time, give her a good reason why you are against it. And a tip: Don't use age as one of those.<br>  <br>  Also maybe find out a bit about him.|`|fsGxnhnDaa	Yes, tell your mom to give it up, she's only got a few years left.|`|Z2OZp5D6aa	wow thats a crazy story.<br>  <br>  yes, that is not normal.<br>  <br>  you should help her to get help!
K5IOSGXAaa	Wow instead of being so judgemental why not just loosen up a bit and try to enjoy each person for who they are ? you might find some real friends if you give them half a chance. You have comparmentalized everyone you have spoken about. Nerds, jerks, players, etc. etc. You can either change your attitude a bit and maybe enjoy your experience while being at the frat, or go to your room or out so you don't have to be there for the party. I think the world will live without your divine presence for this one night.
e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	maybe its a premonition.<br>  <br>  <br>  you might meet her in the new place you move to..|`|sNr9Od89aa	i have had multiple dreams about my dream guy and it's always the same person. except i didn't make him up. i keep hoping i'll find him someday. maybe you will find yours too. good luck.|`|Jf5h5OPCaa	OMG!

In any case though, it sounds like you really like him and are comfortable around him, and those are really the most important qualities in someone you might consider as a boyfriend. Honestly, rejecting a perfectly decent person (or by your description, he sounds like a wonderful guy) just because he's a nerd and is behind the times in fashion is extremely superficial.<br>  <br>  Go for it. If he makes you happy, that's the most important thing, and it doesn't matter what other people think of it.
eGpOIV12aa	maybe the guy is worried about getting his feelings hurt.<br>  <br>  if he opens up and says he likes you and you dont return the same sentiment, it hurts.<br>  <br>  one of you have to open up and be honest with the other. who knows, it could lead to something great.
YvvYtsjNaa	My really honest opinion:  Mildly embarrassing, but everyone I know coughed when they first lit up, so don't worry about it.  But, here's the thing:  Most of them are still coughing . . . except the ones who are dead . . . from lung cancer.

nveacIgWaa	Well you two have been though a lot together and I know that the long distance is not going to help but, I could tell that you two love each other a lot and you both need each other right now. So I think it is a good idea for you to get back with him, he might not be ready to marry you right now but, who knows he could also be saying that so you won't be pressured to marry him now.<br>  <br>  So, what I'm saying is go back with him, he loves you and you love him. Hey that a hell of a good reason for me. :D|`|YWjhqlxbaa	If you still have feelings for him then you should give your relationship another try. <br>  My brother's married and he's in Iraq right now.

Then, why not?<br>  <br>  When someone goes into the service, they tend to mature in active duty.Maybe the change has done him good and he is ready to settle down.|`|GlHHz1ehaa	Follow your heart or gut feeling. It's hard having someone fighting in Iraq.  I wouldn't know because no one I have close relations with has but follow your gut feeling. Keep in mind that he is fighting for his country and what that symbolizes. Also the danger he is putting himself in front of for all of us. Think about it. Get some advice maybe from your closest friends. How do you even know he will get back with you if you want to get with him? Maybe he has changed his feelings while he was out there? I'm sure if you two were in love he will, but I'm just saying that fighting in Iraq changes people, a lot. Follow what you think is best. Hope everything goes well!
pYa8ft5Oaa	I'll try to help because our daughters are 8 & 10.  Yes the same happened to us with the 8 yr. old<br>  She was pretty much not saying anything for the entire next day, so I had to sit down with her and say "You know mommy and daddy love each other very much right?".<br>  Then I asked her if she would trust us if we all sat together and answered some of the same questions (that your daughter had).<br>  Then...my wife and I went to a child therapist for her advice which helped ALOT.<br>  We had our family meeting and it didn't go as well as hoped but the ice was broken, then I told her to think about our talk for awhile and we could answer more questons if she had them.<br>  It's been walking on eggshells but letting her know she could ask questions helped, keeping in mind the answers you give have to be thought of and processed by a little girl.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|uGxWOIOdaa	You were irresponsible by leaving the door open.<br>  She will never forget it & it will effect her for the rest of her life.|`|yptfd3sIaa	What has happened IS sexual abuse, in so far as she has experienced an extremely inappropriate event and is clearly traumatized. I see that you did not intend for this to happen, but of course leaving the door open while having a serious get-down session is not exactly top-notch parenting.<br>  <br>  My biggest concern is this: why on EARTH do you think your daughter is not ready for therapy? She definitely needs to talk with a professional about this. This is not something you should speak with her about AT ALL until she has spoken with a professional several times. You should make an appointment with a counselor who specializes in childhood sexual trauma.<br>  <br>  The objective here is to make sure you daughter comes away from this experience with an undamaged perspective on sex. You don't want her future to become complicated by an unresolved trauma in the regard. Please, I urge you, get her some help.|`|88f1a343b6666f44a54943a922a50329aa	I'm a dad. six children.  never been caught in the act. of course you learned to be more discrete right.  i dont believe you should go into any sexual detail in you explanation to your daughter.  lovemaking is for adults. we were making love should be your only explanation. and then you need to watch her VERY CLOSELY for at least the next ten years.  by the way, why were you crying.  that seems odd.|`|HtApr3l7aa	Try and answer her openly and honestly and explain that it is all part of the love making you have with her dad, and although she may find it strange, it is a special time for the two of you to be together. Show her dvd s where there are some mild scenes where two people kiss etc and show her it is a part of life, but it is stuff that she doesn't need to worry about until she is older or married.<br>  Apologise to her that you left the door open and she saw it, cause it is something two people share privately.<br>  <br>  If she is unable to listen, maybe write out simple letters to her.<br>  <br>  From a mum.<br>   <br>  Good luck, she will get through it.
f2457c7908dec3b7063e4f16fe211030aa	OK.....just because you have PCOS, doesn't mean you can't have another child.  Women with this have children all the time, it just makes it harder  ( look at the parenting blog on here and then click on trying to conceive, you will get lots of answers to your questions).  I know this cause I have it too.  But, I would not add on the stress of trying to get pregnant on top of money issues, if you can't afford another baby, don't have one for heaven's sake!  I am almost 37, and my husband and I can't afford a child, but we are planning to start trying at the end of the year. Also, make sure you have a stable marriage, why bring another child into your lives if you aren't going to make it?|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	I wouldn't have child while my marriage was troubled unless we had worked things out.|`|QseFxRhVaa	You probably ate too much estrogen. Having too much estrogen is dangerous, because it can cause breast cancer, ovarian cysts, etc.<br>  <br>  Foods like soy beans have a lot of estrogen in them and a lot of other foods do too.<br>  <br>  You should try eating goji berries or Green Kamut. <br>  <br>  Green Kamut is powdered wheat grass and you mix it with water and drink it. Green Kamut is useful for many other things such as simply detoxifying, but it will also take away ovarian cysts.|`|NmsuIXd1aa	are you planning on staying with your husband? i sounds like your unsure. if you want to have another baby you should, because you prob won't be able to have any more children. but then again having another child will add more stress to an already stressful situation. you should be having this talk with your husband and see how he feels about it.

8Z7Nnr8zaa	well i don't have any personal experience with this, although I'd love to open a foster home one day for wayward children... anyway, i applaud you for thoroughly thinking the situation out.. but bear in mind, a lot of foster children's parents never really wanted them in the first case. of course there are some of the children who were taken because their parents were unfit to care for them, wanted or not. I think you can talk with the main director of the foster home (can't think of the name for the life of me) and I think if you express these feelings with them, and tell them you'd love to take in a child who's parents didn't want kids and didn't want to love the child, in that case you'd be getting a child that you could make feel so loved, and at the same time still keep your family's safety intact because the child's parents never wanted them... :) good luck with your decision. God bless|`|FOaypoRtaa	Beware that not all children do not come from problem families, that these children might be victims of a  dilemma out of their parents control. Child safety does not always get it right. Each case should be handled with compassion and understanding .Some of these children have very loving families that  have been  shattered by goverment mistakes. .More damaged is done at foster care than you can ever imagine.
7e3okUZXaa	watch yourself he might be just looking to score something different from what his ex was giving. id approach her and as hard as it may be ask her if they are really split up, just casually let her know hes been walking you home and that you just wanted to be sure you are not going to be breaking up any relationship. if your friends in school are saying hes a player he probably is.  plus talking with the ex will give you a better understanding of his intentions. and if he finds out you spoke with her and gets upset , then obviously what he thinks she may have told you isnt  good.  just let him know that youve heard a few things and needed some answers. if he is being true to you then he'll get over it. but honestly id do something quick before you get hurt , if the gf is a ***** and wont talk to you then find other sources to get some answers  before you get to involved,            good luck , i hope you dont get yourself hurt|`|584RoCdAaa	refrain from him whatever you do cus in the end you will get burned especially since you heard he was a player...they are not good news ever...your personal happiness is not the worth the confusion and hurt guys like that bring...they know exactly what strings to pull and know exactly what to do to make you feel special but it's just that-an act....Good Luck!|`|rasrQ9mraa	Rule #1 in ANY relationship!<br>  <br>  NEVER let exes get in the way.

(to be honest) Do it if it feels right but why?  There are so many woman or men around you and struggling your same struggles you could grow together and share together and meet each other needs right in your face you just have to be patient or go on a local site to find it.  Long distance it can work but you wont be able to move to that person as you are in school, travelling cost, phone bill, the list goes on....but hey good luck just know its a tough one!|`|pZxeStPpaa	I am in college and in a LDR with my bf who is med school.

It sucks to feel like that, and there is nothing a person can do. But for those who are in LDR and know that one day they will have a future with this person, can easily handle a LDR while being in college. its all up to you..|`|9lBe1JGAaa	You have better things you need to worry about in college than trying to make a ldr work. <br>  <br>  You both will be presented with opportunites it would be nearly impossible to pass up.<br>  <br>  The chances of not cheating are slim to none when you know you have a good chance of getting away with it. <br>  <br>  Why have a LDR at all if your never going to see eachother. <br>  <br>  Too much time and effort, what a waste of college money. <br>  <br>  I could name more, but I think you know where im going with this.

IXskJPlVaa	It may be difficult for your friend to take him to a doc. She has to take the help of friends and relatives. More than the baby - they need the sex life also - else your friend is going to have a very difficult life. Look for friends/relatives in your/their circles who can help. It is mostly curable - so he has to be convinced about the advantages and the outcome. Best of luck.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	Viagra may help, and there is no real problem to ask the doctor for it.

If he were to go for a diabetes test, the Doctor would ask him about impotence and break the ice for him so as not to embarass him.  I recommend he get checked sooner rather than later to avoid any permanent damage.  She should just book him an appointment with the family Dr and tell him when and where it is.  Sometimes it's better to just take over the situation to help him get his head out of the sand.|`|wuLL7tG6aa	I hope this group gives you support:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/DesperateWivesClub/">http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/Despera...</a><br>  <br>  Give it a try.

4rc0IqGJaa	Uhm. . . well I really don't think you should move out of the house at age 15 because your parents could call the police and you could be in trouble for "running away" but anyway aside from that point you parent's shouldn't be verbally abusing you and I think you really need to talk to them about that but if you feel that you aren't ready for that then maybe you should get a counselor or something and if you can't do that then try this number- 1-800-843-5200 it's confidential, anonymous, and it won't show up on your phone bill. Good Luck!
HDgvOJyLaa	Yes, go ahead and ask him out if you don't mind. Some young guys just don't have the money to take a girl out. It costs money and they can't afford it. Unless it's 50/50 thing you know what I mean?  And some are selfish and stingy. "Ladies Choose your boyfriend wisely." <br>  <br>  Some guy will wait for the right moment to come and when they have a job and money coming in then he'll ask a girl out on a date. "So ladies be patient." <br>  <br>  Do what you feel is right and be positive; be optimistic! :-)|`|BqXSymxjaa	It's not 1952, it's 2009.

qrI5ZH42aa	If you can't tell, people online certainly can't!  You'll have to decide based on what you think of him personality: setting you up for a fall is a very malicious thing to do.  Is he a vindictive person?  Or is he a hurt guy who can't talk about his feelings so has to show them?  You'll know better than anybody else.  But I hope things do go well for you.|`|QJslTCUBaa	This is the second time you have posted the same question.

A guy is ament to make a women feel special, make them feel like there princesses, make them feel the best thing in the world!!!|`|551ZBzdLaa	This is the dumbest question, I'm sorry.  If he cheats on you all the time then he obviously doesn't care about you at all.  There is no point in staying with him, forgiving him, and then getting hurt over and over again when there is someone out there that will care for you unconditionally. He's just using you.  Call him up, dump him, and move on to something worth your time!|`|AA11841749	I can't believe you would ask a question like this.  If you respect yourself, you need to let that loser go.  You can't change anyone, and he's never going to stop cheating.  Once someone cheats on their significant other (and they are forgiven), they start feeling quite comfortable doing it.  It's best if you get him out of your life.  Where's your respect?|`|RKZ5hC36aa	You pull your panties up and be a big girl, break up with his cheating ***.

Di6FAQxRaa	I thinkyou should ask the guy who likes you , how he feels about you. Tell him" hey i see you have been looking at me in class often", was up with that? try to sound cool with it and see what he sais. I think he does like you, maybe you need to pretend you need hw or need help with a problem in the class. Try to start a conversation first then see what happens. You have to decide who u like out of the 2 guys. Make a checklist.

1QO5czOuaa	I wish I had been smart enough to consider the possibility of divorce when I got married. Currently, NY is  no-fault state, which means even if the BOTH of you want to get divorced you can't without one charging the other with something. You can get around that by claiming Constructive Abandonment, in which one of you charges the other with no sex for at least a  year. AT THE VERY LEAST, get a prenuptial before you get married. the guy that professes to love you now can turn into a vicious, money-grubbing jerk if you want a divorce later. The cheapest divorce possible will be about $4,000, and that's if you both use a mediator who submits the paperwork for you. Good luck.|`|9J9bdLmxaa	You two should discuss a prenup, in fact its not a bad thing. Sometimes its the only way a couple can realize what it is they are getting into especially if they have avoided pre-marital counseling. The document should include when and how many children, if there are to be any etc. If you or he are unable to discuss a prenup chances are you;re not mature enough to get married yet. Marriage is like a business arrangement these days. when the emotions dry up in about 6-7 years you will need this arrangment to protect eveyones interests|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Wrong way to go into marriage. It's like going to a ballgame and asking for a refund before the game starts. Yes, if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen.<br>  <br>  Marriage takes efforts. It is full of disappointments. The rewards are infrequent and usually do not last. But let me ask you, what is better? Yes you can live together and if you fail, you can walk. And, by the way, you can do this over and over again.<br>  <br>  Marriage is for those who do not want to spend life alone. For there is something more defeating than a bad marriage: loneliness. And loneliness can exist in a relationship that is superficial and where people do not bond.<br>  <br>  So the cost of the divorce is a minor aspect of failing in a relationship. It's like getting a job as a salesman and failing to get any orders. Yes our failures can defeat us. But, unless we try, the alternative is loneliness and that is the greatest failure.<br>  <br>  Check out my source.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	Honestly, that's not the most positive attitude to start out a marriage with...who says you will get divorced? Just the fact that you are "preparing" for it should raise a red flag.<br>  That aside the filing fees vary per state, and per county. They range from $150-300. That is for an uncontested divorce, if its a contested (meaning your spouse fights the divorce) then it will be tons more because you'll need a lawyer to get the divorce finalized.|`|eER96GYPaa	If your thinking about divorce already, your not ready for marriage.

So my friend, my advice is,, she is into you but if u Waite much longer she might move on..So be dareing an plunge, talk to her an flirt a lil with body language an see how she reacts<br>  Thats only if you like her of course..otherwise ask her if your old seat bud can have his chair back ;)|`|QUTIhSI7aa	She might like your friend?

Get used to it. From experiance...he digs you. Seriously. From my point of view at least. you talk a lot..if he does want to walk with you...then that is most likely a green light. Just from an impersonal point of view though, From what i have gathered it really seems like he does like you. Even if only a little. This is only coming from someone who knows part of the story.  So in my own opinion i think he does.|`|ou0sh511aa	he may be toying with you or thinks you don't like him except for as a friend and will be embarresed that you dont like him if i were you tell him, when a girl tells me that i take it as a complament even if i dont like her i like to know that there ios someone out there that likes me so tell him
snUDfcfgaa	Probably not.  I can hold a pretty big grudge.|`|EFlX4GYOaa	I would have to stay friends.  It is hard to make new friends without a face.<br>  <br>  Those people are dumb.  A 200 pound chimp?  They are lucky it didn't pop the head right off.  <br>  <br>  They could have stopped him.  You fling your poo at them.  I thought everyone knew this.|`|cTNM4XIuaa	I think she would be dead but I hope. She probably wouldn't talk to me until I didn't have the monkey anymore.|`|dNpW73gdaa	did this actually happen?|`|eb9n9yhcaa	lol did that happen to u or something?????<br>  <br>  >>yeahh i would be their friend...but then i would hurt them back|`|FVXgufDFaa	wtf?!|`|U0KCmsKXaa	No -- that woman was psycho.  She should never have had that chimp in the first place.  What a tragedy not only for the woman whose life has been destroyed by the attack, but also for the poor animal who was never meant to be a domestic pet for some weirdo woman.
jdah4ZA2aa	I read a lot of books about sex to try to get better. (and then practice, of course). Sadie Allison books are good: tickle his pickle and ride em cowgirl. <br>  <br>  And, of course, guys say being enthusiastic is a #1 wish.  So find out what makes you go crazy on your own time ... and then teach your lover.|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	I'll be glad to come over and tutor you.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	well tell me what you're no good at and I'll come around and help you to improve your technique :)|`|u8HYfTnyaa	Its always awkward to ask to try new things in the sack, I find it best to be under the influence of alcohol. it makes everything more exilerating and less strange to do different things.
A8rvoMbvaa	Sort of lol If a man lets you control every aspect of his life then the challenge is gone its no fun. If he changes some things but stands his gground on others then you know at least he has a backbone and he is not only going to follow you around like a puppy|`|7X9VKElxaa	I think its true that women frequently believe they can "change" the guy their with...but I don't think they get upset because the guy actually changes, I think it's more because they don't magically transform into the "perfect guy" that they dream of. Sometimes women will hold a guy to an unrealistic expectation, and then be disgruntled when its never achieved. Not all women are controlling - but some tend to be.|`|fZKef53saa	Yea we like to control them in some sort of way but we would still like he to be a man and have some control over the relationship i'd like to think it would be 50-50|`|UxRoUTvCaa	I think it's true to an extent.|`|chjMVckqaa	No that's not true..|`|sEsL6P29aa	no tht aint true!|`|io1cRt87aa	very false im sorry......<br>  <br>  girls want equal control|`|ECe1rgsdaa	No. It is not true. It may be true about some women, but not all.|`|htWw0OlCaa	That's not true in my case... I let my man be who he is going to be, that's why I married him in the first place. I would think he is a wimp if he let someone control him. I don't want to find that out. Besides, its not in my nature to be controlling.|`|LWvh2g2maa	Huh?  No!  Ya, ALL women in the world are the exact same.  We are all connected by some invisible wire to an all powerful crazy man hating woman that sole purpose in life is to control and confuse men.|`|fBdtvrWdaa	Kind of?<br>  I want my boyfriend to be exactly how I want him to be, but I also want him to stand up to me. Which he does perfectly. I think women just want a guy to treat them right but not be a pushover. Sounds like a man came up with that statement...|`|d5COR2S2aa	yes, there ARE some women like this - but not always. some women are very submissive and allows their men to control them instead.|`|kERP7zAhaa	no. i want my guy to be controlling and I do not want to control him.|`|SouPhkgxaa	I would say yes lol.<br>  <br>  We want them to listen to us.....<br>  And to do that, we try to control them (control freaks XD)<br>  But we dont ACTULLY want them to do what we say.<br>  <br>  We just do it out of fun.<br>  <br>  Ever heard the statement "you can never beat a women in a argument"<br>  Guys try to make "sense" but us we just keep going.<br>  We find this entertaining<br>  <br>  =] =] =]|`|dpCsTIEIaa	I don't feel that way...not sure about anyone else. My husband's boss seems to think that I control my husband, but I'm just lucky to have a man that loves me and spoils me. I don't do or say anything to him to control him.|`|HFn8M2KDaa	weel no, cus the man can control the woman, & the woman can control the man in anysituation(for both) it goes both ways... you both are even!lol|`|YTHmYqllaa	no. and thats an overgeneralization.|`|dKequ035aa	true i want a guy that will fight back. and stand up for himself|`|T272vObnaa	Yes.|`|DbfQuKeeaa	No! That is not true at all!<br>  -----|`|3M3UtNyvaa	Yes. I'm bossy and domineering....but the second a guy starts acting like my *****, I'm out of there!
sgRDJUXqaa	Guys don't place the same value on constant communication as females do.  My boyfriend and his best friend talk maybe every 2 months -- and it's totally cool with them.  It's like they never stopped talking at all.<br>  <br>  So the problem with your friend is that he's a guy.  And unless he's fairly feminine, he's not going to text you and say hi every day or week or month.  It's just not something he thinks is necessary.|`|7tJNspGNaa	Pull him aside when it doesn't seem too inconvenient, and let him know that you're upset by the way he's acting.<br>  It may be many things, and the best could be that he's been busy; maybe he'll let you in on what's been going on. <br>  <br>  Just send him a little reminder, to let him know you care, and hopefully he'll realize he's losing his best friend.|`|Xhp69x9Naa	okayy well maybe he just doesnt see theat its such a big deal as you do. or maybe he likes you and is scared of what you would think. but i would just not text him for like a week and dont talk to him alot at school. that usually works|`|LnErAK8Kaa	eugh how annoying!<br>  dont text him for a while, and wait for him to get in contact with you. if he really loves you as a friend, he will do!      x|`|Iptnp2zCaa	Sounds like he's lost interest honey.  The more you chase him, the more he's going to ignore you.  It may be hard, but leave him alone and see what he does with it...
XZbYHcHiaa	Becoming friends intending to become more than friends is always suicide bcos you lose the level of comfort between friends, if the relationship doesn't work out. it's gonna be a little weird. Tell him to maintain friendship, not a close friendship but  the one where you can just talk to one another without going weak in the knees. Eventually it'll settled down.|`|bPDrN9NTaa	This is like the same problem I have. There is a boy that I like and when were both online i wait for him to write to me but he never does. We used to talk all the time but I don't wanna start the conversation. Lol. Anyways back to your question... you should probably talk to him first because you never know when it might be too late. I should be doing that too but im just too shy to :(<br>  <br>  Try it.|`|YsNDkPd4aa	i'm so sorry text him on his cellphone see if he  responds|`|UxbjvAaRaa	that sounds like a hard situation. :D<br>  well; i would message him about it, but be natuaral and don't just be like<br>  'Do you hate me now?' Be more like 'Are we still friends?'<br>  mhm; and if he doesn't reply then i would give it timee.
IcUsSPeUaa	First of all, I'm 15.<br>  Secondly, I've never had a girlfriend.<br>  Third, You're not ugly at all. I think you're really pretty, you definitely don't have to worry about being ugly.<br>  <br>  Here are some qualities that will without a doubt make you look even more attractive:<br>  Confidence<br>  Trustworthy<br>  Dependable<br>  Romantic<br>  Easy to talk to<br>  Open-minded<br>  A good listener<br>  Drug free (Not sure why, but I think drug free girls are among the sexiest out there. Virgins are hot too, not because I want to be their first, because they don't give themselves away to just anyone.)<br>  Kind<br>  Non-judgemental<br>  Thoughtful<br>  Loving<br>  Considerate<br>  <br>  These qualities aren't necessary, but it helps<br>  <br>  Being smart<br>  Funny<br>  Talented<br>  Cute (the way you act, and I guess the way you look. Again, it's not necessary)|`|JpyjecHuaa	Aww your pretty, <br>  dont worry, <br>  you be you and hell come on his own<br>  and do you know who you want to ask you out ?
1KajpBdaaa	well if u told the person to stop doin that and they keep doing it its totally fine...i use that method sometimes...cept i threaten them first after i tell to to stop it...<br>  (>'-')>|`|XYBHM8aSaa	Sure, just kick him in the nads.  I bet that will teach him to bow down to your highness.|`|ML4oQ8tuaa	violence is usually not the answer<br>  despite what some idiots will probably tell you, just make sure that you are serious when you tell this "someone" that their actions really do piss you off and you want nothing more than for them to stop them.<br>  just be as serious as you can without being overly agitated or angry.<br>  if they do not stop those actions, truly, id say to get on with your life and find someone better than that, because true friends listen to each other and respect each others wishes.<br>  Good Luck|`|G32X9fnZaa	No violence is not ok.They might not come near you again 'cos they think you are dangerous.Shout and yell and cuss if you like but what's the point of blacking their eye?You will end up with no friends and probably in a lot of trouble with the law.I wonder how you would feel if you pissed someone off with a comment and they beat the crap out of you.
uPbTsr9eaa	Yes, lol!|`|gij21Eyhaa	yes when sometims when i talk or see <br>  beautiful girls like you kris baby.|`|0mSpQjzCaa	sure makes it even spicier the next time too. :)|`|AA10784260	yes i sure do even years later it stays with me
4e5b3604525939a6fa0e40c9b5f5bf7aaa	No need for u to plan, when u call her she'll tell u where, when and how....need i say that she doesn't like you or isn't it clear. When a girl behaves in such a manner i must say she's sexually active and all she wants is to feel what you'll feel like inside of her. She wants to know whether to use u for pleasure or if it would be a waste of time.|`|19a16fd526f17ef5281ba84b9310daa2aa	She is so going to use you! any girl with a little respect for herself, her body, and the guys emotions she's playin with would never in a million years do that until ya'll had been datin at least 4 or 5 months. obviously she is after only one thing, and that's what she grabbed. Believe it or not girls are after that one thing at that age too. I'd say call her, date her, but definately don't f*** her until ya'll have dated a few months, if she can't stick around that long she ain't worth it. Dang sluts in this world!|`|Dc4Bsjo2aa	Do you really wanna be with someone who is that easy!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I know i wouldnt|`|NZjnMKXAaa	sounds like a whore.<br>  don't date her.|`|RYiSYJvTaa	Wow. I don't like this girl at all. Your in school kissing-which you shount be- and she grabed your-----. I can't believe this. Oh my gosh this is serious. You shoult go out with people like this! This should not even be asked on Yahoo! questions! :/<br>  ~Grossed out~|`|esj8o2Uqaa	Sounds like she wants to do stuff.<br>  i dont know her so i cant say it will last long,<br>  take her to the movies for some grabbing hah :)|`|uuNArajfaa	She is easy. Thanks for answering mine.|`|Xsm0hZVAaa	are you on the laptop in the hallway writing this!?!?!?! Dude get your handjob!|`|oUihfXgVaa	yup she wants sex|`|y5P4dY7aaa	She is just wanting some from you she sounds like a whore sorry.|`|7THgBSvfaa	Um.. She really likes you(but it may just be physical).. She is probably no she is definitely willing to have sex with you.. So skip the first date and go straight to the bedroom...
aJFB49uNaa	LOL! well obviously she wants sex if she's that horny that she'll grab you'r **** in the middle of the hallway. She doesn't seem like the kind of girl you should be looking for a long term commitment with...she seems like she wants you to take advantage. Go ahead if you want, invite her round your house when its free, but use protection|`|MxHRjPFHaa	she just does not want you but she wants it also....<br>     call her up now..and have her meet you somewhere nobody ever goes then get it on...if she wants it give it to her|`|nJ4WnSKAaa	well... it's pretty obvious what she wants... as you've already pointed out<br>  <br>  She wants to get laid. <br>  It doesn't sound like you two have been dating, if at all not very long. so if you're lookin for a relationship.... dude don't be delusional<br>  <br>  <br>  from what i gather in your short story here, she wants some ***, and that's it<br>  <br>  sorry, hun|`|wi6mkT30aa	Wow that's sad shes doing all that and you two arent even dating! Yicks! Sounds like a bad deal to me! That's degrading and disgusting that she's doing tht. What a turn off!
Bu2asnXFaa	Love|`|jdah4ZA2aa	love, of course<br>  <br>  but, i'll be honest, i had an ongoing friends with benefits once where neither of us developed any feelings (that almost NEVER happens) and it was nice in its own way because nobody was every worried or insecure feeling.|`|S0K6OqGJaa	only been with one guy and i married him so love<br>  <br>  before we were married and having sex he would always tell me how great it was with me over his other relationships bc he was in love|`|PY51kBTjaa	since my ast relationship (6 months ago) i have been out having one nightstands solid for the past four months and all i can say is am now sick of them and just want someone to love|`|fox5a3ePaa	True lurve|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Love every time.  You can have love and lust together and that is what makes a good relationship|`|X6gz0qKLaa	love, of course<br>  anyone who has truly been in love will say the same|`|NZZ8q6Ytaa	True Love it is the best you can get.
vQ8NPLzLaa	it could be love but maybe she just loves you so much she is afraid she will lose you that's why she is always nagging probably.|`|AA11363680	Only if you still love someone that you don't trust any more.<br>  <br>  In a new relationship, without trust, you can't love someone. You can like them, and lust after them, but that last step to actual love requires trust.|`|FRFryWDfaa	no it's not love and if your not flirting i would get out of the relationship as it wont work if she is going to be like that all the time.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Yeah you can love but it isn't quite the same feeling of security of she feels that way.|`|hLozB0MUaa	no but you shouldn't be flirting with other girls, it's not right|`|Wju7rLSSaa	Well all i can say is<br>  ::it will b a firkin nightmare""<br>  sorry but true..i defo think that there has to b a big trust roll in love<br>  otherwise, how can you truly love the other an open up, if u don't trust that person..<br>  <br>  if someone dont trust you but there is no reason, then that is there crap<br>  an insecurities an not much you can do if u have already tryed, so best to walk away, cause no trust," no working loving relationship"<br>  THATS JUST HOW IT WORKS OUT, IF ALL ELSE FAILS!<br>  <br>  or get her to seek professional help an hey..maby good start to stop flirting if you are ! ;)|`|uM8O5Q5maa	No you can't.<br>  Express to her that she can trust you and don't flirt with other girls in front of her... unless she's obsessively jealous, then she's just insecure and probably not worth your time.|`|ze4Gt1araa	No I don't call it love. <br>  <br>  But if she says your flirting is because maybe she saw you and besides trust is earned not given so try to gain her trust again and stop flirting maybe she'll stop.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck!|`|cOBsDBgqaa	nope you cant.<br>  she may think that you like her a lot and got it confused with love<br>  love is a over used and sayed thing.<br>  if you arent flirting then dot worry about it.<br>  just ignore her and dont talk to her.|`|TDmj9Wsfaa	No, there isn't love without trust. Maybe there could be if you stopped flirting with others.|`|vkPlX2Y4aa	NO, it's not love.|`|PNI7dMfqaa	No mate|`|BdeoYKokaa	Aint no such thang. It's all BS. Love stinks|`|Ftz9UWPEaa	no, but are u flirting with other girls?<br>  bc it seems like you are from the "but anyways" response...|`|Tf19RETiaa	noooo ?
sRKO8s6jaa	Yes you are. You're lucky you are starting to get over your shyness at 14. I am getting out of my shyness but I am 18. I feel I have missed out on my years of being young =/.|`|gnCiGSjbaa	Sounds like it to me. School activities and clubs are a great way to meet people. Best of luck to you!
s1leABaSaa	I dressed up in a playboy bunny outfit and tied my bf to the bed posts and took advantage of him =] this was for his 19th last week|`|tbKoPNbDaa	i gave my guy a rly good bl*w job on his birthday. but i give him those a lot. i would suggest a strip tease, a lap dance, and like tie him down and give him head while fingering him in the butt|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Give him great head!|`|X4U36dHzaa	give him the whole shabang!|`|RoTLnFGZaa	you know what would be totally awesome!<br>  buy him a polo, like from american eagle or something, and then YOU wear it and take naughty, teasing pics for him.<br>  or tell him you gotta suprise & come out with just the shirt on and high heels.
3b352647c1451744c77be95b0723c695aa	Well, you obviously need to talk things through so you can decide exactly where your relationship is going.<br>  You seem to try and punish each other by ignoring each other when something goes wrong, you cut all communication. Well, that's debilitating and alienating. <br>  You need to talk to each other, get pass your anger and frustration and get over that bad habit as all it seems to create is confusion and pain. <br>  Decide once and for all which way you want to go and give it a proper go or let go and move on with your lives.|`|8ZulIY84aa	In my opinion, he was cheating on you. Don't answer the phone. Don't talk to him at all. DON"T meet him. DON"T SLEEP WITH HIM AGAIN. Go and get checked for STDs.<br>  <br>  You deserve better, honey. Good luck!|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	Trouble is the only time that happened to me was when it was my x that was doing the cheating & blaming me for it.  I found out in the end & he's lucky to be alive!|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	What?|`|mQhSxCpoaa	He's was probably cheating on you. Now he's 'on-the-side' isn't on the side, or maybe he had a flash of guilt and wants to get back with you. Especially if you were as good to him as you sound.<br>  By the way, just because you wouldn't have sex with him, doesn't mean that he knows that. He could be booty-calling you, thinking that you might actually fall for it and do it with him.|`|SHanivxvaa	Iam not saying that hes cheating but it is true that when people have guilt in there mind because they are sleeping with someone else and they can,t express the guilt it,s all a matter of time until they let out there frustration and when they do it is by accusing there girlfriend/boyfriend of cheating specially if he doesn't have any reason for accusing you|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	Typical. He wants out but does not want to be the bad guy. Wants sympathy from his friends etc. Go ahead. Give him the boot so he can feel sorry for himself. You have better things to do with your life then deal with this fool.|`|wi6mkT30aa	When he calls back be like "Why are you even bothering to call me" Be upset and show him your mad and you dont accept bull sh!t like that.<br>  <br>  A few weeks of not calling? No thank you I wouldn't even bother with him ever again!
RluCMVUSaa	I am pretty private as well.  My city and that stuff is not a big deal to me to give out, but then I also know that when you google me I am not the first hits that you get so in my size city it would be hard to narrow down who I am exactly.  I would give some of my contacts a picture or personal info because I have known them long enough to trust them, but overall trust must be earned so I am with you on being private simply because there are weird people in the world.  <br>  <br>  I do have the double standard though as I enjoy when people are overly open on here because it is interesting, better them than me.|`|LDv4dqLraa	It depends on the relationship that you have built up with this person over a period of time and your ability to assess whether or not you feel the person is genuine and can be trusted. Now I know that there are freaks out there who use the internet but not everybody is a freak.<br>  <br>  Lets face it, how many times have you gone on a date with someone that you don't really know? How many times have you opened the front door without knowing who is on the other side?  How many times have you stepped into the road without looking first? <br>  <br>  It's a question of exercising reasonable care - that's about the best you can do to steer you way through life without living life just to exist.|`|rPywKtJRaa	I guess those that would have a pic of me should be considered trust worthy.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	because I don't want to end up on those "missing" milk cartons.|`|TT0rCi8kaa	I have done, and I think that if you use your discretion, (if you have any)<br>  then no harm can come of it. Anyway, I have fronted down lots of really scary people, in real life, from Hells Angels, to street muggers with knives, and never come to any harm, so I'm sure that anyone I give details to, online, can't really do me any harm. And I'm quite discerning anyway, and trust my own judgement more than any scare stories about online threats. Anyway, what is the worst that can happen? Its the Internet.|`|dprURFLxaa	If you're underage and can't pick out the freaks from the norm then probably not a good idea.  If you have good discernment and you're just having fun then what's the harm in a picture.  It's not like people don't have them posted on every photo sharing site, peer sharing network, myspace, facebook, and everywhere else.  I don't use my real name or email address or anything like that.  It's not like sending a few photos or talking about the weather in your city (unless it's small) will give people your exact GPS location.  Besides...when I start to make online friends I like to know who I'm actually talking to...putting a real face to an avatar...<br>  <br>  ** edit **<br>  <br>  Martin - nice with the source reference...lol...|`|v1tHjJ3haa	cause I live out of the US and I live where it's like really unknown, jk, I shock myself, lol, but never any personnal like adress # phone # full name  or anything like that! That's an open door for creeps to stalk me, and I don't want that! Oh I'm 17 btw|`|ba4R1tf1aa	I would, too.<br>  But just close friends.<br>  Or really, really hot strangers.<br>  Just in case I score....<br>  <br>  Hi, stranger! Wanna swap pics?<br>  *pinches BE's bottom, whoever she is*|`|qvW5ZYruaa	How personal are we talking? Cause i have no trouble telling you people that the little toe on my left foot has no nail. I dropped a bowling ball in my foot and BAM! it's gone.|`|VkzmH1GKaa	People can do anything now with just a little information about someone. Caution is a good thing.|`|u70TaWI5aa	I won't give personal info out but since they know my name they can find me on myspace. I mean if you put stuff out there that already has your info then, it is your fault in a way.|`|qdPtCBJeaa	I guess it depends...like Scoundy said....and just what kind of info are we talking about? ...and what kind of pics......c'mon...Jj name names....are they nekkid??.... you have inside info.....do tell|`|TNlSOr35aa	hiya!!!<br>  i would never do it, but then again some people are so soft they think there's nothing wrong with the world. But some people tend to do it for the attention<br>  I just wouldn't give my personal info online to anyone<br>  DONT DO IT PEOPLE!!!!!<br>  xxxx|`|ruu9Wdrkaa	i would never do it. people just have low self esteem. i kinda have that but i would never post a picture of myself.|`|Gza8jaboaa	i would never do it. its basically cause they are desperate and need attention. cause they ahve low self esstem.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	As a guy I'm not particularly worried about it.  I also don't suggest to people that they give me photos or personal information.  That would warn them off.  If they do, cool.

And muffin tops are disgusting. So don't be roll out over your apple bottom jeans.<br>  <br>  But a little cushion for the pushin is never a bad thing.|`|wYK4Ye2Daa	i dont even notice that stuff.  Sometimes it might be cute if i do notice|`|JCdBSULraa	We honestly don't notice.
155bc8c47b6ea8173ed60e21cb549f5eaa	my best advise is figure out who he is and where to find him (look on myspace or something if he doesn't go to school with you) It might be too late now but you definitely like him and from the sounds of it he liked you. If you become friends with him then you could find out so much easier. Even if he has a girlfriend now. you dreaming about him isn't really so much of because you really like him or he's "the One" but it could be because it bugs you so much that he might like you or that he was staring at you for so long so yeah check to see if he has a myspace and just send him a message saying "hey I saw you on her and you looked familiar, did you go camping at this place in june?" he might remember you and add you just don't let him know you searched all over for him that might be kind of creepy to him.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope I helped|`|6h0eCVwpaa	Yeah maybe he likes you, maybe not. It seems like he liked you and he was trying to make you jealous when he started to talk with that girl....but boys are different i'm sorry but there is a big possibility that he forgot about you..it's 50-50 %...And maybe you seeing him in your dreams means that you think about him a lot and you are becoming kinda obsessed. Ok maybe you love him, i don't know how are you really feeling but from my personal experience i can tell you that there were many times when i thought i was like in love but when i really truly fell in love i see how wrong i was before. Just try to forget him, have fun with friends, watch tv, listen to music, look at some cute guys...or find yourslef a celebrity crush(just don't get too obsessed with them either coz it will be hard lol) and you should forget him. And who knows maybe when you least expect it you will seem him again someday :)<br>  <br>  P.S You are kinda like me. I do the same thing when i like a guy i think about all the details...how many times he looked at me, did he smile, was he looking at other girls lol....<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Coming from a guy's perspective, I think you should approach up to him and introduce yourself since that he was a bit shy from the story.|`|z6BSkn3Baa	Yes, by the sounds of it i think he's a bit shy as he walked away from you when your friends came over. He probably waiting for you to ask him out so try it. You only live once remember!!!|`|8nF5YjyYaa	I think your stupidity could be the more promising candidate in this case. You seem like a deplorably vacuous wretch.|`|eKeWnkguaa	it sounds like u like him and it sounded like he liked you.  and ur not being stupid but u were abit stupid for not talking to him|`|AL4Q6Agraa	Well seems like a shy, mysterious sort of guy. <br>  Sometimes people just can't stop looking at another person, and they have no idea why (or maybe they're just good to look at lol :)) but there is like some sort of intense connection or chemistry you know?, that makes you want to know more about the other person.<br>  <br>  People also may stare at another person, when say, dreaming about something else.They are just looking at them because there easy on the eyes, while they dream, lol I think so anyway, although they look away in embarrassment once they realise (which didn't happen with him)...so hmm...<br>  <br>  People also look at someone and just generally judge their behaviour, it might not mean they like you, or otherwise.<br>   <br>  I say just forget about him for now, it will be easier that way. Maybe next time you meet, someday, you should definetly say hi, and start a conversation.:) (But if you still can't, once you've tried to forget, then find out who he is). <br>  <br>  hope it helped :)|`|8bVoZGTYaa	Yes he does like you. Alot. Like a sudden crush.<br>  Everyone loooks at someone for a reason and his is because he likes you. Why would he do it so often. If you like some one do you look at them?? i know i do! If he is talking about bums etc thats quite sexual meaning something...Make sure you try and make him realise you like him too before the chance slips away!
AA12321514	You should all talk to your parents about this. Ask them what will happen to us?  There are small fights between every couple but that does not mean they split apart.|`|LPgYKc3Kaa	I think you should talk to your mom and dad, and let them know you are scared just like they are.  No matter who you live with, remember that they both love you, just show it in different ways.  Talk to your siblings and let them know your concerns, you probably will find out, they are just as confused as you are.|`|XW91gFikaa	So...are you being forced to make a decision on which parent you live with or something?   Obvious choice is your mother.  Why would you want to live with an abusive father?    <br>  <br>  Choose your mom and visit with your dad on occasion.|`|8s94YE9haa	its all up to the courts to decide who you go to. it blows, been threw it before. but yea there might be a huge custody battle. so bear with it in the mean time. hope it works out|`|AFjehuZ5aa	It depends on what your parents decide on or what the attorneys ask for. The judge will choose the childrens best intrest.|`|UatcpQjraa	go wit the dad thats hits you... smart...? you know what to do... why you askin
jgU4g6kGaa	Well if you wanted to check him out you could of made it a little more discreet.  Sitting that close and staring isn't exactly a good thing to do especially in front of the gf.  Any girl is going to get upset if another girl is checking out her man and making it obvious as it seems you were.  Next time don't sit so close and admire from a distance. Just think...what would you do? Especially if your bf was looking back at the girl?|`|x7CmpR6baa	What was wrong with her?<br>  what is wrong with you!<br>  When you think a guy is cute and keep looking and smiling at him, its called flirting!<br>  You knew he wasn't single and you upset that girl.<br>  Your one of those boyfriend stealers aren't you?<br>  <br>  and yes i would care, your lucky that girl just shouted at you, i would have done much worse.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Well "staring" will make almost anyone uncomfortable.|`|i5jNl2Cuaa	Yes. It's called eye-f^^^^ing. The 1st step of flirting. If a guy was eye banging my gf I'd be mad too.<br>  <br>  creep|`|67yVH8maaa	First of all you have no right to stare at another girls man....to look at is fine but to be drooling over is another. She had every right to get pissed at you! If I caught you staring at my husband i'd be much worse then what it seemed this other girl was! Your lucky some girls would knock you out. Yea your just looking at a boy but in all reality it's someone else's boy!|`|64X5RxRbaa	Imagine someone starting at YOUR husband - would you like it? ...i don't think so!<br>  <br>  You don't understand that even a mere stare could give that guy the wrong impression. You don't know what people think in their minds. Not everyone is so innocent.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Yes its wrong! Have some respect he is taken. You sound like a creeper because you sat close to them to stare at him come on now its just a guy & he is taken off limits! Would you care if someone did that to you and your bf?|`|oMna3EOnaa	yer your looking and thats fine but you can't do it in front of the gf and be so blatant because its upsetting for her, she was obv gettin jealous and thats y she came too talk to you.

DVJu1er2aa	dont listen to the first three answers, they wont work.<br>  <br>  What u should do is like accidentally bump into her and help her pick things up and like start a conversation.  dont complement her body or anything like that.  But before u do anything get some non-stalkerish backround info in a noworkn-stalkerish way.<br>  <br>  Im super-sorry if that doesnt work|`|Ty4miOmKaa	Don't say anything about her body.  That is sooooo over done and cliche'.  Seriously, you're in a gym, she probably hears that a lot.  Do something to set yourself apart, try to notice something about her that could lead to another conversation. "You have a nice ***" is ridiculous and stalkeresque.  If you can't think of anything else its ok to compliment her work ethic, but trod lightly.<br>  <br>  Unless, of course, she's a ho-bag. :o)|`|maNrDAIAaa	First off, when you approach her make sure it looks like you have accually worked out so she doesnt think you are some creepy person who goes to the gym just to check out chicks.<br>  <br>  when you approach her, ask her how long shes been going to the gym and start a conversation based off of small talk. <br>  <br>  if she's not interested, move on. you dont want to look desperate.|`|a55c24f1dd0dab9bef4e763156dfd053aa	First of all, you can't talk to her cuz she has a nice butt. Second, just talk to her, be like 'hey' or something. talk to her as shes leaving or something cuz some people think its rude to interupt their workout, but run up to her and tell her how impressive she was at working out on something!|`|ce4DZs0maa	Well get on a treadmill beside her pretend you're done reading a magazine and offer it to her to read.|`|5HECRgcMaa	tell you you think she is hot|`|iv5O5J2Laa	Need Help?|`|ZFQMjsiaaa	eeeyyyyyy <br>  <br>  <br>  wen you gonna hit that|`|hOWNwpCLaa	Leave her alone.  I doubt she would appreciate knowing that guys check out her butt, while she works out.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	ask her if she needs help working her glutes.|`|AA11660242	Just go up and ask her if she can help you with your lifting technique. Start doing whatever exercise she's doing, then ask her if she thinks you're doing it right. Then just take it from there. Good luck!|`|PNI7dMfqaa	Work out near her. If u have a sik body take your top off and flex!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  If not just say hey and occasional give a friendly wink :')|`|FSMpMA9saa	well just go over by her and workout too.. <br>  or as if you can buy her a protein drink..|`|lYjweuZmaa	HEY BABE...

A7nIADxgaa	Agree with the guy who said you were disgusting. It's people like you that makes guys look like bastards. I wish you'll get hurt as mush as you hurt your wife, but that may not happen because your a cold-hearted bastard. <br>  <br>  <br>  You may say you don't understand why people answer you **** and all, but that's only because it's what your worth.|`|XJSOToRGaa	Only one I know of is ashleymadison.com<br>  <br>  I would strongly urge you to reconsider your decision, however, as getting caught cheating is bad, bad mojo.<br>  <br>  Best of luck in whatever you decide.|`|JCdBSULraa	You're disgusting.|`|06e3b455c42895168ee7096710ade50daa	WOW UR A DER DER DER DONT CHEAT!!!!!!!!!!|`|JpyjecHuaa	FIND SOMEONE SINGLE WTF<br>  DONN CHEATT|`|1qTNn8qnaa	Omg...go get a divorce and stop hurting ur spouse...mental retard!!...google search it if ur that desperate!!
JCdBSULraa	Women are just less loyal than men.  It's just the way it is.  When a guy is going out with a girl, the guy's friends wouldn't even consider hooking up with that girl, but the girl's friends will do everything in their power to tempt the guy to cheat on their own friend.   <br>  <br>  Usually they lose interest after their friend breaks up with the guy, but sometimes they get confused and think they actually liked the guy.   Women's minds are scary places, I'd advise to stay out of them.
K9i2dPdiaa	hi, hmmm dating questions. i know its hard to approach people when there doing something, i get nervous asking someone for directions never mind flirting. But if i was a male and wanted to try dating first thing i would do is build up my confidence. after that i would probably approach girls that i have seen around a few times, i dont believe in asking strangers out because you dont know who they are. im not great on dating advice but thats a few tips for you. <br>  <br>  best of luck xx|`|hNWAlLwoaa	I think you should flirt with others|`|8gbKvqsSaa	just become good 4ends with a girl that u like then bam go 4 it|`|Di9GMJ05aa	I'd say try other things and get out. Eventually you'll meet someone. Even if it's while you're going for a little walk or bowling. Something will work out though  :)|`|Wvj6o1XZaa	Hm. Well maybe you should try something COMPLETELY different, like start hanging out at a coffee shop, or the library, and try to connect with girls based on intellectual concepts?
qBz0ZfzFaa	I know how you feel. It is super hard waiting for somebody special. I am 30 years old and still haven't found him yet. I'm still waiting for him...you can do it too! Don't settle for anything less than somebody who will love and treasure you and be your soulmate! God wants us to be happy...maybe there is a reason you are waiting. Maybe the one who's right for you needs some more life experiences before they are ready for you. I believe God has a reason for everything. Don't worry, enjoy your life, find fulfillment in developing your mind and your talents, and the waiting time can be fun.|`|teFKJflZaa	when i was 18 i was the same, id hadn't even had my 1st kiss, then one night at a friends party i meet this guy, not much of a looker but we talked for 8 hours Straight, just the 2 of us. i felt such a connection. we meet a few more times and in the end he asked me out. dating him was so fun and easy,like we had known each Other for years. now 6 years down the line were getting married. god has that perfect person for you, hes just trying to set up the perfect moment for you to meet so you ll have something to tell the grand kids, hehe|`|JCdBSULraa	I'm 25, christian, I've dated a couple times, but nothing ever beyond a second date, so I've never had a GF, never even kissed a girl.  And none of this is from a lack of trying.  I know several other guys like myself as well.  As a woman, you'll find a lot of guys looking for someone like you, so I don't think you have much to worry about.|`|7edl5u1oaa	I can 100% relate to you. You know why? Because i was 23 when i first met my boyfriend. He is the only person I've ever dated! I felt the same way but I listened when everyone told me to wait on God and to keep praying. My whole family is christian and they didn't want me--and neither did i--to end up with the wrong person! Keep up the good work and i'll be praying God sends you that special someone!
A5L3eBXxaa	I am so sorry to hear about that! Listen I am going to answer your question but first to let you know that it is possible to die from a broken heart. Your heart cant take it sometimes and gets cracks in it. Listen  do something that you love. Splurge on yourself! Wait a few days and see if he comes around. ask someone else to talk to him for you. If he ignores  you then you are much to good for him. Take it one day at a time and Good luck!|`|tz5nwLhwaa	You need to get HELP right now. Don't off yourself, it's now worth it. I was having trouble in my family and I thought I couldn't stand it anymore so I tried to end it. Luckily I had second thoughts before it was too late and called 911. After that I sought help and everything worked out with medication and therapy.

I want to take it away from them so bad and it's so hard to see them like that. =( It maks me cry sometimes.|`|8Zk3t6yAaa	Ofcourse...there are plenty of people in this world that I wish I could take their pain away wether it be physical or mental. I would do it for people I don't know as well it's just the type of person I am.|`|aKgoo8Yoaa	N-O|`|xGofrX5Iaa	My girlfriend was in a wreck and has severe back pain.

nfSZPpAHaa	I was talking to this really cute guy in my class, I had a huge crush on him and I left the room to get something, came back and I got youtube up. Completely forgetting that lad could see me I started singing along to my favourite song pouting, shaking my hair and battering my eye lashes up close!<br>  So cringey!<br>  He was just like "umm..kat?" and I just turned cam off immediately and went straight offline!<br>  Haven't spoken to him in a while now..<br>   :)|`|mIj8hXGNaa	They recorded it and posted it on the internet and now I am divorced and lost my job.

I ended up dancing naked on cam and singing loudly to it... it was a video call :[<br>  He found it hysterical. Atleast it was my boyfriend :/<br>  <br>  Another time was when I was really ill. And I picked a massive Bogey out of my nose and snot came dribbling down XD THE HORROR!|`|IxR6Akpwaa	I once killed 3 people with an axe and dismembered their bodies before I realised that I had left the webcam on.

I always make sure my webcam is off before getting off my computer.
e9dHHGCSaa	He likes your voice, and maybe he can't text. If you really worry about that, you should get over it.|`|QRXMsxdMaa	Maybe he never checks his messages. Maybe he doesn't want someone else in the room to hear the message you might leave.|`|rO8P0NH3aa	www.goaskcarla.com|`|ruczpWrGaa	maybe he just doesn't like using messenger or texting.  some people don't.  or if its on messenger maybe hes not at his computer at the moment.|`|xwNgEhKCaa	maybe he likes to hear your voice

Get a paternity test, it's the only way.|`|2ySf3Kaaaa	I really wouldn't be to worried about it. The dates don't add up right. If they broke up in September and haven't had sex since then her due date would be sometime in June of 09. Pregnancy lasts 9 months normally unless a premature baby. September to August is 11 months so there is really no possible way it could be his unless you don't know and he could have had intercourse with her after September. Hope I could help.

uBssj3Znaa	If the friendship isn't beneficial to you and you don't really feel like you two are friends then I wouldn't end the friendship, I would just stop asking her to hang out. I would also not help her with any school work. Don't write her off completely though. <br>  <br>  Also, I love your avatar!|`|25mfL9UXaa	Yes! She's only taking advantage of you and she would only want to be friends with you only if you could benefit her life. Ditch her, trade her in, do something but don't keep her!!
2lqqRcMvaa	Probably. He probably said no to your friend because he doesn't feel that you like him. Ask him yourself, by yourself, when you are alone with him. If you're with friends, he might feel more pressured to say yes. You don't want him to say something he doesn't really mean. Yeah, its going to be hard, but maybe you'll be glad you did it. <br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  If he doesn't like you, its not the end of the world. Don't keep obsessing over him forever. Move on to other guys, and maybe he'll reconsider.|`|JoU7WTadaa	Sounds like it. But the best way to find out is to cut the junior high drama, and straight up ask him if he likes you. Maybe he's to afraid to tell you, and you have to get the fire started by telling him that YOU like HIM. <br>  <br>  Man that's a lot of pronouns lol.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	you can't be crushing on someone unless you are fat|`|IDnIo7wYaa	it sounds like he likes you.<br>  flirt with him!|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	yeah i think he like you do for it and it turns out wrong blame him it always works when you blame it on them|`|zH7VuQhtaa	Its not science! So obvious he likes you girl. :) Ask him out. Make the first move.
2keIEMFUaa	You are just to cute LOL! Why don't you send her some flowers and let her know that you respect her wishes and when she is ready to start dating that you would love to take her out some time and give her your number and let her know that whenever she is ready or needs to talk with someone that your just a phone call a way...|`|cgQrQSvDaa	it sure sounds like you are yes.|`|4Vlq5hzSaa	Well It Sure Sounds Like That!|`|Q8YHZ5g8aa	Maybe. It's hard to say if you are just infatuated with her or if you really love her. Love is something that can't be described, you just know when you are in love.|`|ruczpWrGaa	firstly like and love are 2 very different things. you sound infatuated more than anything else.|`|sCCjAKllaa	You are in love with her. Now you need to tell her and see where it goes from there.|`|sY8F5cytaa	it sounds like it! lolz!|`|U3tZzGlgaa	You definitely have a crush on her, but you won't know if it's love until you really get to know what kind of person that she really is.  When you find out about all her bad qualities, (possibly including things like having bad breath, being lazy, is a slob, picks her nose, always watches television, etc. ) and you find that you still want to be with her and take care of her, then you'll know that it's love.|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	I think the fact that you are asking the question, tells you that you are not. When you are in love, then you just know. But seeming as you definetly like her that much, all you can do is be there for her, and when she's ready to move on, then try asking her out. Good luck xx|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Love doesnt happen overnight. Infatuation does. <br>  <br>  Still, give her some time and be a good friend. Eventually if she is interested she'll be happy to date you. After dating for a couple years then you can call it love.|`|SouPhkgxaa	Yes,<br>  you really love her because you want to make her happy,<br>  also because you think about her alot =]|`|jsgKGtdBaa	Chuck Norris|`|UGyrxDHvaa	yeah, smell the roses, your in love boy.|`|dYqC3s10aa	si<br>  because think about her all the time<br>  duhhhhhhhhh.......|`|mPuBm8Hxaa	I would say that you care for her deeply, but I wouldn't call it "love" just yet.  All in all, be there for her as a friend.  Respect how she feels towards you.  If she is not ready to be in that kind of relationship with you then give her time and space.  Also realize that there is a possibility that you two may never be a couple--I'm not saying for you to give up, but realize all the possibilities.  Whatever you do respect her and what she wants.  If you find that she does not like you in the same way you must distance yourself from her and distract yourself with other things.|`|maNrDAIAaa	An Honest answer to your question is No.<br>  <br>  You have only known her for two months. Love takes time and effort in a relationship. True love can not be measured. Try seeing yourself at the age of 80 and try to imagine her next to you then. <br>  <br>  Give it some time.<br>  I think you have potential, but love takes time.<br>  Start dating her after she gains closure from her past relationship.<br>  Once you start to get to know her better, reflect on your feelings and decide if what you have with her is true love.|`|hG58emVDaa	Exactly that's what love is :) I wish you luck because this will be the greatest think which could ever happen in your life.However If you have some problems and never have the relationship you want dont get depressed :) You will have another chance :) Such a disapointment can ruin a year of your life ;) Never allow some ***** make you unhappy :)|`|s3nvzvZCaa	well i believe love is not a feeling but more along the lines when you are willing to what is best for her even if it doesnt effect you in a good way but being happy because she is happy. And it sounds like thats what you want so i would say yes you haven fallin in love!|`|ju5hVva8aa	u will kno as u get 2 kno her better. but as the looks of it, itz jus alot of attraction. start talking 2 her more. b supportive. let her know tht even tho she likes u, and she doesnt wanna b in a relationship rite now, u will wait 4 her 2 b ready 2 try and b with u. <br>  jus make sure she knows ur not going anywhere. <br>  <br>  good luck !|`|8oPVcYSyaa	Yes, Yes u r.

And of course she doesn't want to be in a relationship with anybody else because she just got out of one and you can't just rush back into a relationship with someone else because you wouldn't want anybody to get hurt in the end because they could possibly get back together or they could still have feelings for each other and work things out so you never know.|`|io1cRt87aa	OMG you sound so falling in love!<br>  its amazing how women think men are heartless when we have men like you out there. i believe you are falling in love with her but maybe not love yet...<br>  give her space and let her breath but let her no you are there for her if she needs you....she will come to you trust me!|`|SR1FN2nqaa	sounds like it to me. just give her some time to get over her ex and see what happens. you dont want to get with someone on the rebound . at least she knows you want to be with her so when she is ready im sure she will let you know.|`|WrxWg9s9aa	i think you do(in love with her ) just tell her have you feel about

unVj43Xxaa	He probably likes you as well and knows you like him. Sounds like he is trying to see what he can get away with. As in, can he mess around with you and keep the girlfriend. You could ask him if he has feelings for you but because there's a gf I'd put him out of your mind until they break up. Which they will eventually, if he's trying to get the attention of other girls.|`|gqvvXknQaa	That's sweet he;s being nice, but if you don't want to deal with it and don't want to be hurt, just try to avoid him and get past the pain.|`|dVlLahozaa	Maybe he is just friendly and wants to get to know you better|`|Ix2eWrswaa	maybe he likes you jus doesnt know if you like him back so he is goin wit some other girl|`|2Ed16eKCaa	How long has he been going out with this other girl???

He doesn't seem like the player-type and it's not like he broke up with his girlfriend for you. I think he just wants to be friends. Don't be hurt. Start liking another guy though.|`|XJSOToRGaa	Since when did having a girlfriend prevent a guy from being friends with a girl?<br>  <br>  I have lots of female friends and I'm married...my wife similarly has plenty of male friends.

Laugh because if they are calling you that and you didn't do anything to them, then they sound like idiots. Really just laugh. and when most people call you a wh0re they are just immature because they haven't gotten anywhere with any guys. LAUGH ;)

3PiIh7Qiaa	first the meeting the cousin not really that big.<br>  and two depending on the incident, if it was kissing hugging sex yes you have a big problem that you probably wont be able to fix, but it sounds like he thinks you are interested in his cousin which is a bad thing it makes it feel like he has blood competition.<br>  <br>  if he still calls you then you might still have a shot|`|l0P1OsdYaa	IF u meet his cousin it can just be like meeting his friends..Once u meet his parents and aunts then you can talk about being a bit more serious!|`|NdexDGXWaa	dunno|`|0mSpQjzCaa	parents would mean more,  not good about the cousin though.|`|HSbcscbuaa	tell u the truth i realy dont know|`|1hciyvKdaa	He regrets it since somehting happend and he feels guilty that it happend. Its not significant to meet other members of the family , only the parents and grandparents.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	means nuthin' till you meet his folks.<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	I think it depends.  My boyfriend and I are planning on getting married, so we definitely have feelings for each other.  But I've met his mom once (at a funeral) and probably would not have met her otherwise because she lives several states away.  His cousin, however, lives about 3 hours away so we know each other pretty well.  Plus, my boyfriend and his cousin are very close, pretty much best friends.  That is significant.  And the fact that I haven't spent much time with his mom doesn't really have any bearing on how my boyfriend views our relationship.  So take that into consideration.  I will say though that the older a guy gets, the more important you are to him if you meet his parents.<br>  <br>  I don't know what "situation" you're referring to with the cousin, so it's not easy to answer.  I'd say if he's still talking to you, he still likes you.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Meeting the family does not have the significance that it did years ago.  These days it just means your paths crossed.  <br>  <br>  Sounds as though this relationship is either in its beginning stage or ending stage.  Don't be pushy.  Just let it develop.|`|BFGh2JHzaa	nah.... my ex. would introduce to me to every single friend so that i knew who he hanged out with and always have someone to call  and just to let me know he does care about me..<br>  <br>  hang on there!<br>  oh and we brokeup bcuz of college distance! lol<br>  <br>  much love and just keep holding on!|`|3IdfARLSaa	Only if you meet his parents,or an older female relative, not someone in his own age group.

IcUsSPeUaa	It's sound like you're good friends with him. Don't come on too strong because then you'll scare him away and he'll just say no. Hang out with him more often and eventually ask to move your relationship to a higher status.

If you don't want to hurt his feelings then just change your phone number and make sure he doesn't get it this time, and no matter what he will get his feelings hurt.  You need to tell him the true that "you do not wish for him to call you anymore and that you hope he will honor your wishes and understand" That your not trying to hurt him, but you feel that we are both going in different directions in life and there are no hard feelings.

That's completely normal for both sexes.

w1necKzYaa	It is just sibling rivalry! no biggy!|`|2wabQow8aa	If she stopped fighting and acted like she was trying to defend herself then it was. From what you've said, it doesn't sound like it was your fault. If you tossed her or threw her or something then you obviously shouldn't have done that but sometimes you just have no control of yourself.|`|UyA5Y54jaa	yea but u gotta understand that she's still a girl you should have just held her hands until she got tired of trying to free herself......
VAI6MtPIaa	Disgusting. Why would you write a book about something like this? Write about something that people would actually READ!|`|hSY0LuCOaa	I hope you have a really good editor.
Jj0zcJLwaa	Relax, it's not your colour. They're probably turned off by a more changeable attribute.|`|7M3JTnbxaa	How do you know it's your ethnicity and not something else?|`|M63kq3AYaa	1. You're unnatractive.<br>  2. You're rude. (calling people a$$holes is rude)<br>  3. You're arrogant, which is why you're assuming it's due to the colour of your skin.|`|1y1vGOpKaa	well maybe you aren't attractive, skin color aside. what do you look like? how tall are you? etc. etc. .....<br>  <br>  okay yeah, looks isnt everything, but from my impression, hes not even getting a chance to talk to them. He said when women "first see him", so I am guessing theres something wrong with his looks.|`|SR1FN2nqaa	there are lots and lots of shallow people out there. unfortunately others do judge people by the color of their skin...its racist and its ugly. dont let it get you down. hold your head up and be proud of who you are and someday the right lady will come along......good luck.|`|HIav9sVuaa	it dont sound like theres anyhting wrong with you maybe your too good for them and they know it :D<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and georgka its not about looks its about whats on the inside of a person that counts.|`|c5b488ff1d027aa50957b02bc976c5bcaa	You're probably small, frail, and weak, and come off as the type of guy who would turn to the internet to solve his problems.|`|ziZpamVuaa	They sound like b*tches, your probably better off without those girls anyway.|`|JSFCkne8aa	"I never look down on others", sounds like that is exactly what you are doing.|`|Uv7WYb33aa	obviously you look down on others if you make such broad generalizations (you said typical euro guys are assholes)
2Ed16eKCaa	I would just be honest its very normal not to have very many friends when u start a new school|`|WLj5UZoOaa	Just say i have made a some friends|`|vVvXkTH5aa	Well f u really like her then u wud tell her da truth n f she really likes u then she wouldn't care how many friends u hav n she will respect dat but f she has a problem wit dat then maybe shes not the one
p75ZEmjXaa	Yes, possibly.  For those of you reading this who squirm and want to throw stones, my wife has never initiated sex in 12 years of marriage, even though I tried to talk to her about it several times over the years.  And when I used to initiate, she would usually reject me with an excuse why not.  Then there were "rules" like only on saturday, only missionary, only in the dark, etc. etc.  It got so humiliating, frustrating, and boring.  <br>  <br>  We started going to counseling about 3 months ago.  There are very few signs of any change.  I really like and respect my wife in all other ways, but this has debilitated my life and i'm very sad and confused.  The fact that she will not discuss it and refuses to make any accomodation for what I think is a reasonable interest (ie. i'd like to be intimate with her) is frustrating beyond comprehension.  <br>  <br>  There isn't anything else I can do about it and i feel my sexual self slipping away into wasted time.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	I can visualize it happening, but realistically I know it will not. There is a difference between fantasy and reality. And reality is where I choose to stay. It is a daily decision. I have passed up opportunities to cheat, and I am so glad now that I did the right thing. There's always an excuse to cheat and always a way to get away with it. But there's also always an option to not cheat and be proud of the decision. The honest road is sometimes the most fulfilling and satisfying.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Poor choice of words. I don't think things are ever going perfect if you are cheating. its usually a sad, bad situation that you are just trying to deal with the best you can.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	In complete honesty, if the "perfect" situation presented itself EVERYONE would take it.  People do what feels good and do WHATEVER  they think they can get away with.|`|GcoED0Psaa	Though I am divorced, when I was married and there was lack of affection from my ex, the thought NEVER crossed my mind.  There is no such thing as the PERFECT situation for infidelity to present itself.|`|qBl9ShJBaa	no way i would talk to him,i have and things got better almost right away. i love my husband to much to do some thing as sneaky and wrong as that.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	no, I knew my husband was not a very affectionate person when I married him and I  accept him the way he is
q1LsPaMbaa	i don't know if she was wanting her friend to "force" you because she was throwing a suprise party.  She just hears the girl talk about you a lot or possibly that she likes. It's really kinda hard to tell because a lot of girls girlfriends like to "help out" whereever they can with guys they think or know we like.|`|rO8P0NH3aa	www.goaskcarla.com
jilEKALUaa	She probably feels very self conscious in them and hopes that you don't see her in them. To convince her otherwise is don't act any different around her just be the first to say hi to her when she has her glasses on.That way she will know that her looks are not a problem to you.|`|Tf19RETiaa	yeaa i've done that, tell her that!! she will think its sweet and be more confortable. -good luck =)|`|1pL6sg0vaa	YES! girls always try to look their best in front of the guys they like. if i were you i would tell her that she looks beautiful both ways. it might actually make her like you more. so go for it. Good Luck!
NqTi3sOtaa	i think you should say hi, how are you and have a convo before you give him your number.|`|xCfHnQBbaa	Ok, I don't want to bust your bubble or anything but remember he is a salesman and he probably says hi to every one and smiles.  If he likes you enough then he will approach you. But hey we are in 2009 so if you think you can handle rejection then go for it.  Good luck!|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	you wanna work there or sleep with this guy? Make you choice.
dPKkjK8iaa	yes totally :) i do it all the time and it is totally normal to ask kinda weird questions that would normally just be WEIRD to ask... just relax if they ask you a weird question... that is the point because you want to learn things about that person that normally would be just to weird to ask or answer... so yes everyone does because you want to know things about each other that maybe no one else does or that you just wanna know :) good luck... i hope this helps :)
PAWJlGWRaa	A sharing folder, is a folder created by MSN in your My Documents Folder, all this is, is a folder the 2 of you can put files in to view/share with each other. But the folder can only be used while the other person (or yourself) is still logged on, after that the folder is removed until they come online again.<br>  <br>  Virus can be transferred with a sharing folder, but if you have a anti-viral software installed, you'll be able to scan the item before viewing/using|`|WLj5UZoOaa	You press no.<br>  coz that just weird :S<br>  its your personal stuff|`|zKqmXfD0aa	it could be a virus... or knowing boys a sick mean joke :/
NdyEAA5gaa	That could mean that the woman cares or worries about this man as a friend and cares about them, their feelings, how they are doing in general. If someone said that to me that is what i'd read into it. If someone said this to you I'd imagine they think allot of you and are happy that you are in their life. I wouldn't read too much into the possible romantic sentiment here.|`|QC6pR4y6aa	not really getting what ur asing here...but i guess u can tell if soemone really cares for someone else is when they make sacrifices for them and dont complain. it means they care about them.|`|8PYYdP6Faa	maybe you should explain the question a little more ...|`|c5YDFp2daa	uh? It means that they care?|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Just what you said...it mean's they care for them.|`|va8quhPtaa	there is always one who cares and shares.
c1i7Mn1Baa	Might as well be called prostitution|`|AA11264704	Yes they do and yeah, it could be considered prostitution.|`|w1kxVQqzaa	YES CUSE WHEN ITS BIG WE CAN RIDE IT ALL NIGHT LONG IF U NO WAT I MEAN  <br>  <br>  I WANNA PICK UP TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!|`|AFjehuZ5aa	Yes and yes i feel it does.|`|o0Bp8jGmaa	Yeah that is self chosen career by some women...|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Yes and yes|`|AA11328507	Nowadays a man with a big thick wallet is only because its full of pictures and business cards...don't kid yourself !
0DIHY37daa	he's doing his job, its because he loves you. millions of kids around the world wish and pray they had someone who cares as much as he does. be grateful
Q6m9YqpTaa	yeah she is
9RAFabFEaa	1 guy for sure, however I don't think that you are going to get very honest answers. After reading about ur "experiment" it seems as if you someone says more than 1 than they are a bad person and just uses other people and that may not always be the case. Actually men do it to woman all the time so why can't woman do the same to men without being called a whore or slut. Before I was in a relationship I dated a few different men, but I did make it clear that I did not want a relationship with them just to hang out and occasionally have sex.<br>  I love and respect my boyfriend now and would never jeopardize that!|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I'm diffently not like that I would rather be with someone that loves me for me not for just a sex object.|`|ey7ekTpTaa	One man, forever and ever.|`|8oPVcYSyaa	One guy, idk cuz im kinda old fashion|`|9xCtDDBgaa	One guy for sure!|`|wuyjidC0aa	one guy|`|ECe1rgsdaa	One guy.|`|5vO61nuvaa	I'd rather be with one guy who can share his life with me. <br>  <br>  But, in the past, I have casually dated (not slept with) several guys at the same time.|`|i15KoiJhaa	I prefer to have that one Guy who makes me feel good and secure.<br>  <br>  Not because ones heart cannot be broken at any point in a relationship (even those one on one relationships that go south) but because for me... having my Husband there with me and knowing no matter what happens, he loves me... there is nothing better then that.<br>  <br>  I believe it is better to give your all then to half a** it even if it doesn't work out in the end... I never will sit back and second guess myself or think if only I had done this....|`|4EWCegiRaa	You're "experiment" is flawed.  it implies that dating more than 1 person at a time(or having a 3some) means you view people as sex objects.  In reality, sex is rarely the reason why people date (or sleep with) more than 1 person at a time.|`|1sRqj5fhaa	1 guy|`|87XILDVBaa	One guy.
uBssj3Znaa	ignore them ... they say these things to purposely get to you, and they are so they are winning.|`|d76Mz5c0aa	look them in the eyes and tell<br>  them " at least i got the cajones<br>  (ka honiez) to look<br>  death in the eye and laugh."<br>  and then start laugh hystericly and<br>  they will leave you alone. lol|`|oiqXz3e4aa	kick their ***<br>  or if u think u can then ignore them
bO2rzfISaa	If he's not working he's on the couch. When I ask him to do things, he doesn't. At all. Unless I set some sort of "other" deadline.<br>  <br>  He faithfully goes to work, and I appreciate that, but I wish he had a little momentum at home.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	I DID!<br>  <br>  Define lazy... hmmm.<br>  <br>  Well, spending your day on the couch with a beer in one hand and a remote in the other...<br>  <br>  I deal with it by ignoring it... nope it doesn't really work?|`|8F33NnyYaa	no i didn't marry someone lazy, but i did marry a fat pig|`|88bDvyiwaa	Yes I did.<br>  <br>  In the divorce process.|`|GcsUwIAaaa	i did   and divorced her|`|5tCTrxoYaa	YES!!! Still married. He doesn't help with cleaning, kids, washing clothes, anything!!!!!!!!!!! Help!!!!!!!!!!!What do I do??????|`|uay5iNrXaa	Yes and It hasn't changed in 18 years . I ended up resenting him for not doing his share around the house and I felt over burdened all the time because of it.   Good luck...|`|AuKKjaxaaa	My wife married a lazy person.  He just wants to enjoy his time away from work.  She wants him to be more ambitious.
IARYnu6zaa	Its a possibility, but if it doesn't happen all the time then he really doesn't have any reason to be.<br>  From past experience I've noticed generally girls spend more time with boyfriends than they do with friends so they probably get enough time together.<br>  If it really is getting to you that you think he might be pissed off with you, try talking to him about it.<br>  Goodluck.|`|8hgrkiK5aa	um ths story was kinda hard to follow but um... im assuming you were kinda like the third wheel? or something like that? yeah he could be mad at you for that. so whenever your guy friend has a his girlfriend with him, you should leave. and i am assuming your a teenager? yeah you should just leave them alone to do... whatever.|`|u2ZKtLY0aa	<a href="http://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh149/Jessika_Lou_Wallin/Food/Funyuns.gif" rel="nofollow">http://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh149...</a>|`|g5vQYWrzaa	Yes|`|K9xP8PtMaa	David that 2points thing i love it ...i think its off the stain|`|sSOqEzqxaa	call dr phil and discuss it|`|CLdM1OsLaa	No. <br>  Just dont sweat it.|`|tnDJgYYZaa	yep|`|dcd11iUwaa	no if your hanging out with her first then you have every right to be there.|`|09zVUMBRaa	Maybe...|`|Hek7MUNYaa	hes your friend, if he really wanted to be along with her he could just tell you or ask you to give them some space, and not act like a total ***|`|sNKJDBhgaa	**** both of em, and get new friends. you shouldnt even be in a friendship that complicated. he sounds kinda 2 faced btw.|`|QODJNf1oaa	No...i'm sure they have enough alone time|`|D8EMsZT1aa	call me n il tell u 207-523-0879
EP2TZWYEaa	I just think that he doesn't know how to interact with you now that he like you. when you first met he was just talking to you but now he feels something and doesn't know what to do for the best. Maybe he looks at you because he is trying to work out what to say to you. I think that you should just go up to him and ask him if he would like to go out for lunch or for a drink at lunch and depending on what he says will tell you if he is really interested. I think that he just needs you to take control of the situation.|`|LxvDwiYiaa	well he might me shy or like you said hes a respectull guy who might think you already have a partner and he respects that also it might take time for him i guess|`|HnXOALn7aa	might be intimidated.|`|5SiOnsFZaa	Maybe you like each other|`|IxR6Akpwaa	Either because he has poor social skills or he doesn't like you!|`|ORJ48m4eaa	might think you are after him, or heard a rumour or more likely is nervous (regardless of if he likes you or not)
pUNWFSDfaa	Hell yea you deserved that! You got what was coming to you for jerking him around. He should screw more girls on the side! Maybe than you'll realize what your doing to him. Either be with him or dont. Stop jumping back and forth you dumb whore|`|AA11564934	You seem to enjoy drama.  I think you need therapy to figure out the big picture on why you are sabotaging yourself like this and stop looking at little details|`|0W6lIfYVaa	you broke up with him you can't blame him for sleeping with someone else. not to mention you broke up with him repeatedly. i would have been pissed. if i were u i'd end it for longer ten the time it takes to sleep with someone else and figure out what you want|`|AMTYPir7aa	sounds to me like you are playing him dear. why don't you just break it off once and for all stop stinging him along. everything you have said above screams you don't like him.|`|pzh8Nualaa	I would feel that it's my fault that he hooked up with her.  But that if she's a wannabe me why would he date her when he can have the real thing|`|JQZzI49Paa	You deserve it.|`|7wkHVaNyaa	I would feel like i did it to myself. Hun you kept breaking it off cause you were unsure. So who are you to be mad about what he did when not with you. Was he supposed to be all broken up over a girl who clearly didn't wan thim when she dumped him. Seriously hun, lighten up, you created all this drama, now deal wth it. So what if she likes your style. You don't feel good bout yourself cause you are playing games and it has created damage in the relationship and now ur insecure over the fact he moved on for a bit. Not everything is all about you, others have feelings and insecurities also.|`|w5ZJqatXaa	Everything you got is what you deserved! you kept on breaking up with him on and off so its obvious you didnt want him. no one is going to sit up and continue to play games with you because your the only on having fun while doing it. Im glad the boy got with a girl you didnt like, hes proving his point not to mess around with his emotions. Your lucky he even stayed around that long to where you can do that on and off. Next relationship your in try not to do that. Sorry but what happens happens.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Well have you found what you was looking for when you left him? If not  then you will keep breaking up with him, because what you are looking for is not in him, so leave him alone and move on, but if you want to be with him exclusively then stay with him and work it out. You have to make a checklist of what is missing in him that you want in someone else, and can you sacrifice?|`|IeeaLYubaa	i had a similar situation w my ex. we kept breaking up and gettin back together and he even went into another relationship but that only lasted a week and tried to come back but i didnt let him. i recently found out he cheated on me when we were broken up for a few hours! if u took him back after he hooked up w someone else and u can kiss him after he kissed someone else and even possibly sleep w him after he slept w another girl than u deserve it (im sorry im mean). just remember if u forgave him that he can do anything and expect ur forgiveness....|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Nothing is better than knowing you are a self assured woman who doesn't NEED a man.  Games such as breaking up, making up and breaking up again, are childish and are indicative of a relationship that is not true love.  People just don't play cruel games with people they care about.  Move on.  You both will find someone else.|`|NBErRe8Saa	really I think you got what you had coming to you, the fact that he took you back after breaking up with him more then once is his own dumb fault, You cant prosecute him for hooking up with her when you yourself doesn't even know if you actually want him or not.|`|0f85647fdd2f49d15133f974c8cc8f80aa	You really should figure out what you want before you ask other people to behave. If I were your boyfriend, I would have run away from you because you don't sound loving at all. What do you have to offer in the relationship? Are you doing a good job at all?|`|2JIkzC1baa	well to say it isnt mean cause u said that u did mean things 2 him what he suppose 2 do. on the other side it could be mean but at least u got him back|`|g5FLZB7Baa	no one deserves to get hurt..technically they say you keep playing with fire you will get burned i think you should let him go until you can figure out what you want or who you want don't string someone along because your afraid that they'll end up with someone else or just because your afraid of hurting them by letting go...you're hurting him more and thinning the thread between you guys sooner or later you keep breaking up and making up he's going to get tired and let YOU go|`|MNCtImf2aa	Well I think that if he knew that you didnt like her that that was more of the reason he went after her and not some other girl. he knew it would bug you and hurt you just as you hurt him. guys have huge egos and when somthing hurtsthem they feel like they have to do somthing to make themselves feel better even though its childish its true if you two are treating each other this then maybe it would be a good idea to end this before it gets any more complicated.|`|waU3gxwPaa	I don't know why he keeps coming back if you just keep braking up with him. You are going to have to figure out what YOU really really want and then stick with it. If you want him, you will have to push the past behind you and move on, if you don't want him, let him go so he can go on with his life.|`|Ikn7aKQ3aa	girlfriend that boys really love you and u should get your priorities straight and work out things with your boyfriend. stop playing that boy is not a toy. he is not some trophy that you can alway reclaim when you throw it away, cause the same thing that you throw away somebody would pick it up that's what that girl did.|`|cgytTEOZaa	u must b optimistic...may b u dnt wna hurt him at all but the situation is so critical that u hv to break jur relation but its ok u need not to worry...life is not short. if u really feel guilty then say sorry to him for wat u hv done wid him nd b his gud frnd forvever, thats it..|`|cqeuX3MUaa	I wouldnt give you the time of day personally.<br>  <br>  You played with his emotions to the point he probly got desensitized to it.<br>  <br>  if he is scorned, he may be setting you up for a fall.|`|aXn7WU7paa	Well technically, he's right, he didn't cheat on you, and technically, it sounds as though he was just trying to piss you off anyway. <br>  Dont take it to heart.|`|UcwijP6eaa	Unfortunately, you did deserve it, I'm sorry. You seem like a good person at heart, but you've got things to learn. You now know how it feels to be in his shoes, so keep this lesson learned in mind.

Go for it girl! :)|`|paHMgbhAaa	Yeah i think he likes you, im shy too but boys normally hint that they like girls by smiling or quickly looking at them or something like this.

Hell he'd use your dog for sex if he had the chance. Just because he wants sex so badly doesn't mean he doesn't love you. Don't equate the two.|`|lwm48UiSaa	depending on how long you have been dating it could be reasonable. But I think he should be taking things a little slower. I know that when I was a virgin I didn't like to be pushed somewhere I didn't like. You should just tell him to let stuff happen and not try to make you discuss it first. I think you should wait it out. If he isn't understanding about it then break up with him because he probably just wants sex.|`|9HkLq8Ogaa	Yeah, he's a horny bastard and the idea of you being a virgin turns him on. He thinks that since youre a virgin your just burning with sexuality. Ya need to tell him to calm his hormones. He's sexually frustrated cuz he hasnt had any in 2 years. <br>  <br>  <br>  PS: I dont think he's right for you. He sounds like one of those mental manipulators.|`|94gC814Eaa	I know im not a guy but i felt like warning you that saying because your not opening up physically, he wants in your pants and once you start the fingering thing it willgo from there.

BUT he did also say emotionally so he may feel your being cold and not giving him anything.|`|AsFiWxhUaa	sweetie he is 25 and has one thing on his mind and that is sex and the whole spill about you not liking him as much is to try and make you fell guilty. if he loves you and cares about you he would not try and make you feel guilty for making that personal decision.|`|2eGMXYaIaa	Not really, sex is a two way street.

Please. Dump this loser now. He's pulling the same stunts and saying the same empty nonsense that 16-year old boys use when they want sex. <br>  <br>  You need to find someone who respects you and treats you that way. This guy needs to find someone his own age, but I guarantee women his own age think he's a nobody.|`|NBErRe8Saa	the guys is just a pusher and not to offend you a Loser!, he should be content with just having you, he has no right to assume you need to use your body to love him unless its on your terms and yours only, dont give it up to the guy, you'll end up regretting it in the future. I also dought that a guy coming on this strong has waited 2 years between his last partner, hes prolly dieing on that fact.<br>  <br>  20 year old male myself|`|hF6uZqWRaa	Well im not a guy... but hes 25 so basically hes just desperate for it. This doesn't mean hes just using you for sex, but it you dont want to sleep with him dont do it!... If you want him to finger you go ahead but im pretty sure things are going to get heated up (maybe just him) and he's going to want to go further.|`|k4I9dG0Caa	how long have you guys been to gether? but i dont think hes using you if he wants you to open up emotionally he has that  right as you man. but if your not ready then you just arent. i think your doing a good job because a lot of older guys try to play young women!!!  open up to him emotional a little an if hes still frustrated then you know what he wants|`|fNNvKvpjaa	well i think his trying to see where he can get with you but if you feel pressured tell him that you dont want to go there let him know ur standards and if he still trys to get you to do things you dont want to do his wants to use you,or his just a creep!|`|hSY0LuCOaa	He just wants to do you.

A MAN NEVER HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE YOUR VIRGINITY!!!! Obviously he knew you were a virgin when he went into this and now its getting a little bit to hard for him to deal with the fact that he has a gem and not a ho.<br>  <br>   My ex said the same thing and you know what? I gave it up because I thought our relationship would get better with sex. WRONG!! If the realtionship isn't right without sex it certainly isn't going to be right with it.<br>  I say tell him that you feel uncomfortable at his advances but whatever you do...don't give it up because he's begging. Let your virginity go to a man who loves you whether you're having sex or not.If he can't deal with that tell his *** to step|`|sgEAVyoQaa	sht honestly you should be proud to be a virgin...sht do you know how many virgin girls you can find in the states...SLIM to Non...well the slim could be you...<br>  im dude and i have to admit...we say anything to a girl to get what we want...<br>  but honestly, if a guys is forcing you or presuring you to have sex with him...that mean he only wants one thing...YOUR BODY...<br>  when ur ready then do it...if not then dont...<br>  he has no right to be mad...just prolly mad at HIMSELF for being an idiot...<br>  take care of your self and always think before you act...<br>  you seem like a sweet girl...keep it that way|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	I think you better be careful. I don't know how a 25yr old guy is going 2yrs w/o sex. It doesn't sound right at all. You don't sound that comfortable with your own body yet. Don't let him pressure you about it proves how much you care, that's BS from way back. It shows how much he cares by respecting (or not) your decision as well. If your not willing to open up to him there's a reason and you need to listen to that reason. I can understand his frustration and don't believe at all that he isn't getting it somewhere else for the last 2 yrs. Be careful and keep your self respect above all else. Its your body and you'll decide when and where anything happens to it or not.|`|AA11632916	It really depends on how long you have been together. If you've been together for a while it's probable that he's not just using you for sex.<br>  <br>  It's natural to be scared at first but don't feel pressured into doing anything you don't want to do. Any decent guy won't pressure you into doing anything sexual.|`|oIZnPGYnaa	keep on saving yourself girl god said that sex before marriage is wrong if it is really real love he would ask you to get married and want a committed relatiopnship you don't need the presure.    and yes he is probabley frustrated that showes lack of his selr control. try some 69 that is about as far as you should go.|`|g0w5kLFTaa	he just using you for sex. brake up with him|`|078UfDg6aa	not really|`|d54c3d945ad5f97cff752dda7df4eb42aa	doh rush and he should't 2 let him  wait till u are ready|`|CTE2eRgZaa	Talk to him.  Its not him that you're uncomfortable with, its the stage of the relationship and yourself.  <br>  <br>  I'm running into the same problem, but i'm helped by the fact that my bf, while older, is a virgin too.  He took off my bra once, and I was so self-concious about my breasts that I couldn't even concentrate on what he was doing to me.  Tell your bf that taking off clothing makes you self-concious.  Its not him, its 18 years of hiding that part of your body and society making it a thing to be ashamed of.  My bf agreed to go back a step and leave my bra on, and the next time he made me feel so amazing, like i was the most beautiful thing in the world to him, I didn't even mind.  He didn't ask, I just did it.  Maybe it was because he took his shirt off for the first time, and I felt that I wasn't alone.<br>  <br>  Your bf asking you to do something like that over the phone isn't terrible.  It makes you feel funny because there's no one there.  Do you masturbate?  If not, maybe you should try it a few times, you might like it.  If you're not comfortable touching yourself, how can you be comfortable with someone else touching you?  <br>  <br>  Talking to him about how you feel will make him feel like you're open with him.  Write it down if you're that nervous about talking with him.  Then he has an explanation, rather than you always saying no and he doesn't know how to fix it.<br>  <br>  Same thing with the fingering.  If it's too soon, then it's too soon.  Tell him that you'll let him know when he can touch him there, but for now he can't.  <br>  <br>  He's not using you for sex if you don't communicate with him about your fears.  Then he has a right to be frustrated.<br>  <br>  IF you tell him all of this and he still pushes, then he's using you and dump him.  But tell him what he can do to make you feel comfortable, so he knows how.|`|WA8Pee7vaa	he probably wanted you take your bra off because he wants a way to channel his sexual tension without actually pressuring you into intercourse.  Its sounds like he really loves you if he has waited 2 years before even bringing the concept of fingering or sex in general.  However not being a virgin and not having sex for 2 years has probably made him a little frustrated.  If he really loves you he wont ask you to do all these sexual things if your not ready or dont want to.  If you want to wait tell him that don't do anything you will regret! if he truly loves you he will understand and you will know if he only wants you for sex!

pegSqlMBaa	First off I'm a Christian. I live in the US. I personally believe the state/fed should not recognize/know anything about marriage. Marriage is a spiritual/biblical/self choice. It has nothing to do with state law. So for insurance purposes I think all insurances should include your FAMILY. Those living under your roof with DNA/Adoption ties and another adult. End of story. God doesn't want us going around judging and FORCING people to follow his laws. That defeats the purpose of free will. God loves us all equally. Whether it's the fornicator, homosexual, thief, liar, one with unpure thoughts, or any one who sins AT ALL. Find ONE living person who is sin free....you won't. So therefore God loves us all equally. Just as a mother and father love their children equally..if they're in their right mind. So...marriage for insurance purposes is WRONG in my opinion because it shouldn't be an issue. Religion should not be mixed with state/fed. :-) So what I'm saying is...you should not HAVE TO get married for insurance purposes. It should already be available.|`|BTvlYvZKaa	People get married for all sorts of reasons.  Some people, especially in their older years after their other spouses have past on, get re-married so that they do not feel as lonely.<br>  <br>  I am glad that you love each other, and if you do choose to get married, I hope that your marriage is a success, regardless of the original reason for marriage.<br>  <br>  Who knows...maybe years down the road you will decide that you do want to have children together, even if it means adoption, but no, planning on having children together is definitely not a prerequisite for getting married.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I don't think there's anything wrong with you getting married just to get on his insurance. Its your life and your marriage. Do with it as you want.<br>  And who cares about the divorce rate!?! It means nothing to me.|`|olopisx7aa	Huh? What about just not getting married. Or getting a job that offers insurance. If you can find someone who has insurance and is willing to marry you so you can use her, then go ahead.|`|UatcpQjraa	ya **** that ****.... get what you can get... but leave the kids out of it... he might be broke sumday and your force with the sperm that should of run down their daddy's leg.... take advantage of him. get what is yours|`|PPItQAn7aa	I'd do it!! how can marriage mean anything really..you guys love each other. talk to him see what he thinks.|`|20BKec9aaa	Whether you see it or not that happily ever after stuff does exist, and the divorce rate is only an example of how lazy we have become and how we are unwilling to try to stay together and make compromises. You hear about people with 3 children that aren't married, if you can't even marry then why the hell are you creating something that signifies union. Marriage is supposed to be a union of man and woman, a sacred union which is why no matter which religion you look at marriage is a sacred practice. Oh yeah and GOLD DIGGER that's what we use to describe people like that, you live with someone and become close and intimate for the reason that you want his money. What type of relationship is that, it doesn't unify ,signify or mean any thing beyond hey guy I found someone to &^&* tonight. You ask about children, are they nothing any more are children really nothing but a symbolism of lust for each other. Imagine a world were none of our parents really wanted us, where we are all just accidents that happened when daddy forgot his condom or it broke on him, oh wait just look outside we are living it. Intimacy comes with work and struggles and fights not when you feel like banging the next hot girl you see. <br>  <br>  YOu are the type of person that kills all hope of there being someone special or there being the one, love is real and true love happens|`|pMtMsbBnaa	Wow, well I say it's your life and as long as you both agree, do what you want.  But If you're so adamant about it I don't know why you're on Yahoo Answers looking to see what other people think.  No, a lot of people aren't going to agree with you because a lot of people feel that marriage is sacred and it's a vow you take with a person when you decide you want to be united to them and spend the rest of your life with them, etc etc.  But really, as long as you both agree you can use it for whatever reason you like.  Some companies (like Cirque du Soleil for example) don't even require you to be married to get your partner's benefits....I think eventually more (large) companies may go this route to accommodate for people's different lifestyles.|`|MRijAWJRaa	marriage is a symbol saying that you love someone very much.<br>  <br>   if you love him and want to get married, you wouldn't care about the money, you would care about each other.<br>  <br>  if you want the money then i guess you're a gold digger... and that's the truth.|`|iZgtcAcAaa	whatever works for you - that is a good thing<br>  <br>  i personally don't think that this is any better or worse a valid reason for marriage than love or money or even sex.<br>  <br>  How about the tax advantages you get for getting that marriage license?|`|FwdBKodSaa	Marriage is a contract of an adult male and adult female based on their free decision to live with each other for life in love and cooperation with the aim of having children of their own. Marriage, in its nature, is founded on mutual love of husband and wife.|`|ui7waO1haa	It's wrong because a couple I used to babysit for got into a lot of marriage trouble just over marrying for insurance. It's bullshit...don't try it unless you want to get divorced.|`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	As long as you love each other, I don't see the big deal and no, I certainly didn't marry my husband just for his money!!

Especially the wrist thing an particular.<br>  It's not just your stature, it's that a lot of women want to know their man could dominate them.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't call that a recipe for turning a girl on, I'd call it a recipe for hotter sex. By the time you're doing this she better be turned on already.|`|uUqPOppoaa	Ehm, well my girlfreind likes to be likes to be dominated, she says she fantasises about it..|`|oUz7bqcZaa	possibly|`|yJTaBGoEaa	Perhaps.<br>  But 250 lbs is not a turn on, for me atleast.|`|dAYflK2Yaa	what the ****|`|GkCTGTCCaa	yes|`|L2MoTyT7aa	that kind of sounds like rape, not gonna lie|`|Gdyvdcqxaa	i so agree with picard...

L52KUW3daa	This is funny, I'm going through the EXACT same thing.  I'm a sophomore and they're a senior too.  This is what I plan on doing.<br>  <br>  I think communication is the most important thing.  Don't talk EVERY day, otherwise he'll get into a routine and he won't even have a chance to miss you.<br>  I'd say talk maybe every 2 or 3 days, but don't let it go any longer than that; otherwise that could backfire and turn into 5 days to a week of not talking.<br>  Make sure you do get to see each other at least a few times during the year.  Seeing each other is critical.  I know you won't be able to see him often, but maybe during his breaks he can at least see you for a few days.  Make sure you keep that spark alive...or unfortunately (and i dont want to say this..) there might be a risk of him cheating.  A lot of college relationships don't last if one person is still in HS but I believe you guys can do it :)<br>  <br>  <br>  ohh sweetie i wasnt putting you down at all lol. I'm also sixteen and i KNOW love can exist. I'm in the same boat you are and I KNOW how obnoxious it can be when people constantly say you dont know what love is at 16. ohh honey, i know EXACTLY how you feel. we're going through the same exact situation lol.|`|4EWCegiRaa	BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE:  You are definitely not in love.  Don't be so naive...<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Explode much?  You asked for any experience or stories and I gave you what knowledge I had.  I didn't judge you, you judged me by calling me pathetic.  The idea that there's NO CHANCE in the world I'm right would make you naive and pretty ignorant.  Don't be a hypocrite about it.<br>  <br>  Do me one favor... remember my original answer 10 years from now and think about how you responded.  That's all I ask.  If I'm wrong, why not remember because you'll feel good about being right, right?<br>  <br>  EDIT AGAIN:  I understand.  I guess  I could have phrased that better myself.  I'm sorry as well.  I know what you feel like because I was 16 and in love but you should keep an open mind that maybe, just maybe, it's not because 99% of the time, it's not.  I hope it is and I believe you but it couldn't hurt to keep an open mind about it.  I'm sorry again about earlier.
oE1eCjRtaa	I would recommend working at Gregg's if you can, the starting rate is ￡5.16 and hour while training and then ￡5.32 after, when you get to 18, im sure it goes up to ￡6 something. The pay is quite good especially considering you are 17 and most people will only pay you minimum wage. <br>  <br>  Other places to check are Supermarkets like tesco, or sainsburys. Or as a last resort try primark? Im not exactly sure how much they pay though.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped :)|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	I was a nanny and I also worked weekends at a snackbar at my local little league/babe ruth league field.  I got $20 a shift for that or anywhere from $8 -11/hr watching kids.  (And both of those are pretty much cash jobs so you keep what you make)  Of course that was about 10 years ago so who knows what they pay now.  I liked those jobs because they fit in with my school and sports schedule well.

Don't take on baggage from someone else..|`|VOLRhthLaa	Be very cautious, this guy sounds like he wants both of you. He has decieved you already so it would be hard to trust him in the future. Stay friends and nothing more and see how things work out with his current girlfriend before making any commitment to him.|`|NDoyhCZYaa	Kill him.|`|AA11626002	Have you asked any of your friends if his story is true? Believe me I have meet my share that tried lines like that. Alot of them want their cake and to eat it too?! If he is that unhappy he should leave but for the right reasons not the wrong. Meaning you never leave someone cause you found someone else? You leave because you no longer want in that relationship. You don't wanna be used or be a bounce back either. Be careful and good luck!|`|YIbELNRBaa	Its nice that he still seems to care about this other girl so that she doesnt start her addiction again if he had let her go, but its seems hard for him in that situtation.

The whole recovering from drugs n alcohol is a damn lie!! He should have been honest and told you straight up in the first place when you first started talking.|`|5GEFddXYaa	well, as you said that you don't think that you can trust this guy. I fink that it would be very difficult for you too have a relationship with him. <br>  Also, it mostly depends on the strength of your feelings towards him. This is because if they are not that strong of feelings then is it really worth risking the health and well being of his corrent girlfriend? <br>  If your worried about you and this guys friendship, if it's really true friendship then you should have no problems. However, i have had friendships when the guy has told me that they like me and i personally found things a bit wierd but that did pass within time :)<br>  <br>  im sure your gonna do the right thing [=<br>  xxxx|`|R2L18C0iaa	hmmmm..... If you really like him i think youd be best playin by ear. you dont wanna jump right into things then he turns out to be a totally different person. he shouldve told you he had a gf and if he really liked you he shouldve told you sooner, becareful hes not just trying to make you feel sorry for him like you said you dunno if you trust him.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|g8X1BGreaa	If people do have problems with drugs and it is your gf, it should not be burdened on them.  If they are not married and are just going out then it is not his responsibility to stay with her.  You should tell him how you feel and don't let this girls problems get in the way of your relationship...<br>  <br>  drug issues should not be the thing keeping a relationship going and if he dumps her after she has recovered it will probably get her back on again.  If he dumps her while still recovering then she will still have support nd help and if she starts drinking a little again she can get the help with her process she is taking now.  It is better to do it while healing instead of waiting afterwords.
db906faa1e865713523b12a88131bcdbaa	Yes!I'm had taken fully naked photo of myself while I'm have vacation on an island.I'm only share with a few best friend of my.No big deal for that while seeing the photo...|`|jdah4ZA2aa	No, but a friend of mine sent me a dirty picture of himself and my friend happened to be texting someone on my phone.  She sent him back a really rude text ... we all got a big laugh about it, though.  Thanksfully everyone involved was good natured.|`|49gugL8maa	My ex sent naked pictures of herself to my friend by accident, and I don't know what she has done since then, nor do I really wish to know.<br>  She just laughed it off, and my friend promised to delete it and never bring it up again.
iHc8BfxLaa	If you forgot how you feel about her then why dont you set up a friendly date for just you and her to just hang out and talk more. then start hanging out more and more then see if you remember then.  i know how you feel trust me.*long story* i hope things work out for you.
4HoVVCenaa	Tell him, if you respect me, then you will accept that I am not ready. No always means no.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	It's not that hard.  You just tell him, "Billy, I said that I want to wait."  If he cannot accept that answer then tell him, "I'm sorry, but I want to date someone who respects me."<br>  <br>  It only seems hard because you don't want to run the risk of losing him and being alone.  However, it is far better to be alone and have your virtues in tact than to be with someone who doesn't really respect you.|`|3LdKvdYtaa	you just need to have another serious conversation with him about how you want to wait and if he really loved you he would respect that. But dont give in just because he wants you to. even though you love him now you may not a little later down the road and you would hate yourself for having sex with him just to make him happy. Nobody can tell you when to have sex that is your personal choice|`|4RiziMD0aa	tell him your fixed on waiting until marriage and if he can't accept it then maybe he should find someone else. if mean if he really does love you he'll wait, a relationship isn't just about sex, imagine if you do end up giving yourself to him and you end up breaking up in the longer run. It's not worth it at all. If he loves you that much he'll wait with you.|`|Hek7MUNYaa	just take his hand <br>  look deep into his eyes and tell him that you care aboout him and that your not ready to have sex yet, and if he really loves you he will understand and wait for you. If he don't <br>  <br>  you know what to do. DUMP him or just live with it.|`|oS1TBzL6aa	Say "No!"  you are very pretty he'll learn to deal.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  A.T. Cunningham|`|UuAV4wVNaa	Tell him straight up..<br>  <br>  If you love me you wont ask me anymore... prove to me you love me by just letting it go..<br>  <br>  Or else i'll know you dont love me and i'm sorry but i cant be with someone who keeps bringing sex up and him knowing i'm not comfortable with that.. so if you care about me, you wont keep asking.|`|f9cS14c5aa	GIRLLLLL<br>  <br>  I WAS IN THE SAME POSITION MY FRIEND TOLD ME TO ASK HIM<br>  DO U WANT TO BE WITH ME FOR ME AND NOT FOR WHAT COULD GIVE U OR WANT TO BE WITH ME FOR JUST ONE REASON AND I GOT MA ANSWER AND GUYS CANT LIVE WITHOUT SEX WELL SOME .SO ILL TELL HIM STRAIGHT UP I NOT ****** U GET GOT IT GOOD LOL|`|AA11752603	If he doesn't respect your decision then he's going to keep on bugging you.  You might want to analyze why he is really into you.|`|JCdBSULraa	He just wants sex, he's using you, get out of there asap.  I think most guys would ask for sex once or twice, but if he actually cared about you, he wouldn't pressure you.|`|6CU00J1Yaa	You can please him without having sex. Knock on the door, just don't enter.|`|bQisGgSsaa	He may not be a guy. If you watch Jerry Springer you be seeing people getting fooled, they don't be with they look like.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	Just honetly tell him, Hey I want to wait till we are married and if you can't wait then. I'll break up.|`|e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	let him know that if he cant respect your wishes, then he's obviously not ready to be in a relationship.. at least not one that is good and healthy.. <br>  <br>  tell him exactly how you feel. :)|`|PdJxdbY7aa	Tell him straight up how you feel about sex. Don't ber ude or mean about it,but if it is special to youhe needs to respect that. Feelings of lovestart with the other person accepting youforwho you are, and that'swhat makes havingsex with that person special and wonderful. It's not complicated. It's just that you're afraid of the reaction. and guess what, it's normal! <br>  If he has an outburst, then maybe you shouldreconsider the relationship...there's tons of fishes out there,explore if needed.|`|unVj43Xxaa	Just tell him like it is, if he's just waiting around for sex then can just move on. If he's serious then the pressuring needs to stop or you're moving on to someone who shares your values. Guaranteed if you sleep with him he won't be sticking around for long. Also guaranteed if he gets pissy about it or moves on then you know what kind of person you are dealing with and that's definitely someone who is selfish and a selfish person is also selfish in the sack!|`|P7CRp8J0aa	I totally know what you mean. Just sit down with him and explain how you love him, but you don't want to have sex yet. Talk to him about how much more great it will be if you two wait til you get married. But if he won't listen to you, maybe he isn't the right guy. But at the same time, maybe he is. You never know. But if he loved you, he would wait. Just explain how you arn't exactly ready yet. Maybe you could suggest doing other stuff instead of sex...?|`|y5DAfNtHaa	He wants it really bad, talk to him and explain that it's not yet time to have that activity. If still persist, leave the guy..|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Tell him you're not ready. If he keeps pressuring you, leave him, and come see me =]<br>  <br>  But seriously, he should respect your decisions. if he doesn't, he's not the one.|`|uqs2NCodaa	hes just excited. Prolly one his friends told him something. Just wait it out.|`|V3WsdeYIaa	just stick with your beliefs. he's a guy, what do you expect.  and oral sexis still sex..and ewww.|`|CYwha8Baaa	ooooo wow sounds like he doesnt respect your wishes honestly he isnt going to stop so0ooo <br>  <br>  honestly ask your parents or an adult they will give you the best advice really!|`|bs8ug3Vjaa	oral sex|`|UAuSVBelaa	Hes a guy!
zMg4hQwDaa	you are not there, so when you show up, you need to back off because you will lose that fight easily. She is at his side all the time, you are not. He will chose her side and you will be left out. so best solution is to be nice and casually point things out to him but know that you are in the weaker of the 2 positions.|`|bO2rzfISaa	It's hard to know what to say, you haven't given any specifics.|`|5DJcir9saa	Be passive aggressive right back.  Check out this website...its more funny than anything but you can see how others respond when people are passive aggressive.<br>  <br>  www.passiveaggressivenotes.com

EheFkTH1aa	You have to be careful because if she has never seen you before then she may think that it all has to do with the way she looks and nothing to do with who she really is. Flattering, but at the same time probably not going to happen. I know your probably and hopefully exaggerating but you may want to get in some small talk first before saying your pretty want to go out? Even if its for like 2 minutes. Just compliment her hair or outfit or something, then she'll get talking with you and then after a few minutes ask her out on a date. Give her your number, because that way if she thinks you were too upfront (and you kinda creep her out) then she doesn't have to call... if she thinks it was sweet then she'll call you. (or send you an e-mail or meet you somewhere, doesn't matter)  Also if her friend stays right next to her the whole time and does not give you two space then its a hint that they think your too upfront. If he friend backs off and gives you room its cause they probably approve of you. But try to catch her while she walking or something, that way theres no aquward friend situation. <br>  It really does depend on the person. I wouldn't really care if a guy came up to me like that, i would think of it more as a compliment, but i know other girls would totally be creeped out. Best of luck!!! xo|`|BKF4Cj1baa	I would get to know this guy first before I went on a date with him! There's no point in dating someone just because they said your pretty anyone can say that!! I don't think you should approch girls like that because it just looks and sounds desperate. Be yourself and approche girls the way that you want!!!!!         :P|`|J7k4xJtoaa	It is rude becuase you are interrupting and possibly embarassing this girl. They tell you this because confidence is the hottest thing a guy could have so if you are confident enough to tell her that you find her attractive and would love to take her out then do it. Just make sure it is situation apporpriate.|`|A0e9JyS8aa	well first you'll get her attention and whether she will admit it or not you will be on her mind as the guy who came on to her, she'll most likely tell her friends. and her friends might encourage her to try you out.<br>  <br>  be sure to leave your number ;)|`|VYMxtHpoaa	I would be a little surprised and reply, "I don't really know you all that well, maybe we should start off as friends or get to know each other a little better..."

One accurate indicator of health is physical attractiveness; another is hair. Healthy women have lustrous, shiny hair, whereas the hair of sickly people loses its luster. Because hair grows slowly, shoulder-length hair reveals several years of a woman's health status.<br>  <br>  Men also have a universal preference for women with a low waist-to-hip ratio. They are healthier and more fertile than other women; they have an easier time conceiving a child and do so at earlier ages because they have larger amounts of essential reproductive hormones. Thus men are unconsciously seeking healthier and more fertile women when they seek women with small waists.<br>  <br>  Until very recently, it was a mystery to evolutionary psychology why men prefer women with large breasts, since the size of a woman's breasts has no relationship to her ability to lactate. But Harvard anthropologist Frank Marlowe contends that larger, and hence heavier, breasts sag more conspicuously with age than do smaller breasts. Thus they make it easier for men to judge a woman's age (and her reproductive value) by sight—suggesting why men find women with large breasts more attractive.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, men may prefer women with large breasts for the same reason they prefer women with small waists. A new study of Polish women shows that women with large breasts and tight waists have the greatest fecundity, indicated by their levels of two reproductive hormones (estradiol and progesterone).<br>  <br>  <br>  Your treatment:<br>  Get laid!|`|s96Vo1dyaa	Because guys are so retarted and thats all they care about.

Good luck.|`|LofUQr28aa	If you catch him staring at you often,he probably does like you. <br>  You don't need to know how many times,just if you catch him looking.
21ToYoBDaa	i have the same exact problem ugh. i know its hard but try to not think of it.
GHnkKwl3aa	I think you really need to sit down and talk with them. Find out if they really liked you for you, or for your license.<br>  <br>  I think you should apologize and tell them you think you made a mistake of becoming suspicious and distant.<br>  <br>  Don't beg them to be your friends again, begging will make you seem desperate for friends.|`|jsE8ItDVaa	Test them and find out if it's just the free rides or not.

yOHCXiaMaa	OK  enough tar and feathers. <br>  First in some states if a man and woman cohabitates for as little as 30 days they are considered common law married.  And as some of us know some men and women live together so long they consider themselves married without the paper.  To me..that is hogwash because both want to claim the sanctities of marriage such as not going to bed with others, sharing the incomes and buying things together.. but they don't want that last bit of legality.<br>  <br>  I do agree it is time to quit having babies.  Cripes, you have not only given this man your virginity but now you are giving him your youth and the time you could have spent learning about yourself.  Plus you are hoping that if this doesn't work some other man will want to take on a ready made family.<br>  <br>  If in your gut you believe that he is guilty then more than likely he is.  I agree some young girls would stoop to no ends to get what they want but she has been too informative.  Yelling and screaming will not get you anywhere.  Ask this girl, without him knowing, personal things about him that she would only know if they had been intimate.  If she can answer correct...you have your answer.  And quit blaming her for gosh sakes.  It takes two to tango.  You do not know what crazy things he told her.<br>   <br>  Last but not least,  You haven't a legal leg to stand on... Your NOT married.  In his mind he is just being a man.  Now here you are, young and you are stuck raising three gifts from God and he can just be foot loose and fancy free.  What a win-win situation this was.|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	Sounds like you need to grow up and   S T O P    Having B A B I E S   by illegals|`|IWDFArMIaa	no your husband is a dirty cheater! You deserve so much better than that girl! Find a man that is good and won't do stupid pedophile stuff|`|h6AJH3TAaa	Leave him you don't need him our new goverment will pay for you and all that baby needs.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	He cheated. He's angry because you found out. and he went after you when you were 14 and now he's going after a 15/16 year old. Sounds to me like he's a predator and will always go after young ladies. Kinda scary. There are thousands of single mothers out there that can do it and so can you!!!|`|HRegfSrEaa	If you believe him or her is up to you...Just keep in mind that there are ways to care for yourself and your children. Talk to a social worker to see what you can get. If you want to talk let me know. I was in almost the same situation. I was pregnant (8 months) and was thinking to seperate, I am 23 and my hubby is 27, he is from another country, we have been together for 7years (married for 5). We were having problems (cant say they are competely taken care of right now). I talked to a social worker to see what I could get to care for myself and the girls. If we seperated, I would have made him give me money (he would have done without a fight for the girls).|`|NEWbh3Plaa	He is lying to you.  If I were you I would do what I had to do for a couple weeks to put some money back to get out of there.  If he is after 15 year old girls, you don't want a man like that around your children.|`|YptUtE0Yaa	I am sorry. I know you care for him but you as a women, as a MOTHER need to step up and take care of your kids. You do not need a man in your life that you have doubts on. This back and forth scenario would be somewhat acceptable IF you didnt have kids but you do. Be a mother to those kids and show them a strong women that you are. Dont teach them that you are weak. If you have a girl do you think she needs to see you treated like that and trying to catch him or wondering NO! She will just follow in your footsteps and let a man walk on her. If you have a boy your just showing him how to treat women. Subconsciously he will remember that and will default to that when he gets involved in a relationship. Not good. Please do whats best for your kids and quit worrying about just yourself!|`|4LsF70cjaa	I think that you should grow up.  Who is paying for all these babies you're popping out?  You?  Him?  I doubt it.  Stop playing house with my tax money and start supporting yourself.|`|T8AvZltDaa	How can you have a boyfriend/husband? If he hasn't married you he's just a boyfriend, no matter how many kids you have together.|`|bO2rzfISaa	This sounds like a very uncertain platform for the birth of three children. I don't see how you could take care of them without his help, and it will be very difficult to collect child support when he doesn't have legal status.<br>  <br>  Should you leave him? Probably. You'll probably need to wait 5 more weeks until you recover from the birth.<br>  <br>  Should you have had three children in such an uncertain situation? No.|`|AA11459642	A lot of red flags in your story.  Your not married, he is illegal, you have 3 children together.  He is possibly internet cheating, (which is really cheating) with a 15 year old girl.  <br>  1. He needs to return to his country and try to get here legally.  You need a find a job to help care for your children, no government help if you can help it.  Too many people depending on the government already. If he is talking to someone on the internet it is cheating, leave him especially if its with a minor, CRIME!<br>  Tell him to take a walk back to his country, fast.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Sounds Like Sour grapes and the Girl is Upset and as far as what to do thats up To You.

R1vvH4aKaa	Give me a break! You are choosing your BF by looks only? If so, you are a bimbo! A men is chosen by its abilities to bring the bacon home. A women is chosen by her good character traits and abilities. I choose women to have fun by their health and looks for a wife I also looks for education pedigree (to check on her family for abnormalities), social grace and finally compatibility. <br>  <br>  Looks are deceiving because they are enchanting!<br>  <br>  Use your brains and Good Luck!|`|plBXp91Daa	You can't base on a picture if you two belong together or not. It is more if your both personality match or not. By the way you look good.|`|u31B8Ycjaa	sure|`|1oiUVWvYaa	you can do better for looks, but belonging together is about emotion not looks. if he's a hot complete asshole, then you probably don't belong together. <br>  <br>  but if looks is all you're going for, you could definitely do better, because you are honestly the hottest person i have seen all day, in real life or on the internet.|`|2MVG5StDaa	Based on looks alone i'd say no you two don't belong together.

You should still take the risk.|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	I would be pleased that he got over his shyness & I would be sweet & loving to him|`|m7O5Nyx1aa	aw well i would definately go for it =) but also, definately do it either by text, over msn, or when you're alone - NOT in front of other people, because that would just be awful for you, for her andd all the people who have 2 watch.<br>  <br>  All girls would find it really flattering and cute =) if she doesn't like you, it might be awkward for about a week, but a weeks nothing tbh.<br>  If you like her, then chances are she likes you too =) because she must have noticed that you've got stuff in common e.t.c if you have.

Move on, you two truly don't love eachother if you break eachothers hearts and he obviously has moved on and has another girlfriend....now it's your turn! Move on hon!|`|xm0kLvnLaa	I'm in a similar situation. My only advice to you is act uninterested. In my experience, men come running when you ignore them.<br>  <br>  If you constantly go on about this girl, one of two things will happen a) the fact that you are so jealous will boost his ego, he'll play on it and do it even more to annoy you and make himself feel more desired or b) your behaviour will drive him mad, he'll feel he cant breathe because you smother him.<br>  <br>  Send one final text saying "you broke my heart, I got over it, I forgave you. I feel that if you loved me too, you would forgive me in the same way. However if you don't agree, I wont argue, I wont beg, i'll respect your decision. I wont be able to be your friend, it would kill me to see you with someone new. Its all or nothing. Love u"<br>  <br>  As soon as you send that DO NOT contact him. Wait 4 him to talk to you. If it is meant 2 b, he will be lost without u, he'll be miserable that you aren't chasing him any longer. He will come back if you make him miss u. If u nag, he'll wanna let u go or worse play with ur emotions.<br>  <br>  They say "if you love someone, let them go. If they come back they are yours, if not.....it was never meant 2 b"<br>  <br>  Good luck, will take some time but affairs of the heart always end in mind games. You must know how to play.

kvmWDuOJaa	It doesn't sound like she's knocked you back, it just sounds like she's genuinely busy.<br>  You should only start worrying if she's contantly "busy", and if she keeps rejecting you in this way and not just by being honest then she's not worth the trouble!<br>  You won't be annoying if you talk to her all the time, as long as you don't try to make small-talk too often XD<br>  Good luck!<br>  & please spare a vote? www.piczo.com/votehills|`|hLozB0MUaa	well i definitely think everything is fine... to me it sounds like she is definitely interested so i wouldn't worry about it... if she keeps being "busy" tho i would get a little worried... good luck hun|`|2QiLmXfhaa	hey she said yeah, don't push her or anything. She's interessted, carry on talking to her n give her a smile. :o)|`|qBz0ZfzFaa	She's definitely interested. Go for it. I would never tell a guy that the next weekend would be better unless I were interested. I would just let it stay at "Sorry, I'm busy." Good for you for having guts to ask girls out. Keep talking to her; be yourself. I bet she is very flattered by the attention. I love it when guys come talk to me.|`|MTPoGd1qaa	No she said'YES' gosh, what more do you want!<br>  <br>  Everything seems to be going great well done!|`|73Qzi3vVaa	Give the girl space for one thing, you're right, you don't want to be seen as some sort of stalker, wait until next weekend and be a bit romantic and chivalrous and let her do the talking and you just shut up and listen, girls love that, ask her the right sort of questions that will let her talk her head off and RELAX!<br>  <br>  Pick a place where you can enjoy a great sight and enjoy each other's company. It does not sound like you need to be concerned, you just seem to have the jitters.|`|dNma8Jeaaa	everything is fine its even great the fact that she makes the effort to talk to you and even though she was busy doesn't mean she doesn't want to go out with you the fact that she said she could next weekend means she wants to go out with you. but i wouldn't hover let her come to you sometimes.|`|iMaYLGECaa	yeah everything seems fine but if she said at the last minute she was to busy then you would know she wasn't interested but she arranged it for next weekend so shes definetly interested|`|2SzLx5Knaa	Just apoligize for the misconvenience and she will understand. trust me, she knows that you will still like her.|`|384509079b461e09cb5a404a23a5946faa	Well, give her the benefit of the doubt and ask her if she'd like to go to a movie.

rbXCALUhaa	I am almost certain that he likes you! He was trying to get your attention by talking about a girl he met in the summer! He hoped to get a reaction out of you. He is probably just outgoing, but it really seems like hes interested.<br>  You should straight out ask him :P<br>  peace :D|`|8oPVcYSyaa	Okay he's the flirty type.  And he's turning around to his friend to get advice on what to talk about with or, if not then why else would he be doing that 2 u. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   ohhh and do u like him<br>  <br>   totally keep me posted at aquillacbcbabi@yahoo.com|`|21ToYoBDaa	guys dont know how to show a girl they like her. they either try to act cool or be mean to the girl they like.|`|MHazHRGRaa	from a blokes kind of perspective ask him if he likes you|`|mPuBm8Hxaa	Trust me, you would know if he likes you or not.  Guys, they either like you or they don't.  And a majority of the time, they just like you as friends, or maybe not even as friends.  But when a guy wants to be more than friends with you, you will surely know.  He'll never be too busy to give you a call here and there; he wonders about you & he'll let you know that he misses you.  He'll check in on you, worry about you--you just know when a guy wants you.  Any guy that plays mind-games, they're into something else and not into you (maybe just your body).  If you don't mind playing his games with him, go right ahead--but just know that it'll most likelly never be anything more than that.|`|GPmBB0Mvaa	He likes you.......|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	It sounds as if he is just messing you around, and I think its a little pathetic to try and make you jealous. However if you do think he may really like you, then flirt with him a little and see if he responds.

If not then by "accident" bump into her or just smile at her and see if she smiles back.  Take it from there.<br>  <br>  If you have spoken to her then go for the kill.  Talk about maybe going for a drink, get the drink in the bag.  Then talk about dinner.  Progress it and see how well she reacts.<br>  <br>  How that helps|`|hBr3nfaIaa	Just go up to her and say something along the lines of 'hey I've seen you around' introduce yourself, then ask for her number.|`|KwdtzmKhaa	Just walk up to her and talk, girls can smell fear... you have to be confident, or you'll get nowhere.|`|aIY39akoaa	tell her how you feel try talk to her more often and then ask her out|`|jTHSi304aa	If I were you I would walk right up to her and ask her out.Confident men turn women on!What's the worst that could happen?Ask her if she'd like to go to dinner and a movie or take her site seeing.Don't be scared be confident!|`|55f8f33e16dda3c1b6a2648fb6bfdd46aa	Just go up and say "Hi".. tell her that U find her attractive and that U would like to take her out .

Don't hurry the whole relationship deal...if you are really into her take the time to build a foundation for a future relationship. Maybe ask her to a social event where there will be other people around at first...and after you've just "hung out" a few times and if you're still really interested then you can ask her to dinner or a movie, something that is more like a date. If you want a real relationship with a girl, its best to take your time.
NQFV2AdZaa	He must like you but may have felt unsure when you admitted to being 15 years old and that's why he said he had to get back to work. You could try talking to him again, ask how old he is and just explain that you like him. Also, although you are underage, you could still date him without getting too serious, however if he feels uncomfortable dating you so young, then i guess you could just be friends for now and try asking him out when you are older. But talk to him anyway and i hope it works out the way you want it to, good luck!|`|KR5RrBrBaa	i hate that when you dont know if they like u and ur too shy to ask... try maybe saying you wanna go to the cinema or maybe as a mate... or just ask him for his number but knida do it in a friendly way... then try seeing if he likes u <br>  <br>  answer mine please <br>  <br>  xxx

Like REALLY angry.  He tells me that I have a nice body but if that's the way i'm getting it then he doesn't want it anymore.  Anyways, it's kind of funny because I do it unintentionally, I just don't eat when I get busy.  but yeah, he hates it.|`|W618lfZ6aa	I don't like anorexic girls.  Eat healthy but stay healthy.<br>  <br>  There is a fine line, and many girls fall short or go over.<br>  <br>  If she has a little extra fluff I don't worry about it.

W618lfZ6aa	Avoid prostitutes, that's not a path you want to go.<br>  <br>  Just be patient and take your time, I didn't have sex till I was 25 and happy of it.<br>  <br>  If you are desperate, check craigslist.  But wear a condom, and there is always that risk of other STDs even with a condom.<br>  <br>  If you want to do it the right way, get yourself out there. School, sports ect.|`|JCdBSULraa	hmm I'm 25 and a virgin, I usually masturbate 3 times a day, but some days it's as much as 6 if I'm really restless at night.   I think it's pretty normal.   I would never use a prostitute though.  There's NO way to prevent HIV or any other STD, condoms help for most of them, but they're by no means guaranteed.   Consider that most prostitutes have sex with a different guy at least once a night.  Consider these guys have mostly all used other prostitutes as well.   Every prostitute you sleep with is like sleeping with 1,000 other people at once, and you're pretty much guaranteed to get an STD of some kind.|`|AA11587429	I'd avoid the prostitute.  Don't worry, you will meet someone sometime.  I didn't think it was possible, but I finally found somebody as quirky as me who appreciated me for who I am.<br>  <br>  I'm 27 and have never had sex with a girl.  Not even kissed one.  I've fooled around with a guy, but never hard core sex.  I suppose it's just not a priority for me.|`|67yVH8maaa	just get a pocket *****...your local sex store will have one!|`|jGKGlxAuaa	You must be some serious dweeb. Prostitutes are not your answer. Work on being friends with some normal girls, and nature will take its course.<br>  <br>  You are not normal.
Ukw1JUNcaa	If you really don't think he will change, at the very least stay until you have somewhere else to live, a job, a way to support yourself and a way to look like you can support your daughter if you get a divorce. Your husband probably just thinks it's funny to do these things to you.<br>  <br>  Something that might help is if you slept in a different bedroom than he did. A lot of couples nowadays are doing this since sharing a room didn't seem to work (snoring, smoking, lots of reasons). If anything you definitely should NOT feel bad about being annoyed with him because his manners are disgusting and rude! He shouldn't be treating anyone that way *especially* his wife AFTER she asks him to stop.<br>  <br>  Also I wouldn't talk to him about possibly getting a divorce until you had a way to support yourself on your own, because I see him as just throwing the house payment thing in your face again. If you have the possibility for a job and a house, and a way to support your daughter, the idea of taking his daughter away from him will be way more scary.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I hope his manners improve.|`|5vO61nuvaa	Staying together for the kids sake is not a good idea. All that usually ends up happening is that your feelings will grow and grow and eventually you'll just have a breakdown. If you really feel that you don't want to be married to him anymore then now is the time to see if 1. it can be fixed ( by means of counseling or other ways) or 2. make the break as clean as possible. That way you can retain a friendship with your husband and your daughter isn't effected as negatively. Good luck, and I hope everything turns out fine.|`|qZ0310yVaa	i wood go that is no place for your little girl he is a animal

Maybe it just wasn't meant to be. He could have moved on since then. It might take some time, but I think you're going to have to get over him.|`|uM8O5Q5maa	Try to be friends with him again, then see how it goes from there.

NQFV2AdZaa	Why don't you try confidence building classes at your local college? We have them in Scotland, so you most likely have them too, just go along and you will be amongst other people who are in the same boat as you and you could make new friends and build your confidence up too, good luck!
zTVO39a2aa	This is a tough situation to be in because it you and him start dating and then break up down the line,your friendship will probably suffer on the other hand it could be the best move you ever made.I personally wouldn't do it because it isn't worth even taking the chance to lose a friendship.These kinds of situations usually never work out for the good but it may or may not in your case.i know this isn't the answer or comment you probably wanted to read but it ultimately is up to you ,are you strong enough to deal with it and stay friends if you breakup?Is he strong enough? Take your time sam and think about about the possibilities and then act accordingly.<br>  <br>  very good luck and keep us posted because we care.|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	Depends - do you like him or not?|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Sure.. try it out<br>  <br>  SteveC|`|q7sX6ACraa	if you like him back then go for it, but if you go out with him and then break up it might make your friendship a bit awkward after.<br>  <br>  just try it and see what happens from there :)
i5jNl2Cuaa	JERRY! JERRY!
tRNiXtplaa	No. you said what you wanted to do and him not asking you what movie and time i would feel the same way. a guy that quit me blamed everything on me of why things were not going to work out. Read both of Greg Behrendt's Books He Is Just Not That Into You and Its Called A Break Up because Its Broken.

C5pVfdzwaa	You have both decided that its already over.  You can't be there for him just for his sake and you can't stay married just because he can't take care of himself.  <br>  Let him be responsible for him and you be responsible for you.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	The sooner the better and do it quickly.|`|177a2d13c197cdbca40977f08fc89d45aa	well im young and might not know a lot about marrage or so. but if things arent working out then its best to be honest. it takes two to make the relation work. and love is set on both partners being just as strong togather and can over come anything. but if one is not fully their than the relationship is off balanced. just talk to him. have a little meeting togather when you both arent bissy and put it forward on how you feel. its really up to you. i hope i helped a little. good luck.|`|421b1247395dca6ee67c1d6b736731a7aa	Wow, this sounds so much like my first marriage I could have written it myself.<br>  <br>  Key words.. "the passion is gone."  Once that's gone, it's a very difficult thing to get back. It's possible, but not likely, and he would have to show some distinct changes. It doesn't sound like you want to put forth the effort and patience to see those changes, either.<br>  <br>  I can't figure out based on this if you are currently living with him or not. Either way, the cleaner the break, the better. If you truly think he's going to flip out and hurt himself or something, I would suggest to him that we attend couples counseling. Then you can tell him how you feel it is over during the safety of a counseling session, and the counselor will be able to deal with him if he falls apart.  He will also have someone to see afterwards to help him through it. It sounds like he needs therapy anyway.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|t8swfyD4aa	if you are seriously going to leave then you should just tell him straight out.  I hope that you really think about it before you do, I mean its so easy to just leave a marriage now. Sometimes people leave just because they can. Why dont you try a trial seperation first? That way you can see what your life will be like without this man. Its harder than people think to never see someone again.  If he truly is a recoving alcoholic than your leaving wont interfer with that. You cant stay and be a cructh for anyone. Do you have children together? I hope you really think about it before you do anything. Try reading these books " the proper care and feeding of husband" and " the proper care and feeding of marriage" they might help you. Good luck whatever you do.

She has said she will stop drinking, but she has no incentive to because she knows you will stick around. Sometimes you just have to leave her and tell her that you will support her while she gets help, but you cannot live with her or even spend time with her until she heals herself. You are being an enabler for her, and she will never stop as long as you are around<br>  <br>  If you leave, she is then forced to make the decision what she loves more - you or the booze. And if it's the booze, then you will be glad you got out of that mess. She will only pull you down and you'll end up depressed, or even turning to alcohol or drugs yourself to try and dull the pain she is causing you|`|x3EPqezJaa	What can you do? You can go to an Al-Anon meeting and talk with other people who are the loved ones of alcoholics, and get advice.<br>  <br>  You can also LEAVE HER!!! Yeah, I get that you love her, but you're not doing her a favor by being her enabler. She won't get well till she hits bottom. And you also need to TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF! The person you fell in love with isn't going to magically come out one day. And the person you fell in love with can't be separated from the person who abuses you every day!! You have fallen into the typical trap of the abused person. Providing excuses for her, losing perspective and staying in the relationship... <br>  <br>  For both your sakes, YOU NEED TO BREAK UP WITH HER!!!<br>  <br>  Many abusers know how to manipulate and control. They put on a facade that attracts people, and then once they've got them, they attack and abuse, keeping the person from leaving by providing just enough charm to make them stay. That's likely what's happening here.<br>  <br>  LEAVE!!!|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Al-Anon may be a good place to start.

If she don't quit drinking she will only end up hurting herself and hurting you more in the long run.  You need to get her to admit she needs help and you need to let her know that you are not going to continue enabling her and that you will leave if she does not get help.  Talk to her when she is sober.  Good luck - your in a tough spot|`|EFOBeGu4aa	Try googling Alanon.  They can help you and there are usually local chapters everywhere.  First of all, you didn't cause it, you can't control it and you can't cure it.  But having people you can trust to discuss these issues with is helpful.  Most are dealing with love ones just like you are.  Its easier to leave than to keep putting up with the abuse, but if you really love her you'll find ways to continue your relationship and maybe even help her to become a happier person.  Then again, you may decide that you just don't have the strength to continue the relationship.  Eventually, you'll get tired of the abuse, the drama and the trouble that comes with alcoholic temper tantrums.  Its her problem and she is heaping it on you.  God Bless and hope you can find some help before she does too much more damage.  You are being physically and emotionally abused.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	join Al-Anon.<br>  <br>  you're dealing with the addiction and not the person.  Until she's willing to do something about the addiction then you're stuck with this abusive violent shrew she becomes when she's drunk.<br>  <br>  Just like she's the one who has to hit bottom and make the decision to get clean.  You have to be the one to decide when you've finally had enough and you're ready to leave.  Until one or both of those things happen you need to join your local chapter of al-anon to learn how not to enable her in her self-destruction and how to preserve your sanity while you figure out what would be best for you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|IvMPh09baa	OK, STOP!

AA12034666	Yes, it is mean. Have you ever heard of Karma? The rule is that whatever goes around comes back around. That means that if you are mean to someone now, someone will be mean (or even meaner) to you at some point. But if you are nice to others, nice things will come your way. You should always try to build Good Karma, and avoid Bad Karma.<br>  <br>  You don't have to actually like someone, but you don't have to be mean, either. You don't have to seek out her friendship, but God wants to treat all of His children with respect.|`|i5MiFhMyaa	Why would you be mean to anyone that hasn't hurt you?<br>  <br>  Being nice is always better.|`|gbj9Uoaaaa	Be pleasant it does not cost anything.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It's quite mean.|`|R7FtrsMQaa	well you really have not said why you don't want to be nice to her , it is very sad that she has no friends, that is not good for a persons confidence or self esteem, but yea that is kinda mean if she has given you no reason to feel this way , you never know you two could become very good friends if the chance was given. it is hard to say because there is not enough information , although I don't like to be mean to anyone , I like to follow the Golden Rule "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you" good luck to you and she.|`|qBz0ZfzFaa	You don't have to be nice to her if you don't like her. But please don't be mean to her. So many people get their self-esteem ruined for life in middle school or high school. Just ignore her and don't take part in it if others are being mean to her. Trust me, you won't feel good about yourself if you are mean to her.|`|XNnx8aquaa	What are you talking about? Has she been mean to you?

Because snobby people didn't want to take the time to simply BE NICE!  It's not a hard thing to do! <br>  <br>  So you don't wanna be her best friend, who cares...but at least be nice!

DfKdzD46aa	this is all over myspace. my goodness. who cares if he doesnt want to be your friend on myspace. maybe he is the type of person that only likes to have his close friends be his friends on myspace because he thinks its ridiculous that some people have thousands of friends and doesnt want to be like that. so maybe he told you someone else deleted you because he didnt want to hurt your feelings. this is a possibility. there is no reason to get your mom involved<br>  <br>  but maybe he really doesnt want to be your friend in which case dont bother being his friend. everybody doesnt have to be friends with everybody.

2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	We're happily married... What makes it successful? Hmm. Initial compatibility plays a big role, as well as treating each other like the most important person in the world. Willingness to compromise. Kindness. Patience. Caring attitude.|`|AA11969451	Openness, communication, listening, and of course the ability to compromise and forgive.|`|woPLfLQbaa	my marriage is successfully because of the "I" time, "your" time and "us" all in a health balance.

Its your fam against the world.  someone to do anything anywhere for any reason you want.  And when those hard times arrive, Have sex.

5gG2OfHIaa	You seem to have a good sense of humor.  Example:  "they want a girl that is skinny and has big boobs."   The remark may be generally true; but, your phrasing of it is kind of funny and to the point!  I guess the best suggestion I have is to join a group that shares one of your interests.  If you enjoy a typical "guy sport" like fishing, then mingle with a fishing club.   Learn a new sport like trap shooting in which there is no real gender bias.  Not to be fixated on sports; but,  I kind of feel you need to find a group in which has some guys and a 5'8", 115 lb. body type  is not a requirement for a gal to draw attention.  I think at any age, most guys and gals wake up and realize that F-U-N is a whole lot more important than drop-dead good looks.  For 90 percent of the population, anyway.  Finding an activity that you enjoy and allows you to mingle is key to turning around your romantic fortunes.  Good luck.|`|feoxRAUDaa	upload your pic.  then we can give you better advise...|`|JCdBSULraa	I disagree with the big boobs, but pretty much every guy dislikes fatness.

1jIzBUkhaa	what I would do is find something that you Truly love like a dog, cat, or some kind of animal. you could go out and meet new friends to get your mind off of him.
twplQSQAaa	i have a friend and omg same storyy. u should still keep your cool  flirt back every once in a while let him know your interested still but dont give in to much. observe his actions and that should signal if your the only girl he is currently going after. make him work for a chance and dont let your guard down too easily keep it up but dont back down on any interesting related conversations. <br>  # 1 girl rule. LET HIM COME TO YOU!!!!!
unVj43Xxaa	Obviously, you don't hear what you are saying because you are in a one-sided, abusive relationship. The only advise you should consider is to get rid of this guy because what he is showing you is not love or compassion or any type of caring. This is a selfish guy that has no thought of your feelings or well being. You need to get yourself together and move on. There is no reason for anyone to live their life with such a low quality of happiness. Be single until you realize you are a great person and if you don't believe it tell yourself that in the mirror every day (even if you don't want to) till you do! Become independent of any man so when or if you run across a guy like this in the future you can tell him to get lost and not think twice. When you can do all this your inner confidence and beauty will shine through and it is then that you will attract a guy worth keeping!<br>  <br>  Edited to say: Go see a doctor.|`|bs8ug3Vjaa	what the hell are u talking about?|`|XwMn6aY5aa	what?i think if he really loved you he would respect your decision..and you say your bleeding alot i think you should go to a doctor right away that's not normal and if he has pain he should also go asap!But the main thing is respect yourself and he should follow your decision.good luck and take care :)|`|NqTi3sOtaa	huh?
K8OjmMUAaa	That's a weird thing to get upset about. No, I don't think you're the bad guy. There's nothing wrong with being interested in what she does! To be honest, it sounds like she may have something to hide, if she's getting so bent out of shape over a few simple questions.|`|soUND2xEaa	just tell her you have bad memory|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	she sounds like a miserble *****! Run as fast as you can!|`|AA11841749	Absolutely not.  Maybe y'all could sit down one day, and she could show you the website.  That's a strange thing to get upset about.|`|U3tZzGlgaa	I wouldn't call you the "bad guy", but I would call you the "clueless guy".  You have to respect the feelings of women and see things from their point of view.  She's already clued you in on the fact that she doesn't really want to talk about her job any more than she already has.  It may be that she's not proud of her job, or that some parts of it may be embarrassing, even if you don't think so.  There's other things to talk about right?  Start focusing on things that you both WANT to talk about instead of focusing on your interests only.  Being a good listener is key to a good relationship.  It sounds like you need more practice at that.

Second you do not mention if he has a job if he does then when you apply for a single mothers pension you will have to sign forms that he is the father so they can and will chase up the maintenance,and last i know it must be difficult to be on your own at this time,how ever you can make new friends if you have none and i hope your parents ar ok and showing there love for you,there is a program unlike yahoo or msn called paltalk,it has different rooms for music support and others there is a free version to it i use it my nic is in_the_corner feel free to say hi i hope all works out for you stay safe.And last on the subject question you cannot save a marriage or relationship for the children only how ever the man should be supporting you both mentally and emotional after all he did love you at sometime and he is the Father(assumption)|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Yes, this is a mess. Yes, you  have little recourse. The only recourse - which is also called leverage - is not to let him see your son. Yes, legally this is all your responsibility. But sometimes, a father, seeing his likeness propagated, will feel pangs of guilt and remorse and look after his likeness.<br>  <br>  So the best I can do for you, is to recommend that you do not contact him and decline information about his offspring unless he comes up with some help.|`|GegQJNzSaa	Get a lawyer. The state will provide you a lawyer if you can not afford one. I'll tell you like it is too. Never have a baby out of wedlock! I have all girls,I've told them ever since they were little that if you can't afford to take care of a baby alone, then don't have one at all. I have one grandson. My daughters husband died right after his son was born. Drove face first into a tree while drinking. But my daughter was on her feet when this all happened,and is still on her feet 4 years later. She calls me everyday from 2000 miles away cause I do give sound advice.|`|mQhSxCpoaa	He's messed up twice.<br>  He wants to have his cake and eat it too. It wants to see his kid whenever he wants but, he doesn't want to make the effort to help support his own child.<br>  Run the paperwork. Go to a lawyer and petition for sole custody. I say you would grounds. Tape record him if he starts talking about how his kid is 'boring' again. Get all the evidence that you can. <br>  If you don't necessarily want sole custody, hit him HARD for some child support. You don't deserve to have to raise a child you both wanted by yourself and let him get away with it.
jik0I8oDaa	kind of...it doesnt bother me.<br>  but when its all about him, buy a freakin mirror and marry your self!!!|`|ibR6jJgHaa	Hell No|`|PWN5rqgxaa	conceded? as in giving up... a quitter?<br>  <br>  or conceited? as in stuck on themselves?
9d312c80f895f20c08272dd2fd60c61aaa	abercrombie body|`|0SQou2X9aa	i think really muscular guys look ridiculous.<br>  just a bit of muscle,u know,atheletic build is perfect.|`|AA11433436	um, a happy medium. i dont want him to be like bulgingly ripped like a wrestler, but i do want him to have some muscle mass.|`|WY0shRKdaa	Hockey players-not too muscular and also very athletic|`|Wqo62Pjsaa	Kinda. It depends on age to be honest. but I like a guy who's strength hasn't gone to his head.
W3u8qCbhaa	he is probably just shy or taking his time, give him time or initiate<br>  a relationship|`|vkPlX2Y4aa	Please...move on. For your sake. He's not interested at all.|`|0N0lRiEGaa	nah babe he aint into you n he dont wanna hurt u coz ya mates<br>  sorry =[<br>  there plenty other boys out there hun
Nt1Tz3zuaa	i think that guy likes you and wants to ask you out but hes nervous so he has his friends hint it to you. just start talking to him and see where things go from there, im pretty sure hes just shy
thmlwAZDaa	you are just another play thing to him. Don't get involved with that because he just going to break your heart.
PujesDcIaa	Why would you sit there in think it wont work, if you haven't tried? I say you should go for it.  Not to heavy at first though but talk to him ask him to go to the movies or some type of activity when he has time and make sure he doesnt have a girlfriend. If you take baby steps at a time i think you would be suprised that he may even like you back if he doesnt know you like him things will never go any where. Good luck  =]<br>  BYE!<br>  victoria|`|fR9KdYPpaa	Go for it, you really should. else ur going to spend the rest of ur life thinking "what if?"|`|AA10743159	Yes you are right it is a crush, and it happens to many teenagers, we all have gone through it, and it's like going through a wringer. It leaves you wrung out.<br>  You can do one or two things, one, start dating some other boy, and get in to a real relationship, or talk to your crush and find out, how he feels about you.<br>  As you say, you don't even think he knows how  you feel, and just because you have a crush on him, doesn't mean, he will feel the same towards you.<br>  I know these feeling, sound fatal, but they aren't and they do pass.  You can blame it on hormones, or just being young.|`|XZbYHcHiaa	Actually,it's a crush. You'll have to wait for it to go away or make a move. True love is never so intense. I remember when i first saw Cameron Diaz , i was breathless and was gulping!!. That has happened to me many times and all i've realized is that they were just infatuations. I guess you're a teen, so your hormones are raging, they do that quite often and sometimes when you're single you look at somebody, you get infatuated bcos you're lonely. So be bold and make a move. Boys seldom dislike when a girl comes on to them.|`|va4dh98baa	I completely understand where you are coming from.  Sometimes feelings for certain people overtake what your head knows is the right thing to do.  Once you fall for someone it is really hard to forget them and that could be why your emotions are so hard to control.  In time everything will eventually will be better.|`|w1kxVQqzaa	WAT EVER FORGET HIM UR BETTER THAN DAT|`|eXpZD0vlaa	Gather up some courage and throw caution to the wind and go up to him and ask to speak to him alone for a few minutes.  Then tell him that you like him and you wanted him to know.  Give him a few seconds to respond.  If he gets all nervous and doesn't know what to say, tell him he doesn't have to say anything and repeat that you just wanted him to know and walk away.<br>  <br>  Crushes happen all the time.  You're probably young so liking someone is not something your mind can figure out properly yet and your body just reacts to what your mind can't deal with.|`|8t24Xmm9aa	you cannot forget him because you worry too much so what you need to do is stop because worrying is not fun and neither are parents but that is a different story anyway stop because it is not cool and people do not respect that you do stuf flike that to other people so i would recommend that you do not remember him okay|`|jbPptRhlaa	Man, Exact same thing is happening to me! Weird. <br>  Maybe if you can't forget him (like me) then you LOVE him. I'm not sure about you, but when im alone without him i cry because im not with him. Like I Need him there. but he makes me feel complete. And maybe this is a sign that you two are ment to be. Or maybe it IS just a crush. Sorry not sure what to tel you. :(|`|YsNDkPd4aa	i know what you mean i'm alone  i think what i'm trying to tell you is move on and try to make sure he does not bothered you any more|`|EyZ4bg8Uaa	I would say to maybe talk to him?? or talk to your friend about why it wouldn't work?? Thats a tough one.. Maybe just give it a little more time..|`|dPKkjK8iaa	I fell in love a couple of monthes ago for the first time.  have no clue why,,, but sometimes i still cry over him even though he broke my heart. ( he cheated on me with another girl and then he lied about it... until finally a few days later after i just stopped talking to him all together... he admitted he did it) Gah it hurt... i don't love him anymore... i don't even think that i have much feelings for him left... but still sometimes when i think about some of our inside jokes or hear a song that he loved or really anything that reminds me of him.. i cry.. and it sucks,,, i  don't understand why i do it either. I just think that by us crying it helps us get over it.... ( but i think that you should totally tell him how you feel about him... he might not feel the same but at least you know that you gave it a try) if he doesnt like you than he isnt worth it... and he is a loser anyways... and a new guy will come along... But i understand that he didn't break your heart... i just think that you like him that much that you cry just thinking about him. Even though that is totally not why i cry. :) good luck :) It will all work out for the best :)
sr7jX2wYaa	Just  say  " You know this is  a little awkward , but I was wondering if you had to define "US" what  would you say?"  I was just wondering  because I keep getting mixed signals, & don't want  to misinterpret anything*
1jIzBUkhaa	Well i really don't know what that means.|`|PNnYTqyzaa	Gender equality is basically assessing laws and legislation etc. to make sure the implications for men and women is equal and fair.<br>  <br>  The ultimate goal of gender mainstreaming is gender equality.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  xx
QUmqfjSuaa	yeah, tell him that he need to clean up his act.<br>  tell him what he did last time &+ how you felt about it.<br>  even if he don't remember what he did last time.<br>  ask him what he would do better this time around.<br>  if you feel like his answers are not good enough,<br>  then tell him y'all are better off as friends.<br>  zay boogayyyy ! :]|`|rkkyNwBqaa	follow your heart.<br>  <br>  pls help <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ahjedc41F.PMPajnnd6EEv_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219123841AANM2wO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|qL6Ai1eVaa	well to meh i think you should do wah you feel and if it means that you wanna talk to him tell him that he needs to call you more and talk to you more and he needs to act like yall go out buh if it was up to meh i would just talk to him on the low and if he is askin you back out just be like no cause when we was goin out you was never callin meh or pickin up my calls you need to talk to meh everytime you can tell him gurl straight like that
4YK4tBW5aa	Sounds like you're ready! Your first time probably won't be mind-blowing, but you have to start somewhere. After you have got some more experience, it will be fan-freakin-tastic! :-) Email me if you have any questions.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	It'll probably be a bit painful, awkward and disappointing. The first time usually is.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	its gonna hurt and its gonna be brief and its gonna suck|`|QQlbvWj4aa	Don't expect too much.<br>  It might be.  Depends how close you are.<br>  And it's kind of hard to explain... it's... not as amazing as you're expecting, most likely.  It's kind of like... "Why is everyone so excited about that?"  It does get better, though.<br>  <br>  I don't know, it's different for everyone.<br>  For me, it was a nice bonding experience, but I really didn't see what all the hype was about.<br>  <br>  And if you're careful, it shouldn't hurt too much.|`|zHI6z5FZaa	don't tell him. just spring it on him after you guys go out, guys love a surprise. just make sure everything is ready. don't be nervous or he'll suspect something.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Perry! ha ha<br>  <br>  Edit- lol sorry. It will all come naturally so stop worrying.|`|TDjTLnTbaa	Umm it's pretty weird the first time, for 1 it might hurt and or you might bleed and second your expectations of it being breathtaking might disapoint you.<br>  I'm a boy  same age as you and the first time I had sex I didn't feel a Thing.... A Thing !!<br>  You don't often remember your first....or you try not to :D|`|y7MsBXdmaa	It may be a bit awkward or it maybe great.<br>  <br>  if he is a virgin as well.. it probably wont be GREAT the first time.<br>  <br>  but just remember to not be tense, you have to be relaxed the first couple pumps will hurt a bit (not terribly).<br>  Best of luck|`|Dujw71Muaa	You should just relax and go with the flow. Everything will be fine. It will feel weird for the first time, but then it'll get better! It's like your in heaven!!! =D|`|lO6zgftaaa	go for it if you know your ready no better time like the preasent :)|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	Whoa!!!!!  You don't want to get a STD?  Has he been sleeping around since you have not yet given it up to him?  That should be a deal breaker if you think that is a possibility.  Are you willing to spend life with a guy who has some disease or was too wrapped up in his own sexual desires to not respect yours?<br>  <br>  Good luck but if it were me I would not do it.|`|VPohcKwGaa	Well, for most people the first time is not too exciting. People tend to be very nervous. For men it feels about the same as cuddling, only with the extra stimulation on the penis. For most women it feels a little odd and it may hurt (most likely will). My first time was fairly painful. The feeling varies from bad to good; depends a lot on the partner. It will feel great if you are in the moment though..make sure you build into it..don't just go straight for sex....you need to heat it up. Someone experienced will guide you through it so you understand what is happening, and will be gentle when it gets a little rough.
T8AvZltDaa	whats wrong with you? You HAVE to TELL her!!!!!! You can let her go into a relationship like that! Especially since statisticly people who cheat almost always repeat! You want you sis to get cheated on AFTER she's married to that low life?!?|`|QzWHMGHJaa	You should have told her right then!  You HAVE to tell her, NOW!  She'll be more devastated if she marries this jerk and he cheats on her then and you KNOW he will!  You can't let her marry this jerk!|`|2KC467tFaa	Save her the time, money, and heartache in the long run. You're her sister. You need to tell her. Be very soft and gentle with your words, and be there for her. We're talking about marriage, not something small like a date. Once married, a break up doesn't happen overnight. It is very long and expensive. Once she does meet a nice person, she may have regrets about being married to a complete jerk before. You cannot allow her to marry someone who obviously isn't serious about the relationship. She needs and deserves someone who has respect and true love for her. If I was in her position, I would want to know. Best of luck to both of you!|`|CQsD09D6aa	I would tell her. Be prepared for her to disbelieve what you say and accuse you of trying to ruin her happiness. "There is none so blind as he who will not see." But at least you will know you tried to warn her.|`|u31B8Ycjaa	girl i dont know why you would even hesitate.<br>  when it was happening you should have called her. <br>  or told her right after work. just tell her so she knows.|`|tKfOcgDlaa	Tell her the truth!|`|yb01tlviaa	you should probably be a good sister and tell her...|`|VZJBHLjAaa	I think you should just tell her because well she is your sister right and<br>  she well be very mad and heartbroken but she will thank you one day <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|n59qRDUHaa	get proof first. Follow him and take some pictures of him and that other chick. Your sis has to know, but she won't believe you if she doesn't see it for herself.|`|RtrqOqosaa	you should sit down with her... <br>  or maybe get him saying it on tape to your face, and then let her listen to the recording.....|`|5oTxOJocaa	Tell her the truth. If she finds out now she'll be devastated, but she'll be able to get over it and move on, but if she finds out after they're married, imagine how she'll feel... Try and show her though rather than just tell her. If she really is in love, then just your words probably won't sway her but instead cause a fall out between you two.|`|65ojSBXgaa	That Pig!!!! You need to be brave!!! If you love your sister you will tell her!! I know I would if a guy cheated on my sister. I love my sister very much she is my best friend forever! And I care about her. So if I were you I would talk to your sister in private ask her questions about how in love and good she thinks her relationship is. When she tells you listen to what she has to say. Then when she asks you “what’s with all the questions?” Tell her what you know tell her the truth about everything you saw, then tell her because you love her, you confronted the jerk and asked him to admit to what he has done and tell her his response was laughter he didn’t care and will do it again. Know that your sister will confront him on this and expect him to say: Your sister is just jealous she wants to be with me or she jealous of us” This needs to be brought to your sis attention too tell her you don’t want to interfere in their relationship but what you saw is true everything else is a lie! You told her because you love her and don’t want her to live a lie!! Then if she still don’t believe it take her to your job and search for the other woman and let your sister ask the question you will be there to back her up!!! Good luck kiddo! And don’t give up!!! Don’t be afraid please!!!! You must stop this and hurry time is ticking!!!! -Gail|`|jg9w6IbQaa	i found out my sister's boyfriend was cheating on her. i told her right away. no matter how devastated she might be, you need to tell her. especially if she's going to marry him! i know any woman would hate to marry a man and then find out months later that he's cheating on her. that would lead to a divorce, not just a break up. i say tell her as soon as you can. even if it's through a freaking text message.|`|t8swfyD4aa	you know what i have a sister, and i would believe her over any man any day of the week. Men lie, and sadly it sounds like your sisters going to find that out the hard way. If you dont tell her shes going to end up sad anyway because he will cheat on her while their married, and if you do tell her she might not believe you. I think you should tell her because when he cheats on her again later and she finds out you knew all along shell be more mad at you than at him. Good luck.|`|d62c3409e8c4719f41d413a7c4a07efeaa	You need to tell her asap when she does tie the knot and this happens to her again you will regret telling her,she needs to know this guy is a two timing no good man to get married to!Good luck!So what if he never likes you again she is your sister you have to protect her not him!|`|9w91NXGfaa	You as her sister cannot let her marry this guy. Who knows why he is even marrying her if hes cheating on her even before the wedding. I think you need to talk to your sister's boyfriend. Confront him completely, and tell him that he should tell your sister, and ask him why he is marrying her. Tell him its wrong and he better tell her or you will. Wait a day, and if he dosen't tell her, talk to her. Tell her the whole story, what you saw, what he said, everything. If you were already opposed to the marriage be careful because she might  think you are trying to sabotage the wedding, if you guys are close then she might believe you. You seriously have to get this out in the open. I know it would be hard, but it would be better for the wedding to be called off now, rather than getting a divorce and her having to split everything with him.|`|G4GUJyOeaa	Girl. This is your sister. If you don't tell her I sure will. He ain't no good. Your going to wait til she married this man and the cheating get worse. My sister married a dog. She was hurt, he marred my sister knowing he was already married. Now your sister going to marry one. Yeah she will be hurt then it's going to come down choosing which one she is going to believe but why would you make this up? Tell her. Don't let her marry without knowing. If she do know and still marry him then let her be.|`|S1IxBEqlaa	You absolutely need to tell your sister. Tell her in a way that she knows you're serious and not just trying to mess up her relationship out of jealousy or spite. If this guy is cheating on her, he's going to make a terrible husband, and she will get way more hurt in the long run. It's important that you tell her the truth now and let her decide what she wants to do with the information.
lNybehpoaa	Go to Build a Bear & make her a teddy. <br>  It's more personal & you can record you saying something in it or make the bear remind her of youu.<br>  Flowers are really nice too! (make sure it's her favorite kind too)<br>  I would hang out with her a little bit at the party and then ask her to dinner. You don't have to say, "I really like you." You can just say, "I had a really good time with you tonight. Would you be up for dinner this weekend?" Play it cool ;)<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|ukymQZSvaa	well dude i think you should get her flowers or some thing that she really likes like her favorite movie how 2 ask her out Idk but you can also try in collage|`|ER0mpJStaa	Thx for answering my question, first of all!<br>  I never get romantic guys like you and nobody did something like what you want to do. The gift is good but make sure is more original so everytime she looks at it, thinks of you. I think asking out should wait after her b-day.See how she reacts on the thing that you are going with a gift and how happy she looks to see you.|`|UxbjvAaRaa	Oh this would be cool, make like a sign thing and stick it in her yard,<br>  asking her to dinner on it, and like it says happy birthday and every thing.<br>  then; call her that evening, and see what she says. If she says yes<br>  then bring her a teddy bear; (you could propabbly get a gift card somewhere she likes to shop. && teck it in the teddy bear somewhere)<br>  *& at dinner take her to like somewhere kind of fancy but not too fancy/<br>  AppleBs or something.<br>  I think that would be sweet. <br>  <br>  If you don't like what i just told you then just go to her door step.|`|aicgxiYtaa	A ROSE..RIGHT HER NAME IN EACH PETAL...GET HER A BOX OF CHOCOLATES..LOL
d5COR2S2aa	you like things that you can't get. once you realize that she maybe DOES like you, your interest starts to wane. this is actually sorta normal; a lot of people tend to be more intrigued by the chase rather than the catch.|`|sCr2iTczaa	I used to be like that... I think you in general just like the chase. I mean i was like that... i would like a guy then found out he liked me and then i would have a different crush.. I think it is all about ego really. But that doesn't happen with me any more that phase is long gone.|`|cgQrQSvDaa	you liked the chase of trying to get her to like you and now that she does your not that into her anymore that happens. I'd say to stop talking to her like that tho so you dont lead her on thats just mean.|`|RjGGsPInaa	trust me u know u like a girl when u get butterflies when you see her|`|UxbjvAaRaa	People seem to like people who don't like them. <br>  And then it happens. The other person starts to like<br>  him/her and then the attraction goes away. Just don't talk<br>  to her soo much, and space out a bit. Things will get better<br>  but i can't garentee you'll still have your attraction to her.|`|TrEYixLXaa	This is because we all want what we cant have.  Since you thought you would never have a chance with her, that attracted you to her more, it happens with everyone.  And now since you know you CAN have her, you dont want her anymore.  It's the game we all love to play.|`|OJXfV529aa	Just move on, you obviously didnt know her well enough to like her before, so now since your getting to know her and your not attracted to her, maybe you should just try being friends. MAKE SURE NOT TO LEAD HER ON.|`|MTPoGd1qaa	You are probably getting to know her and she doesn't hold the same attraction you thought she would! Like you don't like what she is really like.<br>  <br>  Or maybe its like you would prefer her as a friend??|`|zxdgYPBSaa	Ah its the whole thing that men love the hunt more than the catch itself, get used to it|`|aicgxiYtaa	HER PERSONALITY SUCKS|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Make your mind up! the last thing a girl likes is a wishy washy man.|`|r6oaBPhiaa	when youuu know , tell us please|`|VFdC2wPlaa	You probably don't really like her anymore, because you are getting to know her better. Sometimes you think you like someone because you like the way they act or look. Once you get to know them better you could lose that attraction, because she isn't really how you thought she was.|`|f6YVLtk1aa	that happens to me alot.....its knda saddd...try to talk less with her so maybe you wont get so tired of her so fast.....give it some break and after that get to know her little bit better, im sur you will come across really loving her after all. And you just may stop losing that feeling towards this girl|`|ynWDXyg4aa	because people want what they can't have. and now that you see you can have it, you don't really care.but just go back and realize what it was that made her so attractive in the first place, and maybe you'll get that feeling back|`|QYA2dWmTaa	oh damnit. i hope you're name isn't nickkk ):<br>  anyways, i'd talk to her inperson, hang out.<br>  enough with the messaging. people can't<br>  get to know eachother by using the computer.<br>  well.. they can but they cant get much farther.|`|uM8O5Q5maa	Now that the chase is gone you probably aren't as excited about it. Remind yourself that at one time it was what you wanted and keep going for it. Once it happens you'll wonder why you ever questioned yourself.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped :)|`|JScCYZ8daa	maybe wat made you like her in the first place was that you could not figure her out . now that you have its not fun anymore and you really would rather be her friend .|`|7tIdoDpMaa	yerr probably the typee that is like. i want this girl. and yer detiremined.<br>  like when shes playing hard to get.<br>  but when you get her.. that attractionn is gone cause shes yours.|`|bqxAasHCaa	Call her or talk to her in person. You're probably just getting bored exchaning standard txt messages with her.|`|uUqPOppoaa	You probably need to see her in person more, I get like that sometimes, go out with her and have a refresher-date haha..|`|LSWnwRjEaa	well, i dunno if youve heard that when you dont have things you want them more but when you have them you lose intrest.|`|grRGlNWhaa	you only want something most when you know you can't have it. she needs to play hard to get.|`|BdeoYKokaa	Because she's probably a beeeoooootch and you just figured it out. Nail her anyway|`|Gdyvdcqxaa	you are probably just seeing her REAL self and I guess that turns you off!<br>  youve ahd turn on's and turn offs forever... <br>  i guess boring texts are a turn off|`|lhkwrxx0aa	maybe by getting to know her you don't like her as much as you thought.|`|ZhZKHdkNaa	because your used to liking girls that play hard to get. Or maybe you just don't like her personality??|`|8t24Xmm9aa	is she fat|`|GzBkproMaa	I guess you just wanted something so bad that when you finally got it you decided she's not worth it.|`|TxSgCzcUaa	Its because You always want something you cant have.<br>  Now that you see that she wants you.<br>  Your Not wanting her the same way
SNjjQQGdaa	well it's not a good thing but if you are a true friend you wouldn't go that far. but than again if your friend don't mind then do what you think is best|`|dsphYli4aa	its okay as long as you know he's not going to get really anoyed with you. and you know he's completely over her!
QODJNf1oaa	She probably doesn't realize how serious your unhappiness in the marriage is. I don't think that you should leave right away, especially since you both have a son together until you put the effort that it takes to work on your issues. Maybe it's the way your telling her how you feel, you should sit down with her and tell her how unhappy you've been and the seriousness of the issue. Maybe pull back a little, don't be there as much and see how she reacts to that. Marriage counceling works wonders, and since you two were together for so long you shouldn't end it without trying everything possible to stay together.|`|Jqg7Hvfiaa	That's marriage for you.|`|VXQFT341aa	Try to work it out atleast for your child . Maybe go to family counseling. You and your mate that is. Good luck.|`|2KC467tFaa	Instead of demanding change, try sitting down and having an actual conversation. Express how you feel. Don't use any phrases that imply "blame" or expectations. Just be open and honest with each other. Chances are likely that both of you have changed, not just her. Be patient and try not to raise your voice. If you feel yourself getting fired up, take a break, go for a walk, and try again after you've cooled off. I don't know what the situation is, but put yourself in her shoes before the conversation. It will make you a bit more empathetic. Maybe you two have drifted apart and she simply misses you. There's no real way to know unless you talk to her. When you're open with your feelings, it shows her it's ok for her to open up as well. Try to view both of you as a team. After all, you are married. Good luck!|`|wia9SXCPaa	Marriage is give and take - good and bad -sickness and health.  You get the picture.<br>  <br>  Be honest with her about what bothers you and you might be surprised how she handles it.  Always communicate no mater how things work out if you don't talk about it the problem wont go away!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dD5uhH8naa	I think you should tough it out and see what happens|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	HOW can you have a Son together?   It doesn't belong to one of you   EEEEEWWWW|`|AA11988503	If you're married then you probably promised to love her and be devoted to her for the rest of your life... so start making good on your promise. You can't just tell someone they need to change and expect it to happen overnight. Have some deep conversations about it. Don't just tell her what to do or else you'll be guilty of the same things you claim she's doing. Come to some sort of an agreement. Don't expect life to be perfect the very next day. If you guys can't work things out, get counseling. Don't throw away a marriage just because things get tough.
ce4DZs0maa	what exactly is the g-spot?<br>  It is the bean-shaped, spongy tissue of the paraurethral gland, which is analogous to the male prostate. The actual area is only about the size of a quarter, but it feels rougher to the touch than the surrounding tissue. Because the G-spot is composed of erectile tissue, it swells up when blood rushes to it -- especially if you learn how to master the woman's G-spot effectively.<br>  <br>  It is located about one to two inches back from the vaginal opening inside the front vaginal wall. The "front" wall is the wall of the vagina on the same side as her belly button. <br>  the best way to find the g-spot<br>  First of all, the G-spot is easiest to locate when a woman is sexually aroused, so don't stint on your foreplay first. (You knew I would get that in!)<br>  <br>  To locate and master the woman's G-spot, face your partner while she is lying on her back and insert your index or long middle finger into her vagina as far as it will easily go. Then crook it up toward yourself in a "come hither" motion, sliding your fingertip along the top of the vagina until you find an area that is rougher than the rest of that vaginal wall. (Make sure you have your fingernails clipped short and buffed before you do this -- sharp fingernails will definitely spoil the effort.) This rough or slightly ridged area is the "G-spot," and touching it will often cause a woman to react with surprise or pleasure|`|e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	an orgasm can be reached with/without sex.<br>  <br>  but definately by the stimulation of the clitoris.<br>  <br>  have fun trying to find that !|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Well if you finger her for 40 minutes and she really isn't than maybe.|`|lYjweuZmaa	I have faked a lot. but i do it bc it turns my man on and that's all that matters.i think you should f*uck her.... let her ride you on top til she orgasms and then you ll know the difference. if she pants louder. moans harder and drops her jaw.<br>  <br>  don't take it as a bad thing that she fakes it. at least she pretends to make you feel like your doing a well job. then again if you are her first whatever then she may not know how to express herself. tell her just to let loose!!! teehee. lol. i didn't know what to do at first ... my first orgasm i said """ ooh lala """ hahahahahahahahahaha<br>  <br>  total|`|12cf992b9e3bfa0dfa45a7e584faaef2aa	90% of women fake it..LOL
k0Ewe7mCaa	It's a lot more common than you'd think.|`|YnB1XU1caa	no..|`|EyaqiWPwaa	well...if chicks make him a lot of sandwiches how do you think he got so cocky!!!
S7RN9mKUaa	Definantly. my friend is the cockiest son of a B i've ever known and he has had so many gf's but be careful cause sometimes the cocky ones are players. just watch out for that.|`|5742f42413c66d8b66fad646f72dea1eaa	Its not the cockiness itself. Girls just dont want to date a guy who is boring and has nothing in his life that he is proud of. Its the inner confidence that comes with accomplishments that turns them on. You have to have an attitude of "Ya this girl is really pretty and I want her, but I dont need her. I have too many things going on in my life to get caught up in her opinion of me." Thats what girls and human beings in general like. Theres a respect that grows there.<br>     Matter of fact, think about it...would you want to date a girl who's really boring and has nothing to do except check up on you?? Dont know about u but I like my ladies with a little attitude.|`|OwhIxk88aa	Actually yes, if you act like your the cockiest guy in town, and push aroung the lady you want, then your most likely to get your girl. Im married with 3 children. Trust me.|`|8zntHht7aa	Yes,..I have always been more attracted to slightly cocky guys. It just shows confidence, and it's a def turn on for most women. As long as the guy isn't cocky in a really mean way.|`|MAsnWWycaa	Of course it's true, girls are attracted to strength and confidence and that "cocky edge" shows strength and confidence.|`|9RtdvLEKaa	Confidence, yes.  Cockiness, no!  Just be sure of yourself but don't try to show off too obviously and that's attractive.  Let them know you know what you're doing but don't show off.|`|rbXCALUhaa	OMG yes! looool<br>  my best friend is like the cockiest guy on earth! he always says hes awesome and i'm ALMOST as awesome as he is.. and frankly i love that about him!<br>  its adorable!<br>  but too much gets annoying :P|`|YHrelMGCaa	Depends.<br>  Sometimes I like it, because it shows they are confident.<br>  Other times it just annoys me.|`|aPuefPuFaa	nope. big TURN OFF.<br>  that is unatractive.|`|N1Wc8JPTaa	Unfortunately so, yes.|`|XXatDFnKaa	Yeahh<br>  <br>  i do kinda like arrogant guys iswell =/|`|dtM5je26aa	yesss becausee very few guys have confidencee and slightly cocky shows ittt :]|`|UzmfIaYiaa	yea. well i do a lot off my friends do to. but not everyone|`|dueKTHXxaa	definitely. just makes them look confident, i suppose.|`|D4oMwlhsaa	Yep...<br>  Only if the guys can do it right!!!|`|Vka09geaaa	yeah but not too cocky!|`|Q48p7OYjaa	no you can be confident and not cocky i hate cocky|`|SsB7aRExaa	Only the dimbulbs.|`|7THgBSvfaa	Yeah.. I will admit I do.. But I think we a guy if slightly cocky is confident and I don't want a guy who doesn't have any confidence in himself..|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Cocky and arrogant pretty much meaning the same thing, no. When I meet a cocky or arrogant guy the first impression that I get is that he's full of himself. That is a complete turn-off. There's nothing worse than a guy who is in love with himself and thinks he's a bad-@ss.|`|W4Dek41Jaa	Cocky guys are unattractive.  Guys that think to good of themselves, girls just look at them like disgusting.  :) When I see a guy and there all like, ' Dam I look good ' I look at them like, wtf?|`|SNjjQQGdaa	some girls like boys like that like me myself i love when a boy is cocky|`|htWw0OlCaa	No... That doesn't do it for me.|`|wi6mkT30aa	That's a hard question because every girl see this differently!<br>  <br>  I personaly hate guys like that. A mans personlaity is what makes him greater, cuter, funnier...stuff like that. If hes an @$$ or a highly known cocky person who is over confident it is such a turn off!<br>  <br>  <br>  Other girls may see that differently though....|`|IbF2rs9qaa	weelllll.... for the midddle school girls (in my area) tend to like that.<br>  but if your talking high school then i say proabably yeah. <br>  but i don't care if you act tough, as long as you be yourself.  losing your identity is not worth a person. be yourself.|`|LXpjIH0Haa	Depends on the girl and it depends if the guy has something to be cocky about. If he's a loser and is full of himself then who would want to spend time with him?|`|OJXfV529aa	Confident guys are hot.<br>  Not cocky, its annoying.|`|cgQrQSvDaa	Oh yes! at least I do anyways lol. But not when they are to overly cocky or into themselves to much thats just annoying.|`|FSMpMA9saa	ah haha yes my friend bt not all the times only sometimes|`|RAatxTeSaa	SOME GRLS!|`|fBdtvrWdaa	yep
M1u6fdZCaa	Good for her...if you wasn't the typical male loser, then this would have never happened.  Maybe next time you'd appreciate what you have when you've got it.<br>  <br>  May sound mean, but you need to learn that the grass is not always greener on the other side...take care of the "grass" you have instead of watering around it.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	You sound like you don't care who is there, as long as you have somebody. You can't break up with girls, decide you want them back, change your mind, go back to another.. That's not cool!  Stay single for a while until you realize how to be in a relationship.
NKYy41qAaa	Do your own thing!<br>  Don't listen to what other people have to say.<br>  I know you've probabaly heard this a million times, but it shouldn't matter what other people think about him.

They know what they're saying, I mean people's opinions do matter, right?<br>  <br>  /sarcasm.<br>  <br>  But really, are you actually gonna listen to them? Who cares what the think. If you love the guy, then you love him. You shouldn't give a f^ck about anyone's opinion.|`|Gkjqh8hxaa	if you ordered a beef curry and your mates didnt like beef curry would you order something else or try what they order, you try what you like not what everybody else likes, as long as he is not lazy and accident prone go for it,|`|XJSOToRGaa	Why would you even have to ask this?<br>  <br>  Are you a sheep?

0lCCuBxfaa	You're not hopeless, don't worry!<br>  And if being fat is really making you feel bad, you should try to get into a sport, or at least try to eat healthy. <br>  <br>  Here is a good website that can help you keep track of how much you are eating (sometimes, people don't even know that they are eating too much!):<br>  www.caloriecount.about.com<br>  <br>  Something I like to do is work out a little during commercials when I watch TV. That way its in little spurts so it's not too difficult. Try jumping jacks or a jump rope!<br>  <br>  If you feel like you're ugly, its always fun to play around with new hairstyles and make up- you never know, you might find something you totally LOVE on yourself. One thing I just discovered is that you can curl the bottom of your hair with a straightener! Just twist it as you pull it through your hair. Its my new favorite look, I bet you'd like it too! As for make up, trying a new blush or eyeliner is what I love. Also if you get a white eyeshadow or eyeliner pencil and dot it on the inner corners of your eye, it can give you a fresh new sparkly look. FUN! =)<br>  <br>  The only thing you need to practice with is letting people hug you. If you "condition" yourself to not be afraid of it, you eventually won't be. Surprise someone by hugging them, it will probably make you feel really good. <br>  <br>  I hope this was somewhat helpful!|`|mDkrW9Odaa	dw there is not sutch thing as ugly ...people love you for who you are not for what you loook like and im sure ur a great person .

"physical love leads to nowhere" a poet said that!<br>  <br>  Sex can just be a distraction and get in the way of your purpose of what god wants you to do. especially since you're catholic I think you will find more peace with yourself to do what god wants you to do. pray about it. look in the bible also.|`|74gPuaXMaa	Manning up doesn't mean having sex. It means taking responsibility.<br>  I'm not religious, but I say if you want to have sex and you think you are mature enough to do it, then do it. God gave you a body that gets horny, so I think it's alright to have sex as long as your girlfriend is alright with it.|`|aD5Pp6nnaa	Well, the **** that could happen if you do have sex is far worse than if you don't.<br>  <br>  Wait until your 100% sure about going through with it.|`|ExSbfEhYaa	you'll regret it<br>  just think how awkward it'll be afterwards, when u see eachother at school.<br>  wut r u supposed to do if the condoms dont work??<br>  ugh.<br>  idk man.|`|Q6m9YqpTaa	dont your not ready to have sex|`|7jxNscHEaa	If you are having doubts about having sex go with your doubts. having sex isn't about "being a man" its about caring for and desiring the person you are with. Take some advice from me, I had sex for the first time with a man older than me just because I was sick of being the only girl I knew who was a virgin. Man do I regret it now. Follow your gut feelings. You have the condoms already, so just wait until the time feels right. Oh and don't carry them in your wallet, esp if you carry it in your pocket because it can lead to breakage and you don't want that.|`|g8X1BGreaa	Well using a condom is probably a really smart idea.  Also check if shes on birth control for a little bit more.  Seeing as there is no specific age of having sex and that it is a (fun) thing to do...just do it and don't go to banana sandwich.|`|EQLlZtR4aa	ahh! well its tough!<br>  but if you don't feel ready to have sex, DONT!<br>  dont be pressured.<br>  its not supposed to be somthing that you just do becasue somone else wanst to, its somthing that you do because  you feel ready & want tooo :F<br>  hope i helped answer mine please! :D<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmU8WyiWPXxjTb0M1MqGDajsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219142706AAIWCsG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA10211460	You should throw the condoms.|`|4leDainaaa	I wouldn't do it.

01kEv36Faa	Do nothing. If he  is smart as well as sweet, he will figure it out on his own.  These things are hard to overlook.  But if you say something, it could look like you are being jealous and catty.  Give it time and let things between them take a downward spiral on their own.  Just be there for him when he needs a shoulder to lean on.  He will see you in a different light.  Maybe even discover that his feelings for you are more than just a friend ;p|`|I6HJKrNQaa	ok girl you need to let him know your feelings <br>  right now.................. Good Luck
uBssj3Znaa	seeing some one means dating casually. Going out means dating exclusively|`|aIakDSstaa	when I was at school "seeing somone" meant it wasnt as seroius, "Going Out" meant they were your boyfriend/girlfriend|`|qIg7WsFnaa	Seeing someone - more like dating..u see them socially, ocassionally, maybe hang out with em a few times a week.<br>  <br>  Going Out - they are your boyfriend/girlfiend, and thus they are pretty much part of your life.|`|88K49bvraa	seeing some1 is when you can have a few girls. goin out is when u can on have 1|`|MxwnKDdzaa	yes when you go out it only means the person might be interested and seeing someone....... well it i guess I'm not sure|`|R2PaqlByaa	Don't think so =S|`|D3LqgeoBaa	seeing - sh*gging.  going out - dating in a relationship
rqeEhVvXaa	what he did for you, he will do to you|`|5a6e74148a3ae8aafbeabe8aa23b975faa	Go wit da flow if you wanna but b careful not to get 2 involved wit dis cat. He's prolly justa fool for a perdy face.  <br>  <br>  In reality, you're most likely headed for heartbreak messing with shitheads like this. When he sees a face prettier than yours, he may get on a roll breaking up with one girlfriend for another, you being his latest victim. If I were you, I'd  forget this guy and move on.<br>  <br>  Use your head... You're new at this school so beware of wolves in sheep's clothing. They're everyhere!!|`|FAzua6k7aa	Well if he is flirting with you and has had the girlfriend at the same time, history always repeats itself, so he will probably do the same to you when he is either tired of you or when something in a new skirt walks by. Good luck, I am not saying don't date him but just be aware he can do the same to you.|`|QczEdd5qaa	they flirt with you doesn't mean they love you<br>  <br>  they simply like you<br>  <br>  and you have to be careful with those guys<br>  <br>  you have to see them through different perspectives'<br>  <br>  don't take flirting as a big deal<br>  <br>  trust me<br>  <br>  the best thing you can do is treat him as a friend and simple as that|`|SDAgVxa3aa	i dissagree with john j i think that i mean he could of had problems with his old GF b4 that.... i broke up with my old GF for a girl that cam to our skool so i think that he likes you and if he is gonna dumb some1 for u then he mst really like you|`|bFJQyRusaa	Listen to John J. and Kc992. If he can dump a girl like she's trash for another girl he's known for only 3 days, he WILL dump u for another girl, personally i think that was just mean what he did to that other girl, take my advise, DUMP HIM. He sounds too possessive and seems to have a temper. Dump him and make sure there is someone around who could get u out of a tight spot if it comes to that. If it gets out of hand, GET ADULT HELP!!!! Don't be all "adult help is for babies" EVERYONE needs help, in this case u may need adult help. Try to either stay away from the girl he dumped, she may still be angry at u. Or go to her and tell her you dumped him and try to make her your friend. When you dump him if he asks u why, say "what me did for me, u will do to me" it may teach him a lesson.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:]|`|fRdGKrGoaa	I think that if you really like the guy then just ask him in a nice way why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend? and see what he says. I would be to mad because if he broke up with his girlfriend for you like his friend said then that means that he really likes you <br>  <br>  Hope this helped good luck!!! =)|`|d36OrpbDaa	I agree with John J - he'll do the same thing to you.  You just met the guy and he's already breaking up with his girlfriend for you?  Eh.... he doesn't even really know you.<br>  <br>  That means even if you guys DO date, the next hot girl that comes around will be on his mind, and you'll be kicked to the curb.<br>  <br>  Find a cute AND decent guy.  There are SO many; we just don't see them when we're caught up with the hot jerks.|`|Mz7Ccnn5aa	he probably liked u from the start but didnt want u to think he didnt so he kept it a secret from u. but at the same time didnt want to break up with his gf cus he felt bad. and finally broke it off with her cus of his feelings for u. so u should be fine with it. he probably wasnt trying to be rude.|`|jECkKPNwaa	wow this is a typical user<br>  i wud be angry<br>  he basically cheated on his gf and would do the same to u<br>  this is a kind of person who is pathetic<br>  for the sake of ur happyness get rid of him|`|BxUoF6HMaa	possible tht he didn't tell u cause he wanted to get over tht as he likes u.As long as he's not dating some1 else and he likes u then go for it....gud luck|`|aEin9L8Vaa	JHON J YOU ARE RIGHT coulnt have said it better miself.|`|VSeJBwDGaa	go for him, he wants you, but watch out, you dont want 2 piss off a enyone at the school, so take it slow|`|Yi4ja5Lkaa	hes a dog.. how can he get jealous about you talking to someone  else, when he had someone on the side.. get rid of him|`|GQ1Ny2Draa	idk, but he seems like hes a big flirt, u wouldnt want him cus what if a new girl comes around nd hes flirting with her while u guys are still dating and he dumps u for her, then wat? ur gonna feel dumb for falling for him nd getting hurt. imagine how his ex feels. u should feel flatterd but thats not worth messing with others emotions|`|PP2k9dwBaa	i agree with the first answer. besides, when he was touching you while he still had the other girl, thats cheating, and hell do that to you too.|`|OXsHAiXRaa	ahh thats confusin lol um i think you should be happy i guess cause it seems like he really likes you  lol
c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Peer pressure.  Make sure a few of the guests want to play before you suggest it and those who don't will feel goaded into going along with it.  Peer pressure sucks, but thats how its done.|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	You might be able to get a friend to ask it.
cn7gqmbaaa	You think of them no matter what you do..<br>  <br>  you always will for the rest of your life, best way that helps is just learn to live with it<br>  <br>  also make sure you tell yourself you arn't getting to gether, it's over<br>  and keep that thought in your head.<br>  <br>  <br>  one day you might forget, but that day hasn't came for me yet|`|AA11616170	Have you tried keeping yourself really  busy, to give yourself less time to think?|`|4x5ajsUpaa	I would find someone who was not in a relationship and avoid being a home wrecker.|`|2t5a4rSzaa	Keep busy and find someone else!|`|JjXFj2EBaa	No I confronted him and asked would it ever happen (about five minutes ago) and he doesn't.  Next!!|`|JuCUl0lJaa	I went out and started dating other people....and had a few one night stands.<br>  <br>  That sorted it right out for me.|`|bL3Q4u8aaa	I tried to move on and just ignore the thought of me liking him. I just tried to have fun with my friends and now (well actually a couple of days ago), I'm officially over him. It's true! I like someone else now and I know for a fact that this won is a winner because I think he might like me, too.    : )
8jp7lH2laa	ahh, sounds just like my problem i had about a month ago. me and the guy i like sit next to eachother in math. one night he texted me, asking me who i liked. i chickened out at first but then i was just like "i like you" and he was like "oh aight". haa, guys. but anyways...just tell him. its better for him to know and him not like you, than if you dont tell him, he likes you, and you lose your chance. ya knoww? you really dont have anything to lose by telling him. it was a little awkward in math the day after he asked but were cool now (: but just come out and say it, but not randomly. just kinda ask him who he likes and if he asks you who you like say "i like you". if it seems like he doesnt like you, just say "just kidding!" haha, id so do that. but anywayss.<br>  good luck! (:|`|vSHkZWUoaa	ask him out|`|TpNHTevSaa	you must have a lot of confidence in yourself and you just have tell him that you like him face to face making eye contact! or you can just text him!
349430e91043395f31bd69026affa76eaa	hmmm? well you haven't given much information to go on but, if she won't listen and treats you like crap. I would find another girlfriend as soon as possible. <br>  <br>  or is she the only girl left in your home town? state? country? I don't think so. <br>  <br>  Replace her !|`|HFn8M2KDaa	well, look depressed, slump on the coch, listen to hard-heart break songs like,"black dehila" by hollywood undead or ,"tears dont fall" by bullet for my valentine. when she asks you whats wrong look at her without expression & say,"oh..nothing..everthings okay... trust me it works..then she'll realize how much she's hurting you in the inside..^.^<br>  & she'll also feel like ****..
goYN8zvRaa	I think your going to have to accept the fact that your going to hurt him. If you don't like him in the same way he likes you then the relationship is going to end regardless and if you like joe more than him then you should give joe a chance it wouldn't be fair to any of you 3 if you were to have intimate relationships with both of them. <br>  <br>  So I would say end the relationship with bob and go with joe. Especially if joe is a better influence but talk to joe about it, he probably really wants you to break up with him but doesn't want to come around as a jerk.|`|KjzsYV9uaa	I would say go with joe|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Sorry babe, no one is "perfect" match but its your choice we all learn from our mistakes so I would say go for it, it would be the best for Bob to become a better man and it would be best for you to see if there is something better but not perfect.
EgHU0SxEaa	Just step up your game hun:)<br>  but don't push it too much though..start talking to him..and show him your cute side..but never give a guy too much attention:)..if you don't..then hell start wanting the attention:D<br>  so..step up your game..to get to know him better..if you like his personality and he likes yours..ask him to go to hang out or something..and if you see that he likes you..ask him what he thinks of you:)..and if he says something positive..u should tell him how u feel:)..and maybe you two will go out:)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you:)..and hope it didn't affect you in any negative way:)|`|cL05NtA3aa	Oh how cute well go take some classes like modeling, theater, or just go and be out there talk with random ppl so you can get over it the teachers will help you out along the way. Im like that to even though i am sooo weired and everybody just loves that i'm soo out there|`|1gKOlKxsaa	well.. . .  i get what you mean! im shy too but from expirience, talk to him cause if you dont start now your going to be shy forever.|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	just talk to him... have small talk and see if hes a dumb guy that cant carry a conversation or if he is actually worth it.|`|AhPDAnxFaa	the power within|`|nS83ag9raa	by de emphasizing the situation...<br>  <br>  tell yourself its really no big deal...then the pressure will be gone|`|sNKJDBhgaa	lol. you have two options, get over him. or open up. im a guy and i will tell you right now i can not tolorate being with a girl that never stops holding her breath. you have to try to open up and mantain control and composure. if you get scared and dont know what to do or say, remember that you dont HAVE to say anything and you realy only HAVE to be yourself.
ub2Dtzn0aa	You should be able to get something delivered to the school office. It may be frowned upon there so might want to check tat out first. If not have it delivered to the home while your not there.|`|71EwzPSlaa	well i guess the obvious answer would be why dont you mail the package? i mean itll still be a surprise and its not like your gonna have to be there and no one will think its a bomb that way lol...or just surprise her after shes off work you know ....might be easier|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Wel why dont you mail it to her door? Dont you know where she lives dude?|`|JlDcVTVsaa	why dont you give it to her in her home?<br>  or take her out for a dinner and give it to her?|`|JskRP5wUaa	you should take her out to dinner or more romantic stay in and give the gift to her, don;t do it at school
AA10974198	Ok first of all, being 16 and never having had a relationship is NOT a big deal. <br>  Second, you are NOT a freak because you have a prosthetic arm.<br>  If other people have a problem with that, it's their own issue and those people probably aren't worth your time. <br>  <br>  I do think you should be careful about online relationships. It's very easy to get hurt. Especially at such a young age. In my opinion though the distance is nothing really, that seems pretty close to me. I would advise you not to meet him for the first time on your own. <br>  <br>  Finally, if you feel like he's not into it, I would say let him know (but stay calm lol) and if he is interested he will be quick to let you know you don't need to worry. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps a bit :)|`|y4wFTXlBaa	All you need: <a href="http://ihatekaty.com/?id=2605975#6dzz5z54fsdq7ez78z8d" rel="nofollow">http://ihatekaty.com/?id=2605975#6dzz5z5...</a>

ehMPOlefaa	For guys to NOT be robbing the cradle (as the old expression goes) I once heard an formula that said 'half plus 7' is the defining age that a man shouldn't go below.  In other words half of his age and then add 7 to it and you would have the age that the girl should not be younger than.  In your case it works out perfectly for that.  But honestly shouldn't it matter more based on what the two of you mean to one another than anything related to numbers?|`|W618lfZ6aa	As long as hes not dating you just for sex.|`|dG7mUmVmaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  I think this man is way to old for you.  At 22 years old you have different friends and start to live your life.

I dated a 29-year-old when I was 22. It would have been fine if he weren't crazy. <br>  <br>  I don't think that age difference is too much. I think the number doesn't make as big a difference as the maturity levels.|`|Fe9isgq0aa	No hes not to old age is just a number and if you like him or love him shot for it. But theres nothing wrong with it... as long as hes not using you.|`|8McA6xqPaa	not really, Your adult enough to know love and lust and the difference between them at that age. As long as you know what your both after and as long as its the same thing, it could work :)|`|XwMn6aY5aa	age don't matter plus i think its good to date someone older than you since they are more mature and know how to treat ladies not like younger guys all they want is one thing..and if you never dated an older guy just take a chance you'll never know if its a good choice or a bad one if you haven't tried it :) so i say go for it good luck.|`|4uOc515Laa	I'd say no because you should build up ages start from lower first if your not too sure.|`|U2PZvOZLaa	He's only nine yrs older no he's not that old for you i say go for it|`|WO3dtNB5aa	no, that's not too big of a difference. but only try it if you think you have feelings for him.|`|Hzb2dOxcaa	i don t really think age matters if you really like him and vice versa! :) Go for it girl xoxo|`|lO6zgftaaa	Non My mom is 42 and my dad is 66 thats 24 years!!|`|66Mjr1F8aa	go for it! 8 years is nothing!|`|SLSvynetaa	Girl, he's 8yrs. older than u....... wat do u think??? ..... <<<3333|`|dlUgJ5Obaa	no he's not  too old for you, u're fine, I hope u'd have a gdluck with him :)

Being thin is often marketed in the media to girls but I honestly dont find it attractive, skinny girls that is. Nice and curvey is how its supposed to be.

b0525335a5c917ecb2d5a8e0f4744b29aa	Someone once said " If you met your true love, put aside everything and ask yourself, How many times do you meet your true love?".<br>  <br>  You know who you love more. When your around the person that you are meant to be with, your heart will tell you. But believe me pick fast before they get away.<br>  <br>  P.S The one that makes you feel like you will live forever, like you will love forever, that is the one that your heart belongs with.|`|zWo03iLNaa	You need to tell both of them how you feel. That will probably mean you will have to break it off with your fiance for now...but if they really love you they will understand and give you time to figure things out. Dont jump into anything you arent sure about.|`|0TuWYaneaa	Stop kidding your self and the people on here.You have to love one more than the other.If you even have these feelings then marriage is out of the question.Whether you end up with either one of them.|`|g2XbXYyraa	you whore|`|cqeuX3MUaa	Only a ***** would keep the ring.<br>  <br>  just wanted to throw that out there, Incase your my blonde Fiancee talking about me, LOL.<br>  <br>  So have you cheated?  Any underhanded doin should be confessed to the fiancee, that is a fact.<br>  <br>  But if you just see this other guy at work, or in town or whatever, and just talk to him cause he is cute, that is harmless, <br>  <br>  Make sure you know its more just just attracting drawing you to this other guy.<br>  <br>  But it is not fair to your fiancee, to Be engaged, or MARRIED to a girl who is not happy with him.  Any sensible guy would rather kow the truth, than be stuck with someone who doesnt want to be with him.  This can cause big problems in the future.|`|Ikn7aKQ3aa	girlfriend you need to weight your odds are u willing to thrown away sometime good that you have with your fiance over a man that you met a few months. if i was in your position i would my chances with my fiance, because i dont think you can fall so madly in love with someone you met a few months. is that real love or infatuation .|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	First off maybe you should not be engaged if you are torn between two people.  Which would be the best thing for you and your finance.  Take some time to yourself and figure out what it is that you want and do not want.  Maybe you are just having second thoughts about marrying your boyfriend and the other guy is just your way out.  But either way you need to figure it out before you say I do.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	The fact that you claim to love two and they both love you back simple means you really don't love either. When you fall in love with someone it will block all others from your mind. Love isn't a free for all.
rh3RNM5faa	Me!|`|pM4OJ4iwaa	bit of a weird question. Don't think i've seen that on this b4!
nMzzwrtUaa	Wait, we think now, Oh great now i will be expected to give my opinions on items. Honestly whats on his mind he is testing the waters seeing if its ok to try and jump on board and try a relationship or your looking at him more or less as a friend.|`|BjdJspiFaa	He probably does think of you as more than a friend, this is merely an extrapolation of mine from what you have given me though;<br>  <br>  I guess as a girl, you should probably consider flirting more often and being a little more playful. That is all you can really do unless you are not afraid of asking him out.<br>  <br>  But overall, I think that you two going out with each other at this point would be justified as long as you have known him for atleast a month.<br>  :)|`|7bzAJesRaa	Hmm... well I'm not sure if noticing a girl's lips is a sign of attraction for dudes, (certainly not for me) but if he likes spending time with you, that's a good sign. If you only met recently just keep hanging out with him. If it is early, he's probably still trying to gauge what he feels.|`|a471f7804850a790b04ff49462366e67aa	yea, he probably wants to kiss you or something|`|5al0K3N0aa	I'd say he *really* wants to kiss you.|`|X4U36dHzaa	he's probably feeling the same way you do,just asked if he's interested,suck it up and go for it before it's to late!<br>  good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!
NQFV2AdZaa	Why don't you buy him a card that says everything that you feel about him, or you could just write down how you feel and give it to him, i'm sure he'd appreciate it. Or you could organise a trip to the cinema to see a movie that he wants to watch and just present him with the tickets. Or if there is anyplace else that he likes to go, just take him there and have a nice day out together, good luck!|`|GMM4aeZFaa	watch the sunset with him? or a night in with his fave movie beverage and snack food?
oItOOqG9aa	go to nettos and buy beans <br>  hahahahah<br>  lmao<br>  hehehehehe
crex25Traa	A Romanian writers said that "love, in a distance relationship is like wind for a fire. It can either make it stronger, or it can either blow it off"<br>  Personally, I consider that a long distance relation is something that can be gone throw if the persons indeed love each other. But it can't go on for ever...In a certain moment, one of them will have to make a sacrifice and go near the love one.<br>  For this sacrifice I consider a long-distance relation more powerful than a close one. It takes hope and love to pass distance.|`|oHN6jwjoaa	long distance. they are amazing because obviously you are truly in love with the person if you are willing to risk not seeing them all the time for being with them.<br>  <br>  but they  are extrememly hard to keep. super hard. you have to be 100 percent dedicated to the other person. its difficult.<br>  <br>  and close distance is just the opposite. its great to know they are always there for you. but then sometimes its a little too much time together.|`|QVXcWSzVaa	Not necessarily better.<br>  <br>  But if you started off close distance then one of you moved away and it became long distance, then that will be difficult because you're not used to the big change. You'll start missing each other lots.<br>  My ex and I lived in the same town for a year then we moved into separate cities. It only lasted about 6 months after then, then we knew we wouldn't be moving closer again anytime soon (we were at universities) so we broke it off. Too hard to deal with for 5 more years.<br>  <br>  If you started off apart, it's fine. Yes it is hard, but if you really care about the guy it'll work. At the moment, I met my boyfriend at a camp and we started dating even though we lived 10 hours apart. We are still together and it has been over a year now, but in a way it is easy because we know we will end up together soon. (He will be moving in four more months).<br>  <br>  Missing your partner is hard, but there is so much technology these days - webcam, text, email, etc etc. And... absence makes the heart fonder.<br>  <br>  I kinda like it. Gives me a chance to get away and visit him. Sometimes we meet in a town in the middle. <br>  <br>  I guess, really, it depends on how strong you two are, and how much you care for him/her.|`|axCFlk5Zaa	Long Distance relationships don't work. You never know what the person is doing, who is at their house, if their cheating on you etc. The paranoia rises and rises until the relationship ends.|`|jLeHC1cgaa	long is worse.  They could cheat on you, you become more distant, they are farther from your focus, close distance is much more simple.|`|XgSO3t8paa	logn distances are the worst possible of course being closer is better unless you dont like them than its an advantage to be further but then you mind as well just break up.|`|klhxgF0Paa	long distance relationships are bad you never know if they are cheating|`|RWA0hLlOaa	What could possibly be good about a long distance relationship?  Seriously.|`|UFrcaQQZaa	close distance is way better long cuz dnt you wanna b by your lover plus if its long the other would miss you so much that they would probably cheat.|`|JCdBSULraa	Long distance are good if they started that way, but when short-distance goes long, it's a bad thing.<br>  <br>  In a relationship that starts out as long distance, people become very emotionally intimate, which leads to stronger, more enduring physical intimacy when they do finally meet.  It also irons out all of the secrets we keep from our potential significant others, as we feel more secure to share them.  Sometimes long-term relationships this way can become more intimate than couples who have been married for years in just the span of a few weeks.   <br>  <br>  That being said, those kinds of relationships are extremely difficult to form, as most people have the mentality that long-distance is a no-no.|`|sCCjAKllaa	The long distance requires a lot of patience and trust, even though many will use that against someone. It's easier on the mind when it's close, because at least you can see them when you get lonely, and don't have to just talk from a distance. I wouldn't be able to do the former because it's too much.|`|UZmXzBLtaa	long distance relationships could work it depends on you<br>  <br>  If you don't like people always around, then long distance is best for you|`|Fe9isgq0aa	NO i think having your boo around is better
3Ix5V01Jaa	he probably thinks the same thing, if you always see him staring at you then yes he probably is attracted to you somehow..|`|CxVjw6XDaa	Could be could not be. It could all just be a coincidence. The thing where he nodded at you maybe he did it just to be cool or something and it totally harmless. You're going to have to continue to find out.<br>  Also, you shouldn't be scared because being scared isn't going to get you anywhere in life you shouldn't put him on a pedestal and make him to be so great, this will make everything much harder.|`|eXpZD0vlaa	Grow up and walk over to him and say "Hi, can I look at your ipod?" and start a conversation based on his playlists.  If he talks to you with some enthusiasm, he may like you.  It's ok to show (a little) that you are interested in someone by talking to them.|`|Ova4dilbaa	I'm sorry, it sounds like he could be either way. If you want to get together with him, the next time you have an opportunity, try talking to him. Just casual talking. If he doesn't seem that into you, you might want to take it a step back and just play it by ear.|`|4uOc515Laa	I don't think he's into you if he was he would talk to you cuz i'm a boy and i would stand next to a girl i like and talk to her.|`|Ww7CyyALaa	He's not that in to you|`|EyZ4bg8Uaa	Sounds to me like he likes you!!!|`|g5ZkO2fKaa	im interested in to you E-mail  mee @ P_spire@yahoo.com!!!!|`|IuJcKGroaa	he's just not that into you! move one|`|4z0Lo0qTaa	he likes you but you have to talk to him , open your mouth and speak thats why you have it ! Take your time be yourself.|`|8QhPUxllaa	Hm I think that it is abit of a jump to make there!<br>  I think when he nodded at you he was trying to be polite, see if there was something there, maybe if you liked him as well.  When you didn't do anything back he might of got the wrong idea and not thought you were shy but was interested.  He could have then been embrassed and then when he bumped into you didn't want to look to forward or smile and say something to you for you then to ignore him or think he is a loser.  Try and smile at him abit more and see if breaks any of the ice!<br>  Good luck|`|UFrcaQQZaa	Hes jus not that into you but maybe those arent enough signs wait a lil to c if he keeps doing that plus more.|`|I6HJKrNQaa	Girl it look like his know you but you need to say hi to him dont be scare <br>  Good Luck|`|fZITwfi0aa	srry but he may not be into u i nodd at girls all the time and it doesn't mean that i like them all|`|D8EMsZT1aa	im into u 207-523-0879

GET A GOOD GIRL, AND DON;T BREAK HER HEART!!|`|IkAtIQumaa	Oh I know my all my friends do that. I think its a new fad here in Az. Bye love LOL jk|`|9KmqTjRJaa	You were right not to say it back. I think some girls just say it because their insecure and they want to feel loved.|`|aEin9L8Vaa	i think about that too! PEOPLE USE THAT TERM TO LOOSELY.... i right with you! and im a female!|`|pf1XcYDbaa	i went out with a guy that done that too... it lasted 5 days...<br>  we hooked up on a bus (he goes to my school) and he told me he loved me... it felt kinda degrading... like as if he couldnt be bothered to treat me right and show me he loved me not by saying it...<br>  so i no how you feel and after that relationship i walked away kinda confused and a bit angry that that dog thought he could treat me like that...<br>  so my advice is...<br>  talk about it to some close friends if you feel you can or just keep telling yourself that people like that aren't worth it...|`|23s2o01jaa	Some people are desperate for love and they need to artificially create it just by saying it.
TJKb1QDTaa	You could always have a friend do it for it, but I think it would mean more to her if you did it yourself, face to face.  I'm a girl, so I know these things.  Or, you could write her a note.  Whatever you feel most comfortable with, is what you should do =)|`|RsUEC74qaa	Well just go up to her,and say hey ( whatever her name is),when she says hi,ask her so what are you doing tonight,if she says i'v got some work,ask her how about tommorow..ans ask her for the movies or something like that !|`|Jb2PZpMVaa	Aww.. maybe talk to her face to face, msn ?, maybe txt.. just at least let her first know that you like her so she will think about it. <br>  <br>  hope i helped :)<br>  <br>  Good luck ! <br>  <br>  x
rbXCALUhaa	Wow thats an age old question :P<br>  frankly you can't MAKE someone like you but you can be attractive to girls by being a sweet heart :D<br>  Since you have a specific girl in mind, it is best to be blunt about your feelings.. girls dont like it if guys show their feelings but are too stubborn to admit them. Be really sweet, if someone is mean to her, defend her. And get her tiny gifts that she will remember (like a little bracelet that reminded you of her or something), make her realize that you cherish her and that you can make a good boyfriend.<br>  Oh and if she literally said ''i dont like you'', don't try to hard and move on because if she said that then there is noway you can make her like you.<br>  peace :D|`|mPuBm8Hxaa	I'm sorry to burst your bubble but you can't make someone like you.  I mean, you can do things, and they may or may not take interest in you for that purpose--but really, you can't.<br>  <br>  Even when already dating, people lose interest sometimes.  There's nothing you can really do if that other person just doesn't feel the spark anymore.<br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up over it.  Respect that person's feelings.  Don't harass them about it.  Distract yourself with activities.  And if in the long run her feelings change then it's a plus for you!  Besides, if you have to change yourself to make someone like you, they're not worth being with.|`|eXpZD0vlaa	If she already knows you for some and has shown no signs of interest, it's not looking good.<br>  <br>  But it shouldn't be about getting a certain girl to like you.  It should be about projecting yourself in the best manner that any girl would like you.<br>  <br>  And for that, it's all about being confident and projecting that confidence.  But it's not about arrogance, mind you.<br>  <br>  Dress and act in a confident, self-assured way.  Be funny but not in a derogatory way.  Look people in the eye and stand shoulders facing them when you talk to them.  Walk casually but with a purpose.  Stand tall with shoulders a bit back.  Be nice to everyone and stand up for those being mistreated.  <br>  <br>  There are more rules but notice how none of that has anything to do directly with getting girls to like you.  And that's because girls don't respond too well to guys who try too hard to be liked.|`|WjZ5Hpu0aa	You can't make someone be interested in you! <br>  <br>  Talk to her and be her friend; that's all you can and should do. <br>  <br>  Trust me, I've liked 3 guys and so far, none of them have liked me back. I tried so hard to sound appealing and tell them things they'd want to hear, and I never even enjoyed being their friend because of that. We don't even talk anymore! As you can see, changing who you are doesn't work well.<br>  <br>  Don't pressure her, flirt too much, or make her feel obligated or uncomfortable in any way.<br>  <br>  Be her friend, make her laugh, and be there for her. <br>  <br>  If you're lucky and you two are meant to be together, great. If not, you'll have a great friend. (:|`|9RtdvLEKaa	Unfortunately, there's nothing that YOU can do to make her automatically like you, that's a thing of movies.  But, she may discover she does if you start talking to her!  Try talking about her and finding out what she likes and then talk about that.  If she doesn't want to talk to you then forget her and it's her loss!|`|a220fa15e79c2eba79d5636b24556d79aa	Honestly, your best bet for you to be happy is just to flat out tell her. If she doesn't like you like you think she doesn't, then you cant GET her to like you. So you're better off just telling her that you think she's great and want to get to know her better and see if she feels anything for you. Good luck bro.|`|vAhLNlmQaa	been there. dude what i did waz i made a really romantic gesture. so. i found out (researched) when her birthday was. then i personalized a card from www.moonpig.com and (researched) where her locker was and slid it in between the gaps.and got my friend to talk to her friend to take a small handy-size box of Thorntons chocolates (go small in case it don't work) to her house. the card AND the chocolates was enough to get a we'll see. but a quick visit to <a href="http://www.freetranslation.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetranslation.com/</a> and translated a love letter into french with an english translation underneath (all handwritten) and we've been dating ever since. (14 months) plus she thought all the trouble i went through earned me my first kiss (with tongue)|`|VFdC2wPlaa	Most girls like it when boys are sweet. Be really nice, open doors for her, give her compliments etc...  Pay attention to what she talks about, and ask her questions about her life. Don't be pushy or to flirtatious. Wait until she has some interest before making a move.|`|ZaBUp8DDaa	HI! There: Just be yourself...Kindness seems to help bring friends. Just be a friend to yourself first. If she doesn't like you;just move on...The grass if greener on the other side...chuckle,chuckle. Good Luck!|`|IYlcoVEhaa	first of all you are not helping the situation by staying on the dam computer all day and asking your online friends how to get a girl<br>  <br>  this is one of the only things in life you have to answer yourself... it comes from experience douche bag|`|aPuefPuFaa	you can't really get her to like you. just go about your business.<br>  she eventually start talking to you when she realizes that your not interested in her no more. & did you tell her you like her?|`|vkPlX2Y4aa	Start by talking to her and find some common interests that you share. Ask her if she'd like to go to a local hotspot and go from there!|`|uzthUP9Faa	look at it from her point of view,, wat could some one that you dont like do to win you over..   IT almost impossible dude.. personlay id move on|`|mDkrW9Odaa	you cant make her like you . If its ment to be then it will happen ... but if it dosent then you'll always have a best friend :)    love you chaz|`|7THgBSvfaa	Be yourself.. I know you have probably heard it a million times but that is all you can do because if you change into something else and she starts liking you.. She isn't really like you..is she?|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Be yourself but she has to WANT to like you.  You can't make her.|`|sCCjAKllaa	That's unnatural. You can't get a girl to like you if she really doesn't. All of us guys have been through this, but there isn't much you can do, except find a girl who does like you.|`|SNjjQQGdaa	You can't get someone to like you............. you have to be yourself are leave that person alone. cause if that person don't like you for who you are than you are better off without them.|`|cgQrQSvDaa	there is nothing you can do im sorry if someone does not like you in that way they just never will. move on.|`|SPh4ctPCaa	Be yourself.|`|MAsnWWycaa	I'm going to tell you like it is: you CAN'T get someone to like you. They either do or they don't. If you stay true to yourself and be yourself, they will either like you or they won't, and if they don't, then it's a waste of time to chase them.|`|a55c24f1dd0dab9bef4e763156dfd053aa	You cant change a persons way of thinking. Maybe she doesnt like something about you, but that dont mean go and change yourself into a weirdo or nothin....you've got to either get over her, or you'll be heartbroken.|`|kb0ulnzJaa	just be your self and if she doesn't like you for you she isn't the girl for you.|`|8DMDTogvaa	You can start talking to her. Try to be funny without coming out like you are always laughing at her. Also, ask questions about her.|`|FSMpMA9saa	unfortunately sorry hun, but you cant.. <br>  a girls mind is made up n if she doesnt like you well she doesnt like you..<br>   but im sure there is another girl out there someone for you, so dont give up luv|`|jgU4g6kGaa	You can't....if she's not interested there is nothing you can do that has to come from her.

AA11363680	A great smile. It's amazing how much you can learn about a person from their smile.|`|tPpn8nbKaa	Haha I dont think you have to worry about that cause you seem like a person that any guy would go for lol. But to answer your question i look to see if the girl has a good personality and is outgoing and stuff. Plus not to sound shallow but i look for girls that are in good shape too.<br>  Having a sexy body never hurt.Lol|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Fantastic legs!
7tJNspGNaa	He would want to marry her because he loves her, and she gives him a feeling that he can't get anywhere else. <br>  Being married gives a sense of closeness and trust that you can't get from just anyone; its a safety net of security, love and complete trust.|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Maybe because most people still believe in the institution of marriage. I know I do.|`|ehcZAmUVaa	Depends on the person.|`|jwcwpfLRaa	Because of money xD|`|O5Ykm1roaa	Because he loves her.
rulABcARaa	well you dont really know if shes taking part in these 'sexual activities' at these parties, ,maybe she goes to broaden her social circles and make new friends. <br>  if she told you your really getting through to the real her, then maybe you should take some action and tell her how you really feel. <br>  she probably feels for you too if shes showing you the real her.<br>  that can be really hard for some girls. x|`|Nt1Tz3zuaa	maybe shes starting to like you but not quite ready to get rid of her "old ways" she might think that your just any old guy trying to hook up with her. just give it time and keep talking to her like you are now and eventually she might see that your a genuinly nice guy and she'll give you a shot! hope i could help!|`|EZ6kzC5oaa	sounds like she likes you, but goes to the parties to have fun, not have sex. maybe you are overreacting because you care so much for her. but really she is just going to the parties with her girlfriends?<br>  just ask her, and believe evey word she says. so far she hasnt given you reason not to.<br>  :)|`|WwVHWz5saa	Are you sure you know what she does at these parties? She could be doing nothing of the sort.. and you could just be getting jealous.|`|Ix2eWrswaa	sounds like mixed signals, but y dont you ask her instead of us?|`|qNOeBcvraa	she may possibly be giving you fake info to kinda string you along, to help heal what happened to her heart 6 months ago. it may sound strange but us woman are kinda heartless sometimes and unpredictable.  hurting someone else after we have been hurt isnt rare.     or she may be feeling something for you but trying to find herself.  Just talk to her, and try to read all the signs. you gotta read between the lines sometimes.  goodluck and dont get too involed if you see her pulling away. you gotta look out for yourself|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	It sounds like she wants both worlds.<br>  Maybe you need to clarify where the relationship is going and then she can decide if the parties are something she will part what to keep you.<br>  If she doesn't then that is your answer to she wants to sleep with you and feel great but still go to some crazy sex parties.
emKXU1QFaa	It could be multiple things.  <br>  <br>  If she doesn't eat enough anything she drinks will just kind of go right through her.  She could have a small bladder or a problem with hers, (she might have a nervous bladder, etc.)  If she's eating right and it doesn't hurt when she pees then she may not really have a problem, that's just the way she is.  However, the smart thing to do would be talking with her Dr. about it next time she goes in.|`|GfN2g0gdaa	maybe she doesn't eat enough so the food don't absorbe the water and it just runs right through her...|`|G0KEMulSaa	maybe she has bladder problems|`|HFn8M2KDaa	hmmm maybe she should go see a doctor this could be serious..
414a7949c0c7a0e4b68e5b04ef665f08aa	b/c he's a nag, and it seems that the simple way out of things is just to have it his way.  Dump him and find someone you deserve.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	You are not in a loving relationship move one and seek for happiness and the Joy that you are worth. He controls you because you let him stop it now. Tell him to give respect to you and if he chooses not to then you know that he does not love you, but is using you for his own pleasure he is evil. For remember that in a relationship there is to be equality between man and women and if not the relationship will end one day when the other will have had enough. But don’t let that take to long for it can destroy the spirit emotionally with in you. There is always some one out that that would give you the world and treat you with respect and that is true LOVE.|`|axCFlk5Zaa	Because you are scared of him leaving you if you tell him how you feel and start telling him to do things. <br>  <br>  This is no way to be in a relationship, being controlled is not a good thing. The relationship should be you two doing things together, not one of you controlling the other one.|`|XSyvi6rOaa	maybe its easier for you to let him control  than to be honest with your self. it is a hard thing to do  maybe hes not good for you  you should tell him how you feel   write him a letter and give it to him  maybe when he sees it on paper it will get through to him  i did this with my boy friend and it worked  and i was able to save my breath.  when you let yourself be controled  its like a safe zone and on the other hand  being safe isnt always like being free.  if you do make changes it wont be easy but it will be your choice  good luck
W3u8qCbhaa	why not call him|`|tgbO359Aaa	if u still feel bad about it then maybe u should call him, maybe u can work things out with him and u two can be close friends :)

sCCjAKllaa	I often feel the same. The feelings you have are normal, considering most guys would like to feel sorry for themselves all day. At least you understand how things are. I often take it as a learning lesson, and that the girl is not the one for me. It can only be painful if you allow it to be. Soon, you just have to turn the page, and focus on how you can get better.
NP98ui6xaa	uhh yeah Im def good looking. im 23 ttoday.. its my B-day and im sure your from some crazy distance from me.. and myspace is a joke..  and i got dumped day before valentines day! suckss|`|Y0RBIZJzaa	i'm single and 21|`|VVhphnUJaa	Sure, but knowing my luck, you live at least 2,000 miles away from me. ;P|`|Wb2WIgBSaa	i dnt really see the point in this question... why would u wnt to tlk to a guy tht u dnt even know?|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Sure.|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Try browsing through a dating site in your area. You will be completely suprised!!!!! Plus, if you like them you could always join and hit on them.. what's to lose?
R7FtrsMQaa	First of all , have your parents gotten any medical advice as to how to handle his situation?,If so then as long as they follow the advice that should help him, what you can do is encourage your brother to get as much exercise as he can if his primary care says its okay, also you could do this with him sorta like a partner thing , help him to stay on a healthy diet and don't allow him to take abuse,lots of people as cruel as it is like to make fun,help him keep his chin up and do his best to keep self confidence. and pray for him.|`|jRRTdT4uaa	go to webmd or see your doctor and he should deffinetly go on a diet|`|j83xUK7Aaa	i would talk to your mum and see what she thinks u should  do raise your concerns i bet she is already on it anyway  x x x|`|mINsmx78aa	Well first question is do you love being around your brother. If so then you would mind spending some time doing some fun activities and stuff that would help him loose some weight. Now i am not saying going to jump off a mountain or anything but like go swimming,a walk in the park,the local YMCA, and stuff like that<br>  <br>  Now for his eating there are plenty of foods that kids enjoy eating with are healthy for you. like,fruit salad,cheese and crackers, and there's plenty of food at a local health food store that i enjoy as a kid.|`|7hWVJTlYaa	Offer to go on walks with him like around the block or on a trail. Take him bike riding. Go swimming with him. Play soccer in the backyard with him, or football, or baseball for that matter (maybe when the weather is nicer) If you have a membership to a gym, bribe him with something that he wants to do (that is healthy) and have him go. At my local gym they have a kid program with really cool machines for them and also little fun-fit classes, maybe get signed up for one of them. Be competitive with him, like have jumproping competetions and stuff. Kids are pretty competitive. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|HZ5oY0sOaa	Huh? I'm even older than him and I weigh 169 pounds. If you're worried he's going to have a heart attack because he weighs too much and he's too old, you've got nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  XD<br>  <br>  But seriously,<br>  <br>  1. Take away the cookies.<br>  2. Don't let him eat more than 2 slices of pizza. Even if he's not eaten anything earlier in the day. Tell him to get something else.<br>  3. Read nutrition labels. I believe my mother, a nurse, says you are entitled to 1600 calories a day. If he wants to lose weight, have him eat less than that.|`|WeRVjgpMaa	I'm not a dr, but if it were me...I would try to eat meals with him...like breakfast and dinner, and introduce him to healthier foods.  School shouldn't be a problem, because most school systems require healthy food choices.<br>  Another thing, I just make enough for him to have a healthy serving.  <br>  Weight, is always an issue no matter the age, but how tall is he?<br>  A lot of the time with kids, they hit little patches and lose a lot of weight, or the opposite and gain weight.  If you are seriously concerned, take him to the dr.<br>  <br>  Just try to stay involved and get him active.  The reason we, and our kids get fat is because of bad habits we instill....it only takes a month to make or break a habit.|`|200afe35d45dea8a4192b6e0e30ed767aa	Try becoming more active in his health. Offer to walk around the park with him, or go on a bike trail. Get some fruits and veggies prepared as a snack- pre-scliced apples, peanut butter and celery, etc. Stick with peanut butter as the dip instead of salad dressings. <br>  <br>  Don't make his weight seem negative; in fact, don't mention his weight at all. Just keep up the activities and good food and he will notice all on his own.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|9RtdvLEKaa	You should encourage him to go outside and walk with him!  Have him eat healthier snacks after school with you and just be supportive but don't ever tell him that there's something wrong with him, that will just make it worse.  If nothing like that works, then you may want to consider having him see a doctor...|`|dWmT9pBhaa	Talk to your parents and force them to get him to diet. It's easiest for him to lose weight when he is young and the quicker he does the healthier of a life he will live. Take away all soft drinks and make him drink water instead.|`|SVuTVNVhaa	Help your brother out.  Take him on walks, and feed him healthy food.  Workout with him so that he doesn't feel like he is exercising alone.  If he has a partner or friend to help him he is sure to start loosing weight.  Good Luck!|`|mQqc4Bg7aa	I am scared for your lil bro too. My little br is 6 and he weighs 52 lbs. How about eating healthy foods and ask your mom to get him in a sport or in a karate class or something. I feel really bad 4 you|`|oV8H7QJdaa	introduce exercises with him, like you're playing a game. show him healthier food by making them fun to make and even more fun to eat. and i really admire you for caring so much about your brother. :]|`|ovZyUulraa	Take him to a nutritionist<br>  get him into sports<br>  go for a run with him<br>  and put him on a diet|`|HaD3csoFaa	Take him to the health Doctor|`|VFyERjSSaa	help him understand that he is hurting all of his organs and if he doesn't watch his weight then he could possibly die.|`|CAxn8v1Aaa	You should probably just see what kind of sports he likes and do them with him maybe if you have a treadmill you could get him to run on it. If you don't have a treadmill maybe you could go to the gym|`|IM3OiLUkaa	This is something that you should discuss with your parents. Then they need to talk to a pediatrician so they can come up with a nutrition plan.|`|bmPnzvKMaa	You should take him to the Doctor  and get him help. A nutritionist! That is really unhealthy.|`|32EtYNXgaa	Make the lil fatass run a bit every day that will help him out a lot!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5Ioe0GE8aa	Feed him healthy food and go for walks with him.|`|Wx1W1vSeaa	Take him to see a doctor.. AND follow what the doctor says...:)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck...:)|`|AA10705929	You should be!  You can take him out for excercise and get his fat little rear-end moving!  I don't say that to be mean, but rather as a matter of fact.  I am slightly overweight, and I am only a few pounds more than that.  I am now 40...<br>  Make sure he gets off of Little Debbie and I highly recommend getting the wii and the wii fit to go with it, and MAKE him use it.  Make him want to use it by making it competitive.<br>  <br>  He is in store for a LIFETIME of physical and emotional trouble if he doesn't get his act together|`|SIWAL8TSaa	you should makes plans with him, and ask him to go running with you one day but u have to make it very fun because then he is just goin to feel like no one appriciate him soo u have to do a lot of fun activitys that involves him to loose some weight. one day if u happen to cook make sure its healthy but put a little meet in it and ask him to help you cook make it exciting because keepin him active is goin to keep him strong and he will loose weight trust me,.|`|AA11599430	encourage him to eat healthy eat wheat bread cut out most sugars no sodas|`|xm0kLvnLaa	Put him on a diet.|`|1BHM6z8faa	Take him out to walk with you or play basketball or something. Get him something that is fun and active and don't let him eat as many snacks or sugary items. Like with soda, if you cut back 2 sodas a week, he wont gain 15 pounds every year so jusrt think how much he can lose if you can cut back oh and dont let him know he is trying to lose weight :3=|`|wi6mkT30aa	I think that's very sweet you are concerned for him. Tell your parents how you are feeling. They need to start feeding him better foods.<br>  <br>  For you, I would take him out and play with him! Get him some FUN exercise and play sports together! Take him to the mall and walk around, do a lot of activites! No more sweets!<br>  <br>  Good luck hon I think thats great that you care about him this much!|`|HPSApjGOaa	First give him the hardest hug you can give him, and tell him that you love him.<br>  Think of an easy sport, and ask for his help. Get him involved. Make him believe you feel better with his help than anyone else.<br>  Ask for his advise.  Even though he is only 9, he needs to be needed.|`|wJxfTOgBaa	well i heard that during sexy time you lose 5 pounds on average....so you know what to do.|`|T526fAIeaa	Well, you have to keep him healthy. and dont let him think he needs to stop eating. Just try to spend time with him, and secretly get excersize while doing it! Just dont let him think your trying to get him to lose weight. you know?|`|FSMpMA9saa	just help him through, you know worry less about his wait and more about his emotions.. ppl at school could be giving him a very hard time and all he wants is support.. and u know just be like bro lets go for a walk and help him eat healthy and what not|`|5ypdHLtGaa	try to get him to go out and be active. It would help if there is something you can do with him everyday. try to lead by example and eat healthy and get him to try things that you are eating.|`|iLQ87NSUaa	try to find a sport he likes. and play games with him that will get him moving, but he won't feel like he's working out.<br>  <br>  try <br>  <br>  soccer<br>  playing tag<br>  swimming<br>  obstacle course<br>  tennis<br>  football<br>  basketball
iRhxDwZ9aa	May be you should really have a long talk with her see where her feelings really are for you and ask her why and then from there is your choice..
LKsl00CTaa	Well there are two categories guys fall into: shy guys and confident guys.<br>  <br>  Shy guys generally tend to avoid making the first move with every aspect of the relationship. They'll also look in your direction and divert their eyes quickly if you spot them. They'll smile at you and engage a conversation if you start it.<br>  <br>  Confident guys will talk to you straight off the bat after catching your eye. They'll look over at you, and if you spot them looking, they'll smile at you then turn away slower than a shy guy would. Flirting would be almost instantaneous with eye contact but they'll also tease you just to make you laugh.<br>  <br>  Unknown Identity.|`|FZlKhuDCaa	well guys are very confusing, when they flirt they make fun of you, they play fight with u.... hope i helped.|`|5al0K3N0aa	Yeah guys are pretty useless in general with girls.<br>  <br>  We're sorry.|`|zGUmB3qaaa	hmmmm well being a guy i can say that alot of the time guys aren't even positive who they like themselves so it would be impossible for you to know....<br>  <br>  but i'd say that if i was attracted to the girl i would attempt to be near her more, i would try and be funny, i would try not to look at her to much and probably fail.... i would smile at her but it would end up looking kinda silly.... and i would get all depressed when i see her hug other guys
OJXfV529aa	I got it 3 months before I turned thirteen.<br>  I've been thirteen for, 6 months now.<br>  <br>  Skater hair is the best kinda, but if your going to have skater hair you have to dress skater too.<br>  <br>  And FYI, kissing isnt that big of a deal. Just wait until you find a girl you really really like because my first kiss was with a boy I really only liked as a friend and I still regret it.|`|UX3xmWc6aa	ima girl... i got my first kiss when i was 15.. i don't like super short hair.. but i don't like super long either... zac effon lenghth is about right.. hes the only celeb. i could think of off the top of my head..|`|gG5VyXOFaa	im 15 almost 16.<br>  girl.<br>  i know for a fact im nice looking, lol ;)<br>  <br>  dont worry about it. when it happens it happens. you have plenty of time just find the right girl. :)<br>  <br>  depends on the girl but i lovelovelove longer hair, like skater hair. if its supershort its really uglyyyyyy.<br>  :) hope i helped!|`|azIJoIdIaa	Oh jeez. 13.

I'm 17 and I just got my first kiss and I was perfectly happy waiting for it until then.

dtM5je26aa	by saying all the things he said straight out to you sounds like he was just trying to push you away so he wouldn't get attached. as you said he wants a real relationship so if you were far away then he started pushing you away even though he loved you. it sounds like he does, just he doesn't want anything to do with it unless its a real relationship.|`|9HyKCmpnaa	There's plenty better people out there, go get yourself a better boyfriend|`|lYjweuZmaa	1. yes<br>  2. in your head not on it<br>  3. he doesnt know what he wants in a relationship<br>  4. he never did...<br>  <br>  srry|`|GEyJMsaKaa	This is NOT healthy....Just move on with your life....You really should not waste your time with this guy....No,he doesn't love you.

But dd you say close to his face afterwards or anything like that?<br>  <br>  Also, it's in bad taste to kiss your friend on the cheek if your boyfriend is there at the time, even if you were just thanking him.|`|X6gz0qKLaa	it doesn't sound like it to me, but you have to be mindful of not just your actions and how you see them, but how others see them as well. if your guy friend likes you in any way, you should not kiss him, but otherwise your boyfriend should grow up.|`|CTE2eRgZaa	did you mean it romantically?  It doesn't seem so.<br>  <br>  My bf and I are both Italian.  We both kiss people on the cheek all the time.  Its a sign of friendship or connection.  <br>  <br>  If it was a girl, would he be angry?|`|dueKTHXxaa	No way, unless you do like him like that, and it doesn't sound like you do.<br>  Also the fact you told your boyfriend about it (I'm guessing here) shows that you weren't worried about him finding out. He should see that, too.|`|iRhxDwZ9aa	No but it crosses the line of what not to do while you are in a relationship and it kind of shows how you really feel about that person|`|oHN6jwjoaa	it isnt.<br>  not at all.<br>  i mean if it gets more then that then yes.<br>  but not a kiss on the cheek.<br>  expecially if you know that it means nothing.|`|bOgkSqkeaa	no he's just jealous. you DO have to say sorry though. And make sure you show him that you're sorry, like kiss him and be romantic. Believe me it'll help|`|cydakP87aa	not really because you didnt initiate the kiss. <br>  but you should probably say something to this guy who kissed you and let him know you are not interested in him like that...|`|Ww7CyyALaa	No not at all it was friendly now if you had kissed him on the lips it could have been considered cheating just talk things out with your boy and it will get better|`|Ova4dilbaa	No not at all! You're boyfriend sounds jealous though, you might want to make sure he knows you're just friends with the person you kissed.|`|PpI7JFgEaa	absolutely not!|`|9EoQ01VRaa	NO. not unless u like him that way. which sounds like u dont. u were just exited. thats not cheating|`|QVXcWSzVaa	No.|`|XgSO3t8paa	its not actually physically cheating but it is leading someone on to being more then a friend. so even though it does not classify as cheating it is the first step so either way it was not smooth and wrong unless your plan is to break up or cheat. people above can say technically dont worry about it but fact is your boyfriend is a guy and he knows from the guys point of view that your friend is not going to read your mind which to many girls expect guys to do and dont realize that guys dont care about if your flirting for fun or not in the end if it goes far enough it to us just means time to make a move and that line is usually when a girl shows us a lot of interest and gets a bit touchy like on the shoulder or something then we feal well she wants us to make a move and if you have bf when you do that then it puts your friends in an uncomfortable position not knowing what to do. and it is careless on your part. now hugging is fine its so common greating its less then touching a shoulder its like shaking hands but a kiss on the cheak is way past the line thats like first date shyness signal saying i want you to kiss me next date or now on the lips after. so your friend is definately probably confused. even though it does not break any basic rule it should be intuitive to all you girls what message it would send. and just because their is no basic ground rules for what you did does not mean its always acceptable you should sometimes use your own head. just like your boyfriend probably would not want you flirting with another guy at a party infront of him or in any way he could know about it so it is reasonable for him to think it was wrong and he knows now the guy is going to make a move you should now rather then defending your self you did nothing wrong comfort you bf that you wont let it get anyfurther and that you made a mistake if you want him to stay as your bf for a long time.

It gives me the impression that I'm being ignored. I also don't like fights going into the next day. I like dealing with things right away.  But if she's the type of person that needs time to cool off, give her some time, but make sure you try to communicate and talk to her about what happened.|`|UZmXzBLtaa	Just let her cool off, leave her alone for a bit!! <br>  <br>  When she is ready to talk she will go back to you! <br>  <br>  If you don't let her cool off you will end up making her even more mad<br>  you don't want that do you???|`|iRhxDwZ9aa	Yes it is and then just start over when everybody is not angry|`|ehcZAmUVaa	What happened ???|`|I6HJKrNQaa	is true is better to wait but girls go crazy when you guys act like u dont care..............|`|axCFlk5Zaa	Just apologize.

VttT9C5Vaa	It's hard not to worry a bit about who he might be working  with but you have to understand that he will always be surrounded by other women, whether he is working or not.  If you trust him then don't stress on it. If you make it known that you are jealous he will see it as irrational and might get offended or you might slowly drive him away.  Men and women work / associate with each-other everyday of their lives, it is a part of life. If you can't trust him at work then where and when can you trust him? He cannot always be by your side. Just try to relax. My boyfriend works in a office with mostly women and at first I was a bit worried because shi** happens but as long as you have trust then all is good.|`|uBssj3Znaa	learn to trust your boyfriend, get some self esteem and stop being so insecure.

AA10519043	When you ask if it feels good, one has to question if you mean physically or emotionally.  I guess it feels good physically, but sometimes the guy might not be into it, his partner, the time, the place, or other things that might make it unsatisfying. But in general, it feels good physically.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	It's always good.
VAI6MtPIaa	That's a difficult situation. <br>  <br>  Once your friend feels she's been through enough she'll take your offer and move regardless of how far away it is. <br>  <br>  What's even more important is to know why her mom pulled her out of school. Even if she is going through a lot I don't feel that a parent should pull their child out of school they should be trying to find out what is going on with their kid instead. Your friend shouldn't have been given a say so whether she is pulled from school even if SHE wanted it. <br>  <br>  The first thing she needs to do is get a GED. That will help her in the long run. Even if she has to currently stay with her disgusting boyfriend and apartment.. it's her fault to why she's there. Her education and gettnig the GED can be done while she works or not. Does her boyfriend work?<br>  <br>  She does NOT have to take care of him. She's not obligated. They are not married and she does not belong to him. He's a lot older than her and if she's 18 now that makes him 26? He can take care of his own or he can go back to living with mommy and daddy. <br>  <br>  After the GED, or even before it, She needs to take her life back into her hands and move. Let her live with you.. or why don't both of you go out and get an apartment together? With that she should be expected to pay at least half of everything. Her mother should still feel somewhat responsible for her own child. Even if living with her mother isn't what she "wants" to be doing it's what she should be doing. She needs to gain control of her life. <br>  <br>  You need to sit down and talk to her. Tell her what's going on and tell her how you feel about everything. She might not see things the way you do. If she doesn't know what to do give her some examples. Try to get the best for her. Get her mother involved if all else fails.

You're believing that the ones you see in the websites you visit or have heard about are representative of the entire population of women.<br>  <br>  In the same way, a Ukrainian visiting nothing but American sex sites might wonder why every last American woman got silicone implants and works in the porn industry...and would wonder why any American man could walk at all.<br>  <br>  And as to the fine examples of American intelligence and masculinity who have asserted here that all Ukrainian women are fighting each other for the privilege of boffing them just to get a Green Card:  Fellas, a Ukrainian woman may not have a Wal-Mart and a Starbucks on every corner of her street, but she can spot a self-absorbed moron a mile away...<br>  <br>  ...and you've been busted.|`|545c8190dd574a20dff4291cb029a8ccaa	My friend Tolstoyevsky sums it up well.<br>  <br>  In contrast, the prevailing question in Ukraine is why all Americans are fat, rude, think they can buy anyone/anything they want, and why American men only want Ukrainian women to sell as prostitutes in Las Vegas. And are you aware that every American man, who marries a Russian or Ukrainian woman, is paid $100,000 by the US government?<br>  <br>  Sound offensive, and ignorant? Well...  it is based on a limited world view.<br>  <br>  But it is a valid opinion, if we only look at the number of sites like eHarmony and FriendFinder, the millions of American dollars spent on sex sites, or the abundance of 1-800/900 screw-a-fat-prostitute-on-the-phone ads we have on TV.<br>  <br>  As to the "green card" view here, it is better to remain silent and be thought to be ignorant, than to open ones mouth and remove all doubt.|`|W618lfZ6aa	green card|`|g2XbXYyraa	green card

A lot of guys that are really into their gf/wife enjoy giving pleasure the most. Enjoy it and stop worrying. Maybe throw in a porno or something and pick up some new tricks for the poor guy.|`|NBErRe8Saa	Your overreacting, if hes making that much of an effort to please you, you should be content with what you have, because its alot better then what most people have.|`|4KMZQKiLaa	he's just trying to be clever.<br>  see, what goes on in a guy's mind is "if I'm nice and tell her what she wants to hear, then maybe I'll get to the next level" <br>  <br>  :D|`|Gza8jaboaa	your overreacting to him being cute!!|`|xwNgEhKCaa	its ok his answer is not bad

It's a double standard that we all have to live with.  Women are the exact same way.  The only people who are completely "honest" with each other and don't piss each other off, have just managed to learn how to play the game really well.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	Why blame yourself for his problem?

Since you've tried (for 10 years!) and he still is trying to get more info from you, I'd say keep it to yourself.

Marriage is so important that its unimportant to people in this day and age.  People take everything that's sacred about it and that makes it important away.  Conveniently operating in a way that makes marriage seem so worthless because they want convenience.  If he can't take your honesty after ten years, then he has some major issues he needs to deal with.  Whats the point of lying to him when you will only be miserable.

You'll have to figure out how to bring this into the conversation--like if you guys watch porn, you could rent a video that has a threesome, then say "wow, that's hot. Have you ever thought of a threesome?" Etc. Once you find out if he's into the idea, and that to him, a threesome of one woman and two men would be OK (most men want two women/one man), you can wonder who you guys could ask, and you could bring up this friend. In other words, bring up the topic gradually, getting yeses from him with each stage. If he says no at any stage, you know to back off. And you have to be aware that you might get him jealous if you admit to being attracted to his friend. Then, if you do a threesome, you've got to lay down ground rules first.|`|AA10197672	you keep copying othere's answers and changing the husband to wife/ wife to husband!

2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I think, it helps to remember that your trust issues have to do more with your trust in yourself than with your trust in other people. If you are comfortable with yourself, your judgments, you will naturally be more confident in making decisions; you will be more at ease with deciding who is worthy of your trust and who isn't. This confidence doesn't appear overnight - it comes from the combination of experience and introspection. Think about your past relationship: can you think of any signs that this person was untrustworthy? I'm sure that with the help of 20/20 hindsight you can. Analyze the situation, and ask yourself why you either didn't catch the signs, or chose to ignore them. Mentally walking through some past mistakes can help you avoid these same mistakes in the future and make you more confident in trusting your judgment and your gut feeling.<br>  <br>  Second point I would make - you just have to accept that everything carries a certain amount of risk; there will never be a crystal ball, you simply can't predict the future with 100% accuracy - so don't even try, don't look for guarantees. When we open ourselves up to another person, it's a risk regardless of how good you are at judging people. Circumstances change, people change; there are so many factors that go into determining how any specific relationship progresses, it's impossible to account for them all. You have to try to do your best, but you need to get comfortable with taking this risk. "One who doesn't take risks doesn't drink champagne", as they say in Russia.<br>  <br>  Third thing: everyone has baggage. What matters is not the baggage itself, but how the person handles it. Some people are unable to manage themselves, and so their baggage contributes to the dysfunction in their lives; for others, every mistake is a learning experience, and it makes them wiser, maybe even a better person. <br>  <br>  In your particular situation, you kinda have to take your time and see where this relationship goes. Try to distinguish between your struggle with your own trust issues and your gut feeling that something's not right. Our intuition can be surprisingly good at alerting us to things that don't seem quite right, but we often brush these warnings aside. If you feel something's wrong, examine this feeling more closely, don't just write it off as a "trust issue". Look at this person's general style: does he tend to rush into things? Does he take his time? Does he change his mind a lot? Is he generally reliable, is he flaky? Does he usually think before he speaks? Simply having an ex-wife is not by itself a deal-breaker (although you do have to accept that she will be in his life to some extent, as the mother of his child) - one can have an ex-wife and still be emotionally sound and fully prepared for a new relationship. But perhaps his general personality traits can give you more of a clue of how well he can cope with new relationships. If he's the type of guy who tends to change his mind or rush into things, it can be a red flag for what might happen to your relationship; but if he's generally "slow and steady", it might be worth putting your concerns aside for now and giving him a chance.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Just take things very slowly, one small step at a time. If he cares about you, he will understand your issues, and not push you to go faster. Caution is a good thing in this case!|`|GmTMVmASaa	You set yourself up for failure, when you compare your new loves with your old.<br>  love can be such a beautiful thing, but sometimes it's a killer. these are the chances that we take, because tmorrow isn't promised. it may not be easy to trust, but you can trust that he's there loving you, today.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	There's one important fact you have to keep reminding yourself of...<br>  <br>  If your current boyfriend didn't want to be with you, he wouldn't be. If he wanted to be with his ex, he would be.<br>  <br>  It sounds incredibly simple, but it's true. He has no reason to maintain a relationship with you that he doesn't want, so if he's sticking by your side, he wants to be with you. If he wanted to be with the mother of his child, I'm sure he would be pursuing said relationship. Obviously he means it when he says he is done with her.<br>  <br>  Take the relationship has slow as you both need to in order to make it work. Only time will tell if you two can make it for the long haul or not.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|x3EPqezJaa	Actually, I see nothing in his past that would make anyone doubt what her place is in it. That's a further part of your trust issues--you're thinking "anyone" would think that, but it's just not so. In other words, your trust issues are deeper than you think. Face it: everyone you will date has dated someone else in the past, They all have exes. If anything, this guy should have trust issues himself, since his ex tricked him into paternity! That's common ground that the two of you share. In any case, it's possible that the relationship would work, but you need to get some professional help to talk over these issues. You're not ready to be in a serious relationship until you've worked through your own baggage. You can still keep dating him, but don't make any long-term decisions. You don't want to bring your feelings of insecurity and jealousy into a marriage.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Trust always starts from somewhere, anyone who I have taken on face value and was then deceived can never be trusted much less given the same opportunity.  You can never set yourself up if you don't know, you set yourself up when you do and don't do anything about it.  Just remember if you are not going to stand for deception, DON'T!  If he says he is done let him be, but I do suggest the first minute you catch him in a lie regarding that, drop him like your pants on a hot date and keep it moving.  if his childs mother is worth destroying what you thought you two have let him go and be with her.|`|AA12221556	Its normal to have trust issues after what your last boyfriend did to you.  Try not to carry that into your relationship w/ your new boyfriend.  What your ex did to you has nothing to do w/ this relationship.  Keep reminding yourself of that.  Its not easy.<br>  <br>  Try giving him the benefit of the doubt.  He has not given you a reason not to trust him.  <br>  <br>  So be happy.  You deserve it.|`|o38uYuRJaa	I would say work through things slowly and make sure you have talked through everything with him. you have to try and work through your trust issue together and i think you should tell him your feelings about his ex girlfriend.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Keep your feelings for him temperate. Do not go into it head over heels so quickly. 5 months is nothing. Remain reserved until he has proven to you that he is worthy of your affection.|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	either let her move in with you and share him, or run.|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	One  word !        <br>    R U N !|`|4kW9ub54aa	Reading your comments above you will never be happy with this man. No matter how hard you try there will always be issues in this relationship because you describe it as he as having baggage-child (ex gf-which will always & forever be in his life due to the fact he is the mother of his daughter.) Accept it that this will not work for you. Seek therapy, learn that no man is worth getting crazy over with, someone else is better for you without a baggage, someone w/similar interest background like you. Deep in your uncouncious mind he your bf now is not the one and I can see this will never work out or be your match. He is not the right man for you & you know it. This is already failed from the beginning. You need help, start with yourself, seek therapy. He isn't the one. I know you don't see it now but later you will. Take care.|`|7OTJW7fAaa	Understand, first of all, that there are no guarantees as to the length of a relationship once you decide you have something serious together.  The trust you have to establish is within you.  You have to trust that you will be okay no matter what happens between the two of you.  <br>  <br>  His past shouldn't make you doubt his future.  We all learn from everyone that we interact with in life.  If we don't learn the lessons, they are brought to us again and again with different people.  If you find yourself repeating the same issues with this current boyfriend that you had in the past with other guys, you didn't learn the lesson and you didn't resolve your issues.  Your issues may be trust and insecurity.  <br>  <br>  He does have a issue with being alone.  He has never been on his own emotionally and hasn't had the courage to try.  That's why he went back to his ex-wife after breaking up with the past girlfriend.  He needs to learn to trust that he will be okay no matter who is in or out of his life.<br>  <br>  You have to give this relationship time.  You need at least a year to learn all the good and the bad about a person.  You need to see them in difficult times and under pressure to see their true character.  Give this man and yourself this time.  If at some point, one or both of you decide that you are not compatible for one or many reasons, choose to move on.  Don't do it with bitterness and anger, but with a better understanding of who each of you has become.  <br>  <br>  You are only setting yourself up for failure if you have specific expectations about where this relationship is going.  If you loosen or let go of your expectations and just enjoy getting to know this man and his daughter and showing them who you are, you will have a wonderful relationship wherever it eventually leads.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Your relationship sounds like the blind leading the blind.   Neither of you is ready to commit yourselves to a new relationship.   Too much baggage at each end.   You need to work on your mistrust and try to gain back hope in your heart.   There are no guarantees in life that things will work out but at least, trying to live with hope each day at a time, make a big difference.   You cannot go into this relationship as you are, its like jumping into a pool without knowing how to swim.   Read the book "Before You Do".   Good luck|`|KZlgdMeEaa	sounds to me like ur ex cheating on u gave u a self esteem problem. Thats where i would start workin on things and good luck|`|Rzm20vLlaa	Of course it can work! You just need to deal with your trust issues. The way you deal with it is by trusting him. The longer you are with him, the more you will trust him, because it really sounds like he wants to be with YOU and only YOU! :-)<br>  If you want the relationship to work out for you two to be together, then you need to be honest with him about why you have issues with trust. If he is worth his salt he will understand and he will help you to build trust.<br>  <br>  Eventually, you will feel better about his past, when the two of you have had much more time together. His past won't seem so daunting to you. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Just trust him and you'll be ok. Good luck, dear.|`|wPORwSESaa	All of the above responses seem quite logical.  This new relationship seems a lot like the old one...very destructive to you.  Maybe you crave drama more than you realize.  Ultimately all I hear is YOU asking how YOU can make things work.  There are lots of other people in this equation and who exactly is looking out for you?  No one can ever make you happy except yourself.  I would recommend that you spend a great amount of time being single and letting your past disappointments fully close before you try to bridge the gap with another relationship.  Try caring about yourself before you try to care for everyone else.  I think all of you are so worried about yourselves but you all should be most worried about the child in the scenario.  Are your presence, his drama and the mother's selfishness helping the child in any way?  It seems to me that you all need to be reminded that the child is the most important character in this circle.|`|yOHCXiaMaa	OH BOY... You know some women, and some men, have this built in BULL  protector.  It's those little bells and whistles that go off when we hear or see suttle things that don't make sense.<br>  <br>  Saying things like you have a self esteem issue and you need to take care of that is immature.  Of course you lean toward caution.  If you didn't I would think you didn't learn from that last problem.<br>  <br>  I would go real slow.  But remember this.  don't let the past cloud your judgement.  Nor let you imagination run wild.  If you feel something is off then take the time to see if it is.  Seeing is believing hon.  Once you see what you fear then he has no grounds to stand on.  There is a song called "Smooth Operator".  Just remember someone wrote that song based on a reason and a personal pain.  Also do not condemn until you have the evidence and proof.  Protect that heart cause one day you might find you don't have the will or energy to believe in someone new.
bdcc8cec0e281f0887560a9b3b785c47aa	First thing Emily is to learn to like yourself. Becoming confident takes time and often means unlearning the negative feelings you may have about yourself. Its not easy, i know from my own experience. first step is to tell yourself " i am likeable, i am loveable" feels strange to begin with but after time you can make that feeling part of you. That will then reflect on how other people see you. i wish you well.|`|WAEDIWz8aa	hey emily,<br>  <br>  hunnie, you need to start a new page. i used to be like that. i didnt have a nice past with friends. theyve hurt me so much, and i decided to stop making friends and comunicating with people.<br>  <br>  i know its not easy to make friends. i find it hard to meet a good friend. <br>  <br>  im not saying that i have a true friend now... but ive changed for the good.<br>  <br>  i had soooo little confidence in myself and i always waited for other people to start a conversation. shyness was one big problem for me, and that was the problem. <br>  <br>  try to be more self confident. feel positive. and try to speak to people u dont even know, a simple conversation can start everything.<br>  <br>  do not be afraid to ask ur collegues to plan a night out. why not???<br>  <br>  i used to be soooo jealous when i see a bunch of girls all together. never had the chance to be like that, and until now. i find it hard to make friends and go out with them.<br>  <br>  but at least im not afraid to speak to people. and i made so much friends since ive changed. <br>  <br>  when i dont have any one to go out with, i feel so lonely and sad, and i end up going out by myself. sometimes i do meet some nice people around like that.<br>  <br>  god bless xxxx|`|lgXSmCQRaa	I feel the same way, I am 20. Everyday is dull. I dont know what to say to you, Im going through it too. Maybe we need to do things which boosts confidence and thus happy endorphins which draw people to us. I guess no one likes to be around someone who is sad/depressed and moody, don't we naturally gravitate to people who are happy? I know I do. We both also need to do things which help us meet new people. Do you wanna go backpacking? Im thinking of going lol.|`|5owT5hjWaa	Dear Emily,<br>  I am having the same problem as well, I dont have any friends at all, I watch as other people's lifes seem more important than mine. I once even thought of suicide, but i quickly rejected it. Im still miserable and depressed, but you know what? I think that the best way to make your life meaningful is to go out and make it. That is what i am going to do, I am going to make friends, get a job, and be someone! I suggest you do the same :)
VAI6MtPIaa	Try to find out if he likes you more than a friend first. Ask one of his friends or try to get a friend of yours to find out from him. <br>  <br>  Theres no sure-fire way for you to make him see that. You could always go up and talk to him because he just might like you as well.
sr7jX2wYaa	He was  trying to find out if you still had feelings  for him,. It is  a common head game that certain kinds of guys like to play, & chances are  he didn't think you would find out he was lying so quickly. I wouldn't  ever  believe a word  out of his mouth from now on. He won't  talk to you because he knows you busted him, trying  to be a cheater & player. so figures if he stays away & doesn't  say anything else to you  , you won't spill the beans to his girlfriend, but drop it knowing he was just a jerk*|`|1QCMJZKzaa	MAYBE HE LIKES YOU?, MAKE A MOVE|`|3a4c2d0397cc1dfb34193eac79a81bf5aa	It could be that he isn't fully over you and some part of him still wants you back into his life.

Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|NpSsLV9Oaa	the easiest way to start talking to someone is by saying hi and introducing yourself. then start talking about the things you have in common as you will learn more things about eachother and it will help you to get to know her better.|`|pkja3qteaa	Just talk to her.

qrI5ZH42aa	I think that there are two parallel feelings in long term relationships.  There's the long term feeling that you have for each other and it's love.  Then there's how you feel about people in the short term.  There have been times with my boyfriend of seven years when we've said to each other "I really hate you right now!" but we both know that it's a short term for-the-duration-of-the-fight feeling.  If we were angry with each other or having a serious three day long fight (like when we had to decide who would move and start at the bottom of the career ladder to let the other follow a promotion) and my family asked if I loved him I'd answer "duh, of course".  <br>  <br>  I think the long term love strengthens with shared experiences, I gave up a job offer to be with him, it means we're putting the relationship ahead of our own agendas and it's strengthened us as a couple. Love gets stronger with every problem you face together, every bit of affection you show each other and each time you act thoughtfully to the other even if it's a pain to you.  It gets worn out by people getting bored of the same old routines, arguing about things without reaching a happy agreement or losing trust in the other person if they're caught lying to you.  <br>  <br>  All these bad things will happen to all couples over a shared lifetime: financial hard times lead to fights about money, you can't agree about how to care for aging parents/in laws and so on.  But if you work hard to 'top up' your love by remaining attentive, taking time to spend with each other, enjoying each others company and compromising on other matters, you can not only survive all the crap but come out with a strong relationship.  <br>  <br>  I think couples end up unable to stand each other because too many live in their own seperate bubbles in a relationship: go to work, come home to eat, watch tv, go to sleep.  Then they wonder why they feel so disconnected from their spouse.  Or they don't have the same end goals in life so one or both ends up disappointed and blames the other for how their life has turned out.  So many people I know got married without ever talking about if their fiance wants kids, if they have any debts, where they see themselves in 50 years time basically.  Those are all relationship breaking issues that should have been sorted before a commitment was made. And people also underestimate the importance of having a partner who helps around the house, remembers your birthday and will come visit your parents with you even if your dad scares them.  Little day to day arguments like that also wear a person out, but it's what you get when you mistake a passionate romance for a happy in love feeling.  Sadly we're in a society where dependability is far too underrated.  I got my boyfriend because his ex found him too boring, and I feel like I bagged a treasure.  I get pancakes for breakfast every weekend, we split the housework, we've got the same priorities in life and I know he'll never ever cheat.  How can you end up hating a man like that?|`|IvMPh09baa	its just a phase... relationships go through many different stages, starting with the honeymoon lovey dovey phase, to the annoyed phase, to the irritating each other phase....|`|x3LclBZ0aa	contrary to what a majority of people think, hate is not the opposite of love, indifference is. in a relationship, there will always come a time when you feel like you cant stand each other. maybe hate is strong word, but ive felt an emotion very similar to it with my partner. but the trick is how do you deal with it? do you let that negative feeling grow and not try and solve whatever it is thats troubling the relationship? accept that for 2 people to be with each other supposedly forever, its quite normal to feel a wide range of emotions. as long as you still feel love and respect for each other, then those fleeting volatile emotions shouldnt matter too much. stay true to your vows/promise.|`|p6QizgmRaa	Jez, I certainly hope everyone doesn't end up hating each other! If the marriage gets to that point, it's time to reconsider and reevaluate the relationship.|`|ddP3klT3aa	No. Not all of them end up hating each other. A lot of them end up disliking each other. People marry the wrong person (not sure why).|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	Sometimes I tell my husband that I hate him other times I tell him I love him.|`|q95wDWjXaa	its something that passes with time...some people actually learn to ignore others so they just ignore the things that they hate...at least that's what i do
qNDh5U0Haa	If your the one flirting with my wife, you better back the **** off before I come find you.|`|AA11108018	Low lifes like you have no morals.

Just leave her alone.
YHrelMGCaa	Girls like it when guys are confident in themselves, and they really appreciate when guys randomly say sweet things to them. It shows that they care and they have guts. But girls hate it when guys are too pushy. We like things to be on our own time. Make sure he gets to know the girl first, before he asks her out. It's really annoying when guys just want to go out with girls because they think they're pretty. Get to know the girl first, and actually become friends before you do anything. just be yourself, and don't try to be anyone else. I would much rather date a guy that I can just be myself around and goof off with, than a guy who tries to be all cool and acts like he's better than everyone else.<br>  <br>  :) Hope I helped.

ml2FDYECaa	First relax...take a deep breath, and just go for it. Don't put too much thought into it. Take time alone to think about what you want to say, and then when you are saying what you've been practicing say it as if you are alone...like you've been before you've gathered your thoughts. Practice with a friend, and copy what you did in a relaxed atmosphere. Watch any Deniro movie to get some tips...he is a badass. Be the dominant one to get used to being in control. Always listen before you speak again, and don't say "What?"  alot...you're going to do fine. Get some time to go over things first...GL|`|RZfDrdIRaa	Try ro relax!

Seek out new friendships with both sexes, like bike riding, working out, etc. so you can talk to someone without making constant eye contact.  This will aslo build up your confidence because you will feel more at ease with conversation.  Most of all, just be yourself!! My husband was a very shy man in fact i asked him out on our fist date, we have been married 16 years, and he is more outgoing than i and knows no stranger.  I was attracted to him because he was shy and soft spoken, now he is even more amazing.  BE YOURSELF -- all will work out
Mq9z3qYEaa	OK, I don't think he is "perfect" if he lies..<br>  Maybe you should re consider the perfect part.<br>  But if I were you I would tell him how I felt, and see what he says and see if he feels the same way too.<br>  Just remember lying sometimes end up to cheating..|`|WO3dtNB5aa	if they're little white lies i wouldn't worry about it, just keep an eye on him.<br>  but if they're big lies, let him go.

dFHsAXDMaa	Unfortunately you can not make anyone love you love just happens and it is not going to happen by telling millions of people on yahoo how you feel silly tell her how you feel. offer to help her work things out with the people she has issues with at school. she is obviously really scared of them if she does not even come to school because of it maybe a principal or teacher you trust can help her. Good luck be honest tell her how you feel and hope she feels the same. No one who is brought into your life is a waste of breathe you will learn that God brings people into your life all the time and every one of them touches you for a reason. from great loves to the person you smile at as you walk down the road you make a lasting impression on them all to saying hello or have a good day with a complete stranger. that smile and hello or have a good day could make all the difference in the world at that once second.

Ova4dilbaa	First off, this guy sounds really annoying and paranoid. How could you like him? If communicating with him comes with the price of being harassed by his ex-girlfriend, you should just stop. He might have told his ex-girlfriend to get her jealous, she found your number, and decided to annoy you until you back off. Maybe she's not over him, or he's not over her. He obviously seems like he needs some help with relationships.|`|UKtZS3Wraa	long distance relationships are hard. you shouldnt get into anything with his ex who obviously still likes him. it seems you really like him, though. maybe you should pay him a visit?|`|7Q7dFghmaa	She's a freak show.<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	he probably got back together with his ex.|`|jGKGlxAuaa	Well we all know the kind of reputation guys in Seattle have. <br>  <br>  Enough said.<br>  <br>  Stick with Good Ol' Indiana Boys!|`|FIG58FVpaa	It sounds to me that he either got back with his ex-girlfriend or met someone that he could have a relationship with IRL and I'm sure they wouldn't approve of him spending 10 hours a day chatting with you or constant text messages back and forth.<br>  <br>  Send him an email asking him what's going on... and then be prepared to just forget about him and get on with your life.|`|RnFpjFODaa	He likes you, but he probably likes some other girl who lives near him. Boys, well at least the ones I've known, always love to have as many options as possible. If you really like talking to him, text him. But don't act too pushy because if he doesn't wanna talk there's a reason behind it. <br>  <br>  Girl, I've been through the same thing. Don't overthink too much of it|`|F4OiEF65aa	hayliee  , i kno how it feels been there done that,  i had to stop talking to her tho , it got to a point where it was turning beyond a joke that she ended up coming half way down the country to see me, it was riduculous , but dont worry jus best to meet peepz u kno or meet in person <br>  <br>  thanks for the 10 points haylies :))|`|kDbsdmLbaa	It sounds to me that he has gotton back with his ex. He probably didn't know how to tell you he didn't want to talk anymore so he got her to contact you. I would just leave him alone. You could probably do better and with someone in your own town.|`|cGNaZU4Gaa	For best quality, don't talk to random people online that you don't know on a regular basis.  Its just weird. Go talk to a random person IRL.|`|uQZQTAAlaa	If I were you I wouldn't chat with this guy anymore, he's a stranger and plus his ex is physco.

This is when you thank God that you do live so far away.  That's drama...and you need to steer clear.

If she got a hold of his phone to text you back that goes to show you they are together at least long enough for her to get her hands on his phone. AND why is she going through his phone... bottom line she doesn't trust him -Think about it when you hang up the phone he could be doing anything with anyone and its not like you can ride by his house and spy- definitely not what you want in a relationship. Find someone else to spend time on, sounds like you're a great gal and someone worthy deserves your time- he may be a great guy but he obviously has issues that you don't deserve to clean up- especially that he lives so far away...|`|Pe7pXCbwaa	Hmmmm....I think that the guy you met online already was dating his ex girlfriend and started dating you. As soon as he thought that he was going to get caught, he ended the relationship. I also believe that the girlfriend came over and read his text messages while he was away and then she started texting you. Perhaps he isnt texting you back because he is trying to get his girlfriend to not be mad at him (for texting you). I don`t think he is worth it....Besides who gets with their ex from over 2 years? Don`t sweat it.|`|QDsXN2Dqaa	I think your online friend is desperate and emotionally unstable. He had become dependent on his communication with you, and when you stopped texting him he felt desperate. Then he turned to his ex for help, being unable to handle the things himself. it was actually his decision, and he only used his ex as a tool to put it to action.<br>  <br>  My advice is to stay clear of him. Would you like to be in that girl's place? And since you never actually met the guy, how do you know what he is in the real life? I've met people like this, and one thing I can tell you -- you should stay clear of anyone who demands an explanation for failing to call them (unless you're married or in a LTR). If you let him do this, he'll end up implanting a GPS transceiver in your head.
RF2YV9ataa	If you mean all throughtout their marriage then you should refer to Genesis on the story of Abram (Abraham) and Sarai (Sarah) which is the best story that i believe personally depicting a loving marriage from start to death|`|f3f91dd57aebd8b8c7e30811c1868857aa	Somewhere between Genesis 1 and Revelations|`|91ba808e7cbaa05530f306c80d49a7f9aa	There is no where in the Bible where a woman is told to love her husband, but there are many stories where marriage is involved that through example, teach us that concept.<br>  <br>  We are instructed in Ephesians 5:21 ?Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.? 22 ?Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.? 23 ?For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.? 24 ?Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.? 25 ?Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;? 26 ?That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,? 27 ?That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.? 28 ?So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.? 29 ?For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:? 30 ?For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.? 31 ?For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.? 32 ?This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.? 33 ?Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.<br>  <br>  The word "reverence" in the instructions to the wife really brings out the idea of love, yet it goes well beyond what we often think of as love today.<br>  <br>  Please read through this scripture carefully and think about what it is telling us. We need to get back to these old time tested teachings about marriage.<br>  <br>  If you would like more iformation, my e mail is open.<br>  <br>  Greybeard<br>  <br>  ?|`|aDhZIhQcaa	All over the place throughout the Bible.  Particularly in both books of Corinthians, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, just for a few.  Your marriage is a state of mind and an attitude.  Unfortunately, according to the Bible, it is up to the woman to set the "tone" for the home.  For example, if a woman is in a bad mood, her children are walking on eggshells and usually will have difficulty in school that day.  Likewise, the husband will be tense and have a stressful day at work, all because the children and husband left a home full of tension and anger.  And if you really look at it honestly, it is true.  Love is a choice.  But we as humans, don't want to take responsibility for our choices, so when we become unhappy, we can then blame our spouse for our unhappiness instead of looking at ourselves.  I love my man with all my soul.  He is everything to me and I accept him, faults and all.  I wouldn't want him to be perfect because than I would have to be perfect and there is NO one perfect, except for Christ.  And we are commanded by God to love our spouse the way Christ loves the church.  We are told by God, to love, honor, and cherish our spouse and submit to each other.  And to love each other as we would want to be loved.  I hope this answers your question.  God Bless You.|`|AA11988503	I don't think it ever explicitly says for a wife to love her husband. It says to honor, obey, and respect him. But obviously you would do that out of love.
RvQ8Q3JRaa	I think she should tell him. She does not want to start out her marriage based on a lie. I think she should be honest with him and that would alleviate a lot of stress from her life. Plus it would give him a choice to way his options. You can't build a solid foundation based on lies and secrets.|`|8McA6xqPaa	Honesty IS and always will be the best policy in a relationship.

I know most people don't think that's true but it is. and to me it looks like you have good qualties.... just have a little more faith in your self!|`|dueKTHXxaa	No way! I'm overweight and I don't like to brag but I've had my fair share of guys. No one's ever complained about my weight and a lot of guys loooove it! Won't ruin your chances at all, and if a guy DOES get put off by your weight, is he REALLY the kind of guy you'd even want to be with?|`|YTHmYqllaa	depends on the guy, personally, i dont mind a little extra wieght but  there is a point where its just too much. some guys dont care, and some guys are really shallow.<br>  i happen to be between the two, i dont think wieght matters much, but a nice body helps alot|`|tBsdlKdIaa	i doubt it. if a dude doesn't like you solely because of your weight, he<br>  is a jerk. and sometimes being overweight or curvy is attractive to some guys. be proud of your body because no matter what anyone says, it's beautiful|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Curvy is good. Obese is not. I wouldn't date an obese girl, it's likely (but not always) that she doesn't take care of herself. it doesn't ruin the chances, but again, it doesn't help.|`|YUjVFkocaa	1) This is a shame, considering weight is the easiest of all of those to control!  I've worked endlessly on my personality, and I can only make myself so tite, no matter how i try.  But I can get ripped by working out, or get fat by letting myself go... controlling weight is easy!<br>  <br>  2) Your chances ARE pretty dashed, and considering you didn't give us an exact weight, I have to assume it's probably pretty bad.  And since you never even MENTIONED you might be open to hard working out and running and lifting and sports.... I have to fear it's much worse, still.<br>  <br>  3) No offense, but good looks and weight DON'T go hand in hand.  You can still have a pretty FACE AND HAIR (sometimes).... but OVERALL, if you are fat, you WILL NOT be pretty.  The body is an important part of being pretty.  And not just that- but at a certain level, your FACE even starts to get pudgy, and (no offense!) this grosses me, and most guys, out.<br>  <br>  4) Intellect is always good for future, so NEVER disregard school.  However, it has almost no bearing on getting a guy...  at THIS age.  It's the same with guys- girls go for hot guys NOW, and smart guys LATER in life.<br>  <br>  5) NO OFFENSE FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME..... but I DONT have anything against you as a person.... but from a guys POV:<br>  <br>  One of the things that bugs us THE MOST is a fat girl who's confident in herself!  It's the "big fat friend" mentality... we're trying to get a slim, athletic, shapely girl... and then her "big fat friend" comes over, acting sexy/jealous/confident/whatever you call it, and wrecks it.<br>  <br>  Even worse are the fat spanish/black girls who think they're the sh*t. cuz they're not.  If they were SLIM they would look good, probly- but NOT when they're fat! (some white girls do this too, and some asians.. but mostlyyyy black/spanish girls)<br>  <br>  ===================================<br>  <br>  After reading these 5 tips, you are probably angry, confused, and hurt.  You're asking me, "Well- if guys LIKE confident girls, but you hate it when a fat girls confident, isn't that sort of a catch-22? If you see a fat NON-confident girl, won't you hate HER TOO? This is hypocrisy!"<br>  <br>  The answer is:  Unfortunately, yes.  Fat girls are screwed, and are destined to be hated, WHATEVER their confidence level may be.  Fat confident girls disgust us, as they're NOT sexy when they think they are; and non-confident girls turn us off in general, naturally. same w/ girls.<br>  <br>  ------------<br>  <br>  So, you ask, "What the hell do I DO then, if I want a guy?"<br>  <br>  Well, my answer is probably going to be the hardest thing to take, out of everything here.  And it is this:  You MUST work out, run ALOT, lift weights with high reps of 20-25, do a CRAPLOAD of ab work and circuit core work daily, and play either basketball or soccer!<br>  <br>  If I were to make you a daily workout schedule, I'd just give you mine, and you could do less of it.  ROUGHLY, it's this:<br>  <br>  mon, wed, fri<br>  <br>  lift weights- legs<br>  circuit ab work for 10 minutes (high intensity, high reps, no weight)<br>  do 6 100m sprints, and leg plyometrics (leg speed drills)<br>  do upper body cardio- punching bags, upper-body-only bicycle machine<br>  play basketball for 30 minutes to an hour<br>  <br>  tues, thurs, sat<br>  <br>  lift weights- arms<br>  hard ab/core work with weights: do situps, & side/back extensions<br>  do upper body plyometrics<br>  do a 2mile run<br>  play soccer for 30 minutes to an hour|`|RWA0hLlOaa	It doesn't ruin the chances but it doesn't help.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Being overweight is irrelevant. Unless you weigh like 500 lbs, you will be able to find someone regardless. If they reject you based on that, then they were garbage at the end of the day, anyway.|`|UFrcaQQZaa	Totally as long you pretty u b ok cuz im a lil think (im 145lbs) nd i have a boyfriend now if you were ugly that a deal breaker but jus a lil thick girly girl trust and believe u will b fine|`|szcA8CDyaa	Yes you'll get a date but harder to get one if ur overweight and yes it ruin your chances.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	Absolutely not.

I think so long as he never acts on anything and cheats on you, its quite natural. Im great friends with a guy I once slept with. He has a girlfriend...but its all good. Nothing is going on between me and him. Perhaps it is the same in your case. You cant stop him associating with women just so you can sooth your own insecurities!<br>  That said, if he makes you feel unloved, unappreciated on a regular basis, ask yourself why you are with him! If the bad outweighs the good, consider a break up. You should be happy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and that it works out! <br>  Xxxxxx|`|YBIiEF3Paa	Dump him!|`|3RjT6INzaa	well if u told him it bothers u, and he didn't listen then u should check out other guys in front of him so he can see how u feel.
vBooSQtNaa	my husband talks to my females friends and thats ok, but if it goes to another female i dont know hell no its not ok! its wrong! i hate it and yes i get very upset over it!|`|JCdBSULraa	Umm if it bothers you, you have a duty to let him know so he can at least have the chance to respect your opinion.  Otherwise, as long as he doesn't misrepresent himself as being available, I don't see a problem.|`|qP289F9taa	I'm going through it and I dont like it...<br>  <br>  Because he'll say shes just a friend and maybe she is<br>  <br>  but<br>  <br>  sooner or later shell be flirting with him...
e8AuHDlYaa	Love comes at all times to people of all different ages. It's definatly pissible you two could be in love or falling in love. I say go for it but if you don't know him very well then be careful and don't get yourself into trouble. But don't give this chance up-he could be your guy. Good luck!|`|X6gz0qKLaa	yes, it is wrong. it may be hard to see now, but you are actually in very different places in life, not to mention that he could be thrown in jail if he does anything with you. if you're really meant to be, it can wait another year and a bit until you are 18, but honestly, most older guys just use teenage girls for sex because theyre easy.|`|W618lfZ6aa	You are pretty young for him, at least till you hit 18.<br>  <br>  If you two truly like each other and he isn't just using you for sex then I would do this.<br>  <br>  Find out the local age of consent laws, even if you don't have sex he can still get in trouble, it only takes one person to accuse.<br>  <br>  Talk to your parents about it, if they approve then good deal.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Q8YHZ5g8aa	There is nothing a 21 year old and a 17 year old have in common. He will get in trouble if you two sleep together. I would say try finding someone your own age.|`|XwMn6aY5aa	it's not wrong plus.the only way he could get in trouble that's if you call the cops,but i think you wouldn't do that since your falling for him..as longest he respects you it's ok but if he just wants to fool around its not okay..so it's up to you.if i was you i'll go for it but if things get a little disturbing  i just would stay away from him..good luck|`|WDS2DASnaa	well it's illegal to, you know... have sex with him, but i think kissing is okay.<br>  <br>  are you sneaking around with him or are you guys public? if you're really really into this guy you should tell you family and stuff. if not, take it slow.|`|c5b488ff1d027aa50957b02bc976c5bcaa	At 16 years of age, you're probably at your prime. If you don't pursue a relationship, there's a good chance he'll rape you.|`|S0K6OqGJaa	yes its wrong your too young e just wants to get in your pants hun sorry to say
7THgBSvfaa	No it wouldn't be to strong.. You have already been talking for a few months and have already chilled together.. If you go to the movies with her it would not be awkward...|`|kERP7zAhaa	no, you should ask her out to the movies.
Mq9z3qYEaa	Your question isn't very specific..<br>  Did you move when your parents got divorced?<br>  If you didn't then I don't see why you can't still hang out with your friend on the weekends..have sleepovers and such.. i'm sure your school friends will understand I mean you see them at school everyday right You can pick up the phone and call her every now and again and let her know that you haven't forgotten about her, plan a day .. go out and watch a movie on a Friday night or something.<br>  <br>  And if you did move, she can't think your replacing her cause you guys are far away... But there is always a phone call, and it doesn't take much time at all to pick up the phone and call her.<br>  <br>  Edit: Well maybe this weekend you guys can chill together.. movies.. sleepover...play games like board games etc.. if she still doesn't understand after that you need to be honest and talk to her and let her know that she is not your only friend anymore, and you are trying to be friends with everyone equally.. Maybe she's just jealous you don't depend and talk to her only any more, but you need to explain to her if thats the case that you have other friends, and you try to spend/talk to every one of them equally.|`|NURUNAsXaa	Tell her that no one can replace her and that she will always be your best friend. Do more things together so she knows you truly have not forgotten about her.|`|bMEwiGQ2aa	This is exactly what happened to me and my BFFL<br>  <br>  I have been really good friends with her for a LONG LONG LONG time!!<br>  we talked on myspace everyday  and den one day she like wouldnt respond so i called her and she was acting really weird so I made sure that I would see her sum where (like in skewl) den I jsut followed her around and acted like I didnt notice she was mad.....We started talking and then the next day I just stayed with her and every time sum one else would come up to us I would say hi umm can i cath up with you l8r me and meh bff r talkin! kay? and den da whole day was just me and her now we all good!! and BFFL's again
hOWNwpCLaa	Personally, I prefer to be spoken to as a human being, rather than an object for your eyes to gawk at.  So, a simple "Hello, how are you?"  would go much further than "Hey, hot stuff."|`|a1iam8Zvaa	well it sounds like your only talking to her for her looks and not cuz just want to talk to her<br>  <br>  idk how it resembles to trash tho lol|`|jdah4ZA2aa	"Hey Hot Stuff" sounds like a line.  Personalize it, next time...haha. <br>  <br>  No, girls like to be talked to without their looks being brought up right away.  Although its a compliment, hearing about the way you look makes most of us think that the next line would be something along the lines of how much the guy wants to sleep with us. A compliment, sure ... but not necessarily what we're going for. <br>  <br>  Blame it on the losers who ruined your line :P|`|JCdBSULraa	Well saying hot "stuff" is by definition objectifying her, whereas some girls would rather be treated as a fellow human being.  Most girls like being objectified though, so just try someone else.|`|fBdtvrWdaa	Maybe its because you sound like a womanizing pig? If you want to compliment a woman call her beautiful or exquisite or some other cheesy but effective word.|`|lYjweuZmaa	idk... teen guys and girls say that to each other just as a hey whats up type of way. she likes drama the way it sounds/ idont see anything wrong with that|`|2S2onP86aa	I don't know. If you don't know her that well, maybe she thinks you're just looking for something physical. Try to call her beautiful next time, instead of sexy or hot stuff. I think a woman would appreciate the word beautiful more than any other word. It's more respectful. <br>  Try saying "Hi beautiful lady, how's it going?" I think it'll work better for you.<br>  <br>  Give it a shot, and wish you the best of luck.|`|AYy9da7laa	I'm sure you had very good intentions, but women don't like to be approached like that, because they probably think you use that line on a lot of women, you need to make a girl feel unique, so compliment her in a different way---don't blatenly hit on her with a line like that<br>  good luck next time!|`|wuyjidC0aa	well its just not a good way to compliment us. like hey Beautiful would be better. but they still might take it the wrong way just cause its coming from a guy? and normally they say it like that cause they want something.|`|Wkmgtyojaa	Regardless of her perception of the intent of your comment, your comment was lame. Maybe you should think about something a little more creative or witty to say.|`|xCjUEiB3aa	Hmmm i would say it depends on the girl because if someone said HOT STUFF to me i would think they think im a **** idk some girls just dont find that giving a compliment...You should have said "Hey beautiful" ;]|`|iAdRYpLEaa	She might not think your respecting her, everyones different i suppose.|`|gUPUSTEuaa	well maybe next time you should be more respectful to the girl .|`|YrgDYOixaa	coz women want u to like more than they're appearance ..  8)|`|cydakP87aa	some women do find that derogatory....<br>  not all of them, but some<br>  most girls prefer to be called beautiful over hot<br>  a lot of times though women are not interested in pick up lines<br>  just a simple hello or something along those lines will probably work<br>  start a conversation and act like you are interested in her and her life and that will work better than almost any pick up line in the book <br>  good luck|`|ocTMBXncaa	Some women and I can speak for myself here...dont like when men are constantly saying youre hot etc etc etc.  Id honestly rather be told I was adorable or cute because then atleast its tapping into my personality a bit.  Maybe shes tired of being told that and just want someone to appreciate her for who she really is...or maybe shes just having an off day and is a bit irritated.  We can all get that way from time to time ;)|`|bhQrRfTUaa	Did you know her? Because unless you did...thats kind of trash talking. Girls like sincerity. It would have been more more simple to just walk over and say hi. Humility is important. Arrogance is extremely irritating. But confidence is good. Just say hi and you can say "Nice dress" or something but if you dont know her well you cannot just sit down and say hey hot stuff...|`|n7zMHNRWaa	i dont think thats trash.. its a compliment but maybe she feels like your only talking to her cuz you want to get some, or because of her looks. maybe hey how are you doing would work better for you lol. <br>  <br>  try beautiful next time... ( only if you think she really is, of course.)|`|io1cRt87aa	she sounds well stuck up and bitchy...<br>  <br>  i think she just doesnt like you :( sorry...|`|9HyKCmpnaa	If she found you attractive she wouldn't mind
Mq9z3qYEaa	Thats not the kind of guy you want to be with trust me, like you said he cheated on his girlfriend with you, what makes you think if you guys did get in a relationship at some point he wouldn't cheat on you? Regardless if he got back with his girl. he's a CHEATER, he's not worth your time, especially if you text him and he doesn't text you back.

And you can't blame him because you told on him and mess-up his game... But why would you want someone Else's boy toy?  Go get your own.  and I hope he doesn't cheat on you because what goes around comes around ten folds... REMEMBER THAT...  You are a loser and so is that guy...  Get a life...  I never thought I would talk to someone this way but really you are both very wrong to have hurt that poor girl that way and you should tell her that you are very sorry too.|`|UFrcaQQZaa	O no girl 4get bout him you were the other girl not the main girlfriend and they always care about them the most bascially he played u nd u were his groupies for example she get parda nd u jus dinner and movie<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  she long term and you were jus a good tyme he needed for a lil while.|`|3RjT6INzaa	it sounds like he don't wanna' tlk to u anymore, becuz <br>  1. he's a player<br>  2. he cheated on his gf w/ u<br>  3. u dated 7x<br>  U should just give up, quit wasting ur time on him. i know it's not easy forgetting about someone u love, but s**t happens u just gotta' deal w/ it.|`|sY8F5cytaa	i think that you should forget about him and move on because he doesnt seem worth it if he keeps on cheating on girls and playing them... u dont need that!|`|e5MQTEMcaa	YOU GO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE IN WATCH HIM GET MAD BECAUSE YOU WITH SOMEBODY ELSE..

eae407c249076a56758cc99d008a9d3baa	Find the territory, as in find out if shes already liking another boy or is going out, or if shes simply looking for someone to be her new "guy."<br>  <br>  Don't immediately start flirting with her or staring at her constantly, because that may easily break your chances. <br>  <br>  Once you declare the territory (mentally) you then decide on what to do with her. If she flirts with you in any OBVIOUS way, or stares at your (check out) then you obviously know that the territory is completely open for your takings.<br>  <br>  If not, or if you are unsure, simply wait. Paitence sucks, I know, but if you don't want to take a risk that may not become fruit, then don't take it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Wkmgtyojaa	Try using proper punctuation and sentence structure.

7tJNspGNaa	Firstly, let her know you're her friend and that no matter what you'll be there for her. <br>  If you think the relationship she came from was bad (no selfishness here) then you need to let her know that, and help her realize and recover.<br>  <br>  Let her know there are many people in the world, and that there ARE people that will treat her every way the right way.<br>  Make her feel your care for her, and let her know you're there... stand by her even if you might not be the one; people never forget the ones who were always true to them.|`|XMXgeJPFaa	break it up man.  if you want her bad enough and you have good reason to date her then get in there and tell her how you feel.

You gotta go for it or you'll never know brotha.|`|sKCxxdNBaa	to dad bud she's getting married you known LOL|`|SR1FN2nqaa	let me get this right. she doesnt want to go back to her ex but she is going to anyways just because he asked her to marry him ? sounds to me that she isnt the type of person you would want to be with in the first place if she is willing to go back with someone just for marriage, thats pretty stupid to say the least. why did she break up with him in the first place ? sorry but she sounds wishy washy.

In fact it's not something I've ever thought about, and hope that most people are the same way. <br>  <br>  Most sisters don't care what their brothers' body is doing, especially not in that region.

OJXfV529aa	I'm thirteen as well, so coming from someone who has the same situations, I would get to know him, like talk on the phone and stuff. And to make conversations just ask him about what he likes, like if he reads, what are his favorite movies, bands or whatever. If you really end up liking him and he likes you back, maybe introduce him to your parents and ask if maybe they will make an exception to the rule.<br>  <br>  Good luck ! :]|`|u8HYfTnyaa	you should exchange number etc. and let him get to know you better. 13/14 is young for a relationship. you should find away to let on how you feel to him, whether by being up front or subtle hints. you should follow your parents rules though. 15 is only a sophomore, there is no rush here, and once you get older more hot guys will be available.|`|d3gc60wAaa	go and talk to him and maybe ur situation might change for u and maybe he'll like u to and want to try and work it out between the to of u

pZevjTXGaa	From the way you are telling the story, I'm gonna say a 60% chance. All I can say is to be careful and definitely observe her.|`|40476bbce9e2f1306244d82795226962aa	I don't think just because she goes to club it has anything to do with having a relationship. They reason why she might have went to the club was because she didn't have anyone to spend it with that's why she would have went out. I say you should give the girl a chance but it's the other way around since that what you think of club goers she should give you a chance.|`|ptclgKl5aa	Good question, I'd guess the majority aren't looking for a boyfriend, but I could be way off.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	Take it from an actual girl ... not a guy...<br>  <br>  Lots of girls in clubs/bars are looking for relationships and boyfriends.  We assume that most guys in clubs/bars are looking for hookups, though.  If she says yes, she is interested in getting to know you better!  Good luck! <br>  <br>  One thing, though, is if people are drinking, they downplay potential problems with a relationship.  For instance, I once met a really good guy in a bar.  We hit it off and I wanted to see him again, but when I was sober, the hour and a half drive between where we lived seemed like a much bigger deal than when I was drunk.<br>  <br>  I just threw that little thing in there so you realize that there could be other factors that influence her if it doesn't work out, rather than anything about yourself personally.|`|AA10827247	Just because it was valentines day doesn't mean that's the reason why she made out with you.  Since she did make out with you and she said yes to the date; she must be interested in you. Girls who go to clubs are looking for some fun that doesn't mean they don't want relationships. I think that because of all the "activities" that happened in the club happened she is interested.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Its looking good so far, why are you stressing out so much about it? Plenty of girls that go to clubs are very interested in a relationship, in fact that is why a lot of girls go there in the first place. Stay nice and calm and relaxed about this. No need to worry, just go with the flow and hopefully everything will work out well for you!|`|NP98ui6xaa	girls in clubs are just people and just so you know... im sure EVERYONE in the world has been to the club. so that means every girl isnt looking for relationship? nahhh not tru. you def have a shot.. play it cool and shoot her a text maybe tomm or tonight like..

Just because you met her in a club doesn't mean she is not looking for relationships.  Just get to know her, she might be the girl of your dreams ;)  Cheezy, I know.  But you never know!  Hope everything works out!|`|s90DY6Dyaa	most people who go to these places are usually lookin for a 1 night stand. Buuut this girl might be different. I dunno, youll just have to get to know her by spending time with her and see where it goes.|`|gEd1jlOEaa	Yes they do, It sounds like she is really into you! I would say about 75% girls go looking for relationships!|`|qTm7WV6Taa	yes she would be interested. and she would only know how much intrest she has in you|`|nlQLzJljaa	tbh most of em are looking for a one night stand or just fun...|`|lOGHxtoUaa	thats why they go to clubs to find a guy who is fun. <br>  <br>  i say 82-98%|`|G9DeVtE6aa	she might be looking go for it|`|uPTJM3m9aa	it it were me id be in for a relationship  cause i dont like one night stands but every one is different|`|nXSpS3Axaa	1 night stands...

You should call her tomorrow, you have nothing to lose. Hopefully you have something there.. Good luck =]|`|cgQrQSvDaa	yes! not everyone at the bar is looking for just a one night stand some people are not into that at all.|`|yyvcryrbaa	go out with her & see.|`|wi6mkT30aa	I don't do clubs because I don't feel that guys there are into serious relationships. Plus if the guy is there that means hes into the party sence and interested in all that kind of stuff and I'm  simple laid back person that isn't into all of that. so guys that go there aren't into serious relationships to me, I'd think the girls there would be the same.

wi6mkT30aa	This is a really tough situation. I think that really depends if he is serious or not. You don't want to waste your time, yet if he is serious then wait for him! You two can still talk and be friends and have a promise to each other. Just don't have any sexual conversations. Act like your dating just don't go too far, when I mean act like your dating I mean learn more about him. See if hes somebody you would really wnt to be with in  3 years, if yes then great wait! If not then move on.<br>  <br>  This is  a good opportunity to see if this guy is the one or not!<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|CM0C65dtaa	You should date other guys.

You can't make a heart feel what it won't.<br>  <br>  He sounds like scum anyways, why would you want to be with a man like that?|`|IPj3GRoxaa	I've gone through the same exact thing except a little more drastic. First, don't take him not sharing his feelings or anything like that or not really talking one minute and talking to you forever personal.Don't let your emotions get involved with this part of Communication. Second, don't worry about labeling the whole dating bf/gf thing. just hang with him, talk , laugh...ect. as if nothing ever happened and dont ask are we bf and gf! Just let your friendship/relationship connect in a new way. This will relieve you of all the stress your having and you will realize who cares what you technically are because once you do this he'll let you know what he really wants to be without you trying to stress over it all. <br>  PLZZZZZ take this advice I did this exact same thing I'm telling you and now were MORE than BEST FIRENDS heck were more than BF and GF (no were no married lol) Its just like our friendship/relationship is like the most amazing thing ever!!!!|`|P3Fot172aa	Just as there is a Friend Zone for guys, there's a Booty Call Zone for girls.

Be the best person you can be,be kind to others, and strive for your personal best, and everything will fall into place. I don't know your age but there is always time for love, don't worry he will come along.Smile even when you don't want to.okay.I wish you all the best.
g7uMKvEzaa	To me it sounds like he is sure he loves someone when he says I love you. When he says, I think I am falling in love with you means he isn't sure, but he finds himself thinking he loves you more and more.He really likes you but not necessarily loves you , at least not yet. You definatley got his attention though..Good Luck!|`|O9HLoDj9aa	Maybe in this scenario, he feels obligated to say it. But normally, when someone says I love you and they really mean it, they're set in their emotions towards someone. When someone says they're falling in love with someone, they're in the process of falling in love, but not all the way there yet.

LjV0MTQYaa	Well, love is a powerful word. You can't love someone the first time you see them --love at first sight has proven to be non-existant-- and so it takes time. If you've been dating for a while (or maybe you connected so quickly, it didn't take long) then usually you just...know.<br>  <br>  Usually, you can tell if he loves you easily if you love him, too but haven't said it. The way he looks at you is a given. If he just stares into your eyes without saying much, with a look that is kind of lost, but he's really thinking. he may not say anything.<br>  when he kisses you, you can feel it. it has a lot of passion and he may kiss you slowly...but don't mistake soft kisses with love kisses. he may just like to kiss you.<br>  <br>  it all has to do with eyes. that's how I knew my boyfriend loved me.<br>  prom night, he was dropping me off at my house and we stood in my driveway and he looked at me a certain way, like he wanted to say something. and i was thinking at the same time that I loved him,so I knew. I asked him what he was thinking. he smiled, looked down shyly and simply said "nothing" but i was trying to get him to say it anyways, but he wouldn't. i knew he loved me because i could see it and i felt it, too.<br>  <br>  then, two days later, i brought it up again and it took him forever, but he finally told me that he's in love with me =]<br>  it was very sweet.|`|UzRdgOetaa	I am 15 years old and my boyfriend Harold (he is a lightbulb) is 542 years old.

I would not let him back in your life that easily. He shouldn't be able to dump you when he feels like it, and then be able to get you back when he feels like it. If he broke up with you twice, then he needs to realize he gave you up and that you're with someone else now. As for your relationship with Matt...maybe you should just not be dating anyone right now. Its not fair to Matt for you to be in a relationship with him when you're in love with someone else. Maybe some time to be on your own is what you really need right now. But I definitely wouldn't jump right back into a guy's arms who has hurt me twice already - I would feel like I was asking to be hurt again.|`|fdba29ac998fb7c3451e59cdd2e80c3eaa	You can not love somebody and profess to have your heart smitten with somebody else.

p8eknTQQaa	Well, I can't really see a better option than actually talking to him, thats the best thing, if you really must know what he feels about you, then you must find a way to talk to him, you could write him a little note or letter.<br>  <br>  Also, you can always get closer to your mum by asking her if she was telling the truth, tell her how you feel and what you want, she is your mum, do you not trust her?<br>  Do you not think she trusts you?<br>  <br>  Well, whats love without trust.<br>  <br>  One of the best things that goes with love is courage, courage is the greatest thing, you need courage in all parts of life, so start finding courage to talk to people about subjects like this, it will help you now and in the future.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best<br>  <br>  Have a great time and make it the best you can|`|eMc9eLBtaa	lol,just see what happins

He claims he is always tired, always sick, he goes to the doctors every single week for test of all sorts, he constantly complains about having to get up and go to work. He gets so low energy that he won't even get up and put his dishes in the kitchen..he just stock piles them on his bed side.<br>  <br>  Yes.. He needs a shrink.  He was offered one but refused and of course that old  rule in the medical field.. "its his right to turn down help".<br>  <br>  What I do to keep myself sane.  I stop making his problems my problems. If he wants to sit there and die...let him. But he isn't taking me down with him.  I go to the gym everyday, I make sure I stay busy because the second I am not, he wants me to wait on him hand and foot, I made my own section in the fridge of all healthy food that is all mine and he orders what he wants. I make sure I HAVE MY own life.<br>  <br>  In my case..it is very well possible just severe depression but you cant force him to get help. My husband thinks its something physically wrong with him..which this is the part I don't get because he can go to all these appointments but can't go see a shrink...so he goes like clock work to a doctors appoint every friday.. Tomorrow is neurologist , week after that is ultra sounds, he has had stress test, heart test, blood test..and it just goes on and on and on...<br>  <br>  Men are interesting  creatures..if they loose a part of their "manliness" in some sense that is important to them...it turns into a dramatic disaster for them.   <br>  <br>  So if you are able to get your husband a shrink...go for it. and then come back and tell me how in the hell you did it..because mine needs one too.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	Just ask him what he wants to do, and all you can do is be there to support him|`|5hxWSezPaa	Things will not change unless he goes to a psychiatrist and gets antidepressants.

Yes its a frustrating situation since you don't know how to help him but show a strong support. Don't give up on him or yourself. My best answer would be to try to research on the computer or with other doctors to try to figure out his illness. Perhaps calling or contacting docters from across the U.S. Can you post the symptoms and what exactly it is that he is suffering of? Maybe someone out there might have a loved one or heard of a similiar situation like yours. It never hurts to try. My beshest wishes and God Bless you. Stay strong and never give up hope!<br>  <br>  p.s. I don't think anti-depressants might work for him, id say relaxation and a lot of praying for his illness to go away.

He want to leave me for Dakota Fanning or Brad Pitt but Harold the lightbulb is my one and only love!<br>  <br>  He especially likes it when i plug him in and he lights up.<br>  <br>  Once i tried to kiss him and burned my lips.<br>  <br>  He cheats on me everyday with an elephant named Lucy from Guam. She is a Guamanian. (Half elephant, half cheese)<br>  <br>  This morning Harold was too intent on watching historical fiction that he was paying attention to drinking his oragne juice and he spilt it on me. Then he burnt hole in the couch (he was plugged in)<br>  <br>  Harold has a pet robot named Harold Jr. and his mom is a pencil and his dad is a polar bear.|`|mUMMLjDdaa	i suggest you go to a church social for people in<br>  your age bracket.|`|4e5b3604525939a6fa0e40c9b5f5bf7aaa	u don't have to visit websites or learn a technique just get out there and LIVE UR LIFE, that way they'll come to u, than u running in all the wrong directions.|`|BdeoYKokaa	Hang out at a casino, nuttin but oldies wastin their SS checks at the penny slots.
GoABmevnaa	hm... girl I don't know what to tell you. This has kind of happened to me before except my bf was just touching me outside of my clothes... he said he thought it would be sexy if I woke up to him "wanting" me, but I personally think it's kinda weird. <br>  People get weird sexual tips from strange places, and maybe that's what your boyfriend did... BUT if this is the case he should've told you what was going on.<br>  But reguardless, this is very unacceptable and inappropriate... he disrespected you and your body.. a big no-no.|`|4HoVVCenaa	He is wrong to do this. It is sexual assault under the law.|`|AA11363680	If it bothers you that much, and he can't be bothered to accept your feelings on the matter, then you should consider breaking up with him.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why it scares you, he's probably just trying to get you really horny. Going so far as calling it assault is a bit much if it's the first time. But because you have specifically told him not to, then it gets bad.<br>  <br>  It's up to you if you want to give him a chance to straighten out, or if you just want to end it now.|`|vkPlX2Y4aa	Break up with him. If he's pathetic enough to fondle you when you're sleeping, he's desperate. You're better than that.
ZAz7SEcfaa	You make him sound really creepy and weird... he sounds a little insecure..maybe not a place to start dating.
ub2Dtzn0aa	You knew there was something there long before you had the courage to ask. He shouldn't have done what he did but it was before you were married, not that it doesn't still hurt you deeply. You need to seek counseling and although you may forgive him you will not forget this event. Its going to make things difficult going forward but if you really want to you can get through it. The fact that you both feel that the wedding wouldn't have taken place had this been revealed means you both need to decide if you want to put in the work necessary to get past this.<br>  <br>  Your not being an idiot at all. Your facing this difficult situation with a great deal of maturity and wisdom. The hardest person to be honest with sometimes is ourselves. Can you and are you willing to deal with this and put it behind you? Is what you have to ask yourselves.|`|5tCTrxoYaa	I'm sorry but you sound like a young nag. You know what he did was wrong and he knows it, but it was before and this is now. Move on. Do you really want this to damage your marriage?|`|65ojSBXgaa	To be honest he wasn’t as dishonest because he did admit that he slept with someone else. What you’re going through right now is what happens when some one you loved and trusted hurts you even if he didn’t mean to; cheating is cheating. You feel betrayed, disrespected, hurt and mad. How to deal with dishonesty? You really can’t you will have to let it go and trust him again. This is not easy because you dealt with it once and you are afraid he will do it again. If you want to ease your pain this is what you need to tell him:<br>  Ask him, Why he did it? What is the reason? Did he have feelings for her? Or did he do it for kicks?<br>  You need to ask these questions to deal with this problem. If he don’t give you an answer then obviously he did it because he can’t control it. But listen the positive thing I see is that he almost shed tears this is very rare but a good sign because he realized the mistake he did and regrets it.<br>  Talk to him and let him know how you feel ok he is not a mind reader and doesn’t know how you feel. Good Luck –Gail<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  If you find it in your heart that he loves you and wont do it again?<br>  Forgive him love him again and don’t give up. There’s no such thing as<br>  A perfect relationship!|`|yOHCXiaMaa	You have your own answer.  Why should you care what happened prior to saying "I DO".  That's like him asking you how many boyfriends you had in the past and did you sleep with them.<br>  <br>  Honey life is too short to go around getting upset over something that happened prior to marriage.  Yes, you were wrong in asking him and in a sense being messy and snoopy cause he could have lied and told you he didn't  have anything to hide.  <br>  <br>  WHY do people go around looking for problems.  You should consentrate on "after the I DO's".  Now he has promised to stay only unto you.<br>  <br>  If every woman divorced her husband because he had a "last" fling there wouldn't be too many marriages.  Playing a "better than thou" will end in one thing "unhappiness".  It will serve no one except those who want to cause pain and in the end there is only one person who will ultimately suffer.<br>  <br>  Consentrate on the now behavior and be happy.|`|AFjehuZ5aa	Somethings are better left unknown. You were not hurting before but you just had to know now you are crying over something you should of left alone a long time ago. Now all you can do is give it to God and let him worry about it. I doubt that he is going to do it again, I mean he was honest to you and now you won't let it be. Give it to God.|`|zaIPpr9naa	What is your religion? If you don't mind me asking what do you mean by He had gotten saved 2 weeks before?????|`|CzNxbsmsaa	WWJD|`|34b40Vu3aa	Go back to the pastor for additional counseling with your now spouse.  This will help.  <br>  In answer to what is "saved"?  It means that he is now a Christian because he accepted Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior.  That Jesus is the Son of God and the only way to heaven is through Him.  That is what saved means.

4EWCegiRaa	Well... I think you'll find that being a 13 year old girl isn't as easy as you may think an that while he says he wants to wait until he's 18, that will probably not be the case.  And it's insanely easier for issues to arise than you could ever imagine.<br>  <br>  With that being said, she shouldn't be obsessed with it either.  THE BEST WAY to get her off your back is to show that you're mature enough to have a boyfriend.  And the best way to show her you're mature enough to have a boyfriend is to talk to her like an adult.  <br>  <br>  Just explain that you understand her point and that this constant conversation is driving you crazy.  Ask her what it'll take for her to stop talking to you about it and trust you.  Just express yourself is a calm mature manner and she'll come around.<br>  <br>  Just don't forget that for as hard as it is to be a teen, it's also hard to be a parent of a teen.  Be patient with her.|`|LjV0MTQYaa	Don't worry 'bout it. It's natrual for moms to be that way. As long as you know that you aren't going to get pregnant and you trust him, then it'll be fine. Respect your mom (and yourself) by not having sex without talking with her first and from what you've said, that's what you intend to do. <br>  <br>  She's going to keep talking about it, and all you can do is listen to her. It gets annoying, but it's going to happen.|`|IwTnhhJ7aa	listen to her. <br>  shes right <br>  <br>  alot of girls get pressured into haveing sex because they really think the guy likes them. ( they just want to have sex) <br>  trust me its scary at age 13 or age 16 going into the doc saying " i think im pregnatnt"<br>  <br>  Freaking scary man, plus you give up your virginity, you give up your soul, your emotions, your heart, your life<br>  you gunna regret it for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  u cant promise your mom that it will be ok, because even you dont know it will be ok.|`|AA11769829	She is probably reacting to how society is nowadays. Urges are quite strong, indeed, and it's most likely a parental fear and concern she carries.<br>  <br>  However, in agreeing with the answers posted, by assuring her you are interested in a caring relationship right now that doesn't mean overtly physical contact, and through time in showing her how this is true, she should come around. And keep communicating with your boyfriend, too, so he fully understands how BOTH girlfriend -- and mom -- feel about it.|`|BBK7i1A7aa	Ooh, that's awkward. You should tell her exactly what you wrote here: "Mom, you can stop talking about that stuff. We're mature enough to wait, and it makes me uncomfortable when you talk about it - it seems like you're expecting us to do it!" That last bit should quiet her.|`|w1kxVQqzaa	YOU NEVER TELL UR MOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NEVER!!!!!!!!... IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!<br>  IF U R UNDER 15 DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A0e9JyS8aa	The best thing you can do is do things for yourself, don't put your life on hold because she could go with the guy she likes and where is that going to leave you? no where, so take care of yourself, first and let her see what she could be missing without you! <br>  <br>  don't let her see you sad, disappointed, she needs to see you as a strong person who can handle himself in the worst situations. don't call her because you don't want her to feel like she has you no matter what,  give her time to miss you and see what you both had together.<br>  <br>  <br>  if she's already liking someone else, maybe the feeling she once had for you weren't true to begin with. because a woman who is truly in love has no room left for another man! i wish you the best of luck! :)<br>  <br>  remember whats meant to be will always be meant to be. no matter what!|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	The only thing you can do is give her space, and hope that she comes back.  You can't force it, and shouldn't have agreed to the break.  You should start calling her your ex-girlfriend, as she is probably sleeping with the other guy, and taking advantage of the fact that you are so devoted.  End the break, and call it a break up.  <br>  <br>  You can do better, and deserve more.|`|GxSnVRAOaa	Look- if she really likes someone else, then she can't love you the way you deserve right?  I think it's nice that you want her to be happy, but if she doesn't know what's going to make her happy it's up to her to figure it out.  If I were you I would stay away from her, the whole thing is trouble...she obviously doesn't want to be in a relationship with you so let her explore her options, but don't remain available for her!|`|Mj8EP8bIaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`|`|9NfLuHo9aa	. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`<br>   Times 2..she's long gone and even if she stays who knows what next she gonna be looking at/liking.

You have been together for almost 3 years out of the blue she asks you for a break. She tells you that she loves you but she likes another guy.( Lets break that down she don't love you enough and she likes this other guy more. I am sure this is no last minute choice on her behalf because i am sure shes being seeing him secretly on the side. )The best thing you can do is let her go and move on and if you really need comfort remember you once loved a really nice girl who did not love you as much. Don't judge her to harshly i am sure this was as hard on her as it is on you. <br>  Take Care
vkPlX2Y4aa	Ask him if he wants to push your cart.|`|sCr2iTczaa	well then if you don't want him to pay then just simply tell him you would rather feel comfortable if you payed for your self.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Let him take you out, men dont feel like men if they don't get to pay every once in a while!|`|iLQ87NSUaa	i would say go for it. if you feel uncomfortable with him paying, go someplace that isn't too pricey, that way, the bill won't be that much. you could even make a deal like he buys dinner, but then you can see a movie together afterward, your treat.|`|TT5T8jV0aa	Offer to pay but accept if he insists.

But sometimes, they'll destroy you.|`|XuoT57Idaa	It took me 8months of dating my bf to say I love you. Are you "falling in love" after a month? Don't set yourself up for failure.

SOmrEqXoaa	Don't write a letter. Too much potential for harm to your ego.<br>  Take it slow. Start sparking up conversations in the hall, maybe invite her to sit with you at lunch. Since you don't have classes with her, chances are you don't know each other very well. If you're shy, I wouldn't jump into anything. Take your time, get to know her. If she likes you, it'll show. Trust me. And then maybe start by asking her out on group dates, like a movie or dinner with a bunch of friends. You're a bit young, so dating is probably not really an option for now. Especially if her parents are a bit conservative, they won't be happy about their 13-year-old daughter dating.<br>  <br>  Smile at her in the hall. MAKE SURE SHE KNOWS YOU'RE NAME OR YOU'LL CREEP HER OUT! Become her friend, but make sure you stand out to her in a group (without being that obnoxious guy...)<br>  <br>  =) good luck!|`|3X0SJatxaa	i'd concentrate on school if i were you, because while you're worrying her you'll be getting bad grades at the same time.|`|nbBbRFxbaa	Just hit her up ....

You will just have to go up to her and tell her how you feel and see what happens.  The worst thing that will happen is that she will not return the affection.  You don't want to pass a chance up with someone you like and wonder the rest of your life "what could have been."|`|IcUsSPeUaa	First you have to get to know each other. When you trust each other, know each other inside and out, and have confidence they you should ask her out. This way, it'll be easy for her to say yes. <br>  <br>  Remember: Think you're ugly?

I remember the first time I glanced at you, it was as if, time stopped, and the new minute came to a halt, until you made me breathe again, then the new minute came to resume itself in place.  Your the most beautiful living being I have ever seen, but I've been a tad bit shy in saying so to you.  Maybe we shall hang out sometime, and if it's possible, send me a note back giving me your phone number, I'm never late at calling the girl of my dreams.  If you decide that I am not for you, it's okay, we shall be friends, right?  We could still hang out, and share some moments together.<br>  <br>                      - Yours Truly, (YOUR NAME)<br>  <br>  ***I put in the note that you are shy, because most girls think it's cute and more romantic that your shy and not able to do it yourself, also, I put in the note that if she decideds not to, to be friends, well, because, friends always lead to something else, and, in time, she may come to conclusion and see the real you, and start to like you all over again***|`|4e5b3604525939a6fa0e40c9b5f5bf7aaa	You say " Hi, my name is _______, I know u've noticed me before, but probably not the way i've noticed u, either way I thought that it was time for me to stop being shy and brave up to the girl that I find beautiful and ask her if she finds me ineresting and if it would be possible for us to hang out, or be friends."|`|jbPptRhlaa	Whoa that crazy!<br>  The same thing happened to me, but Opposite.

Just say stuff like I really like your personality and think your beautiful. DON'T be all-your sexy babe, wanna date??? Good Luck!|`|eMCCQD8Faa	ASk her already.......believe me...take my example, a couple guys have told me years later that they used to like me, n sometimes I would notice but they were always too shy to tell me. If she says no, then dont worry theres always more opportunities in life. If u dont risk any u dont win any|`|cOBsDBgqaa	just ask her to go with you to a movie with other friends.<br>  the worst she can say is no and you end up just staying friends.<br>  just ask her if it is ment to be it will all pan out.<br>  no worries.<br>  and good luck|`|XXatDFnKaa	dont write her a letter !<br>  <br>  How embarrassing !<br>  <br>  Start looking at her again, and then start some conversation just like ask her "how are you" or something basic like that and then build up the conversation and then ask her out !<br>  <br>  simple as that :)|`|0PPgi8xpaa	ASK HER!!!! whats the worst that can happen..... she will say no. really its not like she make fun of you for it the worst that would happen is that she would say no.    so go for it!!!!!<br>  <br>  hey i answerd yours can you answer mine????|`|PNI7dMfqaa	I'm in a physically identical situation. I think you should start off with a friendly hello and add her on ICQ or MSN or Facebook or something. when your talking online anything goes. if something goes wrong say its a hacker lol.|`|MopcYgDRaa	just ask thats the way it always works no mushy stuff like flowers just get ther attention like doing and saying funny stuff in class than ask because she will know who you are a little better|`|Vka09geaaa	go up to her and say hey would you like you go out with me sometime because i really like you, your ..... and ......... and ........ and ........... :) x|`|XjkdUliGaa	ok if i were you i would ask her out at like a dance or the avenue or something in person tho|`|VFyERjSSaa	if she likes you then just go up to her and say I like you a lot and will you go out with me? <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|qPfhXZw0aa	write her a letter :) cute, sweet, and she can read it over and over again lol|`|YxTIK1oiaa	do it|`|HB9Usu11aa	I'm in 7th grade, I'm 13 in 2 months. You should start casual conversation with her, or even better, because you're shy, you should ask someone or ask her to get her phone number. Text her but make the text simple and subtle and it's important to remain anonymous for the first two but don't sound like a stalker... just say something like, "Hi, I'm in your Music class" or whatever and she'll say, "who is this". That's the time when you say, "guess" and, after three tries, that's when you say, "it's -----, and I just wanted to say that I really like you." It's easier over the phone, and it's being confident but not too confident, and it's playing 'hard to get'. :)|`|QZpZsc6jaa	If it were me, I would tell her what you are telling us....<br>  <br>  Be real, ladies love it. Tell her you're shy, but you want to get to know her better and it's hard for you to tell her how you feel.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about what she does and don't try to relate who she looks at to who she likes. 13 year old girls are just as confused as 13 year old boys and she's probably trying not to look at you on purpose so she doesn't seem desperate for your attention.<br>  <br>  Just keep it cool and be real, you'll have the ladies lining up.|`|wlfOhnDoaa	Does she have a facebook or sort of online profile? If so, if you get chatting again, maybe get her yahoo/msn addy and maybe try and start from there :) show her your still interested. Go for it! x|`|UhBfGjZFaa	ask her out it won't hurt. i hate when guys are too shy!!!!
MTPoGd1qaa	Umm.... ask her like if she is single, and maybe if she would like to meet up some time 'to catch up'
af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Don't look at him as anything more than a friend. He's lonely and far from home, and he's basically using you to feel better because you are familiar. <br>  Don't let it stop you from seeing others, especially since HE doesn't see it as exclusive. Don't let yourself love him, he's playing you.
4EZcG3YSaa	I am going to meet two of my contacts who live just up the road from me, and soon hopefully :-)<br>  king of the jungle owes me 8 so far|`|h1qCOpFEaa	i would love to meet several of them, like the one two above me who i think a lot of and am very fond of to say the least.<br>  <br>  luv ya Kat, mwah|`|sCr2iTczaa	I actually made a friend a YA and we give each other very good advice and he is a very good friend. btu we have never met we live in different states|`|f58ec99bd12e60acd134f41c8821665baa	Nope I wouldn't..|`|3b352647c1451744c77be95b0723c695aa	I never have but if I felt that there were a connection, yes, why not. <br>  It's just another venue to socialize, it's as good as any!<br>  <br>  I take it you mean Yahoo answer right? Well, that's what I understand.|`|8a3822ced036f956bfbf2ffe198d7003aa	I haven't, but I know that I would meet up with certain contacts of mine...|`|MTPoGd1qaa	No please don't do it?!|`|S4VVE0onaa	not sure!!!!!!!|`|KzXv8ZKEaa	yes i've a few in mind but how?|`|6k5fhFyBaa	Yeah--one is one of my best friends in real life lol...other than that I haven't.|`|DmKH9ZaRaa	Only the ones I sleep with .... LOL ...
zbr5X7Wuaa	yeah, I have the same problem. <br>  I just asked the guy why he talks so much online but not in person<br>  and he said that he will start talking<br>  so maybe so will this guy of yours.<br>  Or you could just talk to him and then let him feel more comfortable to talk to you. Then talk to him on a regular basis and he will talk to you too.|`|9DXsYu6Waa	i am almost in the same situation as you!<br>  the guy i like also goes to my school.<br>  we text each other constantly about really deep stuff too,<br>  but in school, we dont talk at all. it is extremely awkward, i know.<br>  i have no idea why it is like that though, maybe ask him if it really bothers you.<br>  i dont really care, thats why i havent said anything to my guy lol|`|qucE4Epoaa	when you pass by him in the hall just smile, or say hi and he'll say hi or smile backkkk, and most likely soon you'll start talking more in school too.|`|qKGbvKe6aa	lol funny but he may be shy. watch what you talk about...might bite you in the @$$ later on|`|I6pmPb1Baa	if you have any inside jokes just use that.|`|e8Z2FVofaa	It seems only a little bit odd to me.  I think people are more comfortable talking online because it is sort of anonymous even when you know someone in the real world.  Sounds to me that this is what you guys got going on.<br>  <br>  Since you say you talk a lot in the chat rooms why don't you ask him about it there?
0fVtHNtmaa	I honestly think you should communicate. That is the true key to making it work. I had a bf like that and we went our seperate ways after 2 years because it was going nowhere. I asked him where we were going and he didn't have a sound answer so I ended it. Life's too short.|`|FIG58FVpaa	You should definitely talk to him. I think that if things are bothering you enough to ask for advice here it's a big enough concern that you really need to let him know how you're feeling and see if he feels the same way.<br>  <br>  You don't need to be passionate about the same things. It's very uncommon for two people to feel the same intensity about the same exact things... <br>  <br>  You really just need to be headed in the same direction on big things like whether or not you want to get married, have kids, stay in the same geographic area that you're currently in and stuff like that. <br>  <br>  If you're on different paths on major things you should probably think about ending the relationship... Otherwise, as long as you enjoy each other's company - don't sweat the small stuff.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2xtRI2Ogaa	blaah blaah blaahh blaah blaaahhhh|`|UbR9pYrxaa	The best way to have a good relationship is to be honesty and tell what's on your mind. Just sit him down one day, with no one else around and just tell him what's on your mind, and try to work it out. If he Truly cares about you then he will listen and try to work it out.|`|BZiZr4Hcaa	The best thing is to talk about it, he wont know and wont bring it up unless he knows what's going through your mind. It's better to have all cards up on the table and know what's going on than be wasting your time and not knowing what may or may not happen.|`|jbPptRhlaa	Well, you've been together for over a year, he should understand you well, right?<br>  And if he doesn't then maybe he isn't the guy for you. and so what if your not into "it" as much as he is, that's normal.<br>  So tell him how you feel...or show him. whichever works.|`|uhIWemycaa	Of course u should talk to your BF on how u feel the key to a successful relationship is communication without it u both would not understand each other at all, everything u just said and wrote on here u should be telling him especially a topic like this and ask him how he feels about so u two can come to an understanding...|`|AA11841749	That's very healthy in a relationship to have your "own" interests.  Even if you don't particularly find his interests exciting, you can still talk about them.  If you had everything in common, it would be boring.  I don't see anything wrong with your situation.  By having different interests, you don't get so sick of each other.  I wouldn't worry about it unless it bothers you that bad.  Be open and honest about it.
p1RdTbP2aa	Talk to him and ask what went wrong. But I am a bit confuse in your thing you say you said "I actually loved you" How did this lead to the silence? A<br>  nd it's past tense "loved" maybe this is why he won't talk to you because your words are used came out in the sense of I used to love you and then you showed him Harry!<br>  Oh I don't know?<br>  Confuse!!!<br>  The only thing I can say is try to talk to him and ask him question to get oyur answer.<br>  :)<br>  Good luck
IPj3GRoxaa	To me the fact of having a big sound system in the car is a sign of a a guy that simply loves his music. and to me that is so not a turn off. In fact its a definite turn on. If you get a girl that loves music as much as you. You wont have any problems. Heck I would love a guy with a huge sound system in his car. That just means more music!|`|EheFkTH1aa	well if you have a pretty sweet car then i guess its kinda cool, but if not then kinda lame. Also its pretty cool how your into cars and stuff but girls (well i cant speak fr all of us) are not too interested in cars, so we may notice but we probably wont think much of it, as long as your don't blast it while we're in the car.... or coming to pick us up, we don't want to hear you from down the road.|`|9298mlxoaa	I don't care as long as it is not loud.|`|NtCya5NYaa	i guess it depends. ive seen some guys do it but thier just chillin with their boys or just listening to some tunes but i've seen others who just want to get attention and make sure everyone knows that they have a good system.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	I tend to think guys like that are show-off posers - it is a major turn off.<br>  <br>  I also can't help but imagine what you're doing to your hearing. You'll be deaf before you hit 30 and I think that's sad.
Tf19RETiaa	i really don't think many girls care, but i do since im into cars.<br>  go with the Infiniti, like the white, love the black. the black rims are a nice touch. i just put black rims on my range rover.<br>  good luck deciding which one you want|`|qNOeBcvraa	dude, look at my car! i dont give a sh*t what guys think     i built it all in about 2 months and i love it    yep   and i got a great guy  who just likes it cuz it makes me happy|`|s96Vo1dyaa	you shouldnt get too egotistical about your car, because hot rodding around like every other jerk will not attract girls.<br>  <br>  BUT if you dont squeal your tires like a loser and blare rap music, or any other kind of music for that matter, i MUCH prefer the looks of the Infiniti G35. Hands down. Theyre so much more classy.<br>  <br>  Good choices though.

Within the next 3 years, your body shape will change to what it will be until your mid 20s, that's when you should start worrying. You're still a growing person, so there's no reason to be self-conscious about anything.   <br>  <br>  Also, if you were 18 and 5'5, 109 lbs, you would be borderline underweight.  The minimum healthy weight at 5'5 at 18 and over would be only be 111 lbs, so even then you're not far off.|`|JpyjecHuaa	stay how you are<br>  guys probably like tiny gurls<br>  moms critisize evrything, if not this then that<br>  and teachers try to get closer to students<br>  and dem girls are hatersss<br>  <br>  remember karmas a ******|`|40476bbce9e2f1306244d82795226962aa	I DON'T THINK YOUR TOO SKINNY  I WOULD LOVE TO BE YOU SIZE I'M  5'3 AND I WEIGHT 120 IBS.

Just ignore them.  If you are 5'5 and 109 then that sounds perfectly fine to me.  Everyone is built differently - so even though your hip bones may stick out, that doesn't make you underweight - it's just the way your pelvis is situated.  I'm 5'3 and 125 and my hip bones stick out, so it's just the way I'm made.<br>  <br>  If a girl told you to gain weight, she is rude and has issues of her own.<br>  <br>  If a guy said you were tiny, that's because he's a dumb guy, and he probably meant it as a compliment.<br>  <br>  Your mom on the other hand should be someone you should discuss your weight with seriously.  She shouldn't be criticizing you unless she really sees a problem.<br>  <br>  Your teacher is completely rude and out of place to ask your mom if she feeds you, and I hope your mom told them that.<br>  <br>  People are going to say dumb and mean things to you all of your life.  You can't let it get to you.  If you are happy with the way you are, just ignore them and move on.  The only reason people criticize you is because they have their own insecurities.

7a05bab8b928d83e778d8b40f32bd323aa	Be there for him. Help him if you can but if he needs space, give him that. If you think he needs a hint, you can always say to him, 'Come on, you know I really like you, let me help' - the ball's in his court then. If he says, it's okay I can  work things out myself, then that's a signal for you to back off, if he says great - then he probably feels the same way as you do. But don't be used, don't do all the running. Good luck mon amigo!!|`|fec3ec404f1665c708fb3151ad9af15faa	Help him through whatever he is going through (if you can help), the fact that you were there for him when he needed someone is pricesless(forget Mastercard).

V4ONcH1Daa	This may seem creepy, but do you have a facebook or myspace? Stumble upon hers by searching her name and adding her. Get to know her better there so it won't seem as awkward when you ask her out in person.<br>  <br>  If neither of you have one, wait until you run into her again and strike up a conversation. Say "Wow, it's so weird I keep seeing you." And  later in the conversation find some common ground, maybe you both like coffee? Or bagels? Come on everyone likes bagels! Ask if she wants to come with a couple of your friends for breakfast before school and tell her she can bring her friends so she doesn't feel awkward being alone with someone she doesn't know well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!
6xwXf3tEaa	well, I have never experienced this, but I am a male cancer, so here goes...... First of all, do remember the cancer signs planet is the moon, and just like tides the moon governs, we can have EXTREME shifts,both in mind and mood! Its not suprising that he came back though- cancers are very home and family orientated, and he must have felt alone and confused, just long enough for him to realize what he really had. ;) congrats, but be careful with him. Forgive him enough for him to feel loved again, but not enough for him to feel it was ok, or it could happen again!
ngFbWBLsaa	Yes. It seems that you are in a pickle. Well, I say that you should contact this girl and tell her how you feel. And if she brings up anything about her facebook... tell her the truth. You have feelings for her. Girls love it when the guy is confident and open. Just say something along the lines of, "I really did like you while you were here, and I miss you. I just can't keep you out of my mind, and I hope you feel the same." And if she doesn't like you, then it's her loss. There's other fish in the sea. Happy Hunting. :D Ally.|`|DWrS7Eggaa	I honestly don't think you can. I think you should just move on, which is unfortunate because this girl seems to be a real sweetheart. Maybe you should think twice about stalking someone next time.

jRSzIzYqaa	Sometimes you can't control whose feelings are going to get hurt. If he does ask you, you just have to tell him that you see him as a friend and his friendship means too much to you to mess it up like that.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Tell him sorry but you are actually into someone else, if he asks who just say he doesnt know him :)|`|gxnXbftHaa	Tell him to run the other way because your husband is being released from jail in march.|`|iAi38fboaa	Before he even asks you or anything, talk about another guy around him....say you have a date together.

AA10032971	What one person considers beauty, may not be what another person agrees is the case. Again, above all things, don't waste your time on the material things. I want for you to be naturally yourself and be a great listener. This will put you forth better than anything else. When you are invited out to parties and other entertainments, try to make it a double date or a group gathering. This way, you have more choices as to what reputable folk you will want in your company. Peace!

IOmrbVWSaa	good question!!!!=]<br>  Awersome!!!!!!!!|`|zlSlhSiPaa	You don't know it's going to happen, but it's really awkward before because of that. But it is so natural, like you have done it ten thousand times. Afterward, you feel like you just gave a piece of yourself up for that person. Your relationship goes up a great notch in a second. you two feel connected eternally. This usually happens with any kind of physical contact. It's just you don't notice it as much when you hold hands, because that's not that big of a deal. Intercourse though is the completion connection. The first kiss is somewhere in between the two.|`|g5vQYWrzaa	Germs and am I doing this right? <br>  Special it was my first KISS, I was 17 yrs old.<br>  Oct 13, 1979 just after watching Saturday Night Live.

Maybe he feels guilty, like he should explain what happened.  But he has to look tough in front of his friends so that is why he is talking about you.<br>  <br>  No matter whether he hates you or not, he doesn't like you any more so you should accept that and move on.

2hcA3VP9aa	i think that you can give him the occasional wave or gesture indicating a hi. but i should warn you, it only works if he is looking at you. and waving at him with a smile might work, especially if you have a cute smile. after a while you can move to the occasional hey verbally. if he is embarrassed to introduce you to his friends when y'all start dating then he might not be the one for you because i don't do that with my girl even though she was nervous to meet them at first. so good luck and i hope that this really helped you . have a good one.
iwvRBeXOaa	He wants what he can't have-simple as that. He likes to flirt and he likes that you give him attention as well. Don't fall for him, he's a user and will most likely use you in the end. You'll meet a thousand guys just like him in life, you have to learn not to fall for their crap early.
cj0edEvKaa	He's probably not ready to commit (still wants to date around). Some guys will start to pull away when they think things are getting to serious.  But if he is telling you that he just wants to be your friend you should accept it no matter how much it hurts.  If you don't think you can just be his friend then I suggest you distance yourself from him.  Maybe somewhere down the line you can become friends again.  As for now you have to think of yourself and your happiness!  Its not going to be easy but you are going to have to move on.

7RyZ5fzlaa	To stand out you have to be unique, but you don't want to be too weird or else she will think you have nothing in common.<br>  <br>  What do normal boring things that are just her male friends talk about? Probably what she did like you mentioned, talk about what is going on around the school, talk about the weather, jobs... boring **** like that.<br>  <br>  If you want to grab her attention tell an interesting story, a joke, or ask her something unique (I can't tell you what because I don't know this girl, but I am sure you can think of something).<br>  <br>  Once she finds you interesting you can start flirting back and forth until you are comfortable enough to make you move.
lIpjuMTHaa	I say go to Baskin Robins and get the biggest sundae you can find and then go talk to a good girl friend on the phone for hours. Something similar has happened to me and you know, the best thing to do is focus on good friends and not think about that guy.

She said she didn't like me in that way ( Opposite to you me being a lad and that) and I have tried to get to know her and stuff but she doesn't want to. She talks and that but only talks and only when she has no one else to talk to. I try but well I'm hardly the most confident person and she is more so and could be with more confident people, or who she likes. <br>  <br>  The thing that hurts you is the fact they don't think about you, or don't let it on. You never know where you are with them. Like you they had opportunities but obviously don't want to take them, so I need to get over her. The best way I would say is let time pass, but it's been about a month since I told her and got rejected and well I still can't get over her. I think about her alot of the time, where she is, who she's with, whether she likes someone else. Sounds bad doesn't it! I just need to forget about her and get to know someone who cares how I feel rather than themselves. <br>  <br>  Sorry I've gone on a little about me, just needed to get it out, but hopefully I've let you know you're not the only one. <br>  <br>  Hope it gets better =)|`|8bZ9mxIIaa	oh... i totally know how you feel...<br>  <br>  best way to get over someone is to find another.... or time will heal things^^
zHI6z5FZaa	depends on maturity. but on average:<br>  <br>  13 & 14 - you can look at each other and smile, nothing else.<br>  15 & 16 - you can make out and fell each other up, i wouldn't recomend having sex but its up to you.<br>  17 & 18 - you can f*ck each other sensless if you want|`|jUVx5mb5aa	as far as you feel is right. Dont do anything too far until you know they love you. im 17 and i have been dating my girlfriend for 7 months and we had sex but we both waited to make sure it was right. you dont want to regret anything.
N6Nj6V2Taa	Honestly there are two options<br>  <br>  1. You can stick to it and say your just best friends and thats all you will ever be.<br>  <br>  2. You can either <br>      a. Make a move<br>               or<br>      b. Talk to him alone<br>  I kinda suggest B because going in for a kiss or something and getting denied because of confussion would hurt alot. On the other hand if you just talk to him and tell him that you like him and would like to try things out but no matter what you wanna remain friends dating or not.<br>  If it doesn't work out it will be hard and almost impossible to go back to the best friends or just friends domain but can you really never try and not regret it ?|`|ZqDvQprCaa	i think he likes you :)|`|6yXlP6kfaa	He may or may not. It really sounds like you too are just best friends.|`|VSXUa9lraa	He could just be a really good friend, I'd do that for some of my friends but I don't like them.<br>  Ask him a little about it, be subtle but that's really hard because people know what you're going for.

eccd862f398f745a83ca00f1e1517e3eaa	First off, sorry for your loss.<br>  But truly, I'd forget about her, if she says she's "in love" already with another 2 months after you and her broke up, she's probably just trying to screw people over. Plus people who are with another person for such a short period of time (less/more than one month) and is already saying that this is the perfect guy and wants to get married soon has no common sense.<br>  For you man, I'd say forget about the woman and move on. If she wants to get back together, say no, after what she did to you from what you said she doesn't deserve a man like you. Being friends is fine but I recommend not going anywhere beyond that. I also would recommend you look for another woman to get your mind off of your ex.<br>  Hey, its your life, you do what you want to do with it, this is just my opinion, use if you want, but best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  -A.J.|`|PYKMdAzLaa	Do not waste your energy and time.<br>  <br>  Things are different.

If your the only girl he trusts and confides in then he shouldn't be stringing his girlfriend along. Ask him why he's still with her if he really doesn't care about her and see if he'd be willing to give you a chance. Just not while he's still with her. Remember you don't want to be the other woman even if you hate her. Think how you would feel if you were in her shoes.|`|p6ZWB0LOaa	sux it up and ask him out

46fouwFfaa	I think you mean Somali. Somalis are Muslims but most Somalis don`t like getting their ethnicity guessed wrong since we are very proud of being Somali. Plus, she might be tired of repeatedly being mistaken for being Arab. Many Muslim women wear the hijab - not only Arabs. Just apologize to her.|`|CCXMW0HYaa	I think, when you mentioned "Arab" she was thinking you that you thought she was with the terrorists. People are still raw about September 11th. and so, you'll have to use your words carefully. You should have said, "What nationality are you?." That is none threatening and she would've been okay answering it.
CCXMW0HYaa	First and foremost, I want to say that I congratulate you for being one of very few women in this world that will put themselves out there and ask a guy out. No, sweets, you aren't overreacting. He wasn't interested like you wanted to and the rejection doesn't feel good at all. Remember, you are special, you have value, and you have alot of qualities that the guy of your dreams is going to appreciate. Who knows, maybe your best friend will start to see the great qualities in you and ask you out when you least expect it.
z6O5ifdGaa	Maybe this isn't the guy for you...<br>  <br>  it sounds like he's a nice guy to hang out with, but not someone you can be romantically involved with.|`|4EWCegiRaa	So what's the problem?  The fact that he won't pay or the fact that you're too materialistic to be with someone who won't pay.<br>  <br>  Personally, I like to pay for the date and I think it's the gentlemanly thing to do.  However, I have a problem with someone who EXPECTS to be paid for.
7e4jxj3Daa	Not in the end.|`|zGUmB3qaaa	it doesn't matter just doing it is what counts<br>  <br>  but in my personal experience if the girl says something first its easier because they usually know what to say....<br>  <br>  but that doesn't mean waste your time waiting for the other one to make a move....<br>  <br>  so no it doesn't matter who goes first....
3fKeLrpWaa	well first of all, dont put yourself down! from wat you said I can tell that most of those ppl are airheads that are too worried about material things.Remember that material things arent what make you, its the things you do for other and your personality ^^ You need to walk into that school w/ confidence. If there are things you are interested in, try to join clubs, the more contact you have with people, the higher the chance you'll find a good friend.Dont let their comment hurt you because by treating you badly for no good reason, it means that they are the ones with the low self-esteem. good luck! =D
tV2pboBJaa	How to kiss <br>      When your lips meet, keep them slightly parted and <br>  press gently against his lips. Tilt your head <br>  slightly to one side, so your noses won't get <br>  in the way. <br>        What do you do next? It depends. If it's just a <br>  little kiss, a peck on the lips, move away but <br>  (this is very important) don't move away all of <br>  a sudden, as if you were disgusted by his kiss! <br>  Just move away slowly, maybe while still holding hands, <br>  and looking in his eyes. <br>  <br>        On the other hand, if you're French kissing, read on <br>  <br>                                French kissing <br>                               (  or Frenching) <br>  <br>  <br>        French kisses are kisses in which you also use your <br>  tongues. (That's why you part your lips slightly.) <br>  So, after you've started kissing, the next step <br>  is that either he will slip his tongue into your <br>  mouth or you'll slip yours into his. Don't let your <br>  tongue go limp but move it around his, or playfully <br>  push his tongue out with yours, then let him <br>  push your tongue back into your mouth, and so on|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	first i make my lips kissable then i kiss them twice then if were alone i use tounge.|`|V2iRZysgaa	Well, first, most guys I've kissed wear a massive amount of lip gloss and slobber as much as possible.  It's definitely a turn-on.  Wearing crotch-less tights also helps.|`|P8Z9rZNSaa	Relax your lips. I love when my lips feel cushioned by a woman's lips. Partially open then and close them as you feel the gentle pressure from his lips. After a couple times, gently flick your tongue against his. Make it tantalizing and make him want more of your tongue. I love when that leads to a more deep, passionate kiss and then it moves on to touching but that is for another question|`|qXsiWzJtaa	i like to be kissed, with her arms around my neck with my hands on her hips or around her body, with one of her hands on head pulling me in, you can use tounge or wateva juss make it intresting and fun ... and tease a lil bit act like ur gonna kiss him and get right there! and then pull away jus a lil to let him no ur playin but dont play to much lmao ... but yea fun and intresting ;-9 <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|W1GHZW3Caa	if you're hot then in public
by8Czojuaa	"just to tease you"<br>  <br>  Are you trying to say that you know she isn't interested in you??<br>  <br>  If that's not the case, why don't you just ask her out?<br>  <br>  ** (BOYS) Why do you like to use the word "delicious" to describe a girl's butt? **<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AotDCWolFRtjawMq7sMyiNLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090221150524AAxqbEg">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|qnxH8bOlaa	Ask her out
XBSShH11aa	Why Not|`|AA11982696	sorry but hes lying to you. he likes someone else. <br>  :[
8yncQq62aa	if they didnt like you, they probly wouldnt be flirting with you... its common knowlege. good job in wasting 5 points. thanks for giving me 2!
FAHe8ednaa	continue being natural and friendly with him. But if you want things to go further, try flirting with him or hinting him that you like him. If he returns the signals than, tell him you like him and stuff. But if he doesn't, then back off and become friendly again. This way you can tell if he likes you without the awkwardness and risking your friendship.|`|IcUsSPeUaa	Stay friends with him. Earn eachothers' full trust, get to know each other inside and out and spend time together. When you feel confident and you're sure that even if he rejects you, you'll stay friends that's when you ask him to advance your relationship together. Remember, you don't make the decision, he doesn't make the decision, you both make the decision.|`|jPlUycx0aa	Let him know how you feel.  If you sit back and just wait then that could take forever.  Life is to short Car pay Diem (sees the day). If he likes you back then it all works out. That a chance or forever wish you had.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|vHIu0QL8aa	You just kind of have to establish a friendship. You should just come out and tell him you like him and see if he wants to go out with you.<br>  Good Luck
4EWCegiRaa	I understand you're point and it's a valid one but I think you should cut him some slack.  It's the first time in a while he could spend money and he does take as good of care of you as he can; it's not like he doesn't cook or clean.  <br>  <br>  -Should he have gambled it?  No, he should have saved it.<br>  -Is the reason I listed above a good one?  Not really but it's a decent one.<br>  -Does he deserve one "get out of jail free" card?  I think so.<br>  <br>  If he does it again, just be honest and say exactly how you feel (just like you were when you were telling us) but I think he gets some slack.
AA11085549	It's not rocket science here.  It means he clicked on something on his side to let you know he is interested in you.|`|g2i5uNlOaa	It means he is officially interested in stalking you, capturing you, and molesting you.  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!|`|8yncQq62aa	why dont you try going to match.com and clicking a "help" link. that should give you all the info your looking for.<br>  <br>  EDIT- oh, well ive never been to match.com so i cant help ya... :( sorry
W1aYIF71aa	Emo people are stupid.  Give up now.|`|rTkzJu1gaa	I had a situation like this happen to me before too.<br>  My friend and I both liked this boy.<br>  And we both told each other that we like him<br>  She was more outgoing so he would naturally talk to her more.<br>  I would get jealous because she would talk to him all the time when she knew that I liked him too.<br>  Then one day I realized, he'll choose who he likes.<br>  If he likes my friend more, then good for her, he wasn't meant for me and I can find a boy that's wayyy better.<br>  And if he likes me, then I have to decide whether or not to go out with him. If it will hurt my friend or not.<br>  <br>  In the end, we both got over the boy and we laugh about liking him now.<br>  But my best advice to give to you is that friends will last forever, but a boy at your age most likely wont.<br>  So above all, don't lose a good friend over a boy that wont last forever.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|cvqwMPsFaa	oh im so sorry i have that same problem.<br>  you see i went out with this guy for 3 months and broke up with him a few weeks ago. and his best friend likes me. a lot. and i kindaaa like th bestfriend, but MY best friend went out with him and likes him a little still and was crying when she found out he liked me. it was terrible so im screwing the guy & taking my friend. i would just let her ask him, i think that if she does ask him he'll eventually lose interest because guys nature is to have girl who arent easy to get and playing right into his hands will just be too easy and he wont like her as much at least. keep your friend. as i say, chicks before male reproductive parts! (: just be good friends with the boy and maybe he'll like you & ask you to the dance. tell your friend not to ask him because "he'll lose interest" or something if you dont want it happening. goooddluckk!|`|pClSy09Daa	omg wow!<br>  i kind of had the same situation .<br>  me and one of my best friend liked this gorgeous boy, and he was all pale and tall and yummy like EDWARD CULLEN. <br>  so anyways, she liked him more, and so i told her that i don't like him anymore. <br>  but i couldn't stop my love for him. he was really something special. ..<br>  but now i can say that i'm over 101%. <br>  ..mainly because he has a girlfriend. LOL!<br>  <br>  anywho, you should tell her. it doesn't mean you have to compete for him, but it will be harder for you to hide your feelings for him infront of your friend.<br>  <br>  and the dance problem is hard. if there's still time, divert her eyes onto other boys that she might like more. <br>  <br>  but i guess in the end, it's sisters before misters .... right? <br>  <br>  goodluck sweetie.
QODJNf1oaa	She probably wants to bother you since she knows you have OCD|`|Tp2VuKzeaa	She probably likes you...but wow... you dont know her name?<br>  <br>  Find out dude, start a conversation, tell you her name and ask if you can guess hers.|`|AA10313222	she has a school girl crush<br>  pass her a note maybe she writes better then speaks<br>  and itll really get her all giddy when you do|`|yPOdBF52aa	i think you should maybe make up some sort of question like "do you know how to do this?" (i don't know what class this is so insert your own ?) then try to spark something about the school, reel her into something, ask what her name is a formaly introduce yourself to her.  <br>  do you know any of her friends? maybe they can tell you something about her that will spark a conversation.<br>  <br>  hope that helps <br>  good luck:)|`|RV5Y0b5yaa	Just be can i get your number? and if she says yes. she will have so much to talk to you about|`|HNQU9V6Haa	if you cant hold a convo then its all over man yu need to build up some confidence|`|DUr8KP94aa	Well, either this girl is into you, or likes to drag you along... but she is definetely showing signs of liking you!  If you're having trouble keeping up a conversation, just talk about the class that you're in - homework, the teacher... or get together for a "study session."  Once you have that one conversation, things will just flow... and if you can't start a conversation, the chemistry isn't strong enough for a relationship anyway.  Oh, and P.S. start with getting her name.|`|EXIjMTVcaa	wait for the right moment, and then when you have h.w. or class work and you are allowed to work with a partner. Walk over to her and act like you're adsking a quick question 'bout one of the questions, instead stay there and work through the whole thing. Just try your best not to over-do it with girls, usually this just means she is shy
aDL7xmt6aa	NO MORE BEER!!!|`|AA12392755	So, you got drunk and went out.  Big deal, from what you said nothing happened.  You have to do something to be forgiven for and you didn't.  Getting drunk is always a stupid thing, but not the end of the world.  You are trying to make it sound like you did something terrible here.  If you are really 21 you need to grow up and take responsibility for your actions, that is if you ever have any actions to take responsibility for.  Quit beating yourself over nothing and get on with our life.  And just WHAT is it you thing you are going to tell him?  How about " I went out and got drunk and came home wasted", cause thats what happened.  Doesn't sound like such a big deal without all the inane guilt does it.  Why tell him at all?|`|IxBqMaCKaa	Try not to beat yourself up over it! It's going to be hard to tell him, but he should be more mad at that guy than at you.  It sounds like he has taken advantage of you being drunk.  Let him know that you never meant to do that and you just missed him too much!<br>  <br>  Hopefully he will get past it and you two can have a happy future together.  If he really loves you (it sounds like he does) he will forgive you and learn to understand what happened.<br>  <br>  Cheer up! Best of luck.|`|NDoyhCZYaa	Get over it.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Quit drinking, quit clubbing and tell your boyfriend about it now or if he is not too far away go visit and confess.  Keep your clothes on until you tie the knot and then explode all over your husband.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	It sounds like the guy took advantage of you, but you are partly to blame as well. You feel guilty and came here seeking advice...that is a sign that you truly love your boyfriend. From now on, don't get drunk at parties where you know there are a lot of guys at. Guys tend to take advantage of drunk girls so just be more careful from now on. <br>  <br>  Most guys would only consider sex with another person as cheating, not kissing. That's why guys can get away with kissing another girl when they're in a relationship and not feel bad about it, because they've convinced themself it isn't wrong. <br>  <br>  Instead of keeping it all in, talk to him about it. It will hurt him and he will trust you less but you will feel A LOT better for it. It's better than keeping a major secret from someone you love. Tell him what you told us...that you kissed another guy but nothing else. That you still love him and want him to try and forgive you.|`|sPQBluKEaa	here's my opinion on cheating:<br>  if i were to find out that my boyfriend had kissed a girl, just one time, i think i would be able to find it in my heart to forgive him, because i understand that things happen spur of the moment, and i would want him to forgive me, too.<br>  if he were to be carrying on a relationship behind my back, that's a different story. it's for sure over then.<br>  <br>  what you wrote in your description of this question is very sweet, the way you expressed his feelings for him. he will probably be hurt, there's no doubt about it, but try to tell him all of these things that you put in this question (such as how perfect you think he is, how you don't want anyone except him, and how much this is hurting you). <br>  <br>  while you are explaining it to him, try to remember not to try to put the blame on anyone else, because in all honesty, it is your fault, but hopefully he will understand. it will most likely take a while to mend the trust, but it is really good that you are owning up to it. no matter what happened on your birthday, you seem like a very good person.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|AA11819105	Nothing serious happened so say nothing. If you mention it to your bf you,ll just cause unnecessary problems<br>  Slow down on your drinking|`|AjBpAPpdaa	Sorry, I can't read all that just yet, it's almost midnight|`|ShaUAySvaa	i would have him read it - this|`|YVeZ8K6haa	You need to tell your boyfriend. Talk to him the way you just told the story, and let him know how much your sorry and how awful you feel. Then you need to tell him what you plan on doing to not let this ever happen again. You may need to not drink anymore, clearly things are out of  your control when you drink.<br>  <br>  I think your boyfriend may get angry with you, but I don't think he will dump you over it. Good luck.|`|bNx1q5oWaa	ur not a **** u were drunk that night it could of happend 2 anybody<br>  just tell him he'll forgive u especially since u didnt have 2 tell him and he'd never found out<br>  just tell him it was a mistake|`|EjyD1sXeaa	please listen<br>  we are all human and it's natural to make mistakes as long as you learn from them<br>  <br>  you are moralistic and DO HAVE a conscience and this is why it's eating you up.<br>  some girls wouldn't think twice about it.<br>  <br>  Put it to the back of your mind because you didn't actually cheat, it was a drunken flirt.<br>  Don't tell your b/f it would crush him<br>  <br>  i hate liars but in this case omission of the truth is the best course<br>  <br>  what he doesn't know won't hurt him<br>  <br>  True story:<br>  <br>  A while ago, a man was lying on his death bed, he'd been married to his doting wife for 40 + years and he confessed to her that he'd had affairs, then died.  He only wanted to die with a clear conscience, but his wife was devastated and couldn't get over his betrayal and  all her happy memories went down the drain as she realized she never truly knew her husband all those years.<br>  <br>  so I urge you not to tell your b/f and learn from this and move on happily with him|`|M2VneBW3aa	okay i read it now..<br>  <br>  i think you should jsut explain to him what you just explained to us and if you two are really soulmates ofcourse it will work out<br>  <br>  and everything happens for a reason!|`|xreWOKBYaa	Being drunk is not an excuse for cheating.<br>  You cheated on your boyfriend so you do not love him.<br>  Your boyfriend deserved someone who loves him.<br>  Tell him the truth and break up with him for his own good. <br>  After only dating 5 months it is impossible to be in love.<br>  <br>  This is NOT small, this IS cheating, this is NOT trivial, you SHOULD BE beating yourself up over this because it was WRONG.<br>  <br>  The Facts^^|`|R5eISU0saa	hey, as positive as im going to try to be. you kind of did something wrong, the boy touching you, you couldnt predict that...but the kiss you gave him, you couldve stopped.<br>  <br>  i wouldnt say its cheating.  but its wrong. and hiding isnt the way forward,<br>  just be straight up with your boyfriend, try and work your way through it.|`|NXA4fJbTaa	please please please make it shorter :)|`|pOufymEJaa	oh im sorry|`|W0qFAIVuaa	Print out your question.Tell him you got drunk and stupid.Let him read it.I think he will forgive you.If it was me I would figure you have punished yourself too much already.Its not like you slept with the guy.Promise him you will never get drunk without him and stick to it.Good Luck.I would never breakup with someone I loved over something this trivial.Hope this makes you feel a little better.I think it will be ok.|`|1hpctY4saa	There's no magical formula to it.  Tell him the whole truth from the beginning to the end.  Do not tell him while you are in the car or in a place that he feels trapped.  He may need to get away and think about things for a while.<br>  <br>  Don't make excuses that you were drunk.  Don't make excuses that you were in a club and that the guy was attractive.  Don't make any excuses.  Just tell him the truth.  It will hurt him, but he will respect that more in the end, than if you made a bunch of excuses and told him half of the story.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Most people falter now and then. You're only human. What you did doesn't qualify as cheating. It was harmless flirtation and a harmless grope. Its not as if you slept with him! Seriously, if I were you, I would get over it asap. NO HARM DONE!!! Don't even attempt to tell your boyfriend about it, you were out having fun on your birthday, got a little bit drunk and ended up chatting to a guy you went ot primary school with. So? Theres nothing to tell. Leave it at that Please!|`|2EqtniyQaa	I would actually tell him, in a calm situation when he's happy, when he gets back, and when you've spent a little time together.<br>  Tell him that it's not your total fault, and if he starts getting mad say, 'don't you want truth in our relationship?  I told you the truth'<br>  Just tell him the truth, because lying never gets me anywhere, it always comes back and hits me right in the face, so tell the truth, and if he REALLY ACTUALLY loves you, then he'll understand.<br>  IF he doesn't REALLY ACTUALLY love you, then he'll just get all pissed, and think all selfish to himself.  He should understand if he's a real boyfriend.|`|bT713RWqaa	haha, well i have actually read through that entire post.<br>  <br>  and all i can say is... people make mistakes. we all know the affect that alcohol has on us. some handle their liquor better than others.<br>  <br>  you were out celebrating your 21st birthday...having fun with your friends and perhaps missing your boyfriend terribly. even though you may have kissed another guy... it doesn't mean you are cheating or have those intentions.<br>  <br>  it depends on what kind of person your boyfriend is.... maybe he'll lose trust... or become paranoid and probably not want you to drink/get drunk without him there. maybe he will be understanding and look at it like.. well yes it was your birthday and it was just harmless fun. you said (if you did kiss him) it happened for just a second, but you pulled away and came to your senses. and the fact that he groped you and you walked away still acknowledging your boyfriend..that should show for something.<br>  <br>  honesty is always appreciated. but like i said.. it really just depends on what type of man your boyfriend is.|`|91bshee0aa	ok i have been in situation kinda like this.. well my gf cheated on me like a week after we hooked up and she told me like 3 or 4 month later... it hurt like hell but i loved her and she promised me that nothing like that will ever happen again.... but it still hurts  when i think about it...<br>  so you should tell him right away. it should be the first thing you do and if he does forgive you u have to understand that it will take a while for him to trust u. and ull have to make it up to him and try to be the best gf u can be|`|A6MQuHfbaa	I would say it's the other guy's fault, not yours. You were drunk, and sometimes it's hard to have good judgment when you're drunk (isn't that what alcohol does? lol) He came onto you... You should confess it to your boyfriend, but make sure he understands that you're sorry and you won't let it happen again. <br>  <br>  Even if he does get a little mad or upset, he's gonna realize that you're sorry, and it was just a mistake. If he's as great a guy as you say, he won't leave you or stay mad at you for something as small as this. Good luck :)|`|AA10084361	The ONLY reason to tell him is to make yourself feel better...<br>  <br>  If you really love him, don't even tell him about it.<br>  <br>  If you feel like telling somone, tell your minister or priest. <br>  <br>  Or just pray that God forgives you...<br>  <br>  Then Trust that God has already forgiven you..<br>  <br>  If you wish to tell someone, write your story down in your own handwriting and lock it in a lock box. Tell all your feelings and the reason why you did not tell him. Perhaps even include a copy of this in the envelope. <br>  Forget it completely and don't tell ANYONE else about it ever again. Don't feel guilty for something you have been forgiven for.<br>  <br>  If the subject EVER comes up again (and I don't see how it ever would), you can bring out the box and the envelope and share it with him. If it is 5 years later and you guys are still together, you may get a big laugh about it.<br>  <br>  BUT, NEVER bring up the subject with him. You NEVER want him to picture in his mind you kissing someone else past or present. It will mess with his head.<br>  <br>  He will always imagine that more happened. <br>  <br>  AND, since you have proven that you can not be trusted when drinking, DON'T Drink or get drunk...  That fixes the problem..<br>  <br>  You are lucky that MORE didnt happen. He could have waited until you had one more drink and were more out of it. OR he could have slipped something into your drink and then you wake up not remembering anything.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.    It is good that your concience made you feel bad, but just resolve to Never do it again.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	I think it's up to your boyfriend whether he chooses to forgive you or not. The thing is, if the shoe was on the other foot what would you do? I think this will definitely hurt the trust in your relationship. I also feel like all the guilt in the world doesn't change what occurred. I just hope that when you tell your boyfriend that you don't tell it how you typed it. It sounds to me like you are blaming it on the day, your birthday sorrow, the alcohol, this other guy ...and failing to take personal responsibility. You gotta admit your wrong and not make excuses, then he will know you are sincere.<br>  As for advice for the future, dont go out alone and drink to that point. Always be under control. Cause no guy wants a girl who goes out and drink to where she don't know what she is doing and anything can happen to her. Were you alone? Having a boyfriend some friend should have stepped in too and not allowed kissing and you to go outside by yourself with some dude.|`|AaaWxMX4aa	Everybody screws up now and then, why do you think he has to know? You didn't really do anything. I'd just stay cool and forget it and be what your boyfriend needs.|`|AfodwqT1aa	be yourself while he's away, you know you made a mistake and you know not to do it again, this does count as cheating but loads of people have been drunk and done this before!<br>  <br>  when he gets home show him this question and what u wrote, it will show him how bad you really feel about this.<br>  <br>  also it will show how strong your relationship really is. if he stays with you then you have a second chance, and dont mess it up!<br>  <br>  i hope it all goes well for you.<br>  dont worry about it untill he gets back...when you've told him, if he really loves you he will understand how bad you feel about doing it.|`|Hk3VmZszaa	YOU GO OUT DRINKING BY YOURSELF ON YOUR 21ST BDAY??? AND YOU CAN TELL THIS IS YOUR SOULMATE AFTER BEING WITH HIM FOR 5 MONTHS???? just tell him the truth, he'll find out if you don't.... i found out my boyfriend kissed another girl.... i forgave him after a long time of not trusting him|`|OQ3ydVrmaa	I can understand how you'd be feeling upset right now, it is a stressful situation.<br>  <br>  A lot of people have been in the situation at some stage where they've been feeling down and out and drunk and someone has shown them the attention they're craving. So sometimes even though you never meant for it to happen things can get out of hand. You did stop it though, so feel better for that much at least.<br>  <br>  If it was me, I'd be planning the same as you are now, to tell him about it. If your relationship is as strong as you say it is then i think he'll appreciate the honesty. There is the chance that it will create a small trust issue for a while, but if you were to keep it a secret and then it came out further down the line then trust would be gone completely.|`|Yi4ja5Lkaa	Youve got your head screwed on, and you pulled away. tell him nothing, he really doesn't need to know - but, if you feel the need to tell him, make sure he knows the full situation. you will be fine :)|`|PxLhryHyaa	you just need to tell him straight out. i kissed another guy once while i was with my bf and things were horrible after. i cried everyday [same as you] and then it came time to tell him...it was the worst but of course it had to be done. just tell him straight out. it will suck but its really the best thing you can do. of course he will probably be mad and he might say mean things but if he really cares for you and its really meant to be, he will try to work it out.<br>  <br>  it took time but my bf forgave me... we are actually still working on the whole trust issues now [this happened about a month ago]. <br>  <br>  just tell him and give it time.<br>  <br>  and you're asking if its even cheating.... if you are this worked up about it and are questioning yourself... that should be your answer. if it truly was nothing to begin with, then you wouldn't be feeling this bad.<br>  <br>  i hope everything works out :) just be honest!|`|CceiP7q5aa	do you have depression?|`|QinRb3EBaa	Oh, poor you. I have been in a similar situation, and the outcome all depends on how your boyfriend takes it. Chances are he will forgive you on account of your being plastered, we all do stupid, meaningless things when we are drunk. It may take him a while to fully trust you again but tell him the same thing that you have written down here, i can't promise that it'll work and he will probably be mad, but if you truly love each other it >should< work out. <br>  Good luck (:~|`|ROPDA6Qaaa	First of all this sounds more like a guy that was really trying to take advantage of you!!  You were drunk and he obviously took advantage of that!!! i would no consider what you did cheating, but you do need to tell your boyfriend when he gets home. If anything you both should be pissed off at this guy taking advantage of a drunk girl!  If your boyfriend and you love each other like you say you do, everything should work out fine. Thats not saying that hes not gonna be pissed, but things happen. In the long run he should be happy that you felt so much grief over what happen instead of trying to hide it from him.|`|UObngjk3aa	honestly i dont think its that bad to cry every night about<br>  just tell your boyfriend everything you just typed and he will most likely be extremely angry with you at first but you will get through it<br>  its not that bad you had the strength to pull away both times and its obvious you really love him so dont feel so bad! things will be okay|`|qpAl6EGTaa	i am so sorry good luck|`|UkTuev4yaa	Just be honest and tell your boyfriend what happened. I'm sure he will understand.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't, and breaks up with you, then you should understand. <br>  <br>  You betrayed the trust of your boyfriend, and whether or not it can be considered cheating is a moot point.|`|z2Cxquf8aa	ho|`|NJeQNXcIaa	wow..... i don't think anyone will actually read all that|`|X7yawmuPaa	I think you did the right thing, and no I don't think you cheated on him, you flirted with him, but that's it and I think he will be more proud of the fact that you said no and refused the guys advance even though you were drunk, which can be very hard to do. Just make sure you do tell him or the secret could destroy the relationship from the inside and out, you made a mistake life is full of them, and if he can't understand that and try to get over it then you two need to end it because it will cause problems in the future.|`|YUWVHdo9aa	Wow...I would make a romantic welcome back party and tell him when he is in good mood.  Tell him how sorry you are and don't say it is ALL the drink's fault. Tell him it is but not just. AND TELL HIM THAT YOU TELL HIM THIS BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM!<br>  And if he loves you he first might be very upset but will come over it. <br>  And if not you sound like a wonderful person! Maybe he is not your "Mr. Right" and he still will come and see your honestly. :)|`|1fSXxKr1aa	I am sorry for what happend. I don't think this is really cheating because you pulled away. If this happend to me i would be depressed. Are you depressed? Well don't be please. I know you love him and you never ment to do that. When your bf is back tell him that you are very sorry and that you really love him. If He loves you he will accecpt your apoligizes. Tell him you were upset without him and you went clubing and that you were  drunk and you did something you wouldn't ever do agian. Tell him you love him so much and that it was all a mistake.  Do something special for him. Show him how much you care. You love him to never let him go. If he really truely loves you he will forgive you. No human is perfect. good luck|`|Z771jOf8aa	Please Please do not tell this to your BF right away. It is wrong to lie but not in this situation. I am so afraid that after telling this to your BF, he will leave you.  Try to buy some time and choose a appropriate time to tell him.  You have to used some understatements in your story as well.  I am not encourage you to lie, but I do want to "twist" the truth in this situation.  And no, this situation is not entirely your fault.|`|2378db63a64d3b0b43810373b0a58b65aa	no honestly i dnt think this is considered cheating. you pulled away both times and honestly dnt b so hard on urself it was ur bday nd u jst dran to much but u still managed 2 say no i hope itll b ok between u nd ur bf|`|7bvmQyc7aa	i think you are waaayyy over analyzing the situation, i think u need to take a breather and you should have a conversation with him. tell him what happened and hope that he feels the same about you and you both can move forward, if he loves you as much as you love him, then this wont be an issue. The whole trust thing will be on the rocks so yeah you will have to earn that back.|`|f7BtFd2caa	well you can tell your boyfriend and get it over with and cry your self out. go out and play a sport. relieve your stress. and do somehting useful. :] good luck and feel better|`|iIkSXiqPaa	If I were you.  I would take this, print it, and hand it to your boyfriend.  If he loves you back, he will realize you made a mistake and forgive you.  If he doesn't, your just not meant to be...  I feel sorry for you but, this is what you should do... he will see it and realize you just made a mistake...<br>  <br>  If he gets mad, write him a letter... tell him how much you love him...|`|n84CnN9eaa	didnt really cheat, but then again u did wait a while to pull away, but i think ur bf shouldnt really get mad about it unless hes the really jelous type, and ive had it up to here with u girls calling urselves sluts even tho u didnt really do anything that wrong, hmm, did u sleep with like 20 guys in the past month? if not then YOUR NOT A ****!|`|AA11182331	It doesnt sound to me like you did anything at all. Some scumbag took advantage of you while you were drunk. If everything you said here is true then I am sure he will not be angry at you. If he DOES get angry it will be at the other guy for trying to force himself upon you. I;m sure everything will be fine.|`|rQUFZgL8aa	Be honest with yourself first and foremost.  A lot of what happens while we are drunk can be suppressed emotions trying to get out.  I don't doubt that he is wonderful, but is he really the kind of wonderful that you need?  Is it just guilt?  Were you so drunk that you are just remembering bits an pieces from that night?  <br>   <br>  If you tell him what happened, there is a distinct possibility that you can't even answer the questions he may ask you, because you may not know what happened.  I can't tell you if you should come clean or not, if you do, he may or may never forgive you.  The only thing you can do for sure is try to recognize the behavior and feelings you exhibited on that night, and have a support system in place so you do not make the same mistake again.   Good luck with what ever you decide to do.|`|rrK40nIhaa	=/ u shouldnt have drunk anyway.. but from ur story it looks like you really feel bad. you need to tell your boyfriend if you truly love him as soon as possible, probably better in person. he'll obviously be upset.. but if he loves you he'll look over your mistake and move on living his life with you :) he might use what you did against you in the future however if yall get in a fight n all u know? but if he is ur dream guy then he's prolly really sweet n will love you no matter whatt so dontt worry at all :) i hope ya'll stay together forever <3 good luck girl!|`|GZ9iMWr8aa	dont try to hide it from your bf for much longer.  i agree it would be much better to tell him in person.  sit him down and explain the whole thing from the start just like you did here and beg for forgiveness.  he will probably be angry, but you seem sincerely sorry so hopefully he will forgive you.<br>  <br>  and some advice for the future - - dont go out and get that drunk ever again|`|tXrtRFoNaa	get over it and smoke some strong marijuana mixed with Lebanese hash, if that doesn't solve your problem then there is no help for you|`|xWjDKM7gaa	first of all, you probably should of kicked this guy in the nuts cause you clearly stated you were in a serious relationship.<br>  and yes, this is pretty much cheating. if you pulled away as fast as you said you did, regardless a kiss was still made. <br>  <br>  Being drunk is not an excuse, unless you're drunk to the point where you pretty much black out. <br>  However, I think you need to talk to your boyfriend before he comes home. If my boyfriend did that to me while I was away and didn't bother telling me until I came home I would be pretty mad.<br>  <br>  Don't let this situation get the best of you. What you described doesn't seem like THAT big of a deal that you're making it out to be. It's not like you went and had sex with this random dude. You'll feel twenty million times better once you get it off your chest. If he's upset, he'll get over it, especially if you love him like you say you do, and he loves you as well. All relationships have tests like that.  remember, 5 months doesn't mean you're married!<br>  <br>  next time you go to a club or bar, take it easy on the booze too!|`|Nix92QkYaa	i think u have put urself through enough, just tell him u got drunk and carried away. to be honest i would say as little as possible and let him ask the questions because chances are hes not going to want to know the full details because hes going to be hurt. and if he does want to know the full details, then tell him and talk to him about it. communication is key weather there is a problem, things are great or u just want to spill whatever it is inside u about whatever is going on in your life. I'd personally call it cheating but if he cares enough to work through it then great, if not do u want to be with someone who isnt understanding. trust will take time to build up again but if i were u i would lay low in bar atmospheres unless ur going out with him so he isnt suspecious and i wouldnt tell him the name of the guy either.. u know how young guys get there always trying to get angry and fight when it comes to women and looking silly. good luck. it happens to everyone. u know u were wrong and therefore things will clear themselves up. if u dont tell it will continue to eat away at you and ur relationship might be jeopardized... ive been there and the relationship was never the same again, and that hurt me worst.
EsnFmcMFaa	you are pretty<br>  <br>  its has nothing to do with your looks<br>  you just have to try and open yourself up or make yourself available<br>  when i say open up i dont mean be a slut<br>  <br>  im sure there are guys that like you<br>  they just might be intimidated by you so they are not brave enough to talk to you<br>  <br>  im in your situation<br>  i feel that no girls like me but i know i havent found the right girl for me yet<br>  oh yeah im 18 and ive never had a gf|`|YSAfYkPwaa	Too young to be worrying about boyfriends.  Just be casual and go with the flow.|`|BZVlzAywaa	Oh don't worry. I didn't get my first boyfriend until i was a junior. Don't feel any pressure. And besides, you wouldn't really want a boyfriend. Like, honestly. It's nice in the beginning, because its all very new and sweet, and you walk with him and everyone looks and smiles. But then after a while you get tired of him, and you start stressing about whether you should break up with him or not. Or you're worrying about whether he's gonna break up with you. It's actually extremely annoying. It's so much easier to be single. You can hang with whatever guys you want and you don't have to worry about a "serious relationship". Trust me, you aren't missing out on anything.|`|OQ3ydVrmaa	There's nothing wrong with you, some people just take longer to find a boyfriend!

oB2NvlZUaa	its not looking good im sorry bro. you should have pursued it when you had the chance.

dX4Dll0yaa	You get used to it. You "accept" that is the way it is supposed to be. You think it is your fault. You think they will change. You think they don't mean it. You think so many things and none of them are right. I would know. I dated a guy for 2 years who was abusive every way you can be. The only reason I ever left him was because I saw how angry everyone else was when I told them he ask if he could date another girl too, and I realized that is how angry I was supposed to be. The next few months were really hard because you get used to having someone around even if they treat you like trash. You think you are the reason they hit you. That they are good people, but you should stop making them angry. It is the worst feeling in the world. If you are asking this because you know someone who is struggling with this, I encourage you to talk to them about it. I would have given anything for someone to tell me that I should move on, that it wasn't my fault etc. Even if they don't listen I know they will appreciate it.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	there's an emotional and sometimes financial dependency on your abusive partner as well. they may have nobody to turn to, or have been verbally abused to the point of feeling that nobody else could ever be with them because they are "nothing." it's difficult to say though, because it's different in every case.|`|AA10495394	Because they feel like that's the only person they can get or deserve.

QODJNf1oaa	Well just hint at things that you like to do and see if he takes the cue in asking you to do them some time. Or say something like, "damn, i really want to see the movie ( whatever it is) but my best friend just bailed on me," that is a perfect opportunity to find out whether he's interested in you or not without putting yourself all out there.|`|9ceIg9xnaa	hint it! if you hardly ever see him; what can it hurt?:)|`|A9DM0xE7aa	sometimes its best just to be upfront and honest.  otherwise if you pussy foot around for too long, he may think u just wanna be friends. arrange to meet somewhere fairly private and do something fun together, and once u see he is enjoying it, express how u feel.|`|Qxexz4mEaa	Since he's not around you, in your everyday settings like school or town.

If he still flirts, tell him flat out to stop hitting on you.|`|SweWC8p1aa	If you honestly care about your boyfriend, get proof that he is hitting on you & tell your boyfriend. if not that, tell your boyfriend and next time your around them both, make sure your boyfriend see's it. make sure somehow, someway you let your boyfriend know.. its all trust!

I couldn't do this because I'd want to have a boyfriend I'd enjoy kissing/having sex with since they add a new level of initimacy and differentiate it from the relationship you have with friends/siblings/coworkers.  <br>  <br>  However, I do believe that attraction can grow even if you don't get it at first.  If you grow to have a lot of affection for somebody they can seem far more attractive with the same body if that makes sense to you.  In this case I'd totally go for it.  It's about enjoying a physical relationship with them, not waiting for them to get "that perfect body".
8McA6xqPaa	Sounds like it! Go for it! :)|`|61Wrl89Maa	Sounds like he does, make a move.|`|cIlQJ9hxaa	I think he likes you. If you like him go woith it and ask him out or kiss him let him know you like him.|`|Qxexz4mEaa	Of course he likes you. Otherwise he wouldn't go out of his way to spend time with you. I don't know if you mean as friends or potential boyfriend stuff.|`|FQNfXgvFaa	well i mean if he took some time out of his scheduale to teach you how to snowboard or he skiped class in college to hang out with you..then i think he does like you|`|HNQU9V6Haa	yea definatly does like you just keep chilling with him and ishh and see where its goes|`|yM37Dhnlaa	ya he likes you
ZawzpmaGaa	I think she should invite him to the hockey game because he'll be in a more comfortable enviroment and they can both relaxe plus look like a couple in public :) lol. Then after the game she should act like she's hungry so they can go out to eat....this is your friend not you right?
oFKHFc7Naa	That's how most guys are with their friends. They think of a girl as fine, hot, sexy but then when it comes to telling the girl, they say what girls really want to hear. They tell them that their pretty, cute, and beautiful.|`|rRvoOPvzaa	Because they're being respectful to your face and with the guys, well, they're just guys. Men always hear that women would rathe be pretty or cute than just hot. Maybe they actually listened for once.|`|3eNxDmp1aa	Some poeple find "hot" degrading they are probably trying to not offend you|`|JC3kBl9saa	being hot..<br>  they may think their gonna affend you..<br>  i sure wuddnt wanna be called hot.<br>  besides..<br>  whats wrong with being pretty or cute?|`|wMc7LiT1aa	they're smart . they think you'd probably think its disrespectful . so be happy (:|`|a1iam8Zvaa	idk<br>  it happends to me to<br>  i think guys think that girls would be freaked out if a guy said that a girl is hot so they say cute or pretty<br>  i caught a guy calling me hot once tho and he said sorry<br>  lol its not that big of a deal<br>  but i like it better when they say pretty or cute ^_^|`|AA11841749	I'm not sure what the issue is here.  All of them are compliments.
AA10910187	I would have to agree I don't know... being selfish I would say money... but being real I would say love lol|`|42r3IR34aa	Love, absolutely.  I personally wouldn't be happy if I had loads of material possessions but was in a completely unfulfilling relationship.  I'd get bored very, very quickly.  And I think that people that say money would quickly discover how wrong they were...<br>  <br>  I do expect a *bit* of money though. XD  But it's not essential.|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Well if you really want to know, there is no such thing as the "perfect soul mate" and anyone can become a Millionaire if you are up for the challenge, so in reality if you ask me I would say Love.  yea no doubt.|`|nVdYIHhzaa	money becvause if you have money you can go enough places to find love|`|8yncQq62aa	love for sure...<br>  <br>  you only live one time and if you spend your life without someone to love, your really not living at all.|`|xvT1rqasaa	Money, i cant stand love.|`|gR76S7mEaa	YAYBER!!! (MONEY)<br>  Money Can Buy yu LOVE!!<br>  ND LOVE CANT GET YU MONEY!!|`|y7MsBXdmaa	It depends. Love screwed me over, <br>  so i say <br>  show me the money honey :)|`|b6ZMOPdQaa	both... love is very important... but money also...|`|SIW9gnazaa	love. honestly.<br>  its way better than money.<br>  money can go away but love is always** there!! (:<br>  **well usually always there. ha|`|u3gyFKzzaa	well I want both of them....but love is the must....in the other hand, love without money won't last! so figure out yourself....<br>  you need a little bit of both, otherwise, it's not going to work :p|`|cQlyI9ELaa	I'd rather make money|`|bl8vA1mpaa	love then money ;0)|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	love.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	love is better.. but money is pretty important too.<br>  ideally, the person you love has a lot of money. haha.|`|X1YVUA5oaa	Love. Ya we know you need some degree of money to survive, quit trying to dodge the question ladies, lol, you know what she means.|`|Cpm25Pekaa	Love, I would never marry a ugly chick for money.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Money-- then you can buy love.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Easy,love.
eO4y3m1maa	i saw leave him alone for awhile. My ex did the same thign to me, now he shrugs me off like we never dated..Im not sure why.<br>  <br>  but the girl he cheated on me with hes now dating and has a kid with...sure that has something to do with it..<br>  <br>  But just walk away...|`|ywzImibPaa	I'm in the EXACT same situation except he told me he hates me because we got in a fight. it was really stupid too. im looking for the same advice, he really meant a lot to me. my life just seems so empty without him in it at all so i really do want to be friends but he's so stubborn and wont even look at me.
MOYZCFKyaa	"IF IT DIDN'T WORK ONCE IT DIDN'T WORK FOR A VERY GOOD REASON"<br>  <br>  that is my golden rule of relationships<br>  <br>  If you get yourself caught up with her again, it'll just fall apart like last time. please don't make that mistake, I don't know you, but please save yourself the trouble and hurt and back the hell away from her because ex girlfriends are trouble and they always will be. They might want you back, mine does, but I'm backing the hell out because it's not worth getting hurt like I did before one more time. <br>  <br>  Please don't make it a priortity to get back with her, it's just gonna fall apart.|`|EvDmgWjvaa	I think its games and sometimes they want to hold onto the idea of a person loving them even if they know they don't feel the same way for the person.|`|Bcxejd3Qaa	from what u just said, it seems like she needs time to figure out whatever is in her head! If she wanted to let u down easy, would she tell u that she loves u? NO! Just be there for her as a friend. she will appreciate u more.|`|Jd28QrWPaa	Give her some time to fugue thing's out for what she wont's in her life right now.
3H1tq6qLaa	Well the don't. Just because someone likes you means you have to act on it. Girls like that don't stay around long. You are having doubts on acting on this and keep it that way. If you are (and I'm definitely not saying you aren't ) as decent guy as you say, then you should not get yourself dragged down to the level of those kind of people. You will probably get like a "bad name" at school and you WILL lose your decency. Trust me.|`|KM50wTbHaa	i wouldn't go out with her or anything if you know that that is all she is looking for. Plus, if you are a virgin, you do no seem ready for that sort of relationship.
sD7d3Wgpaa	well tell her how you feel. tell her that you want to get interested in her not just sex and that you would like to wait until you know tat you two are going to be together for a while.<br>  But as for the making out that shouldn't be much of a problem making out isn't bad it can be very fun, but also make sure you feel comfortable doing that too<br>  do what makes you happy and if she cant accept that then she doesn't like you as much as you thought she does<br>  <br>  hope this helps you out!|`|7hWVJTlYaa	Yeah she's just showing her affection. If you really don't feel comfortable with it, just tell her that you feel that way. She might feel a little hurt, but she'll just have to understand. If she doesn't end up understanding, then she is just caring about herself, and maybe that's when you should end it. But not for now. =)|`|vkeuaEHiaa	um, how old are you?<br>  <br>  If you're only 3 weeks into the relationship, you are moving far too fast. Tell your gf no way. If she doesn't respect that ditch her, no matter how good it feels when you guys make out like that. You have to give it lots of time|`|XRMNQPUIaa	Lol thats a good thing. She is showing her affection towards you. If you tell her to back off then she will become offended and will just think you're not ready. Go along with it, it will  be fine =]|`|qIAcMeLgaa	Well, by giving in to her every day, I'm sorry, but you're not doing a very good job if showing her that you want a less physical relationship. Tell her that you value her for who she is, and the physical stuff is okay, but you want to get to know her on a more personal level first and that she doesn't have to to all that physical stuff to win you over. This will show her that you're a genuine guy and you don't just want the physical stuff from her, that you're also attracted to her personality and who she is.|`|poG2QQPEaa	you need to talk to her and let her know that, that isnt what you want your relationship based on, and that you would like to take it slower.|`|KfW5lAvFaa	just keep giving her love, when your making out keep you mind on your head not anywhere down there. ha it will saty the same and you guys will get more lovey, just keep your head on.|`|IORRkWnoaa	The best thing you can possibly do is be honest, and if she really loves you, she'll respect that.  If she doesn't respect that, then why would you fall in love with someone who can't respect your body and/or opinions?<br>  <br>  Trust me on this one!! My last relationship was over three years and my current one is coming up on three years.  And honesty and speaking up are the best ways to keep you out of physical and mental trouble.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Make the right choice.|`|i3DPp2vdaa	well tell her how u feel if she knows then it will be better if she loves u to she will understand|`|AA12185428	Try talking to her at a public setting where there won't be any physical temptations. Let her know that you'd like to continue getting to know her better and not jeopardize the relationship by moving too fast for either of you. Let her know you respect her and hope that she respects you. You can practice the conversation and anticipate remarks she may make and have your answers ready. Be kind, caring and firm.
9NCSYFXTaa	Really i think you should do it RIGHT AWAY!<br>  I mean hell the guy that im dating ive been with for a long time. <br>  We only offically hung out 2 times before he asked me out.<br>  Its the best relationship ive ever been it.<br>  GO FOR IT! and good luck to you =]|`|IcUsSPeUaa	After you know everything there is to know about eachother, trust eachother completely, have confidence around her, and you're sure that even if she rejects you'll still be friends and talk once in a while then you should ask her out. Don't come on too strong, doing so will ruin your chances with her and scare her off.|`|9ceIg9xnaa	yeah.. Hmm I would just go for it! I dont think its to soon.. its just a date.. Not marriage! :) <br>  <br>  good luck bub|`|Qxexz4mEaa	If you know you really interested in her, just ask her to hang out. Get to know each other that way. Perhaps when you're together you can ask her out. Follow your heart. =)|`|aez3cIkvaa	From personal experience ask her out as soon as possible or someone will almost always beat you to it.  Use that fear as a motivating factor.|`|HOVvKqxsaa	keep on talking to her and you'll know when<br>  after one conversation isnt good enough|`|qnqkTpspaa	You know maybe you arnt interested... talk to her more and find out, she could actully be a criminal in disgise (but probroly not) I would wait 2 weeks. Then you can. But its totally your choice.<br>  <br>  <br>  -Alexis-
zi3S5ekgaa	grow some balls and ask her ...you ain't in middle school anymore...
rxd1qv1Vaa	ask him whats going on. the worst thing that can happen is that he will continue what he is doing now|`|a2OeOFeMaa	he is obviously embarrassed and you probably did move too fast.<br>  <br>  Play it cool and slow and see what develops|`|VMUwtGCuaa	i'm sick of ROOSTERS like my bro who seems to want women to wait on them.|`|s4FEJiNHaa	there r two possible explanations:<br>  1-alcohol was involved and now that he's sober, well, u know...<br>  2-he's following that lame BS advice that we've all gotten at some point that if u call the next day, or act too interested, then a girl won't like u anymore.|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Sounds like he just used you for what he wanted and dumped you off to the side. Don't pine after him, forget about him. You can do so much better than a player like that.|`|vMkydw1Faa	babygirl he got what he wanted and dip, dont worry he will be back if it was good, but dont think you will get into a relationship with him cuz you wont.|`|AQ3sgTZFaa	u might of gone too fast, or he might have a girlfriend or he is gay|`|HodXzO3Caa	just ask him out rite....i would. he sounds really immature anyways am sure u can do way better hunni xox|`|l0P1OsdYaa	I would say to ask him!!!!!!
AxSX61eoaa	Well I highly doubt that you were in love in the first place so I don't think it will be that hard to say hey this isnt working out. If you wanted you could say that you need space to deal with the loss of your friend so your breaking up with him but it doesnt seem like it.
ynfmYvEhaa	how long have you been together?<br>  you can't manipulate this type of situation.<br>  You need to talk about it with her.<br>  If she's ready then she'll tell you.<br>  Assuming she's not frigid,.|`|AA11841749	Horrible|`|w923GXtSaa	Take it slowly, but don't make her feel pressured to do anything. One thing you can try is have like a romantic dinner at your house, just you two alone with candles & soft music. Towards the end, just cuddle with her, get closer to her for a moment. Then randomly ask her if she wants to 'do it' with you.<br>  Good luck :D
NS57cIo1aa	hmm thats kinda easy... i love a girl thats outgoing, but is very shy at he same time<br>  when they get confused about simple things...[not dumb] just confused i think thats adorable<br>   concentrate on your smile that is important... and be a nice girl who doesnt try to look good and be popular... just be yourself|`|DXZK6eMNaa	takes her top off.<br>  <br>  Guys under 15 really only think about 1 thing, 24x7.|`|yTYjMlbUaa	dress good a funny person nice helpful some one to hang out with does stuff|`|0le6RYndaa	You are obviously too young to be worrying about this stuff.<br>  <br>  Get off the internet and go do your homework.<br>  <br>  Do your parents know you ask these kinds of questions online? I doubt it.
4YK4tBW5aa	Yep, he wants ya|`|6oMF0EIpaa	He’s a pervert…|`|Llo3XzGFaa	we do that normally without thinking, if we see a girl we think is pretty we'll often stare without knowing it otherwise it's actually a technique we use to let girls know we're interested<br>  <br>  so I'd say with 90% certainty if you notice a guy staring at you repeatedly, he's interested|`|TAXmD9lyaa	well if you don't know him that could be one reason|`|tcF9cVT8aa	we stare at someone cause they look good and its better than staring into space lol
s8d7gg5Haa	ooo it sucks alot|`|4hs71Paiaa	friend god have made every couple <br>  if he is the partner god have made for u then he will make you both love <br>  but dont love any one today love means only time pass and have a sex on bed so do not love anyone<br>  aim person who have suffer from this|`|5JiNIcGSaa	like you dumped him,then bear the consiquencies.tell him what you feel,and wait for him to respond......
7cjn2u9uaa	sounds like to me he likes you but is maybe concerned about the age difference because he is such good friends with your family. He doesn't want to appear like a creep by hitting on a younger girl. All he is waiting for is an okay from you and he will probably make the next move. that is not that big of an age difference but it needs to be communicated back to him that it is okay to ask you out. have your brother in law tell him that he thinks that you would go out with him and that you and your family (sister and bro in law) are okay with it. He would probably leave you alone if he thought it would cause a problem with your family because he is such good friends with them, but as long as he knows that everyone is cool with it then that gives him the okay to ask you out. Good luck|`|tK7XacH7aa	First of all, get it through you're head that he likes you, because from what he's said he likes you. When you go see him, go flirt with him. No matter what he thinks, flirt with him. When you go to his birthday, (assuming you are bringing him a gift) give it to him in person and say "I have another present for you. (Wait for him to respond or just go into it (look into his eyes when you say this)) I wanted to tell you that I really like you." From here on compliment him on whatever you like about him. You guys can just keep long distance contact after this.<br>  <br>  This doesn't sound like an age difference issue at all. He likes you and he continued to show it until you backed off. Now that he knows that you don't like him he is just making more excuses to convince himself to get over you. He isn't appearing to be a creeper at all. Apparently it's already okayed by your brother in law because they have been talking about this. You have to make the move, don't send any one else. The guy below me "going postal" is wrong!|`|IYEiZH8naa	I know the age gap seems big now, but as you get older it becomes less of an issue.  As a matter of fact, I was 18 when I met my husband who was 23 at the time, and we did great as a couple and are now married.  I think if I were you, the next time I saw him I'd tell him that I wanted to have a talk with him and let him know that I was interested in more than friendship and ask him if he felt the same (since you already know now that he does).  But make sure and do it soberly so he won't think its the drinks talking! Or, if you'd feel better doing it on IM instead of face to face, do it then, but it would really seem more appropiate to talk in person if didn't mind doing it that way, it would seem more sincere. But do it as soon as you feel comfortable so that he doesn't give up, thinking your not interested, and look further.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Ok - there are many different things going on here.<br>  <br>  You are 18 and getting drunk?  Ok, nevermind.  I'm not judging.  <br>  <br>  This guy sees you like a little sister.  He very much likes you and your company and would consider you as a potential ____.  Can't find the word.    You are part of the family.  He doesn't want to ruin anything.  You are young and he doesn't want to hurt you.<br>  <br>  What if you started dating and it didn't work out?  You get heartbroken and he looks like the Big Bad Wolf that took advantage of you and then tossed you aside.   ??
UAuSVBelaa	Give yourself another few wks and then ul be clearer. Make a point to speak to him now that ye have exchanged names dont leave it too long and strike up a friendship
oU1yUxwwaa	I am glad that you know that it is very possible for it to be lust. As far as love goes it seems like you are showing all the signs but i wouldn't be so sure just yer. If he loves you he shouldn't be afraid to say it.<br>  <br>  Considering the fact that love is just something that can't be controlled. If someone loves you. I mean truly loves you then they wont have a problem telling you that they love you. They will be able to shout it. Even if that's not what the pair of you are talking about they will just break through and say "I love you". because love is an unshakable feeling and will always be expressed when it needs to be expressed. <br>  <br>  Now that's not to say that you two aren't in love but that is just an example. Love can build you up so high and send you crashing right back down to the ground in the blink of an eye. It can make you happy and this should always be the way you feel. True love doesn't hurt anything or anybody until it's gone and a very wise person once told me "Love never was but always will be" meaning that if you love someone...and i mean really love someone there is nothing that this person can do to make you ever stop completely loving them.<br>  <br>  Im sorry if it is so long to read and the best of luck to you. I would also recommend a song for you to listen to. If it isn't love by jennifer hudson. I don't know if youo have heard it but if you haven't then maybe you should listen to it. It might aid you in your question better than my written answer.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|D5N0bAAnaa	I would say love :] isnt it amazing? You can tell a lot from just a kiss. trust me. I kissed a guy i thought i liked, and i felt like, guilty. then kissed my bf that I love and i couldnt stop smiling. :]|`|rpHrCJIhaa	Sounds like puppy love to me.  And weather it works out forever or not enjoy your time together and have no regrets...your first love will stick with you in your heart no matter what|`|AA11676092	that's love. really.
KTqdwG3Xaa	Probably a year.
BQU17a3aaa	umm....just depends....there are tons...the probablem is not all of us act it publically(not a good thing) all the time so you might be confused. I depends how old you are. 18 or youger is usually at church and with a youth group . 19-25ish maybe at an older bible class. older than that probably just hanging with the adults....thats on sudays tho<br>  <br>  Elsewhere we just hang everywhere. If we take our faith seriously we dont get drunk every weekend or anything like that we just hang out and go do stuff like everyone else does. <br>  <br>  Just join a group of christians and hang out with them outside thier group time.|`|xuzFEc0jaa	Usually you can find them in a church on a sunday!|`|PVsKQAVEaa	iam a christian and iam here. lol|`|N4qJ6et4aa	wat do u mean where do they hang out|`|qRM0r7eVaa	No thank god!<br>  <br>  hehe. ^^|`|mVUpt8waaa	Do you think just because he is Christian that he is automatically a  good person?
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u can contact him, but don't talk about your problems or the past. he may be married or With someone else, or he could be single. don't give him any love poems until u know he feels the same about u.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	I don't think you should mention your mistakes you have made just let them be. Just send him a message on myspace and tell him who you are and ask if he remembers you and go from there. Don't pin too much hope on what to expect. He has a life.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	It might be okay to contact him but be prepared for him to have changed and his new life might not have room for you.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	I wouldn't. You're both completely different people now.|`|MVxFOI5naa	what would it hurt to just say hello!|`|29hcn9JRaa	Your desire to contact your ex after 11 years would be acceptable if your intentions were based on simplicity versus wanting to get together and express what you had or what you wish you did' or didn't do, etc. Guys differ greatly when it comes to feelings, and being that it has been many years since the two of you have been together and also the fact that your relationship was short lived, I feel that reaching out to him and centering your contact all about romance and love would cause this guy to be a bit confused about your intentions, not to mention you don't want to appear desperate. My advise is, if you really are wanting to make contact with him then do so, go for it, however don't take this very serious and above all don't have high expectations about having a future with him, keep it light, simple and fun.   P.S I just now read your additional details, don't go their, this is why we call a ex a ex, can you imagine if all ex boyfriends and ex girlfriends decided to connect with a ex and tell how we really felt in the past? My guess is you are either doing one of two things, the first thing that comes to mind when a person wants to tell how they once felt for a ex is you want them back, the second thing that I kinda caught is the fact that you once were a heavy drinker, so if you want to contact him as you are involved with working on your 12 steps then this connection would be welcomed, but if your doing this to seek out his attention or want to reconnect, then I wouldn't go their, as you may be in store for a rude awakening? Whatever your true reasons are, I wish you all the best.  Penelope|`|AA11846750	The past is the past and you need to just let it go.  Move on and forward.  You can contact him to so you can find out how he is doing and what is new.  But don't get your hopes up on the two of you getting back together.|`|xyQRD8ahaa	it all depends on how you and you ex... going to get along..<br>  <br>  before you jump to conclusions/decisions draw a rough sketch of all the possibilities -  how would he feel the thought of rejoining? - how would things go after go join? - how would both of you sacrifice for each other?<br>  <br>  add couple of similar question that might up to you in your mind!<br>  <br>  the answers to these questions would really help you out in deciding!
SIE3HuHRaa	That is called lust, my friend, and it is more common in men than women. High unlikely that girls will cheat on guys. Don't assume anything because i have lost faith in humanity and anything can happen, but if you feel that she is cheating, talk to her personally and don't listen to the rumors!|`|XFd3oHuSaa	Never... I only like one person at a time. this way i can focus all my love and attention on them :) <br>  If she is right for you then you shall find out soon, if not then theres plenty more fish in the sea. ! <br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|rTkzJu1gaa	It depends on your definition of date.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about just going to dinner or a movie or something like that<br>  Then yes, i would go out on dates with more than one guy.<br>  <br>  If you talking about being in an exclusive relationship <br>  Then no. That would be considered cheating<br>  <br>  I see nothing wrong with going on dates with different people if you aren't in an exclusive relationship.<br>  I might not be interested in every person that i go on a date with<br>  but going on the date lets me know what kind of person they are and if i might be interested in something more<br>  <br>  Hope I answered your question.

KhGkc2QGaa	If you have a class with him or the same teacher, casually walk up to him and say something like "i forgot to write down the homework, did you get it?" It sounds kinda lame, but it's a good way to start out a conversation. If you walk up and say start your convo out with something like "how was your weekend", it may be a bit obvious that you like him. <br>  <br>  Once you've started talking, you can work your way into a more interesting topic. This is always a good method, because then he won't automatically assume that you're into him.|`|URiD8gzEaa	be like hey whats up, then say nice hair cut(or a really good compliment) then be like so whats your favorite thing to do...and everything should fall into place......

If you ignore it, it won't be fun for them.<br>  <br>  Putting that kid's name up here is really not cool, by the way.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	first of all you grow up and never put anybodys name on the yahoo answers like that.|`|RDOrTix5aa	LMFAOO OMGED THE TITLE MADE ME PISS<br>  AHAHAHAHA<br>  what is there is a guy at ur school who is so mean he makes u want to cry? cuz hes so mean?<br>  LMFAO WE GOT IT LOL
hv5guGpqaa	Hello. First of all guys are complicated lol. If a guy is flirting with you he obviously likes you. Watch out though some guys only want certain things from a girl. It's easy to tell though the real guys from the fake guys. Hate though is an easy concept. You can see hate. Love on the other hand you'll realize your in it soon enough. Love is just an unexplainable emotion. When I like a girl I tend to play it safe. Be nice and be myself. I hope you do the same. The guy who gets you must like you for you.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	when i love a girl i wanna be with her every moment i can. To hug her and kiss and fall into her arms. <br>  Hahaha im just kidding i'm not gay. You know guys are only in it for the sex|`|cRoGJ1aqaa	Start a friendly conversation with him in person. You can usually find out what their feelings are towards you.|`|2cRP9oHZaa	Like he said it should be obvious. I|`|XO5TY6tPaa	They will flirt<br>  <br>  talk<br>  <br>  <br>  wont talk|`|f898Xv1Aaa	well when i see the one i love a smile comes to my face even if i don't want|`|oFeNwMheaa	he gives u hints, and starts flirting!|`|HOVvKqxsaa	we just make it obvious|`|FfMv8pipaa	In my case it would be liking or loving a guy, but I think I might be able to help answer. First of all when I like someone, I seem to talk to them a lot more. I try to talk to them as often as I can, but when I love someone I seem to get butterflies on my stomach when I see, or think about them. I seem to want to be with them all the time, but hell, this is coming from a half gay guy, so I'm not too sure how you can judge my answer on those two. <br>  However, I do hate like most guys, and when I hate someone, I seem to ignore them. When they talk to me, I give them dirty looks and just block them out, usually I put on my headphones and turn up the volume.<br>  Honestly, you can't go by these answers though. Not every guy reacts to emotions like everyother guy. A lot of them act very different to such emotions as love. Most guys I know try to shrug it off, so going by answers online, it might not be the smartest thing to do.|`|jp8RS6OAaa	why cant you tell without us telling you?|`|6k5fhFyBaa	Well if he loves you, he'd be there to do anything for you, showing affection, and is a great friend. Boys don't usually love, men do.<br>  <br>  If he likes you, he'll probably act shy around you and flirt<br>  <br>  If he hates you, he'll probably is a huge jerk to you and makes it obvious by ignoring you.|`|NDoyhCZYaa	Love: We think about kissing and all that wonderful stuff.<br>  <br>  Like: We think about the girl all the time and always interested and extremely happy to get just a little bit of notice.<br>  <br>  Hate: We want you to burn in Hell for the rest of eternity and have a knife through your heart while your brain squeezes through your empty eye sockets as your legs are being punctured. <br>  <br>  Sorry I wasn't too specific.|`|AA11066475	if he loves you he will put you before him<br>  <br>  if he likes you he will enjoy your company and want to hang with you constantly<br>  <br>  if he hates you.....you will know.|`|Rj3epU5yaa	if i guy likes you, you will know right away.  if you want to get his attention, just flirt.|`|W1aYIF71aa	Should be fairly obvious...|`|bNx1q5oWaa	most guy will flirt if they like u<br>  most guys will ignore you if they dont lke u
EQXy6WTxaa	im a girl but i know a LOT about boys<br>  <br>  umm hell yeah he was trying 2 make u jealous!!!! i think u shud talk to him get it straight that u 2 had NUTIN in common. im just gonna suck up 2 u so i get best answer, good luck lol!!|`|vwL7twjPaa	trying to make you jealous|`|IgQ3rG3Maa	dont know trying to make you jeolous
tU5NJVL3aa	How is it these a s s holes think they can get away with it?  Seems to me you may be on your way to bigger problems than just failing Tech Ed.   Have you talked to your boyfriend?   Don't tell them, tell the teacher.  If that doesn't work, go to the principal.  If that doesn't work go to the police.

UkEVj2f1aa	just stay with your gf<br>  cuz the one you like will leave you for the one  they love|`|RkZeSKkHaa	"Don't leave the one you love for the one you like because the one you like will leave you for the one they love." If you don't like that quote, I'll give an opinion in my own words.<br>  Stay faithful to your girlfriend and stop flirting. Unless you're completely sure you like your really close friend more. There's no point being with someone you stopped liking. Uhm.. I guess it kinda depends on age. Like not many people take high school relationships seriously (from what I've seen.)|`|rUdYupCKaa	yell at your friend and brake up with the girl,i did it
SweWC8p1aa	You should flirt. You should ask her.
b35c80d41df8eace848e7c91a0b869c2aa	most likely yes.<br>  girls tend to do that.<br>  if she gets to know you and you are good looking,<br>  then there is no doubt about it, she will have a crush on you!<br>  haha.|`|ykPN1GCPaa	if he has a great personality, then yes.  ^.^|`|Hp1rNHduaa	Ummm yeah probably...depends if i'm single then most likely yeah
B8hsDjgqaa	I mean, you can't make a guy like you if he doesnt, but if he does but just isnt be flirty with him, when you speak to him keep touching his arm and look at him briefly every now and again. Worked for me :D good luck!
ObnYA9lxaa	BAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW<br>  such a sad story! I cried.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	Obviously he was expecting sex on the first night!, best off away from him, I would not have apologised - or invited him home the first night!!<br>  <br>  You sent him mixed signals.<br>  <br>  I laughed at the title of your question - not that I am unsympathetic, it is just that 'blow off' means to break wind here in the UK.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Either you really hurt his feelings, or he was just looking for sex.<br>  <br>  I would not bother him anymore.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	He wanted sex, you said no, all you were to him was a warm place to put it and now you are agonizing over this guy blowing you off?How many girls has he done since you last saw him hon.Get a clue!<br>  If you go begging after him,he might use you for sex if that is all you want.However as far as love and marriage lol, don't hold your breath.|`|n8xr5dg7aa	big misunderstanding|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Er no, you gave out signals that you liked him then told him you didn't. He thinks you're a fruit cake! no wonder he left.|`|IjJ2YoTbaa	He may have been turned off by your comment because it wasn't an honest answer in the first place.  Regardless whether you meant it or not, it's hard to take it back.  It's up to him to let it go and forgive you.  At this time there's nothing you can do.  Let it go.  If he comes around again, it will be on his term, not because you keep begging him.  <br>  <br>  You messed up.  Learn from it and try not to do that again.|`|2Fi3EmI8aa	Nope you blew it.  You embarassed and humiliated him, not to mention blue-balled him.  You have very little chance of salvage at this point.  You can try to apologise and give him the hoest reasons why IN PERSON, but the healthiest option is to move on and try to forget about it. We all make these kind of mistakes, you live, you learn.|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Obviously its because he likes to blow. he's probably an homo-sexual|`|POVsINQ1aa	you embarrassed him give it time or leave it alone|`|oLpPPm9Paa	just explain you said no and make sure he knows|`|23xC6I2Gaa	Unfortunately, I think it may be too late. You were very blunt when you told him that you weren't attracted to him. Not only is he probably put off now - but he may be a little embarrassed that he was forward enough to ask you and you let him down. I think you've done what you can... and if he is interested in being friends or meeting back up, he knows how to contact you.<br>  <br>  I think if you keep trying to contact him, it will come off a little "stalker-ish". Don't be upset about it, or worry about it... just wait and see what happens. But I really dont think there is anymore you can do right now.
fNXX2ss4aa	ive asked a guy out before<br>  there is nothing wrong with it at all <br>  yeww should just have confidence in yourself<br>  if yeww dont wanna just ask out on a date <br>  yeww can do something a bit more suttle<br>  for example yeww can say maybe we can study sometime<br>  maybe ask him to help yeww out with lesson <br>  or something like that <br>  after that if yeww feel more comfortable with him <br>  then yeww can ask if would like to get coffee or luch or something :]<br>  <br>  just remember beauty comes from within <br>  if yew have confidence yeww'll be fine:)<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  <br>  <3 emma|`|IjJ2YoTbaa	well, maybe try ask if you two can grab a coffee or drink and study or review for test.  <br>  <br>  Or if you want to be more forward, ask him to the movies and say "my treat"  It is not uncommon for girls to ask guys these days.  In fact I've known some guys who wish that a girl would ask instead.  time have change.  Otherwise you'll be sitting there waiting forever to be asked out and then it will be too late.
3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	Exhaustive scientific research has proven that the best way to lose a guy is to tell him you like him straight out.<br>  <br>  If you really want him to know that you think he is special then, brownies.  Yes brownies.  <br>  <br>  Get a box of brownie mix and bake them at home.  Next time you see him tell him how you made these brownies and you want him to have some and tell you what he thinks of them.  He will be impressed by your creativity and he will feel as if he needs to say something nice.<br>  <br>  No boy will refuse brownies.

Don't worry about it, it'll be embarrassing, but why don't you just try laughing it off (laughter's always the best medicine!!) <br>  <br>  Just treat it like, "OOh some night ehh, must have been completly out of it last night!!" <br>  <br>  I don't know what else to suggest! <br>  <br>  Good Luck :D|`|GzlckRcnaa	wow,it is really embarrassing lol.don worry i'm sure your gf can understand that.try giving some excuses like "it is very cold last night" or "i've drank a lot" etc.laugh at the thing with your gf..|`|PMwg1hWAaa	Just tell her my story:  One night I was pretty drunk.  I woke up to a smell.  I was passed out on the floor, buck naked, in a pile of my own feces.  To make things worse, it was right next to the bed and my girlfriend awoke to see me covered in my own mess.  I couldn't blame it on the dog like I had initially planned.  To make things worse, I came out of a sleeping trance a few weeks later to find myself urinating in her drawer full of clean laundry.|`|UgZq1pXjaa	Just tell her next time you'll wear a diaper to bed so she wont get wet.........
Ledi9EMXaa	stare only when hes staring at you. Wink. play in his hair and tell him hes got nice hair. smile gently not to big tho(no teeth showing) than look away and give it a few min or sec before you look back at him.You gotta get over your shyness. start by dancing in the hall ways. Tell your self that you dont care what others think of you cause its not their business and they need to stay out of it.|`|eyGAytOTaa	How to flirt with a guy<br>  <br>  1. There should be repeated contact. Eye contact is very important, it tells that you are sincere. On your first, he will make sure that it is really him that you are flirting with. With your second, he knows it's him and is all giddy about it and on your third, he might be going over to your table now, you should express interest by introducing yourself and starting a conversation.<br>  <br>  2. Whisper. This usually gets their attention. Avoid shouting. Check your voice; it may sound like a grill.<br>  <br>  3. Don't stay in a group. No man can bear a rejection in front of a herd. Also, he may feel that he can't approach you because of your friends.<br>  <br>  4. If you are not interested, be polite. You can always refer him to one of the girls. At least, you can practice your confidence in meeting other people and you just met a potential friend!<br>  <br>  5. Give clear signals that you are not just making fun out of it. Make sure to check your choice of words too, your flirting might sound a little sexual instead of a friendly flirting.<br>  <br>  6. Be positive. People like to be with people who are cheerful and has a positive mindset. Feel good about yourself and everyone, and they will feel good about you.<br>  <br>  7. Buddy system. This is used a lot by female groups going to parties or drinking place. Walk through a group of men and let one of your friends check out who is eyeing on you.<br>  <br>  8. Become more irresistible by showing a little of you, a little flesh in the legs is not that bad, wear something that can emphasize your great features.<br>  <br>  9. Give him the winning look. From head to toe, nod with approval and flash your sweetest smile.<br>  <br>  10. Lastly, don't forget to be YOURSELF! You will not enjoy any moment of it if you are playing somebody who you're not supposed to be, stay focus and be proud of who you are.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/flirting-tips-for-girls-how-to-flirt-with-a-guy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzle.com/articles/flirting-...</a>|`|BZVlzAywaa	Ok, the first thing is to not appear desperate or obnoxious. It sounds easy to avoid, but it's actually not. At all. You can catch a guy's eye by walking by him and having a somewhat loud conversation with your friends. Not too loud though, because then he'll know what's up. Just casually stroll by with a group of friends and chat. You can also just walk by him without talking, or getting a drink of water near his locker. Chances are he'll be there, and you'll catch his eye. It helps if he's in some class with you, because then you could ask him about the homework, or if he understands whatever you're learning in class. Pretend you don't get it and ask him to explain; guys LOVE feeling smart. It's not a feeling they get that often hahaha. You could also just flirt with him whenever you get the chance, like making private jokes in class or talking about some subject that both of you guys like. I hope this helps you!|`|ZDxN0g7Faa	this is definately something i wanna know too! =D
trpvcTBiaa	They probably increase them because you think of what you or even your partner might like for next time.|`|FddLQDaGaa	pure exploitation.|`|rkZhVpvgaa	Intimacy between partners increases.|`|3YTSYOzZaa	Sexual fantacies allow sexual enjoyment and respite from monotony in the single partner. Its a better alternative to adultery.Intimacy may be kept unaffectd because of this factor. Otherwise, no direct link.<br>  <br>  and, its natural of homosapiens.|`|xlJGeYmRaa	it depends....<br>  <br>  if both of you them are equally committed then the intimacy and love increases..<br>  <br>  but if either of you have just been acted as a instrument the there is a chance of decrease in intimacy... and you need to be care not to hurt each other|`|qzqEMB8Jaa	they definitely increase intimacy but for a few initial time only after u have got all ur fantasies satisfied it deems boring<br>  better to increase love and care as u never get bored caring for ur love|`|WLLqdPXeaa	Yes, there is no doubt.

Some guy's just like girls for the s*x and others because they just like girls. I would rather go out with a nice cute girl rather than a hot girl that is spoiled. A hot girl that cares for others, has a good personality and has a good sence of humor exists, she would my dream girl. A good example is Brad Pitt. He went with a cute girl (Jeniffer Aniston) and left her for a hot girl (Angelina Jolie).|`|Llo3XzGFaa	my personal top 2 are<br>  <br>  #1 the hair, for me it's gotta be dark but a lot of guys like blondes too, just varying how you style it is good enough, most girls either put way too much effort into it and guys can tell or they don't put enough into it and it looks like they went through 50mph wind every day<br>  #2 cute face, you really can't do anything to change it but don't wear too much makeup or it ruins it. I see 10-20 girls every day that do that|`|y9N3DsKBaa	It varies from guy to guy.|`|juMy8eHraa	idk about others but me i dont care what they look like i love personality the best ^_^
RoTLnFGZaa	well, obviously the guy you text is the one you want to be with.<br>  Try to be the same, don't change in you're texts. i know how it goes- shyness leads to different behaviors and it's easy to say exactly what you're feeling in texts though it is hard to do in person.  <br>  obviously-the guy you text likes you & is protective of you & is telling the other guy to back off.<br>  <br>  if the guy doesn't know that you like him, tell him! it'll only do good!|`|OzBHZ64jaa	he might like you, or he may just be flirty. <br>  just wait & see. (:<br>  good luck!|`|E58psrySaa	wow...anyways uhhhh just liike uhmmm well apparently its the persnality that really counts and i can sooo tell he is not the right one if he does that sooo ya dont go out with either. byeeeee hope it helped =]|`|oC8Ul5H6aa	Wow it sounds like he likes you to me ;)
CyWEam38aa	its probably just u
0le6RYndaa	Only dating for 4 months is kind of soon in my opinion, but it's great that you guys have talked about it.<br>  <br>  There aren't really tips for the first time.  If you both love each other then it should feel great to both of you.  Don't get so caught up in doing it perfectly, I'm sure you'll be fine.|`|0yaQQSwoaa	Hey no tips at all just note, There nothing like busting in a vajay jay for the first  time in your life.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Try not to be nervous, and don't expect a lot.  If you can do it as friends and have fun, not as a big serious 'thing' then you are more likely to enjoy it.  You're going to suck the first time, luckily at 17 you can go 4 or 5 times.  Bring extra condoms.  Make sure she gets off too, one way or the other.
6yXlP6kfaa	The best way to would be is something good happens or something he's happy about just give him a big hug. Let it go from there. Ask him to lunch one day, just casually. See happens,
G6uSrd4saa	boys r stupid like that.<br>  they like to pretend that "they have something better to do"<br>  they don't want to look 'whipped' by answering back right away.
tA5NXIZdaa	no!!..you should NEVER write a letter to someone about touchy subjects<br>  <br>  if its bothering you a lot you should find some way to talk this over with her.<br>  letters are too impersonal.|`|y7MsBXdmaa	When me & my BF broke up.. all I wanted was for him to physically say " I'm sorry I want you back"<br>  <br>  But overall it's your decision|`|7eCgt0EXaa	well i dont think you should, i think you should not even apologize, let her come to yew and besides you didnt even do anything wrong. or did you?? if she really wants to kno then let her come to u and ask.
i5Ey9stBaa	Uhm...Why?<br>  <br>  As long as you are happy thats good enough. If you can't find a boy, so? This may be a conceited thing I'm saying but I'm incredibly hot but I can't find a girl that I honestly like. I mean HONESTLY. I remember so many faces and yet I can't find interest in anyone. I attend two schools, both pretty much filled, and still can't find anyone. My high school has like 1000 people there and my other school about 200, so yeah.<br>  <br>  The thing is. I'm honestly happy. I don't think I would really want to spend my time looking for someone. I rather wait for that really special person to find me.|`|JbeQoMvTaa	Don't ever change your personality to get a boy.<br>  Be yourself, the true you. And you will find the perfect person someday.<br>  Don't rush, you have to wait.<br>  It's annoying. But it does happen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take Care (: x|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Find a nerd.  They are starved for affection, and probably are more intellectual - they wont care about your looks, they're more into you as a person.
PVsKQAVEaa	ill tell you this. the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. make him some food. or if you cant make it, buy it.|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	Brownies.<br>  <br>  Yes, I've done it.  Use home made brownies.  They work best.<br>  <br>  Just walk up to him and say, "I may some brownies.  Try this out and tell me what you think?"   He'll feel as if he needs to say something nice.|`|NkX50RHFaa	Oh the brownies idea is definetly a good idea x
O0pYOOpAaa	Give him the details. He is looking for a new GF and if you like him then you should let him know. <br>  <br>  He RESPECTS you, trusts you, sees you a a real friend, and that's why he is not hitting on you. Just let him know that you want a chance with him and then let it go from there.
0LT4Pu0Eaa	Sounds just like my relationship. I was dating this guy for four years and i caught him cheating on me twice - DONT ask why i stayed with him all that time when he was cheating on me because i dont know either. He always promised me that he would change and it wouldnt happen anymore.. but he was also very emotionally abusive. I was always depressed and i let him yell at me, cuss at me, call me names, hang up on me, etc.. It was terrible. Finally we broke up right before our four year anniversary, and a couple weeks ago he told me that he actually cheated on me with seven different girls. SEVEN! I was - and still am - so incredibly hurt. If i could go back in time i would definitely just break up with him after the first time. Because once a cheater, always a cheater..|`|A7nIADxgaa	Just break up with him. After only one year and he already cheats. Whats it gonna be after?
1OwOOJVqaa	i think that hes trying to make you jealous maybe your different from his past girls and your not allover  him like the ones hes used to so hes trying to make you jealosu so you want him more, its simple hes used to girls falling for him really quickly and you just palyin it cool so hes testing your patience to see how much you like him...|`|G6uSrd4saa	Idk, try not to get too attached to him, if possible. From what you've said, he doesn't sound much like a player, but you also don't know what else he does in his free time. I'd keep an eye out, but don't stress about it.
RsT2rifSaa	JUST THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT MAKE YOU SMILE AS SOON AS YOU SEE HIM AND YOU WILL NATURALLY SMILE.<br>  MAYBE KISS HIM ON THE CHEEK LIKE HE DID TO YOU ONCE. DONT BE NERVOUS, JUST FORGET YOUR FEELING FOR HIM BUT ONLY FOR A SEC WELL YOU SAY HI.|`|Dm2TnQKKaa	just try to look at him less as a "guy" and more as a person. that usually helps. plus, if you look at him like he's just a friend (even though you feel like he could be more), it'll help you get to know him better, and for him to get to know YOU better, too, which could start something down the road.|`|DkVofG9paa	just treat him as a friend.  You smile and say hi to your friends right?  even tho you like him, you can still be nice and friendly.  if you continue to not smile and act distant he may lose interest in you and think that you are possibly stuck up.|`|1CvAs9oJaa	Just sit down with him and tell him how you feel if he likes you back good for you... and if he doesnt its less stress holding you down and you wont be wondering "what if he liked me" and you can find the right person for you|`|TgT6Agjbaa	be yourself.|`|vR6AwIppaa	i'm sorry but i don't have the energy to read that...haha|`|XJAm82aiaa	well..that story reminds me of MYSELF!! haha<br>  <br>  I think since you guys have common friends and all its all good and you should just continue being nice like you are to other people right? like take it easy and just from saying Hey go on to how are you, how you been. the main thing is not to be shy because the guys are usually more shy then the girls themselves..i really hope it works out just dont worry :) and from what you said he does car about you so dont think he wouldnt like you|`|n06pIHFhaa	Obviously you don't want to be scarily obvious. Just running up and telling him you love him and that you want to marry him. But try not to treat him differently. The way you greet him differently sends him the message that you don't like him or something. If you like him, do the small flirts, nothing big, but atleast be nice when you greet each other. Laugh at his jokes, and meet his eyes when he talks to you. You never know, something could happen. And you might get to be more open with him <br>  all my luck to  you : )|`|XOabNcyXaa	Im pretty sure he already knows that you like him to some extent<br>  Thats real<br>  He grabbbed your hand, and gave you a kiss?<br>  Dont flirt like a little girl with no progress<br>  Flirt like an adult and pull him aside personally by hisself<br>  If you feel that your exposing yourself too much doing that, then <br>  i really dont know what to tell you<br>  Sounds like you two are in the younger crowd<br>  He is not clueless. He is just shy. And you are shy.<br>  HE ALREADY KNOWS THAT YOU ARE IN FANTASY LAND<br>  THE LONGER YOU WAIT IS NOT COOL<br>  DO IT NOW!<br>  STRAIGHT UP|`|Tp2VuKzeaa	Smile at him and maybe wink. You need to be more confident, its hard I know but if you continue treating him differently in a bad way, he is gonna think you hate him. Happened to me before. Good luck! x|`|NDoyhCZYaa	So let me summarize it...<br>  <br>  "I hung-out with a guy and I was nervous, how should I solve this?"<br>  <br>  Trust me, the guy will do anything to get you. It won't take much effort.|`|TdaPUOoHaa	Just act like yourself i know it is hard I did it for 2 years straight... but i got the guy!! So, just remember he is human to, he wont bite. He might like you the signs are all there its just he is different from most. :D|`|Wvj6o1XZaa	Trust me, just act like your normal (if you're like me, dorky) self because that's the only way he'll get the hint. Don't be so cold, girl. No one likes to play games.|`|OvXqFJzMaa	omg yeah like i read all that<br>  lol but i can still say u should be urself<br>  hope i help<br>  next time try 2 make it shorter|`|FiCl71flaa	There are confusing points in your piece. You say you like him and then say you really do not want him finding out that you like him. Yet your entire piece was about how you like him and enjoy it when he says hi to you and that you are tired of acting uninterested . I suggest the following for your consideration: 1)Decide on what you want; do you want to date him (if possible) or not. I think you want to date him. 2) If you do as I sense , then realize that you have to give him some positive signs and signals or he is going to feel that you are not interested in him and move on.Like you said in your piece, you are going to come across as distant and not a cheerful person especially since he is saying hi to you. 3) You have to understand that he is doing his best to let you know of his interest and if you do not respond , he would draw the conclusion that he is wasting his time with you. As you can see and as I am sure you already know the ball is in your court  and it now up to you what happens.Let him know of your interest by smiling, responding with eye contact when you say hi to him ,and then engaging him in conversation when the opportunity presents itself. After that go with the flow and let his words and actions guide you .
LDwDQxiLaa	well duh gurl!!! Just make sure he ain't tryin to use you for a booty call! lol|`|sKxbLn9Caa	Ahh ya if u like him make a move he might just be to shy to ask or if he isnt show him attention back like that to get the message across that you like him back|`|F7YU3FFraa	What would it mean if you tried to do this to him?<br>  <br>  Obviously, he likes you.|`|wyMzW5eraa	He ?'s you!|`|NAkQdoYlaa	Oh yeah, he likes you!<br>  <br>  :-)|`|upsx2BInaa	duh he likes u. obviously. if hes hot nd wants 2 hug u nd crap then go out w/ u. but he mite only want u 4 u know wat so b careful. hope i helped.
tK7XacH7aa	Um... first problem. You can't really know someone if you communicate through text. He's not going to get interested in you if you only communicate through text. You need to go talk with him so that you two can truly get to know each other. Stop texting, if you two look so good together because of your hobbies, friends, personalities, and etc. Then why don't you talk to him. For him to begin thinking about you, you have to go talk with him and flirt with him and hang out with him. That's the best way to get to know a person. Anyway he wants to actually hang out with you, so if you don't want to lose him, go hang out with him. <br>  Go talk with him, you can't get to know him through text. Remember that!
3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	It means Jay and Nicole are an item.|`|PKVKpzDdaa	If there flirting with eachother than yeah they prolly like eachother..|`|YS2I9y2haa	He likes her?<br>  More details please ;)|`|CcHFGjxwaa	They are attracted to each other from the way YOU describe it.<br>  What's really going on?
RzBjyzEzaa	it's not where the gift is from but how thoughtful the actual gift was.

You could also be like "how do you want me tonight" lol hoped those helped a little|`|xxfVwFhPaa	Just send him a pic message of yourself in lingerie or a bikini|`|AA11611389	"I'm not wearing anything"|`|QczEdd5qaa	talk to him<br>  <br>  ; |<br>  <br>  just be creative|`|PrRNMDXRaa	I cant say too much because i dont know what you look like or what kind of personality you have. those make a huge difference.. but say something that starts with.. 'would you do if?"  then whatever you wanna say. <br>  <br>  Ex "what would you do if i was in front of you righhht now"<br>  <br>  sounds weird but it works|`|zTBscfuraa	umm something like........<br>   awww babe i want to fall asleep in ur arms and have you hold me all nite long<br>  ...and insted of using lol or haha use sumthing like hehe or tehe|`|y7MsBXdmaa	A good one I use<br>  "I was in the shower & though of.. just though I'd text to let you know your on my mind"<br>  <br>  subtle yet getting the point across =)|`|tXrtRFoNaa	tell him you couldn't decide which panties to wear so you didn't wear any|`|ngeBdq3Maa	You must look hot in your tuxedo at work, boogiboo.<br>  <br>  That'll turn him on|`|fuJqO2Ocaa	I cant wait to get out of this thong.|`|tpPO7qehaa	WANT TO HAVE SEX.|`|X05GAaLeaa	i wanna lick all over you like hot peanut butter on toast<br>  <br>  LMAO|`|sKxbLn9Caa	well it depends on how far along u are in your relationship cause if its new he might find them depending on how dirty they are whoreish so just make them more playful instead of dirty|`|I6hd2rfKaa	try not to be to dirty lest you look like a ****. im joking|`|BKzRB6Azaa	get in his head
xcwwwhtxaa	Well, you guys should just want to eat as healthy as you can and get exercise on a regular basis,,, butt a Competition is an excellent idea to jump start the process....maybe the loser has to wear something silly to school, get a bad haircut or die their hair a weird color....<br>  <br>  Maybe you guys could each chip in a certain amount of money lik 50$ each so the total is 100$ ...Then the winner gets to go on a shopping spree to buy all new clothes to make them feel good about the wight they lost.. the loser has to carry her shopping bags all around the mall<br>  <br>  <br>  IDK but i love your idea of creating a healthy lifestyle.. I hope i helped and good luck!
aITWZoQzaa	It all depends on the guy.  Some guys are shy and that scares them because they don't know what to do and other eat that up and will follow you were ever your going and want to talk more with you.
SweWC8p1aa	he might think its interesting.. you should just try talking to him! you need to become friends before anything else..
eO4y3m1maa	just ask her out, if she says no ...go on with your life. no worries..find someone else to like.<br>  <br>  Its easier then you make it out to be:)|`|RILRurzpaa	well, looks like you got a problem.<br>  quite honestly its better to juss tell her, then spend you life wondering what could have been.<br>  im a girl, i know.<br>  if the guy i like liked me, i would def. want him to say.<br>  girls dont usually do that, take a chance (:
q1CiUd0Laa	try and sit near him in the caf or something and as cute as possible, make a comment about him... anything like, "so you play soccer?" or "i like your shirt" or even something about school, it really doesnt matter. if he likes you he will likely give you a smile and try to carry on the conversation... unless he is extremely extremely shy then he may be terrified of you even if he does like you lol
Hs10k8OUaa	Wait. I have no idea how old you are, but just wait. And I would assume that he would have a discussion with you about the topic. I think the "I love you" bit is just a way for him to get into your pants more easily. He should love you even if you don't want to have sex with him.|`|2EqtniyQaa	Buy some condoms, stick two in your pocket (in case one is broken/breaks), shave (nobody likes a bush!) just in case.  Make sure you buy some good ones, so that they don't break (made that mistake once) and be calm and cool.  If he does it too hard, make sure you ask him to stop, or slow down, because you can cause bleeding 'down there' but after you shave, put some lotion on it because some people tend to burn, develop bumps, or even redness, or itchiness.  Just to be safe, and not embarrassed.  Be safe!  Don't get hurt, and don't wear anything too slutty.  Jeans and a top/sweater would be fine.  WEAR A BRA!<br>  Good luck!|`|Lid5HBXpaa	well 1st of all how old are u? and yes shave, bring condoms owh and wat evr u do DO NOT DRINK any alcohol or do n e drugs, stay safe... gud luck|`|vwL7twjPaa	no don't bring condoms, and yes shave<br>  <br>  <br>  ok time to be a grown up.. ok plz make sure you're ready before you give him your virginity..<br>  <br>  ..hrm, i hope that cut it.<br>  cheers
4fC6EJWfaa	no, tell someone<br>  and then go find a new boyfriend...
i5Ey9stBaa	You should not hide anything. If you love your family, and they love you back, they should be able to listen to you. You need to get it out, that you still love your ex and honestly its okay to still love him. You need comforting. Not everything is solved by just one person.|`|aOtiIgYSaa	im trying to do the same but i cant get him out of mi mind. how are you pretending...? im falling apart inside..i really am...it hurts bad doesnt it.<br>  <br>  the only thing we can do is to move on..?!<br>  <br>  xxx
SIE3HuHRaa	Men can certainly be flirty and some of the signs are:<br>  <br>  Using their eyes (that smokey look) if they are staring at someone they find attractive.<br>  <br>  Being very polite and giving you that "extra attention."<br>  <br>  Some, are extremely confident and come right out and ask you to dance or ask you out on a date.<br>  <br>  Making an effort to find out more about you.|`|7SvSazrfaa	Well if your crush smiles alot around you, thats a really good way to tell.|`|nVdYIHhzaa	he'll be flirting|`|IYEiZH8naa	If they are really genuinely sweet and goes out of their way to make you happy.
rRvoOPvzaa	The biggest thing to remember is that she is not your ex. Your ex gave you reasons to distrust her, this girl is brand new, and a completely different person. Treat her like her, not like your ex. If you can't separate them in your mind, you're not ready for love yet.|`|W1aYIF71aa	eharmony people, he already is interested in a girl.  <br>  As for how you love again, counseling.|`|pR860mw7aa	go to e harmony dot com|`|Llo3XzGFaa	it probably will just take more time than last time...<br>  I know what you mean cuz I just got through a relationship where my gf was seeing a guy behind my back, I know it's hard to trust again but I also know that if a girl is worth your trust, you should be able to trust again, it will just take time|`|6oMF0EIpaa	im on the same boat as you... if you find any good advice please shoot some over here!! Im falling for this great guy but my thoughts and pain from past relationship get in the way of me trying to fall in love again|`|p3szz8g2aa	eharmony.com man!
YSAfYkPwaa	I don't know....?
4ftOPCoQaa	omg me too i dont know how to tell him eather because he sits by me in two classes but if you dont sit neer him anytime in the day then tell your friend to ask him out get his number normaly schools have a paper with numbers in it and get your friends to call him on a fri on a long weekend so if he says no you woulnt feel werid by him good luck! xD|`|5488d65a5a874c153dc0083bb5fcb518aa	well im going threw that right now; so what you can do is have  a friend of your tell him about you, just how mines did! good luck :)|`|a22BC7Eqaa	omgeee! wow tha same thing is happening to me..well my two best friends are goin out with his two best friends...so i told one of them((not tha BEST idea)) but still works...and he said that he said he kinda liked me too and he is very helpful....one thing bad is that if i say something mean to him he'll threaten me with telling someone.so maybe not tha best idea...but u cud still try it! hope i helped..good luck! =]
CyWEam38aa	if you really want to find out, go to the movies with her and watch a scary movie...|`|mCQx7Co5aa	Corey, i think it's very obvious that she does, but it actually depends on the way she says those stuff, e.g. sarcastically<br>  <br>  you can only find out if you ask her,<br>  goodluck|`|rz3RT9v6aa	Yeah she probably likes you, unless she's a tease haha.  <br>  <br>  My name's pronounced Shae too but spelt differently haha.|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Probably not.|`|3e0IjGsYaa	I don't mean to sound rude or harsh here...but as a female, I've said all sorts of those types of things to my male FRIENDS! She prolly sees you as a friend. But to make yourself sure and confident...I'd lay down the smak, and just go ask her out for coffee, dinner or a movie! It will, if anything, boost your confidence, and put an end to the questioning of whether she likes you or not!|`|bAnyRNZUaa	It looks good...say something like "for our first date let's go see another scary movie that I can protect you from".  If she says she doesn't like you like that, you can joke it off and then stop talking to her.  You don't want female friends, trust me.  Endless source of frustrations and that not great friends anyway, at least not like your guy friends are. <br>  <br>   If she's interested, you are in business!|`|AA11560862	Maybe she likes you or she could just be teasing you. Since I don't have much information, I don't know what to think.<br>  If anything, I think she's just teasing you to see how you would react. I suggest that you talk to her more and then see.|`|a1c47082c5350245c9dbdf316c0424c1aa	hm. she seems like she is definitely flirty with you...she sounds like she likes you to me..she is probably waiting for you to make the first move.|`|Llo3XzGFaa	I think you're blind, that's like everything a girl would say if they were pretty much infatuated with you<br>  how did you not get the hint, no offense<br>  but yea|`|IYEiZH8naa	Well, it definately seems like she's trying to admit some interest, otherwise she wouldn't compliment you as much.|`|5kTl3NJ2aa	It means she likes u! :P <br>  SO out there I can't believe u don't notice.|`|HXQn7XL8aa	sounds like she's using you|`|f5isPporaa	Well...maybe she does or maybe it's a way she jokes around.<br>  <br>  i have guy friends that i tell them there hot, sexy, and i love them! <br>  but thats my way of joking so i am not sure.|`|eL6QbnPLaa	If she couldn't make more obvious I think she kind of likes you. Ask her out but I don't really know the situation clearly enough so whatever but i say go for it|`|XP36zr63aa	i love you.|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Well, from an outsider's view it definitely sounds like she's into you. Maybe she's waiting for you to ask her out to make it official. Ask her out, she's sending the right signals, what is there to lose? Take the risk, if she says yes you'll be glad you did it.
aTBCXt8Taa	Hey thanks for sharing!<br>  <br>  You can definitely get a girl to sleep with you using these proven strategies. I honestly say you shouldn't look at a girl just for that my friend there is more to women than just that. =)<br>  <br>  Strategy Number One - "Domination"<br>  <br>  This is by far the best technique to get a woman into bed with you. Women like dominant men - those who make the rest of the world comply to their requests. Females never like to be put into a position where they have to lead. Instead, you will need to take control. Leaders are more attractive to the ladies than wimpy followers.<br>  <br>  Strategy Number Two - "Let's NOT Talk About Sex"<br>  <br>  Women don't want men for sex - they look for 'meaningful' relationships. This cracks me up but it's true. Make it a point NEVER to talk about sex - especially when you have just met her. When she is ready, she will initiate sex talk herself.<br>  <br>  Keep on trying and don't give up is the key, be a gentleman and be persistent.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	Be a little less desperate?<br>  If you only see a girl as something to ****, no one's going to want to go there. Perhaps you could try having a real relationship? Actually get to know a girl? I'm sure you're probably a nice guy, so you shouldn't be any worse off than anyone else. Just, yeah, try dating. Be a gentleman.<br>  <br>  Good luck anyway.|`|zfoLTzzuaa	you don't deserve a girl ...All you want is sex ...what don't you just look for a hooker or something . your question sounds so wrong .|`|CyWEam38aa	experience<br>  trial and error|`|nUYSprnIaa	be super nice and then just kiss her and their u go|`|BChHEt1Gaa	i obviously dont deserve a girl<br>  all u want is sex|`|rnXLZJyXaa	Money if you want the fast track...otherwise you need to work on your game, and it is going to be a long...hard road...but well worth it.|`|KSdxlnFfaa	you should probably just rape someone at this point
yN9ih99laa	YOURE UNDER AGE!!!!!!!<br>  NOT SAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|6UKd0Gedaa	you sound under age..<br>  anyway, expect the unexpected|`|oLhAi73caa	Well.. make sure you've got the protection (you've prob heard that too many times now!!) <br>  <br>  Viriginity is always special, you'll always remember who you lost it to, so please make sure your in a stable relationship and you both really love or like each other. <br>  <br>  Timing, atmosphere and mood are the most important things, so make sure you:<br>  <br>  Have somewhere clean and nice to do it (hotel, bedroom)- please no public toilet<br>  Make sure your sober- you want to make it special (well not to drunk) <br>  Win her over with some food, or maybe a bottle of beer -just something to relax you both<br>  Candles and flowers are always good (don't go too over the top!) <br>  <br>  Just see how it goes, and don't put any pressure on her, she may not be ready. Take it slow and seductive. <br>  <br>  Good Luck <br>  <br>  Claire :D|`|xUcjzYPdaa	Don't have sex unless both you and the other person definitely want to. Don't feel pressured, and reassure the other person that there's no pressure on them either.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to do it, make sure you have a nice private place to go - you don't want to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  If you're having sex with someone who's also a virgin, you need to prepare them so that it's less painful for them. Read up about it on the internet - also, she will guide you. Lube might be useful.<br>  <br>  WEAR A CONDOM. No excuses.<br>  <br>  Don't rush it, just do what feels natural. Explore each other's bodies.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	It's more mental and emotional preparation than anything. I was 14 when I lost mine and I'm just fine. If you honestly feel ready and there's someone that you care about who's also very much ready (whatever you do, don't pressure her), then use a condom and be safe about it. Realize that both of you are learning about your bodies together and she doesn't know any more than you do. Other than that, do what feels good for both of you and don't stress about it. Just be safe about it, use a condom, I can't stress that enough. Be safe, use a condom and use it properly.|`|XasLRQnXaa	you start by first getting a *****, unless you're gay of course.|`|ASJlcmTgaa	Well for starters dont forget protection. You both need to feel confortable and ready.  The first time prob wont go as well as you hope as it is hard to know what to expect and you are prob a bit nervous too.  Take things slow and make sure you are being safe and that you are both enjoying it.|`|JSqc3dDBaa	jerk off then multipy that feeling by 10000!! n thats the awesome feeling .. you dont really prepare it just happeness. put yourself in a position that is good for you n the girl..|`|qdWOwXBfaa	I have made the promise to not loose my virginity until I am comfortable with myself and my body, naked and clothed. You should try it. =)|`|R6BbW2D2aa	condoms
SweWC8p1aa	make her feel sexy and amazing. make her feel like she is the only one out there :)
K2VjDCb0aa	my first kiss wasnt really that special, i mean obviously i was happy, but he had just asked me to be his girlfriend like 5 or 10 minutes earlier and we were walking to my locker at school and my one friend kind of pressured us into kissing.<br>  later after everyone else was gone we kissed again and that was better.<br>  wait until the right moment, dont let anyone pressure you into it, its better when you dont expect it, but dont like attack him or something.<br>  good luck :)|`|Yize9k0Iaa	ok. i was with my bf outside in the dark and he stole my phone to make me run after him to get it so i did and he gave it back to me and kissed me :) it was sweet. and really unexpected. that makes it more memorable. :)
SIE3HuHRaa	hug and joke around! bring them their fave food or a little present!|`|oLhAi73caa	I always cheer my fiance up when I sing in the shower, ill come out and he'll be happy as anything!! <br>  <br>  :D|`|CyWEam38aa	joke, hug, kiss go easy|`|ZDxN0g7Faa	do something that made them like me in the first place. but that doesn't mean act dumb like an idiot or anything. give them a hug, kiss them, and hug them some more. support them, encourage them, and always stay by their side.|`|c1paW0bAaa	Feel better ?  Easy, oral sex.
SweWC8p1aa	Looks like he doesnt. Well then again, he is a huge player.. So he could. :/
OteNDACoaa	well she will let you tell her about your problems, and she smiles every time she sees you. And if she like to talk to you about other things than just herself. And if she uses or wears something you give her or if she says she likes something that you made or something not Perfect. and especially if she asks you what wrong when you act happy and there really is something wrong then i think she definitely likes you.<br>  You can show her that you like her by smiling at her when she looks at you... i think the best thing about guys is when they smile at me.
42r3IR34aa	Definitely - but only a little bit.  I personally couldn't go out with a guy if he was really nice but I found him physically repulsive in some way.  I think average or "boring" looks can be completely compensated for with a great personality, though.  Obviously I'd rather be in a great relationship with someone that wasn't considered that good-looking than in a boring relationship with someone I only liked for their body.  Those relationships tend to fizzle out quite quickly, too.  You need to be able to trust and talk to someone for it to work out.  However, some people might find that they can't bring themselves to look further than someone's face, boobs, etc.|`|QHnS31Scaa	they do a little|`|h35ssdmpaa	yes looks do matter. I mean, that's the first thing you see. You can't tell someones personality just by looking at them. "If Freddy Kruger had the bets personality in the world, it doesn't mean I'd date him." <br>  <br>  But it's not good to judge someone just on their looks. There has to be some kind of physical attraction.|`|sD7d3Wgpaa	to a certain extent yes they do because before you love or like someone ( i am assuming you are talking about relationships ) you have to be physically attracted to them. but looks aren't everything either keep that in mind. go more for the personality but make sure you are somewhat attracted to them physically.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Yes.|`|CSysSbnlaa	No, what matters is on the inside. Though men like skinny little girls with big chests. It's so immature. I'm skinny, but hey that's just me. Plus, the reason why a lot of girls are skinny is because they have eating disorders and do that because they want to keep their jock boyfriends. It's so stupid! No, looks don't matter.|`|aRlbTzXsaa	not if you find someone that can accept you for who you are.<br>  I am not fat or ugly, but anyone who judges me by the way I look, I write off immediately... They are worthless, and . I don't beleive it matters at all|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	Yes. Looks are the initial attraction. They play their part, but you can't have looks without personality. It's the personality which makes them stay.|`|GqYPszjuaa	to some people yes, others not so much, mostly guys want girls that look hot so to most guys looks matter|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	unfortunately, in the society that we live in, more than you think!|`|lsFveRfFaa	they shouldnt but truthfully they do|`|FQNfXgvFaa	in a way they do..looks attract men then your personallity its what really makes them like you.|`|JSqc3dDBaa	dependes|`|UxRoUTvCaa	Looks do matter, but they're not all that matters.|`|e1J4yrO2aa	yes i think looks matter... <br>  <br>   but you have to like the personality too|`|5kTl3NJ2aa	ya|`|FVTSOJBKaa	it depends that type of person you are. if ur already aware that it doesn't matter and theres higher trust to be revealed when you know this, then looks dont matter completely. but it takes a while or something to make you see this, so if it hasnt come yet, im sure it will.<br>  <br>  so to answer your question in short they matter for as long as you want them to|`|p2P9pUQKaa	yes... people always say they dont but they do!|`|88c20a250be24ae6828b2b49c2bf58edaa	not really, i think look can be overlooked when the person is humble and kind, blind people don't have a joice but they look at the inside of that person, looking good is a bonus i think, being treated different really sucks but no one is perfect|`|P7RlufZnaa	I think looks matter somewhat but shouldn't be your whole life. I think that the way you look makes first impressions on people and you never want a bad first impression.<br>  <br>  Thats my thoughts,<br>  Tina :)|`|rDizpzWOaa	honestly i dont think looks matter. it is the personality that counts.|`|2Q5EZ3pqaa	yes, too an extent.<br>  everyone knows it,<br>  as much as they want to Deny it.|`|bFF02ezDaa	hell mo looks dont matter!!!!!<br>  what matters is whats inside<br>  how u behave or how they behave<br>  it doent matter|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	to a certain extent, yea. you can't have a full relationship with someone you aren't physically attracted too. but looks aren't the most important thing about the relationship either.|`|zFb022Iiaa	Looks are the first attraction, but not what people fall in love with.|`|rVLolY7raa	Sure, who wants to look at ugly.|`|Ho9k4QzAaa	yeah a little..|`|AA11447210	On some level sure. They do to most people. If there is no physical attraction at all, intimacy is going to be a problem. ???|`|3m4YrL8qaa	of course they do to an extent.<br>  <br>  I would never date a guy that wasn't hot, but I would never date a jerk either|`|JQZzI49Paa	yep|`|7pYLhhCSaa	Well yea I guess looks matter some lol.<br>  Cuz if a guy was at school and a really ugly girl walked by he would have never talked to her cuz she was ugly.<br>  She could have had a awesome personality but he never would have known that becuz he judged her.<br>  <br>  Sadly all guys look at looks over everything.<br>  But I think personality counts too.<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  I have the most amazing bf in the world btw :D<br>  LOVE YOU BRIAN!!|`|3lKAR9G2aa	Of course looks matter.  But they can take a back seat real fast if there is no personality.  I was attracted to my wife for her looks at the very beginning, but her smile and humor and sensitivity and intelligence and... and...I could go on.  What I'm saying is that physical attraction is just the tip of the iceberg.  Now, if she's rich, her looks mean less....lol|`|vkeuaEHiaa	Initially, I think yes they do. That's the spark of attraction right there. And people perceive beauty in many different ways. But deeper into a relationship it's more about the inside, not the outside.|`|06O8FaOjaa	WELL SOMETYMS THEY DUE MATTER AND SUMTYMS THEY DNT PERSONLY I LYK MRE THERE PERSONALITY BUT THEY CANT BE BUTT UGLY|`|0c44c557b5bc5a2df5e3cbbcf028239baa	Yes, I think they help somewhat. However looks aren't the most important thing, but looks do seem to draw us together at first.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	at first when you meet the person for the first time<br>  <br>  but i think once you get to know them looks dont matter|`|W1aYIF71aa	Yes.  Anyone who says otherwise is either ugly, fat or a liar.
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	You need to find interesting things to do together. Find out what her interests are and try to do things together that are related to that. Look around locally for places that might be fun to go to. It will keep things interesting and give you more to talk about. Be creative.
i5Ey9stBaa	If we constantly stare,...<br>  <br>  Sry don't know, I'm not really normal.<br>  <br>  Look up Body language to show that a boy likes me<br>  <br>  something like that|`|UY4P6UFxaa	If they are a shy guy they'll stare constantly, either once you catch them they look away fast or they smile at you and hold the stare.|`|AlJrVK8Gaa	Guys are not hard to read.  If we go out of our way to see you or do things for you, then we like you.  If a guy pays more attention to you than his other friends that are girls, he likes you.  <br>  <br>  There are easy ways to test if a guy likes you.  Ask him to do something for you that a casual friend might not do or be quick to volunteer to do, but nothing crazy.  If he does it without question, he likes you.  If he doesn't do it, he doesn't like you.  Also, if he makes fun of or degrades one of your dates or ex-boyfriends, it means he is jealous and likes you.<br>  <br>  Just remember that guys are dumb, so don't read too much into it.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	*****?|`|CyWEam38aa	very hard to explain<br>  <br>  mainly depends on the girl

If you like him still/again then there is a good chance you will get back together.. But if yoi don't like him that way anymore back off a bit and let his feelings for this other girl grow.. Once they are closer you will be able to be his friend if that's what you want..|`|gyixPyOsaa	if he didn't still care for you he wouldn't be trying to make you feel good. think about it|`|zYqTEO2Oaa	Nah I wouldnt say its a bad thing|`|pxTsBlOMaa	not a bad thing|`|ZTY8aotTaa	noooooooooo i talk to my ex ALL THE TIME.|`|zTBscfuraa	it depend do u like his new gf|`|DXZK6eMNaa	he's probably trying to get you into a threesome.

aTBCXt8Taa	Hey! I can definitely relate to you!<br>  <br>  I felt the same way a while back and I really needed help!<br>  <br>  Thanks to a lot of research I found a formula that works. <br>  <br>  Be confident in your approach, be decisive in your decisions and always keep on a good smile.<br>  <br>  Girls love a guy who is friendly not only to her but those around him.<br>  <br>  Dedicate some time and you will be that guy that all the girls can't resist but to like.|`|SIE3HuHRaa	you be friendly and wait for your time to come. if you go out into the world on a mission to "get girls", girls will see it as desperate and a complete turn-off.

I honestly cant tell you because it is an extremely difficult way of thinking heres what i can tell you....    Get out.. One day you may want to stay inside, go out, go to a bar, just get out of the house.. Reason being is that first their are probly no girls in your house, second you might find the love of your life doing somthing simple like fillling up on gas...       Next say your at a bar or party.. you need to stand out, not in a bad way, but stand out and when you talk to her act like she is the only one in the room.. make her laugh, be confident.. You need to put her on the offense instead of defense, make her feel like shes hitting on you, instead of the opposite...  Take some risks man. remeber you will always miss a 100% of the chances you dont take..    Just thought of somthing... eye contanct: say your across the room from her and you catch her looking at you in an akward way shes probly into you... good luck|`|1N5OrPePaa	get to no them before you start to flirt. be sly with your conversation and move in slowly. and don't forget that most girls love compliments!|`|e1J4yrO2aa	be your self but  outgoing if your not... <br>  <br>   try inexperienced girls 1st|`|a1iam8Zvaa	just talk to them<br>  thats really all there is to it =]|`|8vfCRg7Caa	quit trying to "get them" and start trying to be their friends.
jprAxFILaa	Just hang out with him and see. When two people like each other, from 50-80 percent of the time they will end up with each other. Some other will not, so hang out with him and see if you two will become a couple. Just go for it and wait to see if it is.Good luck...|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Why does he have a GF, if he doesn't like her?|`|SyKr4Yjnaa	Just wait. If he doesn't like his girlfriend, it won't be long before they break up.|`|5CD9Pe7Qaa	If he really likes you he should break up with his gf and go out with you|`|5RhDnLHLaa	just go with it if you like him. wait for him to break up.. then your with him! but he  makes it seems like breaking up is so easy...  don't let him break up with you for another girl|`|cHa9BS7Vaa	well....i guess u should feel happy....rite?? but r u nervous.....if u are dont worry you like him, he likes u so it will all work out :))) dont worry :)|`|2cIceMVdaa	Okay. No problem...<br>  <br>  I am a guy in 8'th grade and i know how he feels.<br>  <br>  He is deciding who he wants to go out with, if he doesn't like his girlfriend now then i guess you have a really good chance of going out with him.<br>  <br>  1.)Show him your better than any girl her might like(as well as you)<br>  -Tell him you love him.Compliment him every other day or once a week.<br>  -Make him feel like your the for him<br>  -When him and his girlfriend break up dontt be to excited.(guys love it when girls are hard to get.not too hard but hard enouph)<br>  -When the time is right.you will go out with him. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps a lot!:)|`|1dnAlpFbaa	Don't just sit there and wait. Take some initiative and don't put yourself in that position. If he doesn't like his girlfriend, and likes you, but hasn't broken up with her yet, well that's just stupid. Tell him, if you can't have him now, you never will give him a chance. It's not worth it. I was 13 once. About 5 years ago. :)|`|mQMsyoReaa	uhh thats wierdd. cause im in the same postition. lol! hah <br>  hangout with him duhh!<br>   thats what i am doingg. then just let fate take control of it:)<br>  hope ull go out!! :)<br>  <br>  but then again if he kinda likes yooh.  thenn yooh really like him and he said he wants to hang out. tell him yooh would like that:] GOODLUCK!|`|NjYCvfYGaa	Not worth it.<br>  If he is going to break up with her and go with you, don't you think he might do the same thing to you?<br>  <br>  I did the same thing when I was in 8th grade, very immature. Just wait til they "grow up". You don't want any problems with his girlfriend either.|`|EhrB7nUXaa	just wait until he breaks up with his gf. then, when the time is right, he will ask you out. so for now, dont do anything. just go on with your life, and eventually everything will sort itself out.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	wait til he breaks up with her. if he doesn't break up with her than he might be into you but not enough to leave his current girl.<br>  <br>  just wait it out|`|VFyERjSSaa	wait til he breaks up with her!  then talk and flirt with him!!|`|9rZINwbpaa	I'm telling your father!|`|zp9eH0dOaa	Well i mean you could hang out with another hot guy and make him jealous! then he will break up with her faster!! then you guys can totally hang out with each other!!

They call you the kid who beat up the gay kid, but there's really a better reason, gay or not kids get beat up.|`|cIYD9YqGaa	violence isnt the asnwer >:[ <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219154924AAOt1mT">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>  <-- please just read it :] it takes 5 seconds i promise u 0:]|`|JIOfbDxVaa	yeah you probably shouldn't beat him up.|`|CyWEam38aa	tell him to f*** off|`|HKkbqlIuaa	It sounds to me like you want to beat him up because he's gay. If it was truly because he was interfering with your girlfriend, your question wouldn't be so centered on the fact that he's gay. This sounds like an issue between you and your girlfriend. You need to talk to her about it and explain that you think it's an issue. Also, just so you know, if you removed the word gay from this entire question, a lot people would have taken it a lot more seriously.|`|830cULmLaa	what does GAY mean in your question? <br>  <br>  if he was gay he wouldnt be worried about your girlfreind, jack. <br>  <br>  and no, you should not be beating gay guys up. theres other ways of solving problems. <br>  <br>  also, you wrote this question in the wrong section, i think it belongs in the violence section...|`|XRMNQPUIaa	threaten him or something. <br>  intimidate him by yelling abuse at him infront of everyone|`|5HECRgcMaa	I say yes but you do what you think you should weigh the consequences|`|yt2zVOZfaa	I'd say give him a good sock in the stomach if he doesn't stop when you ask him to stop.|`|p7oi3P06aa	be mature and don't listen, but if that doesn't work-beat the shi-poopie outta him|`|FGSNuP1Uaa	Yes, beat him up. If you dont, he wont stop.|`|gyixPyOsaa	nope!|`|cr9EKyNtaa	I agree with the other posters that violence is never the answer. You really need to talk to this kid about what he's doing. He sounds incredibly immature. You don't want to be labeled as "the kid who beat up the gay kid" you say but that doesn't change the fact that what he's doing is wrong. You have every right to confront him about this. If I were in your position I would have a very serious talk with him or if that doesn't work, someone else like his parents or something. Don't worry though eventually when everyone gets older it's people like him that get a bad rep for being immature. Time will sort everything out.<br>  <br>  Also the previous poster raised the possibility that he likes you and that's why he's trying to break you and your girlfriend up. This is actually a good possibility and you should ask him about this and clear it up if that's what's going on.|`|pJ5VttCZaa	No. Here's what to do. You're obviously pissed off right now so take some deep breaths. First, consider who the person is. Does he have personal issues. Like, is he akward or wierd. Maybe he has problems at home. Then consider yourself. Have you EVER tried something like this before? Maybe it doesn't have anything to do with it. Just think of a situation where someone wanted to beat you up.  Another thing -If your girlfriend actually believes the kid, then she's not worth being your girlfriend. Wouldn't you want someone you can have faith in and can have faith in you? If he does anything to you. I would give the kid a nice sock in the face. But if he just immature- make him look like the dumbass. Your'e girlfriend will look up to you for that.|`|vHVVccJmaa	Hell yeah bro when i had the same problem when i was 14 years old and i talked to the kid and tried to tell him if he doesnt back off im going to beat his as and he didn't so after two days i saw the kid after school and punched him in the mouth then he fell and then i kicked him in the mouth again and he never talked sh!t again.|`|wMc7LiT1aa	omg i had this same situation last year . trust me! confronting them doesnt help . because then they talk crap behind you  back & you end up finding out anyways . best thing is to just ignore them . let them know nothing can break you guys apart and the kid OBVIOUSLY has no life so be getting involved with yours. <br>  <br>  ps. ever stop to think to gay kid might want you? lmaoo.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	ummmm i think you should try to talk to him first. just be like stop spreadin the rumors cuz they're not true...but if he doesn't listen and keeps talkin sideways about you then idk what to do.<br>  <br>  the bad thing is the only way hes probably gonna shut up is if you beat him up but thats something you shouldn't do|`|hSSBEEFRaa	Instead of using violence to solve your problem, how about you just confront him and tell him to stay out of your life. Tell him you don't appreciate that kind of sh!t and he better back off before you get anymore pissed.
