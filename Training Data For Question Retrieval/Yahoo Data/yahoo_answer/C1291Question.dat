The Viking "Labeled Release" experiment produced results that some consider suggestive of life on Mars.  Due to the results of the other experiments, most scientists believe that Viking did not find life on Mars.      True or False:   1.  If the Viking gas exchange experiment had found no gas exchange when studying the heat treated control sample, this would strengthen the case for life on Mars.   2.  If, when studying the heat treated sample, the Viking labeled release experiment had discovered a significant amount of gaseous Carbon-14 at the end of the experiment, this would strengthen the case for life on Mars.   3.  If the Viking gas chromatograph experiments had discovered abundant organic molecules such as glucose and animo acids, this would strengthen the case for life on Mars.

We covered the proof for the division algorithm in class, the one that states:      Given integers a and b,    there exist q and r such that a=qb+r  |  0 < r <= b      I understand that proof, and it can be seen here:       http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Proof...       In my homework I need to prove two similar statements:      Given integers a and b,    there exist q and r such that a=qb+r  |  2b < r <= 3b      and      Given integers a and b,    there exist q and r such that a=qb+r  |  -1/2|b| < r <= 1/2|b|      For the first one, I thought I had it:  I just did the above proof over, but instead of taking the least element, I threw out the least two and took the third least, which puts me in the third residue class.        For the second one, though, I don't know.  And it has me second guessing my first proof.  Any insight on what modifications need to be made to the main division algorithm's proof would be very helpful...  Thanks!

20090225100248AAGQR7H	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Question about the speed of light.?	Anything in space has a speed limit, the speed of light.  But space itself is increasing at a rate faster then the speed of light.  Does this have to do with the fact the space is the whole and everything in space is just a subset of that space.  so only this "subset" (everything within) is ruled by the laws of physics?  Do scientist know why space expands faster then the speed of light.        By space i mean the distance between galaxies.  The further away a galaxy is from us the faster it is moving from us, but why.  does this have to do with dark matter and energy?

Katie has a new job as a primary school teacher. as part of a science experiment, she helped all 30 of her students to plant a seed each. after one week, the class measured their plants' heights to the nearest centimetre Several of the classes' plants had grown to 5cm. A smaller number had grown to 2cm. The rest, including micky's plant, had only grown 1cm. The class added up the total height of all plants.   after another week they measured again. all the plants except Micky's had doubled in size, where his was still only 1cm. The class added up the total heights of their plants which came to 131cm.    How many plants of each height were there after the first week?      Thanks for any help :]

How much would you agree with this peace of newly uncovered theorem:    Psychologist Bertrob Miths describes two reasons why, he says, would create an atmosphere in which thought reform is possible.      If an individual has the will to and the intelligence, with practice, the subject can project supersonic sound waves to others.   What ever the subject is thinking can be projected in the mind of the patient. No one has yet discovered how to hold connection to constantly send controls, or send many different or the same messages at the same time. It is almost impossible for most humans to send thoughts to each other.       Twin telepathy.   Twins that share similar genes will find it easier to send messages as their brain waves are similar. However, they’re in a constant sub-conscious battle that means the two subjects can't ever lack sub-conscious concentration, nor can they stop attempting to control their twins thoughts.

20090225072858AAIxdXE	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	If f(2)=1/2 and f '(2)=5/12, what is the equation of the tangent to the curve?	The original question was: "Determine the equation of the tangent to the curve y=((x^2-1)/(3x) at x=2." I found the two points to be f(2)=1/2 and f '(2)=5/12. The equation of the tangent to the curve is said to be 5x-12y-4=0, but nothing I tried gets me that answer. Do you mind showing all your steps, thanks!
20090225084825AAMJWua	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Can someone do this Math differential calculus question?	1.By studying the learning behaviour of a group of students a psychologist determines that “receptivity”, the ability of the students to grasp a difficult concept, is dependent on the number of minutes of the lecture that have elapsed before the concept is introduced. At the beginning of a lecture a student’s interest is stimulated but, as time passes, attention has become diffused.      Analysis indicates that receptivity t minutes after the lecture begins is given by the function      R(t) = –0.lt2 + 2.6t + 43      (i)By using differential calculus, determine the values of t for which R is increasing and for which R is decreasing.      (ii)Is student interest being stimulated after 10 minutes or is attentiveness falling off?      (iii)Where, during the lecture, should the most difficult concept be placed?      (iv)For the ability level of this group of students, a certain concept requires a receptivity of 61. Is it possible to teach the students this concept? Explain your answer.

20070513025944AAFwYjy	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Si può estrarre energia dal vuoto?	Il principio di indeterminazione di Heisenberg esclude che il vuoto sia nulla.   Nel vuoto le particelle possono apparire  come risultato di fluttuazioni energetiche che si trasformano in massa per istanti piccolissimi.   Alcuni fisici (discussi) spiegano la stabilità dell'orbita dell'elettrone appunto ipotizzando l'assorbimento da parte di esso dell'energia del vuoto.   Un elettrone accelerato su un'orbita circolare emettendo radiazione elettromagnetica dovrebbe cadere sul nucleo in tempi brevissimi perchè la sua energia diminuisce.      Secondo voi questa energia è recuperabile oppure è una possibilità paragonabile al moto perpetuo?      Ricerche in tal senso sono state compiute dal fisico Puthoff dell'Institute of Advanced Studies di Austin, ma finora non ha dato nessun risultato apprezzabile.

20070516102259AAd6NyY	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Interferenza del cellulare negli altoparlanti???	a cosa è dovuta? Un cell invia/riceve segnali pulsati con portanti a 900-1800MHz... se vi sono distorsioni di armoniche superiori, queste saranno a frequenza superiori rispetto ai 900MHz. Allora cosa sento negli altoparlanti?? Forse alla frequenza degli impulsi, della modulante insomma? e se si, a che fequenza sono gli impulsi?   Anche con dei walkie talkie (circa 440Mhz) sento interferenza dovuta ad un router wifi 2.4GHz, oppure sento i walkie talkie negli altoparlanti dello stereo, come mai?      Vanno bene anche risposte complesse

20070418133317AA7o4l4	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Come si sono originati nell'universo gli elementi più pesanti del ferro?	Partiamo dal presupposto (sto semplificando, è solo un modello) che all'inizio, prima o dopo il Big Bang, esistesse solo l'Idrogeno.      L'idrogeno alimenbta le stelle come il Sole dove, grazie a processi di fusione nucleare, "fonde" in elementi più pesanti:   Dall'idrogeno (1) nasce l'elio (2); da idorgeno e elio nasce il litio (3); da elio e elio nasce il berillio (4); e così via a proseguire nella tavola periodica...      Ora, sapevo che quando si arriva alla fusione del ferro (26) l'energia sprigionata non è più sufficiente a bilanciare la forza di gravità che agisce sulla massa della stella. Di conseguenza la stella collassa e, a seconda delle dimensioni e di altre variabili, esplode in una supernova o si trasforma in un buco nero. (anche qui sto semplificando alla grande).      Quello che non mi è chiaro è come siano nati gli elementi successivi al ferro... c'è qualcuno preparato sull'argomento che mi possa illuminare?      Grazie mille a tutti.... apprezzo anche risposte ironiche ... xD
