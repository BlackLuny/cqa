20090225011713AA5WhMY	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Assuming that embryonic stem-cell research in the future is now embryonic stem-cell use and research, what...?	...happens when the demand exceeds the supply.  Currently in in vitro clinics those clients pay their private money. so is it legal to use something that is theirs for public use.  Plus now companies pay money for women to donate eggs up to $1000+ and men get $50+ for sperm, so it is clearly not a purely donation based supply.  Also on a personal note, I heard that egg donating isn't that pleasant.        So what if the demand for embryonic stem cells exceeds the supply? Take blood for example, and people are not paid to donate blood. Often there is a shortage of blood.      So how does the medical community plan on obtain more embryonic stem cells?  Obviously it would be impractical to pay women and men to come in, and will people really volunteer to do it

I just would like to know if i'm identifying them all or if i may be missing any. Any help would be greatly appreciated.      An elevator, suspended by a single cable has just left the tenth floor and is speeding up as it descends toward the ground floor.      For this question I've said that Tension plays a role since it's suspended by a cable. The weight is something I was also thinking would be another force. For some reason i feel like i may be missing another force.      For the second question: A skier is going down a 20degree slope. A horizontal headwind is blowing in the skier's face. Friction is small, but not zero.      For this question I've identified the weight, the normal force, and the kinetic friction to play a role in this situation. What I'm not sure about is how the wind blowing in the skier's face plays a role . I think this one is a trickier question...      Once again any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

When scientists measure distances in space do they take into account that the speed of light has varied through the age of the universe and that as you approach the speed of light time slows down? Wouldn't this drastically affect the actual speed of light since speed is based upon a certain distance traveled over a period of time. Obviously measuring distances of a few light years is probably not a big deal but what about when you get into the millions and billions of light years?

20090225013022AA6Fxd7	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Order differential equation question?	A RLC-circuit is a simple serial circuit consists of three basic components - a resister of resistance R SZ, an inductor of inductance L H, and a capacitor of capacitance C F, that are put together in series. The circuit is connected to an external electromotive force E(t) = Eo sin wt V. Fig. shows a schematic diagram of the circuit.        The current 1(t) A in the RLC-circuit is given by a second order ordinary differential equations      21 L dt + R- t + C = E' (t) = Eow cos wt.   1. A general solution of the homogeneous equation corresponding to Eq. (1) is    10) = cle1\'t + c2e1\2t.  (1)   Find A1 and A2 in terms of R, L, and C. 2. A particular solution to Eq.(1) is      1p(t) = Io sin (wt - B).   Find Io, 0 and Zo = Io/Eoin terms of R, L, C, Eo and w. Here the quantities 0 is called the phase and Zo is called the impedance.   3. Plot 1(t) = Ih (t) + h(t) and 1p (t) on a same graph for the range of 0 < wt < 4-7r, given that R = 11 SZ, L = 0.1 H, C = 10-2 F, and E(t) = 250 sin 1007rt volts. What can you tell from the graph?            4. Plot Zo (w) and O(w), with the same parameters above, for the range of 0 < w < 47r. Comment your observations on the graphs.   Another way to analyse the RLC-circuit is to write it into a complex ordinary differential equation. The complex version of Eq. (1) is                                       Ld aa + Rd7 + I = Eowe2`~tt      1. By sustituting h = Ke"t, find K and the particular solution to the complex ODE Eq.(2). 2. Explain why the result obtained for h is in agreement with Ip.   3. The complex impedance Z is given by Z = K . What is the relation between Z and Zo that obtained previously?
