Just because your having a rather cold winter doesn't mean its not happening. The climate is not only warming its been thrown out of whack we are experiencing more extrema climate conditions. In Australia for example our droughts are getting worse and worse and due to that so are our bushfire's. In the UK and North America your all freezing. That doesn't mean its not warming up over all. Along with the change in temperature we will experience a lot of natural disasters as the climate is knocked off balance. We are quickly knocking the climate out of balance so it will swing wildly one year you may have extremely cold winters then extremely warm ones. We are near the tipping point.|`|db77723b96fc01eeed3d85a8a58e79ecaa	Funnily enough, my utility bill has been higher than normal this winter. I've had to run my air conditioning for most of the last two months because temperatures were in the high 80's to mid 90's. Could that be because it's warmer this winter than it was last winter? Could it also be that maybe, just maybe, the immediate weather conditions in my back yard are not indicative of long term global climatic trends?|`|sSvPEf97aa	Now it's called "Catastrophic Man Made Climate Change" as "Global Warming" also includes times when the climate is cold as well.  This way people can be scared all the time and not just in summer.|`|CZQU0kMBaa	I'm very curious about this myself....  There still seems to be such a great amount of support for worldwide temperature increases.  But I've also heard that there is little that we can do now to diminish it.  I think we should not worry about the future and just live for today.  If anybody is around in the future, let them figure it out... huh?<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  <br>  In my own humble opinion all of those who are making global warming such a debatable issue are trying to evade the issues that are quite definable. Our consumption is creating stress on the environment in many more ways than just greenhouse gasses. Sulfur-dioxide emission is harmful and global. Plastics and other non-biodegradable are polluting our oceans at all levels, Chemicals and heavy metals are intruding our soils, and released in our oceans and streams from improper containment and an aversion to manufacturers wanting to expend the capital to improve their methods of manufacturing. Any truly sentient being knows that we are negatively impacting the natural world through our consumtion. I certainly have no answers on how to control our greed and selfish nature. But I'm not going to stick my head in the sand and listen to those who will not accept the responsibility for the imbalance that we as a society have brought upon the natural world. We do not live in compatibility with nature, but in competition. I do think that this should change, however possible|`|076i35yGaa	Someone provided the NASA temperature data that Dr. Hansen runs as evidence of the fact of global warming.  From an interview that Dr. Hansen responded in:<br>  <br>  Q. What exactly do you mean by SAT?<br>  A. I doubt that there is a general agreement how to answer this question. Even at the same location, the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 ft above the ground and different again from 10ft or 50ft above the ground. Particularly in the presence of vegetation (say in a rain forest) the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation. A reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50ft of air either above ground or on top of the vegetation. To measure SAT we have to agree on what it is and, as far as I know, no such standard has been adopted. I cannot imagine that a weather station would build a 50ft stack of thermometers to be able to find the true<br>  SAT at its location.<br>  <br>  So the only accurate way to measure the temperature is with a 50 foot high monitoring tower.  Given that there is not one single such tower on the face of the planet I would have to say that the SAT data at NASA is completely unreliable in Dr. Hansen's own words.  Now why are we looking to destroy the worlds economies based on bad data?  That makes sense to anyone?|`|6Gfz125Paa	So you're saying that just because it's colder where you are than it was last winter, there is no global warming?<br>  <br>  That's like saying the earth must be flat because the street outside your house is flat.|`|AsKWImpQaa	Global warming is a statement about global mean temperature, not necessarily what it's like at your house at any particular moment.  This winter has been warmer than last winter at my house.  So what? It means nothing as far as global trends.  (Well, it means SOMETHING, but not very much.)<br>  <br>  Gas log fireplaces are notoriously inefficient at heating houses, by the way. They offer little in the way of radiant heat and most of the sensible heat goes up the chimney.

fp9bOiVFaa	A regular $2 bag of ice is about 2.7kg. Assuming the ice is at 0C it will take (2700g)*(80 cal/g)*(4.186 J/cal) = 904,176 Joules of energy to melt the ice. <br>  <br>  1 Joule is the same as 1 Watt*second so it takes 904,176 Ws of energy to melt that ice. <br>  <br>  Converting the watts to kilowatts and seconds to hours we get (904,176 Ws)*(1/1000 kw/w)*(1/3600 h/s) = 0.25 kwh of energy to melt your ice. <br>  <br>  0.25 kwh of energy is worth around 2.5 cents. <br>  <br>  So no, it won't work. This method will put you out about $1.97 for every bag you put in (not to mention the gas and time spent buying the ice). <br>  <br>  Someone is going to mention that you also have to take into account the ice actually being below zero and also it warming to the temperature of the fridge (around 5C) but these effects are small compared to the energy of melting.|`|s3hhLQ35aa	No.  You are expecting to save over $60/month just from the refrigerator.  I highly doubt that you even spend $60/month on the fridge as it is, so by putting a block of ice in the fridge every day you would have to miraculously make the heater or A/C more efficient too.  I doubt that will happen though.|`|I38WF5aFaa	no.|`|MBFeHS22aa	No I doubt you refrigerator is using more than $10 a month in electricity.
0KmJwYunaa	What's stopping electric vehicles from being manufactured is how to make a profit.   <br>  <br>  If it was just range, high voltage lines could easily be buried under freeway lanes, probably the HOV lanes, and between cities so that the vehicles could pick up electricity inductively and recharge as they drove.   They would also serve to guide the vehicles for automated operation which would result in a tremendous reduction of accidents.   <br>  <br>  The problem is that until recently, there would be no way of charging for that power and any automated guidance means an assumption of liability.   <br>  <br>  If the vehicles are to depend solely on batteries for range then there's the cost of battery replacement as batteries are essentially a consumable.   At present costs, the battery packs would have to be somehow subsidized perhaps by leasing the car as was done with the GM EV1.   The cost of the batteries are also a sizable portion of the entire vehicle costs and it's unlikely that the public would accept a "Batteries not included" policy.   This makes it a lot harder for the manufacturers to make a profit.   <br>  <br>  Electric vehicles will be accepted when the majority of the risk and consumable costs can be passed onto the consumer without the consumer objecting and when additional methods can be found to charge (financially) for their operation and maintenance.   This has always been the case with automobiles otherwise we would all be using PRT's where the costs to build the rail lines or guideways are a magnitude lower than the costs of building roads and where the vehicles are also much less expensive to build and operate plus the computer coordination would've made traffic jams and accidents mostly a thing of the past decades ago.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	no, because there will always be skeptics. you can never satisfy everyone.<br>  <br>  <br>  what we need to do is invest money for better batteries, and that technology for much longer range and full charges in minutes will probably be here next year!!! can't wait :P<br>  <br>  also, we need more practical electric cars. what i mean is that those small electric car companies need to stop making crappy three wheeled boxes. cause those are giving electric cars a bad name<br>  <br>  <br>  i'm surprised, because i went to the canadian auto show last tuesday and found out that atleast 5 major manufactures are comming out with fully electric cars next year or the year after!!! some of them have those dumb range extending engines...but still, its a big step forward!|`|uFQFRdczaa	I think electric cars are coming.

UtHnh0aHaa	I got a green pen today. Most of my pencils are yellow.<br>  <br>  All kidding aside, let us examine the carbon footprint in 2 ways.<br>  <br>  The first, the actual amount of energy that it takes to make each item. The pencil began as part tree (for the outside wood), part volcano (for the graphite in the centre from fossilized wood) and part decaying tree has been partially converted (on the very outside as the yellow paint). All the energy came from the sun to grow the trees and all the materials can return to soil (biodegrade) and be used by new trees to grow. The only unknown is the actual amount of energy and effort it requires to put all the materials together. This sounds like a very green process to me.<br>  <br>  The pen on the other hand is made from highly specialized materials. <br>  If it is a metal pen, the iron must be mined, processed to steel, steel must be machined (to actually make all the parts that fit together) and plated (for a fine finish outside).<br>  If it is plastic, the oil must me pumped from its source, cracked at the refinery, pelletized and mold formed at the plastic factory.<br>  Both of these types require huge amounts of heat energy to process the raw materials and it is all from external sources.<br>  The refill is also metal or plastic so the same rules apply (lots of heat energy needed). <br>  <br>  The ink is from vegetable sources but uses large amounts of heat to concentrate (boil down) the dies and active solids (resins or rosins).<br>  <br>  The second, metals, plastics all require additional energy to recycle into new materials where the wood products of the pencil will biodegrade as compost with the bacteria doing the work and generating more heat (if it was practical to recover it).<br>  <br>  I did not include the transportation for all the materials at their various stages - but metal would be the most fuel (the amount of rock separated form the iron ore is a very big ratio).<br>  <br>  The pencil sounds like a very naturally occurring choice, I think I would vote for it.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	TheTinker makes a good point. However a pen will usually have a much longer lifespan than a pencil, sometimes 5-10 fold.

To do your bit to help, try not to be wasteful with energy and recycle, reduce what you use and finally reuse some of the old items you may have lying about.<br>  <br>  By doing this, together people can help the world to stay the beautiful place that we call home.|`|AA11732853	I try to direct people's enquiries about the subject to the Scientific Community that is at the forefront of research into Climate Change, because most people are plain ignorant.<br>  <br>  Even those who, like me, have Environmental Science Degrees, only understand the general dynamics of climate and meteorology, but do not deal routinely with climate change modelling.<br>  <br>  Real Climate is a community of Climate Scientists, you'll find some interesting information and debates on their website.<br>  <br>  The other eminent source of information on climate is the IPCC.<br>  <br>  Take a look below:|`|muk4bPPhaa	The climate affects CO2 levels, a lag of about 100 or more years.

53qG7lfLaa	Both.  In order to meet growing global demand we will need all the energy we can get.  But to be honest, in my opinion, to say tha we can get off oil in 10 years is borderline unethical/political because we're not even close to having the right technology, and even if/when we did/do, it would/will take decades to build the necessary infrastructure to support it and make it commericially viable.  In order to meet future energy demand we'll need a "all of the above solution."  To give you an idea.  In 2030 energy experts predict our energy sources will breakdown like this:<br>  <br>  Oil:              34%<br>  Natural Gas: 24%<br>  Coal:            29%<br>  Nuclear:         6%<br>  Other:            8%|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	We don't "need" any electric power of any type.   We don't "need" oil or gasoline.    We don't "need" cars or lights or computers or central heating or clothing made from synthetic materials.    The original residents of the country had none of these things.    <br>     Geothermal energy is cheaper and cleaner with a smaller impact on the environment than any other form of energy generation.    We don't need it, but it's the best thing going.|`|gDFC4xm8aa	Geothermal energy is something that we need to consider using because it is a renewable energy source (never goes away) and it can help reduce the harmful carbon emissions from factories.<br>  <br>  You can read about geothermal energy here:<br>  <a href="http://www.greenstudentu.com/Geothermal_Energy.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenstudentu.com/Geothermal_...</a>|`|AA11932246	That depends.<br>  <br>  Geothermal energy only works in a limited number of places so unless you have the right geology it won't matter whether you want it or think you need it because you won't be able to do it.<br>  <br>  In places where the geology is right for geothermal though it is usually worth doing as it tends to be reasonably cheap, clean and reliable (geothermal is one of the most reliable out there).  You do of course need to manage it properly but that's true with every power source.<br>  <br>  Most of the world though needs nuclear (as that's all they can use that won't warm up the planet).
SIWh4UCyaa	Plants certainly need co2 there is no doubt of that, an increase in co2 certainly increases plant growth and reduces the requirement for water both good things, certainly in my country (Australia)<br>  It is the other problems and flow on effects co2 brings that are the problem. Even many deniers now admit we are warming but claim that it is natural.<br>  Studies have also shown that a marked increase in co2 may not continue to be of benefit to plants.<br>  <a href="http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2002/december11/jasperplots-124.html" rel="nofollow">http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/20...</a><br>  Increased plant growth will mean little if we get a 2 foot sea level rise.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	No, in fact it really doesn't tell any of the story.<br>  <br>  Yes, plants need CO2.  However, CO2 is not just plant food.  It's also a greenhouse gas.  It can also be toxic in large quantities, as is true of any substance.<br>  <br>  Yes, without CO2 we'd all die.  With too little CO2 we'd all die, and with too much CO2 we'd all die.  There is an optimal amount of CO2, probably somewhere between 280 and 350 ppm in the atmosphere.  We're now over 380 ppm, and it's resulting in rapid global warming and climate change.<br>  <br>  Nobody is saying we should eliminate CO2 from the Earth or its atmosphere.  We're saying we need to prevent the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere from becoming too large and causing catastrophic climate change via a runaway greenhouse effect.|`|b7dp2PlHaa	It is misleading because, while CO2 is necessary for plants to live, it doesn't justify people making more of it by burning fuels. I don't know if that statement was a response to an argument against really high CO2 levels, but it sounds like it could have been. The earth did fine without people, and it still could. The statement is true, but it doesn't justify humans polluting.|`|076i35yGaa	That it is plant food is misleading, it isn't just like air isn't food to us.  What is accurate is that without CO2 plants would die land and sea and we would eventually die as well.|`|t1zlbOURaa	It's not misleading at all. CO2 is plant food, without it, all of the plants would die, and we would follow.|`|9fbe56a44d7b6024062aa6bacbc528e4aa	It overly simplifies plant production (and for this argument the plant being picked is cherries).  <br>  Certainly enriching CO2 would increase plant production in a greenhouse setting where the plants are given unlimited nutrients.  In the natural environment however there is this little thing known as "Liebig's Law of the Minimum" that comes into effect, which essentially states that growth is limited to the least available nutrient.<br>  It would be analogous to humans being in a room full of food and oxygen but with insufficient water you still die.

076i35yGaa	It doesn't affect forests.  We have seen 1 degree of temperature change in the last one hundred years.  That's like saying if you transplanted a tree in one county to the next county, not country but county, south of it that it couldn't survive.  Can you even begin to comprehend how ludicrous an idea that is?|`|t1zlbOURaa	Same way as the flocks of flying monkeys sent by the Wicked Witch of the West.<br>  <br>  .... I know... and global warming isn't real either.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Some bugs cannot survive cold weather.   If it isn't cold enough too many will survive and eat the trees damaging them.    Some will be damaged enough to die, where they can catch fire easier.|`|cBNjgxW9aa	Someone better versed in the subject will hopefully respond in more detail, but there are several issues I am aware of.  First, a lot of flora and fauna is affected by small temperature variations-sometimes as little as one degree one way or the other can make a spot less hospitable than it was for the species.<br>  <br>  So minor variations can cause migration; for example, a tree line may move up a hillside, or a particular bug or other infestation might find its way into a population that has never been exposed before and has no built in defenses.  We're seeing that in some pine forests around the country but I don't know all that much about the infestation-a beetle, I believe.<br>  <br>  Of course, as a population of trees-for example-moves up the hypothetical hillside staying in the temperature sweet spot, the old growth down below dies off before the new growth reaches maturity, therebye decreasing the overall benefit of the forest-in terms of how it contributes to the removal of CO2 in the atmosphere and the ecological balance..<br>  <br>  In addition to temperatures and infestations, there is also the increased risk of drought in some areas and the added danger of fires, as you have noted.<br>  <br>  I suppose one might also mention the weather extremes predicted by global warming proponents, e.g. more frequent and violent storms, etc, etc.  Obviously, that could also affect forests quite a lot.|`|xXki7kt7aa	Well as global warming cause the temp. to steadily rise it seem likely that forest fires would start as it could be possibly more dry outside, making the forests vulnerable to forest fires. I found that (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/science/01/22/study.forests.dying/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/science/01/...</a> the excess carbon dioxide, which contributes/cause global warming has been connected to high mortality rates of trees as well. However, I also found (<a href="http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2007/01/04/global-forests-love-global-warming/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index....</a> that it can alo help growth rate and assist photosynthesis. Who knows!|`|uvSspfZBaa	lets assume global warming is real.. warmer temperatures mean more plant growth through a longer growing season.thusly we have more forests ,and indeed more green plants in general to covert that rascally c02 into oxygen...
