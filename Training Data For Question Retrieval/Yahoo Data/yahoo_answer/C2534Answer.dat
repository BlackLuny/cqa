bqLvWpcZaa	What do you mean "the car pulled"?    Is it stuck in 1st gear?  If so, have the transmission fluid level checked.  You won't be able to do this yourself because the C240 doesn't come with a transmission dipstick.  You'll have to take it to Benz or another shop that has the dipstick tool.  If the fluid level is okay, the valve body electronic plate may be kaput.  The only fix is to replace it.

AA11340447	A turbocharger is run off of the exhaust gasses passing  through the turbine housing, spinning the turbine which pushes the exhaust gas into the exhaust system.  While the turbine wheel is spinning taking the exhaust gas out of the engine, it's also spinning the compressor wheel pushing air into the engine.  A turbocharger is a positive feedback component; the more air pushed in, the more exhaust pulled out which means the more air pushed in the more exhaust pulled out and so on.  There are quite a few components necessary to bolt on an upgraded turbocharger.  Larger intercooler (Front Mount InterCooler: FMIC), intercooler piping, possibly an upgraded Blow Off Valve (BOV), possibly an external wastegate (depending on how much PSi (boost) you plan to be running, new turbo oil lines/coolant lines if the stock oil lines/coolant lines are insufficient, a fuel/engine management system (either standalone; AEM, MegaSquirt, or others.  Or a "piggy back" system; A'Pexi SAFC/SAFC 2/SAFC Neo, etc) to control the amount of fuel that is going to the engine, larger injectors, wideband O2 sensor (Innovative, AEM UEGO), Manual Boost Controller (MBC) to allow you to turn up the boost (from stock 7-9 PSi to 15+ PSI depending on internal hardness and turbocharger capabilities), aftermarket boost gauge, EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) gauge, and a slew of other things to consider..  The rule of thumb for buying turbo kits online is to just not do it.  The turbochargers that are online are cheaply made with cheap parts, tolerances are low, bearings are terrible, machining of the parts is bad.  You can, however, buy intercooler and intercooler upgrades on eBay for relatively cheap.  This part of the turbo kit is just fine, but they are sold as just universal intercooler and intercooler piping by themselves without the turbocharger.  Twin turboing your Passat is possible although if you get a good turbo set up and a good tune, you'll spend less money and get just as good of a system with one turbocharger as opposed to two.  The turbocharger that comes as OE on the Passat is a KKK (Borg-Warner) K03 turbocharger.  There is an upgrade to either a hybrid K03/K04 or a full K04 turbocharger.  The K03 is good a little past 150 horsepower.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Stop, while you're somewhat ahead.    Go do some research on a turbo.    No, it's not powered by electricity.    No, you can't afford a turbo setup right now, or a twin turbo.    No, a cheap T3 will not be what you need. Especially if you found it on ebay.    And installing it, isn't the problem. You have to tune. Get the fuel right, the airflow right, etc and so forth.    Think of it like a heart transplant. Sure, you can cut someone open, and stick a heart in there.    But does it work?    In your case, the answer would be no.    Go do RESEARCH. Then come back when you know what you're talking about.|`|sx9ZRdHBaa	since your doing research you will most likely find that you need more than Just the turbo, you need inter cooler, waste gate if not internal, bov, piping, fuel lines, exhaust manifold, and if you want high boost you will need to completely overhaul the engine to make it be able to withstand it also if planing on high boost you should put in a new ecu and a ems(engine management system).  that being said yes a t3/t4 turbo will work just fine for you.      you do not need a twin turbo Just because its a v6.   you could get a twin turbo set up, but it might just be a bigger headache than you need     no a turbo is not powered by electricity its powered by air, they compress the air flowing into the cyl, allowing for more fuel which = bigger burst or more hp    all in all if your looking to race yes its worth every penny,  if you want a daily driver then perhaps you should look at simple things like a cold air intake, a full exhaust system, and even a new ecu. also put in new spark plugs and a high flow fuel injector|`|wMnCJOksaa	Think about whether or not you'll really need it. If you plan on seriously racing it, then go for it. But if its a daily driver or something to just screw around with, there are other things you can do that are cheaper to get in case something happens.

4kmUX5pHaa	The best, easy and cheapest way is Indian Rail. First empty the fuel tank fully. Take some dry grass and plastic bags and get the vehicle covered with it so that there should be no scratch during transportation. But mind it that its stand and handel should be free for movement. Take it to the railway luggage booking office. There you have two options. One to send it through goods train and other to book it in passenger train if you too are traveling in that train and you wanted to carry it along with you. But this latter is a little bit costly option. Get it booked there for the destination of your choice. As you have not mentioned the destination so it is hard to tell the cost but it is sufficiently cheap.|`|TEW2oCF2aa	The best, cheap and safe  way is to send it by train when you travel and book it on your ticket .It will be sent either along with you or separately and safely. But your destination should have a railway station.    Or else you can send it by roadways parcel service which will be more expensive.|`|FFW91Qejaa	You have a lot of options:  1. Train (although details can be found in several websites, better to ask them directly.)  2. Cargo of Travels (Sharma, KPN, etc) visit their website or find it from google search. For example, they charge somewhere around Rs.500/- for 500 kms. almost 1 rupee per km. make sure you give a copy of the RC book & Insurance.  3. Travels (Sharma, KPN, etc) if you travel in the same bus, normally they charge the same fee as a passenger travels to any place, but they will drain away all petrol present in the bike)...........again.......dont forget to give a copy of the RC book & Insurance. This is the safest as you can see the packed bike kept inside, travel & get off the bus & take the bike.
t49AF3y3aa	Sounds like the wires on the blower motor is not all the way plugged   in.      raise the hood up on the car, The heater fan will be on the fire wall    on the passenger side  and should have 3 or 4 wires going to it.   Just push a few wires and see if that does it , If not then take it  to a garage and ask them to check the wires out that goes to the heater motor ( same as blower motor). I do not think it would cost anything for them to check it.   Good Luck.|`|L2Nde54Haa	attitude!!!  lol

f3df009ba667011af8e1c1fbf999555baa	The EGR valve allows exhaust gases to circulate through a passage in the intake manifold to heat up the intake air to allow for better cold start combustion.  If it is bad it can either stay open or stay closed if it stays closed then it would result in poor cold operation and black smoke during the first few minutes of operation in cold weather. if it stays open then it would result in slightly worse fuel economy.  IT SHOULD BE REPLACED when you replace your spark plugs or during a tune up every 50,000 miles or whenever your owner's manual says a tune up is due    Take your truck to an Auto Zone or another car parts store and get it's trouble codes scanned. Sounds to me like you truck is running rich like the other guys have said. this means your engine is getting too much fuel and carbon(black smoke) results. this is a problem with your fuel system thinking it needs more fuel than it actually needs. This is usually the default setting for engines when there is a problem, since putting too little fuel makes the engine run hot  and can ruin it where as running the engine rich just leads to carbon build up which can be reversed when the engine is running correctly.  The O2 sensor is probably bad, and maybe there is a vacuum leak around the throttle body or the manifold.  To easily check this spray WD-40 around the base of the Throttle body and where the manifold meets the heads if the engine suddenly surges or increases in idle then there is a gasket leak. Also check any vacuum lines for deterioration, which would allow extra air to enter into the combustion process which the O2 sensor picks up and increases the amount of fuel as a result....  so either the O2 sensor is bad or there is an vacuum leak.|`|3550b43625914191751143c704c4e7ecaa	you should consider replacing it along with your ecm|`|a2a039ad5e56213bec3e9ccd6f31cf6caa	I had a 91 Suburban with 350 and had many emission issues with it. First you need to do a compression test on your engine, black smoke ad 200,000 miles would lead me to believe the rings are shot and you are burning oil. if your compression test shows your cylinders around 170 to 210psi and are within 10 to 15% of each other than I would get the trucks ECM scanned, if there are no codes chances are your computer is bad, this was an issue with 91 trucks, the computer are know to fail. if there are codes then replace the equipment associated with the codes.|`|115ac680055cb17aa1ea9382faf27a0faa	The black smoke means it is running rich on fuel.  Also check the wires and plugs.  It might help to replace the o2 sensor as well

Your best bet there would be ice, I guess.    To run a heat engine on the heat of fusion of ice, which is available at 0 degrees, you'd need to reject heat at a temperature colder than that.

I ended up selling it to get a street bike.  A friend of mine had one of those big Polaris -one with the racks - they did a lot of hunting.|`|5eede7fd5e8d26df6bad082d3e741953aa	I dont know if super cleat will agree but  big bore machines tend to be less reliable then the smaller bore ones and each have their good and bad points .         I  have done alot of off roading with alot of the boys and 400 cc and below Hondas and Yamahas, You cant kill um   and    Suzuki too for that matter, hell even Kawasaki . What kills the big machines ??   (Power).        If your stuck with your 4 wheeles sucked into the mud and not turning, Which happens pretty often. these large bore machines have alot of power forcing those hubs to turn even when they are stuck hard . This puts a hell of alot more strain on the whole drive train then you could with lets say a smaller machine.and eventually they will let go .          My choice for a reliable work horse and all around off roader would be a  400 cc Honda, with a winch front and back..  Mostly due to the beltless shaft drive systeam that I believe only Honda has.. The guys with those Machines  never ever broke down when we all went out.. and when we did have break downs  My Polaris buddys were usually involved 90 % of the time  along with the only one driving a Grizzely 600, That machine stalled if you spit on the engine. It was great fun watching him curse his head off with every mud hole though

AA11872632	That'sa tough one without seeing the car. I'm going to guess that this wobbly feeling only happens at high speeds, and your two front tires are not balanced, or one of them has lost a lead balancing weight?  Your car is 16 years old.  Perhaps also,one shock absorber is not doing it's job.  do you feel you always have to correct the steering as you drive straight?  I'll look here later for your updated info.....thanks.|`|40635462c3f52e8086ec4974910b4061aa	Usually a wobbly feeling comes from a tire separation. Run your hands around the tires, front and rear, and feel for an uneven pattern on them. Sometimes you can mistake the wobbling of rear tires for the front.  An out of balance tire will cause a vibration, not a wobble.

Try raising the car with the jack with the tires suspended and put a prybar between the lower control arm and the ball joint and try to move it. You don't need a lot of prying pressure to move the joint if it is loose. You can also try putting the prybar between the wheel and the ball joint nut and pry upwards for movement. Honda ball joints have zero tolerance in play, so there should be none whatsoever.|`|97d2f6a2c894a93442ac162b66311b12aa	lots of good answers there but another thing to check would be engine and gear box mounts its worth a look
97d2f6a2c894a93442ac162b66311b12aa	check your reverse light bulb holders for any corrosion that may cause a short when you brake in reverse. have you tried taking out the reverse light bulbs try it its worth a go.when you remove the bulbs are they mounted on circut board each side if so check the main plug to each board for corrosion . also disconnect the reverse light switch on the g-box(it should near the selector leave i think) and then try it out.|`|AA10356243	It's time to bring it to a mechanic who has the wiring diagram if none of these things pan out.    My guess is you have a backfeed problem. something stupid to find for sure... One thing may be the MLP sensor on the transmission.. It tells the PCM what gear the trans is in.. They are known for causing weird problems when they go out. Don't have the book handy for this car though    Another thing may be it is shorting when in reverse as a coenidence.. then check the turn signal switch and the brake switch and it's pigtails for problems also    steering column woun't help taking it down for a electrical problem my guess is on the ground side.    also check the ground connection at the rear lights.. I'm talking where it grounds to the body.. ground goes out can theroretically ground itself through another circuit and cause issue.. check this first and replace the back bulbs for good measure.|`|2fa11e33c80b5b5b4a8f7f651d61a47faa	do you mean the turn signals?if so then try changing the flasher,it could have a short in it,but i bet its in the steering,where the turn signal switch is at.|`|70f6a36f5074dd6a22620bdb14dafe13aa	go to a REAL mechenic..who will find the problem fast.. my local guy can fix almost anything but sometimes i go to the dealer.  get going.|`|445ac91a6af0499a6ac2c44051d4403baa	My thoughts would be that you have a dead short in the wiring to  your back-up lights or the switch that operates them.Maybeso the  sockets and/or bulbs are corroded.This often happens with age  or when the bulbs are changed w/o coating them with an electro-  lytic grease before installing.  Better yet,have the system analysed by a qualified repair facility  & avoid the frustration.

AA11584457	The most simple answer:    http://www.castrol.com/castrol/genericar...    Be careful... It's messy work.  You don't necessarily have to use Castrol (in fact I usually use Mobil1 Synthetic), but the Castrol site has the most informative version I found.|`|AA11162233	they sell a small pump with a long hose you put in the oil dip stick pipe, it will suck the oil out and you just refill with oil - minus the amount in the oil filter.|`|f815c86bdd1065ec9d4a1282ece69331aa	everyone above is right, just make sure the engine is warm when changing the oil, warm oil runs better and  MOST IMPORTANT  make sure you fill the new oil filter with oil before putting it on.|`|9b6c2715c64af15c57a8f2f4c378b5a2aa	The oil pan is on the bottom of the engine. There is a bolt on the pan that you have to unscrew with a wrench or ratchet. The oil then pours out of the hole into a recepticle. Let it drain for a minute. Replace the bolt. Next, you have to change the oil filter. For this, you will need a filter wrench. It's a $5 tool, a big metal band that grips the filter. Some oil filters are harder to reach than others. Remove the oil filter by unscrewing it. It is messy. Let any oil spill into the pan on the ground. Dispose of the old filter in the box that the new one came in. Use a small plastic trash bag also. Put the new filter in. This may take a few tries if you haven't practiced it before. Before you put it in though, you rub some fresh oil on the gasket between the filter and the motor. That insures a tight seal. Screw in the new oil filter. Don't overtighten it. Just hand tighten with half your strength. Finally, pour four or five quarts of oil in the top of the motor. You're done in less than thirty minutes. It's fairly easy.|`|97d2f6a2c894a93442ac162b66311b12aa	what kinda car?

a2a039ad5e56213bec3e9ccd6f31cf6caa	If the truck shifts fine, goes into gear fine you do not have a problem. There is a safety devise that keeps you from putting the vehicle into gear if your foot is not on the brake. It sounds like yours is broken. This will not affect the operation of the transmission.|`|f8d5b1b2cf6cc3996a13cbe0bd92ccc7aa	If the truck drives fine I would not worry about the gear shift. The gear shifter has little to do with the internal workings of your trans when it comes to driveability. Keep the $3200 for something more important.

Quando crian?a vc j deve ter brincado de colocar uma bombinha de S?o Jo?o debaixo de uma lata velha e na hora que explode a lata sobe. Imagine uma caixa de ferro retangular onde s?o colocadas 4 latinhas e em cada uma  feita uma explos?o. E como ocorre isso? A gasolina fica no tanque de onde  puxada por uma bomba de gasolina. Ela passa pelo carburador, ou pelo atual sistema de inje??o - que nada mais  q um filtro do combustvel que mistura, na ponta (gicl/ou bico no caso de inje??o eletr?nica) uma pequenina quantidade de combustvel. Esse combustvel cai em cada uma das 4 latinhas. Contudo, para explodir esse combustvel precisa de uma fagulha de fogo. Bom, ai vem o trabalho da bateria. A bateria do carro que, vc sabe, fica presa junto do motor tem a fun??o de levar energia para que saia centelha para explodir cada uma dessas 4 latinhas. Assim, 4 fios saem da bateria e v?o ao distribuidor. O distribuidor manda (distribui) essa energia para os 4 fios que v?o terminar em 4 cabos de vela (e  por isso que a primeira coisa q qdo um carro n?o funciona a gente procura saber se tem combustvel ou se n?o tem energia chegando nos cabos de vela). Quando vc liga a chave do carro, ele manda energia para  as velas - como se vc tivesse  na sua casa e ligasse o fog?o e, para acender, vc utilizasse um acendedor eltrico. As velas nada mais s?o que a ponta do acendedor eltrico. Continuando, chegando a centelha eltrica, que vem da bateria, e chegando combustvel (q vem do tanque ) ocorrem 4 explos?es - CALMA, POIS N?O VAI EXPLODIR com vc, claro, pois o motor  de um ferro bem forte (desde q vc n?o joque gua fria no motor quente, pois ele assim racha - INCRVEL, N?).  At ai vc entendeu como funciona um motor? ainda n?o n? somente entendeu a idia da explos?o. Vou continuar. As 4 latinhas s?o na verdade chamadas de camisinha (nome esquisito, n?). Cada camisinha  como se fosse uma latinha de explos?o, daquelas usadas pela gente no tempo de crian?a (cansei de explodir essas latinhas - era bom mesmo). Dentro de cada latinha, ou seja, dentro de cada explos?o fica uma base chamada pist?o. Essa base  como se fosse o ch?o, mas  um falso ch?o. Deixa eu explicar melhor  - a latinha, tipo lata de leo, tem um furo em baixo. Para explodir ela deve ser aberta em baixo. Mas n?o pode ter quantidade de oxignio nem a menos, nem a mais, para poder dar a explos?o certa. A base de cada camisinha (latinha)  circular e se move dentro da latinha - claro, a camisinha n?o pode subir muito na hora da explos?o. Assim, a base falsa na verdade  circular com diamatro certinho ao da camisinha (latinha). E  cada base, (s?o 4 lembra?),   presa a um COMANDO DE VLVULA. O comando de vlvula  como uma barra de ferro ondulada, que aproveita as explos?es (alternadas) para, com a for?a das explos?es, girar as engrenagens do carro permitindo que ele tenha for?a para andar - PERFEITO? DEU P ENTENDER? Se n?o deu, imagine vc pedalando uma bicicleta - a for?a vc faz, representaria a explos?o do carro; O pedal  como o comando de vlvula que sobe e desce.   MAS AINDA N?O CHEGUEI NA IMPORTANCIA DO LEO. Ent?o vamos l - cada camisinha (latinha) em vez de subir nas explos?es, quem  sobe e desce s?o os pistons. MAS ESSE MOVIMENTO DESGASTA O FERRO DOS PISTONS E DAS CAMISINHAS. Para isso cada pist?o tem uma abertura e um anel para a SADA DO LEO que ir evitar o desgaste dos ferros das camisinhas e dos pistons (E  POR ISSO QUE UM CARRO FUMA?A QUANDO OS ANEIS FORAM P BELELU  RSSS). Lembro que o leo que vc coloca no carro TEM QUE TER QUALIDADE PARA EVITAR ESSE DESGASTE. Ai vc vai entender o quanto  importante que esse leo seja bom, liguento, capaz de SUAVIZAR E IMPEDIR O DESGASTE DESSE VAI E VEM DOS PISTONS NAS CAMISINHAS. Imagine um pnis que entra e sai numa vagina e ela n?o lubrifica.... Finalmente, lembro a vc que o leo q vc coloca no carro SEMPRE DEVE SER NOVO. USE SEMPRE LEO BOM. CUSTA CARO MESMO, mas vale 10.000 km e N?O DESGASTA AS CAMISINHAS E NEM OS PISTONS. USE LEO ESPECIAL, sai cada na faixa de R$ 25,00 dando o total de R$ 75 MAS VALE A PENA pois o motor vai durar mto. Mas procure tb trocar o filtro de leo dependendo da recomenda??o do fabricante pq o filtro funciona como rins. Finalmentem fique de olho no cabe?ote - pe?a acima do motor e responsvel pelo deslocamento da gua e do leo dentro do carro. LEO VELHO TENDE A FICAR ENCROSTADO nos caminhos do CABE?OTE e aumentam o calor nele e, se acumulados, vc vai perder o cabe?ote e TER DORES DE CABE?A, pois o cabe?ote tem uma divis?o nele entre leo e gua que circulam por seus corredores. A gua no carro funciona para ARREFECIMENTO (ou seja, esfriar o carro) como se vc tivesse esfriando uma mamadeira de crian?a - a gua  colocada no radiador (reservatrio) e na ponta do cabe?ote  colocada uma bomba dgua presa na polia (na ponta do comando de vlvula) aproveitando o movimento do carro. A bomba dgua funciona com o movimento do motor e puxa a gua do radiador para as mangueiras que passam nos corredores prprios do CABE?OTE e tb o radiador  esfriado pelo vento qdo o carro se movimenta ( p isso tem abertura na frente). Se faltar leo o CABE?OTE ESQUENTA - AI J ERA MOTOR. SEU PREJUZO VAI SER UM MOTOR NOVO.  RESUMO - N?O COMPLETE LEO - TROQUE MESMO. E se o leo tiver baixando procure as reais causas com um mecanico HONESTO e de CONFIAN?A. USE LEO BOM POIS VC GASTA NA SEGURAN?A E SEMPRE MARQUE A QUILOMETRAGEM DE 10 MIL EM 10 KM. FIQUE ESPERTO. E, AO LIGAR O CARRO ESPERE O MOTOR LUBRIFICAR POIS O LEO, QUANDO O CARRO T PARADO, FICA GUARDADO NO CARTER (PARTE DE BAIXO DO MOTOR) e, ainda, NUNCA APERTE TODO ACELERADOR QUANDO DO USO DO CARRO, MAS ACELERE SOMENTE AT A METADE. HAVENDO VAZAMENTOS DE LEO PROCURE TROCAR AS JUNTAS. FIQUE ESPERTO, POIS VC PO

Achei um Celta 08 com taxa 0,99%   em 72 vezes de 490,00 o Carro  bsico..   Se eu quiser com opcionais a mais ele sobre pra mais ou menos 27.000 e em 72 vezes ficou 526,00 e que o total fdo financiamento sai 37 .884....

e1e36a29011a66c0ced9c09f1c2a5c73aa	Low pro tires are low profile tires.   So, let's say you have 16" rims want to have 18" rims without changing the overall size of the rim-and-tire assembly (which screws with things like the speedometer). The solution is to get low pro tires, which would have, for example, 2" of rubber instead of the stock 4". Low pro tires are pointless without bigger rims and wont actually lower your car any.     As for lowering the car, the more you lower, the more it will cost. Lowering springs are fairly cheap, running about 200-300 dollars. But, if you lower it more than about 1", depending on the car, you will probably need new shocks and struts too. Struts are more expensive, 400-600 dollars for a good set (like Koni Yellows).|`|LKSCNF9Aaa	most lowering kits cost no more than $300..depends on where you are the installation can be at about the same price.|`|KJ7VjWbgaa	get low pro tires. u can lose about 2 inches of height. and not have to change a thing other than tires.     if she has 15 inch tires. and went with a 15 inch low pro she would lose the 2 inches of height.
lZboLipvaa	Hi -     Wow you are 15 and commuting 60 miles everyday?!    OK  - I used to own a Honda Civic.  It is a nice an reliable car that gets good gas mileage and is pretty good in snow.    I sold that car to my in-laws for their kids and I bought a Mini.  If you are doing highway driving (in and out of traffic) you really need the S-  horsepower is pretty important and the regular transmission didn't have the pick-up that I wanted.  This will likely up the price of the car however.      The run flat tires on the mini are an excellent feature.  If you get a flat, you can still drive 50 miles (at a lower speed).  Mini tires though, because they are run flats, tend to go flat more frequently.  Plus the reason for the run flats is that there really isn't much room for a spare.  With the Mini, there is a lot less room.  Minimal trunk space and about enough room for my small dog in the backseat!      The Mini is super-reinforced and is safer than the Civic.  They have done some really good crash tests where the Mini has done very well.      The Mini is flashy and will get you noticed but really is not as practical as the Civic.    Sorry, I don't really have a view on the Fit or the Scion.      I hope this helps.|`|8iJAVJfaaa	Well, don't get a Scion tC, the insurance prices are super high since mostly young people own them.    I would prefer the Mini Cooper, but if that wasn't affordable I would get the Honda Civic. They are very reliable!!!|`|KuScji8iaa	The Honda Civic is the only one i think you would be able to afford and maintain. I heard mini's have a lot of problems, BUT they're awesome anyways. scion- overpriced, honda fit- just don't. don't pay too much for a first car (something you wouldn't mind wrapping around a pole). Good luck|`|e1e36a29011a66c0ced9c09f1c2a5c73aa	Fit is the most fuel efficient and cheapest, but smallest. If any of that 60 miles is on a highway or freeway, the Fit is not the best choice as it is also the least powerful.  Mini Cooper is the highest-end and most expensive, but will probably be the fastest and most fun to drive.     Personally, I would recommend a Civic. Anything except a SI, which requires premium fuel and is more expensive (but much more powerful). Get a 4 door for less insurance cost. Personally, I think the new model civics are ugly as sin, but the older ones are nice and ugliness is a matter of opinion, so you might like them. |`|nK45GYgtaa	From personal experience I can tell you that Honda Civics are great cars which are excellent in mileage;  something which is in every-ones mind as of now.  I've had my Honda Civic since 1995 which I bought with only five miles on.  It is now almost up to 200,000 and I can honestly tell you that Ive never had any major mechanical problems with it.  Good Luck anyways in finding your car|`|q84C8Cugaa	The Cooper has the um cool factor despite the weight and mileage.  The Civic has the speed, aftermarket, mileage, and safety.  I will be "nice" on the Fit and just say don't.  The tc has a good group and small aftermarket but it stops there.    So out of those four going to go with the Civic. It is just better overall then the rest.    Goodluck|`|AA11607888	Pre-owned Civic from a dealer so you will still have some sort of warranty. Also request a Car-Fax report just to keep everybody honest. I've had 3 Honda's over the years and my 05 with 99,000 runs everyday and next year I'm giving it to my son and I'm buying a Civic
BrBOM8Qgaa	not any 14-17 inch alloys can fit you need to make sure they have the right stud pattern but 17s will fit fine providin they are for a fiat|`|O6PydzY9aa	Get cheap alloy wheels from:    http://www.performanceautoparts.co.uk/al...|`|gzOdJ3umaa	Yeap...   I've seen many mk2 punto's running 17'' rims with 40 profile in the tires..|`|Nx0KZfoCaa	Goes to show what some people think they know :P    The wheels would need to be the correct stud pattern, PCD and offset to fit properly...not to mention have the right c/bore.    Punto c/bore is 58.1mm, PCD is 4x98 and offset is 30-38.    You can get away with PCD 4x100 by using 'wobbly' bolts...this is safe enough as long as you check they are torqued up properly on a regular basis.    The c/bore can be 'adjusted' slightly either by using spigot rings on the alloys or by re-boring the alloys...whichever is needed....although life is MUCH easier if you just get alloys that fit in the first place ;-)    17's on the punto are do-able...but it'll reduce the amount of sterring you have due to the wheels filling the arches more and potentially hitting the arches easier.  You might need the arches rolled to fit them without any concerns with arch rubbing.    Try a search on my sources for more info. :-)

Yes, it's a special place, an airport with a tide.    Edit: Gizzo is incorrect, it is not the only beach airstrip but it's probably the only one with a scheduled service.|`|0AeH1pVuaa	I have only seen video of it, but I agree with you - it is amazing. The only airport in the whole of the UK which is just a beach. I was also amazed to find out that the aircraft's schedule depends on the timing of the tide. It's just something you don't see every day - with multi-million pound terminals and massive jets the norm.    Even just for the plane ride, it would be worth visiting Barra. In my aviation enthusiast opinion anyway.    ---[edit]-----------------------------...  It's not the only one on a beach in the UK.

Why not take it back to the shop and see what they can do?|`|t49AF3y3aa	If that is the case I would take it back and tell them to correct this problem, since it ran fine before they did the work.   It could have a bad wire or they could have knocked a sparkplug wire off and did not catch it.   And also  they would not have enough time to change a motor in 5 hours.       Good Luck.
Q2wdm3spaa	I've bought from them several times and the only problem I've had is parts being on back order. If the parts are in stock, the quality's just as good at a cheaper price. Their communication's good if the parts do happen to be out of stock, though.|`|mDvvLVl5aa	I've bought parts from them on several occasions and havent had any problem with them. Have a 95 Sporty and am purchasing a Stage 1 kit from them. Prices are far better than the stealership and appear to be just as good.|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	I didn't deal with them directly....  One of my co-workers who frequently deals with them ordered me a final drive belt. I don't know where the communication breakdown occured, I was only on the tail end. The part did not arrive in the stated time. When it got here, it was the wrong belt. It was returned, and we waited again for the right one. No overnight delivery, etc., etc.    In the end, it all worked out.   The parts are name brand, top quality.  Customer service was (apparently) good. My co-worker took care of it over the phone.  Check your shipping options, or order early.  My ONLY complaint was the time it took. That's what happens when you let a guy help you out instead of doing it all yourself.  And, as I said, the confusion could have happened any where. No one knows where the bad part number came from.   Good parts, good price.
wqeAeSVYaa	Most insurance companies will pay FAIR MARKET VALUE.     There are a number of different methods by which insurance companies determine fair market value.  Book value, is one of those methods, however there is no guarantee that your carrier will use book value.  Additionally, your perception of "excellent condition" may differ from the appraiser looking at your car.      If your car is totaled, the insurance company is not obligated to pay off your loan. They are only obligated to pay the fair market value of the car. There are a number of reasons for this:    1) an insurance company has no control over the conditions by which you finance your car.  Eg. if you have bad credit and finance a car at 28.8% interest.  Or you purchase a car over the MSRP.    2) depreciation varies from car to car.  Eg.  a Ford Taurus will depreciate faster than a same year Toyota Camry.  Therefore the market value for the Ford will be less than that of the Toyota, even if you purchased them at the same time for the same price.    If the actual cash value (fair market value) of the vehicle exceeds the amount of your loan, then yes, the insurance company will pay your loan, then send you a check for the positive equity (balance of the acv).|`|IXtiKaOYaa	Speedwell is correct;   To find the value of your 2004 SUV, check our Edmunds.com.  This gives you the cost to sell or replace your SUV.    Never, never look at blue book, since no company pays by that value, that is only dealer value off of a lot.   say for instance, your suv is worth 10k, and your loan is 12k.  the insurance company will pay you 10k and you owe your loan company 2k for the difference in your loan.    the value of your suv is what it was worth prior to your accident and no more.    the only way to get full value for your auto and loan is through your insurance policy for a new replacement and most policies only have 6 months to a year only. they also have maximum mileage to replace in these cases.  so for instance, there is a 100k mileage and a 1 year on the policy, if at 10 months, you have 100,001 in mileage, you no longer have full replacement coverage.   hope this makes sense.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	It depends on where you live and what the insurance laws are.  Where I live, collisions are considered "no fault" which means your insurance looks after your vehicle, regardless of whom is at fault.|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello    Normal you get paid book value of your car.  Unfortunately this is going to be less than the loan you took out to pay for it.  Your first action would be to pay off as much of the loan as possible then getting another loan to cover what you still owe and enough for another car.  Bare in mind that although paying back loan early you will pay the full amount including all the interest. On average the first 2 years on finance is paying the interest only then you start paying off the cost of the car.  If you pay over the book price when you bought it, it will make no difference now as today's book price is what you will get paid.    To be honest I think this is why people fake injuries to get more money apart from the value of the car to help pay off a loan that through no fault of there own they can't repay after settlement.    Andy C|`|75b701681e36bd3d8587f81aedde23aeaa	Please explain to me why they would pay off your loan AND give you money for a new car lol?  Insurance is to get you back in pre-loss condition- NOT BETTER THEN PRE LOSS!      If they both paid off your loan AND gave you a new car you would now NOT have a car payment. AKA- You would be WAY better off then before the accident.    They only owe you "actual cash value" of your car. This means what it is selling for right now. It has nothing to do with what you owe.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Not exactly. The insurance company is only obligated to compensate you for the actual cash value of your vehicle. If that's enough money to pay off your loan, then great. If not, then you pay the difference. The value of your vehicle and how much you still owe on it are 2 very different things. How much you owe on isn't the insurance company's problem, it's yours.|`|dyIyJqauaa	They will give you "Fair market value" for the car.  Fair market value has nothing to do with what you may owe on the car.  Their check will go to your lien holder.  If it isn't enough to pay off the loan, you still have to pay until the loan is satisfied.  Your car will not be replaced unless you replace (pay for another one) it.|`|nZ3ShoWcaa	It can depend  on where you live and what insurance policy you have.      We thought we were covered - our suburban was totalled in a 60 car pileup.  We were car 24 and so clearly not at fault - we got it from in front and behind and all around.  Fortunately no one was hurt ( the car took the full brunt of the collision.)    After the collision our insurance company called saying they could send us a check for $4000.  That wasn't even blue book never mind paying off the existing loan and being able to find a replacement vehicle.    It took me over three months of hassling with the insurance company ( and I do mean hassling ) for them to even accept paying us out the blue book value.    Unfortunately, like you, we didn't really look into the full ramifications of our insurance policy until after the accident.  But here is my advice now that you are in that situation.    1. more than likely your insurance company will tell you that all they can give you is this one ( low ball ) amount.  They will tell you that this is what your policy covers and they will try to get you to take it.   Do not rush into accepting the first "offer" they give you.  Make sure to insist on getting the full amount allowable by your policy.    2. stay calm and take your time.  Hopefully everyone was fine in the crash but find out how long of a time you have to report any injuries.  Our insurance company paid to have us see our doctor and we were able to get right in - but we were still in shock basically.  So, if there are any cases of whiplash or other things that might show up later you will not be covered.    3. get your own info.  Check out the blue book etc.  most insurances will only pay for a replacement car at your cars current status.  They will not cut you a check to go out and buy a brand new SUV.    Good Luck!  Hang in there and get ready to haggle.|`|3HSNFDaJaa	They won't pay the loan off only market value of the car.|`|ym9bT5lmaa	Generally, book value is payable.

5512f4d41abaf13f2fc564f491e43991aa	well what i would do is if your amp is a 2000 watt amp at 4 channels then if you hook the subs up to one channel for each then you will be pushing 500 watts to each sub. if the amp is a nonbridgable amp then youll have to do it that way. but your amp is 2000 watts it has 4 channels so its got 500 watts coming from each channel. best of luck hope it works for you
Dv0LwrTIaa	hi ive worked with a few of the makes you listed and in all honesty most of the cheap versions of these are ****.  If you're lookin for a cheap reliable amp i would suggest JBL, VIBE OR TOXIC amps, also the FLI series of amps are not bad for the price.  I would say though its better to save a little and go for something a bit better. stay clear of amps that claim to be 3000w etc, go for one with a proven RMS.|`|nVZtsvP2aa	Pyramid amps suck along with some Volfenhag and Lanzar amps but the other amps are ok. I would go with Kole Audio or Crunch and if not go with pyle or boss.|`|pI9Ebsymaa	the better amps that crunch makes aren't too bad really. my friend has the pzi 1500.1 and it bench tested around 1600 rms @ 1 ohm.|`|dRozk0cCaa	i like kole audio better|`|AA11833275	god none of those... circuit city went under, go to a store thats liquidating and get a kicker or mtx for cheap.|`|H921avAjaa	I would go for a crunch because it has low distortion than others
BJT0i2uAaa	If the sale price is 48 then the regular price would be about 53.33.   53.33 - 10% (5.333) = 47.997 rounding the 7 up brings you to 48.

l80bH2TYaa	A fuel filter, air filter, spark plugs, plug wires and a pcv valve should be replaced to perform a complete tune up. But along with that you should run a compression test on all cylinders.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Spark plugs and spark plug wires. I'd get an air filter and fuel filter as well
uLLHFiT3aa	By internal engine problem they mean lack of compression due to worn rings, damaged valve or piston. There's no fix in a bottle or tune up that will fix it. You can have an engine leak down test done to see what the problem is.  If your not planning on expensive engine work remove the  3 cylinders fuel injector wire connector and spark plug wire or coil. If the check engine light comes on just place a jumper wire on the injector wire connector, and ground the spark plug wire to a bolt on the engine. And hopefully by eliminating the slow burning and unburnt fuel from that cylinder you could pass the test. V6 or inline four? You can get by on five of six cylinders easier than three of four. People used to deactivate one or more cylinders to increase fuel mileage, but power would be down and the engine would run rough.|`|xJgILr5faa	Try new plugs maybe some wires then go to kragen and get pass test you add it to your gas drive it thru get some more gas and go get tested it works|`|GUmZuVFRaa	Put premium gas in it and new spark plugs, or disconnect the PCV valve.

There is no way to pass the test with unburnt gas in the exhaust system The 02 sensor should had turn on check engine lite. It will not pass with that lite on. Also unburnt gas is going into you engine oil.|`|DV4xyeChaa	100 to "evaluate"   hope that wasn't just a computer scan...they are free at any auto parts store...get a compression test To see if its inside engine...assuming the plugs and wires...cap/rotor  are ok...did they evaluate them?  with the HC that far out if a simple plug and wire change doesn't fix it you never will without new engine

Call a few agents.  If it is too expensive, just get liability - that will pay for damage to another person's car if you are in a wreck, but will not cover yours.  This is not the thing to do if you buy a new car.  Every state and company probably has their own rules.  I bought my car when I was 17, but I had to have a co-signer because I was a minor.  If you paid cash for the car, that shouldn't be an issue (with the car).|`|uFQFRdczaa	The answer will vary depending what state you're in.  In NY, for example, wait a month and you're an adult.      In most states, a child can void a contract, so most companies decide they won't sign contracts with children.  That would include insurance companies.  Now, if you get an adult to co-sign, that's another story entirely.  If you get along well enough with your parents, get them to co-sign at an insurance company other than the one they use.  They won't ever have to pay your insurance unless you fail to pay it before you're 18--and if that happens, they can probably just cancel it.      If that won't work, you might need to seek emancipation.  Since you live on your own, you may qualify.|`|OJT0HDKVaa	Perhaps You could google it first ,nonetheles, if you perfer some direct resource ,here http://www.Autoinsurancepro.info/auto-in...  might be your choice.

fd093fbfa4f1677838f60a723cd1f777aa	There's a wide variety... Everything including fabric, fiberglass, cotton, carbon fiber, Kevlar, aluminum, stainless steel, titanium, some plastics and wood... The material selection is determined by the engineers involved in the design. Heavier materials such as titanium and Stainless are rarely used due to weight.   Some aircraft use the body panels as structure - the skin actually makes the body stronger, sometimes MUCH stronger. Others - it's simply an aerodynamic covering.   Fabrics are typically coated with a dope or other sealant / paint to protect the fabric and ensure that it is air tight.  Fiberglass, carbon, and Kevlar have a resin impregnated into the fabric to hold the fibers together (and are often laid over foam to provide support)  Aluminum and other metals can either be left bare, treated or painted to protect them from corrosion.  Wood - again is typically painted to protect it.  Also, many materials - fabric, fiberglass, wood etc.. are UV sensitive so they are often protected with special paints to prevent damage.|`|b21fa9f80551f1440779f4c03a279e4aaa	Max... usually 2024 aluminum is at a T3 level.

i5Y320Wraa	The best place to look in my opinion is in the spare tire well under the front hood. If you are sitting in front of the car looking at the spare tire well then it will located to the left (passenger side) of the well. It should also say something to the fact about where your car was made, either germany or mexico.|`|EmgiGg17aa	look thru the drivers windshield on to the 1 inch dashboard. near the drivers corner. There is a metal strip with numbers.  That is your vin.   Everybody sees the "body", not the pan or the engine.|`|c7OOmkLXaa	The VIN is not located on the engine,that is the engine serial number. The VIN is located in two places,one is in the spare tire well,if it is still there,the other and most important one is located under the back seat,on top of the tunnel embossed into the steel. You may have to clean the top of the tunnel to see it but it is there.|`|AawNVRAsaa	Your car may have 2 different vin 's. The body and original pan may have been separated. check both locations and refer to your title as to which one is correct. You car car may be titled with the pan or the body vin . Don't go asking questions at the registry. They will get all weird on you. You will be in deep doo doo. Look at your title and find which number matches and say no more. Pans and bodies are swapped around quite frequently, due to low budgets and availability. The reasons being, a rusty body on a good pan can be removed and a good body from a rusty pan be installed. It's really not a huge job either.|`|i8soZLfRaa	The number on the engine is not the VIN. It is the engine serial number. There are three places the VIN can be found. In 1967, the VIN is a 9 digit number beginning with 117. The 11 indicates type 1 chassis and the 7 indicates model year. The last 6 digits are a serial   in order of production.    Under the back seat, stamped into the metal of the frame tunnel. This is the one that is recognized by the DMV.    In the spare tire well, you might find an aluminum plate that is rivited to the body. If the body is original to the chassis, the number here will match the one on the tunnel. This tag often includes other info, like original color code, a factory option code (M code) and original engine  .    A third place you can fin the VIN is inside the driver's side door frame. A small aluminum tag with the last 6 digits was rivited or screwed on the forward portion of the body surrounding the door.    Often the tags in the spare well and the door frame are lost to repaint jobs or body work.    ****** '67 doesn't have the VIN plate in the window, like the answer below suggests. VW didn't start doing that until '69

After a while, the ignition lock may become worn enough that it will not accept a key, or it will accept keys that it shouldn't...    2.  Loss or theft. If you loose your keys, you probably still have the other ones, so you could either drive yourself to a locksmith or to a trusted neighbor or family member who has a spare house/apartment key, or you can still get into your house/apartment and get your spare car key.

YLajQcFkaa	Oh about 40K + U.S dollars.  I've done it for customers and they just can't be COMPLETELY rebuilt.  Very well reconditioned.  These cars I refurbished were unique cars where not many were ordered or sold.  SO they were rare cars but not many people wanted them in the first place.  I would have never restored them they just were not all that but people believe a rare car is a WANTED car.  Not really in the end. But people believe what they want to believe.      Fact is a BMW of those years can't be completely rebuilt to factory and they should not have to be.  There are many good old BMWs of those years where the owners took good care of them and didn't abuse.  If you could COMPLETELY rebuild that car it would be no better then a well taken car or unmolested car of same year and model.

I'm not sure a cracked mirror would fail you, but it's worth getting it fixed to avoid the stigma and hassle of a failed test.    If you shop around the auto parts stores, you can probably find a cheap glue-on that will almost exactly cover your cracked mirror--a fairly cheap and fully satisfactory fix.

I don't think a dealership would bring the car to you.  They would have to buy it first.  And they wouldn't buy a car unseen, or not checked out first.  Besides, if they do, what's their guarantee that you would buy it?   Presume that they do...they will be paying transportation costs, and probably servicing costs, or prepping costs, which they rightfully will charge you for.  And those costs could add up to a lot, with no guarantee you will buy it.   Why would any dealership take that chance?

Something fell off of his truck and bounced on the hi-way and landed on my hood and then came right through my windshield and landed in the back seat of my truck.. I turned to the left and hit a concrete wall and then rolled over and then went end over end and stopped upside down. I slid for almost 50 yards and never hit another thing. There was a state trooper behind me and saw the whole thing. He came up to my truck expecting to find me dead. I was hanging upside down with the seat belt holding me in the truck.

I would imagine if you hit a pedestrian you would hear it unless you have the radio up too loud and you're not paying attention at all.  If you were driving too close to the divider and that caused the other car to react then they were too close as well, which you would most likely see, unless you were: fiddling with the radio, adjusting your shoes, or your eyes were just not on the road.         About the whole cutting someone off, my old boss had an elderly lady who would pull out in front of her every day to work, most likely it wasn't intentional and the old lady never looked before she pulled out in front of my boss.|`|AA11435704	If you do not physically collide with anyone, it is possible that you would not notice something that happens behind or beside you.I have seen cases where this has happened.|`|tXe51jqPaa	I too have wondered this for many years and it does seem it is possible but unlikely.
txybihhXaa	If you replaced the "blow off cable" which I think is officially called a battery safety terminal (BST) whose function is to cut off battery power in case of an accident, then it is safe to assume that somebody worked on the driver's airbag which is located in the steering wheel.  And whoever worked on the steering wheel area (not the BST) did not do it properly.  Most items controlled through the multifunction steering wheel have to pass through the slip ring in going to the main body of the car. And all the items you mentioned also has some kind of switch or lever. They have all got to be checked.  Your PDC (parking) sensors are most probably inoperative because of wiring or sensor damage in the bumper area.  Have the above items checked by a knowledgeable BMW mechanic and not a so so shade tree mechanic.
gEw83TRTaa	wow - the plethora of bad info is astounding.    yes, the dealer CAN sell the car without title in hand.  When dealing with the larger auction houses (Brashers Manheim Adessa,e tc) It is not uncommon for the title to take a few days to catch up to the car.      here's why:    Dealer A takes it in on trade, but there is a loan against the car.  As soon as that deal is OK'd by teh bank, Dealer A cuts a check to the bank, and waits for title.    In the meantime, DealerA has decided to run the car through auction - ALL of the major auction services allow cars to run through without title, but on proof of payoff, or application for duplicate.  This, again, is not uncommon.    So it goes to sale.  Dealer B purchases is, retails it out before the title has caught up to the car.  Now Dealer B is waiting on the Auction, who is waiting on Dealer A who is waitingon the finance company.  As long as the paper trail is there, its all clean.    With all of that said, there are occasionally title issues at auction.  the major houses have a policy of a 21 day turnaround.  After 21 there is a penalty to the dealer who sold the car through them.  After 30 days, the seller can force the deal to unwind.  There are dozens of reasons why this can happen.  Everything from the bank dragging their feet, to the original dealer being unable to produce title.  It does happen.    Just talk to the DMV investigator and find out what is going on.  90% of the time, the DMV can just issue a new title based on the paper trail.  However, if your situation is one of those in teh 10%, the deal unwinds, the dealer who sold to you has to refund all of your money.  They cannot charge you anything for miles, use, etc, so dont let them tell you that.    Hope that helped|`|ZKXScyRaaa	well i would get your money back intill they get the title. The dealer should have gotten the title as soon as they bought it there is somthing going on|`|PRx6j6YQaa	when you paid the dealer for the car the dealer did not pay the auction house for the car so they will not give up the title until your dealer pays them. I would talk to the DMV|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	By law, the dealer can not sell you a vehicle until he has the title in his hand. If the problem isn't handled shortly, go to the DMV and tell them the problem.

dRozk0cCaa	welll it depends on the indash if it just a regular indash dvd player, than it just like hooking up a regular aftermarket radio the only difference is that the indash will have a parking brake wire and the regular aftermarket radio won't. just hook up the parking brake wire to your parking brake or bypass by putting the wire to your ground (some other indash might be different way to bypass). if you need more help just message me.
t49AF3y3aa	Auto Zone or a car parts place|`|Fm4M1NIWaa	Any store that carries basic automotive supplies usually carry them. If push comes to shove, go to your local junkyard and take your pick. People don't usually take the fuses out of junked cars, and I'm sure the junk yard will charge little to nothing for them. You could get a lot more that way for much less cost. To find the fuses, you can usually find the list and depiction of where the fuses are located at in the owner's manual or in one of those Childer's guides
c48nm70gaa	Thermostat selection can be down right dizzying! There are many "trick" high flow selections out there. I regard genuine AC-Delco and Stant Super Stats as the very best.

Get the regular one.  I don't believe you need to replace the freeze plugs but if you keep running it at 240 you will need an engine.|`|4FFJNNjnaa	Stant, for ex., makes a "SuperStat".  It's heavier metal, but it is also a different design that fails open when it fails, assuring the engine is protected.  The less expensive design may fail closed, allowing the engine to overheat .It's worth it to me to pay another $5 for the better design

v77NR2WGaa	the 4 cyl models get about 5 MPG more than it's 6 cyl counterparts, The situation depends on if you are going to tow something with it , I would recommend the 6 cyl one. Other wise go with a 4 cyl one for commuting and etc, but as you said you might save 5K to 7K on a earlier model that is a big price difference in the long run. you would not save that much of a difference in gas costs (perhaps about 5 to 10 bucks more a week on a 6cyl one)and insurance will be a bit cheaper for the earlier model too.|`|f39faba138d31987f78525ef596325aaaa	hi,  well i work with mechanics and auto parts places. and they would tell me the 07 because they are easier to fix if anythings goes wrong but then again on the gas you are right you would save money. but it would also depend on the way you drive.|`|Wmfuk2h2aa	Hello,  I have a 2009 toyota highlander, all i got to say it is a extremely fun SUV to drive. I love the new design I really do, thats probably one of the major reasons why i got a highlander. Ok i got my toyota highlander 2009 model  for 29 grand v4. I have around 1.3k miles, and I would say you dont have to spend as much as gas :]. If your looking for gas saving cars look forward to the hybrids. However i would say to buy a 2009 highlander good gas saver :].                                                                            goodluck
H8XpaaPDaa	not always faster, but 3.6 means bigger engine, so more power. but yes, uses more gas. if the 3.6 SUV is much heavier than the 2.7, then they might be closely matched.      BUT if your looking at two SUV's that are the same model, but comes in two different engine sizes, then the 3.6 litre will be faster. bigger engine=more power, BUT uses more gas.
X6BNLeh0aa	I wouldn't say it is a difficult job, it just requires some mechanical know-how. The problem is, if you start doing it and get it all taken apart, then you can't get it back together, then you will end up paying more because you will have to pay to get it towed to a shop and then pay the shop to finish the job. It won't cost a bunch of money really. Expect to pay around $200. Just call a shop and ask for an estimate. You do not need to go to the dealer for this job.    Good luck.|`|DF1JSIqWaa	i highly recommend taking it somewhere...if im not mistaken your alternator is on the passenger side of your engine and it is an absolute pain in the behind to get the serpentine belt back on afterwards seeing as the tension pulley is under the car....

A 15" wheel will measure about 16" from edge to edge, 15" from bead to bead.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	You need to look inside the drivers door jam. Open the drivers door, look below the latch assembly There will be a small sticker (white) that will tell you the cars tire size,example (P205-75 R15) Then , write that down. You can then call around for the brand & prices you want with out leaving the house! I hope this will help you out some Good Luck!  =)

2bqmotqlaa	no you need to stop falling first of all  next when you fall and flood the bike you foul out the plug and you are trying to start a bike with a bad plu  learn to ride  cr125 all day|`|u0PHhZOSaa	when you bike get lays on it side the fuel will leak out threw the over flow. doing this and then trying to start you bike will let the engine run rich do to fumes from the fuel.  the fastest way to un- flood it will be to stop the bike, tip it on it side and turning the fuel off this will drain the carb and afterward just turn the fuel back on and ride it will start sooner and will not run rich. yes i also know you cant stop durning a race and do this but just try not fall.  this happen to anything with a carb. the over flows are there to keep it from flooding the motor. i run my quad at 1/3 open so if there is a flip over then i can just turn off the fuel fast. it also wont drain it all out do to it being 1/3 closed. good luck.|`|AA10582974	To add to some of the previous answers -  Along with holding the throttle WFO (wide f'n open) and pressing the kill switch, pull the compression release lever while kick starting it.  After a few kicks of blowing fuel out of the top end, start the engine as usual.|`|t7rCYuNlaa	My answer is the best I know what i am talking about it. Try just turning off the bike when it gets hot. Do you have the same problem then? If yes, then the coating on your vavles has gone bad. You can either get them shimed, but just replace them, shims last only 1/2 as long. Most likely just the intake vavles are bad. If the problem is only when you fall, sounds like a carb problem- but I doubt it.    P.S mise wel do piston and rings while its apart.|`|OLkdquXAaa	yo yo when you do that ik i guy who teaches me my stuff hold the throttle all the way in like you wanted to go as fast as you could hold in the clutch and kick it it will start first kick every try try it.|`|qkAoxusxaa	its part of a motorcyles nature when it falls over... dont worry, no valves need to be adjusted... that' why, specially in triling. pick your bike up fast, dont lolly gag around, you got to pick it up fast... if you dont want a flooded bike...|`|QQbtCLAkaa	if it's flooded, then there's too much gas in the cylinder.  Offset this by giving it lots of throttle when you're kicking it up.  Sometimes I have to hold it almost wide open while I'm kicking if it's flooded.  I discovered this one time when I kept thinking I was fouling plugs - nope, just need to give it more air while kicking.|`|ujUcaOTqaa	what year is it? you better get your  valve  clearance done anyway then t.you could try up-jetting  so bike burns more Fuel you could try the throttle position sensor  they can be a bit sticky when been on its side  try a twin air anti back fire filter with twin air cage kets more cold air through it .remember when four strokes are hot they will sometimes not start a class example was a couple weeks ago in ama supercross when reed took down bubba he could not restart the  yamaha and had a dnf .good luck|`|XJSWRHdiaa	Well i read the manual for my crf 230 and it said that if it gets flooded heres what to do:  1.Hold the throttle fully open  2.Hold down the killswitch  3.Kick down the kickstarter a few times (while holding down the killswitch and having the throttle fully open)  4.now let go of the killswitch and try start the bike with throttle closed.    this isnt EXACTLY what it said in the manual because crf 230s dont have kick starts they have electric start.Anyway thats what u do it works perfectly for me cause after iv done it, it just fires up and off i go...    Im not sure if this method is the same with ur bike but it should be its not to different.  Im pretty sure by doing this it sucks the flooded gas out of the carb and through the exhaust. Well i dunno im no expert.    Anyway good luck!!!
ybh71Dh9aa	you have the right to dispute the ticket in court.|`|AA11914369	Yes, you can get pulled over in a school parking lot.  The fact that you weren't stopped doesn't make it legal.  Any change from factory exhaust is a violation of law, and obviously you are running something like glass packs or other non standard mufflers or he wouldn't have been stopped.  You neglected to say location, so I can't tell you how much the fine will be.  In many states it's only a fix it ticket, you put standard mufflers on, bring it in, have a police officer sign off the ticket and it's dismissed.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	never heard of a ticket for loud exhaust, but it probably depends where you live. i've definitely heard cars where its so loud, that it would rattle your bones even though they're 50 feet away because its soooo loud...    but anyways, yea, you can get pulled over in a school parking lot.

bB5ZPtvvaa	you do not need a radiator (perhaps an intercooler is what you are thinking of).    there is a low boost supercharger installation for this car,  designed as a bolt on and does not require upgrading of the stock engine:  http://www.vividracing.com/catalog/kleem...    but at $10,500 it is the most expensive supercharger installation on the market and with only a boost of 5 p.s.i. wil produce only a power increase of 34% at the crank.    in addition labor costs and re tune of the engine management system (all in say 1 day labor) would be in the range of $1500.    ..this installation is approx. 2X the price of an average BMW installation and approx. 3X the price of an American musclecar installation (Mustang for example) and yields far less power.    In summary not economic - as your car's engine has not been designed or built for large performance increase.  It would make much more sense to upgrade your car to something that is much faster/stronger and more dependable (350z, bmwz4, honda s2000, etc.) than to add forced induction to this auto.    regards|`|bqLvWpcZaa	Would that be on a SLK230 or a SLK32 AMG.

My guess is that their plants outside of germany are for the manufacturing of various parts of the vehicle, such as doors, seats, dashboards, etc.    also, i know alof of major automobile manufacturers have joint-ventures with chinese companies, which produce automobiles for sale under chinese monickers.
