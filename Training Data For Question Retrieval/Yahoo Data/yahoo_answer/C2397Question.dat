All you have to do is go in that jewelry shop and grab that necklace the diamond one over in the corner." "Wouldn't that be stealing?" "No no no you got it all wrong we are going to pay it back later (cough)never." "I am not doing that there is serious punishments for that kind of stuff." "Ha ha I bet you can't name them because there are none." "Ok fine you could go to juvenile center or they will make u pay five times the price of the object you stole. also criminal records, kicked out of the mall for ever (banned from the mall),probation, or even trouble at you're house." "Really nerd that's why were having you do it."

20090131120222AA3mT8o	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Please i need help in science!!!?	Read the passage, then read each question below the passage. In the answer area number from 1 - 3 and report the letter of the correct answer for each question.      In the United States, there are nearly 5,000 different species of native bees. Most of them are solitary, friendly bees that nest in holes in the ground or burrows in twigs and dead tree limbs. These bees do not have hives to protect them, so they are not aggressive and rarely sting. Bumblebees, carpenter bees, sweat bees, leafcutter bees, digger bees, and others pollinate many different kinds of plants. They play a critical role in healthy wild plant communities and gardens. About 30 percent of our diet is the direct result of a pollinating visit by a bee to a flowering fruit tree or vegetable plant. Providing bee habitat in your yard can increase the quality and quantity of your fruits and vegetables. Bees are extremely sensitive to many commonly applied insecticides. If you must use chemical insecticides in your garden, apply them in the evening when bees are less likely to be active. Bees are attracted to most flowering plants, and are especially fond of blue and yellow flowers. Try planting your garden to have different species blooming in the spring, summer, and fall.      1. According to this passage, what is the niche of these “friendly” bees?      A. produces honey for local animal life   B. assists in the reproduction of plant life   C. builds hives to protect themselves   D. decomposes dead tree limbs      2. Consider the relationships between the bees, their homes in dead tree logs, and the fruit and vegetable trees. What level of organization in ecology is this passage describing?      A. biosphere   B. biome   C. community   D. population      3. What is the main idea of this passage?      A. Bees help in producing 30% of our food source.   B. Bees are more active during the day.   C. Bees are friendly and harmless.   D. Bees are important to the reproduction of plant life.

Also, can you please cut down the length of paragraph signiicantly, but talks about the main points more effectively? Thanks      My whole families on both sides are non-believers. However, ever since my uncle's family converted to Catholicism, it inspires me to become a Catholic. Although I am not a Catholic, Protestants and Catholics share many of the same beliefs. However, that was the time I began to think about becoming a Christian. However, now I do not like to be called as a Christian/ Protestant because too many Christians tend to pray using long words to attract other people’s attentions and try to act holy. They hate others and express anger more than non-Christians, instead of showing love. Ever since I came to this school, I was wondering if I really go to Christian school because the students are ignorant and show hatred towards me. I wonder how many Christians actually know Jesus. I do not really know Jesus, and every Christian should think about this matter. In the First Book of Corinthian Chapter 13 Verse 12 states that “Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known” by God. I do not even know if I will actually go to heaven because I have many struggles with God. Christians should consider this seriously whether they strongly believe that they will reach heaven because it is not as easy as you think. Just going to a Christian school, church, praying meaninglessly using the same words again and again but not earnestly, being raised in a devoted Christian family, and being with Christian friends does not absolutely make you go to heaven and know more about God. Even if you are certain you are going to heaven, what if God asks you before letting you enter, “Tell me the reasons I should let you enter my kingdom” and shows you the moments when you disobeyed God’s commands by abandoning the poor or lonely friends who desperately needed you? Jesus said the lonely and the poor are actually Him and asks Christians to love one another. If He asks me that question, I would not be able to say anything. I do not think that I can actually go to heaven right now because I do not deserve it and I am not worth it to God. However, I know God makes me think of this matter critically now because I know I cannot get away from God since God and I have built a strong relationship past years. Also, most importantly, God will NOT let go of me, rather He will tightly hold onto my hands. I think that God just wants to test me so that He can change my community through the Holy Spirit in my heart later.

20090131123939AATB9YJ	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What is the main idea in this paragraph?	3.  It was amusing to look round the filthy little scullery and think that only a double door was between us and the dining-room. There sat the customers in all their splendor--spotless table-cloths, bowls of flowers, mirrors and gilt cornices and painted cherubim; and here, just a few feet away, we in our disgusting filth. For it really was disgusting filth. There was no time to sweep the floor till evening, and we slithered about in a compound of soapy water, lettuce-leaves, torn paper and trampled food. A dozen waiters with their coats off, showing their sweaty armpits, sat at the table mixing salads and sticking their thumbs into the cream pots. The room had a dirty, mixed smell of food and sweat. Everywhere in the cupboards, behind the piles of crockery, were squalid stores of food that the waiters had stolen. There were only two sinks, and no washing basin, and it was nothing unusual for a waiter to wash his face in the water in which clean crockery was rinsing. But the customers saw nothing of this. There were a coco-nut mat and a mirror outside the dining-room door, and the waiters used to preen themselves up and go in looking the picture of cleanliness.  what is the main idea? only in  one line  Thanks a lot in advance

I rummage through the thick forest of old clothes, tennis shoes, and sandals that is my closet for acceptable footwear. I fumblingly put the chosen pair on my feet, all while staring incredulously at my self in the mirror. I allow a sigh escape my lips. You see, I am getting ready for my first play, and let’s just say I am more than a little skittish.      I sit, staring at the offending plate in front of my person with a look of utmost concern. The screeching and squealing of my fellow preschoolers but a distant white noise, and the flying of unintelligible objects a natural occurrence. I take in the far too familiar exhibition of simple white bread and the accompanying rancid odor of fish; fish that smells as though it has been sitting out in the sun far too long. Why do they always, always make us eat tuna sandwiches? Though, as I glance around, nobody seems to be in the same predicament as I. What is wrong me? I watch countless grimy hands stuff grubby faces with the sad excuse for nourishment. Hmm… or rather, what is wrong with them??

20090131143424AA3jPM3	Education & Reference;Special Education	Psych evaluation for child?	I have a few concerns with my three year old son. I pick him up every other weekend and he seems to have several issues. He's very clingyyy to my wife. Calls her mommy and every other woman figure. His vocabulary is very limited. Very! He has many temper tantrums. If one thing doesn't go his way, he acts out in aggression and bangs his head on the floor. He lives with his mother during the week and I feel she is neglecting him and mistreating him. He screams and kicks when its time to drop him home. Shes even made comments that shes wished she never had him, and she also has had DYFS called on her twice. Should I be concerned? I've brought the situation of him being behaviorally and mentally behind a few times before, and she denies the fact that something is wrong with him. I would like to have him evaluated, but I would have to involve his mother as well and shell have a fit. I believe something is wrong, I just dont know what. Any experienced people who work in this field that can steer me the right way?

20090224090744AACYJDz	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Commentaire composé sur le Père Goriot?	Bonjour, j'ai un commentaire composé à faire sur la pension Vauquer dans le Père Goriot (Balzac),est-ce que quelqu'un pourrait m'aider s'il vous plait, j'y arrive vraiment pas... Voici l'extrait :       Cette première pièce exhale une odeur sans nom dans la langue, et qu'il faudrait appeler l' odeur de pension. Elle sent le renfermé, le moisi, le rance; elle donne froid, elle est humide au nez, elle pénètre les vêtements; elle a le go?t d'une salle où l'on a d?né; elle pue le service, l'office, l'hospice. Peut-être pourrait-elle se décrire si l'on inventait un procédé pour évaluer les quantités élémentaires et nauséabondes qu'y jettent les atmosphères catarrhales et sui generis de chaque pensionnaire, jeune ou vieux. Eh bien! malgré ces plates horreurs, si vous le compariez à la salle à manger, qui lui est contigu?, vous trouveriez ce salon élégant et parfumé comme doit l'être un boudoir. Cette salle, entièrement boisée, fut jadis peinte en une couleur indistincte aujourd'hui, qui forme un fond sur lequel la crasse a imprimé ses couches de manière à y dessiner des figures bizarres. Elle est plaquée de buffets gluants sur lesquels sont des carafes échancrées, ternies, des ronds de moiré métallique, des piles d'assiettes en porcelaine épaisse, à bords bleus, fabriquées à Tournai.       Dans un angle est placée une boite à cases numérotées qui sert à garder les serviettes, ou tachées ou vineuses, de chaque pensionnaire. Il s'y rencontre de ces meubles indestructibles, proscrits partout, mais placés là comme le sont les débris de la civilisation aux Incurables. Vous y verriez un baromètre à capucin qui sort quand il pleut, des gravures exécrables qui ?tent l'appétit, toutes encadrées en bois verni à filets dorés; un cartel en écaille incrustée de cuivre; un poêle vert, des quinquets d'Argand où la poussière se combine avec l'huile, une longue table couverte en toile cirée assez grasse pour qu'un facétieux externe y écrive son nom en se servant de son doigt comme de style, des chaises estropiées, de petits paillassons piteux en sparterie qui se déroule toujours sans se perdre jamais, puis des chaufferettes misérables à trous cassés, à charnières défaites, dont le bois se carbonise. Pour expliquer combien ce mobilier est vieux, crevassé, pourri, tremblant, rongé, manchot, borgne, invalide, expirant, il faudrait en faire une description qui retarderait trop l'intérêt de cette histoire, et que les gens pressés ne pardonneraient pas. Le carreau rouge est plein de vallées produites par le frottement ou par les mises en couleur. Enfin, là règne la misère sans poésie; une misère économe, concentrée, rapée. Si elle n'a pas de fange encore, elle a des taches; si elle n'a ni trous ni haillons, elle va tomber en pourriture.

Fireflies are everywhere,   Glitters and glowing lights,   Just each time that we’re together---a dazzling world,   Oh, paradise.      CHORUS   REPEAT CHORUS

I know that kids are going to be cruel but how should I help him understand the proper ways to react to this type of behavior.  He wanted "cool" clothes for school so he wouldn't be made fun of so I shopped at Old Navy and got him some Etnies shoes and skate tees from a popular skate shop. For those of you familiar with an aspie child you know the daily challenges they encounter to the obsessions with single subjects. Please give me some ideas on how I can help him.

I heard on the news this morning that the governor of my state wants to make it mandatory for all students in grades 1-9 to have PE in school every week.  It was a great shock to me because I always assumed kids DID have recess and PE in school.  I graduated from high school in '82, which means I went to school in the 70's and we ALWAYS had some kind of physical education in all of my grades, every day.  In elementary school we had recess every day where we either played on the play groud or played dodgeball or kickball or something.  In jr high we had PE every day and in High shool we had PE if it was an elective.  When did physical education go away in school?

20090131144949AA3jQ5Y	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	How to convince my mom to home-school me.?	Home-school is a place where I can learn at my own pace. Since, obviously, teachers can't work at various paces with individual students. Especially when there's over 30 students.. I'm a slow & visual learner. And with homeschooling, I can go over the concept as many times and then move on when I'm ready. But, with lectures, that's not doing me any good.. and I'd take notes but as bad as my memory is I couldn't remember what they'd say. It's also hard as well when you only have 50 minutes for each class and about a majority of the time is spent disciplining kids, handing out papers, answering unimportant questions, off-topic, lectures, explaining what is expected, interruptions over intercom.. So basically I don't get all that's needed since we move on and don't finish what we missed in that time period. My mother can't give me a logical explanation to why I can't be home-schooled it's just a straight up answer. No. So how do I talk to her about it??       I don't procrastinate. I do my work. It's just getting made fun of and all the pressure it gives me thoughts of suicide. It's not just school it's family issues too... My mom just doesn't care about my grades and that Im failing. She just says "Oh well your sister survived school so can you" It really annoys me... Hence my sis is already graduated. Just because she survived getting made fun of doesn't mean I can. She HAD friends to talk to... I don't.          Any suggestions?

20090131155534AA83QQL	Education & Reference;Studying Abroad	Paths after graduation ?	i'm a 4th year computer engineering student and i want to plan for my life after graduation so as to take the needed steps earlier.   i though that after i graduate i would travel abroad and do my masters; part of this is because its somehow needed/adviced for and a bigger part is because i want to go abroad and see new people,new cultures,..etc. also i 'm taking this as an oppertunity for me to continue and work abroad.   this reason before is putting me off as this means that i doing my masters as a way to have a trip not for education; the second is that i may need more experience about the work enviroment to better choose the master topic. the idea for going to do my masters is that i feel it would be better to do it when i'm free before i start working and the work occupies my life and i don't do it after all.         the other option is to just work after graduating and let the events then decide what should i do.            are there any other paths i should consider ?   also what do you think about the paths i stated earlier ? and which one do you think is better overall ?
