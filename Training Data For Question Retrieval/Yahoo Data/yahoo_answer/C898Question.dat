Both collection accounts have been paid in full, so I know there is no negotiating with the collection agency at this point and I should have negotiated this prior, but what is done is done. So, please do not write that. I also know some of you will say that these items will not be removed for several years, but I know that is not true, because CitiCards took two paid collection items off of my credit report when I asked. Would someone please recommend what I should write exactly in my letter to Amex that might be more persuasive? Amex is not very amicable in my opinion and from what I have heard from others.  Citicards on the other hand is. So, if you have experience and can pass on any advice on how to deal with Amex, I  would appreciate it very much.

I'm participating in a stock simulation for my AP econ class and I came across something that was a bit confusing..      If a company is expected to report per share earnings of say, 25 cents before the market opens, does that result in mass pre-market buying, thus causing the share price to jump significantly from the market-close price when it opens?      In other words, is it a good idea to invest after-hours in a company that is expected to report earnings before the market opens?

A owner of a company has decided that, in order to improve profitability a machine will be purchased that will manufacture goods for resale and reduce the cost of the purchases of stock. The cost of the machine will be ￡ 100,000 and finance will be required. The owner has asked you lot for advice as to different method of funding that are available and the restrictions that the finance providers will probably require in each case.    THIS IS MY ANSWER can anyone give a better one:   In sole proprietorship, the sources of finance are very limited. A sole proprietor cannot issue the share of his company in the market, in order to collect some funds. The owner here has very limited options.   The owner can raise funds by borrowing money from his friends or relatives. Or he can apply for a loan from a bank. But for this he will have to mortgage his personal property. And this property may be taken away by the bank if the owner fails to repay the loan on time.  CAN U HELP ME OUT PLEASE?
20090304230639AAcVGjc	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How to phrase a misdemeanor conviction for larceny in the best way on a lease agreement?	I am filling out an application for an apartment that I really would like to be accepted for. Toward the end of the app. it ask if I have been convicted of any felonies or misdemeanors and I was convicted of a misdemeanor for larceny when I was 17. Three friends and I broke into our high-school to screw a with a teachers room that we disliked. We did that and that was supposed to be the end of it but one of the other guys on the way out saw the video projector in the middle of the room and wanted to take it. We were in a rush to get out so no one told him not to, we were just like "whatever, lets go!" So eventually when we were turned in the only thing we were charged with was larceny and we had to serve 20 hours community service and pay $4000 for the projector even though it was recovered from the guys house undamaged. So this is a pretty horrible sounding story that we stole $4000 dollars from a public school. How should i describe this conviction on the three lines provided on the application. I'm not sure how to take the punch out stealing from a school. I'm desperate for this apartment because I will be saving $150 from what I am paying now which is slightly more that half my income.

They reckon they can't afford the upkeep of our council houses as all the rent money we pay goes straight to the government and there isn't any left for the repairs we need.

I've been a council tenant for 7 years and the rent has gone up  by about ￡5 a week every year.    Has anyone else experienced a transfer and what are your views? Is it a good thing or is it a way of the council just washing their hands of the housing needs and getting someone else to do their dirty work and charge people more?

20090304225218AAaU0Rt	Business & Finance;Credit	What is all in a credit score? Does credit start only when you have a credit card?	I am 22 years old, and I have never owned or had a credit card. I know, bizarre right? And while i've recently applied to get one (want to buy a new car in about a year and be able to sign the loan and car myself and not with a co-signer), I've been curious if I have ANY credit at all - good or bad - or if I have absolutely none.      Now, do I have a debit card? Yes. But I don't think that matters. Here's what I've had my name attached to, but don't know if it helps / matters.      1. Had a Netflix account for about 9 months, and it automatically withdrew the money every month from my checking account. Always had the money in my account, so never missed a pay date.      2. Currently paying off a medical bill. I've been paying it off for the last 5 months, and I always make my payments about a week before they're due and always add an extra 75-100 bucks to it (I hear that helps and looks good). But my question, do medical payments show up because it is so personal?      3. I've only had one time where I ran out of money in my checking account. It wasn't for a bill or anything, just spent too much. This was about 3 years ago, and I'm curious if it hurts me, credit wise.      as for my car and cell phone, my parents bought my car cash and I paid them back with cash, and i'm currently on an "add a line" plan and give my mom the cash for it monthly, so those things aren't under my name.      4. I've recently started up car insurance and have that under my name, and that auto withdraws from my account as well, so I think that'll help, but not positive.      So I guess my main question is if any of this helps, or if I'm still completely unknown to the credit world.   thanks in advance

20090304234418AABeLje	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	I am 23, gay. My parents say I shouldn't go back to study. Any thoughts?	#THANKS FOR SPENDING A FEW MINUTES TO READ MY QUESTION. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP AND APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE ##      I am 23, male. I have been studied science in an Australian university for 1 year. My parents want me to be a biological scientist but I am not interested in science at all. I didn't do well and finaIly I droped out from the course :( . My university counsellor suggest me to go back to Hong Kong (my hometown) and discover my own interest before I go back to study in Australia. Back in Hong Kong, I am living with my parents and I share the rent with them. The rent is about US$ 900 per month. Dad, mum and I pay US$300 each. My 20-year-old younger sister lives with us as well.       I have come out to my friends in Australia but never come out to parents yet. My parents are very homophobic. I am afraid they'll find out and reject me. I face their bad words everyday becaue of my academic failure, I went back to my room and closed the door and cried. Then sister say I am not allowed to close my room's door. " You need to have your room door opened all the time, including when you are crying. What's the point of closing the d*mn door? Have you ever considered my feelings?" They say" Listen to *your sister, you loser" My parents also say " Why can't you get along with us well? If you can't get along with us well, it means you can't get along with your schoolmates and colleagues as well. You are a big loser !" My sister, who is studying to be a counsellor, says " Why are you so defensive about yourself? Why don't you compromise with My sister said , " You're so defensive about yourelf therefore no counsellor on Earth can help you. "       I also said , " I dropped out from science course because I have no interest in it at all. Mum, My dream is to be an successful accountant, not a scientist ."      Question 1) Which one do you think is better? Get my accounting degree in Australia or work full-time in Hong Kong ? " You are 23 year old already. " My mum said " If you study full-time in Australia for 3 more years , it mean you will lose 3 years of work experience. When you graduate with an accounting degree at the age of 26, no one will hire you again because you are 2 to 3 years older than an average univesity graduate. And you don't have much full-time job experience . You will not able to find a good job because employers tend to employ younger people." However, I really wanna go to Australia , do my favourite course and stay away from my homophobic parents . Will I be less competitive in the job market after 3 years ( because my graduate age is 26 , which is 2 to 3 years older than an average graduate ) ?      ##Advantages of going back to study in AUSTRALIA##      1)Away from homophobic parents , more freedom to    express my sexuality (e.g. Dating guys, develop   my own interest e,g, learn how    to drive and DJing ) ( I can't do this in HONG Kong because   my mum opposes me to learn    how to drive and DJing. She lost   temper to me because I enrol in   a driving and Club DJing course )   In addition , I can    receive mental   supporting from   gay-friendly friends   Homophobic parents   will be 8800 km away and won't be    able to gay-bash me       2) Better resume after graduation ( with a college degree!)      3) Able to work part-time between university semester   in Australia ( p.s. However, my mum say any job during    school holiday is USELESS.She says they are not long-term job   so that are USELESS, won't add color to my resume)      4) Able to apply Permanent residency in Australia after graduation ( IF I wanna keep staying away from homophobic parents after graduation)   Then I can keep working and staying with my cute boyfriend Then I plan to apply civil co-partnership with my boyfriend in Australia even my homophobic parent complain in Hong Kong         ###Disdavantages of going back to Australia:      1) My mum says I will be 26 years old   when graduation, which is 3-4 years older   than an average fresh graduate . My mum says   employers tend to hire younger job applicants. I will be a bit old to be hired .I will not able to find a good job even though I am a degree holder   Therefore, she says going to Australia to study is USELESS      2) Highest living cost in Australia while tudying      3) My mum says she is not sure I can graduate sucessfully een if I am self-confident         ###Advantage of staying in Hong Kong and work      1) Lower living standard comapred to Australia   2) Able to work full-time and study part-time ( However, my mum discourage me to do any kind of study if I stary in HK)   3) My mum says I wil be more compeitive if I choose to work full-time in the next several years even without a degree. She says working experience is MORE important than university degree      ###Disadvantages of staying in Hong Kong      1) Living with controlling, homophobic parents   ( unable to fully develop yourself, unable to learn Club DJing and driving as a hobby, definitely be gay-bashed and verbally abusesd all the time

OK I need to finance a car or van , I just got discharged from my Bankruptcy , I'am on Unemployment .I have $500.00 as a down payment , Iam looking for a vehicle price between $3000.00 and $4000.00.      On the "loan calculators" with 25% interest and depending on the vehicle price ($3000-$4000) . All the calculations come to under $100.00 a month , then add insurance for say $60.00.         What and where on the contract should I look for options with paying the car off , that are best for me.      I want to be able to pay the $100.00 a month payment as stated above , then when I find a job , I want to pay it off quicker.I do not want the extra payments I send in to just go towards the interest.      Or say if I continue to pay $100.00 a month , then just save extra cash to do a payoff.What would I have to ask and/or lookout for on the contract.Say if I have the payoff money , then could they say like I owe more because of the interest?      Can someone break it down for me in laymans terms , so I do not get ripped off.I'am trying to rebuild my credit not go back into debt.      And I NEED to get a car in order to get a job , all the jobs that I'am qualified for are in the suburbs.And I need a car to get out there.      Thanks

20090305003327AAFVstm	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Good faith deposit..earnest check question!?	My wife and I found a little home that we like and we really want to buy it.  Our agent has told us that providing a copy of an earnest check/deposit with our offer will greatly increase our odds of getting our offer accepted.      My question is this - Is $1,000 a good amount to write the check for?  AND will this money be deducted from what we will owe for our downpayment?  So for example, if our total downpayment is let's say $10,000 and we send them a copy of a $1,000 earnest check will this mean that we only have to come up with the remaining $9,000 for the downpayment or is this $1,000 earnest check in addition to the $10,000 downpayment we will need?      So can we essentially submit our offer with a $10,000 earnest check to show we are serious and once our offer is accepted we will have no downpayment to pay because the $10,000 earnest check covered our downpayment?

20090305012032AAGVUb3	Business & Finance;Credit	Fraud and Reporting to the Bank?	I recently found out that if there is Fraud on your account, you only have 60 days to report it. Although it states that if they failed to give you accurate information about your rights then you can hold them responsible.       But....they consider the reports for "Business Days of the Bank" Therefore if there was fraud in November and you take off the weekends and then account for December and then Christmas and New Years then can you subtract that and then state you had until that time less the weekends they were closed and the holidays which would give me the exact time of past 60 days to subtract the business days they were open and then it accounts back to November.      That would make it right then. Does anyone know this fact?

I think I've chosen a house with one of the many realtors who helped me. bad, of me, I know, but It's a buyer's market. They volunteered to help a little. I probably can not give cash, checks, or such? but how about restaurant gift certificates or a fuzzy fair trade scarf (value: $30.). I know it's not 5% of my house commission, will the realtor just groan & throw it in the trash disdainfully? or think to herself "gee, that's nice, it's the thought that counts..." ? I'd like to help everyone who helped me. but I think I can only choose one realtor in the end? The realtor (that I first  I started out with) did not return my calls when I started to briefly wonder about the lower priced bargain houses. (I had seen the "expensive" houses, but I needed to see a bargain house to be assured that I was getting the most value for my money with the "expensive" house choice. I needed perspective!)

I know that tO trade shares i need Dmat and Trading account so through which trading account(Best) i can trade   all BSE and NSE share?      2.) First of all i am planning to start with small investment like Rs 10,000/-   So iam Planning to buy small shares which are having value Less then RS 1/-.I am planning to    buy shares like 0.35 Paise ,0.50 paise ...  ,like these kind of shares,so can i buy these shares   through online ,i mean can i trade these kind of shares also.      3.) What are the online charges(Broker charges),and   FOr how much i have to pay, for eg : if I bought shares for Rs 5000/- and i sold those for 6000/- then i have to pay   for Rs 6000/- or for 11000 (5000+6000)       4.)From the day when i thought of investing in shares that day onwards i am looking    ICICI DIRECT.com website for the list of all shares and prices, but one day i found that one share name is missing which iam observing everyday,why it happened and basing on what conditions it occurs and i tried to see the price of the same share   in rediff.com i got a messsage that no data available.when these kind of situations we will face..?      5.)I observed some symbols just beside the share price what i understanded by those symbols is if there is an upward arrow then share price got increased if it is downward then the share price got decreased but some times i am seeing a symbol like " " and i searched for this symbol in rediff i found that this is equal to MF holdings,MF means Mutual Funds i think so, but why this symbol is coming by the side of the share price?what does it mean      6.)If i take any trading any account from any Broker they will provide me any software to see my share prices,or i need to get any other software from net      7.)Is there any free software so that i can download ,through which i can view very  latest share prices and sort according to the price and see the 52 weeks low price   last weeks low price and current price in serial columns and can add any other information basing on my own criteria? and tell me the best free software which you    are using.      8.)At what time i can buy and sell shares only at market times i.e: mornign 9:55 Am to eve 3:30 Pm from Monday to  Friday or i can buy and sell at any time      9.)how many shares of a same company i can buy at a time. is there any limitation   how can we know how many shares are free to buy i mean how many shares are there for a particular company to buy,and how many we can buy.          10.) How the broker will know what type of trade iam going to do (Intra Day or Inter Day)   I need to Inform him before.Suppose i informed him as Intra day and can i keep those shares and can i tell that iam switching into Inter day what is the procedure?Please tell me in detail...i dont know any thing about it.         11.)Right now iam seeing in ICICI DIRECT.com and Rediff.com for the Prices, in both sites the prices are not matching. iam confused.Tell me one best site or any best alternative way to see  the very latest and current share prices of all types and and of all range.      Is my idea is good to buy small shares Please advise me.   Please respond to all these questions I will be very Thank full to you.Thank you Thank you Thank you very much.
