20090202100835AAGgMqR	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What are good romance and mystery books you'd recommend?	I'm 18 years old and I love reading. I finish books within a day when I'm really into it. Some of my favorite genres are romance, mystery, and books that have to do with people around my age or above. At the book store there are to many books to choose from. I'm a good reader and I like challenging books. I've read books like Pride and Prejudice. Do you have any book recommendations?
20090202101308AAS7tWy	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Are fiction editors turned off by undergrad students/teenagers submitting to their lit mag?	Would they roll their eyes if I mentioned I'd been published in Teen Ink?  I always include the fact that I'm an undergrad in my cover letter to fiction editors (and when I was in high school mentioned that I was in high school).  Do serious fiction editors at literary magazines dislike submissions from young people?  Does mentioning my young age hurt my chances of being published?  Or, conversely, could it ever help?  Would love to hear anyone's thoughts.  Thanks!

20090202100945AAFCd3D	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do people see why Edward Cullen is so protective of Bella?	I know a lot of people have been making comments about how abusive Edward is with his over protectiveness and jealousy. But I have noticed something and maybe I am reading too much into it. But from reading what has been leaked from Midnight Sun I understand him better.  He is a vampire and there emotions are very different to humans. When they feel something they feel it 100 times more then humans do. I think that people that accuse him of being too over-protective and jealous need to make allowance for that fact. Don't get me wrong I am defiantly not saying that this is an ideal relationship. But for being a fictional book I am just stating that the way he treats Bella makes a lot better sense now. He believes in his mind that humans can die instantly at any moment and he is fighting to keep her alive. Then there is also the Jacob thing. He did not mind her seeing him after he noticed that the wolves were safe enough for her to be around. He let her choose what she wanted to do. If anything domestic violence is not something that would result in this kind of relationship. He let her choose for herself and told her that it was up to her. Just my opinion!
20090202101542AAdkR9p	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	For all young adults out there??boys and girls....?	1-Magial equations             If you're excpecting to read another dump story of pyrokinetic heroes,evil ,dueling wizards,and deadly monsters,then I think you've chosen the wrong book.Our story begins in a quiet british street,where victor Crow along with his fairly odd parents lived in a small appartement set in a broad red bricked building.But I don't like to speak of victor crow so casually,for his role in this story is far more bigger than any one would excpect.Victor Crow was 7 years old,when he first found out that he can do math so spontaneously,as a newly married lady would cook for husband,after extensive lessons with her mother.But victor's talent in solving complex,equations,and even creating new ones was undoubtley miraculous.            Since the age of 5 Victor's father,elliot crow,provide victor with a huge amount of books,and especially math books.elliot was keen on teaching his son reading since early age,but he wasn't expecting his son to show any evident interest or even grasping to what he offered from long sessions of solving quadrantial,and calculus equations.Blowing away his father's expetations,victor showed utter genius,and profound understanding to the most complex concepts in those math books.             But at the night of his 9th birthday utterly weird things happened .while lounging on the living room sofa  solving an equation in his late math  homework,victor felt a surge of fear,mingled with excitement run through his body,And  a moment later the equation glittered with green light on the the pale white page of the copybook ,and everything all around him from the couch's red pillows to the TV began floating high up  in the air.Nothing happened,for ten seconds, until Elliot crow,scuttled into the living room with his long Victorian coat on,he held the copybook from victor's hand and shut it straight cover facing cover,Elliot looked aound him,and everything banged back to the ground.He smiled wryily at victor,who was motionless on the sofa."better you drink some water before answering any math equations",he took out a glass bottle of water from his inner chest pocket,and handed it  to victor.Victor gulped up the bottle,and gazed back at his father with revulsion "ughh,this not water,it tastes very salty".A transparent liquid with a tinge of red stirred in the bottle,as victor handed it back to his father.Elliot vanished away,prancing out of the living room.But beside the strange taste of water.Victor seemd to forget the flying living room,he was gazing into the ceiling.It was the first time his father smiled to him,it was the first time he truly spoke to him without scolding him for no obvious reason.         But the biggest incident of all took place in school.At that time victor was 14.He usually ambled through the iron gates of his school,with a frowning face and,stiff ,fast strides.He held under his armpit a closed notebook,in which he solved his math equations.,victor sat down at the far left corner of the class,a position that never allowed him a good view of the black board,but he never cared for what was written on it.Mr.brown came in,with a short blonde girl beside him cupping the long tower of copybooks in her hands.She laid them down on the teacher's desk,and waited for Mr brown to allow her to return back to her seat."you can go kitty"the young girl smiled and walked back to her desk.Mr brown sat down cross legged on his chair that was facing the middle of the board,and took off from his battered leather bag the marks file         "victor crow" he began"0 out of 20"      Mr.brown sprang up pushing back his seat with the back of his knees,and glared at victor"how marvelous,how marvelous mr crow"      But victor was swimming in a sea all of his own,he couldn't even hear Brown's mocking remark.He laid the notebook  open on his legs,dipped his head under the desk,and kept on scribbling down endless lines of numbers.      "mr crow,stand up"said mr brown standing right infront of victor's desk.      Vicotor gave no reply,motionless in his wooden seat.      "mr crow stand up"brown nearly shrieked breaking into a thiner voice out of anger      Victor shuddered,and stood up,poking the notebook under the desk.      "yes mr brown"      "you got 0 out of 20 in the geography exam.happy aren't you"      "no sir"      "then what the heck are you doing under the desk??"      "nothing sir,a late h-w"      "liar"      "no sir"      "you were answering your god damned math equations,I saw you and here they're you"      Mr brown pushed victor down on the desk,poked a hand between victor's open legs and wheedled out the red notebook.      "here it is,you think yourself a genius ha??"Mr brown was leafing through the endless pages filled up with numbers"you think yourself great,but let me tell you little fellow you're nothing,here me,nothing.A weirdo who thinks that he can impress some girls with meaningless equations..you'reâ€¦."      Mr brown stopped,peering at the open page.It was filled up with sideways equations,one of them was spa

I looking for books related to american wars for example revolutionary war, civil war, ww1,ww2. My english teacher forces his students to read, analyze, write essays and get tested on his boring and out dated books about america history. He want the books that we read in his class to connect to other classes. His intentions are good but he needs to choose better books and give kids more options. Please recommend books are exciting, will appeal to kids age 12-14 and appropriate for class. Can you also recommend books not relating to war but in the same time period. Any good books related to physical science are also helpful.
20090202103248AA4nTBr	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you do with books that you have finished reading?	Do you put them on the bookshelf to read again one day?    Sell them on ebay?    Give them to friends and family ?    Or donate them to a charity/public library?          Me, I do the first one and then after a year or two I do the fourth, I can't be bothered with trying to negotiate a decent price with second hand books store owners. Especially when they say..."I'm not looking to buy right now" and "I can only give you 30p per book" and "Oooh I've got a lot of copies of this one." I'd rather give the books to charity and feel good about myself.

20090202102349AAkyvc5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	I'm a dual enrollment student and I just started my first writing class. We have to write a paragraph about our favorite childhood place. Here's mine=]                         The dark, mysterious woods behind my house is a place that was very important in my childhood.My sister and I would pretend to see different creatures such as trolls, dragons, elves, goblins, and so many other mythical beings, back there. Our imaginations would run wild and it seemed so real to us. I remember telling all of our friends to meet us in Mythsapia, which was what we called the woods, to fight monsters. If we didn't, they would somehow make it out of the woods and destroy the world! When we were in Mythsapia it was so serious. No playing around. It wasn't a game to us. We would go on little adventures everyday. As soon as we got off the school bus, We would run home, change out of our school clothes, do our chores, and then run off to the magical world of Mythsapia. One specific adventure that I remember, is trying to stop the Ogre, who was the evil ruler of the land. He made all of the abnormalities miserable. With the help of the good creatures, My friends and I finally defeated the unjust Ogre. I still go to Mythsapia often, but it's just not the same anymore. The magic is gone. I will never forget the exciting times that my friends and I had in Mythsapia, my favorite childhood place.

Trovo la figura del vampiro molto affascinante, e infatti lego con piacere romanzi sul tema e non mi perdo un film. Ovviamente spesso sono prodotti poco curati, e puntualmente mi pento :) Voi avete libri o film vampireschi che vi piacciono? Siete piÃ¹ per Anne Rice e i vampiri romantici o quelli piÃ¹ gotici e tradizionali? Io ho appena finito "Hanno sete" di McCammon, e lÃ¬ i vampiri sono cattivi ;)

20061015174605AA4ZowY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like this poem?........Sorry I couldn't find another category that fit this better. =(?	I see you through Campfire eyes....      I see your hair glowing in the light,   Your skin radiating truth   Your eyes ready to give way,   to the man I hope to see one day...      Your hands cuddle through the fire   Hoping to catch a spark of golden warmth      I see the young face   Look up, towards the stars   And I hear your voice   With a tear caught in your throat   "You think they'll be watching over us?"      In the Campfire light, I see the man I once thought    Perfect   And yet, when I see those beautiful flaws   I know, I don't need a perfect boy to show me   the road to love      As you sit here, with the fire blazing before us   I talk to your thoughts,   And chant to them....soothing songs,   I tell them not to be afraid,   Because we've all made mistakes...
