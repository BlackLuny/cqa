761d2c28e82008af9cda2d3951975912aa	I personally think the controller idea is a really bad one for First Person Shooters.  In your options, I suggest you turn your mouse sensitivity up from the default setting.  Not necessarily all the way, but I do mine about 2/3 up the meter.  You'll be able to sweep around faster.      If nothing else, you can be one of the people that gets really good at shooting your own grenades with the gravity gun, or if all else fails, become one of the really annoying crowbar people.  I think the gravity gun is one of the best things there is because you don't always have to have the best aim when you're shooting a metal table at a corner of a room with 3 people in it.    Also, weapons make a big difference.  It gets mind fryingly frustrating when you're getting constantly wasted because people keep killing you when you've only got that default sub-machine gun.  Switch straight to the combine pulse rifle whenever you pick it up and run to the nearest spawn point for a good weapon when you respawn.  If you're running through some area with a lot of debris, use that quick switch to gravity gun button to whip it out and huck something at someone and then switch back to your weapon.    (also, it's more of a side note, but since you mentioned it, my configuration is:  WASD - movement  shift - jump  ctrl - duck  space - sprint  F - use  E - reload  Q - flashlight  G - gravity gun    I find that having shift and ctrl as jump and duck works well with the pinky being over there, but just do whatever is egonomically satisfying for you.)|`|96gn2A0raa	LOl i feel your pain  Just buy a controller for your pc.

Ed esiste the sims 2 che  un gioco bello bello ed  graficamente ben fatto, inoltre puoi rinnovare sempre tutti gli oggetti presenti e non solo, scaricandoli da siti appositi.  Entrambi i giochi hanno circa 8 espansioni per uno che aggiungono cose nuove al gioco base, ma che non possono essere istallate senza quest'ultimo perch sono appunto ESPANSIONI.

eNHGiEvGaa	Since you know the various hands, I'll give you the basics.  I'll assume you're playing Texas Hold'em:    You get 2 cards down (no one can see 'em but you).    -Betting round 1    Three face up cards in the middle.  This FLOP belongs to everyone.    -Betting round 2    Another face up card in middle.  This TURN belongs to everyone.    -Betting round 3    Another face up card in middle.  This RIVER belongs to everyone.    -Betting round 4    If more than one player remains, showdown the hands.  Best hand takes the pot.    The "best hand" is the best five card poker hand, made from any combination of the cards on the board and the two in your hand.  You can use both of your cards, just one of them, or neither of them and just play the board.  The *only* thing that matters is who has the best five card hand, and if they have the same five card hand split the pot.    What happens in a betting round?  Players have an option to check/call or bet/raise when it's their turn to act during the betting round, or they can "fold" which means they surrender their hand and give up any chance to win the pot.  Betting goes around the table until one of two things happens.  Sometimes one player makes a bet or raise that everyone else folds to, in which case they win the pot uncontested and do not show their hand.  Otherwise, every player with a live hand must put in exactly the same amount of money, equalizing the bet.  A "call" means putting in the same amount of the previous bet, thereby equalizing.  A "check" is the same, except you're "equalizing" at zero... that is, no one has chosen to bet on this round yet.  A "bet" or "raise" is when you decide to put more money into the pot than anyone else has so far.  That means the other players are now compelled to fold or at least call your bet to keep playing.  Technically a "bet" is when you're the first person to put money in the pot in this round, and a "raise" is when you increase the amount of the bet, after at least one other bettor.    That's pretty much it.  Limit poker sets a specific amount that you're allowed to bet or raise in a round.  So $4/$8 allows bets or raises of $4 in the first two betting rounds, and $8 in the later rounds.  No Limit allows you to bet any amount up to what you have on the table, at any time.    The rank of hands are:  No Pair, Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush.|`|xDFR5SsGaa	there are different poker variations, with different play rules, but the basic hand ranking will still apply. see here for a step by step guide on how to play any poker variation  http://www.gamblenext.com/poker-variatio...  make sure you practice online with free chips before going in with real money  GL|`|LQKwLjegaa	sure, this is the address of a very good explained guide:    http://www.onlinecasinoselite.com/poker....|`|dRaak4fUaa	Check out http://www.pokerposted.com for everything you need to know about poker|`|AA11001595	Play for free at http://wsopfreerolls.com    You'll get the hang of it.

agPKOwNSaa	taps or socialables!|`|vAM1GhBiaa	Beer Pong! Really fun!|`|hUdiFUaCaa	High or Low. All you need is a deck of cards and video camera to tape the fun.|`|N59YQtRFaa	The game "Asshole"...look it up. Its mostly a beer drinking game though...cause otherwise you will just get REALLY F'd up. Wait...unless that's what you're looking for. Hahaha...have fun & be safe.|`|8ijFfaBBaa	A simple spirit game is "quarters". I typically play with vodka. You sit across the table with a friend and put a shot glass (with the alcohol inside) in the middle of the table. The object is to bounce a quarter off the table (one time) and have it land in the shot glass. If you make the shot, the opponent drinks the shot. The game ends when either a score limit is reached, or one of you can no longer stand...or drink. This game gets you drunk pretty fast, so it's best to set a limit for each game (like 5 shots or so).    For beer, there's the classic Beer Pong. You get a long table (Ping Pong table preferred) and arrange each side of the table with a pyramid of 6 cups filled with beer. 3 beers should fill the 6 cups (12 total). Next you need 2 Ping Pong balls. You get into two teams of two players and stand at each side of the table. The opening shot is called an "eye-to-eye". You (or your partner) and an opponent stand on opposite sides of the table and look into each others eyes. At the same time you throw your balls and try to make them in an opponent's cup. The one who makes it first wins (if both players make it or miss it, you switch throwers until a shot is made). Next the game starts. The team who wins the "eye-to-eye" gets to throw first. Assuming your team wins the "eye-to-eye", you and your partner each take a shot at the opponents cups and try to make a ball in. You can shoot at the same time, or one after the other. Whatever cup you make a ball in, the opponent must drink. You can also bounce a ball into the opponents cup. Making a bounce forces the opponent to drink 2 cups instead of one. But if a ball is bounced off the table, the opponent may attempt to stop the ball after the bounce, either by catching it, or swatting it away. There are different rules depending on the house, but if you're playing in your own house you can make up your own rules. Once one team has downed all the booze on their side, they lose. Where I usually play, the penalty of a loss is downing all of the winning teams remaining beer as well.    Since wine is a fairly sophisticated beverage, I don't think there are any drinking games for it. But hey, you can just make one up.    Happy drinking!|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	beer pong...lol...

h2i7VIWLaa	The teacups is always a kicker, I'm 14 and I still enjoy it. Don't spin too fast though, don't want her to get scared    If she isn't afraid of heights, California Adventure I believe has a really tall ferris wheel    As for eating, I enjoyed the French market. Soup in a bread bowl and other things there would be good for a young one. Yummy too!    If your daughter isn't afraid of the dark or loud sounds, Pirates of Caribbean or Haunted Mansion are too good ones.     Also, go to Buzz Light Year, all little kids love that one, and I don't know if the Toy Story Carnival is out yet, though it might be in California adventure    Have her take pictures with Disney characters. Kids always love getting to meet their favorite characters. But if she is scared, move on to another ride, because I know from experience they'll cry.    Go to gift shops, get her little gifts (overpriced by the way, I suggest while going to the Ferris Wheel to get some stuffed animals from the Carnival, if your good its cheaper than the toys you buy)    Have Fun!|`|pSryQTckaa	You MUST meet The Mad Hatter and Alice. They are a trip! Haha. Also, you should ride the Mattahorn!|`|U1xvObr4aa	Well I haven't been there in a while but I've done a lot of studying since I'm going in April as well.    The Alice in Wonderland ride is just a moving car that rides thru different scenes. She would love it especially if you watch the movie before your trip. There are no drops, but it is dark in there so if she is afraid of the dark it might be a little scary. The Peter Pan ride is the same thing. Your in the pirate ships and it "flies" thru the different scenes of the story.    The Finding Nemo Submarine should be cute if she is not afraid of enclosed spaces. There is also the interactive show with Crush from Finding Nemo. You can talk to him and he talks back!    Almost all of Toontown is designed for smaller children. There are walk thru houses of Mickey and the other characters and last time I went there was even a mini-coaster.    I believe California Adventure also has an area more designed for smaller children as well. I think it has some Disney Princess themed things, like an Ariel ride.|`|CKpPpK0saa	dumbo is the funnest ride for your two year old. it will bring a smile to her face.    go on the fantasyland rides for example peter pan, snow white, etc.    small world is cute but make sure she won't cry because it is really loud.    you can contact me at disneylandlover110@yahoo.com and ask me anything about disneyland. i will answer ASAP.|`|ieDMVcKtaa	Kick Donald Duck in the balls - I did and it was awesome!

154dzJ1Faa	boy, it's a good thing it's not addictive!  LOL    Yes, stop.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	I suggest at least slowing down. My friend started out doing it very lightly, and progressed to doing it all the time, and as moved on to worst sh*t needless to say we aren't friends anymore because I didn't want to get stoned all the time. In fact I found it horribly boring and a waste of time.|`|vDIBCj1vaa	um... yeah.. you should stop... and try to get help from friends who care :)|`|8ijFfaBBaa	I've had my share of weed smoking, but it never appealed that much to me. I did have a phase in my sophmore year of high school where I would get stoned every Friday night, but that was about it. After a while I got tired of being lazy. All my friends and I would do is get so stoned we could only eat snacks and watch T.V. The last time I smoked was New Years, and before that September. A lot of my friends get stoned daily, or hourly. I just don't see the appeal of it.   Just try to be rational and think of it's affects on you and people around you. I think weed smoking is fine. If you can smoke and still stay level-headed and fine, then there's not really a problem. It's just not something that should control any of your life. I still smoke from time to time, but it just doesn't appeal to me much, especially when trying to find a job.  My advice to you is to just pull back on it a bit or maybe try to quit for a week. See if you can make it one week, just to see how much you "need" it. Hmm...I don't know what else to tell you, but if you want to talk, feel free to email me. I'm open and I can talk it out with you.     good luck =]|`|VT6yclsmaa	umm first of all there all bad smoking give u lung cancer trust me u die in pain and it can cause death painfull death and each ciga takes 7 years to disgest and also to stop smoking use nicareat something like that u stick it in ur arm and Yea makes u stop smoking i don't know how to spell tho lol but yea another thing go eat sun flower seeds lol XD plaese don't smoke no weeds no smoke plaese for your own safety|`|suLTN10laa	Well...Ultimately it is your choice.  I used to do it about twice a day.  Then I realized it really didn't do all that much for me except to even me out, and like you said, cost me lots of money and make me lazy.  I never was in a bad mood, but my fiance does (maybe it's just men who this happens to?)  (That wasn't a bad joke, I really wonder!!)  :)  ANYWAY-  What I did was take the $50.00/week I spent on it, and put it towards something I really wanted (xbox360) and got it!  I just personally felt like I was getting too mature to be doing it anymore and thinking about a family, etc...  Good Luck, what ever you choose, in the mean time, smoke one for me while you ponder the idea...  ;)|`|6X8a9yCmaa	Slow down on the weed eat right and excercise to get your energy back. Eventually you'll forget about weed
wyvSAhtZaa	You press F10 to take a snapshot. To take a video, press F11.    You just go to the menu while in the game, and it gives you keyboard commands.    It's nothing worth explaining. It's just "press F10". It should be at the very top, central area of your keyboard.
GyiW82Kqaa	I think it's because you can capture a moment in time... Before video cameras, people only had photo cameras to record special events and remember loved ones. It's being able to look at a photo and relive the memories attached to it. Almost like being there again..    Now there is all sorts of software available to use at home. The programs give the photographer a new outlet to be creative in their editing. Anyone can be a "professional" with practice!|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	I really could careless about photography|`|OsH2JR9oaa	It's the internet. More people are blogging and they use pictures to describe their posts. Also, photography is an art form that doesn't require any sort of drawing talent or much creativity. You'll notice how much art has changed over the period that cameras were first introduced to the world. This is because portraits were the only way we could capture a person, or a scene in a moment in time. Then the camera came and changed all that. It made a lot of professional artists nervous in their day, and prompted new art forms to catch the eyes of the public.|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	I luv taking pictures with my phone!!!|`|MlgxVr0saa	when digital camera's became so easy to use and people could use editors to make themselves pretty...      a friend of mine is a photographer and his business goes down a little every year cause people are making picture all their own..|`|9VaWal2Daa	Defintely internet played a huge role........chatting was fun,.........but people wanted to SEE who they were talking to........and digital photograpghy just EXPLODED.     I've been a photographer from wayyyyyyyy back.........still use my Canon Photura, that I got in Japan, back in 1992.....and that thing is like a TANK.   I've dropped it, slammed it, even dropped it in WATER once......and it STILL takes the BEST pictures of ANY camera I've ever owned.     I mean, this thing is WAR TOUGH, and has the battle scars to prove it!    But, ya see these MICRO CELL PHONES now, capable of shooting  pictures anywhere, and then instantly uploading them to your computer to send around the world in a flash.......    wow........    my trusty Photura can't do THAT!!!!!!    Yeah, I bring in my film to get developed, and they are like......."real film? " .......where did you get this?     Kodak is going under........it's sad......and what's sadder, the new "kewl" is god awful photography, like you see on MySpace, and Facebook where people post pictures of their eyeballs or whatnot, for an avatar....or some awkward angle......    or , really, some truly unflattering photo........but, I guess the thrill is....they posted it THEMSELF!   For free.     soooooo, my and my Photura, will just click off into the sunset, the old dinosaurs we are.............but I will get a damn NICE shot of that sunset.......as I go!    I will NEVER give up my Photura!|`|oDb093Qsaa	ya... lots of ppl like to take pics just 4 fun... and its also cool just takn random pics i think.. but i don't really count it as a hobby...|`|s7PxM001aa	I love how the small beautiful things we do not see in this world gets put and magnified onto a photo|`|2NzCS7ALaa	I think myspace had a big influence on it!

Remember when you capture the photo of your 1st son?  Remember the photo of your mom and dad when they were young?  Remember when that tourist asked you to take pictures of him and his family?  Remember that when your photo did not turn quite like the way that you want, and you tried to recapture the photo?    Photography is something that everyone can enjoy unlike other hobbies. Capturing moments of your life using modern video camera is nothing like  the old SLR camera. It may be a still picture, the essence is  exactly like the day you took that picture.

As for 2009, if past experience is any indicator, I would guess that Valve will announce that they will release it in Q2 of 2009 and it will get pushed back over and over until it finally comes out Nov. 2010.    That's not based on anything at all, so don't quote me. I'm just saying everything gets postponed for really long periods of time.|`|OLtksjY5aa	The Episode three is being made alright, and I think It'll be released for the 360 and PC, date of release?

You can buy sewing cabinets, but they can run several hundred to a few thousand dollars and that does not include a sewing machine.    http://www.sewingmachinecabinets.com/arr...    Low cost and good quality - you will have to visit sewing machine dealers and let them help you find what you are looking for.  They also have lessons and classes.    If you are comfortable with teaching yourself, and do not require dealer support, you could start with trying out a Kenmore.    Look for a machine that does an easy, but quality buttonhole and blindhem stitch.

While new is nice, features aren't all they're thought to be, especially on the bottom line machines.  And there are often some workarounds for simpler machines to accomplish the same jobs as newer ones.  For instance, a Greist buttonhole attachment often makes better quality buttonholes than most inexpensive "fancy" machines.    I'd suggest that instead of looking at sewing machines, if either of you do much sewing, you consider a serger instead.  They've got a fairly steep learning curve at first (which is why I'd send you to good dealers to try sergers out before purchase), but produce results that are difficult  or much slower to do with a sewing machine.  And yes, I'm addicted to mine...   It's so nice to be able to knock out a pair of pants and a t-shirt in an hour or so, professionally finished.  http://missourifamilies.org/features/mat...    If you think you might be interested, check your local library for books on sergers.  Particularly good ones are ABCs of Serging, Sewing with an Overlock, Ultimate Serger Answer Guide, Chris James' book (Complete Serger Book, I think), Serger Secrets.... there are also video and DVD basic serger courses you might want to view before going shopping.

BZBEmaAwaa	The original Halo came out as a bundle with the original XBox. Being the first game people owned, they would have a tendency to play it. It's safe to say Halo kept the original XBox alive. It had remarkable AI at the time and XBox parties were a blast when you hooked several of them together to play with your friends. It gradually became bigger and bigger.    If you have the original XBox, you should buy Halo 2. People say the storyline sucks due to it having a cliffhanger but hey, it's just a game. Most people play it with their friends anyway.|`|DTlFaJkaaa	Couldn't tell you the answer, I think it's utter garbage.|`|YdD200a6aa	Halo was a one-of-a-kind game when it first came out in the late 90's.

maLzjlgXaa	If it happens to all of your games, then the problem might be your Xbox's GPU (graphics), in which case you will need to send in your machine to Microsoft and pay the fee if you aren't under warranty anymore. Play some more and if it happens again in the same spot, then the problem is with the game disc itself (for that you could skip down to the last paragraph). If it only happens to Fallout 3 in different spots, then read ahead...    Here are a few things to try (I am assuming you have a hard drive):  To perform the function, access 'memory' in the system blade, and then highlight the hard drive. Now press Y for options. Then press: X, X, LB, RB, X, X. The following message should appear: "Do you want to perform maintenance on your Xbox 360 storage devices?" Choose yes and you are done.    Start up your game and it should start downloading updates for the game. Don't interrupt these updates and let them completely finish.  All of this may help you with your problem.    You may also get the freezing problem from either bloated game saves, or just too many saves. This is especially true if the auto-save feature is on. When you are at the main menu, go to Load Game and start deleting auto-saves and other saved games you don't use anymore. Delete as many as you can or are comfortable with. Now try your game.    When you are playing your game, it may be wise to start a new save file if you have been overwriting your save over and over again. Press Start and choose Save. Choose to start a new save and delete your previous save.    If all of these remedies don't work, perhaps your game disc is damaged or scratched, in which case you need to either use a disc repairing machine or take it somewhere where that service is offered.|`|YdD200a6aa	Does this happen often?    It may just be a one-time thing... usually a problem with the Xbox 360's video card. It has happened to me twice.. so it's nothing new. The only advice I can provide to prevent losing data from this is to save often.|`|yicKRgiKaa	Judging by your name I will assume you bought this for the XboX360.     Unfortunately, and yet fortunately, this hasnt only happened to you. It has also happened to me and a friend of mine- and in a total of about 160+ hours on the game, it only froze on me twice.    There was a patch that was released recently, that was supposed to fix alot of glitches that occurred in the game, this is not one of those things that were fixed. (My friend experienced it after he downloaded the patch)    I am sure that since this seems to be happening to alot of people, they will eventually come out with some sort of patch for it. (Unfortunately for them they have LOTS of glitches to work out!)|`|dKz9no3waa	Its happened to me a few times too. There are several things you can do though that may help.  1) Download the game to your hard drive. It sometimes works.  2) Try this as a last resort.... Clear your memory cache. (Look up online cuz i dont remember how. Its easy although it erases all updates you have with other games, but you can update your games again).  3) Just turn the game off and try again in a couple hours.  4) This combined with option 3 worked for me. Just try taking a different approach to what makes it freeze. One time i killed a robot in VATS...freeze. I tried it again...freeze. the next time i tried i killed it without VATS and used a different weapon. All better.     Its basically a kink in the game that was missed. Im sure there will be a downloadable patch soon since a lot of people are having this problem. Good luck!

l6lh6fT8aa	The only way I can think of to turn a Planeswalker into a creature would be to use Mycosynth Lattice to make it an artifact, then use March of the Machines to make it a creature, then use a spell (there are plenty of these) that copies abilities.    Anyway, no. The creature with the copied ability would not be able to use the ability indefinitely. First off, it would have to be a Planeswalker to use the ability at all - so if it is copying just the ability and not the card type, then it will not be able to use it.    If it is a Planeswalker Creature Artifact - [creature type], then it can use the ability...    ...but it is also dead. A Planeswalker with no loyalty counters is dead, dead, dead. There's no chance to use the ability.|`|9ECwMzZXaa	If you somehow with some card with some pro abilities (or cheating) manage to get a creature to copy a planeswalker's abilities, that creature still can't infinitely use the Plaineswalkers abilities because the abilities need loyalty counters to be activated.    To activate some of the Planeswalker's abilities, you need to pay loyalty counters. A creature at the beginning doesn't have loyalty counters, so the only ones you can use are abilities that give you loyalty counters first. Don't forget the once per turn rule as well.    BUT, i highly doubt managing to get a creature to copy a planeswalker's abilities is possible. It would be too cheap, unbalanced, and the rules have not yet defined everything to do with it yet.|`|X9kNbpnQaa	Although this is no card that can do this yet, theoretically I don't think there would be a problem with it. The rules for Loyalty counters says they are only for Planeswalkers, but I think that's just because there's nothing to give loyalty counters to other cards. The Planeswalkers' abilities seem to be built in to the card type.     However, I SERIOUSLY doubt they will ever allow your scenario to happen. If they do print a card that let Planeswalkers become creatures, you can bet that they'll errata the rules so that you can't take advantage of it (it'd be completely unfair).
N6TnQso8aa	it depends on what your looking for in a console     xbox 360 focuses on gaming nothing else and has a vast selection of games to choose from and seems to run at the cheapest price for everything and though the online may not be free it offers one of the best out of the 3 main consoles it also has around the same graphics as the ps3 (depending on your tv and their settings)    ps3 is more spread out on being more of a computer then a console but its graphics can get rather stunning on the right set up but it runs at the highest price for everything so it really depends on what your looking for    if you want something cheap that will last long and stay up to date xbox360 is for you    if you want something with a large selection of games and game types 360 has that too where ps3 is more of the shooting type of games then the wii is set for family friendly games|`|dKz9no3waa	The new Jasper Xbox is out which is very good for you.

If not, consider saving up and waiting (for a long time) for the highly-anticipated PS3 releases. (a-la Final Fantasy 13, Killzone 2, etc)|`|ESCALUjPaa	I think it would be a good purchase.    The xbox 360 has the widest variety of games available for the current console generation.    Xbox live by far, delivers the best console based online gaming experience.

I think the above reasons would be enough to justify the purchase.|`|EWz11Qhbaa	Simple answer.. YES!  All these people complain about the Red Rings and it will break, in about a year and a half.

N6TnQso8aa	if you have windows vista it will backup the files it finds important so if u do make changes it keeps a copy of them i was having the same problem with halo when i would mod, the normal map would cross over with the modded map causing an exception error making me not able to play at all so if you do have vista go into the folder where the map is kept and up towards file should be a folder image click on that and it should show the copies and u can delete or replace them and it should fix it

Dso7k3sjaa	hmmm, have you given any thought to just simply uninstalling and reinstalling your game?  I don't normally recommend that cause usually there really is a fix, but in your case I think that might actually be the only thing you can do to try to fix it.  Sorry.  I do have the phone number to EA's Sims 2 Technical Help people that I'll post here, but I'm afraid that I can't think of anything to tell you to try.    1-866-543-5435 within the US. If calling internationally dial 650-628-4306.    Hopefully they can help you.

Are you just trying to get your parents lock off?|`|nr9mD871aa	You cant turn that stuff off man. It sucks, but I hacked my parents email so I have full control, and I set it so that I have a lot of access.

b3tjS3yyaa	Hi , Nintendo games are rip off to be honest. I used to purchase games for my kids every so and then. I just couldnt bare with it any longer, as each game cost is so expensive. My children usually got bored with the games within a week or so.     Fortunately, I become aware of and purchased a storage device for the Nintendo DS, known as R4DS card. Now I am able to download Nintendo DS games from the internet (FREE), load it onto this storage unit and play it on my Nintendo DS. Its absoulately no difference between the download game and the ones yuo purchased from major retail vendor such as GameStop or BestBuy etc. Saved me a lot of $$$ and my children are extremely satisfied. They now download new games almost weekly now.     Oh! You can also play movies and music on your Nintendo DS too, just by using this storage unit.    Here is what I am talking about, have a look;  http://wiosha.notlong.com|`|k3cmetWRaa	Yes.    If you are asking if you can take.DS games from your PC and copy them to your DS this is also possible.    To do this all you need is a MicroSD card, and a CycloDS flashcard.    You use a USB adapter to copy the roms to the flash card then put the flashcard into your DS.    Then you'll never have to pay for another DS game again.|`|ZdF1hx70aa	Yes|`|kRAvXMLHaa	Yes you can
R7x0qIqyaa	Depends who you are selling it to.  If the person is desperate enough, this may come up to about 100$ or so.  But people would rather buy money than an account.  That's how it was back when I played, 2 years ago.  Sold 1 mil ea for 15 $ at the library.
j9BiWbIvaa	To downgrade your PSP to custom firmware you must    1) First format your memory stick (Whether your PSP is a slim or a fat). [Warning: Formatting your Memory stick will delete EVERYTHING on the Memory stick. I recommend that you backup all of your files by copying them to your computer. You can put everything back later]    a. To format your memory stick, just plug your PSP into the computer using the USB cable.  b. Click My Computer  c. Right-click your PSP. (On the computer, you will see it as a removable disk. On my computer, its called Removable Disk (H:) However, yours may be different)  d. Scroll down and click format  e. Make sure you select : File system: FAT32  f. Click Format.  2) Now your memory stick should be cleared of all its files.  a. Keeping your PSP plugged into the computer, Click my Computer.  b. Open to your PSP. (Now you should see nothing, since you formatted it.)  c. Now, create a new folder and name it PSP. [Without the quotes and all capital letters]  d. Now double click PSP and create a new folder inside of PSP. Name it GAME [Without the quote and all capital letters. It is GAME. Do not name it GAMES. There is no S.]  e. Now download this file:    http://rapidshare.com/files/96630083/pan...    To extract this file, you will need a program like WinRAR. If you dont already have it, download it from     http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm    f. Now once you downloaded it, Extract the folder onto the desktop. The folder is called PAN3XX_R3.  g. Once you have the folder, move this folder into the GAME Folder you created a few minutes ago.  h. Now download this file:    http://rapidshare.com/files/96635073/150...  http://rapidshare.com/files/96632174/340...  http://rapidshare.com/files/96636306/371...  http://rapidshare.com/files/96638006/380...  http://rapidshare.com/files/195156516/UP...      i. Now place all of these files into the root of your PSP. That just means to place all the files into your PSP. Do not put them into the PSP file. Do not put them into the GAME folder. Just put them into the PSP.  j. Now, disconnect your PSP from the computer.  k. Go into the GAMES underneath the PSP menu and click memory stick. You should see a program called PANDORA INSTALLER  l. Launch the program  m. Ignore all the weird messages and just find your way to the main menu.  n. Go down to Install a DDCv7 MagicStick (For Fat + Slim) and click it  o. After it finishes installing, go back to the main menu and go down to battery options.  p. Click it and chose to make battery Pandora  q. After that is complete you can quit.  r. VOW-LAH! You have a magic memory stick and a Pandora battery.  s. Now, take out the battery from the back of your PSP.   t. While holding down the Down-arrow button, carefully put the Battery back into the PSP.  u. Once the PSP turns on, you should be on a screen where you can downgrade your PSP.  v. Install 4.01 M33 Firmware.  w. Now you have custom firmware. Congrats.   x. Wanna download games and applications? I suggest     www.PSPISO.com  Source(s):  http://www.dark-alex.org/    http://www.psp-spot.com/forums/index.php...|`|JnuU4c5raa	If you already have a pandora battery, then just search how to make a "magic memory stick" there are ways to do it with a computer only.|`|s7DtIxXhaa	Check the FAQ at http://pandorabuys.notlong.com

Quote from: Nethaera    Blizzard Entertainment and its affiliates work very closely with the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia to ensure that we are in full compliance with Australian law as it relates to the distribution and operation of our games, including World of Warcraft. Wed like to reassure all of our players that World of Warcraft is currently, and has always been, distributed and operated legally in Australia.|`|AA12328571	lol nah haven't heard of that and dont think its true, it meets all advisory requirements, not violent or anything like that, only thing it is that its really addictive so unless the prime minister was playing WoW and not looking after his country then yeah but otherwise, it aint going to get banned.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Apparently it's true.

AA11224177	My favorite overall has always been Dragon Warrior III for the NES. The main reason for this being my favorite was that this was the game I got into the series with. After that, I really enjoyed playing through I and II, but IV was the most amazing game when I first got it. The whole concept of the chapters, and having such a big party to control. My only annoyance with the game was the AI system taking control of my party in Chapter 5, why would you cast beat on a boss?    Graphically, I am still awed by Dragon Quest VIII and Swords. I just am so amazed at the way they were able to make the game look so realistic, but maintain its roots.     Dragon Warrior VII was a lot of fun, but wow, you really do get your money's worth with that game. I think they were trying to go for a record in length here.    I really enjoyed the Game Boy remakes for Dragon Warrior I-II and III. Part III again was my favorite. I remember reading about the Super Famicom version, and was always upset we did not get that in the US. The graphics would have been better on a console, but at least we got the game.    As for the DS remakes! I really enjoyed playing IV. It was a familiar walk down memory lane, but with some new twists and at a much faster pace. I am really excited to play V and VI, and am okay that VI is delayed because of IX. I am really impressed with everything I have seen for IX, including the videos online showin the cut scenes.    I am happy that they have not changed much of the formula that makes Dragon Quest, well Dragon Quest. And, really like that we now get them in them as Dragon Quest with the subtitles.

k3cmetWRaa	Unfortunately you can't.    An aircard is a PCMCIA.    If the 360 had one of these slots available to it then you would be able to configure the Network Interface Card or NIC to pickup a wireless network.  However the 360 has no such slot.    This would be the only way possible to do this.  Connect an aircard to a laptop.  Use a router to setup a network between your laptop and your 360.

I made up a whole story for them!  Art and Beatrice Hogan had Cillian, Isolde, Nathan, Seamus, and Winifred.  Winnie and Izzy were very close, being the only girls.      Cillian married an Italian.  They met when Cillian, an innocent bystander, was struck in the head with a home office projectile during yet another break-up with Delia's longtime boyfriend, Carmine.  Their twins both have middle names that start with A, while Frances and Agnes have the same ending sound and Georgette and Angela both have those soft G's.  Henry was named after Delia's younger brother, who passed away weeks before he was born.  They had the name Hugo picked out for him before that.    Isolde is the most grounded of the siblings.  She married a good provider and a great father.  They have three adored children - their only girl is named after Izzy's mother and sister.  Their oldest was recently accepted into Notre Dame - he is named for John's father, Kerry John O'Carroll.      Nathan is sort of the black sheep of the family.  He married an artist and they live together in the woods of Vermont.  Their triplets are all named for gems and royalty.  Cordelia, King Lear's daughter, and Esmerelda, meaning Emerald.  At two years old, Queenie is already living up to her name.  Pearl is the only grandchild that carries on Beatrice's red hair!    Seamus married Theresa, the very Catholic only child, of a Scottish immigrant.  Although Seamus and his father-in-law don't get along, he and Theresa named their sons after him - Uilliam Aloysius Vaughn.  Both boys have middle names of Saints.    Winnie met Xavier at a Bruce Springsteen Concert when she was 17.  Both flighty, both youngest children, they aren't the perfect match, except that they love each other passionately.  Winnie named her daughter after her best friend: her older sister, and her mother.  She named her son after her husband and her father.  They recently moved out of Art and Bea's home and are 20 and 22 years old.

8hbm4uiPaa	After casting Mycosynth Golem, you can maintain priority, but you can only play spells or abilities that can be played as instants while Mycosynth Golem is on the stack.    In other words, you cannot maintain prioirty and respond to your own casting of Mycosynth Golem by casting Darksteel Forge.  Mycosynth Golem must resolve first.    In order for Mycosynth Golem to resolve, you must pass priority to your opponent.  They cannot respond with Unsummon, because Mycosynth Golem isn't in play yet, so unless they have a counterspell, chances are, priority will be passed back to you.    When Mycosynth Golem resolves, you then have prioirty again as the active player.  At this time, you can then cast Darksteel Forge, and gain all of the benefits provided by Mycosynth Golem.    Just like the resolution of Mycosynth Golem, Darksteel Forge cannot resolve until you pass prioirty.      Once your opponent regains prioirty, they can cast Unsummon on Mycosynth Golem; however, the casting cost for Darksteel Forge has already been paid and Darksteel Forge is now on the stack, so it will resolve whether or not Mycosynth Golem is in play or not.    The scenario doesn't quite work as you have explained, but it works all the same.  Your opponent will not be able to use Unsummon to prevent you from playing the Darksteel Forge for free on the same turn you play Mycosynth Golem, UNLESS you play a spell in-between that will allow your opponent to gain prioirty and respond with an Unsummon before Darksteel Forge has been put on the stack.    BTW: Good Question.|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	First, I like Blink's answer, it's good.  Second, you have priority when you are the active player and there are no spells on the stack.  When you played your Golem, your opponent has priority after that to respond with any counterspell or other instant.  Should your opponent choose to let the Golem resolve, thus emptying the stack, you again have priority and may play the forge.  Again, your opponent may respond at this point as they have priority after a spell is played, but like Blink pointed out, the Forge would already be on the stack and paid for, just awaiting resolution.  If your opponent bounced your Golem back to your hand, the forge would still resolve and come into play.  Also, once your opponent plays his spell, you have priority back to counter or play instants or abilities of your own.    To answer your questions in order, every play you mentioned is a legal play.  You cast the Golem, it resolves, you cast the forge, your opponent unsummons, both resolve and you have a golem in hand and a forge on the field.|`|hqx5T6HEaa	Actually, blink's answer is somewhat incorrect even though it gets to the ultimate correct answer.  You cannot cast mycosynth golem and maintain priority and then cast darksteel forge.  Darksteel forge is not an instant.  Only one non-instant spell can be on the stack at any one time. The stack resolves as davios detailed.|`|l6lh6fT8aa	I have no idea what the above poster is talking about. Priority exists.    Anyway...technically, you can "maintain priority" after you cast something (the Golem) and cast something else, if your opponent does not have a response while the Golem is on the stack.     So this is what would happen:    You play the Golem and maintain priority.     You play the Forge.    Your opponent now has priority while the Forge is on the stack, and they may Unsummon the Golem if they wish. However, costs are paid when you play a spell, not when it resolves. The Golem would be in your hand, but the Forge would resolve normally.    However, this would NOT work if you replaced Unsummon with a counterspell. Your opponent could then counterspell the Golem while it was on the stack (you can't maintain priority while something is on the stack - only after it resolves), and you would not be able to play the Forge without paying the cost in full.    Remember, though, you should, technically, announce when you are maintaining priority. Although most judges would give the play to you because it is a legal move to maintain priority, some would award it to your opponent, since you SHOULD announce it.    If you need to know how to do it in Magic Online, you hold Ctrl while you play the spell.|`|NK525d80aa	There's no such thing as priority. Your opponent is welcome to play a card on the stack at any time, whether it be in response to one of your spells, upon the resolution of one of your spells, at the beginning/end of a turn phase or just because they want to.    If your opponent plays Unsummon in response, Darksteel Forge still resolves its activation requirements have been met; otherwise you wouldn't have been able to play the card.
ZtbKqycqaa	There's many ways... You have to have a hard drive on your 360 though...     Okay, you can put the songs on an iPod or any MP3 player with a USB cable and then plug it right into the 360 and rip the files to the hard drive, you can use an SD card inside of a USB SD Card reader and do the same thing as option  1, you can rip CD's to the hard drive, or the way I do it - Media Sharing. You have to be connected to Xbox Live and be using a router, but you turn on media sharing from Windows Media Player and you can access all files and playlists from your WMP library.|`|RSezkuvxaa	i use a wireless connection between my pc and xbox  and also using windows media player 11 as vista allows ya to do this with ease|`|O2SszNzUaa	If it's on a cd then just stick that in - that's what I done.    Also if you're on a wireless network then you can connect to your pc and then transfer music from there. I've never really done it and so haven't looked into it, although I'm sure that way isn't too tricky.
YSmYkc5Yaa	The sequence is 4 6 5 4 5 3 4    Yes you have to start at the mission start.    And you must play either on normal, hard or legendary to get it.    The  1 ring is the first one at the entrance, and the 7th ring is the last one at the end.    So you'd start out by going four rings in, jump over it, go two rings in, jump over it, go back one, jump over it etc.    But yeah the sequence is 4 6 5 4 5 3 4.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	I'm not sure of the order, but you can go to gamefaq.com and look at the Skull Faq for H3.  It's got a walkthru of each skull and all the details for the puzzles.    I do know you don't have to finish the mission first, but it is recommended to kill all the baddies first.
Dso7k3sjaa	That's a great answer that the first person game, thumbs-up to him!  :-)    I know where you can download hacks that will let you run a school in the game, but if you can't figure out how to use them, you'll have to register at the site and ask there because even though I've known about those hacks for a long time, I haven't ever wanted to have a school in my game.    If you need help to learn how to download and install custom content (the school or the hacks) then you can ask and I can help with that, but I don't really know how the hacks actually work, k?    Here's the link to get the hacks:    http://www.simlogical.com/sl/Sims2Pages/...    **I tried to click on the link that the first person posted and discovered it wasn't actually a link.  So I tried pasting it into my url and it wouldn't work.  So, here's a link that will take you to a page that lists several different schools:    http://www.modthesims2.com/browse.php?ta...    I haven't looked for the school supplies yet though.  I just typed "school" into the search box and this is the page that opened:    http://www.modthesims2.com/browse.php?ta...    I'm assuming you can find school supplies when you look at those pages.|`|ZoJsKFbWaa	Well, here some school in mod the sims 2 page...school building with a small apartment and study/office for the teacher, two classrooms, science and sport rooms, and a school garden. Just follow upper link for more details and to download. Required nightlife.     And maybe if you want some school accessories, try to follow another link.    For me, I usually download anything about sims 2 in www.modthesims2.com...it just like heaven for sims 2..kidding..  (you must register first..)
t8JQJP7Xaa	If you go look up Warcraft 3 on the main blizzard site, you will see that it does indeed support Mac OS X.    Also, if you want to purchase it, you can order it from there or go to your local game store.    If you own a old copy that does not support Mac, then you will have to have a windows OS cd that you can install via Boot Camp or Parallel. Then install the game through there.|`|VT6yclsmaa	well yes if u have a copy of windows boot camp it etc... and i seen people play war craft throzen throne on mac book so don't worry lol XD|`|jeXlZ0sSaa	If you have a copy of Windows, you can use Boot Camp to run Windows on top of Mac and play it... I'm not sure if they have that for Mac or not.|`|ve4Xtsgwaa	If you buy any Blizzard disc they work on mac. :). Or you can run WIndows torrent through Crossover or Boot Camp. But i suggest getting the game its only about 3 50.

Zd0yuyGlaa	My best guess is that the game probably just slipped and didn't record the score. Give it another go on your choice of difficulty, that should get the game back in gear and get your score recorded. Sometimes game code and programming fails, not uncommon, just try a second time and that should fix it.    Have Fun!
9xbpCS46aa	i think it might have something to do with your memory as it says "Not enough storage is available to process this command." so it might be that you havent got enough ram or hard drive memory|`|jg3qOg4Oaa	reinstall to a different hard drive.
eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Now that's a hard question. There's an absolute flood of great games that are rumored, coming, or in development, not to mention the one's that are already out that I haven't had time/money for. While it would be hard to resist asking for an original House of the Dead arcade machine, or X-Men Children of the Atom arcade with the 6 player double screen layout, or possibly the Ninja Gaiden arcade game- I think I'll go console and ask for Marvel vs Capcom 3.|`|jcRU9nb2aa	Halo wars|`|jEEjwG2haa	I would probably have the limited edition Halo Wars.|`|kTnLcf32aa	I would like metal gear solid 4. I've played the first 3 games but not the 4th one cause i don't own a ps3.|`|rfMLIqMpaa	Lord of the Rings Conquest|`|pi9tf609aa	Resident Evil 5|`|kkUhJ1seaa	Starcraft 2, without doubt. Much better than other shovelware you get from Blizzard.|`|Z0I5Qvk7aa	BioShock 2. Or Diablo 3. Tough choice. Most likely BioShock 2, though.

jg3qOg4Oaa	PC ftw. You can always upgrade your PC and there are tons and tons of games to play.  If you meant console then the ps3 definitely...  With games like MGS4, Killzone 2, God of War 3 etc etc this system is awesome. Free internet connection, bluray disc drive, HDD out of the box, out of this world graphics capabilities, easy to use UI, sexy design, brilliant games, etc this is by far an awesome console. And if anyone says that there are not enough games on the console then they have not been to a store that sells games recently. Every single game that has come out for the 360 since the ps3 release besides a few exclusives (namely Gears of War/Halo) has been released for the PS3. Yet the 360 has missed out on some epic titles, such as MGS4 and Heavenly Sword, Warhawk, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Little Big Planet etc etc. Who wants to play games that are three + years old when you can get brand new ones?|`|OJ79IraJaa	SNES.|`|9iSKgRF8aa	xbox 360 is the best so far didn't get to play much with the other consoles.|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	PS3.

Like the Wii is more family/kid type games,loads of fun though. Now the 360 is more mature action,Gears of War 1 and 2,shooter action,360 also has more games than any other system that are good.  PS3 i just loved Heavenly Sword and not to mention the best game ever God of War 1-2 and soon 3.|`|E8VKvndjaa	Absolutely no question, the Nintendo Ds.    Why?    -its portable  -connects to Wireless internet  -excellent gameplay  -touch screen interactive    I recommend to anybody to go out today and buy one!|`|56gjUDjCaa	woo.....the guy who said "Everyone who says Xbox 360 Is just too cheap for a Ps3"....he's way wrong; he doesnt know what he is talking about: maybe, he doesnt even have a Xbox 360.    well, in my opinion, A Xbox 360 has many games, but the best part is online games where you can communicate and have fun. There's more people with a desire to play online games, and thats where all the action and fun starts(dont get me wrong, the games' story line are awsome too)  in the Xbox 360.    on the other hand, A ps3 doesnt have many games to play(maybe cuz its new). And the Console its bigger and takes more space.    The graphics are about the same.  except, the ps3 has a little better graphics, but thats about it.    Well, ill leave it to you....  If you like games with good,better graphics than the 360, get the PS3...remeber it doesnt have  various games  If you like a lot of breath-taking and action games and online, get the 360....  you choose...    or if everything goes wrong, get a PC.... :)  peace|`|BxLbzsJJaa	I haven't been around for long so I would say the 360. Although the PS1 and N64 had some fantastic games.
QVNVAH7Qaa	Actually Robert, I took the time to look into the "in game music" subject for Killzone 2 and it has been confirmed that Killzone 2 will..WILL.. have in game music capabilities, but only for multiplayer online or offline. It seems that Guerilla has added their own dramatic music for single player campaign. Which is not too bad because it gets a person more into the game. And to Robert again, maybe you haven't played certain games, but if you again, LOOK INTO IT, you can find games that do support it.|`|FoEzCmvcaa	If you mean to play it on your Playstation 3, then no. Why? cant really say. As far as i know it didnt work with any game that i have played on the system.

ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	I absolutely cannot play Silent Hill|`|R0ZWMW5laa	resident evil|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	I think the scariest game is Ghostbusters on the NES, not because it a scary game but because it is so bad.|`|mUMMLjDdaa	silent hill.|`|BYWcFlveaa	condemned|`|e9ARhomFaa	FEAR!! i know it wasnt that scary but the slow gameplay and  that little girl moving around and not knowing what she was going to do next really freaked me out man!|`|6oli1iF4aa	When I was younger Clock Tower and Shivers creeped me out. but then I did play them late at night...    I find Silent Hill is pretty scary if you play it on the dance mat. You get to stamp the monsters to death :D|`|oEfnqmp3aa	Eternal Silence. It was for the Gamecube. They got some good patents on the mechanics of that game, and thus there has never been something quite like it since. Well, I hear F.E.A.R. holds a similar concept, but I can't speak for it and doubt it.    Eternal Silence wasn't focused so much on scaring alone, but tapping into the player's sanity and being more direct in causing harm. They would do subtle effects that you may not easily notice until you pay attention in a "Was that just..." kind of reaction, such as statues turning their head. There were times were a volume bar might appear and decrease, making you check your remote. The TV may turn off or the game may act like it froze. They'd even be so cruel as to put you through intense battles, only to make you realize you ignored subtle clues pointing out you were not really in that battle and would have to deal with the actual one once you get it together. I became so cautious when casting spells, as casting a spell that causes your head to explode in a violent death, only to realize you're still 3 rooms back, is not something I want to face.    They truly could make the player paranoid.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly- Japanese style Horror that works (unlike the Ring)  one of my fave Horror games, you play twin sisters that have been trapped in a ghostly village where some kind of (what I can tell so far, I still haven't finished it...) ritual murders happen every so often. Your only weapon is a magic camera called the Camera Obscura ( which is based on a real camera for photographing 'ghosts' I looked it up on Wiki ) Rated M for Scary & Gore...best played at night with all the lights off...alone ^_^ Although my husband laughs at me when he comes in the door and I have the Chef's knife next to me .|`|gB5ATj7aaa	eternal silence == eternal darknes?    ---  I found clock tower 3, and project 0 2  on ps2 quite creepy .

dfcaf140efed90dfce60d1fc015f3d77aa	GW2 is still a year away (or more) so if you are itching to play GW again I would suggest Nightfall.    There are 4 parts to GW.  Three are stand alone games that you can link together (Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall) and one is an expansion (Eye of the North) that requires one of the others.    I have been playing for 3+ years, but do take time off now and then as I find other things for my time.  If you enjoyed playing originally, I think you would really like one of the other parts of the games.    If you are mainly a PvP player, you will be missing some of the skills if you don't have all of the games.  It depends on what profession you like to PvP with on how big of a disadvantage you may have.    Everyone has there own way they like to game.  I have found GW to be a fun and repeatable game.  I do own all 4 parts to the game, so have alot to choose from.  I would suggest trying Nightfall or Eye of the North...I think you will find at least several months of fun with these new parts to the game.  For $20 or $30 I think it is cheap entertainment since there are no monthly fees.    Have Fun!!|`|jP9n1CjJaa	I've been playing it for 2 months. And after about a month and a half It got so boring. Then about 2 weeks l8r I quit. Now I play Project Torque. It's much more fun. It's a racing MMO. It's like Need For Speed but with an MMO touch to it. It's new, so not many people play it yet. But I can tell it will be a huge success. And it's free. Free to play, free to download.       Here's the link: http://project-torque.aeriagames.com/
GLQL2IEaaa	it sucks. i've stopped playing the game. the excitement is gone due to hackers and what not. i found out that being outside can be much more exciting.|`|ViHe4VhWaa	The pvp element is still around but in the way of Bounty Hunter.    A big arena where you get given a target to kill. Easy enough, but you can also kill other players targets and become "Skulled" As like the old pking; being skulled will result in you losing all your items when dying.  There are also pvp worlds as stated in the post above.    Hope this has helped.|`|TsGq6aseaa	They replaced it with PvP worlds where players can fight everywhere except some certain areas such as banks. Although the reward system is different, instead of getting the items the player has on, you get other drops, whether you get a good drop or bad drop depends on the impressiveness on the kill, items the player has or something.
ypTawfqZaa	i dont think its possible because i have a ttds card myself and it cannot be done because you cant turn your ds into a movie player you JUST...CANT...DO IT! so i guess the best answer will go to no one because no one can tell you so no one can include sites that they are on because there ARNT ANY!

UnwO0ZxNaa	Wii definitely. I own both and the PS3 really needs a good television to work both.  Its great to laze around on your bed while playing Mario Kart on your Wii. :P|`|JV445FR9aa	i would go with the ps3... because you have a better game selection for that than the wii... but both consoles are awesome... so which ever you pick won't really be a bad choice...|`|r60WMB6paa	I like both systems|`|4hHmNmDqaa	ps3. Bluray will look great on your tv if it has a HD port.|`|KZEp26vBaa	i'd buy ps3 coz ps3 got much more games.|`|AA10546195	It depends on what you are looking for in a system.  If you want a recreational system that is most fun when there is company, then you would enjoy the Wii more, not to mention it would be the most cost effective (games $50, system $250).  If you really love games, but tend to play more single player stuff, then the PS3 is your best bet.  Each game is full of detail and content due to the size of a blueray disc, so you can always bet on a good fleshed out game.  Your TV (assuming its just a plain, no HD, tv) will not really show off the glory that is blueray, but it doesn't omit the fact that you are getting one built in.  I have all 3 new gen systems and play games like a paying job. Most of my time is spent playing alone, and to be totally honest my Wii doesn't get much attention (no pun intended).  If there are friends over, then we will get on it and play sports or party style games.  The main reason for that though, is the total lack of split screen games now that online has taken the throne.  It truly does have a lot to do with what you expect out of a system, and who will be playing it.  From the sounds of your situation, I would go with PS3 if you can, just for a more expandable overall media experience.|`|FoJlzQB4aa	Wii because more people have it        *Low cost        * Innovative controller        * Nintendo franchises (Mario, Zelda, etc.)        * Downloadable classic games        * Nice, simple Web browser and Internet "Channels"            * Mii's         * Family friendly       * it eats less electricity than PS3       * you get exercise|`|QGwEwb0daa	I would go with the Wii.I'm a Wii owner.One of my friends owned a PS3,and he dropped it about half a foot and it broke,and my Wii,I've dropped it five times from a higher place(Not on purpose) and it's STILL not broken,not even a scratch.
E8VKvndjaa	The Soft Card is to be used when applying the Screen Protectors on your Nintendo Ds.

ajomjCepaa	There is a small generator inside.  A mechanism (A gear rotated by a toothed section of the squeeze handle) turns the generator, charging the small capacity Nickel Metal Hydride batteries.  Since these are LED flashlights, it takes almost no power to run it for the short time you will be using it.  These are usually underpowered lights, that do not do a good job of helping you see.  New, ultra bright LED flashlights with 3 alkaline batteries last for 80ish hours, and that is more that you will typically use a flashlight in a lifetime.  Good luck!|`|aUB0oRHBaa	just keep squeezing it and itll build up enough energy to turn on

Get Metroid Prime 3, or House of the Dead 2&3 or HotD: Overkill.  MP:3 is like Halo (sorta) but more powerups, the Wiimote/Nunchuck is AWESOME in MP:3- the HotD games are light gun games, but none of them have online that I know of.

Ea0I54zQaa	To the best of my knowledge- No because the Mythic Map Pack is only DLC, which means it must be downloaded from Xbox Marketplace, whereas the ODST update is a standalone expansion pack that must be bought in the shops. In fact it counts as a game on its own because you don't need Halo 3 or and Halo 3 files to play it. Also the map pack is irrelevant to the storyline for ODST and I can't see how it would work in the game as it is for Halo 3 not Halo 3: ODST which is technically a different game altogether.

JSvfa4a0aa	Yeah, first you need to provide the physical connection which will wither be Wireless via wireless router or through an Ethernet cable from a router. This will give you the actual connection then, you can start using the browser with no registration, but to play games online you need a PlayStation Network Account. which can be obtained by following the sign-up page which is under the heading Network on the XMB. Once you have followed the on screen wizard you will have a PSN account and will be able to play online.|`|XAv3og6raa	to register your ps3 you have to first connect it to the internet either by wired or wireless connection, then in the xmb click on to sign up, and just follow the instructions, to set up an account so that you can play online. if you just want to use the internet and not play on line you dont need to register your ps3, only if you want to play games.

Wzws8v8daa	unforuntely there is no way to do that. the only thing you can do is when you first log on, before you get started, go to "other things" and the choose to tear down your house and rebuild, but you will be starting with a blank house, with none of your stuff inside of it.|`|Ea0I54zQaa	In Animal Crossing games there is unfortunately no way to move houses. The only thing you could do is have all you people immigrate to another town (if you can do this on City Folk) via Wi-Fi and then rebuild your town in the hope you'll be assigned a better house- it is random. Town folk will eventually move about randomly, best to not make friends with them so they decide to leave.

But finally Neversoft, developer known for Tony Hawk series made Gun for PS2 and Xbox, while Beenox ported it to PC.    Story 8/10    Colton White (Thomas Jane - actor known for starring role in Punisher) lived a nice quiet live as a hunter, with his father Ned (Kris Kristofferson). One normal day became Colton's worst nightmare. His father got killed. Now he wants revenge.    Gameplay 7/10    This game could be described as western GTA with much smaller area, and overall much simpler gameplay. Also, side missions are available, but there is only a few of them, and they are relatively easy. You can work for Pony Express (delivering all kinds of things), be a sheriff's deputy or a federal marshall. You can also work for Indian Hunter hunting wild beasts. There is also a work at ranch (which is fun by most people, but I hated it) and poker tournaments. You can also mine gold. All side missions are copied from GTA.    The atmosphere is incredible, it feels just like watching Sergio Leone movie, but even better, because this way you get to be Blondie (not literally speaking, of course).     Gameplay is great and what is most important extremely fun. Cars from GTA, are replaced by horses, and it is really a great fun riding them. You can make them gallop, but if you are doing it too much they will die. It is also pity that there are only two towns. You can buy upgrades for your weapons, from the salesmen, but basically you won't even notice the difference. That is it for the good sides. Now the faults. It has certain bugs- like slowing down when you are entering new areas and loading a new location right in front of player's eyes. On default the game is pretty easy. When you get killed in missions, the game loads a checkpoint, which is usually very near to the place where you've got killed. Western version of bullet time is here called quick draw.     There is around twenty weapons. You gain a new one when you complete a certain mission. You have a gun (later two guns), a rifle, a shotgun, dynamites, whiskey bombs, bow and arrow (later dynamite arrows), and of course a melee attack. Whenever you finish a story, or side mission your abilities will improve. That is a nice detail, but I haven't notice a difference.    Graphics and Sound 8/10    Music is also great, just like voice acting. Graphic is OK. It is pretty, but not too pretty. It could run pretty well on average machines a year ago, so you should have no problem with it today.    Conclusion     Even with the couple of irritating details Gun is definitely worth buying. It offers some great fun and it posses extraordinary wild west atmosphere.|`|ZvZvgXAoaa	NO ITS FALSE
3EqmcGYyaa	It is really sad and they say it is a disease. People get a high by winning and they just keep going until they lose it all.|`|707gOCvbaa	It's an addiction that consumes them. I knew a woman that gambled everyday and had 3 kids to support on her own. The kids went without most things because she gambled and could not provide. It was worse since the father was a no show. Gambling is worse than drug addiction. The casinos make it so easy for people to play against their house or car. That's unfrickinbelieveable.|`|xqOWI8VUaa	Yea its pretty sad watching em sitting there all hunched for long hours pressing the same button over and over.

When the budget is gone or I've won, I'm done and gone.|`|Ct45CMDgaa	The glitz and glamor the flashing lights the hope to have a better life     but personally i stick to online gambling|`|VALo05Zdaa	why do people play any game?  its relaxation and fun to them.      you can ask the same thing about SOLITAIRE players or a video game player. the difference with gambling is that SOMETIMES you get money back.  ;-)

Crow stuffs that up.|`|dy494ifyaa	Actually, LS stomps on GB's...so does Tele-Dad decks...GBs are also dying slowly...GBs are dying because people are stopping them with simple cards like Vanity's Fiend, Solemn Judgment, Royal Oppression, Prime Material Dragon(Gyzarus cant pop)Skill Drain (they get to switch out, but they don't get the effect), and even worse, Jowgen. GB's are the Lightsworn's playground.   Also...right now the best deck is Tele-Dad...not lightsworn. Tele-Dad has sooo many options to win...they work everywhere...LS can simply be stopped with oppression and skill drain or remove from play (not mine). But LS is 2nd place...sometimes 1st...depending on how you run it.

AA10248312	I worked at Disneyworld (Orlando) when I was a "kid" (summers during college) ..which I imagine is probably pretty much the same as working at Disneyland.    It was a pretty cool place to work.  The "tunnel" system underneath the park was pretty cool.  The walls of the tunnels are color-coded so that you know what part of the park is above you.    Each area of park has its own set of uniforms (except don't call them "uniforms", they're "costumes").   Employees (except don't call them "employees", they're "cast members") are forbidden to appear in public in their costumes unless it's within their own area of the park.    For example, I worked on "Main Street".  I would not be allowed to appear in public over in "Tomorrowland" or "Fantasyland" if I was in my Main Street uniform...I mean, costume.    The "wardrobe" department at Disneyworld was incredible.  We were told that it was bigger than all of the wardrobe departments in Hollywood's studios combined.     At that time (early 80s, right when EPCOT opened), Disneyworld had about 17,000 employees, and EPCOT added another 5,000.   I don't know how many employees they have now.       During one of the summers that I worked there, I was on the "graveyard" shift.  My "day" started at 11:00 pm, and ran until 8:00 the next morning, with an hour for "lunch"., which we took around 3:00 a.m.  ... basically, we would work through the night to get the store (the Main Street "Emporium") ready for the next day.  This involved straightening out the merchandise on the store shelves and restocking them.   Underneath the stores, there are huge stockrooms.from which we'd bring the merchandise up to the store in these huge bins.  Occasionally, when our downstairs stockroom ran out of merchandise, we'd have to go to the main stockroom to reload.    It always amazed me that it really did take all night to get the store ready for the next day.     Being a cast member was not difficult.  I don't know if all of the same rules are still in place, probably most of them are.  You could not have any "facial hair"...so if you had a beard or mustache, you had to shave it off and keep it shaved.  This rule was put in at some point during the parks history (it opened in the early 70s I believe).  If someone already had a beard or mustache at the time the rule was instituted, they were allowed to keep it (i.e. they were 'grandfathered" in)  , as long as they didn't shave it totally off.  If they ever did shave it totally off, they would not be allowed to grow it back if they wanted to still work there.     I believe that a couple of guys had mustaches or beards at that time, because they'd already had them at the time the rule was put in.  But i never saw them.    During the interview process, we were given "lessons" on the history of the park.  They wanted us to be familiar with the characters, etc and to be able to answer basic questions from the park's customers.    One guy I worked with was just there because it was a job... he didn't really like the Disney movies all that much...he told me one time that a customer (actually, don't call them customers, they're "guests") asked him a question about a Disney character and he said that he told her "I don't know the answer to that, Ma'm, I'm not into Disney".  If the guest would have told a store manager, or if a manager overheard this guy saying that to a guest, I imagine he would have been either placed on probation or dismissed immediately.  That was not the right image to portray for a guest.    A couple of things stand out.  The routine was pretty much the same.  The park would have the Main Street parade at the same time every night, so it didn't take long to memorize the songs the caliope played.  And as far as the merchandise itself, of all the stuffed "plush" toys, the grand poobah of them all was a $300 giant stuffed "Winnie the Pooh" (there was also a $250 giant stuffed Mickey Mouse).  I don't know what these items cost today, but we did sell quite a number of them during the time I was there, mostly to folks who lived outside the USA.    It was not difficult to be nice to the guests.  They try to hire people who have pleasant dispositions to begin with.    Any Disney park is a very expensive place to visit, and the employees know that.  It was a nice atmosphere in which to work, the employees in my areas always got along very well with each other, and most of the guests had little kids with them.  The vast majority of the parents who were there with their kids were always very nice...you'd occasionally run into someone who was grumpy, but it wasn't a big deal even being nice to them.  If they would become abusive to an employee, that's another matter, but I nver saw that happen.  And most of the little kids who came in were just so amazed to be there that it was a pleasure just seeing the looks on their faces.      It was a great experience.
rItaulkDaa	You could try Dofus but its a downloadable MMORPG not sure if that is what you are into but www.dofus.com its a tactical rpg and its really fun there are like 12 different character classes to choose from...    a text based rpg I know of is KOL or kingdom of loathing   www.kingdomofloathing.com you play it right out of your browser    You play a stick character that is one of 6 classes..you collect meat which you use for currency and stuff like that it can be quite amusing    Then there is psypets which I play on a daily basis www.psypets.net/original , created by ThatGuyBen as we psypet players call him...    From the psypets front page:  In PsyPets you take care of strange (and cute?)-looking pets, chat with other players, prepare food, and collect rare items. Started in late March of 2004, PsyPets is still worked on, adding more items and features with player input.    PsyPets is not like other pet games:  It's about how you raise your pets, and what they are capable of doing. You do not beat up monsters, your pets do. You do not find rare treasures, your pets do.  It's a simulation. The pets' behaviors are defined by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, personality theory, and common sense. Your pets eat, grow, and give birth. They can and will die if not properly cared for.  It's a place to meet other people and talk about whatever you want to talk about. (Just don't break the law, kids! Parents: you may lock your child's account out of the discussion boards if you so choose.)    Requirements to Play    In short, PsyPets is a web browser-based game in which Javascript and cookies are used, but Java and Flash are not. PsyPets has been tested to work on most modern browsers. For more information, visit the Requirements to Play page (on the PsyPets wiki).

The older the model the less money you will get.

ocjRl7Mcaa	i have both 360 and ps3, for me its the ps3. i don't know why all these people are saying there arn't any good exclusives for the ps3. theres metal gear, uncharted, uncharted 2, infamous, killzone 2, resistence 1 and 2, little big planet, god of war 3 and a crap more coming out this year too. and for the online, yea 360 is alittle better, but you end up paying 50 bucks a year, doesn't seem like much but after two years the 360 ends up costing you more then the ps3 and you still dont have a bluray player    the 360 has some good ones, halo 3, if you like gears of war, i personally hate it, and fable and left for dead. and btw metal gear solid 4 is the best game ever made.|`|XPlDqZjpaa	Because PS3 is the latest here, most ppl will choose this.  Btw, I think they have different creators, though...    For me, it's the PS3.  But I didn't chose it because it's the latest, but I think it has more new features than the other one.    Well, it's up to you what you will choose!|`|PTdrapBjaa	Look at the games on each console, many will be on both consoles, but there are some exclusives. The reason i go for X360 is because many of the exclusives on it are must-play for me. E.g. Halo 3, Mass Effect, Gears of War 1/2, Fable 2...    Good PS3 exclusives are much rarer, the only one i would want would be Metal Gear Solid 4, and i wouldnt buy a console for one game and miss out on many others i do want.    Also, the performance is basically the same for both, but the 360 tends to work better for multi-platform games (on more than one console)    PS3 online is free, 360 is not - but it is superior.    360 is cheaper    PS3 can be used as a blu-ray player, 360 can not.    Watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfkDxF2kn...    I very strongly recommend the X360 over the PS3|`|Hyy0FKIwaa	x box 360|`|2fqXT9W6aa	The Xbox,360 it has better graphics and better exclusive games. Also, it's cheaper and It's online play is better. The RRoD and other problems have mostly been fixed now.|`|7o4PXaQEaa	Ps3, simply because it has a massive amount of potential. The X360 has already been around for a bit of it's life period, PS3's life is just beginning. (Lookout for many awesome games before the end of the year)|`|JmVP5ECQaa	Long answer: Price, performance, visual quality, game selection and online support. I think the XBOX 360 wins in every category.    Price: This is obvious; the XBOX 360 core is only $299. The PS3 is around $499 for the 20GB version. It comes with a hard drive, but you dont need a hard drive to enjoy a lot of great games on the 360 so I think its fair to compare both core systems.    Performance: On paper, the PS3 is more powerful. In reality, its quite inferior to the 360. Without getting into too many details, the three general-purpose CPUs the xbox360 has are currently FAR easier to take advantage of than the SPUs on the PS3. I suspect a few years down the road some high budget, first party PS3 exclusive titles will come out that really take advantage of the SPUs and do things the XBOX 360 cant, but I dont think the console is worth buying based on this speculation (for some it will be though, we'll have to wait and see how these games turn out).    Graphics: The XBOX 360 is a clear winner. The GPU is more powerful. It has more powerful fillrate, and far more pixel and vertex processing horsepower. Part of the reason is their choice of memory, and architecture of pixel and vertex procesing. I cant get into details but the same vertex shader will run much slower on the PS3 than the XBOX 360. The 360 also has a clever new way rendering high definition anti aliased back buffers. To accomplish the same effect on PS3 is prohibitively expensive. For this reason I think many games will have no choice but to run in non-HD resolutions on the PS3 version, use a lower quality anti aliasing technique, or do back buffer upscaling. The end result in all cases is going to be noticeably worse image quality.|`|1SY3d5Ejaa	probably the 360, because with the PS3, you have to install games onto the harddrive for some reason, but the xbox still has the red rings of death. try getting an elite 360 if you can|`|ANtrfnCdaa	ps3 i have but ive heard a lot of good things about xbox 360 so i will choose ps3 because its the only one that i have played and it seems cool|`|4ywxp6Uyaa	PS3 all the way coz  it has better graphics and it is also a blu-ray player so it is lyk 2 in 1

dlHCV3sBaa	well, yes all of the xbox 360s do tend to have the red ring of death, but i personally have never had one that did this(i have had 4 360s) and all have worked perfectly for anywhere from 6 months to 2 years that ive had the 4    but dont listen to someone who is gonna tell you that you need to get something else because of this issue, unfortunately all electronics are prone to mess up(the ps3 has problems of its own)     what i would suggest is that if possible contact Microsoft and see if you would be able to send back the xbox if it did infact mess up(which im sure you would)     i would like to also add i dont think you would have a problem with one straight out of the box(ive only heard of one story where someone did have that issue)|`|T6s87nLWaa	i WOULD SUGGEST A PLAYSTATION 3, ALL XBOXES ARE PRONE TO GET THE RROD IM AFRAID, OR BUILD A COMPUTER

i7ZArzliaa	Supposedly, Kazuya is the protagonist now... after he took over G-Corporation (the only force that could stop Jin and the now rampant Mishima Zaibatsu), the world saw Kazuya as a rising hero... (although, the only thing on Kazuya's mind is to kill Jin, steal his Devil Gene, and take over the world himself!)    Another hint is in the "Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion" game intro video... the two main characters fighting each other is Jin and Kazuya.    Anyway, just my thoughts~ Happy gaming!  (??)    Cheers,  Chris.
6PMCEgGpaa	What kind of game?    An RPG?   http://www.rpgmakervx.com/  http://www.rpgrevolution.com/    Maybe a FPS?  http://www.fpscreator.com/    Or even a Fighter?  http://www.rpgrevolution.com/download/mu... (freeware)    Whatever game you intend to create, most game making programs have a friendly forum-based community where you can promote your game. Note that the above programs *are* are available for free, but I don't think that info is allowed to be shared over Yahoo. *cough*torrents*cough*|`|RjGtp41Zaa	Start off simple by buying the $20 program Game Maker 7 (yoyogames.com). This program features its own coding language and it has a simple drag and drop system. I would reccomend going to the forums for help though (gmc.yoyogames.com).  I also think u can make games with Macromedia Flash.|`|bc6MlMyoaa	Do you have a programmer?  If not, I'd suggest one (or more) of you learn python to begin with.  It's an easy language to learn and has a great community.    Next, check out sites like gamedev.net, especially the beginner's section of the forum, they are usually quite helpful there (one hint, don't suggest that you're going to make an MMO like World of Warcraft).    If you start to make progress on your game, you might want to see about submitting it to the Independent Gaming Source (tigsource.com)

AA11001595	Gambling is an interesting word, and most people don't understand it.    A gamble is putting yourself into a situation where you can win and you can lose, and you don't know with certainty which of these two outcomes will happen. A casino sets up all of it's games and slot machines to make it so that they win money in the long term. It's known as the house edge. That is how they make money, and it is why so many people lose at gambling in the long term. It is because they are playing games where they are favored to lose.    A professional gambler will use that same concept and reverse it. They will ONLY participate in gambles in which they are the favorite, and they will always set it up so that they are at an advantage.    That is the essence of a good poker player. They have to have enough knowlegde to give themselves an edge in the hands they play. As long as they continue to do that, they will make money.    A really good book on this was written by Amarillo Slim and is called Amarillo Slim In a World Full of Fat People - The memiors of the Greatest Gambler Who Ever Lived.    He is constantly referring to that concept - never making a bet unless he knows he's a favorite (and in his case, a huge favorite).    However, there are other accounts of success at gambling. Gambling is commonly thought of as playing in casinos, and the casinos make it so that in the long run, you lose.    What a poker player does it to put themselves into positive gambles.|`|u2slnVCoaa	There are people that make living of it.  I refer to poker and spors betting.  These are the only ways of gambling that is possible to win money in the long term cause everything is skill and a little luck.|`|Nc0mxdY5aa	Yes it is possible but     You will need a decent bankroll to get started.

(find the garage on shoreside vale first, it has better cars to put in. banshee, stinger, infernus, and cheetah.      Fun Ride   First put on the Flying Car cheat: Right, R2,Circle, R1, L2, Down,L1, R1.Then Jump on a car, then shoot the roof of the car with a weapon you can aim like the sniper rifle, then the car should start to go fast (not all car will start to go fast) The car will go fast enough to fly.

MADWEATHER = Time Speeds Up?   BOOOOORING = Unknown (Time Slows Down?)    TIPS  ******  Unlimited time in Taxi Missions  =======================  Start a Taxi Mission, pick up someone, and drop em' off. Now, go to pick someone else up, but make sure they don't get in your taxi until the time is at exactly 0 seconds left. The timer should disappear, but the passenger will not leave your vehicle. You can now continue doing taxi missions without the timer, until you quit the mission or blow up your cab.    Get to Staunton Island at the very beginning of the game  ======================================...  If you want to go to Staunton Island, but don't want to have to complete the missions in portland, then first enter the code chittychittybb. Next, steal a police car and head onto the broken freeway. Go as fast as you can and when you reach the broken part your car will begin to hover. All you do now is just make sure you don't land in the water and then you're in Staunton Island without completing any missions.    Get to Shoreside Vale once you have access to Staunton Island  ======================================...  Before you start, make sure you have armor and your health is at 100. Drive to the subway down the street from your house save location and drive your car down the ramp and onto the subway tracks turn right and stay on the left side of the track so the subway doesn't hit you. Keep going until you see on the screen 'St. Francis Airport' drive up to the point where the tunnel has a curve park your car on the left side of the tracks, and get out and go to the right side and hug the wall as tight as you can and wait for the subway to come. Once it comes, let it hit you and you might have to move to the right a little once it hits you so that you go through the wall or sometimes you'll fall through the floor. You should see your character falling through this green or blue screen and then the loading screen should come up and say 'Welcome to Shoreside Vale'. You'll fall right outside or near the airport.   Note: If you die you'll go back to Staunton Island.    Almost infinite sprinting  =================  Instead of holding down the sprint button, tap it rapidly and you will be able to run alot further before getiting tired.    FBI CAR  =======  Steal an FBI car and take it to paint and body. Get it fixed and when you hit the button to turn on the lights while moving, it will have hydros and jump over other cars.    Get to Staunton and Shoreside without any cheats.  Get an ambulance and drive to the entrance to the Porter Tunnel. Park the ambulance on the left footpath right up against the blue barrier (back facing the barrier). Now jump on top of the ambulance and then jump again. You will end up in "Blue Hell" on top of the tunnel. Now jump over the barrier and continue to run but make sure to stay on the far left side. Keep running following the tunnel to the left until you hit an invisible wall now simply fall off and you will drop from Blue Hell onto Staunton Island a little north of the hospital. To get to Shoreside from here simply take the Porter tunnel as there is no barrier blocking you (the barrier is still in Portland).    This works 100% on the PS2 however on the PC 50% of the time you may need a grenade and full armour as you may get stuck on top of the ambulance so you will need the grenade to blow the ambulance to knock you above the tunnel. Enjoy!

The character that played Bella never closed her mouth even when not talking, but otherwise she was good. The rest of the cast were good aswell.  2. It was extremely romantic, maybe a bit over the top, but there was some dramatic action in there aswell.  3.'The small town of Forks' doesn't actually seem that small, but the costumes seem right for a bunch of high school kids.  Hope this helps.|`|D8LUpQdraa	1.) They are very well casted.    2.) I think it's more of a dramatic movie but it had some funny parts in it.    3.)

ESWPNPWHaa	Great game, You Tube for gaming.    3 modes - play the game, create your own level and share it with everyone just as they have shared theirs for you to play.    You can play every level online with friends or anyone you might meet and the user created levels number in the thousands.    The game is simple to play but can be tricky in places. You actually only need to use two buttons throughout the game, x to jump and r1 to grab things. In fact everything is extremely easy to use and creating the levels is the easiest part despite the fact it would seem to be the hardest.    I could not recommend this highly enough, a true family game for all ages and huge replay value as several new levels are added weekly if not daily from the LBP community.|`|pYj8KZUNaa	It's a fantastic game, it's level of customisation and the physics engine are unbelievably fantastic. but you have to get the MGS pack from PSN. you get a PAINTBALL GUN!!!! it looks awesome plus some other stuff. the pack should be out now or soon.

1BJsJcQ3aa	Did anyone introduce you to the game? If so have him/her help you. If not visit http://www.dota-allstars.com. Its the official website.     Once you're there go to 'community' > 'forums home' > 'strategy' > 'Complete List of Strategy Guides'  then scroll down to axe.    What you need is basically practice and experience. Do you know about last shots and denies?    Last shots are when you are the last person to hit something before it dies, basically the one who kills/destroys it. You earn money from doing that.    Denies are then you either click on the sword on the right hand side of the control panel (I don't really know that it's called, its the place where in a normal game you use to build things) and click on your own creeps to deny them. You lvl up by killing creeps and if you deny the creep, it would count as not killing it so you would not gain experience. You could also press a then right click the creep.   In some cases you can also deny your friend's heroes. Usually when that hero is under some spell that takes damage over time. Like Doom, Viper Strike, Battle Hunger etc.    Trick: When trying to deny or last shot, press the alt key (this will show the life of the units you see in your screen as if you have your mouse over them, or you could set it to show it automatically in the main menu when you run Warcraft.    About the 1st skill, from where I live, in Thailand, people would up Counter Helix, and I believe it's what most people up all over the world.    Another thing. If you're still new to the game. Don't think about what you should buy. Think about what you should not buy. That would broaden the choices you have and if you do it a lot, you'll become more flexible*.     *Flexibility, along with others like skill/technique, experience, teamwork (for team plays), etc.  are one of the lines that separate better players from normal ones.       Its also better if you start playing with AIs before playing with people unless they are willing to help you improve or are on the same level as you.
wpLgoBOsaa	American Revolutionary War maby?    http://maxpages.com/reenactor/games|`|FLJCEvvXaa	arenascape?|`|CKQtOusTaa	moparscape are different clients about runescape where you can buy party hates and dragon armor for 1 gold   etc.|`|FDyzj6ICaa	Motorscope?|`|oTrfvK9iaa	moparscape|`|vlABP0xSaa	i beleive you are talking about moparscape.its a game jsut like runescape, but changed in way that u can level up really fast or find 100k on a table,or get dragon armor drop from a varrock guard ,and stuff like that.Eventually it will geet very boring because u cant kill somthing without risking all ur kool party hats and stuff. if u die u lose everything thats equiped.and theres way too much lag.also in order to  save ur progress u have to log out;thats where the lag comes in...     hope i was help!
lhuJ5K5caa	gameloft has lots of games and many options on how to download them.|`|dITppebcaa	maybe at www.zedge.com i download from there.u may also like them.|`|WchGezIAaa	not sure about mobile phone...    but as for strategy on the go,    but try the new FF tactics franchise on the ipods  its actually really good.
Ek6Wmwk5aa	Yes, you can transfer all the all the legendaries to Pal Park. But make sure that they don't know any HM moves or else you can't migrate them.    Hundreds of them? I think most Japanese persons know that (but sorry, I don't know)    To catch Ditto, you can use Pal Park by migrating Ditto from Emerald.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Every pokemon.|`|sX8SD7N9aa	All Pokemon can be used to enter Pal Park.  PokeRadar is initially used to avoid Pokemon. But you can use it to catch rare Pokemon (well just one that you don't always see), but usually it will show you a common Pokemon.|`|vtGlSJfCaa	no the legendary birds cant be captured in pearl and this is the ar cheat for 999 masterball(press l+r)  94000130 fcff0000  b21c4d28 00000000  b0000004 00000000  00000f4c 03e70001  d2000000 00000000 and pokeradar is capture certain pokemon certain pokemon appear only when pokeradar is used and only 6 pokemon from each gba game per day can be migrated and also the timing should be same the ds and the gba game timing

Pn9E0q1raa	its automatically saved just go to your computers desktop and usually look for your document folder or something like that and you will see something that says "EA GAMES" i believe and it will have sub folders that say videos, pictures, and etc. click pictures and it will be saved there.
40PydCaVaa	it was heidi bohay and then kelly packard, now i think he has quest hosts, such as mellissa rivers, tracy gold to name a few
l6lh6fT8aa	Well...the best booster box to buy that would actually be reasonable to buy (unlike Alpha and Beta, or really any set that's rotated out of Extended) would be either Conflux (as a new set coming out Saturday, cards will be in high demand for a short period of time), or Morningtide, or Future Sight.    Morningtide has Bitterblossom and Chameloen Colosssus, as well as several other cards that sell for decent amounts of money like Primal Beyond, Taurean Mauler, and Murmuring Bosk.    Future Sight has Tarmogoyf. Enough said.|`|AA11715682	Well Alpha and Beta are obviously the best bets to go but that would cost you like 25K.  So I'm thinking Urza's Destiny or Legacy or Saga because the foils in those sets go for crazy amounts of money.|`|qeoOMuV0aa	Buy the latest set as that is where demand is usually highest.|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	Alpha and Beta are the best, especially if the people have them to sell, but probably not as they would be doing the same thing you're doing.  After that, Revised as it's basically 3rd edition, but with all the same cards as the first two sets.  After that, I would do as the previous person suggested and work on the foils that go crazy, but Arabian Nights is another set that has high priced cards that still may be available from some sellers.  The Bazaar's and other creatures go for oodles of cash amongst Legacy and Vintage players.    Hope that helps,|`|F9v9nv2qaa	The latest set is usually the one that recieves the most attention, though individual players may have personal favorites - I like the  Invasion block (and I wouldn't say no to masters edition 2; this edition has true double lands with no drawbacks!)|`|7e5jd9Eyaa	that u could afford.  1.morning tide.  2.Future sight   3.lorwyn  4.eventide  5.shards of alara
dy494ifyaa	Honestly speaking here...you should make that deck a Ratbox deck. Its much faster. Here is what you should run...absolutely no tributes...they can be dead draws...this deck build is actually fun to use and i actually topped in a tournament with this...but lightsworn is better.  Monsters  Giant Rat-3  Exiled Force-2  Maruading Captain-3  Elemental Hero Wildheart-3  Elemental Hero Neos Alius-3  Elemental Hero Stratos-1  D.D. Assailant-2  D.D. Warrior Lady-1  D.D. Warrior-2  Sangan-1  Snipe Hunter-1  Command Knight-2      Spells  Reinforcements of the Army-3  Monster Reborn-1  Lightning Vortex-1  Heavy Storm-1  Shrink-3   Brain Control-1  Scapegoats-1  (Mystical Space Typhoon-1)    Traps  Solemn Judgment-3  Mirror Force-1  Phoenix Wing Wind Blast-2  Trap Dustshoot-1  Torrential Tribute-1    Also if you want to team up with your brother...try making a Monarch deck...he will have macro...and you will have monarch...macro monarch!!!|`|Bmx6AtDCaa	nice deck i like it a lot 7/10 but a few changes like try 20 monsters 10 spells n 10 traps i hope i helped|`|yUxh8Eozaa	i would  try to add in a harry potter or a dumbledore..then you would be invincible|`|U0k6pG04aa	D-hero dasher.     reinforcments of the army.

tL9SuAWbaa	Halo 3...love it.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Rainbowsix vegas 2 is the best  It will be the next game on MLG tournaments|`|A9TbEueYaa	cod waw|`|GV7Z0JRiaa	Super Mario 64.|`|c5bOFwaQaa	ether call of duty world at war or halo 3.|`|JZVsrKWgaa	I know this is already listed but Call of Duty Modern Warfare is the best first person shooter of all time. Great graphics and its not like halo where you start out all bad *** with a team then for some reason everyone dies but you and your left to kill everything by yourself wich yes is badass but, much funner having an army of kick *** guys rushing into fire blowing the shitocki mushrooms out of everything and the sniper level is the shizzle. Lol buy it play it drool over it!|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	left4dead|`|rFwyQqOvaa	call of duty world at war|`|4255760f761afe3e40ddebaaeca4d981aa	Call of Duty 5|`|2SYrVb3faa	either Halo 3 or Call of Duty 4|`|Xg6aknaeaa	Gears of War 2 , Halo 3 , Or Call of Duty: World At War
YoiuismKaa	if you playing pearl or diamond then get a wifi connector trade with people or fight people on line if you dont know were to go to fight people on line go to www.ign.com and type in the box pokemon pearl/diamond and then youll see a picture of peral or diamond click boards its tiny print under the picture then go to tradeing thingy or look for someone to fight
yVgL3Qsxaa	You figured correctly, larger games such as RPG's require much more space to store FMV, hi-res backgrounds etc.|`|NBXRriXXaa	Interesting fact, the Xbox 360 version of FF13 is apparently going to be a multiple disc game, while the PS3 version will be using blu-ray discs, so will be just one disc|`|CT3t80suaa	Yep, its needed to store all the data. It's more common on PC games from a couple of years ago, but happens on consoles etc. as well.
BFUXe0X7aa	:)  IF it is soon then:  get a medum size box and put candy in it then tap it up and glue some colorful paper on it then hang it on a tree! (*i know people in their 20s that like to do that)  get candy and put them in bags(one in each) and skater them through your back yard.  When it is night time let everyone have a flash light and search for them!   you could also play musical chairs EVERYONE LOVES THAT GAME!    HAVE FUN WITH IT!  (hope i helped)  BE HAPPY!!!!!
xxoaRXiMaa	You did the cheat backwards. Lol, happened to me before.  You can't get them back, sorry.  Just keep this in mind; next time, use weak and useless Pokemon to do it...|`|vbAlVxtBaa	you dont... any pokemon you use that is involved in a cheat disappears... cheaters never prosper|`|9vS6bUdsaa	you cant it is impossible|`|MejN4E8waa	uhh... next time, make sure u save first before u do anything cheats... cause if you failed.... somethin' bad will happen... it happened to me once oso lol..|`|mEYEVy1haa	You'll never get them back.Cheating gets you nowhere.
mOTCr8Pxaa	EXP share. Get it to where it can fend for itself and then battle constantly. If you EV train it will take longer. I can train a lvl. 100 in 3-4 days.|`|GRzcARU8aa	The road on the way to Snowpoint City has a few high leveled Pokemon. That's a good training place, especially for Chimchar/Monferno/Infernape.    If you have Piplup/Prinplup/Empoleon, then a good place is inside Mt. Coronet, because there is plenty of Rock-type Pokemon.    For Turtwig/Grotle/Torterra, try going fishing, or battling fishermen with the Vs. Seeker.    Tip: Keep battling the same trainer with the Vs. Seeker, because each time you battle them, their Pokemon get stronger. So, for example, if you battled somebody with a Lvl 20 Glameow, next time it could be Lvl 28, and time after it could be a Purugly.|`|FoJlzQB4aa	Fight the wild Pokemon on your way to the elite four and if you have experience share your experience will increase keep doing that until the level of the Pokemon you want is reach.|`|YljHCeSUaa	Well,it depends on where you are now.For example,if you are in Route 000 and the highest wild pokemon in there is level 30.Just stay in that place and train there.that way,you maximize the use of wild pokemon in that area for your training.Another tip is,for example,your pokemons are in level 30 now.And the wild pokemons in that area are also lv 30s.just battle there until your pokemon goes up to lv 38-40.then now you can go continue your journey,    Lucky eggs,which comes from a wild chansey,increases Exp. point gained after battling.Chanseys are rare but the chances of finding a lucky egg attached to a wild chansey is even rarer.But patience is a good value to keep.    this guide doesn't count as EV training.it is a whole different aspect.
