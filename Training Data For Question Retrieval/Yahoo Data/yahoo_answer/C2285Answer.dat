c8f8a15fe9b889540c8c3fcffe64b7d9aa	The contemplation seemed etched deep into my father's brow as if he had not heard me, but instead was concentrated on a portion of his past that burned deep within him.  As if counter to this tenseness in his brow, the cheeks on his already thick face fell in folds over his chin.  His eyes burned, yet nothing came from his throat, as if it was his own heart he choked on.      I could see the eyes of my mother covered over in slowly building water, giving them a glassy appearance.  Surprisingly, it was she who spoke, in her southern way, with the cracked words of those damaged by too many Newports and too many tears.      "The chile in dis pactuh, is...or was, You."      I found nothing inside me willing to speak.  I didn't understand enough, and after all, it was this very woman who taught me that I have two ears and one mouth, so that I could listen twice as much as I spoke.    "It was taken in dah same day of the picnic, by deh church.  It was taken de dah you..."  "That I what?"  I leaned forward and asked.  My elbows nearly came off of their resting position on their knees.  But she would go no further.  Her tears consumed her now, and she turned her head to bury it in my father's beefy shoulder.  He slowly brought his hand to the back of her blonde curly hair, and stroked ever so gently.      "That I WHAT?" I repeated, more tensely than ever.  "It was the day.. that..." my father now spoke in his deep powerful voice, "You Died!"    Astonished, I began to immediately laugh, as I couldn't help myself at this point.  It was ridiculous after all to believe such a thing.  After all, here I am, sitting in conversation with my clearly overreacting parents.  The laugh would have become a full belly laugh, had I not looked over at my father, who now burned his reddened eyes into my very soul.    "I died?" I asked while raising my doubtful eyebrows.  "Actually," he continued.  "that was only the first time.  The first of four times.  Last week was the last.  I killed you myself!  But you JUST... WON'T...STAY...DEAD!"

He participated in the conquest of Panama at the side of Pedro Arias de vila (Pedrarias), Nicaragua and took a very active role with Francisco Pizarro in the Spanish conquest of Peru.    Later, de Soto led the largest expedition of both the 15th century and the 16th century through what would become the Southeastern United States and the Midwestern United States searching for gold and silver and other valuable goods. He is presumed to have died on the banks of the Mississippi River near present-day Lake Village, Arkansas..."    There is more on him on Wikipedia. Read and take notes!

Whatever amount of paragraphs of information found, you have to "reword" the content, from whatever source, or else you will be "plagiarising" the material (illegally copying existing material and claiming it is your own).  I am sure you already are aware of that fact.  Your teacher would fail you if they found out, through your references/sources, on any project.  It really isn't worth all your efforts to complete something that won't benefit you in the end anyway.

Hopefully my sources will assist you.
3jdu3fLuaa	It depends on both the type of exercise and the fitness of the subject. A fit person may benefit from a "warm up". An unfit person, however, may encounter muscle strain that will not recover quickly and therefore reduce the squeezing rate.    The way to find out for sure is easy: Set up an experiment with an exercise group, a non-exercise group, and a control group.|`|AA12262008	Both are good, but . . . student "a" neglects to realize that squeezing a clothespin so many times in a minute will cramp the hand so practicing will only make it worse on the final try.   I think I would agree with student B.  Solution: test this claim. I think it would be fun. see how many times you can squeeze a clothespin in a minute. Record that number, and then do it again. record that result also. If the first number is higher, student "b" is correct. If the second number is higher, student "a" is correct.|`|AA10470797	I would definitely go with student a. Our bodies are made to warm up first and the exercise. Watch wrestlers, boxers, and all kinds of other athletes who need to get maximum performance from their bodies. They will skip rope, shadow box, and do anything they can to get their blood moving.    The best way to prove this is to set up a class experiment. Have the class split into two parts.    Group A is very still and does nothing.  Group B follows you in a couple of very simple exercises (walk in place, side straddle hops, and whatever you can do to raise the heart rate). Do it for say 3-4 minutes.    Then hand out clothespins to everybody and have them count the number of squeezes they get in one minute.    Record the results of each person.    Tally them up and get the averages.    The group that exercised will have a better result.|`|c733c5aca39d9948ef02ac401db52c6eaa	I would agree with Student A as the muscles in the person's hands/fingers are used to the extension/retraction.  Of course, the study would also depend upon the manual dexterity of the subjects.  If either one has poor hand coordination, the experiment will be moot.|`|C8ivfENFaa	I did this in lab class.  It is definetly student a.  To find proof, set up an experiment.  squeeze the clothespin as many times as you can in a minute after sitting still for a minute or two.  Sit still again and then squeeze again.  (you're doing it twice to make sure it wasn't a fluke)  That represents student b's claim.  Next run for a minute or two.  Squeeze for a minute.  Run again.  Squeeze for a minute.  When did you have more squeezes?  A or B?  It's A, it seems dumb but after running it increases the blood to your fingers and your finger muscles!  Strange, it wasn't what I had thought.      I disagree with "The Answer Man"  you shouldn't have different people do the resting and the excersize.  You never know, the A people could naturally have stronger fingers and using two groups makes more than one indepentant variable in your experiment.|`|5a8ceefb98c641d9312973f739c6079eaa	a b/c just think. most people must practice a sport to be good at it. plus athletes must do warp-ups before a game

In some technical, hands on fields like machine technician or automotive this can still be a good degree.  For many careers however, an associates degree isn't really much more than a high school diploma.  It shows that you have SOME interest in a higher education, and if you are still planning to finish a bachelors it might get you a slight increase in pay over another person with no degree.

AA11440210	well, I am right with you there sister.  this is what I am doing:  filling out the FAFSA.  applying for scholarships based on my race, ethnic background, age, grades, and major and writing essays and getting letters of recommendation.  this semester I have to take two classes, but then I can get by with only taking one at a time.  so you can save up money and take one class at a time.      There is abook for scholarships. look online or at the library.  Ask relatives if they would help.  Ask civic groups if you can do volunteer work in trade for some funds.    you could put it on your credit card and then pay your credit card off.  I wouldn't advise that though.    i am very anti-loan.  You could go to the bank and ask about their educational loans if you want to go that route.  I don't.  I am trying to get myself out of debt and that's why if it takes me seven years, I would rather do that then have 40,000 in loans.  good luck to you.|`|rxHgCYaYaa	From what I understand:    Pell Grant=free money/gift don't need to pay back.    Unsubsidized/subsidized loans= must pay back with interest either immediatly after program or starting about 6 months after.

Con un dlar tan inestable que vara de un da para otro, las proyecciones a largo y mediano plazo se hacen ms difciles de calcular, ya que complican la posibilidad de realizar un presupuesto destinado a metas e inversin.

Debido a que muchos pases guardan grandes cantidades de dlares como reservas, stas pueden usarse para comprar estas mercancas sin la necesidad de conversin de divisas. Si la denominacin de los precios de las mercancas se cambiaran a otra divisa, por ejemplo el euro, muchos pases venderan los dlares causando un desplazamiento de las reservas a esta moneda. De acuerdo con la ley de oferta y demanda esto debilitara al dlar.    El congresista estadounidense Ron Paul defiende la idea de que los imperios se han sostenido por la continua expansin y explotacin, y cuando ya no pueden hacer esto entonces colapsan. Segn l, los Estados Unidos hacen lo mismo a travs de la emisin de dlares que no estn referenciados a una mercanca como el oro, por lo cual el predice que los Estados Unidos colapsaran si la hegemona del dlar no se mantiene y propone que de nuevo el dlar sea respaldado por el oro. Segn Ron Paul, las guerras y los conflictos en los estados que producen petrleo suceden para mantener la hegemona del dlar.|`|7Jyp0pg4aa	LA IMPORTANCIA DE DOLAR???

El asunto del dolar es que de su valor no solo depende el pas de origen (EEUU) sino tmb todos los pases que tienen negocios importantes con ellos, es decir toda AL (Amrica Latina).

There was an outdated and archaic practice of using the intended use of a product to describe it... so peppers that were intended to be pickled would indeed be called "pickled peppers."    In the same vein, you can pick candied apples, and even pickles (baby cucumbers) and jelly apples.    It was still a common expression used by Nordic folks in the early 1900's.  My grandmother used to speak this way and explained it, as her grandmother was an English teacher back in the 1800's and explained it to her that way.|`|6a302ded0cb3ae070fbcb6449e4449efaa	None ... you can't pick pickled peppers, only fresh peppers on the plant.

mb2Otvunaa	I can take a stab at it?  Ohm's Law states that Electrical current = Voltage / Resistance  The current in the wire is indirectly proportional to the resistance.  If the resistance goes up (the distance is further) the current is lesser.    This is my guess at it, perhaps you can work off of it!
0QAUbLMnaa	it could mean he thinks you're lying, or it could be used to give their statement more credit.  like, "he is allergic to dogs."  "oh yea? How do YOU know?"   could be avoided by "he says he's allergic to dogs."|`|KVkU6WSpaa	It would not necessarily mean he is lying, but, if the speaker emphasizes the word 'says', it certainly implies that the speaker believes there is reason to question what he is saying.     For instance, let's say a guy's wife wants to get a dog, and he says he is allergic to dogs. The wife may think he is just using that as an excuse not to get one, when in actual fact, he may really be allergic.  So, she may say to her friends, in discussing the situation, "He SAYS (emphasizing the word 'says') he's allergic to dogs."    Hope this helps!|`|1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	The person isn't saying you are a liar but he has doubts.

He wants proof.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	I have read many medical reports that read "Patient states she has allergies" I do not think that means that you are not telling the truth.

If you are attempting to interpret text on a page, you cannot safely conclude his intent. If the speaker has no knowledge of the third party's allergic status, then the statement is technically accurate and cannot be interpreted as implying that the alleged allergic person is lying, only that the speaker cannot confirm it as fact.
AA10023710	You don't need both a HS diploma *and* a GED. You have the GED. That will be acceptable.     To make your resume look better, try to get a job in a restaurant - ideally, in a decent restaurant, and ideally, in something involving food prep, even if it's at a very low level. You want to work in a restaurant where they do the actual food prep on site, not like a McDonalds, where the stuff is really prepped, for the most part, elsewhere. If that's not possible, do something else involving food - volunteer in a soup kitchen and do prep and service there, volunteer in a hospital to do that, work for a catering company, work for a bakery, etc. Anyplace where you can get some hands-on experience. You want to show the culinary school that you really do know enough about this field to be sure that it's right for you.     If you're currently working in the food industry, and you aren't doing hands-on food prep, ask your supervisor. Heck, tell her that you're considering culinary school, and you need the experience. Often, knowing that, they'll be willing to let you do more.     If you're looking at JW and le Cordon Bleu, please also consider the Culinary Institute of America. It's one of the best, if not the best, culinary school in the US.   http://www.ciachef.edu/

You might consider asking the nicest of your professors for an extension (provided you have a reasonable excuse for not being done).      Failing that, work continuously on your assignments.  When I was behind in my course readings, and writing a typical liberal arts paper, I would normally need at least 1 hour per double-spaced page to write, while reading as much as I could during the process.  For every 5 pages, expect to spend another hour or so on the introductory and concluding paragraphs, and on editing, creating a works cited page, etc.    So, a 5 page paper should take about 5-6 hours, a 10 page paper should be closer to 10-12 hours, and so on.

Drink water instead, it will keep you up, it's healthy, and no after effects. Vita water without caffine is ok.  4) Try not to eat carbs, they make you sleepy. Fruits/veggies (dips are ok), and protein will keep you energized and awake.  5) Lower the brightness on a computer if you are working on one, so you won't strain your eyes  6) Do some excercise every one in a while, running, situps, push ups, whatever, to keep yourself awake.  7) Take a shower, this will keep you alert and you won't have to waste time showering the next day.  8) Stimulate your senses, put some perfume/cologne spray in your room, and spray it every once in a while.  9) listen to music, as long as it doesn't disturb other people sleeping.  10) take a 15 minute break after one hour of work, do this to eat, take a nap, excercise, etc.|`|ij7K499kaa	-To pull an All Nighter, first start with a cup of coffee.  -Dont eat too much, or you will get sleepy.  -Change your position and place of study one or two times.

xfqHi1tRaa	I'll give you some general problems and break down the first paragraph for you.    First, you change voice throughout going from active to passive and back. You should write in active voice.  Example  Active: The dog caught the ball  Passive: The ball was caught by the dog.    Second, you use the word "portray" entirely too much and not exactly correctly in most instances.    Now let's look at the first paragraph:    "In The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, the author presents the characters in which their physical appearances mirror their mental, emotional, or moral state."    Why double up information? Too wordy. Minor grammatical errors    Try:  In The Scarlet Letter, author Nathaniel Hawthorne uses characters whose physical appearance mirrors their mental, emotional or moral state.    "Roger Chillingworth and Arthur Dimmesdale are two such characters that portray these characteristics."    The first incorrect use of "portray". Use "display" instead (although not needed)  Written in passive voice.    Try:  Two such characters are Roger Chillingworth and Arthur Dimmesdale.      "Hawthorne uses descriptive language such as rhetorical devices.  . Detail and imagery for example, are used to accomplish this goal. Detail is used to lay facts of Chillingworths characteristics, while imagery is portrayed to display Dimmesdales physical features. At the same time, this better relates how peoples outsides, represent their insides."    Wow -- A mess!    Try:  Hawthorne uses many rhetorical devices including descriptive language, detail and imagery. Chillingworth's characteristics are displayed through detail while Dimmesdale's physical features are described through imagery. Hawthorne uses this technique to make the character's outside represent their inside.    Not the best paragraph, but best I could do with what you have.    This essay is decent, depending upon the grade level of the class. I'm sure you'll have people telling you "it's great" or "don't change a thing". You need to do a LOT of changing.     But, you're off to a nice start, this is a good draft, and it's definitely an appropriate use of Yahoo Answers.

aoFIYVdKaa	I've actually been to 2 of these programs and my younger brother has been to 3. It's a legitimate program where your child will get to meet a lot of new people and learn a lot of things that are not taught at school.     Your child will most likely be placed in groups and work in a group environment. He/she will also have roommates that will live with him for the duration of the program (should be about 10ish days). Your child will learn how to get along with others, how to become a leader, how to work in a team environment, etc.     I enjoyed it a lot when I went. I had a lot of fun and met various people from various backgrounds. It's kind of like sending your child to camp, but instead he or she is going to a hotel or university.     Overall, I think it's a great opportunity for your child. It is something that I did not regret going to. I believe your child would enjoy it. |`|kJZvULzEaa	i really don't know sorry

A mother shares her blood and flesh for many  months to give life.    The Hindu Sastras say "Maathru devo bhava" - mother is  an angel or goddess.    Mother is also the first teacher for any child. The  sub-conscious knowledge needed for the rest of life  of a person was taught by his mother. The so called  modern psychology has not recognized it.    One more thing which most of you have not heard of.    Research has shown that babies in their mom's womb can hear sounds from  the environment, and it is widely believed that the baby is sensitive to  their environment - inside and outside of their mother's womb.    http://www.articlecity.com/.../article_1...    A mother unknowingly sings lullabies while the baby  is still a foetus in the womb.    The Hindu Puranas speak of Abhimanyu and Prahlada learning while  they were still in womb:    "The yet unborn Abhimanyu listens to Arjuna as he reveals to Subhadra a  military secret how to defeat the chakravyuha, the impassable circle of  defense. Abhimanyu learns from within the darkness of his mothers  womb as his father uncovers the coveted technique of penetrating the  circle, by whispering it into Subhadras ear..."    http://www.asiasociety.org/arts/chor...e...    It was a faith that he inherited, not from his genes, but from the time  he was in the womb of his mother. By a fortuitous circumstance as a  child in the womb he was listening to the stories of great devotees  recited by Sage Narada to his pregnant mother, but actually directed at  the unborn child!    http://www.geocities.com/profvk/VK2/SBAB...    The Hindu Sastras say "Janani janma bhumischa swargadapi gareeyasi"   - mother and mother land are superior to heaven.|`|TUSNeUCcaa	The definition of the word "mother" can mean so many different things to many different people.

RDeYnyxQaa	Especially when you realise you're one step closer to skin cancer.|`|AA11419758	It's probably just media that says we'd all look better and "healthier" when we get a tan, and so our psychological follows it so we'd all "feel good" after getting a tan.     It's not as hard to maintain a good tan as people think though. Sunbathe everyday for only 10-20 mins and rub on fake tan on your skin afterwards and your skin will glow and look sun-kissed. As compared to others who spend hours and hours under the sun once a year. It only ruins their complexion more since you can't control the amount of sun your skin absorbs. So when you result in tanning too dark, it will last for months and the fading process destroys your entire sun-kissed glow look. Good luck!|`|eQj8rNE0aa	I don't.  It's hot and I get all sweaty.

Some writers occasionally use single sentence paragraphs for effect.  I have done it myself in academic assignments which have been very strictly assessed and it has been acceptable.    Your teacher may be ignorant, or he may just be insisting on five sentences for a paragraph for the time being to get you used to making your paragraph a substantial statement and not just a bullet point.|`|Ua7kJ6Tzaa	Psh.

A high GPA and an even higher class rank.     Since it's still your sophomore year, there's plenty of room for mistake so make sure you don't slack off. Colleges like to see a solid student so keep up the good work.    Some pointers for college admissions:    1) Take a rigorous class schedule (such as multiple APs and honors). If you compare a student with a 3.75 average with no APs or honors to a student with a 3.5 average with 5 APs and 2 honors by the end of Senior year, the student with a 3.5 GPA is definitely going to look stronger. Colleges want to see that you can challenge yourself and excel while your at it. However, don't overload on APs and honors, especially if your grades will suffer GREATLY because of it. Talk to your counselor on a proper workload as your options widen later on in high school.     2) Commit to a club or team. Commitment is very important to a college. Try joining a sports team or a recognizable club/association this year (if you haven't already done so). Colleges will rather see you commit to, let's say, tennis for 3 years than tennis for 1 year, basketball for another, and soccer for the last year. Also, the longer you commit, the better chance of you advancing in rank for that team/club/association. Perhaps you could even pull the position of captain or chairman by the beginning of Junior or Senior year. It's definitely a plus!    3) Volunteer! Colleges want to see more than just the student aspect. They want to know that you are an active participant in the community and have experience outside of school. Again, commitment is important so it is preferable that you stick to one volunteer job than three.     4) Practice for your SATs. SATs are important and a good score can only help you. Prep for preferably 6 months before you first take your first SATs and don't panic if you get a low score the first time. Statistically speaking, most students do their best the 2nd or 3rd time around.     Since it's still your sophomore year, there's plenty of options for you. Just follow some of the advice given above and before you know it, the colleges will be begging you to apply to their school. Just know that the college admissions process is not all about your GPA or your SAT scores. Your college essay, teacher recommendations, extracurricular activities are also very very important. Good luck with everything

mUDWMdaKaa	To find perimeter you add all sides together or two of each side so its  2L+2W=P  You know the length and permiter so plug in  2(12)+2W=(40)  simplify  24+2W=40  subtract 24  2W=16  Divide by 2 W=8  Then find area 8*12= 96 :)   2.... First find the area of the rectangle ... 64*81=5184  then find the square root to get the side of the square... you do the math :)|`|mRExprCMaa	ugh, im awful at geometry :[|`|pD2MtL9Oaa	ok.  If you have a rectangle with a perimeter of 40, that means that the length of all 4 sides adds up to 40cm.  One side (the base) is 12cm, so the side opposite it is also 12cm.  That means that the two other sides together equal 16cm.  (40-24 =16)    If the two together equal 16, then 1 side equals 8cm since they have to be equal.  Area is length x height, 12cm x 8cm = 96 sq. cm.    Area of Square = s  Area of Rectangle = r    s=r=(64cm x81cm) = 5,184 sq. cm.    Since all four sides of a square are equal, the area is the length of one side squared.  (area = l x w and l = w, so area = l squared or w squared).  So, since the area of the square = area of rectangle = 5,184 sq. cm, your square's sides are the square root of 5,184 which is 72 cm.|`|qyZOtMZnaa	A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides.   12+12 = 24.   40-24 = 16, 162 =8  So 12x8 = 96.    64x81 = 5184  The four sides of a square are equal. 51842 = 2592. 2592x4 = 10368    That's what I think the answers are, I would check them yourself to make sure. Hope it helps...

I am 90% sure these answers are correct.|`|5NgSeHNXaa	ok, the trick is to divide the problem up so taking the first one, we can change it too. (a)(a^2)(b^2), and the square root of (a^2)(b^2) is, of course, (a)(b) or just ab. so take ab and bring it out from under the sqrt symbol. since you can't find the square root of (a) just leave it under the square root symbol and multiply it by ab. so the answer is. ab times the square root of a.    The second one you solve in the same way.   sqrt (a^2)(b^2)(a)(b)  ab times sqrt ab    the next one you just find the square root of 64 and put it at the bottom of the fraction so it's 1/8, because 1/8 times 1/8 equals 1/64.    The last one is like the first, start by dividing it up.  3*sqrt (4)(2)(x^2)  now you can find the sqrt of 4 (which is 2) and of x^2 (which is x), so bring them out from under the sqrt symbol and multiply  3*2*x*sqrt(2)  So the final answer is  6x*sqrt(2)|`|sw2C2gMwaa	I'm in 7th Grade, and I don't even understand this...|`|HBwy4Jviaa	There's no way to simplify it u just have to take better notes and do example problems in your book|`|llEdx8Q2aa	Lol.

G9QHxZZIaa	The following is an actual question given on a University of        Washington chemistry mid term.          The answer by one student was so "profound" that the        professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is,        of course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well:          Bonus Question: Is hell exothermic (gives off heat) or        endothermic (absorbs heat)?          Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using        Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is        compressed) or some variant.          One student, however, wrote the following:          First, we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in        time & bsp; So we need to know the rate at which souls are        moving into hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think        that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will        not leave.   Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many        souls are entering hell, let's look at the different religions        that exist in the world today.          Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of        their religion, you will go to hell.  Since there is more than        one of these religions and since people do not belong to more        than one  religion, we can project that all souls go to hell.        With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the        number of souls in hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look        at the rate of change of the volume in hell because Boyle's Law        states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell        to stay the same, the volume of hell has to expand        proportionately as souls are added.            This gives two possibilities:            1. If hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at        which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in        hell will increase until all hell breaks loose.            2. If hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of        souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until        hell freezes over.            So which is it?          If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my        freshman year that, "It will be a cold day in hell before I        sleep with you," and take into account the fact that I slept        with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am        sure that hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The        corollary of this theory is that since hell has frozen over, it        follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is        therefore, extinct......leaving only heaven, thereby proving the        existence of a divine being which explains why, last night,        Teresa kept shouting "Oh my God."

3ExcyAJaaa	In general, in college you are graded on how good you are, not on how much effort you make.  If you are a lousy painter, it is prudent not to take a course in painting, as it will mess up your grade point average.  Some colleges with let you audit a course, so your grade is not included in your average.  Grading paintings is admitted subjective.  So is grading essays.  The instructor has to make decisions, and they are not always the best ones.|`|AA10023710	Your best option is to go to the teacher, and ask him to give you some advice on what you can do to get a better grade on your next paintings. What are his suggestions?     You don't go in there accusing him. You don't go in there angry. You go in there to get his advice. In this way, you actually do two things: you let him know that you're not satisfied with your grades without putting him in a bad spot, and you also get him involved with your work and your effort - you get him on your side.     Try to incorporate what he suggests into your next paintings. See how you do re: your grade.|`|aCDWwsisaa	You don't (or at least shouldn't!) get graded on effort, you get graded on results.    Imagine it is 20 years from now, you live in a huge mansion, and pay to have your vast lawns mowed; if they both cost the same, do you want to guy that does a terrific job but doesn't seem to be working very hard? Or would you rather have the guy that works really, really hard but scuffs up your lawn so that it looks like it's been attacked by alien moles?|`|DIlNnjf8aa	This is a chronic problem in arts and humanities courses which are highly dependent on subjective evaluations. The problem is that the subjective evaluation of one instructor may differ from that of another. I knew someone who abandoned history and went into physical geology as a consequence of being given poor subjective evaluations on his essays. Generally the hard sciences reward you better in this way, because the answers are generally objective, i.e., either you know the formula or you don't. But take courage, it is precisely the fact that the assessments are subjective and that instructors may differ that in the long run will give you the advantage (assuming you have genuine talent).
Q9Ule4Exaa	I don't think is stopped. It did/is happening.    Wikipedia says, "The system of spheres of influence by which powerful nations intervene in the affairs of others continues to the present day. It is often analyzed in terms of superpowers, [etc]".    China's growing economic clout (which was what gave it the power to influence governmental decisions in some African countries, for example) has been curtailed somewhat by the global recession/depression - investors have withdrawn their funds from Chinese companies, and international companies operating in China (such as miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton), seeing that global recession looms (they know that China depends on other countries to buy it's exports - if these countries are in recession then China inevitably follows), have sought safe havens elsewhere. This means that these companies have to scale down their operations and hence less tax/bribery money flows into the hands of the Chinese government.|`|Q1GuJDuxaa	They are trying to dominate the world market, by selling cheap junk.|`|PDNNhEs1aa	a sphere of influence is kind of a imaginary circle round a city cbd that shows how far ppl are prepared to travel to purchase goods from there

FCQ079mRaa	to get an MBA you need a bachelor's degree first - most schools require at least 3.0 GPA. Next, you have to take the GMAT (like the SAT but a little harder) the passing grade varies by school.     I entered a 5-year program - so it was definitely worth it - only had to take 11 courses to get my MBA - because all the foundations courses were waived because I had high enough grades in the undergraduate versions of the course.     Highly recommend doing a 5-year program - and yes make sure the school is accredited. It may not be worth it if it takes 2-3 years to get - I only did it because it took 2 semesters -and it was way easier than undergrad surprisingly.|`|AA10023710	An MBA can be worth it, but there are some things to consider:    - For many employers, the rep of the place you get your MBA matters. At a minimum, you want to go to an AACSB accredited program. Some employers won't hire you if your MBA isn't AACSB accredited:  http://www.aacsb.edu/General/InstLists.a...    - Also consider what an MBA will do for you in the field you either are in now, or want to enter after you complete the MBA. Is an MBA required to get where you want to go? Is it really helpful? If so, then it can be worth it, absolutely. But if you have no idea of what you want to do with an MBA, and see no value to it in your current career, then do more research first.     Lastly, are you still in college now, or have you graduated? Most MBA programs either require or strongly recommend that you work a couple of years before you enter the MBA. In fact, a lot of employers who hire out of MBA programs want that as well, so it can really benefit you to wait and work a while, and only then pursue an MBA.|`|9Jp1z5x8aa	an MBA is definitely NOT worth it.

I think you should do it if it will mean you will get a better job at the end and only if you can find a course you like. The worse thing you can do is waste three or four years doing something you hate if there are no benifits in the long run.    The university experience (going out all the time and living off pot noodle) for me only happened in the first year, when the work didn't count. As soon as the 2nd and 3rd years started people who are serious about passing their degree with good marks stop going out. I for one feel like I have no life at the moment (I'm a 3rd year student) I spend most of my time in the library doing dissertation research! This is why you will need to find a course that will suit you, I know i couldn't spend so much time on assignments if I didn't enjoy the course.    Hope this helps you decide

0NdBx2keaa	Yes, because pervs like me get off looking at young girls in plaid skirts and knee high white socks.|`|joiacDUdaa	I think school uniforms are a good idea.  Since most schools don't enforce dress codes and more and more young adults are dressing like common street trash!  Uniforms are a good idea.   PLUS there wouldn't be any social "outcasts" since you'd have the same basic uniforms.. Those who might be considered "fringe" students would just blend in with the rest of the students for the most part.  There would be some minor issues with those trying to express their individuality but, honestly in the real world we don't dress like goth or punk rock in most career tracks so why allow it in schools?  Also, it would take the burden of buying "school clothes" off the parents uniforms can be found most anywhere for a reasonable cost.  The focus should be on education not on fashion....|`|tqu2SALHaa	To be honest yes we do need school uniforms, they are there so that the school know that you are a pupil, for instance, if we didn't have uniform it would be easy for a Youth/Young Adult posing as a pupil and they can get access to the building just like that. So if you want to call it the uniforms are our ID cards, they are there so the teachers know that you are a pupil.      A topic on school uniforms for persuasion, this is my opinion of it, i wouldn't do it as its not the teachers that get to choose nor the Head teacher, it's actually up to the Council, MP's and the PM.     But hey i am not the person that is doing the talk you can choose anything that you want i cannot stop you, But i do persuade you not to do it on "banning" school uniforms from the school.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	Yes, for schools where gangs come on school property and try to blend in with the studenst to start gang fights.|`|n43DN6Duaa	I think its good to have school uniforms.. i remember back when iwas at school.

0MiCHlp5aa	I think it sounds pretty good as is, but there are a few minor grammatical errors. If I were going to rewrite it, I'd do this:    In life, we are constantly faced with choices. Some can be as easy as choosing between chocolate or vanilla ice cream, and some can be as difficult as choosing the person with whom you will spend the rest of your life. Choices can make or break us; they can bring about happiness and pain. The main characters of the poem, "The Road Not Taken," and of the short stories, "A&P" and "Hills Like White Elephants" all made life-altering choices. They chose to stand up for their beliefs and refused to conform to the ways of society. Although the characters had to make sacrifices along with their choices, each chose a path that would ultimately lead to true happiness.      I would consider taking out the introductory quote that you have. Those always throw me off when I read them for some reason, but that could just be my own personal preference. If you do want to keep it, don't capitalize the "l" in "look."    In the words of NBA Hall of Fame coach, Pat Riley, "look for your choice, pick the best one, then go for it."    Hope this helps! Good luck :)|`|45FanGQ4aa	It should be " we ar constantly facing choice"

I may be better than asking questions to the teacher.  2. If you get any homework do it and ask the teacher to help you if you get stuck on any questions. Doing questions helps you remember formulas.  3. Ask questions in class if you don't completely understand or stay after school and ask questions.  4. Pay attention in class. Don't sleep or talk to friends because you will get distracted and won't concentrate.  Follow these tips and you should improve your mark.  P.S.

Find out who your lender is and when you are expected to start payment.    ss|`|SIhxrxD3aa	Assuming that you have a federal student loan, then you have to begin repayment 6 months after graduation (or 6 months after you drop below half time).  If you owe your college money as your question suggests then you  would need to do that asap because they won't issue you a transcript or allow you to enroll for the next semester.  If you have a private loan, then the terms will vary.

Go to orientation. That's the best way to meet other freshmen. Everyone's expecting to introduce themselves and stuff.    Learn where other places on campus are (like registrar, lecture halls, library, gym, etc). You may not need them the first day, but it's best to know where they are now.    Go to the dining hall/other food places. Figure out what options you have. If you can, use your meal plan then so you understand how it works.    Ask your RA for suggestions.|`|1HLPznZhaa	Explore..find out where things are especially the buildings where you will be studying your subjects .. Drop in the book store and check it out ..

EZorC9S1aa	I will just answer as a reader. I think it depends on the form, structure, rhythm, of the poem. Most of Aragon's poems are unpunctuated but then, when I read them, I feel that there is an unexpressed punctuation that is not imposed on the reader. On the contrary, it means a greater involvement of the reader who then has to find this internal rhythm. It forces me, as a reader, to read out loud, and that can be a good thing. So, I suppose that unpunctuated poems are harder to write because punctuation has to be expressed, one way or another, even though it does not appear on the page (or the screen...).|`|vLnS4JJaaa	I'm scared to death of the comma.

Of course, I couldn't have said it as good but I agree with Mixtli!  I need to practice what I learned back in elementary school and use punctuation better.    You once pointed out to me that one of my poems read like a long sentence and then demonstrated it--I appreciate that!  I did see your point and did rework it and added the punctuation!    As important as punctuation is, I have seen in my own work that wrong punctuation is even worse!  Use your helpers and get it right----now I need to practice all of this myself!|`|n9hRyHpqaa	First, that Mix guy got on me once for not punctuating.  Now, I  am aware of it.  It can be helpful.  In one of  Evadne's poems yesterday, she used three periods in one line -- very effective.  I think the punctuation helps the reader to understand where the pauses should occur.  I also think some poems need no punctuation at all.  So.... it depends.    I saw this question on Mars.|`|j37DL7WLaa	I prefer punctuation, although I would be the first to admit I may use it incorrectly.  School was a long time ago and far away.|`|4ieW81HHaa	For me, personally, the lack of punctuation slows me down--unless the line breaks fall where there normally would be some form of punctuation--and I spend more time trying to figure out how I should be reading and can't concentrate on the content. And when there's more than one subject the lack of a period only adds to the confusion of where the verbs go.    I believe poetry is meant to be delivered verbally, like music, and therefore the tempo should be written in along with the notes and chord progressions.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	I have been "formally trained." When I write poetry I am used to capitalizing the first word of every line and punctuating as grammatically necessary. That being said, I'm trying to let go of those habits, because I feel it can take away from a reader's own interpretation of a poem. If I put a period at the end of a statement the reader WILL pause. If I let it go, the reader can choose to end the statement there or add a little from the next line to the statement, etc. I hope that made sense.    It does feel to me like I am breaking some sort of cardinal sin when I do not punctuate and capitalize correctly though. I guess it's just what I was always taught. Not saying I'm perfect at grammar, spelling and punctuation, but I do try.    EDIT: Now that I've read the answers - I'd like to add that I don't have trouble reading poetry with no punctuation or capitalization - it goes back to my original statement. I think poetry is subjective. I like to gather my own feelings about a poem as I'd like others to do with mine.|`|raU9c3tzaa	if the poet wants the reader to get to the very meaning he specified, he must punctuate properly to show detailed anatomy of the event[like Michael Angelo's paintings, and classical music songs, and Ballet dance].   if he wants to give them just a hint - that nudges their feeling, or a clue that would inspire their own imagination to draw its own pictures of the event, he would apply it partially [like Picasso's Guernica, and rock music].   if he wants to let the meaning entirely up to the readers, he would omit punctuation, or come heavy on the periods. in this case, they get the poet's feeling of it, but the meaning is left entirely to them to figure it out [ modern paintings, rap music, and hip-hop dance].   me thinks that it is way better for those who dont know how to punctuate -like myself - not to punctuate the verse. improper  punctuation confuse the reader, where the lack of makes him ponder.

1UsdeqwRaa	Ask someone  who has had a member of their family killed!  All too often the killers get off with a small term in prison when the family of the victim suffer life long bereavement!  Get the killers off the street PERMANENTLY. Either by multi life sentences (and I mean life sentences, not just a few years) or by capital punishment.  Capital punishment should be used when there is no doubt that the accused is guilty of the crime!  There have been incidences in the past where an innocent person has been hung for a crime that they did not commit, but this is rare.  Providing that justice in the courts is proven without ANY DOUBT, capital punishment should be imposed!|`|QASqKvSNaa	no i don't think it is fair at all. i have done a similar essay for RE.

How can anyone take the moral high ground and state - you are wrong to kill that person but I am right to kill you?    There have been too many cases world wide where innocent people have been executed because of a need to exact revenge for a murder.At least if people are wrongly jailed there is a chance to free them.    Punishment for crime should be a deterrent. However, I doubt if many criminals determine their actions on the basis of the punishment they are likely to receive. Most crimes, particularly murder, are spontaneous not preplanned.|`|NV43ZXoMaa	No And Yes! =]  Because Capital Punishment Should Only Be Used For The Likes Of Terrorists. The Reason being Is That You Automatically Know That They Were Going To Or Have Taken A Life. The Thing With Capital Punishment Is That The Evidence Might Not Be Looked At Properly Therefore You Would Sentence That Person To Death For A Crime They Didn't Commit, But Also When They Are Sentenced To Death They Are Not automatically Put To Death As They Will Be Placed On Death Row Until They Shall be Executed. You Would Have To Be Extremely Careful Before you Order The Death Of Someone.     Looked At That Last Week In Modern Studies, And Had A Debate. . .It Was Fun! =]|`|k6snvL6yaa	In my opinion, no.    It doesn't resolve anything. It only achieves revenge, which is a bitter thing to want. It will not bring back people who have been murdered or relieve families.    Well, on the other hand, it means that they will not be able to be on the street again and harm others. But that is a fault of our puny sentences. They should be locked up in solitary confinement for the rest of their lives with minimal stimulation, so they have to think about what they have done in every waking moment.    What gives the state the right to punish murder with murder? It sets a bad example and makes no sense.    Some people, nevertheless, will argue about the spending required to keep criminals alive.

Some Basic Things You Can Do with HTML    -change the fonts style, color, underline it, and Italic and bold it    -change the font color    -create a list   UL - for unordered list   OL - for ordered list   LI - for each line in the list    -create a table to organize your images or create a chart on your site   table - starts table   tr - starts table row   td - starts table cell    remember to end each cell and each row as well with a hash mark before the tag    -create a text link   text links are great    -add an image   img src    -create simple contact forms that include labels, radio buttons, and push buttons    -quote someone   blockquote - quoted text    -insert special characters and fractions into your text or blog post   these are just a small sampling;    &trade ? trademark sign   &hearts ? heart   @ @ at sign   ? ? copyright   ? ? registered trademark   ? ? paragraph sign   ? ? one-fourth   ? ? one-half   ? ? three-fourths    With HTML you can do a lot of different things with it within your website or even your blog. You can put images on your website and movies and video.    There is so much you can do with HTML to make your website more attractive and appealing to visitors.    But I must now caution you with this. Even tho many have found really cool things they can do with their websites using HTML coding, that it has made their sites way too wild and hard to find things.    Most people today will click away from these fancy sites, and instead be more willing to read a website that is simple and clean.    Keep this in mind while you are building your website, DO NOT get carried away with all the neat things you can do with HTML.   Keep it simple and clean.               Markup means "Text with tags added to it"    Language is self-explanatory.    HTML is a language for describing the structure, semantics (this is a paragraph, this is a heading) and relationships (this stylesheet should be applied, this document is next in the sequence, this text links to this other document) of documents.

Exams are important but you should not be stressed out over a exam if you follow some steps.  1. Always study a little a day. Don't study everything at once. Maybe you can give like 15 minutes per day to preparing for the exam.  2. Never leave studying until the last minute. This will stress you out more and if you are busy often, you will be more stressed out then ever.  3. Be confident. If you studied and followed my steps the exam will be a breeze.  4. Be prepared for anything. Being prepared for any questions will help you more if there is trick questions.  5. Have fun!! To help make it fun, make cards with questions and answers on each side. Then ask a friend who is also taking the test to ask you a question. I you get it right you get points. Both of you can play. Whoever has the most points can win something.    Deal with your anxiety:  Try to determine the source of your test anxiety. If it stems from a lack of preparation on your part, your anxiety is considered a rational response. However, if you believe that you are prepared for the test, but are still panicking or overreacting, this may be an irrational response. Either way, it can be very helpful to know how to work with their effects.                  Prepare for those tests and assignments:  This is the best way to minimize anxiety. Here are a few tips for preparing for an exam:    ? Avoid cramming for a test. Cramming can produce high levels of anxiety and is not helpful in trying to learn a large amount of material.    ? Instead of trying to memorize all of the intricate details from an entire semesters worth of notes and readings, try combining everything and learning the larger, main concepts first.    ? When studying, try to create questions that could possibly be asked on the test. Try integrating ideas from lectures, notes, books and other readings.    ? If it is impossible for you to cover all of the material for the test, choose one portion that you know you will be able to cover and present well.    Change your attitude:  It can help to change the way you think about taking tests. A test will not predict your future success or determine your self worth. Changing your attitude can actually help you enjoy studying and learning. Here are some ways you can work on changing your attitude:    ? Remind yourself that it is only a test and there will be others.     ? Reward yourself when the test is over.    ? Think of yourself in a positive way. Think of all the hard work you have done already or think of what you do know.     ? Plan ways to improve next semester    Dont forget the basics:  Dont forget about yourself and what you need. This means thinking of yourself as a total person, not just as a test taker.    ? Maintain proper nutrition and exercise, and continue some of your social or recreational activities. It is ok to take a break once in a while.    ? Make sure you get plenty of sleep. You cant function at your best if you are tired.    ? Do something relaxing when you feel adequately prepared.    Again, try to do something relaxing before the test. Cramming minutes before can produce anxiety. Get to the test early. This way, you can pick out your seat away from anxiety-ridden classmates and other distractions. Now, youre ready to take the testGood luck!                  to prepare for exams....:  The 1st tip : Never fear or hate exam and be confident.     Some students study well but still may be much afraid of exams and due to this reason they get distracted and won't be able to score marks.So leave all ur fears and freeyour mind before starting the study.

This should include all the subjects but may not be with equal priority. Tough subjects can be given more time and easier ones less but most importantly there should be time for entertainment and also sufficient intervals between subjects.     The3rd tip : Make notes while studying.    This is a very important point.

gb9REJN4aa	This is about average, not bad but not fantastic either. For 11th-graders, average reading in 2008 was a 47, average mathematics was a 49, and average writing was a 46. For 10th-graders, obviously those scores were a little lower; average writing for 10th-graders was a 41, your score exactly. So depending on your year you can see how you stack up.    If you had taken the SAT and gotten equivalent scores, they would be high enough to get you into average state universities, but not much more than that. They are plenty high enough to get you into community colleges with ease. Better research universities would usually want higher scores--but of course, you have a year at least before you take the SATs, and scores do go up with time.|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	no its horrible|`|xgZE6RvNaa	if you are sophmore or freshman, dont worry about it. if you are junior, start worrying. 145 is not the best score, if you know what i mean. best score is like 240...    next time, try doing the practice booklet before the psat, or study your old notes and stuff :)
rNSOSMZlaa	I wouldn't start off with a question.  I mean you can, but how formal of an essay is this?  Your first quote needs to be cited.  Also you shouldn't use "I" in essays either unless this is informal and your teacher said it was all OK.    The bold things are what I would fix in these sentences...    As a parent of a five year old daughter, I dont expose her to watching violent movies and cartoons that I feel ARE inappropriate FOR her age.    Second, at home I have to supervise what cartoons she wishes to see and that I feel ARE appropriate for her as well.    And I prefer her to watch something that is more educational yet entertaining at the same time such as "Bindi the Jungle Girl" ON the Kids Discovery Channel.  (you need to capitalize the channel and name of the program and put name of program in quotes)    I would take out the second to last sentence "Parents need to know what their children are watching." It doesn't really flow...maybe put it somewhere else...it is kinda redundant and doesn't fit there.      Other than those few mistakes it sounds good so far though, keep up the good work!|`|GpxY1fiiaa	Sweetheart,You should omit the contractions.That is a big no-no in formal writing.Dont=do not, its=it is.Place your question at the end of your introductory paragraph(5 or 6 sentences).The 6th sentence needs some work.So far your doing good.You should take advice from the people on Y!Answers.It will help you in the long run.

She was stark naked! As I was reeling from the shock I heard my 5-year-old shout from the back seat, 'Mom, that lady isn't wearing a seat belt!'     2) OPINIONS   On the first day of school, a first-grader handed his teacher a note from his mother. The note read, 'The opinions expressed by this child are not necessarily those of his parents.'     3) KETCHUP   A woman was trying hard to get the ketchup out of the jar. During her struggle the phone rang so she asked her 4-year-old daughter to answer the phone. 'Mommy can't come to the phone to talk to you right now. She's hitting the bottle.'     4) MORE NUDITY   A little boy got lost at the YMCA and found himself in the women's locker room. When he was spotted, the room burst into shrieks, with ladies grabbing towels and running for cover. The little boy watched in amazement and then asked, 'What's the matter, haven't you ever seen a little boy before?'     5) POLICE   1   While taking a routine vandalism report at an elementary school, I was interrupted by a little girl about 6 years old. Looking up and down at my uniform, she asked, 'Are you a cop?   Yes,' I answered and continued writing the report. My mother said if I ever needed help I should ask the police. Is that right?' 'Yes, that's right,' I told her. 'Well, then,' she said as she extended her foot toward me, 'would you please tie my shoe?'       6) POLICE   2 It was the end of the day when I parked my police van in front of the station. As I gathered my equipment, my K-9 partner, Jake, was barking, and I saw a little boy staring in at me. 'Is that a dog you got back there?' he asked. 'It sure is,' I replied. Puzzled, the boy looked at me and then towards the back of the   van. Finally he said, 'What'd he do?'       7) ELDERLY While working for an organization that delivers lunches to elderly shut-ins, I used to take my 4-year-old daughter on my afternoon rounds. She was unfailingly intrigued by t he various appliances of old age, particularly the canes, walkers and wheelchairs. One day I found her staring at a pair of false teeth soaking in a glass. As I braced myself for the inevitable barrage of questions, she merely turned and whispered, 'The tooth fairy will never believe this!'     8) DRESS-UP A little girl was watching her parents dress for a party. When she saw her dad donning his tuxedo, she warned, 'Daddy, you shouldn't wear that suit.' 'And why not, darling?' 'You know that it always gives you a headache the next morning.'       10) SCHOOL A little girl had just finished her first week of school. 'I'm just wasting my time,' she said to her mother. 'I can't read, I can't write, and they won't let me talk!'     11) BIBLE A little boy opened the big family Bible. He was fascinated as he fingered through the old pages. Suddenly, something fell out of the Bible.   He picked up the object and looked at it. What he saw was an old leaf that had been pressed in between the pages. 'Mama, look what I found,' the boy called out. 'What have you got there, dear?' With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered, 'I think it's Adam's underwear!'|`|HPLxP8M8aa	Cows can walk up stairs but not down them...Something to do with thier joints, cant handle it for some reason.

Question 1: 3a + 2b - 5a  What is the common pronumeral here? It is "a" (3a and nagative 5a)  So it will be 3a - 5a which is -2a. We can leave "b" because there is no "b"s.  Answer: -2a + 2b OR 2b - 2a (both are correct)      Question 2: 5a - 9 = 2a  This time we need to solve. With equal sign we can jump things.     5a - 9 = 2a    We can move 5a to the other side  Don't forget that we need to change. If it is +, to -       -, to +    - 9 = 2a -5a  - 9 = -3a    -9/-3 = a  Therefore the answer is: 3 (-9/-3 = 9/3)    I hope this information helped you    Andrew Lees  Mathematics Staff    Tong Leung  Head of Mathematics|`|hWlCGcMSaa	-2(a-b)  a=3    c'mon like
zV1H5hvhaa	150 years ago.|`|BA3y6MBlaa	I just had a big discussion in my head about this very top the other day.  Totally the fifties, where men were men and women were women.  I was raised by a Homemaker and worked my way through college but I so totally want to stay home with my 6 year old when he's out of school and play with him.  I am capable of making good money, but I hate my career choice.  Unfortunately, two years ago my husband got a diagnosis after 6 months of moving from hospital to hospital because he could barely move without excruitating pain (my NASA Engineer) and he has a form of Muscular Dytrophy, the freakin too proud Latino man (I'm as white as Mayflowery as they come) wouldn't apply for disability until 5 months ago.  Finally!   Anyway, my parents bought us a house so ...oh nevermind.    To answer your question - totally the 50's - there was rock and roll.Roles were clear, we were high on a WWII victory.  Veterans were respected, we were heros as a country (US) we saved many countries from serious trouble.  We rescued many people from gas chambers.  There were phones and electricity, cars,  Radio, TV, indoor plumbing, appliances.   I like wearing dresses and cooking and making a home.  Bad timing or what!?  I'm only sad about civil rights not being in place.    My husband just strolled in.  I asked him...he said 1758?  I yelped - outdoor toilets, no electricity, primative transporation, vigilante justiceI guess the topic didn't ignite his imagination because he stuck with his answer and strolled out.  That's ok.  He gets animated about many things that I yawn through pretending to care.  20 years of marriage, it happens...|`|x0J8S5sWaa	I've always been fascinated by the European culture in the 1700-1800's so I'd probably go back to the Regency or Victorian Era :)

DcCECelaaa	Possibly you are depressed.  Possibly you are mired in activities that don't particularly fire the engines of your motivation.  Try honing your skills at something you are good at so that you get to become absolute expert.  Some of your problems seem to be centered around self-esteem.  If you are drinking or drugging, think about quitting (if you can) because those will have a sneaky impact on the way you conduct your life and will lie to you in ways you may not immediately recognize but ultimately slow you down and bring you down.    Also improve your exercise.  Commit to some program and keep at it.  This will improve your energy level and you will find that your problems will diminish while your confidence grows.  You sound a bit stuck right now.  That's inertia.  An object at rest will remain at rest until acted upon by another force.  So get some other forces in your life going but hopefully make them ones you desire and can direct.

It is very likely that the first people you sit with at school, aren't going to be your permanent friends.

Gsqt4ODYaa	an ionic compound is something that ionizes, and comes in ionic crystals.  It has a give and take relationship.  CH4 is molecular, the C-H bonds share the electrons. K-Br is ionic.  K would much rather lose 1 electron, to go into a lower shell electron configuration, and Br wants just 1 electron to go into the high up electron configuration.  So, K gives Br its electrons.  When you put K-Br in water, it'll ionize, into just K+ ions, and Br- ions.    Example:  Table salt, sodium cholride.  NaCl.  That is an ionic compound.  Na gives it's electron to Cl so they're both happy, obeying the octet rule.  If you put this in water, it'll dissolve, and be Na+ ions, and Cl- ions.  Ionic compounds have pretty melting and boiling points, and when you dissolve them into solution, that solution has a higher boiling point, and lower melting point.  ^ thats why we put salt in snow, it'll dissolve it, because then the water bonds with the salt, and it's melting/freezing point is no longer 32 degrees farenheit, it's lower.

Thus for those remaining hours she makes 8* 1.5* x which is 12x. So 40x(the pay for the first 40  hours) + 12x (The pay for the remaining 8) is 52x, and we know that she makes 442 dollars. Thus we get the equation 52x=442 and that x=442/52 or $8.50.|`|ngfPNolpaa	40x + 8(1.5x) = 442  40x + 12x = 442  52x = 442  x = $8.50|`|oQLmfqVYaa	let cindy's regular hourly wage be x    then of the 48 hours for the :  1.first forty hours she was paid : 40x  2.next 8 hours she was paid : 8(1.5x) =12x                                           {since she earns 1.5 times her actual wage }  3. hence her total wage is :40x+12x=52x     which is equal to her paycheck     (i.e) 52x=442       => x=8.5    hence cindys regular hourly wage is $8.5

Divide the triangle in half.  Now you get 10 for the hypotenuse, 5 (half of 10) for a leg, and an unknown for the other leg (the height).  To find the height, you have to use the Pythagorean Theorem, which is a^2+b^2=c^2 with a being one leg, b being the other leg, and c being the hypotenuse.  After some plug and chug you should get the height, which is 8.66.    After you get the height, find the area of the triangle by the equation 1/2*base*height, which is (1/2)*(10)*(8.66) = 43.3 unit^2

2lrPMsIKaa	In mathematics you cannot add "2a+3b+2ab". The reason for this is that pronumeral a, b, ab are different. If it was all times, let's say  2a x 3b x 2ab. with this you can mix these pronumerals. but in addition you can't. So the answer for the first question will be "2a+3b+2ab." just the question is the answer.    and same as 5h - 2j. subtraction is same as addition so the answer will be just "5h - 2j"    I hope this information helped you.

W8F9PboZaa	I think you should definitely do it. I had a friend who did it so i'm not speaking from personal experience, but she said that hse basically did exacly the same thing as the music 1 kids except a couple of extra pieces. In turn it scaled better as well...    As with doing music full stop... well it's apparently a lot more versatile then year 10 music (if you did that). You can choose what you want to study basically. I didn't do it simply because I don't think I could have deal with the pressure. I mean having to play a piece perfectly, on cue. You stuff up and there goes your music mark. But if you choose to do say... composition over performance then it's not as bad.     Look you've done piano for 9 years. If you realize you're not enjoying it then you obviously know your stuff enough to get by, it can be an easy pass subject for you :) my friend did NO work for it an continuously went fine. And she only played for about 4 years|`|lgNr4wVIaa	Most high schools don't offer piano as a course, rather band or orchestra.  I'm a pianist myself, and I've switched instruments once in a while, and I think with my background on the piano, I'm able to learn other instruments.  I've recently taken up guitar, and it having learned piano helps.  If you're interested in music, and aren't sure you want to continue piano, you can always try a different instrument, and if you find that you miss piano, you can always go back to it.

So give it a go, you don't lose anything.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	No, not really.  I think a lot of employers view them positively.  Employers in general don't understand qualifications and what they mean.  I know that they are well received in the public sector.  I am in my sixties and was involved in the design of the very first NVQ in Retail in 1985.  After that time I became and NVQ Assessor in Administration and I.T. up to Level 4, which is supposed to be Degree level.  Because of government pressure on the agencies who assessed them, many have been passed that shouldn't have been and because I have integrity I removed myself from the situation.    When they were first designed, they were to give qualifications to people doing particular jobs who would otherwise not have had their knowledge and experience recognised.  There was no time limit intended and no college attendance required either.  They were very quickly hi-jacked by the government of the day and became time constrained and rewared organisation financially for getting people through.  I wrote to David Blunkett about my experiences and recived a standard letter saying that changes were to be made.  He didn't bother to outline the changes to me, nor did they ever happen.  I actually did an NVQ Level 3 in Administration myself in order to use it as an example to the people I was assessing.  I have the certificate to this day, although I am now retired.|`|e2e9c3a0b81436af289ac513be8ff521aa	never heard of it

shVgCizBaa	These  links might help you.Good luck.-----------------------------------...  Your essay should start with an introductory paragraph.  There are actually many different ways to begin an essay; therefore, the format of the introductory paragraph is flexible. Often, essays begin with a general introductory statement.  This statement could be an anecdote, description, striking statistic, a fact that will lead to your thesis, etc. Beginning this way, you will use the first few sentences to prepare, or "lay the groundwork" for your thesis, and use the last sentence of the first paragraph to present your thesis.  However, your thesis statement can be anywhere in your introduction.  In a longer essay, you can even wait to present your thesis until the second paragraph or later.  Also for a longer essay, you should begin to introduce a few supporting ideas in the first couple of paragraphs.  These supporting ideas should be the topics that you will discuss in full in your body paragraphs.  For a short essay, presenting supporting ideas during the introduction is optional.    Your second paragraph generally begins the body of the paper.  (For a longer paper, the body of the paper may not begin until the third paragraph or later).  This paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that introduces the first supporting idea (the support for your thesis).  You should use the middle of the paragraph to discuss your support, give examples, and analyze the significance of these examples.  Your last sentence of the body paragraph could be used to draw a conclusion for that supporting idea, or to transition into the next paragraph.    Your next two body paragraphs should follow the same format as your first body paragraph.  They should each have a separate topic sentence and supporting ideas, but the three paragraphs should work together to prove your thesis.  If you are writing a longer paper, you will have more than three body paragraphs, but they should all follow this format.    The form of your conclusion, like your introduction, is flexible.  One good way to conclude a paper is to begin the last paragraph with a statement that reflects on what has been stated and proved, without repeating it exactly.  Then you should briefly restate your key points to gently remind the reader how well you proved your thesis.  Your conclusion should end with a statement or idea that leaves a strong impression and provokes further thought. http://depts.gallaudet.edu/englishworks/... http://depts.gallaudet.edu/englishworks/...

If you leave out any sentences you should indicate this with ellipses (...) so that the reader knows you have abridged it. Be careful of using paragraphs wholesale though - try to keep quotes as pithy and relevant as you can.     There are alternatives - you could include in a reference or appedix at the back, or in a footnote - but again only if really helps your argument (rather than your word count).|`|cb48458f1fbbd2914d72b52536ffdabbaa	you can drop a line in the essay and qoute the paragraph  you might not want the entire paragraph so use an elipses (...) to cut out the bits you dont need. make sure you write the page number in brackets, and if your comparing texts write the authors name too.

Since there are so few vet schools in the US it's actually easier to get accepted to med school than vet school.    I am a vet student and I doubt that med school is any eaiser.  They learn a lot of things more in depth than we do I think.  Yes, it is difficult to have to learn all the different things about the different species.  And yes, in many instances they are vastly different especially when you're talking about things like normal blood values and normal blood pressures and heart rates.  There are many similarities though, like for the most part the skeleton is the same.  The heart is basically the same.  However, the gastrointestinal systems are very different and the muscles often have few but important differences.
9c7c4192016169baf847ee7ae4705422aa	http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/...  * The center of a histogram is the location of the data.  Literally, it is the "center of the data".  "Middle" would not be the correct term to use.    * Basically, the maker of the histogram compiles studied data that is placed on a graph in a way that best describes its purpose.  See the section below listing some of the different types of histograms.    For this reason, you are technically NOT finding the center of the histogram. You are instead "determining" your own center of the histogram in the way you deem fit to present your data.  I guess the actual question would be "What type of histogram distribution is best for me to use?"    ~~~~~~~~    * Note the words and phrases that are all caps for highlighting.    http://www.skymark.com/resources/tools/h...  Section titled "Center of a Distribution"  "Processes have A TARGET VALUE, the value that the process should be producing, where most output of the process should fall. THE CENTER of the distribution in a histogram SHOULD, in most cases, FALL on or NEAR THIS target VALUE. If it does not, the process will often need to be adjusted so that the center will hit the target value."    * Other types of distributions across a horizontal and vertical graph:    1. Standard normal distribution: this one has a very tall "center" amidst one "process".  The process is the hill-like structuring of the bars in the histogram.  2. Skewed distribution  3. Double-peaked curve distribution: this center separated two "distinct" processes  3. Truncated distribution  4. Plateau-like curve distribution  5. Outlying distribution    ~~~~~~~~    DETERMINING THE CENTER  Section titled "Specification Limits and Batch Performance"    * For a standard normal distribution (looking at the graph), there is a very noticeable center denoted by what is called a "target value".  This value is separated by a lower and an upper "specification limit", which appears to be merely based on criteria you "specify".  The very central bar of the distribution is called the "aim of the process".    * Note that the target value is not on a bar but a line drawn, as are the specification limits, and can be located within a bar because they conform not to each bar of data, but the graph in which they are placed.    ~~~~~~~~      Best of luck!

It may consist of a single sheet of paper that is printed on both sides and folded in half, in thirds, or in fourths (called a leaflet), or it may consist of a few pages that are folded in half and stapled at the crease to make a simple book. In order to count as a pamphlet, UNESCO requires a publication (other than a periodical) to have 'at least 5 but not more than 48 pages exclusive of the cover pages'[1]; a longer item is a book.    Pamphlets can contain anything from information on kitchen appliances to medical information and religious treatises. Pamphlets are very important in marketing as they are cheap to produce and can be distributed easily to customers. Pamphlets have also long been an important tool of political protest and political campaigning for similar reasons.    The storage of individual pamphlets requires special consideration because they can be easily crushed or torn when shelved alongside hardcover books. For this reason, they should either be kept in file folders in a file cabinet, or kept in boxes that have approximately the dimensions of a hardcover book and placed vertically on a shelf, not horizontally.

Here is the definition that my co-author and I used in one of our academic papers recently:    A commonly accepted description of entrepreneurship is a process of identifying, evaluating, seizing an opportunity and bringing together the resources necessary for success.   http://forum.belmont.edu/cornwall/archiv...  2.The term entrepreneur, which most people recognize as meaning someone who organizes and assumes the risk of a business in return for the profits, appears to have been introduced by Richard Cantillon (1697-1734), an Irish economist of French descent. The term came into much wider use after John Stuart Mill popularized it in his 1848 classic, Principles of Political Economy, but then all but disappeared from the economics literature by the end of the nineteenth century     http://www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/Enc/Entre...  3.An entrepreneur (a loanword from French) is a person who undertakes and operates a new enterprise or venture, and assumes some accountability for the inherent risks.  wikipedia.com

d88b5e0e8744e359146043671bd26009aa	O nacional-socialismo (nazismo) diz que uma na??o  a mxima cria??o de uma ra?a. Conseqentemente, as grandes na??es (literalmente, na??es grandes) seriam a cria??o de grandes ra?as. A teoria diz que as grandes na??es nascem do poderio militar e que este, por sua vez, se origina em culturas racionais e civilizadas, que, por sua vez ainda, s?o criadas por ra?as com boa sade natural e tra?os agressivos, inteligentes e corajosos.    As na??es mais fracas, para os nazistas, s?o aquelas criadas por ra?as impuras, isto , que n?o apresentassem a quase totalidade de indivduos de origem germanica.    De acordo com os nazistas, um erro bvio deste tipo  permitir ou encorajar mltiplas lnguas dentro de uma na??o. Esta cren?a  o motivo pelo qual os nazistas alem?es estavam t?o preocupados com a unifica??o dos territrios dos povos de lngua alem?.    Na??es incapazes de defender as suas fronteiras, diziam, seriam a cria??o de ra?as fracas ou escravas. Pensava-se que as ra?as escravas eram menos dignas de existir do que as ra?as-mestras. Em particular, se uma ra?a-mestra necessitar de espa?o para viver (Lebensraum), pensava-se que ela tinha o direito de tomar o territrio e matar ou escravizar as "ra?as escravas" indgenas.    Ra?as sem ptria eram, portanto, consideradas "ra?as parasticas". Quanto mais ricos fossem os membros da "ra?a parastica" mais virulento seria o parasitismo. Uma ra?a-mestra podia, portanto, de acordo com a doutrina nazista, endireitar-se facilmente pela elimina??o das "ra?as parasticas" da sua ptria.    Foi esta a justifica??o terica para a opress?o e elimina??o dos judeus, ciganos, eslavos e homossexuais, um dever que muitos nazis (curiosamente) consideravam repugnante.|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	por que ele achava que era uma ra?a inferior|`|20ca17f33f73be26f942800ecadd8699aa	Em raz?o de sua ideologia.  O nazismo usou de uma corrente cientfica a Eugenia, que estuda como melhorar geneticamente a espcie humana. Ela parte do princpio de que o progresso da biologia foi grande na rea da botanica. Criam plantas hbridas, obtendo maior produtividade. Porque n?o aperfei?oar o homem? Hitler percebeu que, na sociedade moderna, as pessoas menos aptas (surdos, retardados, loucos, deficientes...) tinham chances de sobreviver, pois as leis naturais que tratavam de retirar estes homens de circula??o foram superadas pela tecnologia e medicina. Hitler vai querer eliminar estes sujeitos e criar seres perfeitos dentro do padr?o ariano. Assim ele desacredita, a Eugenia pois tenta justificar o melhoramento da ra?a, matando judeus e n?o arianos puros. Como vimos Hitler vai concentrar seus argumentos na superioridade da ra?a ariana. Esta tem de ser pura, pois, quando misturada com outras ra?as entra em decadncia. Para tanto, um dos atributos do Estado  assegurar esta pureza racial da na??o a qualquer pre?o. Em uma explana??o feita por Hitler no Mein Kanff ele diz: Observando a natureza vemos que os animais somente se acasalam com membros de sua espcie.    a lei de ouro da natureza. Esta  quebrada somente por coa??es externas, como o cativeiro que vai por exemplo, justificar o acasalamento de um tigre com uma leoa. No entanto, os descendentes destes nasceriam com anomalias genticas (infertilidade). Pois a natureza segue o seu curso de aprimoramento da espcie, onde as anomalias s?o descartadas. Este processo natural, podemos ver, tambm no nosso dia-a-dia, onde os mais fracos sucumbem diante dos mais fortes. A natureza seleciona segundo for?a e sade. Os nazistas aplicaram estas idias evolucionistas de Darwin (1809-1882) ao povo ariano. Dizem eles, que, quando os arianos come?aram a entrar em contato com outros povos inferiores, decaram intelectual e fisicamente. A ra?a ariana  fundadora de civiliza??o. Os povos asiticos s?o portadores de civiliza??o, pois somente absorveram a cultura ariana. Esta concep??o, talvez, explique porque Hitler se uniu t?o facilmente aos japoneses, na Segunda Guerra. Pois, segundo ele, os japoneses s?o um povo trabalhador com forte tradi??o nacional, muito parecidos com os alem?es. J os Judeus s?o a ra?a destruidora. Somente os alem?es s?o dignos de dominar o mundo.   Ele encontra um argumento na hiptese da sele??o natural, de Darwin. Essa concep??o constitui ainda um disfarce para fun??o imperialista da ideologia fascista. Se os arianos s?o os nicos povos fundadores de civiliza??o, podem reivindicar o domnio do mundo, em virtude do seu destino divino. Esta foi uma das justificativas ideolgicas para as invas?es alem?s, principalmente em dire??o da Uni?o Sovitica. Esta grandeza racial tambm encobria interesses econ?micos do capitalismo alem?o que necessitava de mercados. Sempre no fundo de uma ideologia encontramos um teor material. Hitler vai fazer uma leitura da sociedade alem?, onde critica a mistura do sangue alem?o com o Judeu. Por isto ter acontecido  que surgiu a peste judia que tenta suplantar a ra?a ariana. A pureza racial  o maior desejo, e deve-se lutar por ela, n?o importando os meios que sejam usados. Neste contexto de superioridade racial a mulher tem importancia como produtora de novos arianos.   A mulher nazista era representada como guardi? da ra?a ariana. A pedagogia nazista para a mulher n?o ia alm, pois, de prepar-la para a maternidade. O conhecido lema dos K - kinder (crian?a), kirche (igreja), krche (cozinha). Esta vis?o muda somente em 1941, quando, devido  guerra, as mulheres s?o recrutadas para trabalhar nas industrias. Em 1935 s?o criadas as Lebesborn, lugares onde acontecia verdadeira reprodu??o humana em escala industrial. Seu objetivo geral era incrementar a expans?o da ra?a ariana atravs do controle biolgico alm da educa??o das chamadas crian?as SS.   Estes Lesbsborn, no incio, tambm eram creches. Mais tarde, m?es solteiras come?aram deixar seus filhos ali. Outras que entravam dentro dos requisitos raciais (arianas puras) engravidavam dos SS para terem futuros soldados. Outra temtica decorrente da superioridade racial  o Espa?o vital . Os historiadores nazistas, diziam que a prpria apontava para um fato que  a motriz da histria. Este fato  a luta entre dois povos desiguais pelo seu espa?o vital. Pois quando um povo se multiplica, precisa de um habitat fsico maior, surgindo assim as guerras territoriais.

d6cf6febf993de303759383d4e524648aa	Hi, Bugs Bunny is a fictional street-smart gray rabbit who appears in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons produced by Warner Bros.  He was "born" in 1940 in Brooklyn, New York and the product of many fathers: Ben "Bugs" Hardaway (who created a prototypical version of the character called Happy Rabbit in 1938's "Porky's Hare Hunt"), Bob Clampett, Tex Avery (who developed Bugs' definitive personality in 1940), Robert McKimson (created the definitive Bugs Bunny character design), Chuck Jones, and Friz Freleng. According to Mel Blanc, his original voice actor, his accent is an equal blend of someone from the Bronx and someone from Brooklyn    A number of animation historians believe Bugs Bunny to have been influenced by an earlier Disney character called Max Hare. Max, designed by Charlie Thorson, first appeared in the Silly Symphony The Tortoise and the Hare, directed by Wilfred Jackson. The story was based on a fable by Aesop and cast Max against Toby Tortoise, and won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film for 1934. Max also appeared in the sequel Toby Tortoise Returns and the Mickey Mouse cartoon Mickey's Polo Team.    The only solid connection between Max and Bugs however is Charlie Thorson. He was also responsible for the redesign of Bugs from a white to a gray rabbit for his third appearance Hare-um Scare-um, thus the similarity in design.|`|7061b4a8289aa7d3f406307de8d139baaa	With pencil and paper.|`|0a126cd214b317b308c02f389e0dc62caa	some one that was REALLY bord was sitting, ad just thought "hey!

In effect this changes the question to: "Which came first, a chicken or any egg".    From a cellular biology point of view this question can be answered quite easily. The egg came first because any female sex cell is called an egg.    If the egg is defined structurally as the hard shelled thing, and the chicken a feather covered animal, the answer is still simple. Evolutionary scientists believe the first hard shell egg was the amniotic egg laid around 300 million years ago, and was laid by the animal who was the link between amphibians and reptiles. One of the first dinosaurs that we know had feathers was the Archaeopteryx, and came much later. Modern birds would not arise until 150 million years ago, descending from theropod dinosaurs.    In this case, the first chicken must have been the mutated offspring of a proto-chicken that laid the egg containing the first true chicken. In any case, this creature hatched from a recognizable egg. After all, the question is purposefully ambiguous -- it is not, "Which came first, the chicken or the chicken egg?"    The crux of the matter is how to biologically define 'a chicken'. What level of genetic similarity or structural similarity determine whether an organism is a chicken? One can only define what was the first chicken after the fact, thus any definition of the first chicken becomes arbitrary. The question 'which came first?' ignores the complicated reality of speciation. The concept of species is an abstraction intended to categorize a broad swath of genomes and their subsequent phenomes. If one were to do away with approximate categories, each individual 'chicken' actually represents a unique genotype. Under this definition, if a 'chicken' possessing genome A were to lay an egg possessing genome B, then an egg of genome B is antecedent to an animal possessing genome B and that the parent--genome A--is antecedent to, yet different from the egg of genome B. Hence, in an absolute sense, the egg came before the 'chicken.'    According to the principles of speciation, neither the chicken nor the egg came first, because speciation does not occur in simple, obvious units. In fact, evolution is about a slow transition in an overall population. What qualifies as chicken (ignoring the many diverse modern types of chicken) involves a wide range of genetic traits (alleles) that are not encompassed in a single individual and continue to be modified from generation to generation.    The transition from non-chicken to chicken is a grey area in which several generations are involved, and therefore which includes many many chicken-and-egg events, with no one step representing the whole. Since the result of the process is an incomplete transition into various new characteristics rather than one single blueprint, a new species, "chicken", is only identified in hindsight when the species can be obviously identified as different from its ancestral stock.|`|25726d198f79279b331039980ce212f6aa	O galo, antes do ovo o galo pegou a galinha, a veio o ovo e n?o parou mais.

O curso de Sistemas de Informa??o tem uma abordagem um pouco menos acadmica, por assim dizer. Alm das matrias especficas de computa??o, o aluno ainda paga matrias de administra??o e, dependendo da grade, at psicologia e sociologia. O objetivo do curso  formar um profissional capaz de entender a tecnologia e aplic-la numa organiza??o para torn-la melhor. O que n?o quer dizer que ele n?o possa fazer mestrado, doutorado e ser cientista.  J Cincias da Computa??o  mais voltado para a rea de Informtica mesmo: mais matrias de clculo, lgebra, etc. O objetivo principal , como o nome j diz, formar cientistas. O que tambm n?o quer dizer que o estudante n?o possa se dar bem no mercado. Ele s ter que se esfor?ar um pouco mais, porque a carga terica do curso  muito forte.  Eu, por gostar de humanas e exatas, preferi SI.

AA11053310	The first law of thermodynamics is a generalized axiom of nature in relation to the conservation of energy. The most common enunciation of first law of thermodynamics is:        The increase in the internal energy of a thermodynamic system is equal to the amount of heat energy added to the system minus the work done by the system on the surroundings.         Contents [hide]  1 History   2 Mathematical formulation   3 Reversible processes   4 Force-functions   5 Application for open systems   6 Sign convention   6.1 Physics and Chemistry   6.2 Thermodynamics and Engineering   7 See also   8 References   9 External links          [edit]  History  The first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics was given by Rudolf Clausius in 1850: "There is a state function E, called energy, whose differential equals the work exchanged with the surroundings during an adiabatic process."    [edit]  Mathematical formulation  The mathematical statement of the first law is given by:       where dU is the infinitesimal increase in the internal energy of the system, Q is the infinitesimal amount of heat added to the system, and W is the infinitesimal amount of work done by the system on the surroudings. The infinitesimal heat and work are denoted by  rather than d because, in mathematical terms, they are inexact differentials rather than exact differentials. In other words, they do not describe the state of any system.    The integral of an inexact differential is path dependent, i.e. it depends upon the particular "path" taken through the space of thermodynamic parameters while the integral of an exact differential depends only upon the initial and final states. If the initial and final states are the same, then the integral of an inexact differential may or may not be zero, but the integral of an exact differential will always be zero. The path taken by a thermodynamic system through state space is known as a thermodynamic process.    [edit]  Reversible processes  An expression of the first law can be written in terms of exact differentials by realizing that the work that a system does is equal to its pressure times the infinitesimal change in its volume. In other words, W = pdV where p is pressure and V is volume. For a reversible process, the total amount of heat added to a system can be expressed as Q = TdS where T is temperature and S is entropy. For a reversible process, the first law may now be restated:       In the case where the number of particles in the system is not necessarily constant and may be of different types, the first law is written:       where dNi is the (small) number of type-i particles added to the system, and i is the amount of energy added to the system when one type-i particle is added, where the energy of that particle is such that the volume and entropy of the system remains unchanged. i is known as the chemical potential of the type-i particles in the system. The statement of the first law for reversible processes, using exact differentials is now:       [edit]  Force-functions  A useful idea, introduced by Willard Gibbs in 1876, is that quantities such as internal energy U and Helmholtz free energy A may be regarded as a kind of force-function. For example, the energy gained by a particle is equal to the force applied to the particle multiplied by the displacement of the particle while that force is applied. Now consider the first law without the heating term: dU = pdV. The pressure p can be viewed as a force (and in fact has units of force per unit area) while dV is the displacement (with units of distance times area). We may say, with respect to this work term, that a pressure difference forces a transfer of volume, and that the product of the two (work) is the amount of energy transferred as a result of the process.    Thermodynamic equations   Laws of thermodynamics   Conjugate variables   Pressure / Volume   (Stress/Strain)   Temperature / Entropy   Chem. potential / Particle no.    Thermodynamic potentials   Material properties   Maxwell relations   Bridgman's equations   Exact differential   edit   It is useful to view the TdS term in the same light: With respect to this heat term, a temperature difference forces a transfer of entropy, and the product of the two (heat) is the amount of energy transferred as a result of the process. Here, the temperature is known as a "generalized" force (rather than an actual mechanical force) and the entropy is a generalized displacement.    Similarly, a difference in chemical potential between groups of particles in the system forces a transfer of particles, and the corresponding product is the amount of energy transferred as a result of the process. For example, consider a system consisting of two phases: liquid water and water vapor. There is a generalized "force" of evaporation which drives water molecules out of the liquid. There is a generalized "force" of condensation which drives vapor molecules out of the vapor. Only when these two "forces" (or chemical potentials) are equal will there be equilibrium, and the net transfer will be zero.    The two thermodynamic parameters which form a generalized force-displacement pair are termed "conjugate variables". The two most familiar pairs are, of course, pressure-volume, and temperature-entropy.    [edit]  Application for open systems  In open systems, matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries. The first law of thermodynamics for open systems states: the increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating, minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system. The |`|b08a5955429a8f2e65cabfc1c05deedbaa	thats cannot be proved perfectly thats why its still the first law.  take the case of a black Hole . tremendous amount of energy goes in it then what happens . then the parallel universe theory comes that states that energy balances in parallel universes.  finally the big bang theory says time does not exist before big band then so is energy . because energy goes in a axis of time . and then they say the universe is constantly expanding from which energy !  after all this you loose your head and you see you lost all your energy .|`|ba51d82f190275153d2c0c6240d4f6f6aa	Theory of Relativity (E=mc^2) proves that the energy of the universe is constant and conserved. It is in perfect equilibrium. An addition of one electron or one packet of energy will collapse the entire universe. This symmetry is what is puzzling scientists (even the most intelligent Stephen Hawkins)  The other way of explaining is,  where will the additional energy come from. It has to either come from within in the form of mass or outside universe. There is nothing called outside universe as the concept of space is lost with the universe|`|033942884cf78d75006ee09a51750878aa	by joules experiment

There is a college in Malaysia which offers affilated degree programs of various Universities (from US, UK, NZ, Australia etc.).  They have Aeronoticals Bach. program....Living cost+Tuition fees won't be more than Rs. 300000.  Earning while studies will be around Rs. 75000.........and I can bet that if you go anywhere in India for studies, you have to spend this amount.  Plus they also offer transfer...Means if you are in Aeronotical program of Oxford Brooks University of UK.........You can finish 1 year in Malaysia and remaining 2 in UK OR 2 in Malaysia and 1 in UK....  Goodluck buddy....|`|ba51d82f190275153d2c0c6240d4f6f6aa	In India the best place to study Aero is MIT (Chromepet). They have an M.Tech - Aero.

Try to learn 2 or 3 different careers because over your life span you will change careers several times.  Learn as much as you can while you are young so if that day comes when you have to change careers then you can look for job in a field that you trained for when you were young..  The more you learn now, the more doors will open in your life..  If you can of on to college then keep on going until you complete college..  I hope you understand what I'm trying to explain to you...   Good Luck..

6942c4deedcaa5ade24adb1ce5c8bf61aa	Por que janeiro  janeiro, fevereiro  fevereiro, e assim por diante? Qual a origem desses nomes? Pois , eles s?o do primeiro calendrio romano criado por R?mulo, em 753 a.C.     Naquela poca, o calendrio s tinha dez meses e come?ava em mar?o! Foi o segundo rei de Roma, Numa Pumplio (700 a.C.?  673 a.C.), quem acrescentou mais 2 meses no incio do ano e resolveu dar nome aos bois. Os meses mais antigos permaneceram com seus nomes originais e, mais tarde, alguns foram trocados para homenagear o imperador Csar Augusto:    Janeiro - O nome  uma homenagem ao deus romano Jano, guardi?o do universo e o deus dos incios.    Fevereiro - Referncia ao festival romano Februlia (onde ocorria rituais de purifica??o).    Mar?o - Mais uma homenagem a um deus, dessa vez  Marte, deus da guerra.    Abril - Existem duas vers?es para a origem do nome desse ms: a primeira  uma homenagem  Afrodite, deusa do amor e da beleza; a segunda  a de que o nome tenha vindo do latim aperire, uma referncia ao desabrochar das flores, j que em abril  primavera no hemisfrio norte..    Maio - Homenagem  deusa romana Maia, m?e do deus Mercrio.    Junho - Mais uma deusa sendo homenageada: deusa Juno, protetora das mulheres e da maternidade.    Julho - O nome desse ms  uma homenagem ao imperador Jlio Csar. Antes da entrada dos meses de janeiro e fevereiro era chamado de quintillis, por ser o quinto ms.    Agosto - Agora  a vez dos imperadores: homenagem ao imperador Csar Augusto! Era chamado de sextillis, o sexto ms.     J setembro, outubro, novembro e dezembro vm do antigo calendrio de Numa Pumplio:     Setembro - Vem do latim septem (sete), o stimo ms.     Outubro - Do latim octo (oito), o oitavo ms.

3f5b06d4685ddbe4c2ec7480c710f02baa	Tabla cronolgica: historia de la hamburguesa     Siglo XIV   Tribus mongoles y turcas pican en tiras la carne de ganado asitico de baja calidad para que sea ms comestible. La receta llega a Alemania a travs de los trtaros de origen ruso (Steak Tartar) que emigran a Alemania, donde la carne se condimenta con especias y la cocinan o la comen cruda.     1834   En el mtico restaurante Demonico's de Nueva York se encuentra la primera carta de men en la que aparece el "filete de Hamburgo" (Hamburg Steak).     1885    Charlie Nagreen de Wisconsin (EEUU) mont un puesto de comida que venda bolas de carne. El negocio no iba del todo bien y pronto hay una solucin aplastando la pelota de carne y metindola entre dos panes de sandwich para que fuera ms fcil de comer.     1891    Otto Kuasw, un cocinero del puerto de Hamburgo (Alemania), elabor un sandwich que haca las delicias de los marineros y consista en un filete de hamburguesa de vacuno frito en mantequilla con un huevo frito encima y entre dos panes tostados.     1894    Los marineros que haban comido el sandwich de Otto en Hamburgo y visitaban el puerto de Nueva York contaban a los propietarios de los restaurantes los magnficos sandwiches del cocinero alemn y los restaurantes empezaron a servir los sandwiches que demandaban los marineros. Se cuenta que los marinos pedan el sandwich por el nombre de "Hamburguesa".     1904    Se presenta en la Feria Mundial de San Luis el plato que revolucionar la cocina americana. Fletch Davis (Texas, EEUU), ms conocido como el "viejo Dave", es conocido por ser el "verdadero" inventor de la hamburguesa a?adiendo entre los dos panes tostados un filete de hamburguesa vacuna con un poco de cebolla fresca.      1921    El cocinero Walter A. Anderson y el corredor de seguros E. W. Ingram fundan la primera cadena de hamburgueseras White Castle en Wichita (Kansas, EEUU) .     1931    La cadena de hamburgueseras White Castle comienza a congelar los filetes de hamburguesa tal y como se hace en los restaurantes de hamburguesas en la actualidad.      1932    White Castle promociona por primera vez sus hamburguesas con "vales descuento" en el que se ofrecan 5 hamburguesas por el precio de 2. La campa?a fu todo un xito.      1954    Nace el primer restaurante Burger King fundado por James McLamore y David Edgerton.      1955    Mc Donalds abre su primer restaurante en Des Plaines (Illinois, EEUU)      2005   Friends burger bar abre su primer restaurante al paso en Arstides Villanueva 250(Mendoza, ARGENTINA).

Su origen, hoy en da es disputado ya que diferentes comarcas de los Estados Unidos reclaman ser los inventores de la hamburguesa moderna.

De esta forma Charlie coloca la carne entre dos rebanadas de pan, denominndola Hamburguesa.

They used to give Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood, but now they (the Indians) just call everyone Indian wannabies.  They're rude  and unaccepting of us.  OH yeah, the mormom churches have records of all our ancestors and will help you look yours up and just charge you per page to print it.  They are entirely about the Indians being the original last possessors of Abrahams heritage chart.  The book of morman explains how the American Indians got here.  Very interesting stuff.|`|8911c80abbc48473f697e51a069ac75eaa	which 'Indian'? Although Im going to assume from the nature of the question you mean American.

They featured on eon Oprah where she thought she was descended from Indians all her life and then they checked her genes and researched her family in the area and it turns out some relative married a Chinese coolie. (Although that Asiatic thing is similar) So a mix of researching the history of your family, the areas they lived, and finally hiring a company to look at you genetically.|`|9396404b70399e8f199e960489cb8be3aa	birth certificate, last name, parents name, passport from India|`|834de7045d60c7a4d20d8fd281575662aa	Look on line. You'll need as much information as you can get together on your family. You'll need names, birthdates, where they lived and died, brothers, sisters, children, mother, father, where buried, and so on. Anything you can gather, before you start looking. It also helps to know what tribe. There's some free sites on line you can access for ancestor data with the information you get. The Bureau of Indian Affairs will have data also on line. They kept excellent records. But it works best if you start from the present and try to make your way backwards through the years. Good luck.

Mistress Mary, quite contrary,  How does your garden grow?  With silver bells and cockle shells  And pretty maids all in a row.    A dillar, a dollar  A ten oclock scholar,  What makes you come so soon?  You used to come at ten oclock,  And now you come at noon.    Mondays child is fair of face  Tuesdays child is full of grace  Wednesdays child is full of woe  Thursdays child has far to go  Fridays child is honest and giving  Saturdays child works hard for its living;  But the child thats born on the Sabbath day,  Is blithe and bonny, and good, and gay.    There was a little girl and she had a curl  Right in the middle of her forehead.  When she was good, she was very, very good,  But when she was bad she was horrid.    Needles and pins, needles and pins  When a man marries his trouble begins.  (refers to 'pin money' - a wife's allowance)    Hey, diddle, diddle!  The cat and the fiddle,  The cow jumped over the moon;  The little dog laughed to see such sport,  And the dish ran away with the spoon.    Ride a cockhorse to Banbury Cross,  To see a fine lady upon a white horse.  Rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes,  She shall have music wherever she goes.      What are little boys made of?  What are little boys made of?  Snakes and snails and puppy-dogs tails;  And thats what little boys are made of.    What are little girls made of?  What are little girls made of?  Sugar and spice and all things nice;  And thats what little girls are made of.      Ring a ring o roses  A pocket full of posies.  Tisha, tisha  We all fall down      Ladybird, Ladybird, fly away home  Your house is on fire  Your children are burning.      Cross patch,  Draw the latch,  Sit by the fire and spin;  Take a cup and drink it up,  And call you neighbors in.      The north wind doth blow,  We soon shall have snow,  And what will poor Robin do then?  Poor thing!  Hell sit in a barn,  To keep himself warm,  And hide his head under his wing.

6d1af90d5e524ce180236011e926872daa	Wow, the GRE is tough.  Especially now that they require an essay.  The best thing I can tell you is to try and use mnemonic devices and flash cards.  I know the flash cards sound silly but they work!  Do a little bit each day, but not too much.  They say that you knew more yesterday than you do today, because your brain can only remember so many things at once.  So anywho, just keep at it, a little each day, and you'll do fine.    Good Luck!|`|f728e94b65d843c5fb54f38880df0092aa	Music.  Ever wonder why it's so easy to remember song lyrics?  Because of the music.  take the words, write a rap that includes them all - sing it every morning.  You'll never forget it.|`|dc7a9ea48cccff9a51a8da7bf4da491eaa	Here is a way. Take a word Kill and find all words that can describe it...like patricide, matricide, massacre, decapitate etc. This is one helpful way.   Also read the roots of the maximum words as most of the words are derived from Latin or greek. It is helpful if you start by knowing the roots as you can remember words very easily or atleast breakdown and get an idea. like for example decapitate, capitate you can relate as head and de out, so you can safely conclude that decapitate is cutting the head off etc.    And never feel shy to  use those words in your conversation. this helps a lot as you might remember certain instance that you can remember with the word.    Read read and read anything and everything. While reading, underline those words you are not familiar with and immediately run for a dictionary. Even hear for words that you dont seem to know while hearing to NEWS etc. This is has been one of the productive way for me.     Other ways of using flash cards and writing down while you read also help.

Therefore the average speed you need to maintain is   42/1.15 = 36.5mph.    You may wish to recalculate based on the above, as my answers are up to one decinal place.

Meanwhile - Hamlets mother marries Hamlets Uncle (the one who killer her husband) and becomes king.  The play is about hamlet and how he goes about catching his uncle as the killer while others question his sanity.  There are other side stories about Ophelia and her love of Hamlet, Horatio, etc.  This is the shortest summary I could give you - the links above will give you a more complete summar of the whole play.|`|6df85ebc244ca052530acc0880ae2829aa	http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/t...|`|AA10705411	Go to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet it'll explain a lot.

Vamos lembrar rapidamente o que  palavra oxtona, paroxtona e proparoxtona.      Palavra oxtona  aquela cuja slaba t?nica  a ltima. Exemplo: "caf".     Paroxtona  aquela palavra cuja slaba t?nica  a penltima. "Lata", por exemplo.     A lgica das regras de acentua??o  a exclus?o. Acentua-se o que  mais raro.     Todas as paroxtonas terminadas em "r" s?o acentuadas e, portanto, nenhuma oxtona terminada em "r" deve ser acentuada. Nesse caso, basta lembrar que todos os verbos s?o terminados em "r" (falar, beber, bater, ouvir, chorar, comer...). Todos s?o palavras oxtonas.    Quanto s proparoxtonas, veja o exemplo que Chico Buarque nos traz em "Constru??o".    Amou daquela vez como se fosse a ltima  Beijou sua mulher como se fosse a ltima  E cada filho seu como se fosse o nico  E atravessou a rua com seu passo tmido    Subiu a constru??o como se fosse mquina  Ergueu no patamar quatro paredes slidas  Tijolo com tijolo num desenho mgico  Seus olhos embotados de cimento e lgrima    Observe que os versos terminam sempre em palavras proparoxtonas, ou seja, naquelas cuja slaba t?nica  a antepenltima.     o caso de "ltima", "nico", "tmido", "mquina", "slidas", "mgico", e "lgrima". As proparoxtonas s?o as palavras mais raras da nossa lngua; por isso todas s?o acentuadas.     Chico Buarque teve muito trabalho para escolher, entre palavras que j s?o raras, aquelas que coubessem nos seus versos. O sistema de acentua??o da nossa lngua  muito bem feito.

7061b4a8289aa7d3f406307de8d139baaa	We can make a few assumptions about this triangle that should help.    1)It's a right triangle; that is, there is at least one 90 degree angle (the bamboo growing out of the ground).    2)We know one side is 16 cubits long (the distance between the base of the bamboo and where the broken part touches the ground.)    3)We know the sum of the other two sides is 32 cubits (since the same piece of bamboo comprises both sides).    Due to the Pythagorean Theorem, a^2 + b^2 = c^2. If a is the side we know, that makes a^2=256. We can also say that c=(16-b).    This gives the single-variable formula   256 + (b^2) = (16-b)^2    From here you should be able to use algebra to find the answer.

25001e87d4c9586b55551c78c4d6e19caa	Muy buena pregunta. Felicitaciones.    Ante todo, no podemos dejar de mencionar que es el episodio histrico del Siglo XXI... luego de que en el 2000 todos esperaban el supuesto apocalipsis.    En fin el 11-S es como en todos lados se menciona el da en que cambio la historia del mundo.    Muchos tomaron ms conciencia sobre los intereses radicados en otros pases que no se tenan en cuenta, de hecho se comenzaron a interiorizar por ello. Lgico NUNCA hubo un atentado de sta ndole y eso es lo que hace caracterstico a ese perodo.    Hoy se sigue rememorando y cada vez con ms nfasis lo sucedido, ?por qu? Primero que nada, muchos siguen buscando las causas y a travs de realizaciones de peliculas y tesis y analisis buscan la verda, buscan un indicio sobre lo que pas aunque ya haya pasado y todos estemos en conocimiento.    Esto se trata de ver entre lineas sobre lo que pas... hay cosas claves que no se descubrieron todava y hasta que eso no se resuelva y las partes no se reunan cara a cara -COSA QUE JAMAS VA A SUCEDER- la poblacin es sacrificada en nombre de Al y en consecuencia a ello familias destruidas, sobrevivientes con secuelas psicologicas irrecuperables.    Una vez ms el capitalismo encapsulado en creencias religiosas se hace presente. Un lindo tema para analizar.    Recomiendo que si podes vayas a las muestras sobre lo que pas y veas las palculas y si te gusta y te da placer leer leas temas referidos sobre la estructura geopoltica donde habita Bin Laden.    Un saludo.    Flor..*|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	Que Dios nuestro se?or bendiga a todos los afectados de una manera u otra, que les de fuerza para poder superar tan semejante trageda.

Tuve la oportunidad de visitar "GROUND ZERO" para el mes de mayo. An se persive en el aire el temor y la vulnerabilidad. Cuando estas all parado no se puede evitar imaginar lo que sintieron las personas involucradas; para m fue y seguir siendo un recuerdo muy triste...|`|cc44d74158aaa435e3c26733855b7287aa	Yo voy a compartir con todos lo que un dia recibi por email luego de los ataques a las torres gemelas. Aqui les va:    CASUALIDAD O NO ES MUUUUUUCHA COINCIDENCIA, NO CREIS?    1) New York City tiene 11 letras.  2) Afganistn tiene 11 letras.  3) Ramsin Yuseb (El terrorista que amenaz con destruir las Torres Gemelas en 1993) tiene 11 letras.  4) George W Bush tiene 11 letras.    Esto puede ser pura coincidencia, pero ahora se pone ms interesante:    1) New York es el estado numero 11.  2) El primer avin que se estrell contra las Torres Gemelas fue vuelo numero 11.  3) El vuelo numero 11 llevaba 92 pasajeros. 9 + 2 = 11  4) El vuelo numero 77 tambin se estrell contra las Torres Gemelas, y llevaba 65 pasajeros. 6+5 = 11  5) La tragedia sucedi el 11 de Septiembre, o mejor dicho 9/11. 9 + 1+ 1 = 11  6) El da es igual al nmero de emergencia de la polica en Estados Unidos 911.         9 + 1 + 1 = 11.    Pura coincidencia??? Sigue leyendo y ya me contaras.    1) El nmero total de vctimas dentro de todos los aviones fue de 254. 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.  2) El 11 de Septiembre es el da 254 del calendario. Otra vez 2 + 5 + 4= 11.  3) Las explosiones de Madrid sucedieron el da 3/11/2004. 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11.  4) La tragedia de Madrid sucedi 911 das despus del incidente de las Torres Gemelas.    Bueno, ahora es cuando la cosa se pone ms misteriosa. Uno de los smbolos mas reconocidos de Estados Unidos, despus de las Estrellas y las Rayas, es el guila.     La siguiente estrofa ha sido sacada del Corn, el libro sagrado Islamita:    "Por que se ha escrito que el hijo de Arabia despertar a una terrible guila. La fuerza del guila se sentir por todas las tierras de Ala y lo, mientras algunas personas temblaran en  desesperacin pero en el fondo se alegrarn: por que la fuerza del guila limpiar las tierras de Ala y habr paz."    sa estrofa es la numero 9.11 del Corn,    Todava no ests convencido....?! Intenta lo siguiente y luego me cuentas, a m se me ha puesto el pelo de punta!!!!:    Abre el Microsoft Word y haz lo siguiente:  1) Escribe en mayscula Q33 NY. ste es el nmero de vuelo del primer avin que se estrell contra las Torres  Gemelas.  2) Selecciona el texto Q33 NY.  3) Cambia la fuente de la letra a Wingdings.      Y AHORA QUE PIENSAS??????

6ad34dfb56f21b7fd18fb9640523b48eaa	Ida B. Wells has been described as a crusader for justice, and as a defender of democracy. Wells was characterized as a militant and uncompromising leader for her efforts to abolish lynching and establish racial equality. Wells challenged segregation decades before Rosa Parks, ran for Congress and attended suffrage meetings with the likes of Susan B. Anthony and Jane Addams, yet most of her efforts are largely unknown due to the fact that she is African American and female.     Ida B. Wells was born July 16, 1862 in Holly Springs, Mississippi, during the second year of the Civil War (Sterling 61). Her parents, James and Elizabeth Wells, were slaves, and thus Wells, a woman who devoted her life to promoting racial equality, was born a slave. It was from her parents that Wells developed an interest in politics and her unwavering dedication to achieving set goals. After emancipation, Jim Wells became heavily involved in politics. He was a member of the Loyal League (a local black political organization), he attended public "speakings" on the steps of the courthouse, and campaigned for local black political candidates (Sterling 65). Jim Wells' fervent interest in racial justice and political activism no doubt inspired his daughter's later interest in these same issues. Elizabeth Wells was a religious woman and a strict disciplinarian who dictated a strong work ethic. Both Jim and Elizabeth Wells emphasized the importance of education. After the Civil War, 90% of blacks were illiterate. Emancipation brought about the legalization of Negro education, and shortly thereafter, Negro schools were established throughout the south. Shaw University was established in Holly Springs in 1866 to provide education for the large, rural black community of the area (Duster 9). Wells along with her siblings and her mother (who wanted to learn to read the bible) attended Shaw University. She notes in her autobiography that "our job was to go to school and learn all we could" (Duster 9). During her years at Shaw, Wells developed an intense love of words. She reportedly read every book in the school library, from the novels of Louisa May Alcott and Charles Dickens to the Oliver Optic stores, a series of popular books for boys (Sterling 65). Early on in her education, Wells discovered a bias. At Shaw she learned mainly European history, and Wells notes in her autobiography that "I had read the bible and Shakespeare through, but I had never read a Negro book or anything about Negroes" (Duster 22).     In 1878, Wells' life changed forever, as a yellow fever epidemic swept through the region, claiming the lives of both her parents and a younger sibling (Sterling 66). Wells was visiting her grandmother's farm when the epidemic hit, and she was urged to remain in the country until the epidemic subsided. However, her devotion to her family prompted her to return home despite the warnings of doctors. In her autobiography Wells recalls her feelings at the time of the tragedy, "the conviction grew within me that I ought to be with them... I am going home. I am the oldest of seven living children. There's nobody but me to look after them now" (Duster 12). Determined to keep the family together, Wells refused all attempts at splitting up her remaining siblings. Instead, she insisted on caring for her five siblings, despite the fact that she was 16, unemployed and poor. At the urging of the local Masonic lodge where her father was a member, she applied for a teaching position in the country. She adjusted her appearance so as to look older than her mere 16 years. She passed the qualifying examine and was given a position six miles away. Friends and relatives stayed with the Wells children during the week when Ida was away at school. In her autobiography, Wells describes the burden of her dual role and caretaker and provider, "I came home every Friday afternoon, riding the six miles on the back of a big mule. I spent Saturday and Sunday washing and ironing and cooking for the children and went back to my country school on Sunday afternoon" (Duster 17).     In 1883, Wells moved 40 miles north to Memphis at the urging of her aunt Fannie, who promised ample opportunity for employment and offered to care for Wells' two younger sisters (Duster xvi). Wells accepted the offer, and shortly after her arrival in Memphis, she found employment at a school in Woodstock, Tennessee, about 10 miles outside the city. During her summer vacations, Wells took teachers' training courses at Fisk University and at Lemoyne Institute. By the fall of 1884 she had qualified to teach in the city schools and was assigned a first grade class where she taught for seven years(Sterling 67).     Wells' career as a writer was sparked by an incident that occurred on May 4, 1884. On this day, while riding a train back to her job in Woodstock, Wells was asked by the conductor to move from her seat in the ladies' car to the front of the train into the smoking car. When she refused, the conductor attempted to physically remove her from her seat. It took three men to remove Wells from her seat, and rather than move to the smoking car, she got off at the next stop to the cheers of the white passengers on the train (Duster 18). When Wells got back to Memphis, she immediately hired a lawyer to bring suit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company. The court returned a verdict in favor of Wells and awarded her $500 in damages. The judge presiding over the trail stated the railroad company violated the separate but equal clause by forcing blacks to ride in smoking car that was separate but not first class, as Wells had paid for. The railroad appealed the verdict and in 1887, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court, and Wells was ordered to pay court costs. The was the first case of its kind in the south and it generated tremendous public interest. Thrilled with her victory and eager to share her story, Wel|`|aa596673c4a4b7827a51695b15eb9ae8aa	http://lkwdpl.org/wihohio/barn-ida.htm|`|AA10980727	Ida B. Wells-Barnett     Ida B. Wells-Barnett   Ida Bell Wells-Barnetts life was dedicated to ending horrible injustices against African-Americans. She traveled the country, speaking and writing about civil rights issues, unfair laws, and crimes against blacks. As more and more civil rights laws were ignored by society in the late 1800s, she became increasingly involved in politics to stop the trend of social injustice. She was instrumental in the fight against lynching, proving that these acts were essentially murders of innocent black men, women, and children, and boldly demanded that their white murderers be held responsible for their crimes. Later in life, she also founded or was involved in the creation of several organizations encouraging the advancement of women and other minorities.|`|53c69bbc3b0414458df879b69ab9d916aa	Ida B. Wells-Barnett was a fearless anti-lynching crusader, suffragist, women's rights advocate, journalist, and speaker. She stands as one of our nation's most uncompromising leaders and most ardent defenders of democracy. She was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi in 1862 and died in Chicago, Illinois 1931 at the age of sixty-nine.     Although enslaved prior to the Civil War, her parents were able to support their seven children because her mother was a "famous" cook and her father was a skilled carpenter. When Ida was only fourteen, a tragic epidemic of Yellow Fever swept through Holly Springs and killed her parents and youngest sibling. Emblematic of the righteousness, responsibility, and fortitude that characterized her life, she kept the family together by securing a job teaching. She managed to continue her education by attending near-by Rust College. She eventually moved to Memphis to live with her aunt and help raise her youngest sisters.     It was in Memphis where she first began to fight (literally) for racial and gender justice. In 1884 she was asked by the conductor of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Company to give up her seat on the train to a white man and ordered her into the smoking or "Jim Crow" car, which was already crowded with other passengers. Despite the 1875 Civil Rights Act banning discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or color, in theaters, hotels, transports, and other public accommodations, several railroad companies defied this congressional mandate and racially segregated its passengers. It is important to realize that her defiant act was before Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), the U.S. Supreme Court decision that established the fallacious doctrine of "separate but equal," which constitutionalized racial segregation. Wells wrote in her autobiography:     I refused, saying that the forward car [closest to the locomotive] was a smoker, and as I was in the ladies' car, I proposed to stay. . . [The conductor] tried to drag me out of the seat, but the moment he caught hold of my arm I fastened my teeth in the back of his hand. I had braced my feet against the seat in front and was holding to the back, and as he had already been badly bitten he didn't try it again by himself. He went forward and got the baggageman and another man to help him and of course they succeeded in dragging me out.   Wells was forcefully removed from the train and the other passengers--all whites--applauded. When Wells returned to Memphis, she immediately hired an attorney to sue the railroad. She won her case in the local circuit courts, but the railroad company appealed to the Supreme Court of Tennessee, and it reversed the lower court's ruling. This was the first of many struggles Wells engaged, and from that moment forward, she worked tirelessly and fearlessly to overturn injustices against women and people of color.     Her suit against the railroad company also sparked her career as a journalist. Many papers wanted to hear about the experiences of the 25-year-old school teacher who stood up against white supremacy. Her writing career blossomed in papers geared to African American and Christian audiences.     In 1889 Wells became a partner in the Free Speech and Headlight. The paper was also owned by Rev. R. Nightingale-- the pastor of Beale Street Baptist Church. He "counseled" his large congregation to subscribe to the paper and it flourished, allowing her to leave her position as an educator.     In 1892 three of her friends were lynched. Thomas Moss, Calvin McDowell, and Henry Stewart. These three men were owners of People's Grocery Company, and their small grocery had taken away customers from competing white businesses. A group of angry white men thought they would "eliminate" the competition so they attacked People's grocery, but the owners fought back, shooting one of the attackers. The owners of People's Grocery were arrested, but a lynch-mob broke into the jail, dragged them away from town, and brutally murdered all three. Again, this atrocity galvanized her mettle. She wrote in The Free Speech     The city of Memphis has demonstrated that neither character nor standing avails the Negro if he dares to protect himself against the white man or become his rival. There is nothing we can do about the lynching now, as we are out-numbered and without arms. The white mob could help itself to ammunition without pay, but the order is rigidly enforced against the selling of guns to Negroes. There is therefore only one thing left to do; save our money and leave a town which will neither protect our lives and property, nor give us a fair trial in the courts, but takes us out and murders us in cold blood when accused by white persons.   Many people took the advice Wells penned in her paper and left town; other members of the Black community organized a boycott of white owned business to try to stem the terror of lynchings. Her newspaper office was destroyed as a result of the muckraking and investigative journalism she pursued after the killing of her three friends. She could not return to Memphis, so she moved to Chicago. She however continued her blistering journalistic attacks on Southern injustices, being especially active in investigating and exposing the fraudulent "reasons" given to lynch Black men, which by now had become a common occurrence.     In Chicago, she helped develop numerous African American women and reform organizations, but she remained diligent in her anti-lynching crusade, writing Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases. She also became a tireless worker for women's suffrage, and happened to march in the famous 1913 march for universal suffrage in Washington, D.C. Not able to tolerate injustice of any kind, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, along with Jane Addams, successfully blocked the establishment of segregated schools in Chicago.     In 1895 Wells married the editor of one of Chicag
cb6ee098076c0e8bc3386f709a8bd4bcaa	Polarity of radio signals is determined by the electric field.  Most television stations use horizontal polarized antennas, FM is mostly a mix of horizontal and circular.  Some very low power FM use vertically polarized antennas due to simplicity in installation.  DBS satellite uses a circular polarization rather than linear polarization.  A yagi antenna is usually either horizontally or vertically polarized.  If you place two on a common boom, or separated by the correct distance, you can create a circular polarized signal.  In this case the electrical field rotates, sort of like a cork screw.  Look for an FM broadcast tower with multiple antennas on the side.  There are often 10 or 12 pods off to the side.  These are commonly circularly polarized.  Check this web site.

Used to form adjectives or adverbs meaning or "before (in time)".     Usage notes  This prefix is usually prefixed to words without using a hyphen (for example, prefix, predate). A hyphen is used in the following cases:   Where excluding a hyphen would be likely to lead to a mispronunciation of the word because "pre" appears not to be a complete syllable (for example, "pre-yaw course", which could be read as "prey aw course" if unhyphenated).   Always in British English before the letter e (for example, pre-existing)   Often in British English before other vowels (for example, pre-operative);   In some other words in British English (for example, pre-war);   Always in all varieties of English before a character other than a letter (for example, pre-1960).|`|AA11196187	keep using it. as long as you think it fits itsfine

Pensa che l'anno prox le classi dello scientifico(non so le altre) saranno formate da 34 studenti!|`|wK3GHkbjaa	Non so come funzioni in queste situazioni ma se l'atteggiamento della tua scuola  appoggiato dalla legge, secondo me,  tutto ridicolo.  Ma anche quando il tuo liceo, vista questa abbondanza di iscritti (che dovrebbe far piacere alla scuola), non potrebbe creare una sezione, un corso in pi? Che senso ha cacciare i ragazzi!  Nel mio liceo, invece, bisogna cambiare scuola dopo la seconda bocciatura.|`|7a0d1d54ce6a1b1f9c08bdf0179a10b8aa	Mi sembra abbastanza assurdo! Ma che modi sono? Cacciano voi per fare spazio ai nuovi? Al massimo ti possono cacciare se sei stata bocciata 2 volte di seguito...ma altrimenti,non credo proprio! Non so proprio che dirti|`|91b586f4291e354c5e226829a000c0edaa	Io invece sono contento di questo provvedimento: se una persona sta per tre anni in terza vuol dire che sta l solo per scaldare la sedia e non andare a cercarsi un lavoro, danneggiando quelli che escono dalle medie, i quali trovano il loro posto occupato da chi non se lo merita.  Applaudo, dunque, la scelta del preside, che ha usato la sua autorit scolastica come se fosse il capo del personale un'azienda: fuori gli improduttivi, largo alle nuove leve.    Dovrebbero farlo anche nella mia scuola.|`|hChKctAmaa	dai ma non  possibile... una storia del genere non l'ho mai sentita.

Credo che tu   non possa  frequentare in eterno  il liceo,  togliendo il posto  a chi vuole  frequentarlo regolarmente.  Avresti dovuto   pensarci prima  di farti bocciare  tre volte.  Per la scuola   non c' pi  nessun obbligo  di accettare  la tua iscrizione.|`|VKBQyYM5aa	Non voglio minimamente credere al tuo scritto!!!|`|1927964967626a5e16c6a05529fdb2deaa	potreste fare un esposto con tanto di firme al provveditorato degli studi...la tua scuola  statale o privata?? perch se  statale c' una bella denuncia al tar che si pu fare, se  privata invece d a pap di chiamare l'avvocato che le cose diventano + difficili
