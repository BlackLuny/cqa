Of course you are just a troll here and not seeking real learning. But I will show you anyways. Being a minister of God, since I speak this unto you, you are now held responsible since truth was shown to you.    "You believe that 8 people cared for thousands of animals for a hundred days"  They do believe that.    If thousands of animals are being transported, what would the most logical way to do this be? Babies? Eggs? And is not man smart enough to angle boards and such to allow for drainage of waste products? Is not man smart enough to build a trough system for water and feed? So how hard is it to do this job then? Pretty easy. And since you claim only 8 people made it. Shows you have never read scripture, for it clearly states more than 8 made it. But you are going on only what you have heard as hear say. No real research.    "You believe an all-powerful God had take 6 days to create the universe, then ahd to take a rest"  They do believe that.    Sorry, but you have never read the book. For it never stated He had to rest, but choose to rest. Why? Cause He knew man could not go on working 7 days a week non stop for life. In turn He took a break, so we could take a break. For we are told to follow the same work pattern.    Sorry, but you are mistaken for one can easily read. A day unto God is like... it doesn't say it is, but like, a 1000 yrs to man. Meaning this could be 900, 1000, 1400, or anything related. To claim 6 days shows you are just a troll.    "You believe that dinosaurs and humasn co-existed"  But they DO believe that!    Guess you have never been in the main museum in Washington DC nor in NYC huh. Cause both hold fossils showing mans markings of foot or hand prints right beside those of dinosaurs. If you grasp how fossils are made, it means both prints had to be made within days of each other. In turn proving dino's and man have lived together. Rocks cannot lie, if they do lie, then all rock evidence needs tossed out. Please visit some museums instead of Yahoo for truth, you might surprised at what you find.    So, who is the fool here? The one that claims others are the fool, you.    Ecclesiastes 10:3   Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way,   his wisdom faileth him,   and he saith to every one that he is a fool.

Ask them how many people it takes to feed all those animals. Then imagine all the animals were tame and in one small area.     Why do you assume God needed to use 6 days and rest on the 7th. He could have done everything in an instant. Maybe there is a reason why He did it this way. Just because you don't understand something, doesn't mean that it makes no sense.    Evolutionists make logical errors all the time. Here are a few:    "Suppressed Correlative"  A correlative is redefined so that one alternative is made impossible.    Example:  Creationist: The honeybee's brain is more efficient and powerful than a supercomputer. Only God can make something like that.    Evolutionist: No! You must not invoke the supernatural! You must find a natural explanation for the honeybee's brain.    "Denying the Correlative"  An attempt to introduce alternatives where there are none.    Example:  Creationist: This complex world was obviously designed.    Evolutionist: Maybe it was the Flying Spaghetti Monster! How about invisible pink unicorns? Maybe leprechauns made everything!      Do you want to read more? I am working on the many fallacies that evolutionists and atheists commit.

On this first day the earth was a void in space staring at the sun.  This was not the earth we know today.  No plants and animals, a complete barren ball of water as land had not yet been introduced.    (Literal) Day 2 Genesis 1:6-8 states that God separated the waters above and below.  A shield of ice or mist was introduced into the atmosphere.  The expanse between the waters was called sky and this was the second day.  Basically, this is when He made our atmosphere.    (Literal) Day 3 Genesis 1:9-13 states that God created land and divided it from the water.  The world looked somewhat Pangea like in form, as the continents were all together.  God than created all the plant life we see today.    (Literal) Day 4 Genesis 1:14-19 states that God created the stars in the sky and the moon and set the revolution of the earth in motion around the sun.  The Earth was not capable of sustaining life before this step.    (Literal) Day 5 Genesis 1:20-23 states that God created the creatures of the sea and the air and he blessed them.  Incidentally, this is the first blessing in the Bible.      (Literal) Day 6 Genesis 1:24-31 states that God created all the land animals and than humans and gave us humans dominion over the Earth and told us to take care of it.    (Literal) Day 7 Genesis 2:1-3 states that God rested on the seventh day and made it holy as an example for us to use one day a week as a day of rest.    There was about 2000 years between the great flood when the waters above came and flooded the land and creation.  Before the flood, people lived to be several hundred years old and the differing atmospheric conditions allowed for constant growth.  As for dinosaurs, there were never any different species than what we see today.  For example, if my dog never stopped growing over his 600-year life Im sure hed be as big as a house!  These truths have often been cast aside but never disproven.    During the flood the earth below the waters broke apart creating the continents we have today.  The flood also dramatically changed the atmosphere, as there is no longer water above the earth.  The new atmosphere accounts for the differing atmospheric changes and climate we see today as before the flood the earth would have been fairly temperate.    After the flood there was 2000 years before God came to Earth in the form of Jesus.  It has almost been 2000 years since Jesus came.  His return is foretold in Revelation and many prophesies about that return are being fulfilled now.

But I'm here to tell you that I know Plant Biology very well and know that Evolution is a pure crock of stupidity but I am not a Creationist.    In science as in the normal workings of the human mind, the insight that something is wrong or untrue or foolish is SEPARATE from the discovery of what is true or right.      Make the effort.

That's not quite accurate.    It was not just a hundred days.  It was 370 days ... from the time they closed the doors when the rains started, until they opened after the waters subsided.    And it was not just "thousands" of animals.    There are 5,400 species of mammals, 8,200 species of reptiles and 10,000 species of birds for a total of about 23,600 species of land vertebrates alone (excluding amphibians ... we'll allow the biologically unrealistic claim that their aquatic eggs could survive the flood ... and the dinosaurs, alas, literally 'missed the boat').   So with a breeding pair from each, that's a cargo of over 47,000 land vertebrates alone.       If you start adding in the land *invertebrates* the number of species goes into the millions ... there are over a million known species, and an estimated 10 million total species of insects alone!  The Bible is quite clear that Noah was carrying "the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground" ... so what were these "creatures" if not things like earthworms, tarantulas, fire ants, and dung beetles ... but maybe this was a reference to the reptiles, which God did not consider "animals."    Now the Creationist might argue that individual *species* were not on board, but representative "kinds" (without defining what a "kind" is) ... but then this would admit that *speciation* is not only *possible* (which wipes out the 'macroevolution is impossible' argument) but *necessary* to complete the Biblical account.    (Oh, and you left out that the construction of this massive boat was accomplished by a 600 year-old-man.)    So I think you have made the *opposite* of a straw man argument!  You have characterized the literalist account of Genesis in a way that makes it *more* plausible than the actual story.    ----    P.S. It is important to note that I am not ridiculing the story of Genesis itself.   I believe the Bible is a source of *profound* Truth (capital 'T') if read as allegorical truth.   My target is not the Bible, but *LITERALISM* ... the absolute, rigid belief that Genesis is to be read as a chronicle of *actual* events ... right down from the exact words spoken by the snake, to the number of 'begats' from Adam to Noah to Abraham, to the number of cubits of gopherwood in the Ark.   This loses track of the real essence of what the Bible is about, and they turn the Bible into a joke ... the exact *opposite* of what true believers should be doing to honor the Bible, and represent it to non-believers in a persuasive way.   It is focusing so much on the *letter* of the Bible, that you lose sight of *God*.   THAT is why literalism (and its spawn, Creationism) leads not only to BAD science, but to BAD religion as well.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Yes, it is so hard to use logic when talking with creationists, mostly because they _don't_ use logic to start with.    If a straw man argument is going to work, there has to be a credible foundation.    Edit: In looking through some of your comments, a strawman diverts attention by obfuscating the facts.

AA11188574	The Kingdom is an actual government that will soon be ruling over the entire earth, replacing ALL man's governments. To put that kingdom first is a way of life not just a feeling.

I live in the USA and just like a good American would get up in the AM and be on the alert not to break any laws such as driving, etc so too the one who puts the Kingdom first would not want to break any laws that it stands for. Just as a judge in a court would tell us it is our obligation to know what the law is it is also our obligation to find out what the law is for the Kingdom.

Few can do it but those that do develop an trust and and intimcy with God that is fulfilling, uplifting and strengthening - wonderful.    How is it done . . . exactly as JESUS, our exemplar, did it. He preached from city-to-city, from door-to-door about God's Kingdom and shared the happiness and joy it brings the mankind as well was the hope it offers for and everlasting perfect life. He had complete trust in God that there was to be a resurrection of the righteous and the unrighteous. He did not worry about food, politics, clothing, shelter - God provided!    This putting the Kingdom first related to the Kingdom that Jesus taught us to pray for in the Lord's Prayer . . . "Let your Kingdom come & let your will be done on earth" .    You must not rely on man's government or politics, you must not be involved in man's wars, you must consider God's will in all that you do = putting the Kingdom Of God before all else with complete reliance on God to provide for your needs.

You can't weasel and say it was someone else's fault when you're telling a priest.  I mean, God knows the difference, but you can convince yourself when you're not talking to someone who will call BS.    (2) a priest will offer penance for your sin.  For example, if you took something from your parent, you have broken two commandments, honour thy father and mother, and thou shalt not steal.  So as penance, you would have to replace what you took, apologize (perhaps), you would most likely have to do something extra for that parent, and say more prayers than usual for a time (once or a week/month, etc.)    This practise of penance reinforces the lesson that you should not do wrong, and benefits the wronged party, which can help save them from sin, since they may seek retribution.  It teaches responsibility for actions.  And it helps remove feelings of guilt, since you've "paid" for your sins.    A common misconception is that the priest forgives the sin.  He does not.  He acts as proxy for God, basically saying out loud what God has already said, that if you repent, He will forgive.  Hearing it out loud though is a comfort :)    EDIT:  um, did you read my post about why?  Christians don't *have* to confess to the priest, you can simply confess to God if you want, but the above is why we do it.  (I haven't in ages, but I've nothing against the concept.)|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Because Jesus gave that power to the priests of the Church via St. Peter.

A couple of centuries later, modern psychology would catch up with with Jesus knew:  when a person does wrong, he can sit in his room alone and think about how repentent he is, but true healing only comes when he admits his mistakes to another, living breathing person.

cd2etz5Raa	Because Christ (as a man) probably had thick, un managed hair, an unruly beard, He probably was not all too clean considering they did not have plumbing back then. I'm sure His feet were filthy and cut up, having only sandals to wear, He sweat a lot and His clothes were raggedy ...    Which in this day and age is considered hideous. I doubt Christ would be able to set one foot inside of most churches today.     He was not the crisp, clean white man we see in pictures.    Isaiah 53:2-3 (NIV) (Also for Katrina P)    "He grew up before him like a tender shoot,   and like a root out of dry ground.   He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,   nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.     He was despised and rejected by men,   a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.   Like one from whom men hide their faces   he was despised, and we esteemed him not."|`|JRlMmO4Qaa	The Bible doesn't portray Jesus as you suggest, however, to the non-believer who lives in rebellion to God, Christ is the enemy.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Gotcha...you have never read the Bible...Gotcha    Mar 10: 13 And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. 14 But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, "Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. 15 Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it." 16 And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.

It's a whole lot nicer praying to an attractive god.|`|81FuUf9Saa	Presumably the following prophetic verses from Isaiah chapter 52, is the basis for your description of Him as 'hideous:    13 "Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.  14  As many were astoni[sh]ed at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: ..." (see also Is. 53:2); however, there is another prophetic verse, that comes closest to describing His physical appearance:  Gen. 49:12 "His [i.e.the Person "Shiloh": or "He to Whom it [the sceptre of power] belongs"] eyes shall be darker than wine, His teeth shall be whiter than milk."    The above verse from Genesis is so translated in many modern versions. It shows the Israelites were to expect a physically attractive man as Messiah.  However -- and while I don't disagree Jesus would indeed have been the epitome of manhood, both spiritually and physically -- I believe the translation is best as "eyes ... RED WITH wine. Some modern translations, notably the Good News Bible & New American Standard Version, render it "Blood-shot through drinking too much wine"  & "red through too much wine (NB: not necessarily word-for-word, but close enough for the purpose of this reply)" respectively.  That Jesus could be a drunkard is palpably false; yet the NASB, regarded by most Bible scholars as the best modern translation, has failed to correct this impression; that is one reason I refuse to use it.  The better translation is the KJV: "His eyes shall be red WITH wine", not BECAUSE of wine (the Jewish Publications version is the same as the KJV).  So, which is the correct view of 'Shiloh/He to whom it belongs/Messiah/Christ': drunkard, or red with the wine of God's vengeance?    Judging by John's description of eyes "as of a flame of fire" (Rev. 19:12, KJV), it would seem that "His eyes will be red with the wine of vengeance" (as one commentary put it) is the answer to that; and also in Christ's first Incarnation, possibly through the fact that He took the wrath WE deserve (see Isaiah 52:13 - 53:12 for the prophetic description of what Jesus would suffer. 53:5 being the verse I believe may refer to the eyes red with suffering from the effect of His Father's wrath).  The Isaiah passage referenced above is also the one that calls Him stricken: but that 'marred visage and form' of Christ is from the beatings and the scourging of 39 lashes He suffered prior to His crucifixion (see also Psalm 22 for a prophecy regarding the crucifixion agonies Christ would suffer, and Daniel 9 for the fact that Messiah would be cut off -- i.e. die -- when He first came).    A pity, though, you should so disrespect the God who died for you, should accept His offer of forgiveness, by describing Him as a 'pimp-master funk.    May God bless all who sincerely seek the truth about Him.
mfSp38yzaa	Yes. The Catholic Church recognizes (almost) any Baptism that is in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. If he marries a Catholic, they will consider him a Christian. But, just so you know, a Catholic can even marry an atheist, so Baptism isn't necessarily a factor.    If your son was marrying a Catholic and decided to convert, he would not be re-Baptized. We recognize only ONE Baptism for the forgiveness of sins. He would only go through a Confirmation.|`|6TuyXuJRaa	Should be but no it isn't. He will have to convert or better don't.

The Nicene Creed states, "We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins."    The Catholic Church recognizes the baptism of anyone who was baptized with water and the words, "[Name], I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."

UwzsgxU6aa	I think that Christianity has gotten off the rails a long, long, time ago ... let's say as far back when it became the established religion of the Emperor Constantine in the 300s - 400s. It began as a movement that turned the world upside down and then became a religion that has gotten immersed in the same rule based gatekeeping that often happens when God's intent is ignored. God's intent was that all humanity be involved in doing peace and justice. God's intent was that all be included with no outsiders. The Book of Acts says that the beginning Christian community lived together and shared everything in common.|`|AaKZekyRaa	I think the clinging to irrational dogma and the hatred of all who are different (under the guise of "love the sinner, hate the sin") is destroying Christianity.

Really, I do think that the term "Christian" is somewhat generally used in these polls.  "Christian" is non-Jewish, non-atheist, and non-eastern religion.  A person is just as likely to claim he's a Christian because he's not an atheist, and yet has had no personal relationship with Christ and doesn't agree that there is no other way to spend eternity with God than through the blood of Jesus Christ. Many of them warm the pews on Sunday, but can't find their way around and through a Bible even after twenty years.

AA11297267	No, catholics accepting evolution doesn't mean that the genesis accounts are not literally true.  Truth isn't a popularity contest.    We must accept that the genesis accounts are not literally true because there is no evidence of any kind that shows they are, and a huge mountain of evidence that shows they are not.  How many people believe or don't believe they're literally true is irrelevant.    It's good that the catholic church has (finally) decided to accept fact over myth.  But it's not their denial of the myth that makes the myth false -- it's the evidence.    Peace.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Does it mean that the Genesis accounts are not literally true?    No.  What it means is that the Roman Catholic Church *allows* its members to view the Genesis account as allegorical (and, indeed, that is the position on the creation account most commonly-held by Roman Catholics).      2) Conceding that not everything in scripture is literally true is the first step on a long slope that opens more and more theological and supernatural claims to questioning.    Why?  Don't forget - the bible wasn't around for the first 300 years of Christianity.  The Roman Catholic Church is one of those sects that do not base their doctrines on the idea of the infallibility of the bible.      3) Thats a good thing - but to many believers it may seem  a very disturbing, threatening thing, and so they react defensively and aggressively.

We were taught that while Creationism makes a nice story, it doesn't pass muster scientifically. Of course, not everything in Scripture was meant to be taken literally. The only people I know who actually believe in Biblical literalism tend to be Fundamentalists. They don't seem to comprehend that their literalistic viewpoint is a minority opinion within Christianity. Most mainline churches I've encountered simply don't teach Biblical literalism (or Biblical infallibility).|`|D9lMg7A2aa	'Evolution' is just a slippery word though. A few decades ago it meant 'gradualism', now it means 'punctuated equilibrium'. Talk about slippery.     But Catholic teaching is solid. Yes, insofar as E. is compatible with the Faith it is compatible. But here is my list of caveats on that.         *          God created everything in its whole substance from nothing (ex nihilo) in the beginning.        (Lateran IV; Vatican Council I)      *          Genesis does not contain purified myths. (Pontifical Biblical Commission 1909[1])      *          Genesis contains real historyit gives an account of things that really happened. (Pius XII)      *          Adam and Eve were real human beingsthe first parents of all mankind. (Pius XII)      *          Polygenism (many first parents) contradicts Scripture and Tradition and is condemned. (Pius XII; 1994 Catechism, 360, footnote 226: Tobit 8:6the one ancestor referred to in this Catechism could only be Adam.)      *          The beginning of the world included the creation of all things, the creation of Adam and Eve and the Fall (Jesus Christ [Mark 10:6]; Pope Innocent III; Blessed Pope Pius IX, Ineffabilis Deus).      *          The body of Eve was specially created from a portion of Adams body (Leo XIII). She could not have originated via evolution.      *          Various senses are employed in the Bible, but the literal obvious sense must be believed unless reason dictates or necessity requires (Leo XIII, Providentissimus Deus).      *          Adam and Eve were created upon an earthly paradise and would not have known death if they had remained obedient (Pius XII).      *          After their disobedience of God, Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden. But the Second Person of the Trinity would subsequently pay the ransom for fallen man (Nicene Creed).      *          Original Sin is a flawed condition inherited from Adam and Eve (Council of Trent).      *          The Universe suffers in travail ever since the sin of disobedience by Adam and Eve. (Romans 8, Vatican Council I).      *          We must believe any interpretation of Scripture that the Fathers taught unanimously on a matter of faith or morals (Council of Trent and Vatican Council I).      *          All the Fathers who wrote on the subject believed that the Creation days were no longer than 24-hour-days. (Consensus of the Fathers of the Church)      *          The work of Creation was finished by the close of Day Six, and nothing completely new has since been createdexcept for each human rational soul at conception (Vatican Council I)      *          St. Peter and Christ Himself in the New Testament confirmed the global Flood of Noah. It covered all the then high mountains and destroyed all land dwelling creatures except eight human beings and      all kinds of non-human creatures aboard the Ark (Unam Sanctam, 1302)      *          The historical existence of Noahs Ark is regarded as most important in typology, as central to Redemption. (1566 Catechism of the Council of Trent)      *          Evolution must not be taught as fact, but instead the pros and cons of evolution must be taught.        (Pius XII, Humani Generis)      *          Investigation into human evolution was allowed in 1950, but Pope Pius XII feared that an acceptance of evolutionism might adversely affect doctrinal beliefs.|`|mfSp38yzaa	The Catholic Church has always held the position that SOME things and the Bible are allegorical.

It's from the Bible, yes, but it does not mention God, and I think it would be great encouragement for your mother in-law. Death is a scary thing, and inside she could be struggling with that fear. If it were me in that situation, just that one phrase would help me cope, I believe.
vEEeq7kYaa	From what you say about the situation, it appears that at least one of them knew that you were a Wiccan....so, these were people that knew you?    If that is the case, what they said gave the reason why they disrespected what you said.  No matter if you had been the Library administrator, they would not have given you any respect because that comment clearly revealed they held no respect at all for you because of your beliefs and believe you only deserve the torture of hell.  They obviously had no respect for one another or the woman whose "soul" they were arguing over like vultures fighting one another over a carcass.    I am not Wiccan, but Jewish, and I have encountered this type of attitude by fundamentalist of more than one religion, however, it is a common attitude among many Christian evangelicals of several denominations.  A literalist interpretation of several New Testament passages have been used throughout the history of the Christian religion to justify this attitude.   If you are indoctrinated to believe that all outside your sphere of faith are deserving of hell, it isn't a far reach to justify lack of respect for them as deserving the same basic respect all human beings are entitled to give and receive one another.  For the Jewish people, they go a step further and sometimes claim we are not only undeserving of, but incapable of respect.  If you are indoctrinated to believe that Jews are blinded to God, Jews covenant has been superseded by a different covenant and refuse to follow the way of God and deserve punishment because of that, you can  easily justify any behavior done to Jews or to turn your back when others do so.  History has shown this time and again.  Personal encounters with Christians who tell me they love me to try to convince me to abandon my faith for theirs and then turn vicious with insult when I politely decline reveal this, too.  that may sound harsh, but that's the gut reaction and things brought to mind while I was reading that story.    While there is always a distinct possibility it had something also to do with you or your body posture or your manner of approach, that one comment that you said they spoke to you ( and did not argue with one another over it's validity) spoke the loudest to me in why they had no respect for your authority.

My best guess is perhaps there is a difference in age between you and the Librarian, and her age gave or more of an air of authority.    It could also be just the way she carried herself vs the way you do.  There are several ways to use body language to give yourself more of an air of authority and make people listen to you including eye contact, lowering the tone of your voice, making sure your back is straight and your head is up, and keeping your arms at your sides (crossing them gives the impression you are trying to guard or protect yourself)    Remember, show no fear!
l4lGSSG0aa	It says in 2 Timothy ch, 3 1This know also: that in the last days perilous times shall come.           2For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,             3without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, without selfcontrol, fierce, despisers of those who are good,             4traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,             5having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof. From such turn away.             6For of this sort are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,              7ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth    So, we are to expect these things from those who don't know the Lord.  You did not mention if you had a relationship with Christ or not but the only way to endure all of this hatred and people of this world is to have the love of Jesus and the peace that He gives us.  Sometimes it can be hard to be around people that have no regards for anyone but themselves, I go through it everyday and its hard to always be the light in the dark places of this world but when we repent and really mean it and invite the Lord to live in us, He will guide us and help us deal with all of the ugliness in this world but He will not enter us unless we ask Him to with a sincere heart because He is a gentleman and He won't force Himself on us.

Make the best of it and choose your company wisely. But don't keep from others what is rightfully theirs, for then you are no different in the end.   I don't understand why believers do bad things either. Don't they slander the Word by their actions? But if you listen to them, they can do no wrong because they go to church on Sunday.   In one of my opinions, it is these people that need weeded out. It is these examples that turn others away.  Dissension dissension dissension.  I mean one religion means nothing to me. What are we all fighting for if we are all on the same side.   In some instances it's all about one thing and that is image. Show me a believer that is true to their faith and I can show you a hypocrite.

I go to do whatever and deal with each episode at a time. If you try to live outside of the realm that you are in at the moment, it's gonna get you every time.

Most people have a need to stew over what cant be fixed or settled at the moment. Fortunately I'm not like that. I don't like stress, I refuse for stress to rule my day. It's irrates my hubby to death that I let go. If you will put your troubles on the shelf and deal with one at a time, you will be a lot more calmer. God, the bible, is helpful of course, but you need to learn to deal with everyday life. Once you learn how to be calm and not let situations control you, you will be a lot happier.
7XuEyRvNaa	I think you worry a tad too much about what others would think, and what is "socially acceptable".    The only questions you need to ask is, a) whether you like doing it, and b) Is your partner okay with it?     If you are not causing harm to anyone, then it is no one else's business. Period. You seem to be pretty confused/worried about conforming with "Indian culture". what exactly is culture anyways? Take the so-called western culture for example. just 6 centuries back or so, ritual marriage did not even exist there. A man took a woman as a partner, and that was all there was to marriage. It was only later that marriage required priests and registration. And today, they are calling not having a church witnessed-marriage to be a "sin".    In ancient India, we had people doing "Gandharva vivah" which was essentially just a one-night stand. Like the step-mother of Bhishma slept with Parashara Rishi, gave birth to Ved Vyasa and then married a King(Bhishma's father). Going by today's laws and social values, the second marriage was illegal and therefore all the pandavas were basically illegitimate children?     It was in Indian culture to encourage/force the widows to commit suicide. Government made this illegal. I assume that in your zeal to "obey" social boundaries, you will inform your gf that you support the sati-pratha and will expect her to self-immolate in case something happens to you tomorrow?    Our so-called Indian culture always had kings. So democracy itself is against Indian culture, no? what do you plan to do about that? Start a rebellion?    Only thing worse than the uneducated ignorant Idiots trying to tell us what "Indian culture" is, are the educated idiots trying to eagerly obey their dictates.    What exactly is this "pub" culture and why are you so defensive about that? There is nothing wrong with wine in moderation. Nor is there any scientific research that says that wine is harmful only to women but beneficial to men. If these talibanistic eunuchs that feel threatened by female equality, really thought there was something bad about wine, they would simply go and close down the government licensed wine shops, which they do not dare to.    so if our culture has always been dynamic and ever-changing, why are you so guilty about not sticking to what is old-fashioned?    Use your common sense. The reason people do not have sex in public is because they don't want small kids to start copying the same and getting pregnant at age of 14-15. But even small children kiss all the time. I mean these objecting hypocrites are the same ones ones who would go and buy tickets in their teen age, to see others do the same on a theater screen?     What is so bad about a kiss? When the social boundary has changed, how could you be crossing it?  --------------------------------------...  Addition : Turn spike surfer... you have a tendency to hear only what you want. You are pretty selective in listening. You have already made up your mind what others should or should not do, and now seem to be asking questions again and again to convince *others*, not yourself.    I mean any idiots could see that before muslim and british invaders, we had been a tolerant and permissive society. But you have no answer to that arguement. For folks like you s-ex is a SIN. If women start dressing up in ancient Indian tradition, or doing gandharva vivahas, even that would somehow magically lead this country into "destruction"!    Wake up !!! Newsflash! The people who brought all these ooh-la-la taboos to our country are the ones having multiple  wives and thus having daily orgies, and making even the usage of contraception a taboo. India did not have a population problem before these taboos were imported. If you really feel that the country is going to destruction because of some kissing in public or going to pubs or girls showing some skin, do us a favour. Do NOT marry. Do NOT have kids. And please break up with your gf. Affairs and Sex is against your "culture", no? Hypocrite! For one thing, it will help reduce the population, and ensure that gene-pool is at least improved for lack of your contribution.     I mean, intolerant "culture jihadists" idiots such as you shouldn't be procreating.     And read about our ancient history before deciding what our "culture" is or should-be.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	Couples kissing as per indian culture should be in privacy.If it is in car or not is not a question.

People who attack this citing culture do not have any culture for them selves. India is not a sigle country and there is nothing common between a north Indian and South Indian and East Indian to west Indians of India. North Indians make fun of south Indians.

I think the epistemology behind agnosticism is a poor as that behind theism, but the person I accept.     The theist has no evidence, and is thus basing a claim on faith, which leaves room for *any* belief, and leaves us policing atrocities after they occur. Faith is dangerous and must go.    Agnosticism is based on the nonsense idea that we must be 100% sure to say we know something. By that standard, I only know that I exist (to doubt this requires that I exist to have the doubt) and am having some sort of experience. Everything else can be doubted without contradiction. This does not account for what we do seem to know, and thus reduces "knowledge" to the level of meaninglessness. Once we accept reasonable margins of error ('p' values in science), atheism is the only justified position. Nobody says they are agnostic about unicorns or leprechauns. The only difference with deities is that the consequences seem greater, which makes agnosticism about God smack of spinelessness, not legitimate belief.|`|AA10096992	Unless an agnostic has faith in the existence of a god, he's an atheist in my book.

But even the stubborn pharisee's didnt believe Christ even after showing them miracles right to their face. Some people have already decided that they dont want to believe even if they see miracles. So notice how the pharisee's kept asking for signs, but Christ already showed them signs. They couldnt comprehend these signs and only wanted to see the signs they wanted.

I could equally well say that Christians expect others to believe their own assertions without explanation.    We cannot prove there is no god because you cannot prove a negative - that's just elementary logic.    We know he wants us to have faith because the bible says so... why is the bible different from any other book?  Christians say it is the word of god - who told them that?    If evidence is not necessary, then I will tell you that I believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  You tell me you don't because he doesn't exist, and I'll ask you to prove he doesn't exist.  You won't be able to.  Which comes back to the first point - asking atheists to prove the non-existence of a deity will get nowhere.|`|pEELfzkHaa	Yep you are right.

However it makes no difference they refuse to see the truth and their worldly knowledge prevents them from seeing something so simply.  Faith is for the humble, to truly believe without seeing.  In order for one to have faith they must cast aside all they "think" they know and accept the higher power of the Lord.  An atheist's pride and self serving righteous behavior is what prevents them from doing that. Wonderful point about the wife.

LuN1unJ3aa	It helps to read the entire sentence: "I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book." Keep in mind this statement was made on November 28, 1841, almost 160 years ago.    It doesn't take much for a person to realize that although the Bible is considered by the Mormons to be the Word of God, the teachings contained in it are often misinterpreted by man (resulting in the _many_ Christian denominations that disagree on points of doctrine/dogma that existed then and still exist today). It was Joseph Smith's opinion that the Book of Mormon clarified many of the misinterpretations about the teachings of God.    By the way, the Book of Mormon does not replace the Bible in the Mormon church. It is considered "Another Testament of Jesus Christ" and for those who love to quote Revelation (22:18-19) where it says not to add to or take away from the words of this book, read Deuteronomy 4:2-3.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	Why does the Book of Mormon have less chance of being the "correct book" than the Bible, Quran, etc.?|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Well did he write it?

When read in context, the Prophet's statement refers to the correctness of the principles it teaches.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	They say the bible is not enough.

They changed the name from Benjamin to Mosiah in Mosiah 21:28 since Benjamin was already dead and it would be hard to interpret engravings.    How many other errors are there? I can't trust it. Too bad we don't have it in the original language.|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	It seems reasonable to assume that by reading the Book of Mormon you would get a good idea of LDS beliefs. However, despite being the 'keystone' of the Mormon religion, it does not contain any of the unique doctrines that separate Mormonism from traditional Christianity.     The Book of Mormon teaches one God, not plural gods as in Mormonism. It mentions heaven and hell, not three degrees of glory, no temple marriage or secret temple ceremonies (in fact it condems 'secret combinations'. It does not teach baptism for the dead, pre-existence of man, eternal progression or polygamy. One of the most objectionable doctrines in the Book of Mormon is its view of skin color. White skin is seen as desirable, dark skin is seen as a mark of God's displeasure.     Smith wrote the Book of Mormon in the late 1820's. Over the next fifteen years his doctrines underwent radical changes which are seen in his revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price.    "We heard a voice from out of the bright light above us, saying, 'These plates ... have been translated by the power of God. The translation of them which you have seen is correct ..." (History of the Church, vol. 1, pp.54-55).    These claims would lead one to believe that there should never have been a need to make any changes to the most correct of any book.  However, there have been nearly 4000 changes in the text since its original publication.  While most of these changes are corrections to grammar or spelling (guess God wasnt too good at English?), many are significant as they deal with basic theology and the nature of God.  None of the nearly 4000 changes are noted or explained in the text and so a reader today is misled into assuming that the modern edition is the same as the original.    Even changes in spelling and grammar are important when we consider the claims concerning the translation which were made by Joseph Smith and the witnesses to the book. Martin Harris said that the words which appeared on the seer stone would not disappear until they were correctly written. Oliver B. Huntington recorded in his journal that in 1881 Joseph F. Smith, who later became the sixth president of the Mormon church, taught that the Lord gave Joseph Smith the exact English wording and spelling that he should use in the Book of Mormon:    Saturday Feb.25, 1881, I went to Provo to a quarterly Stake Conference. Heard Joseph F. Smith describe the manner of translating the Book of Mormon ... Joseph did not render the writing on the gold plates into the English language in his own style of language as many people believe, but every word and every letter was given to him by the gift and power of God.... The Lord caused each word spelled as it is in the book to appear on the stones in short sentences or words, and when Joseph had uttered the sentence or word before him and the scribe had written it properly, that sentence would disappear and another appear. And if there was a word wrongly written or even a letter incorrect the writing on the stones would remain there.... and when corrected the sentence would disappear as usual ("Journal of Oliver B. Huntington," p.168 of typed copy at Utah State Historical Society).|`|T52vXXBJaa	How else are you going to create a religion that blindly follows its writ so dogmatically?|`|aUVB29lmaa	Because he and his cult is the Antichrist.

The bible is a record of the jews and the destruction as well. but remember in John 10:16 jesus says he will visit sheep that are not of this fold.  The book of Mormon is an account of Jesus and the visions  and prophesies of him.    God choice people to write about the coming of the lord on this side of world and that he would come to them and he did.IT is a record of the gospel so that other may know that Jesus lives and is our savior and that he loves all and that any questions of truth could be found with one another.  Jospeh smith did not write this book. He translated it and Oliver his apostle wrote it down.

Or maybe we sprang from Atum's tears, or were formed from Nuwa's hastily thrown mud. None of those seem any more or less likely than a god who speaks creation in only seven days, and forms woman from man's rib.|`|b1PvVoB0aa	Quit lumping creationists and flat-earthers into the same category.

The vast majority of "all" Christians do not believe in a flat earth and the Bible does not claim that the earth is flat. Due to the very minuscule number of believers in flat earth theory it is not even an issue.    Creationism has never been proven, just as evolution of the species has never been proven, and is just as meritorious as the evolution of the species theory. Micro-evolution is the only form of evolution that has been accepted as proven because it simply embodies basic genetic traits passing on from parent to offspring. There is not and never has been, and never will be a pairing of like kind that gives birth to a different "kind" of being, which is exactly what evolution of the species claims.    The "overwhelming" empirical proof that we continue to document "every single day in life" is that pairs of like kind give birth to like kind offspring.    Creation claims that God is the source, evolution claims that pure chance is the only cause. Neither can be empirically, absolutely proven by scientific standards as they are both ideological. Trying to  claim that evolution of the species is a fact is nothing more than a blatant lie.    As I said, "all" empirical evidence of live birth, on a daily basis, points away from evolution and towards creation as testified to in Genesis. Like kind pairs give birth to like kind offspring, and despite this overwhelming evidence in contradiction to evolution that is far more abundant in every instance than the few contrived cases of wishful thinking and creative perception used to "support" evolution of the species, the daily empirical data cannot be denied and is fully proven and supported 100% by the scientific method.

HOQp0gA7aa	If it is not against the law for her to marry without her parent's permission where you both live, then I would say that if you are both adults what they desire is less relevant than whether you both truly love each other.  However, you must understand that coming from two different faith traditions will put a continual strain on your relationship.      Questions to be answered include:  How will both faiths be practiced/observed in your household?  Which faith will you be married under?  Which faith will your children be raised to believe?  How will you deal with family members who object to your marriage?    If you are both able to reach a compromise agreement on these kinds of faith related issues, then there is no reason you shouldn't be able to continue dating the woman you love.  However, if you both can not compromise to reach a common understanding, then it is probably best for both of you if you move on from this relationship soon.    I hope this helps.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	End it and vow friendship if that is possible but, I do not see where you can continue without eventually arguing to the point where you become enemies---that is not worth it.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	I'm not a person who would advise you go against Parental advise but it might be best if you two stop dating and remain close friends as at some point in your lives your Religious differences will become important.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	If you are not getting married, why would you keep dating?

A muslim being one that 'submits to the will of God'. So, when a child is born, we believe that their inner self is pure, as opposed to one being in Sin, taught by some christian doctrines. Ones society, culture, family often determine/influence which direction ones goes.     So, looking at some of the readers comments, yes, my belief is that he was born a Muslim as was Michael Jackson.     You may notice that when many people convert to Islam they like to be referred to as reverts to Islam. I.e they have reverted to the orginal nature of human beings which is Islam.

The peace comes from knowing that the things that you think you need are simply illusions.

Metta Bhavana  (Loving Kindness) Meditation, and   Mindfulness of Breathing Meditation.    If you do these 2 meditations for 15 minutes each day then you will start to become peaceful and happy.   They balance the intellect and the emotions.    You could also read up on Buddhist philosophy of non-attachment, and cravings and desires.    But I have found that if you do the 2 meditations regularly then everything else just follows naturally without you having to try too hard.    Here are sites that have the 2 meditations you need.    loving kindness meditation    http://www.buddhanet.net/metta_in.htm    mindfulness of breathing    http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/meditati...    Don't throw anything away or try to change too radically.   By doing the meditations you will begin to change gradually without too much effort.    You could also try to become a vegetarian if that seemed right to you.    Try to do everything with "Mindfulness".      Be aware at all times of exactly what you are doing.  Live in the Now, in the present moment, this is a very important Buddhist concept as it helps to still the mind.    I wish you well and hope you find the peace and happiness you are looking for.|`|AA10096992	The main thing is to get rid of all pretensions.

I also suggest getting a small cushion for meditation, one that allows your bottom to be level with or higher than your knees when sitting on the floor, it helps prevent exhaustion when you are not used to this posture.|`|baW9sSsLaa	The key is determining what is actually necessary to you--and then removing everything else.    For instance--I no longer watch TV.  I occasionally play video games, and I watch movies, but I do not watch broadcast TV.  It is a mind-dulling activity that makes you a slave to its schedule.  I would rather use the time to read a book or paint or draw.    Examine your friends.  How may of them do you actually enjoy being around?  You may find that a lot of your social activities are merely a way to fill time.    Stop paying attention to trends in clothing, electronics, etc.  Resist the urge to pick up every new toy that is produced.  Keep what you actually wear, and what is truly useful to you, and get rid of the rest.    Learn to pay attention to whatever you are doing at the moment.  When you and your family sit down for a meal, really pay attention to what you are eating.  Think of the flavor and texture, and take time to appreciate it.  When your family talks to you, pay attention to what they are saying.  Don't just nod your head while you think of something else.  (You will find this mindfulness pays off in more than one way.)  When you do your homework, don't just rush through it.  Absorb it, pay attention to it.  As a side benefit, you may find more difficult lessons are more easily retained.    Meditation will help, just a few minutes a day is all it requires.  There are countless resources to help you learn how to do this.    Diet...eh, really a matter of personal preference.  It's not as important what you eat (as long as you're getting the nutrients your body needs) as how you eat it.  Mindfully, as I said before.    It will take time to figure out what you can do without.  At first, it may be painful, but after a while, you discover you really don't miss much.     Oh, and pick up a copy of "The Tao of Pooh."  It explains concepts you're reaching for very simply.  Look in the philosophy section of virtually any bookstore.|`|AA11259815	Thats a very good question and you revealed an inner question of mine also. Thats something Ive wanted to do but you have to keep up with society you know. How can you support yourself without a job? What about having a family? You have to spend time with them too. So what I personally do is devote 1 day of the week to myself. What you eat, Ive tried to do and its not easy my friend. You'll find yourself at a restaurant with friends or family and feel pressured into eating something not on YOUR menu know what I mean?     And so what I believe the best way to accomplish this goal of yours is you have to free yourself from the chains of society (gosh Im sounding like a hippie). What I mean by this is accumulate some wealth, buy land, build a home, have money in the bank to retire on and you will have your piece of heaven. We all must work therefore we are slaves. Until you reach a specified amount of money you are FREE to do what you truly desire.     If you are unable to accomplish this, then do what I do ... devote one day of the week to it. Its as simple as staying home on a sunday and doing something different. Go for a walk and observe nature, read a book, sit outside and use your imagination, draw a painting, write a story.    How young are you by the way? You said you go to school so if you're in high school or not even that, then you have more life to live before making such a decision. Do you support yourself yet? If not, that should be more of a priority. And what about continuing your education? Your career? You cant just turn into a monk otherwise you'll find yourself homeless which will be as close to monkhood you will get.    But yeah thats my advice ===|`|LOYeeweAaa	U don't have 2 be a monk or dispose off your stuff or change what u eat. All u have 2 do is start being obedient and kind 2 your parents.

However, that doesn't necessarily mean no alcohol. Wine is a drink that monks have, because wine actually has healthful benefits once and a while. But look out especially for "high fructose corn syrup." That's a major ingredient that makes everyone fat and unhealthy these days.    Don't blast music in your ears that much.

Also it is very easy to misunderstand the lives of Buddhist monks and to idealize what they do and how they live. I think you need to learn about Buddhism and what it means in YOUR life before you can worry about trying to live like a monk.    Take your time, study, meditate, and you will find your way.

Bq0gqw7qaa	Will you add one day to your life by worrying? Anxiety is useless and is a direct result of failure to trust the Lord. You've already admitted this. For the next few days when you look in the mirror in the morning try saying outloud "I am a masterpiece". Don't believe that right now... too bad  It's true. You have been created in the image and likeness of God and are fundamentally good get used to it. It is in your nature to be good, don't supress it, take some time to do something nice for someone else, a friend, a relative, or even better an enemy. Seek out the one who has done the most to lower your self esteem, and consiously do something to build up theirs, seeking no reward or acknowledgement and you will be closer to God than you will ever have imagined possible.<br>                                              Peace; D.D.|`|cdFqekzZaa	You can try,but my agoraphobia hasn't gone away after almost 20 years of leaving it to god. I did have it controlled for several years with meditation,and immersion. I did that alone and got better. I had a normal life for years. I became a believer in christ. A few years later my agoraphobia came back stronger than ever.I prayed and prayed and was as holy as possible. I struggle through with drugs barely covering the panic attacks......so no.|`|kulDK5jsaa	yes|`|a2fgPVEyaa	Since you are already seeing a doctor, I say yes that you should leave the rest up to God.  The Bible says in Matthew 6:31...<br>  <br>  Do not worry then saying, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear for clothing."<br>  <br>  This verse is saying not to worry about things because God has a plan for you life and no matter how much you worry you can't change that plan.<br>  <br>  Shortly after that in Matthew 6:34 it says...<br>  <br>  So do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will take care of itself.  Each day has enough trouble of its own.<br>  <br>  Again, sort of the same thing going on here.  It is saying don't worry about tomorrow because it can worry about itself.  Don't spend life worrying, or it will completely pass you by. <br>  <br>  Then again in Luke 12:22 it says this...<br>  <br>  And He said to His disciples, "For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, as to what you will eat; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. <br>  <br>  And again...Luke 12:25<br>  <br>  "And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life's span? <br>  <br>  And again...Luke 12:29<br>  <br>  "And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So the Bible has a lot to say about worrying.  Try leaving things up to God and he will heal you of your anxiety.  I was in a point in my life once where I constantly worryed about what was going to happen next and it also caused me to loose faith.  I have learned from that time in my life and it has caused me to become a better person.  I hope that what I have told you will help and I will pray for you. <br>  <br>  God bless...|`|nHizaTiDaa	We can and WILL be helped by God- your mind can be healed.<br>  <br>  BUT God also said he gave us every herb and plant for food and healing!<br>  <br>  If we need medicine to help us get our bodies back on track, yes, go get help.<br>  <br>  Our emotions can cause chemical imbalances. So meds can jump start the healing!!<br>  <br>  Do not be afraid to try some meds if that is what helps.<br>  <br>  And find someone to talk to!  Life CAN be very depressing|`|5nfqY9T7aa	You may need medication.  Though it's good to have faith in god, it's up to you to take care of yourself and make sure you get the proper medical attention.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	I recommend that you see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Depression and anxiety are common disorders that are treatable with medicine and therapy.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	Stay with your current medical plan.

nMzzwrtUaa	Yes i do think people are being less involved and knowledgeable of nature. If you see the world now money is the controlling factor, power and rank work as well. Technology is taking over nature even plants are starting to not need the soil or the sun being mess and tampered with to make them completely different then what they where to Begin with. If things where back to the way of the sword meaning we had sturdy buildings built by the people usually living in them, we had strong loyal family ties, every one knows there neighbor and are willing to help them out, people taking care of nature and animals and not wasting any thing of the animal, guns no longer being able to be used to end an others life, by mistake or just because its easy. Back then you thought about what you had to do you killed only when you needed to, Also we can have technology medicine is great, heating and cooling, refrigerators, transportation to be able to see the world around us, there is several advantages to technology but we are letting people get ahead of nature clearing land to build homes when we can keep nature around and build around it. Sooner or later i feel people will be souly dependent on technology to preform just the easiest tasks. In the end we can not fight it it progress or so its said we will keep riding along till we found out the end result.|`|rBCQBHSHaa	Very much so.. There are children who don't realize that milk comes from cows.. They think it comes from the store.. There are people who can't survive a few hours if their electricity goes out.. There are people who literally fall apart when they think about the mall closing up.. If we had to go back to surviving and hunting to feed ourselves.. Probably 90% of the people in North America would have died off in the first week.|`|KT7cllsLaa	I love nature equally as modern technology   I am a happy in a hut near the beach with no one in 50 miles radius, as in downtown of Chicago, using a laptops|`|1MGXHYq9aa	With the way of the world.

They seem to forget humans are part of nature...that we're mammals, a type of animal, too.  But, I can also see that many of the people I know are always putting on that 'holier than thou' attitude of 'I don't watch a lot of TV' and I don't know that they spend much time on the computer. Although, she probably watches TV and spends more time on the computer than she thinks...That, and I know not a single person who could go w/o their car (I'm in TX where it takes a 1/2 hr in a car to get anywhere). And, we'd all be in serious trouble if the heating/ac went out.  I absolutely hate admitting it but we definitely are addicted to unnatural things we've made.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	I think in a lot of ways people have lost there oneness with nature but is that all bad? We also who have those who are the extremists in there earth first views but i personally believe that GOD created us to improve our lives and those who destroy his natural gifts out of greed will suffer for it in the here after.It's one place to cut down a forrest and leave it to erosion and other natural forces and another to be the care takers we were placed here as, and that is if we cut down the forrest we replace it with new seedlings for the future.Unfortunately we have become to dependent on others supplying our needs and have lost the respect of the time it took mother nature to supply what we end up using.You asked about using technology to clean up our messes well that is exactly what we've been doing it is places like the Communist countries and former communist countries that have done the worst ecological damage and have yet learned to clean up there ecological destruction they made.Just check into Russia's legacy on the environment which is far worse than any Capitalist countries have done but the Earth first people ignore them because they are communist.

lSGUBmY7aa	Oh, I definitely think this is very possible.  What better way to touch Divinity?  I like 'yoga trance dance', it meditative movement that also just allows free flow of the body.  Just allowing yourself to move and breathe.  I also enjoy jazz and modern because it requires discipline but also has a fluidity to it.  I appreciate ballet but was never good at it.  I love to do hip hop.  For whatever reason, I've always been really good at it and I just get great joy from it.  It's great fun to just let go, lose yourself and touch the Divine.

4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	It's called networking and, yes, you should contact him, ask him what he's been up to, catch up on things.  Keep it from getting too personal (if asked, you can tell him you are still with the same guy which will put an end to anything further but you can ask if he's seeing anyone in turn).  You can then tel him you are ready to move on and if he knows of anyone looking for [whatever your job is].  He'll know he's being used but may come and ask you for the same favor at some future date (or if you hear of anything he might be interested in, you can call him and give him the referral).  And you should stay in touch with him a little more frequently then every year-and-a-half just on a business level--as a friend and as a contact in the same area of business you are.  It's done all the time and often this is the only way to get the jump on job openings before the rest of the world finds out.  This is what golfing is all about and how guys make deals and get new jobs--by keeping in contact with those who may be able to help them.|`|jz9CnL2Eaa	I would find someone as a reference who never asked you out.  Since he took your relationship from a professional level to someone he wanted to date, I wouldn't ask him to return there (to a professional level).    I don't think it's rude to ask him to be a business contact, but at the same time, I just don't think it's your best choice.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	He would be a good contact for finding a new job as long as it stays between you two. You didn't work very close so I wouldn't use him as a reference when applying to a new job.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	For all you know, he's dating someone now, too.  As long as he took the rebuff well and you continue to be friendly on a professional level, I don't see any reason to give up what could be an important link in your business network.      A little awkwardness never hurt anyone who could handle it deftly and with diplomacy.  What's the worst he could say?  Just send him a note or give him a call and say you're sorry you let so much time pass without any contact, but you still value his assistance with your job, you learned a lot, and you were wondering if he might have any leads for you to move on to something else.      Of course he could be a clod and say something like, "maybe... if you go have drinks with me," in which case you can disconnect that link.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	That may be rather awkward. I'd don't think I would do that but would do my own 'leg-work'.

86PUxs1jaa	I agree that Creationism seriously undermines America, for exactly the reasons you state.  I have a problem with the word "scandal" which implies that the consequences of such nonsense are trivial.  I think Creationism and Intelligent Design are a total disaster -- both for Christianity and for the human race.  Unless brainwashed Christian youth reject the willful ignorance of their superstitious parents, they will have no real economic future.  Without embracing a scientific education, the next generation has absolutely no chance of ever matching the prosperity of their parents.  Superstitious Christianity is in the process of destroying the American economy and will not be satisfied until we're all so damned ignorant we are unable to feed ourselves.  A "scandal"?   ...hardly.  More like a total disaster for human civilization.|`|VSwko9p7aa	I ask myself this question everyday, still confused.|`|Z049kuHfaa	Creationism  taught  purely  in  the  light  of  the  BIBLE  isn't.Its  becomes  scandal  men  men  teach  doctrines  and  commandments  of  men  instead  of  the  Biblical  truths.Evolution  is  taught  in  the  BIBLE.The  fable  of  the  talking  snake  have  separated  men  from  the  truth  of  the  WORD  OF  GOD.GOD  did  create  everything  supernaturally.Yet  he  choose  evolution  in  part  to  accomplish  his  creation.The  serpent/cave man  is  the  product  of  evolution.Adam  wasn't.The  truths  of  there  stories  hides  the  truth  of  creation.We  haven't  much  time  left.Therefore  we  must  all  work  together  with  an  open  heart  in  order  to  understand  our  creation  story  perfectly.

Every biological and physical system, once understood, shows incredible complexity.JOHN K. G. KRAMER, BIOCHEMIST, CANADA    The order of the living world is plainly evident. It was set up by a superior Power that I personally call God. It is here that faith agrees with scientific truth. Far from contradicting it, it completes it, providing a simpler understanding of our universe.JEAN DORST, BIOLOGIST, FRANCE    "The scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation...His religious feeling takes the form of rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals the intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection. - Albert Einstein (theoretical physicist)|`|YYsldZcYaa	Yes- absolute fraud.    EDIT:  You can post all the arguments from authority that you want (iRev)- creationism is still a scam.|`|8gveZWbHaa	I'm genuinely shocked that there are people who actually take it seriously.    Sure, take it as allegory if you must, but it's so obvious - through evolution, geology, cosmology, and just about any other "ology" you care to mention - that is' not true that i was horrified when I found out there are lots of people in the US who actually believe it.  Staggering.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	It's funny and sad at the same time, and yes, the fact that it is a serious (?!) belief in this day and age is indeed a scandal, and also an indication that something is very wrong in the world for people to clutch onto such absurd beliefs.|`|a9etFur6aa	Yeah. It's christian propaganda. Creationism has a place in school, perhaps, but definitely not in the science class. It's so obvious that Creationists are Christian and the constitution forbids the establishment of religion.

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

2eNX1wnJaa	While in the West (USA & Western Europe) "religion" is probably "anti-inspiring" but it still serves the other role in many parts of the world. However, the business of myth-building and engineered consent through subliminal channels is very much alive in USA and Europe. In fact, the propaganda business (PR as it is called euphemistically) stays a step ahead of the populace, which is increasing educated and sophisticated. However, the population at large is also increasingly specialized in their knowledge and less able to connect macro dots.<br>  <br>  Implicit in my answer is the notion that the mythology derived from the belief system has been the real vehicle behind the "inspirational" role of "religion" over the masses.<br>  <br>  Religion seems to have relatively more control over people's psyche if their primary concern is life after death. However, for the western population of "instant gratification"  myths have been created through information management. This worked pretty well for the oligarchy during the baby boomer's (folks born between 1946-1964) effective voting age (25-40 years or between 1971-2004) period in America. However, as the population is aging, we see re-emergence on the scene of the traditional "religion." <br>  <br>  Pendulum is swinging back! The question is whether organized religion (Church of Rome; Imam in Iran) will regain power, and as the question puts it, thwart progress, or whether religions will become decentralized, and tend toward a peer-to-peer model (like the Internet).  If the latter force attracts more followers, be prepared for major revision of doctrinal foundations of most religions.<br>  <br>  Finally, though I didn't talk about China or the communist countries, however, I'd assert that population management through myth building is very similar in these countries, as is the control system through religion based mythology elsewhere. Infact, the late Jospeh Campbell's has demonstrated that mythology defined cultures throughtout history (though, he seems to have viewed mythology in a positive light at least in the ancient cultures as well as modern native cultures).|`|yOK32PM9aa	What about fridge magnets?|`|l1ctIW7eaa	well, it's inspired them to make some good smelling incense...<br>  <br>  that's about all i can think of|`|CjRfJbncaa	1. The first film with simultaneous sound was invented in the early 1900s, by Jehovah's Witnesses.

It is a system that Jehovah’s Witnesses themselves have developed for getting written material published quickly in many languages. They developed MEPS because nowhere in the world was such a system available for publishing in the many languages in which they print their Bible literature.<br>  <br>  "Why was such a multilanguage publishing system unavailable anywhere in the world? Simply stated, because most printing is done for profit, and there was not sufficient monetary return to cover the cost of developing a computerized system for producing literature in many of the languages in which publications of the Watchtower Society are produced. But Jehovah’s Witnesses do not print for profit. Their sole objective in printing Bible literature is to help people of all nations and languages to learn about Jehovah God and his Kingdom government.—Matthew 6:9, 10; 24:14.<br>  <br>  "...Jehovah’s Witnesses had regularly been translating material into over 165 languages.

It has over 260,000 entries (... and is growing, because a huge revision is currently taking place - <a href="http://www.oed.com/news/updates/revisions0812.html)," rel="nofollow">http://www.oed.com/news/updates/revision...</a> whereas the DRAE - if I understand this correctly - has 'only' around 87,000 (cf. <a href="http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/)." rel="nofollow">http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/).</a> Apart from that - and to get back to your question *lol*: estimates of the yearly additions range from 5,000 to well over 25,000. It all depends on what you want to count as a new word / dictionary entry. E.g., if I were to enter a word like, .e.g. 'brinkmanship-like,' am I entering something new, or am I just enlarging on the existing entry of 'brinkmanship'?  :-)<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  whizip|`|ScR5xUM4aa	There's not a single, all mighty "English dictionary"; equivalent to other dictionaries such as the D.R.A.E. for Spanish. Also be aware that dictionaries only compromise words according to a form of the standard language, not the actual number words (which is FAAAR bigger in fact).<br>  <br>  You still can get stats for how many words are added/removed in dictionaries like the OxfordEnglishDictionary and MerriamWebsterUnabridged, but I don't know why you would want such numbers.
QQ2rTaPdaa	Dealing with the realities of life is hard sometimes. Some people need an imaginary cosmic shoulder to cry on.<br>  <br>  Sunsandnrain: I've never seen so many fallacies packed so closely together. That is without a doubt the worst attempt to argue a point I've come across today. (BTW: I'm referring to your first couple of lines, I didn't read the rest.)|`|7300b67211d400f8dc6e96e473093503aa	Is that what you think, there is more proof that God doesn't exist? Funny I feel the opposite, belief in God comes from having faith, that you cannot learn from a textbook. It comes from the heart of man and from his spirit. I have proof that God exists but because I have drawn near to Him and consequently He has drawn near to me, I can not deny the existence of God. God reveals Himself to those who seek Him, the more we seek Him the more of God we find. God's Word the Bible is living and truth. He is in every page, telling us about His love and mercy. He is there you just need to search for Him with a true heart.|`|Ldxf1tW1aa	Faith is a strong ally.  I have seen faith, figuratively, move mountains.

Why would this upstanding citizen- albeit-creator of mankind have so many aliases?<br>  Is he skipping out on something...child support I suspect..6 billion kids..I think I would change my identity too.<br>  The one reference for christians is the bible. It is full of lies and not just evidence of lies but PROOF.<br>  <br>  Mankind is around 4000-6000 years old. LIES!!! at least 60, 000 years old for homo-sapiens, then we have all of the other variations of man prior. Try studying carbon dating. A scientific proof that can be replicated over and over again.<br>  <br>  Noah's flood was global. LIES!!! It was regional! Sediment layers and many many other pointers prove this incorrect.<br>  <br>  The sun goes up and down. LIES!! The earth orbit the sun and may give this appearance to ignorant assuming people- but if the bible was the word of god then this literary error would not have occurred.<br>  <br>  There are many, many, many, many, many more...do you have all day?<br>  In the face of just these few examples... and in true genuine interest...How do you christians get up each morning, look yourself in the mirror, declare your membership to this notorious gang called christianity...and go on believe in the face of true reality? I really want to know what drives you to keeping your faith when some very, very basic fundamentals of the bible are now proven to be false. How can it be the word of god when it is soooo wrong?<br>  This is a curiousity that really perplexes me.|`|118h96Q8aa	This is new. Someone has solid, raw evidence that God is fake?

But suppose you are correct in saying more evidence one way versus the other.  Do you make everyday decisions by just finding which is more probable?  For example, suppose you must cross a bridge in order to get to work and you have no proof that the bridge will take the weight of your car, what do you do?  Quit your job?<br>  <br>  No, we take a chance based upon how much we desire to reach a goal.  If there was one chance in a hundred of winning 100 million dollars, wouldn't you take that chance?  How about one chance in a hundred of winning an ordinary rock, would you take that chance?  <br>  <br>  So is there any chance that God exists and what is God worth?  Those two questions go together.|`|SsSIbFhcaa	Please provide your proof that he does not exist.<br>  <br>  Since there no proof for his non existence you will not have a lot to provide.|`|2rJwgk40aa	Hope.some people feel the need to believe theres a purpose to life,a meaning.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Because He came into my life with the Holy Spirit, and all creation shouts out His name.

If you freak and claw at the windows to get out you just wind yourself up.  It's far better to just get in gear and drive somewhere wonderful - it's all about taking control of your own mind.  If you'd rather just get some sleep, avoid sleeping on your back and you'll get an 80% reduction in paralysis.|`|MF9YknDYaa	I have it sometimes,it's linked to stress.There is nothing supernatural about it.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	Astral epilepsy?<br>  Clear your mind by consulting a psychologist to take off any stress you have in life.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	I would try regression or some type of hypnosis as a last resort but possibly try meditating before bed.

There is so much mixing that even those who think they are keeping things pure by pairing up with someone of their own "race" has to know that their own genes/blood has already been diluted as much as 2,000 years ago.<br>  <br>  The world goes round and we go round with it. All is as it should be, don't fret.|`|42SDcehQaa	Yes, in a way, what you said is genocide if that's how you want to define it. Lets see how much war was going on when different countries were more separate from others. There has started to been more peace when majority of the countries became more intimate if you ever studied any history.<br>  <br>  Why does racial mixing occur? Because people wants to. You're basically criticizing the ones that are freely choosing who they want to be with and insulting them as well. Think deeply about this. It has nothing to do with you and what exactly is the outcome after this "evil act" is established? Except the part that certain race might disappear I don't see how it could cause any trouble economically or politically. The human population is only increasing and not one race is literally being killed or hurt from this. You can call it genocide while others are enjoying their life being married and having children with someone who they really love. But leave those people out of this and don't cause trouble just because you're not satisfied with your life like a little immature child.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	You are the second person called Nathan I have the mispleasure to know of that merits the nickname "A**y McGee."<br>  <br>  Look, Bozo, whether you like it or not, the races are gonna mix.  There wasn't no peace and order in the slave trade, was there?  And the races were separate there!  Even if everyone was mixed race, we'd still be diverse because we are all different, be it inside or outside.  And lastly, how is mixing the races genocide?  That's like saying a brown haired person and a blonde haired person having a kid is blonde genocide because the kid is more likely to have brown hair and so the blondeness wouldn't show up.  It makes no sense.  How is Johnson + va-jay-jay = baby makes three genocide?  It's called reproduction, and no matter what races are going at it, it's still the same thing.  Sex.  Reproduction.  Little baby.|`|OtLqGZK8aa	I doubt you "love that there are different types of people in the world"...what you mean by that is that you would love for whites not to mix but you don't care if asians and blacks and people who are already bi-racial, mix.

Its been proven time and time again.

UcXaXtrpaa	There are a good few skylines in the US and some do make it onto ebay <br>  The R34 does seem to sell in the US for around $70000 but to be fair it often sells in the UK where it is easy to buy but still sells for around ￡20-￡30 for a basic version and higher for the v-spec etc.<br>  But these cars sell for that price for many reasons one is the demand for them and not a great deal made as they where never made for international sale.Also the spec of the car itself even the basic as with any GTR is well advanced and what you get is an iconic legendary car which fits as a daily super car as it has super car power the Rb26dett engine can be tuned to well over 1000bhp,plenty of rear passenger room and room in the trunk for a big shopping trip,all this mixed with  handling which is advanced even today.<br>  So yes they are expensive but well worth any money spend as there not a car you would keep for a year then sell on these sort of cars you can keep and it will fit all your needs and still attract crowds.<br>  <br>  Cheaper option would be the GTS-T or the GTT versions as well as the GTS GT GTS4 GT4 versions ,the single turbo versions offer great rwd handling mixed with a super tunable Rb25det engine which can see scary bhp figures and example as there is an R33 GTS-T in my town running a dyno<br>  750bhp.<br>  The R33 Goes for around $22000+ but again well worth it the R33 is a great car and very popular Worldwide and often used by major tuning companies,World drag awd record was won for many years by a R33 other great R33 are out there and set many Records.<br>  Don't overlook the R32 version also as these are also great cars and technology is not dated and is still well above many cars which are out now and an iconic car which changed motor racing rules to stop it taking part due to all its wins.<br>  Other option is an importer who can sell one to the US i know of one which i can send your a site.|`|lQGwzBoJaa	How about you put this in the auto section?

XLXncQu9aa	I'm a male and I don't think that about women.  But this type of attitude comes from the fact that generally males were created to hold leadership positions from the beginning of time.  Throughout out society most males have taken leadership roles and they are seen as the figure head in marriages, organizations, and in life in general.  It doesn't mean women don't or shouldn't be leaders but society has dictated that down the years.  When you look at the times during the 1600 and 1700's many males did not think much of how women were treated.  They had no rights at that time.  Over time women have found a voice to let others know they too can lead and have a place other than the kitchen or at home.  I believe it comes from lack of understanding and holding on to the old ways of the past.  Until we let go of the old stereotypes of the past that women are less than men then it won't change.  Some things have changed but to keep progress going we males should acknowledge how powerful a woman can be and that she should not be limited.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Its supported Biblically, so if your classmates are of a Christian religion that could be why.<br>  <br>  Its a part of a patriarchal belief system.  The men went out and did the work the women cared for the children.  This was, in part, however also due to the lack of medical technology.  Even today pregnancy and child birth are high risk  medically.  At that time, they didnt have any of the medical technology we have and very little of the knowledge we have.  In order to help keep women safe during pregnancy, the women stayed in bed.  And that honestly wasnt against women, it was honestly done FOR the women and children.  They didnt know what caused miscarriages or damages to the baby, so they thought bed rest was healthier.<br>  And in those times, having many children was important for the family unit to function in farming and hunting and having enough supplies to support the family.  How can a woman sow the fields when she has to be on bed rest?<br>  <br>  Times have changed though.  We have a ton more medical knowledge and now we know what causes miscarriages and injuries to the fetus and we know what women can and cant do while preg so they dont have to be on bed rest while preg.  Unfortunatly, not all societal beliefs have caught up to where we are technologically.

But when you think that the Bible itself was "bowdlerized" to remove any and all reference to female deity, any such legend of the Greeks was unlikely to have escaped unscathed. It is a fact that so thorough a job was done by the Church in this regard, that we would have no knowledge of the religion of the Greeks if copies of their legends and myths had not survived in the libraries of the Arab/Sufi Schools of the Middle East.

fUyULtOcaa	From Talk sex with Sue Johnson<br>  Anal sex, bum sex, sex by the back door, the Greek or Italian way, fudge-packing and sodomy - these are some of the terms used to describe anal sex. It involves anal penetration of the anus (or rectum) by an erect penis or even a vibrator, dildo or "*********."<br>  <br>  Previously regarded as sexual activity primarily practised by male homosexuals, it now appears to be a fairly common, even acceptable, alternative to vaginal intercourse amongst heterosexuals. The most common questions we get on the show relate to anal intercourse - how to do it, is it dangerous, does it hurt, why do people want to do it, is it pleasurable for the female, and how do I talk my partner into trying it?<br>  <br>  This is a very controversial and a very sensitive, even taboo, topic amongst many mature people, and I would not want to offend, but anal sex is also high risk behavior and we have an obligation to provide accurate information so younger people can make an informed decision.<br>  <br>  First - anatomy. At the lower end of the bowel, there are two distinct circular bands of muscles, sphincters, one is located about an 1 ?" above the other. These clamp down tight to prevent the passage of feces or gas. The mucous membrane lining of the rectum is not as heavy as the lining of the vagina, so it can tear quite easily and it does not heal as quickly as the vagina. Because feces, loaded with bacteria, are passing by, any tear is vulnerable to infection.<br>  <br>  The vigorous thrusting that may occur during anal intercourse can tear the mucous membrane. This can develop into an anal abscess that can become infected - more about that in a moment. Also, if your partner has any of the sexually transmitted infections (STI's), then you could get infected through the tear. So we are talking about gonorrhea (treatable); venereal warts (treatable if external, difficult if up in the rectum); syphilis (treatable); herpes (treatment, no cure); yeast infection (treatable); and HIV and AIDS (treatment but no cure.) You do not want any of these STI's.<br>  <br>  Preferably, you're in a long-term, committed relationship, infection free, and practising SAFER SEX.<br>  <br>  But wait, there's more bad news. A “fissure” is a tear up in the rectum can develop into a crack, and become infected.<br>  <br>  It can gradually extend out through the wall of the bowel and form a channel across, through and into a nearby organ. That's called a "fistula", and it would allow feces to flow from the rectum into the vagina and out.<br>  <br>  Repairing tears, fissures and fistulas is delicate surgery and recovery can be long and painful.<br>  <br>  Some doctors will tell you that hemorrhoids (piles) could result from vigorous anal sex, and although I have no medical research, I have heard people say that the rectum "gets sloppy", stretched. I am dubious - if this was true, why doesn't it get sloppy with regular bowel movements? With no definitive research, you do the math.<br>  <br>  The best prevention is "don't go there". But if you do decide to try it, you and your partner must talk about it beforehand and agree on these points:<br>  <br>  1. Your partner must be very, very gentle, absolutely no forced penetration and no vigorous thrusting.<br>  2. You must use lots and lots of good lubrication, (anal lube, not saliva).<br>  3. Your partner must use a condom…all the time, every time.<br>  4. Your partner must respect "stop". If you say ouch, or it hurts, or No or quit… they must stop immediately.<br>  5. It must be understood, if you do not want to have anal sex again, there will be no pressure, no threats and no pleading. NO means NO.<br>  6. Use a well-lubricated condom without spermicide, either on the sex toy or his penis. Spermicide can irritate the rectum.<br>  7. Never shift from anal sex back to vaginal sex without changing condoms. Feces can end up in the vagina and cause infections. And please wash your hands with soap and water after handling the dirty condom or you could still spread infectious material.<br>  <br>  There are some who really enjoy giving and receiving anal pleasure; some females feel that they have their best orgasms ever; some females oblige simply because their partner really enjoys anal sex; and for other females, it is just gross, embarrassing or disgusting.<br>  <br>  For men who have sex with men, it can be very satisfying sex.<br>  <br>  As to why the sudden increase in anal sexual activity, again, I have no studies but I suspect anal sex is the last taboo. Females believe that they won't get pregnant with anal sex. This is true, UNLESS ejaculate flows down over her genitals. Young females believe they are still a virgin if they have bum sex. Basically, this is true, but it is semantics. How much is "if you really loved me, you'd prove your love by doing this?" And how much is proof of power and control, dominant v.s. submissive. And of course, some of it is just good, old curiosity. "Try it, you'll like it."<br>  <br>  I get very upset when guys ask, "How can I talk my girlfriend into having anal sex?" My reply: "I hope you c|`|3mAgM405aa	Anal sex is quite enjoyable and will take some preprep before engaging in it.<br>  <br>  Begin by:<br>  <br>  1. Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	Anal sex is taking a penis up your bum|`|AA12156890	intercourse via the anus, committed by a man with a man or woman|`|wPnJekdqaa	It's sex but in the butt.|`|3v0rbyxpaa	It is exactly what it says. anal sex.|`|Vu726Q18aa	sex in the @ss|`|PPyMhRJAaa	?Bisexual Tomboy ☆ has it spot on.

MvZMA5BGaa	No.<br>  <br>  The laws of karma and reincarnation are man made and wretched.<br>  If you travel to a places in the world where people truly believe, you will find the true nature of it and how it holds people in it's grip.<br>  Thanks to lack of education and with the help of men like Deepak Chopra, <br>  Westerners have a very watered down idea of it.<br>  Take for example a person that has caused much destruction - Hitler, for example, as his name always comes up. Karma and reincarnation teaches that upon his death, the bad karma he accumulated goes on into another life but the recipient has no idea of the weight they are carrying. Hitler's soul could be reincarnated into another person, animal or insect. There are some people that wear mouth and nose coverings to avoid breathing someone in. (I'm not joking.)<br>  In countries where karma rules the day and homeless children roam the street, other citizens do nothing to help them. Not because they are cruel but because the child has accumulated bad karma and they believe the sooner the child dies he can begin again. I saw a news article a few years back about a heartbroken mother that had lost her 13 year son to an early death. Just after the funeral, an iguana walked into her home. The photo showed her with tears rolling down her face as she held it - because she was convinced it was her son reincarnated. <br>  I strongly suggest the book by Ravi Zacharais called "Jesus Among Other Gods". He was raised in India and has a clear understanding of these things - and he takes strong offense to the tripe dished out by Deepak Chopra.|`|nhGIZE71aa	Reincarnation doesn't refer to biological structures.

Surely this is an apt description of evolution. <br>  Evolution is a 'belief system' i.e. a religion !<br>  <br>  Models of science are subject to change for both creationists and evolutionists. But, the beliefs that these models are built on are not. The problem is that most scientists do not realize that it is the belief (religion) of evolution that is the basis for scientific models (the interpretations, or stories) used to attempt an explanation of the present. Evolutionists are not prepared to change their actual belief that all life can be explained by natural processes and that no God is involved (or even needed).

Lk4aCBACaa	First off, Paganism is an umbrella term for a wide variety of faiths with many different beliefs. Some Pagans may believe the things you've listed here, not all of them will.<br>  <br>  Second paragraph: your use of the word "cardinal" is unclear, especially since the signs you're talking about here are the Mutable signs (Gem, Vir, Sag, Pis), whereas Cardinal signs are Ari, Can, Lib & Cap. The way I relate to Cardinal signs is the initiators of their respective seasons, regardless of what Age we're in. Aries starts Spring, Cancer starts Summer, Libra starts Autumn, Capricorn starts Winter. The Fixed signs are the strongest representation of their respective seasons, while the Mutables are the transitions from one season into another, mingling the qualities of both. The same holds true in the Southern hemisphere, the seasons are just the opposite of ours, but the Cardinal signs still start them.<br>  <br>  Now the polarity of Pisces & Virgo is an important part of the Age of Pisces and you can see its symbolism in many places. (Take Christianity, the dominant religion of the Age of Pisces.) But if I'm understanding you correctly, you seem to be equating Pisces with all the "good" things of the Age when you call it "life bringer," and equating Virgo with the negative things of the Age when you call it "devourer." A more accurate way of putting it is that this polarity needs to be balanced, and extremes represented by *either* sign are going to bring about negative ends.<br>  <br>  So moving on to your specific questions:<br>  1. I do expect to see different expressions, given that the highlighted polarity will be between Aquarius and Leo rather than Pisces/Virgo.<br>  <br>  But I would disagree with your assumption that this Age change is "soon-to-commence." We've got over another 100 years yet. There are only two possible dates for the changeover: when the Spring Equinox occurs in the constellation of Aquarius, or when it occurs in the Zodiac sign of Aquarius. (Unbeknownst to many, the constellations and the Zodiac signs that share their names are *not* the same thing.) Any other speculative dates are based around many planets being in Aquarius, or "really cool!" aspect patterns featuring Aquarius and Uranus, all of which miss the point of what an Astrological Age actually is.<br>  <br>  2. Again, only the overall Age is changing. The Zodiac and its meanings will be the same on a personal level. Collectively, humanity as a whole will be dealing with the Aquarius/Leo polarity and the things it represents.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it would help to explain that I don't follow a causal explanation of astrology: I don't believe the stars "make" anything happen, rather I see astrology as a reflection of what is already occuring through some kind of synchronicity. So to me, the Zodiac will continue to symbolize the same things it always has.<br>  <br>  3. I don't think the hemisphere is relevant to the overall Age, or to astrology in general. A person in Australia born on April 10 still has their Sun in Aries, they're just experiencing different weather than the Northern hemisphere does at that time of year. The Age is dependent on the tilt of the Earth's axis as a whole, thus the whole Earth is in the same Age.<br>  <br>  4. It depends. If - like me - you see the Zodiac as deriving its meaning from archetypes that are common to people of many different cultures, then no. A planet in Aries is a planet in Aries, regardless of which hemisphere. There are a minority though that assign traits to the Zodiac signs based on the seasons, and that would account for some interpreting them differently as you suggest. But as I've said, I don't believe the Zodiac acquires their meaning from the qualities of the seasons they occur in.<br>  <br>  5. Cusps are a pet peeve of mine. :) There really is no such thing as a cusp. Just as any planet is definitely in one sign or another, we are definitely in one Age or another. We are currently in the Age of Pisces. We will not be in the Age of Aquarius until one of the two aforementioned requirements is met, period. Just as the Mutable signs represent transition from one season into the next and may have qualities of both, so does the current timeframe we're in. We're transitioning into the Aquarian Age, but we're definitely still in the Piscean one. Look around you at the religious fanatics trying desperately to hold onto their power through whatever means necessary; they know their time of dominance is coming to an end, and thus we're seeing a high amount of negative, extreme Pisces right now.<br>  <br>  In closing though, let's not expect that the Age of Aquarius will be all love and light, peace and brotherhood like the musical song. :) Every sign has its good and bad sides, and thus so will every Age. We'll still have problems, they'll just be different kinds of problems.|`|KAI2WUqpaa	Religion is nonsense.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	As far as Paganism is considered, it's really an umbrella term that encompasses many different non-Abrahamic beliefs.  <br>  <br>  Even as an atheist I think that astrology has some merit (thanks in advance for the td), but it must have some naturalistic explanation. <br>  <br>  I don't believe in the forecasts you read in the newspaper, but a few years ago, I was astounded when a friend sent me a "professional" personality profile. There was nothing vague about it. I don't understand how it works and I don't believe in magic, or the supernatural, but it seemed incredibly precise.|`|zlVqTNtjaa	you lost me at curiosity

At the end of 2008, worldwide nameplate capacity of wind-powered generators was 120.8 gigawatts.[1] Although wind produces only about 1.5% of worldwide electricity use,[1] it is growing rapidly, having doubled in the three years between 2005 and 2008. In several countries it has achieved relatively high levels of penetration, accounting for approximately 19% of electricity production in Denmark, 10% in Spain and Portugal, and 7% in Germany and the Republic of Ireland in 2008.<br>  <br>  Wind energy has historically been used directly to propel sailing ships or converted into mechanical energy for pumping water or grinding grain, but the principal application of wind power today is the generation of electricity. Large scale wind farms are typically connected to the local electric power transmission network, with smaller turbines being used to provide electricity to isolated locations. Utility companies increasingly buy back surplus electricity produced by small domestic turbines. Wind energy as a power source is favoured by many environmentalists as an alternative to fossil fuels, as it is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, and produces lower greenhouse gas emissions, although the construction of wind farms is not universally welcomed due to their visual impact and other effects on the environment. The intermittency of wind seldom creates problems when using wind power to supply a low proportion of total demand. Where wind is to be used for a moderate fraction of demand, additional costs for compensation of intermittency are considered to be modest.<br>  <br>  thats nice you can copy and paste.

If a person is not on the right path as far as God's commandments are concerned, then the trials in his life is meant to bring him back to the path of righteousness.

mOaG5ueZaa	There are no second chances. See Hebrews 9:27, it's appointed for man to die once and then the judgment. The fact is that God has warned us. If anyone dies without being forgiven by Jesus, then they will spend eternity in Hell. It's very reasonable, because God has warned us. The problem is that atheists have twisted the facts around and drawn a false conclusion. Creation attests to the fact that there's a God, and we will be without excuse (Romans 1:20).

Who could possibly object to having the answers to the questions of the most profound and far-reaching import?<br>  <br>  Let's see -- two classes of people come to mind.  Professional clergy are going to fight tooth and nail to preserve their incomes in the face of the upstart religion.  And people who like their sins and don't want to be bothered with repentance are going to fight to the death -- the prophet's death -- to destroy him and the Lord's works.  In this sense, atheists are at least a little more honest than Christians who don't follow Christ or think they don't need to do as he commanded.<br>  <br>  Jesus' true church was never very popular.

4K3TuGPzaa	Hi Hollywood,<br>  <br>  This is actually quite a 'big question,' you know. :-) - Here's, e.g. an excerpt on the 'problem' of calendars: 'The Romans often cited events from the traditional foundation of their city ab urbe condita, or A.U.C., said to be 753 BCE (although later they used years A.D. that is, after the emperor Diocletian, ruled 284-305 CE). During the Republic, they also cited years using the names of reigning consuls, and of course in the Imperial period, they often used Roman emperors, for instance, an historian might say, during the reign of Tiberius, such and such occurred.'<br>  If you want to 'know it all' (or, a fair share of it *lol*) go to: <br>  <a href="http://www.exovedate.com/a_history_of_the_calendar.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.exovedate.com/a_history_of_th...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  whizip|`|AA11727971	did the average person have calenders back then?<br>  did they even keep track of what year it was?|`|O7w6XGqPaa	There were local calenders, not the Gregorian calendar in use today. Usually they counted the passage of the years as the first or fifth or whatever of a particular king, consul, emperor, etc. Very parochial and complicated with no easy way to tell how many years between the sixth year of the reign of ABC and the ninth year of XYZ.<br>  <br>  We still see some of that into modern times. The Japanese use the common calendar but also refer to the era name, the name for the reign of a particular emperor.<br>  <br>  "The Japanese era calendar scheme is a common calendar scheme used in Japan, which identifies a year by the combination of the Japanese era name (年号 nengō?, lit. year name) and the year number within the era. For example, the year 2009 is Heisei 21.<br>  As elsewhere in East Asia, the use of nengō, also known as "gengō" (元号?), was originally derived from Chinese Imperial practice, although the Japanese system is independent of the Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese era-naming systems. Unlike these other similar systems, Japanese era names are still in use. Government offices usually require era names and years for official papers." <br>  [Wikipedia]
ShaUAySvaa	all you have to do is say you are satanic worshiper and will condemn their souls to hell if they talk about religion anymore|`|WwCBomTMaa	Most people don't want to hear it because they don't want to know that they are doing wrong. But what is concidered pushing religion? Discussing religion? Or telling someone they are going to hell? Some people have gotten upset with me for discussing religion. Personally I find religion an interesting topic, regardless of whether it is my religion or not. However, I will never tell someone they are going to hell. It is not for me to decide who is going to hell or not, it is for God to decide. All that I can do is lead by example and try to help others find the right path. But that doesn't mean attacking those with different beliefs. Educated debate helps people learn far better than jamming your religious beliefs down someone elses throats.|`|tgUjQJXgaa	Technically no one can force you to do anything or believe anything that you don't want to, but trying to force someone to believe in something isn't a good idea. Everyone believes in something for different reasons either they are realistic reasons or something they may have had an experience with once. Still I don't think that anyone should be forced to do anything because then you become a mindless drone and have no reason  for believing it in the first place. I think if your starting a religion, a hobby, or anything ask questions and really look and see what it is you doing before you do anything.|`|4vv1ElyJaa	It's annoying.

But when someone is religious and they feel they know something good and want to just share it with someone else because they feel that its something good and has changed their life for the better. Its just being nice, but if you didnt tell them your not intrested, you should before you start thinking they are trying to pushing their religion on you. If you tell they your not intrested and they still keep going, they thats pushing it on you.......|`|cl4wdRnvaa	I despise those that try to shove their beliefs on others.

Right now it is thought to be important that the children grow up with everything that other children get.  I think it would be better for the children to grow up with nothing more than they need - so that they spend their entire childhood determined not to put another child through their upbringing, and to be nothing like their parents.  I went to school with people who planned to spend their life on benefits, as far as they were concerned why should they work when someone was going to give them money for nothing.

AA10311549	A situation like that is NEVER explainable by a simple answer.<br>  <br>  I am sure that many teens are just as abused by their peers and just as alienated who never even contemplated what those kids did.  Thus no doubt their particular personalities :felt' the hurt and pain much more so than others in similar situations.  I would not go so far as to call any of this a "mental condition" if that implies some kind of pathology.<br>  <br>  It is an aspect of immature cognitive function that the nuancing of moral right and wrong is also not a great ability of the immature teen cognitive ability.  Things that they could consider as "right" when 15 or 16 would not be contemplated a few years later.  (And also a good reason why NOT to try teens as adults).<br>  <br>  However, the cruelty of others obvious was a major factor.  I also suspect that without the TWO of them supporting each other it would also never have happened.<br>  <br>  Many people are alienated for many reasons and teens are especially vulnerable.  They do not have the experience nor mental maturity to withstand the onslaught and the pain it engenders.  And if they can not get any support at home their situation can become desperate.<br>  <br>  As adults and especially working in a High School we need to be especially attuned to anyone in this kind of position as that they can appear almost "normal" but with an underlying seething resentment and unresolved pain.<br>  <br>  (Other personalities could just as well have resorted to suicide).<br>  <br>  As for music and other minor externals, I doubt they are contributory.|`|95a054862f66114bc2215248c4e68b98aa	Hmmmmmm.

In other words if we reject a lot of activities because of how we personally judge them, then we also stand the chance of missing out on the many people involved in the world that are first and foremost faithful to God...<br>  <br>  I would suggest looking into how wrestling is treated by Christian colleges - they may have some very relevant answers for you since they've obviously reconciled the sport with their Christian school policies...  Wrestling does teach strength training and good sportsmanship and I believe is an Olympic sport. <br>  <br>  I think it's good that you are concerned about the possible issues that could result from letting you son become involved  in the sport of wrestling.  It may or may not be for him - only he can ultimately decide that...<br>  <br>  Don't forget, Christians need to be as strong as anyone else in the world, right? With that in mind, maybe it is a good idea and even a "holy activity" to build our strength in the Lord, both mentally and physically...<br>  <br>  Is this your only son, or something like that? Personally, I think you should at least let him try. I remember at least learning about and experiencing wrestling in gym class. I remember it was a good experience where I learned a few things I think my Creator would want me to know about...<br>  <br>  If you feel so strongly about it, like the violence of it or something to that effect, which is certainly a legitimate and obvious concern, maybe let your son join the team for one season under the condition he do something to balance or round out his experience, like some kind of community service where he's helping people and can show he cares about his community and that he is also concerned and won't let the apparent violence of wrestling get the best of him or allow him to be an angry or violent person in any way...<br>  <br>  this last point seems kind of extreme to me, but it could help to put to rest any concerns you may have about him being involved in sports. Hopefully, you'll let him be involved at some point, so he can have friends and positive experiences at school, but you've got to let him decide what he's best at...|`|OUbNSXjJaa	In this world everything is to be taken as positive or negative.

You don't have to stand there being insulted and your "friend" isn't really a friend if she's doing this to you.  It's rude and it's hurtful.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	Yes, that is quite rude and unkind.  It sounds like she is either clueless about other peoples' feelings, or she is deliberately bullying by exclusion.

545c8190dd574a20dff4291cb029a8ccaa	Christians tend to take small verses out of the context it was written in, and try to put themselves and others back under the law which belief in Jesus abolished. <br>  <br>  A good example of taking things out of context to support an arguement is the person who answered to look at verse 13 for support that it was an individual's choice.<br>  <br>  In this case, the letter of Corinthians was written to address a particular abuse in the Corinthian church. You need to look beyond this, and find the spiritual meanig underneath. <br>  <br>  And if you question the Orthodox Christians about this, we would need to also point a finger at:<br>  <br>  1. Catholics. Why does the Pope cover his head (and the bishops) when he prays? Why do they have such ornate churches, against the commandment not to worship false images?<br>  <br>  2. Methodists. Why do they support gay marriages?<br>  <br>  3. Baptists. Why do they insist you are not saved if you are not baptised?<br>  <br>  4. Pentecostals. Why do they say you are not saved if you do not speak in tongues?<br>  <br>  And just so everyoen knows I am an equal opportunity criticizer, and simply pointing out some examples...<br>  <br>  All Protestant churches also violate some "scripture" if you nitpick the bible out of context: allowing women to speak, women to sit with the men, women (and men) wearing earrings, women praying without covering their heads, eating forbidden foods, hanging out with undesireable people, not hanging out with undesireable people, judging others (including other Christian churches), playing music in church, not playing music in church, dancing, not dancing...<br>  <br>  I always say that God made scripture a tad confusing on purpose, to keep us from falling back under the law.<br>  <br>  The most important verse to keep in mind is John 5:24 "I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life."|`|ki0tOVUYaa	biblical literalism is spiritual cancer|`|pGf4mIw9aa	The same way the rest of the churches ignore the ways of Paul.

Please remember that Jesus Christ has long hair too.

It is one of the signs of separation from the world for the service of God.<br>  <br>  In short, the priest's hat is as a crown and he wears it because he represents Christ the King in the symbolism of the Church.<br>  <br>  May I please ask, do women cover their heads in your form of worship?<br>  ~~~<br>  P.S. Jesus Christ has long hair. By denying this you show that you do not know what Christ looks like. Every Church on earth founded by an Apostle agrees on what Christ looks like and they all say He has long hair. Have the gates of hell/hades prevailed against the Church Christ established or was Christ wrong when He said they would never?<br>  This may be a minor issue to ask such a question on but it is the root cause of your misunderstanding.

fP8H3n3baa	While the New World Order could be used by a person as simply a phrase that they heard and are repeating, it could have a deeper meaning with strong historical roots. To think that there could be a new & better world -- one of peace & plenty -- might be attractive to a lot of folks. There's been a lot of talk for centuries about Utopia. Hence, "new world order" could be just a phrase that innocently expresses that sentiment; perhaps innocently stated by some politicans. Or.... could have an inside meaning to some like what follows:<br>  <br>  The NWO was being initiated in 1775-1785 by Adam Weishaupt. Here's a quote:<br>  "..those individuals who are members of the Illuminati possess the 'Light of Lucifer'. As far as they are concerned, only members of the human race who possess the 'Light of Lucifer' are truly enlightened and capable of governing. Denouncing God, Weishaupt and his followers considered themselves to be the cream of the intelligentsia - the only people with the mental capacity, the knowledge, the insight and understanding necessary to govern the world and bring it peace. Their avowed purpose and goal was the establishment of a 'Novus Ordo Seclorum' - a New World Order, or One World Government."<br>  <br>  The "ops" who manipulate and control politicians who are susceptible to sex, drink, homosexuality, drugs, money, etc in order to start wars in order for the international bankers to get rich financing them.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to start your lengthy research:|`|3lfQjtpPaa	NWO stands for new world order, 2 different meanings is all i know of. 1: an old wwe thing<br>  2: people suspect that behind the scenes of the government, there is a conspiracy that will supposedly cause the end of the world|`|phCB66n1aa	New World Order is a group plotting the take over of the worlds governments and industry it also was a WCW wrestling team.|`|X2cdkfjgaa	New World Order.

In order to lessen some of our problems, just make the ones that's having trouble to leave somewhere else.|`|DqmMW2tcaa	Perhaps in therory, but in practice some people can't live in their homelands due to persecution and political unstability. For example Jews in Germany during WW2. The fact that there are different races isn't the problem, it is peoples cultural perception creates the problem.
8cuPVvYnaa	You are right. This world is not fair, nor is it just. And according to the Bible, God would agree with you. There is much in there about caring for the poor and needy. But we as humans tend to care only about ourselves, and you see this everyday. But according to the Bible there will come a time when this stops. It says that someday Jesus will come back and reign on earth and I believe it will be wonderful. In Isaiah 11 it prophesies about Him: "The spirit of the Lord will rest on him; the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of power, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord, and he will delight in the fear of the Lord (fear=respect). He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, or decide by what he hears with his ears, but with righteousness he will make decisions for the needy, with justice he will make decisions for the poor of the earth.....The earth will be frull of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea." and in chapter 30: "The Lord is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for Him."<br>  <br>  I think we need to do all we can to bring justice to the earth. We need to be an example of selflessness. Even if others do not, we should care for the needy and suffering of this earth (Even if we don't have much ourselves. There are always ways we can help others.). We mustn't wait until this day I describe. But oh how I long for it. Jesus will set everything right. He will deal with those who oppress others, those who abuse people and harm children.

My heart, like yours, hurts over this.|`|VpU4Aludaa	Everybody has his paket on his shoulder and as well everybody has some fun in his life somehow.<br>  Sure it will be on different levels and normaly these sides are in the" back "and can"t be seen by everybody.<br>  there are some people were born with a silver spoon in their mouth or in there "kitchen".<br>  :P<br>  but not realy Sad.<br>  Thanks so much…<br>  lovely saturday.<br>  .|`|c6ff08c632b9e5165a8a3d098d3a1710aa	We are all born into a damaged world from a history starting way back in the days of Adam and Eve.

The sun had just set, and I felt this peace come over me, a gentle presence, so sweet, so wholesome.  I could feel the spiritual power of Sabbath, not a booming, dominating power, but rather gentle, but not less potent for its softness.<br>  <br>  I remember sitting at my kitchen table and thinking about God as my Creator, the simple, peaceful knowledge of him as my designer, the knowledge of his presence, his love.  Wow.<br>  <br>  I love Sabbath. :-)|`|akwVAZcEaa	Didn't even know what a Sabbath was until about 13 years ago and, when first observing it as one of God's Commandments, it was quite difficult because I wasn't sure on how to observe it.<br>  Isaiah 58:13 & 14 explained.<br>  It took about 3 months to re-adjust from a complex and worrying life-style to a relaxed Sabbath but now it's the day I most look forward to every week - from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday.<br>  I'm using it today to answer good questions like yours.<br>  Blessings.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	I was like a week old, were my eyes even open yet.

nI2xSDhLaa	Tea room for lunch - fancy restaurant for dinner - 2 dozen roses and candy|`|2U27BgmKaa	Well, my birthday was February 7th, so he took me to the Melting Pot fondue restaurant for that. Then for Valentine's Day he got me 9 giant Hershey bars for the 9 months that we had been together. I cooked us a really nice meal of salmon, rice, zucchini and summer squash, then we ate some of my chocolate while cuddling on the couch. All that was great, but the best thing was falling asleep in his arms after we made love and waking up still being held. Then we had oatmeal, lots of kisses, and went to work.|`|3VxmsXWoaa	he took me to lunch, arcade, dinner, rented movies and we had sex, then took me to lunch the next day and had more sex. bought me a card and a cute vday stuffed animal :) the arcade was fun because we're older than all of the people that go there... in and out of college|`|u1t12bsAaa	We have been married 28 years and we are still best friends.

Life is good!!|`|X05GAaLeaa	We went to a party <br>  and then we had amazing sex<br>  <br>  I had loads of fun|`|w6dNnejDaa	we went to the restaurant and got me a channel gold necklace|`|eevOrwypaa	Valentines day was our 14th month annaversery and it was on the 14th so it was kind of special to us. My boyfriend bought me a heart shaped promise ring. It has 8 diamonds on one of the sides and it is 10K white gold :) On valentines day, he gave it to me in a valentines day card that had a ribbon on the inside. He tied the ring to the ribbon. It was so cute! Then for the rest of the day we spent the day with one another and we went out to dinner at gengis grill with another couple. After dinner we went back to my boyfriend's house with the other couple and we snuggled on the couch watching a movie until midnight. It was a lot of fun :)

m0JxvNetaa	Make your decision confidently. I guess she can stand it because she once had good feelings about black guys and maybe your boy friend makes her feel the same. If you don't want to get dumped as your mother did, look into your boy friend's family. Has he experienced good family ties or not? Has his father left them or not? It tells a lot since most of times guys look after their father in such relationships.|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	People who have been badly hurt by someone tend to lash out at that person's entire race or culture. It's unfortunate but it happens a lot. You should detach yourself from your mother's view, because we are all of the human race and you will find abusiveness, pettiness, cheapness, and all other negative traits in every-single-race-and-culture on the planet.<br>  <br>  If you want to find your soulmate, start looking at people's souls. ;-)|`|jdKTs3aHaa	um sweetie if your mom married and had children w/ a black man then i'm sure she wont mind you seeing one xD<br>  edit: sorry didn't see the abuse part @_@ date who ever you want anyway.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Right, your mom is just bitter over the divorce so wants to put down black people.'<br>  <br>  If your mom is so superficial that she would kick you out the house for dating some because of the color of their skin she probably doesn't love you. If she loves you she will respect you and your decision provided they are not completly idiotic.<br>  <br>  Don't you think it is hypocritical that your mom got to date who she wanted but you can't date who you want?<br>  <br>  Don't you think its racist too.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Wow your mom's racist, you are her seed and you half black, if you diss black guys, you are self-racist.

Many people make the mistake of thinking that every person who gets into a mixed relationship must be open-minded and not racist. However, based on numerous racist comments I've heard from non-black women with children by a black man, I know that in more cases than you'd think, these relationships are founded upon belief in "positive" stereotypes or low self-esteem or other twisted racial thinking. I know of white women, who in anger, call their exes a n-word in front of the children. Some of them make very negative comments about the features of the children that show their African ancestry.<br>  <br>  You are free to date who you want, however, if that guy ever mistreats you, don't expect your mom to be sympathetic. Don't talk to her about black men, period. She has major issues, and you two will argue.|`|tusCN8zpaa	Your mom's just hurt from what happened to her. She has to understand that not all people  are the same, and that theres good people out there regardless of ethnicity. for example That would be like my mother telling me not to date white people because they all think they are better than me and will lynch me. I wouldn't listen to her because I know EVERYONE is different. I think date who you want. How old are you 18?, I think your old enough to make your own decisions about stuff like that.|`|ESlIwRGqaa	Its obvious. Your black dad was a deadbeat dad and left her for dead and she doesn't want the same thing happening to you.

It's just a question. Just say,"always be safe as you can, and always be alert."  I'd probably ask the same thing if I didn't know an area too much, but I am half white.  and it doesn't take a racist to know a racist.  that kind of logic is non-sequitor.  That's like saying, "if you see a dead person, you are dead because it takes one to know one."|`|rwrDD14Jaa	I don't think they meant to be racist they probably just heard about the high crime rate in Atlanta and their asking you if it would be safe for them to walk across the street by themselves.

suSWUm5Jaa	Bonjour!<br>  <br>  Rosetta Stone is the most famous one but I find it too rigid, not fun and not so good for grammar - and it is VERY expensive too! Way overrated.<br>  <br>  I have used Rocket French. It is really good, especially for speaking skills. It works great. If you devote sufficient time (15 minutes or so daily), you will learn fast. It is complete, serious though fun. Fun is important to learn a language because, as I have just mentioned, you need to study it everyday. You can download the program (much cheaper than Rosetta) or you can order the hard copy (more expensive than downloading it but still cheaper than Rosetta). Follow the program, be committed and you will reach a great level fast!<br>  <br>  By the way, I have learned a few foreign languages. I just love languages.

AA11479750	The story of Job is a glaring example of the absurdity of the biblical god.|`|AA10242926	We are the clay<br>  <br>  God is the sculpter<br>  <br>  Question if you must<br>  <br>  But in comparison.

If we suffer unjustly, in this life, in ten thousand years, won't that which we suffered seem miniscual?|`|AA11579596	The kid wasnt killed, keep reading|`|NR2o2S53aa	As human beings, we are given the gift of Free Will. That gift can used in a good way or a bad way. It is up to us to decide which path to take on our journey through life. It would be ideal if we all used that gift in the best way possible, but we are weak and often make the wrong choices. Job used his free will choice in the way he believed he should. His children certainly used their free will the way they wanted to. Satan and his evil are very real and very seductive at times.God cannot be wrong. He is always right. People, on the other hand, are sometimes right, and sometimes wrong. Satan makes evil seem so easy compared to making the right decision. It's so hard to resist sometimes and Job's children fell prey to that evil.  I am interested to know your thoughts on God. Do you consider Him to be evil then?|`|OpcuSFn4aa	Wait, are you actually suggesting that Christians should stand up and profess to having a part in the death of Jobs Children?<br>  Are you mad or just stupid?<br>  <br>  First of all, you have the Bible knowledge that God gave a grapefruit.<br>  Second, The name "Job" means "persecuted", and Job was a "type" for Gods election.<br>  The entire event of Job was a teaching. Job, being of Gods Election, finally realized that it was a teaching, and was recompensed seven-fold with all restored.<br>  There is quite a bit in the book that is of a deeper study, but the elementary teaching is a precious one: The first 38 chapters are nothing more than Jobs friends who come to try to convince him to simply admit to his sins and repent. After 38 chapters of blah blah blah from those friends, God speaks, and tells Job "what are you listening to those unlearned for? Listen to ME".<br>  Then God asks Job a series of questions and the point God makes is that as men,<br>  our understanding is limited, but if we need to know what is going on in our lives, esspecially when persecution comes, or when we feel as if Satan is attacking us - those answers will come from God, not some man.<br>  This Book is a real important lesson, esspecially in this generation, where people are biblically illiterate because they like to listen to some tv preacher instead of listening to God.<br>  <br>  As far as your ridiculous comment goes, whether you whine and complain for the entirety of your life my friend, the fact of the matter is that your soul belongs to him who created it, and he can do with it as he will.<br>  I can spend my life yelling and screaming at you because you stepped on an ant, but<br>  whether I want to judge you as a murderer or not, you still have the ability and the right to step on that ant -esspecially in your own back yard.<br>  I do not judge God right or wrong; I say that God created all that is, and he can take it away as well - it all belongs to him including Job, the cattle, the wife, the children, everything - oh, and YOU.  I do thank God, however, and also Job for sending a teaching that is very valuable.  Instead of asking people to sit and whine over the story, why not read it with alittle understanding: perhaps you might learn something.|`|PM7DKfb9aa	They may not have been all that innocent if you read Job again. But either way, God did not kill them, Satan did. Why would anyone, thousands of years later, want to shift the blame to God and still have anything to do with the one who did the killing?|`|AA11272456	It is understandable that many are confused about the events recorded in Job.  Even more find it difficult to reconcile what God permitted with the teaching that he is a beneficent being.  <br>  <br>  This was no game between God and Satan.  And this was no bet.  Serious, life and death issues were raised by Satan in the Garden of Eden and later on, still more charges were leveled in connection with Job.  And they affect us all.  Consider please:  in the Garden, Satan blatantly called God a liar and insisted that God was withholding something from Adam and Eve to which they had a right.  All the angelic forces in heaven were listening and watching.  Satan did not challenge God's power because Satan is not stupid.  He challenged the rightfulness and righteousness of God's rule.  He in effect said that humans did not need God and could do very well by themselves.  Satan knows God better than most humans.  He knew that it would take time to answer these charges and he knew that God is not trigger-happy, as the saying goes.<br>  <br>  Further along, Satan challenged that Job only worshiped God for what he could get out of it and that God was no more than paid protection.  "You give him everything", Satan charges, "and you deliver him from everything.  That's the only reason he worships you.  But I can turn him and any other human away from you.  He's got a price.  They’ve all got a price.  Let me prove it."<br>  <br>  Why would God allow this challenge to go on?  For the same reason God did not put Satan to death in the garden, though Satan slandered him viciously. <br>  <br>  What do we think if a person who is challenged kills off the challenger?  What do we think if an accused crime lord puts out a hit on each jury member chosen for his trial?  What do we think if someone right here on Yahoo poses a challenge and then blocks certain people from being allowed to respond to his challenge?  We think that person is a coward; we think that person has something to hide, isn't that right?<br>  <br>  It is no different with God.  If Almighty God, whose power is limitless, just goes around killing every challenger that comes his way, not only is the challenge never satisfied, but more questions arise.<br>  <br>  In his perfect wisdom, God is allowing the challenge to be answered.  Once and for all, every intelligent creature in this universe – angelic and human – will be able to see that God’s way of ruling is the best way, the superior way, the way that benefits us all.  Once and for all, every intelligent creature in this universe – angelic and human – will be able to see that God is not withholding anything of benefit from us.  Once and for all, every intelligent creature in this universe – angelic and human – will be able to see that we cannot govern our lives successfully independent of God.  And because God is allowing the necessary time for these issues to be settled, a precedent is being set.  If the question should ever come up again, there will be no need to let it play out.  The precedent is on the books.  And we will say, “remember when . . .  yeah, remember how that turned out.  What a mess.  World Wars I and II, famine, terrorism, religions out of control, child abuse, elderly abuse.  Nope, I’ll stick with God’s way, thank you very much.”<br>  <br>  Satan used Job in an effort to support his challenge and he failed miserably.  Job did not have a price.  Do we?  Job was on the right side of the issue.  Are we?<br>  <br>  When God decides that it is time to destroy the wicked and deliver the righteous – on what side will we find ourselves?  Rather than condemn God for his way of dealing with things, we ought to be using the time to show where we stand.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, all of Job’s ten children will be resurrected.  So will Job.  So will his wife.  So will the additional ten children he had.  Will we be there to see?<br>  <br>  Hannah J Paul|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Job is a story ... a drama ... not a real life series of events.<br>  <br>  It's about God allowing evil to wear itself out trying to destroy a man, resulting only in the ultimate destruction of evil itself, as God restored all that the man had lost.<br>  <br>  It is the story of our redemption in Christ.

jiBtxcjGaa	There is no devil that caused your license to be taken away. It's time to take responsiblity for your own actions. God isn't going to save you, you have to pull yourself up by the bootstraps and get it together.  To believe in the "devil" is to blame someone else for  your own problems. To think God is going to have a talk with the judge and get your license back is just silly, as well. Take responsibility for your own life and live according to your highest and best interests. Get a bike or a scooter until you get your license back and be thankful it's spring time and not the dead of winter. Call your creditors and make arrangements to make smaller monthly payments, MAKE those payments and get your life back on track.

Wicca itself is a 'hard polytheistic' religion, meaning that Wicca see their deities as specific individual beings. The gods of Wicca are known as the Horned God and Great Mother, these are outer court references meant to be used as place holders for the real names of their gods until the Seeker is initiated and taught those names as these names are oath-bound so only taught to people once initiated. <br>  <br>  Wicca is hard-polytheistic meaning that their gods are specific identities, Wicca is not a monist religion so their gods are not all part of one god or vice versa – many Neo-wicca are monist, but not Wicca.<br>  <br>  [Monist = belief that all gods are aspects of one god]|`|AA11969451	I am going to post a few links for you.  <br>  Meaning of the word Pagan and Paganism<br>  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/paganism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/pagani...</a><br>  Traditional Wicca <a href="http://www.newwiccanchurch.net/articles/btwfaq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newwiccanchurch.net/articles/...</a><br>  Neo Wicca  <a href="http://www.witches-tutorial.com/paths/neowicca.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.witches-tutorial.com/paths/ne...</a><br>  Traditional Witchcraft <a href="http://www.shadowdrake.com/HSDwitchFAQ.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shadowdrake.com/HSDwitchFAQ.h...</a><br>  <br>  These links will lead you to many others that will help you.<br>  Blessings on your path.   )O(|`|68c39e039dd03752db0596c950f8a7efaa	You can worship any god/goddess you wish; mostly it depends on your coven, if you are a member of one.|`|73eb164e5255c75589393f17fcc7a54baa	Hello,<br>  <br>  So which goddess's and gods do you worship? The goddess' and gods are many in wicca.  so chances are you are worshipping them.  There is dulism in Wicca many things overlap.  <br>  <br>  Pagan is an umbrella term to describe beliefs that aren't christian, hindu, sikkh, muslim etc.  It is used to describe a system of beliefs that are very much nature related.  The worship of the seasons, nature, mother earth etc. <br>  <br>  Wiccan is a set of beliefs and a way of life.  Being wiccan is rituals, spells and worship of the goddess's and gods.  Adhering to "And it harm none do what thou will".  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you and I hope you don't get more confused.  You ask different pagans/wiccans you will or might get different answers.<br>  <br>  And for the record I don't think it matters what you call yourself.  What matters is your personal connection to whatever goddess's or gods you are worshipping. <br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  Bright blessings.<br>  <br>  Nimue|`|AA11956449	the Horned god <br>  Cernunnos is an ancient Celtic God. and is the most likely inspiration fo rthe Wiccan Horned god. the tripple Goddess of the Wiccans could be seen in many of the triune gods/goddesses fo the Celts.  <br>  <br>  most Pagans will have a pantheon that they follow. a set of gods that cover every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  Wicca is a defined religion with it's own rituals and Gods and goddesses. <br>  <br>  if you use these rituals and follow these gods then you are most likely in the Wiccan bracket of Paganism. <br>  <br>  anything out of the box of Wicca so to speak puts you into the solitary practicioner bracket. i think that this is where you are. you have your own beliefs and your own moral code and you ahve found a religion that suits them.<br>  <br>  solitary practicioners of Paganism may well end up useing gods from various faiths. and find it easy to accept other beliefs. <br>  i started a solitary Celtic pagan meaning that i follow the Celtic gods and gossesses but do not have a tribe or ao grove that i practice with or learn from. that was years ago. now i ahve ended up the priest of a grove. as friends and family came together and asked me for teachings a grove was formed. <br>  so now i am a Celtic Pagan. <br>  <br>  i think that Wicca does allow the use of alternate gods and goddesses. but most of them are much older than Wicca. <br>  <br>  hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Yogi|`|b0404ca8834c0976bd6577755ac27b00aa	It depends on the particular "tradition" you're following.  Some trads have a specific manifestation of the Lord and Lady they follow.  Others use all sorts of different names & faces.<br>  <br>  You could certainly say that every God & Goddess is a Wiccan god, because they can all be seen as different "aspects" of the gods, or different peoples' interpretations of them.

2myPey21aa	Te lo digo de esta forma:<br>  <br>  - Los antiguos griegos sabían que la tierra era esférica y sabían sus propiedades cientos de a?os antes de que Jesús naciera.<br>  - Los pueblos indígenas sabían muchísimas cosas, entre ellas, sabían predecir las catástrofes naturales.<br>  <br>  Luego vinieron los Romanos y su catolicismo. Mataron al propio Jesucristo y luego siguieron matando para imponer su "religión" usando, para colmo, su propio nombre para ello.<br>  <br>  - La tierra paso a ser plana, las ciencias, que en la antigua grecia florecian, pasaron a estancarse por siglos. Aparecieron los Imperios y los feudos, pocos tenian el poder y la brutalidad se adue?o del mundo, gracias a los Romanos y su estandarte: El Catolicismo.<br>  <br>  - Desvastaron pueblos, arrasaron con culturas, mataron científicos o los postergaron. Dominaron a mucha gente por muchos a?os, robaron riquezas de muchos pueblos, siempre bajo la excusa de Dios. El Rey era el mas próximo a Dios y se le debia rendir tributo. Su voluntad era lo importante.<br>  <br>  Hoy por hoy sigue existiendo gente que habla de Jesús y se dice catolica apostólica ROMANA... Esto mismo instauró el catolicismo, la gente no piensa, solo cree. La palabra de Jesucristo, que se supone, debería ser tomada como un mensaje de amor y respeto al projimo se transforma en un amor y respeto a uno mismo, al salvarse a uno mismo... "no importa si los demas van al infierno: yo tengo que salvarme". Lamentablemente los Romanos han instalado en el mundo, quizá para muchos muchos a?os, un germen de violencia, intolerancia, racismo y vaciamiento llamado Religion Católica.|`|6a654e9d3604ef05d07c208b7fd41bc7aa	Te imaginas un mundo lleno de testigos de Jehová??<br>  <br>  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA10492394	estariamos mucho mejor, porque la gente no viviria enga?ada y manipulada por mentiras, ya lo dijo kafka, esa religion los hace debiles porque esta basada en la misericordia y el perdon|`|ab27f394932e32ef0a29584f51ddd2caaa	supongo que alguna otra religion hbiera ocupado ese lugar|`|w1d997uEaa	Quizas estariamos quinientos a?os mas adelantados, sino fuera por que la iglesia mato a nuestra gente, nos hizo gastar mucho pero mucho dinero por la cuestion de la fe, y nos hace dedicar tiempo en solo una creencia, osea por ejemplo: en ves de que las horas de razonamiento logico en colegios se diera, o fuera mas largo, para el aprobechamiento de los alumnos, se ense?a RELIGION, que ni siquiera es una ciencia, por que nada de lo que dicen acerca de dios es demostrado; osea es una perdida de tiempo, y por eso estamos asi...|`|1lvCA9zGaa	Si estaria mejor el mundo si NO hubuise existido el catolisismo porque la humanidad se retraso 500 a?os  porque el que no creia en la biblia lo quemaban vivo.|`|3d4500ccf7df881681fcd05f4f28d1e0aa	Hubiese cambiado todo para bien si no hubiesen existido.

Fue por 1500 a?os la única y primera iglesia cristiana, después se le derivaron otras.  <br>  <br>  Tampoco tendríamos ni idea del concepto "misericordia": el catolicismo fue la primera religión que afirmó que los pobres tenían dignidad en sí mismos y que "de ellos será el Reino de los Cielos". Para las otras confesiones, como el judaismo, la pobreza era una prueba de que no contabas con el favor de Dios, también para el hinduísmo con el problema de las castas. El catolicismo sentó incluso las bases del pacificismo gracias a la frase de Jesús: "quien a espada mata, a espada muere" y "bienaventurados los pacíficos", así como de la ecología (hoy no existiría greenpeace) y de la sociedad igualitaria (hoy no existiría el socialismo).<br>  <br>  Así mismo, si no hubiera existido hoy no habría cultura en el mundo pues con la caída del Imperio Romano y la quema de la Biblioteca de Alejandría, la cultura se esfumó del Viejo Continente. La Iglesia católica fue la única institución que se preocupó de guardar y proteger los libros de Arquitectura, Matemáticas, Literatura, Filosofía, Geometría, Física y Medicina de la Edad Antigua. Gracias a estas obras sabemos que existió la democracia y hoy la aplicamos. La Iglesia Católica creó las primeras universidades de Europa: Oxford, La Sorbonne, Salamanca, La Sapienza, etc..

AA11923447	There are services for every day of Holy Week, but the main observances are Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday.<br>  <br>  Palm Sunday: Christ's entry into Jerusalem. It's also called Passion Sunday, and there are readings of the Passion Gospel. Worshipers often carry palm leaves or wear Palm crosses.<br>  <br>  Maundy Thursday: Commemorates the institution of the Holy Eucharist. A celebration of the Last Supper.<br>  <br>  Good Friday: The Passion of Christ. The Crucifixion.<br>  <br>  Easter Vigil: The night before Easter. Often, baptisms are performed, and converts received into the Church.<br>  <br>  Easter Sunday: The Resurrection. <br>  <br>  There are services on every single day of Holy Week, and there are also Tenebrae services during that time. Tenebrae is Latin for "darkness". It's a very somber service.|`|PZKmZ95Yaa	Palm Sunday comes first in order. The central feature of the service proper to this day, as it was in the time of ?theria, is the procession of palms.<br>  <br>  The only other noteworthy feature of the present Palm Sunday service is the reading of the Gospel of the Passion.<br>  <br>   Maundy Thursday:<br>  The day commemorates the Last Supper of Christ and his 12 Apostles and the institution of the Eucharist. <br>  On Maundy Thursday, the celebrant often celebrates the rite of the washing of the feet.<br>  During the day, bishops celebrate the Chrism Mass, where they bless the oils for Confirmation, the Anointing of the Sick and the Catechumens. <br>  The hosts not distributed in Communion on Maundy Thursday are reserved and distributed on Good Friday, when no Mass is celebrated. <br>  After the Mass, the Blessed Sacrament is carried in procession to an "altar of repose". Then all altars except that one are stripped. <br>  <br>  Good Friday:<br>  There is no Mass; the Eucharist is not consecrated. Communion takes place with the hosts left over from Holy Thursday. <br>  The church remains stripped on this day of ornate objects, including the altar cloth and candles, as a sign of respect. <br>  Holy water fonts are emptied. <br>  On this day, the stations of the Cross are often prayed either in the church or outside. <br>  Celebration of the liturgy of the Lord’s Passion occurs in the afternoon. <br>  The liturgy consists of three parts in the Roman Rite: <br>  the Liturgy of the Word, <br>  the Veneration of the Cross, <br>  and Holy Communion.<br>  <br>  <br>  Holy Saturday:<br>  A day of silence and prayer which commemorates the dead Christ in the tomb. No Mass is celebrated.<br>  The Tabernacle is left empty and open. The lamp or candle usually situated next to the Tabernacle denoting the Presence of Christ is put out, and the Eucharist is kept elsewhere, usually the sacristy, with a lamp or candle burning before it. <br>  <br>  Easter Vigil<br>  Takes place during the night, either on the eve of Easter or early in the morning on Easter Sunday. <br>  The Gospel reminds us to have our lamps ready, to be like men waiting for the Lord’s return so that when He arrives He will find us wide awake and will seat us at His table. <br>  Night vigil is arranged in four parts: <br>  A brief service of light; <br>  Liturgy of the word; <br>  Liturgy of baptism; <br>  Liturgy of the Eucharist. <br>  <br>  Easter Sunday|`|3373258e95b708c342a0086070c54586aa	There's no such thing<br>  <br>  COL 2:14-22|`|5dZdLDwHaa	Palm Sunday begins Holy Week, and the Palm Sunday liturgy commemorates the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, and the beginning of the events that lead to his crucifixion. Holy Thursday is the commemoration of the Last Supper, the night in which Christ instituted the priesthood and the Eucharist (I'm Catholic, so that's what we celebrate, don't know about other Christians) It is also the night Jesus was arrested and convicted by the Sanhedrin. The Eucharist is removed from the church after the mass, and no masses are celebrated until Saturday evening. Good Friday marks the day of Christ's passion and death. Holy Saturday evening is the first Easter Mass, called the Easter Vigil. It is also the night of Initiation, where those who are converting to Catholicism are baptized (if non-Christians) and are given the Sacraments of Initiation (Communion and Confirmation). Easter Sunday is the Resurrection. As I said before, I'm Catholic, so I can only give you the significance of each day from the perspective of my tradition. It may vary , depending upon denomination. Hope this helps!

(Christian Era); died 633 C.E.<br>  <br>  The following is based on books, manuscripts, texts and actual eyewitness accounts, too numerous to mention herein, preserved in original form throughout the centuries by both Muslims and non-Muslims.<br>  <br>  Many people today are discussing Prophet Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention. Who was he exactly? What did he teach? Why was he loved so much by some and hated so much by others? Did he live up to his claims? Was he a holy man? Was he a prophet of God? What is the truth about this man?You be the judge.<br>  Here are the facts as narrated by thousands of people, many of whom knew him personally.<br>  *He was born to a noble tribe to the lineage of the leaders of Makkah.<br>  *His name comes from the Arabic root "hamd" and literally means "praised one." People at his time and until this very moment, praise him many times per day, may Allah exalt his mention.<br>  *He never fell into the common practice of his tribesmen to worship statues, idols or man-made "gods."<br>  *He believed that God was truly One God, and as such, He was to be worshipped alone, without any other "gods" beside Him.<br>  *He held the Name of God in the highest of reverence and never took God's Name in vain or for any vain glorious purpose.<br>  *He despised false worship and all of the complexities and degradation to which it leads.<br>  *He adhered to the Commandments of Almighty God, just as prophets of old had done in the past.<br>  *He never committed adultery, and he forbade others from doing it.<br>  *He forbade usury and interest on money lending, as Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, had done centuries before him.<br>  *He never gambled and did not allow it.<br>  *He never drank alcohol or strong drink; even though it was a very normal thing for people of his time and place.<br>  *He did not engage in gossip and used to turn away from hearing anything related to it.<br>  *He fasted for days at a time to be closer to Almighty God and away from the narrowness of worldly attractions.<br>  *He taught that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, was the immaculate conception and miracle birth of Mary, and that she was among the best creation of Almighty God.<br>  *He insisted even to the Jews of Medina, that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, was the Messiah, the Christ, the one predicted to come in their Torah (Old Testament).<br>  *He said Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, did many miracles by the permission of Almighty God, curing the lepers, restoring sight to the blind and even bringing a dead man back to life.<br>  *He stated clearly that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, was not dead, rather Almighty God had raised him up.<br>  *He foretold that Jesus, may Allah exalt his mention, is going to return again in the Last Days to lead the true believers in a victory over the evil and unrighteous people, and he will destroy the Anti-Christ.<br>  *He commanded the payment of charity to the poor and he was the defender and protector of widows, orphans and the wayfarers.<br>  *He ordered people to unite with their families and honor the ties of kinship and he restored relationships between family members.<br>  *He required his followers to engage only in lawful marriage relationships with women, and forbade sex outside of Almighty God's Ordinance.<br>  *He insisted on giving women their proper rights, dowries, inheritance and property.<br>  *His patience and humble attitude were exemplary and all who knew him had to admit to these virtues.<br>  A. He never lied, never broke a trust never bore false witness, and he was famous with all the tribes in Makkah and was known as: "The Truthful" (Al-Ameen).<br>  B. He never once engaged in sex outside of marriage, nor did he ever approve of it, even though it was very common at the time.<br>  C. His only relationships with women were in legitimate, contractual marriages with proper witnesses according to law.<br>  D. His relationship to Ayesha was only that of marriage. Their relationship is described in every detail by Ayesha herself in the most loving and respectful manner as a match truly made in heaven. Ayesha is considered as one of the highest scholars of Islam and lived out her entire life only having been married to Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention. She never desired any other man, nor did she ever utter a single negative statement against Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention.<br>  E. He forbade any killing until the orders came from Allah. Even then the limits were clearly spelled out and only those engaged in active combat against the Muslims or Islam were to be fought in combat. And even then, only according to very strict rules from Allah.<br>  F. Killing any innocent life was forbidden.<br>  G. There was no genocide of Jews. He offered mutual protection and forgiveness to the Jews even after they broke their covenants with him many times. They were not attacked until it was clearly proven they were traitors during time of war and tried to bring down the prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, and the Muslims at any cost. Retaliation was only to those Jews who had turned traitor and not others.<br>  H. Slaves were common in those days for all nations and tribes. It was Islam that encouraged freeing of the slaves and the great reward from Allah for those who did so. Prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, gave the example of this by freeing slaves and encouraging all of his followers to do the same. Examples include his own servant (who was actually considered like a son to him) Zaid ibn Al Haritha and Bilal the slave who was bought by Abu Bakr only for the purpose of freeing him.<br>  I. While there were many attempts of assassination made on Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, (most famous was the night that Ali took his place in bed while he and Abu Bakr escaped to Madinah), he did not allow his companions to slaughter any of those who had been involved in these attempts. Proof for this is when they entered Makkah triumphantly and his first words were to command his followers not to harm such and such tribes and so and so families. This was one of the most famous of his acts of forgiveness and humbleness.<br>  J. Military combat was forbidden for the first thirteen years of prophethood. The desert Arabs did not need anyone to tell them how to fight or do combat. They were experts in this area and held feuds amongst tribes that lasted for decades. It was not until the proper method of warfare was instituted by Allah in the Quran, with proper rights and limitations according His Commandments, that any retaliation or combat was sanctioned. Orders from Allah made it clear who was to be attacked, how and when and to what extent fighting could take place.<br>  K. Destruction of infrastructures is absolutely forbidden except when it is ordained by Allah in certain instances and then only according to His Commands.<br>  L. Cursing and invoking evil actually came to the prophet, may Allah exalt his mention, from his enemies, while he would be praying for their guidance. Classic example is that of his journey to At-Taif where the leaders would not even hear him out nor offer so much as the normal courtesy called for and instead they set the children of the street against him, throwing rocks and stones at him until his body was bleeding so much, blood filled his sandals. He was offered revenge by the angel Gabriel, if he would give the command, Allah would cause the surrounding mountains to fall down upon them destroying them all. Instead of cursing them or asking for their destruction, he prayed for them to be guided to worship their Lord alone, without any partners.<br>  M. Prophet Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, claimed every person who is born is born in a state of ISLAM (submission to God), as a Muslim (MU-Islam means; "one who does ISLAM" i.e.; submits to God's Will and obeys His Commandments). Then as they grow older they begin to distort their faith according to the influence of the prevailing society and their own prejudices.<br>  N. Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, taught his followers to believe in the God of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David, Solomon and Jesus, peace be upon them all, and to believe in them as true prophets, messengers and slaves of Almighty Allah. He insisted on ranking all the prophets up at the highest level without any distinction between them.<br>  O. He also taught the Torah (Old Testament), Zaboor (Psalms) and Injeel (Gospel or New Testament) were originally from the very same source as the Quran, from Allah.<br>  P. He prophesied and foretold of events to come and they happened as he had said. He even predicted something from the past that would come true in the future, and it has.<br>  The Quran states pharaoh was drowned in the Red Sea while chasing after Moses and Allah said He would preserve Pharaoh as a sign for the future. Dr. Maurice Bucaille in his book, "Bible, Quran and Science" makes it clear this has happened and the very person of Pharaoh has been discovered in Egypt and is now on display for all to see.<br>  This event took place thousands of years before Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, and it came true in the last few decades, many centuries after his death.<br>  There has been more written about the prophet Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, than any other person on earth. He has been praised very high even by famous non-Muslims for centuries. One of the first examples we quote from is from the Encyclopedia Britannica, as it confirms (regarding Muhammad)”<br>  ". . . a mass of detail in the early sources shows that he was an honest and upright man who had gained the respect and loyalty of others who were likewise honest and upright men." (Vol. 12)<br>  Another impressive tribute to Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention is in the very well written work of Michael H. Hart, "The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History." He states that the most influential person in all history was Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, with Jesus second. Examine his actual words:<br>  <br>  "My choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world's most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular level."<br>  Michael H. Hart, THE 100: A RANKING OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PERSONS IN HISTORY, New York: Hart Publishing Company, Inc., 1978, page. 33.<br>  While we are reviewing statements from famous non-Muslims about Prophet Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, consider this:<br>  "Philosopher, orator, apostle, legislator, warrior, conqueror of ideas, restorer of rational dogmas, of a cult without images; the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire, that is Muhammad. As regards all standards by which human greatness may be measured, we may well ask, is there any man greater than he?"<br>  Lamartine, HISTOIRE DE LA TURQUIE, Paris, 1854, Vol. II, pp. 276-277.<br>  George Bernard Shaw, a famous writer and non-Muslim says:<br>  "He must be called the Savior of Humanity. I believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it much needed peace and happiness."<br>  (The Genuine Islam, Singapore, Vol. 1, No. 8, 1936)<br>  K.S. Ramakrishna Rao, an Indian (Hindu) professor of Philosophy, in his booklet "Muhammad the Prophet of Islam" calls him the "perfect model for human life." Professor Ramakrishna Rao explains his point by saying:<br>  "The personality of Muhammad, it is most difficult to get into the whole truth of it. Only a glimpse of it I can catch. What a dramatic succession of picturesque scenes. There is Muhammad the Prophet. There is Muhammad the Warrior; Muhammad the Businessman; Muhammad the Statesman; Muhammad the Orator; Muhammad the Reformer; Muhammad the Refuge of Orphans; Muhammad the Protector of Slaves; Muhammad the Emancipator of Women; Muhammad the Judge; Muhammad the Saint. All in all these magnificent roles, in all these departments of human activities, he is alike a hero."<br>  Mahatma Gandhi, speaking on the character of Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, says in 'YOUNG INDIA':<br>  "I wanted to know the best of one who holds today undisputed sway over the hearts of millions of mankind... I became more than convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the scrupulous regard for his pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and in his own mission. These and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle. When I closed the 2nd volume (of the Prophet's biography), I was sorry there was not more for me to read of the great life."<br>  Thomas Carlyle in his 'Heroes and Hero Worship', was simply amazed as to:<br>  "How one man single handedly, could weld warring tribes and wandering Bedouins into a most powerful and civilized nation in less than two decades."<br>  Diwan Chand Sharma wrote in "The Prophets of the East":<br>  "Muhammad was the soul of kindness, and his influence was felt and never forgotten by those around him"<br>  (D.C. Sharma, The Prophets of the East, Calcutta, 1935, pp. 12)<br>  Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, was nothing more or less than a human being, but he was a man with a noble mission, which was to unite humanity on the worship of ONE and ONLY ONE GOD and to teach them the way to honest and upright living based on the commands of God. He always described himself as, 'A Slave and Messenger of God' and so indeed every action of his proclaimed to be.<br>  Speaking on the aspect of equality before God in Islam, the famous poetess of India, Sarojini Naidu says:<br>  "It was the first religion that preached and practiced democracy; for, in the mosque, when the call for prayer is sounded and worshippers are gathered together, the democracy of Islam is embodied five times a day when the peasant and king kneel side by side and proclaim: 'God Alone is Great'... I have been struck over and over again by this indivisible unity of Islam that makes man instinctively a brother."<br>  (S. Naidu, Ideals of Islam, vide Speeches & Writings, Madras, 1918, p. 169)<br>  In the words of Professor Hurgronje:<br>  "The league of nations founded by the prophet of Islam put the principle of international unity and human brotherhood on such universal foundations as to show candle to other nations." He continues, "the fact is that no nation of the world can show a parallel to what Islam has done towards the realization of the idea of the League of Nations."<br>  Edward Gibbon and Simon Ockley, on the profession of ISLAM, writes in "History of the Saracen Empires":<br>  "I BELIEVE IN ONE GOD, AND MAHOMET, AN APOSTLE OF GOD' is the simple and invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honor of the Prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtues; and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion."<br>  (History of the Saracen Empires, London, 1870, p. 54) <br>  Wolfgang Goethe, perhaps the greatest European poet ever, wrote about Prophet Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention. He said:<br>  "He is a prophet and not a poet and therefore his Koran is to be seen as Divine Law and not as a book of a human being, made for education or entertainment."<br>  (Noten und Abhandlungen zum Weststlichen Dvan, WA I, 7, 32)<br>  People do not hesitate to raise to divinity and even make 'gods' out of other individuals whose lives and missions have been lost in legend. Historically speaking, none of these legends achieved even a fraction of what Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, accomplished. And all his striving was for the sole purpose of uniting mankind for the worship of One God on the codes of moral excellence. Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, or his followers never at any time claimed that he was a son of God or the God-incarnate or a man with divinity – but he always was and is even today considered as only a Messenger chosen by God.<br>  Today after a lapse of fourteen centuries, the life and teachings of Muhammad, may Allah exalt his mention, have survived without the slightest loss, alteration or interpolation. They offer the same undying hope for treating mankind's many ills, which they did when he was alive. This is not a claim of Muhammad’s, may Allah exalt his mention, followers, but the inescapable conclusion forced upon by a critical and unbiased history.|`|AA11073422	Islamic prayers is mainly based on pagan prayers.

If so, they are the facts/truths that stem from the physicality that is this planet, universe, etc...that we know...and, of course, many theories change as new facts & discoveries are made...science has little problem in making amends toward truth & fact...that is it's purpose.<br>  <br>  However...there are also facts & truths of life after death...there are thousands upon thousands of life regressions done for this research & all accounts (and I can say "all" here), are similar when the birth/death experience is relived, and a previous lifetime is revisited...often this is done to heal a malady that was brought forth into this term...which has been extemely successful, by the way....thus, there is also truth that for this to consistantly occur, we are in fact, an undying entity, there is reincarnation, sooooo WHY? For what purpose would that serve?  This is where faith in your inner knowing comes in...soooo enters those who create "religion" to explain what they cannot see...most of which, are not based in their inner truths, but on human interpretations of stories & events of others...and since their dogma also created a great power source in governing masses, they are not so willing to waylay their doctrines when real truths are discovered & proven as facts & doesn't go along with what their traditions have been.<br>  <br>  See? Where science continues in the seeking of fact here in the physical, using many technologies,  many sources, & thrives on rocking the boat in the mean time...religion seeks little more than more congregational units based on one book as it's sole source of knowledge...truth is scarey to them...they oppose boat rocking with great vigor.<br>  <br>  However, again...this is not spirituality, which is the seeking of facts & truths of an unseen nature, because it is through experience & great research that they are found to be such. There ARE those who "see dead people", there are those that can travel outside of this physicality, there are those that were born with remembering their spirit realities...too many to just push aside and say "bah humbug" without a second thought....they have been through all of history, and are today.|`|316d15dc908c1aa8be6dba5a578fd009aa	May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and love of God, and fellowship of The Holy Spirit be you all. 2 Corinthains 13:14|`|AA11992515	I don't even understand your question|`|bc5311f71d3455e51faef165e82eb00faa	the truth is our religion. people don't understand us believers and why critize!!!!|`|cdf83551e7810e3b593cc10c945db705aa	Not all christians do this.

The fact is that there is no evidence whatsoever for the central tenets of religion (existence of a god, life after death, etc.). That does not mean that those things are necessarily false, but simply that there is no objective reason to believe in them. <br>  <br>  Now, the believer who accepts that there is no evidence but nonetheless chooses to believe has chosen to believe on the basis of pure faith. There is nothing whatsoever wrong with that, though of course I think that person has chosen to believe in something false. <br>  <br>  The big problem among Christians (and religious believers in general) is that so few have the faith to accept that there is no evidence for their beliefs, and so:<br>  <br>  - They insist that certain bad arguments or simply false descriptions of the world ARE evidence for their beliefs, and <br>  - They insist that it is "foolish" to not believe. <br>  <br>  In fact there is nothing at all foolish about not believing in gods or life after death. If there were such obvious evidence that it would be foolish to deny those things, then there would be no need at all for faith. Religious belief would not be a special thing, but instead would be no different from belief in stop signs or trees or clouds. <br>  <br>  When a believer argues that it is foolish to deny god's existence, that believer is really telling us that he or she has no faith whatsoever. Not only does that behavior insult those of us who have a perfectly reasonable naturalistic worldview, it also denigrates Christianity, by removing the role of faith. <br>  <br>  I think that the role of faith in Christianity is fading fast, largely because a religious belief that requires faith cannot be foisted on those of us who do not have faith*, and in the United States of today, faithless Christianity is too effective a political tool to be abandoned to a Christianity that still respects the role of faith. <br>  <br>  * Unless there's evidence for the Christian tenets, there's no reason why nonbelievers should pay attention to those tenets.|`|17d0a98a02160b549d77cafea4066b76aa	There's no proof (put truth down.

69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	There are various theories surrounding 13. Since Christianity has had a extremely large influence on all societies as a whole, we shall look there first. At the "Final Supper" or "Last Supper" (whoever you chose to term it) there were 13 guests. Some believe Jesus to be the 13th at feast, occurring just before he was Crucified. This is a largely debatable theory, however. How does one know where to start counting? Many chose to go by the painting "The Last Supper," forgetting that this is an artist's interpretation of an event he did not attend. The painting depicts the disciples and Jesus at a table, but evidence suggests that the last supper was not conducted at a table. Rather the participants were seated on the ground where it was cooler. (The climate in Israel, at that time, suggests they would have stayed on the ground to keep cool.) Furthermore, where to start counting (when assuming the picture is accurate)? If one started with Judas, Jesus became the 13th guest. Conversely, if the count began at Jesus, it was indeed Judas who was 13. Both options would contribute to the mystique surrounding 13: Jesus, for he was killed soon after the feast, Judas for he was the betrayer of Jesus.<br>  <br>  It's a SUPERSTITION!|`|20d4d06bf2319946e8576b06a60bfb36aa	No, silly!

That day thousands of Templars were arrested and subsequently tortured. They then 'confessed' and were executed. From that day on, Friday the 13th was considered by followers of the Templars as an evil and unlucky day.|`|8e24cf4870f7acf4b978a06e284a53a8aa	Some believe it could have come from symbolism found in the Tarot... 13 is the number for the Major Arcana Card " DEATH "|`|AA12187900	The Egyptians were the first to develop a superstition for the number thirteen, but for them the number brought good luck. They believed that there were twelve steps on the ladder to eternal life and knowledge and to take the thirteenth step meant going through death into everlasting life. Thirteen, for the Egyptians, was associated with immortality. <br>  It was in Roman times that the number thirteen became associated with ill omens, particularly those bringing death and destruction. <br>  For Christians, the number thirteen also brought bad luck. The superstition stems from the Last Supper where Judas Iscariot became the thirteenth guest to sit at the table and would later betray Jesus, leading to his crucifixion. Still to this day it is considered very bad luck for thirteen people to sit down for dinner together. It is believed that one of the dinner guests will die within the year. <br>  Norse mythology also has a superstition surrounding thirteen at a dinner table and the bad luck that ensues. In fact, it is believed that the Christian story of the Last Supper may find its origin in this particular myth. Apparently twelve deities sat down for a meal at a gods' feast only to have Loki, the god of mischief and disorder, come along and crash the party. He rose the number to thirteen, causing one of the gods to die during the meal.<br>  The number was adopted by witches for their covens, which always number thirteen. Still, to this day, the superstition lives on.<br>  Most hotel chains have no room number thirteen and many skyscrapers are without a thirteenth floor. <br>  The apostle Paul had accusations made against him due to his accusers superstitions; Acts 25:18-20<br>  The World Book Encyclopedia says: “Superstitions will probably have a part in life as long as people fear each other and have uncertainties about the future.” Fear and uncertainty may drive people to become superstitious.

A clever but rebellious student claims that the teacher’s way of solving the problem is wrong. Implying that the teacher is not capable, this rebel insists that he knows a much better way to solve the problem. Some students think that he is right, and they also become rebellious. What should the teacher do? If he throws the rebels out of the class, what will be the effect on the other students? Will they not believe that their fellow student and those who joined him are right? All the other students in the class might lose respect for the teacher, thinking that he is afraid of being proved wrong. But suppose that the teacher allows the rebel to show the class how he would solve the problem.<br>  <br>  Jehovah has done something similar to what the teacher does. Remember that the rebels in Eden were not the only ones involved. Millions of angels were watching. (Job 38:7; Daniel 7:10) How Jehovah handled the rebellion would greatly affect all those angels and eventually all intelligent creation. So, what has Jehovah done? He has allowed Satan to show how he would rule mankind. God has also allowed humans to govern themselves under Satan’s guidance.<br>  <br>  The teacher in our illustration knows that the rebel and the students on his side are wrong. But he also knows that allowing them the opportunity to try to prove their point will benefit the whole class. When the rebels fail, all honest students will see that the teacher is the only one qualified to lead the class. They will understand why the teacher thereafter removes any rebels from the class. Similarly, Jehovah knows that all honesthearted humans and angels will benefit from seeing that Satan and his fellow rebels have failed and that humans cannot govern themselves. Like Jeremiah of old, they will learn this vital truth: “I well know, O?Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”—Jeremiah 10:23.|`|AA11103731	Christians live by faith and are the fallen so they except life as punishment with the hope for redemption. <br>  <br>  Why stop with Christians, how about Muslims and Jews,  Buddhism or Jainism or indigenous sacred ways of tribal people. <br>  <br>  Maybe the greatest example of Gods power is to let us figure it out for ourselves.

Satan has influence.  Man has choice.  God does not allow Satan to influence us... we do.  There's a difference.  If God would have us choose Him by our own free will, would you have Him influence our will by somehow eliminating Satan?  Would that then be free will, or would that be God influencing our choice for Him.  God is righteous.  ALL His ways are equal.  That's difficult for us to comprehend because we find it difficult to NOT influence outcomes in our own lives.  God wants us to choose Him of our own free will.  He only influences our lives when we invite Him to through prayer... thus, we make the choice.  Satan does not have power over the earth... man does.  Satan can only influence our choices through deception.|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	God allows it because in Genesis He, GOD,  gave all authority over to man, meaning humans.<br>  <br>  But when Adam and Eve sinned they gave their authority over to Satan.   GOD set up the laws and He won't violate them for any reason, He put His word higher than even His own name.     That's why Jesus came to die and take the authority back by paying a remission for sins,  Jesus gave authority back to Christians, but some of them don't walk in it.    GOD is all powerful but since Adam gave that authority to satan GOD won't go against the law set in place.   Get it?    <br>  Like the law of gravity if you jump off a building you will fall, GOD won't interfere in the law of gravity,  He may save you from injury and death but you will fall.

Why the question, here?|`|FewgBc8Uaa	The buttons use to be of equal size an on button and an off button, on the old non-digital type, which did mean that swicthing the alarm off was the only way to make it stop. Humans use alarm clocks to wake them up before they normally would wake naturally, when you do this to the human body it sometimes fights back, when the body fights back and switches off the alarm the alarm is useless. The snooze button goes between these systems by creating a persistent alarm system that continually wakes the person till their body gives up the fight. The effectiveness of the system is in the size of the snooze button compared to the off button and its positioning on the alarm. A person needs to be quite concious to locate the off switch, when semi concious they are largely more likey to hit the snooze instead hence making the alarm more effective....<br>  <br>  So why is the snooze button bigger? because we humans are experts at pushing ourselves around.

NZO7ZEyoaa	The confederate flag is part of our national heritage, and whether you like what it stands for or not, it is still a part of our heritage.<br>  The Nazi flag is part of German heritage, and they have become so ashamed of what they did, they killed off millions of people, just because they could that they do not like it to be flown.<br>  The confederate flag symbolizes more than just a government that allowed slavery.<br>  The Civil war was about many things that at the time were much more important than slavery. The North didn't really care about the injustice of slavery. They were concerned far more with the fact that the South had become obscenely wealthy off of their exports, chiefly cotton and tobacco, while the North as struggling to create an economy based on manufactured goods. The slaves were how the Southern people were able to make their profits, so since slavery was slowly becoming unacceptable in civilized countriesthey chose that issue to bicker about publicly.<br>  If you'll notice Abraham Lincoln set free only slaves in the South in the Gettysburg address, not the slaves in the North, and there were slaves in the North at the time of the Gettysburg address, their freedom didn't come until after teh Civil War was over.<br>  Politically speaking the Civil War was really about State rights versus Federal rights. Our founding fathers envisioned a country where, we would operaste much like the European Union does today. Different self governing states, that banded together in times of need, to defend themselves, but that ruled themselves. Before the Civil War people in this country thought of themselves as Texan or from New York or Kentucky. Because each State was its own entity that was seperate from all the rest. It wasn't until after the Civil War that people began to truly identify themselves as American. The Civil War created Big Government, because it took away the State's right to disagree with the Federal government.<br>  But their is a long history associated with the Civil War flag, much of it ignored, because we are told in school that the Civil War was about slavery. It wasn't read it for yourself.<br>  Also at the time the North was just as oppressive, if not more so, to its factory workers that came from all over the world and were paid pennies a day to slave away. Those conditions existed right up into the 20th century.<br>  Also the South was asserting its right to disagree with the federal government. The Germans were hell bent on orld domination and the creation of a master race. They were dedicated to war and genocide. The South while allowing slavery (most of the soldiers in the rebel forces were voluteers and did not own slaves), was not trying to exterminate anyone, nor were thay trying to conquer the world.|`|d59584b0fd0e76bcf0264883af5eb1b7aa	Flying the Confederate flag is rarely accepted.|`|2oqPKS8Maa	The Confederate flag is part of our Nations heritage and my heritage.

Just like it is your right to be  an ignorant bleeding heart that doesn't know anything about The Great Confederate flag.|`|ZlGGKoInaa	that's a good question.<br>  and to the first answer.<br>  you barely see any in north, but in the south and they're everywhere.

Baha'is, though still persecuted in Iran, are NOT a minority Islamic group any more that Islam is a minority Christian group.  The Baha'i Faith is an independent, world-wide religion (2nd most widespread in the world).<br>  <br>  2.  Baha'is do not reject  the Prophet Mohammed nor the Word of God revealed by Him.  Nor do we reject any of the major Prohpets in recorded history.  We do reject the word of man (clergy's interpretations of Their revelations) when it does not coincide with the Word of God and we pray for the progress of the souls who have corrupted Their teachings.<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question and for encouraging people to see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears.|`|befeb4eb825755aaa4243b260a426e9aaa	Why are you such a .....

A Sufi is a person who has come to a knowledge or trying to come to a knowledge of God & get closer to him in a special way. Of course I have seen very few of them nowadays but it has been very popular in the past.<br>  about the other minorities, no one is murdering no one, even those who hate these groups have no right to murder them. & I myself believe that you should count on who a person is more than the religion or minority they belong to.|`|da7d0bd4f8d451798b312b44f9706911aa	When we hate ourselves we do not want to look at ourselves so we project onto others,blame, and the cycle continues.

Anke io come te avevo fatto il linguistico (ingl-franc-spagn) e ora ho deciso di proseguire cn spagnolo e svedese , cmq nella mia uni ci sn un casino di lingue diverse da poter abbinare tra loro tra cui anke il cinese e l'arabo ( corsi seguitissimi) ...ps. nn ci sn test d'ammissione ! ti lascio il link dacci un'okkiata!  baci|`|9EHuhNZMaa	io ti consiglio di studiare le lingue orientali...magari saranno più difficili all'inizio ma ormai Cina,Giappone e paesi Arabi sono al centro del mondo..Tra l'altro c'è un'ottima università di lingue a Trieste così non dovresti andare troppo lontano..<br>  Rettifico l'università di Trieste è interpreti e traduttori|`|bdbeed9ebbcc9504bea733a6a932e5f8aa	Io sono madrelingua cinese, se vuoi ti posso dare una mano.|`|4NougGIOaa	anche io faccio quinta e una mia amica aveva il tuo stesso problema...ha scelto lettere orientali..dove cmq fai inglese..ma c'è arabo mandarino e cinese o giapponese..insomma ci sono tutte le lingue orientali più importanti, ma la cosa migliore è che cmq continui inglese..lei lo fa a torino..|`|6ZmxHualaa	Io studio lingue al liceo come te, ma abito vicino Roma.<br>  In questa zona sono molto buone per le lingue Roma Tre e La  Tuscia di Viterbo.

Io ho studiato lingue orientali lì, e ti assicuro che è molto buona (io ho fatto giapponese). Non è obbligatorio fare inglese, potresti anche fare ad esempio cinese e giapponese. Però, il mio consiglio è: comincia una sola lingua che ancora non conosci e concentrati su quella. Visto che ti interessa il cinese, ti dico che a Torino il dipartimento di cinese è molto molto buono (e molto duro).<br>  Tra cinese e arabo... Così su due piedi a livello di possibilità lavorative direi il cinese, ma non si sa mai cosa succederà in futuro. Dipende anche cosa vuoi fare, se vuoi lavorare in una ditta consiglierei il cinese, se invece vuoi magari lavorare nel sociale, allora l'arabo...<br>  In bocca al lupo!|`|QgXS7vQaaa	università Orientale di Napoli ( è la migliore )<br>  cinese sicuramente<br>  nn studio cinese e arabo|`|mAuFk7dmaa	Questa risposta portebbe non essere quella adatta a te, visto che non conosco bene la situazione universitaria in Italia.<br>  <br>  Qui in Inghilterra sia lo studio del Cinese sia lo studio dell'Arabo aprono sbocchi lavorativi notevoli. Quello che sta succedendo, però, è che lo studio della lingua cinese è inflazionato dalla grande quantità di studenti (qui lo studiano addirittura alle elementari!).<br>  <br>  Entrambi sono ottime scelte per il mondo del lavoro, ma per una pura questione di domanda ed offerta, sapere l'arabo ti piazzerà tra le poche persone che lo parlano. Per essere una risorsa "preziosa" sapendo il cinese, credo sia meglio specializzarti in uno dei dialetti oltre a studiare il mandarino - ottima scelta il cantonese.<br>  <br>  Per quanto riguarda la scelta dell'università: NON sceglierne una che non ti dà la possibilità di passare almeno un anno all'estero. Studiare lingue orientali non è come studiare francese o tedesco: si tratta di strutture grammaticali spesso così diverse che una full-immersion in un paese madrelingua, secondo me, è essenziale.<br>  <br>  In Europa l'università migliore è probabilmente la SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London) a Londra. Ma se vuoi andare in treno... forse non conviene :-)
O1evrDhbaa	Yes. According to the bible, God is in favor of abortion.<br>  <br>  One of the most common arguments against abortion comes from the Ten Commandments, where we are told "Thou Shalt Not Kill." But this begs the question of "kill what?" Does this commandment mean we cannot kill anything, even a fly? No. It means we should not kill another human being. Of course, the Fundamentalist believes a pre-born fetus is the same as a full-term human being. God, however, does not. In Exodus 21:22-25 we read that if a man accidentally kills a pregnant woman, that man should be condemned for committing murder. However, if he only kills the fetus - that is, if she miscarries - he is not condemned for murder. Clearly, then, God does not consider the pre-born fetus as being the same as a human being, in which case the Commandment of "Thou Shalt Not Kill (a human)" does not apply.|`|AA12197054	Its also funny how the religious right has no problem at all with abortions as long as the method consists of  dropping bombs out of the sky.|`|NYwpq6Ivaa	No<br>  in the Ten commandment one of them is do not Murder|`|rEsPnWz9aa	No. The Bible in Exodus 20:13 "You shall not murder."

No importa si ve a Buda en el reflejo de una cuchara, o si unas misteriosas manchas en la pared tienen la forma de Jesús o si Balmer se le aparece en sue?os, sudando como un cerdo y diciéndole que ama a su compa?ía, usted no haga caso.<br>  <br>  Cuidado: La Virgen se le podría aparecer y decirle que tiene una misión para usted. La Virgen se le suele aparecer a los creyentes, así que es de VITAL IMPORTANCIA que proclame su ateismo a los cuatro vientos. De no hacerlo, alguien en el Cielo puede cometer un descuido e indicarle a la Vírgen que es usted el adecuado para salvar el mundo, restablecer la fe en su país o erradicar la pobreza en el mundo. Recuerde: Si eso sucediera le dice cortés y amablemente que no habla con alucinaciones surgidas de su cerebro y vuelva al paquete de calmantes (y se lo acaba de un trago). Además, es usted una persona muy ocupada y no puede perder su tiempo en cumplir designios divinos.<br>  <br>  Recuerde que los ateos no tenemos dioses. Es un punto importante para entrar en nuestro gremio, así que si se le ha aparecido alguna divinidad háblelo con el Departamento de Destrucción de Pruebas De Que Existe Dios y entre todos buscaremos una solución razonable y pacífica (pacífica para nosotros, al menos)<br>  <br>  Por último, recuerde: Nosotros no bailamos desnudos alrededor de las hogueras a media noche, no raptamos bebés ni clavamos agujas a mu?ecos.

dkaKKXS2aa	Salut,?<br>  <br>  Ce que tu as mis est très intéressant. Et je peux t'assurer que ce problème est tout sauf anodin ?et superficiel, à mon avis.?<br>  En effet, cela recouvre plusieurs thématiques différents, déjà relevés par d'autres répondants, ?mais que je me permets de récapituler :?<br>  <br>  ?1) Totalitarisme :<br>  <br>  La petite fille étein impose sa manière de vivre à sa mère. <br>  Il s'agit d'une forme de violence au sens propre du terme. La violence n'est pas l'agressivité ??(uniquement), la violence est d'amener autrui à penser comme toi par tous les moyens y ?compris par ....la douceur et la gentillesse. Je dirais même que ceci constitue la violence ?suprême. Le livre le plus intéressant écrit sur ce sujet est celui de "1984" : En effet, à la fin du ?livre, le héros malheureux de l'histoire arrive à aimer profondément et sincèrement le "Grand ?Frère". ?<br>  Georges Orwell a eu le tort de comprendre avant tout le monde cela??<br>  <br>  L'exemple très judicieux que tu viens de nous révéler est exactement cela : violence ?psychologique, encore plus perverse ( et plus efficace...) que celle physique.?<br>  Le propre du totalitarisme est d'imposer aux autres leur bonheur MALGRE eux. A lire absolument "Nous autres" : un roman de science-fiction, écrit en 1920 par Ievgueni Zamiatine (URSS).<br>  <br>  2) Embrigadement des enfants :<br>  Le fait que ce soit un enfant qui impose à sa mère et non pas l'inverse est hautement significatif :<br>  Il montre la supériorité de l'idéologie sur la relation interparentale et amène à un affaiblissement du lien familial. ceci est le propre des sectes et des régimes totalitaires : en effet les régimes staliniens tels que les khemers rouges ont commencé par détruire les liens familiaux préalable à tout lavage de cerveaux. Le jeune mouchard qui fini par dénoncer ses propres parents pour manque d'orthodoxie est le symbole même des régimes fascites et totalitaires. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?3) La violation des espaces :?<br>  <br>  Le mot espace pris ici au sens propre comme au sens figuré. Comme l'un des répondants l'a si ?bien fait remarquer, la petite fille fait sa prière dans le salon et pas dans sa chambre. Etrange ?non??<br>  Déjà Jésus reprochait ceci sévèrement aux juifs qui faisaient leurs prières dans la rue. ?Pourquoi cette tendance à montrer sa piété? Dans quel but? ?<br>  Ceci a deux buts : tirer une certaine gloire de sa piété par rapport à l'autre, le mécréant. Mais ?pourquoi faire? Si ma foi et ma piété me sauve, cela me suffit. Pourquoi le montrer aux ?autres? En fait ce ci répond à l'un des rouages les plus compliqués de notre psychologie : ?l'existence et frustration...je n'existe qu'à travers les yeux des autres. Je ne peux pas boire de ?l'alcool, je ne peux pas avoir des rapports sexuels illicites, je ne peux pas faire plein d'autres ?choses que d'autres personnes peuvent très aisément se permettre en raison de ma croyance ou ?de mon mode de vie personnelle, alors je suis frustré...C'est terrible d'être frustré...alors pour ?combattre ce sentiment, je fais de ma croyance une arme, un emblème public de bonheur, je ?veux dire aux autres, "ne croyez pas que je suis frustré, je suis tellement heureux". Mais les ?autres ne voient pas que ne suis pas frustré, donc je dois leur montrer, car je n'existe que dans ?leurs yeux. Si j'existais par moi-même et si vraiment au fond de moi-même je croyais en mes ?valeurs, e n'étais pas obligé de les montrer en public aux autres. Mais étant donné qu'au fond ?de moi, je doute, qu'au fond de moi, je ne crois pas, alors je suis obligé d'avoir recours à ?l'appréciation et l'estime d'un tiers qui dira : ouah, elle est belle ta croyance"  et ainsi je me ?sentirais moins frustré, d'où la nécessité de montrer ma piété par divers moyens : le port de ?hijab, la prière dans les lieux publics, porter de grosses croix et de grosses étoiles David....et ?violer ainsi l'espace public par mon espace privé.?<br>  <br>  ?4) Le transfert du sacré :?<br>  <br>  Un cher internaute a répondu de la manière suivante : " nous avons le devoir de conseiller les ?femmes mal habillées, mais elles ont le droit de ne pas porter le voile". ?<br>  Notre cher internaute, n'a pas tort, car il fait appel à un commandement musulman qui ?demande à chaque musulman de conseiller à tout autre musulman de faire le bien et de le ?décourager de faire le mal ("amré bémaarouf et nahyé az monker").?<br>  <br>  Il est très louable de laisser à la femme non voilée son choix, mais en quoi, quelqu'un, peut se ?permettre de "conseiller" un autre majeur et qui de surcro?t ne se trouve pas sous sa tutelle ?légale (les parents uniquement pour des enfants de moins de 18 ans) de faire telle ou telle ?chose, à moins de considérer que cette dernière n'a pas la pleine capacité intellectuelle pour ?effectuer des choix judicieux. ?<br>  Il ne faut jamais oublier que le concept de "Velayaté Faghih", c'est-à-dire, l'idéologie sur ?laquelle est établie la quasi infaillibilité du statut de Guide suprême dans la République ?islamique d'Iran est une extension d'une autre idéologie musulmane établie au 19ème siècle, à ?partir duquel, le Cheik, ou Imam ( le clergé musulman) obtenait le plein droit d'effectuer des ?choix en place et lieu es individus qui étaient diminués temporairement (des orphelins)  ou ?définitivement (des handicapés mentaux).?<br>  L'extension d'une telle loi à l'ensemble de tout un pays (Iran actuel) n'est ni moins ni pus que ?de considérer que l'ensemble de la population (plus de 70 millions individus) est mentalement ?handicapée et une seule personne a l'infaisabilité et autorité suprêmes sur les individus et sur ?les institutions (le parlement, la présidence, le gouvernement,...).?<br>  Ceci a pour but de montrer, combien il est dangereux, de vouloir "guider" et "conseiller" des ?individus majeurs, tant que ces derniers ne vous ont pas demandés, ou qu'ils n'ont pas commis ?quelque chose qui puisse troubler l'ordre public.?<br>  Il s'agit également d'un problème d'ordre moral : orgueil, qui constitue l'un des 7 péchés ?capitaux et s?rement le plus dangereux.?<br>  <br>  Merci|`|1ZlaoVC8aa	Tu sais, il existe des choses bien pire en France, mais bon, c'et vrai qu'il vaut mieux aller faire un tour du coté des pays musulmans, au moins, ces horreurs nous touchent plus hein?pfff<br>  Si certains se mêlait de leurs fesses;

LVxkbTmOaa	Mira, no creo que es muy maduro y responsable afirmar que la naturaleza humana de por si es infiel, mucho menos razonable.<br>  Una cosa es "estar" en pareja, otra muy disinta es involucrarte en lo que verdaderamente significa. Muchos están con alguien x costumbrem, o "xq no le quedó otra" y es ahí cuando al primer desliz puedes caer. Pero, te lo aseguro, si amas, si realmente AMAS a esa persona, tu condición instintiva de "animal" pasa a ser "humana" y no necesitas a otra persona para vivir que no sea pura y exclusivamente esa.

0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	I'm not entirely sure myself, however, I've been told that it's something like an electrical short in the brain.  Your eye sees something, and it skips a step on its way to being processed.  Which creates like a repeat effect ie: de ja vu.<br>  Another, slightly more weird approach is that the exact same thing happened in a previous life.  But I think that only applies if you believe in Reincarnation.|`|177ea6d4b01528e5b1f657b8f351bb29aa	Deja Vu is mostly an artifact of how the mind works.  The concious mind registers reality between 0,5 and 1 second after all the information is already in the brain.  Why this is so is a matter of speculation, but the best reason I have read is to allow all the different sensory input to be coordinated.  Watch yourself touch something; sure seems simultaneous, right?  Well, the pathways for both of these inputs are quite different and the brain needs time to get it all sorted out.  If these inputs were not coordinated, you might feel the touch a full half second before you saw it.<br>  <br>  The second piece of the puzzle is the fact that our brain can learn, even when our mind does not get involved.  One person I read about had a lesion in the brain that prevented him from creating new long-term memories.  His old memories were intact, and he could hold a conversation easily.  But if you talked to him, left the room for a few hours and came back, he would have no idea that you had talked to him earlier.  Awful condition.  However, he could learn a complicated physical task, and would get better and better at it, even though each time he tried the task, he thought it was for the first time.  Some part of his brain was laying down some sort of memory without his mind actually being involved.<br>  <br>  Ok, so we are always behind reality, and some other parts of our brain may be reacting before our concious mind gets the message.  Some of these parts are quite capable of forming impressions and even memories without the mind being involved.  Deja Vu is the effect of us accessing these "other" memories that were laid down just a half second earlier.  We feel like this is all familiar, but we have no explicit memory.  We have no reference point about "when" these memories were laid down.  They are just somehow there.  Very spooky.|`|AA10066064	I have experienced that a lot of times before. For example, you are in a situation that you think "had already happened before" although you really know it has never happened before. It's like you had a premonition and by Deja Vu, you remember having known that this situation will happen.|`|c98a8c8d8a2cbc083fb1ebd86c002a72aa	I don't know how Deja Vu works, but when I was a teenager I experienced this phenomenon frequently. All the episodes only lasted a few seconds, but had amazing clarity. Sometimes it happens now, but not very often. Sometimes I "see instances in life" up to a year in advance. When the sequence unfolds I know within 1 or 2 seconds that I have "seen" this before. I know this is weird but that's just me.|`|faeb0b6ea478db5d06efa1aee83bba75aa	oh, I wish I could remember where I read this....<br>  <br>  it interests me too.  it was originally thought to be a psychic experience, but I wanted to know the science behind it.<br>  <br>  I read that it is just your brain processing the information slowly, so part of it is transfered to your memory before you consciously process the event.  Thus, when you experience it, you already have the "memory" of it stored away.  I hope that makes sense, its quite late.|`|63097164299f244c6e96b850b8753b73aa	i heard sumwhere that deja vu is actually just a VERY strong feeling that you've seen it before, you actually havent seen it, you just get the feeling.  check wikipedia, i may be wrong

However, there is still "divine inspiration" which should not be confused with your fantasies of what you want to be reality (e.g. there are many maniacs who feel God "speaks" to them).<br>  <br>  Generally, you would have to be very holy for such true inspiration and especially prophecy.<br>  <br>  Having a relationship with the Lord, however, is another matter.

Porque yo no te entendi absolutamente nada.|`|7939e4125ca117a3e6c39877f2a9b099aa	En la primera frase no es indispensable el uso del pronombre de complemento indirecto, por lo tanto si dices "lo está comiendo" o "se lo está comiendo" es lo mismo....solamente sustituyes el verbo "comer" por la variante reflexiva "comerse" que no es del todo funcional, al menos en este caso. La segunda tampoco es incorrecta, aunque suena algo redundante: es más pulcro decir "había dos, pero uno se cayó en el piso (o al piso)". No olvides que "por favor" se escribe separado....y "por qué" también (cuando preguntas). Y "necesito" es primero con "c" y luego con "s".<br>  Saludos.

9449e10cc4bd54a354c906e0564176ecaa	It seems that the real hot buttons between those two are homosexuality and abortion.  Liberal Christians have a tendency to argue in favor of these things; though there are some who are against them.  I think a lot of times, fundies just don't hear the Liberal Christians out, though.  Like, I have heard some liberals state that they don't feel that abortion or gay marriage are necessarily good things, but at the time time, they don't think it would be a good idea to have laws against them.  <br>  <br>  I guess you could say that Evangelicals have a tendency to see the world through more of a black and white lens, and that's why there's tension.|`|40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	There are several reasons. <br>  <br>  A key factor is the human failing of vanity.  We all like to believe that we are right.  The higher the stakes of the question, the more intense this feeling becomes.  The question of the fate of one's immortal soul is pretty high stakes, thus the level of passion involved in whether one has correctly interpreted the will of God run high - even to the level of hate.  This is unfortunate, but easily observable.  <br>  <br>  Related to this is the issue of confidence.  Unfortunately, some people chose to bolster their sense of confidence in their own choices by tearing down someone else's.  A lot of people are not even aware that they do this, but that pattern is there.  We have a name for it: "holier than thou".<br>  <br>  There will always be a diversity of religious preference.  That is to say, that some people will be content with a "low tension" faith that promises little, but also demands little, whereas others will be drawn to a "high tension" faith, where the cost of discipleship is much higher.  You could see it as a kind of spiritual economics, and some people are willing to pay more.  <br>  <br>  Unfortuantely, the intensity of feeling in "high tension" groups is quite likely to cause conflict with those who don't share their vision.  High tension faiths are often motivated by a well-founded desire for reform and well-intentioned desire for purity.  Both have to do with the search for truth.  If you believe you have found truth, it is natural to want to share it.  Doctrine _is_ important.<br>  <br>  However, while faith may be personal, the practice of religion is generally social, and therefore given to the same failing of any social organization.  One of these, is that when threatened, the organization goes on the defensive - and defensive people are never very pleasant.<br>  <br>  Which brings to your question: why do Fundamentalists and Liberals hate each other?  Is the dynamic of the scenarios I have outlined above.  Each believes passionately, each is committed to their interpreation of Scripture, and both (whether they admit it or not) feel instituationally threatened by secular forces, and non-Christian faiths within our pluralistic society.  Therefore, they both dig thier heels in and attack the errors they seen in each other.<br>  <br>  It is an unfortunate part of human nature.  No one fights more fiercely than siblings.<br>  <br>  I think both would do well to internalize the words of the prophet Micah:<br>  <br>  "He has shown you, o Man, what is good.<br>  And what does the Lord require of you, but to do JUSTICE, to love KINDNESS, and walk along HUMBLY, with your God."<br>  (Micah 6:8)|`|2af7a75aee5fce97b1d6dc6069aea4e8aa	Because liberals hate conservatives and conservatives hate liberals.|`|842466b911ff3f082a7080bf29d4ae42aa	Jesus said if you love me you will keep my comandments.  So liberals are not Christians, they are just ppl Satan is using to give real Christians a bad name.|`|AA11828783	Well.... as a Christian, I don't beleive we should hate anybody. That is hard to do sometimes with people like Bin Laden, but I don't hate Liberals. However, as a Christian, it is my belief that the Bible is God's word. He is the true author, and has used man to put His words on paper for us to read. And the Bible speaks strongly against abortion and homosexuality, which are two issues that most liberals argue for. For this reason, I have a hard time understanding liberal Christians points of view. Part of being a Chrisitian is a belief in the Bible, and you can't pick and choose which verses accomodate what you WANT to believe.|`|b04fbfe80726bc268d8ec0b353456b51aa	Well, liberals are as convinced "fundies" are wrong as "fundies" are ocnvinced liberals are wrong.<br>  I am a conservative Christian myself, and I believe I can honestly say today that I do not hate anybody,  much less "liberal" Christians (whatever that means!  it has many definitions).   <br>  Yes, I have read and heard some unkind things said by conservative Christians about liberals, and it hurts, because it seems to me to be so inconsistant.  However I believe most mature believers would not take on that attitude.<br>  I have seen and heard much more hateful stuff written and said about conservatives, however.  The very expression "fundies" raises a whole field of insults in your mind, doesn't it?<br>  One kind of "liberal Christians"  believes that the Bible is not really the Word of God, and that Jesus doesn?'t necessarily have to be God or to have risen from the dead.  Well, there is no need ot hate someone like that, but neither could I call such a person a real Christian, except in the cultural sense.  He might be a fine example of a person, I might admire many things about him, but his belief system would not be Christian.  (He might share many Christian values).<br>  So, since I believe the Bible is true, that Jesus is God, and that He physically rose from the dead, I have to say that kind of liberal is wrong. Otherwise I would be a hypocrite, wouldn't I?<br>  On the other hand, "liberal" often refers to the way one interprets the Scriptures,  to a certain open-mindedness, etc.  I think in the eyes of some, even I am a liberal.    In the eyes of others, I am an extreme fundamentalist!!!!

Je vous écrit pour préciser les points que vous m’avez demandé. C’est vrai que les Témoins de Jéhovah sont une religion assez rare. Il y en a a peu près 100 000 en Pologne. Il y a plusieurs raisons pour lesquelles j’ai choisi cette religion.<br>  Premièrement, les Témoins de Jéhovah ne prennent pas le part dans les guerres. Nous sommes une organisation qui aime la paix et garde la neutralité dans les événements politiques. Ensuite on a un grand respect pour la Bible, on la prend au sérieux et on la lit régulièrement. C’est elle qui codifie ma vie ainsi je ne fume pas, je ne boit pas trop d’alcool et j’essai d'être toujours honnête et de mener une vie morale.<br>  On se rencontrent trois fois par semaine. On a pas d’églises mais les salles (parfois elles sont signées ? Salle des Témoins de Jéhovah ?). Chaque groupe se compose de plus ou moins 70 personnes.<br>  Les croyances des Témoins de Jéhovah sont proches de celles des catholiques (on a la même Bible). Les différences principales sont :<br>  - on croit qu’il y a seulement un vrai Dieu et son prénom est Jéhovah<br>  - on ne fête pas No?l ou Paques, on a seulement une fête pendant toute l’année : la fête en souvenir de Jésus (une fois par an)<br>  - on ne mange pas de repas qui contienne du sang, on est aussi contre les transfusions de sang<br>  Je respecte tous ces règles mais je suis tolérante et je sais qu’il y a beaucoup de religions dans le Monde. Je crois que chacun a le droit d’avoir une religion choisie par soi-même et comme ma religion n’est pas très commune je suis habituée que la majorité de gens ne partage pas mes croyances. J‘ai fréquenté l’école où il y avait des gens qui appartenaient aux diverses confessions (surtout le catholicisme). J’ai aussi beaucoup d’amis qui ne sont pas des Témoins de Jéhovah et je respecte leurs croyances.<br>  <br>  Tout ce que j’ai écris est très général. Pour savoir plus veuillez visiter un site officiel des Témoins de Jéhovah: www.watchtower.org<br>  <br>  Ce qui concerne mon niveau de fran?ais j’ai passé l’examen Delf B2. Ca avait lieu en Juin et je n’ai pas encore mon dipl?me. Je le recevrai en Octobre. Sur mon baccalauréat j’ai passé le fran?ais écrit et oral (niveau avancé).<br>  <br>  S’il s’agit de mes projets futurs, après le retour de la France je voudrais continuer mes études (la faculté de sinologie). Plus tard, je voudrais avoir un travail ou l’on est amené à voyager et rencontrer des gens de pays divers. Peut-être j'étudierai une autre langue étrangère dans le futur.

WEEJieyIaa	1. Evolution is only a theory. It is not a fact or a scientific law.<br>  2. Evolution is unscientific, because it is not testable or falsifiable. <br>  3. Nobody has ever seen a new species evolve.<br>  4. The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that systems must become more disordered over time. <br>  5. Mutations are essential to evolution theory, but mutations can only eliminate traits. They cannot produce new features.<br>  <br>  Bonus: 6. Recent discoveries prove that even at the microscopic level, life has a quality of complexity that could not have come about through evolution.|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	Fossils is what your whole evolutionary theory was founded on.    There is no evidence that life can spring into being by itself. They have tried to recreate the conditions for life to start and it was a dismal failure. There have been tests done with fruit flies as they live and die very rapidly and can produce thousands of generations to watch evolution by. So far no net evolution. scientists were able to create fruit flies with extra wings through breeding but they were cripples which could not exist outside the laboratory.  Think about this, the first early so called simple life form would still need some method to reproduce, nourish itself, expel waste, store knowledge or there would be no net gain. It would also be able to know how to determine what a positive gain is. <br>  Many of the so called proofs of evolution have since been discarded although they still appear in many science text books as proof. Such examples are haeknels embryo's which were known fakes for a hundred years. The peppered moth proof turned out to be photo's that were staged and now are being questioned. Proteins only use left handed amino acids yet every test to create them results in roughly a fifty/fifty ratio of left and right handed amino acids. There is no known mechanism for separating these amino acids which would allow them to for a chain.|`|2a7bfedd529d64d55e216a90bb921c42aa	go back to basic earth science class if you believe fossils are a rare item on this planet.  if you can't realize some basic facts, I have no ground to help you.|`|842466b911ff3f082a7080bf29d4ae42aa	Sorry the Bible says not to cast your pearls before swine.|`|AA12359663	Read Genesis.

Any one.  Good, concrete evidence that these species has evolved.  Not a theory that it probably did from such and such an animal.<br>  <br>  Why hasn't evolution continued to take place?  Should we not see species evolving right now - depsite the fact that the process is slow?<br>  <br>  Why would humans have evolved as they did? They lost all their natural defenses to stand up right.  In fact, according to evolution our brain size didn't increase until much later.  So what would have been the advantage for a species to shed all of it's natural defenses (hair, teeth, sharp claws, speed etc)?  And how could humans have survived the process of evolving long enough to develop the larger brains?<br>  <br>  The chances of evolution actually having occured.  Do you know the actual percentage of possibility attached to the universe being created by some random, accidential event?  Not to mention combining in the factor of everything having to mutate in order for life advancement.  I have a better chance of my husband having the same DNA as me then the world does of being created by the big bang.<br>  <br>  And why can't fossil evidence be counted?  We do have some fossils.  We don't these show evolution at all.  There are a lot of theories - but the fossils we do have don't show any concrete proof.  And they can't be that rare becuase they sell them in local rock shops across the country.<br>  <br>  *I'm not Christian but thought I'd add my two sense anyway.|`|AA10242926	Evolution assumes that there was a 'big bang'.   Doesn't this assumption take faith to make it feasable?   I mean, what exactly went BANG?  <br>  In the past there have been experiments with carbon dating.  One experiment involved some scrapings from a live turtle shell.  These scrapings were carbon dated and found to be millions of years old!??<br>  If life came from chance then why can't the great scientists of today with all of their technology and their laboratories even make a simple life form?  They have all of the ingredients that our bodies consist of.  And yet, scientists fail at making a life.  But pure chance apart from any inteligence is capable of producing all of the life we have on Earth???  I don't buy this notion. <br>  I believe God made us.  I also think that people who don't believe in God are foolish dreamers who just want to be able to live however they want and not have to answer to anybody about it.

While labs have been able to get certain nucleotides to join this does not a cell make.<br>  Cells require many things to be functioning. Certain proteins must be present in the phospholipid bilayer in order to have fluidity. Without fluidity the cell could not  bring in nutrients or get rid of waste. Also, some sort of energy system is required. Our cells use mitochondria, these are complex organelles. The point I am reaching is complex irreducibility. Inside the nucleus of the cell resides complex DNA. The DNA is responsible for every protein made in the cell. The process of unwinding and copying the DNA and then making one protein includes many steps. Remove one step and you do not have the desired protein. Even if you started with the simplest cell imagineable, to get the simplest DNA imagineable requires astronomical odds. If you examine the flagellum on a simple paramecium you will find that it is very complex. It resembles the propeller on a boat motor, literally. It even includes a U-joint. Remove one component and no flagellum. So, in order to get to evolution, you have to get past the first cell. Crazy thing is that I believe God used some sort of evolution as a tool to create the world we live in. So you could consider me a theistic evolutionist. Hope this answers your question and if I think of more or come across more I will add.

A great deal of thought & research has been devoted to the subject of how, and why, the Nazi party was able to accomplish what it did.  It's not so simple as Hitler, or any other party official, "spinning" the exterminations in a positive light.  <br>  <br>  For starters, anti-semitic sentiment had been steadily building since the days of the Weimar Republic, during which the "Jewish Conspiracy" was first proposed as an explanation for Germany's defeat in WWI.  So it was not a new thing.  Also, the activities of the concentration camps and of the German soldiers in the Jewish Ghettoes wasn't transparent to the German populace.  Initially, the concentration camps were just that - it wasn't until years later that the liquidations began, in secret.  Lastly, the social psychology of the circumstance has been brought into question by several authors (See: Goldhagen, "Hitler's Willing Executioners"), regarding the capacity of authority & delineation of responsibility to enable otherwise normal people to perpetrate atrocities.  It's also worth checking out "Eichmann in Jerusalem", by Arendt, for an interesting look at amorality in the context of the Holocaust.<br>  <br>  You could also spend some time studying the larger sociological concept of obedience to authority.  A famous book of the same name by Milgram details some rather extraordinary, and at times disturbing, experimental results on the subject.

On the one hand there is the question of whether or not modern organisms have evolved from older ancestral organisms or whether modern species are continuing to change over time. On the other hand there are questions about the mechanism of the observed changes... how did evolution occur? Biologists consider the existence of biological evolution to be a fact. It can be demonstrated today and the historical evidence for its occurrence in the past is overwhelming. However, biologists readily admit that they are less certain of the exact mechanism of evolution; there are several theories of the mechanism of evolution. Stephen J. Gould has put this as well as anyone else:<br>  <br>      In the American vernacular, "theory" often means "imperfect fact"--part of a hierarchy of confidence running downhill from fact to theory to hypothesis to guess. Thus the power of the creationist argument: evolution is "only" a theory and intense debate now rages about many aspects of the theory. If evolution is worse than a fact, and scientists can't even make up their minds about the theory, then what confidence can we have in it? Indeed, President Reagan echoed this argument before an evangelical group in Dallas when he said (in what I devoutly hope was campaign rhetoric): "Well, it is a theory. It is a scientific theory only, and it has in recent years been challenged in the world of science--that is, not believed in the scientific community to be as infallible as it once was."<br>  <br>      Well evolution is a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts don't go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. Einstein's theory of gravitation replaced Newton's in this century, but apples didn't suspend themselves in midair, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from ape-like ancestors whether they did so by Darwin's proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered.<br>  <br>      Moreover, "fact" doesn't mean "absolute certainty"; there ain't no such animal in an exciting and complex world. The final proofs of logic and mathematics flow deductively from stated premises and achieve certainty only because they are not about the empirical world. Evolutionists make no claim for perpetual truth, though creationists often do (and then attack us falsely for a style of argument that they themselves favor). In science "fact" can only mean "confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional consent." I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.<br>  <br>      Evolutionists have been very clear about this distinction of fact and theory from the very beginning, if only because we have always acknowledged how far we are from completely understanding the mechanisms (theory) by which evolution (fact) occurred. Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory--natural selection--to explain the mechanism of evolution.<br>  <br>      - Stephen J. Gould, " Evolution as Fact and Theory"; Discover, May 1981<br>  <br>  Gould is stating the prevailing view of the scientific community. In other words, the experts on evolution consider it to be a fact. This is not an idea that originated with Gould as the following quotations indicate:<br>  <br>      Let me try to make crystal clear what is established beyond reasonable doubt, and what needs further study, about evolution. Evolution as a process that has always gone on in the history of the earth can be doubted only by those who are ignorant of the evidence or are resistant to evidence, owing to emotional blocks or to plain bigotry. By contrast, the mechanisms that bring evolution about certainly need study and clarification. There are no alternatives to evolution as history that can withstand critical examination. Yet we are constantly learning new and important facts about evolutionary mechanisms.<br>  <br>      - Theodosius Dobzhansky "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution", American Biology Teacher vol. 35 (March 1973) reprinted in Evolution versus Creationism, J. Peter Zetterberg ed., ORYX Press, Phoenix AZ 1983<br>  <br>  Also:<br>  <br>      It is time for students of the evolutionary process, especially those who have been misquoted and used by the creationists, to state clearly that evolution is a fact, not theory, and that what is at issue within biology are questions of details of the process and the relative importance of different mechanisms of evolution. It is a fact that the earth with liquid water, is more than 3.6 billion years old. It is a fact that cellular life has been around for at least half of that period and that organized multicellular life is at least 800 million years old. It is a fact that major life forms now on earth were not at all represented in the past. There were no birds or mammals 250 million years ago. It is a fact that major life forms of the past are no longer living. There used to be dinosaurs and Pithecanthropus, and there are none now. It is a fact that all living forms come from previous living forms. Therefore, all present forms of life arose from ancestral forms that were different. Birds arose from nonbirds and humans from nonhumans. No person who pretends to any understanding of the natural world can deny these facts any more than she or he can deny that the earth is round, rotates on its axis, and revolves around the sun.<br>  <br>      The controversies about evolution lie in the realm of the relative importance of various forces in molding evolution.<br>  <br>      - R. C. Lewontin "Evolution/Creation Debate: A Time for Truth" Bioscience 31, 559 (1981) reprinted in Evolution versus Creationism, op cit.<br>  <br>  This concept is also explained in introductory biology books that are used in colleges and universities (and in some of the better high schools). For example, in some of the best such textbooks we find:<br>  <br>      Today, nearly all biologists acknowledge that evolution is a fact. The term theory is no longer appropriate except when referring to the various models that attempt to explain how life evolves... it is important to understand that the current questions about how life evolves in no way implies any disagreement over the fact of evolution.<br>  <br>      - Neil A. Campbell, Biology 2nd ed., 1990, Benjamin/Cummings, p. 434<br>  <br>  Also:<br>  <br>      Since Darwin's time, massive additional evidence has accumulated supporting the fact of evolution--that all living organisms present on earth today have arisen from earlier forms in the course of earth's long history. Indeed, all of modern biology is an affirmation of this relatedness of the many species of living things and of their gradual divergence from one another over the course of time. Since the publication of The Origin of Species, the important question, scientifically speaking, about evolution has not been whether it has taken place. That is no longer an issue among the vast majority of modern biologists. Today, the central and still fascinating questions for biologists concern the mechanisms by which evolution occurs.<br>  <br>      - Helena Curtis and N. Sue Barnes, Biology 5th ed. 1989, Worth Publishers, p. 972<br>  <br>  One of the best introductory books on evolution (as opposed to introductory biology) is that by Douglas J. Futuyma, and he makes the following comment:<br>  <br>      A few words need to be said about the "theory of evolution," which most people take to mean the proposition that organisms have evolved from common ancestors. In everyday speech, "theory" often means a hypothesis or even a mere speculation. But in science, "theory" means "a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed." as the Oxford English Dictionary defines it. The theory of evolution is a body of interconnected statements about natural selection and the other processes that are thought to cause evolution, just as the atomic theory of chemistry and the Newtonian theory of mechanics are bodies of statements that describe causes of chemical and physical phenomena. In contrast, the statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors--the historical reality of evolution--is not a theory. It is a fact, as fully as the fact of the earth's revolution about the sun. Like the heliocentric solar system, evolution began as a hypothesis, and achieved "facthood" as the evidence in its favor became so strong that no knowledgeable and unbiased person could deny its reality. No biologist today would think of submitting a paper entitled "New evidence for evolution;" it simply has not been an issue for a century.<br>  <br>      - Douglas J. Futuyma, Evolutionary Biology, 2nd ed., 1986, Sinauer Associates, p. 15<br>  <br>  There are readers of these newsgroups who reject evolution for religious reasons. In general these readers oppose both the fact of evolution and theories of mechanisms, although some anti-evolutionists have come to realize that there is a difference between the two concepts. That is why we see some leading anti-evolutionists admitting to the fact of "microevolution"--they know that evolution can be demonstrated. These readers will not be convinced of the "facthood" of (macro)evolution by any logical argument and it is a waste of time to make the attempt. The best that we can hope for is that they understand the argument that they oppose. Even this simple hope is rarely fulfilled.<br>  <br>  There are some readers who are not anti-evolutionist but still claim that evolution is "only" a theory which can't be proven. This group needs to distinguish between the fact that evolution occurs and the theory of the mechanism of evolution.<br>  <br>  We also need to distinguish between facts that are easy to demonstrate and those that are more circumstantial. Examples of evolution that are readily apparent include the fact that modern populations are evolving and the fact that two closely related species share a common ancestor. The evidence that Homo sapiens and chimpanzees share a recent common ancestor falls into this category. There is so much evidence in support of this aspect of primate evolution that it qualifies as a fact by any common definition of the word "fact."<br>  <br>  In other cases the available evidence is less strong. For example, the relationships of some of the major phyla are still being worked out. Also, the statement that all organisms have descended from a single common ancestor is strongly supported by the available evidence, and there is no opposing evidence. However, it is not yet appropriate to call this a "fact" since there are reasonable alternatives.<br>  <br>  Finally, there is an epistemological argument against evolution as fact. Some readers of these newsgroups point out that nothing in science can ever be "proven" and this includes evolution. According to this argument, the probability that evolution is the correct explanation of life as we know it may approach 99.9999...9% but it will never be 100%. Thus evolution cannot be a fact. This kind of argument might be appropriate in a philosophy class (it is essentially correct) but it won't do in the real world. A "fact," as Stephen J. Gould pointed out (see above), means something that is so highly probable that it would be silly not to accept it. This point has also been made by others who contest the nit-picking epistemologists.<br>  <br>      The honest scientist, like the philosopher, will tell you that nothing whatever can be or has been proved with fully 100% certainty, not even that you or I exist, nor anyone except himself, since he might be dreaming the whole thing. Thus there is no sharp line between speculation, hypothesis, theory, principle, and fact, but only a difference along a sliding scale, in the degree of probability of the idea. When we say a thing is a fact, then, we only mean that its probability is an extremely high one: so high that we are not bothered by doubt about it and are ready to act accordingly. Now in this use of the term fact, the only proper one, evolution is a fact. For the evidence in favor of it is as voluminous, diverse, and convincing as in the case of any other well established fact of science concerning the existence of things that cannot be directly seen, such as atoms, neutrons, or solar gravitation ....<br>  <br>      So enormous, ramifying, and consistent has the evidence for evolution become that if anyone could now disprove it, I should have my conception of the orderliness of the universe so shaken as to lead me to doubt even my own existence. If you like, then, I will grant you that in an absolute sense evolution is not a fact, or rather, that it is no more a fact than that you are hearing or reading these words.<br>  <br>      - H. J. Muller, "One Hundred Years Without Darwin Are Enough" School Science and Mathematics 59, 304-305. (1959) reprinted in Evolution versus Creationism op cit.<br>  <br>  In any meaningful sense evolution is a fact, but there are various theories concerning the mechanism of evolution.|`|AA11320206	WOW......I mean....just....WOW.....you've convinced me!!!|`|aBDDC5xnaa	I'm sorry that you are so ignorant.|`|cc8a1da5bcd8a28a3d70ec6a97690a79aa	Somehow I find it more feasible that our universe took billions of years to create than a snap of a finger if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  The Grand Canyon is still being carved deeper each passing year at about a few mm each year.

ojRjukFMaa	One of the ways to increase traffic is to start or join or host a blog carnival. (<a href="http://blogcarnival.com/bc/)" rel="nofollow">http://blogcarnival.com/bc/)</a> You can see an example of what a blog carnival looks like here (<a href="http://50daysafter.blogspot.com/index.html)" rel="nofollow">http://50daysafter.blogspot.com/index.ht...</a> and you can see why it might bring traffic to your blog to participate in one.<br>  <br>  Blogging tends to be a community effort....so be part of the community of bloggers that you fit into. Read other's blogs, comment on them, and when you see a good post on someone else's blog that is particulary good link to it and say so. As you get know in your "community" and produce content worth linking to, they will return the favors. I am a Catholic blogger and my blog is listed on a couple of catholic blogrolls....search out blogrolls that have to do with the topic of your blogging and find out how to join. RETURN the favor and link to blogs that you consider worthwihle.<br>  <br>  Content, content, content. Pick a rate at which you post and STICK to it. If it's daily then, post daily. Weekly etc....your readers need to be able to count on you. <br>  <br>  Allow comments and ALWAYS respond to them. I personally respect and place more stock in bloggers that allow comments fromt hose who disagree with them (as long as they are not abusive.) Yes you take the risk that someone is going be mean to you but if you have something worth saying chances are someone is going to disagree. Always respond politely and gently. Not easy with jerks but you will gain respect of your readers by your measured and charitable responses.<br>  <br>  Here are some articles to give you some more ideas:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?16-Ways-to-Drive-Traffic-to-Your-Blog&id=22928" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?16-Ways-to-Dri...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/06/how_to_get_traf.html" rel="nofollow">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/21-tactics-to-increase-blog-traffic" rel="nofollow">http://www.seomoz.org/blog/21-tactics-to...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.searchengineguide.com/tinu/003624.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.searchengineguide.com/tinu/00...</a>|`|oSzJKUkTaa	<a href="http://trafficg.com/?member=weez3r" rel="nofollow">http://trafficg.com/?member=weez3r</a><br>  <br>  try that out. free and simple.<br>  <br>  hey i got a blog too. <a href="http://ihopeuenjoythis.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://ihopeuenjoythis.blogspot.com</a>

e6AbbuYyaa	Germanic mythology tends to do things in threes, primarily.<br>  <br>  In Beowulf specifically, there is a progression of ideas, as well:<br>  <br>  1.  Beowulf defeats Grendel through his own strength and heroism.<br>  2. Beowulf defeats the sea hag, Grendel's mother, through gaining access to a historical artifact, the sword of giants.  In the Germanic worldview, objects gain importance through their connection to the past; the primordial nature of the sword's origin is a power otherwise beyond Beowulf's reach.<br>  3. Beowulf defeats the dragon through sacral kingship; as evidenced both by his undertaking the task to defend his kingdom, rather than achieve wordfame, and by the participation of his loyal thane.  Again, in the Germanic worldview, sacral kingship is the greatest possible source of "hamingja," or Luck.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind these are *heathen* answers.  Your professor may disagree.  ;-)|`|pS2YuMNvaa	Because the anglo-saxons like drama? Because Beowulf never knew when to say NO when people asked him for help?<br>  <br>  Because 3 is a significant number? 3 stikes your out, 3 days of death before Christ rose, 3 monkies in the hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil?|`|BmpdPS0waa	I totally agree with Boar's Head, but here's some things to consider as well.<br>  There are also theories that the first and second parts of Beowolf's adventure is the original myth and slowly with the passage of time and with the process of the oral story telling, the story became stretched out, adding Christian references and themes to "Christianize" the legend. Thus, Beowolf sacrifices himself for the community at large, and shows a humbleness in Beowolf. This third story has many themes and likenesses to Christianity, allowing those who passed the story down in the oral tradition to tell the story without fear of persecution. The story is supposed to take place around 400 AD and the first, and only, written account is from about 1000 AD. So lots of opportunities for people to interfere with the text and add parts that may not have been in there in the first place.<br>  A really interesting interpretation--highly unlikely, but still interesting-- of Beowolf is the movie version of Beowolf and Grendel with Gerard Butler. The movie brings up some interesting theories on how the evolution of the story came to be and the possible "historic" explanations of the story. The movie itself isn't the best, but if you are looking into the different angles, its one to consider.

UrgsYz94aa	'The early relationship between Egypt and Cush<br>  Northern Sudan's earliest historical record comes from Egyptian sources, which described the land upstream from the first cataract, called Cush, as "wretched." For more than 2,000 years after the Old Kingdom (ca. 2700-2180 B.C.), Egyptian political and economic activities determined the course of the central Nile region's history. Even during intermediate periods when Egyptian political power in Cush waned, Egypt exerted a profound cultural and religious influence on the Cushite people. <br>  Over the centuries, trade developed. Egyptian caravans carried grain to Cush and returned to Aswan with ivory, incense, hides, and carnelian (a stone prized both as jewelry and for arrowheads) for shipment downriver. Egyptian traders particularly valued gold and slaves, who served as domestic servants, concubines, and soldiers in the pharaoh's army.'<br>  <br>  Go to the following website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/nepeople/a/cush.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/nepeo...</a>|`|35fbe07755fc9a8f0c10d4099dc26dd3aa	hmmm
Y7aEq0IPaa	Actually if you look at the story itself in Genesis 9.25ff, Ham was not cursed -- his son Canaan was.  There is nothing at all to suggest that his other sons (Kush, Mitsraim, etc.) were cursed.<br>  <br>  In Genesis 10, various nations are described as having been descended from each of Noah's three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  Terms like Semitic (meaning descended from Shem) and Hamitic (meaning descended from Ham) are used even today to describe different language families in the Middle East, and it is worth knowing where the terminology comes from.<br>  <br>  Because some of the descendants of Ham included African nations like Ethiopia (Kush in Hebrew) and Egypt (Mitsraim in Hebrew), Europeans in the 19th century who believed in three races sometimes associated the so-called ***** or black race with the descendants of Ham.<br>  <br>  (This is despite the fact that the 19th century division of people groups into broad "race" categories was grounded in a very flawed understanding of genetics, and the resulting "races" are actually social groupings with no basis in biology.)<br>  <br>  In America in the 1840s and 1850s, when the institution of African slavery was under fierce attack from Christians in the North and in England, some southern American Christians came up with a bizarre theology of a "curse of Ham" as an excuse for continuing the institution of race-based slavery.<br>  <br>  Most Christians even at the time found the idea absurd (since the Bible itself never describes a curse on Ham's African descendants -- only Canaan and the Canaanites), but it was popular for a while in certain racist circles as a way to excuse slavery of Africans, and unfortunately you can still find a few people (a small minority even in the American South) that believe it even today.|`|50deae2a31d97a07e20a3b7365fb20a4aa	Ham was cursed by Noah, and he was to serve his brothers forever. It doesn't say specifically that he was black.<br>  Some used this scripture as justification to enslave blacks.<br>  Noah had 3 sons, probably the fathers of the main race-groups we have today.

Do you want 100% confirmation that Egyptians were black? That does not exist. <br>  However depictions on walls of ancient Egyptians contrast Nubian features from Egyptian features (being more aquiline). Nubians are also painted black whilst Egyptians are painted different shades of brown. But you knew this...|`|UnML3yNOaa	Osiris (Greek language, also Usiris; the Egyptian language name is variously transliterated Asar, Aser, Ausar, Wesir, or Ausare) is the Egyptian god of life, death, and fertility. He is one of the oldest Gods for whom records have survived and first appears in the pyramid texts around 2400 BC, when his cult is already well established. He was widely worshipped until the forceable suppression of paganism in the Christian era.[1][2] Osiris was not only the redeemer and merciful judge of the dead in the afterlife, but also the underworld agency that granted all life, including sprouting vegetation and the fertile flooding of the Nile River. The Kings of Egypt were associated with Osiris in death such that as Osiris rose from the dead so would they, in union with him, inherit eternal life through a process of imitative magic. By the New Kingdom all men, not just pharaohs, were believed to be associated with Osiris at death if they incurred the costs of the assimilation rituals.[3]<br>  <br>  Osiris is the oldest son of the Earth god, Geb, and the sky goddess, Nut as well as being brother and husband of Isis, with Horus being considered his posthumously begotten son. He is usually depicted as a green-skinned pharaoh wearing the Atef crown, a form of the white crown of upper Egypt with a plume of feathers to either side. Typically he is also depicted holding the crook and flail which signify divine authority in Egyptian kings, but which were originally unique to Osiris and his own origin-gods (see below), and his feet and lower body are wrapped, as though already partly mummified. The information we have on the myths of Osiris is derived from allusions contained in the pyramid texts, and, much later, in narrative style from the writings of Plutarch] and Diodorus Siculus.
eEVriJzaaa	That whole region, including Egypt and what we now know as the Middle East was under Ethiopia in ancient times.<br>  <br>  Ethiopia was black, although black is a Western term so maybe that's where the discrepancy is. They didn't call themselves black, but in the US they would be considered black.|`|FlWubFnhaa	Africa is the land of Kush to include Egypt.  Ham is the fathers of all fathers but Cush or Kush was one of the sons.  The bible uses words interchangeably.  Hamitics, Africans, Cushites, or blacks were not only in present day Africa but other parts of the world as well.  Nimrod was Cushite according to the bible.<br>  <br>  Do not try to understand biblical history using your black, white, brown, mentality.   It simply will not work.   At one point, both Egypt and Sudan were consider Egypt.<br>  <br>  All of your facts are discombobulated.  Stick to European history because there you will not have a problem agreeing with everything being white.   You now talk about Africa and you delineate whose who.  You do not have a clue, and I am so grateful that I no longer have to believe theologians like yourself.<br>  <br>  If you cannot be black in Africa, where can you be black-Russia?

f3a95b4c0d5743c7290138584c5ce3f3aa	I'm a Druid so I can't answer for the Wiccans. But I can tell you that we are both nature based, which means we respect the power of Earth and all the forces that govern it. We are a part of nature not commanders of it. The gods worshiped or honored are representations of natures forces. I became a Druid when I realized that my Christian education was not answering my questions adequately when it came to evolution and the power of the human mind. I was taught be them it was all the devils work, and I just could not believe that. I also came to the realization that the mind of the Creator was more complex then what Christians say. I have no hatred for Christianity, I just think that it has been corrupted by those that seek power over knowledge  throughout it's history. Pagans can live with science peacefully, while Christians seem to have a problem with science. To me, the Big Bang and evolution are the same as the creation, they are just different descriptions of the same event.<br>  For us Pagans, we use spells as our prayer and nature is our church. If you have a myspace please visit the link below and feel free to ask questions there as we are all glad to answer.|`|yAvTxh47aa	I've been Wiccan for over 20 years, there are a few minor issues I have with prariecrow's text, but these are semantic issues inappropriate for a beginner level, so I think it's a fine enough answer for you.|`|lwhzvlSMaa	I'm not Wiccan anymore but I'll tell you my story.  My sister was the one who pointed me towards Wicca.  I was checking it out because I had never heard of it and wanted to know what she was getting into.  As I read about it I sat there going, that's what I believe and what I've always believed!  I was shocked at how much it paralled with How I had felt all my life.  So I started studying it more.  I continued on the path until I started feeling like I was in a religous box.  So I did leave Wicca but I still enjoyed my time walking that path.  It was good to learn and it did help me long my spiritual path.|`|DDqgVQ49aa	Wicca is a very complex faith which embraces widely varying practices and many different Traditions. The following, however, is what I consider to be "the basics".<br>  <br>  Wicca is about 60 years old, with roots in Masonic practices, ceremonial magic, and the Romantic era's ideas of classical religions. Its founder was a British civil servant named Gerald Gardner.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geraldgardner.com/essays.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.geraldgardner.com/essays.php</a><br>  <br>  It is in many ways a postmodern faith, embracing religious relativism, and one that resonates powerfully for increasing numbers of people.<br>  <br>  The central tenet of the Wiccan religion is the Wiccan Rede: "If you harm none, do what you will." This is a deceptively simple "commandment" which can take a lifetime to contemplate and to master. Many Wiccans also believe in the Law of Threefold Return, sometimes called the Rule of Three: “Whatever you do, for good or ill, will come back upon you three times over.”<br>  <br>  Wiccans honor Deity as both male and female, God and Goddess -- or at the very least as Goddess. Many Wiccans believe that the universe is the body of God/dess, and therefore that all things contain Divine energy and that the world itself is sacred. Some Wiccans are polytheists (many God/desses); others are duotheists (God and Goddess, of whom all other Gods and Goddesses are simply aspects); others are monotheists (God and Goddess Themselves are simply aspects of an unknowable Source).<br>  <br>  Wiccans generally do not believe that God/dess is separate from the world; therefore, we have no concept of salvation, since God/dess is present to all and always. Many Wiccans believe that God/dess is too big to fit inside one religion -- all religions/spiritual paths are ways of reaching the same goal, and atheism and agnosticism are honorable perspectives on the mystery of life.<br>  <br>  Each Wiccan operates as their own priest/ess. We do not have a distinction between clergy and laity. Therefore, each Wiccan is responsible for their own personal development and for forging their own relationship with God/dess. Some Wiccans practice in covens, which are generally initiatory and require a long period of study (traditionally a year and a day) before entering. Others practice in loosely affiliated groups of solitaries, which are Wiccans who practice outside of traditional coven structure. Others simply practice alone.<br>  <br>  Wiccans do not usually have churches. We create sacred space as and where needed, by casting "circles" of energy which function as temples. When inside those circles, we invite the spirits of the four Platonic elements (air, fire, water, and earth) to join us, as well as the Goddess and the God (or at minimum the Goddess).<br>  <br>  Wiccans have celebrations which are timed to both the solar and lunar calendars. The solar festivals -- held at the solstices, the equinoxes, and four points in between them -- are called sabbats.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://paganwiccan.about.com/library/basics/blsabbats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://paganwiccan.about.com/library/bas...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_the_year" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_th...</a><br>  <br>  The lunar holy days are called esbats, and are held at the full moon each month, and sometimes at the new moon as well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esbat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esbat</a><br>  <br>  Many Wiccans practice witchcraft, which we see as working with the Divine energy that permeates the world to bring about change. In accordance with the Wiccan Rede, the vast majority of Wiccans will not curse or perform magic to bring harm upon anyone else.<br>  <br>  A relatively objective (non-Wiccan) set of articles on what Wiccans do and believe:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchc...</a><br>  <br>  Another useful article:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.religionfacts.com/neopaganism/paths/wicca.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religionfacts.com/neopaganism...</a><br>  <br>  A good site by Wiccans:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wicca.timerift.net" rel="nofollow">http://wicca.timerift.net</a><br>  <br>  And the US Army Chaplains Handbook excerpt on Wicca:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_usbk.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_us...</a><br>  <br>  If you're looking to do some reading, I'd recommend "Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner" by Scott Cunningham, and "The Triumph of the Moon" by Ronald Hutton.

Sometimes spirits just have a message they want to pass on before they can cross over. Sometimes they're lost and they have no idea where they're at, but all of a sudden they find someone who can actually see them when the rest of the world doesn't seem to be able to. Sometimes I've gotten a small child whose afraid to walk the tunnel into the light alone. And sometimes you get a mischievous or even downright evil spirit who decides they like toying with your mind and they don't want to leave. <br>  <br>  But to get rid of one... ask it to leave. For most spirits, it's as simple as telling them to go into the light. Or call your local spiritualist church and have experienced mediums help you evict them.

Sin embargo, también hay que tomar en cuenta que los animales son muy intuitivos, poseen sentidos muy agudos que nosotros tenemos muy poco desarrollados. Por ejemplo, dicen que los perros detectan los temblores antes de que ocurran, así que pues, no hay que extra?arse de lo de este gato. Lo que no me queda claro es, ?Cómo es que en un hospital, donde tienen muchas reglas de higiene y asepsia, tienen un animal que es potencialmente contagioso por los pelos que suelta? Mmm..<br>  También opino que el gato va ser muy solitario porque nadie se le va a querer acercar...

Had 700 acres to hunt on and 2 four acre ponds to fish in.  We ate what we killed, grew, or caught.  Simple life but I miss it.  The worst part is that every body knows everything about everybody.

FlWubFnhaa	I moved to El Paso to learn Spanish because I am in the Social Services field.   Grammar is hard when someone tries to remember it for the sake of passing tests and not to actually learn the language.<br>  <br>  I try to use small phrases with verbs, so I can use them as much as possible.    Grammar is only exciting when it gets beyond the pages and into your vocabulary on a daily basis.   The other day, I used the verb "estar" in three small sentences.  I did not say these sentences just to see how to use the verb; I actually have plans to use them at work and with my friends.  Repetition will breed familiarity.<br>  <br>  Also, try to fall in love with the language that you are studying and see yourself bilingual.   Do not try to learn only verbs; it does NOT help you to become bilingual faster.  The brain will not remember half of them because they are not connected with anything.<br>  <br>  As you learn verbs, let your focus change to learning idioms or small phrases because the brain remembers small "sayings" much quicker  than it does a single word.    It is a win-win situation, for you are learning both verbs and language at a much faster pace.|`|e566c7b6d9b860034b1ffaf13f380ee7aa	The answer is simple:  repitition.

Of course, he certainly *could* have been baptized before his execution, but scripture is silent on that point.  Nevertheless, it seems certain in scripture that an "11th hour" conversion does *not* require baptism.<br>  3) Presumably, any Christian has the right, but it *does* seem to be the case that only the apostles in scripture were specifically mentioned as Christian baptizers (John the Baptist did not baptize according to Christian mandates).  This is a matter of personal or sectarian belief - scripture makes no mention of the qualifications for being a baptizer.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.jimpettis.com/wheel/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jimpettis.com/wheel/</a>|`|8f6fbf8cd859c15e94f8ec3588ab74a2aa	The apostles were given the command by Jesus Christ himself  to go and make disciples baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.  (Matthew 28: 16-20)  Baptism is the outward expression of the inward faith of the believer. It does not save anyone, but is the symbol of the faith.  If anyone had the right  to baptize, it was these first church leaders.  Today, an ordained minister is given the right to baptize.  Hope this helps

CsFyFnwcaa	Man is neither good nor bad. He is whatever his environment shapes him to be. If he is grown in an environment that forces him to kill and perform other taboos of today's society, he will do them because there is no other experience to base reason and ethics off of. Social customs were created because people saw that they did not have to do certain things like kill people or perform cannibalism to survive and eventually those activities was seen as barbaric and then taboo.

EL concepto de vida eterna apareció muy poco antes del siglo I a.C., y no fue aceptado por la totalidad de las corrientes de pensamiento dentro del judaísmo; aparece en el libro de los Macabeos, escrito alredor de150 a?os antes de Cristo y dividido en dos libros. Esta idea sólo fue aceptada y defendida por la secta o corriente de los Fariseos.<br>  Para el Judío, no existía un "cielo", ál morir, el espíritu (concepto diferente al de "Alma") se hiba al Se?l, que es un lugar donde el hombre deambula como un "Zombie"; esperando la llegada de "los últimos tiempos", donde Dios destruiría al mundo y reconstituiría el "Paraíso Terrenal", e impondría un nuevo orden al mundo donde el judío lo dirijiría, siempre que hubiera sido fiel a "la promesa" y a la ley. Pero no se preocupaban mucho de explicar si TODOS gozarían de es "paraíso", ni que pasaría con los que no lo merecieran, ni tampoco si sería "eterno" o no.<br>  Ante tal panorama, el judío se contentaba con seguir los consejos de sus libros "sapiensales" como el Qoelet, o el ibro de Job, tratando de tener muchos hijos que velaran su vejez y le recordaran por generaciones y generaciones (con la idea de que, al permancecer en el recuerdo de tus descendientes, de cierta forma, seguías vivo) y de tener una vida material próspera, llena de ganado y propiedades (mucha lana), idea que hasta la actualidad conservan.<br>  Yo creo que, precisamente ese problema de no tener muy claro que pasa con el hombre al morir fue el campo fértil para ideas como la Farisea, en un principio, y la Cristiana, después.....|`|rOboUJvKaa	Ninguno, que yo recuerde. Solamente a través de la tergiversación y el ama?amiento de la filosofía del nazareno se comienza a hablar de "salvación"...<br>  <br>  Por cierto, ?de qué o para qué?<br>  <br>  <br>  Setanta, el Perro de Culann.|`|rkBBWq7haa	Se?orita, una Excelente pregunta, ideal para aquellos que nos gusta opinar acerca de estos temas, fíjate que leyendo las respuestas que te han dado, ninguna responde de manera concreta tu pregunta, ya que si te das cuenta te dicen todo acerca de lo nuevo, a no ser de una buena respuesta que leí, Pero mira, desde mi particular punto de vista... muuuy mio .... creo que el concepto de salvacion en el antiguo testamento era un lugar de reposo, lo que nosotros llamamos Vida eterna, en el AT era resumido a ir a "Descansar" al seno de "Abraham", eso era su concepto de Salvación, ademas de esperar el cumplimiento de la promesa del Mesias... a lo largo del AT te encontrarás con que Dios hizo Pactos con su PUEBLO, es decir, y aqui es un punto muuuy importante, el hecho de ser Israelita  en el AT, significaba salvación automática, por lo tanto al dejar la vida física su condición espiritual se transformaba en una actividad de reposo en el Seno de su Padre Abraham.<br>  <br>  Todo esto es lo que yo creo y opino desde mi particular punto de vista.|`|f3dec6c2a38bf1f592e891d28851da9caa	Salvacion como tal no existia, porque segun cuenta la biblia "dormian con sus padres";  Siempre y cuando claro, hicieran lo agradable a los ojos de Dios.|`|LMUB7Mh0aa	Hola, Maritza.<br>  <br>  Resulta que la revelación es gradual.  Dios se va revelando poco a poco.  A Abraham, por ejemplo, sólo le dijo: "Quiero ser tu Dios", no se problematizó hablándole de dioses falsos.<br>  El pueblo hebreo no era teórico en su vida religiosa, sino práctico:  tenían enemigos, tenían ganado, vecinos, y buscaban soluciones vitales, por eso caían fácilmente en la superstición y la idolatría.  Por no se hacían preguntas sobre qué era exactamente el alma, y Dios los dejaba así.  Su concepto nebuloso del alma le sirve ahora de pretexto a los Testigos de Jehová para negar el alma, los saduceos ya negaban la resurrección en tiempos de Jesús. El ateísmo no es nuevo.<br>  <br>  El concepto de salvación judío, pues, va así:  si eres justo a los ojos de Dios, se va a notar porque él te bendice en tu vida y te da bienestar, honra, riqueza.  Si te da sufrimiento, pobreza, es porque eres malo y en esta vida llevas tu merecido. Por eso el maltrato de los pobres.<br>  <br>  De hecho se parece al concepto protestante, por eso viven bajo el signo del dólar.  En fin.  Volviendo al judío, a los buenos Dios los va a resucitar al final de los tiempos para darles una vida feliz.<br>  <br>  Lee este texto, es clarísimo:<br>  <br>  II Macabeos   7<br>  1Sucedió también que siete hermanos apresados junto con su madre, eran forzados por el rey, flagelados con azotes  y nervios de buey, a probar carne de puerco (prohibida por la Ley).<br>  2Uno de ellos, hablando en nombre de los demás, decía así: ??Qué quieres preguntar y saber de nosotros? Estamos  dispuestos a morir antes que violar las leyes de nuestros padres.?<br>  3El rey, fuera de sí, ordenó poner al fuego sartenes y calderas.<br>  4En cuanto estuvieron al rojo, mandó cortar la lengua al que había hablado en nombre de los demás, arrancarle el cuero cabelludo y cortarle las extremidades de los miembros, en presencia de sus demás hermanos y de su madre.<br>  5Cuando quedó totalmente inutilizado, pero respirando todavía, mandó que le acercaran al fuego y le tostaran en la sartén. Mientras el humo de la sartén se difundía lejos, los demás hermanos junto con su madre se animaban  mutuamente a morir con generosidad, y decían:<br>  6?El Se?or Dios vela y con toda seguridad se apiadará de nosotros, como declaró Moisés en el cántico que atestigua  claramente: "Se apiadará de sus siervos".?<br>  7Cuando el primero hizo así su tránsito, llevaron al segundo al suplicio y después de arrancarle la piel de la cabeza con los cabellos, le preguntaban: ??Vas a comer antes de que tu cuerpo sea torturado miembro a miembro??<br>  8El respondiendo en su lenguaje patrio, dijo: ??No!? Por ello, también éste sufrió a su vez la tortura, como el primero.<br>  9Al llegar a su último suspiro dijo: ?Tú, criminal, nos privas de la vida presente, pero el Rey del mundo a nosotros que morimos por sus leyes, nos resucitará a una vida eterna.?<br>  10Después de éste, fue castigado el tercero; en cuanto se lo pidieron, presentó la lengua, tendió decidido las manos<br>  11(y dijo con valentía: ?Por don del Cielo poseo estos miembros, por sus leyes los desde?o y de El espero recibirlos de nuevo).?<br>  12Hasta el punto de que el rey y sus acompa?antes estaban sorprendidos del ánimo de aquel muchacho que en nada tenía los dolores.<br>  13Llegado éste a su tránsito, maltrataron de igual modo con suplicios al cuarto.<br>  14Cerca ya del fin decía así: ?Es preferible morir a manos de hombres con la esperanza que Dios otorga de ser resucitados de nuevo por él; para ti, en cambio, no habrá resurrección a la vida.?<br>  15Enseguida llevaron al quinto y se pusieron a atormentarle.<br>  16El, mirando al rey, dijo: ?Tú, porque tienes poder entre los hombres aunque eres mortal, haces lo que quieres.  Pero no creas que Dios ha abandonado a nuestra raza.<br>  17Aguarda tú y contemplarás su magnifico poder, cómo te atormentará a ti y a tu linaje.?<br>  <br>  Resurrección, juicio, cielo, infierno, premio, castigo... para este momento ya estaba toda la doctrina en claro.|`|30ae8d0ad22d3c3688372363a60305dbaa	No, no existía, estaban a la espera pero para ellos aún no llegó el esperado Mesías..|`|58f011afb8f785955b41c1f08e0568f6aa	No había salvación. El hombre había caído en desgracia delante de su Creador.  La tierra se convirtió en la cárcel del alma humana. Dios, en un momento de angustia, dijo a sus discípulos, con la cuales había creado estre estado de cosas: "me arrepiento de haber creado al hombre"<br>  <br>  Pero por ser su alma altamente misercordiosa, quiso justificar la traición de su hijo Adán y tomó la condición   humana a fin de conocer nuestra naturaleza y  poder hacer un juicio netamente humano, y  creó la ley del perdón. (borrón y cuenta nueva) y Dios nos adoptó como hijos del cielo y abolió la ley del talión. con la cual no había salvación posible.  Tal vez había algunos galardones temporales para los que respetaran la ley y la cumpliran a medias, pero no había forma de salir de este estado de cosas a través de la reencarnación.  El que reencarna no se ha acogido a la ley del perdon y cuenta nueva, y sigue repitiendo sus errores una y otra vez. Como ves, querida hijita de Dios, la doctrina cristiana es un catalogo de salvacion. Ya no hay ley.

Seriously. Let's not judge Him if you're not willing to bear the mantle yourself. I think the single most difficult thing Jesus asks His followers to do is to love their enemies--and even pray for them. <br>  <br>  Sin is disobedience to God and He takes it very seriously as you would if it were you who were the One creating the universe and your children did these awful, disrespectful things to you. <br>  <br>  Sin is not a game. It requires a blood payment. One sin is enough to eternally separate yourself from God. Why? Because our holy God cannot look upon sin. Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden because they did not trust God's word, but willfully listened to Satan. That was the original sin. With that one sin, all mankind, and creation, is cursed with sin. <br>  __________________<br>  <br>  Genesis 3:<br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203;&version=31;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  <br>  Romans 6:23 (NIV)<br>  23For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>  <br>  Romans 3:23 (NIV)<br>  23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,<br>  <br>  John 3:16-20 (NIV)<br>   16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. 19This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email me. |`|SPef3Mpcaa	It wouldn't bring money, political power and young women/boys to the priests (pastors, elders, clerics, call'em what you like.

Se sabe, además, que había conexiones entre Al Qaeda y otros grupos terroristas y el gobierno iraquí).

Ainsi, il s'agit certainement d'un rapprochement entre ces deux expressions, comme si on pouvait s'acheter de beaux vêtements et donc être bien habillé grace aux "épingles" que l'on avait mis de c?té.|`|ad4aec9cc7cea87f499eeeb770277104aa	Hehehe !<br>  <br>  Cela vient des entomologistes, ces personnes qui collectionnent et répertorient les papillons...

Algo de verdad hay cuando halbas de una herramienta para ense?ar- Cuando vas a 1er grado, la maestra no te ense?a ni raiz cuadrada ni calculos logaritmiscos, sino que te explica con animalitos de colores los numeros. Esto no quiere decir que te mienta, sino que adapata la ense?anza a tu nivel de comprension. En el caso del Genesis, es un eror garrafal, fanatico e infantil, tomarlo literlamente.<br>  El Genesis fue escrito a traves de una vision que tuvo Moises (llamado Moshé en verdad, pues no existia el nombre Moises, ni Jesus,  ni Maria). A traves de esa vision que le fue revelada a este ser, vio de un pantallazo el proceso de separacion, combinacion, fusion y fision de los elementos naturales por las energias de la creacion.<br>  Anteriormente a Adan y Eva (cuyo nombre era  Adamú y Evana) hubo otras humanidades, de dsitnta evolucion. Fue en el tiempo en que existieron continentes hoy desaparecidos o fragmentados, como la Atlantida y Lemuria, a cuyo descubrimiento apenas asoma la ciencia<br>  Aun asi, yo creo que no es todo ni tan tan ni muy muy. Ni la ciencia esta del todo en lo cierto, ni las antiguas creencias del todo equivocadas. Y te lo digo como creyente, pues me encanta cuando la ciencia da un paso, y se acerca la verdad. Yo mismo te desmiento la literalidad de la Biblia, y ya explique el porque, mas alla de que fue manoseada por intereses politicos y religiosos segun conveniencia, tambien como la ciencia maeja cosas horripilantes, como la cura que frena contra el cancer y miles de cosas que no prosperan porque aun producen un redito impresionante<br>  Pero se trata de aunar verdades hasta llegar a la Verdad unica, no de disputarnos en batallas inutiles a ver quien tiene razon. Es tan bueno hablar de par a par, mas alla de cualquier creencia, trascendiendo toda frontera mental, para intentar vislumbrar la verdad con todos los puntos posibles de vista!<br>  Te invito a que lo intentemos.

Durante el parto, el feto a término tiene que atravesar la parte inferior de la pelvis (conocida como pelvis menor o verdadera) por un conducto de paredes óseas que recibe el nombre de cavidad pélvica o canal del parto. Entre los chimpancés, gorilas y orangutanes el parto es fácil y rápido, porque el canal del parto es grande en relación con el tama?o de la cabeza del feto. En estos monos antropomorfos la entrada al canal del parto (llamada estrecho superior o entrada de la pelvis) tiene forma ovala-da, con su diámetro mayor dirigido de delante hacia atrás (orienta-ción sagital o anteroposterior, se dice en anatomía), y su diámetro menor orientado transversalmente (de lado a lado). Como hemos visto, la modificación de la arquitectura de la pelvis necesaria para hacer posible la locomoción erguida aproximó las articulaciones del hueso coxal con la columna vertebral y con el fémur; en consecuen-cia, se acortó el diámetro sagital del canal del parto, y ésta es la causa de que existan complicaciones para dar a luz en nuestra especie.<br>  <br>  En las mujeres la entrada al canal del parto no tiene forma ovala-da, sino que es más bien redondeada El diámetro máximo del estrecho superior no es el sagital, sino en ocasiones el transversal y las más de las veces ni el sagital ni el transversal, sino los dos diámetros oblicuos o diagonales. Por otro lado, la cabeza del feto a término es alargada, es decir, que su máximo diámetro es el antero-posterior (de la frente a la nuca). La posición de la cabeza del feto se acomoda al mayor de los diámetros del estrecho superior; es decir, generalmente a cualquiera de los dos oblicuos. Como la mayor dimensión a la salida del canal de parto es siempre la sagital (en los humanos y en los demás primates), el cráneo y los hombros del feto humano tienen que entrar en el canal del parto con una orientación (transversal u oblicua) y salir con otra (sagital). O sea, que hay una rotación dentro del canal del parto tanto de la cabeza como, más tar-de, de los hombros <br>  Para complicar más las cosas, en nuestra especie la vagina está dirigida hacia delante, formando un ángulo recto con el útero, por lo que el feto a término al pasar por el canal del parto no describe una trayectoria rectilínea, sino una curva muy pronunciada que termina inmediatamente por debajo del hueso púbico, por donde emerge la cabeza del neonato. Para acomodarse a esa trayectoria curva, la columna vertebral del feto se arquea, flexionándose mucho la cabeza hacia la espalda y presentando al nacer la coronilla, es decir, con la cara mirando hacia atrás (en sentido contrario a la madre). En las hembras de los demás primates la vagina tiene la misma dirección que el útero, con el que está alineado, y el feto a término describe en el parto una trayectoria recta dirigida hacia atrás; por otro lado la cara del neonato mira hacia delante (en el mismo sentido que la madre). En resumen, el parto en nuestra especie es ventral, y en el resto de los primates el parto es dorsal.<br>  <br>  Karen Rosenberg y Wenda Trevathan han llamado la atención sobre el hecho de que entre los simios la madre puede ayudar a nacer a su hijo, guiándolo en el parto con las manos, limpiándole la nariz y la boca para que pueda respirar mejor y liberándolo del cordón umbilical si es que éste se le enreda alrededor del cuello. El parto en los primates es un hecho solitario, sin ayuda ajena. Sin embargo, en nuestra especie la madre no puede ver la cara del neonato porque éste mira en dirección contraria, y cualquier intento de tirar de él podría, dada la posición de extrema flexión dorsal de la cabeza, ocasionarle da?os en la médula espinal. Eso hace que en todas las culturas las mujeres busquen asistencia en el momento del parto; el parto huma-no es una actividad social, más que un comportamiento solitario.""<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>   ESTO ES CIENCIA Y LO PUEDES PREGUNTAR A UN DOCTOR , A UN ZOOLOGISTA O A UN VETERINARIO , CUANDO RESOLVAMOS ESTE Y MUCHOS MAS FACTORES LA EVOLUCION DEJA RA DE SER UNA TEORIA CONSTRUCIONISTA , COMO EL ARTICULO QUE PRESENTA QUE ESTA COMPLEMENTADO CON EL CONSTRUCIONISMO IMAGINATIVO  PARA COMPLETAR <br>  LAS FASES NO VERIFICADAS ..<br>  SALUDOS Y ESPERO QUE TE SIRVA DE ALGO ESTO LO QUE DA MUCHO  DOLOR EN EL  VIENTRE  A Richard Dawkins , <br>  no poder probar su teoria evolucionista solo le queda <br>  burlarse de los cristianos........<br>  <br>  Regrese para agregarte algo mas , <br>  entonces la genetica moderna tambien es muy ingenua <br>  ellos han descubierto una EVA MITOCONDRIAL<br>  Y AL MENOS UN ADAM CROMOSONAL PADRE DE UNOS CUANTOS DISPERSO EN TODA LA ESPECIE HUMANA COMO EXPLICACION SUGIEREN QUE LA ESPECIE HUMANA ES DESCENDIENTE DE UN MINUSCULO GRUPO DE SOBREVIVIENTES .......|`|9c6a1fb40ea5f1515d133342cdffeba6aa	Lo primero que debes saber que son las parabolas y que significan, principalmente porque lo de Adan y Eva es una cosa asi, te explico.<br>  La iglesia a empezado a pensar en la evolución desde hace mucho tiempo, y hace ya mucho que ha aceptado que venimos de la evolución, pero te dice una cosa clara...<br>  Como se formo o quien formo el big ban? la iglesia crees en la evolución a partir del big ban, suerte!!!|`|Ns0Ga3qhaa	nooo.... adan y eva no es que si creas o no solo es una forma metaforica de explicar el comienzo de la vida y esto lo puedes comprobar ya que viene en la biblia|`|O6HJYVoQaa	Creen en dios y en la ciencia pero ve a los fuentes científicas no a este tipo de paginas que solo manipulan este tipo de teorías creando mayor ignorancia entre nosotros.<br>  <br>  Todavía no se comprueba el salto evolutivo del homosapiens eso es científicamente imposible antes se buscaba al eslabón perdido, ahora la ciencia busca otras teoría, por que aun no se sabe la verdad absoluta.  la biblia solo no narra la historia de manera que a su nivel ellos la entendían. nosotros sabemos un poco mas de cosas y tal vez llegue el momento en donde la biblia y la ciencia logren empatar, pero hasta entonces sigue leyendo de todos los descubrimientos que se hace y maravilla te de la grandesa y complejidad de Dios en cada un de estos, por una cosa es cierta ningún científico que haga ciencia te puede negar la existencia de Dios Tal vez mucho crean y otros tanto no pero nadie ha podido comprobar que no existe, por que a medida aclaran algo salen mil dudas mas y otras teorías que antes eran verdades se desechan.. y a la verdad que ellos intentan llegar es lo que nosotros llamamos Dios.|`|OhLg9m91aa	Acaso no es más primitivo pensar que vinimos de primitivos primates, que creer que somos hijos de seres pensantes e intelectualmente iguales a nosotros?|`|cEa3jNhoaa	Gracias por contestar amigo jotaviz el que mas sabe de los monos  es usted .|`|p1OPY4yzaa	Yo soy creyente.<br>  Como alguien bien ha dicho, es un error interpretar literalmente el relato del Génesis...<br>  Pero, como la pregunta va de invenciones... pasemos a la teoria de la evolución.

Bravo, han descubierto que una serie de gases sometidas a descargas producen moléculas orgánicas, pero no han demostrado las características de ese planeta Tierra en sus primeros momentos (alguno me podrá discutir mi conclusión, pero mi explicación también es lógica).<br>  Cuando se sigue desarrollando dicha teoría, muchos pasos se supone como han sido y no me lo invento.

Depuis un certain temps maintenant, dans un effort vers plus de précision et plus de concision, j’ai essayé de mettre par écrit d’une fa?on systématique toutes les vérités philosophiques qui, selon moi, peuvent être confirmées sans le moindre doute. Au cours de cet effort de réflexion, une vue s’imposait à mon analyse: le fait que l’attitude typique d’un agnostique n’est pas une attitude intelligente. C’est à dire, que l’homme ne peut simplement pas échapper à une obligation de croire; de croire en l’évidence qu’un acte créateur soit à l’origine de tout ce qui existe autour de nous; que l’Islam est la conception qui concrétise la plus grande harmonie avec notre réalité en général. Ainsi j’ai commencé, non sans choc et surprise, pas à pas, malgré moi et mes préjugés, et presque inconsciemment, à ressentir et penser que je devenais Musulman. Seul un dernier acte devait être entrepris : formaliser ma conversion. Depuis, aujourd’hui je suis Musulman.

Des gens qui observaient et croyaient fermement en une certaine base morale. Cependant ils rejetaient tout lien entre l’éthique, la morale donc, et la théologie. L’autorité des Lois et Morales Musulmanes procède de Dieu l’Omnipotent. Le plaisir et le bonheur dans l’Islam ne sont que les fruits produits par une satisfaction émotionnelle dans l’exécution consciencieuse de ses devoirs pour le seul plaisir de Dieu, afin d’atteindre, ainsi, le salut. En Islam, les devoirs s’élèvent toujours au-dessus des droits. C’est seul dans l’Islam que ma quête des valeurs absolues fut satisfaite.

Les statistiques de 1973 indiquaient que la population musulmane mondiale était alors estimée à 500 millions d'individus, la barre des 1,5 milliards a aujourd'hui été franchie. Et une personne sur quatre est de confession musulmane. Vraisemblablement, la population musulmane va continuer d'augmenter et l'Islam deviendra la religion la plus répandue dans le monde. La raison de cet essor n'est pas seulement due à l'augmentation de la population dans les pays musulmans, elle est également due au nombre sans cesse croissant de personnes qui se tournent vers la religion musulmane, phénomène qui s'est particulièrement amplifié depuis le 11 septembre 2001, jour de l'attaque des tours jumelles du "World Trade Center" à New York . Déplorées par tous et avant tout par les musulmans, ces attaques ont soudain focalisé l'attention du monde (notamment des états-Unis) sur la population musulmane. Les Occidentaux épiloguent sans fin sur la nature même de la religion musulmane, les écrits coraniques, les obligations que nécessitent la pratique de cette religion ainsi que le comportement quotidien du musulman. Ces réflexions ont naturellement contribué à faire augmenter le nombre de convertis à cette religion dans le monde. Ainsi, la prédiction communément entendue après le 11/09 selon laquelle "cette attaque changera le cours de l'histoire mondiale" est devenue d'une certaine fa?on réalité. Le retour aux valeurs religieuses et spirituelles que le monde vit depuis longtemps, se traduit aujourd'hui par une augmentation du nombre de personnes se tournant vers l'Islam. <br>  <br>  La nature extraordinaire des événements actuels peut être per?ue, à travers l'évolution de ce mouvement, dont les médias, les premiers, se sont fait l'écho. Ces faits généralement relativisés et décrits comme un simple engouement du moment, sont en réalité des signes avant-coureurs du rayonnement des valeurs de l'Islam à travers le monde. Comme partout ailleurs, l'Islam conna?t, également en Europe, une croissance remarquable. Cette expansion a suscité ces dernières années, un vif intérêt: les nombreuses thèses, reportages et autres articles publiés sur "la place des musulmans en Europe", "le dialogue entre la société européenne et les musulmans" le prouvent. Outre ces thèses universitaires, les médias ont fréquemment diffusé des reportages sur l'Islam et les musulmans. Les raisons de cet intérêt sont liées à la croissance régulière de la population de confession musulmane en Europe, mais cette hausse ne peut être attribuée in extenso à l'immigration. L'immigration a certainement eu un impact important sur la croissance de la population musulmane, de nombreux chercheurs ont déterminé que cette expansion est également due à un tout autre facteur: le taux élevé de conversions à l'Islam. Le 20 juin 2004, le reportage diffusé sur la cha?ne de télévision NTV intitulé "L'Islam, la religion dont la croissance est la plus forte en Europe" s'appuyait sur un rapport des services fran?ais. Celui-ci mentionnait que le nombre de personnes converties à l'Islam dans les pays occidentaux était toujours en augmentation, particulièrement après le 11/09. En France par exemple, le nombre de personnes converties à l'Islam est passé l'année dernière, de 30.000 à 40.000 environ. <br>  <br>  <br>  Des études à ce sujet ont également mis en évidence que malgré la croissance continue de la population de confession musulmane en Europe, ce développement s'accompagne d'une prise de conscience religieuse ainsi que d'une pratique accrue. Selon une enquête d'octobre 2001 du journal fran?ais Le Monde et comparativement aux informations collectées en 1994, de nombreux musulmans pratiquent aujourd'hui encore prières, fréquentent les mosquées etc. Cette ferveur est beaucoup plus manifeste chez les étudiants universitaires. <br>  <br>  En 1999, dans un reportage qui se basait sur la presse étrangère, le magazine turc Aktüel indiquait que les chercheurs occidentaux ont évalué que dans les 50 prochaines années, l'Europe deviendra l'un des principaux lieux d'expansion de l'Islam. <br>  <br>  <br>  à travers des études sociologiques et démographiques, nous ne devons pas non plus oublier que la découverte de l'Islam par l'Europe n'est pas un fait nouveau et que l'Islam fait en réalité partie intégrante de l'Europe. <br>  <br>  Durant des siècles, l'Europe et le monde musulman ont entretenu d'étroites relations. Dans un premier temps, l'état d'Andalousie (756-1492) dans la péninsule ibérique, puis les Croisades (1095-1291) et la capture ottomane des Balkans (1389), tous ces événements ont provoqué des échanges réguliers entre ces deux mondes. De nombreux historiens et sociologues affirment aujourd'hui, que l'Islam a été à l'origine du passage d'une Europe sombre moyenageuse à une Europe brillante en pleine Renaissance. à cette époque, l'Europe accusait un retard sérieux dans les domaines de la médecine, de l'astronomie, des mathématiques et dans bien d'autres disciplines, alors que les musulmans possédaient déjà un fabuleux trésor de connaissances ainsi que de vastes moyens de développement. <br>  <br>  Le développement de l'Islam s'exprime également dans la récente intensification du dialogue interreligieux. Tout a commencé par l'affirmation que les trois religions monothéistes ont la même origine et peuvent par conséquent se rejoindre sur un point commun. Ces échanges ont été couronnés de succès et ont de ce fait suscité d'importants rapprochements, en particulier entre les chrétiens et les musulmans. Dans le Coran, Dieu nous informe que les musulmans invitent les gens du Livre (chrétiens et juifs) à s'unir avec un objectif commun: <br>  <br>  Dis: "O gens du Livre, venez à une parole commune entre nous et vous: que nous n'adorions qu'Allah, sans rien Lui associer, et que nous ne prenions point les uns les autres pour seigneurs en dehors d'Allah". S'ils tournent le dos, dites: "Soyez témoins que nous, nous sommes soumis". (Coran, 3: 64) <br>  <br>  Les trois religions monothéistes ont des croyances et des valeurs morales communes. La croyance en l'existence d'un Dieu unique, des anges, des Prophètes, du jour dernier, du paradis et de l'enfer constitue les principes de base de leur foi. En outre, le dévouement, l'humilité, l'amour, la tolérance, le respect, la miséricorde, l'honnêteté, le fait d'éviter tout acte de transgressions et d'être injuste et agir en toute conscience, sont des valeurs morales communément partagées. étant donné que ces trois religions sont fondées sur les mêmes bases morales, elles se doivent d'?uvrer ensemble à l'éradication de toutes dissensions, conflits et souffrances provoqués par les idéologies agnostiques. Si ce point de vue est pris en compte, le dialogue interreligieux prend soudain une importance accrue. Séminaires et conférences qui réunissent les représentants de ces religions, les messages de paix et de fraternité qui en découlent, se succèdent à intervalles réguliers depuis le milieu des années 90. <br>  <br>  Une fois ces éléments réunis, ils révèleront un mouvement d'envergure vers l'Islam dans de nombreux pays, l'Islam est sur le point de devenir le sujet le plus important pour l'humanité. Ces évolutions montrent que le monde est en marche vers une ère totalement nouvelle, période au cours de laquelle, par la volonté de Dieu, l'Islam gagnera en importance et les enseignements coraniques se répandront comme la bonne nouvelle. Il est essentiel de prendre conscience que cette expansion significative était déjà annoncée il y a quatorze siècles dans le Coran: <br>  <br>  Ils veulent éteindre avec leurs bouches la lumière d'Allah, alors qu'Allah ne veut que parachever Sa lumière, quelque répulsion qu'en aient les mécréants. C'est Lui qui a envoyé Son messager avec la bonne direction et la religion de la vérité, afin qu'elle triomphe sur toute autre religion, quelque répulsion qu'en aient les associateurs. (Coran, 9: 32-33) <br>  <br>  L'expansion des valeurs morales de l'Islam est une promesse que Dieu a faite aux croyants. En plus de ces versets, de nombreux hadiths (propos) de notre Prophète (paix et bénédiction sur lui) affirment que les valeurs morales du Coran prévaudront. Quelques jours avant la fin du monde, l'humanité vivra une période où méfaits, injustice, mauvaise foi, fraudes, guerres, dissensions, conflits et dégénérescence morale seront largement répandus. Ensuite arrivera l'Age d'or au cours duquel les enseignements moraux commenceront à se propager parmi la population comme la marée montante et finalement ils prévaudront dans le monde. Vous trouverez ci-après quelques-uns de ces propos commentés: <br>  <br>  Durant celle-ci [période], ma Oummah [peuple] mènera une vie douce et sans souci, vie jamais vécue auparavant. [La terre] produira des récoltes abondantes sans en retenir de tribut, les biens seront alors pléthores. (Sunan Ibn-i Majah) <br>  <br>  … Les habitants des cieux et de la terre seront satisfaits. La terre donnera tout ce qui pousse et les cieux déverseront de la pluie en abondance. Depuis tous les biens que Dieu accordera aux habitants de la terre, les vivants souhaiteront que les morts reviennent à la vie une fois de plus. (Muhkhtasar Tazkirah Qurtubi, p. 437) <br>  <br>  La surface de la terre sera semblable à un plateau d'argent où pousse une végétation luxuriante… (Sunan Ibn-i Majah) <br>  <br>  La terre ne sera qu'équité et justice alors qu'elle était auparavant sous l'oppression et la tyrannie. (Abu Dawud) <br>  <br>  La justice régnera à un tel point que tout bien pris par la force retournera à son propriétaire; en outre, le bien d'une autre personne quand bien même elle commence à en bénéficier, sera rendu à son propriétaire… La sécurité régnera sur la terre entière et même quelques femmes pourront accomplir le hadj (le grand pèlerinage) sans être accompagnées d'un homme. (Ibn Hajar al-Haythami, Al-Qawl al-Mukhtasar, p. 23) <br>  <br>  Conformément à ces révélations, l'age d'or sera une période où régneront dans le monde, justice, abondance, profusion, bien-être, sécurité, paix et fraternité, période durant laquelle chacun éprouvera également envers son prochain, amour, don de soi, tolérance, compassion, miséricorde et loyauté. <br>  <br>  La forte expansion mondiale de l'Islam observée de nos jours, , sont autant de signes annonciateurs de l'imminence de cette période annoncée dans le Coran et dans les hadiths de notre Prophète. Notre souhait le plus cher est que Dieu fasse que nous soyons les témoins de cette époque bénie.|`|84e58e7fb6118b61a7474785daabbaa3aa	Faut-il vraiment refaire ici l'histoire de l'islam et de son expansion pacifique qui commence avec la prise par les armes de la Mecque, en passant par les batailles de Uhud (625), Badr (624), Yarmouk (636), Qidisiyya (637), Nehavend (642), Rey (643), du Chameau (656), de Siffin (657), Mardj Rahit (684), Tahuda (683), les attaques navales contre l'empire bizantin (669, 674 et 717), batailles de Poitiers (732), du Grand Zab (749), du Talas (751), Tobna (771), les attaques sur Malte (870), Palerme (831), Syracuse (878), Rome (846), la Gare-Frenet (890-973), Crète (825), ...

AA12275254	Ballet is the 'romantic' dance form that arose from the courts of European kings.<br>  <br>  Its whole image is softer and more gentle than most other things in the world.<br>  <br>  The ballet world is dominated by the presence of women and its public image is feminine.  But being a romantic dance form it needs the presence of both men and women to create the storied that the dance portrays.<br>  <br>  The stereotype exists because some men who dance ballet, are living and working on a perceived female world.  Its every bit as athletics football which is very masculine.<br>  <br>  Our leading Australian male dancer is not gay.  He is gifted, talented and married happily and has wonderful children.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	TV...|`|LURqbzoZaa	Hmm. I guess because most ballet dancers are girls.

U39tACbHaa	From my humble Christian perspective:<br>  <br>  I believe that verse speaks of his miracles.

No need to add extra books or extra words.|`|cVPq3s9zaa	Paul said to hold fast to what had been taught whether by word or by letter.<br>  <br>  He also said to hold fast to tradition.<br>  <br>  <br>  And btw, sola scriptura isn't supported by the Bible.  That doctrine was created by protestants 1600+ years after Christ.  A doctrine which is self-refuting, since scripture doesn't support "scripture alone."|`|WUwdDxWMaa	Never question catholics|`|XnAq9rd5aa	Because the gospels were not written as the events were happening. it wasn't like a reporter was standing there writing everything down. These are the three steps of the Gospels being written:<br>  1. Jesus life and teachings:<br>      Jesus lived, everyone watched his teachings, etc.<br>  2. Oral tradition.<br>      People started talking about what Jesus was doing, especially after his death. Things started getting told incorrectly and forgetting exactly how things happened. Stories started getting a bit messed up.<br>  3. Followers intent on preserving tradition wrote it all down.<br>  The reason they started writing it down was because it was getting told incorrectly and they wanted true sources for what happened and for Jesus' teachings. Also because the people were starting to forget what was happening. They wrote it down long after all this happened, partially because they thought that Jesus' second coming was going to be within their life time! So they didn't see a point in writing it down. Then he didn't come right away and they thought maybe it would be a good idea to write it.<br>  <br>  It is almost for sure that the Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John did not write the gospels that bear their names. For one, they would have been REALLY old. Also, that's just how people back then wrote things. It was a custom to say someone you respected wrote something you were writing to pay them respect. Also, to get more attention to the writings by using apostle's names.<br>  For example, it is debatable whether King David wrote all the psalms that bear his name or if some of them were written by others and but claim to be by him because they respected and admired him him and that is something they did to show their respect and admiration. A lot of the time back then people wrote things under other people's names for that reason and also so that people would read them because it had an important person's name on it.<br>  <br>  This isn't so much something that we read in the Bible but something that historically just makes sense.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  Katie|`|5512018d53cae3a1c939ecb7fdca2d55aa	I am not Catholic but I believe there are many more things that we could learn from the life of Christ.

oUNBdN87aa	It is nice to feel you have a purpose. I do not have this feeling. I let it fall from me, with many other unnecessary opinions.

I told him, no, that was an incorrect generalization because my assumption was I would find the whole thing very dull--no matter how good it was, I would get bored before a few millenia were passed.<br>  <br>  However, since then, I've begun to wonder how much of my mortal life might be led in fear of boredom.  I realized that desiring to live forever is actually a good thing.  <br>  <br>  Saying I didn't want to live forever was like saying that I didn't believe there was anything worth living forever for!  I realized that desiring to live forever made me a better person in some ways, whether or not I really factually believe I will.<br>  <br>  I'm not really bothered by the thought of dying, but I would rather not die in a parking garage.|`|1BXHUjqIaa	Not afraid at all.

Spiritual (soul) death. If and when mortal man has finally rejected survival, when he has been pronounced spiritually insolvent, morontially bankrupt, in the conjoint opinion of the Spirit and the surviving seraphim, when such co-ordinate advice has been recorded and after the Censors and their reflective associates have verified these findings, thereupon do the rulers order the immediate release of the indwelling Monitor. But this release of the Spirits in no way affects the duties of the personal or group seraphim concerned with that Spirit-abandoned individual. This kind of death is final in its significance irrespective of the temporary continuation of the living energies of the physical and mind mechanisms. From the cosmic standpoint the mortal is already dead; the continuing life merely indicates the persistence of the material momentum of cosmic energies.<br>  <br>  2. Intellectual (mind) death. When the vital circuits of higher adjutant ministry are disrupted through the aberrations of intellect or because of the partial destruction of the mechanism of the brain, and if these conditions pass a certain critical point of irreparability, the indwelling Adjuster is immediately released to depart for Divinington. On the universe records a mortal personality is considered to have met with death whenever the essential mind circuits of human will-action have been destroyed. And again, this is death, irrespective of the continuing function of the living mechanism of the physical body. The body minus the volitional mind is no longer human, but according to the prior choosing of the human will, the soul of such an individual may survive.<br>  <br>  3. Physical (body and mind) death. When death overtakes a human being, the Spirit remains in the citadel of the mind until it ceases to function as an intelligent mechanism, about the time that the measurable brain energies cease their rhythmic vital pulsations. Following this dissolution the Spirit takes leave of the vanishing mind, just as unceremoniously as entry was made years before. <br>  <br>  After death the material body returns to the elemental world from which it was derived, but two nonmaterial factors of surviving personality persist: The pre-existent Spirit, with the memory transcription of the mortal career,  and there also remains, in the custody of the destiny guardian, the immortal soul of the deceased human. These phases and forms of soul, these once kinetic but now static formulas of identity, are essential to repersonalization on the next Spirit worlds; and it is the reunion of the Spirit and the soul that reassembles the surviving personality, that reconsciousizes you at the time of the morontia awakening.<br>  <br>  For those who do not have personal seraphic guardians, the group custodians faithfully and efficiently perform the same service of identity safekeeping and personality resurrection. The seraphim are indispensable to the reassembly of personality.<br>  <br>  Upon death the Thought Spirit temporarily loses personality, but not identity; the human subject temporarily loses identity, but not personality; on the mansion worlds both reunite in eternal manifestation. Never does a departed Spirit return to earth as the being of former indwelling; never is personality manifested without the human will; and never does a dis-Spirited human being after death manifest active identity or in any manner establish communication with the living beings of earth. Such dis-Adjustered souls are wholly and absolutely unconscious during the long or short sleep of death. There can be no exhibition of any sort of personality or ability to engage in communications with other personalities until after completion of survival. Those who go to the Spirit worlds are not permitted to send messages back to their loved ones. It is the policy throughout the universes to forbid such communication during the period of a current dispensation.  |`|AA11017058	If we didnt why do we go to the doctor take care of our health.<br>  <br>  Everyone fears death even people going to Heaven dont want to die to get there.|`|1f373b1b8e8cf826cc8854c24e102f8eaa	I'm not afraid of death.

XagdEMnraa	Alpha could be held in a very thin container. Wrapped in paper would suffice to stop the radiation. The danger with alpha sources is that if you ingest them, you are irradiated from the inside. Alpha particles are stopped by a thin sheet of paper or the outer layer of dead skin.<br>  <br>  Beta would require a few millimetres of aluminium to contain the radiation. Being in close proximity to a beta source may be harmful because they can penetrate some way into the body.<br>  <br>  Gamma would need a box lined with very thick lead. Because gamma waves are so small, they can get through sub-atomic spaces and only large amounts of very dense material like lead can stop them. They pose a serious risk if they penetrate body tissues because they are high energy and very ionising.|`|J7ZZL1bCaa	Why is this in 'languages'?...Anyhow, you'd have to carry them in a lead-lined box with a 'radiation' sign on it.
aWHvHIr1aa	The wsidr or what should I do right is everything.  But you will only know what is right if the one who made you tells you.  <br>  <br>  Obviously, if dust made you and you are going to return to dust it really doesn't matter what you do or how long you do it as the results are the same....dust.<br>  <br>  But if God created you, He separated right from wrong as He separated light from darkness.  This is because whatever reason He made you is now right and everything else is now wrong.<br>  <br>  So as soon as you hear, "right" know that this is a theist position and only theist can define what right is.
s5ZJHJtqaa	Nope, i doubt it, but the Lack of a belly-button would be one of the biggest tourist attractions in the pre-Flood world. :) as the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren would come up and say, “Why don't you have a belly-button?”<br>  <br>  They could then use the opportunity to recount, to generation after generation, how God had created them specially by completed supernatural acts, as a testament to His creativity. :)<br>  |`|d6flDFGPaa	God could have created them with belly buttons though they certainly wouldn't have needed them.<br>  <br>  However, like authors create histories for their novels, I believe there is a strong possibility that God created everything with a presumed history (such as light already on its way from stars) so it wouldn't make sense to not put belly buttons on people.|`|J88wE7fsaa	Adam was Intelligently-Designed/evolved from dust, and Eve came from Adam's rib, right?

I live in California--Spanish and Asian languages (Japanese, Chinese, Korean) are most useful for jobs here.

7JIhZ0R0aa	The devotion to Our Lady of America has its source in private revelations to Sister Mary Ephrem (baptized Mildred) Neuzil, who was born in 1916 and was professed, in 1933, in the Congregation of the Sisters of the Most Precious Blood of Jesus, which has its generalate in Dayton, Ohio. She later became part of a contemplative branch of the same congregation. The contemplative branch was located at Our Lady of the Nativity Convent at New Riegel, Ohio. After the suppression of the contemplative branch in 1979, the Sisters who were members took up residence in Seneca County, Ohio. From the time of the suppression, Sister Mary Ephrem used her baptismal name, Sister Mary Mildred Neuzil. Sister Mary Ephrem (Mary Mildred) died in 2000. One of the Sisters survives and continues to live in Seneca County, Ohio.<br>  Having reviewed the correspondence between Sister Mary Ephrem and her spiritual director of many years, Monsignor Paul F. Leibold, Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, who later became the Bishop of Evansville and, then, Archbishop of Cincinnati, it is clear that the devotion, as proposed by Sister Mary Ephrem, received his approbation. In addition to the correspondence by which Monsignor Leibold declared the approval of the devotion, he also carried out the first of Our Lady of America's requests, made through Sister Mary Ephrem, namely, he had a medal struck with the image of Our Lady of America on one side and the coat of arms of the Christian family on the other.<br>  The coat of arms symbolically represents the substance of the private revelation received by Sister Mary Ephrem, namely, the Indwelling of the Holy Trinity in the Christian home, which is the source of life and unity in the family. The coat of arms points to the purity and selflessness of love in the family, because of the Indwelling of the Holy Trinity, the model of which is the Mother of God, under her title of the Immaculate Conception, patroness of our nation. In a particular way, Our Lady of America expressed her desire that the United States of America, through her intercession, be devoted to the purity of love. She identified herself to Sister Mary Ephrem as "Our Lady of America, The Immaculate Virgin." In the consecration of our nation to our Blessed Mother, made in 1959 at the National Shrine and renewed, in our name, by Bishop David Ricken on November 11, 2006, the Saturday before the November meeting of our Conference of Bishops, our Blessed Mother is addressed as "Immaculate Virgin."<br>  The contents of the private revelation received by Sister Mary Ephrem were published in a booklet, first in 1960, and, again, in 1971. Both of these editions were published with the Imprimatur of Archbishop Leibold. A final edition, with some new contents, was published in 1989. The new contents were added at the direction of Father Edmund Morman, S.V.D., the last chaplain of Our Lady of the Nativity Convent at New Riegel. Father Morman was sadly killed in an automobile accident on February 17, 1986.<br>  <br>  A specific request of Our Lady of America was that her statue be placed in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. There is a providential connection between Sister Mary Ephrem and the late Archbishop Bishop John Francis Noll of the Diocese of Fort Wayne, who is celebrated as the Apostle of the National Shrine. The principal apparitions of Our Lady of America to Sister Mary Ephrem took place in the chapel of the Precious Blood Sisters Convent in Kneipp Springs Sanitorium, near Rome City, Indiana. Archbishop Bishop Noll, who died in 1956, maintained a summer residence at the Sanitorium, within a few hundred feet of the place of the apparitions. While the National Shrine is the largest shrine in the world at which there was not a previous apparition, the private revelation to Sister Mary Ephrem very much confirms the mission of the National Shrine.<br>  The prayer attached to the devotion also received the imprimatur of the then Monsignor Leibold, Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. Archbishop Leibold was Sister Mary Ephrem's spiritual director from the time that he was Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati until he died in1972. Archbishop Leibold was always clear that the approved devotion had its origin in private revelation received by Sister Mary Ephrem over many years.<br>  What can be concluded canonically is that the devotion was both approved by Archbishop Leibold and, what is more, was actively promoted by him. In addition, over the years, other Bishops have approved the devotion and have participated in public devotion to the Mother of God, under the title of Our Lady of America.<br>  Although the devotion to Our Lady of America has remained constant over the years, in recent years the devotion has spread very much and has been embraced by many with special fervor. Seemingly, as has been suggested by Father Peter Damian Mary Fehlner, F.I., in his homily of August 5, 2006, at the Shrine of the Most Bles|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	from a google search (just look up "Our Lady, Empress of all of the Americas") its pretty clear the term refers to Our Lady of Guadalupe, which was a 16th century apparition.|`|iHmUcBY5aa	More than likely it was just a local church that is advertising on the billboard.<br>  <br>  And more than likely they just call her that name at that church.  |`|1OdNpbUkaa	Be carfull of Santamariea ,look it up ask your father|`|TcTYqw6faa	because her son is His Majesty|`|hyqf7xR0aa	I've never heard of such a thing before.

h5raW0o1aa	I understand the way you talk JRB.  I understand why you say things like they need to grow up and not ignorantly mock.  You say it because it hurts to see people dismiss God and our Lord Jesus who we faithfully serve everyday!  you use the word ignorant because that's how they present themselves to be.

Yea, thats the kind of loving God I can't wait to meet. I've read the most versions of the orthodox Christian bibles, the Nag Hammadi, the gnostic gospels. I've also read texts from hinduism, Taoism (love the Tao Te Ching), Judaism, etc... If I worried about every faith that condemed me to hell, I'd never get any sleep.<br>  <br>  It's funny. For those of us who don't assert a belief in your version God, we are pretty quickly condemed to hell. Gotta love those eastern religions, no Dante's Inferno with them. Yet most Christian sects are absurdly selective about the rules they follow. Hence, a lot of branches. I adore the figure of Jesus. He was such an amazing figure. That doesn't mean I believe he was right. <br>  <br>  And I'm very unconcerned with the (very selective) scripture you chose to quote. But let me share some of my favorite quotes:<br>  <br>  "I will call no being good who is not what I mean when I apply that epithet to my fellow creatures; and if such a creature can sentence me to hell for not so calling him, to hell I will go...A being who can create a race of men devoid of real freedom and inevitably foredoomed to be sinners, and then punish them for being what he has made them, may be omnipotent and various other things, but he is not what the English language has always intended by the adjective holy." John Stuart Mill, An Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy (1865), quoted from James A Haught, ed, 2000 Years of Disbelief<br>  <br>  “Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?<br>  Then he is not omnipotent.<br>  Is he able, but not willing?<br>  Then he is malevolent.<br>  Is he both able and willing?<br>  Then whence cometh evil?<br>  Is he neither able nor willing?<br>  Then why call him God?” <br>  Epicurus quotes (Greek philosopher, BC 341-270)|`|CBhGlZ2Baa	Then shouldnt you be worried that maybe any one of the other hundreds (and many older ones with more followers) of religions might be right and you might be pissing god off by following a false one?  I think if there is an all knowning omnipotent god and what not I dont believe that he would be so much as a dick as to do some of those things he says in the nastier parts of the bible. I think its best just to live my life to the best of my abilities and be as decently human as i can be follow my heart etc etc and i think we'll all be ok either way if we all just do that.|`|YmbMpS0caa	First, there is no evidence that God exists and nothing to suggest the Bible is anything more than a work of historical fiction (i.e. a work of fiction loosely based on some actual people, places, and events).<br>  <br>  Secondly, even if there is a deity, there is no guaranteeing that the Christian God is the correct God.  Do you ever get concerned about the possibility that Allah, Vishnu, or Zeus is the true god?  There could be a diety that we haven't even conceived of.  What if this deity would rather you don't believe than to believe in the wrong god?

aLwrpMPXaa	Etiquette and good manners pretty much are the same as in America. If you visit a home or be it in a public place. Thank you and Pardon me, are also words, well understood and known in Germany.|`|a66nvk0taa	You mean etiquette. If your American. Here are some rules when in Germany. Chewing gum while talking to someone is considered rude.<br>  Germans guard their private life, so do not phone a German at home without permission.Use the formal du and Sie when talking to people older than you. When meeting people shake hands with everyone individually, including children. One tip Cutting your meat first before start eating and then putting the knife down is a definite NO GO in Germany. People will start looking at you as it’s perceived very rude and as typical american Wild West manners<br>  |`|85a4c9cde9714c89ebb089295f22fa0daa	Germans are not huggers, they are handshakers, so don't go around hugging strangers, we hate it.<br>  Another one is if there are like 3 tellers/ agents at a bank or a bakery, people will make 3 lines, not one, and if you "cut", people will stare you down and make remarks about you loudly.<br>  Germans use the horn liberally when driving and if you are in the left lane and a faster vehicle comes up behind you, you HAVE to move over otherwise you get horns, high beams and riding your bumper.<br>  They will flip the bird just like here.<br>  Do not bring roses, unless you definitely have a romantic interest, bring other flowers, if you are invited for dinner.<br>  We use a knife and a fork at the same time and don't put down the knife between bites.<br>  If you are not related to someone, you adress them with "Sie" instead of "Du", unless they invite you to use the "Du" (if they are older then you), or you invite them (if you are older).<br>  I will probably think of more, but for now that's it. Good Luck!

The similar proverb in English is to see is to believe. It emphasized you have to get the first hand information or hands-on experiences. For example, go visit American is better than read a lot of travel books or TV shows. 百闻不如一见is usually used when you knew something a lot but after you take action to “see it”, you learn more thoroughly.|`|c0d08Yjpaa	"Hearing about something isn't as good as seeing it for yourself; hearing about something from many others isn't as good as one look for yourself."<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
9PgCIsZtaa	What do you think makes our country impoverished?<br>  <br>  I think there are a lot to consider. Some facts: a larger percentage of our population is literate, lots of college graduates each year, and we're rich in natural resources. Just that, I don't think we know how to use it and our skills. Each year, the number of unemployed increases and the number of professionals who goes abroad in search of a brighter future increases but the efforts of the government is always not enough. And it always is. I think it's time we stop blaming everyone else and start blaming ourselves why we are poor. Because we choose to be, and no matter how corrupt our government is, we can still be successful if we work hard for it. |`|oFhp03TCaa	I think the government and the people are the problems, first the government if they act,have less "political agenda" and make the share of  the department of  education much bigger , also prioritize the education  lots of people will be educated. As for the people educate themselves, understand whats to be done and not to point fingers on others, let poverty be the fuel to pursue one's goal.<br>  <br>  if a man is educated, discipline will follow.

qjRW7v0eaa	Généralement, la timidité se traduit par une attitude craintive, une gêne excessive et un manque d’assurance dans le comportement face à autrui. Mais elle peut aussi se cacher derrière un comportement agressif qui dénote tout simplement une absence de confiance en soi.<br>  <br>  Ses manifestations sont à la fois physiologiques et psychologiques. Une transpiration excessive, une sensation d’étouffement, des rougeurs ou, au contraire, une paleur du visage, un bégaiement, une altération de la voix qui devient inaudible ou inintelligible ; une raideur musculaire qui entra?ne des gestes maladroits, des tremblements sont les manifestations physiologiques les plus rencontrées chez les timides.<br>  <br>  Sur le plan psychologique, le timide se sent paralysé, incapable de la moindre réaction, focalisé sur l’objet de sa peur : autrui. Il n’arrive pas à envisager la relation avec l’autre autrement que sous le rapport dominant-dominé. Il fuit le contact, se dévalorise. Dans les cas extrêmes, il imagine qu’on lui “veut du mal” à lui qui ne demande rien à personne et n’intéresse personne…<br>  <br>  Assumez : ne vous voilez pas la face et ne vous cherchez pas de faux prétextes pour refuser une sortie, un entretien professionnel ou un rendez-vous galant. Vous êtes timide, acceptez-le. <br>  <br>  N'ayez pas honte : la timidité est mieux acceptée que vous ne le croyez. <br>  Un timide n'est pas ridicule, mais touchant. Il développe chez les autres un instinct de protection quasi-maternel. Il n’est pas difficile de trouver des alliés. <br>  <br>  Parlez-en : expliquez à vos proches quelles sont les situations qui vous embarrassent, les personnes qui vous impressionnent. <br>  <br>  Lancez-vous : c’est la seule fa?on de vous rendre compte que les scénarios négatifs que vous avez con?us dans votre tête ne seront pas vérifiés, et peu à peu vous reprendrez confiance en vous. <br>  Consultez un psy si votre timidité vous gache la vie. Il peut vraiment vous aider.|`|K9FMw4Piaa	On est tous timide...

Dans les h?tels où on s'était rendu, le gérant avait systématiquement refusé de m'accueillir par ce que je suis un homme de couleur. Dans un des h?tels, il me précisait que c'est réservé aux ressortissants du Maghreb excepté la Mauritanie. après échange verbal sale, je lui avais demandé s'il est croyant. il repondait que oui. alors je l'avait dit : tu es mécréant sans ajouter un autre mot comme mon anglais n'était pas bon.

Je suis entouré de nègres, ici. […] Et puis tout cela n’a aucune espèce d’intérêt ! Foutez-moi la paix avec vos nègres ; je ne veux plus en voir d’ici deux mois, vous entendez ? Plus une audience avant deux mois. Ce n’est pas tellement en raison du temps que cela me prend, bien que ce soit déjà fort ennuyeux, mais cela fait très mauvais effet à l’extérieur : on ne voit que des nègres, tous les jours, à l’élysée. Et puis je vous assure que c’est sans intérêt.(Charles de Gaulle - Entretiens avec Jacques Foccart, 8 novembre 1968. cité dans ses Mémoires, tome 2. Le Général en mai.

Les Arabes sont un peuple qui, depuis les jours de Mahomet, n'ont jamais réussi à constituer un état... Avez-vous vu une digue construite par les Arabes ? Nulle part. Cela n'existe pas. Les Arabes disent qu'ils ont inventé l'algèbre et construit d'énormes mosquées. Mais ce fut entièrement l'?uvre des esclaves chrétiens qu'ils avaient capturés...

Je ne suis pas musulman. Donc je ne peux pas faire une réponse comme Leila. Ce monsieur qui pose la question, confond humour et crachat. Démocratie et bordel des opinions. Il est très attaché à SA liberté d'expression et je lui réponds sur le même ton. Comme il ne respecte rien, il ne peut se respecter lui-même, c'est évident. La liberté d'expression de chacun finit où commence celle des autres, et il est lui-même l'auteur de la question aussi sectaire que les islamistes purs et durs, que les rigides de l'Inquisition des temps passés. Insulter, dénigrer est plus aisé, que de laisser tout un chacun vénérer le Dieu de son choix. Ce qui n'est pas le cas des hégémonistes de l'Ancien Testament, des Talibans, des islamistes intégristes et de tous ceux qui portent le feu et le crime pour imposer leurs idées au nom de la libre expression.|`|lHIPlouyaa	Bonjour,<br>  <br>  La difficulté avec l'humour, c'est que ?a ne se trouve pas les livres (ou sous le sabot d'un cheval au choix), c'est un trait de l'esprit, qui, s'il est entra?né peut s'affiner avec le temps.

Mais peine perdue, c'est irréalisable ! Puisqu'il n'y a qu'une seule version du Coran qui existe dans le monde et que L'Islam régit la vie spirituelle et quotidienne du croyant, ce dernier y tient fort. Plus il subit des attaques pour ébranler sa foi, plus il combat pour la fortifier. Et le jour où vous aurez enfin réalisé que vous n'arriverez jamais à vos fins, vous vous mettrez au travail pour combattre d'abord l'ignorance qui vous aveugle à ce sujet et vous trouverez donc des moyens pour adapter votre attitude à ce "phénomène" qui vous dépasse.

Es la doctrina del miedo y es el error más grande que nos han hecho creer. Si tuvieran humildad no dijeran "este es el camino hacia Dios", sino este es un camino diferente hacia Dios. Pero cuesta tanto tener la humildad de reconocer esto tan grande que no lo harán y seguirán diciéndole al mundo que serán condenados por no seguir ese camino.<br>  En fin, seamos diferentes, actuemos diferente, amemos diferente, apartémonos del miedo, mirémonos en el otro como en nosotros mismos, hagamos del amor lo que somos realmente: AMOR, HUMILDAD, ALEGRíA E IGUALDAD.|`|d2a463d72b510ae5bf2c6621e7b9a7a7aa	hijole... yo creo q la unica opcion es viviendo y compartiendo la necesidad de  la gente... digamos q yo sólo pensaba en mi y me fui de misiones una semana con un grupo de jovenes a puebla.... ahi estuvimos en semana santa y es cuando te das cuenta que todos necesitamos de todos, encuentras a Dios de una forma ca?ona... hijole es una experiencia increible, si tienes la oportunidad de ir con el grupod ejovenes de tu iglesia o de tu escuela te lo recomiendo mucho... hay en el colegio méxico, la salle, y muchos colegios así... o si no, no te tienes q ir a puebla NO T E VAYAS LEJOS... ve a un asilo a un orfanatorio.. encuentra la verdadera alegria.. es un sentimiento que no te puedo descirebir con palabras ve a vivirlo.. en serio vas a salir renovada, nueva, en serio hay mucha gente que necesita ayuda y TU PUEDES HACER LA DIFERENCIA|`|d8897d1f14ff854a851c6d4600e9bc71aa	Amiga te envio una reflexion que espero te ayude<br>   Humilde  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  En un almuerzo presidido por Mark Young, gobernador de Hong Kong, una dama de las más distinguidas se sintió menospreciada al descubrir que estaba sentada al extremo de la mesa, en vez de estar cerca del anfitrión.<br>  <br>  Al terminar la comida, se acercó a Mark y le dijo con sequedad: "Según parece, no se cuida usted de dónde se sientan sus invitados."<br>  <br>  "Se?ora", replicó el gobernador, "a la gente realmente importante no le interesa el sitio donde se sienta; y sucede a veces que quienes se interesan por el sitio, no son importantes. <br>  <br>  Isaías 57:15<br>  Porque así dijo el Alto y Sublime, el que habita la eternidad, y cuyo nombre es el Santo: Yo habito en la altura y la santidad, y con el quebrantado y humilde de espíritu, para hacer vivir el espíritu de los humildes, y para vivificar el corazón de los quebrantados.<br>  <br>  Isaías 66:2<br>  Mi mano hizo todas estas cosas, y así todas estas cosas fueron, dice Jehová; pero miraré a aquel que es pobre y humilde de espíritu, y que tiembla a mi palabra.<br>  <br>  Dios te bendiga mucho, lo primero que estas haciendo confesar tu pecado y arrepentirte el el, y perdirle a Dios que te ayude.

A veces creemos que ya lo tenemos todo, que no necesitamos de nadie  y que nadie necesita de nosotros y que somos tan importantes e insustituibles que vivimos confiados en lo que pensamos es nuestra estabilidad emocional o financiera, sin embargo nuestro árbol tiene que ser podado, las experiencias duras de la vida son las herramientas que Dios usa para pulir nuestro corazón de todo orgullo y permitirnos de vez en cuando pasar un chasco de verguenza para que nos demos cuenta cuanto necesitamos el auxilio y la providencia de Dios.  La humildad es reconocer que podemos fallar a Dios, a otros y a nosotros mismos, que no somos infalibles y que no tenemos la autoridad devina para condenar a nadie por sus fallas, ya que muchas veces lo que tanto condenamos en otros , terminamos haciendolo nosotros mismos.  Las humildad estriba en poder acercarnos a otros y solicitar ayuda o consejo, siempre y cuando entendamos que es una persona de fiar.  Espero haberte ayudado.

Aunque el orgullo y la altanería suelen venir también de los complejos escondidos; es decir, los complejos de inferioridad suelen salir a flote con arranques de jactancia y prepotencia... es el temor de que los demás nos vean como insignificantes. En las Escrituras se anima a que "no piense más de sí mismo de lo que sea necesario pensar, sino que piense de tal modo que tenga juicio sano". (Romanos 12:3.) Ese consejo nos ayuda a tener una estima razonable de nosotros mismos.<br>  Por otra parte, debemos comprender que no tenemos la facultad de vernos como los demás nos ven. Así que necesitamos siempre que alguien nos corrija en nuestra manera de actuar y hablar, pues a veces decimos y hacemos cosas que no están bien sin darnos cuenta. Reconocerlo nos permitirá escuchar y mejorar, para bien de las relaciones diarias y para mantener a quienes amamos siempre cerca. Si uno valora más su entorno que a sí mismo, tiene que ceder y evitar la trampa del orgullo.<br>  Ser humilde de corazón no es sencillo, pues desde que uno proclama "soy humilde" ya ha fallado en ello; son los demás quienes pueden dar crédito o desmentirnos al respecto.|`|acfe7739d902c4dab3929a21ca50132faa	Yo creo que no hay una receta mágica, cada uno vivimos nuestro proceso personal dependiendo de las vivencias que hayamos tenido, lo que sí puedo decirte es que hay que tratar de ser lo más transparente posible, como decía nuestra madre Santa Teresa "humildad es andar en verdad"<br>  <br>  Bendiciones!!!|`|xzjUMP4Maa	Hola!

Y resucitó al tercer día"<br>  <br>  Jesús había anunciado la llegada del Reinado de Dios, pero esta llegada no se había producido, y a su anunciador lo Cavaron en una cruz. con la muerte de Jesús parecía que todo había terminado. Su programa religioso se presentaba ahora como la utopia de un iluso. Las autoridades nacionales se había quitado de en medio un problema enojoso. Pero, temiendo cualquier estratagema de los Apóstoles, tomaron sus precauciones: sellaron la puerta del sepulcro de Jesús y pusieron guardia (Mt 27, 66). Los discípulos no tengan ya nada que esperar (Lc 24,21 ).<br>  <br>  Pero muy pronto volvemos a encontrarlos, coincidiendo entre si en una noticia inesperada: Jesús estaba vivo. Al principio es solamente un rumor en voz baja, que enseguida se convierte en una proclamación a los cuatro vientos. ?Qué habia pasado en tan corto espacio de tiempo? Que unos y otros habíj8visto glorioso al Crucificado, y que, en consecuencia, todo volvía a empezar de forma nueva.<br>  <br>  A nosotros toca desentra?ar el significado que la noticia de la resurrección de Cristo tiene en la fe cristiana. ?Cómo lograr este objetivo? Examinando los pasajes del Nuevo Testamento en los que ha quedado registrada literariamente la creencia en la resurrección del Se?or.<br>  <br>  Cuando hoy dia uno se hace cristiano, acepta la fe de la comunidad cristiana en la persona de Jesus, una fe que se remonta, en una sucesión ininterrumpida de creyentes, a la fe de la primera comunidad cristiana. Ahora bien, lo que creyeron los apóstoles y los cristianos primeros sobre la resurrección de Jesús, sólo puede saberse, a través de los textos del Nuevo Testamento en los que ha quedado registrada aquella fe apostólica; por ello análizaremos los pasajes biblicos en los que se expresó la experiencia pascual de la comunidad apostólica.<br>  <br>  Vamos a fijarnos en cinco tipos de textos: confesiones primitivas de la fe cristiana; himnos que cantan a Jesucristo exaltado sobre los cielos; discursos de los Apóstoles anunciando la muerte y la resurrección de Cristo; los relatos evangélicos que cuentan las apariciones del Resucitado y la tradición sobre el sepulcro vacío.<br>  <br>  <br>  La resurrección de Cristo en las primeras confesiones cristianas de la fe<br>  <br>  Los relatos evangélicos de apariciones del Resucitado<br>  <br>  Clases de apariciones<br>  <br>  Utilizando dos criterios distintos, las apariciones del Se?or se pueden clasificar en cuatro tipos:<br>  <br>  -Según el lugar:<br>  <br>  * Apariciones en Jerusalén, donde se encuentra el sepulcro, o en sus alrededores (Emaús o Betania); esta tradición pertenece a Lucas y Juan 20;<br>  <br>  * Apariciones en Galilea; tradición perteneciente a Mateo 28,7.10.16 (Jn 21 en un apéndice posterior a su evangelio).<br>  <br>  <br>  -Según los destinatarios:<br>  <br>  * Apariciones oficiales a los Apóstoles reunidos, con el fin de fundar la Iglesia (sacramentos, jerarquía);<br>  <br>  * Apariciones privadas a personas individuales (mujeres, discípulos), que no tienen tan marcadamente un carácter eclesial.<br>  <br>  <br>  Estructura de los relatos de apariciones<br>  <br>  A pesar de que los relatos de apariciones tienen unos rasgos bastante comunes, coinciden, sin embargo, en un mismo mensaje, que se deduce precisamente de la estructura narrativa de los propios relatos. Con ligeras variantes, todas las narraciones presentan una misma secuencia que se desarrolla en varios momentos:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jesucristosalvador2002/final1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/jesucristosalva...</a>|`|dndoCNdjaa	A ver, empecemos del principio.<br>  <br>  Pruebame que sus discipulos se alejaron.<br>  <br>  Luego que me pruebes eso, podemos continuar.|`|pVioDBcSaa	eso no es prueba|`|yPmoF1LJaa	,,,,,JESUS RESUCITO Y TODOS RESUCITAREMOS EL DIA FINAL AHORA LO INTERESANTES ES  SABER  PARA DONDE RESUCITAREMOS., SI PARA ESTAR CON EL O PARA PERDERLO ETERNAMENTE Y PENAR SIN  FIN  EN EL INFIERNO|`|R0TtcnSVaa	"Jesús"  es un personaje de cómic que nunca ha existido.

Lo tuyo ya se zafa de los límites de la incoherencia. No tengo una Biblia a mano pero, ya que hablás de este tema, espero que conozcas tus fuentes. En enumeradas citas se menciona el compromiso que hicieron muchos de los discípulos de Jesús a pagar el precio que sea necesario por el, incluso el de la muerte; promesa que hicieron antes de su crucifixión.<br>  <br>  Además, por si no recordas hubo alguien que sí murió a causa de Jesús: Judas, luego de darse cuenta de la traición que había llevado a cabo, de lo mucho que amaba a Jesús y de lo mucho que lamentaba haberle entregado, se suicidó. Y por favor interpretá mejor: sea el momento que sea, antes, durante o después de su muerte, ninguno de los discípulos de Jesús estamos excentos de su muerte.

Es demasiado trabajo para un día...Espera hasta ma?ana para terminarla.”<br>  <br>  <br>     “No lo haré”, protestó el Se?or. “Estoy tan cerca de terminar esta creación que es favorita de Mi propio corazón.  Ella ya se cura sola cuando está enferma y puede trabajar días de 18 horas.” <br>     <br>     El ángel se acercó más y tocó a la mujer.<br>  <br>  “?Pero la has hecho tan suave, Se?or! <br>  <br>  “Es suave”", dijo Dios, “pero la he hecho también <br>  fuerte. No tienes idea de lo que puede aguantar o <br>  lograr.”<br>  <br>  "Será capaz de pensar?" preguntó el ángel.? <br>  <br>  Dios contestó:  "No solamente será capaz  de pensar sino de razonar y de negociar."<br>  <br>  El ángel entonces notó algo y alargando la mano <br>  tocó la mejilla de la mujer....<br>  “Se?or, parece que este modelo tiene una fuga...  Te dije que estabas tratando de poner <br>  demasiadas cosas en  ella.”?<br>  <br>  “Eso no es ninguna fuga... es una lágrima”, lo <br>  corrigió El Se?or.<br>  <br>  “?Para qué es la lágrima?”, preguntó el ángel.<br>  <br>  Y Dios dijo:  "Las lágrimas son su manera de <br>  expresar su dicha, su pena, su desenga?o, su  <br>  amor, su soledad, su sufrimiento, y su orgullo.”<br>  <br>  Esto impresionó mucho al ángel.  <br>  <br>  “Eres un genio, Se?or, pensaste en todo. La mujer es  <br>  verdaderamente maravillosa.”<br>  <br>  “Luchan por lo que creen.  Se enfrentan a la  injusticia.  No aceptan ‘no’ por respuesta cuando ellas creen que hay una solución mejor.  Se privan para que su familia pueda tener.  Van al médico con una amiga que tiene miedo de ir.  Aman incondicionalmente.”<br>  <br>  “Lloran cuando sus hijos triunfan y se alegran <br>  cuando sus amistades consiguen premios. <br>  Son  felices cuando escuchan sobre un <br>  nacimiento o una boda.” <br>  <br>  “Su corazón se rompe cuando muere una amiga. <br>  Sufren con la pérdida de un ser querido, sin <br>  embargo son fuertes cuando piensan que ya no <br>  hay más fuerza. <br>  Saben que un beso y un abrazo <br>  pueden ayudar a curar un corazón roto.” <br>  <br>  “Sin embargo, hay un defecto en la mujer:<br>  <br>  ?Es que se le olvida cuánto vale…!”|`|RRoZp4kxaa	Jaja, pieno igual que tu!!!<br>  Tienes toda la razon...

8Ptnulshaa	I am atheist, and my boyfriend is catholic. <br>  <br>  We've been dating for over two years now, and have talked about our differences. It doesn't really effect our relationship. <br>  <br>  It does bug me a bit when he talks about god though. Haha. <br>  But not too bad. Lol. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it. Don't over do it. It does get annoying. <br>  "I pray for you. I thank god for you" i would be like shut up. <br>  <br>  Don't pressure him to convert. Don't mention it. <br>  <br>  And if you stay together and have kids don't brainwash them!! <br>  Please let them grow up open minded and decide their OWN faith. <br>  Not one that has been shoved into their brains. <br>  |`|AA11639232	echoing damselchum's earlier statement, I too get turned off a little when a girl I might be interested in starts talking god. Don't worry though, being turned off is not the same as being "offended". I think this is a question that you should be asking your boyfriend and not a bunch of random strangers (insert lol here), but in my opinion, I think he would be, at least a little. |`|AxD8we9daa	Prove to him that God exists. Shouldn't be hard, im sure you have you reasons to believe in God.<br>  <br>  I say sex him :/ you know you want it|`|N6nHHe92aa	Always put God first kiddo...

And I do feel uncomfortable when religious folks "pray for me" |`|ZLg97gPyaa	Your answer is easy.  It gets old with all the "god" talk but your boyfriend will still care no matter what if he truly loves you.  I went through that with my girlfriend awhile back.  |`|ELM5i7LAaa	It worked for my parents and they're still happily married after 26 years.

We were generally too 'busy'... ;-)|`|sDATc03Yaa	I would never date anyone who believed in gods.  To me, that's no different than dating an adult who tells me they think unicorns and leprechauns are real.  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, what would happen if you were to marry an atheist and have children?  Would you still respect his lack of belief if he said he didn't want you to teach your children about gods?  This is a very real problem that many people don't consider.|`|LnM5p7Oqaa	baby got bible!|`|2de0b79e82da7f529f88b7bd06230c4faa	  - May the Lord keep you . . . |`|AA11308688	It might annoy him with your references to a god and the prayers, but although he tells you he respects your views he probably thinks your prayers are pointless and wasting your time. Nevertheless it is not you but any of your relatives who may continually refer to religion that will really annoy him. You both still have a lot of living to do before you get married but if you do stay together then you should seriously discuss how you will bring up your children,  unfortunately that may be your biggest problem, hope it is not.  Best of luck.

Only God knows the date.|`|5582743024fc9da8e04d29cc1ed949abaa	No<br>  <br>  In fact the only thing about the timing of the end of the world in the Bible is Jesus telling people "Only the father will know the year the day the hour". <br>  <br>  So why are Christians trying to figure it out and predict it when Jesus flat out told you not to?|`|NB3R77k3aa	No, the Bible specifically states that noone knows when it is coming.<br>  <br>  2012 comes from the fact that the Mayan Long Count calendar resets, as it has 3 other times in the past.|`|jx5lMejuaa	no its doesnt say 2012 but it does say tht it may be sn no 1 knows for sure|`|pfNnuD5saa	No! The Bible says NO ONE but GOD knows the end.|`|4dsnapiuaa	The Bible never mentions it.  The Mayan calendar did.  Look it up online...it's interesting, but has no basis in reality - much like the Bible.|`|5iSTwjA3aa	For centuries people have claimed to have seen the end of time in the Bible (try looking up doomsday prophets on line and you'll see them all).  If you try hard enough you could pick a random date, go through the Bible and pick out when you see those numbers, and say that the world will end.  If any of those people actually read the Bible, they would see that the world will not end until the second coming of Christ and 1000 years of peace.  So I wouldn't worry too much about it.|`|7c9e5548e9394636c11cf3954cb86abeaa	No!  No!  No!  No!  ;)<br>  <br>  The Bible specifically says that nobody knows when the world will end.|`|bRIpwBeTaa	Nope, nobody knows the day or the hour of His returning.|`|h07uBpjNaa	No. People have been predicting the "end of the world" based on the Bible for hundreds of years. So far, they have all been wrong. Jesus himself said that no one knows...|`|sbjfXmpFaa	The bible doesn't give any definite "date". NO one knows the exact time or day when the "Lord" will come back, Only HE knows, but given the signs of the times and everything that is going on lately, shouldn't we prepare ourselves and learn what we can so that we won't be lost or left behind???

7BZvRArjaa	Secrets of Speaking with a Genuine Accent<br>  by Owen Lee <br>  <br>  Acquiring a genuine accent can be the ultimate icing on the cake in your journey to perfecting a language. While some accents are glaringly obvious like the American twang compared to the lyrical Irish accent, some are subtle and barely noticeable to the untrained ear. Eventually you may be able to notice these minor differences in accents between different regions and people. Mastering it can take longer, but can be very gratifying. <br>  <br>  Let's compare the American and the British accent: although both are English, they are actually articulated using different parts of the mouths. Britons tend to use the front part of the mouth and the tip of the tongue, whereas Americans "push sounds together" with the back part of the mouth and to a large extent rely on the nose. That is why American English is to be said to sound "harder" (as opposed to "softer"). <br>  <br>  Each accent really is a system of pronouncing words in a standard manner. And the differences between them are best seen (or rather, heard) in the vowels. I used to tell my students who want to get a London Cockney accent to simply enlarge their mouth when pronouncing the "I" sound and they would immediately sound a lot more like some Londoners. Of course there are other little details which can only be acquired through active listening to the native speaker's speech. <br>  <br>  Native speakers use different parts of their mouth and different facial muscles to get their characteristic sound. You probably have heard or noticed something about the French people. I'm not talking about their alleged romanticism (or snobbishness, depending on whether you're an admirer or not). It has something to do with the strong nasal sound. (Some even say that the French speak with their noses.) <br>  <br>  There is some truth to it, though funny it may sound. To speak good French you have to first obtain the skill of "pushing" certain sounds through you nose. <br>  <br>  The French are not the only ones with a unique speech style; each language makes use of different parts of your mouth and vocal chords. <br>  <br>  Certain languages could be physically impossible for you to speak with a genuine accent due to some weak muscles of the mouth (which are never used to speak your mother tongue), but you can consciously develop certain muscles and breathing pattern to get very close to a native speaker. <br>  <br>  At times you may find it really difficult to imitate a sound or to understand the way a native speaker is using his mouth. A very powerful technique I stumpled upon is what I call the "accent reverse engineering". <br>  <br>  Observe how a native speaker speaks your own language. Chances are he/she will be speaking with an accent. This will leave you clues about how the native speaker uses his/her "vocal instruments", namely which part of the mouth he/she tends to use more, where he/she puts his tongue, how the air in his mouth is regulating, etc. <br>  <br>  For example, if you are wondering how to speak German the way Germans do, just listen to how they speak English. You will notice that they pronounce English in an especially "breathy" way, accentuating all the "s" and "z". The British entertainer Sacha Baron Cohen does a very good job in his "Da Ali G Show", impersonating an Austrian. If possible, listen to how he pushes his tongue forward and tap on his palate. <br>  <br>  Of course, performers on TV normally like to play into stereotypes and exaggerate accents for a comic effect. You should aim to sound convincing and not offensive. <br>  <br>  <br>  Pronunciation and listening comprehension<br>  Some tips on learning how to pronounce foreign languages and on improving your listening comprehsion. <br>  <br>  Why good pronunciation is important<br>  Learning how to pronounce a foreign language like a native speaker is difficult but not impossible. The better your pronunciation, the better people will understand you and the easier you will find it to understand them. <br>  <br>  Tuning your ears and practising listening comprehension<br>  Before you start trying to speak a foreign language, spend some time tuning your ears to its sounds and rhythms. You can do this by listening to the language as much as possible via the radio, TV, movies and native speakers in your neighbourhood. There are online radio stations in a wide variety of languages. <br>  <br>  When you first try listening to your chosen language, you'll understand only a little or nothing at all, other than perhaps the names of people and places and the odd word, unless you're learning a language closely related to your L1. You may even find it difficult to believe that what you're listening to is a real language that people are able to converse in. However if you continue to listen to your L2 as much as possible, you will gradually become familiar with the the sounds and rhythms of the language and start to be able to pick out words and phrases. Eventually you'll be able to understand most if not all of what you hear in your L2. <br>  <br>  There are a number of things you try to help you understand radio and TV broadcasts: <br>  <br>  Rather than just listening or watching at random, find out what programmes are on and choose one that sounds interesting. In this way you will have an idea of what the programme is about. <br>  Set yourself goals, for example when listening to the news try to work out the main points, names, dates and times. <br>  Brush up relevant vocabulary before tuning in. For example if you're planning to watch a cooking programme, revise food words first <br>  Even if you can't understand very much at all, try to identify word and sentence boundaries <br>  If possible listen to the news in your L1 first, then when you listen to it in your L2 you'll already be aware of the mains stories. <br>  Don't try to listen to or watch too much in one go: if you're finding it a struggle, take a break and/or do something else. <br>  Listening to songs in your L2 is another way to improve your listening comprehension, especially if you have the lyrics written out so that you can follow them as you listen. <br>  <br>  Audio magazines<br>  A great way to improve your listening comprehension and pronunciation is with the audio magazines produced by Champs-Elysées. These montly publications are available in French, German, Italian and Spanish and consist of an hour-long programme on CD or audio cassette covering a wide range of topics, such as politics, current affairs, sports, travel, film, and literature. The accompanying magazine includes a full transcript of the programme plus vocabulary and notes. Optional study supplements are also available. <br>  <br>  You can find out more at: www.champs-elysees.com <br>  <br>  Learning pronunciation<br>  With your ears tuned to the sounds and rythmns of your L2, you'll find learning how to pronounce the language less difficult. <br>  <br>  If your language course includes a recorded pronunciation guide and exercises, listen to them until you have internalized all the points, but don't try to learn everything in one go. Beware of pronunciation guides that compare the sounds of your L2 with your L1. This can be misleading as the sounds, particularly the vowels, are often different. <br>  <br>  Alternatively or additionally you could try finding a native speaker to help you with pronunciation. Ask them to speak slowly and to enunciate each word clearly. Then try to mimic them. Pay attention to the shapes their lips make, and also to their posture and any gestures they make. <br>  <br>  Pimsleur language courses are very good at teaching you pronunciation: when introducing new words they break them up and teach you how to pronounce each syllable. Rosetta Stone courses are also good for learning pronunciation: they include the facility to record your voice and to visually compare it with a native speaker's voice. <br>  <br>  Once you've got to grips with the pronunciation of your L2, you need to learn how to map the sounds to the written form of the language. This is fairly straight forward for languages like Italian, Spanish and German, which have consistent and regular spelling. Other languages, such as English, French and Danish, present more of a challenge with their irregular and somewhat chaotic spelling. Learning a language written with a different writing system adds an extra level of difficulty. <br>  <br>  Better pronunciation through song<br>  If you enjoy singing, try learning some songs in the language you're learning. This is a fun way to improve your pronunciation and vocabulary. You could also try learning to recite poems and stories. Listening to songs in your L2 is an enjoyable way to improve your listening comprehension, especially if you have the lyrics written out so that you can follow them as you listen. <br>  <br>  Phonetics and phonology<br>  Learning a bit about phonetics and phonology will enable you to pronounce your L2 better. A good way to start is to learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), which can be used to represent all the phonemes of human speech and is therefore a reliable guide to pronunciation. <br>  <br>  If you take the time to familiarise yourself with the IPA symbols, the phonemes they represent and how to pronounce them, you'll find this knowledge invaluable in your language learning. Particularly because the IPA is used to indicate pronunciation in some dictionaries and language textbooks. <br>  <br>  In some cases you may not be able to hear particular phonemes, but you can be sure that you're pronouncing them correctly if you have your tongue, lips and teeth in the necessary positions and if your breath is moving in the right direction. <br>  <br>  There's a good online introduction to phonetics and the IPA at: <a href="http://www.unil.ch/ling/english/phonetique/table-eng.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unil.ch/ling/english/phonetiq...</a> <br>  <br>  Accents<br>  Human speech uses a total of over 800 different phonemes. A phoneme is the smallest contrastive unit in the sound system of a language.

PxG0kEKgaa	En el curso de doctorado en Historia del Derecho italiano, con particular referencia a la historia moderna del Derecho en la Universidad de Siena (XIII ciclo), estoy realizando una investigación sobre el papel de abogado John Carmignani pisana (1768-1847). <br>  En la fase inicial de la investigación, uno dedicado a la recopilación de información prosopografici, tuve la oportunidad de obtener permiso para visitar a la familia Carmignani1 Villa (el último resto de los activos de la familia), ubicado en una fracción de la ciudad de Columbia: Poggio al Pallone2 . <br>  La propiedad es actualmente propiedad de la Caja Nacional de Medicina Forense, que compró el late'70s a la redacción de testamento legado a él después de que el descendiente de la familia, el abogado.

Hay también varias tapas de libros capitanes de la explotación de Poggio al Pallone y la Piano7, una copia de civiles y penales de la ciudad de Piombino (en latín e italiano texto margen) 8, una copia de un Edicto Felice de El Príncipe de Lucca y Pisa en Piombino emitido el 14.

Aquí están algunos de los libros mantenidos en la posesión por argumento legal. Giuliana Carmignani. Además de estos, hay algunos ejemplares de las obras de John Carmignani: el primer volumen para las Causas de la famosa pisana jurista (en su segunda edición, que lleva en el prólogo escrito la biografía del jurista dall'Abate F.

You might want to clarify that a bit.<br>  <br>  Protestants are Christians, and Christians are called saints in the Bible. So...it wouldn't make sense to say that Protestants don't like saints (themselves).<br>  <br>  If you're talking about CATHOLIC saints, that's another story. And it has nothing to do with like or dislike; it's a separate set of beliefs. Catholics believe in sainthood for individuals based on certain criteria (they have to have witnessed miracles, etc), and they also pray to saints. Christians (Protestants) don't do that - Christians believe all Christians are called saints, no one is more special than another, and the only one we pray to is God, never to another person, living or dead.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you.<br>  <br>  <br>  And to "Sldgman" below - it is completely untrue that Protestants reject everything Catholic. Please educate yourself before spouting ignorance and misinforming someone who is genuinely trying to learn. Thanks.|`|h2HxsSJ5aa	Protestants use the term saint to mean anyone who is saved.  However, using the term in its Catholic sense, they don't like them because all people are equally sinful before God and there don't need to be any intermediates between the faithful and God.  Also, the Bible says not to call on dead people and expresses the idea elsewhere that the dead are asleep, i.e. not conscious, until the resurrection, so they can't hear prayers anyway.<br>  <br>  MAD BIT COMING UP:<br>  <br>  If you try to contact devout Protestant dead people, they refuse to communicate and avoid you.

If they didn't directly break from the Catholic Church they are not truly Protestant but Johnnies-come-late that could in actuality merely be a sect or a cult.  But I digress...<br>  <br>  Those who dislike Saints dislike them because they don't know what they are.  By definition a Saint is a person who lived and died in Christ's friendship and is now in Heaven with Christ.  There are no living Saints and humans do not become angels when they die.  There are only saintly, or saint-like people and Angels are a separate species of God's Creation that predate the Creation of Mankind.  <br>  <br>  H<br>  |`|AA10242926	All christians are saints.  Some religious practices pray to saints which have already gone on to be with God.  This is looked at as not a biblical thing and so protestants stand in protest against this manmade tradition that is not clearly supported in the bible.  It is really too bad that a billion or so people follow a religion that used to torture real christians.  And they're always down at the end of the street here once a year with beer wagons and selling their little lottery tickets.  What kind of faith is that?|`|ASUexkSdaa	"In many Protestant churches, the word "Saint" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar in usage to Paul's numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this sense, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (i.e., a professing Christian) is a 'saint' because of their relationship with Jesus.

But when Protestants read the Bible, they see that Jesus said that nobody can come to the Lord except through Him (Jesus).  So to Protestants, Catholics are engaged in idol worship.<br>  Now, before you go all postal on them, realize that most Protestants take the Bible as the actual word of God and intensely distrust people such as priests who "interpret" the Bible from other languages such as Latin.

Also, the Saints often did things not in keeping with biblical tradition, such as Joan of Arc leading men into battle. In addition Luther and all the other early Prot. theologians refused to believe that a priest could serve as an intermediary between you and God; there was no need for a priest. The saints served the same purpose, so we don't need them either. In addition the Virgin Mary was a saint and Protestants couldn't stand the idea that she was such a competitor to Jesus for the hearts of the faithful.<br>  Since about 1/3 of the year back then was devoted to religious festivals, such as the day of St. John or the all the other saints, the Protestants eliminated these holy days so that people would do sober things like work instead.

It is all in the Bible!<br>  <br>  According to the Bible, ONE SUREST SIGN of Jesus coming back and the Rapture? is the slaughter of innocent children in the end of days! Some Christian preachers explain away this gross fact in the Bible… The Bible writers made it into a pattern that before any major event in Bible stories innocent children get slaughtered! This is a primitive trick to scare the heck out of religious people to catch their attention! When Israel was liberated from Egypt God had ALL the innocent first born children of Egyptian parents slaughtered on the spot! When Jesus was born ALL the innocent male children 2 years of age and under were slaughtered in a way that not even God the Holy Ghost could possibly comfort the grieving mothers! (Mat 2:18)  So it will be when Jesus comes back a lot of liberal Churches will loose ALL their CHILDREN… Jesus will have them slaughtered not in Iraq, but in the Churches!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says in his REVELATION for the last days) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Just for the heck of it! Hey, No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies… AMEN???... Jesus is doing the killing of the innocent children to announce his return and at the same time teach everybody a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Christians are very selective in what they preach from the Bible! Their PRO-LIFE bit is an afford to dissociate themselves from this kind of Jesus’ REVELATION…!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.<br>  <br>  I’m the BOSS says Jesus Christ the LORD and I take it on the kids in the Churches! Jesus is promoting the killing of children of the wrong faith BY EXAMPLE! His religion is as primitive as the Islamic Fundamentalists, although what a horrific truth...! They don’t make any sacred pronouncement to KILL CHILDREN like Jesus does! Please correct me if I am wrong! Jesus’ infanticide mania comes from way back when God the Father highly favored anyone killing the innocent children of Israel’s enemies. Fortunately, Israel doesn’t go for this kind of God anymore!   <br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 (NIV) O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us* (*Israel) --he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  Jesus knows that the enemies of God ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them! In Bible times hardly anybody practiced abortions because it was easier and much safer to “dash the infants against the rocks” after they are born like God suggests in his Holy Word the Bible! Unwanted children were put out without any accountability right after they were born like it was done in Egypt to the willing Hebrew ladies. Christianity is not much of a civilized religion at all! Today, it is pure Christian PRO-LIFE bigotry of the worst kind that makes Christianity acceptable in our religious controlled society…! <br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this story… most Christians prefer to ignore!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here and kill them in front of me.<br>  <br>  Jesus is suggesting the slaughter by drowning of anybody causing a Christian who is weak in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6)… Jesus is also suggesting the shedding of body parts to make it into the Kingdom of Heaven! (Mat 5:29-30), INCLUDING male castration (Mat 19:12). BTW male castration is forbidden by the old God’s “Be fruitful and multiply” and other laws against erectile dysfunction. Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus’ gory suggestions, but throughout history many of them got castrated anyway (See Wikipedia, castration).  A lot of people paid with their lives for disobeying the Clergy, too including the witches and slaves that were killed here in America ONE NATION UNDER GOD! The first criminals to be sentenced to death by hanging in Christian America were witches! That was the faith of the founding fathers of our great nation!|`|ZPkYSkNVaa	satan the devil is Gods worst enemy.|`|AA10126061	Why do you care?

There must be a slight misunderstand between you and the bible.If thats the way there wouldnt be the bible dont use your own human interpretation to judge on God's world it totally cannot be,God is a loving God. God give us free will. That's correct but he did not allow someone to be a born murderer,thats why babies are cute and innocent,untill,the environment inflict a physcological change in their nature, they can became all sort of evil things like sinister,cunning,jealous,brutal,violent and many more of such. Its the devil who created all this evil things, thats the devil's nature,in the 1st place God didnt want to let the cheif angel to turn into something that will go into his will but because he loved the angels and want to gave them their own choice,even if it means they own destruction.However God then made use of satan to test human beings especially christians who are believer, satan's plan is to make them sinners again by tempting them into sinning.Because God wanted humans to depend on God for the strength to fight this,this is the strength of faith and is nurtured through faith. He created us not because he haves no one to love but the love that was already existing in the holy trinity. God can choose to intervent because he is sovereign and have that right to do so.But every reason is of good design and best for us. Therefore whether the person is saved or not would determine if he/she builds up his temple and faith therefore he is impervious to the influences of the sinful world. Basically humans need to obey God's commandmant and hear his words because they are human's guiding principle of life, the person can choose whether to hear it or not that's a form of freewill(such as your friend preaching to you).However my friend God is working in our hearts everyday waiting for you to accept his love,because he's the truth and the life and your creator , if you chosen the way of the world you are foolish because its all planned for destruction. God is full of love, but his patience has a limit dont regret it for when you enter the seal of hell you will suffer for eternally thats a horrible place as described by the bible and some testomonies given by people who really experience hell and heaven. However one last thing christians who preach are of a goodwill and they need to because God uses them as a mediator to spread God's love or Gospel(good news). And it is very important that they preach without these christians the population of christian will not grow through the centuries right? But because of the holy spirit powerful influence in these christians they are able to change the human's purpose by will because God is working in those person's life,they can christ love anytime they want,PROVIDED if that person are TRULY REPENTANCE and want to change their sinful way of life.one of such exps,a person who is what he thought never able to change,a homosexual,but he knew and believe because homosexual is wrong he has a strong feeling that it is wrong. therefore if he is truly repentant believe me God will change him.Amen.I hope this helps,but if it doesnt it means that you are under the devil's slavery. And you must pray for strength to deliver you from this evil if u still choose not to believe than i afraid you are choosing your own path of destruction. Good luck my friend the world is evil repent you are warned.|`|FaTOVojTaa	Imagine you're playing chess with a grand master. (I'm assuming you aren't a chess grand master for the purposes of this illustration.) The grand master would think through his strategy, move his pieces to force you into a bad position, then either defeat you in 5 moves or walk casually through the defense you thought you'd intricately secured, take every single one of your pieces from under your nose and completely annihilate you.<br>  <br>  Now, within this game you have free will to perform whatever move you wish to make. But if the grand master decides you're going to lose in 5 moves, you'll lose in 5 moves. If the grand master decides he's going to string the game out and take all your pieces, then that's what's going to happen.<br>  <br>  So, despite you having free will, the grand master will always be in control of the game, and it will always result in the way he wants it to.<br>  <br>  Just because you aren't ultimately in control doesn't mean that you don't have free will and can't formulate your own strategy and make your own decisions.<br>  <br>  Your conclusion, therefore, that there is no God is deemed invalid by this analogy.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	God knows the future of what the free will creatures choose. Free will does not stop becoming free because God knows what will happen. For example, I know that my child will choose to eat chocolate cake over a steaming bowl full of brussels sprouts. If I were to set them both before my child, it is safe to say she will not eat the sprouts. Knowing this is not taking away the freedom of my child since she is freely choosing one over the other. Likewise, for God to know what a person will choose does not mean that the person has no freedom to make the choice. It simply means that God knows what the person will choose.<br>  <br>  If God is timeless, then it means that every moment in our time will essentially be the same moment to him. All our moments will exist with His timeless moment simultaneously. This would mean that, assuming God has great powers of observation, God could know about our choices by directly observing them happen. 'Will' doesn't equal 'must' and that God's knowledge is contingent on our choices, not the other way round.

The writing system is quite easier to learn compared to Japanese and Chinese. If you want to learn a language that can be of help to you in the future, try Spanish, Italian or French because these are the most commonly used languages(in my opinion) ranking next to English and Chinese. <br>  <br>  Choose a language that will really help you and at the same time, you will enjoy.<br>  <br>  You can also try Filipino(Its my native language). It is based on two languages(Spanish and Malay) so if you want to learn any of the two it would be a good "foundation" language.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|pATAONudaa	Sense you are already fluent in probably the two most useful languages in the world, why don't you do something you think is cool?<br>  I am trying to learn Icelandic, even though like only 300,000 people speak it haha.

Chinese would probably be a good language to pick up (it's one of the most used in the world) or one of the European languages such as French or Spanish (or Mexican Spanish). I'd say either go with a language you think you'll enjoy learning or one you're positive will be useful to you in the future.|`|6VLp5Pmcaa	french is widely spoken so that could be useful

And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you." This quote doesn't tell us what the subject under discussion in the previous verses was, but serves my purpose. It shows that God gives us room to think, agree, disagree, inquire, research, you name it. He made us as thinkers and expects us to do so. This verse points out that God is willing and able to reveal everything we need to resolve our questions about our faith. He's patient with our attitudes and obstinateness. <br>  <br>  The idea that anyone would walk away from faith because of an unresolved question is preposterous and suggests that they didn't actually possess the faith on the inside, or personally know God. There's a difference between having questions about belief and teaching of the faith, and questioning the faith itself. Once one has actually encountered God, or rather, been encountered by Him, unbelief is not an option; the experience is too real for trifling around with the details, which usually come into perspective over time.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, let me advise the precious friends who question their faith; I became a Christian 40 years ago, and had more questions than the days of the year, but never once could I dismiss the faith of Christ itself. You see, He got me real good, and it's worked well in my life. So if you have questions, be sincere and prayerfully research the answers. There's too much information right under your noses to let last years questions still bug you this year! Get into your Bibles for real, and don't let the questions and comments you see on this site ruffle your feathers. It's easier to ask a hard question than it is to answer a simple one. Best wishes to all.|`|PZHg3c04aa	All the time. <br>  As a christian I follow Jesus' teaching and the bible, these are real. <br>  <br>  What I question is the religious leaders, they are human and subject to mistakes, some on purpose and some are wolves in sheep's clothing, Jesus warns about them. [some of them are on this forum].<br>  <br>   A good pastor will tell you to check into what he is teaching you, not just take his word for it. In other words my personal walk with Jesus is my responsibility not my pastor or  my church. Christians should be reading Gods word for themselves and comparing what they read to what there religious leaders are teaching. We should ask them about things that don't seem to make sense.<br>  <br>  God Bless <><|`|40818abe059c5a404b4e9558ae4491e2aa	Yes,<br>  <br>  Long ago, when I was a child, my partents took me to Babtist church every sunday.

Neither is certainty nor conviction faith. A state of mind attains to faith levels only when it actually dominates the mode of living. Faith is a living attribute of genuine personal religious experience. One believes truth, admires beauty, and reverences goodness, but does not worship them; such an attitude of saving faith is centered on God alone, who is all of these personified and infinitely more.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	Absolutely, but what I keep coming back to is that I can't find anything more important and powerful than love.

The right girl just hasn't come along yet. I remember my pastor telling us the story of how he met his wife and I'll share it with you. <br>  It was in the 60's and he was young in age and young in the Lord. He had a zeal and love for the Lord that all could see. He wanted a wife badly and the Lord spoke to him and told him to just keep his eyes focused on Him rather than looking for a wife. So, he lay all that aside and began his ministry. One day a couple of his brothers in Jesus came over right at the time my pastor decided to take a walk. As they were walking and talking the two men just followed Pastor wherever he walked. They asked him where he was going and he said that he didn't know but that he was sure the Lord knew. So they all just walked. They had just turned a corner of one street when two young women ran out of their duplex screaming that their water line had broken and water was flooding their kitchen. Pastor volunteered to help them and since he was a carpenter/plumber by trade he had the matter under control in just a few minutes. After wards they talked for half an hour or so about the Lord. The girls came to know Christ that afternoon. The next day my pastor walked back to where the girls lived, knocked on the door and when the one girl whom he was seeking answered the door he just looked at her and said, "I'm going to marry you," and she answered, "yes, I know." They've been married now for almost 40 years. Happily, I might add. They are my best friends, next to Jesus. Make him preeminent in your life.Col.1:18. He knows your heart and he sees what you desire. The people that don't know Him might be "cool" but really they aren't. Only on the surface. What matters is what is in the heart. <br>  I have a web site that you might be interested in and it's myfaithsite.com/knowinghim. You can email me there or here. I'd like to introduce you to my pastor if you're interested. He is an awesome man. Hard to take for some Christians but no one can ever deny that He really puts Jesus first and he always speaks the truth.<br>  God Bless you. Don't give up on Jesus and remember the time we're in. Look all around you now is not the time to consider the world as your home. Mizpah! <br>  |`|KWwW7N49aa	That's hard to believe. I think lots of women would love to date you.

For instance saying that he is "being isolated."  That people are "doing something" to him.  Ane his comment that he "would not be accepted."  He puts all the rejection onto THEM and nothing on himself.<br>  <br>  It sounds like he doesn't have good social skills.  If you don't date for 20 years - that's not everybody elses fault.  <br>  <br>  What should he do?  Seek counselling.

The mysteries of Mithras are open only to men; conversely, many Dionysian associations are only open to women. The mysteries of Orpheus require vegetarianism, which many find to be restrictive. Each of these mysteries have sites all across the Imperium, so you don't have to worry about location.<br>  <br>  Personally, I am most attached to the mysteries of the goddess Isis.

Sometimes we need to be refueled with the joy of the Word of the Lord. You also don't have to be devoted to one church.  Try a few and go to some that target young kids.

I do believe that God wants you to get together with others to worship him.  <br>  <br>  Don't let people keep you from allowing your relationship to grow even stronger with the Lord.  Call on God and ask him to lead you to a church that has all the desire you are looking for in a church.  Once you find it make sure YOU get involved.  Know that church is for people who aren't.  Noone is perfect.  You won't find it at church.  That is why people are going, but don't let other people burn you.

He did it all on the cross;  He loves us too much to leave us in our sin, bad attitudes etc and  staying a baby. we need to grow in Him, a part of that is to go to church and get some of your "rough" edges smoothed out. seek God which one to go to, even if a home fellowship that belongs to a church.  then we need teaching, and fellowship with other like minded people. a piece of coal with go out unless  it has others to help it burn. remember the parable of the ten virgins, they were all Christians and they all had the Holy Spirit. they just did not keep their relationship with Jesus fresh and He said He did not know them.|`|lEPGcFqFaa	The only requirement to go to heaven is being saved, having been born again.  However, God's church has a special place in his plans over there, for from it He will take His bride(God the Son, Jesus).  To not have scriptural baptism is to not be a part of His church.  Church assemblies are where the saved fellowship and received spiritual food for the soul and the bible tells us not to forsake the assemblying of our selves together as the manner of some is and much more so as we see the end drawing nigh.  In numbers there is comfort and what Christ promised that if two or more are gathered together in His name, there would He be in the midst also.  Jesus bought the Church with his own blood.  Reckon it's important to HIM?|`|DdLfYaf5aa	The trick is to go to a good church.  You don't even have to go to the sermons.

That goes for anybody whether or not they attend church. Good works can't get you to Heaven. Alms to the poor can't get you to Heaven. Church attendance can't get you to Heaven. Only faith in Christ's sacrifice can get you to Heaven. If you have that settled, then your eternal security is settled, and the Bible offers you assurance of it.<br>  <br>  As for why you would need a church... the world can be very- let's say unsupportive, of Christianity. Jesus said it Himself- that the world will hate us because the world has hated Him. We don't live in a 1950's world that offers family-style moral values, so we can't look to society for our ethical cues. To live a life in line with the Bible, and to keep your ear to it, is to be a social non-conformist.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, in a busy, modern, fast-paced world, it requires encouragement from others to actually read the Bible, pray, and meditate on Scripture, and to keep focus on God. I can understand your reluctance to get close to people at churches. Is there a small group of Christians that you can join, maybe in a coffeeshop, or a house church, or in a home Bible study? Church doesn't have to be on Sunday morning, and it doesn't have to be in a big building, but the idea is to be in fellowship with believers, to use your talents for Christ, to worship, and learn more about the Bible. Pray that God will give you some believers who are worthy of your trust, who will not take advantage of you, and who will be available to be a community with you. There are good people out there.

Can we persivere thru times of hartache and dissapointment , just as JESUS did and his followers ?? Seeing that JESUS suffered while in this world and he is our master and we are not better than him isnt it logical that we too will suffer while in this world?<br>  Jhon 15: 18 <br>  "If the world hates you,you know that it hated me before it hated you."<br>  i go to church fairly regularly now - almost every sunday and when times come that i start falling away - the HOLY SPIRIT will start telling me to return in the messages that i hear preached on the radio and tv and from what i read in the BIBLE , so GOD obviously has a meaning for it and a pourpose for attending - not only that but we hear the spirit of  GOD speaking wisdom into our lives through his ministers and teachers - when problembs arise the first thing i do is seek GOD's guidence and the very best form i have is chrurch really .<br>  There is no such thing as a "lone ranger CHRISTian"<br>  CHRIST walked the earth and instructed his deciples to go out into the earth and spread the gospel of peace , not just recive it to ourselves and keep it hidden. <br>  Matt. 5:14 <br>  "you are the light of the world.A city that is set upon a hill cannot be hidden, nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand and it gives light to all that are in the house , Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven."<br>  Read the parable of the minas in Luke 19:12-26 and see how GOD expects us to DO SOMETHING with the knowledge that he has richly bestowed upon us .<br>  also read the parable of the talents.<br>  GOD has made you into a light my friend - now he wants to put you up on a lampstand so that all those around you will see and can see the LORD GOD for who he is.you and i are not perfect but he is and he wants to show the world how powerfull and forgiveing he really is through the body of CHRIST on earth.<br>  this is what i personaly did<br>  i resolved to myself and i guess to GOD that NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED i would go to church regularly as humanly possible EVERY SUNDAY FOR ONE YEAR - and no matter how hard it would be i would stick it out the entire time and see how diffrent my life would be at the end of that year.<br>  Friend - i love telling you that i have 46 days remaining in the resolution ...and it was the BEST thing i have EVER done in my life -<br>  GOD willing (and obviously he is) - i will attend church regularly for the rest of my life.<br>  It was very hard on me the first few months and i got mad - hurt - dissapointed and frustrated but GOD taught me SO MUCH <br>  you see , i live in a very small texas town and i have hiv - the whole community shuns me and all types of rumors abound but GOD has shown me patientce , kindness , love , honor , courage , respect , forgiveness and generosity <br>  all qualities that i only barely had before <br>  now i feel like there isnt anything i cant overcome as long as i follow the leading of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT.<br>  I hope this helped and i will pray for your return to church and that you will like myself learn thinga about yourself , others and mostly GOD that you could have never seen all on your own.<br>  GOD bless you <br>  |`|UQFsWiFAaa	I once battled with this, but if u really feel u are close to God, ask him. Ask him is this important, God exposes us to a lot of things that he will later use for some form of ministry, maybe he had u going there for a reason. The church today is so very misguided, bt if everyone leaves that know the truth then who will be there to stand up and speak the truth to the blind. God may have had u there to utilize you to make those churches turn from there incorrect or wicked ways. We should fellowship with other believers, I go to a very good bible based church were not perfect but we do preach the truth. And the whole truth is that "the church" is within you, within all believers, (I learned this at church), If Jesus was flesh today he wouldnt be in the church, well maybe some the ones filled with hypocrites, but he would be in the streets, saving souls. If u read the bible u will see that Jesus was in the cities, he wasnt confined to 4 walls, bt he did think very highly of the temple and proves it when he went into the temple and became outraged at the things that had been taking place there, so dont think church (the temple) isnt important to God because it is. And Jesus didnt come for the righteous but for the sinner, and we are suppose to be Christ-like, so while u are seeking God for your salvation in that area go out and be the church, take the church to the streets and u never know what may manifest. And 1 more thing dont allow this 1 issue to consume ur desire to go to heaven, in order to get into heaven it will take a lot more than deciding if u should get up sunday morning and fellowship.

Don't sweat it .... it's all good.|`|IOKa47l4aa	Dude - categorizing yourself as a racist is the easy way out.  Don't let people do that to you.<br>  <br>  The truth is, there are different races and every race has taboos about relations outside of those races - whether they are taboos that will actually force people to respond or simply make people feel uncomfortable.  Some taboos exist within races simply between social classes - which can even be more taboo than another race.  This is just human nature.  What you are feeling is normal.<br>  <br>  You have to ask yourself three questions:<br>  <br>  1) If she finishes with this guy and comes back to you, what are you going to do?  Do you love her?  What would you do...but don't dwell on this because it might not happen.<br>  <br>  2) If she doesn't finish with this guy, are you going to hold it against him or express dislike for him?  He didn't do anything - he is just being a guy.<br>  <br>  3) Regardless of what happens, what are you doing to live your life.  If you were not in any formal union with this woman, nor did you have plans to enter into a formal union with her (such that you are going to go and fight for her, perhaps even literally) then you have to move on.  Live your life, be confident in yourself and start looking for other people in your life.  Do not just fill the void though with another woman just for the sake of filling the void.  Some people have even been quoted as saying it is better to remain alone (at least at times).  Fill the void with your career, your health (like fitness if you do not already), with your friends, your family and possibly most important...your faith.  (If you do not have one of those last ones - investigate.  Talk to your friends and those you trust.

AA10055448	There are many quality translations, and much good can be derived by consulting an array of translations during one's personal Bible study. Among them, a Christian should use at least one Bible which does not grossly disrespect the divine name of Almighty God.<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s Witnesses generally prefer “New World Translation” because it includes the divine name (“Jehovah” in English) in all of its nearly seven thousand occurrences (KJV, for example, only includes four). NWT was not completed until 1961, nearly a century after Jehovah’s Witnesses had recognized Bible truth from other translations and studies of the original language manuscripts.<br>  <br>  During the past twenty years or so Jehovah's Witnesses have concentrated on translating, publishing, and printing this day-to-day Bible in languages which may not have had a quality Bible, and especially a Bible which consistently respects the divine name of God (???? or YHWH or Jehovah).<br>  <br>  In 1989, 56 million copies of New World Translation had been distributed, in whole or in part in only 11 languages. By 1994, that had increased to 72 million in 18 languages. By 1997, it was 91 million in 27 languages. By 2000, it was 100 million in 34 languages, yet still only 80% of Jehovah's Witnesses had a NWT in their mother tongue.<br>  <br>  By 2002, it was 114 million in 42 languages. By 2006, New World Translation was available in whole or in part in FIFTY-EIGHT LANGUAGES. Jehovah's Witnesses had distributed over 140 million Bibles. Their work continues.<br>  <br>  In some of these languages, New World Translation is the ONLY Bible printed in a single volume. In other languages, NWT became the first new translation in perhaps a century (and perhaps the first quality translation). The entire text of NWT is freely available at the official website of Jehovah's Witnesses, and a personal printed copy can be requested at no charge.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses certainly like NWT, but they are happy to use any translation which an interested person may prefer, and in fact Jehovah's Witnesses themselves distribute other translations besides NWT. Jehovah's Witnesses attach no particular infallibility or inspiration to NWT.<br>  <br>  The "New World Translation Committee" which oversaw the translation work requested anonymity 'en perpetuity', and are likely all dead since the primary work was completed 45 years ago. Guesses at specific names have always been merely guesses. Since the same manuscripts used by the NWT translators are still widely available for study, and since there are dozens of alternate translations for comparison, anyone who chooses to use NWT does so informedly.<br>  <br>  It seems that the vast majority of the criticism against the New World Translation is actually as a proxy for blind hatred against Jehovah's Witnesses. The hatred must be "blind" since secular experts of biblical Hebrew and Greek have consistently refused to condemn any particular verse or phrase as an unacceptable translation. Instead, it is religionists with preconceived theologies who bigotedly insist upon particular wordings, since these are necessary to prop up the shaky tenets of their false worship.<br>  .. ..(2 Timothy 4:3-5) For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories. You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.<br>  <br>  It seems significant that the relatively small religion of Jehovah's Witnesses are the ones best known for their worldwide preaching work. Yet Jesus commanded that ALL who would call themselves "Christian" perform this public work:<br>  .. ..(Matthew 28:19,20) Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	The King James Version is closest to the original writings. |`|ridu0Rtwaa	The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!

This results in two undeniable facts<br>  a) bibles are not 100% accurate and precise in conveying the word of God - only languages that are *extremely* similar can translate "perfectly"<br>  b) different translators choose different words in their translation, and also differ in their sectarian biases, skills and education.  Therefore, no two translations of the same text (any text, of significant length) by different translators will be identical.<br>  <br>  So, no bible - not one - is a fully accurate and completely precise transmission (into English) of the word of God.  Still, those bibles produced by conscientious translators are, indeed, the closest possible transmission of the word of God that they were able to produce.  In other words, our English bibles - the scholarly translations, at least - are as close as we are able to get to the completely accurate and precise word of God in English.  Since most are unable *and* unwilling to develop accredited expertise in the translation of 3 ancient languages, this is the best that we have.  Naturally, some bibles can be identified as conveying the word of God into English less well (less accurately or precisely) than others.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) Sectarian differences<br>  <br>  Sectarian differences in bibles have very little, if any, affect on Christian doctrine.  Generally, the only real effect of sectarian differences in bibles is what scriptures are included.  For example, you will not find any significant Roman Catholic doctrine  - except *maybe* prayer for the dead - that depends primarily upon the deuterocanonical scriptures for scriptural support.<br>  <br>  There are, of course, specific instances when a sectarian bible *does* indicate a Christian doctrine in some way significantly different from other bibles.  In such a case, those bibles with the most well-respected translators (from a scholarly point of view) are those which should be given precedence.<br>  <br>  As for the Book of Mormon, from what I understand it has been shown quite conclusively that there are historic errors contained within it.  Not might be - but definitely (e.g. the mention of spring steel being in use prior to its invention).  There are scholarly books on the subject which can resolve this particular matter to your satisfaction.  Scriptures with *verifiable* error are, by definition, not inspired scriptures.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/</a>|`|UJtUpWO0aa	Only God can lead you to the truth you wish to know.

By comparing the letters and writings, and analyzing the writing styles, they were able to determine which ones were 'in sync' with the rest of the scriptures. Many of the writings were rejected, because they were found to be too 'fanciful'. The books of the Apocrypha, which are included in the Catholic Bible, though having some merit, were generally found to be little more than history books, without necessarily any 'divine' inspiration. The early church fathers did not feel these books were relevant or added to the collection of scripture that had been gathered, and so were omitted. Parts of the Apocrypha did not pass inspection, because of conflicts in the historical writings, such as giving the wrong name of the king of Babylon at a certain time period that had already been established by archaeologists. Since obvious historical errors were found, they did not deem them worthy enough to include. The Catholic Church chose to include them, but most scholars will tell you that the apocryphal books are little more than interesting reading.<br>         The canon was considered closed, with 66 books, meaning that no new writings were accepted by most of Christianity. As for the Mormons, the writings of Joseph Smith were found to be very inconsistent. None of the places or people mentioned in the book of Mormon has ever been found by an archeological dig, meaning there is absolutely no proof of authenticity. Even the 'golden tablets' that Joseph supposedly found that included all the new material were 'mysteriously lost' when it was inquired of him to produce them. The Bible has been authenticated by archeologists, who have found nearly all of the cities mentioned in the Bible, as well as every coin ever mentioned.<br>        The Jehovah Witnesses have changed the original Bible to fit their own theology- I wouldn't take stock in any church that changes the scripture to say what they want it to say. Stick with King James or any version of the original 66 book Bible, and you will find a consistent, accurate book that has lasted for nearly 2000 years, and has yet to be disproven.|`|QGzOMi3Gaa	The original Hebrew version. <br>  Even though God isn't real it's the first version of the Bible

I was not born in Mexico, however I have lots of latino culture.<br>  Don't worry, it is not your fault for being how you are, because you were raised differently.  However, since you are asking a specific question, all I can say is this:<br>  You can't simply 'change' your views on hispanics over night.  It comes subtly.  If you talk a lot more with other Mexican people, and you eat the cultural food, and at least try to listen to music in spanish, I am sure your view will change somewhat.<br>  But the very first thing that you need to do is to stop thinking that you or anyone else is better than any culture.  Because the world in general will look at you and see a mexican.  And they will judge you the way you judge the rest of your culture; generally lower than yourself and lower class.  That in itself is wrong.  Honestly, you need to take a deep breath, and realize who you are, and not who you were raised to be.  But you are not racist. <br>  <br>  Finally, I leave you with the note that I am full Mexican, and I am not lower or middle class.  I go to a private school, with many many others, most of whom are white.  And let me tell you, that every where you go, you are being labeled.  Why would you want someone else to think they are better than you? Smarter than you?  More deserving?  Don't label someone from your own roots.

bHqbaJJxaa	in the games , 封 usually means seal<br>  <br>  or close , border ,territory etc|`|ab12bf1cc4fcd2264e88fe8e2ee186f2aa	封 could be used in Chinese, Japanese kanji or Korean hanja. It's hard to tell the meaning without context. <br>  I'll attempt to explain using Chinese:<br>  "An envelope" = 一個信封, but 封 is never used alone as a noun for the word "envelope/ an envelope". It is from " 一個信封", that 封 came to be  used as a measure word for "a [written] letter" or 信, which is usually put in 'an envelope' to be sent out: "一 封信". <br>  <br>  There might be some confusions from the above. Let me clear it out: <br>  信封 = "envelope": 个(Simplified)/個(Traditional) must be used after the number.<br>  In 封信, 封 is the measure word, while 信 means "[written] letter":个/個  is not needed after the number. <br>   <br>  Used as a verb, it means "to seal; to close off": 被封. <br>  <br>  In ancient Chinese usage, 封 means "to grant", usually a piece of land,  to someone as a reward for works of merit: 封地. Here 地, is short for 土地, a piece or one lot of land: "lot" here is used like "parking lot" or "block & lot".  For 地 or 土地, 块 (Simplified)/塊(Traditional) is the measure word. 1 mu = 0.0667 hectares. mu = 亩(Simplified)/ 畝(Traditional) = could be used as the measurement for one lot of land:  一亩地/一畝地. <br>  <br>  封 used together with 面 can also mean "cover [page]", as in "The cover [page] of a magazine": 杂志封面(Simplified)/ 雜志封面(Traditional).|`|9ad429f608717088998322ace164fb04aa	In chinese this word is pronounced 'fēng' and it means 'an envelope'.
pbx9gkkUaa	Hello! Right now I'm living in China. I'm an American learning Mandarin at a Chinese University. There are some misconceptions, so hopefully I can help a bit.<br>  <br>  First of all, you won't need to learn to write characters necessarily. It really depends on the class that you take (if you go that route.) Most likely, you don't need to worry about writing characters unless you have a specific reason. These days, you can type characters out via computers or cell phones using pinyin. You will only need to know how to speak and read it properly.  If you decide to learn how to write characters, you need to learn stroke order, and there are over 75,000 characters in their language. If you want to just learn to read them, (which is a good idea, and is a much different process.) to read the newspaper you need to know about 2,500.<br>  <br>  I recommend Rosetta Stone: Mandarin, and going to a university. I don't recommend trying to learn by watching TV shows and movies because you simply will not learn the small important details regarding sentence structure and grammar through that method. You can always try, but I don't recommend this as a "learning strategy." I know for me, it does not help that much.<br>  <br>  If you have a lot of money, there is no better substitute than coming here to China and attending a university, although it's incredibly difficult. Chinese is an awesome language to know, and will look fantastic on a resume! (Especially if you learned it here in China!) Good luck.|`|wcZYjX9Faa	I dont know mandarin but make sure NOT to use translators<br>  <br>  When translating via translators the sentences often come up mispelled as it doesnt know the context and can come up with wrogn sentence form as it translates it word for word.<br>  <br>  In french the structure is different (like most languages) so to natives it would come up very strangely world like<br>  <br>  I my name Johanna instead of<br>  My name is Johanna|`|V3UsTvUsaa	Yup, i'm half chinese too and i can't read mandarin. <br>  The language is hard to learn because there is no alphabet, and so many different tones. The best way to learn mandarin would be to go to chinese school, and practice speaking heaps. Also try watching Chinese dramas with english subtitles.|`|hlKP3mnjaa	Learning to speak Chinese is not as hard as you think. <br>  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, Some Chinese schools and Chinese learning materials have given students the opposite impression. <br>  <br>  However, modern technology can aid in the learning process dramatically. Furthermore, most professionals will find that learning to speak Chinese will be enough without learning to write Chinese characters (which are what really takes up the most time). In the modern age, the computer can help you type anyway.<br>  <br>  <br>  Simplicities:<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Chinese has next to no grammatical inflections – it possesses no tenses, no voices, no numbers (though there are plural markers), only a few articles, and no gender. Words never change.<br>  <br>  2. If you know 1000 commonly used characters, you will recognize 90% of the characters on Chinese newspapers, 2500 for 97.97%. It takes only 3000 characters to read a newspaper and be considered literate.<br>  |`|c8b398523b581867f241a91a31ae843faa	you should at least studied in a Chinese school so that at least you would know the basics.  if you didn't studied in a Chinese school, try to enroll in a school which offers basic mandarin lesson, but some of the schools that i know requires the learner to know fookien (Chinese Hokkien) because some of the teachers use that language.<br>  <br>  you can also try to buy self-study books for Chinese Characters and Self-study CD/DVD for audio learning. <br>  <br>  visit some sites that offers Chinese Mandarin language.  have someone you know who can speak it to teach you, and practice speaking it.<br>  <br>  watching taiwan series or movies that uses Chinese Mandarin can help.<br>  <br>  when it comes to characters, yes it is complicated because there are at least 4000 characters for you to learn.<br>  <br>  if you are half Chinese, your parents should be able to know it, or your siblings.  if your parents don't know how to speak either, try to ask your friends (if you have Chinese friends) to teach you.|`|9ad429f608717088998322ace164fb04aa	Where are you from?

However I didn't get very far as my teacher wasn't fluent in english. If i had the option i would do it again though.<br>  So, to answer your question, find a good chinese teacher that speaks fluent english, I would not recommend the internet as it is not all ways <br>  trustworthy. <br>  I would take say that if you enjoy art, Mandarin is the language for you!|`|91aLf7Cfaa	I am asian american and I speak fluent chinese<br>  (wo shi mei ji hua ren, wo hui shuo zhong wen)<br>  <br>  I can't read and write all the chinese characters, so I go to chinese school.

The Jews believe it will come before 2240 AD.  That's over two hundred years from now.  Many signs written in the Bible have been fulfilled so the time is approaching.  When the Beast of the Sea (Revelation 13:2-10) comes preaching unity and offering a peace treaty with Israel then be concerned.  Otherwise be a good Christian and love the Lord with all your heart, mind and souls and love your neighbor.

(not quite exact, but you get the idea) there are instructions to the christian following to not plant or harvest crops, worry about wealth, or even get married, because you would want to be ready when Jesus came back. they just sat and prayed, and even kept shifts of watches as they waited for what they were sure was his imminent return. 2000 years later, he still hasn't come back. think about it, time is nothing to God since he is outside of it. a billion years could pass, the Earth could be rotting away and we would still be waiting for the revelation.<br>  I personally and sure that i will be dead and gone long before a definite apocalypse is within sight.|`|YbXPnua0aa	well the disciples thought that the lord was coming back in there day. that was some 2000 years ago. they were pretty far off we can be too.

We are commanded in Philippians 4:6 to "...not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."  We should be bringing all of these concerns to God instead of worrying about them.<br>  <br>  To overcome worry, we are instructed in 1 Peter 5:7 to "cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you."  GOD CARES FOR YOU.  No worry is too small or too big for his attention.  When we give God our problems and worries, he promises peace that passes understanding. (Phil. 4:7).<br>  <br>  Those who do not know the Savior will have worry and anxiety as part of their lives.  Jesus promised to those who have given their lives to him, "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." (Matt. 11: 28-30)|`|6lJuKKMHaa	The Lord God said to "FEAR NOT"!  (Look up, you redemption draws nigh!)  Just hangon to Him/Jesus and you WILL be with Him soon! Just keep the FAITH!

This is the faith that saves. This is eternal life.<br>  <br>  "Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for. <br>   By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead. <br>  <br>   By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away.

I totally sympathise with you, and if he's still only seeing the 'glory' or being at war then there is no way he's mature enough to be totally committed.<br>  <br>  However, basic training is very, very hard. The army has to make sure not only that potential soldiers are fit enough to fight, but also that they are strong enough mentally to handle war.<br>  <br>  When I was seventeen, a friend of mine joined the army, so I do know pretty well the sorts of things they have to go through, and when I say it's tough, I mean it! Basic training gives soldiers a taste of what's to come, though obviously nothing can compare to actually being on the front line.<br>  <br>  My friend says that joining the army was the best thing she ever did, and I'm inclined to agree with her. She got put through college, got a driving license and now she's a helicopter mechanic. <br>  <br>  I say let him join up, if that's what he wants. If he's truly dedicated to it then he'll be living his dream with the knowledge that his mother supported him, and if he's not then he'll wash out in basic training and there'll be no harm done.

It shows people who have been at war and how it affected them. These people talk about the war and about the music they listened to during that war. Very insightful and very emotional. At the end of the documentary you see a group of new recruits going to war, obviously ignorant of what is going to come. If you can get him to see this documentary (no idea if that is an option) and give him no permission after that, maybe it will work. Or at least sow some doubt, so that he might change his mind before he doesn't need your permission anymore. Keeping your child out of a war (that 99 out of a 100 times is immoral anyway) is the most moral thing to do. Good luck.|`|79632f5cafa59cc02272fe8777999b37aa	no i wouldn't.

sZ3nGSNNaa	This is how you get saved:<br>  <br>  <br>  Romans 10<br>  <br>  8But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,"[d] that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: 9That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. 11As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame."[e] 12For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 13for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."[f]<br>  <br>  John 3<br>  16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,[f] that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.[g] 19This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God."[h]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus will exonerate you of all transgressions when he died on the Cross read this:<br>  <br>  1 Timothy 2:5<br>  For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,<br>  <br>  1 Thessalonians 5:9<br>  For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Those who oppose Jesus or do not believe in him read this:<br>  <br>  <br>  1 John 2<br>  <br>  22Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist—he denies the Father and the Son. 23No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <br>  <br>  1 Timothy 6<br>  <br>  3If anyone teaches false doctrines and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 4he is conceited and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions 5and constant friction between men of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain. <br>  <br>  2 John 1:7<br>  Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.<br>  <br>  Jude 1:4<br>  For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men, who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only sovereign and Lord.<br>  <br>  <br>  Beware of False Prophets and Teachers Claiming to be Christ:<br>  <br>  Matthew 24<br>  <br>  3As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" <br>  4Jesus answered: "Watch out that no one deceives you. 5For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,[a]' and will deceive many.<br>  <br>  23At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. 24For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect—if that were possible. 25See, I have told you ahead of time. <br>  26"So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. 27For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. <br>  <br>  Many of Your friends and parents will hate you and persecute you for coming to Jesus but do not despair:<br>  <br>  Luke 21<br>  <br>  12"But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name. 13This will result in your being witnesses to them. 14But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves. 15For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. 16You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death. 17All men will hate you because of me. 18But not a hair of your head will perish. 19By standing firm you will gain life. <br>  <br>  Luke 12<br>  <br>  49"I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! 50But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed! 51Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. 52From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three. 53They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."<br>  <br>  Matthew 24<br>  <br>  9"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.<br>  <br>  But read this for encouragement:<br>  <br>  Matthew 5<br>  <br>  11"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 12Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Jesus is God.

The message of the Bible is abundantly clear. We have all sinned against God (Romans 3:23). Because of our sin, we deserve to be eternally separated from God (Romans 6:23). Because of His love for us (John 3:16), God took on human form and died in our place, taking the punishment that we deserve (Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 5:21). God promises forgiveness of sins and eternal life in heaven to all who receive, by grace through faith, Jesus Christ as Savior (John 1:12; 3:16; 5:24; Acts 16:31).|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	Romans Road to Christ<br>  <br>  <br>  Romans<br>  3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>  <br>  6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>  <br>  5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<br>  <br>  10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br>  <br>  10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.|`|v93T1z2Aaa	Islam honors all the prophets who were sent to mankind. Muslims respect all prophets in general, but Jesus in particular, because he was one of the prophets who foretold the coming of Muhammad. Muslims, too, await the second coming of Jesus. They consider him one of the greatest of Allah's prophets to mankind. A Muslim does not refer to him simply as "Jesus," but normally adds the phrase "peace be upon him" as a sign of respect. <br>  <br>  No other religion in the world respects and dignifies Jesus as Islam does. The Quran confirms his virgin birth (a chapter of the Quran is entitled "Mary"), and Mary is considered to have been one of the purest women in all creation. The Quran describes Jesus' birth as follows: <br>  <br>   "Behold!' the Angel said, God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and in the Hereafter, and one of those brought near to God. He shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and he shall be of the righteous. She said: "My Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: "Even so; God creates what He will. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, 'Be!' and it is." [Noble Quran 3:42-47] <br>  <br>  Muslims believe that Jesus was born immaculately, and through the same power which had brought Eve to life and Adam into being without a father or a mother. <br>  <br>   "Truly, the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was." [Noble Quran 3:59] <br>  <br>  During his prophetic mission, Jesus performed many miracles. The Quran tells us that he said: <br>  <br>   "I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by God's leave. And I heal the blind, and the lepers, and I raise the dead by God's leave." [Noble Quran 3:49] <br>  <br>  Muhammad and Jesus, as well as the other prophets, were sent to confirm the belief in one God. This is referred to in the Quran where Jesus is reported as saying that he came: <br>  <br>   "To attest the law which was before me, and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me." <br>  [Noble Quran 3:50] <br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of Jesus by saying: "Whoever believes there is no god but Allah, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is a servant and messenger of God, His word breathed into Mary and a spirit emanating from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven.

TrAPvaiNaa	Hola Lorena. Dios dice en su palabra, el que cree en mi vivira, pero el que cree en mi y me ama tendra vida eterna. No basta con creer en jesús, sino hacer de su palabra vida en cada una de las cosas que hacemos dia con dia. Dios te "juzga" en el Amor, sin dogmas especificos., pero es infinitamente misericordioso, pero tambien, es infinitamente justo.

(Heb. 10:26-39)  It's difficult to explain one verse out of context.<br>  <br>  Heb. 10:36  For you have need of endurance (Gr. hupomeno-to stay under, bear (trials), endure) so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise.<br>  <br>  Author again warns his hearers that there is no going back to Judaism because there remains no more sacrifices for them.  These people have remained with the believers and know the truth but not unto salvation.  Author reminds them of what they have already suffered for being with the believers and not to cast away their confidence which has great reward.  In other words, these people are straddling the fence.  They can't go back to Judaism and they aren't yet willing to completely trust Christ as their Savior where their only hope remains.<br>  <br>  Heb. 10:28  Anyone who has rejected Mose's law dies without mercy in the testimony of two or three witnesses.  29  Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counting the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?  30  For we know Him who said, "Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the LORD.  And again, the LORD will judge His people."  31  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  32  But recall the former days in which, after you were ILLUMINATED, you endured a great struggle with sufferings:  33  partly while you were made a spectacle bot by reproaches (insults) and tribulations, and partly while you became companions (of believers) of those who were so treated (thrown back);  34  for you had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your good, knowing that you have a better and an enduring possession for yourselves in heaven.  35  Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward.|`|uFAoq4idaa	Patience is important for us Christians in our daily walk with God.

Peace to you.|`|MXYWSsM7aa	Patience is very important in our daily walk but oftentimes it's not something that I like to pray for because I know that if I do(which I do) then I will have to go through the process of learning it. It's tough and it's necessary. The one prayer that I lift up to the Lord is the prayer that says "judge me now, O Lord." That prayer always brings me through the ringer but at the end I know that that judging has given me a little more patience and I am closer to receiving that Crown. And that's where this verse comes in. The author of Hebrews is saying that when we do the will of God we will receive that promise. That promise here is talking about rewards just like that crown is a reward. 2 Tim. 4:8. James 1:12. 1Peter 5:4. Rev. 2:10. Rev.3:11.<br>  When we run that race with patience then we will receive that reward. And who is this patience? All scripture is relative and points to Christ who is the center of all things pertaining to God. He is the center of the Universe. Christ is that patience.<br>  You want patience, ask for Jesus. You want Love, pray to receive Jesus. You want healing ask for the Healer, Jesus.

They are scientifically illiterate and scientifically indifferent. They tell you that they do look at the scientific evidence - and then proceed immediately to demonstrate their absolute ignorance of the method and the evidence.    Since they already believe that they know the divine truth, they see no need to take contradicting real-world evidence seriously. Or, if they take it seriously, it is only because they think Satan is behind it.    =========    stotlerdavid --    You are right that we do not know the physics of the universe prior to the instant following the Big Bang - because the intense light from the explosion is blocking our view.     Hence, the current debates about string theory, multiverses, etc., resulting from our inability to design and conduct strightforward experiments.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|3mDvjCa8aa	You thinking you'll go on forever is your ego talking.

AA11058044	If you're looking for unbiased opinions, scholarly textbooks are going to be your only option.<br>  <br>  Even then, many of them will have inherent biases.  It may take you quite a bit of study to even learn enough about the topic to determine which ones are biased, and how.<br>  <br>  It's an interesting topic, but not one that lends itself well to superficial skimming.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Scholarly texts are a good option.  It's an interest of mine, too.  There's a lot of good stuff out there.  I started with The Oxford History of Christianity, one more general history that I can't put my hand on right now, then moved on to Bart Ehrman, who covers the early years in greater detail.  I also found plenty of other books through my library search service.|`|6RCHJQfQaa	The best book I have seen is a book called "The Faith, A History of Christianity" by Brian Moynahan.  I have read several Christian history books and this one is by far the best I have read.  It is about 800 pages and covers all of the last 2000 years.  It begins with a short chapter on the life of Jesus with Biblical reference and other references, the life of the Apostles and Paul, the first Christians, the early Martyrs and then it flows through the centuries and into the early 21st Century.  There is an chapter on Islam and it's effect on Christianity.  It is totally unbiased and seem really factual.  The parts of Christianity that is good it states as such.  The parts that are bad it states as such.  There is no hidden agenda in this book, no denominational or doctrinal bias and no down playing of events.  Trust me this is the best book out there for the history of Christianity.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	When it comes to religion, everything is biased. My best advice to you is read from both sides.<br>  <br>  And, go straight to the source.. here is a book of collected writings from the EARLY early Church fathers:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Early-Christian-Writings-Apostolic-Classics/dp/0140444750/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235168614&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Early-Christian-Wr...</a>|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	You can try the Gnostic Gospels.  They tell the story of Jesus without the racism, male chauvenism, and homophobia of the early church authors of the 3rd Century, particularly the biases of the Apostle Paul.  Today's Christians basically attribute their faith to the apostle paul, a very scary character who used to execute christians until he found out it was far more profitable to destroy christianity from within with a little help from homophobia, racism, and male chauvenism.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	In a book store that doesn't exist, next to Schubert's unfinished symphony and down the hall from instructions on how to square circles but before you get to the section devoted to diet books that actually work.|`|AA11606721	Asimov's Guide to the Bible  by Isaac Asimov, Rafael Palacios<br>  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=B0V-AAAAMAAJ&dq=asimov+%22guide+to+the+bible" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=B0V-AAA...</a>|`|waz8ONEEaa	in all honesty, you probably wont.<br>  <br>  you have to read all sides of the issue. that's the only way to get even half a detailed picture of it.|`|VJN6Bvloaa	Good luck with that.

X9rXRNUxaa	We<br>  <br>  are not evolving - in fact we are devolving !<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|AA12203324	Evolution is merely the description of what happens when genetic mutation meets environmental change.  It is not a plan for development, it is an explanation for the development.  So nothing evolves "into" anything.  It's simply a matter of what survives in the environment it finds itself in.  If an environment is stable, random genetic variations will not produce any significant change in a species.  But if there is a sudden shift in temperature, weather, food supply, predation, and any number of environmental factors, some mutations may suddenly become more durable than the old standard genes.<br>  <br>  I would like my children and grand children to be best adapted to the environment they will end up living in, whatever that may be.  If climate change is occurring, I might like them to be more tolerant of higher temperatures, greater doses of ultraviolet radiation, an atmosphere containing more greenhouse gasses, and any other environmental change that may occur.  Evolution is a kind of customization, but we are not the customer.  We are the product.|`|WalnRzfGaa	we would have to still be evolving. we may be making our environment more suited for us, but we are doing things to our bodies that are not natural.  We will become less and less resistant to diseases because our bodies get medicine all the time, our brains will continue to grow and develope because we still eat meat and use them a lot. we will most likely lose organs that are useless like the appendix, gallbladder and pinky toe.<br>  <br>  these are things i would think we would eventually evolve into. this will of course be over the course of hundreds of thousands of years.<br>  <br>  anyone that says we are no longer evolving does NOT understand evolution.|`|AA10556726	All species are evolving, it is a continual process.

Considering how humanity has come to the point where we adapt our environment to us, and breeding is no longer determined by the survivability of the species, I find it likely that our evolution will slow, and we'll cease to adapt to the natural environment, and begin to adapt to our self-constructed environment.<br>  <br>  However, the unhealthy lifestyles reinforced by our technology, I believe, will lead to a gradual decline of our biological success as a species, and, barring some great leaps of evolution in our immune systems and metabolisms, lead to our extinction (albeit perhaps over hundreds of thousands of years).|`|4VouLn4waa	Evolution occurs so that we can survive, Apes evolved into humans because because all the desirable traits.

Once people realized there was nothing there was probably a split second during which the Earth plummeted downwards before someone realized that something was holding them up before and that a turtle would explain it all nicely. In that instant a cosmic turtle composed of pure belief appeared and halted our brief descent, undoubtedly triggering a few large earthquakes.

This is exactly why Jesus DID leave someone here as an authority just like St. Peter and has passed that authority down through the ages. The real Pope.|`|1UokhVRXaa	No gaps to fill in.  All you need to know is there.    2 Timothy 3:16-17  (16)  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:  (17)  That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
aV3bFchtaa	Certainly there was no necessity of Gods part to have to do this; after all His word was sufficient. Why did God do this? He interposed with an oath, in order that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have strong encouragement. He did it to show how much encouragement of hope he wants us to have! So God added an oath to a promise.    When you want to stress the validity of your promise, you pick out something of great value, such as the Bible or God, and you swear by it. When a witness gives his testimony in a court of law, he binds himself to an oath, swearing to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth "so help me God." That kind of testimony is used to determine innocence or guilt in legal matters, because what you are saying in an oath is this: If I prove false, if I am lying, then let God be false or let the Bible be condemned. So to the degree that you value and esteem the basis of your oath, to that  degree your word can be trusted. Then the writer looks at the way God took his oath and he says, For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself. It is as if God is saying, I want to give my people strong encouragement so I will add an oath to my promise to show them how much I want to undergird their hope. When God wanted to swear an oath, there was nothing greater that He could swear upon than Himself! There is one thing he values and esteems above all. He alone has a dignity and honor and worthiness that is beyond all other values, and so God swears by Himself. "Since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself. What God is saying in swearing by Himself is that should He will break His word of promise to bless us, then He will despise Himself. God is the greatest value in the universe. There is nothing more valuable or wonderful than God. So God swears by God, and in doing that he says; I mean for you to have as much confidence in me as it is possible to have. He did this in order that He might give to you and to me strong encouragement in your hope. Now this is our God: the God who is reaching as high as He can reach to inspire your unshakable hope.     Robert M. Norris|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Because He is the truth.

He knew God would provide an alternative to Isaac, yet even if He did, He still loved and had great faith in God. He trusted God.     Therefore God saw Abraham's great faith and belief in Him so He assured Abraham that He will indeed keep His promise about blessing Abraham and that Abraham would indeed be the Father of Many Nations. Which God did as Abraham indeed became a Father of Many Nations. God always keeps His promises.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	As it says elsewhere in the BIble 'having none Higher to swear by'

6N47TXvsaa	Azerbaijanis people are tolerant toward diversity of religion. They do believe that people are not supposed to have either the same religion or origin. This is what you may not encounter with in some of the Islamic countries e.g. Iran where people such as wahhabies are deemed to be a potential threat for the Islamic regime. Azerbaijan, in spite of being populated with 96% Muslims is devoid of any sort of conservatism. <br>  <br>  Azerbaijan, despite many Muslim countries has adopted a middle road policy which has promoted this country to a crossroad between East-West and north-South. Azerbaijan has succeeded in developing cordial relationships with many countries around the world, though Azerbaijanis foreign policy has turned this country into a significant regional player. It is note worthy of mentioning that Azerbaijan is the EU’s hope for diversifying energy reliance on Russian gas which is almost a blunt instrument to put pressure on West.<br>  <br>  Azerbaijan has acceded to UN resolutions. Although 20% of Azerbaijanis land has been occupied by Armenian forces but Azerbaijan still remains compliant with global preference of crisis prevention by not staging war against occupiers.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Idk...what is so great about Azerbaijan?

AA11025703	Yes to ALL 4 of your queries.<br>  <br>  I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and Died laughing the 2? times jokes about Witnesses were made.<br>  <br>  Yeardly Smith has said one of her favorite things about working on The Simpson's is that they will "go after" Everything and Everyone.<br>  <br>  I think allot of the Episodes with Ned put both him, and Christians in a rather good light.  Even when an episode is being rather mean to poor Ned, I am usually doing a Sophia Petrillo<br>  <br>  "I laughed until I peed, then I laughed at that"<br>  <br>  To a large Extent Ned Flanders was originally just a comic foil for Homer, he was Homer's oposite in Sooo many ways.<br>  <br>  He didn't cheat, lie, steal, etc. and Was still happy in his life.<br>  <br>  One of my favorite episodes was about a Meteor coming to Earth.  Ned builds a bomb shelter.  When the Meteor will soon be hitting the Earth, Homer and family come banging on the door.  Ned not only invited him in, but had already stocked enough food for Both the Simpson family and the Flanderinos.<br>  <br>  However, as time draws short, most/all of the Town is inside Ned's shelter.  They realise they need one person to leave, so Homer volunteers Ned to die.<br>  <br>  Ned agrees, out of love.  Moved by his love the Whole town leaves the shelter.  When the "rock of doom" finally reaches Springfield, it ends up being rather small, only destroying the Shelter.<br>  <br>  Because of Ned's Nedness, the entire town was saved.|`|AA11942055	Christians come with all personalities, and I'm sure there are Flanders out there, though no one person can represent a whole group.  I do find that the Simpsons seriously misrepresents Christianity, though.  Things like "if you never break the ten commandments, then you'll go to heaven" is inaccurate.  We have all sinned and come short of the glory of God, which is why we need forgiveness.  And the episode where the Simpson kids are living with the Flanders and are forced to be baptized, including Maggie is all wrong too, since a forced baptism or that of a baby who is too young to understand is pointless and not supported by the Bible (though the Catholic church does it), and clearly, the Flanders are not Catholic.  I used to watch the Simpsons, and I would tell myself that it is a satire and makes fun of everybody, but I did feel convicted that I shouldn't watch it, and one day, they just went too far, and I finally listened.  I haven't watched it since.  There was something about a rocket shooting up in the air and "punching the face of God", to quote Homer.   It may be a satire, but Matt Groening clearly has a particular beef with Christianity.<br>  <br>  WhyNotAskDrZaius: I haven't seen that episode, but if there is one thing I know, atheists misrepresent a Christian's so called reaction to evolution.  It is not, and will never be proven, we are not threatened by it in the least, and even if God had created the world through evolution, well, that still would make more sense than a "Big Bang" that happened for no particular reason, and that "magically" created life.

You have friends, you like to be with them, everybody going one place -- it's all good.  I used to go with my wife to Catholic services and not do communion or make the sign of the cross or repeat the prayers, until she stopped going.  As long as the priest's homily didn't go on forever, it was sometimes enjoyable :)<br>  <br>  Do whatever you like, if you enjoy the time with your friends then go.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	It is not unusual for persons of different (or no) faiths to go to services that are not according to their theological bent, or, as in your case, there is no common ground between friends that attend together.  So, there really is nothing wrong with attending services with your friend.  <br>  <br>  As to the common Christian festivals that have made such an impact on most European Christian nations, by which they regulate their law sittings, &c, you must do what you feel is suitable for you.  there are no rules about these matters.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  QUILL|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	No it's not weird at all.<br>  <br>  You are no longer bound by what you can and can't do.  There are no rules in atheism.<br>  <br>  So you go to the services with your friends if you want to, and celebrate Christmas and Easter if you want to.    Sometimes it's interesting to view religion from a different perspective, from an atheist viewpoint.<br>  <br>  There's no law to say you can't.   Do what feels right for you.|`|1WisnX8naa	Nope, it's whatever you make of it.<br>  <br>  I attend occasionally with my wife. It's just a day out with her...<br>  <br>  I've also helped with it's maintenance and watched kids for some of the congregation so the parents can go out shopping around Christmas.<br>  <br>  Most have no idea that I'm an atheist, those that do just laughingly refer to me as 'the heathen'...  no biggy...<br>  <br>  I celebrate the holidays because they are holidays and fun. I don't particularly care what they are called...|`|AA10011095	No, 90% of religion in America has nothing to do with the supernatural.  It's about celebration, and family, etc...<br>  <br>  The irony is that many religious folk mock athiests for not being religious when in many cases it's their insistence on stressing the supernatural and the literal interpretation of myth that drives them away.|`|oVHFz52Laa	Many atheists attend the church with their spouses or friends. If you became atheist recently, I think that you never had a personal relationship with Jesus. You have been going to the church out of habit, but you have not made your personal choice.<br>  <br>  I have been there too. I thought I was a Christian but if I was, I was only a baby Christian and when was time to mature up, I gave up. It is not easy to serve God who has some demands for you. It is easier to say that He does not exist.|`|2rJwgk40aa	Not at all.Ive been to church many times.I went with my aunt once.I also celebrate Holidays.There no such thing as "normal".Do what you enjoy doing.You have very right to go where you please.If some people wanna make you feel like you don't belong there,well boo to them.Who is anyone to say you cant go somewhere?|`|ItjUfDplaa	No, it's not weird if you enjoy being there with your friends.<br>  <br>  Do whatever you want. Being an atheist simply means that you are not a deist. <br>  That's all there is to it.|`|ypVQlOJvaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  It's nice of you to keep them company.<br>  <br>  .|`|84nXWNT3aa	That depends mostly on, whether you're a closeted atheist, or not. Some still go to religious stuff because they haven't ever brought up their atheism, others do it because they know nothing else. While, of course we have the ones who despise it. <br>  <br>  As for Christmas, I don't even call it Christmas. All I do is put up a pretty pagan tree and give gifts to friends and family. Oh, and eat cake decorated in red and green. Nothing to do with religion.<br>  <br>  Easter, I have nothing to do with. It's just there. I don't even think about it. <br>  <br>  If you want to hang out with people who don't share your beliefs, that's fine. <br>  <br>  Atheism is nothing more than not believing in a God or Gods. We don't have special rules.<br>  <br>  We choose them for ourselves.<br>  <br>  If you want to celebrate things and do what your friends are doing, go do it.|`|95a054862f66114bc2215248c4e68b98aa	No, in fact, atheists should go to church more often than theists because they ought to know that true religion and spirituality is not about a guy up there looking down on the guys down here, but it is about mental exercising just like the body needs physical exercising. There is no guy up there, just we guys down there and we should go to church more often just for the pure fun of it, like we go to Disney and Las Vegas and those places. Hell, atheists can even preach, pray and take communion! Doesn't change a thing or make a difference, anyway.|`|Wm24YP6caa	It's perfectly "normal" (although I agree that everything is relative so it is hard to define normalcy). It's especially fine if you're young because you don't know everything yet so don't worry about what your beliefs on everything are for the moment. If it's something you've always participated in, and you want to continue with it, then by all means do so.|`|9wiiBmBBaa	Christmas is now a very diverse holiday, now more for family and love than faith.

Normalcy is relative.|`|TdKGXVLAaa	I see where you're getting at.<br>  <br>  The thing is there is actually nothing wrong in going to services if you don't believe in it. Maybe your mind just wants to stay because it feels comfortable, since you've been doing this for a long time. <br>  <br>  The thing about Christmas and Easter, I know people who are not atheists and basically just celebrate Christmas for the sake of it being a holiday.<br>  <br>  Why don't you try exploring new religions and see what you find. <br>  This is my personal opinion because I find it strange how people do not believe in anything<br>  Don't you ever wonder how this whole world came into form and how life started.

However it is good question as homo sapiens evolved in East Africa and spread all over the world.

It does say, "After this Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she had to become the mother of everyone living," at Genesis 3:20. <br>  <br>  Since all races were said to come from them, it can only mean that they were "mongrels," that is, mixed breeds.

For example, Skin color is determined by the amount and type of melanin, the pigment in the skin. Variation in skin color is largely due to genetics. As a general pattern people with ancestors from tropical regions (hence greater sunlight exposure) have darker skin than people with ancestors from subtropical regions. This is far from a hard and fast rule however, because many light skinned groups have managed to survive at the equator by way of social adaptation. The same can be said of dark skinned groups living at subtropical latitudes.|`|fESoEbgzaa	they had all the genes for all the different races and different looks<br>  <br>  overtime the 'gene pool' for everybody has narrowed down to a very small number, that is why you cannot reproduce with a close relative, the gene pool is too small and could cause defects in the child.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	evolution of dark skin is intrinsically linked to the loss of body hair in humans. By 1.2 million years ago, all people having descendants today had the same receptor protein of today's Africans; their skin was dark, and the intense sun killed off the progeny with any lighter skin that resulted from mutational variation in the receptor protein.[5] This is significantly earlier than the speciation of Homo sapiens from Homo erectus some 250,000 years ago.<br>  <br>  Dark skin helps protect against skin cancer that develops as a result of ultraviolet light radiation, causing mutations in the skin.[citation needed] Furthermore, dark skin prevents an essential B vitamin, folate, from being destroyed. Therefore, in the absence of modern medicine and diet, a person with dark skin in the tropics would live longer, be healthier and likelier to reproduce than a person with light skin. White Australians have some of the highest rates of skin cancer as evidence of this expectation.[6] Conversely, as dark skin prevents sunlight from penetrating the skin it hinders the production of vitamin D3. Hence when humans migrated to less sun-intensive regions in the north, low vitamin D3 levels became a problem and lighter skin colors started appearing. The people of Europe, who have low levels of melanin, naturally have an almost colorless skin pigmentation, especially when untanned. This low level of pigmentation allows the blood vessels to become visible and gives the characteristic pale pink color of white people. The primary difference in skin color between blacks and whites is however a minor genetic difference accounting for just one letter in 3.1 billion letters of DNA.[7]|`|gGd3v3M5aa	There is only one race..|`|9wiiBmBBaa	Spreading to different continents.

ZFllYTlpaa	A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. <br>  <br>  <br>  Proverbs 18:24, New International Version <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      Close spiritual friends -- the kind that can hold us accountable when we need it, build us up when we're down, or celebrate with us when we've enjoyed success -- are truly rare. So many people are lonely; they're lonely for something, or better yet, someone, they've never experienced. We have a tendency in modern western culture to have acquaintances and companions instead of friends and partners. When things go poorly, when we have nothing to offer to them, acquaintances can run away in times of trouble or fade away if things are long and protracted. There are, however, true friends whose commitment and dedication are deeper than even physical family. How do I know? God promised it! I've seen it! My family has been blessed by it! So let's hear the call to be that kind of friend to others and in so doing, we will often find that kind of friend for ourselves.|`|zuyrHoc9aa	Proverbs 18:24|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Book of Proverbs, was reading it this week.

My personal view of deity is that there is energy, a life force if you will, and we each have  a spark of that within us - a lot of the constructs that we place round deities, are our own human attempts to understand the world and our place in it.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you talk to lots of people, read lots of comparative religion, read, and educate yourself about religion, natural philosophy, sociology, history, astronomy, and many other inter related topics, and see how your thoughts and your views alter<br>  <br>  I wish you the very best on the most exciting journey<br>  <br>  Halcon :-))|`|YPtNr2O6aa	Im pretty sure there is no god, in fact i live my life with the assumption that there isn't one.

Therefor life has to come from life.  Therefor, in the beginning, there had to be something living to give life.  So I personally believe that this "proves" that there is some sort of God.  If I believe there is some sort of God, I need to look at Godly belief systems.  (I do not believe any of today's religions have it perfect)  All the belief systems say that God is perfect.  God is the Almighty, the Divine Spirit, the Father of Creation.  <br>  <br>  Now I look at what these perfect gods do.  <br>  <br>  This is where I make my decision.<br>  <br>  Every religion in the world says that you can be acceptable to a PERFECT God by doing something.  You must either do good works, attain a certain status, or sacrifice something.  <br>  <br>  Everyone in the world is imperfect and there is no way to change that.  So how could we ever do something to be acceptable to a perfect God?  It doesn't make sense.  Nothing about any of that is logical.<br>  <br>  Christianity at it's core (thought it is not necessarily taught this way) is the only religion that says all you have to do to be accepted by this perfect God is accept Him.  Accept who this God is, and He accepts you.  <br>  <br>  I can't answer why God does what He does, but again, Christianity says that this God loves us all no matter what race, religion, sex, or any other variable.  It's a shame that it's not taught the way Jesus taught it back in the day.<br>  <br>  He accepted people gay or straight of any walk of life, and I think we should all be able to do the same.  <br>  <br>  ...whew*|`|M4WIWMgBaa	No/atheist.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	You mean, Do you believe in (A) god?

Especially as a homosexual man who can't understand how god created me when it is supposedly so wrong!<br>  <br>  So I will share - I'm a Satanist (not the LaVey kind who believes that Satan doesn't actually exist).  What that basically comes down to is natural morality of the kind we'd all agree with, plus the fact that Satan exists, loves us just as we are, and doesn't want to suppress our natural inclinations as god does - that is SO damaging.  This might sound scary to you but I do feel his presence when I invoke Him, and the results are rather like classical accounts of demon possession but it really is comforting to me - to know that he meets with me in a way god never did when I was a Christian.<br>  <br>  Christianity, of the catholic kind or any other kind, really does seem to rely on us not thinking too much about it.

That is your opinion that there is "no way of knowing if there is really a god." I know there is a God because I have a personal relationship with Him. <br>  God didn't make homosexuals that way. It is a choice. If they repent of it, they will be forgiven, and saved from it. It's a sin, just like any other sin. God gives them a way out, but they refuse to take it. No one in the Bible says the earth is flat. <br>  The Bible was written by men INSPIRED by God through the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  AnnD--I am also Baptist. Why doesn't your church preach ABOUT hell?

Sometimes I feel like an atheist, and sometimes I pray, usually the Lord's Prayer from the Bible.<br>  <br>  Whether there is a God or not, I do think that human beings think about God in many, many different ways and also use religious ideas to pursue some very human goals.  Whether that's good or bad, I don't know; I think it can sometimes be the one, sometimes the other. <br>  <br>  For instance, we all know that people can go to war in the name of religion and work themselves up into hating the enemy and annihilating them, supposedly in the service of God.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, there have been saints and holy people in many different religions -- Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism are the ones I think of - who have insisted that we have a religious duty to be compassionate towards everywhere.<br>  <br>  The Christian New Testament even quotes Jesus as supposedly saying, "turn the other cheek," "love your enemies," "blessed are the peacemakers," and "he who lives by the sword, shall die by the sword."<br>  <br>  So we can see some people citing "the will of God" to justify war and violence, and others also citing "the will of God" to call for peace & love.<br>  <br>  I think there are many elements of many different religions that are somewhat like this.  For example, there were Jewish prophets in the Old Testament (e.g. Amos, Micah, Isaiah) who seem to have interpreted God's will as demanding compassion towards the poor.<br>  <br>  There were some Christian heretical groups in the Middle Ages -- for example, the radical wing of the Hussites in Czechoslovakia in the early 1400s -- who argued that God's will was for the poor believers to overthrow the rich and the nobility and to establish some kind of religious communism.<br>  <br>  Some Christian religious traditions -- Catholicism in the Middle Ages, for example -- tended at times to be very critical of merchants and other businessmen whose goal in life was making money.  <br>  <br>  However, Protestants who followed the ideas of John Calvin mostly had decided by the 1600s or 1700s that all religious people had a chosen profession or "calling" ordained by God, and that making money in your "calling" was almost a religious duty, so long as you didn't spend the money on making life comfortable for yourself.<br>  <br>  Then there have been some religions that taught the "duty" of human sacrifice and child sacrifice, while some rival religions (for example, Judaism and Christianity and Islam) have all taught that human sacrifice is wrong.<br>  <br>  The German philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach, as I understand him, concluded that all or nearly all religious thought is just regular human thought, rules that people have made up for themselves and each other, but rules that they then attribute to God.  <br>  <br>  I think that Feuerbach may be right -- and that if he is right, then we ordinary humans need to appreciate what an amazing range of different moral behaviors we are capable of.  <br>  <br>  What Feuerbach suggests is that in one way or another, we are creatures who managed to think up all of the many, many different actions and beliefs and moral ideas that we normally attribute to God -- holy wars and contributions to hospitals, ideas of hell and ideas of salvation, the importance of stern moral judgment and the importance of love and forgiveness, etc.<br>  <br>  That makes religion a pretty awesome repository of human thinking, I believe, although of course being amazing does not have to make  religion "true."<br>  <br>  OTOH -- I still do say the Lord's Prayer some mornings, and I think that some of my best moral ideas are ideas that I first heard about in the Bible.   What I try not to do is look to the Bible or to any church for teachings that will "justify" hatred of homosexuals, or discrimination against women, or holy war against unbelievers.  <br>  <br>  I cherry-pick the Bible verses I like, which I used to think was a terrible thing to do when others did it.|`|ueP6VXevaa	If someone accused you of being unkind and a murderer right before someone else and you have the power to kill both of them, what would you do.<br>  <br>  1.  If you killed the one who accused you, wouldn't that make his accusations correct? <br>  <br>  2. If you killed both, you would have left no witness and your accuser would be correct still.<br>  <br>  3. The best choice I think, would be to give your accuser all the chances in the world to try to 'prove' his accusations; even if it means coming between the witness and you.<br>  <br>  My dear, choice number 3 is just what God has chosen to do.  He could have wiped out Satan when he made sin.  But because the other angels in heaven needed to understand God's true character, God is allowing satan all the opportunity in the world (literally) to try to prove that He God is unjust, unloving, unkind and a murderer.<br>  <br>  Therefore, satan uses skepticism, evolution, atheism, drugs, depression, ill-health, mental retardation, demon-possession, murder, suicide, infant death and all works of evil, as a weapon to fight the truth of God's existence.  Then he comes and tempts those who consider themselves to intelligent to believe in an unseen being, telling them that if God exists why does He allow all these things to happen?<br>  <br>  But you bet your life, God exists and one day, THE DAY when He shows Himself, it will be too late for those who have already accepted the devils lies.  The Bible is true my dear, and it alone makes sence of the life, this world and God.
5bMEBX6Vaa	I completely agree with you. Many atheists on Yahoo! Answers need to work on the condescension they routinely express online. They fail to communicate their beliefs with respect and compassion. Yet they claim that they are being oppressed by intolerant and judgmental Christians and take on a righteous posture of rights withheld. <br>  <br>  This is not to say that there are few theists on Yahoo! Answers who are judgmental and intolerant, and bash those who differ with them. However, there are by far more atheists on Yahoo! Answers who engage in these kinds of behaviors.|`|6w1e6zUVaa	I'm a very a christian but I am a very spiritual person but I will say this in defense of ALL atheists.

Matthew 5:11-12 (KJV)<br>  <br>  They cannot possibly understand anything we say because they are LOST!  All we can do is continue to speak the "Word" in love and in truth to them to plant seeds.  They are here because their lives ARE empty or else they wouldn't be here so regularly clawing desperately for answers the way they do.  They can give all the excuses they want to give why they come here, and they will.  But remember,  we used to be them at one time. We too, were once lost and know what it is like to be without God. Life without God is a cold, miserable, empty stinking dung heap with no purpose.  It is hard a lot of the time to read comments that regularly blaspheme the Lord God because if you are truly a born again Christian, anything that offends God will most certainly offend you.  I commend you for taking a stand for all of us. I personally appreciate it.  Maybe tonight it would be good to just sit down, take a deep breath and talk to the Lord about these things.

qktzCVvMaa	I have a story similar to yours. My parents are Catholic; I used to go to Sunday school until I was ten or eleven; I had my "first communion" around that age. My parents have never really attended regular mass, but they continue to believe in God. <br>  <br>  I professed my atheism to myself when I was about sixteen. For years before that I had a vague belief in God, but since it wasn't forced on me I never thought about it very much. I prayed sometimes when I was scared. Once I began to really think about it last year, my junior year of high school, the answer was clear.<br>  <br>  It was actually only this year that I told anyone else about my non-belief. It happened mostly because I met a classmate who is an atheist too, and very open about it. After that I was able to tell other friends when the subject came up.<br>  <br>  I still haven't told my parents. They're going to play the morals card despite how well they know me.|`|8jhACvtlaa	Initially yes.  I was raised LDS.<br>  <br>  I don't live with my parents anymore, it's been a while, and I still consider myself LDS, and not simply because of the habit of going to church on Sunday.

The conquistadors would have killed all of the native Americans.  Religion is like the mucus that binds us.

My family knew the entire time that I did not believe yet tried endlessly to change that, but until 7th grade nobody in my church knew; they thought I was Methodist, and then one day I just flipped out on the pastors when they were poking fun at non-believers.

Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow.

Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.<br>   <br>  16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.<br>   <br>  17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.<br>   <br>  18. Gain control of all student newspapers.<br>   <br>  19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.<br>   <br>  20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.<br>   <br>  21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.<br>   <br>  22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to "eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms."<br>   <br>  23.

Pro-Life means all people are valuable, from conception to natural death. I'm sure that if someone saw their neighbor beating their child, they wouldn't say "Well, I'm against that, but I can't tell them not to do it." <br>  <br>  Of course, the difference is that they see this whereas abortion takes place behind closed doors where they don't have to. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but you can't be Pro-Choice and not Pro-Abortion.

It is an applied religious philosophy. By “applied” is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.<br>  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.<br>  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .<br>  The dictionary definition that applies:<br>  <br>  Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.<br>  <br>  The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.<br>  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless “made” good.<br>  <br>  The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individual’s understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.<br>  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .<br>  <br>  How this result is achieved is the “technology” of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.<br>  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .<br>  Scientology’s closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.<br>  <br>  L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this. <br>  He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientology’s Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.<br>  <br>  The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.<br>  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:<br>  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.<br>  2. People find it interesting.<br>  3. People find it works.<br>  4. People pass it along to others.<br>  5. It grows.<br>  <br>  This is just an overview.<br>  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures. So it’s not possible to fully answer your question on this forum, but I hope  this helps.|`|LHcdLTOxaa	as a Scientologist, we are misunderstood.

Ron Hubbard. Hubbard's theories, assumptions, and techniques for practical applications that make up the rituals of Scientology, are sometimes called the "Spiritual Technology," or simply "the Tech." <br>  <br>  Hubbard claimed to have discovered certain "natural laws" of the spiritual universe, which he claimed can be used to predict and control behavior and phenomena in a manner similar to the way in which the natural laws codified in the physical sciences can be used to predict and control phenomena in the physical world. <br>  <br>  Scientology assumes that spirituality and thought (called "theta") is an energy existing in its own universe, separate and distinct from the physical universe of Matter, Energy, Space and Time (MEST), and that spirit (theta) is senior to, and indeed created, the physical universe (MEST). <br>  <br>  Each individual person (called a "thetan") is considered to be a "thought unit" of the spiritual universe which interacts with the physical universe (MEST), usually by inhabiting a human body. The Scientology term "thetan" is what has commonly been known as the "spirit" and it is defined in Scientology as the source of life; in the individual, it is recognized as the core of personality or essence of oneself, quite distinct and separate from the physical body or the brain. <br>  <br>  Scientology proposes that in its "native state" the spirit/thetan is immortal and god-like and possesses the potentiality of knowing everything, but that in present time its true capabilities have been lost and forgotten. As an immortal entity, the spirit/thetan lives on after body death and is born into a new physical body, again and again, lifetime after lifetime, in an endless cycle of birth and death. As a result of traumatic incidents extending back from the present life through a long series of "past lifetimes" hidden from conscious memory, the spirit/thetan has become trapped in the physical body and the physical/MEST universe. <br>  <br>  Content of these traumatic incidents may influence a person's current life, causing physical and mental illnesses, irrational thoughts and acting-out behavior, and limiting one's creativity and other abilities. Scientology claims that these traumatic incidents, along with each spirit/thetan's personal history, are recorded in complete detail on the "time track," sometimes called the "whole track," which for each person is many trillions of years in length. Scientology proposes that through a process called "auditing" that uses techniques developed by Hubbard (often assisted by a device called the E-Meter), an individual can be guided to find and "discharge" these hidden traumas, thus escaping the suffering and limitations imposed by the past. <br>  <br>  Further, as one progresses through a series of auditing "levels," one can eventually be restored to native state and can attain the status of  "operating thetan," wherein one is free of attachments to the body and, even while "exterior" to (outside) the body, one can consciously control matter, energy, space, time, thought, and life. Hubbard's writings and lectures include many tantalizing details of the god-like abilities that may be gained through auditing.<br>  <br>  For most individual Scientologists, recovering these god-like abilities (and encouraging and assisting others to do so as well) is the primary goal of participation in Scientology. The "levels" through which a participant progresses make up what is called "The Bridge to Total Freedom." Progress through all the levels of the "Bridge" often takes many years of dedicated study and practice, and the cost in fees for services for the Bridge is currently estimated at approximately $300,000 - $500,000 in US dollars. <br>  <br>   According to examples given in Scientology, the content of "whole track" incidents can include (but is not limited to) attempted abortions and other fetal traumas, acts of torture and violence experienced both as victim and as perpetrator, encounters with the Marcab Confederacy and various Invader Forces from spacefaring Galactic civilizations, life on earth as a clam, "implants" of ideas and artificial purposes sometimes administered with a pain-drug-hypnosis combination, and other experiences that almost always include pain and/or confusion and/or unconsciousness. <br>  <br>  While many of the traumatic incidents addressed in auditing are unique to the individual, some key incidents are thought to be common to all humans on planet earth. One very important such incident supposedly occurred some 75 million years ago. Scientology warns that until one has completed a series of preparatory steps, exposure to the details of this particular incident can cause severe illness or even death.* Thus, these details are carefully guarded and kept secret until, at the level called "Operating Thetan III" the member is deemed properly prepared and is granted permission to view and "audit" this information.<br>  <br>  Complete load of excreta from a male bovine|`|fjidmhxsaa	No one knows|`|x8iAd7Znaa	iT mAKES fOR gOOD cOMEDIC sPORT iF nOTHING eLSE!!!!!|`|sEPjAHX4aa	i feel so sorry for them...crazy people...

If they have, in fact, actually read the Bible, it says not only to love everyone, but to respect the fact that God gave everyone the right to choose to do or believe anything they want to! I believe in being respectful, open, and understanding of other's beliefs. <br>  <br>  As a devoted Christian, myself, I actually love hearing about other people's beliefs. The poor soul who shuts others out for having different views is very ignorant.|`|05edb8ca6ffb65b2efb7bc7d5314a0eaaa	Because that is their culture.<br>  <br>  They feel their god has given them a higher purpose.

46fouwFfaa	Yeah, I  understand how annoying those kind of people can be. They're usually influenced by society's idea of what a female should look like and the general belief is that black females cannot fit that description unless they are mixed. I've had a lot of people, white or black ask about my ethnicity and whether my hair is real or not. In elementary school little girls would constantly touch it and try to see if I had tracks and believe it or not, black people would give me the most grief over it. <br>  <br>  Black women can have beautiful natural hair, whatever their texture is, as long as they know how to take care of it. You don't have to be mixed to have long or wavy hair. If some people believe it, then that's their problem.|`|92iuiuZKaa	I run into the same thing you jus mentioned. about people asking me what am I mixed with since my hair is a certain kind of way. It is a little irritating because I hear it all the time, but it doesn't bother me much because people are curious. But I think it ignorant for a person to think a black person has to be mixed with somethin if they have hair that looks nice|`|DfDss68haa	Becuase some are still colorstruck or believe that being black is ugly. Simple. Yeah he was messed up and has bought into the idea that straight hair is prettier and nappy.kinky.coily.curly hair is ugly. it's really quite sad becuase I bet his own hair wasn't exactly that "good hurr" was it? <br>  <br>  Sadly he was just saying what many black people think:<br>  <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2008/12/18/nappily-ever-after-not-quite/" rel="nofollow">http://www.racialicious.com/2008/12/18/n...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part2/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/ne...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fZaDf15O-8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fZaDf15O...</a><br>  He is the type of guy that usually walks up to me and asks me when I am going to get a perm or that guy that is about to hit on a girl but sees some "beadie beads" on her neck and was so disgusted he walked away. We have truly been indoctrinated into self hating. He is also that guy that won't let his girlfriend go natural or would dump her if she did. And he is by no means alone. So much in his statement shows an attitude that much of the black community has. That we "need" relaxers. That relaxed hair is prettier. Or better yet naturally silky loose curls and waves are prettier than tight curls. That wearing your natural texture shows that you don't care about your hair or appearance. And then finally, that you have to mixed in order to have skin lighter than ebony  and hair looser than kinks which isn't true. Full blooded Africans have many diverse features and come with many hair textures and skin colors and facial features.<br>  <br>  He was trying to hit on you but was saying all the wrong things. Becuase of all the above long hair is highly valued becuase we have for so long not known how to take care of our hair (using petroleum products, burning it, pouring chemicals on it) so that it's always a shock when a black woman has long hair. I recently chopped off my relaxed ends and I have never felt freer. It was like I was bowing out of the unspoken race for who can have the longest hair that all black woman play. <br>  <br>  But not all black men think like the guy above. I have gotten hit on less with my short napptural hair but when I do get hit on it is a much better quality of guy, you know what I am saying? Less of those little gangster wanna bes who think black women should have blond weave down to her butt and more men who have their act together and can apppreciate natural beauty. Like this guy:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no40m98DLpI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no40m98DL...</a><br>  <br>  If you are interested more in the Why behind why there is a "good hair, bad hair" mentality check out the documentaries "My Nappy Roots" and "Good Hair" (which was made by Chris Rock so it should be funny as well as deep). It's coming out on HBO soon.|`|2cf99691bb36e8205d594c179df58bdeaa	I get comments like that too<br>  a bunch of bull in my ears<br>  <br>  <br>  some people are soo stupid<br>  what's this 'good hair' crap about|`|a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	Just cut to the chase and ask him out.|`|sIqXCXoVaa	Maybe he just prefers straight hair to afros? I'm black and I find straight hair looks better but I'm not racist|`|tusCN8zpaa	Yeah it is so ignorant hearing them do that. Its like if you have long hair they assume your mixed or the person claims their mixed side. I am multiracial but stuff like this makes me want to just say I'm 100% black and have long hair, black girls can have long hair without being mixed. That boy has some major issues, he should really get help and I find him a little gay to trip over hair like that.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	this all sounds so juvenile. you guys really need to grow up. dude will probably end up with some ugly heffer anywayz.|`|30b80549ef581ba10302258d8ca2bfbaaa	hold on let me read it first...lol<br>  <br>  okay. i think hes pretty much got that messed mentality of european straight hair is better or less african is better. its sad but thats why i cut and stopped straightening my hair. well i cut it because my hair got weird after years of relaxing. anyway thats common throughuout our community. sad but true. they associate "good hair" (which doesnt exist) with "non-african roots". some people in africa have straighter hair as well but we arent taught the diversity because society pretty much associates anything deemed inferior or ugly with black. <br>  <br>  i get your frustration. i have had similar experiences but usually with white people which is a whole different kind of annoying lol but just try to explain how you feel to him. maybe it will expand his mind and maybe hell start second guessing the way he thinks and that kind of mentality. <br>  <br>  or he wont. then **** him. who cares : ]|`|5KQoRc02aa	I really understand how you feel. It sucks that some people; especially amongst us African Americans, can think that all of us have to look, walk, and talk the same just because we're black.<br>  But I think his problem is that he is not used to seeing black women like so.  I live in NY, which is a VERY cultural diffused place, you wouldn't be able to tell who is mixed with what, or who is just ONE ethnicity. Us black women, come from ALL different places. Africa, The Caribbean, Central America South America, and MUCH more. Just be happy that he is able to see that black women come in all different "hair lengths" (lol), and his ignorance/generalizations can subside.<br>  <br>  :]|`|DhgU7x0Daa	If an African person has silky/straight/wavy hair, it most likely IS genes from some ancestor of another race somewhere in the gene pool. Sometimes a gene can pop up from several generations back. A pure African with hair like this is very rare, which is why it gets the reaction it does. I'm not saying it CAN'T happen, just that the case usually is another race's genetic influence. Ethiopians are a people considered "black" and most have silky or loosely curled hair and thin features. But, their history shows they were integrated with many non-African invaders centuries ago. And northern Africans were integrated with Arab blood. Having black/kinky hair is nothing to be ashamed of. It's an African genetic trait that makes African people unique from the rest of the world. And unique is beautiful.<br>  <br>  Further proof black and biracial people are not the same! :) Your hair is part of what makes biracial people unique. Embrace it, don't miscredit it  (like everything else achieved by and unique to biracial people) to blacks. :)|`|h1Pxqz5vaa	Yeah that pisses me off too. I think its worse for me though because I am a Darker complexioned black girl that has long,wavy hair. I am always asked "Is that weave?" or "Is that your natural hair?" .  I get really ticked off especialy at our Black men when they make ignorant comments like that. I can't beleive some people don't thing that Black people can have pretty hair too.|`|hAKy6FMpaa	its all about the "european standard" of beauty. everyone is brain washed to think that light skin, long hair, etc are the way and if you are anything but white then you must be mixed if you have long hair or anything that looks relativly european.<br>  i also get this all the time. eveyrone always asks me "are you mixed?"<br>  "are you part asain?" "are you part white?" <br>  my dad is half indian but i still say im all black because i dont consider myself "mixed" even though i guess i am technically haha|`|hqvPk8WIaa	Black guys who say those types of things are so annoying. I've had some black guys even rub my hair without asking. All hair textures are beautiful in their own way, and some women look better with shorter hairstyles because they have strong cheekbones or doe eyes so the short hair brings out their features. Some black people have been thoroughly brainwashed by generations of propaganda that ridiculed people with tightly coiled hair.
c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	I don't know, I think I disagree. They are different translations, based on the same greek and hebrew manuscripts (and there are more then one) The way the words are changed, and how they are changed really changes some of the reading of the bible, and makes then different versions. There are also different versions based on the religion using the bible. <br>  <br>  For example: The Catholic bible has a totally different canonization and  books in the middle that the Christian bible doesn't have. It's also been translated differently. <br>  The Mormon bible although they have the same books as the Christian bible also have added books. <br>  <br>  Even within the Christian bible there are some very large differences. For example the message bible is the bible paraphrased. It's still based on the greek, but very loosely, and loses a lot of meaning. <br>  The new international bible is the same, very different then say the new american standard bible. <br>  <br>  And to make things even more troublesome to your mind, there are also different types of bibles in how they are made up, regular bibles, study bibles, in depth study bibles, devotional bibles. A lot of bibles today have other peoples ideas in them as well to help "illuminate" the text. <br>  <br>  See how they are more versions then translations. There is a ton more that goes into a bible then just a bible these days...It's a real shame.|`|NlnM6diMaa	Maybe because there are different versions of the bible. The Ethiopian bible include several texts not accepted by the KJV of the bible and the Catholic bible also has several books in it that protestants don't acknowledge . Its because "there are different versions of the bible" that people say there are different versions of the bible.|`|crfWDksCaa	You can't translate literally from one language to another. Some languages have many words for the same or similar thing and different from language to language.<br>  <br>  You are right that whatever version you read of the Bible in English is a translation.<br>  The original Bible was written in Hebrew. In Hebrew there is only one version, but any translation will be different, as explained above|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	So, do you think the bible was written all at once in one language in one dialect?|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	No; all the versions that came out after 1900 are corrupt versions. There have been some very serious changes made in these versions - hundreds of verses have been changed or removed completely. Some of the versions completely eliminate ALL scriptural references to Jesus Christ being the Son of God, and some actually equate Him with Satan in some verses. <br>  There are 3 families of manuscripts from which all Bible versions come from, but only one of them is uncorrupted - the Traditional stream, from which the King James Version comes. There are two other families - the Alexandrian stream, and the Western family:<br>  <br>  Alexandrian stream (corrupt)--------> Papyrus 75, Papyrus 66, Codex B, Codex Aleph, Revised version of 1881---------> RSV, New English Bible, American Standard<br>  <br>  Traditional stream (not corrupt)---------> Gothic, Peshitta Syriac, Codex W, Codex A, the vast majority of extant NT manuscripts, KJV<br>  <br>  Western stream (corrupt) ---------> Old Latin, Latin Vulgate, Codex D, Codex D2, Codex E3, Douay version<br>  <br>  The Alexandrian manuscripts are the oldest, but not the best. They contained errors and had been rubbed out and re-written up to 70 times. Both the Jesuit (Western) and Alexandrian streams are missing verses that are not missing in the Traditional stream. The most accurate streams came from Pella and Antioch, not Rome. Also from Gallic and Celtic, Pre-Waldensian and Waldensian churches of the Reformation. <br>  Eusebius ws commissioned by Constantine to write an "ecumenical Bible" that would be acceptable to both Christians and Pagans. The Christians said, "These are not from God", and rejected them. So they ended up in ancient libraries where they were later discovered as "ancient manuscripts". These contained the Aryan heresy that "Jesus was not God". In 1881, Westcott & Hort introduced a Greek text from these manuscripts, which followed the Vatican and Sinaitic corruptions. The Jehovah's Witness Bible was translated from this text (New World Translation). <br>  Any Bible in any language that existed prior to the 1900's is from the Received Text (Traditional stream). No matter what language they were translated to, they all agreed with each other. <br>  The real argument in the "Battle of the Bibles" is "Received Text" vs. other manuscripts. The Jesuits said "We must undermine the Bible of the Protestants and destroy their teachings."|`|AA11521494	Different versions are different translations.  Except for the fact that the catholic bible is bigger than the protestant version in that it includes a few books that were in the Greek version of the old testament that aren't in the Hebrew version.

Once you love yourself, the whole issue of needing to hear 'I love you' will take care of it's self.<br>  <br>  Years ago I read the book 'You can heal your life' by Louise L. Hay.  It is all about positive thinking.  I did not realize I was dealing with some mild form of depression.

I highly suggest reading something in the 'self help' section, that is to your liking or style.<br>  <br>  When you do love someone, I do not think you can tell them, you love them enough.  Besides we can say it in different ways, like by saying 'Fasten your seat-belt' or 'Drive carefully...'.

AA11521494	Queen Kira has provided all of them except 1 Tim 1:9-10 - "... that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of father and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, immoral persons, sodomites, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine..."<br>  <br>  As you can see there are only five references in the whole bible.  And the new testament ones are much disputed  - certainly the word used in the original Greek of the 1 Cor. reference is "arsenokoitai" which is used in so few other places in ancient literature that nobody is totally sure what it means.  So why Christians seem to have a huge hang-up about it and ask about it all the time here is a mystery to me.<br>  <br>  The bible aside, another question nobody seems to be able to answer is why is a small percentage of people homosexual?  Why did god create anyone that way if he is perfect?  I know Christians who get upset by it say that homosexuality is a choice - but take it from this homosexual man, it isn't.

But i suppose you either read and it and claim to understand it fully or you don't want to read it because you are a know it all, i highly doubt either one. so what are you so pissed off at God about. what did he do or not do for you? stop your whining against God|`|LCAXc8S5aa	Know Christian would claim to know all the will of God; but we can certainly understand the general principles of God; what He hates, what He loves, how He thinks towards many things because He has left us a written record of His dealings with mankind in the Bible, which I believe with all my heart to be the Word of God.<br>  <br>  But beyond this, God has communicated His very Self to me through the Holy Spirit of God, which, as Peter puts it "God gives to those who obey Him."<br>  <br>  This is your problem - you know nothing of God, because you refuse to believe and obey the Gospel.|`|118h96Q8aa	GrateFul--LOL hilarious! XD<br>  <br>  Upfront, I want to say that I am Christian. I don't know what God thinks. I don't claim to know what God thinks. I do base my behaviorism's off of the Bible, though. It instructs to do only kind things: love one another, don't lie, don't judge. I don't presume to know what God thinks about my behavior or others for that matter. For all I know, he may see us as a lost cause. But, that won't stop me from believing and loving Him, anyway.|`|9e177d99b8bc114ce1968f205434bb1aaa	They think they know everything.....|`|uCmFLmSkaa	They can't the christians use the book of lies to explain their fairy tale god.|`|QX0PfX4Daa	I know!!|`|NCPmNw4Eaa	Not all of them are!|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	They do know.

X4UAMHhRaa	You dont really have to flush it unless it hasnt been flushed by the previous person and unless you wanna waste some precious H2O. It's not gonna make a difference because you're not going to get in contact with the toilet water right? The most you have to worry about is the toilet seat.    Honestly, your hands are probably dirtier than the toilet seat (as long as its being cleaned out regularly). Trust me, we swabbed hands, toilet seat and a dish sponge in microbiology class and the toilet had the least to no bacterial growth.|`|zvTbYGZfaa	If there is something floating in it as the last guest left me a surprise, and I have to sit down and go, I just sit down.

baW9sSsLaa	I have been clinically dead three times.    Twice, I was frightened until my heart actually stopped (the other time, it was too sudden for me to realize what was happening.)  But every time, once I was actually dead, I was calm.  I was aware that there was a choice, that I could move on (to where, I didn't know and didn't care) or go back.  I chose to go back, because I still had too many things left to do.    I know that one day, I will die and I won't have that choice, and I just hope I won't have left anything undone.  That's why I try not to put off the important things, things that I might regret leaving unfinished.

Stop being racist and get some education (it is blond not blonde).|`|tYBM5suSaa	As usual, this is another question that has multiple factors to consider. I am of Afrikan descent so I can only speak from that perspective.    "Non white" men that go towards white women are a product of the brainwashing propaganda set up in this country via various methods, especially the media. Take Afrikans for example, we were stolen, beat, and abused in every unimaginable way. Taught we were ugly and that our hair was "bad" for generations, continuing until today. It was ingrained that the thing to seek was "whiteness" and that it was the epitomy of beauty. Beig taught that black = bad and white = good caused massive damage of how we perceived ourselves  and whites.To obtan a white mte in many eyes is a sign of success, a trophy so to speak.     Blacks that usually give in to that propaganda are simply a product of the society hat created them, and they have done exactly what society wanted when they instilled such self hate. It takes a look of retraining to understand and apply knowledge of self and to know that beauty must first represent oneself.     It is shameful that a people do not chose to pick mates that reflect themselves and have children that reflect themselves and build a nation. To continue on such paths could potentially wipe out in their entirety the entire nation.      I have heard that love as no boundaries but that is another saying full of flaw. Everything has boundaries, including love. Love is a choice, and who we chose to attach ourselves to says a lot about a person.|`|VEoURHoCaa	welli cant speck for all of them but as for my bothers they all say they like Asians(the most) Latinos and blacks uhh yea nothing about whites girls..|`|AA11035525	because we dont see them everyday .. tell me what ethnic is the most populated in the world? get wat i mean|`|tesf7qC0aa	I don't!

1CS2KR7Taa	Well I do not want to put things in your head that you might not have yet, and it is possible that you are just worried about your "big year" and all the responsibilities coming with it.<br>  But the desires in us are evolving, and while for a while we are satisfied with the usual basic human desires of food, sex, family, home, and the social desires of money, power, honor and knowledge, after a while we start to feel that those are not enough and we start to search for something beyond.<br>  You mentioned you started to believe in God, that is why I mention this.<br>  So maybe something has woken up inside you, which pulls you beyond our materialistic life?<br>  Maybe you would like to know about our purpose in this life?<br>  These questions do not necessarily have to pull you to a certain religion, or higher being.<br>  We can find and attain our purpose within the frame of our lives, provided we find the appropriate environment, and tools. At the end of the road you will find the answer to the question you asked.<br>  But at the end of the day the search and the decision is yours, you have to find your path.<br>  Below I give you links to the method, that helped me in my similar search, providing me with a helping environment, and with the tools to develop further, while still fulfilling the normal day to day obligations of work and family.<br>  All the best for your "big year".|`|RfOLqUKlaa	If God wanted you to do something he'd write it across the sky in mile-high letters of flame.

You don't have to make all your decisions at once. A lot of ppl have changed their majors, or have changed carreers at age 30 or 40. Nothing is set in stone. If you screw up, just start again. As long as there's life ,there's a chance to change. Follow your own heart and if your dream should change, go with it . A lot of what you learn,academically, or otherwise can translate to new situation. Don't feel pressured. See your school counselor if you think you should.

9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	I think that the semantics of this verse are important to our understanding of it. If the words "the third day" were in parenthesis, then the rest would be unchallengeable. I agree that the Old Testament contains no propecy of resurrection on the third day, but the Lord Himself said that no sign would be given to this wicked and adulterous generation other than that of the prophet Jonah. http://bible.cc/matthew/12-39.htm  http://www.biblehelpsonline.com/propheci...|`|81FuUf9Saa	Though you may not find the words 'raised the third day' in the Old Testament, there are prophecies that point to His resurrection, e.g. Psalm 16:10: "For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."    and Isaiah 53:  And as for His generation, who considered that He was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of My people for whom the stroke was due? His grave was assigned with wicked men, yet He was with a rich man IN HIS [own] DEATH, because He had done no violence, neither was there ever any deceit in His mouth.   "But the LORD was pleased to crush Him, putting Him to grief; if He would render Himself as a guilt offering, He will SEE HIS OFFSPRING, He will PROLONG HIS DAYS, and the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand.  As a result of the anguish of His Soul, He will see it and be satisfied; by His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, as He will bear their iniquities.   Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, and He will divide the booty with the strong; because He poured Himself out TO DEATH, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet He Himself bore the sin of many, and interceded for the transgressors. (Is. 53:8b - 12). (There are other prophecies relating to this, but these are the clearest I can find at short notice).   Therefore, what Paul wrote can be paraphrased thus: " ... and that, in fulfilment of the prophecies in the Scriptures that He would rise from the dead, He did so the third day."    Hopefully, you see here that, as He died, yet His life is prolonged to see His (spiritual) offspring, and that this 'Holy One would not see corruption', He must therfore have been resurrected, and that shortly after His death.    Hope this answers you query. May God bless all those who sincerely seek the truth about Him.|`|vQ75GgNnaa	Very interesting question. Which part of it is a prophecy of the old testament and what is Jesus own prediction of His Passion?  If you need any references from the O/T about the coming of Christ please read these: Isaiah 42, Isaiah 53, Zechariah 9.9,10.  The prophecy about the third day is one that Jesus himself said before the Calvary read Matthew 20. 17,19.  If this is not enough for you then you could start a search in the Torah and find there a prophecy about the coming and suffering of Christ but be careful because the Jews still believe that the Messiah has not come yet.|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	I think it is referring to Jonah being in the belly of the whale for 3 days. There were many prophecies in the Old Testament that Jesus believed referred to him. Some are not extremely clearly prophecies, and some are.    Jonah is punished for disobedience. Jesus was punished for our disobedience.  Jonah was in the belly of the whale for 3 days. Jesus was in the grave for 3 days.  Jonah then preached the message of God to the gentiles. The salvation message of Jesus went to the gentiles primarily.    Here's the same symbolic type of prophecy in another place -  The replacement of Isaac, with a goat caught in a tree as sacrifice of Abraham. That sacrifice took place on Mount Moria which Jews have traditionally identified as Mount Zion (ie temple area in Jerusalem). The goat was taken from the side of the mountain. Jesus was sacrificed on a "tree" outside the city gates.|`|q6H2ru3waa	some things in the OldTestament explains things as a prophesy not yet fulfilled.

So I made the effort to accept it even more so. But the doubts came again, and I wondered what would happen if we took faith out of the equation; the world and nature still made sense, so I saw no reason to get back into it. At the time this was difficult intellectually and emotionally (I was a teenager, after all).<br>  <br>  That was getting on for 40 years ago, and my escape from faith has freed me to embrace what science has to offer, which I consider far more plausible than belief in the supernatural, and is the nearest we can get to the truth about how nature and the universe work. I've felt a sense of freedom ever since.<br>  <br>  I still have an interest in religions, mythology and related matters, and am fascinated that people still believe in things that to me are just not true.|`|MKWkPH2vaa	Wow there were some really good answers to this question so I just thought I would chime in. I too consider myself and atheist, that is, I don't REALLY think I'm an atheist, but its the closest category to what I truly believe so I go with that one. Its a lot easier just to tell people that I'm an atheist than to go into details and most of the time people really don't care anyway. Everyone should have different thoughts and views about life and the world and everything that has happened and will happen in the future because we are all different people and have had different lives and see the world through different eyes. Don't feel pressured to belong to a label or a group. Just because you say, I'm an atheist, that doesn't mean that the atheist next to you will agree with everything you say word for word. You know why? Its because we don't try to brainwash each other into parroting certain key phrases and killing what little humanity we have left. And they would call us the barbaric ones.|`|b0c58cc0b655a543b52a5ab7c8f62835aa	From what you said you are a agnostic-atheist although for me who is atheist God, all religions are not something that actually in my mind at all until I have a conversation or hear something about a religion. Me I don't believe in God or any higher being at all so I'm just a atheist.|`|3e9cd86e32403818853bca17334a00abaa	No one can be 100% sure of that. That would require all the knowledge of the universe and in that, they would become a God themselves. I am 99.9% sure there isn't a God and I reserve the .01% for the unknown because we can't know everything.|`|uxfacsgmaa	I consider myself an atheist in that I don't believe there are any gods out there, but I also think it is sort of unrealistic to say that "I am absolutely 100% positive there is no god". We simply do not know. We can look at the distinct lack of evidence and make assumptions, but you can still be open to the possibility that you might be wrong. <br>  <br>  That's my take on it, anyway. Show me proof, and I'll change my mind - until then, I'm not holding my breath :).

Trust me, I've tried to get turned on by women in the past.<br>  Of course, not all men turn me on either. But a dark, muscular, ripped man almost always does it for me.<br>  Of course, everybody is different, and I certainly can't speak for all gay men, and those closer to the hetero side of the Kinsey scale may well get turn on by a woman as well, hence bisexual men.|`|fmr98EBtaa	Well, someone who is bi might feel attracted to her as much as he is attracted to guys. Or more... or less? I'm not exactly sure how that would work, it probably varies from person to person.<br>  <br>  As for me, I find pictures of naked women (unless they are meant to be artistic) to be a bit gross. No offense to any women, but I would say it's a turn off. I would be able to tell you if she is attractive, but I couldn't really compare her to other women very well or give you a specific reason. I mean, breast size leaves me completely clueless. Big? Small? What do you prefer? I really don't know. x.x|`|e0lfV7skaa	Nope, hence the term gay.  <br>  <br>  I can look at a picture of a beautiful woman naked and appreciate the beauty.

Nice name. <br>  <br>  Im gay... and when I see a hot naked girl Im just like "oh wow. Shes pretty... I bet a guy would really like that" .... and then nothing happens down stairs. I think boobs are fun to look at and I actually check out girls boobs all the time. Probably not the same way you do... more like checking out their size and upkeep haha! But if I see a vagina I actually get grossed out. I kinda try to forget that vaginas exist. <br>  <br>  For naked men... yes. I get turned on instantly. And I check out every guy I see... but I do it discretely. And you would never know that I was gay if you met me. <br>  <br>  Its funny you ask cus I wonder this all the time. I think being gay is really weird. Im always wondering why I am gay. Like why would I be attracted to what I already have? But then I look at a vagina and am like 'woooah... I do not want to be near that." haha|`|9ee8dcc2934057939567eae607a331c6aa	Joe, your a PUTZ !!!<br>  <br>  First, to ask such a question is only seeking attention for the benefit of what ?  your friends ?  your gay boyfriend (you closet case)<br>  <br>  My first suspicion is - who really announces they are straight in a gay forum - That would be like saying 'It's not me - but I have a friend .... <br>  <br>  My second suspicion is 'you cannot see how you could be attracted to me' ... look in your pants dude .. then see if you can't be attracted to men .. do YOU throw up at the site of your pecker?

AA11620807	As far as bein bisexual..... You CAN'T know for sure till you've tried it and found yer personal sexual boundaries.  Bi-curious is literally a curiousity about it. That may stem from yer own attraction to men and what it means or possibly just what people get out of it.  <br>  <br>     About the other parts to your question.... There's different forms of bisexuality. Some are more attracted to one or the other (the most coomon) and others are attracted equally to both sexes. .LoL Who says ya cant feel normal BECAUSE yer bi?  Preference is only part of what makes us who we are.<br>  <br>      My advice would be to explore when and where you're ready to experiment.  Confusion ends when one figures out what they like, but can't become comfortable with it. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>     If it makes ya feel any better, you sound a lot like I did. I prefer women, and dont find guys sexually attractive. I like sex with men because I find it incredibly erotic to be used purely as a source of sexual gratification.  lol it may seem odd, but taking a man orally or anally gets me hot, but KISSING another guy is a major turn off to me. I dunno if that qualifies as strictly bi-sexual or not., but I'm comfortable with myself so don't mind being openly bi. It's simpler that tryin to define myself with labels that aren't totally accurate.|`|a87202188ac306b67714d9e45d2bc435aa	yes it can be confusing, I myself am  Bi and felt the same way you did at first but over time I realized that there was nothing wrong with this and embraced liking men and women.  My best advice to you is trust in yourself, and it does get easier in time.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Just knew that liked both.|`|H2IqzG12aa	I suppose the simplest test is, if you have the desire, then you are.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I'm 46 years old, and I have never really had sex with a guy.  However, I see guys I'm attracted to, and I've had crushes before.  I see even more women I'm attracted to, and I've been married to one for 22 years.  However, I know I am bisexual.  Straight guys don't ever feel sexually attracted to other men, but I definitely do, and that's how I know.
KRTPJP2baa	It's not a stupid question. All languages change over time, terms come and go. English, unlike the common European languages such as French, German, Spanish is the only one that does not differentiate between a familiar and polite 'you' in everyday speech and is the only one that uses the 'ing' tense the way it is used. The Spanish future tense endings are also a good example of compound verbs that used to be separate changing over time so that most Spaniards would not now know the derivation of this tense.<br>  Changes like you are suggesting might well come about but it will take a very long time.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Because you can say he "isn't" going to school which means the exact opposit<br>  <br>  -Atheist|`|mUK240ykaa	You can, but it won't be Standard English anymore, but a Pidgin or a Creole, like New Guinea Pidgin or Jamaican Creole.|`|lTPPI73uaa	i dont know.<br>  thats weird too now that i think about it.<br>  i mean do we actually know what the definition of 'is' is?<br>  <br>  ^^^^^haha.|`|4K3TuGPzaa	Hi Ich Liebe..,<br>  <br>  Actually, the answer is very simple (I've studied languages / linguistics all my life), but you won't like it: English has these little extra words because if it didn't, it wouldn't be English. I know, this sounds kinda sassy, but I don't mean it that way, you know :-) - It's a fact - that's what I've learned after all those years of study - that a language develops historically. To tell you all the details would take several hours *lol*. So, when a language develops it adds certain things, others it discards; it's a complex thing, very complex, in fact. <br>  Of course, as you say, it could be that way in English, i.e. that we say, e.g. 'he go school,' but that is not the way it has developed. Someone in our past - linguistically speaking - must have added 'goes,' or 'to,' or it was adapted from Middle English, which, in turn, adapted the different ways of saying it from Old English. So, some of it is adaptation, some of it happens when people say something in everyday life and it is, not adapted, but adopted into the language. <br>  Language is - as some have said - like a living organism. A living organism has maybe a leg less or some scars or so. So, what can we ask here? Why do you limp on just three legs? Or, why is that part of your skin without feeling (numb, scarred)? Couldn't you be different? - Yes, the organism (the animal) could be, but isn't, because that's how things went for him/it. -<br>  Similar it is with a language. English is what it is because of many, many factors, it's all developed over many, many years, and it's a very interesting subject (linguistics) pursued by some to find out how and why. <br>  If you want a good read on this, try: Our Language, by Simeon Potter.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  whizip
87e7b956696278de07838481b900732caa	Summarized:    As some point in time, every man learns that he must forge his own life, independently of how other people are doing with their own. That the only fulfillment he will obtain will be through his own work and efforts; that he must trust himself and accept that divine providence has placed him where he is supposed to be. This is what great men have always done; trusting in themselves, following their heart, working hard and thus standing out.
bda465ikaa	The prime minister is the "head of government", while The Queen is the "head of state". In America these roles are both held by the same person. <br>  - The queen has very little "political" signifigance. She technically has powers, but she doesn't defy parliament. Her responsibility is to represent the country at home and abroad, to honor the outstanding citizens of the country, to support the charities, and to be the "personal embodiment" of a nation.<br>  - There are still many monarchies left in Europe. Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Spain are all constitutional monarchs. In Luxembourg and Monaco the monarch has a lot of political power, not just ceremonial power. In tiny Liechtenstein the monarch still owns most of the country, so it is more like the old time monarchies. Every country in Europe with a monarchy has a vocal group that wants the country to become a republic. However, none of them are close to abolishing their monarchy. There are still some people that want to restore monarchies that were abolished in the last 100 years.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	The Queen forms the government,signs laws into action,opens and dissolves Parliament,appoints the Prime Minister.The monarch is the stable force of government: <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/</a> puts it this way."The Queen also has an essential role in providing a sense of stability and continuity in times of political and social change. The system of constitutional monarchy bridges the discontinuity of party politics. <br>  <br>  While political parties change constantly, the Sovereign continues as Head of State, providing a stable framework within which a government can introduce wide-ranging reforms. <br>  <br>  With more than five decades of reading State papers, meeting Heads of State and ambassadors and holding a weekly audience with the Prime Minister, The Queen has an unequalled store of experience upon which successive Prime Ministers have been able to draw.

Basically, the whole 2012 thing is bogus. People are out to make money on it.    The following is part (toward the bottom) of the wikipedia article on the Mayan Calendar: "The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar forms the basis for a New Age belief, first forecast by Jos Argelles, that a cataclysm will take place on or about December 21, 2012, a forecast that mainstream Mayanist scholars consider a misinterpretation, yet is commonly referenced in pop-culture media as the 2012 problem.    "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," says Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. in Crystal River, Florida. To render December 21, 2012, as a doomsday or moment of cosmic shifting, she says, is "a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in."

When properly understood, evolution refutes racism. Before Darwin, people used typological thinking for living things, considering different plants and animals to be their distinct "kinds." This gave rise to a misleading conception of human races, in which different races are thought of as separate and distinct. Darwinism helps eliminate typological thinking and with it the basis for racism.<br>  <br>     2. Genetic studies show that humans are remarkably homogeneous genetically, so all humans are only one biological race. Evolution does not teach racism; it teaches the very opposite.<br>  <br>     3. Racism is thousands of years older than the theory of evolution, and its prevalence has probably decreased since Darwin's day; certainly slavery is much less now. That is the opposite of what we would expect if evolution promotes racism.<br>  <br>     4. Darwin himself was far less racist than most of his contemporaries.<br>  <br>     5. Although creationism is not inherently racist, it is based upon and inseparable from religious bigotry, and religious bigotry is no less hateful and harmful than racism.<br>  <br>     6. Racism historically has been closely associated with creationism (Moore 2004), as is evident in the following examples:<br>  <br>            * George McCready Price, who is to young-earth creationism what Darwin is to evolution, was much more racist than Darwin. He wrote,<br>  <br>                  The poor little fellow who went to the south<br>                    Got lost in the forests dank;<br>                  His skin grew black, as the fierce sun beat<br>                  And scorched his hair with its tropic heat,<br>                    And his mind became a blank. <br>  <br>              In The Phantom of Organic Evolution, he referred to Negroes and Mongolians as degenerate humans (Numbers 1992, 85).<br>  <br>            * During much of the long history of apartheid in South Africa, evolution was not allowed to be taught. The Christian National Education system, formalized in 1948 and accepted as national policy from 1967 to 1993, stated, among other things,<br>  <br>                  that white children should 'receive a separate education from black children to prepare them for their respective superior and inferior positions in South African social and economic life, and all education should be based on Christian National principles' (Esterhuysen and Smith 1998). <br>  <br>              The policy excluded the concept of evolution, taught a version of history that negatively characterized non-whites, and made Bible education, including the teaching of creationism, and religious assemblies compulsory (Esterhuysen and Smith 1998).<br>  <br>            * The Bible Belt in the southern United States fought hardest to maintain slavery.<br>  <br>            * Henry Morris, of the Institute for Creation Research, has in the past read racism into his interpretation of the Bible:<br>  <br>                  Sometimes the Hamites, especially the Negroes, have even become actual slaves to the others. Possessed of a genetic character concerned mainly with mundane, practical matters, they have often eventually been displaced by the intellectual and philosophical acumen of the Japhethites and the religious zeal of the Semites (Morris 1976, 241). <br>  <br>     7. None of this matters to the science of evolution.|`|acbqsZZbaa	Perhaps you can point us to some quotes from Darwin that back up your claim?<br>  <br>  The criterion for animals to belong to the same species is the ability to interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Darwin was well aware that black and white people can do this, so why would he believe that black people are some kind of intermediate species?<br>  <br>  From what I understand he believed that there was an evolution of cultures, such that if two cultures came into competition the more advanced one would eliminate the less advanced one. That does not necessarily imply that the less advanced one is inferior. The Plains Indians for instance were perfectly skilled at living on the Great Plains of America as they had for thousands of yeras, but when European settlers arrived with their guns, telegraphs and railways the natives were quickly eliminated.|`|caea98f7ed2871cd6caf9a1f351fc5ddaa	black people are not the missing link ,nothing is we were created by God,its such a simple truth ,but too many people because of its simplicity refuse to believe it ,the bible doesn't tell us how exactly he did it  ,but he did ,ask jws about this the next time they call.genesis ch.1 v1|`|o4UrRbTvaa	Charles Darwin never said that.

BevylvVSaa	a. There are no requirements under the ADA to hire disabled people, deaf or otherwise. What is required is that they are not discriminated against when being hired.<br>  <br>  b.  Many people who have never heard voices and have learned how to talk speak in a fashion that is not ordinary and can be difficult to listen to until you get used to it. <br>  <br>  c. It is not your place to say she is not welcome. That is the easiest way I know of to discover you are not welcome.  She could go to your boss and claim harassment.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would start looking for a new job - or transfer to another department. You and your boss will discover your different opinion about your coworker soon enough and then you will be out on your hearing ear with no references  to find a new job.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	You should quit, since your the only one bothered by it. Just quit and let another person be hired that may have a disability. Be disabled does not mean you cant do a job that any other person can do. <br>   Its your problem !|`|FcZU29W6aa	One can only hope that the old saying "What goes around, comes around" . . . we are all anxiously awaiting your turn.

You may not know it but you have a disability as well. Someone as intolerant and believes they are entitled to special treatment and can harass others, for their own selfish ends, lacks the intellectual ability to realize they are not exempt from human rights and employments laws and standards and is as self centred and as socially delayed as you are has a disability.<br>  <br>  Probably some kind of sociopathetic, personality or Narcissistic  disorder IMO Saying she has a pretty nice body only lends to the diagnosis of you having a disability, and one that is very hard to treat in fact so good luck with that. <br>  <br>  Wouldnt you say this sounds like you? I would.<br>  <br>  Narcissistic personality disorder is a condition characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, sense of entitlement, need for admiration, extreme self-involvement, and lack of empathy for others. Individuals with this disorder are usually arrogantly self-assured and confident. They expect to be noticed as superior. However, this disorder is only diagnosed when these behaviors become persistent and very disabling or distressing. <br>  <br>  Sociopathic Disorder They never recognize the rights of others and see their self-serving behaviors as permissible. They appear to be charming, yet are covertly hostile and domineering. They like to dominate and humiliate their victims whenever possible. <br>  <br>  Grandiose Sense of Self <br>  Feels entitled to certain things as "their right." <br>  Lack of Remorse, Shame or Guilt <br>  <br>  Inappropriate anger or rage, which is split off and repressed, is at their core. Does not see others around them as people, but only as targets and opportunities. <br>  <br>  Shallow Emotions <br>  When they show what seems to be warmth, joy, love and compassion it is more feigned than experienced and serves an ulterior motive. Outraged by insignificant matters, yet remaining unmoved and cold by what would upset a normal person. Since they are not genuine, neither are their promises. <br>  <br>  Callousness/Lack of Empathy <br>  Unable to empathize with the pain of their victims, having only contempt for others' feelings of distress and readily taking advantage of them and seeking ways to hurt them.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	You've got more of the problem than she does.

What kind of working environment is this?!  She could get you on some sexual harassment law.

That will not only endear you to your boss (trying to be supportive of his choice of hires) but to your coworker - who is probably quite aware that she has verbal communication difficulties. Not only that, but adding ASL as a skill you possess will increase your earning capacity.<br>  <br>  And last, I would bet once you learn ASL your coworker will be found to have a fabulous sense of humor and true brains -|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Hmmm, she is 'not welcome' ...apparently only by you. The boss thinks she's doing a fine job. If this is a real question & not something you get your jollies doing...then the fact that a disabled person can do a job that is pleasing to the boss & you, a supposed 'normal' person has trouble w/that makes me think you're jealous that she's doing a good job & you don't measure up. Since you've already mentioned this to coworkers, wouldn't it be something if they dropped a not-so-subtle hint to your boss that you were discriminating against her & trying to get her fired??? <br>  <br>  Every person has a right to employment if they are qualified for the job-which she obviously is. There is nothing in the ADA about a deaf or disability quota. You are the one handicapped here...not her. She's overcoming a challenging physical difference; while you, on the other hand, are trying to oust her because she's different. You are closed minded & the best thing would be to look for a new job for yourself. One where all the ppl are exactly like you. I sure hope you don't have any children you are passing along this prejudice to. <br>  <br>  It also sounds like you're sexist & objectify women. That also is a work harrassment case waiting to happen. I'm sure many ppl who know you want to vomit from your attitude...which is something you can do something about. But you are put-off by a speech difference that this women can do nothing about.  <br>  <br>  The best way to be not subtle w/your boss is to tell him it's horrible having to work w/her & she makes you want to vomit. Moreover, tell him about her nice body, but you really want her butt gone. I'm sure he'll get your point and hopefully take immediate action to dismiss the appropriate person....|`|s2aCNJOBaa	You could get sued for job harassment of a PWD on a job.

Try to learn from this experience- stop being so judgmental first of all. <br>  Secondly, you sound like a jerk. Are you being one? Do you actually sit and think about who you are as a person and try to understand why this is such a problem for you? <br>  There are so many "different" people in this world. No ONE person is more important or less so than any other in the eyes of God. Try to see that she is unable to correct this situation and it probably makes her feel bad and insecure too. She has to live with this every day and has yet triumphed over her issues. <br>  <br>  YOU are disabled in a more profound way however. <br>  You're attitude towards others who are different from you is short sided and narrow minded and just plain mean. <br>  You need to look at others beyond the externals.<br>  <br>  Some of us are disabled on the outside where it is visible to all. <br>  Others are disabled on the inside but even more so, like you.<br>  Grow from this.

God answered "Tell then I AM THAT I AM sent you"  The name I AM was spoken several times by Jesus, identifying Himself as God.<br>  He is the creator and the self existent one.  He had no beginning and will have no end.  He exists outside time and space although He can enter time and space and Has full knowledge of all that is in that dimension.<br>  <br>  Nachmoniades in the 12th Century said that there were 10 dimensions that could be deduced from the first chapter of Genesis (He was a Jewish sage)  Today with string theory we have discovered that there are indeed 10 dimensions.  Four we can experience and 6 that can only be referred to mathematically.  Height, width, length and time are the 4 dimensions we are aware of.  The 6 others are curled up in less than 10 to the minus 33 centimetres.  They are spiritual dimensions and do not have the properties that we experience in our reality.<br>  <br>  God can see all of time like it is one page and can tell the beginning from the end. (That's how He can give prophecies that are 100% accurate)  When length is continually split in two at 10 to the minus 33 centimetres it loses locality and is everywhere at once.<br>  It is in contact and has interreaction with all other particles in the universe at the same time.  God dwells in these spiritual dimensions and is not limited to space or time.  He is not limited by anything except His own attributes.  He is the Creator, the Self Existent One.

See this proof for details. <br>  <br>  Many believers try to rationalize God's existence by saying something like this: "The existence of the universe proves God's existence. Something had to create the universe. Science has no explanation for the universe's creation. Therefore, God created it." <br>  <br>  The way to understand that this is a rationalization is to look back in history. Ancient people, before they had science, explained many things that they did not understand with "gods." There have been sun gods, thunder gods, fertility gods, rain gods, etc. <br>  <br>  The Bible works the same way. It tries to explain many things that its ancient authors did not understand by attributing them in God. For example, if you read Genesis 9:12-13 you will find this: <br>  <br>  And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations: I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth..." <br>  <br>  This is the Bible's explanation of rainbows. Of course we now know that rainbows are a prismatic effect of raindrops. In the same way, Genesis chapter 3 tries to explain why human childbirth is so painful and Genesis chapter 11 tries to explain why there are so many human languages. These are myths, nothing more. <br>  In the same way, Genesis chapter 1 contains the Bible's creation myth. The creation of the universe and life is attributed to God. We already know that God had nothing to do with the creation of life, but religious people still try to attribute the creation of the universe to God. <br>  <br>  The fact is, God had nothing to do with the creation of the universe, in the same way that God has nothing to do with the sun rising or rainbows appearing. Science does not have a complete explanation for the universe's creation, yet. While it is true that science does not yet know everything there is to know about the universe, scientists will eventually figure it out. When they do, what they will find is that nature created the universe, not an imaginary being.|`|AA10556726	Sorry, you are making a subjective claim and have no objective evidence to back it up.  Throughout history, many people have converted from one belief to another and they all feel that their new belief is true - your religion is no different.<br>  <br>  And no, once again contrary to your belief, deep down inside everyone is not a belief in any sort of god.  Granted there are reasons why we may mistakenly believe that everything should have meaning and some may be genetically predisposed to "belief", but these do not suggest that everyone has an inherent belief in a deity.

7XuEyRvNaa	If you mean you are watched when you are out even alone, I would label that as Paranoia.     And even If you meant being watched when out with your GF, the only problem is your getting "bothered" by it. I tend to ignore oglers. Since they are not pointing a finger at you and laughing hysterically, they obviously find you interesting and/or are just plain envious? If attention bothers you, you have a self-image problem.    Plus there is nothing wrong with kissing in public. It is understandable not to have sex in public view. You wouldn't want small children seeing it and attempting same. But at least for kissing, personally I don't really care about the world when I am with my partner. When I am with her, it is just her. If someone doesn't likes it they can look away or move away. It is probably wrong to do it in a moving bus, or enclosed space where a person does not have the choice of moving away if they are bothered. But apart from that, it is no business of busybodies. If they bother you they are just frustrated despoes or prudes who are secretly ogling your girl and feeling jealous.    And you like kissing in public but dislike the attention it gets you. That is like saying that "I like swimming but I hate getting wet". Maybe do it in a more discreet place? Like say, a park? or in a remote area inside a car? Or just stop bothering about oglers instead?    And it is normal to be paranoid about being filmed while kissing. There are enough frustrated perverts who go gaga over a couple kissing in real, while having watched another equally real, film actor and actress kissing in movies. Ofcourse you should watch out for perverts. They see enough couples kissing on tv and movies. It doesnt gives them a right to film you without your consent. Else next, they would just be making excuses for filming girls, because "they were pretty" or "they had a good figure." It is pretty okay to beat them up even and smash their cameras.    I can only add that based on your answer to Alexa, you seem to be from some small town. Your confusion seems understandable in that light. It is quite common to see couples kiss in discotheques in mumbai, delhi or gurgaon nowadays, in India. Or even steal kisses in shopping malls or even in cars. Kisses happen on TV and in cinemas all the time nowadays, and nobody objects to those. It might be a big thing in small towns like the one you possibly live in I guess, so you are just not used to it.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	B2B- he just said when he's with the opposite sex not by himself!

You said that it's just when you are being physical with a woman when you are in public, right?  Wasn't there a movie with Ben Stiller (or someone like that) where he was afraid to kiss his girlfriend in public?  Does anyone remember which movie I'm talking about?  I'm just wondering because what did he do about his problem?  Maybe watch that movie.  You need to ask yourself "Why am I afraid of showing affection in public"?  I'm assuming you just mean holding hands, kissing, and hugging, right?  Anything beyond that and that's a good thing that you don't want to be all over each other 'cause most people agree that stuff is better left to the bedroom.  Personally, I'm n ot afraid of being watched and the thought of being "filmed" is a turn on if I'm getting really into it with my guy.  I'm an exhibitionist though, lol!  I was an exotic dancer.   You may want to talk to a therapist about this problem especially if it is ruining your relationships with women or you are really getting totally paranoid about it.  Now, if you feel like you are being watched or filmed a lot then DEFINITELY see a psychiatrist.  Good luck, dude.  I say, RELAX!  It's cute to see a couple in love holding hands or sharing a quick kiss and most of us don't think much of it unless like I said, they are mauling each other or they are celebrities!  Now, if the woman is scantily clad or one or both of you is like really fat (like really obese) or super ugly or super good looking then people may be watching or wanting to film.  Nowadays, so many people have camecorders on their phones that I can see why you may think that way.  I'm probably just making you feel worse.  SERIOUSLY THOUGH!  I WANT TO KNOW!  PLEASE TELL ME!  WHY DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING OR FILIMING YOU WHEN YOU ARE KISSING, HUGGING, OR HOLDING HANDS WITH A WOMAN???|`|AA11605300	I don't know why you should feel so paranoid.

8Nqq7tkwaa	this may help...<br>  <br>  Moved by news of starvation in Ireland, a group of Choctaws gathered in Scullyville, Oklahoma to raise a relief fund. Despite their meager resources, they collected $710 and forwarded it to a U.S. famine relief organization. It was both the most unlikely and the most generous contribution to the effort to relieve Ireland’s suffering. <br>  <br>  Begun two years before in the fall of 1845, the potato blight and subsequent famine had reached its height in 1847. It was, of course, much more than a mere natural disaster. British colonial policies before and during the crisis exacerbated the effects of the potato blight, leading to mass death by starvation and disease. For example, in March of 1847, at the time of the Choctaw donation, 734,000 starving Irish people were forced to labor in public works projects in order to receive food. Little wonder that survivors referred to the year as “Black ’47.”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Nearly 150 years after the Great Potato Famine, a group of Irish people is retracing the "Trail of Tears" from Oklahoma to Mississippi to repay a longstanding debt to the Choctaw Indian tribe.<br>  <br>  Eight people from Ireland began the 500-mile trek from Broken Bow, Okla., to Nanih Waiya, Miss. -- roughly retracing, in reverse, the government-forced relocation of the tribe in 1831 from its homeland to what was then Indian Territory wilderness. Tens of thousands were moved. Nearly half died.<br>  <br>  The Irish connection: In 1847, midway through the Irish famine, a group of Choctaws collected $710 and sent it to help starving Irish men, women and children.|`|B0GujA9Aaa	Both groups have a few things in common: <br>  <br>  The Irish were oppressed by the English. They weren't allowed to speak their language (Gaelic), own the land that they lived on and they had to pay the English for everything: from food, to housing, etc. <br>  <br>  Native Americans were oppressed too. They couldn't speak their languages, observe their religious and cultural beliefs, and they couldn't live on their own land either. <br>  <br>  Both Irish and Native Americans hold their cultural identities strongly.
10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	We had a beautiful garden ceremony. We used vows made up from the traditional ones, still with the "have and to hold, in sickness and health etc. - we just took out any reference to god. My religious mother-in-law was upset but we felt it would be hypocritical of us to have a church wedding and religious ceremony when we weren't religious ourselves. It meant more to us to have our vows witnessed by family and friends than witnessed by god. It's very common these days, civil celebrants are very popular - especially here in Australia.

A little girl of about 7 or 8 was playing in the water.  The tube she had started to float away from her and she started to swim after it - but it kept getting further away.  When she realized she couldn't touch bottom anymore, she panicked and started struggling, went under and gulped down a bunch of water.  Why her parents were sitting on the beach with their backs to the water, I'll never understand, they didn't see or hear this...but I was awaken from my nap by the sound of the little girl choking and splashing, and I dove in.  By the time I got to her, she had gone under again.  I pulled her up and calmed her so she could cough it up and catch her breath, and then swam her back to shore.<br>  <br>  Mary Katherine - I'll never forget her name.

They base their practice on this passage: Mark, Chapter 16, verses 17 and 18. In this passage, Jesus says, "And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." <a href="http://members.tripod.com/Yeltsin/" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/Yeltsin/</a><br>  <br>  PS: I'm an atheist, and I've never worshipped a snake.

AA11403222	The United States (which is the 'we' I assume you are referring to) is Not a theocracy.  We were based on the concept that we were a nation with no one state religion.  A theocracy is based on the idea that the clergy run the government.  This is not the case in the U.S.  But, understand that Christians (of all denominations) are a very large majority, so the majority of moral issues, political aims and lawmaking all come from 'the people' and the majority of the people are Christian and are coming from that paradigm.  Slowly, this Is changing, but it is not going to happen quickly.  In case you are unaware, every generation produces more and more agnostics, atheists or at least questioners, and this will eventually make a difference in the direction of our laws and political makeup.|`|AA11058044	Certainly sounds like one to me.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Yes<br>  <br>  And this is an international forum.

The term “theocracy” is attributed to Jewish historian Josephus of the first century?C.E., who evidently coined it in his writing Against Apion (II, 164, 165 [16]). Of the government established over Israel in Sinai, Josephus wrote: “Some peoples have entrusted the supreme political power to monarchies, others to oligarchies, yet others to the masses. Our lawgiver, however, was attracted by none of these forms of polity, but gave to his constitution the form of what—if a forced expression be permitted—may be termed a ‘theocracy [Gr., the?o?kra?ti′an],’ placing all sovereignty and authority in the hands of God.” To be a pure theocracy, of course, the government could not be ordained by any human legislator, such as the man Moses, but must be ordained and established by God. The Scriptural record shows this was the case.|`|Shi5z6iJaa	yes and look how well these modern theocracies are doing, just look at Iran, Saudi Arabia, you could even say North Korea is a theocracy Kim Jong Il is considered a god

This world is cursed with sin - that is why we have death, disease, war, kids falling in septic tanks, etc. It can also be caused by someone's direct sin. For example, where was the child's mother at that time? She committed a sin of not mothering her child, which resulted in the child's death. Sometimes we die because of our own sins; sometimes we die because of someone else's sin. <br>  God chose Elijah as His Prophet, and so provided for Him when he was cast out from the Israelites.

dB2BRGRAaa	Real things - if I say words like 'tree', 'apple' or 'table', you pretty much instantly know what I'm talking about.  I can add descriptive words that help you understand a bit more about the object 'a red apple', or 'apple tree' but it's still fairly straight forward.<br>  <br>  Perception - how you feel about something as an individual, a 'delicious apple' is my opinion as I think the apple is nice, good or tasty - you might take a bite out of the same apple and decide that it's too sour or too crunchy.<br>  <br>  Conceptual - ideas and thoughts - love, hate, happy, sad, heaven, hell and so on - ask yourself: are you happy?<br>  <br>  Context - 'an apple tree' compared to 'my family tree' are two different things - I couldn't plant my family tree in the garden.<br>  <br>  Society - words are always changing - 'bad' to me may mean 'naughty', to a 16 year old it may mean 'good'.<br>  <br>  Ethnic - American english compared to British english - no one minds in England if you say you're going out 'for a fag' - it means you're going off to smoke a cigarette.  In American english it could be mistaken for something else.<br>  <br>  One thing is certain; no two words in the same language have exactly the same meaning - 'ill' and 'sick' are very similar but 'I'm feeling sick' is different to 'I'm feeling ill'.<br>  <br>  On top of this, words may translate differently in a foreign language, again, this is down to how someone understands the word and even where it comes in the sentence.<br>  <br>  I hope this doesn't leave you more confused than before!|`|ShatBd6Oaa	There is this lovely book called a dictionary. It lists words with their commonly accepted meanings. This is the foundation on which we base our usage of words.<br>  <br>  If I say     -drizlewhip -  you have no idea what I mean. And you won't find it in the dictionary.<br>  <br>  If I use the word  - eleemosynary - you won't know what it means, probably, but you can look in the dictionary and find it. It means having to do with altruistic or charitable activity.<br>  <br>  Invest in a dictionary. You will be able to master the use of words by using their given meaning.<br>  <br>  The same is true in any language. Find the dictionary reference for French or Italian or Spanish or whatever.<br>  <br>  Here's to your vocabulary growth.|`|WxrRRMZUaa	you learn when you grow up, you obtain a response for saying a word, and then you learn what the word means|`|L1D7STYPaa	I think it too. <br>  Because I speak Portuguese and English.<br>  It's little crazy, I don't understand.|`|4iGs4zUkaa	well i know that i think about that too. i've also noticed that sometimes when something is translated from one language to another some things get left out.like the same words mean totally different things in different languages.|`|mUK240ykaa	It's all about social consensus and social control.

If you tell a shoe salesman that the shoe he's trying on your foot is too big and he brings you one in a smaller size, the same thing is true:  "too big" means the same to both of you.  In short if the people we speak to understand our words to mean what we intend them to mean, then those words must must mean what we mean them to mea

Let me put it this way, if they're willing to go that far to protect you, you have some friends who really care about what happens to you. <br>  <br>  As for your virginity, go on some dates. Craigslist someone. Match.com, eharmony, something like that! Not that I have any say in such a decision, but based on my experiences, a virginity lost to someone you love (or at least like!!) is much more fulfilling. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.

hvIrXa9Gaa	Yes, they sometimes they have different lyrics/words, for example the song "Dímelo" by Enrique Iglesias has an English counterpart also by him, it is called "Did You Know", which is very different from the name of the Spanish song, which means "Tell Me (It)". The lyrics are also different.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|nr3sm3u5aa	idk|`|81nGin29aa	Sometimes I wonder what Enrique Iglesias is saying in songs I have on CD/iPod that are done in Spanish if there isn't an English translation.  The only songs by E.I. I found where there's a Spanish version and an English version are "Somebody's Me"/"Alguien Soy Yo", "Sólo En Ti"/"Only You", "Hero"/"Héroe", "Escape"/"Escapar", and "Don't Turn Off the Lights"/"No Apagues la Luz."  I at times wonder if they made or will make an album with the English version of the Spanish-sung song.|`|1kJgH91Jaa	onine translators pretty much suck.<br>  try typing in "como las manzanas" - i got "like apples".<br>  The actual translation - "I eat apples".<br>  <br>  So, a lot of times, spanish songs use slang in their songs, like how we say gotta, shorty, etc. <br>  And, I'm not so sure, but some regions have different words. Like in New Guinea, the word las bananas means bananas, but everywhere else, they say los platanos.<br>  <br>  See what I mean?|`|W4UjWKQtaa	Yes, There is a lot lost in translation.

3fHZOobiaa	It can have two translations; literally this phrase is:    "Ok, fine, I leave her and I don't buy her anymore"    or    "Ok, fine, I leave it and I don't buy it anymore"    but it is a sort of future      But the first translation is quite strange...

Scientists want us to believe that the sun has a gravitation pull strong enough to keep a planet like neptune or pluto in orbit, but then it's not strong enough to keep the moon in orbit? Why is that? What I believe is going on here is this: These objects in space have yet to receive mans touch, and thus have no sin to weigh them down. This isn't the case for earth, where we see the impact of transfered sin to material objects. The more sin, the heavier something is.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	I'm jumping off a cliff right now, see ya|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Gravity is for the birds.|`|FmazIF6Maa	You're right.

If you feel that God is omnipotent and loving, then there is no reason to worry or think about the way things are done on Earth.<br>  <br>  The Bible, and each story in it is fiction due to it's review by peers.  "The Gospel according to...Paul, Mike, Pete, Jim, etc).  Yes, I'm being funny, but you know what I'm talking about.<br>  <br>  God is more than an argument.  God is more than something you can vote on.  God is more than religion, more than me, more than you - God is what YOU want him / her / it to be.<br>  <br>  The Christians want you to have a personal relationship with God.  Well, then do so and do not worry about going to church any longer.  You have a personal relationship, so you don't need to publicize it.  Catholics want you to accept the guilt of original sin, and praise Jesus for his noble death...for those sins.  This is a ridiculous ideology.  If you do not accept JHC as your personal Lord and savior, you're going to burn for eternity.  So let's put this in perspective for a moment...<br>  <br>  A baby is born against all odds.  The mother was hit by a car while pregnant, and she had the baby premature due to her injuries.  The baby struggles to live, and does so.  Many feel it was a 'miracle' and other even preach that it's 'God's Will' that the baby lived.  Then the hospital burned to the ground, killing everyone inside.  Am I to believe that this all-knowing, blessed, omnipotent ruler of all would send that 'miracle baby' to hell because it did not consciously accept JHC?  Am I to believe that the "wonderful, loving, caring, PTA member, suburban soccer coach, always has the best candy for the kids during Halloween" parents are going to hell too?  They lived and loved, but didn't follow any organized religion.  Am I to believe that they too are sentenced to burn for eternity?<br>  <br>  It doesn't make any sense to me.  I have a very strong faith in what some might call 'God', however, I see this higher power in the energy around me.  I see 'God' in myself, the grass, the faces of those I love, the sky, the ocean - you get the point.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question - Heaven is not a destination, my friend.  It is the journey.  If you walk through your life wondering about a destination, you're going to die lost forever. <br>  <br>  Peace, Love, and a million successes to you.<br>  <br>  Blake|`|AA10641825	Oh hey kingdom of heaven is just a figure of speech.|`|621a4d17d13b63e02ffc57e463e95ed2aa	Well, even though America (as with many free and democratic nations) is obviously without a "king" so to speak, ironically, the USA is considered a "sovereign nation - a master of her destiny. So, with that in mind, you must realize that the republic and democracy of America comes with the notion that it is good and right to have many people who are perfectly able to lead.  This may seem like a contradiction, but it also can make for a much more dynamic and powerful nation...<br>  <br>  And from those many, We are One...<br>  <br>  I rest my case...<br>  <br>  p.s...: about being cut and dried and obvious. As you are correct in recognizing that God is the God among gods and Lord among lords, then perhaps there is something else going on that most of us don't always know about...  In other words and to put it quite bluntly, if things were cut and dried and obvious it would be a lot easier for someone to take control that we wouldn't want in power....<br>  Just something to think about...

NOTc1b9saa	Hello..After World War 2, the Earth*s energy was SO low that she cried out for help as she was close to losing her Light altogether due to the amount of negative energy in, on and around the Planet, and Heaven responded by asking for *old Soul* volunteers to come to Earth from other Star systems bringing their Light and Love, in addition to beaming Light Energy to us here on Earth..They are sometimes known as Starseeds..    Prior to that, the *graph* indicating the Light within humanity and Earth was showing a steady downward drift and was heading for an anticipated nuclear armageddon in the late nineties, but when the Angels checked that *graph* in 1962 (it is checked very 25 yrs), that downward spiral had begun to level off, indeed to begin to rise, and Heaven then pressed the accelerator and increased the number of Older Souls coming to Earth, now with ever more sensitive bodies, reflecting the increased Light within humans on Earth,  that enabled them to express more of their natural spiritual abilities or *gifts*..    Taking advantage of that situation, around 1987 when humanity collectively chose to ascend from 3D back to 5D (happening NOW) which was our natural level prior to the *fall*, 13,000 yrs ago, ever more evolved Souls have been coming to Earth, intitially the Indigos, so called because of that colour being strongly shown in their auras, who were very sensitive, loving, and wise beyond their years but finding it difficult to deal with any disharmony in their lives, their sensitivity often resulting in conditions such as ADD and ADHD as well as negative reactions to colourings and additives in food and drink..They are often naturally clairvoyant and telepathic, and will be the *leaders* of the future..Books have been written about them..The Kryon, the Magnetic Master, has told of them in his teaching books, see KRYON.COM    The Crystals represent the next level of sensitivity and awareness in those incoming Souls and are even more sensitive, sometimes with a nearer 5D awareness which can cause many problems and in extreme circumstances, can trigger that known as Autism, for some of them simply cannot fit in with our current 3D linear consciousness, although that IS changing now as we move towards the changes to our consciousness completing in 2012.That is why our time at present is passing by faster and faster, in fact we are now down to the equivalent of just 14 hrs a day!.Of course the clocks remain the same but our experiencing of time is changing..    Most recent are the Rainbow children who are the next level, some being born COMPLETELY telepathic and able to link with one another around the world on their own level, as can some Indigos and Crystals..    Yes, of course there are quite a large number of Adult Indigos around also, but the *mass numbers* have been coming in increasingly over the past twenty years approx..Mail me if you need any further info..    Blessings.>Terry S|`|oojO4WAraa	It is a crazy term people apply to their children.  Just one more way for them to say "MY CHILD IS SO SPECIAL".  These people that say that are delusional.
KrkftOfkaa	Personally, I'd beat him over the head with the books he ruined.  Then step over his unconcious body on my way to the phone to call McD's and report his theft from the store.  Then continue out the door with all my belongings and never look back.

He deliberately defaced your books out of his inferiority complex and you're worried about being nice?

You will eventually have to get rid of him because of his jealousy.  Tell him that if he makes any more derogatory remarks/   does nothing to improve himself - job wise, or marks up your books again ... he goes.    Let him THIS IS NOT NEGOTIABLE...   also TELL HIM you don't rag on him about working at McD's   Make him replace the text books too.    BTW... by knowing he steals from his boss you are also guilty... tell him you will report him if he does it again..    On second thought just get rid of the jerk!  bad news all around.    DON'T TRY NICELY... go for the throat!|`|zhk8o514aa	First replace the books, then replace HIM.|`|3ea5199bfc214dd30a610b6a9a12f8e4aa	If he's willing to maliciously destroy books that are important to your job just because of jealousy, no telling what else he would do.  He has some issues with himself not being all that he is able to be especially having a relationship with a strong independent woman.  If he loves you being able to flat out tell him to stop what is happening and replace the damaged books should be easy.  Just let him know.  If he gets offended, then he shouldn't have done it in the first place.  It's time to spank his little bottom, because his actions are those of a toddler.  Good luck...|`|OtfSP7kHaa	Shove that marker up his...|`|mlmSRkhGaa	Your question does not sound genuine to me.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	Why would you want a man that wasnt going to stand behind you and support you in your career?  I wouldn't tolerate that behavior for a minute.  That would be like you calling his boss and telling them that he takes money from the registar.  Your relationship will never work if you can't support each other's sucess and seems to jealous to be able to do that.  Find yourself a man that isn't affriad of an independent woman.  Good luck hon and don't sell yourself short in the relationship department.|`|0SJU52yJaa	I'm with Billy Bob Jr. on this one, but in opposite order, replace HIM, then replace the books, so that way he won't have a chance to ruin them again before you dump his butt.|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	I have a hard time believing this is a serious question.

sGojEWOxaa	It helps in many ways, one way is that it helps us to keep our flesh under subjection.  If we pray and fast, we are able to get in tune with God more easily.  I have seen results when I have prayed and fasted, that did not come with prayer alone.  My husband was an alcoholic, who enjoyed getting drunk and acting like a fool on a regular basis.  It was hard to live with him, not only for me, but also for my two children.  I began to pray and fast for him, and my pastor and pastor's wife joined me, several people in our church went on a chain fast for him, for one week.  At the end of that week (on Sunday) he repented of his sins before he even came to church.  He came to church with me that Sunday, and gave his life to the Lord.  He has not touched alcohol since then - glory be to God.  Fasting and prayer are spiritual things, and I do not understand HOW they work, I only know that they do.|`|AA11686091	It helps to focus your mind when you fast and have given up something for the purpose of praying.  Sometimes the answers come after the fast is over.|`|zFM5HeLjaa	It shows that we hunger and thirst for the Lord. We only think of the Lord in earnest prayer|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	Lots of really awesome answers here. I cannot add a thing. I have had a poor record on fasting. The one prolonged Fast I went on, over 30 days, was with a very wrong attitude. I swore that I would get what I wanted from God, or die. I almost did die, and subsequently back slid for the next 5 years. That was 20 years ago next December, and try as I have, I cannot seem to Fast today. I just can't do it ! I try, but I cannot.

However, if I'm really upset about something I will fast.

It also proves you really want an answer. A child's persistence in asking for something from Dad is a good example.|`|Z6TNsJluaa	It help the the spirit of man be more in tune with the Holy Spirit of God. Fasting denies the flesh and enhances the Spirit. It bring the body into submission when God can bring forth healing. Eating is the number one way that brings sickness and diseases to the body. The foods we eat are mostly contaminated with poisons and preservatives which slowly break down the immunity system and make us acceptable to all sorts of sicknesses. God has designed fasting to not only draw us closer to him in power and glory but it is God's way to help us live healthier and longer being bless of Him..Yes, Jesus knew the power behind fasting and there is a divine anointing for those who do. They have a closer relationship with the Lord and they are given His power over demons. Many believers has experienced deliverance, healing, breakthroughs in their marriage, breakthroughs in their businesses, breakthroughs in their relationships with their children and even in the area of the finances..And It also shows by some of the lame answers I read that there are those who are in need of fasting and deliverance themselves...|`|xTriyfWuaa	weakening the body helps the onset of hallucinations. of course, people dont fast like they use to.|`|RtvAu2Hcaa	It doesn't.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Low blood sugar makes you weak and more susceptible to suggestion. Also, it makes some people see and hear things.|`|qtXsNipdaa	Fasting is simply denying your soul.  It doesn't mean going on a hunger strike.  It means denying yourself of something that keeps you from Christ.  It is meant to make your soul weak so your spirit man (woman) can be made strong.  You can fast soda, food, tv, radio, etc.|`|RqFQgYBbaa	Fasting is not making a deal with God, it is simply pushing back your plate and praying. I don't consider it fasting if you skip a meal w/o praying. I don't really know how it helps us except that we get more time with God and more time in prayer. Praying is very important!|`|cd2etz5Raa	Here's a star. :)    The point of fasting is to spend less time doing one thing, and instead dedicating that time to the Lord. This does not mean that if you're fasting from watching TV for a week that you have to spend time praying - you could spend time singing songs of worship, reading the Bible, or just being with God. It's also a statement, something like, "God, I'm chosing to spend this time with You instead of eating a meal." or "watching TV." or whatever else you decide to fast from.    You'd be amazed by how much closer you can grow in your relationship with the Lord simply by fasting.|`|JuvkVZvnaa	because food deprivation is a know mind control technique|`|8rGZFBKOaa	I can't speak for others, but for me, fasting helps me to stay focused. I also believe that fasting produces something in the spiritual realm that alerts others spiritually, and arms us with some kind of additional spiritual armor - stronger, tougher somehow. This has been my observation during and as a result of fasting and prayer days over many, many years.|`|mNyhRGowaa	It is the putting off of the flesh for communion with God purposely. Things of the flesh are flesh and things of the spirit are spirit. so to pray and at the same time think about lunch kind of throws a wrench in the whole spiritual sense of the purpose filled fast. Fasting is for a purpose ( Gods purpose) for answered prayer, Healings, spiritual growth, and many other Godly things) It is not something we go around and brag about it is communion with the holy spirit.|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	I'm not sure, other than to point out the obvious fact that God asked us to do it, so it must be for our own good. Might as well obey God, and see what he does.    Obviously fasting has something to do with self denial & self control, and it seems to be a form of sacrifice.  Making a sacrifice for God is our way of saying to God that he is more important to us than whatever it is that we are giving up.  True love requires sacrifice.|`|ilVYi21naa	Pray with hungry?. Then you can cry with weakness.    But ask your GOD, you have the rights!    Fasting means relinquish, renounce, give up yourself.|`|jWUHf4rRaa	I think it helps you get ready for the rapture

Listless - you should visit the www.dnaancestry.com for documented DNA evidence of how the human genome has mutated over the last 100,000 years.    BTW: You say that it's defined in Biology textbooks, but the Creationists have managed to pressure schoolboards and textbook companies to take Evolution OUT of the textbooks in many states.  In Texas, for instance, kids are not allowed to be taught Evolution in public schools!  Thank goodness there are other avenues because the rest of the free world doesn't have to contend with this nonsense!|`|26DoxkOBaa	We want science to admit that evolution was obviously intelligently designed and isn't just a fluke of random events and for science to stop it's suppression of the logical and rational summation that life has a creator of infinite intelligence working behind evolution.

We need to prove not only that there can be morality without Religion but also where morality and humanity come from.     Religion has hijacked human nature claiming the 'good' parts for themselves and the 'bad' for the devil, (neuro-phsychology can prove this) and we need to re-assert ourselves. Well before any kind of religion we nurtured our children and loved our 'neighbours' (or not lol).    The only reason religion survives is because it takes a lot of studying psychology, sociology, history, philosophy etc and some experience of life to put all that into perspective. People are not inherently lazy. 'Sloth' is something taught to most of us by our lazy parents, peers and society in general. TV has to be seen as a pure poison in this respect. Not just TV but the culture of fame and riches.     I like to think that before we destroy the Earth that mankind can gain enough of an understanding that there may be an infinite future for us. Hey there's nothing wrong with hope! I'll be 'damned' if I have to change all of my vocabulary so that it doesn't sound religious OR give up on all those things that Religion hijacked and nature created,    What more proof do creationists need than that The Story of Jesus had been told tens of times before He was born.|`|buUTakKAaa	science dosent make who i am.      i read that no actual evidence has ever been found to prove evolution    i believe in God and always will     stop trying to brainwash me with your ignorance    if you like science so much go read a biology book|`|uurTX7POaa	Evolution is taught in ALL Catholic schools.

And when the herd is hunted, it’s the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members.<br>  <br>  In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Now, as we know, excessive intake of alcohol kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.

WbaN6osZaa	I think you'll only find that atheists have a problem with bigoted religious teachings that are rooted in spreading fear via superstition and dishonesty in order to proliferate.    That doesn't cover all 'theism' does it?    Pantheism doesn't label non-believers as 'corrupt' does it.  Maybe you should ask why Christians take it on the nose personally when someone says 'there is no evidence of a God'    Fireball illustrates the point perfectly, any disbelief in deities is 'proof' of someone's 'dishonesty', 'irresponsibility' and 'self-interest'.      The irony is deafening.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	"It merely suggests that some atheists reactions to negativity regarding their beliefs (or lack there of) could almost be construed AS religion."    Should we just take it? We used to get killed, burned at the stake and such. Then, we were just imprisoned or lost or careers and homes if we were vocal about our lack of belief. Now, we just can't have a political career, mention atheism in mixed company or answer questions like 'what church do you go to' without subjecting ourselves to insults, suspicions, harassment and death threats.    Last year, in this town just north of mine, a woman and her son were found murdered in a ditch. Parts of them had been cut off. She was a local activist for the separation of church and state and had been killed because she was an atheist. It wasn't even called a hate crime. That's how the world works.    I'm glad we don't get killed very much anymore, but if we shut up now, we'll never make the progress we need to make. George Bush Sr. (remember he was president just over 12 years ago), said he didn't think atheists even counted as citizens.     Just look at Fireball's answer! Apparently that girl thinks we don't believe just so that we don't have to face consequences for our massive sinning (I've seen more Christians sin than anyone else, but whatever). I doubt her intelligence and maturity, but her sentiment is much more common than it should be. We're viewed as amoral deviants who can't be trusted. We're more hated in this country than convicted criminals are.    We would still be BBQ on sticks if we didn't 'carry on' like we do. If we don't continue to react, we'll stay where we are: a misunderstood, reviled minority. I don't want my children to have to go through what I did as an atheist in public school. I don't want them to feel like they have to hide their beliefs just to placate intolerant Christians. So anytime I see a statement like in Fireball's answer, I'm going to say something. If most or all atheists are united in that sentiment, so much the better.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	don't let religion control you|`|LjsRfaskaa	It is a conundrum that believing in nothing is believing in something. :)    The believers just can not conceive of  the non existence for thier whole life in other people. It would cause a chink in thier thinking and the possibility of being wrong,  would'nt it. So they refuse any objectivity and deny the possibility. Ostridges come to mind.

Nothing about any of those experiences suggests they necessarily correspond to something external - they could simply be anomolies of the nervous system - so those who use them to support belief in a deity are simply fooling themselves. That's why the distinction is important.|`|AA11987172	Conversely, why do some Christians (fundies) deny the existence of the hundreds of other gods, but get their panties in a twist when someone denies the existence of theirs?|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Calling Atheism a religion is like calling bald a hair color. - Don Hirschberg|`|GGUDvicaaa	Hi, cute panda!

I can't speak for the Atheist, but I myself sometimes feel as though religion is shoved in my face.  I get sick and freakin' tired of the Jehovah Witnesses' knocking on my door.  I don't go to their church and push my beliefs on them.  I get sick of hearing "you're going to hell" because I don't believe a certain way.  I think that God is in everything and there is so much hypocrisy in religion that we don't want every law or action taken depicted by a bible that know one can confirm is accurate in any way, shape or form.  I don't think they would react as they do if people with religion acted as they did, keep it to yourself and those like you.  Atheist don't go around preaching their beliefs, and I think they're just asking that it's not done to them.

2nRjy734aa	Good question for the people who INSIST on labeling biracial people ONE race. The people who say they don't care are the ones who are part of the problem of the unjust and often racist mislabeling of biracial people. <br>  <br>  It does not matter what biracial people "look" like - they are what they are. If you're judging by looks alone, than a Latino person or a person from any other race that looks black is black, and that's ludicrous. If you're judging by "treatment" or "experience", than any race from "the hood" or discriminated against like black people is then black. That's ignorance. Biracial people, like all other races, inherit 50% of their DNA from each parent, meaning they carry the genetic markers of both the white and black race. Their skin is just *one* of those genetic traits and does not justify claim to a race. Biracial people are just that, TWO races. Any other label is advocacy for internal segregation.|`|IavysDu6aa	Who said they weren't black?The only one of them that actually can pass as white is Wentworth Miller.And really how long must this so called blackness go on?I mean if Wentworth Miller has kids with a white woman and if his kids look whiter than him should they he call them black?And what about if each generation keeps having whiter children?Should they continue this black legacy?<br>  <br>  I mean I known and seen mixed people that look whiter than white people.I kinda just happened to be one of those white mulattoes.Like Wentworth.|`|9d4e3560f61a76beb8498b5bda49ba46aa	I consider them all to be members of the Black Race.  I'm half-black and half-white, very light skinned and I consider myself to be a member of the Black Race.  Moreover, where did you get this idea from that these celebrities are not considered black?  Did you do a survery of the American public?  What do you have to back up such an assertion?  For all of time in America, mixed race people (such as these light-skinned celebrities you mentioned) have always been to some extent, considered a part of the Black Race.  Nothing has really changed that.  Besides, have you bothered to write and ask THEM what they consider themselves to be or are you just assuming?  My daughter is WHITE-SKINNED, BLUE-EYED and is easily mistaken for "white", yet she identifies as black and is definitely a part of the Black Race.  And believe me, to white supremacists, neo-nazis and the like, a biracial's white blood doesn't mean a thing!  According to such people we mulattoes are ALL CONSIDERED TO BE BLACK, but for all the WRONG reasons.|`|YeZvTjFtaa	They are not considered black b/c they don't look black.<br>  <br>  Honestly it doesn't matter what their parents are.

xKAsKVH9aa	This is just a try, I hope it would be alright:    The book "The Body" by Stephen King is very interesting. It is a suspense, just like most Stephen King novels, about 4 kids trying to find the corpse of Ray Brower, a kid who has disappeared.The book is interesting in many ways, and shows the many thrilling scenarios the kids get into.    The book is suitable for teenagers as the characters are teenagers themselves. The story projects many issues amongst teenagers present in the real world, which in turn, makes teen readers relate with the characters easier.    The book was also not difficult to read. It was written with the notion that teenagers would be able to understand the book.|`|ilz08Y3taa	"The Body" by Stephen King is a very interesting and suspenseful book about four kids that search for a corpse of Ray Brower, a kid who disappeared and no one found him. In a way, many interesting and suspenseful things happen to them.     The book is suitable for teenagers because it's about four kids in an adventure and the kids are teenagers. In the story they talked about problems that teenagers had with their parents and with friends.        The book is also written at a teenage level.|`|XWrojqwQaa	If you want me to correct that paragraph then:    The book "The Body" by Stephen King is very interesting and it is full of suspense, it is about four kids that search for the corpse of Ray Brower, the kid that disappeared and was never found. As the plot unfolds many interesting things happen to the kids and the sense of suspense is heightened.     The book is suitable for teenagers because it's about four teenagers in an adventure. In the story they show and solve problems that many teenagers have with parents and friends.    The book is also written to match the lexis of teenagers.      If this is homework i recommend:   Not using the word "kids" but isntead using teenagers or children   Use different words to interesting for example use fascinating

OiAl6w48aa	Yes he can, and it is perfectly legal.  Employers are allowed to set reasonable standards for a dress code so long as they are enforced across the board.

I believe you have to read your work contract if this is mentioned how you need to wear your hair.. if it states you need to wear it open... I believe this is more a fetish of the boss and has nothing to do with work ethics.. and his wife of course wants to make him happy so she wears her hair down.. so if you want to stay in this job.. I guess it's a small price to pay to comply with their weird wishes and wear it as they ask you to.. I believe they have a hair fetish.. I am sure they have no legal leg to stand on to force you to do this.. but I am sure your other colleagues do it if they have long hair.. if they are female..

7XuEyRvNaa	I agree with you. Ram sene had a valid point. We have by and large, abandoned our ancient glorious Hindu culture. As a Hindu, I have read the puranas. Here is my understanding of our culture.    1) Apparently wine(somarasa) was drunk by gods and kings alike. So assuredly going to pubs is not so against our culture after all? Or do you mean we should label kingfisher as "somarasa" to make it okay?    2) The ancient paintings and statues show people dressing up in just a dhoti. Even women would just tie a cloth(kanchuki) around their chest for modesty. It even made sense in hot Indian climate. The western victorian culture brought by British, now makes people dress up in head to toe. Why did you old folks abandon the glorious ancient indian dressing and adapt the western Victorian dressing sense?    3) In the ancient city of Vaishali, they had elected Amrapali as the "Nagarvadhu". Even heaven had apsaras, who apparently had many different partners. In order to reestablish our Indian culture, please ask some females you know, to volunteer.    4) Ancient figures like Ved Vyasa, Vidur, Karna, Hanuman's son Angad etc. were apparently all born out of wedlock. Ved Vyasa's mother even married another guy(the father of Bhishma). I suppose you want this brought in fashion again?    5) It Our culture has examples of men and women having multiple husband and wives. Krishna had 16,000 wives. Draupdi had 5 husbands. Do you recommend that we scrap the Monogamy laws?    6) As per Mahabhartha and Ramayana, if someone steals your land, wife or stuff etc., it is a man's duty to go and collect an army and kill the bad guys and all their friends and relatives etc. A neighbour stole flowers from my lawn last week. He also encroached on my land. I would like to follow the example of Ramayana and Mahabharata, but apparently police will throw me in jail or hang me, if I attempted to follow our culture. Please advice.    I fully agree with you and Ram Sene that we should stick to our own actual culture. For one thing, it sounds much more interesting.    I have one question though. In light of above points, what is exactly the difference between Indian culture and Western culture? I am a bit confused. Which problems of ours will be solved by embracing our above heritage?    The problem with majority of such so-called "Indians"(which includes you as well unfortunately) is that you actually are clueless about what our culture is. What you really dislike is empowered women and change. Our society has always been very permissive. The so-called present culture is itself a mashed import of Afghan invaders and the Victorian British invaders.  Even the Britishers themselves have abandoned those old-fashioned values they imposed upon us once. But since that is all you and Ram Sene have known, that is what you are trying to protect.    There is no "problem" with society, save some people's inability to deal with Change.    --------------------------------------...    turnpike, I am really curious how in your opinion, India will walk to destruction? It has survived for last 10,000 years and lived through two foreign invasions.     And you are a fricking deserter half-angrez? And you dare to tell me about MY culture? What a first class ******** you are!!! If you are american what would you know about a country you dont even live in? Stop trying to tell us Indians what our culture should be, you ******** christian american!!!!  Stop trying to mislead my countrymen, you foreigner! I have always lived here in India! you don't! Get lost!|`|qCr1dNspaa	Sure they can "talk" but ram sena would rather blow people up than forge a legitimate conversation.  Extremists want their way or no way.  They are irrational and its no use trying to compromise with the irrantionals.|`|AA10329469	Ask ram sena to build consensus ,have a following and reflect that through the acceptance by the society.We are a democracy and should follow the norms of free will.|`|AA10225835	Do you mean we should stick strictly to our culture and traditions - yes we should - we must not change ? is that what you mean. then    let us do it.    No selling beer...  NO valentine's day    No rock shows    No PUBS    but we will have      child marriages  Sthi - burning women when her husband dies  Devadasi - making women naked and offering them to god and no marriages later.|`|IC06Iwhraa	Although, i dont agree to the approach of ram sena but i respect their idea. You are right about the pseudo american culture that exists in indian society.. My fellow stupid indians are blinded by wrong perceptions.. What you say is 100% right and you speak the truth my friend, Indeed you do..|`|0b769407ee4c099ebeaa87102bcc7fdaaa	Turn Pike Surfer,    You are not really asking any question, since you are just pushing an agenda by supporting it with straw-man arguments.    Both loverboy and Hindian put their points well. Since you are being narrowminded and unwilling to listen, you just dismissed them without any actual arguments as to why they were wrong. I don't think you wanted an answer except to tell others how they should act.    Alcohol abuse has been happening in earlier this century, last century and before. Many ancient figures were known alcoholics(eg. Mirza ghalib). There are literally billions of villagers who make their wife work while they blow all the money on taadi/desi wine. Are they influenced by western culture in villages? Government sells wine. What is your point? i.e. beyond that women should not be allowed to drink.    What exactly is the problem with regulated prostitution? As long as a girl is not forced into it, you have something against it? For one thing, it would lead to less rapes since all the despoes could just goto a brothel instead. Like hindian said, ancient india had such stuff. It is legal in singapore and semi-legal in Japan. Nobody is forcing anyone from your family to participate either. So what is really bothering you? Free sex happens all the time in villages. Know about your country please. Urban middle class is not all of India.     Gun culture. What about it? World is not America. Guns are illegal in many western countries and lots of criminals in India have guns. What about it?    Drug culture... you mean like bhaang(Cannabis/Marijuana) that has always been quite common in India?     Mass Suicides? At least even americans call them cult fanatics/idiots. On the other hand we always glorified Johar done by Hindu princesses and wives. The satis get worshipped. It was the westerner influence that stopped the latter at least. You have a selective memory or lack knowing Indian history.    False court cases happen in India all the time. People sue their parents over property in India. Indian history is full of brothers fighting over property and kingdoms.    How will legalizing Gays and Lesbians have a "spill over" effect? Are you afraid that you will be tempted to become gay if it was legal? Just curious how this spill-over effect will happen and how it will affect you. How can one become confused about being gay? Either you want to do it or you don't. Do you feel you would want to have gay sex, just because a gay guy tried to "confuse" you?    Your arguements are nonsensical. You are merely trying to preach your viewpoint to others without having any real argument or historical example.    Grow up please!|`|LHoRxfBxaa	Pike, are you aware what the words "loaded question" mean? You are coming across as a first class prick/twat. It is funny how your questions and replies are so loaded with bias.    What makes you assume that the crapped people were saving Indian culture? Because they said so? Culture is formed by people. So who are these bunch of goons to dictate it a majority, by force? It is not as if someone went and forced their daughter and wives to drink or wear sphaghettis? So what is their bloody problem???!!!     If you are half-American, you and your family have already abandoned our culture. So if you haven't even lived in India and faced the life here, who are you, as a deserter, to comment on our(as opposed to yours) culture?     You are just confused since as a brownie you are neither totally accepted by americans, and nor are you able to fit in with us Indians anymore. You like to fantasize about how things were somehow magically better for previous generation americans. Or how we Indians had a "glorious" pasts, and now you feel angst and anger about the world not living in your imagined "glorious past" anymore.    Funny part is, in almost every period since ancient times, people have been yapping about "the no-good youngsters doing new-fangled confusing dis-respectful stuff".     You need a therapist to cure you of this depression and identity crisis. And when you ask a question, stop framing it as an pre-canned biased opinion. Else you just come off as a homophobic republican prude prick!

Becayse anything you put ur mind to u can achieve, but most ppl have a problem with PUTTING their mind to it, simply because they jave so many beliefs, fears, and doubts that stop them from achieving what they would like.

633c51fbc855774b16ecddb42fad92ccaa	I'd like to preface this with the fact that I am not a monotheist (jew, christian, or muslim) and do not claim expertise in any of their tenants. I've just used what I know and a little research... this will help, but you and your husband will need to do a bit more research to find what will actually work for you.<br>  <br>  The term your actually looking for is "halal" commonly referred to as "Islamic Kosher" which is a somewhat misleading phase. The fact that you used the word "kosher" instead of "halal" implies that either you are not a practicing muslim and/or your husband has not taught you the proper name used to describe acceptable Islamic dietary practices.<br>  <br>  The term "kosher" originates from Judaism and though there may be some similarities in the dietary guidelines presented in both holy books there are differences in which foods are allowed and how they must be prepared. What may be "kosher" for a jew may not be "halal" for a muslim. This article below gives an example, particularly pertaining to meat:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://meat.tamu.edu/kosher.html" rel="nofollow">http://meat.tamu.edu/kosher.html</a><br>  <br>  What you need to look for are "halal restaurants" and "halal grocery stores" which can be difficult in the U.S. unless you happen to live somewhere with a large muslim population where there may be specialty stores that cater to the muslim culture. Similar to how large cities tend to have a "china town" area that often has small shops and restaurants that provide the more "exotic stuff" that are cultural elements only found in homeland China. <br>  <br>  Thing is "china towns" are fairly common, many large cities have a big enough Chinese population that allow these small specialty businesses to thrive... but not many cities have large muslim societies, which is why finding halal restaurants/grocers can be difficult. I did a quick google search for "halal restaraunts" and "halal grocery" and this sight came up on both:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zabihah.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zabihah.com/</a><br>  <br>  On the left side, if you hit the little arrow on the drop down box for United States it shows how many locations exist (as determined since the site's last update) in particular states. The top 3 are California (652), New York (449), and Texas (315) while the bottom are Montana (0), South Dakota (0), and Wyoming (0). If you punch in your zip code on the search bar it will bring up any nearby locations.<br>  <br>  If there are no locations in your area you can try to move to an area where more of these locations can be found. If moving is not particularly feasable in the near future I have one last idea...<br>  <br>  Look into shopping organic grocery stores, the foods wil not have pesticides, hormones, synthetic chemicals, genetic alteration, or artificial flavoring. Organic food is supposed to be "truly all natural" meats come from animals that have not been treated with antibiotics, hormones, or genetic treatment and fed only organically grown plants. This site will help you locate an organic grocery store and it will probable be easier finding one of these that a halal grocery.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.organicstorelocator.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.organicstorelocator.com/</a><br>  <br>  Keep in mind that all natural organic food does not mean it is "halal" only that it is a bit purer (in a less toxic sense) than the common non-organic stuff. You will still have to carefully read labels to make sure processed organic foods with meat do not contain pork, but you'll know unproccesses cuts of meat will be "natural" and in a sense "what god made" without much interference from man.<br>  <br>  Still, even being "natural" the way in which the anamals were slaughtered may not meet the standards for being "halal" so you may have to become vegitarians and forgo all meats, not just pork. <br>  <br>  Then again it may be possible (expensive, but possible) to special order bulk quantities meats from a halal grocery store (every few months or so to stock up) and have them delivered to you from where ever they are. Stick the meat in a couple of large freezers and just thaw out cuts as you need them.|`|pw4Cb45Kaa	Become a vegetarian.

YMmrXvG7aa	hey i'm a korean and frankly speaking, you cant understand korean when you don't even know how to read, write or speak it!<br>  <br>  Its not like your brain is divided into four sections and each section is in charge of listening, speaking, writing and reading respectively. All the four parts are closely related with one another and overlap. You can't master just one part-that's absurd.<br>  <br>  there are some steps you need to take in order to learn a new language. most importantly, you need to be able to know korean letters (hangul) and read korean! That is the basics. you cant just skip the first and most essential step and expect to understand korean!<br>  <br>  By the way, korean may be really difficult for foreigners because you need to know a lot of idioms and expressions. There are also so many words to express the same thing but all the words have subtle difference- it's difficult for foreigners to grasp the nuance.<br>  <br>  China had some major influence on Korea in the past, so 70% of korean are based on chinese(this is really difficult to explain. it would take ages...). Although written in Hangul, many of korean words have chinese origin. Therefore you also need to learn some chinese!<br>  <br>  See... korean is just not that easy. i dont want to break your hope but that's the fact.|`|KRTPJP2baa	I have no idea but Korean has been said to be the most difficult language for any foreigner to master.|`|Xsen794Aaa	Without any interaction, I'd say it's impossible to learn that way if you don't speak any of the language right now.<br>  <br>  You should at least get something to help you and learn Hangul. <br>  <br>  Rosetta Stone works.  I only did a little of the Korean one (about a week) and I was on the bus today and there was this old Korean lady on the phone with her mom and I understood a lot of what she was talking about.|`|l0jixLszaa	Ok, let's be serious. If you want to learn a 2nd language, you would expect lots of things or whatever you want to extract from it. It really doesn't matter if it's Korean or Chinese, Japanese, French. It's really like learning a new music instrument (guitar, drum or trumpet) when you get old enough. Now, if you really want to learn something, then the best way is to get together with the real people who's using it all the time. Like the gentleman said above, the old Korean lady might be the best way to learn the language from. But in reality, I'd recommend you to go to Korean church near your place, and attend Sunday service regularly. And then ask any of those to get together for anything, such as lunch or small cell group meeting. Then you will gradually get to know what they really watch on TV and talk about and start to pick up the words and expressions as you wish. Remember, no pain no gain. So keep it up. Thanks.|`|HFhmsjJbaa	How long would it take? I started studying intensely 2 months ago. I first learned to read and write because it's very difficult to learn that language if you do not know how to read and write first. You'll understand when you get into it. Romanized korean is pretty much impossible to read and the worst example on how to really pronounce things in korean.<br>  Basically. I'm already speaking basic korean and have about 200 words in my vocabulary. For you to really understand conversations though you're going to need at least 2,000-3,000 words in your vocabulary. There are a lot of good books to get started with to see if you really want to learn the language. If I was you, I'd start with something like the books Your first 100 words in korean and Read & Speak korean for beginners. Getting an english-korean dictionary will be a must also. Good luck!|`|3yaBcA76aa	Korean is one of the most difficult languages for an English-speaker to learn. It would take at least a year and a half of intense study to meet any kind of fluency.<br>  <br>  Language learning is a serious undertaking and requires many hours - even years - of work. Some would even say that it takes a lifetime. Are you willing to devote the time and effort?
