20090307174011AAXgO4m	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I persuade my father to let me get a laptop?	My mom is fine with it but father will not let me get one. I said I would pay for have of the one I want. I think it's a trust issue with my dad. He keeps going on and on about internet predators and I don't even have myspace or facebook! It's ridiculous because I'm more responsiple than most of the people my age. I keep my grades up and do my chores etc...      So, what are some ways to persuade my father to let me get a laptop?   I've even considered writing a persuasive essay to him.      Thank you!
20090307174241AApIg8b	Family & Relationships;Family	Son and paying rent when goes to boot camp?	My son is thinking about going to the National Guard and his boot camp is 4 mths long and he is asking if he still needs to pay rent when he goes ? He now pays $ 200.00 a month just for rent I pay all util.etc. He has 2 cars in my garage and his room of course is all full of his stuff and the garage has a lot of his stuff as well and the crawl space as well, so he will leave a lot of stuff behind . So as a parent what do I do ? And what should I still charge him ? He is 21 and if he was in a apt. they would still charge him full rent cause he is still there in a sense.

20090307174301AA8uHyj	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm sociable but I rarely hang out with people outside of school?	At school I'm outgoing. I speak my mind in class, get along with almost everyone in my grade, say hello to people in the halls, and have a group of friends that i eat lunch with every day. However, I only have two friends that I hang out with outside of school, but I don't see them during the school day, and lately they've been blowing me off. I've tried to expand the people I hang out with so I asked a girl that i've been casual friends with for a while to hang out but she got "sick" last minute and I found out that she had been at a crazy party the night before and had a hangover. I feel like the majority of the kids at my school drink and it's really hard because all of my classes are with a group of about 20 kids that I can't see myself hanging out with ("AP kids") Adding more extra-curriculars to meet people is not an option as I barely have time to hang out as it is. Any suggestions?

20090307175550AA2iDZo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you and your spouse were buying a house, would you move here?	My husband and I live in New Hampshire.  The houses here are ridiculously expensive.  Our budget is about $180,000 for our starter home that we're looking to buy soon.  To give you an idea, in New Hampshire that gets you typically something older, about a 2 bedroom, 1 or 2 bath, 1300sq feet.   Yeah, I know... $180,000 doesn't buy you much in New Hampshire!  We are moving out of state in a few years after we flip our starter home.      ANYWAY.      We found a house that is 4 bedroom, 2 bath, 2500sq feet.  All it needs is a coat of paint on the inside walls, and new appliances.  Complete finished basement as well.  Only $140,000!!!  We LOVE it.      Here is the problem.  It's RIGHT on a graveyard!  Literally, the properties boarder one another.  There is a row of trees that were planted between the house and the cemetary so that if you're looking out the window you can't really see the cemetary, however it's literally 50 feet out of the back yard, maybe less.      Honestly, we're kind of creeped out by it.  However, the house is SUCH a great deal!  Would you buy it, or no?  It is BY FAR the best deal we've seen after looking for MONTHS.  Suck it up and live there for 5-8 years, or would you not even touch it?      Thanks! :)
20090307175442AAOc6mT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would this make you feel uncomfortable? WIll he ever let it go?	So yesterday I texted my crush. He's not that great with people. He answered me five minutes later saying "Sorry, I was in the shower..."   Then I said "Tell me before next time, I'd love to join you."   I don't think he got that it was a joke.   Today when I saw him we were talking and then he said "why would you do that" while we were discussing the conversation. I had said it was a joke before he said that.   How long before he forgets/lets it go?   And would that make you feel awkward?   He's been really awkward since.   He's a 16 year old male. I'm a 14 year old girl. He's a junior. I'm a freshman.

A few years ago i visited Europe and felt right at home in Scotland and Austria. I would really like to move to either of those places someday. But my family doesn't seem to want me to move away. My sister seems to be the most against me wanting to move, she says that she wants our kids to grow up together but if i move to Europe that wouldn't be able to happen. I feel really torn, I know I am really young and don't have to make the decision now but I want to have some idea of what I am going to do when I grow up.

20090307175236AAHGjBJ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	This is a serious problem so please help me with it if you can...?	Well first I'm 16 years old   and basically I have a terrible relationship with my family.   My dad is an arrogant little rat and my brother is a woman beater.   Everyday I'll come home and an argument will start between either me & my dad or me & my brother and it will end with one of them punching me to the ground until I can't breathe.   Only 30 minutes ago did my brother give me a "fat lip" and strangled me until I nearly fainted. I couldn't breathe or control him.   Obviously because I am a girl, I am not as strong as either of them.   Its becoming unbearable and I think if i went to the police they would just ignore it and say something like "well its just a family tiff" but I can't take anymore of the hitting.   My mother lives on the other side of the city   and I was thinking about moving in with her even though I don't like where she lives and she doesn't earn much.      please help me.   this has lead me to a state of depression and self hatred.

Yesterday at school, i saw her writing something. I had seriously just given her a note, and i thought she was writing me one back, so i looked to see what she was writing and it turned out to be her journal. When I was about to look away, i saw her writing my name. I kept reading the page and this is what it said:    "I wish Halle (which is me) would just leave me alone. She's so weird and she always follows me around. Everytime we hang out, she goes through my phone and my purse, and all my stuff. When i walk next to her, I think she touches me on purpose. She's probably a lesbian."      Okay, heres the problem with this. WE WERE BEST FRIENDS! we hung out seriously every weekend, because SHE would ask ME. SHE would always ask ME to sit by her at lunch. I wasnt going through her stuff, and im definately NOT a lesbian. I was seriously staring at her with my mouth hanging open, i was so shocked.   She looked up at me right after that so i couldn't read anymore. I don't think she knows I saw it, but i'm not sure. I have absolutely NO IDEA what to do, and im really scared to talk to her. WHAT DO I DO?????

I am 14 and my parents had me when they were 18. Ever since I was 5, my dad has had full/primary custody of me. He has me Monday-Friday, and my mom has me on the weekends.      My dad is so hard on me. He makes sure I do all my homework as soon as I get home, he makes me go to bed by at least 10pm every night, and he will rarely let me eat junk food.      My mom lets me eat whatever I want, stay up until whatever time, and doesn't care about homework etc...

Maybe not tragic, but pretty down. Here's the story.      I'm a teen. 15. You're gonna start to think now that "Ohmygod, she's just a teenager, why does she feel bad? She's not as worldly and experienced as the rest of us!" That doesn't mean I couldn't use some advice. So help me Y!A.      Recently, I became really good friends with another guy (boy? man? I'm a teenager, so let's stick with guy). We're in the same close knit group of friends, I really met him this year. We would chat for hours on aim, and then text all day. This went on for MONTHS. Whenever he was going to invite people to go somewhere, I was the first. When something happened, I knew. Call me crazy, but I really liked him...and I thought that all this time...I mean...it had to mean something....right?      Yeah. I guess not.      Yesterday I just found he got into a relationship with another girl. And I wish i could say I didn't see it coming. WE never changed, it's just I noticed them also talking online alot, but never in person. This talking alot started like 4 days before they started dating. And now they're dating. For real. And I mean I've only seen smaller pictures of her, but she actually is pretty, and I guess that makes me feel like he was debating thinking about me, but another good girl came along AND she was very pretty, and I mean, thats all you could want? Better jump on that offer?       What.      About.      Me?      Maybe I'm overreacting. I know alot of you are gonna leave some hate  answers, but please take me seriously. As you can see, I'm pretty literate, and mature...well...I try.       Sorry for the wall of text!

My husband's NEVER fed her, NEVER changed her, NEVER played with her, and he's only held her like 4 times, just because I was busy or something...He's at the gym a lot (10+hours a day) because he's a boxer, he doesn't have a job(doesn't have to work, my father is very wealthy), he even picks fights with my friend's BF's....and he hangs out with his friends a lot more than he should.. It makes me feel kind of bad that he doesn't have much interest in his daughter, (or me for that matter)... I really don't want my daughter to have a bad relationship with her father growing up.. Does anyone know how I could get my husband to care about his daughter? I think he's pretty immature for an 18 year old (I'm 6 years older than him)...I don't know if I should kick him out or try to work things out...   Thanks for your input!

20090307181735AAtuzyu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please please, please help me! IDK what i should do!!!! Easy points!?	okay, so long story short, i liked this one guy during summer, ( webecame really good friends,), and i later found out that he liked me too... We never went out because unfortunately we also liked some other girl and he liked her more than me..... Then i asked him to Turnabout.. (girls ask guys dance) and he said no.. Now, we are still really good friends, and i still really like him.... Lately hes been acting like he liked me again.. He walks me home, keeps inviting me over by his house to do homework, ( we always end up talking and joking around the majority of the time, and teases me constantly...      so i was walking today and i was at the corner of his block, and his sisters saw me and waved me over... and he was packing his suitcase.. ) to visit his sister in madison and he came out and played basketball with me,and his sister and he stomped on my foot.. ( i was wearing flip flops) and he felt so bad that he stepped on me.. He was like.. Im so sorry! That must have hurt because i put all my force down.... and then he put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me too him... Then he went in, and finished packing, and then came back out to say goodbye... he kept waving goodbye to me, and kept smiling when i was around him,..... He pokes me a lot,.... Hes always really close to me.... He stopped walking with the girl he liked, that i knew about, and instead stands by me while i talk to my friend who takes the same bus as him   im so confused...   Does he like me, or does he just want to be friends?????????
20090307175702AAWSvNX	Family & Relationships;Family	Help me write an apology note to my mommy?	My mom and I never really go a long to well. I mean, our relationship was always very intense. The love was very intense, but so was the arguing and the screaming and the throwing things (on both our parts). She wound up kicking me out but we started talking again. We'd go out to dinner and have awesome conversations and remember what it was like when we weren't fighting.       I wanted to write her a note apologizing for the way I acted before she left (she just moved to Arizona, I saw her one last time and in the middle of our visit, we had kind of a fight.)      How would I apologize for that? I want to write something that'd make her really happy. I have a HUGE problem showing affection (like, huge) and even though I do love her, I have a hard time saying it. In this email I'm writing her, I want to say something really nice that would make her feel really good.      Any ideas? This is what I've got so far:      Mom, I wanted to apologize for the way I treated you, both last time I saw you and throughout our entire lives. All the things I've ever said made me sad, I can't believe I'd talk to my mother and my hero like that. It's unfair and you didn't deserve any of it. I want you to know that I love you, though, and always will even if I have a problem showing it.

My life; a binding of Dark and Loneliness put in a room;   with no light; no radiance except that of the moon;      It was then that i saw your gorgeous face;   Your beauty took me to a whole new place;      Your luminous beauty stole the heart of my eyes;   but then i saw your smile and i felt my heart rise,      Taking my breath away, your smile shine like that of the sun,   From then on, i could tell for me, that you were the only one,      There is so much about you that opens my eyes and strengthens my heart,   Much more things than that i have already told you; but there's the start,      I was shocked by your choice, and I'm sure my face turned red,   You did choose me, everything i wanted to say, was finally said.

20090307181700AARdcJV	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why are people so judgmental of young marriages?	My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half, and are going to be getting engaged pretty soon.  I’m 20 years old and he’s 19, but we’re both in college and I’ll be graduating with a Bachelor’s Degree in December.  We are very much in love, we’re best friends, and we’re on the same page as far as what we want in life.  We’ve had extremely thorough conversations about finances, kids, where we’ll live, and how we’ll raise our children—we’ve discussed every aspect of being married, and we know what we want. My family loves him like he was their own, and vice-versa.  We’ve also mutually decided to wait a couple of years to actually get married, that way he can be out of college and I can get my Master’s Degree. We’re honestly not like many young couples.        However, many of the people that I work with are extremely skeptical of me getting engaged at 20.  They don’t care that I’m not getting married till I’m 22.  It just really upsets me because they don’t know anything about mine and my boyfriend’s relationship; they’re merely passing judgment on the fact that I’m 20.  I’m an adult for crying out loud. However, they think that I am completely idiotic for wanting to be married young.  Everyone feels as if I should wait until my mid-late twenties to tie the knot.        I know I just ranted a little bit, but can someone please tell me why people are so judgmental of young marriages?  I can understand it if I wasn’t an adult and had no idea what I want in my life, but I do.  Also, does anyone have advice for dealing with these people?        Thank you so much for reading all of this.  =)

20090227093203AAt54hR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I rebuild our relationship after being mostly to blame for it turning into crap?	Last night my boyfriend and I almost broke up. It scares me so so much because honestly I feel like he's the one for me. I've never felt this way for anyone ever. The problem is that I as a person am f u c k e d up. He's done so much for me and recently he's been asking me to do favors for him that are out of my comfort zone and because of that I turned into a *****. I didn't realize until after that I was being very selfish and stupid. I've also said that i'd brake up with him just to hurt him like three different times and last night we almost broke up. Since I was treating him like that he started treating me like crap so we had this vicious cycle going on of hurting each other by trying to put the blame on one another. Today is the last day I seem him and he goes to Iraq and Afghanistann very soon. I want to make it up to him but i'm not sure how. I want to leave here with him being happy that i'm his girl friend not happy that i'm gone. Anyways I'd really appreciate any advice or tips or ideas about how to rebuild a relationship that needs saving. Also if you have any ideas about something I could do today that would show that I really love him I'd really be thankful for your help. I was thinking about getting a sorry card maybe give him a message after word and give him plenty of kisses and attention . Honestly I have no idea what else to do. I really am so I know I have to work on my faults somehow or I'll lose the one guy I truely always want to be with.

20090307183325AAQ4oSu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend i think hates me?	yea i was  chilling today then my gf was texting and calling me all day  so i sort of was avoiding her by turning off my phone i tried texting and calling her does she hate me?
20090227093135AAhcJyi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this happening?	Well me and Girlfriend now ex I believe were doing real great we were in deep love we were doing great! We did break up once before but it was my fault and because of my insecurities. But we got back together and we were doing real great and in true love I believe. We would talk during the night over the cell phone text during the day and sometimes we would have our fights and arguments but we would recover. I do doubt her sometimes and I tell her and keep asking her and sometimes she tells me it hurts her. But the reason I do is because she always hold things from me like she sometimes don't want to tell me stuff. But she always told me to never let her go and to never cheat on her. Then came the point where she started to be turned on and stuff she started sending me pictures naked ones and ones with underclothes. Offcourse I had to send her my pictures of me naked too and I did. (This was all just recently) Ok so this last Monday we went over to her house and at first she wanted to have sex then she was a little skeptical. She was saying that she loves me but that she want to wait till we are older and I wanted to have sex but I told her if she didn't then its ok. She then went to the bathroom and got some nice and sexy langeriae and I ended up in my boxers then she took my you know what and touched and wanted to have intercourse. So we did we had sex and I took her virginity away and she took mine as well. After we had sex she kept telling me to never let her go and I promised her that I will never let her go. She also told me that she only had sex with me because she loved me and because she "knows" I am the "one". But after we had sex the next day was our aniversarie our one year then things started going down hill. Me knowing her I knew there was something wrong I asked her and she said she had a dream that she don't want to tell me about and that she is drifting away from me. So yesterday we spoke and she told me her mind wants to stay but her heart wants her to go. She say she don't love anyone and she say she is not moving on now. But she also say that she cant be with me she say her mind loves me but her heart doesn't. Then the next thing I know she tells me she do love me and she will never stop loving me so at this point I am confused. But she tells me to leave and that she is sorry but she cant be with me but if she love me how can that be? She said its not health related and its not her family she said she didn't used me for sex because I got upset and said things I shouldn't have. Then what could be wrong if she loved me the whole time truly and deeply that she didn't want me to let go ever then what went wrong in a matter of days of having sex? She say she will never stop loving me one second the next she say her mind love me but her heart doesn't then she say she do love me and never will stop loving me! I am so broken right now confused and my heart is destroyed. I threw up yesterday because me being the guy I didn't leave her especially after sex I meant my words but she do leave me out of nowhere! Can someone please explain to me what might be going on? I understand if some people say it might be a guy but she told me she dont love anyone else so I doubt itll be a guy unless she is lying to me. But I did try a million and one times to ask her why she want to leave because I deserve to know she say she know I deserve to know but that she wont tell me. I asked her if I should wait she said to leave now I am texting her she is not texting me back. She did say yesterday she want her space but I don't get her its confusing, Oh and she is Christian and she go to church every sunday, Now anyone any ideas?
20090307184423AAVvgpH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is having a baby the quickest way to kill a marriage/relationship?	Every time I'm on here, I see tons of questions that all have the same theme: "everything was fine before I got pregnant" or "he changed after the baby was born." Do babies ever make things better? Why bother to have kids if they're just going to screw up your relationship?      (For the record, I'm 40 and childfree. Just curious to see others' points of view on this topic.)

20090307182104AAoXQta	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone give me advice? Please?	I have known this guy (23) for over a month through my friend. At first, I didnt really notice him too much and kissed his roomate (while drunk) I found out the roomate is a manslut so I just forgot about him and started talking to the other guy. My friend told me that he is looking for a girlfriend and actually respects women. I also heard that while he is outgoing, he is a little shy when it comes to asking girls out and he is used to girls chasing him. I have gone over to their house a lot and everytime, I would make small talk with the guy but when we were both drinking, we would get into deep conversations and find out about each other. Last night, we finally kissed and he wanted to have sex but I said "Im not that kind of girl" and he said "I know youre not but you cant blame a guy for trying because you're sexy as hell" I told him I liked him and asked how he felt about me and he said that I was "very cool" I said that I dont have sex without a commitment and asked him if he wanted to go slow and try dating and he said "I dont know, we'll see." I told him about kissing his roomate and a few weeks ago I saw him kissing his friend while drunk but I know that is all they did and I told him "I guess we are even now." He was a gentleman and walked me home. He asked for my number and I said call me tomorrow and he said "I just might do that" but still hasnt called and he is going clubbing with the boys tonight. I dont know how he feels about me. I mean obviously he is willing to have sex with me but does he want to date me? Should I be worried?
20090307183052AAC4VAq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is anyone else 21 years old and still feel like a teenager?	I feel like a baby...well, not quite, but I don't see myself having sexual relations with anyone yet.       I can't imagine having to deal with all of the responsibilities of having a baby. To me, sex isn't worth it. I have plenty of time to do that when I am 30 years or older...      Does anyone else feel this way?

20090307182648AAvalUc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can't live without him/her...what does that mean?	Y!A members always say that is the reason they married, or fell in love.       But of course, you can live w/o him/her. You did before you met. This is romantic, but not reality.      What is IT that makes you know THIS is the person for me? Please don't say, "You just know it/feel it." I've known it and felt it before and that wasn't the case, so that doesn't seem to be the correct answer.      I'm really struggling with this. How much of love is in your head vs. in your heart?       What makes you WANT to compromise & sacrifice for someone else? What makes you feel connected to your partner? What makes you WANT to accept them warts and all?
20090307184748AASwaLD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he just shy.. but interested?	My friend and I work on a project together. Since the beginning of the term, I've always caught him looking/gazing at me in the group and sometimes he says things which shows he observes me in class. He's pretty nice and is always able to hold long periods of eye contact and smiles alot when at it.      He's alright in a group but can become very quiet when alone with me. Once I saw him in a corridor and he waved without speaking. Recently, he sent me a poem saying it was part of his resolution and wanted me to read it.       The next day, he stood beside me for awhile before slowly walking away without speaking. However, hes quite vocal in class and talkative.. Is he.. interested? And school term is ending in 4 weeks.. should i do anything or take it slow.?

20090227092443AAOKFvO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does this girl keep brushing shoulders with me?	I REALLY like this girl in the year below me (Im 17 shes 16)    We constantly lock eyes and smile with each other and she always gives me an AMAZING smile! :D    She always comes over to talk to me / stand next to me       She keeps brushing her shoulder against mine...? :S Like i would say something funny and she would laugh and bump/brush/rub shoulders with me (But casually not obviously). She also kept doing it at a party this last weekend, as we were dancing.       What does it mean??? Does she like me or what? or am i looking into it too much........... :S
20090307183512AATuJzy	Family & Relationships;Friends	Tell me what you would do in this situation please?	Ok..this may not seem like a big deal to anyone else but me, but i brought my prom dress in january because i'm bringing on vacation with me this month. Anyway, my best friend came over to see it and she said "so i don;t buy the same one." I showed her and she loved it and said how pretty it was, she just got her dress and it is the EXACT same style with the same sparkles on it and the same pin on it and the color pattern is the same but mine is in pink and hers is in navy blue. I said to her "wow it looks like my dress!!" She started saying how i should buy another one so no one thinks we look the same and blah blah blah...what should i do? Say? Should i buy a new dress?
20090227093650AAudLmQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friends versus family?	What does a friend mean to you? What does family mean to you?  What is the difference between the two ( i'm not talking about legally but emotionally)? Which one would you say is more important and why?  How can a friend become family?  If both your friends and family are in danger and you could only choose to save one, which one would you save?
20090227092736AAtqmYf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What is the farthest...?	that you would feel comfortable driving from your reception to your hotel room for the night?      We have found a really nice place to get married, but it isn't very close to anything.  We would like to block out some rooms at a hotel for out of town guests, but I don't want them to have to drive extremely far to get to their hotel.  We may have to choose another place for our wedding/reception because of this.      So, how far would you drive late at night - after a reception, dancing, possibly drinking, and with a full belly -  to get to a hotel for the night?  How far would be too far?
20090227093752AAuvH3z	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm always running late?	I'm always late for everything? I have three kids and I know that may contribute to my problem. But its just getting really bad! I'm getting in trouble with my kids school. They are threatening me and I get worried when I start to work it will affect me. My last job everyday I was 15 minutes late! I really don't like being this way. I know I'm getting this from my mom. But I can't end this vicious cycle? I've tried schedules, didn't work. I can't get to bed early cause I'm stuck on y!a!! I'm stuck on my online classes. IDK I just feel like a useless wife, mother, and caretaker. sniff sniff...My house is always a mess, I'm falling behind on everything it seems like? I'm weak, tired, and stressed out. I can never get out and begin my day until around 3pm when I know I should be out of my house by 9 or 10am ugh...Can I see what others do to keep on top of the house, homeworks (I have 4 sets), bills, and other house wife stuff. Men too jump in and tell me what should I have my husband do cause I know he can contribute more then what he does.

20090307184012AA3VfI4	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am sick of this injustice..is there any solution?	I am in university, in a 4 year course. I am now in my final year, and without a single friend. But that's not all..i'm not neutral with everyone like i had hoped. I am ostracized and treated in the worst possible manner. And my classes are not mixed with people from the other courses. Just mine. No matter how nice I be to people, they continue to be bitter to me. I've tried by best and there's no way out in my view. If I am nice to someone (e.g. giving them a lift), they will act nice to be at that time, and then just backstab me, spread rumors about me (because people in my batch are lame enough to find it fun to talk/listen to stuff about me). If it is groupwork, I won't be informed of private meetings (e.g. at 1 o'clock, we will all go to the computer lab and do the 2nd part of our task), and then they will come and ask me why i didn't ask them when the task is. When I ask them, they will say that there is nothing planned yet. When I tell them to inform me if there is, they will say that there probably won't be anything but just come along to the comp lab and u may find us. As you see, they don't even have basic respect for me. Suppose they see me talking to people in other courses, and if they end up meeting them as well, they will say things like "why are you talking to him, nobody likes him, stay away from him".   If I sit next to anyone from my class, that person will get up and go to the opposite end of the room, and everyone will start smiling. When I am alone, the lecturer may ask me "why are you alone, why don't you cooperate with the others". I am fed up with all this.   As for my social life...you can imagine. Absolutely none. They don't invite me anywhere.   I asked a few 'almost neutral' people in my class what the problem is. They just said that nobody likes me. I asked them why, then they just told me to ask someone else because they are not supposed to say anything. I asked for names on who are the ones who are trying to destroy my name constantly, then they say that they can't say anyone's name.   What should I do???? And please...counselling is not a solution. It won't solve this problem. The problem here is ostracizm, and I want to know if anyone has any suggestions to beat it.

20090227092220AAu83ye	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS, I need your perspective and insight. Please help!?	Ok, well i met this girl 2 weeks ago at a club. we danced for a long time and even made out. at the nights end i asked for her number and she gave it to me. i called her 2 days later and talked to her for around 20 minutes. then i asked her if she would like to go out for a couple of drinks and get to know each other more. we did that and she said she had a good time. i called her again this past monday and talked to her for a bit. i again asked her out. i asked her if she would like to go out again and mentioned what we could do. so today is the 2nd "date." so my question is does she consider this a date or just hanging out with me. i never officially said the word date to her, but that doesnt mean it isnt right? with the brief history that me and her do have, does it come off as im in the friend category or no? do you think she considers it a date?

20090307183328AAVRZKE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys perspective, please?	I've been crushing on this guy on the XC/Track team basically all year, but I never really see him, so I don't get the chance to talk with him. Just the other day, I saw him, and said "Oh, hey".   Then this full-blown 5 minute conversation starts, beginning with my name, then Biology, then track. When I go to leave a few minutes before the bell rang for lunch to be over (because my friend was ready to leave), he says, "Oh, you're leaving? Bye." He sounded somewhat disappointed, because we had some sort of connection.      Sadie Hawkins is on the 14th, and my whole family is encouraging me to ask him. I really want to, but I also want to be friends first and not have an awkward date.   If I am to ask him, would he agree? Based on our conversation?

20090227094544AA3XCd5	Family & Relationships;Family	Entire family is mad at me that I choose to no longer speak to my mom, but I feel I am right! What do I do?	My mom is someone you just have to know in person to understand how she is... basically, VERY controlling, overbearing, HAS to be right, her way or NO way type of person. She and I are always off and on with fights, not speaking for weeks or months. This time, I feel she has crossed the line and I wish to not speak to her anymore.      My fiance and I have been engaged for 7 months, going to wed in September. We want a pretty nice wedding, sort of elegant...but my mom has her own vision and fights as to where the wedding should be caused us not to speak (we wanted a banquet hall, she wanted us to do it in someone's small backyard or a barn at an orchard). She was so mad that we turned down her suggestions that she said we were being selfish and could do it ALL on our own without her help. So we are spending a LOT of our own money to do this wedding. Everything is pretty much done, scheduled, picked out, purchased. Yet to this day she is still trying to convince me to cancel everything & do it in my aunt's backyard. And she absolutely HATES my color choices (pool blue & chocolate brown). She says the blue is too Spring/Summerish and she is REFUSING to buy her daughter's (my sister's) bridesmaids dress in that color..says if I want Pool blue, I'll have to buy the bridesmaid dress for my sister.      She is disabled with Rheumatoid Arthritis and my grandma, aunts, sister, step-dad think that I'M putting too much stress on her by trying to do my wedding my way and turning down her ideas..even though I do it in a very polite, simple way. She says I don't want her to be my mom, I hate her, etc. and gets soo upset/emotional and everyone says I need to "stop whatever I'm doing" because it's going to kill her.      It is so frustrating for me. I'm trying to plan a wedding...the best day of my life, and have my whole family mad at ME because I'm not taking into consideration my mom's ideas that are FAR from what my fiance and I want in our wedding that WE are paying for?      To top it off, she sent me an e-mail yesterday saying that she knows I will have a 2nd wedding because one day I will wake up and realize that my husband is a LAZY, SPINELESS MAN who will never change and I will never bee fulfilled. That hurt me so bad... to know that deep down she is unsupportive of who I want to marry. (by the way, she lives 2 houses down from me & says he is lazy because he isn't outside shoveling as soon as snow starts falling and doesn't mow the lawn several times a week to make it perfect like she thinks it should be done.)      I have had it with her making me feel guilty and upset and turning the family against me & making them believe that I start fights or puposely try to make my mom upset. Nobody cares about my side or takes my side or can even put themselves in my shoes. I feel so alone in my family becuase of it..they buy into my mom's exaggerated, dramatic stories! Everytime we don't talk for weeks, I feel SUCH a weight lifted off of my shoulders.. I am so stress-free, carefree, calm, NORMAL! The second she comes back in my life and we start talking again, I get stomach problems..migraines... anxiety... I can just feel my blood pressure rising and the stress taking over me because of the RIDICULOUS things she gets absolutely enraged about!! (The fact that I wanted to keep my wedding gown at my house instead of my grandma's house in the months before the wedding.. what the heck!? Who cares!!)      My family is very upset that I made the decision to keep her out of my life..she will still be invited to the wedding & such and I'll still see her at family functions... but I do not wish to talk to her and I am accepting of that... there are plenty of people in this world estranged from a family member and if my life is more peaceful and happy without her in it... then that is how I want it to be. This is a person who, when my fiance and I bought our too-expensive house that she CONVINCED us to buy because she promised to give us $100/month toward the mortgage payment just to have us living so close to her.... we decided to take down wallpaper in a room and she thought it was RIDICULOUS for us to waste our time & we needed to paint over it instead...so she said "Well, find someone else to pay $100/month because I want nothing more to do with this house!" and then my whole family practically hated me for that until we started talking again.      Sorry this is so long...I just want you to have all the information before making a decision. What would YOU do? Does anyone else have this kind of relationship with their mom?

There is still girl I like and we share a mutual friend. Our mutual friend said that she is interested in hooking up with some other guy. I really want to get her to like me. We might be going to dinner together some night in the next week.      One time there was another girl i was interested in and we met for dinner with some friends but she didn't call or text me to set up another meeting. I'm the one that asked her for the first friend-dinner.      So, I like the new girl even more than anyone else. She has a real nice body, people tell me she is a real nice person, and she has a very sweet voice. How can I seem interesting so she will want to hang 1-1 dinner dates and things? How can i stand out and show her that I'd be good for her? Can you help me with telling me how to make a good impression?

20090307182104AAChpGj	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does everyone keep saying that Katharine McPhee's "My Destiny" is too romantic for dedicating to a sister?	Can't I dedicate it to her?!? Jeez! Hey, that's how I feel, people! Can't I dedicate that to her?!? I feel like it was MY DESTINY to be her twin brother and she my twin sister!   It's the song that expresses how I feel towards her! And besides, when I heard the line, "how different life turned out to be," I thought how different everything would've been had we not grown up together; had we not known each other; had she not been by my side all these years. I can't imagine!   She was destined to be my twin sister, and I her twin brother!   Can I not dedicate that song to her?!?   DOESN'T anyone GODDAMN UNDERSTAND my GODDAMN EXPLANATION?!?   I FEEL LIKE it's MY DESTINY to be her twin brother, and she my twin sister!!! IT'S NOT LIKE I'm COMMITTING INCEST WITH HER BY DEDICATING THAT SONG TO HER!!! GOOD GRIEF!!!   GODDAMMIT!!!   Hey, it all comes down to how we interpret it! What may be weird for you may not be weird for me! But it doesn't mean it's inappropriate to dedicate to my sister! Hey, that's how I FELL!!!

20090307184217AAqDEZa	Family & Relationships;Friends	Same sex friend called me his soul mate... what does it mean?	My friend is going through a rough patch. He lost his job, his girlfriend broke up with him, and his family won' t see him. He's all by himself right now and only has a few friends to count on.      I've done a lot of things to help him out of this situation and he's been very grateful about it. He said was lonely, depressed and with low self esteem before he met me, which is why he was on drugs for a while.   He also said I helped him get better and called me his soul mate and his guiding light, and that he's never allowed any other guy to get this close to him.      We communicate well, we enjoy each others' company, we confide in each other so we basically hang out and talk every day. We like girls but we've met a few at bars and chat them up even exchanging phone numbers, but we end up coming back to each other and leaving the place together.       I just want to know what he meant when he said all these things. I know he's still hurt about his ex and that he doesn't like gay people, but could he be developing feelings for me?

YES 43    He is sexy, smart, intelligent, caring and just lovely. I have known him practicly all my life, uup to recently we seem to be looking at each other in a different light. We always talk about so many things when i go down to see him, and he takes me to beaches sometimes in the summer. these are the things that he says that make me think hhmmmmmm...   -your jailbaite, and teases me with the name!   -he says i'm a very attractive girl, and the thing is i look exactly like all his exes.got the whole megan fox thing going on, black hair, blue eyes, and a tan. but his girlfriend is short, not that pretty, and has stripy trashy hair, and is 41,uuurgh! andd with kids hahaar, which he is totally running away from!and that leads me on to   - he tells me she's not the one, and that he would never fully commit to her   - and just makes me literally feel as though when we're talking i am the only girl in the world, and when he looks, he wants to strip my clothes off! loool   so all in all, i really dont know. should i wait until i am abit older, like 16/17 and then pursue it. i mean we live in flats, so he is literally a door down the corridor   but i just know it sounds so so so typical of a young girl, but everyone says i look 18, and believe me, i feel 18   .   AND all i want really is great company a couple times a week, and great sex, is that too much to ask. i wouldnt want a proper relationship, just a thing. i think it would suit both of us tbh   Please help, and answer back   i just want to know the publics opinion   and i have the feeling its not going to be too good   but come on girls, give me abit of hope:)   thanks guys         D   x

20090307182609AAryA9W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! I think i'm in love?!?	I've been talking to my friend guy (We met 1st semester in college) and I think I'm starting to feel different around him (When we talk it feels normal...there's no blush but whenever I talk I look him in the eye and often moved my gaze, when there's a silence I always try to say anything and start the conversation again). He had a girlfriend but broke up with her because she cheated. He's 25 and I'm 19. We text each other and tease one another. He's a gentlemen but I've never had a boyfriend and I'm scared to give my heart to another person because I don't want to get hurt and I know he doesn't want to get hurt either. I considered myself naive when it comes to Boyfriend/ girlfriend things. I don't know how he feels towards me. I was just wondering...can a guy really love you even though your naive/innocent? Is that some sort of characteristic feature that a guy looks for in a woman? Does naive means stupid?       The last time we talk in person he sent me a txt message saying that he "enjoyed our talk". We still text each other. I mean can he really fall in love with me? and if he does...what are the possibilities..I mean a 25 year-old guy wants to settle down. Don't they? What exactly can he see in me that will make him love me? I am so confused!  HELP!

Anyway i always thought he was cute, but around christmas we met at a party and he showed an interest in me. We have been out together, text quite a lot and he is always buying me stuff an gave me a really sweet valentines card.      The thing is. He's still living with his girlfriend (he told me they had spit and she has nowhere else to go) He is known to be quite a player, but he always acts really sweet around me, compliments, not trying to pressure me into doing anything. Also my family dont know about this as he is a few years older than me. I'm 15 he's 20.       I havent seen him in 2 weeks as he lives quite far away, and  has just said he cant meet up with me on saturday, but wants to do sunday instead.        I really want to see him, so should I re arrange my plans? Or would this encourage him to mess me around more often? sorry this is so long.. but i have no one else to ask (my friends dont like him)

20090227092526AAlxg5X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get rid of my boyfriend's jealous ex-girlfriend?	Yes, before you read on, we are teens. Please don't give me stuff saying we are too young to know about love or jealousy. I really, really think my boyfriend and I have something special, and so does he. We went out for 8 and a half months form 6th to seventh grade, broke up, and have been going out for several months again. Everybody says we're meant to be and its real love. Even our teachers! Anyway, in the beginning of the year, he went out with this (we are 13) younger girl (everyone in our grade level calls her Monkey-Face because she looks like one - not being immature! - so I'm going to call her that here). They went out for about...two weeks at the most? Anyway, she's really scary. I bet she can take some of my friends who are girls down. Ever since he and I have been going out, she won't leave him alone! She's talking **** about me, cussing me out, and talking behind my back. (Like I care.) She even got him Valentine gifts. I don't know whether she has a little crush on him or something, but she has taken it too far. She gets her friends to talk to him everyday, she sends him way too many love notes, and is practically obsessed with him! He doesn't like her anymore, and our friends have tried to shoo her away, but nothing helps. Please, I know our age might seem stupid to people, but this is serious to me. Any help?

20090227093027AA0iB7k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Any ideas on how to do something romantic for my husband.?	ok i am only 16 i just got married jan 15th. and he is 19 and very sweet respectful and everything like that... he is not like most guys where all they want is sex and stuff like that... so i was thinking that i wanted to just do something nice and sweet for him..and i was going to wirte a letter of how much i love him and tell him  my feelings and stuff like that and put it in a little envelope with his name on it and also buy some real rose petals and candles and i was going to get up in the morning and while he was aslepp sprinkle rose petals on the bed and on the floor in a little trail to the letter and when he would get to the letter there would be like little candels all around it along with his breakfast that i would cook. so what my real question is ...is that a good thing for a guy..like would he appreciate it or like it at all do you think?? or does anyone have any other options that might be better. besides the usual movie and dinner thing. cause i barely get to spend time with him i work 50hours a week and go to school. so yeah i want to do something special...any ideas   ??? is this good??

20090227093241AA9WEvs	Family & Relationships;Family	How Am I Communicating Incorrectly? How can I communicate better?	I need to know if there is a better way to communicate with my daughter, because she always comes to me for help and gets upset when I try to help her.  She is a teen, graduated from high school at 16 and attending my college as a freshman.  I praise her often in front of all I know & have killed myself to be attentive to all her activities and her sibs activities.      Please be aware, I have been raising my kids (I have 4) alone for 13 years and trying to keep us together in our only home and finish my electrical engineering degree with no help from family or friends.  So every second of time is very valuable to me.  I need to know if there is a better way to approach her requests for help so that my time is not wasted by the drama caused by misunderstandings and miscommunication?      Also this was deleted earlier, so I am trying to fit within community standards as I really do need opinions from any willing to give.. I think I was too wordy?  Not sure, but thanks for your patience.      If you could maybe could i have a ride home.

20090227094545AAJXIPN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does it feel none of my friends understand me?	Ok I am a college junior, independent, smart young woman who wants to be successful in life. I have friends who already have kids or about to have kids by men who basically aren't ****.  I'm single and I am fine with that, there's no drama in my life and I don't have to worry about someone else dragging me down with them.  My friends are always telling me I should get a dude who makes me happy and that I should have kids but I already know me and my friends have different goals in life.  They constantly tell me the reason I don't have a man is because I'm too independent.  Let's think realistically here, why would I want a man who doesn't have anything and all he does is drink and smoke like alot of my friends "baby daddy's" are.  If that's all I need to make me happy I am fine being by myself.  I just sometimes feel like I'm the only mature one around them because I think I should make sure I do what I want to do before I think about seattling down and I don't need a man who is not got goal-oriented like myself.  I don't want to seattle with anyone like alot of my friends are but if what I'm saying is the "mature" thing to say why can't my friends see that?

20090227094801AAMzke7	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Good relationship, bad sex:  should I marry him even though i'm lookin at the clock?	I have been with my significant other for a year as of yesterday, and we started having sex 6 months ago. Prior to having sex, we were seriously contemplating marriage and engagement, because we love each other very much, have made very large time money and emotional investments in this relationship, and are best friends who enjoy each other's company. But the actual sex act itself...leaves MUCH to be desired. His penis is decent size, 6inches long, about two inches wide, so i don't think its that, i just don't feel ANYTHING during sex. and when i DO start feeling something, he'll orgasm, or start hittin me so hard he bumps my cervix and i quickly lose interest. we've tried talking it out, different positions, different types of lube, Kegel exercises in case it was me not him,  HE always orgasms, but he usually has to give me oral sex, or i pleasure myself, to orgasm. I've only had one partner previous to him ,who had a very large penis (8.5 inches long, almost 3in whide) who would bring me to multiple orgasms with speed and regularity.      Now, I've sought advice from women of different ages and experience.  Older women tell me i'm being a child:  that marriages lose their sex drive after a few years anyways, so I should not turn down a good man who loves me and will be a good provider over sex cause he fills my mental emotional and friendship needs perfectly . My own aunt said just buy a vibrator and suck it up. Younger women, however, tell me that the marriage will eventually dissolve because bad sex leads to boredom and infidelity, and being a "provider" includes providing the wife a satisfying sex life. I almost wish i'd never had sex before him cause i wouldn't have a reference point of good sex lol, and i really do love him very much and can see us being happy in every other way EXCEPT the bedroom. What would YOU do?

20090307183430AA87nXe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Visas & marrying in Ohio?	My Fiance and i are both 16, and deeply, truly in love. I know that sounds hard to believe but it is the most real thing i have ever felt in my whole life. He proposed and i have said yes now we wish to marry in his home state of Ohio. I am not an American citizen or Resident, I am from New Zealand and hold NZ and british citizenship.    I have afew questions,   1)If my parents don't agree, but they both live in New Zealand and neither will be at the ceremony, do I have to get consent from them to marry, or do i need not worry about that?   2)Which visa would i need to apply for to get into the U.S  & is it really a big hassle if you put down that you are intending to marry whilst you are there?   3)Do i need to go about applying for citizenship before hand, or am i automatically granted citizenship when we marry?   This is rather alot for me to think about, so i have almost definitely forgotten a few of the questions i had in my head, is there anything else i should know?      Cheers.   PS; please don't leave answers saying that i am too young, or that this is not real love, because love can happen to anyone at anytime.

20090307184013AAtKUNO	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do you have to register somewhere for your bridal shower?	My fiance and I are getting married in October, and the bridal/wedding shower will be in August. I'm having a very hard time coming up with things we need to register for. We are both in our 30's and have accumulated many of the things we need. If we don't have it, we go out and buy it. Sure, I could put together a small registry I suppose, but it would have about 10 things on it. I don't want to register for things for the sake of registering. I guess my question is, on the invitation can we include a small registry and perhaps putting a note on there about cash for our honeymoon? We are planning on going to Hawaii and would really appreciate any help we can get towards that. I have thought about registering for our honeymoon on one of those sites, but with the shape the economy is in, I am afraid to do that! What if the company/site went belly side up?

20090307184222AA0lg5l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do women REALLY want to be "sex-buddies"?	Me and my friend had a conversation about this earlier.    She stated that there are many women out there over the age of 27 so "just want to be sex buddies," with no strings attached and that there are many women who just want sex from a man. A regular, call you when I need sex, don't need you until then type of situation.    I argued that most women after the age of 27 are looking for "more" but just settle to be a sex buddy. I think that women who are more accepting of those conditions are either married, already in a realtionship, or been married. But most women want to be more with a man, but hope the situation changes over time.    What do you think?
20090307184303AAsanR8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Stuck between a rock and a hard place?	I have been married for almost 5 years.  I have been unhappy for over two, and the in the past 6 months I have told my husband I want to separate.  (I have made a counseling appointment for the both of us.  But honestly, I just want to end the marriage.)  I go to college full time, and work part time.  I bring home maybe $400 a month.... The car (and its ridiculous monthly payment) and our debt is in my name.  I have no family within 2000 miles, and hardly friends.  I cannot afford to live on my own.  I hate putting my financial burden on someone else.  I really feel horrible.     My husband says I am depressed, and I do agree.  I am not where I want to be at 25, and would rather start from scratch than mend problems.  I believe anti depression meds really only mask the problem.  We dont have any kids (thank god).  I am just really stuck.       Thank you in advance for your advice and kind words. As you can tell my the scattering of my sentences, I am really an emotional rollercoaster... :(

Whenever we go to the mall or something, she's usually wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt, with her hair tied back, wearing no makeup. Me, on the other hand, usually does my hair nice, my makeup nice, and tries to make myself look presentable. The thing is, whenever we're together ALL the guys that see her (even strangers) either stare at her or check her out or hit on her or say hi. Also, I'm 5' 1" (i know, im short) and shes like 5' 8". ah it just makes me so mad, i dont know what to do. also, she gets asked out like every day by a different guy each time, and i have never even had a real boyfriend! i reallly hate looking like the little ten year old, when strangers think i am and think shes 27. we're both 15. AH. can someone give me some advice on... anything?   thanks      ------------    also, she thinks im ugly... but i think im prettier than her.. i dont get it.    shes also kind of easy, like she shows cleavage and wears mini micro skirts and stuff.   im just confused, any advice?

20090307191853AAsoUi5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Talk to the guy I like for me...?	So I'm kind of into this one guy, except we live far away. We've been emailing ever since we met, and he asked me how I liked Texas (where I go to school). I know, I know, be yourself, but anyone have any witty/semi-flirty (but not overly so) replies that I could use to keep the conversation going?      Thanks!
20090307194052AAddaj9	Family & Relationships;Family	If I want to talk to my mom, I always have to come to her first. What do I do?	If I want to do something with her, if I want to talk to her, whatever- I have to come to her. It is rare for her to suggest we go out to the mall or something. It's always ME who has to ask. I'm sick of being the only one making the effort. I'm 14, she's 40. (sorry Ma) She works part-time, so she has all the time in the world for me. I'm not trying to be selfish, but she should show some effort! I occasionally talk to her about the flaws in our relationship. She's great for like 2 weeks, then she's back to her old self. We are alike and we are different. Personality wise, I'm more like my father. My parents are married though. So I don't know what to do, because she is a very defensive person.

Here is what happened:    - I came home from college    - I met up with one of my only friends in town    - She is young, beautiful and married   - Her husband was out of town on business   - We went out to celebrate my bday and way too drunk, haha   - We messed around, but did not...   - Now that I am sober, I regret it sooo much      What would you do? I have decided that it is best not to talk to her anymore :(
20090307185324AAhRJ4h	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband and I are arguing and disagreeing more than usual?	My father passed away three weeks ago and I'm totally numb.  I feel like everything is on me:  the house, work, my child, his grandkids, everything.  We watch his grandkids 4 nights a week.  That means in the morning I have to wake up two of them and get them ready for school and take them to school with me.  I am numb.  I can't hardly function and he's arguing with the children as well.  Tonight I just yelled at him for something stupid.  He's mad.  I'm mad.  I don't know how much more I can take.  Any advice?

20090307191845AAxQM7E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me?	Whenever I'm sitting there in science class, I'll turn around and he's looking at me. Every time. Same with in P.E., and when I pass him in the hallways. But I don't know if that proves he actually likes me...   Ok, so, on Wednesday, I was hanging out with him after-school for about an hour. The conversation was pretty good. He was really nice and everything. He called me a genius because I knew where some website got it's name from (weird reason to say I'm a genius, but whatever). Also, when his friends were leaving and they asked if he was leaving, he kept saying "I don't know, it's cold outside". They left, but eventually someone else took him away from me. I was so sad... :(      Anyway, that's about it. I've talked to him before this, but I just wanted to give you an idea without making this too long. But what do you think? Do you think he likes me or not?      Also, if you think he does, how should I show him that I like him? How should I get him to ask me out?
20090307192542AA3WxvZ	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it wrong to want a break from my parents?	Just some time to break away from them for a little bit. We've been very frustrated with each other lately.   I'm angry with them for past things that they've done to me that are cathing back up with us, and we're either arguing over dumb things or not talking at all.   A week is what I'm asking at most.   I've had a lot on my mind lately, and I'd like to be able to at least be myself without them breathing down my neck.   I don't want them to lash out on me, and I don't want to do so to them either.   I'm 15, and I'd stay with another family member. Personally, I think it might be good in order for all of us to get our thoughts straight again. But they don't want to.   Is this selfish, then? Wrong?
20090307185229AACtnJv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am i wrong to be angry at a drunk friend?	my friend has too much to drink before when we go out and i have to hold her up the 2 mile walk home.      gets aggressive and tells other people to f*** off      when we hang out with guys, is either mean or overly friendly.      people laugh & harass us on the way home          she is a wonderful, sweet girl, but i don't like: defending her public drunkenness, not having a normal night out because me and our other friend carry her home at midnight.      i'm single, i want to meet guy friends but she yells at guys to keep away or either leaves no chance for me to talk because i'm taking care of her and she is aggressively talking and joking with each guy (though she's not single and doesn't mean to flirt)      i have said something to her about it but by the time we go out two weeks later, it is forgotten and she drinks before i go to her house.      she is wonderful otherwise, and i try my best to keep her safe, but i'm getting very annoyed. i don't mean to be selfish but i want to enjoy a night out WITH my friends. not as her babysitter. talking hasn't helped. what can i do? am i wrong to be angry?

She denies absolutely everything when it is so evident. for example the other day she went out with friends and hen came home complettely hungover, but she wont admit anything to my parents, she just yells and abuses them, she even hit my mum the other day!!!    My dad found an empty pack of cigarettes in her bag and instead of apologising, she made up some complete lie and started abusing Dad for going in to her bag. And yes i do hate my sister, litereally, can't wait till she leaves home. She has done much more than this too. i just feel for my parents.

20090307191916AAwUbNG	Family & Relationships;Family	Does he hate my son or is he having issues?	My husband has been in my son's life since he was 16 months old. He used to call my son, "his boy" and told everyone that he was his daddy. My son started calling him daddy and everything was perfect and fine. My son is now 3 years old. My husband came home after 6 months from visiting his family in Mexico. He is now absolutely cruel to my son. He has become physically abusive to my son and I am constantly having to stop him from going overboard with discipline and abusing him. He says horrible things to him and now all the time says, "that's not my son" or "YOUR son." He has openly admitted a few times that he is jealous of my son because he has so many toys (my husband grew up extremely poor; we're talking no shoes on the feet and barely any food). I have talked with him before but I don't really get much out of him. He says he is depressed with his life and all the problems he has when he was in Mexico for 6 months. I know it is not my fault or my son's that he grew up so poor or that he had problems but I just can't figure out why my husband, who truely is a kind and gentle person, has turned into such a monster.

20090307184838AA8mSDq	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Any ladies know of any good online bridal stores?	I was searching online for bridal dresses and came across a gorgeous gown for my friends' wedding which is in May. I placed the order and paid to have it expedited. When I called customer service, they told me the dress will not be until the end of April. I asked if they had a date(i.e April 26th) but this customer rep put me on hold for 5 minutes before she said they did not had a actual date and I was suppose to call back Monday. The site I ordered from was www.therosedress.com which I heard so many good recommendations from. After the experience I had and I don't know when my dress will arrive, does any of you ladies recommend a good online bridal store that would give an exact date.( I did search Davids Bridal but they are limited).My friends wedding is on May 30th and I would hate to leave here on May 28th and fly to Minnesota without a dress to wear.

20090307185120AAxMoV9	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel like an awful friend?	We were best friends for about 5 or 6 years and I feel awful that i ended the friendship.It all started this year when she entered 8th grade (im in 10th). She got this boyfriend who was 15 (she was 13) and still in 8th grade. He was a druggie, alcoholic and always tried to argue with me. We got into a huge argument over her being wit him and in the end she chose him over me. I didn't talk to her for about 2 months but she would still try befriending me again by iming me and stuff. She wouldn't give up and in the end i gave in and we became friends again. A month later we kept getting into arguments because of how rebellious she was. Most of the time i started them because she started carving things into her arm , stealing, taking large amounts of pain relief pills, talking about trying out drugs and it all really upset me, she refused to stop and claimed I was trying to change her, although one time she told her mom about it and told me she had stopped, but really she just wanted me to stop bugging her and continued without me knowing, (i found this out when we were arguing yesterday)i think she cut for attention because she went around flashing her cuts and some of her "Emo" friends claimed it was "Art" and told me not to judge her and to leave her alone. She also always lied to me, and wouldn't be honest with me because she was afraid i'd get mad and disaprove, which is true because half the time I did. (I feel bad about it now). She had lost her virginity to the 15 year old on New Years eve, when we were talking about her and relationships she admit to me that she had dumped her previous bf for the 15 year old because she knew she could lose her virginity faster with the 15 year old. The 15 year old dumped her about a week later after they had sex by being a huge *** to her, never calling her, and telling her to shut up over the phone everytime she laughed or said something. I feel awful about this. I thought she had chose her other friends over me, she said I keep trying to change her and it was annoying her, she was all "at least my other friends accept me for who I am." But the things she did just bugged me so much! I don't know maybe she was right and I'm a bad friend for asking her not to do any of that? I feel awful because I feel as if I did the wrong thing. Another thing is that my friend whose comp she used to log on myspace had went on her myspace becuase she forgot to log off there computer read through some of her messages and she told people i was her only real friend. I felt so awful afterwords that I felt like crying, since I called her a lot of awful things when we stopped being friends. Did I do the wrong thing?
20090307190111AAGzvNW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you quit your job if....?	You are a teacher and your student's parent of the opposite sex, who is married, continues to make sexual innuendos to you and gives you sexual looks.       You notify your supervisor, who tells you not to make a fuss over it, because it's a private school and you need that studen'ts tuition (to pay your salary).      And then, out of the clear blue sky, s/he touches you inappropriately.
20090307185452AApef6G	Family & Relationships;Family	Can you please tell me what to do?	So, I have a brother named Lance. The problem is, well, he has a drug problem and I'm scared of what he is going to do. It's just, well, everytime I try to tell him that the family doesn't talk about him in a bad way anymore, he gets worked up and angry. See, he lives with my father, who lives right down the street where my mom lives. Lance lives with my dad and there's always been multiple problems with the family that I came from. I love my brother Lance and I want him to know that I'm proud that he is trying to get into the Army and fight in the war, but I'm just so scared, and uncertain of what to do. Everytime he comes down, something has to go wrong. He was literally saying that he would rather be dead than have to deal with the way the "family" has treated him. But, he is using liquid meth, something like that. I found out that he shooted up before my brother Dusty and him started to get at it. He told a lot of lies that night, but one thing that really hurt us was when Lance said that Dusty and the rest of the part of the family I live with are emotionally dead to him, except me. And that's what scares me, because he said that my opinion is the only opinion that matters to him anymore. I know that's true because he has always said that. If I try to talk to him about the drug problem that he has, which my brother Dusty knows that is true, then I'm afraid he'll commit suicide. The last time, well, before he graduated two summers ago, I remember him putting a knife on his upper chest, but the car somehow stared to run, so he just drove off. I didn't know what was going on, but I said when he was leaving to "Just go, Lance..." while I was crying and holding onto my bubba Dusty's arm. He said that's why he was about to do it, because he thought I was going to be taught that he was a brother but that he would always do drugs and screw up on things. The gas tank was empty that night, he was poor back then, too. The car wouldn't start, and he was literally going to "give everyone in the family a piece of his heart," but the car just started to run and he drove off in anger. The point is, I know that i'm probably the only one that can get through him, but if he thinks i'm ashamed of him, he might commit suicide. He has the guts too, believe that. He can't afford drug counsuling or anger management, he can barely afford to eat crackers every night. I'm not looking for sympathy, but if you have ANY advice, ANY, PLEASE don't hesitate to answer. Okay, bye...

20090307193230AAbnMsY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marriage getting rough, need advice!?	My husband and I will be celebrating our 1st year anniversary in May.  I love him more than anything and I know that he loves me too, but he will have mixed emotions on our marriage.  When we are having good days he is loving and kind and exactly how we were when we were dating.  But on his bad days he insists that he doesn't want marriage, not that he doesn't love me or wants to marry someone else, just that he doesn't enjoy being married.  He changes his mind on this daily.  One day we will have conversations to improve our marriage and agree to both work on things that bother each other, the next day he will say he doesn't want to be married.  Is this typical for the first few years? I know that there is a lot of adjusting when people are newly married, and the last thing I want is a divorce. I want to work it out and sometimes he does too, what do I need to do or say to convince him that it will take work on both of our parts to make this work?  I want him to realize that marriage is worth all of the hard work, but I don't know how to show him that.  Please help!

20090307194234AAPHVBN	Family & Relationships;Family	I am 13, and my mom is overprotective?	I'm 13, and in high school. My mom wont even let me go to the mall with my friends without parent supervision. After a while, my friends have just stopped asking me to go with them. The problem is, I really like this guy, who I am trying to get to ask me out. If he asks me out, I WANT to be able to go out with him, but I'm afraid my mom won't let me. What should I say to my mom to let me go out, even just with my friends. If I ever go out with him, or even just get asked out by someone else, should I let my mom meet them first so that she knows they are a respectable non-perv person? I need some advice on what to do, because I want to be able to go out with people. ALSO, how should I get my mom to let me wear a bit of makeup to school. I would even just like to be able to wear a skin-coloured eyeshadow, and some mascara, or eyeliner. My mom is VERY protective. THANKS for your help. This is very important to me. Also, should I wait until I get asked out to tell my mom that I want to start dating, or should I talk to her ahead of time. Because if i wait, i could say like "This really nice guy __________ just asked me out on a date today, and I was wondering if I would be able to go out with him"  . K thanks !!  greatly appreciated!! :)
20090307193805AAWe6jU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What are my husband's intentions?	Last year my husband and I had a falling out. We moved so that he could attend a very demanding grad school career. Our relationship fell apart because there was no commmunication. I started to question a lot of his actions because he would get home later and later from school without calling for the entire day. I got to the point to where I was asking him if there was someone else and it only irritated him more.       Come to find out later he said that he did cheat on me and it was out of pure anger towards me. I went through another couple of months with the torture of knowing that he did this to me and was still trying to make it work. He may have still been with this other person too even though he claims he wasn't. I finally couldn't take the coldness he had towards me and moved out. I've been physically apart from him for about 8 months now. A few times he's expressed his anger for me moving out and getting a job, but I did it because early on he had said he didn't want to be with me, and even mentioned the word divorce.       He's been up and down with his feelings towards me. I'm not sure what he's thinking. We have two great kids together and a part of me still thinks he wants us to work, but he can't bring himself to reveal his feelings because he said he's not in the mind set to work on our marriage yet. He wants to graduate this May and wants to do it with no interruptions. Will he be ready to talk about how to resolve our marriage yet? Should I wait since I've waited this long already and is it worth it? What are his intentions? Any constructive advice would be helpful. Thanks
20090307193826AA5nlPq	Family & Relationships;Family	Dad caught me looking at web porn after I left the room.?	I forgot to click off of a porn site. I instead just minimized it. I noticed he looked at it only after I came back into the room, after I saw that the porn website was max along with a new window of what he was looking at. Meaning that while he was checking his e-mail (because it was not computer literate) he was forced to look at the porn website too.      He failed to say anything to me, but I know he knows. I feel really ashamed, and he's kind of dismissive of what's happened, tacitly though.

20090307201132AAA6lmT	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friendship problem? Is it worth it?	One of my best friend who has always been there in the past but since about new years she hasn't. She started seeing a much older guy. Going to bars underage with her older sisters ID. When I had a family member pass away she came to the funeral dressed like a hooker. Talked all about this guy and what he buys her. Not really caring I was crying my eyes out. Many things have happened in my life over the last month (things I just can't handle thinks any more) I have texted her many times asking her to call when she's done with class I NEED to talk. She has never called.    Little things like when I told her the police were at my house because some one tried to break in. She said "O" and that was all. When I said I was having problems with my parents she just said "that sux"       She does nothing but drinks and parties I'm told. When I told her how much trouble she can get bars in for using that ID and being underage she said O well. (in messed up letters because she was drunk)  Pretty much I'm sick of always having to defend her when people make comments about her being a "sl*t"  I really am upset she doesn't seem to care. But I should I call her and tell her I'm mad or just cut her out of my life since she doesn't seem to care much any ways?
20090307213947AA67oCt	Family & Relationships;Friends	My cousin has been doing a lot of bad stuff,, how do i help her?	my cousin is 2 years older than me and she lives north of me in a different state. well she tells me all the bad stuff they all do up there and i tell her that's bad but she says that's normal up where she lives but not where i live. and she says she's not even considered that bad up there. well her bestfriend has had sex with like 10 guys and has done them like 5 times each. my cousin is always drunk when we talk on the phone and i know she drinks sometimes. she tells me how she wants to have sex and all this bad stuff and she says she grinds on every guy on the dance floor and there's crazy parties like every week up there. she told me how there's about 15 pregnant girls at her school and mostly everyone comes to school wasted and hungover.   how do i help her? i know her mom (my aunt) wouldnt approve of that and everytime when i tell her that's wrong she just laughs and says "it's different up here than it is down there."   my parents read my text messages and saw some things she said to me and they said that i really need to talk to her.   what should i say to her?   it sounds really messed up in wisconsin.

20090307155302AA2EMJF	Family & Relationships;Family	Why are my parents being unreasonable?	I am 13 years old. My parents have been acting so weird lately. Like for example tonight I wanted to go roller skating with my friends and they said which friends so I told them and they didn't know one of them so they were like "idk we'll see" Then they were saying how they don't want me to go to the skating place because it is in a ghetto neighborhood.      I am very responsible and I never do anything wrong at all. Why are they suddenly being so weird about this? And sometimes when I am at home bored they and I tell them that I am bored they get angry like WELL YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE PLANS but how am I supposed to if I can't go anywhere new or with new friends???

And in the hallway it seems that he takes my route if he sees me :/   And he tryed to push me in a garbage can once :D   When I tell a joke or say something funny, he laughs, even if it wasn't supposed to be funny.   I heard from his friend he was gonna ask me out, but I am waitingg!   Haha.   Ohh and in math I catch him looking at me :D   We stand by each other in the lunch line.   He blushes when I make fun of him around his friends :D (it is so cute!)   He tells my brother to call me names like "dork" and (sorry this isn't politically correct-->) "retard" on XBox Live.   I'm so much shorter than him and he uses that to his advantage, so he ppretty much pushes me to get me somewhere else :D   Sorry I wrote so much :P      ~Animal_Lover
20090307213940AAyiPmE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	In heated argument when extremely hurtful thigs are said?	My husband and I got in to an argument a while ago, and I am 4 months pregnant.  He said quite a bit to me, but to summarize it up, he said that I am an unfit mother who cant take care of my other kids because they do not reside with me, that I am fat and no one is going to want me, and that I will not be able to do **** on my own unless its laying on my back.  I am currently in my 2nd yr. of college, and I do not work because panic attacks took over can caused me to quit.  He knows of everything that bothers me but whenever we argue he throws these things in my face.  Is this true love, or do I need to keep my distance from him?  Because I know of some real hurtful f'd up things I could say but I refrain bcuz I care about his feelings!

20090307145125AAaSpqV	Family & Relationships;Family	How should I let go if its so hard to do it?	There is a staff here where im at. And I really got close to him. I have been at job corps for two years and Im leaving this month. I barely started talking to him for like six months. Now that my time is almost done I barely started calling him dad. Because I never had one I can look up too. Now that im going I don't want to be away from him. It hurts me so much. I barely called him dad. What I want from him that I never got. I want him to hold me in his arms and let me cry on him. I want him to love me like a daughter. He lets me call him dad and he tries to be there for me when he can. I have his number but everytime I call he is busy. I gave him mine because there is something really important I have to tell him. I haven't told me counselor off center how i feel about leaving. I told her I want to stay here in town and that I want to live here. But i have only two choices either go back home which is not a good Idea because. I was abused by my mom and sister and I don't want to go back to that. The other choice is I have to go where she is going to send me I don't know what the place is called. I don't know how to let go of this man he means so much to me. I feel like if I keep in touch with him and call him. It wont be enough for me. Now that im leaving in about two or three weeks. I don't want to talk to him anymore just to get over him. But that is going to hurt me so much. Im also close to my counselor and I don't want to see anyone else because I wont talk to that other person no matter what. I don't want to have to retell my past to someone else I don't know. I also want to stop talking to my counselor because Im close to her. And now that im leaving I want to pull away and not talk to anyone else but her. This is so painful to me I don't know what to do. Im also leaving a really good friend of mine. I hate this now I just want to go back home and lay in bed depressed. I haven't been taking my pills either the ones that put me to sleep and the ones for my depression and anxiety. They don't even work if I take them. Well my sleeping pills work but not the ones for depression and anxiety. Every since this has been going on. My depression and anxiety have gotten worse. I barely stopped taking my Meds yesterday. I told my counselor about them not working she told me she will let the doctor know. But now I don't want to get anymore help. I just want to go lay in my bed and die. I have been thinking of dieing. For that longest time not because of this man. But because I don't know what I want to do in life and I don't know what I want.

20090307212338AA2ABYp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	One year dating anniversary - Needing help with my gift?	My boyfriend and mine's one year dating anniversary is coming up. When I first thought of my idea for a gift, I worked quite hard on it, but because I have been busy, I have been procrastinating lately. Our anniversary is in seven days.      My original idea was to write 365 reasons why I love him. I am almost done, I only have 73 left, which I am sure will not be too hard to finish, if I can get into the mood of writing again. The second part was to fold 365 origami paper hearts in red, pink, and white; writing the reasons on them and putting them in a heart printed Chinese take-out box that I bought from a craft store. I have not even folded a hundred of them yet.      My dilemma is this. We are in a long distance relationship. We literally live on opposite corners of the continent; him in Vancouver, Bc and me in Florida. I sent him a box of goodies for Valentine's Day. The post office told me 7-10 days, but it took much much longer since they do not get post on Saturdays. (How stupid is that?). There is no way my package will get there in time. So should I:      A. Finish the 365 reasons first, then the origami hearts. Give the reasons to him on our anniversary over messenger / phone and ship the hearts, not worrying if they are late.      B. Finish both and go with my original plan, shipping the reasons written on the hearts. Apologize to him for being late.      I am unsure what to do.         Also, he has expressed to me a couple times a few weeks ago that he did not know what to give me for our anniversary. In which I responded that he does not have to get me any thing. I seriously meant it, it was not one of those moments where a woman says she wants something, and then gets upset on their anniversary. I truely do not want anything. I already feel bad that he spent $800 on a lap top for me for Christmas, as well as the only thing I am doing for our anniversary is this little thing.      So should I do something more than what I planned?

I never really have since I can remember and she almost disgusts me actually. I know that sounds horrible but it seems like the only one who ISN'T bothered by her is my dad. My mom cannot stand her either but she puts up with her... and my grandma thinks we all like her.      Well anyways, my fiance is on his way home from Afghanistan and we're getting married in the courthouse in April when he comes to Texas. Thing is, it's the army so we do not know yet what day we're getting married on since the military is so unpredictable. I'd LIKE to get married on April 10th. Well my dad keeps asking me to pick a date so my "grandma can fly down and watch you get married" and I don't have the heart to tell him i do NOT want her there. She's so embarassing and my fiances parents are very mature and have good manners and all that. My grandma however, is white trash to the extreme, plus other annoying things, like she's very rude. My mom doesn't want her there either, and we don't know how to tell him.      He just told me "She has to come, she's dying and if she can't come it will break her heart"   She's not dying, she's only like 68 or so and in perfect health. There are other grandchildren! What do I do??

The guy said he could not help me and it was just a trial to ask question if you wanted to buy it.      So i was like alright. And asked questions, because I was going to tell my mom to buy it. I drew one thing on the board not knowing he would see it. And then he got made and started calling me a dumb ***, and then on the board he wrote you are stupid. You do not deserve to live.

20090307202318AAuJRCK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do you think about this?	Ok, here is the story...I was going out with a guy named Daniel over the summer (relationship lasted 2-3 months), until all of a sudden broke up with me. Found out by him that he was dating a girl that he worked with at his work. They broke up, and Daniel and I got back together. We have been together for almost 4 months. So here is what made me upset... I went to get a rabbit from this girl that couldnt take care of the rabbit, and it turned out to a person I went to school with. So we started talking and this and that. And I mentioned a guys named Daniel, and she said Daniel, yea my friend is dating him. I was like WHAT?! I told her that I was dating him for almost 4 months. So he has been dating this girl for 1-2 weeks without telling me or ending the relationship.So I called him and was like wtf are you dating this girl, and he said yea, like he didnt care yea. So I pretty much told him how I felt, and sent a couple of texts saying how I felt. Then he called me 3 times, 2 times i rejected the call, the 3rd call he left a message. He was pretty pissed off, b/c of what I texted him (Text message sent: Perhaps I should let that Tori girl whats going on so she doesnt get hurt like I did, and doesnt have to put up with your bull s***.) I never told tori, but just letting him know its not fair for her to go out with him if she doesnt know anything that is going on.I ended the relationship, and sent a text to him saying dont text or call me again, thankx, and bye. There is more to this story but this is the basic part of the story.What would you have done if someone went behind your back and cheated, and let a few girls know that your single when you really werent? And what do you think about what happend? Im turning 19 in June, and he is turning 20 in June. Whenever I ask him if he is dating a girl (I had a gut feeling), he would raise his voice and say NO! Tori is also a girl that uses a guy and then leaves them.

My boyfriend and I have been together for the past 6 months and it feels as if spending time and seeing each other is becoming a routine. I understand things aren't going to be like they were the first couple of weeks we were dating, but is this really what long term relationships turn into? We're in college and so the majority of our time goes to studying or sleeping and money is kind of tight for both of us right now. To him everything seems fine and dandy and we're seeing each other everyday but to me it feels like the quality time we used to spend with each other is non existent- I get to his place, we have friends over, party, go to sleep, and I leave in the morning while he's still snoring in bed. We hardly ever fight, we've had only two "discussions" since we've been together and this is our third. I feel that I'm not seeing the best of him and he's not seeing the best of me, for example I'm an early riser and sitting, waiting for him to get up is boring and kind of irritates me and when he's groggy just getting up isn't the best time for him. Since he's a night owl I'm dead tired at night and I always fall asleep in the middle of movies so the time we spend together doesn't really count since I'm passed out. I feel bored and like we need something to rekindle our relationship- I can't even get intimate with him because it's like "here we go again.." I really don't know what to do, this is my first relationship and I don't think its going to end any time soon nor do I want it to. Does anyone have any suggestions about how to make the time you spend with your boyfriend/girlfriend truly quality time again? What do you suggest we can do to liven it up? Any similar experiences?   Thank you for taking the time to write your suggestions :)

20090307214633AAS0sqH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This really hot girl is hitting on me, but I'm not single. What should I do?	I've been dating this girl for three months now. And the past two weeks, some hot girl that I've seen around campus several times that's never talked to me starts talking and flirting with me. I don't know what to do. She is smoking hot (no offense but my current girlfriend is a zero compared to this one). Should I cheat behind her back, dump her, or forget about the current girl who is flirting with me? If it's the last option, how do I tell her to stop flirting with me, or do I let it continue, just to keep the option open in case my current relationship doesn't work?

20090307155904AARhOaT	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Help, shy girl and I really like her (add on).?	Help, shy girl and I really like her..?   Well, I have been talking to this girl for about 2 weeks now. On MSN/Face book/Text messages etc, and we get on reasonably well we are both quite flirty.       Well, I met up with her Friday night and she was with her friends at a GIG.. She was very "shy" around me when she saw me/came over and said "Hi" and everything.      I'm a little shy myself, and I get a little bit "gutty and quite" when her friends are around her etc.      It seems like I can only really talk to her 1on1 for now, and she is like she wants to be around her friends and talk.      So literally we Said "hi" on friday, had a little talk about things. Hugged her once, said goodnight.      He friends told me that she talks about me "alot" at school/college. And that she likes me, but she is very shy around me....      But when we talk on msn/facebook/txt she seems fine.      She even said that she misses talking to me, and was sorry for leaving early on Friday night.      So we text's the morning after, the usual how are you etc.. Asking questions out of randomness. She said she was in the city today, and that after she wanted to meet up with me for a "walk/stroll" and talk.      She knows she is shy around me, and I get a little shy because she is shy... You see the problem?      Well, I met up with her at around 7 today up the town Centre and I met her friends, I said "hi" how you doing, what you been up too :)?, get anything nice.. You know being the casual type of person.. Her friends are talkative, once spoken too. So I tried to spark up a conversation with the "shy girl" I like and she just seems to feel awkward around me, and im finding it really tough to say something/interact with her so I can gain her trust..            So one of her friends had to go, so we walked her back to the taxi drop off point until she went.      Then we decided to goto the Park, so we walked to the park, gently talking/confronting her about what to talk about. Once we got to the park, we went to the swings.. Sat down and started to talk about things.      So there is us talking about random things like, what is the most cringest thing I have done etc... blah blah blah, garbage talking nonsence.. Me looking like a complete *** of myself as I usually do - haha! and the shy girl literally said that she wanted me to "sell it to her".        But I am not sure how or what to do, as I am kind of in a akward position.. That she is shy, doesn't look/talk to me that much but knows im there... This is doing my head in.. :(      Her other friend, had to use the phone so she wondered off leaving us 2 on the swings, awkward I know!      But I really want to get to know this girl and become more than a friend to her.      So I said, like " how you doing, bought anything nice today? " Her replying blankly and dull like "yeah, I got this and that". Being shy.      After a bit of talking, I asked her.. How Do I get to know you more, how can I gain your trust so we can talk... She didn't really know, and kept being shy...      Anyway, her friend came back and she needed to go home. So we walked back to the "shy girls(who i like)" house and we went in to be picked up / talk.      After her friend went, it was just me and her.. In literally, utter silence.      *So I kind of gestered if she wanted to come sit with me, being kind and caring whilst patting the seat* and she was like "I'm ok, I can sit here* ( She was on the laptop sorting her younger brothers laptop out (MSN).          So I said " Would you like to go upstairs, and talk a bit" because her brother was in the room at the time. And she was like " You have seen what my room is like, a compelte mess " Let's talk out in the kitchen.      So we walked to the kitchen and I said something like, " You are quite shy I can see, would you like a hug " and she literally walked into my arms and had a little hug..      So I said I should be moving on home as it is getting late, so I got my stuff and said goodbye, and hugged her again to say good-bye. She was still being shy..      I wasn't quite sure at the time, and I said " Could I do something else" and she was like " no" I was like ok (Smiled) and said talk to you later ill let you know when I'm home.      So I started to walk home, and she text me saying "what did you want to do" I replied " I wanted to peck you on the cheek x", no response... When I got home I told her I was home, logged onto msn and said      Me: Hey, did you get my text's   Her: yup   Me : Alright   Me: Sorry if I, confronted you a bit.. I don't want you to feel iffy around me x I thank you for letting me come out tonight :).. x   Her: loooooooooooool   Me: ??   Her: Just funny   Me:Ok, im heading for the shower.. talk to you later x   Her: i wont be on so bye   Me: :] bye bye x   Her: Bye      *after shower*      Text:   Me: You okay?   NO RESPONSE   Me: Night, talk to you later x   NO RESPONSE      (IM STUCK HERE NOW WRITING IT OUT, now I feel sick and tired)      Have I blown it? I really like this shy girl, and I don't want her to be

20090307205413AAmHG6X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think anything is going on with him?	So, he is my best guy friend. He recently broke up with his girlfriend and told me, about three weeks ago, how much he really, truly likes me and how he wants something to happen between us, but wants to take it very slowly and ease into it. Just about one week ago, we were driving around and holding hands, and I asked him if he still liked me that way, and he said "Of course, I wouldn't be holding your hand if I didn't like you." But just this week, he's been acting a little different. He hasn't been hugging me quite as tightly, or calling me as often. This morning, he texted me telling me he wouldn't be able to see me today because he was on a day trip with another girl, who is his ex's best friend. Now, he has many female friends that is not romantically interested in, and he's a good Christian boy and is not a player. I'm just kind of wondering... do you think I'm being paranoid, or do I have reason to think he's not interested in me anymore?

(He's exhausted all of his avenues)  My problem is - every time I turn around, he's at my throat about the smallest of things.  I realize it's hard now, but is this a reason to be so mean?  He tells me that the job that I hold is really not a job at all & that I need to go out & find a real job.  Most of the time I don't say anything at all, but I have bad feelings growing & I don't want to explode so to speak one day.     What can I do to ease the tension?

20090307215159AAs6DyP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	I bought this girl a rose for valentines day in school. She said "thanks" and asked me why I gave her one with a smile on her face. She asked me online and I told her I liked her and thought she was the prettiest girl in school. She didn't believe me and said "lol" a few times throughout the online conversation because she thought I thought she was mean, so I gave her proof that two of my friends know that I like her. After math class, which is the only class I have her, she walked out the classroom first and I was behind, she looked back which she rarely does. My friend told me she asked him privately after math class if i liked her to confirm probably, and my friend said yes. So does she like me or at least is interested? Does asking her out (I'm gonna say hanging out) increase my chances of going out with her than asking online?

At school Jacob will look over at me then when i see him looking at me he blushes and looks away.On valentines day i told Jacob i liked him over msn (with some encouragement from his best friend) he said ok.   Well his best friends little brother told my little sister ...Jacob hated me i was heartbroken i was later on talking to him on msn and asked him why he'd tell his friends brother he hated me he said he would never say something like that and asked why i would think he actually did. Jacob is really sweet and calls and texts me ALOT.      so here are my questions      1. Does Jacob like me?   2. Why would his friends little brother say that?   3. Should i give up on jacob?

20090307212958AAS2UQt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband only wants sex once a week, wife wants more!?	I don't know what to do anymore. I've told him that if he's unsatisfied, he can let me know of ways to change that. It seems like he's happier to watch porn and play by himself, than to ever approach me with sexual intent. I've asked him if there's a problem, I told him flat out that I need more sex. We used to have sex every single day, usually multiple times a day, and it was AMAZING. I can understand not having it multiple times a day, or even every single day, but.. once a week? He's used the, "I have a headache" line more than I have! HELP! I thought women were the ones who were supposed to stop desiring sex after marriage, what gives? I've approached him and flirted, I've stated it point blank, I've climbed on top of him in the middle of the night and tried to entice him, but he couldn't be more uninterested. I'm sure that I haven't let myself go, so I don't think that is it. Why isn't he willing to communicate with me? I'm so tired of getting my hopes up and being rejected! This hurts!      And please, don't put evil thoughts like, "Oh, he's cheating" into my head. I trust my husband, and I don't need any suspicions to make this situation any worse than it already is.
20090307155234AAPtZkQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Question about my friends?	I don't like talking about my friends on here, even though they don't go on yahoo answers...      I have a bunch of friends but 2 of them are like my best friends.      It is getting annoying how they always think they need to lose weight. They are both very skinny!  It's one more than the other, though. But both of them sya they ate so much they need to lose weight and stuff like that, even though they aren't fat! They think they are overweight, but if they are, its only by a few pounds.      I tlel them thye are skinny and they don't listen. I tell them they shouldn't worry about it cause thye are only in seventh grade and they have plenty of time to worry about it later and if they aren't fat theres no need to worry. But they dont listen. Especially one of them. One isnt relaly obsessed or anything but it still bugs me, and the other is kind of obsessed.      Thye are also both upset cause we did a unit with cardiovascular excersize in phys ed and they found out their heart rates weren't in the target zone, and mine was. I am just annoyed. What cna I tell them to make them stop? Or sotp worrying about their weights because they are skinny and actually pretty?      Sorry this was so long. Oh and by the way one of them stresses a lot more than the other, so its mostly just a problem with one person. Sometims they have little arguments about it though.

20090307202835AAywOI4	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm worried about my girlfriend...she doesn't want to be left alone with my friends...?	Okay, I am seventeen. Let me just start off by describing my girlfriend's personality. She's quiet, sweet, and a preppy girl (lol). But she has a great personality, and its one of the things I love about her. Physically, she's quite small. She's about five feet tall and weighs under 95 pounds (I'm not sure of how much exactly.)       So I introduced her to my friends a couple of weeks back, but ever since we've been around them as of late, she's become really clingy and doesn't want me to leave her alone with them. Now, when I'm there, I never notice them picking on her or teasing her, but that's only when I'm there. She's shy, but I've never seen her this shy. From where I see it, it seems like something was said or something was done that she's uncomfortable with. I feel like its my fault for not protecting her.  First of all, how can I ask her in a sensitive way? Second, should I feel guilty?

20090307220900AAXTCZ2	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What is with Lose and Loose on here?	I'm not sure what happened circa 2005 to cause 80% of the English-speaking world to suddenly forget the difference between loose and lose, loosing and losing. I never noticed this error before then. Suddenly it's everywhere. Even professionally edited newspapers and magazines and Internet articles are starting to make the mistake.      What puzzles me most about this trend is that "loose" is such a common, useful word. If we absolutely must have to have a widespread misspelling of lose, at least let it be something like luse. That way we won't lose loose. (There, I've loosed luse on the world, in the hope that it will stop us from losing loosing. For extra credit, please diagram that sentence.)      I'm curious about pronunciation. Are there people who see a phrase such as "loose change" and hear in their heads the pronunciation for "lose change"?      I fear we nitpickers are fighting a “loosing” battle here.

20090307214057AANoWvO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there anything left to do?	I dated the same guy from when i was 14-18. I went away to college and we decided that in order for us to grow we needed to end this dead-end relationship. I suggested it first and he agreed but then he started dating someone a week after i started school. I was hurt and for a lot of the semester i spent hours crying in my dorm. I met this guy who living in my building and he was the perfect shoulder to cry on. When he knew I was upset he would tell me to come to him dorm and I use to lay next to him on his bed and just fall asleep. He never tried anything he was a perfect friend. When I came home from thanksgiving I met up with the old boyfriend and realized breaking up was the best thing to do. So when I got back to school I realized I was starting to fall for my new "friend." I went to his dorm and i saw him filling out applications to transfer to a school about 4 hours away. He mentioned something but I didn't take it seriously. He kept sending me songs in different languages that were basically about say anything or ask me to stay. But i couldn't do it. I didn't want him to change his life for me. But I miss him so bad. We talk on aim all the time. I've been getting drunk every weekend and making out with random guys. I just want him. Is there anything I can do, or did I miss out?

Also we don't live together and he has no job i have been going crazy helping him look for a job and i go out of my way to help him when ever he asks and when he doesn't ask. And I am helping him fix his papers, he was not born here. No matter how bad he treated me when we were not together i have never stopped helping him. I do not understand him. Help Please            One little detail that i forgot to mention is that he dated a girl 3 years younger him and she has a baby. And he treated her great and she treated him like crap. And he did not mind that she had a baby.So he says he loves me and that the only problem is the baby that i am having. Why was that not a problem with the other girl? and why with me ?      Okay he has told me before to give him a divorce but i think he is acting really immature. Because after he says no that he loves and that he just can not control his anger sometimes.       And i should mention that we are very young were only 19 years old about to be 20. But we have been together since junior high school and he has cheated on me 4 times... but it was before we had out son or got married.
20090307215638AAQRrKE	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother is impossible!!! She hates my Husband, and I talk reason with her - Help me!!!!!?	Hi,      PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I NEED HELP - THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR READING ALL OF THIS.   Let me give a brief summary of my mom's history (please bare with me).      My parents got divorced two years ago. My Dad moved on with an other woman, and they recently had a new child. My Mom didn't move on. She has no friends - except for this male man who she has been seeing for the last seven years. My opinion is that he is using her for sexual things, and for money (she gives him money). Her family is not on good terms with her. Her sister hasn't spoken to her for three years. Her brother scammed her for money. Her parents don't speak to her anymore. My Mother doesn't work - she stays home EVERYDAY. She looks after our four cats. She use to be on medication - Prosaic, and she's off them completely. She's too envious of me, my life, my friends, and my Husband because she doesn't have any of that. We use to be very close at one point - since she got off Prosaic, I can't connect with her anymore because she has terrible mood swings, and I can't communicate with her.      Now, here's the story.      My Husband, and I are moving in together next year at some point. We did take advantage because we use to come home late, and he use to sleep over often. On Thursday, my mother got fed-up, and she exploded.  She was extremely rude, disrespectful, not understanding, and her behavior was way out of line. I understand what we did was wrong, but you can still be nice, and be respectful.      Now, my Mother hates my Husband. She feels that he is just like her family members which terribly hurts me because I love him with all my heart. My Husband is not ready to talk to her because he feels disrespected, and he feels that he can't talk to her because she constantly explodes, and she's not understanding. Until he apologizes, my mom said, he's not welcome into my condo which hurts me.       I don't know what to do - my mom is too envious of my life style, and my Husband. She's too envious of me - she's not treating me well or my Husband because she's using her own problem against my relationship with him. I'M SO CONFUSED, AND I NEED A SOLUTION!!! PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR OPINON, AND I NEED HELP - PLEASE HELP ME BECAUSE THIS IS HURTING ME SO BADLY!!

20090307203055AAxuK1A	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband came home with a love bite on his neck and then passed out on the bed?	The night I arrived home from the hospital with my first son, my husband went to a party.  He returned early hours of the morning with a love bite on his neck and passed out on the bed.  He vehemently denied anything happened despite the overwhelming evidence.  That was 6 years ago and I have been unable to get passed it.  I've asked him several times to leave and have told him that I have since been unfaithful to him but he refuses to go.  What should I do?

20090307155506AAJAvNH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help with being a stepmom?	First of all I don't want to come across as jealous and hateful or a wicked stepmom.    I have a wonderful stepson and husband but my life is a living hell because of my husband's ex girlfriend, who is the mother of their child. She harasses me constantly:calling me names, harasses me about my weight (I'm not fat but a little bigger than her) she has sent me harassing messages on myspace, she stalks me such as driving past our house and cyber stalking me.(I had to block her off myspace and facebook and other websites) and teaches stepson to call me names. I've never spoken a word to this woman.  I can get over the name calling and harassment but I've been pulling away from my stepson now. I cannot get close to him without being reminded of his nasty mother. Sometimes it's hard for me to be around my stepson and I'll go to my friend's or sister's house on weekends to get away. I am constantly stressed out from all the harassment and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells constantly. I feel like I can't let my guard down and let this boy in my heart completely because I cannot get past how much I resent his mother. Is there any tips or advice anyone can give me to help me out here? I don't want my stepson to feel unloved or unwanted because I don't like his mother. I treat him like he was my own child but sometimes the stress of being a step parent is hard.

20090307195159AAbtHUB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Advice on how to deal with my friend.?	I have a really great friend, whom I have known for a couple of years now. She is about 300lbs, and I have recently lost about 30lbs, and am 150lbs. We always used to go eat together, like fast food or whatever but now I only eat healthfully and she says things like "Well I'm not going to starve myself." or "I'm about to start my diet." Then she goes off and buys a bunch of candy  and chips to eat throughout the whole day. She eats A LOT! Anyway, I need help on how to deal with her being really rude to me about the whole eating right situation. She always gets mad when we are talking, and she is eating, and she thinks im judging her and says "Quit looking at me when I eat, you are making me feel self-concious" I just want to help her because she insists she wants to lose weight but she really doesn't mean it. Any advice on how to at least get her to stop being rude to me about it? Thanks

20090307195344AAIi7Ki	Family & Relationships;Family	///////////////my brother?	My older brother and I have grew apart since our childhood relationship. Sometimes I feel that he just puts up a face to other people and at church. At home, he is nothing like how he presents himself in public and to others. I hate that he is so unhumble and always seeing things from only  his point of view. He has hurt me in the past a lot both mentally and physically to the point where I used to cry myself to sleep every single night. But I’ve learned to be stronger now and to try to forgive him.  I guess the thing that breaks my heart most is that he never thinks before he speaks. I envy brother and sister relationships that my friends have because I know that I will never be like that with my brother. please help..

My boyfriend and I have a great time together, but the one thing I cannot get him to do is take me to the club with him. He feels as though if we go together he doesn't want to feel tied to me all night and thinks that he will end up getting into a fight if another guy says or does anything disrespectful to me. I've tried to assure him that I'm ok if we are not attached at the hip all night (I don't care if he dances with other girls) and I can handle whatever any guy says to me perfectly fine without a fight. Nevertheless, he still does not want to take me. I think it's crazy that we can't ever go out together but I don't know how to make him see that it'll work. HELP!!!

20090307200427AAgL6iP	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I break-up with my fiancee?	We've been together for 5 months, engaged for two weeks, but I feel trapped now.  2 Months ago, I starting feeling like I wanted to get out of this relationship because I felt that the person I was attracted to at first isn't the person I know today.  She has RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis) and I just recently found out the severity off her condition.  I found out she was wearing a wig the first 2.5 months we were together without telling me and was wearing it because of the meds that she takes which cause her hair to fall out.  Also, she isn't recommended to do any exercise because her joints are so bad.  She is 25 and slightly overweight but I wonder if she puts on more weight that she won't be able to burn it off and she can have children but means she has to be off her meds which keep her only slightly healthy, she gets sick often as well already.  When we first got together she said she was a CPA, come to find out, she isn't, she only took some accounting classes and works for her father's company which isn't very big and she hardly works.  Most of her time is spent on the couch and watching her niece and nephew for no money at my apartment which bugs me.        I don't want to be jerk but I'm a good looking successful guy with a lot of opportunity and averagely good with women, should I move on with all these feelings and stay together to get married or call it off?

20090307211401AAXEBoH	Family & Relationships;Weddings	HELP! I need advice. Fiance insists on staying 'friends' with all exes and females he's ever known...?	I'm very close to making a big step and moving in with my soon to be fiance. For a long time it has bothered me that he insists on staying friends with all of his ex girlfriends and all females he's ever dated or known. (He talks to some on holidays and other times, too)      I have access to his facebook (he gave me the password due to my jealousy) and he is constantly adding females as friends. Just a heads up, there is one picture in his album of the two of us together so it's not that he's hiding me. Just today there was a new addition to his friends on facebook. (of course she is young and pretty which tends to be the way it always is -- I'm older than they are by a good 7 yrs) It turns out that this was a 'friend' he met online a year and a half ago and he had never met her but he wants to stay friends with her and claims there's nothing that he is hiding so I should either live with it or move on.      The trouble is, he and I met online as well about 8 yrs ago and he 'kept in touch' with me for many years before we ever got together. I can't help but think he's keeping in touch with all his exes 'just incase' and I feel extremely upset about it. He feels that since I have his password and have access to his account it shows that he's not hiding anything. Yet, he won't tell me where he met this girl he just added as a friend except for 'online'.... (By the way he met her online when he and I were still 'friends' mostly.)      I'm very close to thinking this is the final straw with me but I'm looking for others opinions, too.      Thanks.

20090307211433AAn3Df4	Family & Relationships;Weddings	If my future mother-in-law is not financing our wedding at all, should I have to listen to what she wants?	My father will be the only one paying for the wedding. After looking at venue after venue I decided it would be a lot easier on his wallet if I did the wedding on a Thursday night instead of a Saturday night. I said this to my future Mother-in-Law and she very bluntly told me "Well, nobody's going to come then." This comment made me very angry. She and her family will want to drink, whereas my family doesn't, so she's worried her people won't be able to abuse our open bar because some will have to work the next day. Am I overreacting to her comment? How can I politely tell her that unless she plans on pitching in, that her comments need to be kept to herself?

20090307214638AAbKigN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to get her back, if possible?	My fiancee and I were on vacation with my parents and sister a couple of weeks ago. My sister, fiancee, and self went out drinking. We got separated. I got black-out drunk and can't recall the last 3 hours of the evening. All I know is this...      I got back to the hotel, fiancee was mad I didn't get back earlier. According to her (because I don't remember) we argued, she said she was leaving (going home on a flight asap, like 12 midnight), I got mad, through her on the bed, pulled her hair, slapped her, and when she left I kicked her butt on the way out the door. I got arrested and spent 10 days in jail.      She says have a nice life, don't ever call me again. This is the 4th time I've gotten black-out drunk during our 2 1/2 yr relationship, but the first time I've been violent, the others I was just retarded and wouldn't listen to anyone.      What can I do, if anything, to win her back? Be brutally honest please!

For a class i'm taking, we've been given an assignment where we're given a situation, and we're supposed to decided what legal action should be taken.

The woman he was sleeping with got pregnant and died during childbirth, leaving the baby to the deceased man (she didn't know he'd been killed).

I can't really make this any  shorter, and for those who DO take the time to read this and help me, I will appreciate greatly....      Anways, I'm supposed to go to the eating disorders hospital tomorrow, inpatient. Well, I don't know if I should go because I don't think my dad will let me come back home after I am dischargeed. When I visited my mom back in Christmas, he almost didn't let me fly back home. Now we got into a huge, huge fight last night, and two days is not enough for my dad to forgive me. He has given up on his wife, my brother, his job, his house, and now he wants to give up on me. I really need to go to the hospital, but he's making me not want to go because I fear he will not let me back. Every time I ask if I'm going to come back, he is silent thinking for a long moment, then says "I guess", without looking me in the eyes. And that's what he said last time. Plus he has a tendency to lie just to get his way. Maybe he's only saying he'll let me back so that I'll go and he gets rid of me? Why would any parent ever hesitate to let their child back home in the first place? See, now I'm in a catch 22. If I go, there is a high chance that my dad will not let me come home, and I may have to be put in the long term treatment for 3 months again. And if I stay, my eating disorder will not be cured and I get suicidal. So should I go and risk my whole future?         And I can't go live with my mom, it's a long story, but please don't suggest that.

20090307165115AAdK1k7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I get out of this?	Story: It was a Friday and school had let out early and i went to work to pick up my check. i walked to my nephews house (hes older though) to hand out, so we went to the football game at out school and walked around in an indirect path to his house, along the way we ran into 2 of my friends and one other person that i had never seemed before, he was very quiet and shy, but polite, the guy asked me if i could buy him a cheap set markers  for a school project and said that his parents hated him and didnt give a damn about him so i felt bad and gladly bought him some markers and after i handed it to him he thanked me and one of those 3 guys came along with me and my nephew and stayed at his house that night. the next day when i left my nephews house my other friend came with me and as we were walking up my street we saw our friend that we saw the night before and went to my house for a half hour and when my mom came home we left and as we were walking down the road my mom called me and told me to come back because she was mad at me, so i told them that i would see them later... never saw any of them again that weekend.      Ok, well everything started october of 2008, i heard rumors in school saying that i did graffiti around my neighborhood and i didn'tt think much of it until 2 days later police arrived at my house while i was babysitting my little brother and sister. one of the two cops that were standing on my front porch was a family friend and seemed upset that i had did something, the other had an attitude with me the whole time and was saying that i did it and that i was going to get interrogatedd at the police station a week later. my mom wasn'tt too upset because i told her my story about what i did that weekend. when we got to the police station, the same cop that was harassingg me on my porch suddenly seemed like a gentlemen now that my mom was present. he showed us photos of the graffiti of what i had supposedly done and 2 other graffiti names that were being blamed on 2 of my friends that i had hung out with that weekend. i told the officer that i had only been with then for a matter of minutes to an hour. after being recorded and saying my story we left the police station. the graffiti was being blamed on me and 2 of the friends that me and my nephew ran into that night. 4 months had passed until court but the court messed up and my lawyer was unaware of the trial so my case was discontinued for another month later. But the other 2 people had to stay and get trialed along with another friend of mine that the police did not tell me about, after court my friend called me and told me that everyone got convicted of 8 accounts of graffiti and got fined $450 each, work 50 hours of community service, and 20-60 days in juvy. but when the guy that i hadnt seen that weekend was called to talk to the judge he kept saying that i didnt do anything over and over until the judge got aggravated and kept repeating himself until the guy said that he saw me do something. the other 2 people had confessed to doing the graffiti and one of them said i never did it, the other guy is the guy that told the police that i did it. everyone there had been to court before. this was my first time and hopefully the last time until i go to get my licence. later on the day i texted my nephew to see if he still wanted to be my alliby and he said that he would see what hes doing that day (obviously doesnt want to because he has to go to court for other reasons) so i backed off and figured i didnt need him because they have no proof that could say that i did it (so i thought) they told me they have me on record buying the markers, i didnt care because that didnt mean anything). a day later he texted me asking why he got subpoenad to appear in court and i told him why that probably was and he got really pissed off and he knew that everyone got convicted already and knew my chances were slim and said hes saving his own ***. he was my only alliby other then the guy that got convicted already and he is going to testify against me.    because of him i am going to get conviicted for a crime that i did not commit and now my dad and my stepmom dont belive my story whatsoever, they believed their lieing grandson that had charges for posession of marijuana, grand larceny, and posession of tobacco, over their own son who had never been to court before.   from the beginning i thought this would be nothing, well now it has come to a point where it is the biggest fear in my life right now and lately ive been more depressed than i have before (my school counseler suggested me to several mental health professionals) and i have been contemplating suicide more than ever. my life was great, my parents always believed me, i loved to help when i could and now they dont trust me at all, i quit smoking a month ago and told my mom and she was proud that i was able to admit that i was smoking and now today i put on body spray and she said i put it on to cover

My brother and dad got into a fight and now my brother is blaming it on me because he got kicked out.It was over the outside lights and if they should be turned on at 3pm or not.

20090307180730AAWjx7a	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I be concerned or dismissed it as an accident as she calls it?	I been dating my girlfriend for 1 year and 6 months now but on two occasions she has reacted in such a way enough to really scare me. One time during an argument she twisted my wrist hard that it hurt but claimed to have only joke around (I'm not sure, it looked pretty serious to me) and the next time which was 3 days ago she drove too fast I thought we were going to have an accident or lose our lives. When I asked ''What the hell was that all about, you scared the **** out of me, you crazy'', her response was ''Well you were pissing me off''.
