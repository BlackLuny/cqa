You know that the reason why that soccer is the most popular sport in the world, is because most countries are poor compare to the U.S, and all you need is just a ball to play. But how come it's not popular in Dominican Republic? That country is the poorest nation in the world.

South America is in the FIFA rotation of continents to host the World Cup in 2014, and Brazil is the only country that is planning to bid on the event.  However, FIFA president Sepp Blatter has said that Brazil has no stadiums currently up to World Cup hosting standards, and Brazil's football association isn't the most well-run of organizations historically.  So if Brazil's bid looks to be a poor one for 2014, should U.S. Soccer make plans for a bid for the World Cup?  If so, what venues should be used?  Where would you play the final?

Please find out how it is possible for tickets to college basketball events can be sold out before the time says the event goes on sale, i was going to buy unc tickets and tickets weren't suppose to go on sale untit nov 4 10 am but they event  to almost all games (games to known colleges) were all sold out already and ebay had some even posted to resell for 1000's $. When if you are lucky enough to get a ticket off the unc web site which is the only place you can buy tickets for this event first is maybe 50 $ a ticket. This has to be illegal to sell for that much higher then face value, espically in same state. Also the UNC ticket holder how can they legaly sell out before it even goes on sale isnt that false avertisment too.           keep in mind i was at this website at 8 am and it was sold out, this is sooo wrong in many ways.

20090227141504AAKEhcI	Sports;Basketball	Has Lebron James and Kobe Bryant ever guarded each other?	I hate when they always have great player comparisons but you never hear of them playing against each other. Magic Johnson and Larry Bird was a perfect case of that. I don't think they ever guarded each other because one was a shooting forward and the other a point guard. Only one was Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. Now everyone always wants to know whose better. I say let them both guard each other. I know Lebron James is way bulkier than Kobe Bryant, but that's what the fans need to find out whose the best player in the league right now. Let them face off each other in games. Now, if they had to play against each other throughout the game, then would you be convinced on who's the better basketball player of the two? I'm a Dwayne Wade fan though, I'm voting for Wade as MVP. But I thought I'd ask you Lebron James and Kobe Bryant lovers out there why come they haven't faced off and if they did, if they faced off each other every game would your views change on who's the better NBA star player between the two? I'm neutral on the Kobe and Lebron comparison because I'm a Dwayne Wade fan!  Oh, yeah! To my fellow Dwayne Wade fans don't forget to vote him as NBA MVP this year, I'm making sure that I vote, and you do your part and vote for him too. Dwayne Wade fans around the world. Regardless of position I think they should both face off each other every game...Kobe and Lebron.

Or, I could pic Carolina D off the waivers.      Thanks.  Know it's alot of info, but I need wins BAD.
20081016081450AA3Fhq1	Sports;Fantasy Sports	What to do with my running backs?	I actually have the problem this week of choosing which RB's to play because they all seem like good choices.  It's a flex league, which means I can play three.      Here's who I have:   Frank Gore   Ryan Grant   Chris Johnson   LenDale White   Kevin Faulk      I'm thinking probably not Faulk, but you never know what the Patriots are going to do.  I've had success doing the 'Chris Johnson/LenDale White duo a couple of times (Johnson get the yards, White gets the TD's).      Pretty sure I'm going with Johnson and Gore, and Grant, even though he's underachieved, gets the load on the carries, and is going up against the Colts, who have questionable run D.      So, right now, I'm going with Gore, Grant, Johnson.  Thoughts?

Recently the Taekwondo club I attend has had trouble getting people to participate in non-workout activities.  It seems like the same 10 people always end up doing the fundraisers, setting up for tournaments, volunteering to conduct and hold boards at testings, volunteering their time to assist with white-belt classes, etc. Things that are for the betterment of their fellow martial artists, the school, and that are required for them to be promoted.        It's a college club, so I know that people are involved in a lot and that school comes first, but I'm getting so frustrated!  The club leaders and masters keep asking nicely, but without much improvement.        Any ideas on how I can (respectfully) get them to get their butts in gear?

20090307105756AAq2O95	Sports;Basketball	Why are Most NBA Fans Dimwitted?	I mean everyone is surprised that Utah is doing so good winning 10 in a row and overtaking the Nuggets and Blazers after being down 5 games or so.      News flash this should not be news to anyone and no one should be surprised for the Jazz have arguably the deepest team from 1-12 in the NBA. Not only that they were 1 game away from the NBA Finals in 07' losing to the Spurs in the WCF. Last, year they were the team to have beat the Lakers more out of all the WC teams and only 2 games away from another conference finals.      Furthermore, obviously the team would initially struggle cause D.Will, AK47, C.Booz, and Harp (all key players) suffered considerable time out. However, even with all these injuries and a struggle they remained afloat only 5 games away from the division lead all year this year. 5 games are nothing and once they got healthy way before C.Booz finally joining (a bonus) they began to play excellently.      That is when they overtook the division. Once again though fans assume at the standings as they see it without understanding key variables and what would happen in the long run. Some see 5 games down I see it as inevitable Utah will take it. Showing, standings do not mean a thing until the season ends. Even then it does not mean a thing cause the playoffs are a whole other season.

Ok so last season I bought the 2008 Jamis Dakar XCR Comp because I had no longer needed the Parker II I had bought at the begining of the season (Don't buy the thing its like a tank, in a bad way). I was wondering that because it is a Cross Country bike what is it capable of? It looks rather reinforced but I would rather be safe than sorry. Would these be able to handle moderate jumps? Seeing as it is also a Full-Suspension I'm assuming that it would take most of the stress. Anyways, thoughts?

And if you think he will who do you think is the best replacement for him ?

Its already too late in his life to change his personality drastically. The only way he'll change is if he does Jail Time, or if he had a life changing experience.

20090307103429AAplSbM	Sports;Running	Running on my own for now? Is it a good idea, or am I just hurting myself?	My name is Misha, and I'm currently a Junior in high school.       I started running for my school's team as a Freshman, and it is the belief of a few trainers and physical therapists that I was grossly overworked due to my talent.        I believe hard work makes good athletes- but I was so injured by the end of my 9th grade track season that I couldn't run the whole next year of 10th grade =/        This made me greatly depressed, and I seemed to just give up on running for a long time. My Coach asked for me back this year in Cross Country, but I felt so angry and bitter that I declined. And as you can imagine, I don't want to run for my track coaches either. There's a long list of athletes that have been burnt out by the vigorous and sometimes sick training routines. . .             But I do want to run in college...             I have the motivation it takes to work out on my own and improve. I just need to know if I should bother. There are tons of races I want to enter and training plans swirling around that I know I can pick up and improve with.             But without High School running, should I even bother in college? Should I get myself back on the track team and risk being overworked again for the sake of it? I need honest answers.             Point blank: I'm willing to work hard, but I feel training on my own is best. But I'm not sure if it'll be worthwhile.      (I'm going to Division Three Schools btw)

20090307111544AABdOiT	Sports;Basketball	Dwayne Wade VS Kobe Kobe Bryant?	Wade has scored 40 or more points multiple times in The NBA Finals  Kobe hasn't       Wade set & broke NBA Finals records  Kobe hasn't       Wade's 2006  Finals performance was so "dominate" that he won a NBA Finals MVP   kobe has never won Finals MVP or had a dominate Finals performance.  He was actually ranked amount the 10 worst Finals performances   http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs20...        Quote:    "Kobe Bryant, L.A. Lakers, 2004   Lakers vs. Pistons -- Bryant's PER 14.2   With his feud against Shaq escalating and the series getting away from the Lakers, Bryant began taking whatever shot struck him. Mostly, they struck the rim -- he shot 38.1 percent and had nearly as many turnovers (18) as assists (22) as Detroit romped in five games."          That makes me wonder  why is it that Wade done all these things in the NBA Finals and he's only been in ONE ? But on the other hand, Kobe been in 5 NBA Finals and hasn't done what Wade done in The NBA Finals. He had 5 chances to Wade's 1                                 Kobe at 100%:   -3 NBA Finals heavily assisted by Shaq in his prime (0 Finals MVPs)   -2 more finals appearances (vs Detroit and Boston) where he was completely man handled and embarrased on National Televison while shooting a dismal FG%.   -Slam Dunk Champion = woopteedoo   -2008 MVP   -81 pt game = yes that was very impressive, but im sure if Wade shot 46 shots in a single game (which he'd never do cuz hes not a ballhog) he would get to 80 aswell.      Wade at 100%:   -1 NBA Finals with older Shaq where he completely dominated. Yes there may have been a slight FT discrepency, and I say slight because he avg 16 FT/game in that series to Dirk's 10 FT/game. Thats only 6 less FT than one of the most aggressive players in the game in terms of driving to the basket and drawing fouls.   -NBA Finals MVP = where's Kobe's?   -Wade also faced tough Defenses if you didnt know. He took Detroit to 7 games in 2005 with an injury to his ribs, and dimantled them in 6 games in 2006 while suffering from a sinus infection in game 6. He shot a much better FG% against a very similar Detroit D that Kobe faced in 2004.   -Led Team USA 2008 in ppg, clearly the best player on the team. Had 27 pts and 4 stls in the gold medal game.   -Skills Challenge Champion   -Better slasher, more aggressive around the basket, fearless, not afraid to get injured unlike Kobe      Now tell me, who do you think is better when both are 100% healthy?
