20090224172031AAOoXjP	Sports;Running	What should i wear under my track shorts?	my first track meet is coming up this friday. im really excited but that's beside the point. i am running the 3200, the 800, and i am the alternative for the 4x800 team. so if any of them are unable to run the race, i will fill in. all relay teams have to look the same, and they chose to not wear anything under their track shorts. the problem is, i want to wear compression shorts under mine for the 800 and 3200 because i need support when i run and boxers will just not do. so what should i do? should i wear compression shorts and just take them off and go commando if i have to do the 4x800? or should i wear like briefs underneath my compression shorts? help?

Anybody here notice that during The Undertaker's long WWE career he has never been billed as the number 1 top face where they built the entire company around him. There was always some other face that Vince paid more attention to whether it be Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Bret The Hitman Hart, or Shawn Michaels during the Federation years or Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock during the Attitude Era or John Cena and Triple H today. I can't ever remember The Undertaker being put in a position where he was by far the number 1 franchise that was the face of the WWE. He always played second fiddle to some other main event face on the roster who sells more merchandise than The Undertaker.

If you say yes, then you are saying that Michael Jordan sucks too.The reason why Wade goes to the line so often is because he is that good otherwise he wouldn't be getting fouled.He you don't foul a deadly player like,Wade, then they are going to score on you which is also why Jordan went to the line so often in the 4th qtrs when he was taking over.Hold up, Wade takes over games from beginning to end. Evey defender that Wade goes up against are really scare because they know what he is capable(defenders cant help it going for his pump fakes) of that even coaches are playing him like he was Kobe. That causes fouls.I know what you are going to say, Kobe doesn't get foul that much. No, Kobe do get fouled a lot when he is at top of his game or taking games over.

20090203140228AAMbpGi	Sports;Martial Arts	How (if possible) do you take someone down with a chest tackle?	That proably didn't sound at all like what I meant to say. My question is: is it possible to take someone down easily by landing a jump to the chest. I'm picturing the jump to the chest that leaves your opponent on the ground with you crouched on their chest, if that helps at all. I'm a blackbelt in Taekwondo, and although it's not the type of martial art to use this move, I'm curious if anyone of another martial art would know. The best example I can think of is the Xbox 360 game Assassin's Creed, where a move is performed by leaping onto the chest of the opponent to knock them down. It also kills them, but that's not what I'm looking for. If possible to do without an all-out tackle, I'd really be intrested in learning how. Thanks

20090225022722AA0vJ3D	Sports;Wrestling	Orton has not made his pick yet?	Ladies and Gentleman from what I recall the winner of the Royal Rumble usually gets to pick 1 champion he wants to face at Wrestlemania. Technically, Orton has not made his choice.  So, when will he finally come out and make his pick?  Or has WWE forgotten that he won the Royal Rumble?      This is what should happen   *Next week on Raw, Orton and Legacy should walk in to Vickie Guerrero's office and sit down with Edge.  They say "It's been a while and I see we are both having problems."  They get along because they are Rated RKO and they agree to "FACE" each other at Wrestlemania.      *John Cena says he has his rematch clause and gets in it.   *HHH cons Edge into asking for his rematch for the WWE title. (Edge has a rematch clause for the WWE title)      Then Ladies and Gentleman we have ourselves a fatal-4 way for the Undisputed title.

20090225023346AAYCsmT	Sports;Cricket	I will be releasing my autobiography shortly, will you read it?	Yes it's an old story but I will give my faithful fans a small titbit from my soon to be released autobiography.      Sydney, the cricketing world changes forever.   Many Indians assumed that I had been paid off by Australia to undermine their chances of victory, nothing could be further from the truth.   I admit that some of my decisions were way off to say the least and yes I do admit now that they were in fact intentional. What I would like to clear up are the reasons for making those poor umpiring decisions against India.   I won't include the entire chapter here for obvious reasons so the rest will be in point form, you will understand.   1.Indian fans call Andrew Symonds a monkey.   2. Harbhajan calls Symonds a monkey and is defended by the BCCI   3. Symonds is of West Indian decent, I am West Indian.   4. I'm a little pi$$ed about the whole situation, get it people?      BTW my autobiography will be titled,      "Who's the Monkey now?"
