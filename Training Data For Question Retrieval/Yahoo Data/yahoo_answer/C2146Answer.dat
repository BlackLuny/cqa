AA11307940	If you could come back to this question and add details as to where you are getting this error, it would be helpful. Generally it is a generic code when something is over used or Yahoo is having problems with a site. Give it some time and it will go away. I usually restart the computer and it clears up.

Some keyboards dont work, so your option there is opening your "Character Map" program (Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools) , find the symbols there and do a copy and paste function.

7u77AiBjaa	Yahoo! 360 is a beta (i.e. testing) service. It's been this way since 2005. So, glitches/problems were likely and using the service is a risk for users.     In October 2007, the Yahoo! 360 announced that they would no longer fix 360-related bugs, as they prepared to transition the service to a universal profile system. This UPS has started as of October 16, 2008, but the 360 transition to that platform has not been completed.    So, blog posting problems will not be "fixed", along with many other glitches. Some glitches may come and go though; not necessarily "fixed" in Yahoo! 360. The fix will be moving parts of the service to the Y!Profile, then closing 360.      These are my recommendations on how to handle blog posting in general (two methods):  1) Create and save blogs in an external program before posting it in 360. The best program to use is Notepad. It does not add extra code to documents. So, type your text in Notepad (comes standard in Windows computers in the Accessories folder) and put  between paragraphs, click the "View HTML Source" box of your blog entry's toolbar, and paste instead. Then, uncheck the "View HTML Source" box and add extra formatting via the blog's toolbar.    It is not advisable to copy and paste content directly from a full-featured word processing program like Microsoft Word or e-mails.    2) I write short blogs directly into 360, format them, then click the "View HTML Source" box when I'm done. I copy the HTML version of the blog and paste it in a Notepad document to save. Only then, do I try posting the blog in 360 because often they will not post.    Also, you can try posting at a different time of the day, as sometimes I find timing matters when it comes to adding content to 360. Editing and re-saving the last blog entry that did post successfully may help as well.      - See blogs at http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360 for more details about the transition. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on their blog, but don't expect a personal response.   - See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for more information on 360 glitches.   - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... .|`|dbCkTKDxaa	i can't even find it anymore

lqbAA0Ytaa	There are a lot of trolls, especially in Religion & Spirituality. But they are spreading fast to the other categories. They post questions with their only intent being to create controversial replies so they can hit the report button on you or give a 'thumbs down'. Best thing you can do is: instead of answering trying to defend your religion, report the question instead and move on. You yourself stated the the question " goes against the yahoo community guidelines".      Y!A defines a "troll" as ..."someone who intentionally and persistently posts inflammatory messages about sensitive topics to bait users into responding or provoke a confrontation. We also consider people to be trolls when they persistently misuse product features such as the ratings system to negatively target others."|`|XYOYml59aa	sorry to say but the world isn't fair. One person may get away with something but then another can come along and do something much less worse and get in a lot of trouble. It happens all the time.|`|cWuumdy7aa	all sort of people are there you cant do any thing about it .|`|9pO3XVxMaa	You can click on report abuse to questions that do not follow the guidelines.|`|nUdbTUtHaa	Its just a matter of who clicks the "report abuse button" first...    If you click it first the question goes away    if they click it on your answer then it goes away...|`|e7a3fccfb2817fc53718752de19ad354aa	Sometimes there is just one too many stupid people out there.  Religion and politics have always to be known as taboo subjects, because of beliefs and passions.    I guess if you want justice, report the question as abuse!
ykSjlyNJaa	If I remember correctly you should just click on they link they provide.  The only time I have seen this is when you have entered an alternative e mail address as well as your Yahoo ID|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	DO NOT reply.

fvUAYU7xaa	Um no i dont think thats a bad thing to say. Its just your opinion isnt it? I dont see whats wrong with that.    Maybe someone got mad at you and reported you.  Which is totaly unreasonable to be honest.    byee.|`|vqZ2XLf6aa	i'm afraid to answer in case i get in trouble.|`|RgNUsKfxaa	ive just had the same thing happen to me.    i dont understand the point in having this site if you cant answer a question    sorry il probably have this answer deleted as well and you too for asking lol|`|yJmjg9sEaa	Unless the question was something like "Is _____ a good movie?" or "Should I go see (or rent) the movie _____?" then your answer wasn't really an answer to the question asked. And that is, technically, a violation of the site rules, although not a serious enough violation that users are reported for giving such answers every time.    Basically, if someone asks, "Should I add a pleco or a corydoras to my aquarium to eat algae?" and you answer something like, "Fish suck, get a dog!" you aren't answering the question the other user asked in a helpful way. If the question was "What kind of pet is good for a 12-year-old, should I stick with something small that stays in a cage or is 12 old enough to be responsible for a snake, cat, rabbit or dog?" then "Fish suck, get a dog!" probably wouldn't be chosen best answer but is at least answering the question.    Nobody can answer your question definitively without knowing what question you were responding to.    (Also, "deleted" doesn't have an a in it, and "morning" means the time between midnight and noon, whereas "mourning" means grieving, for example because someone has died.)|`|Tx2Uk0KVaa	It depends on the question (which you omitted).  If it wanted your opinion on the movie, then your answer was valid.  If, however, it was a question about a specific point about the movie, then your answer is a violation.    Example:     Q: "Do you think that (character A) is better looking than (character B) in the movie (Teen Vampire Movie of the Moment)?    A: "That movie was awful"    Result: Violation.  You did not answer the question.      .|`|JLayHNZCaa	Doesn't sound like it, you must have some trolls reporting you.  I don't think anyone reviews the reports, if you get two, you get a knock.|`|lqbAA0Ytaa	That all depends on what the question was. You should add details to your question to let us know exactly what was asked.  If the question was asking something specific and you answered with just your opinion, then yes, that would be a violation. If the question was asking for opinions, then no, it would not be a violation.|`|AA10093245	No, it's not a violation. You can appeal and have points restored, but the answer won't reappear.  Whoever reported your answer will lose reliability if your appeal is overturned.|`|AA11252878	The answer you posted wasn't a valid one at all, thus incurring a "not a question or an answer" violation. It was deleted as a result. Remember that all there must-and I emphasize-mustbe an attempt to answer questions being asked by other users on this site. You failed to do so in this case. That's already a fair and credible violation by the looks of things. Go here to see what the Y!A Team has to say about this:  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...  http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...  http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...|`|RhkKGsipaa	at least two members have reported you for basically no reason, maybe chatting.  edit your profile so your questions and answers are hidden that way trolls can't' follow you around.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Eh?

Your yahoo account comes as a package and you can only delete the whole package that includes the following:          * Yahoo answers.

If you did not need to 'earn' points to ask questions with, there would not be enough motivation to answer in return.    Remember, while you initially pay 5 points for a question, when you choose a Best Answer (after 4 hours, before 4 days), you get back 3 of those points. So you are really only paying 2 points. Net result? You are trading 1 question (-2) for 1 answer (+2).

They are also shown on the "My Page" on the left side. The total is displayed which you can choose to keep private or show to the public. See http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/hom... for more information.    However, the page views come and go on most 360 spaces, which is a glitch/bug on 360. This is a long-time 360 issue. The counter/pageviews feature is notoriously unreliable. The best thing is to ignore that feature. You can't reset or modify it yourself. You can try the following to see them again and that's about it:    1) Refresh your Home or My Page several times. The visitor stats may re-appear on those pages at some point.    2) Clear your browser's cache and cookies. Before clearing cookies, make sure you know your passwords to sites.

NOTE: The Y!360 team is no longer addressing bug reports, as it prepares to migrate parts of 360 to a universal profile system (UPS). This transition was announced in October 2007 and the UPS actually started in a rudimentary beta form on October 16, 2008. The Y!360 part of the system hasn't been transferred over fully yet.   - See blogs at http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360 for more details. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on their blog, but don't expect a personal response.   - See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for more information on 360 glitches.   - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... .
un3eUN4Taa	You should always start with "Dear Mr/Mrs. _________" because this is a formal email. You are not "friends" with your teachers so you should NEVER use "hey" as an introduction.      You should also apologize for missing class, but don't make an excuse. Tell them that you are usually prompt and do your work all the time.    End the email with "Thank you for your consideration in this matter."    For some reason, this always works for me. Good Luck.
2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	It is not YA that is biased, but the users of the site. Each have their own bias and will report accordingly. You can report the type of question you quoted above; your questions can also be reported.     But take a moment and update your question, please. You state that your question was why the media allows anti-white racism. Did you give examples with links? Did you get any answers and respond to them with additional details, perhaps by name? Either of these might have triggered a violation (spam / chat) that has nothing to do with 'bias'. Also, if your question was more about stating your opinion of the media's actions, that is another possible violation (ranting). So there are other possibilities out there causing your violation problem.    |`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	i'm guessing ppl are getting offended and report.  it's not fair, but this whole site isn't fair.|`|iHlRHGHcaa	Some people on here are biased, and report if they got offended.

7u77AiBjaa	Different countries have different Yahoo! 360 aspects. Different browsers/operating systems make text and functions show slightly differently in Yahoo! 360.     All three terms basically mean the same thing. Click on the link to submit the form necessary for Friend or Favorite connections. You need to select the "Invite As a Friend" option in that form so that it becomes a Friend invitation, which the person will receive. Otherwise, you are just making the person a Favorite, which they are not notified about. See http://help.yahoo.com/l/ca/yahoo/360/fri... for more information about Favorites. NOTE: When you send a "Friend" invite, the person remains a Favorite until the invitation is accepted.    Now, depending on whether you've previously added the person as a Favorite, is probably what creates the slight distinction between the names of the link. If you see "Add" as the link name, then you've probably don't already have this person on your Favorites list.    Lastly, the service is called Yahoo! 360 beta. Y!A is Yahoo! Answers - the only connection that service has to 360 is that you can post a link to your 360 space in the Y!A profile and that you can get a 360 image to display as your picture on Y!A.

The first, which many do, is wait until questions you've answered go to voting -- then vote for yourself. This IS allowed by the rules, but the YA team does expect us to do so with honesty. So, if another answer is better, vote for that, not your own.    But a simpler way to get a high BA% is to give excellent answers, well-written, and be VERY choosy about what you answer. Stay away from questions that get too many answers and stick with ones that you know you have a good answer for. That usually is enough to keep your BA% around 50% or a bit higher.
IZDJlY0Saa	Check the seller's rating. Look at his feedback. If he gets a lot of good feedback, then he is a good seller.    If the feedback is low or generally negative, then the person is not very trustworthy and you should not buy from him.

If you are dealing with a high volume seller, this may     just be the case.       See if the seller will allow someone to look the item over for you     at their location.  Make sure the item is insured when shipped and     is insured at it's full value.       If a deal seems to be too sweet... It's usually a bad sign.     A great number of bids helps a bit show that an item is worth      it's value. But again you've got to know your product well..

For someone else's question, you must wait until the question is "In voting", which is usually 4 days after the question is posted, unless the asker has extended the "Open" period.    Just below the text of the question will have the information: for example,    1 hour ago - 3 days left to answer    This is telling you when the question was posted and how long before the question goes to "In voting".

However once your questions and answers go to the vote or resolved they become the property of yahoo and stay in yahoo archive available for searching and browsing and only the yahoo team can remove them.                            But you can make them invisible with the following steps.    * Blank out your avatar to the grey silhouette.    * Change your nickname or just leave it blank.    * Close any links to your 360, and email.    * Delete your open questions and answers.    * Set your Network and Q&A to private.    * Delete your contacts and fans. To delete fans block then unblock.  Then just leave it. After you've applied the alterations no search will find your Q&A,s.

tqAEoOAdaa	?Yahoo is testing a new layout, but it is not hitting all users at the same time. They are testing it out randomly on people and some are getting it unfortunately!    "M.yahoo.com" (or another country's equivalent) is not the Yahoo.com version for mobiles, but a new site layout, which is tested on a couple of users without asking them for their consent first. Some users like it, but most don't. Many are upset, as they cannot get to their mails without clicking many different links before they get to read anything.     It explains all about the New Layout here in this link: -  (http://ycorpblog.com/2008/09/17/testing-...       ?Note:- Clear your Catches, Cookies, Temporary Internet Files and type http://www.yahoo.com/ in the Browser window.

nkdPNAAsaa	Unfortunately you can not delete any records from your Call History list if you are using Y! Messenger Version 9, they seem to have removed that option. According to the Yahoo! Help Page found at http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/messeng... the Call History is now stored online in Yahoo!'s servers instead of in your computer as was the case in previous Messenger versions.       The only possible way I can think of to edit the history would be to uninstall the current version of Messenger and re-install an older version. You can re-install Version 8 from http://oldversion.com/program.php?n=yaho...

1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	It depends on WHY THE QUESTION WAS DELETED, whether due to reporting of the question itself OR reporting of its CHOSEN BEST ANSWER.    If the question itself was reported and deleted, the asker would receive a violation notice and lose 10 points as a penalty. The user whose answer was chosen as best answer wouldn't lose any points in this case.    BUT    The question can be deleted due to having its best answer reported (when a best answer is removed, the associated question is automatically removed), in this case the user whose answer was chosen as the best one would receive a violation notice and lose 10 points as a penalty (in fact 12 points would be deducted from his score). In this case the asker wouldn't lose any points.|`|maEk3Ui1aa	no it will not delete their 10 points so don't worry ;]|`|iKEjXj5Gaa	Don't worry the note we are here to explain and warn the poeple to whom history has been hidden or told wrong way and try to remember the truth with smile.We are here to share our knowlage and wait nothing returned back.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Are you certain the 10 point removal was for that question? Questions do get removed for reasons other than violations, for example:   ? no answers within 4 days  ? answered, voters chose No Best Answer  ? Best Answer removed as a violation    All violations SHOULD have a notice sent as well, but this may end up in your SPAM folder by mistake. There have been some cases where people seem to not be getting the notices at all, but this is a glitch and not a new procedure.    If you ARE certain that the question was removed for a violation but you got no notice, use this link to appeal:  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...|`|sDKCX43caa	You need to go to the link at the bottom of the Violation notice.

I can't imagine why your question would bother anyone. I guess we all need to get used to it. I did get a violation notice as recently as a week ago, so I think they are still sending them out. If they don't, you never get a chance to have them re-think their decision.|`|AA11657416	I know.  I got deducted for no good reason too.  I got a notice though.  I emailed a request for why, but no answer.|`|AA12196812	I am not aware of changes in procedures. I feel very sorry that some trigger-happy troll removed that question.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	No, they can't determine beforehand which are not violations. The bulk of violations are done by reporting from reliable users and an automatic program. Enough reliable reports and the item is removed. Appeal is the only recourse. The YA staff does this due to the sheer volume of reporting; there simply are not enough staff to monitor all the reports. A large number of users never appeal their violations, because they realize that they are valid. So this cuts down the amount of time the staff is required to spend on these things.     And yes, others DO appeal and DO get reinstated. When that happens, the person(s) that did the reporting loses some of their reliability.|`|hWc65sEtaa	I have appealed my answer deletions. I have had 5 out of 6 reposted.  If they find them  in violations you lose another 10 points plus the 2 they take away for the deletion.  If you win, they repost it and give your 2 points back.    They only review them after you appeal.|`|YRsTxWx9aa	One of my questions got deleted too. It was just a question about wearing makeup and I asked for opinion from some women. It wasn't obscene. I don't understand why it got deleted. Is it possible to find out who reported the question for violation?|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	Yahzmin sums it up nicely. What you have to consider (especially in the current economic climate) is the sheer number of staff they would need to check every report. Think how many users there are, if only 10  55 of them report one violation every 24 hrs Yahoo would need hundreds of staff checking. Then of course we would have to pay to use the site. Community moderation is not perfect but it is the only viable way.

7u77AiBjaa	NOTE: The following methods require that your image is hosted via an online hosting service like Flickr (http://flickr.com ) and Photobucket (http://photobucket.com/ ):    1) Check out the 360 team post on dragging & dropping photos into blogs: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Eha... .  * This method allows many photos to be used in an entry, with your choice in placement. Make sure that you are using an image that's on it's own page (not on a page that is shared with others). So click on the image and get to that image's full detail page (likely the largest view of the picture, not the thumbnail).    2) Copy and paste an absolute URL for the image (which looks http://www.domainname.com/nameoffile.gif or .jpg....something similar to that) into a blog entry.  - Check the box next "View HTML source" box (on the upper right of your entry's space).  - Type in the HTML code:    NOTE: With Flickr, just use the block of code above the pic's URL that they tell you to use...wouldn't want to violate their guidelines.  - Uncheck the "View HTML source" box to get back to the regular blog screen.  WARNING: Do not save your entry with out adding some text.  - Click "Save"  * This method allows you to use any formatted image as long as it's hosted on an online server and not only your hard drive. Check each service for their list of accepted file types before choosing one.    3) Due to a recent glitch with embedding flash objects, embedding photo slideshows is more difficult.

lqbAA0Ytaa	This site is owned by Yahoo! so whether anyone likes it or not, there are specific rules to follow. Everyone agreed to these rules when opening a Y!A account. If you did accept the rules, you would not and should not have been granted a Y!A account. There are open forums and chat rooms without the rules that you can join to exercise your free speech. But here on Y!A, you need to follow their rules.        For the probable reason your answers are reported, read the following from Y!A:    When does a strong opinion become a violation?  Respectfully expressed strong opinions that contribute to useful knowledge for the community are OK on Yahoo! Answers. However, questions and answers that express hate and intolerance have no place on Yahoo! Answers and should be reported. Do not use slurs to refer to groups of people, do not insult other members, and do not act in a belligerent manner towards others.    If you see something that is personally offensive to you but does not violate the Yahoo! Answers Community Guidelines or Terms of Service, please do not report it. Its also not OK to report someone because you disagree with that persons opinion.    It is up to each member to report people who engage in this kind of behavior, and to refrain from participating in a similar manner. Everyone has opinions, and its what makes Answers vibrant and fun, so report the violations and move on.    http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Free and fair debate is not and never has been allowed on this site. This is NOT a discussion board, a forum, a chat site, etc. It is about asking and getting an answer. That's all. If you want to start a political discussion, find a site that is geared to that. This one is not.    As to why you are being reported and removed, since you are basically 'ranting' (posting your own opinions and asking for validation) rather than 'asking', you are violating the rules of the site. So you get reported and removed.    I suggest you click the HELP link at the top right of any YA page and click the Community Guidelines link there. Then, read it CAREFULLY and learn to follow the rules. That will prevent this from happening to you in the future.|`|sDKCX43caa	This is not a chat site, one user asks a question, another answers.  That is the system.    Yahoo have little control over the questions that are posted so it is your fellow users who have been clicking the report button.  When criticizing a group, you have to be aware that if you tick them off you can be reported as being offensive.    You said  " I asked a simple question, why were these weapons not used against Israel recently, if these exist ? I realise that Hamas have crude mostly home-made rockets, but other, sophisticated weapons ?"        You obviously have not seen the vastly improved Surface to Surface missles that have far greater ranges than the "crude home made jobs".     CNN did an excellent report on these tunnels which are used, and though not very big in diametre they are quite well made with winches and trolleys that can carry substantial loads.    Freedom of Speech.  You gave up the right to free speech when you agreed to abide by the Community Guidelines and Terms of Service when you signed on.  He who cracks the whip makes the rules, and in this case it is Yahoo.|`|4g5Hu1U7aa	First of all...yahoo is privately owned, so your right to free speech isn't being infringed if your question is flagged, edited, taken down.      2nd- yahoo is privately owned --- of course they want one sided debate    3rd when it comes to Israel (or the middle east in general) there is no such thing as an innocent question    good luck|`|bFLP6COgaa	This is a question and answer site, not a debate site. If you intend your questions to be  'anti' anything, there is a fair chance you are crossing the line from questions into rants. Taking time to word your questions fairly and neutrally reduces the chance that your questions will be removed. This is the classic 'have you stopped beating your wife' scenario, where the very wording of the question implies a damning 'truth' that probably isn't true at all.
3mRKWJXpaa	Any deleted answers and violations are also included.  There also is a chance of a mistake, Yahoo has several of them.|`|hWc65sEtaa	There's always a margin of error in percentages.|`|lqbAA0Ytaa	Must be another Y!A glitch. I just checked your % by hovering the mouse over your picture, it came up as 29%. But you are right, it does only show 28% in your profile. Just a glitch.|`|sDKCX43caa	It is 29% and you have 29%. the system may have been a bit slow to update your percentage.|`|AA10006450	Yes, 290 / 1000 equals 29% exactly, so you would expect that Y!A would display your percentage of Best Answers correctly, and I believe that it would, if its software were doing its calculations in decimal.    However, it is likely that Y!A's calculations are done in binary.    Any given fraction can be either terminating or non-terminating, depending on the number base that's being used.    For example, in base 3, the fraction we think of as "one third" would be represented by 0.1.  And "two thirds" would be 0.2.  So we could add one third and two thirds, and get 0.1 + 0.2 = 1.0.  No problem, no rounding needed.  You know that on most decimal calculators, you would end up with something like 0.333333 + 0.666666 = 0.999999.    So now let's look at the calculation of your BA percentage.    I did a Google search and found an on-line calculator that can handle both decimal and hexadecimal, and supports fractions:    http://www.mrcalculator.com/hexdec.html    In hex, your calculation is:    122 / 3E8    and when we do that on the hex calculator, we get:    0.4a3d70a3d70a3c    That involves a lot of digits!  If we switch to Decimal, we see that this is the correct answer: 0.29.  But if we switch back to Hex and remove even just the one, lowest-order digit, we get:    0.4a3d70a3d70a3    and when we click back to decimal, we see:    0.2899999999999998    I believe it's likely that Y!A isn't using double-precision (or higher!) in its calculations, so they will probably be working with a figure that's even less accurate: 0.4a3d70a3, for example, which when converted to decimal is still more than 0.28, but less than 0.29.    So if we use the practice that Y!A does and truncate the result, rather than properly rounding off, we would end up with:    28%    Of course I can't explain why the mouse-over gives 29%.  This is true even with 290 / 1001, which were your totals a few minutes ago.  For some reason they must be rounding off to get that mouse-over number, but are still truncating the number when we look at your profile.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	I have the same discrepancy. I think it is an allowance for unresolved questions. For instance, at a given point, you have 290 best answers for 1000 resolved questions for 29%. Then you answer 10 questions for a total of 1010 questions. They keep your best answers at 29% until the extra questions are resolved. I don't know for a fact but this is my theory.
nuOpzUReaa	Yeah i had 2 questions removed too, and got a mail saying that the question didn't abide by the rules, but they don't tell you why, or what rule, they just leave you hanging there wondering, which is lame.  If they delete a question, the moderator could have the decency to tell you exactly what rule you broke.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	There are several reasons questions are deleted  not all are violations:  ? No answer in 4 days  ? Answered, voters choose "No Best Answer"  ?  Best Answer reported for violation  ?  Reported as violation    For violations, points are lost and you should get notice. Community Guidelines explain what a violation is  chatting is the most reported violation.|`|e820051fee78ce7849c9936aa4289823aa	Who knows! And good luck trying to figure that one out :(

79c8ae67c46c5115144cf09d72566a64aa	I would imagine they will want there phone back, but I can understand what you mean why send a new phone if the old one is being repaired, what I suggest is you call them and tell them what happened, and ask what needs to happen now, are they sending your phone back or is the new one your replacement and they were just late at emailing you.  Just call and save yourself the confusion, have a great day.|`|bHQpwVlXaa	You gave them your phone for repair, now your saying that you wanna keep that one they sent you.

mjTmQzvFaa	If you and your best friend are true friends, no boy is worth taking the chance to lose a true friendship. True friends are hard to come by.You stated almost the whole 6th and 7th grade thinks you are obsessed, people can be very cruel and that could cause problems for the 3 of you especially for you and your friend. Crushes are not true love, I would say try being friends with him and get to know him better as a friend before either you or your friend take a chance of getting hurt. Hope this helped and good luck, just please try to remember that true friends are sad to say far and few between. Hold onto the true friends you have in your life because they will always be there for you.

If you didn't migrate your photos before the deadline, they're gone.|`|bZ99fJVdaa	Yahoo! photos was acquired by Flickr.  The first time you try to go to Yahoo! photos since the change, you'll be prompted to create a Flickr account, and then you should have the option of transferring your Yahoo! Photos pictures to the Flickr account.  However, it has been quite a while since this change occurred -- I don't know how long they were going to keep the photos if you didn't get them transferred.

lqbAA0Ytaa	You will need to file an amended return. Whether you owe anything back or not is not the problem, ALL income has to be claimed on your return. The employers have already reported your income to the IRS. Employers have until the end of January to mail the W-2's. If you did not contact your all of your employers to inform them of your new address, the W-2's will be mailed to your old address first, causing a delay. If you have not received all of the W-2's by mid-February, contact those employers. Make sure you give them your new address.

In case it happened to a Yahoo mail account: send a mail describing your problem to account-security-help@cc.yahoo-inc.com. Or call Yahoo: 1-408-349-1572, explain to a customer service person what happened.    Can't help you with any other mail accounts, but if you are really mad at her and if she is old enough, this is a case which you could even take to the police.
