AAgX0SDcaa	Could be someone living up there. Ex-cons with no place to go love to find warm places to stay. My friend was a custodian at a university, she came to work at 4 in the morning, was working by herself for several hours and the secretaries and faculty didn't arrive until 7:30. They started questioning her about missing change, candy, etc. on their desks but she had nothing to do with it. Sometimes they would leave a few coins out on purpose and they would disappear too. So they called the campus police and the police started doing some undercover work at night. They caught an ex-con who had just got out of prison a couple months before living in the dropped ceiling. He would hop down and leave before most of the staff got there (my friend would be cleaning bathrooms and locked offices by then) and go outside, eat at a charity meal place, etc. and then come back in before the doors were locked for the night.  They found a filthy blanket and piles of porn magazines up there too. My friend was so scared after she realized she had been alone with the ex-con for a few hours each morning. The police told her that ex-cons have to find somewhere to live and it is hard when their family doesn't trust them and they have no job or money either.  The campus has cameras in all the entries in all the buildings now, and that is one of the reasons for it.|`|kZ8jIStBaa	The house is haunted.|`|n9PUzlhzaa	House is haunted.Please don't try to do any thing your self may be you get harm.

sK8ZhTahaa	It was definitely Jo Brand, on that episode last week before it even happened it was obvious that Jo Brand despised the woman, I even mentioned it at the time to my husband, every stupid jollyhockeysticks thing she said Jo Brand sneered or made a comment,she wouldn't even look at her when she said something stupid,I don't know why they hired her in the first place actually, she is as bonkers as her Mother.

I for one will not watch the One show or Jo Brand again.|`|tozYsZdLaa	You are right to question the BBCs decision in light of the Ross-Brand affair and in my view the BBCs reaction to both this, the Carol Thatcher gollywog incident and also Jeremy Clarksons comments about Gordon Brown are just knee jerk reactions to incredibly bad media coverage of all events.      To give some credit to the media the Ross-Brand affair was covered in a large amount of details and anyone who read past the headline would have realised that this was a pre-mediated action that was meant to be funny.  Not only that but the actual broadcast wasnt live and so should have never made it to our screens.  One fact that was mostly omitted through was that Brand didnt work full time for the BBC and so technically wasnt sacked in the full sense of the word.    The same is true for Carol Thatcher who hasnt actually been sacked from the BBC, she has merely had her involvement in The One Show discontinued.  In her case media coverage hasnt been so good.  These were obviously off-air comments made to an audience who werent likely to offend, in addition to this no-one except those who were there can really comment on the exact context the comment was made and only Jo Brand, the person who allegedly 'grassed' her up has actually commented.  What's to say she didn't just walk in at the wrong time and take the whole thing out of context.      And when you consider this the case of Jeremy Clarkson isnt really that much of a big deal at the moment either.  If you listen to the full interview is actually a parody based on the current world economic depression.  Before he goes on to allegedly insult Gordon Brown he talks about the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd shitting himself.  The comments about Gordon Brown are then used to emphasise, in a humorous way, the completely ridiculous way in which he appears to be handling the economic crisis by pretending everything is OK.      If anything the media havent quite twigged as to the satirical irony of Clarksons apology.  He has apologised for calling Gordon Brown one eyed and an idiot but left out any mention of the fact that he called him Scottish.      Given these situations because Ross and Brands sketch was wholly pre-meditated and in bad taste the BBC should have sacked them and all involved in letting it go ahead before reviewing its internal procedures over matters like this.  The Carol Thatcher matter should have been dealt with internally but she should have kept her job because actually at the time no-one was actually racially offended by the comment.      The only place they seem to have made the right move is with Jeremy Clarkson but it is certainly not for the right reasons.  The BBCs decisions are quite clearly based on whatever the general media opinion seems to be at the time weighed up against that member of staffs public popularity.|`|89io4Qdhaa	According to the radio interview of the Controller of BBC1 this morning the offended parties who took their complaint further were Adrian Chiles and Jo Brand.|`|AA11422300	Looks like it was Leftie Jo Brand..Of course she is a socialist BBC luvie who can do no wrong. The BBC hates Carol Thatcher and anyone right wing so they saw this episode as an ideal opportunity to get back at Margaret T. What Carol said was in a private conversation off air and yet the BBC allowed what she said to be made public. Ross on the other hand spouted his obscenities live on air and still keeps his job. Disgraceful.  God help when an election comes because the Tories won't get a look in on the BBC.

A message to Mr. Ahmadi-Nijad: you are a brave and honorable man, I'm proud of you and you deserve my respect|`|i7oHTo9haa	Iran is very powerful but not so powerful that they can't be contained and "checked."  Iran's goal is to become the 9th nuclear powerhouse they have already acknowledged this to be their goal.  Iran is also at the spearhead of the Islamic Revolution which started in their country in 1979.  Their goal is not to defend their self-determination within their own country's borders, but to expand and be the spokesperson of the whole Middle East and spread Islam outward.  This does not sit well with both Western powers, and their moderate neighbors in the Middle East.    One thing that makes Iran particularly powerful is their continued warfare by proxy.  They support regimes such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and are allied with Syria.  By doing so, they can wage proxy wars without actually shedding Persian blood or suffering the consequences of their hostile actions.  They have already admitted they fund Hamas to continue their wars with Israel. Everyone knows the PLO was borne by Syria, and that Hezbollah was also borne by Syria.  The hostile quadrangle is Hamas/Hezbollah/Syria/Iran with their goal of Islamic hegemony.    What makes them powerful is their fanaticism.  Within their "circle" there has already been a call for a nuclear suicide bomber.  Since Iran prefers to fight war by proxy with fanatics that gives them more power than one would consider by conventional means.    They are all crazy fanatics at odds with Western societies.  Iran regularly has frenzied crowds chanting death to America and Israel. They also show suicide bombing cartoons to their children on primetime television.  The Islamic Revolution that they are staging is dangerous and poweful, but like I said, it is in "check" with allies that continue to recognize the threat and defend.  We just need to make sure they do not acquire nuclear capabilities.      Iranian Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami to President-Elect Obama  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTY6czWnG...

He's just a freak.|`|AA11068194	I do not know who Derek Laud is but may I contribute by saying:  A golliwog is (according to our English dictionaries) a soft doll with a black face, usually made of cloth or rags and came in to being from an American child's story written over a hundred years ago.  It would appear that Jo Brand, Adrian Chiles and Ms. Hunt associate golliwog with an American definition which considers this child's toy to be an offensive grotesque cloth doll.  Carol Thatcher is probably about my age and will remember Robinsons Golly on the jam jar.  There were no ill connotations associated with this memorabilia until it was hi-jacked (as has so many other things) by those who like to play the race card when no racism was intended.
If7d3qJIaa	there is only a certain amount of salt that can be stored by councils so they plan for an average per year then add a little extra to that .  the problem this year is not the amount of snow but the fact that it keep snowing melting snowing again which means the councils are having to re gritt constantly|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	The UK has lacked any kind of grit since the end of WW2.

So what happens in milder winters with less snowfall when they underspend?  Where does the remainder of that years budget go?  Surely it would make sense to ensure that it is available for situations such as this?|`|AA11068194	There used to be yellow storage bins for grit on the side of roads which added to the main storage domes used by Councils.  Because of vandalism most of these old storage facilities have disappeared.  Also, it has not snowed in the UK to any great degree for quite some considerable time therefore Councils will have averaged out the gritting requirement for icy and snow covered roads.  This winter, unusually, here in the South we have had more frosts and a good deal more snow which inevitably uses up what has been stored.  I have just spoken to someone who works in a Council in the West Country and he told me that they using up more grit from store than they can replace with deliveries.    No we do not have idiots running our Councils we have average people just like you who take all the flack from people like you.|`|AA11422300	Another cock up by the councils?Government in this country.

VIJ1XPz0aa	The variants any normal computer would offer are:                                1. The most radical variant: kill them all.   2. Put them all in the concentration camps.   3. Deportation of ALL the Arab Muslims from Europe and America, together with their families who will in the overwhelming majority of course represent their interests and share their values. Technically, this solution is also quite within reach.        Of course, these variants would solve the problem of Arab Islamic terrorism. But until we are driven to the last extreme, our moral values will not permit us to use these SS/Gulag measures (and God Save us from having to use them someday) .So,  lets pass to  the  moderate  variant,  i.e.              4. Deportation of all the illegal immigrants, of all those who have the criminal record, and of all those who are suspected of the terrorist activity.            Technically, its very simple.      But after this, we shall face the question: what to do with those who will be permitted to stay? In a couple of decades they, procreating like white ants, will again become the very sizable share of the electorate, and our politicians will again start to appease Muslims in order to get their votes, and we shall return to where we were.    According to the laws of the democratic countries, the Muslims have the chance to DEMOCRATICALLY, THROUGH ELECTIONS, by sheer quantitative majority, come to power in anyone of them - and then convert such an unhappy country into the Sharia-governed rat hole. This well - known fact stimulates Muslims living in Europe and USA to try to make this dream come true.    But there is a small nuance; THROUGH ELECTIONS. In order to participate in the elections, you have to be a citizen with the right to vote. The time a legal immigrant must wait to become a citizen with the right to vote fluctuates between 5 and 10 years.     And what if we make it 30 years?     And what if we stop granting the citizenship at all?     The result will be that Muslims-the group of high risk-will not be able to come to power through elections.     So, the solution is to deprive Muslims of the chance to come to power in non-Muslim democratic country through strictly democratic procedure of general elections. This solution is so evident that one would have to be a ...well,lets not be rude:one must be a politically correct European or American politician not to see it.  Putting it straight, without the political correctness, the situation is as follows: Muslims come to Europe, Australia, USA, Canada in order to earn money and we let them in because we need the workforce. All is fair, without  cheating. But we must not and are not obliged to give them the chance to root in Europe, Australia, Canada ,USA and convert them into something similar to Iran. And  even less are we obliged to let them think  that they have the right to kill us in our own home.     And the rotation must be continuous , like in Saudi Arabia. 3 or 5 years limits on the labour contract and then it is good bye, get back to the country you came from. Who is next?  Muslims will protest and even riot? The answer must be very simple: You dont like it here? America and Europe are "bad", "dirty thieves",robbers"rapists" and "corrupt sexual perverts"? GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! BACK HOME! THIS IS NOT YOUR COUNTRY. Either you live by OUR laws, or you get out.

In binary sets with binary logic, in contrast to fuzzy logic named also crisp logic, the variables may have a membership value of only 0 or 1. Just as in fuzzy set theory with fuzzy logic the set membership values can range (inclusively) between 0 and 1, in fuzzy logic the degree of truth of a statement can range between 0 and 1 and is not constrained to the two truth values {true (1), false (0)} as in classic predicate logic. And when linguistic variables are used, these degrees may be managed by specific functions    The things in real life are not binary.|`|VcTaT7vmaa	usa and europe killed the arab and muslims in their homes.   tell usa to stop killing then the terrorist attacks will be stopped|`|2d4d4d8f449f8266d3033948651354acaa	Kill everyone. that is the only way to deal with stupid illogical humans.|`|r8TfSClxaa	I couldn't answer better than Daniel, you are using a fuzzy logic: Can we conclude that the war crimes committed by U.S. in Vietnam, Iraq, Hiroshima & Najasaki which most of them belong to one ethnic group: Angelo saxonians and their religion is Christianity are "Christian terrorists"? The answer is No.. which implies that you can't blame Islam as a religion for the act of a group of Muslims
qDLT1eh6aa	I heard this the other day, its awful, I can't understand how any woman would pick a man over her child!  Apparently she was begging her to stop, saying mummy no. Aw its so sad.

It doesn't matter what the % is people should feel a part of this country, in the USA black people make up what 12% of the population? Does that mean Obama should not be President because he doesn't represent the majority? We are not told lies - we should be proud people want to be part of our great nation not try and shut ourselves off in some kind of segegated Aparthied. Get a grip.      I'm not denying White Christians are not the majority - but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get equal rights- PC rubbish for the sake of it I disagree with totally but if we make groups in our society feel alienated then they will act alienated. I'm not saying Ramadan should get equal treatment with say Christmas or anything like that I'm just saying we should be aware of it. The only way for a liberal democracy to defeat extremists is to allow them enough rope to strangle themselves with - by being true to the liberal values of our country, not by becoming reactionary and therefore playing into the hands of the 'mad mullahs' etc who portray us as racist etc etc|`|Fhjc0xbAaa	I think the comment refers to some of our towns and cities or certain suburbs are multi cultural,  most incomers have enriched our understanding or others although I think the Trendy PC brigade often cause racism by silly rules like winter wonderland instead of l Christmas lights,  although Diwali also have some nice decoration but the fireworks go on for weeks.

S5H0NmEWaa	It's your research, you should be able to think of a common theme and pose a question which will allow you to cover all those topics. Are you looking at a comparator study between the Middle East and western or other cultures? Or at historical trends in Middle East views of sexuality? Or at similarities and differences in public opinion about sexuality within Middle Eastern cultures or countries?    If you're asking the general public for a thesis title, I think you might need to look again at whether you have enough familiarity with your material to be able to write and research a thesis in the first place.|`|2rdXW293aa	You don't say how long and in-depth your piece will be, and without knowing that, this is difficult to answer. Regardless, it sounds like you're not conversant enough with your topic(s) to decide what to hone in on. "Sexuality in the Middle East" is so broad - don't you want to narrow it down? Otherwise you'll be writing for days.    You could start out (thesis sentence) about it being a multi-layered topic, or not an easy black-and-white subject, or filled with repression / surprises / whatever. But whatever you do, don't let yourself be overwhelmed by your research (which is so easy to do). Pick one aspect, or a commonality to many aspects, and stick with it. You may find that you write your intro sentence last; a lot of writers do this - you write a "working" intro, then fine-tune it later, when the piece has gelled.

mNi2N6ULaa	African politicians, corruption and tribalism.  It is foolish to expect a country to become civilised by western standards in 100 years when the west took thousands.    Comment: Albert Schweitzer published his "African Notebook" in 1939. Did  it contain the following passage, excised from subsequent editions?    "I have given my life to try to alleviate the sufferings of Africa. There  is something that all white men who have lived here like I must learn and  know: that these individuals are a sub-race. They have neither the  intellectual, mental, or emotional abilities to equate or to share equally  with white men in any function of our civilization. I have given my life  to try to bring them the advantages which our civilization must offer, but  I have become well aware that we must retain this status: the superior and  they the inferior. For whenever a white man seeks to live among them as  their equals they will either destroy him or devour him. And they will  destroy all of his work. Let white men from anywhere in the world, who  would come to Africa, remember that you must continually retain this  status; you the master and they the inferior like children that you would  help or teach. Never fraternize with them as equals. Never accept|`|a772ac727655daef254b8e6748f36d1faa	because the general population is uneducated, so positions of power go to the the people who know how to manipulate the populace through war and civil unrest.

Your question is not idiotic, there is a lot going on over there. I've traveled a few times to one country that got freed from the French protectorates in the mid-50's, they are finally building up the infrastructure and at a good pace. There is still corruption, of course, different groups wants to rule it their way but at least they are building and attracting jobs, tourists and immigrants, so it is not hopeless.|`|B45065Plaa	Because they teach their future (children) to be murderers.|`|AA11690436	Your question is hugely idiotic because Africa is a huge Continent.  Parts of Africa would be quite surprised to find out they were so "messed up."  Your perception of endemic poverty and disease are hyped by media portrayals.  But remember, the media portrays the sensational, not the normal, otherwise you wouldn't bother to pay attention.  The problems that do beset parts of North Africa (like the Sudanese genocide) are not the same problems the plague parts of East Africa or the Congo, etc.  And parts of West Africa and South Africa (the region, not the country per se) are quite nice.  Is what happened in Rwanda somehow worse than what happened in the Balkans?  Does poverty in parts of Africa offend you more than poverty in parts of Asia, or South America?  What do you do when other's ask "Why is North America or Europe so polluted that it rains acid?  Why are all the people there morally bankrupt conspicuous consumers who produce nothing but expect everything?"  Generalities and sweeping oversimplifications are almost always going to be idiotic.|`|AA11595360	cuz its so damn hot over there|`|CqB5ryTFaa	blood diamonds|`|GWECmJ46aa	because of people like you|`|P3tIZ4cxaa	because its leaders don't want to leave power and the UN does nothing about it.|`|3AVHxNNTaa	White Man's Greed|`|wnyuH0aTaa	Because it's full of Africans - who let big business rape their lands and screw over their own people. There is also a tribal mentality that is almost impossible to get away from.      God help them.|`|gRfqjemmaa	This is exactly what Africa has always been. The tribes in Africa have been fighting for centuries, same as the Arabs. They had slaves way before the white man came along, they even collected slaves for the white man. Now comes the whites to try and save them, they supply them with food, instead of teaching them to grow it. Now there is so much aid, they cannot help themselves. The same thing happened in New Orleans, when the hurricane hit. Thousands of people who were being taken care of by the government, expected this to continue. Welfare families have children grow up on welfare, and on and on. There is no incentive to achieve on their own, so they depend on others. In this case, they paid for it with their lives, some of them. The others moved on to another area so they could be TAKEN care of. They refused tp work, just held out their hands. Africa is much the same, and until we leave them to their own devises, Africa wil continue to have problems.

1a2oh0vLaa	The words "Global warming" have been changes to "climate change" since the Al Gore idiots have realized how wrong they were. When Al was snowed and iced out of a GW or CC conference, the world laughed at them but then there are still millions of nuts out there that won't let go of the lie . Man did NOT do anything to cause it because it does not exist. Earth was one third degree colder this year than last scientist say. Al is just making millions on a lie(carbon credits) what ever they are. Is Al going to start a "global freezing" agenda now?|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	Humans are causing global warming and actively accelerating it.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	no , humans cause pollution.  the weather will change whether we are here or not.  global temperatures have gone down over the last 10 years , not up.  gore is raking it in and basking in the sun which is the dominant factor in our climate.|`|q3fLR2ERaa	humans definetly have a huge role in global warming but the earth also goes through warm and cold cycles, we are now entering the warming part of the cycle.    eventually the earth will cool off again and possibly enter a ice age.    a great way to answer your question is to watch Al Gore's movie "A Inconvinient Truth"|`|VcTaT7vmaa	the earth killers causing global warming|`|0c4e15c486b73273241480268ab82ce4aa	Yeah...Global warming is such an imminent reality. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to turn up the heat. It's 42 degrees here in FLORIDA.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Too many humans.    The human body puts out more heat per square inch than does the sun.    The population increases at a rate of 77 million per year. Each breathing out CO2 and consuming resources.    It makes changing my light bulbs for more efficient ones a joke.    Even so its probably a natural cycle. We are a natural part of the earths ecology after all. Even if it is caused by humans, it would be a self correcting mechanism that would wipe us off the face of the earth. When its over the world goes back to normal.
ZTc7rE1Haa	Only certain groups are protected against insults. Scottish and Irish are not. Yesterday evening, there was a comment on a BBC programme which I didn't like, so I sent an email to complain. I think more of us should do that. I'm tired of hearing so-called jokes about Scots, Irish, Welsh and Liverpudlians all the time. If anyone jokes about a black person or a muslim, there is a huge outcry. Either it should be illegal to joke about anyone or it should be legal to joke about everyone. I prefer the latter. We were much better off in the past when we could laugh at ourselves and others without having to watch every word.|`|cjmtIOwlaa	Since 1 is ruining our country i'd say they were fair game lol :)|`|doLyOac0aa	English, Scots, Welsh & the Irish are fair game, it's only minority's that aren't in the UK,
7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	That's why land management is so important to help combat disease causing insects.    In the Amazon, thousands and thousands of acres are uprooted daily for farming.  And since the land is stripped of its vegetation, when the rain falls, the water has no where to go other than to flood near human occupied areas.    Pesticides aren't the the best answer either because it physically alters more than just insects, with amphibians being the most effected.|`|n9PUzlhzaa	No.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	I'm not sure of your intentions, but after reading that article I actually like Bill Gates a tiny, tiny bit.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	No. he said that the mosquitos were malaria-free.

He did this to make a point. We have caused this infestation, sort of, by banning DDT. It was better to save a few birds from dying, then to save millions of people from malaria. Typical liberal thinking, which always has a reaction to their so called fix. Take this pill for a headache, which causes a stomach ache. Take this pill for the stomach ache, which causes diarrhoea, and so on. They banned DDT, to save some birds, but have no answer to the malaria problem other then supply them with a net!!|`|mNi2N6ULaa	No.|`|fSdSuMHOaa	No, he just did that to make a point. A good, valid point.
UNw3L5qfaa	The guy that made it famous it A WHITE AMERICAN AT BUSH - to all the racist islamophobes, had a great idea.    Shoes have been thrown at Israeli embassies, Israeli ambassadors, Gordon Brown, all people who are under the influence of the American government. Its a symbol of outrage by the people. Something which will hurt if it hits, but not to the extent of severe injury.|`|HRL5B9hyaa	Haha, some reporter threw his shoe at the Chinese prime minister while he was giving his speech as well. ;P|`|FsYUBf6faa	they can throw as many shoes as they want but it won't stop the israeli government.

I can offer some of my hubby's old work boots, once thrown the smell will knock out everyone that it passes over.

It is not civilized to throw shoes it is an extremist Muslim pastime. Westerners should be more civilized than that but extremists have already invaded Europe and influenced their mindsets, their opinions, and how they deal with their governments.  The next step is mass chaos from frenzied crowds such as we saw in Paris riots with home grown Muslim shouting to Paris riot police "get out of my occupied France!"    If the Euro knew what the Islamofascists had in store for Europe, they wouldn't be throwing shoes AT WESTERN ALLIES.  Please be more civilized in the West, we are not our own enemies but allies.  Think about the larger picture please instead of being moved emotionally by the news from current events.    The modern world has already defended against Nazism, Communism and now we're defending against Islamofascism.  America just didn't wait so long to defend this time and there is significant benefit for Europe to "get on the same page" with her Western allies.

We recruited thousands of black soldiers from the Caribbean. There were many black Americans that died fighting the Germans too. The Tuskegee Airmen were an all black fighter squadron and flew Mustang sorties over Germany and made record 'kills' against German fighters. We had the Gurkha's and many Indian regiments fighting for us too, though they were mainly deployed against the Japs in the Pacific.|`|X4hz3a9haa	yes.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Yes they did, along w/ many others that didn't share the Nazi complexion or religion.    Thought they might have been smaller in numbers, I'd hardly call any part of the genocide "insignificant in number" as someone else suggested.|`|ohKKJAi4aa	Muslims and Blacks were not put into concentration camps and slaughtered wholesale, although I am sure a lot were killed during the fighting.  I don't know if that Information about the Aryan nation was very wide spread at the time, or if it came out after the war.  I say this because the Japanese sided with Hitler as well.  Hitler was charismatic and able to talk many into supporting him, and he did it with lies.  He had German citizens convinced that the Jews were being well cared for and rehabilitated.      My father was an eye witness to actually showing an open communal grave filled with emaciated dead jewish bodies, men, women, and children to an entire German village because they did not believe.     The Palestinian authority also sided with Germany thinking that they were going to be liberated from England when the war was over.  I don't think that all of those dark haired, dark eyed, dark skinned people were aware that Hitler had planned to exterminate them after reaching his original goal of wiping out the Jews and subduing most of the countries in the world.|`|UNw3L5qfaa	Many. Anyone who wasn't of the German "superior" blonde haired blue eyed race.|`|gpwI2sbvaa	The Nazi party killed anyone who was different, including different races and religions.|`|Fbi9WYonaa	yeah nazis threw a couple of everybody in there. they didnt attack them so much but they did kill them probbaly for thinking that the blacks were jewish to or something|`|sbKWMMv9aa	A lot of Black people died at the hands of the Nazis in Africa and those that fought from the United States.    Many Muslims did support Hitler.  His non-white allies were also Japan for example.    You can see many pictures of certain Muslim leaders with prominent Nazis.  Notably Palestinians and Chechens were among those that pledged support to Hitler.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Any that were in Europe, I think France had some Blacks, either from Africa, or Haiti or somewhere, they were probably killed or imprisoned. I know African- American turned French singer Josephine Baker was in Paris and was not captured, but I think some were. Any Muslims in Europe were probably considered outsiders and not accepted. And most of the trouble between Jews and Arabs started with the founding of Israel, in Europe at times Jews and Muslims had been allies against Christians.     But the population of Arabs and Muslims like there is now in Europe was probably very rare at the time. No doubt there were some, but not a large enough number to really draw attention.    Some Arabs were trying to overthrow British rule in parts of the MidEast, the Germans were fighting the British so some may have joined the Germans, but I don't think it was that the Germans liked the Muslims, they were just there.     Yugoslavia had a lot of fighting and a lot of deaths, but I don't know if the Nazis targeted the Muslims in Bosnia or wherever or just saw all of them as enemies. They did not target the Muslims like they did the Jews, but they often made prisoners of people where they fought, like the Poles, etc. Hitler did not like any Slavic people, regardless of religion.|`|i7oHTo9haa	There probably were some blacks but I'm not aware of any as it started in Europe where was not significant populace of blacks in Europe.  The Arab worlds were immune to Hitler because of their similar goals, both are fascists.  Arabs in Muslim dominated Morocco already had three concentration camps set up to murder Jews by Arab hands. I think if the Hitler regime had spread to the Middle East and African nations then Hitler would have continued to dominate those continents as well.  He just never got a chance to because he was defeated by allied Western forces.  While we did defeat Hitler with Western allies and "checkmated" his Army, we never even "checked" the Arabs he allied with.  That's why we have an Islamofascist issue today, that is emanating from Iran, the spearhead of the Islamic Revolution.    Hamas In Their Own Voices  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i08L09V0_...

Hitler was fascinated by Islam's nature, and Muslims were fascinated by Hitler.. something which continues to this day.    And before you jump to the "Nazis hated all non-Aryan" bit, remember that Hitler allied himself to the Japanese.. and when it became clear that Germany was finished ordered whatever information the Germans had on the creation of atomic weapons sent to Japan.  It was intercepted, but the attempt was still there.|`|d9PdhBvMaa	I thought that muslims supported Hitler. And many seem to support his activities even to this day.

Muslim men in Europe fought for the Nazis and against the Allies. In Palestine, Hiter was treated as a hero and when he visited, he was embraced by the Grand Mufti, the Muslim spiritual leader. The Mufti publicly declared he wanted to copy Hitler's 'final solution of the jews' in Palestine, and murder every single Jew in the region. He wanted to build concentration camps as well.    Throughout the Islamic word, Nazi groups were formed. Today, in fact, Hitler's 'mein kampf' is still a bestseller in many Islamic countries.

WJjfrf0Caa	They have run into a few issues with access to the signal. When people use "rabbit ears" they can sometimes get a fuzzy picture and make the signal better. with digital, you either get the signal or you don't. so when they switch, some people will get no TV signal even if they have the converter box. so they are trying to figure out ways to improve the signal and make sure that everyone is able to get the signal.|`|VrjF986Aaa	apparently there is a long waiting list for those converter boxes|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Maybe people missed the commercials which have run CONSTANTLY for the last year or more.     I sympathize with people who, maybe planned on getting a converter box around the first of the year, maybe without a coupon, but lost their job, etc., and wrote for a coupon and they were out. Others may have had a DTV and did not think about the old analog in the den or somewhere and now decided to get a converter box. Some older people might not, even now understand about what it means, although I would hope everybody would by now.     I think this economic thing put some people's buying things on hold until the last minute and then it was almost too late.    The trouble is, the people who were waiting until Feb. 16 to buy a box will now wait until June 11th.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I've been trying to figure this out myself. But you should keep in mind that the digital conversion has nothing to do with the economic stimulus.     This digital switchover has been in the works for a number of years and government has been offering those coupons for quite a while. The question I haven't really head answered is whether the digital switch actually provides any benefit for those who have digital equipment. As far as I can tell, the switch really on affects those people who receive over the air signals directly from the TV station, and not those who have cable or satellite TV.|`|AA11661965	My question is why the heck we're even doing it? And don't tell me it's because the picture will be so wonderful.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	It's being delayed because millions of people don't have the money to run out to buy a converter. We still have millions of elderly living on fixed incomes who simply haven't had the money to buy much of anything let alone a converter box. In case nobody noticed we're in a world wide recession. Many people have had to forgo tons of things and a converter box gets pushed back on their lists of priorities. Not everyone has a great job and able to run out to get the latest and greatest, but some of you will never get it. Poverty won't effect some of you so you assume anyone unable to afford a $40 box are just lazy.. How compassionate of you.  Delaying the switchover isn't going to harm any of you so quit acting like it will. The switchover never should have taken place when it was scheduled for in the beginning. Sorry you're not getting your personal stimulus package hand delivered on a silver platter. Get over it already.

Those currently in charge thought enough of their constituency would like this plan.    Personally, I'm wondering if this means I should bother paying attention to government deadlines anymore.  Heck, they're just going to move them anyway when it isn't convenient.  Maybe I'll wait until June to pay my taxes since that'll give me more time to get ready.  (Just kidding, IRS.)    I really just want to know how many people who haven't gotten their handouts actually need them.  There's really no way to know. . . but I'll admit to being on that waiting list now despite not really needing boxes.  The government's randomly handing out money, so I might as well get in line!  I'm sure I can probably find a use for the coupons if I actually ever get some. . . or else I'll let them expire.  It's called "keeping your options open".  I can't be the only person who's doing that, can I?  I didn't actually think our government would be silly enough to make actual changes to the plan. . . .    I'm still hoping all my local stations shut down the analog side on schedule.  At least one's still running their countdown as before, so I've got a tiny glimmer of hope.

If she was unaware that describing someone in a racially controversial way would cause problems, then she is too dim to be an opinion maker.  If she meant to be racially disparaging to an innocent party, then she deserves to be held up for slander.  It is noteworthy that the recent slough of racially controversial descriptions are being committed by the nation's supposed elite, (and therefore presumably better educated) class.  Corruption starts at the head.  One does wonder how she describes the incumbent president of America or Nelson Mandela.|`|EuIyDMzhaa	The term is offensive and is seen as such by many people. Carol used it when at work - people say it was not "on air", but I think is irrelevant - she was at work. it would be same for anyone who may sometimes be "on show" - for example racist comments from a doctor in his surgery if they were made when no patient was present, or a shop assistant when only other staff were present and no customers would be unacceptable.    I think the BBC acted fairly - they did not immediately dismiss her. If Carol did not realise the comments were offensive she was given the opportunity to make an apology, but she decided not to do so and therefore was sacked from that programme.|`|UyAoOqByaa	Personally I think it's unacceptable to refer to anybody by their skin colour, especially by using racist terminology. She is a public figure and simply cannot make remarks like that. She was probably sacked because the comment made will have been seen as a reflection of her private opinions.
dGiYVfw6aa	I know it's crazy. She wasn't even running for president. Now we have a president that doesn't seem like he knows what he's doing. He appoints a guy with tax problems to be treasury secretary. He appoints a guy to be in charge of HHS that was a lobbyist for health care companies and his wife is a lobbyist too. He said he was going to keep the buy American clause in the bailout money then as soon as the EU complains about it he backs off. It's like other countries are controlling what he does. He says he wants to cut our nuclear weapons by 80 percent and he doesn't want to create a defense shield to protect us from nuclear attack. Of coarse the Russians say they are very happy about that.

The israel/Palestine conflict is one such situation.

They slaughthered any Palestinian that did not leave their country. 4 million Palestinians left their homes as refugees    Israel has been blockading them, causing childrens to starve.  They have been sutting off the electricity, leading the hospitals to run on generators.    They have been cruely oppressing the Palestinians since 1948.

With the US there is more of a focus on Iraq and Afghanistan.  While the uses has access to the AP like all others there is also CNN and other media outlets doing stories on Gaza and Israel.  There is no government directed media in the US...so the stories pushed are the ones people will pay attention too.  It might be people in the US dont want to watch an hour where only people from Gaza are interviewed about the situation on the ground after hearing that the day before, day of, and day after there were over 200 rockets fired from Gaza into Israel.  If people in Canada fired rockets every day into NY....we might want to bomb them as well.   Plus, after 9/11 one of the videos that would get played were people in Gaza cheering in the streets about the attacks, chanting death to America, and praising the homicide bombers, etc......that same thing didnt happen in Israel.   Since the media in the US is free...its up to the outlet to present the news but also present news that keeps the attention of the public.  The POT have never done a great job spinning homicide bombings as a positive thing to win the hearts and minds of people in the US, but naturally it is easy to feel for the side in the dispute that doesnt think you are the devil or has to deal with their own terror attacks.   If the POT tried mobilizing much more non-violent protests, sit-ins, etc...while having a sustained media campaign, and avoided burning presidential effigies, US flags, anti-US chants, and denounced all forms of homicide bombings, terror, rocket attacks, etc it would be MUCH easier to win over the hearts and minds of people in the US and the rest of the world....of course if those things were done, Israel wouldnt really have much motivation or reason for launching a military offensive into Gaza.|`|My65doewaa	Because the US media is more interested in showing the truth than engaging in jihadist propaganda.

We don't have a mass populace of extremist Muslims in our country influencing our politics and media and civilian mindsets.      Americans demanded that they assimilate instead of influencing Western culture.  One doesn't see giant Mosque in Londonistan, we aren't throwing shoes but think that is extremists Arab behavior not civilized Western behavior, we made the New York Muslims take off their "jihad" t-shirts as we aren't having any of that fomenting here, we didn't have Muslims shouting "get out of my occupied France!"  Those are European capitals and that is what is occurring in Europe, not here.    Remember what happened with Hitler?  He invaded Europe first and these Islamofascists are no different. They've invaded and influenced European mindset first.    Americans know what it is to fight for our freedom and we defend people that also fight for their freedom.  We recognize what Israel is doing, fighting for their freedom for 60 years as a Jewish nation surrounded by Islamic Arab countries. We're also defending Europe against invasion and spread of Islamofascism, even though their populace has failed to recognize the threat, their country's leaders do and are allied with us.  Their civilian populace makes it very difficult on their leaders, and also on Western defensive efforts of a free democratic society.    Americans as a general populace are more adept at history on the conflict and are not emotionally influenced by one sided media campaigns to slur Israel and ignore historical facts, most notably that there never was such a thing as a distinct Palestinian people (they are hostile and extremist Syrians.) We recognize Palestinians as the aggressors that they are.  If the Euro only knew what the Islamofascists had in store for them, they'd be reporting a different perspective than one sees today.      If you want to know who the "true West" is, it's not in Europe, as they are just too easily swayed. Advent of EU made it easy to influence Euro opinion.  It would be more Canada, America, Mexico and the South Americans.  We are the true west that weren't swayed by Islamic opinions as we are still not overrun by Islamic extremists in our countries. Therefore we are not influenced by them, we have more undiluted Western views and why our populaces in our half of the globe overwhelmingly support Israel.

One can look at recent smaller conflicts but it is a larger perspective to be seen. The modern state of Israel was formed 14May1948 and at that time neighboring (also modern) natoins waged war on Israel.  Now Israel has treaty with some and others gave up but Syria is the last of the die hards. The Palestinian people were birthed from Syria after the Arabs lost their war on fledgling Israel.    Jordan 25 May 1946, , Syria 17 April 1946, Lebanon 22 November 1943, Egypt 18 February 1922, Iraq 3 October 1932, North Yemen 1918, South Yemen 1968    Syria invented the PLO to overtake Jordan, Israel and Lebanon.   PLO was kicked from Jordan during a bloody Black September battle where they tried to assassinate King Hussein and used a Jordanian soldier's head as soccer practice. Then Arafat made his way to Lebanon and made statement "the road to Palestine leads thru Jonieh."  They were kicked from Lebanon and now Hezbollah has taken their place.  The Palestinians were birthed on violence from Syria and they are hostile Syrian orphans that for 60 years have bred nothing but violence. Other Arabs have already admitted their devious plan:    77.69% of the Palestinian men and women voted in Hamas who's purpose is to destroy Israel, Europe and the Americas. The highest votes cast were from Gaza strip, with Rafah precinct having an 89% voter turnout.  84% of the Palestinians support violence on innocent civilians (Yeshiva Massacre, 9/11) and danced in their streets after both events.    "The Israelis can sue the Arabs now, and demand billions or even trillions in compensation for the damage caused them in 1948-1967. You Arabs admitted that the [Palestinian] cause began after 1967. So the Israelis can ask: "Why did you fight us before that?" They will demand Arab compensation for the so-called embargo on Israel and for the economic damage caused to the Israelis. If the Israelis sue you, they will win. They will say: We suffered an injustice. We are like an innocent lamb surrounded by wolves. We've been saying this since 1948."  Qaddafi to Arab Summit 2008  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP2ePHOLS...    "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa. While as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."    "We all know the Israeli aggression will not be without consequences.We all know our people have been oppressed by the Israeli occupation, but that doesn't mean we don't have a right to live in a land we migrated to and settled in." Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas PM, 03 Feb 2009 Al-Aqsa TV    "There is no such country as Palestine. 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. 'Palestine' is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it." - Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, Syrian Arab leader to British Peel Commission, 1937  "There is no such thing as Palestine in history, absolutely not."  - Professor Philip Hitti, Arab historian, 1946  "It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but Southern Syria." - Rep. of Saudi Arabia at the United Nations, 1956  Concerning the Holy Land, the chairman of the Syrian Delegation at the Paris Peace Conference in February 1919 stated: "The only Arab domination since the Conquest in the year 635 hardly lasted, as such, 22 years."|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Israel attacked Gaza in December last year after Israel broke a 4 month cease fire with the Hamas of Gaza in November. Despite the fact Israel broke the cease fire, they call their attack on Gaza self defense due to the rockets that were fired into Israel in protest of the blockades that Israel enforces on Gaza, keeping supplies and electricity out. However it is reported by almost all new organizations as being Israels "offensive", not defensive, which it was, as their were other options Israel could have pursued to stop the rocket fire (not breaking the original cease fire for one thing) and because their response was so out of proportion with the rocket attacks.

Brian Douglas, stopped by the police in Clapham, south London, in May 1995, received a blow to the head with a police baton so hard that it was the equivalent of falling 11 times his own height onto his head, despite the fact that he had been backing away in fear from PC Mark Tuffy, the officer who dealt the blow. Brian then spent 15 hours in a cell at Kennington Police Station with a fractured skull and was given no medical attention. He died in hospital a week later.

When will common sense prevail.|`|Y46YE1e2aa	Funny you should ask that question, I cannot understand why this association was needed by the police involved, because that is what they are,   =police= how does the colour of the individual interfere with this employment?does this also infer, they have white police association?if so, what next as far as I am concerened I do not care what colour of \ police officers skin is they all are officers of the UK law. and should be treated as such if, there is any discrepancy in standards of treatment then it should be dealt with at the highedst level and stamped out rapidly their job is hard enough, and getting harder by the day..|`|96ndKQncaa	no i think it was because of that race row with the police force that happened last year..  the name may sound 'one-sided' and 'unfair'  but its simply for the black police officers that want fairness within the police force yeah?  but racism can happen either way... but no way can it be racist  it would be all over the news if it was|`|gYThMID8aa	Of course it is but nothing will be done about it.  Just try starting an association for whites only and see what happens!|`|beO40ap7aa	When you consider that up until the civil rights movement many cities wouldnt even allow Blacks to become Police Officers, you have to let the organization exist. If cops like Bull Connor and the Oakland PD (I point them out because if they were not racist the Black Panther Party would not have formed in Oakland) didnt exist then maybe it would be more racist but since thats part of Black History, then Blacks can have Affirmative Action and the NBPA in contemporary America as a means of changing the image of police departments.
62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Just remember the variation in terms and measurements regarding employment and unemployment.     Jobless claims usually refers to first time claimants -- as in today's news.     Unemployment rate refers to % unemployed during the target week for the target period. In some places that is approaching 10%.    Now, as for the raw NUMBERS -- these will always be misleading since whatever number would be in the denominator to create a rate has bound to have increased over time. Thus, 600,000 new jobless claims in 1982 was significantly more impactful than 600,000 new jobless claims today since today there are undoubtedly many more people in the labor force than there were in 1982, simply based on the population at large.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	yeah my profs all said last semester that the economy is just going to get worse and won't be at its lowest point until sometime this summer, no matter what obama does|`|ojEkgJoqaa	it already has it was on the news today|`|LF6Ox2k2aa	People wont be jobless, they will be "On Sabbatical" Pursuing new opportunities and taking advantage of New Labours adult recreational initiative.|`|5z85xkfbaa	According to the Speaker of the House, Nancy whatsher face, the American worker is losing jobs at the rate of 5 million a week.

Why don't Hollywood stars would are big proponents of aids research give their own money instead of demanding that taxpayers who do not support this cause be forced to pay?|`|s6stLtvLaa	I think if you were standing in the shoes of someone (or their family) who has HIV/AIDS you would be singing a different tune.  Yes, it is known how to not spread HIV, but the sad truth is, teens are not taught of the consequences of having unprotected sex.  They are taught that yes, you can die from complications of the virus, BUT, there are pills around to help you live longer.  Besides the fact that teens are just dumb in general.      While I don't believe this is where the money should be spent while the economy is doing so poorly.  However, from the view of someone who has HIV and from my families views I am thrilled that the government is realizing what a problem this is.  I think for now the money that is going toward this research should be going towards other ways to better stimulate the economy and once we have gotten back on the right course something should be done about getting more money to HIV research.  Until then, the economy is the first priority.
662c6b345a027e302f6999949dae3329aa	israel was defeated by the Lebanese resistance in 2000, but it remained keeping Lebanese prisoners & parts of Lebanese land.    So in 2006, the Lebanese resistance (Hezb Allah), captured 2 Israeli soldiers from the Lebanese lands israel was hogging, and the resistance wanted an exchange as what happens usually.     Israel attacked Lebanon then, in 33 days to release her soldiers without an exchange & to eliminate Hezb Allah,and the resistance fought it bravely.     Then israel lost the war because like always it didn't achieve it's goals just killed a huge number of civilians and caused destruction.     A few months later, the resistance managed to free the prisoners and the exchange succeed with German mediation.

Educators argue that an academic program encouraging students to pursue individual thought is much more important than what they wear. They inhibit creativity and self-expression, forcing students to conform.    Causes Discipline Problems:    Some students reject any rules. Forcing them to wear school uniforms only aggravates their rebelious spirit. They alter their school uniform by tightening, widening, shortening, or lengthening them, and teachers are given the impossible task of policing the students on a daily basis.    Little or No Relationship to Academics:    Opponents insist that their is no credible evidence that school uniforms improve school discipline or promote higher academic acheivement. The principal argument is that some great students are terrible dressers. Dress does not necessarily improve learning.|`|b0AvMRqbaa	Individuality can be preserved when a uniform rule is a guideline. More students would adhere to a uniform if there is a wide guideline in which to operate. For example, it has to be Navy and smart. Or dark Grey and smart. This gives students a wide degree of imagination, some will prefer comfort, some traditional, some more fashionable.     Students become the workforce, many of which have to wear a uniform of a sort.

To give some credit to the media the Ross-Brand affair was covered in a large amount of details and anyone who read past the headline would have realised that this was a pre-mediated action that was meant to be funny.  Not only that but the actual broadcast wasnt live and so should have never made it to our screens.  One fact that was mostly omitted through was that Brand didnt work full time for the BBC and so technically wasnt sacked in the full sense of the word.    The same is true for Carol Thatcher who hasnt actually been sacked from the BBC, she has merely had her involvement in The One Show discontinued.  In her case media coverage hasnt been so good.  These were off-air comments made to an audience who werent likely to offend, in addition to this no-one except those who were there can really comment on the exact context the comment was made.    And when you consider this the case of Jeremy Clarkson isnt really that much of a big deal at the moment either.  If you listen to the full interview is actually a parody based on the current world economic depression.  Before he goes on to allegedly insult Gordon Brown he talks about the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd shitting himself.  The comments about Gordon Brown are then used to emphasise, in a humorous way, the completely ridiculous way in which he appears to be handling the economic crisis by pretending everything is OK.      If anything the media havent quite twigged as to the satirical irony of Clarksons apology.  He has apologised for calling Gordon Brown one eyed and an idiot but left out any mention of the fact that he called him Scottish.      Given these situations because Ross and Brands sketch was wholly pre-meditated and in bad taste the BBC should have sacked them and all involved in letting it go ahead before reviewing its internal procedures over matters like this.  The Carol Thatcher matter should have been dealt with internally but she should have kept her job because actually at the time no-one was actually racially offended by the comment.      The only place they seem to have made the right move is with Jeremy Clarkson but it is certainly not for the right reasons.  The BBCs decisions are quite clearly based on whatever the general media opinion seems to be at the time weighed up against that member of staffs public popularity.

AA11922696	1st, for your Q., No, I wont, because he made peace with those who killed(and still killing) and stole my homeland.      Eastern Exposure: Misrepresenting the Peace Process  Noam Chomsky    There are disagreements between the two major political groupings (labor and Likud), but of the sort familiar here. Benvenisti was again on target immediately after Oslo II in describing the bounds of the mainstream spectrum: at one extreme, "a peace which imposes an unconditional surrender on the Palestinians," at the other, "a peace with somewhat more generous terms of surrender."     Asked how Israel expects the Palestinians to accept such terms, Peres's new Foreign Minister, former army chief of staff Ehud Barak, answered simply: "We are the ones with the power." Realistic, and traditional. A major contribution of Finkelstein's study is to show how "the language of force" has been the operative principle, and to place both the actual facts and the "mythology of conquest" in which they are disguised in a much broader historical and ideological context.     The most interesting element of the doctrinal framework is the notion of "peace process" itself. That the U.S. and its Israeli partner have always sought peace is not in question: everyone seeks peace, even Hitler, Stalin, and Attila the Hun. The question is: what kind of peace? In U.S. discourse, the term "peace process" is conventionally used to refer to whatever the U.S. government happens to be doing, often undermining diplomatic efforts. That is dramatically true in the present case. For 25 years, the U.S. has stood virtually alone in rejecting two basic principles of the international consensus on a peace settlement: that Israel withdraw from the occupied territories in exchange for peace, and (from the mid 1970s) that Palestinian national rights be recognized in the West Bank and Gaza. On both issues, the U.S. won hands down, a victory for the rule of force that perhaps should inspire "Awe," enhanced still further by the doctrinal victory that accompanies it.     read more  http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1996020...|`|NMpbLtuTaa	I'm not the "kissy" type but if I had to choose between him and a camel, I would choose the camel.|`|HUlyRTrraa	No way , imagine the residue he'd have left behind...    grose.|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwww...  !!!!|`|Ehgfz5nNaa	What sort of a question is this Arafat is dead why do you not let him rest in peace,now this is what you wanted to let Y/A people to know so give them the details also instead of mentioning a site reproduced below is a piece from jpost    "State Department official Ed Djerejian "developed a technique for shaking hands with the right hand while placing the left hand firmly on the bicep of Arafat's right arm so that he would be unable to embrace and kiss his greeter," Indyk recounts.    "[National Security Advisor] Tony Lake taught the president the same technique in case Arafat tried it on him.
