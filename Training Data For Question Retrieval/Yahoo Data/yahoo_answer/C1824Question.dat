20090220134123AA3iBpl	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Why isn't my ram working?	I ordered 2gb of ram from ebay:  http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vie...       I installed it and when I tried to turn my computer back on it made this beeping sound and wouldn't start up or anything. Just a black screen. I have a dell dimension 2400 desktop. I believe that the ram should be compatible. Perhaps I was sent the wrong ram? It says "DDR 128X8 PC400 1G AUM5008" on a label stuck on the ram. I put my old ram back in and my computer works again.

20090220134832AA6N4YB	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	What does it mean when it says "share with two computers"?	I just got a hold of a harddrive with Internet on it but I have not subscribed to service.  One modem option says "share with two computers."  I'm wondering if that means that, if I ask someone else who has Internet service if they will share their dial-up number with me, I would be able to log on using their account.  If that is so, would there be extra cost for me or the other person?  Or does "share with two computers" mean something different?

20090220134752AAmQBY4	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Logitech G51 Poor Sound Quality?	Hey, everyone.....        I've bought myself the G51 a while back and like it a lot but, there was a bit of a problem I'm seeming to have, I bought this for gaming, music, videos, etc.....  and I really liked the 5.1 surround but I find I am not getting enough out of this system. For example...  I go to play just about any game like assassins creed, and the sound quality is terrible at certain times like I can't even hear what people are saying in the game because of the music in the back round that just annoys the hell out of me, then I go to play a game like CoDWaW and it works just about perfect. Is there a soulution to this somehow by downloading some sort of driver or software, or should I buy a better sound card instead of this realtek HD audio.  Thanks a lot!

The laptops name is a Compaq evo N600c. I am using it to type this at the moment and it's really hot on my lap, now I've been reading other peoples threads (not many but i have) and they have made me believe my cpu fan underneath  is broken, if i look underneath the laptop i can see the vent and a fan inside and the blades are not moving, what should i do, try and fix it ?????i do have another pc that is good and i mainly use, all i use this laptop for is charging my ipod if someone is on the pc lol. i'm thinking about trying to upgrade it a lil by sticking a new ram thing in it and also putting on a newer OS because im bored, i think the laptop at the moment is on an NT sever. Any suggestions on how to upgrade and where to get the parts, i live in the uk by the way.         Also one last thing i suspect the laptop has a strange CD drive problem, it kind of opens randomly, and then when i close it, it pops out again, it's kinda funny =] well atleast it makes me laugh, anyone know how to fix it lol.      Hope you can help, bye bye

'usb keyboard support' was also set on 'enabled'.    i had to create a new account through safe mode just to get where i am now!      i tried reinstalling the logitech drivers, and that wouldnt work.   surprisingly, when i did the 'keyboard security' test, the keys were responding - ctrl+alt+f12 worked, as well as typing the random code. but after that, it wasnt responding again.      i later found some of the buttons to work, but only the f-mode and additional (eg. multimedia, volume, internet) buttons.      please help!    im about to go out to buy a new keyboard (based on this advice:  http://forums.logitech.com/logitech/boar...  ), but im not sure if it will solve the issue.      please dont ask to try other available keyboards to see if they work, because, to tell you the truth, i dont have access to another one.      p.s. to type out this question, im using the on-screen keyboard (in 'accessibility'). u can't imagine how hard, annoying, and long it is to do this...

Right now i have a Intel Pentium 4 640 CPU @3.2GHz   I am thinking that if i upgrade it to a    Intel Pentium D 940 CPU @3.2GHz, would it be faster?   my motherboard only supports Intel Pentium D and Pentium 4   and im on a low budget.   my processor is a 775 LGA Socket, 90 nanometers, would it make a difference? and second thing is i have 2GB Ram   and i think my processor is bottlenecking my video card when i play some games like crysis, on some sites it says i should be able to play high but my comp can only play on low with good framerate, my graphics card is a    ASUS EN8800GS (8800 GS which is also called 9600GSO)   and i think that i should get this prcossor. what do you guys think?

20090220150733AAUZAeK	Computers & Internet;Security	Did ZoneAlarm's licensing always expire?	I was looking into a ZoneAlarm Suite purchase, and I noticed that their licensing expires after a set time, requiring you to pay again each year (or 2 years, depending on how you paid).  I recommended this program to a friend based on my recollection that you paid a ONE-TIME fee for the software (with access to updates, if not version updates, at least updates to the spyware/virus definitions), and I feel it does a great job.        Am I crazy, or did ZoneAlarm previously have their licensing fee set to be a one-timer?  I'm actually not interested in buying it OR recommending it to anyone if it is going to be a recurring charge.      Also, since the licensing obviously does expire NOW, would definition updates be available after the program expired, just no longer allowing version updates?  Would it stop working altogether?      *disliking annual charges*

I think I downloaded a maleware called anitvirus 1, which downloads a fake secruity system and does a fake scan on your computer. Then it tells me that I have 61 infections on my computer. I bought it using a credit card online( it was $80) and that was supposedly for lifetime. It got rid of the infections (because they were the ones that put them there in the first place). About two days later the antivirus disappeared. I'm not sure if it was the malware, anit-virus 1, or something else. I m really afraid that I used a credit card and they will use it without me knowing.   What should I do?

20090220162659AA0pyFB	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Me becoming a Computer Programmer, People In That Field Only Please!?	What are the chances of me getting a job in, about, oh, 10 years as a Computer Programmer? I'm only in grade 9 at the moment, and I have a dream to become a computer programmer, I already have all my grade 11 and 12 courses picked out for math, taking Computer Science Math (which covers Trig, Calculus, etc), and Calculus & Vectors, etc. I want to get my B.A. in Computer Science, then my Honors, then my Masters in Computer Science. How far do you think a Masters Degree in Computer Science will get you in 10 years? 5-6 years to earn a Masters, I want to go big or go home, I'm going to have more of a chance then the guy with just the 3-year B.A. Or heck, should I even go for a Doctorate? I have looked at the website of my local University, which to taking Computer Programming courses you need to have University Math, University English (Mandatory to every University course) and Calculus is strongly recommended (these are all high school courses), along with a minimum 75% average. Will I.T. jobs in 10 years time be looking for computer programmers? I know no one can predict the future, I'm just curious. Are I.T. businesses in such a need of computer programmers they don't care about Masters and just need people with B.A.'s?      Right now I'm at a 85% average taking all academic courses at my high school :)

Hello All       I run a small PC Repair company in the UK and more offten that not am left with a dead Dell computer.      Sometimes the customer will agree to let me rebuilt there machine.  The problem I have is that when im building the new machine obviosuly to save costs I want to re-use the old serial key.   So for example I have a Dell Demension 8400 here with a Dell XP HOME OEM serial key on the side.   I happen to have a genuine copy of XP Home OEM SP2 and I try to install XP on the new computer using the old Dell OEM serial key but guess what ? yes the serial key does not work.      What is the reason for this? I can only assume that I need to have an XP HOME OEM with no service packs streamlined into it?  This seems a bit crazy as it means I would need about 4 differant CD;s of XP and 4 differant CD's of PRO and what about vista now thats bad news.      Please only respond if you have physicaly had this probllem before and resolved it sorry but I don't care for the theroy only the practical.      There is an offical post here:    http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US...  but many people are contradicting each other.      Thanks   Paul

Response was the item was sent on 2/12 ( i purchased on 2/6).  I just received the item today, 2/20 it says it was mailed on 2/13. So basically it took me two weeks to receive the item. What do you think? Should I leave neutral feedback because it took a little too long. Or would you leave positive and just mention the amount of time. What do you think is a fair feedback? Thanks!

I am running windows vista on a Toshiba laptop (I've had it for two years) and now everything is going to crap.

20090220121137AA4DroG	Computers & Internet;Software	From camera to computer?	When I plug my camera into my computer I choose to use Picasa, but Picasa does this thing where it copies the pictures from the camera, but all that does is make the pictures go from a thumbnail to a full size for me to view. I can pick from those to import onto my computer. The problem is I'm creating a surprise for my mom and we use the same computer, I don't want her seeing these images. I want to put them on the computer, transfer to my ipod touch, then delete from the computer. Does "copying" leave information on the computer, or is it gone when I remove my camera? How can I remove pictures I import from my computer? Can I still keep it on my touch? Also, can I do this with videos, or does it have to be on the computer as well? I would appreciate any help answering any of these questions, thanks a lot!

I have an Intel Mac (Mac Mini, about to have 10.5 put on it) that is about 2 years old (just FYI.)       I'm considering buying the Adobe Web Premium CS3 or the Design Premium CS4, I found some good prices that fit in my budget and these 2 seem like the most likely candidates. The main difference between the 2 is the CS3 is about $260 less than CS4 and doesn't include InDesign. I'm buying it mainly to learn web design (Flash, DreamWeaver and FireWorks).      Is the Design Premium CS4 worth it in terms of features and whatnot, or should I just stick to the Web Premium CS3?       Also what is the Photoshop Extended? At work, I have Photoshop CS3, but I'm not sure if Extended is new for CS 4 or maybe I have the Professional version.       Thanks :)

20090220154215AA50fOI	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How can I read in a full name in a C++ file?	I need to read in a full name such as "John Doe" for a C++ file, and it has to have a 20 character limit. My class and book both suggested using getline, but using cin.getline(name, 20) did not even give the user a chance to enter in a name, it just skips the step. The only way the file will read in any name is if I use cin regularly, but then it can't read the space in the name and I don't know how to put a character limit on that.
