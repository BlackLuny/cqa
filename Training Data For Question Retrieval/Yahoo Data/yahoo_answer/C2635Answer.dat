Or you can take buses 2, 24 or 34 and alight when you see Cascadale Condo.     Then cross the road, turn right and walk till you see a bend. Follow the bend and walk all the way in and it's STC.

The really only way to find out is the jack up one of the front tires, take one off and see if it will fit.  If the bolt pattern is the same, put it on.  Lower it "SLOWLY" to the ground, to see if you have fender clearance.  Then start your truck and turn you steering wheel all the way one way then the other.  Set your emergency brake and get down to see if it is rudding your fenders.

fc922603aca65d247775e99885a5a8e4aa	Ignition timing on the distributorless models is determined by the ECM. I believe this also holds true for the distributor models. The distributor needs only be set to a static position and the ECM adjusts the timing electronically. The ECM reads sounds picked up by a knock sensor, and the engine runs at the threshold of knock at all times for best combustion and efficiency. The sensor picks up on the knock sound at levels way below where it would be audible or damaging.|`|2fa11e33c80b5b5b4a8f7f651d61a47faa	what year is your car,if its fairly new then it dont have a timing mark,the comp. times it.|`|dd7ae239677a69b55359c90da20c7053aa	what year is this vehicle the timing is going to be computer controlled with no adjustments unless you have a distributor then you can adjust it?

They aren't stuck to the roof, they hang from bows--or on newer cars they are one-piece replacements.    If you have patience, you can just tear out the entire old headliner and glue in some high density, high quality black or gray foam. If you cut it and glue it neatly, it looks amazingly good.

I wanted to add that while transmissions are programmed to shift at certain points, these points change with respect to throttle position. For example, if you floor your car from a dead stop it will shift at a later point than if you left at half throttle from a dead stop. Generally, the lighter you push down on the gas pedal, the sooner your transmission will shift into the next gear. Because of this nobody is going to be able to give you a definitive, or absolute answer. And without knowing the year make and model of car we don't even have a starting point for reference.

Kind of like the housing market 10 years ago, who would have known?  Cars are rarely a good investment.  Most depreciate 50 percent in 3 years.  Adding rims, a stereo, and an aftermarket suspension accelerates the depreciation even more.    Buy a car because you like it, not because you hope that other people are going to want it 40 years from now and pay your retirement.    If you are very sure about getting a car for investment purposes, get a car that is very expensive and made in low numbers of production.  In other words, keep your eye on the Ford GT (not the Mustang GT, the GT)  Keep your eyes on the Maybach. The Bugatti is also a surefire hit with car collectors.  Sell grandma's 87 Toyota Cressida, it ain't going to be a classic.  Funny story that you mentioned Mustangs.  Back in 1986, I had a neighbor who bought the Mustang SVO thinking that it was going to be a collector's car in the future.  He bought it and let it sit in the garage for years.

Temperature and pressure are relative to each other, it blows warm because the high temperatures outside cause an increase in pressure in the system, causing the binary switch in the system to turn off the compressor to protect the system. When the pressure drops to within safe limits, it comes back on. Cures include checking the electric fan for correct operation, cleaning the condensor outside (the a/c radiator in front of your radiator) with high pressure water, the condensor inside (an a/c shop can flush it)the evaporator (the a/c radiator in your dash), and having the entire system checked by a tech to determine that it's charged with the correct amount of freon at the right pressure.

AA11078918	I can speak from experience, I own a Toyota Highlander Hybrid and a Toyota Prius. Yes we paid a little more than if we bought a regular ICE vehicle, but not 3X like some uninformed moron says. We originally bought the Prius in '05(for the wife) and have averaged 50mpg. This is real world use not EPA estimates. We got the Highlander(for me) back in the spring and it's drive train is based on the Prius with an additional electric motor on the rear wheels which bumps the hp up to a very impressive 286 hp. It can get up and move. I have averaged 26 mpg from March to the present(again real world data). The technology while fairly new(less than ten yrs old) is good and proven. If you want to shrink your footprint on the world then get a hybrid. If, like the previous posters you just want a car that gets good milage but still pollutes, go for one of the little POS's that are out now. As with any vehicle purchase do your research, know your prices, know what you can truely afford and stick to your guns!!

I guess that's why they cost so much,.|`|6937f2a24cb806097f40cee31af265beaa	They are proven, but they are a waste of money. The so called fuel savings doesn't make up the difference in purchase price over a regular gas car. Buy a Toyota Yaris or Honda Fit for maximum fuel economy at a price close to or above $10,000 less than the hybrid cars available for Honda & Toyota.     The Hybrid SUV's for sale by all manufactures are a joke, no significant fuel mileage gain and MUCH poorer performance.|`|346288247058a097d7a7c69d472744d6aa	You are very right.

If you are driving in snow, equip a front wheel drive car with snow and ice tires such as Bridgestone Blizzzaks.  Fantastic tires for winter driving.  Mine came from The Tire Rack in South Bend IN.|`|95c67cd5d8a59cf158f64016bf464c18aa	GM is touting that their new full size Trucks and SUV's are getting   20+ miles per gallon.  It really depends on what catches your eye and   what concessions you are willing to make.  Maybe you will be happy   with 17mpg and something you really like to drive?|`|b02b15fd149e09bb71a719b2eb94a2a1aa	Why does it have to be an SUV? Do you plan on going off road a lot?  Many less expensive SUVs don't have all-wheel or four wheel drive standard; you'll pay more for it one way or another.  A truck will carry bigger loads, if that's what you want this vehicle for.    Do you really mean a NEW vehicle, or one new to you?  There are some SUV hybrids coming or just out, but those will actually be new and cost quite a bit.  It will take a lot of years for the fuel savings to offset the new hybrid SUV price.    And those vehicles will take more energy and harmful materials to build, so it's not just a question of smaller fuel consumption to lessen environmental impact.  If the environment is your concern, the overall balance must be considered.    Generally speaking, large heavy SUVs, with or without hybrid power systems, are environmentally nasty, cost prohibitive, and unlikely to  be efficient.|`|1SnI86BIaa	SUV and fuel efficient dont go together..
pffEqA9aaa	OK, you've already fixed the head gasket.  Now a way of getting water out without using any electrical machines (not sure what you have available) is to cut a large sponge (the type you might use to wash a car) into long skinny strips.  Insert the strips into the spark plug holes to drag out the water.  It may take several passes, each time squeezing out the water and re-inserting the sponge strip.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	I would get out as much out as possible, by hooking a shop vac upto a rubber hose and stickign it in the spark plug hole then just run the engine.  After that i might blow air in it to disperse it and hope it evaporates.  Running the engine would work too, Water vaopr comes out your exhaust as part of the combustion process to begin with and it wont harm anything.    Letting the water sit will cause harm to your cylinders though.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	water  blow it out with air hose really id say replace head gasket first|`|12dQQiaOaa	Sounds like the Head Gasket. I would be more concerned about how the water got there. I would have pulled the plugs as you already have. Water is very thin, turning it over should eliminate it with all of the plugs out and then change the oil. But again, how did it get there so you don't have to repeat this?|`|J048C14Raa	There could be a crack in the head or engine block somewhere or a blown head gasket.  The latter problem was caused by the former problem.  Fix the former problem first.

uu9q87SZaa	Two cycle engines eat spark plugs and flood easily. Pull the plug, spin the motor over to dry it out (ign off, gas off and choke off) If you do that for about 30sec it should no longer smell like raw gas fumes coming from the exhaust  Let it sit for an hour to dry out and then put in a new plug (check the plug gap, it is important!) Connect the plug wire to the plug, lay the plug on the head and spin over the motor with the ign on and you should see a fat blue spark.  If you are getting spark, install the plug and fire it up! If it still won't start, check the baffle in the exhaust. I have seen them get so fouled with oil and carbon that they choke the motor. If it is really gunked up you can just pull the core out. If the motor starts after that you will need to clean or replace the baffle. Or leave it out and annoy the neighbors..LOL|`|2FT7sVkbaa	you only paid $300 for it    do you expect quality for that price?|`|AA10106002	Remove the spark plug and gap and clean it for starters.|`|AA10582974	It could be flooded - remove the spark plug and pull the starter cord to empty the bottom end.  Replace the spark plug - once it gets fouled, it's almost impossible to get it cleaned again.   Then try to start it with the choke on and the throttle WFO (wide fkn open).

If there were to be a leak in the exhasut manifold or combustion heater, then there is a real hazard of CO entering the cockpit or passenger cabin.    Jet aircraft use bleed air (surplus hot compressed air from the compressor) for cabin heat, and that air is drawn from the engine ahead of the combustion chamber so there is no hazard for CO.|`|4bGQpFB3aa	Not as standard, they are available through after-market sources (portable ones) like Sporty's and Aircraft Spruce and Specialty.    It's really not that big a danger.|`|3EEfCAMSaa	Not sure if you ment it for large commercial aircraft but the answer is no. The cabin pressurized air is bled from the compressor on each engine, this is before the combustion process. Therefore there is no danger of carbon monoxide during normal flight.|`|WrXY4Wm9aa	No, not as a factory mounted option.    You can buy some little one time panel mounted bits of plastic with a disc that changes color when carbon monoxide is detected from Sporty's. I've seen these things around for years and I don't know if they even work as advertised. Usually someone will buy one, stick it on his panel and it will discolor as it will sit in sunlight for years. I'm skeptical as to their effectiveness.    Aww Warbird, ya beat me to it. You'll get the thumbs up.

Depending on the price, used trail bikes usually sell pretty quickly! A used car dealer might be able to help,...just make sure up front that they don't want some outrageous commission,like 50% of the sale price. A word of advice, make sure you have the cash in you hand before you let the bike out of your sight, stolen dirt bikes are almost never recovered. Good luck!
n7jXAQFWaa	Usually when it comes to local searches, I start out with Google Maps and do a search for what kind of place I'm looking for. The results generally have a phone number if not a website.

95c67cd5d8a59cf158f64016bf464c18aa	Many reasons for a car to wind up at a Pawn Shop,  most likely a   Title loan that they could not afford to repay due to the outrageous   repayment fees the Pawn Shops charge.  They now have title to the  car and will recoup their money ten times over when the vehicle   sells.  I once tried to buy a Caddy that the pawn broker had approx.  $400 tied up in it and they wanted $4500 for the car.  Outrageous!!|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Uh, they needed money fast. Many pawn shops do title loans where they loan someone a fraction of the car's worth and hold the title. If the person doesn't repay the loan in a certain amount of time, the car is sold and the pawn shop keeps all the money, even if it more than the person owed on the loan.

R1vZHRIDaa	Obtain as many secondary qualifications as you possibly can as secondary school is compulsory and so are the subjects your school does. While you are still at secondary school it is best and most advisable that you begin flying lessons in order to obtain your PPL license. This is the very first license you should obtain and after gaining your PPL you should continue to gain many other licenses and ratings:   Private Pilot License.  Instrument Rating;  Commercial License;  Multi-Engine license/add-on;  Certified Flight Instructor (CFI);  Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII);  Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI);  Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI).  There are quite a lot widely available. The first one you will do, PPL, you can start the lessons at a minimum age 14 years old, go solo at a minimum age 16 years old and obtain license at 17 years old. From there your instructor can advise you what to do next and from then on.  After secondary school, go on to tertiary education (Known as A-level in the UK, short for Additional Level). You can choose 4 or 5 courses to take for one year. For the second and final year you will drop one course. Preferably you want to be looking at taking Mathematics, Physics, A Language and a subject you enjoy. (If youre doing 5 subjects which is very rare choose something else useful e.g. Geography, Engineering or most of all English).  For the second year as I stated you drop one subject. It is very advised that you drop the subject you enjoy as the other subjects are your main priorities. If you gain all of these then move onto university, choose any course you like, preferably the course that you are best at as airlines don't mind which degree you have as long as you have one (However it is sometimes possible to become a pilot without a degree but is unlikely). Remember that during all these stages and levels of education continue with your flying and gaining more ratings and try to log as many hours as you possibly can. This is very important when it comes to decision time.   Airlines say that a degree isnt required, which is partly true but the competition is extremely high and candidates with a degree are head and shoulders above the candidates who dont have a degree. For university it is best that you choose to do a 4-year degree of the subject that you excel at the most. So, the subject you get best at A-Level, carry it on to degree level as airlines don't mind which degree you have obtained but as long as you have one (although a degree isn't a necessity). Or you could do a combinational degree as I did; I did Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics and Spanish at A-Level and carried Mathematics and Spanish on to degree level. The choice is yours on which subject to do.  Also, if you really want to become a pilot then you will be a better candidate if you have logged hours in a light aircraft. It is advisable that you log a bare minimum of 600 hours but really try to excel that target.  So, while youre still at secondary school I suggest you begin taking flying lessons to obtain a PPL (Private Pilot License). Minimum ages are:  Begin lessons: 14  Go solo: 16  Obtain license: 17  Once you have obtained this you should log as many hours as you possibly can before entering university as you will be struggling financially unless youre rich.  So by the age of 22 you could have all your GCSE's, 4 A/S levels. 3 A levels, a degree and a PPL license.  With this you are an almost perfect candidate and stand an extremely strong chance of becoming a pilot. This is the way I did it so I like to think it would help other people as well.    For training for a PPL on a Cessna 150M here are the costs:  45 hours flying C150 - 5,175  Landing fees (estimate) - 300  Training items - 175  Annual membership varies for each school but mine is 99.50  Radio-telephony test fee - 55  Total - 5,804    GROUND STUDIES:  Ground school (when required) 25 per hour  Written exams - 30 each  IMC test - 65  Radiotelephony test - 65  PPL skill test - 130  Class 2 medical examination - 140    If you want to do it in a better plane such as a Tobago TB10 then add 21 for every hour you take.    Self hire for these aircraft are approximately 95 per hour including landing fee    Class 1 Medical examination  Study books (7 books at approx $30 each)  Instrument Rating  Radiotelephony equipment and test fee  Landing fees (varies on size of airport)  Ground studies and tuition  Written examination fee  PPL Skill test  IMC test  The only clothing you need is a highly visible vest (bright green or yellow)  Membership  Total cost approx 5500|`|fZjgIE9Baa	First off, college. Not all airlines require a degree. Several of the "regional" airlines don't require a degree. However, most of the "majors" do. So where do you want to end up? Charter flying and other corporate flying has a policy on a per-company basis. But if you have it, it may put you ahead of someone who doesn't.    Air Force.  You'll be committed to them for no less than 10 years. Are you prepared to devote that time? Not to mention you'll be IN the military and may have to deploy, fight, and possibly pay the ultimate sacrifice. It may be for you, it may not.    If you do choose college, then the question is do you chose an "aviation university" or not. Aviation Universities include Embry Riddle, Auburn University, along with many more. OR, you can choose to attend an "airline academy" which will be independent of a 4 year degree but will have you ready from start to ready for an airline interview in XX number of days/months. These include Delta Connection Academy     Anyway, to be competitive for a regional airline right now you will ultimately need (in terms of flight experience) your Commercial Multi Airplane license with an Instrument rating at probably AT LEAST 800 hours of flight time of which at least 100 hours should be in a multi-engine airplane.     If you go to one of the academy's be prepared to spend around $25,000 up front (or within a few months) to get that commercial multi.... Other wise, if you obtain the licenses/ratings as you go the following will become familiar terms to you:  -- Private Pilot License  -- Instrument Rating  -- Commercial License  -- Multi-Engine license/add-on  -- Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)  -- Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII)  -- Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI)  -- Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI)    I would also recommend www.aopa.org to investigate learning to fly. If you do go to a local flight school, I recommend something called a "Discovery Flight."    The list goes on. If you want to ask specific questions, feel free to send me an email.    Pros: If you love flying, you are getting paid for your passion; once you gain some seniority and are flying larger aircraft the pay is good  Cons: Often away from home, entry pay is very low, you don't always get the route you want when you just start off    When you are still in school, focus on the math and science areas|`|DuGKtqAkaa	You will find in the link U.S.A. Admission Requirements in the link below  Yes, it costs money to go to pilot school (there are loans for this and financing)  and another way to get this is to join the Air Force and train there.

gM8MUde7aa	It's very easy. I put this on my Z06 in less than 10 minutes. Most of those minutes were spent jacking up the car.    Do you have the skip shift kit from a place like Southern Car Parts? That's where I got mine. I think they're pretty similar. Here's how to do it (going from memory, but once you get underneath the car, it will be obvious)    1) jack up rear of your car, and secure on jackstands.  2) Crawl underneath, on your back, and get to where you can look up alongside the left (drivers) side of the transmission.  3) Look for a cable running to your transmission, that has a connector on it.    4) Installing this kit involves disconnecting that connector, and then with the two exposed ends, you attach the corresponding part from your skip shift kit.    5) You'll now have a loose cable floating around... find a place to secure it, or zip-tie it back onto itself like I did.    6) Get out from under the car, lower it, and enjoy no more 1-4 nonsense! next step, go buy a C6Z shifter and all is right in the world.
Gn0nR2S1aa	Where is the coolant going? Leaking out or in? Sounds like the thermostat is stuck closed making the engine overheat and, not allowing hot air inside the car.

The propeller broke apart and now the coolant is not circulating in the cooling system.do not drive car! have water pump replaced.|`|c48nm70gaa	After the engine has been on for ten minutes, wrap your hand around the top radiator hose. If it's too hot to hold, the coolant is circulating.     The radiator could be junked-up with corrosion, the thermostat could be stuck closed if the upper radiator hose is cold, the heater core could be plugged -(check that by wrapping your hands around both hoses. both should be hot.) If the water does not circulate (closed thermostat, broken water pump impeller) these parts need replacing.    Small hint: Any car or truck that's over ten years old that's not had regular three year cooling system drain, flush and cleaning is susceptible to radiator core blockage. A fresh new radiator may be in order!|`|12dQQiaOaa	Check your coolant level again. Sounds like it could be a head gasket.  I would first change the Thermostat with a lower Temp one. They usually have three Temp choices. Go below the one you have in now. The lower the temp the easier it is for the thermostat to open. If it is your head gasket this will relieve some of the pressure also until you get it fixed. Hope this helps!|`|AA10555331	thermo-stat  water-pump  head-gasket ? have the engine checked.

3MTYGEbWaa	Depends on the value of the car. Banks won't lend you more than the car is worth. Some banks don't like such small loans because the cars being financed for that amount are older cars with lots of mileage. If the borrower defaults and the car has to repossessed, they know it will be essentially junk by the time they get it back.

2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa	You trade your car in on the new one. If the remaining loan is more than the value of the car, and it almost certainly will be, the difference is tacked on to the new loan.    It is, in general, not a good idea. People throw away thousands and thousands of dollars in their lifetime by trading in cars every couple of years.    If you really have to have the new car, see if you can sell it privately for close to what you still owe on it, and make a straight deal for the new car.  This way, you know how much you are truly paying for it, and its cost is not muddied by the fictitious value of your old car.    By close, I mean within a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars. This means you have to come up with the balance to pay off the loan out of your own pocket.  But this is still better than the trade, because what the dealer tells you he's giving you and what he's really giving you are farther apart than that thousand or fifteen hundred. Trust me, the dealer makes money on both ends. On your trade, plus on the new vehicle.|`|1SnI86BIaa	why dont you ask the guy what he means  were not him, so how are we suppose to know what he means|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Call your loan company or bank and ask what you still owe. then go to kbb.com or nadaguides.com and find out how much your car is worth.     If you still owe more than your car is worth, you are upside down and have no equity to sell or trade with.    If you are not upside down, sell the car and pay off your loan. Then use the leftover money as a down payment on a new car.    Watch out for dealers who want to "help" you and give you advice.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Car salesmen come up with all sorts of ways to finance cars for you. You'll have to ask him for the details of what he was talking about.

cDnUkCyhaa	what oil are you running  If I recall it is a wet multi plate.. As such you should be using a synthetic or semi synthetic oil.   if you used ordinary oil the anti friction addatives in the oil will cause your clutch to slip.  get synthetic oil from a motorbike shop or ask at your stockist for oils suitable for wet clutch.|`|E0j6mhqhaa	My old ZN uses the same plates as yours.  I found my clutch slipping a bit or jumping and making funny noises when taking off on very steep inclines.  My first though was that it was the plates.  I changed oil to a synthetic/conventional mix.  It's Mystic and made for diesel tractors and can be found at lots of ag farm and home stores.  It has a "C" rating such as CD, CF or such, I can't recall at the moment.  C oils are for gas or diesel and S are gasoline only.  That was in 2007 and I've had no problems since, even with the same clutch plates.
0PogbNEVaa	Is the car fuel-injected or does it use a carburetor? It's probably fuel-injected, but if it isn't, try flooring the gas pedal once or twice before you try to start it. What this does is pumps gas to the engine, allowing it to start. Where are you from? It may be the temperature. I know where I am I have to pump the gas pedal once in the winter if it's been sitting there for 8 hours.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Sounds like the fuel pump failed.

The key thing for purchasing any home that was another type of building or used for another purpose previously is to make sure that there is no extensive damage to its infrastructure.

Eventually the towing company would offer it at auction in an attempt to get paid for towing and storage, assuming they were not able to contact the owner.
jERevyR8aa	that's base price  with like absolutely no extra's and the worst engine    plus that's probably the price after incentives and everything too.    so really they aren't that cheap
WvtHZSySaa	Yes. What happens is basically there is a clutch on the rotorshaft that, when it senses engine RPM dropping lower than rotor RPM, it disengages the rotor from the engine. This is much like the freewheeling hub in a bike (why the back wheel will continue to turn when you're not pedaling). When a helicopter pilot experiences a loss of engine power, he immediately drops the collective (a lever that changes the pitch of the rotor blades) to flatten them out more, then basically glides the machine down. Autorotation (what this procedure is called) relies on the flow of wind over the rotor blades to keep them spinning. How fast they spin depends on the descent rate and airspeed of the helicopter, so each helo has a set of guidelines for performing a safe autorotation. If you'd like to know more, PM me. :)|`|f883f94d3a771813d0e22175b7e5178caa	Helicopters can auto rotate to a safe landing, under certain conditions.  The helicopter has to have enough altitude to transition to auto rotation, and many require forward airspeed ( I was told this by a jet ranger pilot who was killed when his engine flamed out while hovering over a shooting scene) I remember he specifically stated that he needed either 30 or 60 knots @ 500 feet to make it down safely. Maybe I heard him wrong..but yes they can make it down safely if the pilot responds to the situation promptly.    Rotors rarely "fall" off..However, not many years ago a Bell 407..I think?, not far from where I live went down in the Gulf and killed all on board..the reason was that the rotor system failed and it threw a blade off.   The interesting thing is that the investigators said that the loss of a blade at that RPM would have resulted in G-forces that no one could have survived..they claimed that everyone was dead before the beast hit the water.     Take a blade off of your ceiling fan...turn it on high...then run! It will tear itself apart and probably some of your ceiling with it when it comes down.    Multiply those effects by a large number and you have a rotor system coming apart.    Jonathan S|`|JA2p5V06aa	Yes. (but not if the main rotor falls off. But this would be very unlikely)|`|3oK51Uflaa	doubtfull|`|W6GWXRx8aa	Yes    In the operation of helicopters and autogyros, autorotation is the name given to the generation of lift by the main rotor even though no power is being provided to the rotor by an engine. Autogyros have an un-powered main rotor so they rely continuously on autorotation as their source of lift. Following an engine failure, a helicopter may be able to slow its descent before landing and land in a controlled manner, using autorotation|`|AA10721549	when the rotor would fal off, the helicopter is just a free falling set of rare metal and composite material parts. the rotor is what keeps it in the air.    when the engine stops /engineS stop/ the helicopter autorotates to ground, which basically means it trades its height above terrain for maintaining the momentum of the blades.    when close to ground, the pilot pitches the nose up, RAISES collective and pushes the nose into the level position again, so that the helicopter would slow down (pitch up), reduce vertical speed and forward speed even more (collective up) and touches down in a safe attitude (nose level again).    if only the pilots flares like the airplanes, he needs a damn long flat meadow in front of him to slow down the forward speed.    if he does not return the nose into level, he would hit the ground with the tail boom first, braking away the tail rotor, rsulting in a crash.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Safely is relative, they land by auto rotation, the blades falling thru the air are forced to rotate, a slow crash.  Rotors do not fall off, if they are ripped off the copter falls like a rock.|`|yR75rXThaa	Yes, through a process called autorotation.    When the engine stops, the main rotor is unpowered but still spinning. The pilot lowers the control called the "collective" to start a descent and flatten the blades into the relative wind, allowing them to keep rotating as the helicopter goes down. As it goes down, the wind from the fast descent is what actually keeps the blades turning.    At the bottom, the pilot pulls back on the cyclic (think joystick) control and basically does a landing flare, trading forward velocity to stop the descent rate. If all goes well, it's a relatively gentle touchdown, with forward motion in most helicopters.
l80bH2TYaa	It sounds like a fuel issue. If it is that bad and you have been driving it that long like that, it is possible that when you change it, it won't be long before the pump goes.|`|AA10331789	Never tell the repair shop what to fix on your car if your not certain what's wrong with it. The best approach is to describe your problem to them and ask for their diagnosis of the problem and how to fix it. Then you can decide what to do from there, especially if you've also talked to other shops and experts. Your Ford dealer may be the best place to start to diagnose the problem. Then you can have your vehicle repaired anywhere you choose.|`|AOPuoo16aa	This doesn't sound like a alternator but it still might be. Take it to any auto parts store like checkers or auto zone or go to a shop like sears or goodyear and they will test it for free. If its not the alternator it is probably your fuel filter or pump.|`|1NWjta2jaa	it's rather easy to replace a fuel filter. If you don't know how to do it, ask a friend to help.

The law allows you to repossess the trailer but anything that what was not an original part of the trailer does not become your property if you repossess it.|`|BNlSh53faa	If you're a nice guy I'd return it or attempt it but if you get no response, dispose of it or sell it on ebay.
Lbulud8raa	I will be using, as close as possible, the Toyota model series numbers.  Actual model names vary between countries.    In most markets the structure is thus:  1.  RAV4.    2.  Prado (name varies)  3.  Landcruiser (currently the 200 series)  4.  Hilux (US: 4Runner) a large meduim duty commercial also     available in FWD and variously in part or full-time 4WD  6.  Landcruiser 70 series comercial off roads vehicles,   sometimes bought by private buyers  In the Americas only there is the Tundra, a large pick-up, and the FJ cruiser retro thing which is essentially a toy off roader.    The RAV4 is a small AWD crossover vehicle with no low range.  It was deliberately designed (initially as a concept in 1989 or 1990)to appeal to female drivers and is used as one would use a normal car with the idea that AWD provides a measure of extra safety over FWD and some ability to tackle towing and gravel roads.  It also was marketed as offereing superior vision, by virtue of the elevated seating position.    The Toyota Prado is a medium sized derivative of the Landcruiser, at least in design philosophy.  It occupies a similar position in the market to other medium duty 4x4's such as the Mitsubishi Monterey/Pajero and the Discovery 3  It is aimed at families and is moderately capable off road.  Often used for medium duty towing.  Not sold, so far as I know, in the US: the 4Runner occupies this place in the US market.    The Landcruiser 200 Series is a serious 4X4 and has prodigious off road ability.  Various models are aimed at tradesmen/commercial users, families and urban street poseurs.  Large at nearly 3000kg unladen, and thirsty in petrol V8 and the diesels are not that economical either (if very advanced and really excellent off-road and for cruising.) but they also offer great off road ability and are often used for towing as well.  Not sold in great numbers in the US.    Hilux.  In the US this is sold as a family "SUV" in the same manner as the Prado is elsewhere.  It is an older and more agricultural design, but sells well and it is reliable, resonably economical and the comfort is fair.  Off road it is okay in SUV form, but much better in commercial cab/tray or crew-cab and tray form.  The tray can be replaced with any number of add-ons onto the separate chassis.    Landcruiser 70 Series and so on.  Commercial in design and origin, hugely capable off road but with a spartan interior (the 70 series Wagon was the original world market Prado from the mid-90's so is a bit more comfortable).  Offered in cab-chassis, 11 seat Troopcarrier, and Wagon.  These are used all over the world, though VERY rare in the US as industrial vehicles and offer amongst the greatest reliability and durability in this role of anything else on the market.  The Hummer does not come close, neither does the Land Rover (though is used to fulfill this role before the Toyota product took over) and the Nissan Patrol is less economical and not allowed in some markets and is less flexible in design.    Tundra.  Large US style pick-up.  Pretty average really and designed to cope with the second rate Big Three offerings.    FJ: Urban poseur wheels, moderaley capable off-road, but few ever do.  Designed to allude to the famous FJ-40 series Landcruisers (spiritual predecessors of the current 200 Series) of the '70's, it is essentially a toy and designed for the image conscious Japanese and US markets.    Last word: there is also the Kluger, a car- like (well, less so in later models) design originally based on an AWD Camry plaftorm.  Yeah....crap really as there are better AWD's on the market that favour car-like design.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	yea, i know! its too much.    i'm a toyota fan, don't get me wrong, but its dumb how the majority of their vehicles are SUV'S, yet they claim to be one of the greenest auto maker...    plus, most of their suv's are crossover's. basically an suv, that isn't built to do what an SUV is originally made to do. so basically, useless.        4runner is pretty much theire toughest SUV. its does what SUV's were made to do...haul stuff, off roading, etc.    same with the FJ cruiser      the rest, highlander, rav4, venza, are only good for driving on road. personally, i think crossovers are dumb because they're only good for driving on road, and yet, you use more gas...    most people who have SUV's don't even need them, they just need to commute to work...that's why we have sedans people!!!|`|BNlSh53faa	Each purpose is   1.

IIa4efh5aa	The RX isn't priced at $75,000. The RX, like the Toyota Highlander, is based on the Toyota Camry platform and starts just over $37,000.    On the other hand, the LX, 570 which is an upmarket version of the Toyota Land Cruiser, does start at $75,705. But then, the Land Cruiser tops out at about $73,000. Infiniti's QX 56 is about $17,000 less, but other obvious competitor's, like the Land Rover HSE and Mercedes-Benz GL can easily run up to $18,000 more.    Figure that the LX has more interior room and better reliability than its competitors, and the price hardly seems unreasonable. Remember, the LX 570 is loaded with all sorts of high-tech equipment to make it pretty much unstoppable off road.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	It's just a glorified neon|`|Rb8vURwmaa	its a name brand car and alot of rich people are total  suckers. that car doesn't do anything other then take you from place to place, just like every other car on earth.|`|1NWjta2jaa	What makes a pair of socks worth $5?

fbxqLErlaa	I believe I qualify to answer your question since I used to own a 1968 Mustang GT.  I "used" to.  Stupid decision to sell my Mustang so many years ago.  Sigh.....  On to your question.  If I owned a Mustang I would equip said car with four Bridgestone Blizzaks on steel rims.  Tall narrow tires are the ticket in the snow.  In my opinion it helps if your car has a manual trans like my '68.  I never ran weight in my trunk.  And I drove through three very snowy winters during my time of ownership of my Mustang.  Back then I used regular radial tires in front and radial snow tires in the rear. Blizzaks are a superior tire.  Four Blizzaks offer you driving, braking, and handling traction.    I too would slide the car around a corner instead of doing the slow creep.  Every winter I find a LARGE vacant parking lot and get used to driving in the snow again.  hit the gas, hit the brakes, turn the steering wheel hard, do some donuts, and generally have some fun.  Just don't hit anything that does not belong to you.  Respect the owner's property.    I do find when I start out on my front wheel drive Saturn I need to turn off the traction control.  AT TIMES the traction kicks in at the wrong times.  Just a matter of knowing what your vehicle is capable of while coping with bad traction conditions.  I bought my Blizzaks from The Tire Rack in South Bend, IN.  Good Luck|`|M7G3MZb5aa	A mustang, in the snow is the same as any RWD  car in the snow.    They have a strong tendency to spin the tires because the back end has very little weight on it.  It doesn't matter what kind of car it is or how heavy it is, it only mater what percentage of the vehicles total weight is resting on the rear tires.    IDEALLY if your car was somehow able to put all of its weight on the rear wheels, it would not get stuck as often.  but this isn't possible because you have 4 wheels, and you need weight on the front two to steer the car.    In snow, you CAN increase the amount of weight in the back of the car and increase the percentage of total weight on the rear axle, it will increase traction ~slightly, however as you increase weight in the back of the vehicle your ability to steer is reduced, something you may wish to maintain in snowy conditions.    Another way to increase traction is by adding tires that grip snow better, tires that are "smooth" will offer less traction than say off-road tires that have huge teeth in them that can sink into snow.  Chains are another option, but they need to be removed before driving on pavement.    In the end, there not a lot you can do, the best way to handle it is to keep the car moving whenever possible, and learn to drift the car around corners to avoid getting stuck from driving too slow.    The best way to drive in snow is to have an awd/4wd car.  ALL CARS get stuck in snow easily if they are rwd, you just have to learn to deal with it, and find ways to avoid it and compensate for it.    In my experiecne as a delivery driver, i found that when making sharp low speed corners in snow, it was best to skid trhough the corner instead of trying to go through it slowly with the wheel cocked all the way to one side..  You rarely got stuck in this manor, but i dont recomend doind it unless you are confident you can controll the skid.
Wrf1e6nIaa	You can find out if it is the starter...here's how.  I am assuming it a standard. So if you get someone or something to push you while in your car and pop the clutch it should start. That's the awesome thing about standards is that there's 2 ways to start them.  If your car starts then its your starter. If it don't then your problem is elsewhere.  If its your starter they arent very hard to fix. Since its a  cylinder everything is pretty much easy to fix. And on the price. It just depends on where you buy it and what "grade" starter your get. Of course...the cheaper one is gonna be cheaper and not as efficient.|`|T9o9nVRsaa	some of these cars had a recall on the ignition switch. If you could send me your VIN   I can check it for you through GM. The switch terminals would get hot and melt causing a no start or hard start. I had one come in the dealership that was spinning over with no key in it.|`|Vi6As72caa	Sounds like the starter. Make sure you clean you battery cables to that could be the problem.Starters are pretty cheep $25.00 exchange|`|7d4U4F8Zaa	It could be is a bad battery, but I'm almost positive that it's the starter. The same thing happened to my 1994 Jeep Cherokee and for some reason if I tapped my starter with a hammer then my car would start, but that got annoying so I went to Auto Zone and got a new starter for about 80$. I had my friend help me put it in and now my car starts perfectly fine.     Hope this helped

uwRkw4vmaa	If all you want to do is level the ride height while you are pulling a trailer, the cheapest way is to install a set of air shocks.  You can add air when you need to pull the trailer, and then keep a good ride when you are not using the trailer by removing the air and returning the vehicle to the original height|`|d9ECb7N8aa	There were factory option available overload springs available for those trucks. They were a leaf spring (1/4 elliptical) attached to the frame and the spring 'eye' had a pad that contacted the axle as the suspension compressed.

I would bet that you cannot find one available for the 67-72, but you may be able to find one that works.    Air shocks. Simple to install. They replace the factory shocks, then you just use an air compressor to charge the shocks. You could also add a small onboard air compressor and controller unit (like other overload airbag kits) and control the air pressure in the shocks.    The air shocks would be the cheapest.|`|v8TWvtQgaa	All you need is new rear springs. 40 year old springs sag, they are weak. Replace them and the shocks and your good to go.

You are better off taking it to a mechanic if you have never done it before. You will need to remove the wheels on both side and remove the outer tie rod from the brake knuckle hub. You will need a hammer to band the tie rod end out of the knuckle hub. Then you may have to remove the tie rod end from the rack and pinion if you have one. After you do all this, you will have to do an alignment to make sure the car drives strait. I would replace the boots myself and then take the car to a good year to let them do the alignment. Good luck.

I have never heard of electrical problems with them and i used to own one also...and know of a few people that run them.    the only problems they are known for is the front end actuator (assuming it is four wheel drive).  they are known to go out.  However there is a product called Posi-Lock that replaces it with a cable activated system that is rock solid (about $150).      So they are good little rigs and i would recommend anyone that is looking at one to get one.|`|ZQdn9xMPaa	My man says they suck.

kgk3Yz9Naa	Hmmm,strange one...first job is to remove,split and thoroughly clean the carb,removing all jets and blow out..  check the read valve,make sure there sitting flat..its also possible that  one of your crank seals are on there way out.a 2 strokes bottom end around the crank is pressurised,..that could be pushing oil out the overflow.|`|u0PHhZOSaa	check your cable sometimes it get snagged on the T.O.R.S(throttle over ride system, that bulky thing on top of your carb with a black/yellow and white/black wires). while you on the carb just clean,  taking out all the jets. also convert your oil system to premix. all Yamaha blasters have oil failer sooner or later. if not take off the cover to expose the oil pump and there will be a Phillips head screw take that out and let oil out till there is no air bubbles then put it back clean it up to keep dirt from sticking and see if that works. still not  check the air filer and clean it and or replace it. let me know if this dose not work.

No such thing as a cheap helicopter license.  I looked into the cost of becoming a helicopter pilot about 12 years ago. Dual time was $175 per hour and solo time was $150 an hour.

I suspect the only way to be paid to learn is to join the military.

j8ZWJGAyaa	As others have mentioned, yes. This is called reverse thrust.    However, we hardly ever use reverse thrust to back up ( Obviously we use it after landing to release stress from the braking systems.) However planes with the engines mounted on the wing; You won't ever see them use reverse thrust to "back up" because of FOD. ( Foreign Object Damage)    However, planes such as the DC-9 and MD-80, you will see more commonly use reverse thrust to "Back up" from the gate, because the chance of FOD is lower.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	Reverse thrust. It is used to slow the aircraft down after landing.     It could move the aircraft in reverse if it is sitting still  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJiNbqudO...    There are 2 (or 4, depending on how many engines the aircraft has) levers in front of the throttle. When the pilot lifts them up and pulls them back, it allows the throttle to move back past idle. http://www.geocities.com/ps1ipc/744-10s....|`|1b037047daa5a242ff98379ffe8e03e1aa	Most airliners, jet or turboprob, do have the ability to reverse the direction of their thrust. It's not a "gear" per se, it's just some mechanical means of reversing the direction of some or all of the air used for propulsion. Turbojet/turbofan engines use a device that extends down into the exhaust of the engine and redirect some portion of the air forwards, reversing the thrust. Turboprops reverse the angle of the propeller blades, blowing air forwards instead of backwards.    This is used primarily as a means to slow the airplane down after landing, however, and not as a way to back up. Reversing the thrust of engines at the gate blows debris, equipment and people around, and debris blown in front of the engine can easily be sucked back into the engine, damaging the engine itself. When the airplane is moving forwards, the reversed air gets blown backwards before it has a chance to reach the engine intake, reducing the chance of ingesting debris. Each airplane has a certain speed below which the pilots are not supposed to use the reverse thrust.|`|WaI693jHaa	Aeroplanes don't have gears.  They can reverse thrust but on the ground they are towed.|`|Hf4VImrQaa	You mean reserve thrust right ? In that case the answer yes.

Yq2CUhtYaa	It doesn't reset itself.    You seem to totally misunderstand what a check engine light is.    It is your engine calling 911 to you. There is something that immediately needs to be addressed. Sure, it might be the gas cap. It also might be a set of bad sensors, that are destroying your engine. Could be that your fuel sender is bad, which would tie in with it going away when you fill up. This is a problem, because if your fuel system shuts off, so does the car. While you're driving.    Currently, you're ignoring the 911 call. Good job. Way to be a responsible car owner.    Take it in, have the code read, and find out what is actually wrong with it.|`|d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	The check engine light is your car telling you that there is something wrong with your car.    If you are no longer under warranty, then I'd suggest going to a local Autozone or similar auto parts store to have the OBD-II error codes read.  (Such stores will read the codes for free, in the hope that perhaps you'll use them to buy the parts to fix the problem.)  Once you know what the problem is, you can fix it.  The error code could be for something simple like your gas cap wasn't seated properly, or it could be a warning that your engine or transmission is about to die if you keep driving on it...  If something simple, you can also have the stored codes deleted (thereby turning off the check engine light).  Drive around a bit with the light off, and if the problem comes back, it'll relight the check engine light, if not, you're ok.    Driving around is not what resets the check engine light...  Some cars, if a transient and not major problem, after 3-4 restarts and the problem doesn't reoccur the light will go out on its own.    Note that if you have the codes deleted, or you decide to disconnect the 12v battery for a few minutes to clear the codes, that the car's computer(s) will note that the computers are not ready.  You usually need to drive around for another 200 miles or so before the car will be ready again.  This is important to know if you are just trying to get rid of the light for a state safety/emissions test.|`|24541693b589663f9aa05a45cbaed171aa	You probably have to take it to a mechanic and have it reset, or use my method:  Put electrical tape over it.

AA12265870	Depending on how the house was wired,matters which wire(black or white)is power or ground.Usually the power is sent directly to the light and the switch controls the ground.The bare wire or green wire grounds the switch,light or outlet to the main fuse box.  With a volt-meter,take the light fixture out,set the meter to 400 ac,check the black wire for voltage with the red lead and connect the black lead to the round hole in a wall outlet to get your ground.If no voltage,try the white wire for voltage.If still no voltage,I think your light doesn't work on the same power circuit you think works with other things in the house.  If you don't have access to a volt-meter,go to Home Depot or any hardware store and they have a small test light with two wires that usually handles up to 600 volts.Ask if they have some type of extentions you could add to reach the long distance between the light fixture and the wall outlet.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	well theres the fuse box fuse switch and the outlet and wall switch only thing left is wiring|`|ptgng2RFaa	check the fuse man,,    did you check all the fuse's are working;;

yGf4eB6laa	95 percent of the freight trains in the US don't have schedules. They may have a certain departure day, and even a certain hour they leave from a home terminal. But as for when they pass through particular cities is never scheduled. This is because there are so many variables, that no one could ever predict such information.    I often work a "Local Freight" that leaves on Monday morning - or is at least supposed to. It should - not always - return on Tuesday. Sometimes there's other trains that must get going before us.

Some taillights are easy to replace, others can be a bit more difficult, but most can be done easily. Local parts stores or online stores can give you prices for the actual taillight, and also most likely tell you how hard it would be to change (in a store at least). For taking it in and getting it fixed, would be best to call local shops in your area and ask around.

4qurIEtpaa	I'm 16 and my first car i have right now is a 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS. I love the car and i get looks everywhere i go. Though it is not that fast of a car...i just installed a short ram intake and a cat-back exhaust...I'm soon getting a header installed. If you want to get the newer Eclipse get the gt... that thing will rip out from the start with its v6 engine.    I have not had any problems with my car. I did buy it with 100,000 thousand miles and its doing great.    Get the eclipse. i think the 1997-1999 looks the best and so do most other people.  People spread rumors about a lot of cars...its just their personal opinion.    Be sure to get it stock though.  -------------------  Edit: The Mitsubishi Eclipse GST/GSX are their fastest models. 210 hp. and you can easily make them faster with upgrades such as:  -Blow off valve  -Ecu chip  -Exhaust  -Bigger turbo  -Boost controller  ------------------  Overall, i have had great experience with my 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse.  Be sure to get a good one though. Take your time, that's what i did.|`|ueoRp9mlaa	hey im 17 and i have a gs 2000 mitsubishi eclipse.. its my third car but my first fast one.. i just bought it a little while ago but so far its pretty amazing.. and id have to say fast too.. going 95 mph only puts me at about 4500 rpm and red line isnt till 6500 i think so i could go faster im sure.. mine has a cold air intake and a 3 inch magnaflow installed so that helps to though.. as for looks i do like the 99 style but thhe interior in the 3rd generation is in my eyes really awesome!! it feels like your sitting in a cockpit in an jet.. hope this helps!

But you said you're not ready for that.  For right now just look into working on the suspension and making it a fun car to drive.    To calculate the horsepower you need to put it on a Dyno.

KRDF9A6Uaa	Jackpot!!! This is a great first car. They're easy to modify and are pretty quick and nimble to. My uncle owns a 1993 Honda Civic and has 203,000 miles on it just goes to show how reliable Honda's are lol. You shouldn't find any problems with these car just minor stuff like oil changing but they're pretty low maintence for the most part. As for MPG you'll love these: 38 MPG in the city, 43 MPG on highway! Thats crazy compared to other cars. All in all it's a great car with little maintence and great MPG. But I should warn you the Civic is very popular among thieves so make sure to buy an alarm, that lock for the steering wheel and if you have the money a LoJack locator so if you do get it stolen it's easily found buy local authoritys but just if you live in a high theft crime level area. But for now enjoy that car!!!|`|txoXobsAaa	get a 92 acura vigor. very cheap, last foreever, good on gas, lot more class than civic|`|S9QyF6NQaa	these little things are great on gas and run like tanks, great first car, just keep up on maintenance
f349a8a84f3da84a716aa0eb53c91af1aa	The valet switch is going to be a button that can be pushed in to program the remote. It should be located off of the brain of the actual alarm itself. However, since it is only required for programming purposes, it's possible that whoever did the installation removed the valet switch after the initial programming.
Lx62wmV5aa	leasing or buying will not help you to get out from under that corolla, you will owe more than the corolla is worth so if you want to role that negative equity into the new loan it will increase your payment and make it alot more difficult to get financed.     Leasing is basically renting the car, most people will tell you its a terrible idea because you dont own the car, but if you buy a car with a loan you dont own that either, not until the ENTIRE loan is paid off. Generally speaking leasing will get you a lower payment, and you do have the option of buying the car at the end of the lease.     Two things to be sure of when leasing, be absolutely positive you will want to keep the car for the entire time of the lease, theres nothing worse than trying to turn a lease in early. The other thing is miles, again be absolutely sure you do not drive more miles than you lease allows, figure out how many miles you drive a year then increase that by 15%. Over miles charges will cost you a bundle when you go to turn that lease in.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Leasing is great for some people (like me) and terrible for others. The important thing is to understand how leasing works so that you can figure out if it's right for you. Here's a web site that might help:  http://www.leaseguide.com/lease01.htm    If you drive less than about 15K miles per year, like having a new car every 3-4 years that is always under warranty, and take good care of your cars, then leasing might work for you. Otherwise, don't do it.|`|txoXobsAaa	its depends on ones finances. for some people its better to lease and for others its better to buy|`|fRRESP1maa	I'd say the best thing to do is to buy a car and finance it directly with the company/dealer.  Leasing is horrible, just like signing a lease for an apartment/home.
AA10080206	They no longer "hide" it on the trunk hinge.  Check the side of the fuse box located at the top of the brake pedal.  You will need to be a contortionist to see it (try using a lot of light and some mirrors) OR call your local dealer and see if they will be so kind as to pull it up for you.  You will need to bring the car in, and it takes about 5 minutes.  (Some dealers do try to charge for this)    Oh, and you are looking for a 5 digit code.    Good luck!|`|c28925a42319d47558b135bd8dc66e6daa	if its not on a card in the owners portfolio, you have to bring it in for the dealer to retrieve it from the on board computer.

When people leave a car turned off for as long as you have, there are things that can still drain the battery somewhat. You said that the car did not start after a 20 minute jump, then it didn'tt start with a new battery. My next question is, did it turn over? If it did, that would lead to another group of questions.

It could be that the contact point have oxidized from sitting for a while. Have you tried jumping it with the help of AAA?

mAZi1eH7aa	It is either not placed on correctly in the first place or you have a weak tensioner. That would allow slippage. My old Dakota did that when the tensioner got weak.

I'd use something like a plumb bob or a straight edge to measure the others if possible to see which one isn't square and is driving the crank to pitch towards the fan.

Its almost the only thing possible that can be the problem if your belt was working properly before this incident.

97p19rjxaa	There are a couple of civilian schools that use turbine helicopters exclusively.  http://heloflights.com/  http://www.fh1100.com/flightschool.html  I don't have any personal knowledge of these schools, so I can't say whether they are any good or not.    Bell Helicopters is another option if you are really willing to shell out some bucks (I think it's something like $1600 per hour or more). You do not need to be an A&P before. That's for a maintenance course, not initial pilot training. In addition to transition or maintenance training, Bell does do initial training for pilot certificates as well. The price is truly extreme, but you can't beat the quality of the training.   http://www.bellhelicopter.com/en/trainin...    You need to decide if doing your primary training in turbine aircraft is truly worth it. With a commercial certificate and 150 hours of turbine time, you still won't meet the minimum total times required by offshore operators, for example. Many require 1000 hours total time or more, and for the extra cost of turbine training, you could buy many more hours of time in a 300 CBi. It's totally up to you, just do your homework and plan it out ahead of time.    Good luck!    Also try these guys:  http://www.marpataviation.com/index.html|`|0Th3lvynaa	If your looking for a Helicopter School in the United States check out:  http://www.helicopterschoollist.com|`|AA12353364	I can think of one , Fort Rucker Alabama , US army|`|KChL10Yqaa	I would get a hold of bell helicopter in texas there classes are any where from 1 to 2 weeks and are well fairly expensive but they give you a ticket that is respected by any employer,  provided your a A&P licensed Tech.
97p19rjxaa	There are some traffic watch operations that charge you some amount to fly with them. It's an inexpensive way for a low time pilot to build turbine time. The downside is that you are simply holding the stick in straight and level flight. You are also paying for the time, whereas if you were instructing to build time they would pay you. I forget exactly which companies offer this traffic watch opportunity, but I think these two are among others that do.  http://www.commanderchuck.com/  http://www.rotoraviation.com/training.ht...    Another option is to work as a second in command during fire fighting season. The advantage is that you get paid for turbine time. You can also get your foot in the door in this specific field of helicopter operations. The downside is that you are logging SIC time, and you will be the proverbial "sandbag", where you don't really get on the controls very much. Here is one of the companies that has this option.  http://www.croman.net/2005/index.htm    When considering these options, you want to think about how your resume will look after you have your first 1000 hours. 1000 hours of "sandbag" time where you hardly fly at all might not be as good as the traditional path of 1000 hours of instructing/photo flights/powerline patrol. On the other hand, 1000 hours of turbine is better than 1000 hours of piston experience. It's all about tradeoffs, so I again advise you to plan your career path carefully ahead of time. Having a broader mix of experiences might be valuable as well. Do some instructing in piston aircraft and then do a fire season at Croman, for example.    I also recommend searching or participating in helicopter pilot forums, where you will be able to get information from many more pilots. Check out these discussions about building time or gaining turbine experience as examples.  http://helicopterforum.verticalreference...  http://www.justhelicopters.com/topics/de...

But here's my take on your problem, the condensation is coming in from a crack in the casing.  The bulb can be repaired and fixed.  What I would do is replace the headlight casing.  I bought several new ones from an after market vendor and it solved my problems.

dVQdswtTaa	Hopefully it's only a case of oil being poured into the wrong place,     It is possible to have a small head gasket leak or cracked block, with no sign of antifreeze in the oil. If that's it, it will soon get worse.     A combustion gas test on the cooling system will tell you if there's a leak.     If there is an engine oil cooler on the truck, the heat exchanger may be leaking internally. Oil pressure is higher than coolant pressure when the engine is running, so a small leak is possible.|`|c751fbc25b64e2d55123a16ac0df41b8aa	someone filled the wrong reservoir with oil    Just a thought  Lent your car to anyone not familiar with the model - recently|`|BNlSh53faa	crack in the block or head|`|M7G3MZb5aa	your head gasket seal not only the combustions chamber, but also coolant flow and oil flow sometimes.

I7NkFJo2aa	Why are you an idiot because you haven't learnt something - yet?  We are all idiots then because there are lots of things to learn in the world, and none of us know everything.    I think you are smart, because you know you need to find out how to do this properly.    Why not start with sailing clubs?  You will find lots of people only too happy to teach and often looking for crew.  There are all sorts and levels of clubs, so you will find one that is comfortable and suits your ideals.    A club will expose you to a great range of boats and sailors.    Have fun:)|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Aren't there any sailing schools around where you can do a short course on the schools' boats, gain your basic Certificates and take it from there if you decide you enjoy it.  Husband and I did a couple of short courses in England, with the Royal Yachting Association, after which he decided it wasn't for him.  So we lost nothing, had our yachting qualifications and then turned to canal boats on which he felt more at ease.|`|VhhEz92Oaa	Matt, you are not an idiot at all.  You would be if you bought a 60' schooner right out of the gate, but you won't.    I would imagine that you are going to love it.  I would start by reading every single thing you can find online or in books or both about sailboats.    Learn the names of all the parts and the proper terminology.  Learn the different rigs or types of sailboats.  Read until you understand what makes a sailboat work and how to sail it.  Read, read, read.    If you are confident in your ability to self teach, then buy a used dinghy in the 14' range.  Buy one in good shape so that you don't have to work on it for weeks just to go sailing.  Chances are, you will either want a bigger one later or a faster one.  Buying a used one at the right price will save you some cash if you decide to sell it in a year or two.  If you teach yourself in a dinghy and want to move up to a larger boat, take actual lessons at an ASA or U.S. Sailing certified school.    If you don't feel confident in your ability to read and understand technical subjects, then after you've read everything you can get your hands on, look online for ASA or U.S. Sailing certified schools that will teach you how to sail.  You don't have to learn in a small craft, but they are a ton of fun.  Bigger boats are fun in their own way and everyone should have at least one of each. :)    If you aren't totally sure you want to get in that deep in the beginning, then find your way to a place that teaches sailing in small boats and take a few lessons.  That will give you a feel as to what you might want to purchase without actually spending much money up front.    Good luck!  You're in for a long love affair with the wind.

G0Hir3Ewaa	Your factory stereo was a "Double DIN" or "DIN and a half" sized head unit. Your new one is a "single DIN", or just DIN size head unit. If you go to Walmart and look for a conversion kit for your year, make, and model your new head unit should fit in your dash like it was installed at the factory. They also sell a wire harness adapter that you splice into the new head unit that will just plug into the factory plug in the car so you won't have to splice the wires directly into the factory wiring. This retains the factory wiring in case you sell the car and want to re-install the original head unit. Good luck.|`|hegEhdMhaa	Ive done this a buncha times.

213f725a793437432aac3cd6e080d27caa	With a car that's 9 years old, the mileage is not as big of a factor as how well the previous owners took care of the car. With out actually inspecting both cars, it's impossible to really give you and sound advice. I would suggest bringing someone along who knows about cars to look them over. Don't let miles scare you because a well maintained car with 120k miles is a much better buy than a 70k mile car that has not been taken care of.

Just my opinion. But a head gasket is not an easy fix. It cost me a weekend, hard labor and 200 bucks to fix mine in my cavalier. And I was lucky it was just a head gasket. Usually all the seals need to be replaced and thats hoping it never over headed. Cause if it did then that can cause a warped head. Which if your lucky would be just to get the head shaved. But if not usually its a cracked head. Then you would have to replace the engine. Isnt worth the headache. But you could get a garage to do it. Head gasket up to 1000 bucks. New motor anywhere from 1200 3500 bucks.

q5gt3vzVaa	As long as the child seat is fitted correctly there is no law saying that a child can not sit in the front, On most car seats though it does state that if a passenger air bag is fitted then they are not to be used in the front.|`|W0b2oqZvaa	no that is very dangerous!!!!|`|9c9a473d5a6cb2d9eca28584f55aa068aa	No. Especially if there is no airbag.

In the back in a, car booster seat if necessary!!|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well I was going to give you the American rules for children being in the front seat, but I will just give you the rule that makes sense.  First of all, no matter where you are or what province it is not a good idea to put a child especially a 4 year old in the front seat.  Having no air bags is major reason why this is not a good idea.  Even if the car had airbags it still wouldn't be proper or practical.  The reason why is because if you were to have a head on collision with another vehicle, the child would likely be killed or seriously injured.  The main concern is the weight of the child.  At the age of 4 a child usually weighs no more than 40-50 pounds.  That weight is not enough to sustain damage and still be ok after the crash.  Now I know this isn't relevant to you but the law  in America stats that a child must be 12 and older to sit in the front seat of a vehicle and weight more than 90 pounds.  So I would advise you not to put your child in the front seat.  You are endangering their life.  Wait until they have grown, gained weight and matured.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	The back middle seat is the safest. A child normally had to be 4 feet 9 inches tall and weigh I think 50 pounds to not be in a booster seat. As far as a front seat, I think around the age of 12 or when they are tall enough to seat in the front seat with an air bag that won't suffocate a child.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	It is illegal in most states. As far as safety goes, you might as well strap them to the bumper. The rear seat is much, much safer.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	the safest place for a child in a car seat in most cars is the centre back seat. If they're using a booster seat and lap belt it is less so.  The next best place are the rear seats, with the front being least favourable, especially if there is someone or something heavy behind them.     If you have a smaller child in a rear facing seat you have to disengage the airbag, otherwise I think it's ok but we have ours disengaged anyway.|`|ky3B42f6aa	NO!    Anyway, isn't it against the law in the UK?  It sure is  in Scandinavian countries.  There are however, backward  facing seats for children that you can have in the front--  if the airbag has been removed or disabled.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	Same rules as Canada. That would be never.|`|9af678uKaa	not if the front seat has an air bag|`|AA11029380	They are safer in the back seat.

I didn't see England...anyway, it's the law in the states.|`|6uRWoIjJaa	The law says they have to sit in the back on a car seat until they are a certain height. Do not allow them to sit in the front if it has front or side airbags due to danger of child being compressed (internal injuries could happen) if you have an accident. The back seat is the most safest place for them to be.

There is a "flange way" on the inside of the rails so the equipment can run on them, just as with a grade crossing.<br>  <br>  Unless from above looking down, you won't see the track, since the top of the rail is level with the ground.

tPwdhcXyaa	I would seriously recommend a yamaha ttr 230 or a honda crf 230f...both are excellent bikes...the honda is a little more expensive...Great bikes for trial riding and small motocross...can be upgraded for more power as you get more experienced...I had a friend whose never ridden and this is the bike he started on....He's done well and because of the 230's wide capacity,  it is geared just right for the power you need... I do not recommend anything smaller for it may lack the power you need... A 250cc may be too powerfull for learning...hope this helps ....let me know.
2bqmotqlaa	i think its going to be a new 125cc racing four stroke  either that or the 150f four stroke|`|u0PHhZOSaa	prob 125cc/mini class.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I doubt that you will see a 4 stroke replacement for the 50 or 65 anytime soon. As a matter of fact the 150R has not replaced the 85. I see very few 150R's at the races. Everyone, at least in the US, is still on an 85. The last I heard the AMA still isn't allowing 150's in the 85 stock class. That may have been updated in the last year though.
XH4O3ozFaa	Your speakers already have an amplifier so you need an adapter to shut off before installing speakers with wrong ohm's.|`|De6ZxdMMaa	you will probably have to buy a wiring kit the power wire sounds like it is important check out crutchfield they can help
H8XpaaPDaa	yes you can use it|`|l80bH2TYaa	Of course you can use this same amplifier. The only time you cannot use this amp is if you are playing a bass.|`|Pd1QSnzUaa	If you are just playing around your amp will be just fine.  They do make special acoustic amps which are designed to enhance the sound based on what the acoustic/electric guitar feeds into the amp, but you should really save your money for something else.
AA10331789	Make sure to buy a new gasket or O ring and make sure the thermostat is the right one for your car.

fbxqLErlaa	I wear prescription eye glasses and always wear a full face helmet.  I learned the importance of a padded, armored jacket when I went down after hitting a dog.  Ended up with a sore shoulder and forearm.  Had zero road rash on my upper body.  Jeans are not enough protection.  Only road rash was on my knee.  Had I been wearing my riding pants, I would have just been sore.  Soreness went away in a couple of days.    So I recommend a padded, armored textile riding jacket.    I would also recommend armored riding pants.  For warm weather, look at the Joe Rocket Phoenix mesh textile pants.  The toes of my boots were all abraded during the course of the accident.  I never felt a thing due to the steel toes built into the boots.    Good rain gear is a necessity.  For cold weather riding I use Gerbing heated riding gear.  Very pricey, but allows me to ride in comfort when the temps go below 50 degrees F.  My bike has plenty of electrical power for the gear.  Check out New Enough for a good selection of riding gear.  Good people to deal with.  Good Luck|`|D7zcNRB2aa	Leathers are the best bet. Or at least riding pants. As a first time rider, you should prepare for a crash, because we all fall eventually. Wearing the right gear will really help you out in the long run. I would NEVER ride a motorcycle to work and commute without proper gear, in fact many people crash the worst during commuting, as it is very dangerous.    I would vote for a full-faced helmet, the glasses work fine and the safety that the helmet offers is worth it.|`|0Wvyh3EBaa	You pretty much nailed the question. consider a rainsuit too. you never know when rain will hit you.  when you buy a jacket buy a summer mesh padded jacket and a heavier leather or other type of jacket to match riding temp.  With glasses you should see if you can get a pair of perscription riding goggles. I enjoy a full helmet for safty but you may be better off with 3/4. Also a heavy set of gloves and a light set would be recommended.  You should be OK with your dress pants, but buy some of those shoe to pant clips that keep your pants from riding up in the wind.|`|1cc0530fb7fd6e139f507fa33c7d10f1aa	Get an armoured jacket and trousers, most people go for man-made nowadays. It's much easier to look after than leather and the armoured stuff gives good protection. Decent gloves and boots are a must; you may be on a short commute but sooner or later you are going to be interfacing intimately with the tarmac. A one-piece waterproof oversuit is a good idea, if you live somewhere it rains!  A full-face helmet should be OK with glasses, remember to wear the glasses when you're trying on helmets.|`|2FT7sVkbaa	It depends what kind of bike you ride|`|7I0Do9hkaa	a 3/4 helmet will leave your chin/nose unprotected  it will only give you ~60% of the possible protection  with glasses a flip/modular are a good choice  boots  full fingered gloves  pants + jacket from abraison resistant material and outfitted with impact absorbant pads  chaps will not protect you well in case of a mishap or simple inclement weather, get 'overpants' that have full length zippers on both legs for easy on/off with boots  if jacket + pants are not waterproof, get raingear    take an MSF class, if it only saves you from one low impact drop you saved more than the class costs|`|FeivZKiaaa	Minimum requirements: A DOT approved helmet, gloves, over the ankle boots, heavy jeans & a heavy denim or leather jacket.   That will get you started. Then after you get a bike you can go hog wild.   Be sure to take the Harley Davidson Riders Edge class for beginners.
AA10331789	So go back and replace the filter with the proper part. Then you'll know that's not the problem.|`|l80bH2TYaa	Do you have it on with the flow going the right way? Is it leaking?|`|DwBNz5kVaa	Sounds like gas is leaking somewhere hence the smell and since it's leaking your not getting the full flow of gas hence the rough running engine. Replace the fuel filter with either a factory or aftermarket one made specifically for your VW and you should be alright.  To answer your original question the fuel filter's purpose is similar to the oil filter. Takes out any dirt and irregularities out of the fuel before it is burned.
LeLZ4sOPaa	Depending on the year I would advertise it for parting out.  Junkyards will give you nothing.     Having owned and owning a passat I know how much parts can be.  You should be able to make some money from this.|`|IsGo50kqaa	Junk yards don't buy anymore - if you are really lucky, they will tow it for free.  Otherwise, perhaps $100 - they are rare so I'd do some research - if parts are hard to find, someone mighr be willing to pay more for parts but you'd have to advertise and that (depending on the medium) can be expensive.  Best bet would be free advertisement newspapers and the net.|`|5a09c753c4ebf1de1049487c3d4375bbaa	If the car runs well someone will DEFINITELY buy it from you for a LOT more than you would get from a junkyard! Most junkyards that I know of that even pay for cars, wont pay more than $50 or $100...  If I were you I would check out the VWVortex, sign yourself up on the forums there, and post something in your local regional forum first, you might be able to sell to some local enthusiasts, or if not try the passat classifieds on there!   If you need any help with the forums send me a PM on there, my username on the vortex is urochik.    Good luck!
8ovTppsAaa	Unfortunately,yes.    Including a hazard perception test.

Make sure you specify the bike theory test when booking up.|`|tI7Ovsq5aa	You would have to do the motorcycle theory test. You can buy a dvd with the theory test and hazard perception test practise on it. The hazard perception test is a load of nonsense as experienced drivers we are used to seeing the hazard very early (most of us) and I found I was clicking too early according to the software. how can seeing a potential hazard too early be a problem?? All the best in your future training and riding.
Yq2CUhtYaa	And take both of those horsepower ratings, and toss them out the window.    1. That's horsepower at the engine. What you'll make at the wheels will be a good 15% less than that. So comparing the two that way, is pointless.    2. You want torque. You can have tons of horsepower, but with no torque, the car won't be quick. So, find out the torque ratings, and use that to compare.
A82EKf2Waa	I had similar problems last month and was glad I got my repairs covered under my extended warranty. extended warranties are if you buy them aftermarket. http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-Wa...
Amkmles0aa	try buying a book  try this      http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oGkmkryIRJvU...|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Could be a number of things. First thing to check is the level of transmission fluid you have. It is possible that when you initially start out that the transmission fluid has all drained to the bottom so it takes a while for it to get circulating. You must let your car run for several minutes...and check the fluid levels while it is running to get an accurate reading. If it is low on fluid and the jerking stops after you fill it back up to where it should be, you need to keep an eye on the levels as it means you are losing fluid somewhere. Prabably a seal or gasket somewhere in the transmission. Depending on the severity, this is an easy fix in most cases. If you let it run dry though, you stand to damage the transmission to the point where only replacement will work..and that gets very pricey.|`|JoAfcy4Caa	BOO|`|5ktSlNodaa	Muffler bearings or headlight fluid.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	When the last time it had a tune up?|`|H8XpaaPDaa	if the weather is cold, and you haven't changed your transmission fluid on time, then, that's probably your problem.       if you don't change your transmission fluid, it won't move properly in cold weather. if you let this go for longer, you will damage the transmission and you will have to rebuild it, which will cost you a lot!      you can check by smelling and looking at the fluid. if its dark red and smells burnt, then that means its time to change the fluid.     bring it into a mechanic so they can properly diagnose it.|`|F7jr9o8Kaa	fgfg|`|D7zcNRB2aa	Hopefully it's something as easy as changing your transmission fluid.    Also, colder temperatures can make the car drive a little odd too. When was the last time you had the transmission serviced? May want to check the manual and see when the services are due, and consider your driving conditions.|`|QOU5DtFGaa	Um i dunno|`|0GCf06JHaa	Sounds like a transmission problem.  Have you noticed any pinkish (brownish) fluid where you normally park.  Have you tried checking the transmission fluid level - by the way, you need to have the car running to do this?  If it's leaking you may only have to replace a gasket or possibly a missing bolt in the tranny pan.  Either way, better to get it checked out sooner, rather than later, which will almost assure you a 2400 dollar repair bill.|`|AA10761300	Have your transmission fluid flushed out and replaced, it's probably just old trans fluid that needs to be replaced.|`|CLj953FTaa	depending on the miles in the car it might be that it needs transmission fluid. it might be low or in need of a full flush, have somebody change the transmission fluid and filter. inspect the oil and the filter and if you find metal particles or you touch the oil and feels like sandy then you are in for a transmissionn overhaull.|`|03100a8ed4ae6b8c323f7a5642c64792aa	Chevrolet has some bad solenoids that were used in their front wheel drive transmissions.  What you are describing is what is called a hard shift.  Chevrolet has a service bulletin on this, but they will give you a smokescreen and say that it could be debris like a piece of sand that got into the solenoid.  This solenoid does not operate correctly and after the car gets warm will cause the hard shift.  It is aggravating.  I have a Chevrolet impala and it is doing this trick also.  If you go to AAMCO, they will tell you that the transmission is going out and that they need to do an internal inspection and that you will destroy the transmission if you keep driving it.  That is what they told me and here I am months later still driving it.  If you can stand the hard shift try to ignore it that is what I am doing, and if it eventually goes out I will have it overhauled then, not now though as it it still doing well.

SaUlzfsuaa	the best v8 for you would be to dump your gm crap and get into a new diesel or gasser super duty ford.|`|c48nm70gaa	Forget Ford Forever. Gas hogger's all.   There two types of Chevrolet fans. The ones who are and others who wish they were.   Look inside the GM High Performance Catalog  and select one of several 350's or 383's with a 2 year 50,000 mile full GM warranty.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	The best deal you can get for a long block 350 is the Goodwrench engine. Its not a high-performance engine, but its warrantied and its a solid foundation for any further modifications you want to do to it. Scoggin Dickey is a good place to look, but you can get them practically anywhere.     Jasper or Recon are also two outfits that sell decently priced rebuilt stuff.|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Try the local wrecking and salvage yards. But let me warn you, you are going to run into problems making the change over if you try to shoe string budget it.  Some of the things you are going to run into changing over to a V-8.  leakage will have to be changed:  Motor mounts not matching up with A frame. Might have to change A frame:  Front suspension to light for added weight of the V-8  Bolt hole patterns on bell housing not lining up.  Those are just a few of the problems you are likely to run into:  A lot of fun to play around with if you have the place and tools to do it. We used to shoe horn 454's into Chevy Novas and Ford Falcons. Made a lot of money dragging Vette owners. Well say a lot mostly come close to breaking even.   You might be better off just buying a rebuilt straight 6 like the one in it.  I know Advantage Auto Parts carries a complete engine with unlimited mileage warranty.  The one I bought from them came complete with plugs and even had the oil in it and oil filter on it.   ABC also carriers a good rebuilt engine with 3 year 36,000 mile warranty. Those are the ones I use when I get roped into changing an engine for someone.   NAPA also carriers a good rebuilt engine.|`|8AQw9xqBaa	I like 6's myself but I know most people dont.  Since the V8's were an option all the parts exist to do the swap.  There are a lot of little pain in the butt items where various lines are and wires that end up eating up a lot of time and money.  Often times the 6 radiators were smaller and had different hose sizes and locations.  Easiest thing to do would be to find a complete truck from the same body style with a small block V8 (305,350,400) so you could take what you needed from it.  87 was the last year for that body style.  87's had EFI which I personally like.  The other early 80s started having some computer emissions stuff that can be a pain to start messing with.    Check out someplace like LMC truck and see if they have all the mounts and such you would need, they may even have a kit.   Most of the V8's kits I have seen are to go from the 4.3V6 which was just a stubby v8 so most of the brackets are the same.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	The best deal would be a  complete engine from GMPP.  Contact Summit for a lot of choices of engines at summit.com.  There are good brand new, not rebuilt available for under $2000.  It couldn't be any easier to swap.  You will need a pair of V8 motor mounts and an exhaust system.  All the rest will interchange fine.  No problems with k-frame, radiator, transmission (manual or auto the hardware bolts up), or anything.  The 6 is so heavy the V8 is actually a little lighter so no front-end work is needed.  You may need to tweak the throttle linkage to make it work but everything else will work.
AA12261615	have the computer scanned to see if it will give off any trouble codes, that would be the first thing id do,then it might give you a trouble code for whats causing that too happen,good luck.|`|skfHV92caa	I would do as Mike is suggesting, but I would also check the transmission fluid.  Make sure it is at proper level.  Do you have a check engine light on?  Possible that a transmission speed sensor has gone bad and causes car not to shift.  Hope this helps.|`|vmNHuAKjaa	i would try a tune up and fuel filter hope it helps
SaUlzfsuaa	Get an f350 way cooler than any gm piece of poop.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	An x pipe would be slightly better than h pipe.  You probably would want series 40 Flowmasters and take the truck to a custom exhaust shop.  Let them do it in stainless.  Be sure to have long tube headers installed first.
g6easyBFaa	It sounds like you got completely hosed by this mechanic.    First, *if* the car truly overheated then replacing the gauge won't fix the problem.  It's just there to let you know what the temperatures are.    Second, the gauge was likely Ok, but the temperature sensor may have gone or there was a problem with the wiring harness to that sensor.  Either one is a 15 minutes fix.    Third, as another poster mentioned, did you see where the leak was from?  It could have been a loose hose clamp.  And if the car was overheating the leak could have been from the overflow bottle beside the rad.    As to replacing the radiator...yes, maybe that was required.  You don't mention what its condition was.  It could very likely have also been the thermostat.  That's a $10 part with a 5 - 10 minutes replacement time.|`|NneJAQQAaa	Let me ask u this than u can decide: did u see where the water was leaking from, was it actually from the radiator?  more often is just a loose hose a small hole in the hose or the radiator itself which all of these u can easily do ur self and b inexpensive. As for the matter of the Gage it too can b easily fixed, it takes no more than 15-20 min. if your steering wheel tilts making the dash board a lot more accessible, and the gage you could have as easily had gotten it yourself at you local auto parts store and they could have advice you on how to do it if you had any doubts.

Finding cars in that price range that don't have problems takes a bit of legwork and looking, but it's not impossible.

A driver allowing more passengers than the number of seats risks a hefty fine.<br>  <br>  I was driving an 8 seater at a post event party in Beverly Hills. About 2 am, things started to break up. It was very dark in the neighborhood. My original party seemed to have multiplied by more than a couple. I allowed them to talk me into taking everybody home. The extra weight on the vehicle caused it to scrape any dip in the road. No, I didn't check to see if seat belts were secured. I just wanted to get these folks home and out of my limo so I could go home. I was on eggshells until I had the passengers who were sitting on the floor sitting in the seats. Bad judgment on my part. I didn't get caught, but I was not happy with myself for doing it.|`|bhNaTYjOaa	The answer is in the question.

Depending on year you might be able to do it for cheaper.|`|YDIWhciCaa	Typically the dealership is the only way to get a key for a German car.|`|f60f9dd363f9ce088c134896470f9277aa	I just ordered a fob not the key the key part is removable and can be placed into a new fob. But you may need to get the new fob programed.
T0ed2lhJaa	hi, get it checked out at a garage you could have a leak might just be a damaged pipe or something more serious|`|zOIgzIy4aa	near the motor? maybe it,s the weep hole in the water pump.|`|91365d1a40ff3d8ae08da3542098d99baa	more info is needed to many places it could be leaking from|`|nfua6A4paa	your fairly bold on your question but here are a few suggestions.... but it sounds like you know nothing about cars and engines... but heres what i think your problem is....<br>  <br>  a few places to look at: waterpump gasket maybe leaking. radiator hose maybe leaking from being old and it may have cracked. thermostat housing gasket! these 3 places are majorly most common to cauase coolant to leak!|`|GBunDp7Waa	Make sure to continuously check the coolant level. If you drive the vehicle without coolant, you risk the chance of overheating and blowing the motor. What may cost you a small amount to fix now may save you over a thousand to fix later. Get it looked at if you can' t fix it yourself.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	well i would fix it if i were you, of course we can't help you without knowing what you drive or any other information, but year make model and motor would sure be helpful.
3mo8vrpTaa	NO, sorry.  The large chain stores will read "codes" free that's it. up to you to draw conclusions from that data.  Mechanics earn a living diagnosing.  Just like your Doctor.  Ask a Doctor to find out what the problem is for free, then sell you the pill!!!! HA|`|bvCkplELaa	I dont know of any shop in the United States that does free car diagnostics. Many shops will do a free code read which retrieves the code(s). Sometimes that will tell you whats going on for free, other times it gets much more involved and you will have to pay the diag fee. There is a difference between a simple code read and an actual diagnostic of the problem.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	I assume you don't have a scanner.<br>  <br>  I doubt you have the ability to repair your car after the codes have been scanned as well.<br>  <br>  You get where I am going with this...|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	"You get what you pay for". Think about the fact that the shop is taking their time and effort along with using their equipment to figure out what is wrong. They deserve to be paid.
Q4O1v13Qaa	Could be a poor connection, which would show up only when in the car. A simple voltage drop test of the main power circuit could find this. If you have a bad diode, a simple test for AC voltage would find that, and Autozone is notorious for not checking that. But Amperage would be down from rated Amperage by either 1/3, 2/3, or have no Amperage, so that doesn't sound likely with an output of 14. <br>  <br>  Also, depending on how the test was run could give you different results on or off the car. It sounds like Autozone may have "full-fielded" the Alternator, where the guy who tested it on the car did a simple load test. If that's the case, it's likely you have a problem in the field circuit, and/or the Voltage Regulator. Should be controlled by the Engine Control Computer on an "03 Eclipse. I suggest you find a new mechanic who knows this system better.<br>  <br>  btw, Alternator output is measured in Amps, not Watts.|`|1OH9Wdrwaa	You probably have a bad connection somewhere, or a blown fuse. Make sure all the alternator and battery terminal connections are clean and tight, and check the associated wiring for any damage. Some cars have fusible links (looks like a wire) that will burn through if the circuit has too much draw, so have a look at those if your car has them. Good luck with that.|`|W0ijrDcuaa	when you had the alternator off it passed because wasnt any stress on it when you put it back on it had to much stress the alt. is shot you need another|`|AA12372161	your car may have a fuse just for the charging system check that,if ok it may be a diode at the starter gone bad or corroded or the cable to the starter corroded that causing problem
9AGTYeU7aa	Wow, that sounds like a nasty accident. Why did your tire blow out on a five month old car. You may want to reconsider what you buy for that reason alone. Do a little research and purchase the safest car you can find.<br>  And yes, I think it is an excellent time to buy a car right now. There are so many incentives and discounts out there right now, shop around get a great deal. <br>  Good luck and glad that you survived when your car did not.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	-If you really Liked what you had, -go for it. But keep in mind, gas prices will soon be going up again [BIG time], and Service charges will be RIGHT Behind them... If you can get something that's alittle "easier" on the Environment (AND your Wallet), that might be a better "plan..." ... -Oh, and this is an EXCELLENT time to buy a new Car- BEFORE people get their Tax Refunds -& take them to the Car Dealerships!  :)|`|AA11783107	Why would you have to ask if you should buy the same car??? If you liked the car buy the same one! Who Cares!
NRtqNelmaa	Top right side of the firewall.|`|6OdMLVTbaa	Inside the gas tank, you need a torch or angle grinder to get to it. Hope this helps!!!!!
uL5772kCaa	Google speaker size for your car.<br>  <br>  If it's 6.5 then they should fit fine. If they are smaller, then you can create adapters (or buy them) so they can fit.
3mo8vrpTaa	Adjust float level
wpgRMjgraa	From reading the reviews on these tires they have a overall very poor quality.....from both the tire as well as for replacement.
n3kzG3lMaa	Take it to the dealer.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Still under warranty? Take it to the dealership. Ford transmissions are always acting up. Theyre the worst. I would suggest not towing a lot cause it puts stress on the ford trannys. the F250 should be able to handle it but it will give problems as you've stated. I would look at other trucks like Dodge or Nissan but nissan only offers 1500 that wont tow a lot. Chevys are not good work trucks, they have lots of frame and suspension issues along with some electrical issues.
D6t6SoFRaa	Just replacing the ignition lock, about $200.  Problem is, this will only get you a vehicle that won't start.  The early Toyota Transponder systems required replacement of the ECU ($1500) as well if the  original key was not used.  Personally,  I would get an uncoded ignition, set it to your original key, and get you on your way for about $300 including the government's cut.  If the original key is unusable for some reason, figure on $200 as above, $300 to reflash the ECU, $150 for two chip keys for a total of $650 + tax.|`|eWObKmBSaa	Call Hi Lo autoparts or some other small auto parts pl.  They will tell ya.|`|cMsC5a14aa	Around $300|`|vVZLFPtRaa	Try Wd 40 lube it up ....
dQUISy3Haa	If you added them on, the front control module needs to be reprogrammed for them to work. Good luck.|`|DV4xyeChaa	1 check fuse<br>  2 check plug socket for 12.6 volts<br>  3 why replace? were both out> maybe they were ok<br>  4 switch broken?|`|6XIDmojtaa	if i did not come with them and you added them there is no fuse for it. if thats cool one guy said check you low beam which is true but if your truck wasn't equipped with them oem then the switch isn't on the console its at the end of the turn signal switch.|`|KPFQBQa1aa	The head lights have to be on low beam for the factory fog lamps to come on.  Check that as well.<br>  <br>  Mike<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mikestrawbridge.com/jeep-cherokee-off-road.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mikestrawbridge.com/jeep-cher...</a>|`|aCMEirceaa	check wire connection, get tester and check lining if no cuts or disruption
