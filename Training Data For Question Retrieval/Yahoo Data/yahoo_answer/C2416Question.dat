20080121122300AASTC0J	Arts & Humanities;History	What was the role of the common man in ancient society?	I know that my question is a bit vague (because of its dependence on the specific society), but I am looking for a synopsis on the overall role of the common man in ancient society.  In most cases, the common man (slaves included) were lower class people who were not of great concern to the government.  Could someone add onto that?      If anyone has any information he feels worth knowing, please let me know.      Thank you!

Uns a favor do herói; outros fazem brindes de reprova??o.      Quem brinda a favor vê as seguintes vantagens em Stalin:   Milh?es de pessoas morreram, houve fome e carestia, mas esse foi o pre?o da vitória do socialismo. A coletiviza??o das terras desenvolveu a agricultura e a indústria. O país se uniu em torno do firme governo de stalin. Os russos conseguiram deter a expans?o nazista contra a Rússia.      Quem brinda contra acha que a brutal violência da revolu??o e da implanta??o do novo governo provocou mais danos que vantagens: havia outros modos melhores para desenvolver o país e acabar com a classe capitalista, exploradora do proletariado. A reprenss?o reprimiu a for?a de trabalho, afastou técnicos e cientistas. O prestígio soviético no mundo seria maior sem mancha infame de tantos crimes.      (1) - Você brindaria a favor ou contra Stalin e seu modo de implanta??o do socialimo? Explique.

Simplesmente ignore a religi?o, e todos que vem falar a sua volta sobre a mesma. Discuss?o com religiosos é apenas perda de tempo... caia fora desses encontros desagradaveis...  você é um ateu, n?o precisa passar por isso. Imagine que você está num zoológico, e que cada bicho seja um determinado pregador, você n?o irá discutir com um le?o, ou com uma zebra... você apenas observa e cai fora. é assim que deve ser. Um ateu de verdade n?o esquenta a cabe?a com essas coisas, pois é absolutamente inútil, e uma grande perda de tempo. Como complementos recomendo ler livros de filosofia, procurar se distrair com artes (aprenda tocar um instrumento musical, pintura, dan?a)... procure por atividades públicas... teatros, shows ao vivos, ou até mesmo um passeio no parque... pratique auto-hipnose no intuito de se libertar das coisas que te incomodam e também para tra?ar objetivos para a sua vida... resumindo viva a liberdade de ser um ser humano, busque pela verdade, crie sua próprias regras.

20090205164544AALGanv	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can you write a "list poem"?	This is a wonderful poem by Maura Dooley:      WHAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD CARRY      My mother gave me the prayer to Saint Theresa.   I added a used tube ticket, kleenex,   several Polo mints (furry), a tampon, pesetas,   a florin. Not wishing to be presumptuous,   not trusting you either, a pack of 3.   I have a pen. There is space for my guardian   angel, she has to fold her wings. Passport.   A key. Anguish, at what I said/didn't say   when once you needed/didn't need me. Anadin.   A credit card. His face the last time,   my impatience, my useless youth.   That empty sack, my heart. A box of matches.      I was wondering if anyone else has attempted one/would like to attempt one. Ten points for the best poem!      Here is my effort:      WHAT EVERY STUDENT SHOULD CARRY      I throw in the diary I promised myself I would use.    Keys jangle with the change I got on the bus. The   Metro I retrieved from under the seat stiffens the    load. Phone goes in my right pocket. Paracetamol,   Pro Plus and Kalms. A Double Decker - so much   for the health kick. Next goes a bulging purse with   bent train tickets, rusty coppers and various ID cards   Pride, relucatance and apprehension nestle in neatly.

I commit murder,    More than once a week,    Murder of a butterfly,    Because I am too weak,       To weak to resist temptation,    And try to fix my mind,    I make a laceration,    Cause the world is so unkind,       My arm is covered in scars,    And cuts that run vein deep,    Bandages plaster my arms,    From times I felt asleep,       I draw another butterfly,    In hopes that it will stay,    Maybe it will last,    But I will probably cut it away...

I have never seen the movie but I heard it didn't do so well. I absolutely love reading the books though.. I love how detailed Stephanie Meyer's writing is. Now, I'm not one of those edward cullen crazed fan who is totally obsessed with him but I do admire his character very much. Yes, hes possessive and controlling but he has a undeniable love for Bella which I do crave. How do you feel about the characters? Do you think it  is healthy for teenage girls to be totally obsessed over a fictional character? I know I might sound like a dork but I do cry when I read the books.. does anyone else? I really do crave that love that he has for her and also how caring and protective he is. It can be a little overbearing at times, but yeah, state your opinion. Thank you! :]

20090205174935AAB4mTy	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Can anyone who "mastered" the guitar give me tips?	hey for anybody out there thats "mastered" the guitar, can you give me some tips on the guitar?      ok so i've started to learn the guitar by myself near the end of summer and i've gotten pretty good. i started out with playing guitar tabs but that didn't work. then i just started doodling with the guitar and i pretty much found a gillion different chords. I also found out how to do a one octave scale and arpeggio. I learned some scales used in guitar solos i forgot what they're called but i think i forgot them. so basically guitars a lot easier but im still not that good at it. I want to be able to doodle and make up songs on the guitar like i can on the violin and easily play to songs.       So any tips please? I'm going to focus on actually remembering what kind of chords they are though. that'll probably help. but other than that what else should i focus on learning or memorizing? thanks a lot.

20090205175134AApIxBp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Have any thoughts on an interesting, yet mildly educational book?	I need to find and read a book for an English assignment in school. I know this question has been asked repeatedly, but I wasn't too happy with most of the answers that were given. I've read a lot of great books in the past - my favorite fictional book being One Hundred Years of Solitude. Lately, however, I've only been interested in non-fictional books. That being said, for this assignment I need a fictional book, but would really prefer one with some scientific basis.   My top two choices are Brave New World and Moby-Dick (I know they don't fall under the category I just gave, but they're classics and seem really good).   So... Does anyone have any ideas for some scientific/educational/fictional books??   A book with a backdrop on genetics or quantum mechanics would be preferred! :)      Oh, and just in case some of you still aren't sure, I definitely do not intend on reading Harry Potter/Twilight/Lord of the Rings or any other such books which I find to be grossly juvenile.      :) Thanks.

Since a vacuum doesn't actually exist you can't measure an absence. Just like darkness isn't a substance but simply a word to describe no light. Einstein believed evil is simply the absence of love. Do you agree?

Paloma flies to earth as a dove just to see him and when her husband the sun finds out, he kills her.

20090205183558AA9XDTq	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Guitar- is it a bad idea to think of the whole and half steps...?	visually in terms of a piano keyboard?   I grew up playing piano and so when I'm figuring out chords, like m11 or whatever, on paper, (when I have the guitar in my hand it's a different matter), but sometimes when I'm going through chords/arpeggios on paper or in my head, when I'm not playing, it's easier for me to visualize the notes in terms of keyboard layout, I guess because it is linear instead of uh, 3-dimensional I guess, because of the strings.. (I'm doing just the notes to next transfer to chord diagrams, where I'll probably just mark the chords 1-3-5-b7-b9 or whatever so that I can use them generically regardless of key)   Is this maybe a bad idea? Should I just tell myself to visualize the notes across the strings? When I'm learning the notes maybe I should let it slide until I put the paperwork to practice on the strings? Or will this in the end be more detrimental to the learning process as a whole?   Thanks!
20090205184055AAllL41	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Rate poem? 10 points?	please note im only 16..         A welted red darkened petal   Falls into the silver lake   Flowing away little by little   Day by day   Until its nowhere near   The roses pure core.      The rose is still impact   Plump, glowing, vivacious   As if no part of it was missing   As if the petal had never fell      The petal now,   is washed up on the shore   decomposing, fading,   a tiny fraction only remains      If it had never fallen   and never gotten lost   it would still be part   of something beautiful   and not welting alone      If it was glued back   to the main roses core   it wouldn't be the same   as it was before   With an unsteady base   and mismatching the roses pure color   of lovely red      If the petal had never fallen   the rose wouldn't have an uneven side   Yes, indeed the rose can notice   that its unbalanced      The rose would happily   accept the lost petal   to come back   with its open arms.      But if the petal had to choose   to be "glued" back   It would rather be hated by the rose   because the glue would ware out eventually   and again it would fall   and the pain would just be to great   to leave it again      to leave you again

20090205183639AACv20h	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	No reason to do anything?	None. I don't feel depressed. I don't see any purpose in doing anything at all. I don't want to do anything. I wake up, and watch TV, play games or read not because its fun, but it makes time go by faster so I can sleep again.       I can apply for universities. I know I'm capable to succeed, but I simply don't care. I tried forcing myself to do something, but within an hour 1   got frustrated and couldn't focus. Death seems a nice way to go. Its not that I have no energy, but I have no will or desire to achieve or do anything in life. Just take the next train to the other side. (die, basically) Strange thing is I don't feel sad or depressed, nothing majorly bad happened to me. Its like I'm dead already, but my body keeps on moving. Any advice, opinions?

20090205185552AAsK5QL	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Why can I suddenly not sing anymore?	Okay so for the past year, I've been wanting to be a better singer. I've never had lessons, I sort of just taught myself through the casual, yet sage, advice given to my siblings who spent 4 years in high school chorus, as well as one on one lessons. It wasn't much, but it was enough to keep me improving. And I was improving for a while, and I wanted to get even better, so I talked to my sister. She gave me a CD that had a 25 minute audio track of singing lessons. It's narrated by a guy who calls the exercises "vocalsizing" that improve your range, flexibility, all while warming up at the same time. I worked with it for about a month, and for a while they were really working, but suddenly I can't do them anymore.      I can't sing with quality anymore. I don't know why. The notes are harder to hit. I don't feel it. I feel constrained. WHY IS THIS?      I know for sure I'm not sick. I don't know what it is. My throat is fine, and I'm not coughing. And it was really bad at one point, and I would eventually just give up. By the end of it, you could tell that I had lost some of my voice. It was partial, but if I asked someone, that they said they could tell my voice was slightly diminished. So I laid off singing for about 3-4 days, figure I let my voice rest, and then got back into it. It was still tough to sing at first, though not as bad, and I managed to sing somewhat well yesterday. By the end of my warm up I felt good, but I didn't feel completely free like I usually do, where I can hit all these notes and have fun with it. And then I just tried again now, and I tried pushing through it and seeing if I had to just adjust the way I was singing, but nothing really worked. It just got harder. It's back to square one again. Some parts better than others, but I just gave up. I can't sing. My voice is weakening again.      WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MY VOICE? AND WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT?

20090205185718AApUQbn	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	" Sleeping in the Forest" by Mary Oliver meaning of last lines?	What does the last 2 lines mean?   "I had vanished at least a dozen times   into something better."      I thought the earth remembered me, she   took me back so tenderly, arranging   her dark skirts, her pockets   full of lichens and seeds. I slept   as never before, a stone   on the riverbed, nothing   between me and the white fire of the stars   but my thoughts, and they floated   light as moths among the branches   of the perfect trees. All night   I heard the small kingdoms breathing   around me, the insects, and the birds   who do their work in the darkness. All night   I rose and fell, as if in water, grappling   with a luminous doom. By morning   I had vanished at least a dozen times   into something better.
