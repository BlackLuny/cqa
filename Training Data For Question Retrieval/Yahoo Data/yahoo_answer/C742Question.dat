20090203073859AAha2Ut	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Vegetarian and Vegans, why did you give up meat? Are you Christian too?	This question is going to take a rather dark twist near the end. (I am athiest, more-less an Ex-Christian)      For the past few days I have been looking amongst the Vegan Vegetarian section because my new diet consists of not eating meat for the majority of the day (I can eat seafood whenever, but for red meat, I can only eat it within a 4 hour time frame)      I want to know why you gave up eating meat... For the Technical, healthy aspect, or for the moral aspect.      Did you do it for YOUR health, or for the life of another animal?      And are you a Christian? Or Believe in God (Jahova) and what if you learned that God is more evil than man in the ways of animals. Why? Because God likes the smell of burning animal flesh, That is the reason people made sacrifices in the "olden days".      In Genesis 8:20-21, after surviving the flood, Noah built an altar and "took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. And when the Lord smelled the pleasing odor, the Lord said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of man".          Personally, I'm completely for someone giving up meat for their health. I'm not going to give it up  because I like it and I think it's natural for us to eat meat. As for the moral stand point. Animals eat animals, always have, always will. Even whales eat meat. You think we torture them? There are ants that have slaves. Cats and killer whales kill and play with animals and then leave them to rot without a second thought about eating them. To torture an animal and to eat an animal are two completely different things. To eat an animal is natural, to torture one is an instinct, a bad instinct, to release stress. Usually if you are insecure about something. Or as a cruel method of entertainment (Cat plays with mouse, mouse dies and doesn't get eaten. - We just do it more creatively because we have a more advanced brain and simple things don't please us anymore.)       (sorry, got off topic) Why did you give it up (and defend your stand point if it was for morals. Personally I love animals, but I wouldn't deny my instinct to eat them. Duh, I'm not going to eat an animal I've owned, or one that I knew. That's just as bad as someone asking you to cry over their child's death. You don't know their kid, you'll feel sorry, but there is no attachment so you can't cry for it.)
20090203085121AAkN9zk	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Need info. about fry pans?	I bought a couple cast iron fry pans at a garage sale this past summer and would like to know the beast way to cllean them.  They are dirty, but otherwise in pretty good shape.  I've heard of a method of putting them in the oven after they've been rubbed with oil, etc.  Also, how do you care for them once I begin to use them?  If food sticks on the surface, does that mean I need to use more oil?

Ok so;   some people say they have lost alot of weight by eating just fruits and veggies, drinking lots of water, and exercising daily.   Is this healthy?   Will you really lose weight fast?

20090203074706AAg74B8	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Healthy Budget friendly meals?	My husband and I are both italian and LOVE to eat.. Pasta is one of our favorites.. But he also LOVES meat, I could go with out it.      I just had a baby 4 months ago and have some weight i need to lose still, and he is a little bit over weight and out of shape himself. We both decided to start being more healthy..   He is dieting now. But I can't because Im breastfeeding. So we need healthy but tasty meals, that us italians will like.       Just the two of us we spend over $150 a week on groceries. Which leaves us with no "play" money.       I hate to see what happens when my daughter starts eating food.

20090220112252AAHg7sV	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Defrosted Chicken in Fridge 2 days ago. Still good?	Hey, this may be too little too late, but should I be worried about the chicken breast I just ate?      I defrosted the chicken days before the expiration date on the package. I defrosted in the fridge late Wednesday night and cooked it thoroughly today at 7pm (so in the fridge for about 44 hours). I opened the bag I thawed it in and it didn't smell. It was a little slimey, but I don't have much experience with chicken storage to compare. It wasn't overly slimey, so I just washed it. The texture afterward felt fine. The smell, and believe me I checked for signs of anything foul, was still good. Again, I cooked it thoroughly.      I'm only a little paranoid about it because I'm sick at the moment, but I'm normally a healthy, 28-year-old male. Mainly, if you respond, can you give me some odds of getting sick off the chicken?
