20090220073054AADDrF0	Travel;Air Travel	How much time do you  need for connecting flights with separate  tickets?	I will be  traveling from Brussels  to  Lubbock this summer, but those tickets are incredibly expensive. I have found a really cheap ticket to Dallas, and even  if I buy a ticket for Lubbock it is still about a  100 euros cheaper.

I assume that my  luggage would be  checked in to Dallas, and that i'd have to check it  in again, but i'm not sure. I'm  not  even sure whether it is possible to do t his. Could you  please help?

20090220093630AA5zPr0	Travel;United States;New York City	Is NYC a good place for me to live?	I am 16 years old and looking a bit ahead to where I would like to live. I am from an upper middle class suburb in CT. As a window and door service man, I have been to NYC countless times, all 5 boroughs. I've been to countless apartment buildings, single-family residences, condo buildings, penthouses, commercial buildings, etc. I love the idea of the city, especially from my life experience in the suburbs and having to use a gallon of gas just to have a Jack Danny's burger at TGI. I am a semi-avid bicyclist, riding at least 2000 miles a year on busy roads (I am not scared of cars going 50mph coming within inches of me). I lived in a big house with 7 acres of woods and a huge lawn my whole life, but I don't mind a 600 square foot apartment building. I love the idea of the city and it being super crowded, always something going on or something to look at. I can stand there for hours just looking at all the activity. I like being able to walk or ride a bike to most places. My only problem with moving there is the lack of parking, I have two beautiful cars that I can't part with (both completely stock type 1 Volkswagens). I have a bit of money, and I expect to pay $3K a month for a nice apartment. What do you think? Should I move there? NYC residents only please!      BTW- I LOVE White Castle, everytime I am down there I have a #3.
