She took them along by the river to show how the area had been redeveloped and moved upmarket.    On their walk, they met six people.  Five of them offered them swigs from bottles of Buckfast and other alcoholic drinks.    The sixth threw a shopping trolley at them.
wjFeAlGxaa	The Gateway of India was built to commemorate the visit of the King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai in 1911 AD. The foundation stone was laid on 31st March 1911 AD. The splendid gateway was designed by George Wittet and his design was sanctioned in August 1911 AD. It is built in the Indo-saracenic style integrating local style of architecture also and adoptingfrom the Muslims of Gujarat. Between 1915 AD and 1919 AD, the work proceeded on reclamations at Apollo Pier for the land on which the gateway and the new sea wall would be built. The foundations were completed in 1920.    The gateway was built of yellow kharodi basalt and reiforced concrete. The cost of the construction of the gateway came to about Rupes 21,0000, which was given mainly by the government. The approach road was never built due to scarcity of funds and the gateway now stands at an angle to the road leading up to it. The whole seaport front was realigned so that it comes in line with designed promenade, which would sweep down to the middle of the town. The height of the central dome is 48 ft in diameter and rises 83 ft above the ground at its highest point. The has four turets and decorated with intricate lattice work carved into the yellow basalt stone.        The construction of the gateway was completed in 1924 AD and it was opened on December 4, 1924 AD by the Viceroy, Earl of Reading.    When the British rule ended in 1947, this colonial symbol also became a sort of a memorial. The last British troop that left India, First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, passed through the Gateway of India on 28 February 1948.    Today this symbol of colonialism has got Indianised and draws a lot of local tourists and citizens. Behind the arch are the steps leading down to the water. The Gateway of India was starting point for the tourists who come to Mumbai. It is one of the finest example of colonial architectural heritage in India.|`|AA11272288	The Gateway of India or more often called as Gateway of India Mumbay was built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Bombay, prior to the Darbar in Delhi in December 1911. The foundation stone was laid on March 31, 1913 and George Wittet's final design sanctioned in August 1914. Between 1915 and 1919 work proceeded on reclamations at Apollo Pier for the land on which the Gateway of India and the new sea wall would be built. The foundations were completed in 1920. The Gateway of India Mumbay is built from yellow Kharodi basalt and reinforced concrete. The central dome is 48 feet in diameter and 83 feet above ground at its highest point. The construction was completed in 1924, and the Gateway was opened on December 4, 1924 by the Viceroy.     Gateway of India construction was done by J C Gammon (Bombay) Pvt Ltd which is the only ISO 9001: 1994 certified company.

If you are outside the PRC then you can try online stores or stores in your nearest Chinatown.  Most people just call them meditation balls, or hand balls but they're called Baoding because, (as if often the case in China where every town / region likes to stand out as a special area) they're supposed to have been created there first, it's in Hebei.

I could go on and on and on and on about things you could do in the big city, but I won't, due to a limit of how much I can write. I guarantee you that no matter where you go, you will have a blast, because New York City is one of the best places to visit! I will list for you some fun things that you can do, and I will give you some websites and/or street addresses to some good restaurants, clubs and other fun activities.    While in New York, I STRONGLY suggest you go to see a fun show called Fuerzabruta in downtown New York. It is very fun! It's almost like a club, but there's no age limit! In the main lobby, there is a bar for refreshments, and there are souvenirs of the show, like little key chains and t-shirts.

I don't even do half of my shopping in New York; I do it in either Paramus, New Jersey or online. However, I did find a website where you can find some different places to shop, and you can narrow it down with what you want to shop for: http://www.ny.com/shopping/  Remember that these shops can be anywhere in the city, so be willing to go to Queens if need be.    As far as attractions, there are a lot of things you should go to see. You should definitely try to go see the Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. The website Im giving you is for directions to the ferry station, where you can go see Ellis Island and the Statue Of Liberty. Unfortunately, the interior of the Statue Of Liberty is closed, but the wonderful statue is beautiful. The website is here >>>> http://www.ny.com/transportation/ellis.h...

Also, for transportation, there are maps in subway cars and on subway trains, and there are also maps in buses. The maps at bus stops are usually just for the bus route.    I hope this guide has helped you, and I hope you enjoy the many wonders you will find in New York City!|`|kBSlNEL2aa	Well the first thing that would be the  easiest to obtain would be our American Cuisine.  If your in New York, you must try american pizza.  After you eat New York's pizza all of the others will taste like feet. Honestly.  If your going to see the sites, then the statue of liberty is a must see.  As well as the Empire state building.  Most of the other places like musuems and stuff wouldn't be that fun without a large group so I wouldn't recommend do that. (not very fun anyway...lol.) Then is the final and probably the one you will do the most...Shopping.  You must go to Macy's because it is the original department store...And I would suggest the Apple store (but that's just me) the rest is all up to you to decide...Have fun.|`|DtBE35wHaa	Here ya go..www.nystate.org ( a very well known site and you may look up events and such and even buy tickets that would make you happy

But that's the problem, no country could be so perfect as to be like the picture you painted for us.    Therefore, I will have to make do with whatever is possible and try to make myself comfortable by doing the rest myself.  Can't have everything, we all know.  No one is going to serve us all the things/comforts we yearn for in a silver platter. :)    ---------  Excuse me but I beg to differ when you said that the Philippines is the country you specifically implied.

AA10527991	The north, especially the northeast.  New York State is the most beautiful place that I've ever seen in the world.  And the rest of that part of the world, New England and the mid-Atlantic area, is to die for.  The area around the Great Lakes is wonderful as well.  How could you go wrong?|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Northern. I live in Michigan. so beautiful here  we have the great lakes , over 11,000 inland lakes. hundreds of rivers to go canoeing rafting tubing kayaking and tubing down. we also have over 300 waterfalls.

Particularly northeast Alabama, in the mountains.  The only thing I don't like about the South is people who talk nasty about the North.  Most of the people who do that have never been there or have only seen one part of it and think it's all like that.  That's just ignorance talking.  I've lived in New England for many years and I don't like the harsh winters, but it's beautiful in most places.  I've driven through New York City many times, and I wouldn't want to live there, but at least I know that's not typical of "The North."|`|CLfjamAPaa	I live in the upper midwest. I prefer the south. The hilly terrain, the more laid back attitude - and no snow. What is not to like?|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Middle Atlantic.  I have the beach in the summer and the mountains in the winter.|`|jRtQTN24aa	The South. Mainly because I was born there, but also love the swamps of Louisiana and Mississippi. The southwest ain't bad either.  Lived up north in New Jersey and Penn. Don't care for the north.
pvabglXhaa	I hope you still have power though.    I have just had my second night in a row without power which means no aircon, not even able to run a bloody fan.    Last night it was 35 degrees in my house.  Tried sleeping outside but the mozzies got us.    I've had only 6hrs of sleep in two days and my dogs are bordering on passing out from the heat.    If the power goes out again tonight and there's no cool change, there will be hell to pay if I eventually get through to the power company.    Buy lots and lots of ice, put some in the bathtub and spend a few seconds chilling down.  Try to get hold of the bandana things that you can wrap around your neck, they are filled with the crystals that expand in water and keep you cool for hours.  Cool showers every few hours help a bit too.    Good luck, I feel your pain.|`|fT6VVji9aa	Buy a pedestal fan - they are really cheap and next best thing to an aircon.  I'm in Tassie and I'm on fire too and I have an aircon in the lounge/dining area and a pedestal fan in my bedroom to blow cool air on me all night.  If you get one, make sure it is fairly silent though, as the noisy ones keep you awake.  Also have a cool shower just before going to bed to wash all the sweat off - makes you feel much better.|`|t1PPy8Lwaa	move to michigan!|`|CnGR2xeoaa	Try placing a cold (ice) pack on the back of your neck. It makes your whole body feel cool.  If you don't have a cold (ice) pack try placing a damp cloth on your forehead.|`|PmISA5z0aa	Contrary to belief in North America, drinking iced water when it is hot is not good for you. If it is really hot as you are saying you will get a heat stroke if you drink too cold a drink. At least in tropical countries, people avoid drinking very cold water.     In the house you can tie a wet cotton cloth to the window or in front of a table fan. we also used to tie one on top of the bed like a mosquito net and then start the fan. It feels exactly like an airconditioner.   Also, if you have east or west facing windows keep them closed and put blinds on it in the day time so that the room does not heat up.   If you live on the top most floor, you can pour water over the roof. It will be useful only after the sun goes down.   The cold water pack on the neck is a very good idea. Just don't use too cold pack, you can seriously get a heat stroke when there is so much difference in the temperatures.|`|DmGnCdc2aa	get a hammock or a canvas stretcher so don't have a hot mattress to sleep on|`|kMu3d8g0aa	I just got home from the beach. It was soooo good in the water.    I also have a hot water bottle in the freezer and I'll take that to bed with me.    No air con at my place either! :(|`|AksA9h3Aaa	I find if you have a cold shower and then when you get out and you're still wet, stand in front of the fan.  It will cool you down a lot!    Also soak a hand washer (towel) in icey water, then put it around your neck or sit on top of your forehead while you're lying down.  When you're trying to sleep, just keep a couple water bottles by your bed to sip on through the night.    I hope the heat passes quickly for you guys down South.|`|EfpnRLyUaa	i heard a suggestion, put your clothes/pj's in the fridge/freezer/some ice, then when you need them, put them on, they will keep you nice and cold, also, you can turn a table upside down and put a wet sheet over the four legs, then get a pedestal fan and turn it on aiming it at the sheet, then get in between the four legs and sit there, the air from the fan will blow the cool air from the sheet onto you, without you getting wet|`|0DtWgXxUaa	Sorry I answered a bit late. Do you have friends near by with aircon? Maybe you can have a sleepover?  - Put a cold washcloth/towel on you.|`|abx5VNsOaa	I'm lucky i have a very good air con,take a cool shower and drink lots of icey water.I'm so over this extreme heat.|`|QQbbReRAaa	I feel your pain mate, yeah just buy a pedestal fan (if you can get one), I had mine about 20 cm from my head on full blast last night, only way I could stop sweating, lol. Keep the house closed up and blinds down (bit late now though). The cool change is coming tonight, just gotta hang in there!|`|3IXDx9nhaa	You poor thing.  Try putting cold water in a spray bottle and spraying yourself in bed with a fan on is great.  Put water with ice cubes in a tub and soak your feet and put cold water on your wrists.  Keep a container with cold water and ice cubes by your bed with a washer and put it on your head.  If you have a wheat pack then put it in the freezer and instead of a heat pack use it as a cold pack.  Have a cool shower and go to bed with your hair wet and a fan on if you have one.  Keep hydrated and drink/sip lots of water all day and night.  Suck on ice cubes. I am on the Gold Coast and am happy I do right now.  I feel for you and hope my little tips help you survive the heatwave.|`|wcUhuNPVaa	I live in South Australia and I know how you feel  I have a cold shower before going to bed and sleep naked.  (I don't recommend doing this if you do not have privacy in your bedroom)
lYkvps54aa	you could visit edinburgh castle, zoo, princess Street or head up to the west end and get plastered!|`|eJCFcJhbaa	all of what frank w says plus get yourself onto rose street and do a pub crawl! I went to the zoo last week and hardly any of the cool animals were around so would maybe give that a miss til the warmer weather comes in if you have long enough|`|10b6b1e35f35b0107be979f66272da0caa	You could also climb up to Arthurs Seat behind the city.

ade3d3f3ca191c9247976e755ae8c508aa	It really depends on what you're looking for. Other responders have mentioned that Ottawa is a government town and it certainly is that. However, it has a lot more to offer than just that. If you like being outdoors, then Ottawa is a fantastic place to live.    Do you enjoy outdoor hikes? Then Gatineau Park is a mere half hour drive from the city and it has hiking trails all over the place. It's the same for cross-country skiing, where the trails are patrolled, I might add.    Do you like skating? The Rideau Canal is open for FREE skating, usually from the end of December to mid-late February although even that depends entirely on the temperature.    Spring sees many sugar shacks open within a short drive and where you can buy genuine maple syrup. You can't beat that with a stick.    Summers are hot and humid and tourists from all over the world (literally) tend to congregate on Parliament Hill. Byward Market is always an exciting place to go, even in the winter.    Autumn sees the trees evolve into an artist's palette of flaming oranges, burning reds and ochres and bright yellows. Set against the endless and untainted blue skies it's as though the very air is infused with colour.    Do you have to speak/French in order to work in Ottawa? Not as such although it will certainly make you more desirable if you can. I should add that there are some jobs for which bilingualism is a must but employers will make that clear to prospective employees.    As for your other questions, again, it really depends on what you mean by night life. Does Ottawa have a good night life? Wander through Byward Market and see for yourself.    Good restaurants? The very best Vietnamese food I found is in a small place in the suburbs. The place is called "Pho Mi Bo Ga" and it's in a small strip mall.|`|HUluAQM3aa	Lived there for 22 years, great place.  Good nightlife and food as well. French is optional everywhere.|`|AA10527991	I used to visit Ottawa often when I lived very near the US/Canadian border and I can only tell you that I think it's a fabulous city.  It is a busy work place during the week as it is a government town, but the weekends are made for fun all year round.|`|LZJPMl8raa	DO NOT come to Ottawa. This city has the bunch of lazy government officials who take such a long time to solve problems! Screw Ottawa!|`|V5AliBPMaa	It's clean and whatever but it's boring. You will kill you're self if you lived in a busy city or any place that has stuff to do. The only good things about ottawa is... Nothing. It sucks. They have some good restaurants but nothing great, and the only good restaurants are high end, shopping sucks my family and I have to go to montreal and the US every month and if you want to go to a good club your going to have to cross over to Quebec all the time. So if you do end up moving to Ottawa have fun going to Silver City every day to watch a movie. And if you want a good paying job yes you need french even though no one knows just french they know english too. And the government is screwed up big time. Oh and one more thing. Its freezing and it snows every half a second in the winter, and in the Summer its not really even hot until last year, in fall it rains a lot and its cold. Ottawa sucks, its stupid and junky. Do you're self a favor and don't move here.|`|b7jq1tfRaa	I wouldn't recommend moving to Ottawa its called "the city that fun forgot" for a reason.  The transportation sucks both public and highways.  Yes there is/was a transit strike on but if you want to get somewhere in a hurry you had better have a car or take a taxi.  I tried to get from where I was living to where I worked a 30 minute drive.  If I took transit it was an hour and a half IF I made all the transfers, if I missed just one it almost doubled my commute.    If you want any government job you had better be French speaking and know some English because you won't get in with the feds or the city.  Its even that way in the hospitals, my daughter was in for a scan and the doctor, nurse & tech all spoke french and ignored my partner who is an RN until she spoke up and made them speak in English.    Lastly the municipal government in Ottawa is stuck in the 60's thats 1860s  I've lived in and around Ottawa for the past 25 or so years and every now and then the troop out these grand plans and hire a consultant to tell them how it is to be done and then the project is scrapped.  The two latest ones are another bridge across the river to Quebec and the transit tunnel.  Also this city has a no track mind they can't seem to get there collective s $t together to put in a light rail system everything is done by bus.    No my friend if you are considering moving to Ottawa as a fun place to live I'd think again.|`|hpFsK6DXaa	I wouldn't move to Ottawa. I think people look very sad there. Move to the country. Fresh air and caring people. Depending on where you are.|`|5oAwWj2taa	I would recommend Ottawa for a place to live because used to live there and there are many places to go and things to do. You do not have to speak french because I have never spoken french and I lived there though it might help a little to learn french. It is also a small drive to other cute relaxing towns for short weekend get away. Its government does not take away the fun. Delicious food I love it.The streets are beautiful at night perfect for a night walk. all in all I think its a good place to move to.|`|6rCbzw6oaa	its the gayest city on the planet! dont come here!!!|`|GyBeE7ofaa	You'd better own a car, because our transportation system is non-nonexistent.|`|NgX97gA1aa	I currently live here, and it's a great city. A variety of things to do! I believe a previous poster listed many of the great things Ottawa has to offer. We have great festivals and celebrations in the summer too! Canada Day and the Tulip Festival are always fun. You should see all the people downtown on Canada Day! It's a madhouse!    Oh, and ignore the 'non-existant' transportation system comment. Our transit drivers WERE on strike, and they've finally agreed to binding arbitration, so things should be back in order in the next month or so.     Really, it's a city you've got to experience to understand how awesome it is. I went from a small town, and living there for 13 years, to Ottawa. It was easy to settle in, the transit system is easy to understand, and the people are genuinely nice for the most part!    I hope you decide to move here! :D

Anyone wishing to possess or use a firearm must have a Firearms Licence and be over the age of 18 with some exceptions. Owners must have secure storage for their firearms.    Before a person can buy a firearm, they must obtain a Permit To Acquire. The first permit has a mandatory 28 day delay before it is first issued. In some states (e.g. Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales), this is waived for second and subsequent firearms of the same class. For each firearm a "Genuine Reason" must be given, relating to pest control, hunting, target shooting, or collecting. Self-defence is not accepted as a reason for issuing a licence.    Each firearm in Australia must be registered to the owner by serial number.

4lm0oj2caa	To start with, when you spell a name of a country or a nationality, you should start with a capital letter, so it's not polish but Polish and not uk but the UK.  As for claiming benefits by Poles in the UK, it is not enough to go to the country and start claiming a benefit. You need to work there as well. So if you work and pay taxes, you have a right to claim a benefit if you need it. You don't complain about Poles living in the UK and paying British taxes, do you? If you want to start a legal job in the UK, you need to pay for Worker Registration Scheme - noone has mentioned that to you before? The Sun should have written about it when bashing 'evil Poles'.  Moreover, Poles are only one of the nations who work in the UK. I wonder if you have posted a similar question to Russians, Indians, Turkish, Australians, Kiwis or citizens of any other European Union countries who have the same right as Polish citizens to claim a benefit in the UK. If you haven't, it may suggest that you are being xenophobic towards Poles.  I can't be 100% sure that out of so many Poles living in the UK noone claims a benefit that they don't deserve. But if there are such people, they should be ashamed for themselves but I see no reason why I should be ashamed for them. It would be the same if I told you to be ashamed of British chavs who has been living all their lives on the dole.  Finally, British officals wouldn't give benefits to people who don't deserve it. So if a Pole working in the UK gets a benefit, it means that he or she has been considered to deserve it. Similarly, many Poles out there came to the Isles to earn money, and they can earn much more working hard than sitting on their bums doing nothing. Many of those who have immigrated to the UK to find a job are moving now to Canada or Norway rather than stay in the UK and live on the dole.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	imsoinlovewithmyexbf....I hope your exbf wasn't Polish!?

KS2OHXCRaa	Bus:  The only bus company that I am aware of that do long distance Europe travel is Eurolines (http://www.eurolines.com/ ), and this is the link to PDF of the bus schedule from Italy to Germany: http://www.eurolines.it/pdf/orari2008200...    By the look of it, you'll need to travel from Turin to Milan first in order to get a bus that goes to Hannover or Hamburg, then travel from there to Munster.      Train:  For train information in Italy, check Trenitalia's website : http://www.trenitalia.it/en/index.html    For train information in Germany, check DB Bahn's website : http://www.bahn.de/international/view/en...

However, searching either of the sites above will give you the different options of travel, of which you can use the same information then to purchase for individual tickets.

You may take a train from Turin (19:39) to Milan (20:49) , take the bus (21:30) which departs wednesday, friday, and sunday to Dortmund (11:30) and continue by train (12:25) to Mnster (12:54).  To find out about trains in Europe it is best to use the website of the German railway company (DB) since it contains most European train connections.  Enter "Muenster" as destination, otherwise you'll get a long questionnaire of different places to be chosen, since there is also a small village called Munster.  But I think that you want Muenster as destination since Munster would not have a nearby airport.  Based on the length of travel and the inadequacy of connections you should reconsider using a flight. AirBerlin offeres early bookers flights from Milan Malpensa to Mnster/Osnabrck to start from 41 (64 including tax and fuel surcharges)        Source(s):  http://www.eurolines.it/pdf/orari2008200...  http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.e...  http://www.airberlin.com/site/abvakanz_c...|`|NZPgCcHWaa	As starting in Italy, try www.trenitalia.com and also www.bahn.de  Trenitalia will give you the connections, but maybe not the price. You will have to change trains twice or more: In Milan and in Basel, the route I recommend. It is scenic, crossing the Alps.

Then you have to go to DAS Extranjeria on calle 100 and get your cedula. You will have to show your VISA and get your blood tested, and some other stuff (Takes ALL day) It then you go pick it up in about 8-10 days.|`|OwNIzpCyaa	Getting to Colombia is the easy part.     Having an employer sponsor you is the harder part. Why? Because the employer must voucher for you in case you get fired. If you are fired THE COMPANY must cough up the expenses to boot you out of the country.    Most companies do all the paperwork.     If you are British there is less paperwork.     Getting a cedula is, ironically, very hard to get. You can only apply for it after 5 years of legal residence. Marrying a Colombian subject will entitle you to a prolonged stay but not unlimited residence. You will still have to wait for 5 years.     Good luck

You must, however, enter the UK using your British passport and enter Australia using your Oz passport.  Other than that, there aren't any restrictions.
ZaQ8CYxyaa	Yes, but probably only temporarily (up to two years).     In order to get a pernamnet job you need a work permit, which are hard to get for jobs in the hotel industry, or become a NZ citizen or pernament resident.    You can however get on the United Kingdom working holiday scheme (see website http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/s... ) for details) if you are under 30, have good health (and you will be required to get a medical certificate to prove this if you hope to stay for 12 months or more), no crinimal convictions, and a UK passport. Technically working must be incidental to your visit, with travel your main purpose, but you can still work long hours (no limit that I'm aware of). You just have to do a fair bit of travel (and even if this requirement didn't exist, New Zealand's too good a country not to see any of it when your over here).     Jobs are not hard to come across (but the recent economic downturn may have changed that), and your UK experience should help you. Just make sure you get referrees in the UK, and apply once you have the permit (few employers will take you on without one). One good website I recomend to get work in New Zealand is www.seek.co.nz.    Best luck, and I have no doubt that if accepted you will really enjoy your time in New Zealand.
dpKntiZoaa	Of course it's false - total scam and very common    If you didn't apply for a job, didn't get a interview and it's a 'dream come true' job, then alarm bells should ring    So the paying for a work permit only re-enforces that it's a scam.  They have asked you to send it via Western Union/Moneygram right? - Scammers' best friend as there is no recourse with this method and indeed even WU warns against this on their homepage http://www.westernunion.com/info/fraudSc...    Also they are probably using a hotmail, yahoo, gmail or someother free Email account?   A genuine HR dept would never use anything other than a mail account from the domain name.    This is called "Advance Fee Fraud" (google it and see) and is very common. If you send money, you will never see it again    The fact is that if an employer wants you bad enough, they will pay for the work permit! Call the scammer's bluff and tell them that.  Tell them to take it from your first month's paycheck if they really want you enough (but they will find some reason why this is not possible and even threaten you)    Do not send any more personal info, do not send any money.  If you are still not sure then contact Contiental directly through their official homesite (not the one that the scammers have given you) http://www.conti-online.com/generator/ww...|`|nGkCWpRVaa	false|`|UfVNHruSaa	Hi Friend,                Please find the answer of your query below.

AA11914318	With the current status on foreign students imposed by the UK & EU Government, it would be pretty difficult to get a seat - whether you take your PLABs or not, and score the highest from amongst all Indian students applying, still the seats will be preferred for all EU candidates before any non-EU is considered. So the competition now to enter the UK to study for your post grad is much more difficult. You must have heard the news about lots of Indian doctors having to return... so even if you do manage to come here to study, you wouldn't be able to work here or gain any kind of experience in your field.

Currently, because if the world wide economic situation you might have some additional troubles getting a job teach overseas.

So, I thought I'd throw in my 2 cents.    The first thing you will need to consider is if you have the qualifications to teach over seas - that means (at least) a BA degree + a TEFL certificate. Most schools will not accept any teachers that do not have both. I got my TEFL at TEFL Worldwide Prague. It was a 4 week program and it really helped me as a teacher and as someone looking for work!    As for where? Well, I can recommend Prague first and foremost. You will have no problem finding work here (once you have a TEFL) and it's an amazing country. There is lots to see and do here, not to mention a great jumping off point for travel. Also - most schools here help you out with the Visa process which is helpful. :) The money isn't the best, but the atmosphere makes up for it.    If you are interested in money - get your TEFL and head to So. Korea. That's where the money is! :)     I hope this was helpful...and good luck!|`|sKogsJYoaa	Yeah- America.|`|c5edde1eefc539ea913fc614028c07e0aa	There are lots of opportunties in Korea - would be a great cultural experience too.

Jm3vMKx3aa	72 kilometer from Frankfurt Central Train Station (Frankfurt(Main) Hbf),  75 kilometers from Frankfurt Airport (Frankfurt(M) Flughafen Regionalbf)    Regional direct trains are departing from Frankfurt Hbf between 07:25 and 21:25 every two hours; on workdays additional directs trains are departing at 16:25, 16:38, 18:24 and 18:38. The travel takes 1 hour and 17 minutes. Other connections are available requiring a stopover at Gro?-Umstadt Wiebelsbach and take about 1 ? hours.  From the Airport you may take the Light Railway S-8 or S-9 from platform regio 1 to Frankfurt Hbf, it takes 11 to 17 minutes.    Don't take the Intercity trains departing from platform 4 or 5 and don't get a ticket from the German Railway company (DB), they will sell you a DB-ticket which costs between 19.50 and 32.50 depending on the type of train. You can only get to the Frankfurt Central station by the Intercity trains in 11-12 minutes and have to stopever into a Regional-train anyhow.    By using the S8/S9 train to get into Frankfurt you may use a ticket of the Rhine-Main Traffic Association (RMV) sold from RMV vending machines or the DB/RMV ticket office at the airport located at Terminal 1, Level 0, Hall B, for 13.00 (tarif-zone 7 (Preisstufe 7)). The same price applies for a ticket from Frankfurt Hbf to Michelstadt.        Source(s):  http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.e...  http://www.rmv.de/coremedia/generator/RM...

VlhmbHGGaa	Wow, that is a difficult task. Airfares can't easily be compared. Some tickets requires advanced purchase. Tickets may have rules that you must be staying a Saturday night. Some tickets are changeable and refundable. Weekdays change price. Connecting flights may have another price. Even time of day can affect price.    So you must decide on some criteria before you can compare tickets, for example:    Cheapest available ticket purchased 30 days before departure and staying x days before returning. Departure any time of the day. Non-stop.     Then you will have to find a website like expedia.com and repeat this search every day/week for the period you want, depending on the scale you want. I guess weekday.    X-axis should be date and Y-axis price.

I have stayed in the Holiday Inn on International Drive. I don't recommend that one.  My advise though is if you're going to stay on International Dr. is to pick a hotel with a "higher number address." Anything 800+ would be safe.   The Holiday Inn is like 6515 or close to that. The lower numbers seemed to be in an older part of International Dr. and not as nice!  Plus, a lot of the hotels on International Dr. allow dogs because of the convention center on International Dr. (dog shows).  All Holiday Inns allow dogs, probably with some restrictions, but the Nickelodeon is run by Holiday Inn, at least it used to be.  When we stayed at that Holiday Inn my son and I both got several flee bites!

kUJ8XbPUaa	Different times, different cultures, different calender.|`|HIgoRYEwaa	Actually it is not American New Year, it is the New Year of the Western world which has been adopted by most of the world to have uniformity. Many cultures are having their own calenders.    The difference between the two is that of the calender. The new year in America is celebrated based on Gregorian Calender that is based on solar cycle. But Chinese traditional calender is based on lunar cycle and new year starts at a different date according to Chinese calendar.|`|LRSTXXaUaa	a lot.   well for 1- the "American New Year" is based on a 365 day year...while the Chinese Year is also known as the "Lunar Year" because it's based on phases of the moon's cycle.    ALSO to americans, the new year is all about...uh...another year to live...and maybe some "resolutions" that we hope to keep...to chinese people, the new year is a time to celebrate and visit your family. Their new year celebration usually lasts for 15 days and they even have many many days off of work, to travel to their home and visit their family. Different days of their celebration are meant to focus on different things. One day you focus on your family with you - another day you'll remember ancestors, etc.     the Chinese new year is especially special if it happens to be "your year." for example, i was born in Oct 1985, so my year was the year of the Ox/Bull. This is is also the year of the ox/bull...so this is "my year"...it's actually the second time in my life (other than my birth year) that this year has come up...so this is the completion of my second full cycle (i'll be 24 in Oct). Each 12 years is significant to chinese people.    there are tons of differences, too many to list - but i hope i gave you an idea.....|`|KfrYqRQNaa	The Chinese still celebrate the CNY because it's a custom.

pTLcvsVfaa	These questions are always hard to answer, because we really dont know your budget, or what kind of lifestely you lead.    But it sounds like you are planning to alot.     For a trip like that I would have at least 1500$ in cash just to be scure.|`|a08c52d63ce9f1a954dbe165d3bb5863aa	I think the other prices can be found online. I would suggest for the gambling, you don't gamble more than 1 month's salary for the both of you...that is usually good rule of thumb. ALSO, take out the money you will play with, and be set on it...NOTHING MORE.    As for eating, it is dependent on where you eat, how long you are staying in Vegas, etc. You might want to look into getting a limo from the airport to the hotel, as taxis cost almost as much. I think it was a $40 difference to get a limo with drinks and champagne from the airport to Caesars Palace.|`|e820051fee78ce7849c9936aa4289823aa	Cash is a BAD idea. A lot of places don't take travelers cheques either. I think the safest way to bring money with you is plastic. If you're worried about using your primary card, open a new account just for this trip, or get a pre-loaded giftcard with a major credit card companies logo on it.    Depending on where you want to eat, what shows you want to see, and how you want to gamble, you can spend $500 or you could easily spend $3000+|`|0nZdOtX1aa	ithink u must ask one person who live in vegas.|`|xif22nwoaa	It depends on:    1. What types of places you plan to eat in.  You can do buffets for all meals ($12 for breakfast up to $50 for dinner, most are in between), or eat fast food for breakfast and/or lunch, or eat nice places for everything.  Dinner can be cheap at fast food or Denny's, moderate at a buffet, or over $100 a person at a fancy place.  It really varies so much.     2.  how long you'll be there - a lot of people allot a certain amount each day for gambling, shopping, eating, etc.  That might make it easier to plan     3.  what shows you plan to take in - tickets are often in the $100-range for most big shows, but some are less and some are more.  And it depends on how many shows you want to see    4.  what type of wedding you plan to have - you can do it fairly cheap at a wedding chapel, or do a nicer affair through your hotel    5. how much you want to gamble - some people set a limit, often per day or often for the whole trip.  So you just have to decide how much you're willing to risk on your trip    6. Is the helicopter ride a tour of the strip (about $75 per person) or to the Grand Canyon ($250+ per person)?      7.  Shopping - there is great shopping in Vegas, so consider how much you'll want to do, if any.    There are just too many variables for anyone to give you a good definite answer.  But maybe that will give you some food for thought to help you better plan a budget.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	That all depends on what your going to do in Las Vegas. I would say a good 400 dollars, but minimum at least 200 dollars would be good.

Small markets on Fridays and Saturdays.  The Trent & Mersey canal runs pretty close and it's not far from a boaters' landmark called Fradley Junction.  There is Karting on site in Common Lane (off the A38)  The National Memorial is just up the road at Alrewas; the National Forest up near Branston.  Good Countryside, good pubs around.

MjGgICRiaa	http://skepdic.com/protocols.html    "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a forgery made in Russia for the Okhrana (secret police), which blames the Jews for the country's ills. It was first privately printed in 1897 and was made public in 1905. It is copied from a nineteenth century novel by Hermann Goedsche (Biarritz, 1868) and claims that a secret Jewish cabal is plotting to take over the world.    The basic story was composed by Goedsche, a German novelist and anti-Semite who used the pseudonym of Sir John Retcliffe. Goedsche stole the main story from another writer, Maurice Joly, whose Dialogues in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu (1864) involved a Hellish plot aimed at opposing Napoleon III. Goedsche's original contribution consists mainly of introducing Jews to do the plotting to take over the world.    The Russians used big chunks of a Russian translation of Goedsche's novel, published it separately as the Protocols, and claimed they were authentic. Their purpose was political: to strengthen the czar Nicholas II's position by exposing his opponents as allies with those who were part of a massive conspiracy to take over the world. Thus, the Protocols are a forgery of a plagiarized fiction.    The Protocols were exposed as a forgery by Lucien Wolf in The Jewish Bogey and the Forged Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion (London: Press Committee of the Jewish Board of Deputies, 1920). In 1921, Philip Graves, a correspondent for the London Times, publicized the forgery. Herman Bernstein in The Truth About "The Protocols of Zion": A Complete Exposure (1935) also tried and failed to convince the world of the forgery.    The Protocols were published in 1920 in a Michigan newspaper started by Henry Ford mainly to attack Jews and Communists. Even after they were exposed as a forgery, Ford's paper continued to cite the document. Adolf Hitler later used the Protocols to help justify his attempt to exterminate Jews during World War II.    The Protocols hoax continues to fool people and is still cited by certain individuals and groups as the cause of all their woes. "    Anyone who believes the protocols are true are really brainwashed to the point of no return.|`|5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	As the other Jews here have told you, the Protocols are a fake and were NEVER written by any Jews.  They were written by the Czarist Russians who hated the Jews.    And I see from the thumbs down about this, that the knuckle-draggers are out in force today.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	they didn't exist, there's no such thing. they are not jewish books, that's why they're unknown to jewish literature. anti-semites talk about them, but no one has actually seen them because they don't exist.|`|wdyf1sueaa	They were written by russians, I searched the web, they were never part of Jewish literature.  They are pure antisemitism, antisemitism at it's worst.|`|DTog0VZWaa	The protocols is a hateful anti-semitic piece of literature &  you've already shown that you know that.     Here's the details.  It's a hoax written by Russians at the request of the Czar in order to blame Jews & distract them from noticing how crummy their lives were.    It's is proof of how insane & how far anti-semtiism will go.  So when a person sees something about Jews that seems so insane it must be true, they can look to these & know, nope, human hate & slander CAN go that far.    A very detailed history of the "book":  http://www.holocaust-history.org/short-e...    A history of the history of it:  "http://ddickerson.igc.org/protocols.h...    ====================  Hey Tex  Are you really that out of it -- or just that hateful?  Jews don't know because it's false garbage.  You have to be losing it  to think "Jews don't knwo about it but it's Jewish literature."    John E  The majority of Jews in Israel are Sephardi & Mizrahi from Muslim countries.  (check the censuses.)|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Because they are total fabrication.

As a Little aside it is now believed that there are more translations in arabic than any other language - i'll leave others to speculate why that should be|`|5oSnj1eTaa	My dear friend the majority of the Israeli Jews are from Russia  I can assure you that these Protocols are the true ones.  Trust me on that  Greetings|`|NJnnVuzBaa	In Russian of course!  The jews who lived in Russia used to speak ...Russian.  Even today almost half the Jews in Israel speak Russian.  Soooo .......some Russian Jews wrote that book.  These protocols are not fake.  Just go on and read them.  You know I speak the truth here Son.  Don't you?  Steel|`|3llpQGcuaa	There's something fishy here.  You jew people seem to know a lot about some "unknown as part of Jewish literature"  Maybe too much, so I believe that them books are 100% genuine.  I downloaded some PDF versions to educate myself in jew history  Thanx|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	They were unknown because they are **not** Jewish literature.

Hence BBC and SKY did not advertise it.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	Because the Useless Nations is owned by the 57 member states of the OIC, the 22 member states of the Arab League, the 13 member states of OPEC and on and on. The dhimmitude of the spineless members of the UN is enough to make any sane person puke. They may as well have started the organization to appease Hitler.|`|Xgxjc5aFaa	I'm not sure what you are asking here.  Are you saying that Israel needs money, so why hasn't the UN appealed for money for them?  Or are you saying that Palestine doesn't need the money, so why is the UN giving it to them?  If it is the former, the UN hasn't done this for them because quite simply, they do not need it.  They are not suffering a humanitarian crises.  America gives all their tax dollars to them so they can buy all the weapons they need to quench their blood thirst.  If it is the latter, the reason is because Palestine is suffering a humanitarian catastrophe, and since the majority of their population is under the age of 18, they are in dire need of it.  Since Israel caused the humanitarian crisis, the UN will not reward them by giving them money, and ignoring the plight of the Palestinians.  Anyone who is sane, and has some compassion would realise this.  The lack of compassion shown here by our resident Fundamentalist Christian makes ME want to puke!|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Israel doesn't need their handouts.  They are an industrious people who are much more technologically advanced than the Arab world.  Individual countries do give to Israel in the form of armaments, i.e., Germany built and gave Israel 2 Dolphin Class submarines and Israel only had to pay for half of the third one.|`|R76ema39aa	Because Gaza needs the money. Israel don't.   I mean the money Israel will get will be spent killing more innocent civilians. All under so called "security reasons" of course    Whereas money sent to Gaza will help the many many people who are injured or homeless.     The BBC and Sky are wrong for not showing the DEC Gaza appeal. And the BBC is actually meant to be considered "mutual and unbiased". Well help is needed in Gaza! It's not needed in Israel right now - no life is at stake by starvation!  -  If you were really unbiased you would show it, so people would know where to send any money they can afford to give!|`|XuYPddLuaa	Someone's jealous.

Arieh, yeah Israelis are industrious all right - in getting handouts from the USA and Germany.  You call that industrious?  Without the US taxpayers' handouts, Israel would have disappeared years ago.|`|bmhnXEsVaa	Because the UN is primarily Pro-Arab, which translates into anti-Israel. Remember, the Arab League is involved & that includes: Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Libia, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Kuwait, Algeria, United Arab Emerites, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Mauritania, Somalia, Palestine, Djibouti, Comoros, Eritrea, Venezuela & India.

B3FBgxjEaa	"West Bank":   "The West Bank was only coined by Jordan in 1950 and was used till 1967 to delineate the area west of the Jordan River which had been seized by Jordan in the 1948 Arab- Israel War when Jews living there had been driven out by the Jordanian army. This new name operated to irrevocably sever any historic connection of the Jews with the place of their national birth and existence ."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank|`|l9RDuthbaa	No and yes, respectively.  The UN partition plan allocated an area that includes the west bank to the Arab country (which never came to be).  Parts of it were seized (and annexed) by Israel, and the west bank was seized (and occupied) by Jordan.  The UN subsequently recognized Israel in its new borders.|`|FcH2ZEkqaa	No. Cheers!|`|MjGgICRiaa	If by "west bank" you mean Judea and Samaria, then it belongs to the Jews either way.|`|nHuMeLtyaa	No, it was allocated to the Jews in 1919:    http://www.bible-light.com/BLON/V09-4_20...|`|lCW3Worpaa	Arieh, that map is VERY misleading.  The entire British Mandate was not intended to be Eretz Yisrael, as shown in this more accurate depiction from the Jewish Virtual Library: http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...    Lands east of the Jordan were closed to Jewish settlement in 1921.
HpJ4wwC7aa	The guy in that video is a total psychopath. Realizing that there are such insane people on this planet almost makes my stomach hurt. Is it human nature to desire death over life? I guess if you are a nuts or you are brainwashed by the nuts. If that guy desires death so much then maybe he should be the human shield he talks so proudly about.    And why do people that are anti-Israeli seem to like to paste the label of Nazis and Holocaust on them? I think it's because they know that it is the most disrespectful thing you could say to a Jew, and it touches on the core of their soul. That is awful. These people don't even know what a Holocaust is. An attempt to completely, and systematically, rid an entire ethnicity off the face of the planet is a Holocaust. 6 million Jews, 2/3 of their entire population were eliminated just because of their faith. The victims in Gaza were collateral damage from a war. There is no comparison. I guess everytime any civilians die in a war it is a holocaust. Oh wait, only if it applies to them. Spin doctors - all of them. I don't have any sympathy for a country that desires death so much. It would be nice to see a positive video of that place. A video that shows civilians not burning flags, stabbing voodoo dolls, shooting off guns, and screaming "death to all." I guess there are none.|`|ISxdNDeGaa	should I post "a question " about how the israelis loved the nazis to death, that now they are following them by their actions?|`|bmhnXEsVaa	It is challenging to avoid putting down the 'enemy' & being kind to them, isn't it?

If they follow a large group of people for a long time they may discover why some people may be more susceptible to diseases or heath problems, and find ways to stop them from developing.

mtmgMDMsaa	NZ is known for having beautiful scenary, friendly people, and lots of outdoor/adventures things on offer.    The place to get the most of scenary and outdoor activities i recomend the bottom of the south island. The famous milford sound, bungey jumping, jetboating and crystal clear lakes. You can visit Lake Matheson the mirror lake, it really does look like a mirror!... near fox glacier - also i must see. Go to coronet peak, mount cook, for skiing. And check out the laidback city lfe of Christchurch, go dolphin swimming, Orana park etc.    For a taste of NZ big city life check out Auckland it has plenty to do and see and great shopping. Check out the sky tower, rainbows end theme park, auckland zoo & more.    Taupo & Rotorua are also good, head up Mount ruapahu for the snow, experience maori tours and see mudpools , geysers and volcanic thermals,the huka falls & bungey jumping.    And there is plenty of jet boating, horse treks, walks, cruises, helicopters all over NZ, sky diving, quad biking and 4WD all over NZ.    & ignore the few rude comments about nz-.- thats what you get for this question ending up in the aussie section, lol.|`|C3sqTngtaa	Auckland, Rotatura, god there are loads to be honest! my gf is from there and funnily enough we were watching a video on it last nite.,  Looks amazing... best to go in the summer (our winter) as the weather is better|`|iuwLHT2Taa	I don't know but my parents have been there.

The people are very friendly and helpful|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	If you have the time, visit the lot!  The most Southerly point has a toe almost in Antarctica the Northern tip overlooking Stevenson's Island is sub tropical.   Hire a car, fly into South Island, and tour all the way up.  The scenery is fantastic (Lord of the Rings was filmed in South Island), swim with tiny dolphins, stay in hostels where you can cook your own meals in communal kitchens or push the boat out in Queenstown and rent an superb apartment overlooking the Lake.  Take coach and boat rides into the Sounds,(and fly back - that is an experience!)  wander around the mirror lakes, go up in the "Gondolas", Vist Christchurch.  Fly to North Island.  Spend some time around Auckland (The City of Sails - 1 in 3 New Zealanders has a boat) then head North (don't miss the funky loos on the way), take the Ferry over to Russell, visit the Treaty site and see the war canoe.  Above all, just fall in love with the Tree Palms!  The Kiwis aren't a bad  bunch either!

4INE794zaa	I just got home from the GP's a bit ago. My son has had a fever on and off, a rough cough, and sore throat for a few days now. I called my GP this morning, and asked if he could squeeze us in, or should I go over to the Walk In Clinic. He had time, so he told us to come on over. This was at no out of pocket expense. Nor would the Clinic have been.      Normally, for a common cold, I would not take my children to the Doctors. No point, as its a virus, and are non responsive to prescriptions. But my son has had past ear/nose/throat problems, so I brought him in. Turns out, he needs to see the specialist. The wait time? Tomorrow afternoon. That appointment will also not cost me over and above my tax dollars.      The wait here for an MRI is nominal, as it depends on the seriousness of your needing one. Obviously the treatment should go to those who need it the most, not those who have the most cash in their wallet. I love our system. I think its great, as it takes care of the little guy. Could it be improved upon? Sure, of course, definitely. There will always be people who fall through the cracks and thats unfortunate.      As for the cost of Surgery, I would really love to know how they arrive at such prices. I have friends who live out in Kamloops, whose little girl, 7 months old, is in need of open heart surgery. She will have it in Edmonton, on February 9th, but that made the parents nervous, waiting from Boxing Day, when they received the final tests back. They looked into having it done in the US, Seattle I believe. It would have cost them well over $200,000......Who has that kind of money laying around? And if you don't, how would you get your hands on it, if you were a lower income family? Not to mention she will need several operations over the next decade. There only hope would be to win the lottery as US citizens. We have fund raisers here to, when people are in need, but they are usually for things like covering the cost of the Family's stay somewhere, while their loved one receives treatment.     Since I live in the North, and there aren't a good deal of Specialists here, we usually are sent to Sudbury to see one, or Barrie, or Ottawa. I can claim my costs and be reembursed my out of pocket expenses to get there, be it by car, bus, train, what have you.      Hopefully Obama will have a hand in bringing the american people universal health care, as it really is a good system.|`|azypqsphaa	we don't pay any health costs directly, our system is funded thru income taxes, everyone citizen has "free" access..ex: my Mom just spent 2 months in the hospital, had surgery, physio, MRI, medications and then 1 month in a convalescent program to make sure she's ready to go home, we only had to pay $20/month for her phone|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	It is true that in Canada we don't pay for doctor visits, hospital visits (unless you want an upgrade to a private room), surgeries, and many other types of health care. Many of us still carry insurance, because we need to pay for things like dental care, vision care, and prescription medications. Our health insurance companies seem to be a lot different than they are in the Unites States. For example, I went for a massage just because I felt like it, and sent in a claim. I received reimbursement within 2 weeks, no questions asked. I recently had my baby in the hospital on a Saturday morning when many of the doctors offices are closed, and waited for about 15 minutes in the waiting room and was out of the hospital and home to feed my daughter within 1 hour, even after having to get x-rays. I really don't understand why the United States is so afraid of a health care system similar to ours. Even though I know that I have paid more in to taxes than I have gotten out of the health care system, I like knowing that at any time I can receive medical care and not have to worry about taking out a second mortgage on my house.|`|jXblvTG0aa	in canada if you are canadian, you don't pay to go to the hospital, you may wait up to 4 hours or longer in the ER to see a doctor, but it's free!|`|2wyDALHgaa	You are right.  In Canada with a valid health care card you can make a Dr appt and go without having to pay anything for the visit.  Now, if you need a doctors letter or something like that you will need to pay $20 or so depending upon the doctor but the visit is free.  Depending upon your doctor or your area you may need to wait a bit but normally if it's important they can squeeze you in that day or the next.  There are also walk-in clinics where you can go to be seen and while you may need to wait an hour or three its still free.  In an emergency you can go to the hospital emergency but of course your case will be prioritized.  They are not going to see your sore throat (which shouldn't be taken to the emerg anyway as it's not as emerg) over a heart attack or some critical care case.    For the life of me I can't understand why Americans don't want a similar system.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	You never ever pay out of pocket for a visit to a GP, or a specialist, or a surgeon, unless the surgeon is for something medically unnecessary. I'm about to have some plastic surgery done, not for vanity reasons but to repair the result of other medical treatment. Cost to me: $zero. I will probably have to pay for antibiotics and maybe dressings. Wait time for this, after seeing the surgeon for an assessment: about 3 months. I pay $54/month in health care premiums, although as soon as I file my taxes and have proof of low income last year, I'll get a refund on most if not all of what I paid in premiums last year. I can't imagine either why Americans wouldn't want this system. If I had to pay private health care premiums, in light of my medical history and the fact that I'm self-employed, I bet I would pay at least $500/month and no doubt get no coverage for anything to do with my previous illness, supposing anyone would cover me at all.|`|cHCsruZNaa	I am canadian and no we never pay for doctors visits.  We have a provincial healthcare plan that pays for it, we pay into it via taxes, so we have higher taxes however, we dont' have to pay for doctors visits.  There is pros and cons to either but I dont' ever have to think twice about going to the doctors cause i can't afford it.  We do have medical plans through our works that covers costs for massage therapy, physiotherapy, perscriptions and other such things as well as hopsital stays for private rooms and ambulance fees.|`|uqKpjV6qaa	It's free but we pay for it through our taxes. Some provinces have health care premiums but I don't think many do any more. The only problem with doctor and hospital visits being free is the long wait times. Some people clog up the system by going to the doctors or hospital when they don't really need to. It's a pain but at least its free (mostly).
orxhT7Ctaa	Because they're a hodgepodge of peoples and religions: Syrians, Saudis, Egyptians, Greeks, etc. The Palestinians are not a nation but peoples whose common language is Arabic (from Saudi Arabia with the Muslim invaders) squatting on territory which once belonged to the Jewish Nation. Moreover, they themselves never considered themselves a nation but as a stopover from Egypt to Syria or Iraq, and they in their hear of hearts know that this is true and that they are squatting on Jewish Territory which they have incorporated into their Muslim Empire.

They took the name but it was a roman group originally. palestinians are really muslims. to answer your question- there are 22 muslim countries [they dont let certain religions to even come into their country so yes that means they are religious nations]|`|mE4SbWIuaa	There was never a Palestinian nation because there was never a need for one until Israel was returned to the Jewish people.  Prior to the Jewish migration back to Jerusalem in the late 1800's and early 1900's the majority of the Arabs, Egyptians and Syrians in the territory were nomadic people who moved wherever the work was.  When the Jews began to return and develop the land there was more work available, so some of the nomads decided to stay.      Others fled to the area because the newly established Muslim governed countries feared that if the Jews ever outnumbered them, they would rebel and Jerusalum was a particularly sensitive area because they knew of the Jewish attachment to it. Many attempts were made prior to 1948 to quash any thoughts of a rebellion and especially the restablishment of Israel because the only way they could allow the Jews to remain in the Middle East was if they submitted to the authority of Islam.     But when the British decided to divide the territory and allow the Jews to reinstate the Nation of Israel, it was a humiliating slap in the face to the Muslim governments who for 1400 years have had and still have some very lofty ideas about ruling the world from the Middle East.  That cannot be done if there is a Holy Land other than theirs still in extistence, so they've launched one war after another to eliminate that problem.    Their plan is to never establish an actual nation called "Palestine" until they conquer Israel again; then it along with the Gaza Strip and the West Bank may still not be named Palestine, but it will be another Islamic country and there will be nothing left there that is Holy to anyone but the Muslims.

It shares borders with Kazakhstan to the west and to the north, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to the east, and Afghanistan and Turkmenistan to the south. Once part of the Persian Samanid and later Timurid empires, the region was conquered in the early 16th century by Uzbek nomads, who spoke an Eastern Turkic language. Most of Uzbekistans population today belong to the Uzbek ethnic group and speak the Uzbek language, one of the family of Turkic languages.

AA11341587	I doubt it.  And it's mostly hype.  Grow?  In what way?  Possibly make more money.      But the city peaked out in the 80's growth wise.  The pulp mill created a lot of jobs.  And when you consider each job meant another family and another home, that was a sign of growth.  But the mill closed.  They swithced their focus to port activities, but it isn't going to be equivalent number of jobs.  The port expansion is container shipping.  While probably efficient and profitable, it isn't the same number of jobs as older port activities.  The new port action is probably only bringing the jobs back up to what it was in the 70's.  Constructions phases create a short term injection into the local economy, but that doesn't last long term.    My understanding on port growth is as follows.  Phase I of the container ship is complete.  Phase II is postponed.  One major contract is in place.  Seattle has seen a dip in their port activity and plan on counter bidding on that contract.  Their is a Canadian Recession.  Their is a US recession.  Their is a World recession.  Sure, recessions are short term thinking and it's narrow minded to think it will stop long term growth.  But I estimate the world recession has got to set back Prince Rupert growth plans by about 10 years.  And that is if the recession is relatively short.
fdpKVScvaa	Manukau City is a collection of south Auckland (and some east Auckland) suburbs. It is "officially" a city, based on it's population but basically it is just the southern part of the greater Auckland region.    The suburbs that it includes are actually the most notorious for crime in New Zealand (such as Otara, Mangere and Otahuhu). But it also includes some of the wealthiest suburbs in New Zealand such as Howick and Botany.    Shopping there is interesting. There is one main shopping area with a large & very popular mall (Westfield Manukau City). Another huge mall is the "Botany Town Centre", which is an excellent place to shop. There are also several smaller malls scattered around the place. Another mall recently opened in Sylvia Park (technically this is in the Auckland district but it's right on the border with Manukau).    Manukau is interesting for it's diversity but you do need to be careful about where you go there. Certainly there are some places that I would describe as dangerous and others as really really nice.|`|mv0IKzEUaa	If you ever visit Auckland then by all means avoid South Auckland. (Manukau City is in South Auckland). There are a lot of Maoris and Islanders who live there and cause trouble. If you are shopping in Manukau Mall then dont carry large sums of money in your wallet or bag. These Maoris and Polynesians target vulnerable people for money even though most of them are already on the welfare benefit. I was once shopping in Manukau and when I returned back to my car I got attacked for nothing. Im not trying to scare you, Im just warning you. And Im definitely not being paranoid or blowing things out of the proportion. I recommend Botany Town Center. A lot safer.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Big. Polynesian influence is strong.

RbmfJX5gaa	The Australian population is ageging so the government decided that the only way to encourage more people to have more children is to offer financial assistance.    This has majorly backfired because the drug addicts and welfare bludgers are now having children and are receiving money for it. It is a complete joke.    The earth is massively overpopulated as it is. Encouraging people to have babies in one country is crazy. When will the government wake up to this fact ?|`|AA12305050	The reasons for the "baby bonus" have nothing to do with your simplistic sexist presumptions.    The Australian population has NOT been falling but increasing.    The Australian population trend is just the same as that of the US, UK and NZ populations as well as several other western nations in that the average age of the population is getting HIGHER.    This means that you will eventually end up with more people elderly and retired than actually working. The strain they put on the welfare and health system will be very bad for the economy as there will not be the tax funds to provide for them. This will not occur for perhaps another 20 odd years so the Australian government has been most forward thinking in creating the baby bonus to encourage people to have babies but especially make it more affordable for them to do so. This brings down the average age of the population. Understand? There are more and more women preferring to have a career over a family so it's an incentive. In addition everyone who is working gets compulsory superannuation which means that in the future there will hopefully be no need for old age pension or at least much less need for it. Thus tomorrows economy is being protected today.    The only reason the NZ govt hasn't done this too is because they cannot afford to. The US and UK govts just haven't thought of it yet but right now they cannot afford to do it either.|`|3jxBWMVeaa	Yeah nice options. Have a think about it next time you ask a stupid question.    NO to all 3.    They don't 'pay' people to have babies, if you're having a baby you get a SMALL amount to help with the costs of raising a baby. It takes around half a million to raise a kid here to 18. Seven and a half grand is not going to convince people to have a kid.    The birth rate has actually been increasing, we just have a huge 'old' population as well.|`|093c633e155de952249b95398f169e87aa	so they can buy a plasma tv to watch in bed when they make some more babies. seriously, the australian government decided to try to give an incentive to families to increase our falling population.  in recent years the birth rate has fallen so much and the population was ageing|`|Lt8UFEIoaa	I think their main concern was not wanting to take in more migrants to keep the population stable. In the last 20 years younger people have been having babies later in life, more people want to work and establish themselves financially before they have children and by that time its often too late and they only have one kid, or none at all as they left it too late in life, thus creating population decline.  Im in my early 30's and I have no desire to have kids, $7,500 from Kevin Rudd wont change my mind!!|`|5WP9rLTlaa	it has nothing to do wih the men! it was because we had a negative population growth rate and far fewer births than foreigners immigrating, native born Australians just didn't want kids. As to putting people into debt- those that have kids in order to get the baby bonus are not doing the sums before they get pregnant. I did the sums when I found out I'm pregnant (very happy accident!) and learnt than the baby bonus only barely covers the cost of disposable nappies! three years worth of disposables costs $5000!

I once saw an American family decide to drive a kid with a compound fracture of his leg all the way back to the USA rather than pay for treatment in Canada, because they didnt have travel insurance, The poor kid !!     You will want to see some of the East Coast, and travel to the West Coast, what are your plans for transportation ? What is your budget like? Where are you landing?    Do go to Vancouver Island and travel up island to Tofino and Long Beach, do Victoria, Vancouver, the Thompson Okanagan and then hit Jasper and Edmonton, go to Regina, a super place in the summer !  Take in a football game either in Edmonton or Regina.     You might be further ahead buying a second hand car in Canada and then selling it when you leave. Renting a car will be very expensive, especially if you are going to travel from one coast to the other, the mileage alone will kill you.    Train travel is expensive, and you cant stop and see the local sites. Greyhound can be dicy and again you cant stop to see sites, go swimming, pick fruit or whatever|`|sgclB6v9aa	The Okanagan  (a part of British Columbia in the west) is a very popular summer destination.  its a long mountain valley made up of beautiful lakes.  Definitely do some camping while you're there (anywhere in Canada).  Then make your way East to see the fall leaves turn bright red in Ontario and Quebec.     The best way to travel Canada with a family would be to rent a car, though that can be expensive.      Check out this website about fun festivals throughout the year.  There are lots of awesome childrens festivals!     http://www.2camels.com/festivals/canada....|`|q0rGhf0vaa	Canada is HUGE!!! I think instead of seeing it in terms of an entire country you have to see, you should try to figure out what kinds of things you like to do and where you want to stop in. Most major city festivals are finished by the end of August, so September through November will see the weather becoming gradually colder, and with somewhat less to do anywhere in Canada than there would be in the summer months.    Key stopping points might be:     - East Coast: Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island (for a bit of the 'maritime' experience).    - Quebec City and Old Montreal (for a bit of the French in Canada experience)    - Toronto (for a bit of the 'center of the universe' experience -- at least Torontonian's think so)... maybe a day trip down to Niagara Falls.    - Ottawa (the nation's capital, lots of museums and galleries).    - Calgary/Banff (modern western city, close to the mountains, and Canada's famous little mountain town).    - Vancouver (a metropolis clinging to the mountainside on the west coast)    - Victoria/Vancouver Island (a little piece of Victorian England transplanted to western Canada)    There are lots of interesting places in between as well --- but I think to do it right you need to pick a few key places you want to be, and then ask specific questions about what there is to do in THOSE places. It's a pity you won't be here in July and August, as there would be MUCH more to do!    Keep in mind that Canada can be very cold in October and November. It isn't uncommon, for example, to see days of -20 celcius even in October.     PS: I don't think you'd want to do the train ride across Canada... that to me would be nerve-wracking with three youngsters! :)|`|jpbHEsJaaa	not the gray hound bus
AA10604976	Last year beer got as low as 3 YTL. You can have cheap fast food meals. Although Marmaris is a popular spot, I still saw cheap accomodation advertisements on smallish hotels. I guess you will get more than your money's worth in Marmaris.|`|fhwVD2Yzaa	Well..........beer is still cheap depending where you go and at the moment still 3 or so ytl in the cheaper bars, the cost of a meal can vary from 5ytl for a large snack to about 18ytl for fillet steak.  Enjoying yourself costs as little or as much as you want, or can stand up for in bar street.  You will have a great time whatever you do, be warned it is different from Spain, there are still great bargains to be had, ie genuine copies of most things!!  Incidently, the exchange rate is about 2.30 Ytl to a pound, dont forget you will have to buy a visa(10) on entry at the airport, and you will get a good rate from here(check around) .

However, subject to requirements from the particular university and the major you take, if you continue with a business degree you may be given credit transfer or exemptions on some papers you have to take. Thus, this will shorten your course period and save your time and money. In this case, you'll have to check with the university on whether they recognize your diploma and how many credit transfers or paper exemptions they can give you.    You may take a totally different course, say, engineering, provided that you fulfill their requirements e.g. pass certain papers in SPM, STPM or A Level but then, it's a totally new thing and you will have to start from beginning.|`|PRE6MIBcaa	account, banking, law, management, human resources, tourism.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	Edinburgh's Beltane festival traditionally takes place on the 30th of April every year on Calton Hill.  30 April 2009 10:00pm - 1 May 2009 2:30am    "On the last night of April and first day of May around 12,000 people take to Calton Hill to have a big party marking the arrival of Summer. This revival of the ancient Celtic festival of Beltane is now in its third decade and continues to be very popular, in spite of increasing crowd-control measures and funding problems (meaning it is no longer a free event, except for under-12s, with tickets rising by 2 on 2006).    Traditionally, Beltane was the start of the pastoral summer where animals were taken from their winter shelter to the fields. In Edinburgh's revivalist celebration, three hundred voluntary performers celebrate the ending of the dreich Scottish winter and the (hoped-for) season of warmth and new growth with drumming, fire performance, revelry, and a ritualised procession around the hill.    Includes some nudity and "uninhibited behaviour."    Beltane tickets are 5.00 available from The Hub in person or online. A limited number of tickets will be available on the night for 7.00, available only from Calton Hill's Carriage Drive entrance, on Regent Road."    Although the website suggests that you can buy tickets on-line from the hub ticket sale site, you can't at the moment. You may need to visit the HUB in person or e-mail them direct for tickets.|`|zgTsCicNaa	Beltane tickets are 5.00 available from The Hub in person or online.

The Beltane Fire Festival is held every year during the night of 30th April on Calton Hill in Edinburgh. An audience of around 12 thousand people come to share the spectacular procession. Justifiably famous for its intensity and colour, the event has become a much-loved feature of the Edinburgh calendar since it was first organised in the mid 1980s. The Beltane Fire Society is part of a large and important culture both in Edinburgh and the rest of the world. We hope that our efforts will inspire others to get involved in celebratory works around the globe.

If it's student halls you're looking for and you're studying at University of Glasgow then I'd say definitely apply to Murano St - constant parties and you meet so many people in classes who ar from there.    The West End is lot's of fun to live in, it's very green and you always bump into someone you know on the street, it's hard to believe sometimes you're living in a massive city because the community spirit makes it feel like a village!

In other words, pure blatant lies and propaganda.    And you claim there is no comparison between spreading this fear and the fear that Hitler spread?  Guess where Hitler got his material.    Mein Kampf = My struggle or My Battle    Hitler states that subjugated peoples actually benefit by being conquered because they come in contact with and learn from the superior Aryans. However, he adds they benefit only as long as the Aryan remains the absolute master and doesn't mingle or inter-marry with inferior conquered peoples.     Jihad = My struggle or My Holy War    Sura (9:29) - "Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued."    Now tell us again who it is that has the globalist agenda and the compulsion to rule the world. tsk, tsk, tsk.  - - -   You people who grasp at any falsehood or lie to justify your illegitimate hatred of Jews have no shame.

It has been translated into Arabic and published several times, as well as being turned into a series for Television.   "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" purports to the record of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders in which they reveal their plan for world domination.   You will find those on the Internet who believe this to be the case.  (Nazi and Arab, anti-Israel sites).

Great post son, you are always welcome here  Steel    Edit  backup your Question and post here again, in case some folks decide to delete it.|`|MjGgICRiaa	http://skepdic.com/protocols.html    "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a forgery made in Russia for the Okhrana (secret police), which blames the Jews for the country's ills. It was first privately printed in 1897 and was made public in 1905. It is copied from a nineteenth century novel by Hermann Goedsche (Biarritz, 1868) and claims that a secret Jewish cabal is plotting to take over the world.    The basic story was composed by Goedsche, a German novelist and anti-Semite who used the pseudonym of Sir John Retcliffe. Goedsche stole the main story from another writer, Maurice Joly, whose Dialogues in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu (1864) involved a Hellish plot aimed at opposing Napoleon III. Goedsche's original contribution consists mainly of introducing Jews to do the plotting to take over the world.    The Russians used big chunks of a Russian translation of Goedsche's novel, published it separately as the Protocols, and claimed they were authentic. Their purpose was political: to strengthen the czar Nicholas II's position by exposing his opponents as allies with those who were part of a massive conspiracy to take over the world. Thus, the Protocols are a forgery of a plagiarized fiction.    The Protocols were exposed as a forgery by Lucien Wolf in The Jewish Bogey and the Forged Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion (London: Press Committee of the Jewish Board of Deputies, 1920). In 1921, Philip Graves, a correspondent for the London Times, publicized the forgery. Herman Bernstein in The Truth About "The Protocols of Zion": A Complete Exposure (1935) also tried and failed to convince the world of the forgery.    The Protocols were published in 1920 in a Michigan newspaper started by Henry Ford mainly to attack Jews and Communists. Even after they were exposed as a forgery, Ford's paper continued to cite the document. Adolf Hitler later used the Protocols to help justify his attempt to exterminate Jews during World War II.    The Protocols hoax continues to fool people and is still cited by certain individuals and groups as the cause of all their woes. "    Anyone who believes the protocols are true are really brainwashed to the point of no return.|`|wVsjgj35aa	They are a fraud; I have a copy of the original,titled "The Red Bible" published in a Philadelphia newspaper in 1919; there are no references to Jews.

52753f0eb1f1baf2fd8122008a9a228faa	There are small and cheap restaurants in Antigua to eat, also there are fast food restaurants like Burger King, McDonald's and if you want to taste local food you could go to the market or any small restaurant.... about the blanket.... do not buy it in a store, because sometimes they will charge you double for the same blanket in another place like the market, but do not pay what they ask you... ask for a discount, that is the way things work here.|`|8a1c4efde714f3448706c28696452e2eaa	We arrange Spanish programs for $200 per week which includes Private classes/ Host family accommodations/ 3 meals per day through http://www.spanishabroad.com/antigua1.ht...

xiMnj4f4aa	I always find it easiest to just use an ATM to get the local currency.  Usually the interbank exchange rate with the fee that your bank is going to charge for an international transaction works out to a fair rate.  Probably better than most exchange places.  But even if it is a bit worse, unless you are changing thousands of dollars, it is not going to cost you too lose too much in the transaction.  I'm sure the airport exchange house will trade loonies, but there is no assurance that they will be open.  Take enough USD to get you through a day.  People will take them, but probably give you a not so great deal on the exchange rate.  BTW, you'll call it a Q not a K - Quetzales.  Prices are shown like this 19Q.|`|AA10986891	Theres ATM"s that work with VISA and MASTER CARD credit cards. It would be easier for you to arrive with USD since there is a bank in the airport and you can change them for local money (QUERTZALES). Most hotels in the city will take USD as well as most restaurants and shops.    The wallet thing is a good idea.
fIK9LBEuaa	This is such a major problem. You can tell just from these boards how people have such a negative idea of the city. The economy is bad, yes. But it isn't the most dangerous city in the world! You don't get shot when your walking down the road a noon.    The reason they do it because people will believe that Detroit has such a bad reputation. For example, even if there was some fictional show, and someone got murdered in Detroit, well that's believable. But who would believe that someone got murdered in some town in Connecticut? The media just enforces the stereotype that it's such a bad place to live.    With the economy the way it is, yes, I can actually see why they could make that up. But for any other reason? No. There is great shopping, great people, great schools, nothing to be ashamed of.     It's not like this has just started. Detroit has always had a terrible reputation. My parents divorced when I was young, and my mom stayed in the suburbs of Detroit, and my dad moved to Canada where was originally from. The two places were only an hour away from each other; yet everytime I would leave to go to my moms, people would say things like, "Have you ever seen anyone get shot?" "Be careful, you might get robbed." "Do you ever go outside at night by yourself?" I could go on and on and on. Half those people had never been to Detroit, much less the suburbs. So, the only way they could have got the idea that Detroit was a terrible place was from the media.     My sincere hope is that one day, Detroit will get a good mayor who cares about the city more then himself. And he/she will do a great job to clean up the city, and improve the reputation of the entire state.     I'm tired of telling people I'm from "near Detroit", and I get those looks, like I'm crazy. How have you lived this long?     Anyway, I agree with you. Hopefully one day things will change!|`|dv8267AAaa	There has  been an article with diserable and non diserable places to live.

Detroit is not the most dangerous city any more. why don;t they pick on Camden NJ, ?   Camden N.J. has been named the nations most-dangerous city in the U.S.A.  TRENTON, N.J. - Camden has been named the nations most-dangerous city, snatching the top spot from Detroit, according to a companys annual ranking based on crime statistics.

They are not responsible for the woes of Detroit. If Detroit wants to fix the problem then start doing something about it. What little they have been doing so far hasn't worked.

Singapore City was founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company, who recommended that different areas of the town be set aside for the various ethnic groups. There are still fascinating pockets where more traditionally exclusive enclaves exist, principally in Chinatown, Arab Street, Serangoon Road (focus of the Indian community) and Padang Square with very strong colonial associations. The best way to experience the remarkable diversity of the city is on foot: the traditional architecture, customs and cuisine of the various ethnic areas are in fascinating contrast to the lavish luxury shopping arcades of Orchard Road and Raffles City.     Orchard Road is the 'Fifth Avenue' or 'Oxford Street' of Singapore, and just as bustling, with its vast luxury malls, shops ranging from megastores to vendors of souvenir tat, as well as cafs and restaurants. The corner bar of the Singapore Marriott Hotel, itself a landmark, is the prime spot to watch the world go by.      Arab Street is the centre of the Arabian quarter of Singapore, and a great place for shopping. Other streets with excellent shopping opportunities are Baghdad Street and Bussorah Street, while Sultan Plaza is a centre for cloth traders. The golden domes of the Sultan Mosque, Singapore's chief Muslim place of worship, dominate the area; nearby are two historic Muslim burial grounds.      Chinatown, though somewhat overwhelmed by the growth of the Financial District, is a bustling and colourful area with shops, teahouses and restaurants, and also several temples such as the *** Tak Ch'i in Telok Ayer Street and the Temple of the Calm Sea. Ancient crafts of calligraphy, papermaking and fortune-telling are practised, and traditional goods and foodstuffs can be bought. The characteristic domestic architecture of Singapore - the shop-house with a moulded front, shuttered upper floor and an arcaded street front - is much in evidence.     Serangoon Road is the centre of Little India, the Indian quarter stretching from Rochar Canal to Lavender Street. The Zhu Jiao Centre, at the southern end of Serangoon Road, is a particularly vibrant example of Little India. Other attractions in the area include the Sri Veeramakalimman Temple, the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hall in Race Course Lane and Farrer Park.      No trip to Singapore would be complete without a visit to Raffles, one of the most famous hotels in the world. A 'Singapore Sling' in the Long Bar is almost de rigueur; alternatively, drop into the Writers' Bar which provided inspiration for, amongst others, Noel Coward, Somerset Maugham and Joseph Conrad. The CHIJMES complex near Raffles was developed out of the former Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus, whose Gothic shell is the basis for a series of plazas housing chic shops, restaurants and bars. A statue of Sir Stamford Raffles has been erected on the banks of the Singapore River on the spot where he is believed to have first set foot in Singapore. Nearby is Parliament House, the oldest government building in the country, the core of which dates back to the 1820s. Boat Quay and North Boat Quay, flanking the river on both banks near the Raffles statue, has now become one of Singapore's most popular bar and recreation areas, with traditional shop-houses converted into restaurants and clubs. Clarke Quay forms a triangle defined by a bend in the Singapore River. It is a complex of colonial 'godowns' (eastern term for warehouses) converted into a maze of bars, outdoor eating places, clubs, souvenir shops and mobile stalls that present the 'Old Singapore' tourist experience at its most concentrated, if occasionally tacky. Riverside Walk, on the opposite riverbank, extends the zone further, and the whole area is a must-see for visitors. Mohamed Sultan Road, west of Clarke Quay, is Singapore's classiest bar and club stri     PARKS & GARDENS   The Botanic Gardens, over 47 hectares of landscaped parkland and primary jungle, are situated to the west of the city (Napier/Cluny roads), and are home to a wide range of animal and plant life. The gardens are particularly well known for orchids and they have the largest collection in the world. Opening hours are Mon-Fri 0500-2300 and until midnight at weekends and public holidays. Admission is free.      The Bukit Timah Reserve, established in 1883 and located northwest of the Botanic Gardens on Bukit Timah Road, contains Singapore's last stretches of original and immaculately manicured rain forest. The nature reserve also consists of tropical vegetation with clearly marked trails which lead up to Bukit Timah, the highest hill in Singapore. Admission is free.      Fort Canning Park, on Fort Canning Rise, was once an ancient fort of the Malay kings covering seven acres. Colonial ruins of the British citadel can still be viewed, as can a 19th-century Christian cemetery. The Battle Box in the park is the old command bunker of the World War

mtmgMDMsaa	Coming in winter is perfect if you plan to go skiing.  It's cold, rainy, foggy, is correct but not *always*. I don't know of any atrractions being closed. It will max 15 degress really, espicaily on the lower south island expect below the 10s, the North island usualy doesn't get that often. Don't get me wrong, though it is winter you still get alot of sunny days for those postcard pictures! they just won't be warm days. It's not actualy that rainy in Winter so it's said to be perfect to visit and seeing all the scenary, so you'll get your postcard pictures but not always.  If you don't mind the occasional rain and the cold, you should certianly come in winter.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Weather patterns in NZ are different for each region & it depends what you're looking for.  If you like film come to Auckland in July for the Auckland film festival & make sure you see a movie at the Civic Theatre & ask for a seat upstairs (it's an awesome theatre with a realistic looking night sky upstairs).  That is my favourite thing about winter in NZ, it's a great atmosphere with locals & tourists going to all the foreign films & personally I think our film fest is better than the famous Toronto one.  Do a google search for more info on the festival & google pictures of the interior of the Civic theatre.    Weather is unpredictable but yes you are likely to get the picture postcard stuff in the South Island during winter & in the Taranaki region of the North Island but for snow & alps & glaciers you're better off going to the South Island.  Make sure you do the tranzscenic train trips in the South Island, they have awesome scenery, you may have to book ahead for that so check with the tourist office.  In the upper & lower North Island it will be rain, rain, rain & fog most likely in Wellington & sometimes in Auckland.  It rains alot in Auckland & Northland in Winter & Autumn (Fall).  In the thermal region of Rotorua you will still get the thermal activity & geysers going all year round.      You don't say where you live, if you are from the Northern Hemisphere & just want to experience picture postcard snow scenes then you would find Switzerland similar to the South Island here & I can tell you that Montreal in Canada before Xmas time with all the decorations, etc is awesome & Quebec City is beautiful all lit up a night at any time of year.  Maybe these options are cheaper for you if it's only snow that you want?    The non snow areas of NZ are probably better in sunny weather, there are some fanstastic landscapes & beaches, particularly in the Bay of Islands, Northland, the Coromandel & around Auckland (West Auckland surf beaches, Waiheke Island & Auckland harbour for a cruise).  February is the truly reliable sunny month for NZ.|`|fagMeWXHaa	hey there.  i lived in new zealand for seven months & i loved it.  i wish i was still there.  The winter's in new zealand depend on where you go.   The North Island has a more tropical climate, where the South Island has a more normal sometimes cold climate.  New Zealand is like it is on the postcards, im not sure if any major attractions will be closed. Theres plenty to do, in the winter, if i were you. Skiing would be fantastic.    enjoy your trip if you decide to go.  hope i helped.|`|ZaQ8CYxyaa	Congratulations on choosing to come to New Zealand. As a New Zealander I can tell you its one of the most beautiful countries on earth.    It is definately worth visiting, even in winter. Winter in New Zealand isn't to bad temperature wise, and it only snows in high altitude areas or the bottom of the South Island, but you will still need a good coat and warm clothes. It does rain a lot more than in summer, but most days will have no rain, and unless you are unluky, will only have a few days of rain or showers in a two week visit. Fog does happen but is relatively rare, and if you do get it it will only be in early mornings.    No toursit attractions will be closed, but the chances of getting those picture postcard views will be reduced. Take it from me (and I have travelled everywhere in New Zealand) the weather definately enhances the scenery. A lot of the time those beautiful mountains will have clouds on the tops of them, meaning you can't see that much of them (yes, cloudy days happen in summer, but a fair bit more so in winter). The bush below is still excellent.    So I would advise trying to go in summer if possible (on the other hand we do have excellent skifields), but if not possible, definately still come.    I have no doubt you will have a great time in New Zealand.|`|DmcZn0T8aa	If you enjoy skiing or snowboarding then there is heaps to do in New Zealand during the winter. No I don't know of any major attrcations that are closed during the winter if anything the best places in NZ come alive in winter such as Queenstown that hosts the Winter Festival. But NZ is definitly beautiful in the summer also.|`|SzvP4VGaaa	To be honest I would try to avoid visiting in the depths of winter if possible.  It is possble that you could get a couple weeks of beautiful weather and all the views you came to see.  But it is all too likely that it could be pouring rain every day you're here. This past winter it rained almost every day in July and around 20 out of 30 days in June.  But back in 2006 I recall the winter being quite mild with little rain. You just don't know.    If at all possible you should try to visit in April-May or September-October.  That would avoid the peak season and you would get the cheap rates while avoiding the worst months.  The cost of visiting in NZ is always high because of the airfare so it would be awful to spend that money and be disappointed by terrible weather.      I can assure you that all major attractions will be open although getting to them could be tougher.  The state highway system in NZ is nothing like what you find in Europe or the US and the winding two-lane roads have been built straight over mountain ranges.  This means that in winter many major roads get shut-down by snow at the higher elevations, ruinin travel plans and forcing people to take longer routes.  SH1 over the Desert Rd is the most notorious for this, but it happens in many places.      Good luck planning your trip!  NZ is an amazing country to visit!
znr8ep4eaa	faliraki would be the last place to go.  it's like a colony of loud drunk cheap tourists. the only good think there are the prices, but it's not worth it.  try paros! (naousa) much better! lots of clubbing, any music you want. lots of young people!  and there's mykonos for partying too, but its expensive  you can also try ios. wonderful island, young people, backpacking, clubs etc.

Q6XYkUUNaa	Very nice place, nice coastline - but the humidity! Certain times of the year you can hardly breathe outside an air conditioned environment - leave the house is fresh clothes and literally withing 20 seconds you are perspiring so much you need a shower..|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	Well, you don't live in a city at present and Greater Brisbane is a city of nearly 2 million people, so that's one major difference but I live only 14km from the Brisbane CBD on green and bushy acreage with breathtaking views over farmland and bush so if you can find somewhere in the same type of area (there's plenty if you know where to look), you'll have the best of both worlds.     Brisbane is a very clean and  pleasant city with plenty of greenery and flowers (and parrots) all year around and there's plenty to do here. Shopping is good (maybe a little below Liverpool standards) and so is dining out, clubbing and general entertainment. Cost of living and accommodation is about average compared to other Australian cities.    Our traffic is pretty terrible and getting worse though a lot of the current problems are due to construction work on bridges, tunnels and busways that should eventually ease congestion. Public transport is excellent in some places and darn near non-existent in others. There are bikeways everywhere and many people use them though it's a very hilly city and you need to choose your route with care unless you're very fit.    Obviously, the weather here is a lot warmer that in the UK, but don't believe the people who've answered who rabbited on about our weather in summer. It doesn't get nearly as hot here in summer as in the southern cities, and it always cools down at night so that you can generally get a decent night's sleep if you have a fan. Our humidity isn't nearly as bad as people make out either and our average 3pm humidity is 53% (Sydney's is 54%). In any case, what people who don't live in the tropics don't realise is that if it's humid, a fan has an excellent cooling effect: when the humidity is low, a fan just stirs the hot air and has very little cooling effect. The fact is though, that even if our summer was twice as bad as people from elsewhere imagine it to be, our magnificent winters would more than make up for it. It can get a bit cool at night and early morning in winter, but nearly every day from early May through to October will be sunny and dry with blue skies and warm enough to wear a t-shirt and you'll be able to swim outside comfortably up until mid to late May and from early September.    Brisbane's beaches aren't very good (better than in the UK though), but we're only an hour away from some of the best beaches in the world to the north (Sunshine Coast) and south (Gold Coast) and the east (Moreton and Stradbroke Islands).|`|zYkf4J49aa	There are many diverse options for living here in Brisbane.  You have central Brisbane, which is a city, although it does have it's own beach at SouthBank.  You should look it up... streets beach, link below.    I live about an hour east of Brisbane, less crowded, more country area, but still good shopping etc.    It is difficult to say, as what is good for one may be bad for another.    Come on down, try it, stay of you like it, return if not.  Life is an adventure ;)|`|e77c54a2105590029b5c1b09151eef4aaa	Beaches are much better at Surfers Paradise and all those nicely tanned breasts don't hurt at all either !!|`|AksA9h3Aaa	The weather is obviously a lot different.  Brisbane is generally a "hot" climate.  But it's a good city that is definitely gaining a lot more respect and recognition now adays.   If you're living within a 10km vicinity to the city centre there is easy public transport and plenty of shopping centres/restaurants to keep you occupied. It's cheaper to live in Brisbane compared to say Sydney and Melbourne.  Some bad points about Brisbane, I'd have to say the heat sucks in Summer, so aircon is a necessity. There is no beach near the city, so that is a little downside compared to other capital cities.     Airlie Beach is beautiful, but I don't think I could live there, as I like what a capital city has to offer.   The Gold Coast beach is about an hour drive South from Brisbane city, and Sunshine Coast beach is about an hours North from Brisbane city.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	I've lived in England Wigan and Cumbria so I know your area . It all depends what sort of a life style you are used to or if you are adventurist . No one could say if you would like it here that all depends how your luck goes for work I guess. I love it here down on The Gold Coast 1 hour south of Brisbane. i love Queensland and the weather. i don't want to live in a cold area ever again. so much more casual and outdoor living here. The job market is very competitive at the moment . Many thousands of people have lost there jobs in recent times So it could be scary moving over and giving up your way of life or it could be the best thing you have ever done. It's the old saying if you never never go, you never never know. Good luck|`|RIQGuSMWaa	Hi Jordan, we moved to Brisbane from Scotland last July and it's the best move weve made.There are loads of houses for sale and for rent and a lot cheaper than the UK.The climate is good,great shopping,lovely beaches nearby.Nightlife if you want it and loads of quiet pubs if you don't.Of course you get the usual yobs same as everywhere but mostly the people are very friendly and very helpful.We have both got jobs and bought a lovely wee bungalow for half the price we would have had to pay in the Uk.Good luck!|`|Yfp74Xqtaa	Honest opinion: Brisbane is very suburban. Everything about it.   Yes you will find the place very cheap and servicable etc although as others have pointed out it can get very hot and there's no beach in sight.  You will have to deal with more than just physicality and logistics, there is culture too, though you may just fit in fine. I found the culture better in Sydney, Adelaide and espec Melbourne and Canberra.

dd30d07061d6ae74b156e18ca10ad7e2aa	I'm not Australian but as a full-time barefooter in Europe I have to comment on some of the anti-barefoot comments here. I always go barefoot at the mall, as well as everywhere else. It isn't gross or dangerous to anyone.    Injury is very unlikely; I've been barefoot for over twelve years, I get a tiny splinter maybe once a year, and I've NEVER had a cut. In the unlikely case it will happen, tetanus has had a vaccination since the 1920's which really everyone who's even remotely active outdoors, gardening or around animals (including pets) should keep up to date; there are other ways of catching it apart from stepping on something barefoot, but there's never been a case of the disease in a vaccinated person in my country. More serious injuries can happen but are very rare and thus no real reason to avoid going barefoot. I've injured my hands pretty bad at times, yet no one suggests I wear gloves all the time. I've fallen from shoe laces when I still wore shoes, yet no one suggests never wearing laced shoes again. Sports injury? "When can you play again?" is the usual reaction. Also heard of places which require shoes for 'safety reasons' but are fine with (very) high heels... sure!    Our skin is made to keep pathogens out, and unless you lick your toes or put your feet on the dinner table, we're at far greater risk of catching something through our hands than through our feet. The dirt on door knobs, shopping carts, railings etc may not be as visible, but there are just as many or more germs on them. And with our hands we are more likely to transfer germs to our food and face where the germs can enter our body. There's also much evidence that exposure to a limited number of germs is even a good thing; children from households that are too clean are much more likely to suffer from allergies and asthma, and may catch sick more easily than people who keep their immune system active at a low level. I used to fight colds all winter, coughing and sniffling from early fall until late spring, but in the years I've been barefoot I've called in sick only once, for all of two days.    (This goes even for hospitals and medical centers. I unfortunately have had to visit them many times in the past years accompanying my mother, met dozens of doctors, and NEVER had a negative comment from ANY of them. Even in the US, where anti-barefoot bias is very common & online barefoot friends sometimes get told off for being barefoot by store employees, the comments from their doctors are usually either neutral or positive!)    As to bare feet being disrespectful or just unpleasant to look at, a lot of people think anything that goes against the social norm is disrespectful. Wearing a hat/not wearing a hat, piercings, tattoos, almost any alternative dress can be called disrespectful. I think this is very unfortunate; alternative appearance makes life more interesting and colorful. Imagine we were all the same! I happen to *hate* the sight of wetlook gel; I think it doesn't look wet, it looks greasy. But I wouldn't dream of banning it or even ask someone who sat across from me at a restaurant to sit some place else. I see it as *my* problem and I know it's not going to jump off someone's head and get me (and gel is at head/eye level, rather than on the floor where you don't look most of the time anyhow). Besides, in flipflops/thongs you also see the entire foot, while the most important thing to me is feeling the ground underfoot.   Bare feet have the additional downside that many people associate them with pool, beach, such informal situations, as well as with foot odor. Personally, I think bare feet are far *more* respectful than the most expensive dress shoe can ever be. Barefoot, you touch Mother Earth gently, you're aware of where you tread, you are more conscious of your surroundings.    Macpark Melting, it is NOT against the law to go barefoot in ANY store, restaurant etc in the US. This is a very common myth, but it's still not true, please see the second link in my sources. Any store can set their own dresscode but those that claim it's 'by order of the Health Department' are either misinformed or just plain lying. Nor do insurance companies have any rules against it, barefooters have checked out many policies and not found even a single one that as much as advised people to make customers wear footwear. All urban legend.    Aussie Baby, please see the start of my first paragraph, broken glass isn't as big a hazard as people think it is. And *occupational* safety laws do, as the name implies, apply to employees only, not customers.    As for speaking another language in public, it doesn't bother me. I've always learned it is rude to listen in on other people's conversations, so I'm not really supposed to listen to what they're saying anyhow, now am I? :-)|`|Fnp2MIycaa	Yes, some people prefer not to wear shoes.  I don't understand why but it's reasonably common in some areas of Australia.    I don't mind people speaking in their native tongue.  What I do object to is when they are obviously talking about other people around them.  That's just plain rude. I don't think they would be doing it if they were speaking English.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	It's appalling to think of people actually walking around barefoot in the grocery store.  Here in the United States that is against the law.  Only a hillbilly would THINK to walk around a store in bare feet.|`|QQbbReRAaa	Yeah, thats pretty normal. Though I was with my brother once when he got evicted from a shopping center for having no shoes on, lol. It it's hot, then it's OK. If not, then sorta strange.   It does get on some peoples nerves, but then I lived in Japan for 7 months, without getting to know the language that well, then I was one of these people!, lol. But yeah, as has been said, if your just having a convo, and not obviously bagging anybody, then it's fine|`|Likst1Mxaa	I reckon it depends on where you are.    Barefoot=bogan. Aussie land is too hot to walk around without shoes on. Also, two words - broken glass! I worked in a supermarket for five years and I'm pretty sure you could ask people to leave if they had didn't have shoes on. It's call occupational health and safety!! I'm not talking about workers (obviously they wear shoes), but customers can run more risks if they don't wear soes. It's as simple as that.    Re people speaking in their own language - we live in an english speaking country. If you're in public speak in English. It's just not that hard!!!    I quit my last job because I was working in an Aussie owned/managed store but I got sick of Indians workmates not speaking in english in front of me (when they were perfectly fluent in it too). Speaking the english language = respect for others around you.|`|ScLAUvYfaa	It's not abnormal to be barefoot: it does depend on the area though.  I used to live in a studenty type area of melbourne, and people did it all the time.  Where I live now, however, it would be considered very strange (different suburb in melbourne).    As for speaking your own language, of course it's not rude.  It does depend on the context though, I guess: if someone was pointing at me and laughing while talking in a language other than those that I speak, I would consider it rude.  If they're chatting amongst themselves, dont' see how it can possibly be rude....|`|sZFA4XXZaa	That is just disgusting. It is a supermarket, not the beach. Can't wear shoes? Wear thongs! I have no problems with people speaking in other languages. As long as they are not using it to talk about other people thinking they can't understand and aren't too loud.    People can question us like that too if we went to another country and spoke English. It works the same both ways.|`|JoC6dlASaa	Here in QLD, it is a daily observation. Not only supermarkets but petrol stations, footpaths, in the streets and the most disturbing of all in medical centers and surgeries. I once saw a mum and dad with their infant who had come in to get the baby's shots and BOTH of them had no shoes! In a medical center!, obviously, they had no concept of germs or hygiene. And this is in SE QLD, not far north QLD.  So in my daily life, not only do I see males and females both groups young and old but kids and even toddlers running around inside shops with dirty, dirty barefeet. The worst is old men with crusty, dirty feet walking around a shop barefoot! Ugh.  Note to Ozmaniac below: I do not live in some Bogan area of SEQLD, I live in Aspley. Obviously, you must never leave the CBD of Brisbane if you don't see people without shoes on. It is a common everyday occurrance in the suburbs of SE OLD.|`|IkWcwsj8aa	probably a dirty bogan! they cant afford shoes, all their money goes towards drugs    and as for speaking non english in public i couldnt care less, as long as its not about me|`|l33RXBQjaa	Australia is a fairly barefoot friendly place, due to its warm climate and culture.  There is nothing wrong with being barefoot, anytime, it is healthy, much more hygienic and safer than wearing shoes.  To associate bare feet with homelessness is actually inaccurate, most homeless people indeed wear shoes, due to their very low price, and others willingness to donate old shoes to a homeless person they see.  It is very rare to see a homeless person walking barefoot, unless it is by their own choice.    speaking a different language in a public place tends to make others uncomfortable, because they could be talking about anything from murder to how ugly someone near them is, while this typically is not the case, people tend to fear the unknown, and people also tend to fear    people different than themselves.  These are just common tendencies, and while not all people automatically make such assumptions, it does indeed happen much of the time.  I hope you found my answer helpful.

jek0fdTfaa	With regards to jobs, I would suggest either Calgary or Toronto. Both cities are doing relatively well even through the current economic crisis. The deciding factor depends on your preference for city life or outdoor life. As you specifically mentioned outdoor life, then you'll likely prefer Calgary since it is so close to Banff and Lake Louse ... it's absolutely gorgeous there!|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Well, I think that I should stick up for Saskatchewan. There are a ton of jobs here right now, and the cost of living is fairly reasonable. Saskatchewan is called the land of the living skies, because the land is very flat, and in the summer, the sunsets are more beautiful than anywhere else in the world. Also, Regina and Saskatoon have everything you could ever want, and both cities are really easy to get around in.    If you are stuck on the mountain idea, why not look at a place like Banff? It's a beautiful tourism community right in the mountains practically on the border between Alberta and BC. It's also a pretty close drive to Calgary. I would say that if you want to do BC avoid Vancouver and go for Victoria or Kelowna instead.|`|Twzg9s0caa	Whistler is pretty awesome.

It may not be the cheapest city, but it's cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto by far! Also, Calgary was ranked the number one cleanest city in the world by Forbes in 2008! Enjoy coming to Canada!

AksA9h3Aaa	Maybe you could try ringing the school office a few days before school starts. The office staff are usually there a couple of days before hand.   Or the schools website. :)
ScLAUvYfaa	Your major considerations should be:  a) how near/far to campus you would like to be  b) how you are going to travel around (car? bike? walk?) and how much this will cost you  c) what services you would like in your area (funky cafes? nice parks? etc)  d) how much time you're going to need to commit to study  e) how much time you're going to be able to work, and how much money you'll be earning.    $160 is actually not outrageous in Melbourne.  Around the major city campuses of universities, rent can be very, very high.  You will possibly struggle to find a place in the inner suburbs (there's a very low vacancy rate), so you may have to head out a little bit: if you're going to Melbourne/RMIT or city Monash campuses, you could try places like Preston, Coburg and Brunswick. Maybe even Collingwood, Abbotsford, clifton hill, northcote.  Closer in, perhaps carlton, fitzroy, and those regions will be very expensive.    If you're going to uni on the other side of town (at Monash caulfield or clayton), you should have a little more luck with properties.  Caulfield itself is still quite pricey, but not as much as the inner suburbs.  Some places around Chadstone can be quite affordable.  Public transport out that way is not so good, however.     A good place to look for vacant rooms is on campus: most unis have a noticeboard somewhere where people advertise for flat-mates (at Melbourne Uni, it's in Union House).  Clearly, you'll be living with strangers, but sometimes that can be best.  IT's good because they're people who are advertising specifically to students.  Another place is the window at Readings bookshop on lygon street, carlton.  Try http://melbourne.gumtree.com.au/  .  domain.com.au and realestate.com.au both have sections for people looking to rent, including ads put up by people who are already living in houses and want someone to share with (which is easier than looking for a completely empty house!).     I would consider finding yourself a job if you don't already have one, as it is comforting for people who want you to rent with them if they know you can actually pay.  Also, if you've got some personal references from people who can testify to what a nice person you are and how you won't destroy the house, that'd be good to (it's best if it's from a pervious landlord, but given that you're moving out of home for the first time that's not possible, clearly!).     When you do find a potential place, check it out on www.streetdirectory.com.au, to see if it's close enough to public transport, etc, to suit your needs.    And finally, be prepared to take  a lifestyle hit!  It's expensive living away from home, particularly when you can't work full-time because of uni.  But it can be very, very good fun, even with no money (I once lived on toffee for a few days whilst waiting for payday, having had one too many beers with friends that week!): a lot can be said for taking a cheap bottle of champagne and a salad to the park with friends.    You'll have a ball, promise!

As as my children grew and no longer came with me, Protaras still has everything and it's all in one place, The restaurants, the beach the bars are all within walking distance, As for recommending hotels do you want self catering, half board, all inclusive, if you would like you can email me and i would try to suggest hotels and their location.|`|o23XunO0aa	Everywhere..I would suggest you Aghia Napa,Protaras, province of Larnaca|`|KxLTslRRaa	Protaras is definately the best place for families!!    Most of the hotels are situated along the shoreline of Fig Tree Bay, and Flamingo Bay, nice sandy beaches,  and are all within easy walking distance of a good selection of shops, bars and restaurants ( try Cafe Parko, Island Affair, The Olympus, Sonias, Il Basilica)    From here, you're just a short bus ride/ taxi/ drive from Agia Napa and all its beaches bars and restaurants, and, no, its not all clubs, lager louts and booze cruises....and Napa has Europes largest waterpark too.    Be sure to take in Larnaca, Nicosia, The Troodos Mountains, and a trip to Paphos too!!!    Take a look at The Sunrise Beach Hotel....fairly central....and good for families!!

It is a place surrounded by beautiful beaches and remains sunny throughout the year. The place has extremely friendly people all around and is full of restaurants and bars. With all the beauty surrounded, Villas in Cyprus are the best means of enjoying the place and the stay.    Cyprus Villas are generally located nearby airports and offer visitors the type of stay they are interested in. Different villas options are there to choose from. One can rent a villa in Easter coast or the western coast depending upon ones own likes and dislikes. The stay also depends upon the amount one is willing to spend. While going there on a honeymoon trip, one may want to rent out a luxurious villa, whereas when on a family outing one can hire a vocational or holiday villa.    Many of these Cyprus villas are second properties owned by private individuals for their own use. The people rent these villas out to holidaymakers to help with some of the costs or even as payment towards a mortgage. They rent these villas to pay their loans or to run their livelihood, although the cost of living is minimal in Cyprus. Hence, one can get all the benefits of luxury accommodation without the hassle of staying in a hotel with hundreds of other guests. The trade off is that you will be in some ones home instead of a luxurious hotel.    Most of Cyprus Villas offer the range of 2-10 bedrooms. These villas are equipped with all the necessary equipments. Many of these offer the food and cooking facilities as well. In that case, the kitchens have all needed amenities like coffee machines, grillers, toasters, tea makers, choppers and at times utensil cleaners as well. The Villas have sofas, arm chairs, wooden beds, curtains, heaters, TV sets, AC and proper sanitary facilities. Numerous Villas provide balconies to view the seaside as well. For guests having some physical problems, wheel chairs are also provided.    Reservation for these Cyprus Villas can be made either though the Internet or through the agents. Normally, booking through the Internet can be more convenient for the visitors. This can save them time and money. However, one can search online on any search engines, such as google, yahoo etc. before fixing any deal with a company renting a villa. Research will give you an idea of the price that you should normally pay and the place that would be the best to stay around.    Research should also be done regarding the location of the Villa. Villas should not be located in a very secluded place, as this would keep you away from the best shopping areas and the heart of the city. One should always try to find villas in the heart of the City. Paphos and Eastern coast region are a few places that one should look over to.    Cyprus villas are the perfect solution to ones holiday needs. Whether you are in the mood to explore the Island or just chilling-out with your own private pool with a beer or two, there is nothing else than a villa that you can think of. If you don't feel like cooking, you can go to plenty of restaurants, where you can get a great meal and later spend a relaxing evening on your own balcony with a good book. It gives you proper relaxation and privacy.    All in all, Cyprus gives you a wholesome package of a great holiday and a wide variety of options to choose from, irrespective or your age, sex or preferences. It is up to you to choose the best available option according to your time, budget, group and lifestyle. That is the main beauty of Cyprus that there is always something for everyone.

Jm3vMKx3aa	25 European countries have decided to open up their internal borders and allow foreign business and tourist visitors to travel to all those countries on just one visa.    The member countries of the Schengen zone are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.    Citizen of other European Union countries which are not party to the Schengen agreement may travel to the countries of the Schengen zone without limitations. Those are: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland, Romania, and the United Kingdom.    Citizens of certain countries do not need a visa for business or tourist visits for up to 90 days in a 180 day period. Those are: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Macao (SAR), Malaysia, Mexico, Monaco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, San Marino, Singapore, South Korea, USA, Uruguay, Vatican City, and Venezuela.    All others need a Schengen visa to travel to the Schengen zone. There are three type of commonly issued visa.    Airport transit visa (type A) may be required by certain nationalities to transit through a Schengen airport even if they stay in the international area of an airport. The requirement for a Airport transit visa is not standardized. Each Schengen member country may determine which citizens need a visit to transit through their airports.    Transit visa (type B) are valid for five days and issued to residents of non-Schengen countries to travel through the Schengen zone to reach their home countries or vice-versa. Example: a citizen of Bosnia & Herzegovina who works in the United Kingdom on a work and residence permit and wants to drive home by car.    Tourist, visitors, and business visa (type C) are the most common used visa. They are valid for up to 90 days in a 6 months period and may either grant single, double or multiple entries to the Schengen zone. Tourist and visitors visa are mostly issued as single entry visa based on the itinerary provided. Double ntry visa are used to those applicants who want to visit a non-Schengen country on part of their trips for example staying in France and going to London over the weekend, or staying in Slowenia and then want to go to Croatia before entering Hungary. Multiple entry visa are mostly issued for business or for well known tourists who already got several single or double entry visa.    Visa must be applied for at the Embassy or Consulate of the country the visitor plans to spend the most time. The application must be made at the Embassy of the first country to enter the Schengen zone if the duration of stay should be equally distributed.    For the application certain requirements must be met. The passport of an applicant must be valid at least three month beyond the proposed stay in the Schengen zone. The applicant must have a travel sick insurance which covers at least 30.000 and includes hospital treatment and emergency repatriation flights in case of severe illness. The applicant must proof the ties to his country and convince the consular officer that he/she is leaving the Schengen zone when the authorized number of days to stay has reached. The applicant must provide an itinerary, a confirmed round-trip flight ticket reservation, a confirmed hotel reservation, and must provide the proof of sufficient funds to cover the stay.    Application requirements may be slightly different depending upon the location of the Embassy. Tourists of countries known for visa violations and illegal overstay may have it harder to get a visa than a business-man of a country with solid financial means like the Emirates for example.    Besides the commonly issued Schengen visa there is a national visa (type D) which is issued by an individual nation for longer stay in that country for other purposes than business or visit. This is issued for students, temporary workers, au pairs, fiance or spouses and may aalso be combined with the type C visa, a so called hybrid visa.

Note that it is not all EU countries that are apart of the Schengen agreement (the UK for instance) and there are also non EU countries that participate (like Norway). This means that if you apply for a visa to Norway you get a Schengen via and this will allow you to also go to other Schengen countries without having to apply for a visa to each country. You can read more about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Ag...|`|JF343E2Taa	i think its for eu countries for people to be alolowed to travel to them its free i think good luck|`|HxcTuTSQaa	Schengen zone is the territory of the countries associated by Schengen treaty.

Because if you are you not need a visa to visit the EU as a tourist.    A Schengen Visa is a Visa to the European Union - and Not the UK.  You would apply for it at the embassy of the first country on your travel plans.  If you would like to go to the UK, you should apply at the British Embassy in your country.

Nothing beats Disney World.   My boyfriend and I (21 years old) both stayed in a value resort May 2008 for 10 days. flights, 8 day park hopper passes + waterpark option, hotel for 10 nights... cost us less than 2,500$.   When you stay at a disney resort hotel you get free transportation to all of the parks and to and from the airport if you request. So there was no reason for us to get a rental car. If you'd like to venture out to Universal Studios and other places in orlando (bush gardens)...then you might want to get a rental car.     I booked my trip about a little less than a year in advance, and I did a LOT of research. We thought that staying on disney property in a disney resort would be too expensive, but actually the VALUE resorts were cheeper than staying at like the holiday inn or any other surrounding hotel that i was able to find.       Go to Disney.com and you can get a quote for the price and plan the whole trip online if you wanted to. Its an awesomely fun trip!!     Have fun!!    **Edit:  I should add that the close attention and detail that Disney gives everything is one of the things that makes the trip so amazing. Everything is SO carefully cared for and detailed...the landscape (a few times we werent sure if the grass was real!! it was though..), the themed pools that you get when staying at the resort hotels, the details in the rides like haunted mansion, peter pan, and its a small world...all lthe rides! Its just so amazing. And not to mention the firework display put on EVERY NIGHT in the magic kingdom. The parks at night time are all AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL!!!|`|houzTS8Zaa	In my book nothing beats Disney. Everything from the thrill rides to the corny kid rides are great.

QxzpEfhKaa	I'm going on my first cruise next week.  I'm excited as well!  You can prepay your gratuities (that's what I did), but in general I've been told to budget about $10 per day.  It doesn't include the maitride (sp?) or the porters who handle your luggage (about $1 per bag).    Don't forget Carnival allows you to bring 1 bottle of wine per person on board, checked in your luggage.  You can bring your own corkscrew, and it will be free, and if you bring it to the dining room, there is a $10 corking fee.  Check with your cruiseline if it's not Carnival to see what their policies are.    You can also charge drinks to your room card (which in turn charges it to your credit card).  I'm budgeting about $200-$250 for drinks, and am bringing another $200 for anything I want to spend on land (restaurants, trinkets, etc).  I plan on drinking quite a bit, but plan on taking it slow throughout the day, and switching gears at night, if that helps.|`|nWWs9OB2aa	i wouldnt worry about tipping its already deducted from your account per day. the house keeping staff usually goes way out of their way to accommodate you but other than that its already taken out. Your servers and house keeping get 10 a day, the bar tenders get tipped every time you get a drink. i wouldnt tip the maitre' d  at all, he never shows up till the last night anyways.     as for drink money, the wife and uuall average about 500 for a 5 day cruise. the drinks are not outrageous but we do drink a lot. Plus when youre out to sea theres not much else to do and youre on vacation. also nothing gets rid of that hangover like more booze!|`|dMoqddvRaa	$200|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	The basic cruise fare includes your room, meals in the regular dining rooms and buffets, room service, shows, and most ship facilities. Many ships also have free pizza, ice cream at various times. sushi, and hot dogs and hamburgers.    The extras are first tips. Figure about $10 per day per person for the tips to the room steward and wait staff. This is optional and some cruise lines automatically charge you. It can be adjusted or reversed at the end of the cruise. You should also tip a few dollars if you use room service. All bar drinks will have 15% added for a tip.    Many ships have alternate dining facilities that have a service charge of $15 on up. It may be a steak house or an Italian restaurant for example. There are also specialty coffee bars that have a charge. All bar drinks including sodas have a charge. The only free bar drinks are at the Captains Reception and the Repeat Cruiser Reception. Do not assume that the drinks being offered when you board are free. They are not. Bar drinks are $6 and up. Some ships are even charging for juice at any meal other than breakfast.    Some cruise lines sell a soda card for about $4 a day. It is only for fountain soda. Unless you have 3 sodas a day it is not worth it. You can also buy a specialty coffee card which gives you 15 for about the price of 12.    There is a charge for any personal service such as laundry, salons, private trainers, etc. Spa treatments are very expensive, $50-$100. There is also gambling which includes the casino, bingo ($10-$20 per session), and sometime deck games such as horse racing. A ship photographer will be taking pictures all over the ship and at special occasions. They cost over $10 each. Phone calls in the room are about $8 a minute. Some ships have cell phone service. You are charged for international roaming by your phone service at about $2.50 per minute. There is also a charge for using internet service on a ship but it is cheaper than phone calls.    Sundries are very expensive. Figure at least double the normal price. If you need a watch you will find no better prices anywhere.    Off ship excursions are expensive. They start at about $30 and can be in the hundreds. You can book them on the ship or go on your own. The ship will not leave without you if a cruise excursion is late. With one you did on your own they will not wait.    ? ??l???q ?|`|f55f047934182c2d6e633d01e2bbbe1daa	Cabin gratuities are $10.00 pp per day.  NCL is now $12.00 pp per day.

The best places to live for college students is Belmont Shore & Belmont Heights.  Those areas will cost you around $1500 a month for rent.  If that's not feasible, then probably try to find a place near CSULB.    Long Beach is a city of close to 500,000 most of that is a very nice suburban city.  Of course, in a city of that size there are places that are more unsafe.
9ri2oPNBaa	get the first possible flight to Lebanon get her and go back together if this is her will her parents should respect her decision, and come on we all know that since they send their daughter to the US to learn they don't expect her to go back and work in Lebanon and this a fact.|`|FDjn05cNaa	It's complicated but that's Romance Lebanese style.....    As has already been stated , her family would be concerned for a number of reasons ...to name a few ..    1...They would be scared they may never see their daughter again  2...They would always prefer that she marries a Lebanese man with the same religion as her..  3...The don't know you & may have preconcieved notions as to your suitability  4...She may not have told them about you ....at least not all the details  5...The age difference is a real thing in Lebanese culture...they want someone who can provide well for their daughter       None of these issues may be insurmountable but you'll never overcome them without  them having the opportunity to meet you & get to know you as a person  as well as some reassurance that you have a good future that you could share with their daughter...|`|b05ydMvjaa	That is the society and women in Lebanon are not as liberated as they are here in the USA, keep in mind religion also plays a role in defining the women place in society. In some areas in Lebanon women are not allowed to leave even their village without the present of family member.Iam not sure where UR girl is from , but that beside religion make a lot of different in the parents behavior.|`|4sHJMnLXaa	Yeah...Sorry to say I went through a very similar but inverted experience..    Don't take it personally (as hard as it may seem) I'm 95% sure that it has nothing to do with you personally or the fact that you're still in school ( especially considering that you're in medicine which is a very highly regarded field anywhere in the world)..    It comes down to her parents most likely not wanting her to marry an American, one that she is so passionate about...They probably think that "she is too young to know what love is" , that "she will forget all about you in time and realize that it was for the better"...that "she will meet a local Lebanese guy from a well known family and settle down..etc"    I'm sorry to say that there is not much you can do. My guess is that since your girlfriend is fresh out of college, she's probably not independent enough to go off into the world on her own, and I doubt she will leave the security of her parents' home (or she would have already done that)....    I'm sure she's being honest with you...A lot of Arab parents are like that and there is nothing she can do to change their minds...    The best thing you can do is be there for her for the time being, and gradually let her go...    She might fall apart and even hate you for it...but as they say "this too shall pass" and you'll both move on and hopefully have good memories of each other...    But its unlikely that anything will happen....Even if you're serious and you're ready to marry her and take her in...I really don't think she could take that step...    If you truly love her and are hellbent sure on having her with you for the rest of your life....I say give her time, and you'll know whether she's ready to take that first step or not........if she's ready to "defy" her parents....You might even have to go to Lebanon yourself to meet with her father and try to convince him to give you his "blessings"...    Otherwise, just "remove the bandaid swiftly" and bear the pain for a while........It could and will get too complicated otherwise; this is a common sociocultural factor, one that you will have trouble understanding and dealing with...    I'm so sorry and I honestly sympathize. I wish you the best of luck!!|`|8oIDvXPLaa	I was honestly wondering about the same thing right before I read it.   My best friend is from Lebanon, and she's going through 'hell' because of her parents. I understand how some parents try to do what's best for their children, but sometimes they just cross the line.     Especially in your case, your girlfriend is actually an adult ! (considering the fact that you said she graduated college) she should be able to make her own decisions! Her parents can't be there to decide for her forever.     You said that she made you her the 'living together' part, which means she also sounds responsible, even though I think there's nothing wrong with two people living together, even if they weren't married... but since she it's seen as 'wrong' then she is capable of deciding for herself. She should try to make them understand, make them see that they can't be THAT involved in her life, especially her personal life... this just ruins everything.|`|RHFvuSa5aa	You are such a sweet person. At least you're trying to understand them. I personally think if you two love each other, don't let the parents stand in your way. In the end, they shouldn't be controlling her like she's some sort of a property. It is wrong. Just be patient, and try to come up with a solution, the both of you.    One other thing... did her parents know you were still in college because you were studying to become a doctor? I think that would change the mind of a lot of Lebanese parents. They just LOVE the "husband being a doctor" idea.|`|I2YUzjQ8aa	Dude when You are with a leb girl from back home you wre with her parents, her brothers , her sisters, her aunts, uncles, they sons and duaghters, the grandparents, their best friends and everyone in between.    Sounds like the typical lebanese mentality to me. Now ok the good part is she taught you not to co-habit before marriage but believe me they are doing now all over lebanon.      Her parents sound very racist to me and this is normal for most lebanese because they are a very vain and arrogant culture (trust me my parents are from there but they are very nice people, in other words not the typical lebanese), but when you say they arent sending enough money for her to cover her rent this tells me they arent typical lebanese because most lebanese parents love their kids and would support them anytime and wnywhere to make sure they are happy and safe.    My heart goes out to both of you, i will say a prayer that the good lord brings you 2 both together one day again.|`|pcCUUJsnaa	yes well different mentality and different ways...it's not onlt the fact that you're still in school (can't support her financially etc) but also the fact of living together unmarried too...but it's up to her now, she should "fight" for being again with you.|`|ji7gqCWxaa	The way parents behave greatly depends on their upbringing, and their surrounding circumstances, such as social restrictions, traditions, and religious beliefs.  In lebanon, unlike the US or Europe, women do not have their full freedom at the age of 18; and most parents are still against the idea of their daughter getting married to someone who is not financially secure, even him being Lebanese, and for that reason, the age difference, in their opinion, is a guarantee that the man is ahead financially.  Another issue is with religion. Some families are still hanging on to their religious traditions, and consider out of religion marriages are not welcome, (i am not sure if this is the case with you or not) unless off course the man changes his religion   One way couples deal with this, is by simply overstepping the parents decision and make their way through life independently.  Another way would be to talk to the parents and present your case showing them that you are to become a doctor in the near future and your life is in place. Probably then they might consider an engagement  period, but be sure in their mind, "they will not let their daughter go back just to be with a man she wants to marry in the future" that is a tradition breaker right there, not to mention, a religious no no.  In the end, you and your gf can decide which route to take, given her, your,  and her parents' circumstances.  Best of Luck.  ,|`|7rdwArEMaa	Her parents want her to marry a lebanese guy...that's it! and also they 100% do not want her far away from home in another country for sure cause she's a girl and she should be close to home.    Option: You move to Lebanon and be with her and get married:D

Depending on your age and your hobbies, it should be quite easy to make friends in Philly.      For instance, I am into pets, so I volunteer with animal rescue and I meet a lot of people.  I also like arts and crafts and meet friends at classes.      If you have a morbid sense of humor, you should get along fine in Philly.  People that travel here from the mid west think we are rude, but that is because we have a different way of entertaining ourselves.

HIgoRYEwaa	Currency manipulation, violation of Intellectual Property Rights and low cost labor are the backbones on which China has gained so much prosperity and they are not going to abandon this model so easily. It will require a concerted effort from the world body to make China change its stance. The problem is that the world at large is a disfragmented lot when dealing with China on this matter. It's not only US which has suffered, all nations having any trade relations are affected as they buy more from China than China buys from them.|`|MR4WwKoZaa	This long rant does not even make a little bit of sense.    "Commie-Thug Dictator" - If you want people to listen to your arguments, suggest avoid name calling.    "Chinese disrecpect to world and west again" - respect goes both ways, you want respect you earn it and you give it in return.    "China... created financial crisis" - uhh,  Financial crisis was caused by the US, genius.  Remember housing bubble, mortgage crisis, foreclosures, banks going bankrupt, Madoff?    "Hollow out western manufacturing to boot" - this is called competition, free market, capitalism, all your "ideals".   If it's not China, your OWN companies would've outsourced it it some other countries.  It's not China's fault that they are the most efficient in manufacturing and has the largest pool of workers.  Consumers are free to choose to buy 100 dollar shoes made in US, or 20 dollar shoes made in China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, etc.  Think about this for a minute, the US people want to live well, but they only want to do jobs that anybody in the world can do and can do cheaper?  They want to have a big house, drive nice cars, have swimming pool in the back, and yet, all you want to do is compete in manufacturing, i.e. labors?  Guess what,  the pay is equivalent to the job, if you do labor, you will get paid like a laborer, and laborer in China is cheaper than in the US.  Instead if Americans are so consumptive, you should invent a business that has added value, so you can get paid more in "the pursuit of happiness".    American consumers benefit to lower cost.  The shareholders, your pension funds / IRA benefit from profitability.  Afterall that's what companies do, try to minimize cost and maximize profits, remember?  capitalism?      Don't preach capitalism, when you want to apply protectionism.  Your rant demonstrates how little you understand how the world works.    Bottom line is, it's not China's fault, it's your broken system, i.e. free reign capitalism which puts profit above all else.  Including social responsibilities.  And it's your own people's greed and consumptions, and sense of entitlement which made you uncompetitive.|`|L2QdPvSUaa	Hmm... The USA creates the bubble.

pTLcvsVfaa	Well we dont know where you are from, so its hard to guess on the plane ticket. But figure about 300$ or so for that.    Hotels in the city will range from about 150-500$ ( and much higher) depending on what and where you want to stay. Even a dumpy hotel in the city is going to be close to 200$, but right now there are some good deals out there.But figure at least 200$ for a decent hotel with tax. There are always hostels for less then that, but they are disgusting and not a good choice for most civilized people.    Food depends on you. You can eat from street vendors and spend 10$ a day, or you can eat in fancy restaurants and spends 100$ a day. But I will say a good round number for food is 50/day.      Entertainment and other costs are hard to say because it depends how much and what you want to do. Maybe 50/day for that also.    So I am going to say     300$ for your plane ticket    225/night for a decent hotel with tax and extras.    100/day for food and other costs.

None of them have made it too big though.  There was a show called the "Trailer Park Boys" a couple went to that one.  There's also some in "Degrassi: The New Generation".  Which is just as ridiculous as the old.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I'm 45 and I remember the show when I was much younger.  I believe it went from "The Kids of Degrassi Street", to "Degrassi Junior High"  and then "Degrassi High" before going off the air.  Now it's back on as Degrassi - The Next Generation, with a new bunch of kids and some of the originals, now adults themselves, working as teachers and other adults on the show.    Spoofs...I don't think so.    Is it popular?  I'd say so or it wouldn't have been on for so long and in so many different versions.      The wiki link, near the bottom, gives you the character list and from that the work of the actors who played the characters|`|xSu5A4eYaa	yeah people live there|`|87DaOGDIaa	well ive been there once but uhhhh never heard of it.|`|6y7IAMfHaa	I Guess. I Heard It A Lot And I Never Seen It Once|`|MZPuDifYaa	Yes, it's very popular.  No, there aren't any spoofs.  Most Canadians watch it.  Sure, many of them are.|`|IdZMRz7zaa	Of course, TV Shows are all over the world!! Canada expecially.  And yes Emma is in a movie called "shes to young" on Lifetime. and Alot of other movies. I don't know to many but, yeah.  Ashley and Holly J. Sinclair are in a Lifetime movie together called "They Come back"   I watched it last night..  And I don't know about the other Actors, and Actresses in Degrassi.  But Degrassi is my fav show!! Love it!!|`|RhkKGsipaa	it's very popular with teens in Canada mainly because it doesn't sugarcoat teenage problems.|`|tq6fCjy1aa	I watched that show in the 6th grade and never knew at the time it was from Canada. Therefore it's had an impact well beyond Canada.

i2FRvkEpaa	I live by Oporto, in the north of Portugal, and it's been raining for a month, not counting those days when it snowed for a while and when there was ice all over my windowsheild. At least, it's not so cold now with all the rain. But it's kinda depressing and my car's been having problems and they may, they just may, be humidity related. I think that says it all: I wish it were summer all year long! Apart from that, I lived in Athens back in 1990/91 and it was a very harsh winter, really cold and rainy, not to mention snowy. The weather remained bad until the end of sping when everybody was already saying it was about to get much better in March. I guess I was a bit unlucky... My favorite thing to do when it's raing, um, sleeping. Not that my imagination doesn't go any further!...|`|GfmlxtNtaa	i love the rain the real rain not the crappy drops.  lightening and stuff.  popcorn nd chocolate and girly dvd.|`|hb3zv9a4aa	I LOVE RAIN!

I like to sit by the fire watching it falling down outside whilst drinking a hot cup of tea and eating a chocloate cake.|`|AA11737190	Most of the things I like to do are great when it is raining.   Rainy weather is good for reading books, drinking coffee, tea, or cocoa.  Whisky tastes better when it's cool and damp.  I used to love to smoke cigarettes on my front porch looking out at the rain, but I don't smoke anymore.  Rainy mornings are the best for sleeping in. They're also really nice for snuggling(or whatever) with the one you love. If you have a skylight, that is even better.  I like to go walking in the rain, but I am a little weird.  You are never too old to go splashing in puddles.....|`|yEe3WkFCaa	Why is this question in the Greece section?  Anyway, I honestly don't like the rain.  But it's better than the snow.

AA10272321	Check out cruisecritic.com It will give you all the info ...|`|aV3bFchtaa	They usually have one dress up night, suits, tux or whatever.  You can eat elsewhere on the ship if you opt out.  Sport clothes appropriate for the weather, are good, day to day.  Tipping suggestions are given, and most cruise lines now just charge it to your on-board account.  Meals are included, but some cruise lines have specialty restaurants that charge, but reasonable.  Keep in mind, it all comes from the same kitchen, or galley in this case.  You leave the ship (debark) in the A.M. of your arrival day.  Bags have to be packed and put outside your room the night before.  So, bring an extra bag that you can carry off, for essentials like toiletries, linen, and etc.  You can leave the ship on your own.  I have found that booking tours in advance is a bit costly, and generally do better, making a deal at the dock site.  Try both, to get a feel for it.  Fun money?  Hard to answer as personal tastes vary so widely.  Have a great time, you earned it.|`|5M0FBU89aa	I concur with the Carnival Cruise condition - I went on a Holland America cruise, and I swear-  we were the youngest ones on the boat (I'm 50)    About Alcohol.... All cruises charge you out the wazoo...    Get  an "Alcoholic Beverage card" - Usually allowing you each two drinks a day (Or a total of twenty) for about a hundred bucks - without it, they're usually $12.00 apiece (on Holland)    For fun, book shore excursion activities- usually part of the cruise brochure.  You didn't mention the boat you're going on, so I don't know what they offer on-board.  Dances are usually a lot of fun, but depending on the crowd, you may be the only ones on the floor.    There may be a lot of kids - so book carefully.      KC|`|toLCaFc9aa	I have only been on a cruise once and I want to go back so bad. It is perfect and lots of fun. I went on the Carnival Liberty fun ship for a week to Bahamas, Grand Cayman, and Costa Maya Mexico, it was WOW, excellent. I though at first I was going to get motion sickness, but you don't feel that there, it is like a hotel, you have your room, can order room service, they clean your clothes if you want to and even get ready your night dress if you plan going to the tie events. Pack like if you were going to a hotel stay, they have everything there too, even pills if you need them like the motion sickness one. You don't even need shampoo or tooth paste or shaving cream or nothing, they have everything there. Bunch of towels and all the bathroom necesities. I took my shampoo because I didn't knew that they have it there and I didn't used mine. I took one night gown and my husband one tuxedo, it is for the captain night where you meet the captain, but it is up to you if you want to go. We went on the second one because didn't knew about the first one, we didn't meet the captain but got dressed. Believe me if you have a good experience like we had you would want to go every single year. Oh, they give you daily schedules, it has all the activities that they are going to do, it even has expeditions that they are doing it that specific country. Now, important, they will charge you like $5 per person per day, it is for the tips, so you don't really have to give any extra tip unless you want it of course. If you go on the one I went or similar they are all really nice and they really love what they are doing, to the point that by the 2nd day they will know you first and last name and call you Ms. _____ Mr _____, really nice and polite. I guess all of them are alike no matter were you go or wish one you get. Just enjoy, leave the preocupations behind and relax in the spa. At least in the one I went the sauna was free to use, excellent. I hope you have an excellent time and let me know if you have any other question I can answer, I am planning on going again this year. Good luck :)   Sorry for the long story :)|`|BD7yd8D4aa	Sounds fantastic.  Be prepared to be around older people. I was shocked that on my honeymoon we were the youngest people on board. They were nice and I wouldn't let this discourage you.     You should pack some dressy clothes if you are having dinner in a fine dining room. Your ship may have casual dining areas. Make sure either way.    Meals are included in the price but alcoholic drinks are not.    MOST IMPORTANTLY: Be prepared to be sea sick! We did not get violently ill but our equilibrium was out of balance. We had to wear patches behind our ears. These helped but made us very sleepy.  You may want to talk to a doctor or pharmacist about it.    Enjoy your trip.|`|qR7lwYeraa	EWWWW I hate couuples on cruises. Cruises are meant for singles. If you go w/ your bf go to a quite resort.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	I have been to Disney Cruise line and Disney world, it was good experience!

We're going on Carnival and they sent us a big packet of info including a DVD which I watched yesterday and it answered a lot of the same questions you asked.|`|AA12333875	Congrats.Whats is like on a cruise ship. There are many words but, simply Fantastic. You pack once and once on board you do what you want & they clean your room, feed you and take you to different places. Plus, you will get to meet all types of new people from all walks of life.  As for clothes depending on the time of year & cruise line it is up to you if you want dressy clothes. They suggest you dress up but, do not enforce it. There are buffets, room service, cafes that serve hamburgs, salads, chili etc.   Cruise lines will charge you $10.00 aday each for tips.They also charge for pictures. Of course casino's.  Drinks depending on your choice $4.00 to $10.00 each.  Shows & entertainment on the ship are free.  When in ports of call you are free to do whatever you want. Just be back on board when the ship departs or you will be left behind.  I have been on over 20 cruises & loved each one.  Ships are like a small city where there is always something to do and see or just relax by the pool. Your choice. Your vacation.  Enjoy.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Dress clothes for formal dinner every night... altho, the last cruise I was on, was slightly more casual. Most folks wore dresses or suit/tie. I believe the cost of a beer was about $5.25. Your get a card with your name on this account and you "settle up" Before you leave boat. Besides night time entertainment and the ports, there isn't too much to do except exercise (maybe) putt-putt golf, lay by the pool, eat, eat, eat, eat,eat (LOL). Oh, did I mention eat?Night time entertainment was very enjoyable. Comedian, singing and dancing by professionals.The cruises I have been on were Carnival/carribean.|`|B0ypUuHXaa	I have done a 4 night cruise but because I am English, we went to Guernsey and France. We packed clothes we would normally wear back home, because the weather was the same. I was only 11 at the time, so I don't know about the price of drinks, but I remember that when you left the boat, you had to show your passport, and when you returned, you had to show your cruise card. But I went with Royal Caribbean, but I guess it would be roughly the same procedure.|`|dMoqddvRaa	Royal Caribbean is the Best!!!!  Carnival is the stupidest Cruise Ever!!!!!|`|093c633e155de952249b95398f169e87aa	if you want a good website to get lots of information, try www.vacationstogo.com and it has a phone number to call for a personal touch. they have best prices and the cheapest last minute cruises ive seen. i use it frequently|`|mtPZcGs6aa	I would stick with carnival....they are the fun ship! watch out for the drinks....they really add up!|`|Dghr9r3vaa	First of all, congrats!!! And second of all, you will have an amazing time on your cruise!! It is like a floating resort, pack like you would at a nice hotel. There are a lot of things to do while at sea that you will never be bored. If you want to lay out at the pool, get there early, they fill up fast!!    The meals are included, as well as the entertainment. Drinks can run around $3-$10 a drink, depending on what you want... I would put aside $100 per person, per day for your fun money... My bf and I brought $900 for the both of us for a 7 day cruise, thinking we brought too much, and he ended up having to charge around $300 extra on his credit card. It is $10 per person per day for tips, (meaning $10 for you and $10 for your bf that is divied up for the waiter, etc.) Also, you will need money for souvenirs and excursions. I regret not buying more souvenirs, they are memories and when you look at it, you remember where you were and what you did, etc.     The shows are included, and the midnight buffet is included. The only thing not included is the casino, alcohol, and drinks other than water, lemonade, tea and juice. Leaving the cruise, you can walk off together, but there are so many people on the ship that you will never be alone unless in your cabin. Carnival is an awesome cruise line, you guys will have an amazing time!!  Take lots of pictures!!!
eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	If you have read the reviews you know all you need to know. I have read a lot about the company and have not been impressed.    There are some reviews of the Regal Majesty on Cruise Critic about the actual cruise experience, you might find interesting. Some people liked it others didn't. You'll need to make your own mind up about going or not.    The Regal Empress was built in 1953 as the Olympia so can be classed as a vintage cruise ship.
Jm3vMKx3aa	Whether it is worth depends on your itinery. If you have not planned well in advance, want to travel by random train selection, stay longer at places which you like, and depart earlier for places which disappoint you, your pass may be o.k.    If you would stick to certain trains chosen and book individual tickets early enough you may be cheaper off by individual tickets, on the other side just imagine you've learned to know some cool people and must depart because of your ticket is only valid for a certain train.     You will have to pay for mandatory reservation if you use national or international highspeed or nights trains. Furthermore the Eurail pass is not valid in Great Britain and you have to pay if you plan to go there.    I have attached the website of Interrail which is the European rail system for young European people but the surcharges listed are the same. For journey planning I recommend the use of the German railway website. It is easy to handle and contains all European train connections.      Source(s):  http://www.interrailnet.com/2_special_tr...  http://www.interrailnet.com/2_reservatio...  http://www.interrailnet.com/2_night_trai...  http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.e...|`|gb9REJN4aa	There are fees to use it in many cases. In most of Europe, a ticket for a train is not the same thing as a seat reservation. On some trains, you don't have to buy a seat: you can sit in any open (unreserved) seat on the train, or in the aisles or hallways or stand in between cars if it is full. (If you are travelling midday on weekdays as a tourist, you probably don't need to worry about seat reservations in these cases.) Often, however, you are required to buy a seat reservation. The Eurail pass will cover the cost of the ticket, but not the cost of the required seat reservation. If you plan on traveling on overnight trains then a reservation can be both required and particularly expensive.    Whether a Eurail pass is a good deal depends a lot on where you are going. If you are in Eastern Europe, I say don't buy it at all: the trains there are relatively cheap and it's easy to buy tickets at the stations. In Western Europe, it can make things much less of a hassle and if you are traveling across more expensive Euro-zone countries then it can be worth it, too. So depending on which of those is your primary destination, I'd have very different answers for you.    However, even in Western Europe, I would very seriously check out a few of Europe's best-known ultra-cheap airlines. I got Ryan Air tickets for, at different times, 1 British pound and 1 Euro, not including taxes. So frankly, it's often easier to fly around the country than it is to take the nice, relaxing trains.|`|AA10106538	$750 SOUNDS GOOD. train travel in Europe is the only way to go and it is very expensive; so $750 is a good deal   May not be valid in Scandinavia Norway,Sweden,Finland.|`|ifNr13kfaa	Completely.  It's a pass that allows you to go anywhere you want throughout Europe (that the train goes) for free. Meaning within 2 weeks you can go from Spain to France to England and back and visit many different cities for really cheap.  Honestly, it comes down to how much your actually going to use it.  If your touring Europe it's great.  Otherwise don't buy one.  If your only going to be there and use the train 4 times tops, just buy the tickets....Oh, and yea, it's free everytime afterwards once you buy the pass.|`|g09x06Zpaa	It depends on how much you want to travel and to where. I don't think that its worth it for only a month or travel!    You might try asking people on travel blogs and ask their experiences.    The webstie linked below is a great resource when planning a vacation and we planned our trip to the Czech Republic with refrences from Fodors.     I'm sure the people on this forum can advise you more. But include more information such as your income and places of intrest!    Good luck!|`|R38qktvzaa	I think if you are going to be traveling around western Europe quite a lot then $750 is a bargain.    For example, one return ticket between London and Edinburgh will cost you over 100 which is about $150.    So you could very quickly get up to $750 if you were just buying tickets as you went along.    There maybe extra charge if you take the TGV (fast train) in France or the EuroTunnell train between England and France/Belgium but I`m not 100% on that.    I would take the advice of the person who said to check out the flight options between the places you intend visiting before you commit yourself to the train.    I, for example have just booked a return flight from Dublin, Ireland to Billund, Denmark for 47 Euros all in, which is only about US$60.|`|AA11075313	depending on your plan
910537da330152ad69b869eeff90d14eaa	about 35 minutes by freeway (I-880).      Take into consideration that my figure is with NO traffic.  I-880 has very bad traffic at both morning and evening commutes.  Your travel time, depending on when, can be as much as 1 hour from door-to-door.    Also take into consideration that once in Hayward, the surface streets are congested in the morning/evening too.|`|XZlFLecLaa	yahoo maps it or map quest it...|`|YKPo55j1aa	20minutes with normal traffic|`|5pioWG30aa	Based on Google Earth, in a straight line its about 25 miles from CSUEB to San Jose.

AA11441385	Darwin weather divides into two.  From about May to November it is warm to hot and dry.  The climate is delightful.  It is called The Dry.  From December to April it is monsoonal.  It is hot and humid.  You break into a sweat just blinking.  It is called The Wet.  People can go slightly nuts in the Wet.    Darwin is a modern city, with restaurants and bars.  And some really big drinkers - they drink more per capita than anywhere else in Australia.  Class is a relative term.  Darwinians pride themselves on being the salt of the earth.  It is still a bit of a frontier town.    There are lots of outdoor activities.  Fishing is big.  Kakadu National Park is a couple of hours away, and there are other national parks around and lots of places for weekend excursions. The crocodiles tend to inhibit a lot of water based activities.  No one swims in the ocean.    I like the place, but I have never lived there full time.
7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	Yes, they are, but are hard to book as its easier to book via travel agency. The flight will take approx 75 min only.

cYMeZ5CBaa	My boyfriend and I are going to Disney next month.  There's obviously lots to do there.  Universal Studio's, Seaworld, and Discovery Cove are also a lot of fun.  I guess it's all up to how long you're staying, what you guys like, and how much money you want to spend.    As far as spring clothes are concerned, I just purchased a ton of clothes at oldnavy.com.  They're T-shirts are reasonably priced and they last forever.  You can also find shorts, capri's, and bathing suits through them.      Good luck and have fun!!

6DzNOyXRaa	I would vote for Couples. They have the atmosphere that you are looking for. I visited Couples Swept Away and they allow you be as alone with your partner as you want, the night life there is very good. They have a piano bar that stays open as long as people are there. Check out www.couples.com on the left side of the page there is a link to their message board. There are a ton of answers to many questions I had before picking out a resort.|`|XeYDJOBjaa	sandals|`|nEgJAtK7aa	Either of these are good. I have been to all of the couples resorts and sandals properties. My suggestion would be Sandals Negril, Sandals Whitehouse or Sandals Dunns River. If you wan Couples I would suggest Couples Negril or Couples San Souci. You will not be dissapointed in any of these. They cater to honeymoon couples everyone during the day are into each other at the pool or on the beach unless you are at the swim up bar. Couples offers tours with their packages. I agree with the other comment you do not want to go out on your own, but the resorts are perfectly safe. If you want more info email me as I said I have been to all and they each have their own atmosphere.|`|vzDzyRonaa	My girlfriend and I stayed at Sandals Negril in August.  It definitely had a party atmosphere.  We would hang out at the jumping pool bar in the afternoon but in the mornings we would lounge around by ourselves.  You would always see the same people at the bars.  But what I found amazing was the people we would see at dinner and on the beach that were not taking part in the hopping party.  Some days we chose just to hang on the beach away from the craziness.  So there was enough space to seclude yourself from it, but where is the fun in that?    As for the late night party?  Yes the bars are open late, but past midnight everyone is so exhausted that it gets pretty dead.  Trust me you'll have so much fun when the sun is out you'll be tired too.|`|38d0941ff42de74ce4e6485a7b42b4eaaa	We love Couples Negril. We chose Negril because of the 7 mile beach. I wouldnt' say it was the "party" scene but we definately had fun with other couples and playing volleyball through the day. The relaxation on the beach, and throwing up our red flag when we needed a drink refill was the best! We loved the nightly entertainment and it was our perfect honeymoon. check out couples.com, they have a blog there where you can chat with others and see their photos and recommendations on all the couples resorts. We researched this to find which resort fit our style. Good luck, I don't think you can go wrong|`|noiX4SpTaa	Couples Negril in Jamaica. In the day time we relaxed by ourselves on the beach, in the pool, and in the ocean. There were plenty of activities included at the resort that kept us busy, but we didn't want any outside trips.There are a lot of opportunites for outside trips though. Couples Negril has a good nightlife. Live entertainment and the last bar and food place doesn't close until the last person leaves!!|`|RM4riVL5aa	If you r staying in a Resort , most are fine, but the murders and crime in Jamaica right now are very bad and getting worse. Be very careful if you should leave the compound. I lived in Jamaica for many years  and was very glad to return to America. The island is beautiful but the people are not nice, don't trust anyone.|`|rvXgGjAFaa	My vote would be for Sandals.  We've stayed at Sandals Inn (in Montego Bay), Sandals Montego Bay, and Sandals Negril.  When we were at Negril, it was the slow season and there wasn't much going on at all.  We did not like our time there.  Sandals inn is small & personal (cheap too), but it doesn't have a private beach and you'll spend a lot of time going to the other resorts on the buses.  We loved Montego Bay, but it is a party resort.  There's always something going on, and they try to get you involved.  We never had any trouble with them being overly pushy.  The great thing about staying in the Montego Bay area is that you have 3 resorts which they'll bus you between for free.  So you have a lot of choices, especially for dinner.  Personally I can't recommend any resort in the superclubs chain to anyone.  My husband and I were in Jamaica on 9/11/01 and were extremely impressed with the concern & professionalism exhibited by the Sandals staff.  Each couple was given 3 nights stay for free (keep in mind we were still eating & drinking just the same) until they could get a plane back to the states.  If you were still stuck after 3 days, your rate was $150 per room (huge discount especially for the ones that run $9000 for the week).  We met a couple at the airport who stayed at one of the Superclubs resorts and they told us that they were told to pay up or get out.  There were 2 couples who didn't have the cash or credit cards to pay and they were asked to leave.  Sandals took these 2 couples in.  Since then I can't say enough good things about Sandals or resist sharing our experience.  Good Luck!

52753f0eb1f1baf2fd8122008a9a228faa	first you need to know how to distinguish between a real Jade and Jadeine which is similar to the real jade (same color)    If the stone they are giving you is a real jade, try to look for a window which is near and with the stone but not on the angles, but with the big part of it try to draw a small line on the window, if the stone leave a mark on the window and the mark does not appear on the stone like a scratch then is it a real jade.... jadeine does not leave marks on a crystal window and if you try to draw a line on the window, then the stone will have a scratch on it.    Be careful whe buying jade, because you could come across with some people who would swear to you that is it real jade.    There are several stores in Guatemala which sell real jades like La Casa del Jade and Jades in Antigua Guatemala, but there is also another place in a small town near Antigua Guatemala, called San Felipe de Jess, the name of the store is Platera Antigue?a, and it is located in Calle de los Horcones in San Felipe... they work with silver and some stones like jades, but you can ask them to sell you only the jade.    The price would depend on the size and the weigh of the jade, but they are not too expesive as you mention that they are in Canada, maybe you can get them half of the price you buy them in Toronto.    Good luck

aebVOvVzaa	Heya, I work for a Canadian bank so I'll try to help as best I can!    Use the website below to search for the specific cities and towns that you'll be traveling to.  If you run across someplace without an ATM you'll know ahead of time to take some extra cash.  I did a quick search of Guatemala City and found 17 ATMs.      http://visa.via.infonow.net/locator/glob...    From my own traveling experience I would recommend that you call the bank to let them know that you'll be traveling.  This way they can note the account for their security department and when the withdrawals start from South America they'll know it's you and that someone else hasn't gotten a hold of your card.      Also, check your daily and weekly withdrawal limits.  Banks often set them fairly low for customers to prevent loss in case of debit card fraud.  If you plan to rely on the card you may want to increase your limits.      Foreign bank machines will often only give you the option to withdraw from your chequing or A account.  While some may have the option to withdraw from a linked credit card or savings account don't count on it.  Make sure that the account you're planning to use is accessible on Canadian ATM's as chequing to ensure access where ever you travel.    I like to set my customers up with an extra debit card when they are traveling just in case a bank machine eats their card or it gets lost.  Most banks will do this for their customers.  I don't work for TD but I hold a few accounts there and they've done this for me in the past.  It's quick to set up but you will probably have to visit a branch location to get this done.  Store the extra card in a safe place separately from your other card - like with your passport.  It's an easy and effective way to give you that little bit of extra safety.    One last bit of advice - if you're planning to take any credit cards it's a good idea to set up pin numbers on them if you haven't already, just in case you need to withdraw some extra money.  Mastercard works on a different system than Visa and PLUS (the system that your debit card works on) so an ATM that isn't compatible with your debit card and the PLUS system may be compatible with Mastercard.  To find Mastercard ATM locations use the site below:    http://www.mastercard.com/ca/personal/en...    Interestingly, my search produced 89 ATMs in Guatemala City while the Visa PLUS system only had 17.  Something to consider :-)    Hope this helps!  Have a safe and happy journey!      From the TD CANADA TRUST Website:    How do I access my account to withdraw funds while outside of Canada?     To withdraw cash while outside Canada, look for ABMs bearing the PLUS symbol, which is printed on the back of your card.     TD Canada Trust Access Cards can only be used at PLUS bank machines (the PLUS symbol is on the reverse of your Access Card).  You will be charged $3.00 CAD each time you make a withdrawal in the U.S. and Mexico, and $5.00 CAD each time you make a withdrawal outside of Canada, U.S. and Mexico; as well as the applicable exchange rate.    In the event that you experience difficulty using your Access Card while overseas, please call EasyLine using the International Access Code (IAC) for the country you are in plus 800-222-3456, then press 1.  If you do not know the IAC, please call collect at 416-983-5393.    To verify your Access Card limits and make note of your travel arrangements, please call EasyLine at 1-866-222-3456 (collect to 416-983-5393), available 24 hours a day.  Alternatively, please contact your branch.|`|AA10986891	If it is a VISA or MASTERCARD it should work,but just to be safe you should call the bank and inquir with them.|`|gISo0Ursaa	hi....i am sure you can find ATM to withdrawl money in Guatemala.  I was in Nicaragua last year and thought i would have problems.  But as it turned out I went to a bank and used the ATM there and had no problems.  I would suggest letting your bank you are going to Guatemala and that you will be using your account.  Because if they see an unusual transcation they can put an immediate freeze on the account.  In any case, a VISA can be used just about anywhere.  Good luck and have a great trip.  Guatelma is my next trip in Latin America.
AA10464425	I have friends there. Like all states, some areas (Aspen, Boulder) are more high-rent than other areas (Aurora). Many of my friends moved to CO because they love to ski, and CO is tough to beat if that's your joy in life. The one complaint that I've heard is that natives of the northeastern U.S. get sick of CO's often brown foilage. These persons miss the green lawns and trees of their youths and the relative ease of growing things compared with CO. Some persons also miss the lakes and oceans (some areas of CO are so dry that water must be tanked in). Many eastern cities offer much superior cultural attractions as well. However, I only know one person who moved back home (to MA).    The addition of the MLB Rockies certainly means that residents are no longer challenged as to professional sports opportunities.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	I lived in Colorado for over 25 years and loved it.

puyAEPZyaa	Either hotel works, depending on what you're looking for. Here are a few things to consider before you make your choice.    Location: Mandalay Bay is located at the south end of the Strip, while Planet Hollywood is almost located at the middle of the Strip. Unlike Planet Hollywood, Mandalay Bay does offer a free tram that connects to Luxor and Excalibur. You can also walk inside through connectors to access Luxor and Excalibur.    Dining: The dining options at Mandalay Bay are far superior to those at Planet Hollywood, with fine dining options, casual dining options, and quick bites.    Atmosphere: Mandalay Bay has a more casual, laidback, and upscale atmosphere, whereas Planet Hollywood has a livlier, younger, more hip atmosphere.    Accommodations: Both resorts have very nice rooms and suites. Planet Hollywood's rooms have a hollywood theme, while Mandalay Bay's have a beach theme.    Other Amenities: Both resorts have nice spas. Mandalay Bay has a better pool, but Planet Hollywood has better nightlife. Finally, Mandalay Bay offers shopping at Mandalay Place, while Planet Hollywood offers a wider array of shoping options at the Miracle Mile Shops.    Either way, you're sure to have a wonderful trip to Las Vegas.    Good luck and I hope you enjoy your trip!|`|NRa5MJ3Paa	If your a 1st timer go with Planet Hollywood, because it has a central location-- everything is easy to get to from this hotel.    If you've been to Vegas multiple times, go with Mandalay Bay, because its literally the last hotel on the strip.  But if you've been to Vegas several times there wont be the sense of urgency to see everything on the strip-- if you don't feel like doing a bunch of walking.|`|bec79a634c4d9b7c0723d8449a3b49f9aa	Mandalay Bay would generally be considered the "better" hotel by most people, based strictly on the level of services and amenities offered.

They are full suites and very nice.  You can take the tram where ever you want from there or rent a car.
eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	The National Express East Coast train service runs from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh Waverley at 30 minute intervals or hourly intervals depending on time of day.  Journey time is between 4 hrs 20 mins and 5 hours.  Ticket prices are variable depending on how far ahead you book your ticket but can range between 12 and 125 for a standard advance single ticket. The further ahead you book the cheaper you can get a ticket.|`|zgTsCicNaa	Prices for London Edinburgh trains range from 17 for a single ticket to 293 for executive first class travel. The best value tickets for travelling from London are GNER's Standard Class Off-Peak tickets at 25 and 39 for a closed return -- where you specify the return date. Tickets of 25 are available on fewer trains so book early to get the best fare.    Standard Off-Peak train tickets have little flexibility. To get this fare you must book at least 7 days in advance, your return journey must be made within 1 month and no changes or refunds are possible once ticket booking has been made.    The Apex ticket of 54 for the London to Edinburgh train has a bit more flexibility than the Standard Off-Peak. It may be possible to change the reservation and get a refund for part of the fare if you don't travel by train at all.    Booking train tickets  You can buy your tickets by phoning the train operators or by booking online at TheTrainLine. Avoid buying train tickets through a foreign agent to get the best possible fare discount.    http://www.stuckonscotland.co.uk/edinbur...|`|DIEih5asaa	Train from Kings cross station,about 5 hours.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	London-Edinburgh starts from Kings Cross station in London, going to Waverley station in Edinburgh.

The resorts on the north coast between MoBay and Ocho Rios are OK but there may not be lots to do in the immediate vicinity once you get off the resort.  Ocho Rios is nice because it's close to Dunn's River Falls (a must do).  The area around Port Antonio is great if you love nature and fewer tourists.  There are a couple nice resorts on the south coast which are nice if you want the culture of Jamaicamon.  I'm not big on MoBay because there isn't any "downtown" and every thing is scattered around the area.  Also, most of the the resorts have man-made beaches.

e9dcb4dff0cf5f5552e4af8cd58bf404aa	There are at least three possible routes you could follow to reach Jagadhri from Gurgaon. Based on the safety and driving conditions, Id rank these as below. I would definitely avoid the third route, if I could..    1.  Gurgaon - Karnal - BirPipli (Kurukshetra) - Ladwa - Radaur  Yamuna Nagar - Jagadhri (235 km)  2. Gurgaon  Karnal  Indri - Yamuna Nagar - Jagadhri (230 Km)  3. Gurgaon  Baghpat  Baraut  Saharanpur  Yamuna Nagar - Jagadhri (255 Km).    Following are the detailed driving directions for Route 1:    1. Go north on Sohna Road from South City-II towards Rajiv Chowk.    2. From Rajiv Chowk, take Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway (NH 8) towards Delhi and go until Dhaula Kuan (about 22 Km from Rajiv Chowk).    3. Take the slip road at Dhaula Kuan Flyover and go straight on Vandematram Road (also called as Upper Ridge Road). After about 5 Km, you will enter the round about at intersection of Vandematram Road and Shankar Road. Keep straight on Vandematram Road and go another 1.5 Km and you will reach another big round about.    4. After entering this roundabout, take the third left turn on Faiz Road.    5.

B5Y46XBoaa	Once again I see the Arab/Egyptian/Syrian/Lebanon pally supporters are using a question about someone other than their favorite victims as a platform to drone on and make claims that are outright lies.     According to the ICRC website they've asked repeatedly to see Gilad Shalit  but keep getting turned down. So, they've done nothing else. Of course when an issue comes up with a pally in an Israeli prison the ICRC has it plastered all over the media and they park their agents at the Useless Nations to push for retaliatory punishment of Israel at the international level. And they claim they don't take side. pffft.. liars.    http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf...|`|eyJqrqn7aa	They send money to the Red Cresant.  That's it.|`|lCW3Worpaa	He wasn't kidnapped, he was captured.|`|XuYPddLuaa	Isn't he a soldier?    I thought they cared about civilians more? Idk.|`|FcH2ZEkqaa	Still no ICRC access to Gilad Shalit. Does Israel allow access of visitors to Palestinian Prisoners? A mother cannot even visit her son. A wife cannot visit her husband. Cheers!    http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf...|`|Xgxjc5aFaa	The IRC is for civilians, not the armed forces of any country.  They wouldn't get involved in that.  Also, another poster made a good point about this being just one person.  Israel wouldn't let the emergency services do their job to save innocent civilians, blocking them from accessing the wounded until after they had died.  The IRC has more important things to deal with at the moment.  Why should one Jewish soldier be more important than all the dead, injured, and displaced people of Gaza?|`|0RuNbOGlaa	Using a little bit of common sense, I would guess they have more important things to worry about than one single person, like maybe the massacre or thousands of innocent Palestinian women and children by the IDF.   Besides, the Jews are holding at last count over three thousand prisoners without charges or trials, including women and kids, and youi worry about one Jewish soldier?

I would go to a travel agents and ask them as i guess different tour operators will have different rules and regulations with regard to travel.    You may be ok at 16 but i dont think a 15 year old will be without an adult and they are def still classed as a child.|`|ymt018uhaa	Depends on where you're going/ what you'll be doing.   When I went on my senior trip, the older sister of one of my friends and a couple of her friends went with us. I think a big part of it was because we were high schoolers on the verge of graduation, so our parents knew there was going to be alcohol.
90tPT5nlaa	Adelaide is a good deal cheaper than Brisbane for housing.    Both places are great for a family. I would say Adelaide would be slightly better for a young family, and Brisbane a little better for teenagers.    Adelaide is hotter than Brisbane in summer, but much less humid, and cooler in winter.    Adelaide is less affected at the moment by the financial crisis, housing prices are still increasing but more slowly.    Really I think you'll be fine in either place. Good luck!|`|3jxBWMVeaa	I'd definately go for Brisbane over Adelaide, despite the slightly higher costs. Adelaide is kind of the ****hole of Australia. Or better yet, go to Melbourne. Adelaide just has nothing to do. I was there on my way to Darwin and we (100 of us from my school) got bored there after being let loose in the city for 2 hours.|`|Lt8UFEIoaa	Adelaide is experiencing a boom at the moment ( according to the media) but its so hot there right now!!! 110.f + continuously. Brisbane is great as its a bit bigger and busier, I live on the gold coast 1 hour south of Brisbane and its great here. Its close to the ocean so its cooler, everything is close. The population is 500,000+ so there is everything here you need!|`|jieKgKF1aa	in adelaide it has been 40 degrees celsius (104 f) or more for the past week and most likely for the next week, i hope u like the heat in summer.|`|AksA9h3Aaa	They are both great cities.  Brisbane is the 3rd most populated city (after Sydney and Melbourne) and Adelaide is the 4th.    Adelaide will be a lot cooler, weather wise..   But as Brisbane is the 3rd most populated city, it's slowly catching up to Syd and Mel housing cost wise.     You should take a look at www.realestate.com.au and compare some prices of different suburbs within both the cities. (Obviously if you intend to live near the inner city, or further out this will affect how much you are spending on housing costs, rent or buying)    I would definitely recommend checking each States website for more details of different government laws/expenditures etc.  Adelaide is the capital of South Australia, Brisbane is the capital of Queensland.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	I would definitely choose Brisbane but the price of rents and housing is dearer there than Adelaide. Brisbane rents are very expensive and sort after. Adelaide is suffering terribly at the moment they have had several days of over 40 Celsius their weather can change dramatically in a day . Im not a lover of Adelaide but there are some nice places there. you might really like it. Job wise the choice would be better in Brisbane but jobs are very sort after at the moment . Thousands of people around Australia have lost their jobs recently. Good luck
LBa98hVcaa	Many Singaporeans are being retrenched...even foreign workers too...and many claimed that the employers owed them salaries and wages for several months...even the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong acknowledged that 2009 is a "difficult year" due to recession...    so please don't be too hopeful...anyway, is that company can be trusted?|`|BkatcMZbaa	Where are U from......India?   S'pore is now in recession and is fully prepared for it to happen.  You are smart......make sure which Co..big or small.   In retrenchment if happen, the foreigner & last in will be first out......labour regulation here.  Check it out and be sure.|`|Ioc0owmfaa	Not really a good time to make a career change. If you already have a job in your country, hold on to it first.    Everywhere, US, Europe, all are retrenching workers. Singapore is not spared.     But to look at it positively, I believe Singapore is not as bad if compared with other countries. The government has drawn up a plan to help companies not to retrench workers.     Also, opportunities may not come knocking twice. It could be a breakthrough for you.    So, it is still a risk that you have to take. Think carefully, especially more so if you have other mouths to feed.|`|ihcDXzlqaa	Singapore is much less affected by the global financial turmoil than many countries in Europe or in the Americas.   Recession does not mean that bad times will last forever, and besides, you have your offer. I'd take it. Good luck!|`|PDotv2Hsaa	The reality is Singapore IS in recession since it's had a few quarters of negative growth. There are reports of companies laying off people every day. The government has just unveiled the new Budget, which will provide some relief for the people. But all of this is also happening in many other countries.    If you think that by accepting this job offer it would further your career, then it's a risk you'll have to take. Or you can perhaps negotiate for a x-year contract instead.|`|GTAKIE9kaa	seem like you are from middle east, yes singapore is in recession and would not recover until 2010   take care, everyone is worried about their job|`|iuH2F0thaa	Recession is in fact being faced by all countries in the World now. Singapore is under recession too. But we are well-prepared as Singapore is able to recover or slow down the recession with its backup-deposit.    The taxes and GST collected by the government since decades ago is been deposit into Singapore's Bank. Which the money will and is not allowed to be used, unless with the permission of our President.  For over 40+ Years, we have never use a single cent in from our backup-deposit.     It was until the current recession, when our government decided to use the backup-deposit to help the economic. Therefore, Singapore will not be facing serious damage from the recession.|`|d9f34c2019b437cf52628152cbee27a6aa	I've been jobless since Oct and I'm still here in Sg looking for work but there just isn't any.

pOaS9P38aa	Yes, Felipa Moniz is right.    In 1479, Christopher Columbus married wealthy Felipa Perestrello Moniz, a daughter from a noble Portuguese family.    Felipa's father was Bartolomeu Perestrello an explorer who had been involved with the discovery of the Madeira Islands ( Bartolomeu Perestrello had died when Felipa was a young girl).    Felipa gave Christopher Columbus Bartolomeu Perestrello's charts of the winds and currents of the Portuguese possessions in the Atlantic.    In 1480, Christopher Columbus and Felipa had a son who they named Diego Colon.    In 1485 Christopher Columbus wife Felipa died of consumption.|`|AA12142423	whoever she was, she ain't alive anymore.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	Mrs. Columbus.|`|lWu0fnllaa	Filipa Moniz Perestrello, daughter of the Porto Santo governor!    you were right...

9CUaikUEaa	http://londonelegance.com/transpondia/us...      oh btw, how did you get a green card?|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	This sounds a little strange...how DID you get that green card?  Anyway...whether or not you need a visa to visit the U.K. depends  on your nationality.  You will need to carry your green card and passport from your home country to travel.   You can use the site below to see if you need a visa. Fill in the blanks and click for the info.
AA11349530	yes to get a visitors visa you either have to show that you have enough money to support yourself (including cost of hotel etc) or you have to get a support letter from a sponsor, which is someone who will be looking after you ... whoever writes the support letter must be able to prove that they have sufficient money and income to look after you ... I'm not sure what you mean by "on government care" but it sounds like they don't have a job and a good income ... so it's is very unlikely that they would be accepted as a sponsor    I think you should forget the idea until you've got the money|`|wt7aw5f8aa	what do you mean they are in the governments care?  you dont need a letter from the person your hoping to visit.
