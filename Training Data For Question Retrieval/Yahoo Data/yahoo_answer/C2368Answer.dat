You should look into other factors. Where it is located for one. for example, san diego is much more exciting than long beach. fullerton is also more exciting than long beach. there is pretty much nothing in long beach. Also, if you are fortunate enough, one of them will offer you some sort of scholarship or financial aid. That should also be a factor. All in all, to answer your question, csulb is more reputable than pomona

Some colleges allow you to pick roommates online.  Others will match you up by criteria.  Others still will ask what you prefer, completely ignore that information, and put you with the next person in line.  Try to find out from those currently attending the institution what the best way is to secure a good roommate.  A roommate can make or break (well, at least severely disrupt) a good college experience. (Due to my experiences, I left college vowing to never get another roommate until I put a ring on her finger and she said, "I do.")<br>  <br>  Oh, one other thing.  Do *not* be a roommate with any of your existing best friends (or even existing mild friends).  It can turn a friendship into a soured relationship.  Since there is no mother/father to arbitrate (there are RA's, but they can only do so much), when problems arise often you'll just have to work it out between yourselves. Also, if you room with your best friend and you aren't speaking to each other at the moment, you don't have another room to go to to cool off. It's cool when you don't know the person and form a friendship - but there's also something to be said when you don't know the person and are glad you'll never see them again at the end of the semester/year either.  Good luck!
AA10297143	In my line of work, we use what we call SOP or Standard Operating Procedures.  This is a written explanation of how things should work in a given situation, to include safety and risk mitigation.  If there is a component of culture being taught in that situation, it might be due to a certain way things are done in the given environment and the thought process the workers use to arrive at the best way to conduct business.  Perhaps someone in another part of the world would do the same job in a different way because that is what is logical to them based on experience and their environment.

What do you think of the city of San Diego versus Long Beach. Personally, I think San Diego is MUCH more lively and exciting. If you go to San Diego you will get the full college experience. I've visited Long Beach, yes the campus is nice, but what happens when you step outside of the campus? Are you going to isolate yourself in the school? I think not. CSULB is also a commuter school. Just like CSUF, 90% of the students drive to school in the morning, and drive home after class. This makes it VERY difficult to meet people and make friends. Take it from someone who has experience. I attended CSUF and it was ridiculous. I met less than 10 people my entire first semester. It wasn't until the second semester when I joined a fraternity that I started to really meet a lot of people. On top of that, yes, the Greek Fraternities will help you make friends, but the Greek system is pretty pathetic compared to other schools. You will have something like 3 fraternities with 80 members each... But I digress. SDSU on the other hand is much less of a commuter school, you will get the college campus experience. Just like USC or UCLA, where everyone lives on campus and the campus is literally it's own town. So, in my opinion, this one is pretty much given. CSULB = boring.  SDSU = time of your life & college experience<br>  <br>  just don't get sucked into partying at sdsu, you need self control, or you'll end up spending 5 years earning or bachelor's, and probably not even going to graduate.

AA10297143	This is something that you need to take up with the school nurse and the administration. There could be an underlying problem that cannot be seen on the surface, or there could be a medical history.  The sleeping and snoring obviously you can have a say in but the student obviously needs some help.  I just think the right avenue is to get the professionals involved so they do their job and you can go back to teaching, which is yours.  I appreciate your concern, and yes, a teacher's job is more than standing in front of a class, it is also safety and well being of students.  I just think this is a bigger elephant than you should have to bite off on your own.|`|AA12035186	Ask the school nurse and principal to help with this.  You don't need to go calling the parents before you get some other opinions.  He sounds like he definitly needs medical attention.  Good luck!|`|AA12117718	When he comes in like that again, send him immediately to the school nurse; then, after school, talk to his parents, and find out why they are not sending him to their family physician.<br>  To prevent him from getting up to get tissue, place the box of tissue directly on his desk.|`|9Sx4PzBmaa	Hmm..sounds like allergies to me, especially if he has it all the time...a cold or flu would pass in a week or so, but allergies can be aggravated by anything (pollen, dust, even perfume from another student in the room or the room inself (I once had to move out of an apartment I was allergic to, and I was a LOT like your student, sick and coughing all the time!)<br>  <br>  I would approach him first, and just say "I've noticed you haven't been feeling well, what's going on?" and see what info you get from him.  <br>  <br>  I would also arrange for him to keep a box of tissue and possibly a bottle of water or mints to suck on at his desk, so he's not getting up or coughing as much.<br>  <br>  If you have a school nurse you can send him down there and she can refer him and the parents to get medical help.  <br>  <br>  If you don't have a school nurse, contact the parents (together with the principal if this is possible) and explain the situation and let them know his illness is affecting his ability to do his best in class.  Ask if they are awake of his problems.  You might want to do some searching beforehand to see if there are any low-income or free clinics in your area, because if he's not getting medical treatment it could be because they don't have insurance, so if you have that info available for them they might be more apt to seek treatment.  Or your state our county might have a special health plan for kids that they could enroll in.<br>  <br>  Whichever route you choose, don't just let it go.  Whatever his condition, there are ways to treat it so that this poor kid doesn't have to suffer anymore.|`|b6c083e8702dbef9e8f370340bd74453aa	I would talk to him and his parents and ask why they aren't keeping him at home.  You could suggest that he needs to see a doctor, but there might not be anything wrong with him, other than just having a virus.  I work in an elementary school and since the beginning of October we've had strep throat, pneumonia, the flu, and colds going around.  Most days lately, I have about 20% of my class away because of illness,  In fact, I myself have been sick since November.  As soon as I recover from one thing, I get another.  Several of my students keep coming to school sick because they have been sick since November too, and they are missing too much school.  <br>  <br>  Suggest to the parents that he stay home, because he is passing his illnesses on to others.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

AA10297143	Positively, there are actually "some" good educational programs, such as Discovery channel or others depending on the age of the student.  Too much TV is not good because it does distract from learning and can create issues with students who have deficiencies in maintaining their focus on a topic (ADD, et al).  Moderation is the key to watching television and how much influence it has on the learning process and performance in school, positively or negatively.|`|C5E2liU8aa	It is mostly negative. <br>  Watch TV. The shoot never stays the same. Commercials are the worst moving every 2-3 seconds. Even sitcoms move quickly. This feeds into ADD kids really bad. <br>  <br>  Second, most TV results in stoopid people. Problems solved in 22 minutes, or 30 with commercials. TV presents an idealized life that seldom exists. Most writing is poor. Most plots are poor. Most stories are poor. <br>  <br>  That said there is some good TV. A good TV show can talk about today, Battlestar Galactica as an example. <br>  <br>  There are some good documentary shows. And of course the channel everyone watches but no one sees, PBS.|`|9Sx4PzBmaa	Well I don't know exactly where I read it, you'll have to do a search to find it, but I read a study once that showed there was a correlation between how much TV a young child watched and the incidence of ADHD.  <br>  Of course kids can waste their time watching "junk" cartoons instead of doing homework, but they might also be watching educational shows as well (my two year old neice has learned all her letters and numbers by watching sesame street!)  In the older grades, TV can be used as a great resource to teach current events and even liturature (they can compare a book to a movie)
3726d1854b574e48b3a07e7f5d71e489aa	It really depends upon the marketing plan of the school.  Some schools wait until it is closer to the start of the semester.  Others get it out to the students as soon as possible to have that "first impression."<br>  <br>  I actually work at a university in Financial Aid and am responsible for sending out award letters.  For the 2009-2010 academic year, I'll be doing it this week.<br>  <br>  In any case, note that award letters may change over time.  Some award letters have incentives to sign up with the school earlier than right before the semester (for example: an early deposit award that goes down the closer it gets to the semester beginning).  Make sure to keep your paperwork straight and have the latest copy of the award letter handy from each school when making your decision.<br>  <br>  As a side note, I would strongly encourage you not to take out any debt (i.e., student loans).  It's common to do so, but many students wish they could go back in time and reverse that decision after they have graduated and have to pay back the tens of thousands of dollars.  Talk to at least ten people who have graduated at least a year ago with $10,000 in debt and ask them if they would have made the same decision.  Let finances be part of your decision making process - go to a school you can afford.  If you can't afford one, go to an in-state public school and work your way through school.  Pedigree (where you got your education) means very little these days.  Your future employer would much rather you have learned something and know how to apply it well from a common institution than to have a degree from a prestigious institution where you didn't learn much.|`|GTKXq7A1aa	closer to school.<br>  But you might get a letter sooner|`|4uQ39muFaa	i dunno... but i think it will happen. just hope it does happen.<br>  is that a good thing to get it right away?

YQRbtyGVaa	Video games are often unliked by the Cahtolic Church. Reasons for this are that it promotes violence, drugs, and alcohol. These days children see enough of that within the world surrounding them. They don't need to see it in video games. WHile it may be entertaining it is neither healthy, nor moral for the kids. This immoral behavior shown in video games just adds to the idea that kids may behave this way too. However this is absolutely untrue.

IzxVlE6Caa	I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  A simile is a figure of speech comparing two unlike things, often introduced with the word "like" or "as".[1] Even though similes and metaphors are both forms of comparison, similes allow the two ideas to remain distinct in spite of their similarities, whereas metaphors seek to equate two ideas despite their differences. For instance, a simile that compares a person with a bullet would go as follows: "John was a record-setting runner and as fast as a speeding bullet." A metaphor might read something like, "John was a record-setting runner. That speeding bullet could zip past you without you even knowing he was there."<br>  <br>  A mnemonic for a simile is that "a simile is similar or alike."<br>  <br>  Similes have been widely used in literature for their expressiveness as a figure of speech:<br>  <br>  Curley was flopping like a fish on a line.[2] <br>  The very mist on the Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric.[3] <br>  Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus.[4]|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	It is a comparison , usually in the form "As .... as a ..." e.g. "As happy as a lark."|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Simile, you're on Candide Camera like me!|`|YipD1QKFaa	A simile is a figure of speech comparing two unlike things, often using "like" or "as."

AA10297143	Well, you probably don't but what you can do is check with the NJ Education Board to see what qualifications you need to teach first, then to see the qualifications needed to teach a particular subject.  As a minimum you need a B.A. in education, but other B.A.s can cover down if the right courses are there.  Once your course requirements can be determined through a transcript, the Board can determine if you need to take additional courses to qualify.  Once you complete those courses, you need to have a licensure, or a teaching certificate.  The link below will assist you with that and good luck:|`|56qTOSIoaa	You'll need to get a teaching license in NJ, which will probably require you to take some additional courses, but not entirely start over.
EeMMHYBiaa	1. Concentrate on taking advanced work in whatever you are interested in and exploring different areas of study in high school.<br>     2. Select a major you like. If you major in the liberal arts or humanities, you will need to take pre-med required courses outside your major. Examples of courses commonly required for admission to med school are calculus, organic chemistry, biochemistry, biology, chemistry, physics.<br>     3. Choose a combined medical program after high school. If you are sure that pediatrics or, at least, medicine, is for you, this may be a good route to go. Depending on the program, you may be able to complete medical training in six or seven years instead of eight, save money on tuition, get guaranteed acceptance to a med school and/or avoid taking the MCATs. The downside to these programs is that they restrict your options in terms of what medical school you go to and if you change your mind about medicine later on, you may be in trouble.<br>     4. Maintain good grades if you select a regular four year college and take your MCAT. In your junior year, apply to and interview at the med schools of your choice.<br>     5. Go to medical school for four years. Take the USMLE, steps one and two.<br>     6. Apply for internship/residency programs in pediatrics through the national matching service during your third year of medical school.<br>     7. Complete your internship and residency. In the U.S., this takes three years: one of internship followed by two of residency.<br>     8. Take the board exam in pediatrics.|`|K5Qntlnaaa	I'm a medical assistant and I got my certification my senior year in high school.

3726d1854b574e48b3a07e7f5d71e489aa	I work in Financial Aid at a university and I am also a financial counselor as a side-business (helping people manage their finances).<br>  <br>  The Forbes 400 (400 most wealthiest Americans) when asked what the #1 principle was to becoming wealthy...  they said....  "Get out of debt and stay out of debt."  As a financial counselor, I wholeheartedly agree with them.  Stay out of debt.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford that college, go to one you can afford (e.g., in-state public).  If you can't afford that, then save up some money and then start cash flowing your education by working and going to school at the same time.  You'll be very thankful you stayed out of debt by the end of the program.<br>  <br>  Also!  There is *a lot* of money out there in outside scholarships.  Treat it like your full time job to find them (apply, write essays, etc.).  If you applied for 200 scholarships and got 30 at $500 each, that would be $15,000.  Again, I work in Financial Aid, the money is out there - seriously.  The outside aid processors told me themselves that in our institution of around 10,000 students, they though that 60% to 85% of students could go through school *completely debt free* if they would apply themselves to finding outside aid.  Again, money is out there.

I suggest you don't get any type of student loan. why? because once you do you can never stop paying for it. believe me. it happened to my dad. he's been paying for 15 years and they just charge higher and higher. Even if you have financial problem they will ocontinue to get your money, even if it means taking it directly from your paycheck.
TsQumtCLaa	yes|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	I think they should search Yahoo answers for students who are trying to get others to do their homework for them.|`|207dFmdHaa	no, this is a free country..|`|azxbIaVfaa	I personally don't think that schools should do random backpack and locker searches because its trespassing your own space. One thing is that you might have something positive for the people doing the search like a Christmas present in your bag or locker. However, you might also have your cell phone on and you're not allowed to have it on during the school day and you'll get in trouble. <br>  <br>  But then I do think that they should because someone could be doing drugs and have them in their locker. <br>  <br>  I believe that schools should and shouldn't be allowed to do random backpack and locker searches because they're intruding your own space, but then also, they could be helping you b/c you might be doing drugs or something.|`|CtwEFHcqaa	Sure, it depends what they are searching for. If they are just searching for stuff like cell phones or I-pods it probably wouldn't be great of an idea, but if they are searching for drugs or something than it's a good idea. I think it's a bad idea to search for little things like drugs or cell phones because some kids will need to use their phones to call their parents for a ride home. I-pods are pretty much useless at school, but some kids like to have them so they can listen to them on the way home, they aren't too bad to have in your backpack. But for illegal drugs and/or bombs are illegal for the obvious reasons.|`|Fw9V0mJmaa	yes and no kids might be hiding drugs in their property and it invaids personal space.Take a poll at school or something and set up pros and cons tree map<br>  good luck!|`|5PNPj8jwaa	i do think that schools should do backpack and locker searches<br>  i think they should a few (like 3) a year<br>  but if they do find anything<br>  they should make the searches more frequent<br>  but they should just have like the parents or legal guardians sign a permisson form at the begining of the year saying that that is ok with them <br>  and i dont think that the school should give the kids fair warning <br>  cause if they have like drugs in their locker they could remove them <br>  and i also think that if the school it tipped off about anything they should search the lockers|`|RbCsBbhLaa	If this is your hw then you need to come up with some ideas yourself because your teacher knows your writing style. <br>  <br>  I don't think they should unless they have reason to believe that a student or students have any questionable or banded objects in their locker or backpack. <br>  But it also depends on where this is, if we're talking an inter-city school or something like a school in some parts of NYC where lots of kids have the sort of thing that could cause harm to them or others them yea that would make sense. <br>  <br>  Okay so think of a few main ideas then put in details about all of them. <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|ZUNmcAmmaa	Its for an essay, huh?

HylgDXk7aa	why English became the official language of the USA. ( well it really didn't until 2007,<br>  but you might find this interesting:<br>  legend is that German missed becoming our official language by a single vote, American English has never been in jeopardy. In 1795, the 3rd Congress did consider and reject a petition by German Americans in Virginia to translate all federal laws into their language. A tie vote in the House of Representatives appears to have been broken by Speaker Frederick A. C. Muhlenberg, a Pennsylvania German with budgetary concerns and assimilationist tendencies. Poor recordkeeping leaves much uncertainty about what role he may have played. But the Muhlenberg legend is certainly false: German was never seriously considered as an official language – despite a century of claims by the likes of Ripley's Believe-It-or-Not, the German-American Bund, and Parade magazine.|`|B9DUiDyDaa	Obama Vs.

AA11152691	I know that there are a lot of scholarship websites online, but your first and best bet is to check out the school's financial aid website to see what scholarships are offered. I have gotten a few myself, and many of them I didn't have to fill out a separate application for. The university itself will have scholarships, and sometimes the department you want to major in will have scholarships where you will fill out one application and are considered for all of them. I don't know what your financial situation is, but you should be able to find some good funding because of your GPA, regardless of how much money your parents may have. <br>  <br>  I would say if you don't see this kind of scholarship information on their website to e-mail the university's financial aid office. If you work with the financial aid office and fill out your FAFSA every year (even when you think you may not qualify for anything), you should have no problem getting the money you need to go to school!

Voltaire makes Pangloss out to be  a fool, for this comic novel demonstrates repeatedly that this world can be pretty awful.<br>  <br>  "I disagree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it." -- Voltaire  quote (wording is approximate - look it up) that is sometimes cited to emphasize the importance of free speech.<br>  <br>  "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him." -- Voltaire here is referring to the useful social role played by religion, as for example in keeping poor people contented with their lot, so that they'll be quiet.<br>  <br>  "Let us tend to our garden." -- again, quote is approximate.  Look it up.  Here Voltaire is saying that because this is NOT the "best of all possible worlds," the best way to achieve happiness or virtue is to confine your attention to a very small corner of it, and to try to improve that corner.
OtrHpji1aa	Specifically what do you need?  What do you mean by "a phrase that goes with"?  If you're looking for the meaning of that phrase, it means that to use the written word (through logic and argumentation) is more likely to win an argument than through physical aggression (represented by fighting with the sword).<br>  <br>  Is that what you're looking for?  If not, can you be more specific?

ntm91alQaa	Speech-language pathology is a very satisfying profession and the avenues one can take job wise is almost endless. I can honestly say that i have never considered switching to another field, but i HAVE thought about switching jobs within the profession. currently, most new graduates are able to establish a private practice right off the bat, which is absolutely fantastic! in a sense, you can pick and choose your clients, as well as be your own boss. SLPs are in such desperate need in all places that one can almost name their price and go anywhere with it (think hospitals, skilled nursing care, schools, private practice, accent reduction...anything!) <br>  <br>  i think it goes without saying why the actual profession of SLP is so satisfying. its being able to single-handedly help out an individual to communicate with the world, and that's very rewarding. <br>  <br>  Im sure where you are has the same demands for the profession as with anywhere else within the US. there arent enough of us to go around at the moment, so this is an excellent time to get into the profession.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have a problem applying for a master's program in SLP. the only thing you need is a bachelors with required classes that the university insists you complete. each university is different, so check into it with the director of the SLP department. <br>  good luck!|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	There's not a lot you need to take home with you depending on your case load.

If there are other learning disabilities or ADHD in your family, then your likelihood of having an autistic child goes up somewhat. If your partner also has this kind of background, then you likelihood goes up. <br>  <br>  Autism is beginning to look more and more like a genetically caused situation. In some families, siblings of an autistic child have as much as 50% chance of being autistic. This is the minority, but it is something to consider. If there are any more autistic people in your family, cousins, aunts, uncles then it would be more worrisome. <br>  <br>  Fraternal twin studies are showing that only 10% of fraternal twins both have autism, whereas monozygotic twins are at about 90%<br>  <br>  I suggest going about your life and just be alert to the possibility that you could father an autistic child.

EyKJ737daa	My eldest daughter who has Williams Syndrome doesn't wear them as she is hearing fine but she does have little friends who do use them and wear them constantly.  I have noticed myself that one little boy in particular wore them as a baby in the hope he would speak and make speech like sounds one day.  Well it has been at least 6-12 months since I last saw him and OMG, he's certainly making speech like sounds and even walking now, almost trying to run.  I was just over the moon with joy for his mum.  She also uses what we call here in Australia, Makaton as I also use it with my daughters, although they are not hearing impaired, it stops my eldest from doing what she is doing and helps her focus on what I am saying with my hands which has helped her tremendously.  This little boy's mum has said that the use of hearing aides has aided her son's development greatly.  I hope this little bit of information helps you sweetie.  All the best x

And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given me.

SIhxrxD3aa	Your EFC is just a code used to determine eligibility for certain types of aid.  It is NOT the actual amount you have to pay.  That number is too high to qualify for the Pell grant or other need-based aid.  You will be offered loans, but that's about it.<br>  <br>  If that number was what you actually have to pay, then someone really poor with an EFC of zero could pretty much pick their college and not worry about money.  That's not the way it works.  All it means, is that the lower your EFC the more Pell grant money you qualify for (It's not an infinite amount though).  You are higher than the maximum EFC to qualify for a pell grant.  <br>  <br>  You will be offered up to 5500 in stafford loans, but I doubt that you'll get any grant money unless there is some state grant that you qualify for.  You can look for merit-based scholarships as well.|`|9Qf4khqLaa	The EFC is your estimated family contribution. That means that your family is expected to pay around that amount for your schooling. For financial aid, they also have a minimum unit load you need to have, so if youre only taking a course that may not be enough for a grant. However judging by your EFC, i don't believe you qualify for a grant. I would say that your best bed would be a stafford loan, they require that you maintain half time status to get the money. I would meet with a financial aid counselor at the school you want to attend to discuss what your options are.|`|QJRM2IEEaa	Wow...well if your EFC is that much you're husband must be making good money.That's the bad thing about FAFSA, if you're married it takes into account your spouses financial aid. <br>  I don't know because I don't know what state you're in but if your EFC is that high I don't think you will qualify for Federal GRANTS . HOWEVER, if you can't pay for this, you can get a UNSUBSIDIZED loan meaning you will pay on the interest while you are in school. FAFSA will send these results to whatever school you're applying too and they will send you a paper asking what type of aid you're wanting. You could meet with financial aid counselors to discuss your situation.

pCVjlY1raa	I personally love my Honors and AP classes. I am currently taking four APs. Be prepared to work hard, in class and at home. It's a lot more work, and the work itself is harder. However, it's also really interesting. The teachers talk to you like you're on the same level as them, not like the students are just silly teenagers. It's interesting and your classmates will tend to have the same interests and goals as you. <br>  <br>  I've seen a lot of kids get in over their head, so don't jump in full force with all AP and Honors classes. This is a plan that has worked wonderfully for me: freshman year, take 1 Honors and 1 AP, to learn the format and expectations. Sophomore year, increase that number by one- 2 AP 1 Honors, or 2 Honors 1 AP. Keep increasing each year- by senior year, you'll be adapted to it and have an awesome resume. <br>  <br>  Work with your talents- DO NOT take AP Math if you're terrible at it! Be realistic and consider what you're getting in to.|`|2214a53bd22d6952ae569062b80cb6c5aa	In honors and AP classes your teachers expects more from you. They expect you to actually do the homework, read what you are assigned, and go above and beyond. Especially in AP because its a college course. AP exams are a b----. You should really give those courses a shot. You'll meet a lot more college oriented students in those classes. <br>  <br>  Just make sure you do your homework every night, read what you have to, and DO NOT BE LAZY or it will bit you in the end. Trust me.|`|FzTVi22Uaa	Definitely take a few. You learn a lot more, but a lot more is expected from you. AP World History is relatively easy, but it's scary because it's the first AP course offered, for sophomores. A lot of the higher AP classes--like Literature, Physics, and Chemistry--that are for Seniors are the toughest. It all depends on the teacher, of course, but all of the ones I took were very tough. If you're savvy with math and science, try taking honors Chemistry and Physics, and then see if you want to take the AP courses (which are much more rigorous and intense) by the time you're a Senior. The same goes for Calculus. I didn't have much difficult with the English classes, but I'm studying English in college and much better at it, whereas I didn't take any honors math. It all depends on your strengths. History also has a lot of writing and memorization. Don't underestimate any of the AP classes.
Pl0k5akzaa	i would buy the college board book on the SAT...they're not too expensive and they pretty much cover most of the info. plus they have i think eight practice tests in them and just getting more practice is what i have found most helpful.
AA10541300	Fly,<br>      A 3.0 will get you into almost any marketing or business school - other than the incredibly expensive so called "ivy league colleges".   <br>  <br>    Furthermore, they aren't quite as interested in your gpa as they are your ACT or SAT scores.  High schools vary wildly, so the standardized tests are the great equalizer.  These tests aren't that hard either if you've studied at all, but you can improve your score dramatically by taking practice tests.   You need to get used to the types of questions and get used to the pace at which you need to move in order to finish the test.   Do it in private with a stopwatch.   Trying to do it in a house full of buddies or little brothers and sisters and the tv won't help at all. <br>  <br>     Find good state university and they'll be begging you to come to them.

AA10297143	It isn't bad it is simply the bureaucracy of our lawmakers and the constant whining of a few that affects the entire society.  A world religion class would be fine if we all believed in the same God or how people should live, but we don't.  Religious wars have been fought for centuries and will continue right through Armageddon.  It will be for economic reasons that the world self implodes, but religion will play a huge factor in the destruction of mankind as we know it.

If you are putting it in a Science class, then you are telling everyone who believes something else that they are wrong.  Unfortunately, it cannot be proven to be true, you just believe it to be true.  There is nothing wrong with presenting it in a Science class, as long as you present several different points of view.  However, some people get touchy about religious points of view being presented in a Science class.  It's all about bias.  I speak to my Grade 4 students frequently about different religions and beliefs, but I also speak with them about what others believe.
BmXEfdOTaa	FIU (Fl international)- NO!

You can find these at <a href="http://www.HSLDA.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.HSLDA.org</a> (click on your state in the pull down menu).  So long as you are within those legal requirements, you are free to homeschool in whatever way works best for your child(ren).<br>  <br>  There are many different methods, materials, etc.  so there is not one answer like there would be if you were asking how to change the oil in your car and we could say Step 1. Open the hood, Step 2. Remove the oil cap, Step 3. Add oil to the fill line and Step 4.  Replace oil cap.  It is more like Step 1. Decide to homeschool, Step 2. Select your method and material, Step 3. Revise your method and material as you go along and see what does and does not work, Repeat Step 3.|`|6fVzzNhiaa	I don't think you're asking how well homeschooling works (which is very often just fine), but I can't tell if you're wondering how families interact closely together for days, weeks, months and years, or if you want to know the nuts & bolts of curriculum choice, instruction and evaluation.<br>  <br>  Somehow, I don't think you're asking about family either.  So that leaves a nuts & bolts question, and that answer has many sub-answers because the "how" varies with each family.<br>  <br>  -- Some people use the model of school in their homes with standardized textbooks, tests, and grades.  This is probably what most people envision if they think about homeschooling.<br>  <br>  -- Some people follow the philosophies of people who put together specific outlooks on child development.  Examples might be the ideas of Maria Montessori, Rudolf Steiner or Charlotte Mason.<br>  <br>  -- Some people use unit study programs.  Unit studies center on a specific subject but include techniques from 'across the curriculum:'  reading, writing, math, history, science (where relevant), etc.<br>  <br>  -- Some people unschool, which means a kind of self-learning that parents guide with encouragement, and aid with books and other learning materials.<br>  <br>  -- Some people use a bit from all kinds of schooling and homeschooling as their needs dictate.  This is called eclectic homeschooling.<br>  <br>  If you want to deeply investigate homeschooling, try reading the back-isue articles at Home Education Magazine<br>  <a href="http://www.homeedmag.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.homeedmag.com/</a><br>  <br>  or the links at A to Z's Home's Cool<br>  <a href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/</a>|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	Home schooling is just like any other school, except the environment. At home school, you have a safer, relaxed learning environment.

And where are your grades at right now?<br>  <br>   That would help to know---tutors are usually available at the middle- and high school levels for no cost.  If you have a friend who is exceptional at math and/or science, ask them for help, but beware that a good student is not always a good teacher!  <br>  <br>  Sylvan Learning Centers claims they can raise a student one letter grade in 40 hours of tutoring, but the cost may be more than you and your family can afford (over $100, less than $200).  <br>  <br>  As a teacher, I can tell you that many of your teachers--all though not ALL--will be willing to give you a little extra help IF you are trying your hardest for them.  <br>  <br>  If you just want a quick fix, there isn't one.  <br>  <br>  Study the science text religiously---especially the illustrations and captions, bolded or highlighted text--these usually show up on tests.  Do the end-of-lesson questions on your own as a comprehension check--and then go back and check your answers.<br>  <br>  Math is a little trickier--take LOTS of notes, I mean write everything, every single step, down for later.  If your text offers "extra practice" sets, do these also.  For heaven's sake, make sure you do your assignments, and if you get stuck, lost, or confused, hit up the teacher for help IMMEDIATELY the next class period.  Try Dr. Math or mathcafe.com on the internet for help.

v4YCheYoaa	Please, ignore that comment that exposes the poster as a jerk for the whole world to see. I have a few suggestions for your situation.<br>  <br>  1) There is nothing wrong with relying on a thesaurus for help. I have suggested that people with dyslexia use a thesaurus for help with writing. It is a very good tool. I have to rely on spell checkers all the time. Lots of people have to rely on these tools. That's why they were invented.<br>  <br>  2) People with Dyslexia often find that most of the time is spent trying to proof read. Try using a text-to-speech reader to help you proof read your text. TypeIt ReadIt is a good one and can be download for free at schoolfreeware.com<br>  <br>  3) Keep up your hard work and you will be a success at what you do.<br>  <br>  With that, I bid you a good day and a good life.|`|weDd8uuDaa	hmm.. Well the dyslexia doesnt make it easy.. I think the only thing you really can do is practice outside forums. Tuck away an hour or a few hours to yourself whenever you can and just practice writing about whatever you want. Heck, come answer people's questions on here (if you dont already lol). I think relying on thesauraus.com is fine! Shows you're making an effort.. most of the time people  just write whatever and dont want to use any outside sources because theyre lazy. And when you've written something, leave it alone for a bit and come back to it later and sometimes that helps to see what you couldve done better.|`|29yMjFInaa	I know this sounds a bit cliche, but the best thing I can tell you is to read more books. Books use different vocabulary and also allows you to learn words while in context, so it allows you to solidify your memory of the words. Also try to pay attention to the similes and metaphors because that will allow you to describe things better. Comparisons allow people to visualize what you are saying easier, which in turn, makes you seem like a better writer.
Qr14YyFSaa	definitely not. If you have one life to live why not go for what it is that you really want to be doing? It only makes sense to find something that you love and find a way to make money at it, and if that involves a college education then go for it. 50 and want to be a doctor? Go for it! Studies have shown that keeping your brain active and functioning well by continually learning new things is the best possible thing you could be doing for that particular "muscle".

They might question why you went from a more difficult school to an easier one. You can see how that would look questionable. You'd have to be sure to have an explanation for them on that. <br>  <br>  What top colleges do care about is that you take the most difficult classes in the school you are in. If you do switch schools, be sure to consider this when choosing classes. Also, be sure you can meet the college requirements, look at the websites of colleges you are interested in to see what they require. Some colleges want three years of one foreign language, some prefer four years, etc. <br>  <br>  Can you carpool to your current school? Is there any kind of transportation available to your current school?

It's what you learn. People send their children to better academic schools so they learn better. Actually, colleges accept more kids from worse high schools. My brother, was on the waiting list for Harvard, and we go to a very good private school, and someone from Harlem (the gang part of NY) with worse grades, got in. I think they find it amazing that someone from a bad neighborhood got such good grades. So actually, if your not having problems LEARNING at the school, its actually better for you.

The annexation of Texas soon led to the Mexican War, lasting from 1846 to 1848."

12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	What you are expressing is pretty much wanting to grow up.  You want to become an adult and get away from your parents and make them proud and make great acomplishments for them and yourself.  As for finding yourself you're still unsure what you want to do and are hoping college will do that for you.  I have been waiting to "find myself" for 3 years.  lol.  And the truth is you never really do...because you're always changing.  So, I guess you could say I've found myself many times esp since I've been married during this time.  :)  I've learned to have confidence in who I am and that's really what "finding yourself" is all about.  You will change a lot in life.  Finding yourself is all about having confidence in who you are and making life goals and going after them.  When you take courses in college they'll help you find these goals.  <br>  <br>  If your parents and friends don't share your same interest in edu. when you go to college you'll find people like that but, also some with the same passion as you.  It's great you have passion and motivation and models.  <br>  <br>  When you go to college you'll gain tons more confidence (it may take time but, you will).  You'll meet new people and gain TONS of different perspectives.  Don't hid in your room, get out and meet people and this will help your experience.  College will open you up to new ways of thinking and LOTS of education and more subject matter.  It will also give you the freedom to learn what you want for the most part how much you want of it.  You don't like science?  Pick the right major and you'll only need 1 class.  I don't like math...I made sure my Plan of Study (or required classes for my major) only had 1 year of math.  I'm free!!  lol.   You'll also have new experiences w/ work.  <br>  <br>  So, go to gain new perspectives and more knowledge.  Plus, it will give you a safety net for job security.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qRtYPAUwaa	The parent's thing is a major motivator for me too - the getting away from them part.  :P  Those seem like legit reasons.  <br>  <br>  Another reason would because the job you want requires and education.  I think this may be the biggest reason.  You're going to have to work for the rest of your life until you're old - it might as well be a job that you enjoy.|`|ELbs3Dpwaa	Avoiding the dreaded glass ceiling.

This applies to all levels of jobs not just the "professional" office type.|`|IGuLbST7aa	I think i can understand your love for your parents but also your desire for independence. <br>  <br>  College is very very expensive and is emotionally draining at times. It is also very fun and can be inspiring when you have that really great class that makes you think. Too often, college is all about going to class to get your degree instead of expanding your mind. <br>  <br>  I think your reasons for going to college may not be very fitting. I think you can get away and find yourself by moving out and living on your own. When you become independent and no one is there to tell you what to do and what not to do, you really find out a lot about what makes you YOU. <br>  <br>  While you're young and do not have much holding you back, (career, spouse, baby, etc.) you should honestly try living somewhere you've always wanted to, or try doing something you might not be able to later in life.  <br>  Remember, college isn't necessary for "success"|`|trKgx3Ukaa	In the long distant past, many went to university for the sake of learning rather than to get a well paid job. So, you are in good company if that is your primary reason. It could also mean that you might be suited to an academic career. <br>  <br>  I highly commend your primary motivation: to want to learn. Many positive consequences will flow from this:<br>  <br>  1. motivation to keep studying for the sake of learning<br>  <br>  2. get away from your parents so that you can learn to live independently<br>  <br>  3. your parents will indeed be proud of you when they see you walk across the stage to accept your degree on graduation day. <br>  <br>  4. you will have learned skills to do your own research for whatever life throws at you. Nobody will be able to pull the wool over your eyes, because you will have the skills to evaluate arguments. <br>  <br>  5. it is highly likely that you will find a niche for yourself in academia or wherever you want to be, because your passion for learning will be reflected in excellent grades. <br>  <br>  6. you might even 'find yourself' but that is a lifelong process and going to university is just one important step towards that particular goal. <br>  <br>  I wish you well in your endeavors for learning, you are a rare breed in this regard, and you are to be commended for it. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

fPOg9DuXaa	I don't know the age of your students, but I taught a similar lesson with customary units to my third grades, and one way that I got them really engaged as an anticipatory set was to give them a ruler and have them measure things in their desks/ classrooms. They loved this! <br>  <br>  If you wanted to add the estimation component into the anticipatory set, you could have they make a guess about how long their desk, chair leg, eraser, etc. They could record their guesses. Then they could acually measure those same objects to check their estimations. <br>  <br>  For weight, you could do something very similar, but you might have to do it whole class because you probably don't have a class set of scales. It could be really fun whole class though, have students make guesses about the weight of something, and then record those on the booard, then have a student come up and actually measure it and see who was closest. They love that sort of thing. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!
TApX9Vogaa	First of all, tell your parents/guardians.  If it really is an issue then they need to be aware of it.<br>  <br>  Your parent should then contact the principal or assistant principal and explain their concern.  If the teacher makes you that uncomfortable then you shouldn't be in that class.  It is possible to request another teacher.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, document every time you notice him doing it.  Write down the date, time and what happened.  And if he gets even more forward, for goodness sakes find another adult on campus - a teacher, nurse, guidance counselor - and get them to help you right away!|`|bY4jY78Daa	go to your school district and tell the superintendent, he or she will probably fire the teacher.|`|AA11887047	there should be a law that if you accuse someone of this and it is found not true you are guilty of a crime.

Plan on at least 12-16 years after high school until you can be fully licensed.  Ophthalmology is one of the hardest specialties to land so study hard, but also know that once you are in medical school you will likely change your mind about what type of medicine you would like to practice. Any other questions on this subject that you have I would be happy to answer. I am quite knowledgeable in this area. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: And just for your information an optometrist is not a medical doctor, optometrists go to optometry school, not medical school and practice general eye care.

In many cases this involves participating in some kind of research, either for yourself, the professor, or his grad students.  The possibilities are endless but in general the prof will have fixed requirements to what kind of directed study you can do with them.  <br>  <br>  Some profs do not accept any students as they are under no obligation to do so.  Professors tend to be very busy so you need to do some arm twisting to get them to allow you in.  Usually if you take a regular course the prior semesters with them and earn a good grade, they willbe more inclined to accept you as they know you better.  And no, they do not get paid more as they are obligated to teach courses only.  This isn't technically a course.  Back in my days, I had to ask several professors and was rejected until I finally got one that would take me in, after a little pleading on the knees.  But it was a great experience.  If you are thinking of grad school one day then you absolutely MUST do some kind of directed study course.  This will get you a more serious consideration, plus you get a meaningful letter of recommendation from the professor as they can truly write you one.  But even if you don't care about grad school, it's still a good experience as it sure beats a regular class setting.

AA10788586	i assume you're going to a 4-year college correct? but either way, it's always good to get your BSN before you take the board exam >> NCLEX-RN << and if you pass it then you're be qualified as a RN. i myself also spent 4 years to get my BSN before passing the board exam and became a RN. many people would just go straight to take the exam after they've earned an associate degree in science to become a RN, that way they save time and money. but i wouldn't suggest you to go for the shortcut, the BSN comes in very helpful in the long run as if you want to advance to a higher degree like DNP - master degree in nursing, very very good money. lol but anyways, just try to have fun with the pre-nursing courses for now and worry about being a RN later. i'm sure your professors will give you a lot of help and you'll understand more about the consequences of becoming a nurse.|`|AA10348541	No, BSN means that you have a Bachelor's degree in nursing.

There are also  2 year associate degree in applied science programs, and there are three year diploma programs offered by hospital based nursing programs.

The difference comes later, some employers offer a larger salary to BSN nurses, and there are a wider selection of jobs open to BSN. Then there is the masters programs.|`|f2e16d7c6053478d7e7c9e4f4cf0fd7faa	There are 2 year and 4 year degrees of Nursing.  A BSN is the Bachelor's 4 year program while one can become a Registered Nurse with a two year degree.  However, some Universities/Colleges do not offer the two year degree, depending on the state.  <br>  As far as pay...the difference between a two and four year degree can vary.  In some areas, where the demand for healthcare professionals is high, you could easily make about the same with a two year degree as with a four.  However, if you want to progress in your career say into management, the four year degree is the way to progress to  Master's and Doctorate.

Informal spook. Regional haunt. See beings, supernatural.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Phantom Knight of the Vandal Camp<br>  <br>  by Gesta Romanorum<br>  <br>  There was once in Great Britain, a knight named Albert, strong in arms and adorned with every virtue. One day as he was seeking for adventure, he chanced to wander into a castle where he was hospitably entertained.<br>  <br>  At night, after supper, as was usual in great families during the winter, the household gathered about the hearth and occupied the time in relating divers tales.<br>  <br>  At last they told how in the near-by plain of Wandlesbury there was a haunted mound. There in old days the Vandals, who laid waste the land and slaughtered Christians, had pitched their camp and built about it a great rampart. And it was further related that in the hush of the night, if any one crossed the plain, ascended the mound, and called out in a loud voice, "Let my adversary appear!" there immediately started up from the ruined ramparts a huge, ghostly figure, armed and mounted for battle. This phantom then attacked the knight who had cried out and speedily overcame him.<br>  <br>  Now, when Albert heard this marvelous tale, he greatly doubted its truth, and was determined to put the matter to a test. As the moon was shining brightly, and the night was quiet, he armed, mounted, and immediately hastened to the plain of Wandlesbury, accompanied by a squire of noble blood.<br>  <br>  He ascended the mound, dismissed his attendant, and shouted:<br>  <br>  "Let my adversary appear!"<br>  <br>  Instantly there sprang from the ruins a huge, ghostly knight completely armed and mounted on an enormous steed.<br>  <br>  This phantom rushed upon Albert, who spurred his horse, extended his shield, and drove at his antagonist with his lance. Both knights were shaken by the encounter. Albert, however, so resolutely and with so strong an arm pressed his adversary that the latter was thrown violently to the ground. Seeing this Albert hastily seized the steed of the fallen knight, and started to leave the mound.<br>  <br>  But the phantom, rising to his feet, and seeing his horse led away, flung his lance and cruelly wounded Albert in the thigh. This done he vanished as suddenly as he had appeared.<br>  <br>  Our knight, overjoyed at his victory, returned in triumph to the castle, where the household crowded around him and praised his bravery. But when he put off his armor he found the cuish from his right thigh filled with clots of blood from an angry wound in his side. The family, alarmed, hastened to apply healing herbs and bandages.<br>  <br>  The captured horse was then brought forward. He was prodigiously large, and black as jet. His eyes were fierce and flashing, his neck proudly arched, and he wore a glittering war-saddle upon his back.<br>  <br>  As the first streaks of dawn began to appear, the animal reared wildly, snorted as if with pain and anger, and struck the ground so furiously with his hoofs that the sparks flew. The black cock of the castle crew and the horse, uttering a terrible cry, instantly disappeared.<br>  <br>  And every year, on the selfsame night, at the selfsame hour, the wounds of the knight Albert broke out afresh, and tormented him with agony. Thus till his dying day he bore in his body a yearly reminder of his encounter with the Phantom Knight of the Vandal Camp.|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	i think its a ghost that haunts because something was never finished that was supposed to and wont rest til that thing happens|`|b81e235a8a83639306d5862c1ba468e2aa	From the dictionary:<br>  <br>  NOUN: <br>  Something apparently seen, heard, or sensed, but having no physical reality; a ghost or an apparition. <br>  Something elusive or delusive. <br>  An image that appears only in the mind; an illusion. <br>  Something dreaded or despised. <br>  ADJECTIVE: <br>  Resembling, characteristic of, or being a phantom; illusive. <br>  Fictitious; nonexistent: phantom employees on the payroll. <br>  <br>  ETYMOLOGY: <br>  Middle English fantom, from Old French fantosme, probably from Vulgar Latin *phantauma, from Greek dialectal *phantagma, from Greek phantasma ; see phantasm <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just another word for "ghost" "spectre" "phantasm" "spirit"|`|8485e1fb8640d03665e95251eb4186bbaa	Something that can be seen or heard or whose presence can be felt, but that is not physically present.

f8f6bca178d41ba5d85a13eaf4c2f300aa	Why tobacco shouldn't be illegal? so be legal?<br>  Well, there was the Prohibition of Alcohol....back in the early 1900's there was a law making alcohol illegal. The government thought it would solve a lot of problems, but it only made it worse. People started making big money on smuggling the stuff and selling it. They became very wealthy and the police couldn't catch all of them!! And more people spent more money because they got more desperate for it. And because the beer was bootlegged, there was a bunch of bacteria in it, so a lot of people got sick. The whole country just splattered. So the government removed the law because it didn't work out. It took a while to recover, but let's not make the same law again!! <br>  If we make tobacco illegal, the same thing will happen. Too many people are addicted and will start smuggling it. Instead, they should pass laws that if people get addicted to that stuff, the community won't have to pay for their mistake in taxes...<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!!<br>  Have fun!!|`|AA11246026	There was an investigation into the tobacco stuff, and it's being proved that the nicotine in cigarettes have doubled if not tripled!!! That's making it ALMOST impossible for adults and teens alike to quit. And also, a law has been passed where you're not gonna  be able to smoke in public places as of next year, if I'm not mistaken. It's also supposed to be against the law to smoke in a closed vehicle with a child present. (The child is a certain age or under.) Hope I've been of help.|`|d02f24190cb25cae3e2ab7e4c5115a05aa	it is very harmful to the body and if it is continued to be used it can eventually laed to death.<br>  it can also cause alot of pain for a long period of time then eventually lead to death.<br>  Did you know that just smelling can kill you if your system is not use to it, yes it can.|`|c68bba7adac9021d3e2c63ea64c730f5aa	Unfortunately for you, I cannot give you any "good" reasons for illegalizing use of tobacco.  What right does the government have to take away one of America's chief agricultural commodities.  Yes, its harmful for people to smoke but so is it harmful to get drunk or eat too much food over your life time.  Does that make it right for the government to restrict one from doing that?  No!  The government tried outlawing alcohal once and that worked like a charm didn't it.  I mean, they really listened and never drank didn't they...  Good luck with that paper.  We need to get the message out that the government is there for a good reason but they shouldn't be controling what someone does in their home or with their family.

qBxedGgwaa	Folktales are often stories of animals that act like humans, and that live in a world of wonder and magic. Most of these stories convey a message or moral to the reader, or explain something in a creative way. Folktales are often passed down and retold from generation to generation.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Step 2: Brainstorming Previous Next <br>  <br>  <br>  There are a lot of important ideas that go into creating a good folktale! Our folktale experts have come up with tips to help you get off to a good start. Read through them, and start making notes for your own folktale.<br>  <br>  We learn to write by reading. If you want to write a good folktale, read. Read as many folktales as you can get your hands on, and you'll begin to capture the style and feeling that goes into creating one. The more you read, the more your mind will learn to picture things for itself, in your own special way.<br>  <br>  Pay attention to the world around you. Once you have an idea for a story, try to imagine the world where it takes place. Is it a real world or an imaginary one? What is the place like? Describe your setting with color, smells, and noises. Describe how something tastes, or how it feels to touch. Research your setting. Read about the trees that grow in that location, the animals that live in that climate, the typical plants and flowers. Be accurate in your descriptions.<br>  <br>  Plan the timing of events in your story. You must sustain the interest of your reader. Keep adding details to your story. Don't rush the end.<br>  <br>  Remember that folktales are stories that are meant to be told. Try writing your folktale as if you were telling it to a friend. Many folktales use phrases that are easy to remember, like "once upon a time" or "in a land far, far away." You might also come up with repeated verses or phrases like the ones in "Half-Chicken": <br>  "Good-bye, good-bye!<br>  I'm off to Mexico City<br>  to see the court of the viceroy!" <br>  Using rhymes and classic storytelling expressions will make it easier for you to remember the details of your story as you're telling it.<br>  <br>  Invite the reader to hear your character think and feel, to enter his or her mind, to know the character intimately. Don't tell the reader what your characters are saying ? let them speak for themselves. <br>  Instead of:<br>  John told his mother he wanted to go out. He tried to convince her to let him go see his uncle Joe. <br>  Try:<br>  "Mom, it'd be wonderful to see Uncle Joe," John said. "You always say you want me to learn new things. I learn lots from Uncle Joe." <br>  Don't stare at the blank page or screen. If ideas don't seem to come, begin writing anyway. One word will invite others. Keep on writing. Maybe you will discard some sentences later on, but you will be on your way. <br>  <br>  1. <br>  Create your main character. Describe how your character looks. Is he or she tall or short, animal or human? Does he or she have big feet? A small head? Is she young or old? Draw your character on a piece of paper to help you imagine him or her. Then, once you have a clear picture of your character, think about his or her personality. Is he gentle, brave, dumb, clever, generous, greedy? What are the things your character is known for? How will his or her personality affect your folktale?<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  2.<br>   Decide what message you want your folktale to give your reader. Folktales often explain a phenomenon in the world, or tell a lesson about human nature. For example, my folktale "Half-Chicken" explains how weather vanes first came to be — but it also tells the reader a message about how helping others will make those others want to help you. As you begin planning your folktale, think about what moral or lesson you want your story to tell. The way your plot develops will depend on this message.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  3.<br>   Plan your plot. A good story will need: <br>  <br>  an interesting, engaging beginning <br>  a conflict or moment of tension — a question to be answered, or something that needs to be resolved <br>  an ending that is satisfying because the conflict has been resolved or the question has been answered <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  The message of the story is important — but it's also critical that you make that message part of a good story!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  4.<br>   Revision Guidelines. Are you finished with the challenges? Have you done a first draft of your folktale? Then, it's time to begin revising. Writers will tell you that rewriting is one of the most important parts of writing — n fact, some even think it's the most important! Here are some tips I always find helpful when I begin revising my own work.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  5.<br>   Review the my tips and check to make sure you've used as many as possible in your writing. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  6.<br>   Read your folktale with an objective eye. As a writer, you can get so close to your work that you might miss something that doesn't make sense to others. Ask a friend to read your story for you. Does it make sense? Does it flow well? <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  7.<br>   Make sure your dialogue works for your characters. Each character needs to have a different style of talking,just the way people do! <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  8.<br>   Read your folktale out loud to a friend or family member. Remember that folktales are designed to be told. Is your story interesting, short, easy to remember? Is the language you've used easy to remember and conversational? Have you used phrases to help you remember your story?|`|46465463e9a9114f6aea1c68a978589daa	There are all kinds of tales about how the Great Lakes were formed or the Grand Canyon.  I’m not saying whether they are true or not, but I know the story my pa told me and his pa told him and that’s the story I’m going to tell you now so listen well!<br>  <br>  It seems like a long time ago, a very long time ago, there were giants that walked on the earth.  I’m not talking about people 10 feet tall - no, these giants were as tall as the Empire State Building in New York City - maybe even taller!  Some say that they kept dinosaurs for pets like we keep cats and dogs now, but I don’t know if I believe that or not.  It seems pretty far-fetched to me.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, these people were huge!  They were so big that there were only a few families on the whole earth.  One family made their house on the continent we call North America.  They were a very nice couple as far as giant couple go, but they had a very mean tempered little girl.  Her name was Lulu Nellie.  Lulu Nellie could be just as sweet as pie when things were going her way, but if she wanted something and didn’t get it she acted just terrible!  Remember I said that there were a lot of different stories about how the land is shaped?  Well, if you look at the Great Lakes, you’ll see they look like a hand print.  Lulu Nellie didn’t want to eat her vegetable soup one night for supper (the vegetables looked like floating pine trees and bushes), and when her mother insisted, Lulu Nellie just threw herself on the floor and had a temper tantrum.  She kicked so hard her bowl fell on the floor and spilled all over.  She slapped her hands so hard on the floor that one hand went right through and left a print in the mud made by the spilled soup!  Later on when her dad washed the dinosaur the water filled up Lulu Nellie’s hand print making the 5 Great Lakes.  Sometimes sailors see a floating pea or piece of corn, but no one talks about it because they don’t want people to think they’re crazy.<br>  <br>  Well, time went by and the giants wanted to have more children but there just wasn’t any room left on the earth for more giants.  They talked it over and decided they would have to leave the earth and go to other planets where they would have more room.  They started building a huge spaceship to take them there.  They knew they couldn’t take too much with them because the ship would be too heavy.  Lulu Nellie wanted to take her pet dinosaur Rocky with her, but her parents said no because then everyone would want to take their dinosaur and there just wasn’t enough room.<br>  <br>  The day finally came for the launch of the spaceship.  Everyone stood at the entrance to take one last look at earth.  Lulu Nellie was very sad because Rocky had to stay on earth.  Her dad had chained Rocky to his dinosaur house so he wouldn’t follow them to the spaceship even though he could see them.  The command was made to shut the door on the spaceship and Lulu Nellie wanted to stay to the last minute which her parents said would be okay.  But just as the door started to close, Lulu Nellie called Rocky to come to her!  <br>  <br>  Rocky roared and grunted but the chain held him to his dinosaur house.  Lulu Nellie called him again and clapped her hands.  The countdown was going to start at any minute!  She called Rocky again.  With a mighty heave Rocky pulled and started dragging his dinosaur house behind him as he ran to Lulu Nellie and the spaceship.  The dinosaur house bounced and dragged across the land behind Rocky and finally with one great leap he jumped next to Lulu Nellie.  Lulu Nellie took one last look outside before the door closed and was glad her parents didn’t see what Rocky had done!  Where the dinosaur house had dragged on the ground was a long, huge gouge.  We call it The Grand Canyon....

Every basic communications course has slightly different steps but usually they begin with 1. making eye contact, 2. listening attentively, 3.rephrasing what you think you just heard to see if you understood it correctly, step 4 may be asking questions or it may be remembering what you heard in steps two and three and it is usually stated simply as 'remembering'.|`|c4c4c5b1cd86dc4f96565acd273c90a9aa	listening. gather facts/evidence. test your hypothesis. create a thesis.

AA10834026	Cue cards should give you visual cues - not complete sentences to read.  Consider getting index cards in colors to divide your topic.  That way, you will see the color and know what aspect of the topic you are moving into.  Choose one meaningful word to head the card with - so that when you glance down you will see the general sense that card means to your topic.  Write down the difficult phrases or words that you want to convey that will get you through your topic.  If you write down sentences....you will feel dependent upon reading them.  Practice until you feel comfortable with the topic.  Don't forget EVERYONE is nervous reading from cue cards - but the more comfortable you are with your topic  - the easier it will be.  Good luck!|`|671SwG7Raa	How do you study for exams?  It's the same way you should study your cards. Maybe you should have several different index cards with less info on them.  What I do is break down each topic I am talking about into subtopics. Then write cards out for the sub topic and memorize those.   It is much easier that way, than to study with a big block of info.
jV94HPaDaa	You need:<br>  <br>  1) a highschool diploma (or GED)<br>  <br>  2) an undergraduate diploma (no specific major is necessary, although common ones are political science, philosophy, and business). This usually takes at least four years of full-time study. You must also complete the LSAT exam.<br>  <br>  3) Juris Doctor (Doctorate of Law Degree). This usually takes about three years of full-time study. You must also pass the Bar Exam in order to practice law in any given jurisdiction.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

IB Is also much easier than Ap classes and the scholarship def worths it. Ap is so pointless if you are going into medical or dental professions or even planning to go to graduate school because you'll have to take all those AP credits agian in college. I personally did Ap and not IB, on the other hand my cousin is much more satisfied with his current situation. he did not waste four years taking AP classes and now take all those classes again in College!

Souvent devant son ordinateur pour préparer les campagnes en mer, son activité principale consiste à traiter les données recueillies lors d’expéditions pour mettre en place des programmes de protection.<br>  Actuellement, la tendance est au travail sur l'environnement du littoral (observation et surveillance des pollutions chimiques, microbiologie), la gestion des ressources halieutiques (exploitation des fonds marins, pêche). Ses études permettent d'évaluer l’état de l’environnement et de prévenir les dégats causés par tel ou tel type de pollution, telles interactions entre les activités humaines ou tels changements climatiques. <br>  <br>  Les océanologues sont avant tout des scientifiques de haut niveau avec, la plupart du temps, une double formation. Ils doivent savoir rédiger, avoir une certaine habileté manuelle et technique, l'esprit d'équipe et des capacités d'adaptation. Savoir parler anglais et la ma?trise de l'informatique sont indispensables. <br>  <br>  FORMATION : Les filières spécifiques pour l'océanographie sont rares. Il existe quelques formations courtes comme le dipl?me d'études scientifiques et techniques (DEUST) préparé à l'université en 2 ans après le bac ou le dipl?me de technicien supérieur de la mer (DTC) du CNAM. A l'université, les formations longues sont des DESS et DEA comme par exemple le DESS mesures – instrumentation – surveillance – sols - atmosphère et océan à Toulon, l'Ecole supérieure d'ingénieurs de Marseille (option génie marin) ou l'Ecole centrale de Paris (option océan).|`|AhFhek9daa	Pour devenir océanographe (faire de la recherche), il faut faire des études scientifiques : DEUG (bac + 2) de sciences à l'université (soit science de la matière, mathématiques et physique pour faire de l'océanographie physique, soit sciences de la nature et de la vie pour faire de l'océanographie biologique). Ce n'est qu'à partir de la ma?trise (bac + 4) que commence la spécialisation en océanographie, de physique, de chimie-physique ou de biologie des populations et des écosystèmes ou sciences de l'environnement). Ensuite il faut faire un DEA et enfin terminer par une thèse si vous avez la chance d'être accepté dans un laboratoire.

If you're going after a pedigree then go for a big name (UCLA, USC, Stanford etc.) but if you just want to be useful as a civil engineer then find a school fairly close to home that you would live at (do not commute from home) and that doesn't cost too much (the UC schools and the Cal State schools are all good)  Being in California you have a lot of choice and you can get a solid degree from just about anywhere.
gAmtcVlMaa	Congrats on your recent degree.  Unfortunately, which law school you go to matters to a large degree.  Very few law schools (probably the top 20 or so) are "national" law schools--meaning you can graduate there and go anywhere in the nation.  Otherwise a law school is usually a regional one--meaning that you're more likely to get a job in one part of the country/region/state/city.<br>  <br>  For example, someone going to Harvard or Yale, I hate to tell you, will likely get a job anywhere simply because they went to Harvard or Yale.  Then there are very good regional schools.  Take UVA.  You would be able to get a job anywhere on the East coast (assuming you did moderately well).  KU--you could do really well in the central Midwest.  Then there are some schools that are not really known where you will only be able to work in the state/city where the school is located.<br>  <br>  Law schools also have an impact on what type of law you want to practice.  Vermont Law School is not exceptionally well known or well regarded...unless you want to be an environmental lawyer and then they have the top program in the nation.  Stetson in Florida is the same for trial lawyers.  American University for international law.<br>  <br>  The other piece of advice that I would give you is...don't go to law school unless you *know* you want to practice law.  This is an unfortunate situation: how will you know you want to practice law unless you go to law school?  Can't help you with that one.  I just knew.<br>  <br>  Here's why I give that advice: law schools are expensive and becoming increasingly so (and those that are "cheap" are likely to be less well-regarded).  By the time you graduate, pretty much the only profession that can help you pay back your loans in a timely manner is the legal profession.  It used to be that a law degree was helpful for any profession that you chose to go into.  While that's still the case, not just "any profession" will give you the salary you need.<br>  <br>  This is a really tough decision.  Perhaps you should try a masters degree from a respected state institution (as Army, you should be able to get in-state tuition at any state institution).  I would hold off on the law school until you were sure.|`|J7UWoek5aa	What law school you go to matters A LOT. Trust me, your job opportunities out of law school are basically determined by what school you went to. If you are this unsure about what you want to do then take sometime off. Law school is a huge 3 year commitment that is a lot of work. You have to really want to be there to be able to handle all of it, despite the massive amount of debt. Why don't you stay with the army, and take that time to reflect on what you want to do. Law school are looking more and more into students who are out of college and have real work experience because it shows that they know how to prioritize, and what they wan to do with there live. You can also take this time to prepare you application so it can be the best it can be.<br>  <br>  I suggest reading law school confidential, paper chase, and ivey's guide to law school admissions (look all three up and yahoo and read into law school and its admissions process).
Ss9kQoxpaa	Hello<br>  <br>  diamond comes from the greek adamas (modern greek adamantas or diamanti). a-damas. 1)"a" When u  put an alfa before the word, the meaning changes to the opposite. That's why this alfa in greek grammar is named as "alfa steritikon" ="alfa privative" 2)"damas" this comes from the verb "damazo" which means "tame", "subdue" So adamas in greek means the material that cannot be tamed. <br>  Ancient greeks knew that diamond was the toughest material on earth.|`|05f1223848f225cee230dca8b05a24bbaa	Here's what I found from dictionary.com:<br>  Diamond: [Middle English diamaunt, from Old French diamant, from Medieval Latin diamās-, diamant-, alteration of Latin adamās; see adamant.]|`|OMSjdd5Zaa	adamas.

J7UWoek5aa	Law school admissions is very number based. If I was to roughly    break down how much each component was weight it would be- GPA, LSAT, and soft factors. <br>  <br>  For a school like Harvard they want a GPA above 3.75 from a top university. This GPA will be recalculated once you send your transcripts to the LSAC. It will be judged based on the major you were in, the classes you took, and the university you went to (and how rigorous they are). <br>  <br>  Your LSAT should be 170+, which would put you in the 99% of people who took it. They might give you a break if you are a minority (Spanish, black, native american) or if you have a history of being a bad standardized test taker but still succeed in your school work. <br>  <br>  Soft factors are basically everything else. This includes your personal statement, letters of recommendation, resume, work experience, gender, age, sexuality, economic status, and geographical background. <br>  <br>  Basically all three things are weighted the same. You can look at their acceptance rate online. I suggest buying the book How To Get Into a Top Law School, Ivey's guide to law school admissions, and law school confidential. They will go into more detail of each of these components, and provide great insight into the law school admissions process and law school itself.|`|7ca44a3727786e789f15a19554574c39aa	What minority you are (rural, homeschool, black, hispanic)<br>  <br>  Your grades back to 8th grade<br>  <br>  You SAT and ACT scores<br>  <br>  Your LSAT test<br>  <br>  Your famility history (did one of them go to Harvard)<br>  <br>  Your GPA|`|iBFe40JNaa	People who are willing to do their own research.

43370627d559fca4abe86e8a0754cd39aa	En la mitología griega Dafne (en griego Δ?φνη, ‘laurel’) era una dríade (ninfa de los árboles), hija del dios río Ladon de Arcadia con Gea o del dios río Peneo de Tesalia.<br>  <br>  Dafne fue perseguida por Apolo, a quien Eros había disparado una flecha dorada para que se enamorase de ella, pues estaba celoso porque Apolo había bromeado sobre sus habilidades como arquero, y también afirmaba que el canto de éste le molestaba. Dafne huyó de Apolo porque Eros le había disparado a su vez una flecha con punta de plomo, que provocaba desprecio y desdén. Durante la persecución, Dafne imploró ayuda al dios del río Peneo, quien la transformó en laurel, árbol que desde ese momento se convirtió en sagrado para Apolo.|`|roxFVWOaaa	Los griegos denominaban al laurel daphne debido a la leyenda por la que la ninfa Daphne fue convertida en laurel con el fin de eludir a Apolo:<br>  <br>  “Apolo, que había matado a la terrible serpiente Pitón, estaba muy orgulloso de su haza?a y se sentía invencible. Para que no se olvidara este hecho instituyó unos juegos en los que el vencedor ce?iría su cabeza con la rama de un árbol cualquiera, todavía no existía el laurel.<br>  <br>  En estos juegos, Apolo al ver la maestría de Cupido en el uso del arco, se enfadó mucho y le prohibió utilizar esas armas, porque el había matado a la Pitón, y sólo él podía usarlas. Le ordenó que utilizara sus flechas para encender amores. Cupido entonces echó a volar y saco dos flechas de su carcaj, una ahuyentaba el amor y la otra hacía que brotara.<br>  <br>  La que hacía brotar el amor era de oro y atravesó certeramente el pecho de Apolo, la otra flecha era de plomo e hirió a la ninfa Dafne. Dafne, sin posibilidad ya de conocer el amor corrió malherida a esconderse en el bosque. Muchos la pretendían, pero ella se ocultaba, rechazaba cualquier acercamiento, la sola idea del matrimonio hacía que se volviese como loca.<br>  <br>  Un día que Apolo paseaba por el bosque, se encontró con Dafne y al mirar su bello rostro se desbocó su corazón y ya solo quiso unirse a ella para siempre. Dafne huyó de él en una loca carrera mientras Apolo tras ella le suplicaba que parase, que escuchara sus palabras de amor que no quería hacerle da?o solo amarla. Apolo no sabía que la pobre Dafne no podría amar nunca. Herida y sin fuerzas cayó de rodillas a la orilla del río Peneo, su padre, y le suplicó que la transformara y le quitara la belleza que le causaba tanto dolor. Cuando terminó de hablar, sintió que la torpeza se apoderaba de sus brazos y piernas, apenas podía dar un paso, su cuerpo empezaba a cubrirse de una tierna corteza, de sus pies salían raíces que penetraban hondamente la tierra y sus brazos se alargaron hacia el cielo convertidos en delicadas ramas.<br>  <br>  Cuando llegó Apolo, apenado y dolorido ante esa visión, se abrazó fuertemente al tronco del árbol colmándolo de besos y mojando de lagrimas su corteza todavía era capaz de oír los latidos del corazón que se hallaba dentro Entre sollozos le dijo: "Ya que no puedes ser mi esposa, serás mi árbol ?OH, laurel! , adornarás mi cabellera y tu follaje permanecerá siempre verde. El laurel, inclinó su copa hacia la cabeza de Apolo y él supo que sus súplicas habían sido escuchadas.”<br>  <br>  El árbol se convirtió en sagrado para los Dioses y se utilizaba en las fiestas en su honor, y cuando el culto pasó a Roma, con laurel se fabricaron las cintas que coronaban las cabezas de los vencedores y de los poetas, uso que permaneció en vigor durante mucho tiempo; incluso la corona de Napoleón representaba una guirnalda de laurel. <br>  <br>  Aún hoy un deportista con muchos premios es uno de los mas laureado. No se suele dar el premio Nobel, sino que se laurea con el premio Nobel,....<br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...

AA12301762	Well, since your already a junior just finish high school and get your diploma! Then join the military! i see that aviation and the medical is first in your list. the military can help you out a lot. if you join the air-force you'll for sure be trained to fly an airplane, and when you get out you'll be certified to fly a plane and have experience. And if you want to be a doctor or nurse, the militaries programs are pretty good, and again if you get out, you'll be certified and have experience!|`|037ea5eeaad7c210240ba457cee691b6aa	I'm going to be a Junior, too. I have interviewed a person in the Medical field and have a lot of family in that field as well. If you decide that is what you want to do, you'll have to make sacrifices. You will have to sacrifice time and having a "social" life. In college, you will need to get a 3.5 to a 3.75 GPA, which a lot of ppl had trouble with in high school (although high school is 10 time easier.) You will also need to study a lot at the end of the 4 yrs undergraduate, since you will want to do well on your MCAT. Just getting accepted into Medical School is difficult. The 1/3 acceptance rate at a Med School in my rate is considered very "non selective" although that is a very small chance (and you'll be competing with extremely intelligent individuals.)<br>  Once you're in Med. School, that will have to be your priority. You will be constantly studying to maintain good grades, since you'll be paying so much just to attend the school. <br>  Residency follows, which is the most rigorous of all. You will have 7 day work weeks for the 3-4 years required in residency. During those days you'll be working 14 hours each day. (I am not sure if you get payed during Residency or not.) That is that part where people decide, "This is not for me."<br>  <br>  But if you are one of the few who make it thru, being any kind of doctor is very rewarding; not only the money, but knowing you saved someone's life is the best pay out.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't think you are capable of such hard work, you can always consider dentistry or optometry. They are lower than other types of doctors and have lower pay, but they require less training and are less selective fields.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW, I am considering Medicine, Aviation, and Law as well!<br>  <br>  Good Luck with whatever you choose!

Firstly, GET OFF THE COMPUTER AND STUDY!<br>  The best way to study is in someplace comfortable but not TOO comfortable so you don't get drowsy. <br>  Get ALL your stuff, like books and notebooks together before hand and keep them close by. (this includes pencils, pens and pencil sharpeners, earasers, etc.)<br>  A little quiet Music usually helps me focus, especially if it's in headphones.<br>  I usually keep a tall glass of tea next to me so I'm not tempted to get up and get a drink or a bite to eat. <br>  The best way to study is to ELEMINATE all distractions and not tempt yourself to go do something else.<br>  So get your music and a snack or something, sit down at your desk in a quiet room, that's the best way to study.|`|2f7b5efddb7013222db12da83d4cac82aa	seek spiritual help with advice given you by above poster<br>  follow spiritual path and then see the result<br>  donot forget to inform me|`|NZy0pxwEaa	Go somewhere with no distractions. I know sometimes it's easy to let your mind wander even with that though, so what I do is go out of my way.  I drive somewhere further away, go somewhere more difficult to get too, go at an odd time. These things make you more inclined to study somehow cause you're thinking.. "well, i came all the way down here..." or "only an hour until this place closes.. ought to get that whole hour in" <br>  Group studying is good only if your group is intensely into it, otherwise you won't get much done either.

However, it is so highly preferred that rarely is anyone admitted without it. How long it takes to complete your undergrad coursework is determined by you. It does not take everyone 4 years. If you take AP courses in high school and make an adequate score on the AP exam, then those courses can be used for college credit. Even without AP credit many students complete the requirements for a BA/BS within 3 years. <br>  <br>  Most US medical schools with an Early medical school acceptance program will accept exceptional students with a certain SAT/ACT score prior to entrance into an undergrad university, but you still have to complete a bachelor's first. I know of a few universities with a 6 or 7 year program (you complete certain undergrad courses the first couple of years, then complete your medical school coursework), but I wouldn't attend any of them because they aren't that good.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Well, yes, but your taxes are much higher than are ours, so everyone pays for it.  We have most of the costs paid by those who attend.  College (tuition only, not including room and board, can cost from about $20,000 to about $160,000 for four years, depending upon whether you go to a public or private university, where you live, and how exclusive the school is.  I should also point out that there are government grants available for low income students which often reduce the cost of tuition to nothing, while those who can afford to go are expected to pay for it.  Lainarah's numbers are way off - too high for public universities (but maybe she is assuming out-of-state tuition) and too low for private ones.|`|AA12021966	It depends on which college.

That's not including room and board which is about 8000 for public, and 15000 for private. Those are just my estimations from my college search.

Much easier to do well.<br>  <br>  <br>  Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  I deleted the wikipedia on vegetarianism, here's one for vegans.<br>  <br>  <br>  Veganism is a diet and lifestyle that seeks to exclude the use of animals for food, clothing, or any other purpose.[1][2] Vegans endeavor not to use or consume animal products of any kind.[3] The most common reasons for becoming a vegan are an ethical commitment or moral convictions concerning animal rights, the environment, human health, and spiritual or religious concerns.[4][5][2] Of particular concern are the practices involved in factory farming and animal testing, and the intensive use of land and other resources required for animal farming.<br>  <br>  Various polls have reported vegans to be between 0.2%[4] and 1.3%[6] of the U.S. population, and between 0.25%[5] and 0.4%[7] of the UK population.<br>  <br>  Vegan diets (sometimes called strict or pure vegetarian diets) are a subset of vegetarian diets, which are credited with lowering the risk of colon cancer, heart attack, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, prostate cancer, and stroke.[8] Properly planned vegan diets are healthful and have been found to satisfy nutritional needs.[9] However, poorly planned vegan diets can be low in levels of calcium, iodine, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. Vegans are therefore encouraged to plan their diet and take dietary supplements as appropriate.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Oh, sorry hunni :.)<br>  Okay, i obviously find nothing wrong with vegetarianism. But i went Vegan once and i got food poisoning from drinking soy milk. I was having trouble sleeping(probably from the lack of food)and i just picked up the carton, i thought it was dr pepper, and i drank a large amount.<br>  If one commits to becoming a vegan, one has to know the rules, or get kicked out of the club. And there really are too many rules with that diet. It is unnecessary to be vegan, and it is, no matter what anyone says, harmful to a healthy body and mind.<br>  I once heard that vegans don't eat tomatoes.<br>  It has a bad rep!|`|j0JyIBGAaa	Im a vegetarian i.e I don't eat ANYTHING that has been alive!

XMPJelxgaa	I would be glad to help, but are you sure that you can choose absolutely anything at all? We don't even know what is your subject.<br>  As for advice, I suggest that you should be original when choosing a topic - it always helps me out. Let's say that you find a topic you would like to talk about and some interesting facts regarding this topic that few people know about.<br>  For example, it's September right now, so in most countries it means that a new school year has begun - why don't you find some interesting facts about school traditions in different countries - you can tell it shortly and everybody will receive a piece of information they didn't know before. In my country, for example, we have a "teacher's day" at the beginning of the school year and senior year students give lessons to the other students on that day while teachers are free. Do you have something like that?<br>  Well, that was just one example- surely, you can find lots of things, just choose the topic you like and be original! |`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Sweetheart, this is the homework "HELP" section, not the homework "DO" section...perhaps you should write a speech about how today's kids like to cheat in school and are common enough to ask strangers to completely do their work for them!<br>  <br>  I bet your teacher would get a kick out of that!|`|sjAut2FKaa	Anyone can write a speech for you (anyone who is able to hold a writing tool or use a keyboard can do it !) but if the speech is only 2 minutes long and it can to be about anything why wouldn't you use your imagination. If you have to speak about something it would be much easier to speak about something you yourself have experienced. Examples 1) What you saw on the way to the park 2) What you did on your weekend off from school 3) The way you felt as you watched the sun rise in he morning OR What your favourite season of the year is and why. Just use your imagination and speak from your heart & you will find you words flow much more easily and before you know it you will have discovered a new and hidden talent. |`|OJ5cGvp8aa	Drop dead

s4Ocqaowaa	The answer is closest to "C." The plate is sliding over a 'hot spot' and this 'hot spot' is what creates the volcanoes. Thousands of years ago the hot spot was under Kauai and the volcanoes on that island were active (the other islands had not been formed yet). The tectonic plate continued to slide leaving the volcanoes on Kauai dormant and forming new islands. And so on and so forth until we get the chain of islands we have today.<br>  <br>  Currently the hot spot is partially under the island of Hawaii and is partially under the unformed island of Loihi. Which is why there are active volcanoes on the island of Hawaii (such as Mauna Loa and Kilauea) as well as the underwater volcano Loihi. In a few thousand years of activity Loihi will break the surface and add another island to the Hawaiian chain.|`|AbXDtdURaa	i took earth science this past summer school and after all the vigorus work i would have to say c...

QpoYpHFFaa	If you are feeling paranoid or a bit down, you may just be taking things too personally. It's easy to do if you're feeling a bit sensitive. Perhaps you have just grown out of these friends. I know it seems difficult now but you'll soon be leaving school and these friends really won't matter anymore. You'll look back and see them for what they are. The best advice I could give you is to go to a separate college (rather than staying on for sixth form at your school) as everyone is brand new and there are no preconceptions of who you are.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	so you have two different types of friends, horrible and those outside the classroom where it seems you are more accepted by being eccentric. if you feel it may be bullying see the form teacher about bullying and what they can do about it, join the group and discuss things, make these your friends.|`|O3CPESX1aa	 I really don't think people feel this way about you.

I work with children now and make a point of looking out for any bullying and sort it out. If you have a close relationship with your parents then you can work it out together.

Talk to your friends about it, if they're friends you can open up to. And if others don't like you the way you are, they're not the right people to be around. Maybe they resent you cos you don't behave like they do. It takes all sorts to make a world - just be yourself & ignore the nasty ones. Having just started a new school year probably doesn't help much either.

One thing I have learned is that to become successful in your study, you must love to study first then, you won't suffer much when you have to study hard(^^)|||. However, you might need some lucks too. Finally, dicipline yourself to review your lesson daily(if possible).

8YYwdccpaa	Even if your current record is not a great one, surely there are some general courses which could be transferred to another institution so that you do not have to take basic electives again? <br>  <br>  Or are you worried that your record is so poor that any school seeing it would refuse to accept you? If that is the case, then how will you explain what you have been doing for the past several years?<br>  <br>  Don't lie if that is the situation. If you are SURE that you are now more mature, more motivated, more focused, and that you are going to be able to succeed at a different school, then you need to find a way to explain and show that. This is not the best situation, but if you are determined to pretend the previous school experience didn't exist, you will have to figure out a way to address that time period. <br>  <br>  How are you sure that you will succeed this time? What is different? Unfortunately some students do poorly and then transfer because they think their problems will magically disappear and not follow them to the new school. They are usually wrong about that.<br>  <br>  If you do get accepted to another school, and then you want to see if any of the previous work might be accepted as transfer, I suppose you could get started at the new school and then talk with an advisor about the previous one and what to do. <br>  <br>  Don't lie though. It always catches up with you.|`|YpFNEskoaa	No! You can still go to a different college, regardless of your previous record. You're paying for your education. As long as you reach the acceptance requirements.

Saint George is one of the most venerated saints in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Immortalised in the tale of George and the Dragon, he is the patron saint of Canada, Catalonia, England, Ethiopia, Georgia, Greece, Montenegro, Portugal, Serbia, the cities of Beirut, Istanbul, Ljubljana and Moscow, as well as a wide range of professions, organisations and disease sufferers.<br>  Life<br>  There are no historical sources on Saint George. The legend that follows is synthesized from early and late hagiographical sources, such as the Golden Legend, which is the most familiar version in English, since William Caxton's first translation.<br>  <br>  George was born to a Christian family during the late 3rd century. His father was from Cappadocia and served as an officer of the Roman army. His mother was from Lydda, Iudaea (now Lod, Israel). She returned to her native city as a widow along with her young son, where she provided him with an education.<br>  <br>  The youth followed his father's example by joining the army soon after coming of age. He proved to be a good soldier and consequently rose through the military ranks of the time. By his late twenties he had gained the title of Tribunus (Tribune) and then Comes (Count), at which time George was stationed in Nicomedia as a member of the personal guard attached to Roman Emperor Diocletian.<br>  <br>  According to the hagiography, in 303 Diocletian issued an edict authorizing the systematic persecution of Christians across the Empire. The emperor Galerius was supposedly responsible for this decision and would continue the persecution during his own reign (305–311). George was ordered to take part in the persecution but instead confessed to being a Christian himself and criticized the imperial decision. An enraged Diocletian ordered the torture of this apparent traitor, and his execution.<br>  <br>  After various tortures, beginning with being lacerated on a wheel of swords, George was executed by decapitation before Nicomedia's defensive wall on April 23, 303. The witness of his suffering convinced Empress Alexandra and Athanasius, a pagan priest, to become Christians as well, and so they joined George in martyrdom. His body was returned to Lydda for burial, where Christians soon came to honour him as a martyr.<br>  Veneration as a martyr<br>  <br>  A church built in Lydda during the reign of Constantine I (reigned 306–337), was consecrated to "a man of the highest distinction", according to the church history of Eusebius of Caesarea; the name of the patron was not disclosed, but later he was asserted to have been George. The church was destroyed in 1010 but was later rebuilt and dedicated to Saint George by the Crusaders. In 1191 and during the conflict known as the Third Crusade (1189–1192), the church was again destroyed by the forces of Saladin, Sultan of the Ayyubid dynasty (reigned 1171–1193). A new church was erected in 1872 and is still standing.<br>  <br>  During the fourth century the veneration of George spread from Palestine to the rest of the Eastern Roman Empire, though the martyr is not mentioned in the Syriac Breviarium and Georgia. In Georgia the feast day on November 23 is credited to St Nino of Cappadocia, who in Georgian hagiography is a relative of St George, credited with bringing Christianity to the Georgians in the fourth century. By the fifth century the cult of Saint George had reached the Western Roman Empire as well: in 494, George was canonised as a saint by Pope Gelasius I, among those "whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God." According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the earliest text preserving fragments of George's narrative is in an Acta Sanctorum identified by Hippolyte Delehaye of the scholarly Bollandists to be a palimpsest of the fifth century. The compiler of this Acta, according to Delehaye "confused the martyr with his namesake, the celebrated George of Cappadocia, the Arian intruder into the see of Alexandria and enemy of St. Athanasius".<br>  Hymn of Saint George<br>  A commonly sung troparion in the Eastern Orthodox Church is the Hymn of St. George:<br>  <br>  "Liberator of captives,<br>  and defender of the poor,<br>  physician of the sick,<br>  and champion of kings,<br>  O trophy-bearer,<br>  and Great Martyr George,<br>  intercede with<br>  Christ our God that<br>  our souls be saved."<br>  Sources<br>  A critical edition of the Syriac Acta of Saint George, accompanied by an annoted English translation was published by E.W. Brooks (1863-1955) in 1925. The hagiography was originally written in Greek.<br>  George and the Dragon<br>  <br>  The episode of St George and the Dragon was Eastern in origin, brought back with the Crusaders and retold with the courtly appurtenances belonging to the genre of Romance (Loomis; Whatley). The earliest known depiction of the mytheme is from early eleventh-century Cappadocia (Whately), (in the iconography of the Eastern Orthodox Church, George had been depicted as a soldier since at least the seventh century); the earliest known surviving narrative text is an eleventh-century Georgian text (Whatley).<br>  <br>  In the fully-developed Western version, a dragon makes its nest at the spring that provides water for the city of Cyrene in Libya or the city of Lydda, depending on the source. Consequently, the citizens have to dislodge the dragon from its nest for a time, in order to collect water. To do so, each day they offer the dragon a human sacrifice. The victim is chosen by drawing lots. One day, this happened to be the princess. The monarch begs for her life with no result. She is offered to the dragon, but there appears the saint on his travels. He faces the dragon, slays it and rescues the princess. The grateful citizens abandon their ancestral paganism and convert to Christianity.<br>  <br>  The dragon motif was first combined with the standardized Passio Georgii in Vincent of Beauvais' encyclopedic Speculum historale and then in Jacobus de Voragine, Golden Legend, which guaranteed its popularity in the later Middle Ages as a literary and pictorial subject (Whatly).<br>  <br>  The parallels with Perseus and Andromeda are inescapable. In the allegorical reading, the dragon embodies a suppressed pagan cult. The story has roots that predate Christianity. Examples such as Sabazios, the sky father, who was usually depicted riding on horseback, and Zeus's defeat of Typhon the Titan in Greek mythology, along with examples from Germanic and Vedic traditions, have led a number of historians, such as Loomis, to suggest that George is a Christianized version of older deities in Indo-European culture.<br>  <br>  In the medieval romances, the lance with which St George slew the dragon was called Ascalon, named after the city of Ashkelon in Israel.<br>  <br>  In Sweden, the princess rescued by Saint George is held to represent the kingdom of Sweden, while the dragon represents an invading army. Several sculptures of Saint George battling the dragon can be found in Stockholm, the earliest inside Storkyrkan ("The Great Church") in the Old Town.<br>  <br>  The fa?ade of architect Antoni Gaudi's famous Casa Batlló in Barcelona, Spain depicts this allegory.<br>  Iconography<br>  St. George is most commonly depicted in early icons, mosaics and frescos wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a Roman soldier. After the Fall of Constantinople and the association of St George with the crusades, he is more often portrayed mounted upon a white horse. At the same time St George began to be associated with St. Demetrius, another early soldier saint. When the two saints are portrayed together mounted upon horses, they may be likened to earthly manifestations of the archangels Michael and Gabriel. St George is always depicted in Eastern traditions upon a white horse and St. Demetrius on a red horse St George can also be identified in the act of spearing a dragon, unlike St Demetrius, who is sometimes shown spearing a human figure, understood to represent Maximian.<br>  Later depictions and occurrences<br>  <br>  During the early 2nd millennium, George came to be seen as the model of chivalry, and during this time was depicted in works of literature, such as the medieval romances.<br>  <br>  Jacobus de Voragine, Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the Legenda Sanctorum, (Readings of the Saints) also known as Legenda Aurea (the Golden Legend) for its worth among readers. Its 177 chapters (182 in other editions) contain the story of Saint George.|`|AA12269925	sure how bout the lock nes moster (sorry if i mess these up) look them up or you can try Nessie its the same thin but easier to spell.

One is called La Llorona, it's about a woman who was crazy, and she drowns her kids in a river; when she realizes what she has done, she starts looking all over for them, screaming and crying "Ay, mis hijos" or "Oh! my kids" (this is why she is called Llorona or crying woman), so she is damned to look for them forever. People say that you can hear her screaming at nights, if the scream sounds as if she is far it's because she is really near, and if it sounds close, she is far away. Kids are scared, because the legend says that she will take away any kid, thinking it's hers.

Originally the dye was applied by importers to hide stains on the shells caused when the nuts were picked by hand. However most pistachios are now picked by machine and the shells remain unstained, making dyeing unnecessary (except that some consumers have been led to expect coloured pistachios).

They're cheap and some are really good (McGill, UToronto, UBC), but more importly for your sanity, there's no essay or recomendation required. The whole thing takes about 15 minutes, and you can do it as late as spring. <br>  3- maine is cold, sure, but spring and fall are BEAUTIFUL, and you can always curl up under a blanket with hot chocolate.<br>  4- don't overload on extra curriculars just for your applications. I didn't do any at all, and still got into Columbia and UC Berkeley.<br>  5- let your parents do the worrying for you<br>  6- live and don't let school stop you from having a real life. it will try....

jgP51MlRaa	Social Marketing was officially born as phenomena in 1971 with an article in the “Journal of Marketing” by Kotler and Zaltman, where they discussed the use of commercial marketing methods for social issues. It was and still is a widely debated and discussed phenomena. <br>  <br>  There are important similarities between Commercial Marketing and Social Marketing such as customer orientation, exchange theory, marketing research, segmentation, the use of the marketing mix and the focus on monitoring and evaluation but also substantial differences when it comes to the product, the gain/profit, the behavioral change and the type of competitive environment. The main components of Social Marketing are marketing research, segmentation, product, price, place, promotion, monitoring and evaluation. <br>  <br>  It has been defined as, the use of marketing principles and techniques to influence a target audience to voluntarily accept, modify, or abandon a behavior for the benefit of individuals, groups, or society as a whole. <br>  <br>  Social Marketing in a developing country context has been widely used to promote social changes in for example family planning, public health and HIV/AIDS. <br>  <br>  Maj

When they hung animals up on a wooden frame to slaughter them, the frame was called a bucket.  Obviously, the animals would kick and struggle, thus coming the phrase "kick the bucket".|`|5gV9lewGaa	A long long time ago, hanging was a way of punishing criminals and also committing suicide. Many times the condemned was made to stand on a bucket while the noose was placed around his neck. The bucket was then kicked out from under him, thusly killing him.

Then subtract the closest number you can get to from the number in the box, and then do the same thing with the divisor.<br>  <br>  Okay, this would be a lot easier to explain if you had an example.|`|3AZ4tRb5aa	HEY.<br>  Why not try putting a question on here before you post?<br>  idiot.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: im an idiot? at least i know how to divide ;)|`|AA10283238	I remember having math  anxiety when I was in the 6th grade, but looking back I realize it wasn't as bad as I imagined it to be. <br>  <br>  When it comes to long division you must be very confident with knowing your multiplications.

A specific area of study that will define that classes you take for the next four hears.  Your classes aren't defined by number of years but by something called credit hours.  A course that is one credit hour means that you're in class for 1 hour a week.  Most classes are 3 credit hours so you're in class for three hours a week.  This does get a little fuzzy when you get to things like labs which are typically only one hour even though you're in class for 3.  <br>  Your required classes are determined based on your major, but most majors will require about 2 english/writing classes, a public speaking class, some kind of introductory science class, a math class, a few social sciences.  <br>  As far as a "career job education" that doesn't really exist unless you're attending a vocational school or a professional school.  You'll most likely get a degree in four years and depending on your major go on after that to get a job where they will train you in day to day work and hopefully you'll use your knowledge gained while getting your degree.  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|a7f0a207efd4bfde7a89a1744872689baa	college is a really expensive four year experience of higher learning. its nothing like HS|`|6CgHu1SOaa	College is totally different. All colleges are different also. There are requirements for liberal arts colleges. Classes will get those out of that way, sometimes taking two or more out with one class. It also depends on how you come into college, whether you test out of classes or get ahead. Some colleges you can go right into what you want to do, it all depends.

AA11283315	 <br>  <br>  The girl's name Tara \t(a)-ra\ is pronounced TAH-rah. It is of Gaelic and Sanskrit origin, and its meaning is "hill; star". Ancient Tara was the site of the "stone of destiny" on which Irish kings resided, and Margaret Mitchell probably had this in mind when she named the fictional home of Scarlett O'Hara in her 1936 novel "Gone With the Wind".

Young Hector was a culinary savant who reportedly worked in restaurant kitchens at the tender age of eleven before immigrating to America and joining his brother in New York at age seventeen. His brother's employment as a waiter at the prestigious Plaza Hotel helped gain young Hector entrée to the Plaza's kitchen, and over the next several years Boiardi whipped up his creations for renowned hotel kitchens New York, West Virginia, and finally Cleveland, where he opened his own restaurant, Il Giardino d’Italia. <br>  <br>  Boiardi's spaghetti sauce soon became famous throughout Cleveland, and his restaurant patrons began asking him for extra portions of sauce to take home with them, which he doled out in milk bottles. Demand for his spaghetti sauce grew so large that he started producing it in an adjacent loft and selling it with dry pasta and packets of his special cheese. Hector Boiardi later plunged into full-time pasta making, adopted the (for Americans) easier-to-spell "Boyardee" version of his name, and moved his operations to Pennsylvania before eventually merging with American Home Foods (now International Home Foods), with whom he worked until his death in 1985.

It's your back-up because you can have a bad day and mess up a test. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it's impossible to keep a 4.0, don't beat yourself up if you slip up sometimes, but do your best. <br>  <br>  If you want the 4.0 for college, remember, you can also do more in another category -- like more community service -- if you don't quite get a 4.0.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11732565	Do what Barack Obama did: get up at 4:30 am every day and study,study and the study some more.<br>  Geez, I'm tired just thinking about it never mind doing it!|`|AA11149656	Well first of all cut off any distractions, such as your phone, ipod, tvs, and computers. If you think that's too boring, look for good people or good friends of yours to do group studies.<br>  <br>  Study at the library, you're not alone, it's quiet, and it has a comforting atmosphere.<br>  <br>  While you're studying, write down or take notes on what you're studying. Whatever you write down, you'll remember. Even if what you're studying are notes or small little vocab words, write them down - at least 10 times. You'll remember it for a long period of time.<br>  <br>  While you're doing your homework, don't do your homework just to be done with it. Do it, make sure you understand it. That way, when a math test or something comes up, you don't have to study too hard because you already understood what you did in your homework.<br>  <br>  Teachers don't bite. So if you don't understand something, ask them. It's there job. If they don't explain it to you, then you can just tell another teacher or just ask a friend who knows the concept. <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to ask your friends, your family, and so on. Don't be afraid to make yourself look like a fool. When you're asking things - you're helping yourself. It's either have a ruined image that lasts for a day or so - OR - getting a 4.0 GPA<br>  <br>  Good luck~|`|zgT2rB0zaa	All you have to do is have the willpower and the only way you aren't going to procrastinate is if you just do your homework and studying right when you get home and it sounds dumb but it's true, you can't do anything else before hand because it will never get done. Also, try sitting in the front it really makes you pay better attention.|`|NkG2Yk4kaa	get good grades. (GGG)|`|AgDE5RvOaa	     You have to study a lot and review the things that you learn a lot of times so you can get an A+ since a 4.0 GPA is straight A's. Stop procrastinating by seeing the consequences of what will happen if you get bad grades by procrastinating (e.g. living in a cardboard box in an alley where you eat rats every 3 days since you can't get a job because you procrastinated and got bad grades and everybody now thinks your stupid). <br>       Also, every time you do a good job, like when you get an A+ for a test or homework piece then reward yourself with a treat. If there's even a slight chance of extra credit then try it, you never know if you will get it or not and the extra points will help your GPA.|`|FH0nwdptaa	develop dicipline.  Figure out what distracts you or what are your favorite distractions and avoid them like the plague.  <br>  <br>  Tackle your toughest study subjects first, spend more time with them.<br>  If you leave it last, you'll be tired, which is the opposite of what you want to be when you tackle these.<br>  <br>  Reward yourself (icecream, whatever) whenever you complete projects or the milestones you set for yourself.  <br>  <br>  You should take your study books wherever you go, always be reading.  More studying means less cramming.<br>  <br>  Join or form study groups (with people as serious as you about grades)  for the sole purpose of quizing eachother before tests.  Regular study should be solitary (because it's reading), unless you are geting help on subjects you don't understand.<br>  <br>  Go to bed early, wake up early.  Always be fresh when you study.  It's pointless to study late at night when you are tired.|`|G0plFlAuaa	Make sure you do work well before the due date. Believe it or not I am actually doing an essay that is due in less than 48 hours! I know I should have done it earlier, and I will regret it later. The best thing you can do for yourself is give yourself a deadline and some time. Hang around people within your classes that want to study, like have study sessions for example. They can help alot. Dont be scared of asking the teacher for help, it can really help you in the end.<br>  <br>  |`|xZxIJUELaa	think about the long term. Retiring early, owning property, more time with family, a great career, success, high education, etc. I know how you feel I'm a sophomore in college and it's like I have senioritis. But try to focus on the long run. Work now, play later. |`|LkWwftf3aa	I am the same way. it is all about time management. You want a four point Oh? How bad do you want it. If you want it that bad, the mean little word called procrastination will be able to be pushed to the curb. DON'T PROCRASTINATE!!! And then study, have no missing assignments, and make sure you are asking questions in class if you are confused or don't understand it. <br>  GOOD LUCK! :))|`|j0SGlTUJaa	this is wat u need to do get a buddy study each otha til the day comes and while u at it get some rest but like study a part everyday and chill so u can get sum rest|`|wb71ZQbraa	study hard every day.<br>  for example, decide to commit to devote 5 hours a day to studying.<br>  <br>  there is no other way.|`|KQrelhJwaa	hard work. proper concentration..|`|ytdhoE24aa	stop procrastinating. |`|Kl05Mcauaa	Well getting off Y!A and studying non stop will help.
JQX9E0vraa	At the going down of the sun...<br>  <br>  <br>  I crouched in a shallow trench on that hell of exposed beaches... steeply rising foothills bare of cover... a landscape pockmarked with war’s inevitable litter... piles of stores... equipment... ammunition... and the weird contortions of death sculptured in Australian flesh... I saw the going down of the sun on that first ANZAC Day... the chaotic maelstrom of Australia’s blooding.<br>  <br>  I fought in the frozen mud of the Somme... in a blazing destroyer exploding on the North Sea... I fought on the perimeter at Tobruk... crashed in the flaming wreckage of a fighter in New Guinea... lived with the damned in the place cursed with the name Changi.<br>  <br>  I was your mate... the kid across the street... the med. student at graduation... the mechanic in the corner garage... the baker who brought you bread... the gardener who cut your lawn... the clerk who sent your phone bill.<br>  <br>  I was an Army private... a Naval commander... an Air Force bombardier.  no man knows me... no name marks my tomb, for I am every Australian serviceman... I am the Unknown Soldier.<br>  <br>  I died for a cause I held just in the service of my land... that you and yours may say in freedom... I am proud to be an Australian.<br>   <br>  <br>  This message, a poignant tribute to the Australian serviceman, hangs in the offices of the Queensland State Headquarters of the RSL<br>
