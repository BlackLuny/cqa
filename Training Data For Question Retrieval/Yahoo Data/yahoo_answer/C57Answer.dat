teKeLxX2aa	Well, the military is definitely your best option for pursuing a career in law enforcement. You can go in the military and become a military police officer, then return to the civilian world and it should go a long ways towards becoming a civilian cop (especially when taking into consideration that a lot of cops are former military and they typically take care of their own).    I would suggest that you inquire at least 2 recruiters from 2 different branches to weigh the pros and cons of each one. I was going to pursue a civilian career in law enforcement after I enlisted, but ended up changing my mind after I became a military cop and came back to the civilian world. If you have any questions, send me your email and I'll give you some constructive advice.    Joining the military will give you hands-on experience that you're potential employers will not be able to overlook or ignore, and it'll also help you pay off your college loans and make college more affordable.|`|StxCHnTkaa	There are great benefits in the military...but there's a lot of BS too. If you want to join specifically for education benefits, I would go Reserves. You don't get the full GI Bill but the education benefits are still excellent. MPs in the Army enlist for 5yrs...in 3 you could be ready for the academy. I chose MP over a civilian PD and kicked myself. The pay is not so good in the military and the hours can be LONG. When I was in Korea,  we worked so much that it was like .75/hr and days off are not guaranteed. If you find out that you love the military, you can always sign active later without additional training. The military can be good and bad...make sure you know what you're getting into before you make your final choice.
Ar00Kkgkaa	It's likely Britain.|`|v0ZvjE0Iaa	Certainly Britain. And of course Israel. Canada and Australia have also been putting up a good fight with us in Afghanistan.    Apparently, I can't pick just one haha|`|zLUQJxJkaa	One who values one ally over another isn't wise unless that ally has done something to dissolve your trust, in which case he should not be your ally.  Britain, Canada, Australia, Israel.. we got a lot of cool buddies.|`|tpfxZZADaa	America actually doesn't do a lot more for any one of its Allies than any other.  Britain comes to a lot of peoples minds, because almost any conflict America is in Britain seems to be always there too.     France and Germany get a lot from America, like West German bases and hospitals, a lot of capital and infrastructure after World War 2 etc. France also got America into the Vietnam War, if you think about it.    Today though, I would have to say America stands alone a lot more than not. Israel may feel supported, but how long will that last, and what actual support has America given?    It would be easier to measure who America was most against, and that would be a very short list including Russia, China, North Korea, India, Pakistan, and Iran. But even with those nations China, Russia, India and Pakistan all are Partners of America in one way or another.|`|rxMHRbTzaa	Intresting question. I would say that until we end our dependance on foreign oil, it is Saudi Arabia.|`|6iIxJD8Uaa	The UK and Isreal always both have great militaries|`|22tPNksKaa	Probably Britain. We only sided w/ them over Germany in WW1 because more of us spoke English.    As to is the most useful? Maybe Germany or Japan. If we listened to Germany's advice, we wouldn't be stuck in Iraq. They were TRYING to HELP us. We not only ignored them, we ridiculed them. But they still stood by us & helped in Afghanistan & the Balkans. Plus the Abrams kicks A S S cause it has a German Kanone    We need to give them a BIG hug & say, "That'll do Komrad, That'll do"    (Sorry! I stole that quote from "Babe", but I love it!)|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	i would have to say england is our best
AVc1PCu5aa	73.05 screw ups.|`|e3620b9a08ac5adee34c4f8e35f62a75aa	You are right.  It is refreshing to have a leader that will admit when he has made a mistake, rather than fight all the way to the Supreme Court to keep the entire workings of his administration secret.
NPAQxqgNaa	The "stimulus" package they're debating now will not help.   In fact we'd be better off doing nothing since it will probably increase inflation within the next 2 years if passed.  I wish it were something helpful, but the majority of the money doesn't go to creating jobs or helping the housing market.  It's all pork projects and grants...most of them to groups that donated big to Obama's campaign.  Sadly, I thought he'd do better than this.|`|u23sBafTaa	Even the democrats are starting to smell the stench of the pork package !|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	yes their is a debate because of all the garbage that was attached to the package|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	No it will not.   The money needs to come from somewhere.  Like taxpayers.  Also it all has Obamas little programs worked in there.  People are to lazy and get there info from CNN NBC and such and can't research it for them selves.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	Yeah, it's mindboggling isn't it?  Considering it won't.|`|ZvfUQ4Ifaa	yes, there is a debate about weather it will work|`|AaVfzRamaa	No it won't work. It is an abomination for those fool to want to spend money this country don't have and can't pay back. It is crazy that my great grand kids will have to grow up facing 90% taxes. it is a sin.|`|vE0ZzBVwaa	yes there is a huge debate, on the one hand, the democrats think that by pumping money into the economy and saving many large companies will help prevent the problem from getting any worse. however the republicans think that the market should be more capitalist, and these companies should be allowed to fail, this will prevent the same mistakes from happening again.     basicly the democrats want to jump start the ecnomy in the hopes that spending money now will solve the problem or at least prevent it from getting worse, while republicans think the market will solve itself and be better because it was able to come out on top|`|c353de654d51fd85a622ff807bf097f0aa	The "debate" is nothing more than a bunch of old tired minds who are completely out of touch with the many Americans out of work and are losing their homes. The "debate" is a poor attempt to get President Obama to jump through hoops.The Republicans are still sore because Obama and many democrats won. Obviously their stalling is indicative of how deeply they care about helping people.
caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	Sure we should.

I got no problem with it.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Nope.    Can you imagine drug addicts and alcoholics selling their kidneys for profit?    Hell, they'd probably try to give them both up.    And besides, organ trafficking is dangerous.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	Is there a point to this question?|`|mdHqr17kaa	I think a physician following the Hippocratic Oath should refuse to do this, but such physicians are less prevalent these days.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Yes, we should have that right.  If there's one thing that every human should have the right to it is their own body.  This is the ONE thing in this world that is completely mine.  I should have the right to do anything that I want with it as long as I don't infringe on the rights of others.|`|D8I3Brngaa	yes you should.  in case you havn't noticed, the government loves to tell people what to do, and there are plenty of americans that like it that way too.|`|Asb3yT3xaa	they already tell you that you can't rent it out for sex. If youcannot rent it then you certainly can't sell it. Maybe once you're not using it. (we use both kidneys if they function well).   Personally I see nothing wrong with selling your own body parts but I'm apparently in the minority on this one.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	People donate healthy kidneys to others. Why not?

Then we might see some real tax reform come from Washington.
vZwQjeBFaa	find a job first. than consider moving out|`|bb06GQ5Paa	The age of majority, meaning the age you are considered an adult, is 18.  Legal age for emancipation is 17 in this great state so you can pack your stuff and leave now. Sounds like it's a long time coming anyway.  Good luck!    PS - Why don't you call CPS if things are so bad?  That way, it will be on record, you know?
DyEIc0K8aa	Yes they can, yes they will and yes they do.. but you already really know that don't you?|`|BJERgbM5aa	Yes, Yes, and yes again.  Why?  Because you're only 17 and not of legal age to dispute the matters that you mention.  You can get copies of every paper you signed until you are blue in the face, it will not do you any good and these copies will not hold up as evidence in any court of law.  Why.  Because you are a minor and are not subject to legitimate contracts.  Is that bad?  No.  Because if the school asks you to sign papers, do you know what they can do with the signed paper.  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  So you see, being 17 and in school is not such a bad gig after all.  Just let them play their game.  Better for you in the long run.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Yes, they can pretty much do all of those things.  With a few exceptions, they can do basically whatever your parents can do.|`|AA10123414	Like can they take personal property (cell phones, hats, etc)? - If you bring items to school that are prohibited, they can be confiscated. You don't need those items at school.    Can they tell students what they can and cannot wear? - Yes    Can they hold students behind after school is let out? - Yes.    Might as well get used to it, employers can do the same things.|`|AA12146958	Schools set the rules and you follow them.  Your parents probably signed contracts when they enrolled you. Being 17 is not a way out of  not following the schools rules.|`|RvddYKqjaa	You can be held responsible for a school contract. Our 12-year old, and everyone in the school sign a community ethics contract, and it says clearly that cell phones WILL be confiscated. (Parents sign the contract too!)   The contract says they may not wear hats in school, and yes, they can be taken away.   They have signed they will not bring any gaming devices to school. They have a dress code, but there's nothing rigid about it. Mostly it says you come to school with your body fully clothed. Kids have been kept after school since time began, and yes they can do that.   I'm sorry, but you are going to school with taxpayer money. Your teachers can't teach when they have to be dealing with cellphones and hats and all the other stuff kids are doing in the classrooms today. We all pay for you to get a good education, and yes, the school officials can handle it their way. No power trips there. They are maintaining order so that kids who are there to learn, can do so. A parent is responsible for seeing that a child's phone is at home. And parents team together to reinforce the rules.   Oh, and there are language specifications too. There is no profanity allowed. Kids who engage in that kind of talk are disciplined. This is not a private school. It's a county public school. More and more school adminstrations are taking back their classrooms. If a person wants to learn and plays by the rules, they are welcome to be educated. Schools are out of hand. Kids are getting killed walking into school lavatories. Someone has to take control.|`|qMDeWwKvaa	I wish I knew the specific laws for California, but I know in my school if you're even in the parking lot with your cell phone out we have a security guard take it up. You have to pay $15 to get it back. They can tell you what you can and cannot wear to a degree. Hats are not allowed here and neither are holes in any kinds of pants, even if there are leggings underneath them.
KZh3x4g9aa	ask obama,he knows......|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Obama knows how to get a US birth certificate----- even when you are born in Kenya.|`|Rzs7rrbEaa	Go to Kinko's and make one up.. like Obama did.|`|d9f297647631bbfef114d9c411c59106aa	I sent a letter to the county clerk and the required fee and got mine.

rxMHRbTzaa	Most Infantryman carry the good old M16A2 rifle or the shorter version the M4 Carbine. Each fire team also has a M249 squad automatic weapon (saw) and a M203 40mm grenade launcher. As a basic Infantryman you may be carrying any of those.    Some Infantryman are in Heavy weapons companies that use M240 machine guns, M2 50 cal Machine guns, and MK19 automatic grenade launchers. Then there are the mortars. Mortars are a completly different job in the Infantry.    Snipers are part of the Infantry but it is more of an advanced Infantry position for guys that have some experience already.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	Tons of weapons haha, m16a4, SAW, the list keeps going on and on..  Snipers are nuts, not sure how long the school is, but they are definitely called special operations guys. Read up on them, sniper isn't an easy position, in many ways.   Snipers learn (amongst a million other things):  woodcraft, weather, camo, stalking, shooting in different conditions, they learn about how weather, wind, light, everything affects the bullet, they learn many different tactics in order to know what the enemy will do, they learn radio stuff, ranges, it just keeps going.  A sniper I know did Marine Recon, Ranger School, Pathfinder, SCUBA, and a whole load of other schools.  A Green Beret I met said that snipers are the most elite guys out there.|`|7NfcM63waa	thats a good Question that i always wanted to know.|`|6iIxJD8Uaa	Saw gunner M240B also m-4 m16A2  M203  No to be a snper u most Quailfy for scout sniper school. oh and m9 pistol
18uFvmFDaa	The Twenty-seventh Amendment provides that any change in Congressional salaries may only take effect after the beginning of the next term of office for Representatives. Sometimes called the "Congressional Compensation Amendment of 1789", the "Congressional Pay Amendment", and the "Madison Amendment", it was intended to serve as a restraint on the power of Congress to set its own salaryan obvious potential for conflict of interest.    This amendment was actually suggested by a number of states. During the 1788 North Carolina convention, assembled to consider the original Constitution itself, the following amendment, among others, was requested of Congress:|`|b735faf88c8067dd9eef77d013b140b0aa	the last one

He's still better than bush or mcsame.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	No second thoughts here.|`|9w9UHyCNaa	Of course he isn't in charge. No one in Washington is "in charge"    It has only been 15 days since he was inaugurated as president. What is there to judge about him?|`|E9XL5x3Paa	And you must be joking.    Obama is the first President I've seen in a long time, and first politician for that matter, that is actually trying to keep his promises.    He's already begun work on moving soldiers out of that distraction that you call the War in Iraq, and putting them back into the fight against terrorism.  He's actually paying attention to the economy, with a plan that can actually work if Republicans would do their part and do what Obama expected of them, which is to act like Conservatives.    Notice how when Republicans want to cut parts out of the plan, Obama does so and quite quickly.  But when they try to ADD to the pork spending with some of their own, Obama steps into the way.  Anyone paying attention could see that Obama does not actually want to spend like that, that he was trying to get Republican supporters behind Republicans when they cut out the spending.  Then all Congressmen and Senators, Republican and Democrat, would vote for a bill that had been pared of all excess spending, and that would bring all Americans together.    Because we would see Democrats see the situation needs urgent action, we would see Republicans are trying to be fiscally responsible again after their spending spree of the past 8 years, and that both groups knew how to work together when it mattered.  That yes, they play games with each other, but they know when the situation is serious and that they need to work together.    But Republicans are continuing their foolishness of the past 8 years, and trying to ADD pork spending instead of taking out pork spending.  Then they throw a temper tantrum when Obama won't let them add spending.  They need to grow up and act like real Conservatives, and get this plan passed WITHOUT pork spending, not Republican pork spending in place of Democrat pork spending.          Obama is taking the lead and is doing extremely well.  I wish I could say the same for Nancy Pelosi or the Republicans.  They'd rather hurt themselves to hurt each other, rather than working with Obama so that ALL look good when they get back to how they are supposed to be working.  And that means Democrats standing up for us, and Republicans standing up for fiscal restraint.  NOT TEMPER TANTRUMS.|`|V4BaRBtnaa	absolutely not.    In fact, Obama is showing how much wiser he is than the republicans.    The republicans, in fact, are doing what Obama wants them to do.

Worse yet, where's our brain dead Congress who doled out the money without strict guide lines on how it is to be used !|`|XPSIn3wxaa	Talk is cheap.     A politician can say anything to get elected.     The only way anyone really knows what a person will do is from their actions. Since Obama did nothing, nothing and then vote present and still did nothing, that is all I expected from him. So far he is proving me correct.     That is why I am glad the people who voted for him are getting exactly what they ask for. Maybe they will wise up and not vote for a do-nothing the next time.    However I have my serious doubts, morons are easily lead to destruction.    If it talks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, maybe it is a duck  Oh no, its Obama, the messiah.|`|Y7WgMgBxaa	His only mistake is not cleaning out the "bad apples". He is hopelessly surrounded by corruption. If the President remains clean (?), he will surely be swallowed up in a maze of political bickering, never to resolve anything. If he gives in, then it's politics as usual. Either way, we lose. When a company in trouble is put under new management normally they replace the problem employees. If you don't make changes, at the top, nothing changes. Lay-off everyone, still nothing changes. It must start at the top. It is looking more and more like there is still no backbone in the white house.|`|RZDvXJceaa	Of course not. They voted for him because they were uninformed, and they are not paying attention now.
6aa3462db415d437fbd6038465117c79aa	Simply putting people to work, without a profit incentive, does nothing but forestall economic doom's day.  If Honey Bees ran low on nectar, can you imagine their queen ordering the worker Bees to start pruning the leaves, and pulling weeds in order to immediately get more honey for the hive ?  We must keep money in the hands of those who will create products that the public wants and needs, like electric cars, mass transit,bio-fuels, solar panels, electric lines, towers,and wind turbines. We also need to finance existing projects that will transport electric, and wind power from space platforms attached by nanotube cables.

Most people aren't even able to justify or thoroughly explain their rationale behind calling someone something, but they'll pass the word on for the thrill and because it makes them feel good (like girls do when they discover someone they know is pregnant, or guys when they want to spread a rumor that someone they don't like is gay.)    The funny thing is, most people don't even know what a socialist is, and few are politically literate enough to be capable of explaining socialism. But calling someone a socialist in America is usually perceived to be derogatory (like Communist was during the Cold War). By the very nature of its use in recent times, its just been another bad name for Republicans and their sympathizers to call Obama and the democrats (as you have probably noticed, neither Obama or democratic sympathizers have been calling themselves socialist).|`|RZDvXJceaa	By stripping away his flowery rhetoric and comparing his policies to those of socialistic Western European nations like France, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and to some extent Germany and the UK.

VKrePQZqaa	Cause people try to make it their own or add their own flavor to it. In most cases I think they ruin it for themselves and for the audience. Singers go to great lengths to make their own mark on it. Unfortunately, I think it takes a lot away from it. Its a Anthem for Americans and not for specific people or groups or singers.  For instance Jennifer Hudson had skills for the Super Bowl but she completely ruined it and it didn't sound like our National Anthem. There is only one National Anthem, but now a days it is more about reputation and status, more then it is about Patriotism.

They have F-16s and skilled pilots to fly them.|`|AA11485984	Actually Israeli citizens should built home-made rockets that will not fly  more than 100 feet.

She should never have been within 200 miles of the Senate. Why is her crooked butt still there?. Check her her and her Hubby out.      Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi 's home district includes   San Francisco.         Star-Kist Tuna's headquarters are in San Francisco, Pelosi's home  district.         Star-Kist is owned by Del Monte Foods and is a major contributor to  Pelosi.         Star-Kist is the major employer in American Samoa employing 75% of  the Samoan work force.         Paul Pelosi, Nancy's husband, owns $17 million dollars of Star-Kist  stock.         In January, 2007 when the minimum wage was increased from $5.15 to  $7.25, Pelosi had American Samoa exempted from the increase so Del Monte  would not have to pay the higher wage. This would make Del Monte  products less expensive than their competition's.

Saltines are a variety of "cracker"|`|AA11369432	No,  so does  many others.  It's a tasty food. Look at it like that.|`|YUjVFkocaa	No... the term "cracker" was made up originally for crackers, as in the crunchy bread that tastes good and comes in rectangles..... the term cracker was NOT originally a racist slang term for "white guy".    This is coming from a white wrestler, by the way... you don't get much whiter than that... this answer is just the truth.    This is the same reason why "chocolate" isn't racist, and "mud" isn't racist.      ===========    However, both "cracker" and the 2 examples I gave ARE racist IF THEY ARE USED IN A RACIST CONNOTATION.  Simply using the words in a regular connotation is not.  ============    You are probably thinking, "well, does that mean I can say sp*ck, n*gger, or wh*tey?"  The answer is NO MEANS NO... haha.    This is because those terms DON'T have any other meaning, and they were originally made as racist terms only.  So therefore, saying them at all is racist.  There ISN'T any other connotation for them.  ======================    However, this argument can delve even further, into the roots of our constitution:    TECHNICALLY, you are legally allowed to say any racist term you want.  Any of the above I mentioned, go*ok, be*aner, h*ymie, etc.  Any of them are LEGALLY allowed to be said... because of our 1st amendment right to free speech.    At first glance, this makes me hate free speech.  But on second glance, I am glad free speech allows everything, for this simple reason:  Those who ARE racist may not be PUNISHED... but they can still be shunned, hated, disrespected back, etc.  most people won't be friends with them, and they might even get beaten up.    On the other hand, free speech is good in so many different ways, because it allows us to speak up to tyranny, a bad government, higher taxes, stupid officials, too high prices for gas or movie tickets, allowing us to tell our boss to f*ck off (although this isn't advised), etc. etc.    Free speech is what KEEPS us FREE!  We as americans would be living under a crappy, tyrannical government right now, with stupid officials like Blagojevich running amok, if it weren't for our ability to speak out against what's wrong, and speak up for what's right, in our society, and in us as individuals!|`|0pPT2HqKaa	just as racist when people mispronounce Niger.

ZzXxRLWcaa	1) Probably not.. the academy is more then full time, very time consuming and tiring. Yes, you do get a stipend in most police academies... though it's not much.    2) If you can do all that, then no problem. That's actually more then most of the physical requirements they have.    3) Absolutely acceptable, you can even be an officer (I mean ranking officer. Sgt, Lt, Cpt, etc...) with that degree!    4) Yeah you should. Forensics, criminology, criminal justice are always a good idea, sometimes even required in some states.    5) 3.6 GPA is excellent, deans list man... no problem. Your ok with a 2.0 or better anyways.    6) Sure... if you can fit it into your schedule, but that shouldnt be a problem as police shifts are usually four 10 hour days. Some cops get on the job first THEN get their degree.. if they can do it, so can you.    You sound like a perfect candidate amigo, go for it!|`|57bfd607400fd9aee46ddbc6f83a201caa	It depends on the department and the academy. Here where I live, the academy cost around $4000 if you pay for it yourself. The best thing to do is to get hired by a PD, because here, they pay 100% of the academy, plus pay you officer salary for the time you spend in academy.   It is good that you are in shape, that will benefit you. Usually, most departments take applicants, choose a pool of officers who have the qualifications and clean records, then have them take a written test. Next, from there, they will be put through the physical test. You should have no problem passing that. Next you will have a background check, interviews, and a psych evaluation. If you check out and pass all of the before mentioned, they will "hire" you and send you to academy. Once you pass academy, you start at the PD with an FTO for 6 months. From there, you are a probationary officer for 1 year. After that 1 year, you are an officer.
U1pMvDvgaa	Did You Know?  * Guns are used 2.5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2.5 million times every year -- or about 6,850 times a day.1 This means that each year, firearms are used more than 60 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives.2   * Locking up firearms can cost lives during a life-threatening situation. In California last year, two children died -- they were pitchforked to death by a crazed drug addict -- because a resident in the home could not access the household firearms in time. The guns were locked up in deference to California state law.3   * Guns are the Great Equalizer for women. As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse.4   * Law-abiding gun owners are a good form of crime control. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606).5|`|B8j7pA6baa	Bingo, here's a goldmine  http://urbandreams.ousd.k12.ca.us/lesson...|`|0P9GYAx6aa	Proponents of gun control argue that gun laws are necessary to curb the ease with which criminals, youth, and persons who are judged to be a danger to themselves or others can gain access to firearms. They cite the yearly number of accidental shootings in households with guns as evidence that tougher laws are needed. They call for limits on the types of weapons civilians can own and for stricter weapons registration and training requirements. They also decry the mounting number of school shootings, including the April 2007 Virginia Tech massacre that resulted in the deaths of more than thirty people, when arguing for stricter gun control laws. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi points to the Virginia Tech shooting as an example of why there is an urgent national need to improve the background check system to keep guns out of the hands of those barred from buying them." (See House Tempers Background Checks for Guns.) While some gun rights advocates responded to the Virginia Tech shooting by arguing for the rights of college students to carry concealed weapons on campuses, Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research in Baltimore, Maryland, argues that concealed carry laws do not save lives, as the proponents contend. (See Should Students Be Allowed to Carry Concealed Weapons?.) Author Wendy Kaminer counters gun rights fears that gun control will prevent them from mounting successful insurrections against an oppressive state. According to Kaminer, [i]nvisible surveillance techniques are proliferating, privacy is history, and the notion that guns guarantee liberty is increasingly ridiculous. Second Amendment rights are relatively secure today, but as restraints on government, they're also less important. (See Straight Shooting on Gun Control.)      Opponents to gun-control laws assert that the Second Amendment grants citizens the constitutional right to bear arms. According to Senator Orrin Hatch, the right to bear arms is among Americans most cherished constitutional rights. (See The Second Amendment and Gun Safety, or The Right to Bear Arms Safely.) Another argument used by gun rights advocates is that guns should be allowed for self-protection. Don B. Kates, criminologist and civil liberties lawyer associated with the Pacific Research Institute, warns that the ultimate goal of gun control advocates is to keep ordinary people from having firearms readily available for self-defense. (See Straight Shooting on Gun Control.) Following the April 2007 Virginia Tech shooting rampage that resulted in the deaths of more than thirty people, Philip Van Clean, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League says that students are angry that they can't protect themselves." (See Should Students Be Allowed to Carry Concealed Weapons? In 2005, Florida enacted a landmark Stand Your Ground law that allows people to defend themselves with deadly force in public places. Marion P. Hammer, executive director of the Unified Sportsmen of Florida, welcomed this law, saying that "[t]he ability to protect yourself, your children or your spouse is important, no matter where you are." (See Fla.'s Castle Law Is Win for Gun Advocates.) Another position taken by gun rights advocates is that guns are needed for citizens to protect themselves from government tyranny and that the possession of arms is essential to preserving political and civil rights. (See How Good Are Guns?) In 2006, the National Rifle Association launched a campaign to get mayors and police chiefs to pledge that they will never confiscate guns in times of emergencies. (See NRA Encourages Mayors Not to Confiscate Guns During Emergencies.)|`|XwtmNIMOaa	They provide protection from tyranny.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	good for defense, protection  -that's a big one    kill people who don't deserve to live.

9tcv3TiWaa	DLA is Dislocation allowance only if you are on PCS orders.  if he already PCSd to Virginia and you are coming later then he might not receive it at all.  He has to put in the form for it, if you do qualify for it then it is paid about 10 days before the move and starts at $1800 and goes up from there depending on his Rate.    If it is an authorized PCS then yes they do pay for the move, give you MALT & per Diem to move there and the DLA.  The MALT pays for mileage ($.24 per mile), Per Diem is for lodging ($109 for AD or spouse if by self, 75% for those over 12, 50% for those under 12 per day) and food.  DLA is to cover things like rental cars, basic foods for the house, deposits, etc...      Housing wait time depends on availability to what you qualify for, not necessarily Rate &   of dependents.  The housing areas are specific to who can be in what and how many dependent are authorized.  If two families sign up for one area and one is an E6 with 3 dependents and the other is E5 with 3 dependents the E6 won't get in faster tan the E5, it will depend on the date you signed up for housing.  If the E5 signed up 3 days before then they get it first.   Sometimes it can be right away getting into housing and other times it can be up to 18 month wait times.  They can say that it is 3 months but you get a call in 3 days, or they say it is 6 months and you don't get teh call until you leave.    They can't give you a specific date to move into housing, they can give you an estimate.  Sometimes people get orders with very short notice or orders can be canceled or changed at the last minute, so that plays into factor as well.    If you are eligible for housing now, then sign up now

The Government gave the Banks the American  tax money to them.  5. The banks are still taking American peoples homes and 3 million still have no jobs.    In other words the Government stole our money - then gave it to the banks to stimulate the economy.    Had the Government returned our money or simply spent 525 million dollars by giving each one of us 150 thousand we could have saved our homes stimulated the economy and the banks and had money left over to stimulate the economy - very simple and easy.    But the Government decided to piss outr money away on the rich and further help destroy the economy. How can a man with no home and no job receive a loan from a bank that is taking their home.

I believe a stimulus is needed but this particular bill is full of many things that will not stimulate the economy.  1.Huge increases in federal aid for education. Not a bad thing but that will not stimulate anything but the NEA.  2.Several billion dollars to convert medical records into electronic forms? How does that help me pay my bills?  3. People on unemployment get medicaid. So, if a multimillionaire gets laid of, he files for unemployment and we have to pay for his health insurance?    I am against spending money to "stimulate the economy" that does not do just that. If you want to spend money on social programs or to socialize medicine then fine we can debate those issues. Remember, Decent is our patriotic duty according to Rep. Pelosi and Sen. Reid.    Your response regarding rebuilding another country sounds very Libertarian.

We have sent billions of dollars to the Palestinians without 1 thing in return. Are you against all aid to all foreign governments or just Arab governments?    We of course can be attacked just like the WTC. The fact is however, since 9/11 we have not been attacked. After the first WTC attack we had embassies in Africa attacked, but not after the terorist started fighting us in Iraq and Afghanistan.

You trying to hide something??|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Better buy a Time Life commemorative plate to hang on your trailer wall then.

Thanks.|`|jZZ6KZVxaa	We must rid this clown....(Obama)  Fire him, impeach him.|`|3WLec6lsaa	Haha|`|bkav003oaa	No, the other comments you made are your interpretation of the events, and are not worth arguing.     So no PRESIDENT Obama did not make history today.|`|AA11280073	Where were you when George Bush was stealing us blind and left us with a debt in the trillions?|`|3f7UV5zDaa	He knows that his judgment is now coming under serious questioning  even by his sheeple which is also a first. (New Your Times?  OMG!)  He believes if he takes responsibility it will be such a shock to everyone it will deflect any further questions on the subject.    His answer on the issue now will be, "hey, I took responsibilty, what more do you want me to do?"  Typical Obama move.|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	Yes he did. He stepped up to the plate.    Now look at what he did this morning as well    He single handedly:    Reversed "global warming".    Plugged the hole in the ozone.    Restored electricity to the states without it.    Created a lasting peace in Gaza between Hamas and Israel.    Personally spotted Osama and then flew the plane that dropped the JDAM on Osamas head.     He also balanced the budget and put us in surplus territory and made gasoline 50 cents a gallon under a Presidential Executive order.      THEN he went to lunch...    WHATTA Guy!!!!!!|`|rZTGDgYQaa	Sorry like but have you ever heard of George Bush?|`|4TqERLSgaa	He only did it, to save face. We all know Obama is the biggest tax evader of them all.|`|4ZOoSO1Eaa	nope|`|ERVib5gYaa	Well how very courageous of him but I'm sure other presidents have apologised and took responsiblity for things too.|`|7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	It was rather interesting, wasn't it?

YUjVFkocaa	1) Idk who mentioned racism, but that's stupid... it's usually democrats who bring race and racism up... and yes i know you didnt, good job.    2) yes there are people in our party who don't pay taxes.    The problem is that ALL the mexican illegal immigrants vote democrat, and NONE of them pay taxes.  They are the only people I'm worried about.  All other dems are fine, in my opinion.  It's just them.  They're here illegally, and they need to leave.  They're breaking the law.    3) You must live in a nice area, or at least an area where there is few illegal immigrants.... and PS if you ARE friends with a mexican illegal immigrant... THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AROUND HAPPILY ADMITTING THEY'RE ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO DON'T PAY TAXES!  IT'S LIKE A SERIAL KILLER, OR ANYBODY ELSE WHO COMMITS A CRIME..... THEY HIDE IT!    You REALLY think that people are GOING TO ADMIT not paying taxes, or being illegal?    I bet you could go up to everybody in america and be like "are you a murderer?" and they'd say no.  SECRETLY, a very small % of them would be lying, and were in actuality murderers.  the same is true with tax evaders.    4) It's hypocritical to get mad at A FEW republicans for stereotyping dems as not paying taxes.... and then turn around and accuse ALL republicans (or at least republicans IN GENERAL) of stereotyping you that way!     It's not all of them... it's a small %! most republicans tend to have FAMILY, WORK, JOBS, KIDS, WIVES/HUSBANDS, and LIVES to worry about!!!|`|ERVib5gYaa	No and because some republicans happen to be racist, does that mean all republicans are? No...  Funny you didn't mention that.  Truth?..|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	If you follow the news, you realize that it is more than "a couple."|`|8a3bb05fac18cc11e58899cd0251e212aa	It seems that everyone Obama touches is crooked in some way- everything he touches turns to crap.

It's obvious the "Dems" we're talking about are in O's cabinet.|`|h0LR993Uaa	Okay, so you say that it isn't mature to judge everyone in a group by a couple of the group members. You also say, however, "Just a note to Republicans on here, please don't act like your party is so innocent and perfect..." And that doesn't sound hypocritical of you at all...    Wow, the double-talk of some liberals astounds me. If you don't want us to judge all of you by the few, don't judge all of us by the few!|`|SjTAVdcKaa	It is a practical way of ascertaining the quality of any group when you cannot examine all contents minutely.

Unfortunately though, it's something anyone who affiliates with any group has and will experience.  Who knows when we'll be ready to not generalize like that...|`|SgfBzfIqaa	nicely said =)|`|TuDQHk8Xaa	Sometimes a small sample of 2 is indicative of a trend in the larger group.

You have never said that all republicans are racist because they didn't vote for Obama.    I understand where you are coming from, but their immaturity isn't something that you should really be too worried about. Just blow it off because they are always going to be immature.
FfPUhCuiaa	I started to read your answers before I answered and I had to stop!  The ridiculous answers from the the Dems, "oh it was an honest mistake"  Yeah Right!!

Talk about hypocrisy!!|`|AA12278670	Heeeyyyyy...I NEVER cheat on mine, Dude, and I got screwed last year...|`|2kgTdNRQaa	Oh, you don't have to be a Democrat to cheat on taxes.

You need to read more up to date articles my friend.    Ireland is now the first eurozone state in official recession. Unemployment has risen from 5pc to 6.1pc since January.     The state guarantee exceeds 200pc of Irish GDP, marking a new phase in the escalation of the crisis.    The move came as Standard & Poor's cut Iceland's sovereign credit rating from AA- to A+ following its nationalisation of Glitnir Bank. It is a warning that the cascade of bank bail-outs on both sides of the Atlantic could start to undermine the credit-worthiness of Western states.    Ireland became the first euro area economy to slide into a recession, as homebuilding and consumer spending slumped and the global financial crisis intensified.    Gross domestic product contracted 0.5 percent in the three months through June from the previous quarter, when it shrank 0.3 percent, the Central Statistics Office said Thursday in Dublin. From a year earlier, the economy lost 0.8 percent.    The housing collapse, coupled with the global credit crisis, forced the Irish government to slash spending to keep its deficit in check and pushed the benchmark stock index to fall more than any other in western Europe this year. Ireland's slump may be followed by recessions across Europe, according to the European Commission, which has cut its forecasts for growth across the euro area.    In the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in Ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy. Strong demand partly explains this: incomes, employment and population all grew robustly. The increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenalthe number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s, which compares with static output in the euro area and in the UK. However, when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem, the enormous increase in prices was unjustified.    Yeah it's booming alright. I suspect that your definition of booming differs from mine.                                                      I am curious do you own a passport? Or a library card?|`|wVik8Fo7aa	According to recent reports, Ireland's economy is heading toward a deep abyss.  The Bush tax cuts that leaned toward the wealthiest 1% are part of the current crisis.  The majority of economic experts agree that taxpayers either save their checks or pay down debt.  The tax cuts last spring generated no stimulus whatsoever.    http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/01/2...|`|026b1934d4ff58e232cc4b419808adc4aa	This does not exactly sound like a booming economy. They have just lost thousands of jobs because Dell decided they wanted to move to Poland. The days of the Celtic Tiger are gone. I remember reading that things are so bad in Ireland, there are those that are threatening that if they don't get a bailout from Europe, they want to pull out of the EU.     Things all over aren't good, including in Ireland.|`|Ry6Tzvhxaa	Ireland has less than 6 million people. There are 305million in  the USA. I'm sure that there are 6 million people in the USA who make more money than all the people in Ireland put together. Heck there are 19 million in New York State alone.    Comparing the USA and Ireland is like apples and oranges.

It's like Al Gore preaching for us to drive less while he goes off on private jets.|`|BsQcplTQaa	Whats funny is that Democrats said that paying taxes is our patriotic duty. I guess the Dems really are not patriotic.

The USA has has aspects of "socialism" for decades, which is why it's so hilarious watching the conservative sheeple soil themselves in fear any time a conservative talking head screeches the word "SOCIALISM!"|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Morganie is correct.  Socialism is a term that cannot be used to describe particular aspects of a governmental system.  Medicare/social security are the same types of programs, and not many citizens disagree with those.  In case you weren't aware, we also pay for health insurance for governmental officials whether they're in office or retired.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	Way too much so|`|026b1934d4ff58e232cc4b419808adc4aa	The dirty little secret that many people wouldn't want known is that all industrialized nations are socialist to an extent, even the US.

Public schools, public paid police and fire protection, public funded roads, etc.|`|uFTO5rs8aa	That's only mild socialism. True socialism is when the government controls an industry almost completely or completely, leaving you with other option to give that said service.  Firefighters for example are socialized; you call 911 and they will always send you tax-funded firefighters and there's really no "private" firefighting service.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	i thinj america has always been somewhat socialist.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	We have some social programs but that doesnt make us socialist|`|NlzlBV8Haa	That's not what socialism means.    It means the government runs industry and controlls the private sector economically.    "Socialism refers to a broad set of economic theories of social organization advocating state or collective ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods, and a society characterized by equal opportunities for all individuals with a fair or egalitarian method of compensation."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism|`|TfpeYyuwaa	Well our police and fire departments are socialized, aren't they? Would you rather that people pay as they could afford for law enforcement or public safety?    At one time in our history, Fire Departments were privatized and they actually used to fight with each other before putting out the fire to get the job. In Russia, many of the super rich business owners hire their own security forces because they can't trust the police. Who would want that?|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Yes.  The actual creation of the United States Government was done with some socialistic ideals.  But don't tell the Republicans that.  They don't believe it.  But that is because they don't know socialism.|`|q3E1ouQvaa	Yes, it is.    "It means the government runs industry and controlls the private sector economically."    Wake up. It already does.    [edit]Ahh... look at all the obedient little socialists showing up to defend their sleazy politics.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	The US military is a socialist organization. Goverrnment funded and controlled.

Thanks to Andrew Jackson. I beleive,maybe Iam wrong, but, the civil war was 'pay back time' for the land grabbers. Sad, the Civil War was really horrible and I would never wish war on anyone-but, they have stolen the land and killed the Indians-about 30 years after the removal-the Civil War started-'what goes around-comes back around'. I could be so wrong about that-but, something I think about, as, I like to study the civil war. The European/whites-Iam mixed and part white,too, will never except the Native American. The Cherokees have a sad story,indeed, like most of the tribes. We are  not vocal about it-as the blacks are-quietly we try to meld into society and do the best we can.

BImIMnbzaa	I assume you mean boot camp.  This is about twelve weeks of kick @ss training to become a US Marine.  If he survives boot camp and graduates, he will be a proud member of the US Marine Corps.  A lot of people who try out for boot camp, don't survive and they drop out.  hopefully this won't happen to your cousin.    The training includes learning discipline and military procedure.  It requires alot of physical training and challanges that test an individuals   physical ability and courage under adverse conditions.  They learn all about weaponry and how to use them efficiently.  Each recruit is issued a rifle, and it is his to take care of and learn how it functions.  He even learns how to use it.    Each recruit learns the fundamentals of being a Marine, and after twelve weeks of training and he still falls into formation when told to do so, he has earned the title of a US Marine.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Enlisting in the Marines and graduating from Marine Corps Boot Camp (basic training) marks a turning point in a persons life.  There are no words that can describe the importance of being a Marine.  It's a commitment to God, Country, and a loyal brotherhood of other Marines.  God bless every one of them.  You have a few more years left before you make any life changing decisions.  But, keep up your grades in school.  And keep your personal life and background clean.  Lots of luck to your cousin and to you.|`|dSbAz63baa	It's not hard as civilians think. It's more mental than physical. Compared to Rangers, marine boot camp is a cake walk. To complete marine boot camp you run 3 miles, Rangers run 12 miles, take a 30 second water break, pack on 60lbs and hump 10 more miles *daily*. See the difference?

There are two areas that train recruits: one in San Diego (if you are a male and live west of the Mississippi River) and the other in Parris Island (if you live east of the Mississippi River.) All Marines will go to the same boot camp regardless of MOS, being active or reservists. Genders are trained separately. Males are trained by male drill instructors & a Senior Drill Instructor and females are trained by female drill instructors & Senior Drill Instructor. Females are trained at Parris Island only. After graduation, Marines are granted 10 days leave before reporting to School of Infantry (SOI.)  SOI consist of Marine Combat Training (for non infantry Marines which is now 29 days) and Infantry Training Battalion (which is 52 days for all infantry Marines.) At SOI a male Marine can have the opportunity to try out for MARSOC. Non Infantry Marines will report to their MOS school which varies in length. All reservists and active duty Marines go through these same initial training. For 92 day reservists they would still go to boot camp but will hold off on the other training(s) for the time being. It sorta confusing how a 92 day reservist thing works so I'll hold off there.|`|YV3A8K4haa	a recruiting offer will answer all your questions.and he will be more than happy to do it.tell him your story.|`|TscadMqFaa	the training consists of a 13 week training camp where, the longest and toughest of the armed forces.

RkfIPD7Iaa	The law does not say 'or a member of the stage crew'.  It doesn't even say guardian, it says 'parent'.    Actually, that seems an odd wording, but as it stands, I doubt you can get around it.  I suppose the rationale is that these are small kids, they need a parent with them.    Edit: on National Tours of productions such as Annie, the parents are brought along, just as the law requires.|`|1NWjta2jaa	No, the court will not do it. Temporary Guardianship means that parent's rights are suspended for the duration of the guardianship. No parents in their right mind will surrender their rights to you even temporary and no court will force this.  This is a serious matter and you MUST consult an attorney specializing in this area. Are you really going to take an advice of "experts" like me here and act on such advice? Go to an attorney before you do anything or you'll get in a huge mess.|`|wT3dGUSkaa	Gosh, have you talked to a lawyer?

5YTkGB5yaa	Its funny how Joe the Plumber essentially was a nobody who owed $1000 in back taxes and was slaughtered by the media, but these high level members of government that owe $125,000 get a free pass.|`|AA10691319	because joe the plumber made obama look like an idiot, but obama's cabinet has done nothing but kiss is butt.|`|AA11598520	Right! I guess they were unaware. There's a shock!|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	I wasn't upset.  Honestly, knowing what I know about owing taxes especially when running your own business, I really didn't think it such a huge deal.  Many business owners owe taxes for one reason or another.    But what I find so funny is the hypocrisy that Republicans have for things.  They are just as bad as Democrats. . .|`|AA11288277	Democrats by and large are more "do as I say" not "do as I do" type people...therefore they are above such petty things like paying taxes.  Paying taxes is for the little people.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Because that was BEFORE the election. This is after. ;-)    [Edit - come to think of it, it is far WORSE for an elected official seeking a federal portfolio post to owe back taxes, than some plumber in Ohio who happened to make Obama say "spread the wealth"]|`|vIO2jWu9aa	Joe is small potatoes compared to some of these losers! Charlie Rangle didn't even have to pay penalties and interest.    I can't believe people are buying this sh*t about an "honest mistake." This whole thing really stinks!|`|oMOiAFRBaa	It's about time someone asks the question.    The more important question is why it is not okay for Joe the Plumber to own a couple grand on a lien he didn't even know about when it is okay for two appointees to owe anywhere from 30 to 100 times more and get a free pass from the Obama supporters?    I thought we were supposed to be about having a clean government and transparency.  Whatever happened to a new style of governing?  Whatever happened to change?    Edit: Perhaps most importantly, why are Republicans constantly being accused of not paying their fair share of taxes when the opposite, is in fact, what is really true?|`|WoESqX8gaa	Because the liberal motto is Do as I say and not as I do.  Btw did you know crackers are not considered a racist term?But is called a food,But now watermelon is considered a racist term.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	They are hypocrites.|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	It's called double standard. It's only OK to cheat on taxes if you are in a certain party. Left, that is. It's a trend there. It's like this secret contest they have, they all have friends who cheated on taxes, one way or another. I bet if their back taxes were paid in full, our economy would not need a stimulus anymore, it would go from decline to a jump start, ASAP. Think about it.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	I guess there is one standard for the Obama administration, and one for the private sector.  Joe the plumber must be seething about now.|`|GGJ8T6uYaa	Per usual, the liberals/Dems have absolutely no reasonable, intelligent response to this question and others like it - their usual abundance of ignorance.     I would like to see us, the informed minority, go ahead and complete our 2008 tax forms, and those of us who need to pay an underpayment simply send an IOU to the IRS and cc Barack, Tim, Charlie and Tom, thanking them for the great example they've set for us.  With mine I'll state that I would love to come to work for the BO administration, and my non-payment should be my best qualification.|`|qkC4Imliaa	As a Democrat, I say its not okay. (for either)    Actually I could care less if Joe "The Plumber" owes the govt $1000.    Daschle withdrew, the President apologized.    For 8 years did Bush ever apologize for anything ?|`|3f7UV5zDaa	Because they are hypocrites and they all have double standards.|`|bkav003oaa	Most Democrats were not upset over the taxes issue, but rather his obviously planned and calculated question that concealed his personal situation.     Obama's nominees both paid their taxes after the error was discovered.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	What do you mean its ok, they had their names withdrawn didnt they?    People were more irked by Joe's blatent hypocricy and the fact he was a fake plant with no legitimate point. The taxes were just a cherry on that particular cake.|`|cDaxALCFaa	Because he was stating how he doesn't want to pay taxes for his "Plumbing Business". He doesn't have a plumbing Business, he doesn't have a plumbing license, he was behind on his taxes for over a year, and he was turned into a propaganda/republican action figure for it.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	God I hope this lady gets a real answer to this question! Then I get to know the answer!|`|UAQkh57iaa	This is another good reason to go to the FairTax.  We wouldn't be havin these problems in the future.  I think that it is atrocious for the head of the IRS to be a tax evader.  They want to share the wealth, just not theirs.    The vetting in this whole administration has been done by a real Veterinarian.   lol!    God help America!|`|AA12191521	Joe dared to question the messiah and made him look bad by revealing his communist agenda. Therefor, he must be destroyed. Those that further the goals of that agenda are above reproach. Its just like the pigs in Animal Farm. All animals are created equal but some are more equal than others. Such a clever allegorical condemnation of communism. And it still rings true.
RkfIPD7Iaa	Absolutely.      With only one eye, you have no depth perception.  During daylight, you will be able to judge distances by your knowledge of size and shape.  At night, though, you will have zero depth awareness, and are a significant risk on the road.    Once this is reported, you probably won't be able to get insurance anyway.    At the very least, they will restrict you to daylight driving.  But you'll probably lose it altogether.  Sucks, but the safety of others is more important than your mobility.|`|AA12071655	Report it to the state? New one on me. You can still hold a driver's license with vision in only one eye though.|`|wlgRsZpfaa	they probably have to give you a test first, but i think its unfair. maybe they should though, in case anything sudden happens. don't take a risk, give it in if you have to.|`|nbibIzC5aa	It is a public safety issue.  The state has a right to determine who they deem fit to have a license.  If your vision is restricted in any way then they have a right to take your license away.      This may also be a good thing.  Should you get into an accident with one good eye, I will guarantee that you will be sued for negligence which could result in a lot more than you simply losing your license.

It is difficult to tell that anybody is high on pot if they aren't acting stoned. If you are going to smoke weed it is best to not do it in your car. The vast majority of the people I know who ever got busted for weed were driving around smoking it. It's stupid.    They can.t bust you for the smell, but they can us it as reasonable suspicion and conduct a search.|`|AA10123414	They arrest you for suspicion of driving while intoxicated and do a blood test. test positive and lose.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	well if they found nothing and you were acting normal and they gave you no test then you can fight it and win just becuase they smell it does not allow them to issue a ticket  but do me a favor stop smoking the funny stuff it is not worth it trust me|`|AaXl3vcCaa	smelling it gives them probably cause and yes they can take you to do a blood test or UA, they have complex training on other ways to detect intoxication besides the obvious (some of them are wrong, a cop in my hometown said pot turns your tongue green and arrested my friend)|`|Em88Qn3Oaa	Tye odor of marijuana in your vehicle means that the police now have a reasonable suspicion to investigate further.

Just my opinion.|`|DNnZIFSQaa	Just say "No" to drugs. It's really not that hard. And this is coming from a freshman in high school.

It didn't get this way on it's own and it won't correct itself on it's own. This is not a normal recession. We can't simply spend our way out of this. We live on imports.

He told CNN that even three months ago, most economists would not have predicted the economy was "in as bad of a situation as we are in right now."  There is "no magic bullet," he told Fox News. But he says that working with Congress on his economic package, "we are closer to getting it right."|`|7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	Generally, we want something that will demonstrate immediate results, such as tax cuts.  This helps everyone who pays income tax, which is going to be a HUGE help.    Next, cut the capital gains tax on investments.  This will give people the confidence and incentive to start putting their money into the market again.  Companies are the beneficiaries of this money (you're investing in a company's future), giving the company financial resources to hire more workers and sell more product.

JOXQrsw0aa	I don't think the minimum scores for the Service Academy CFA are released. I don't know if you are a guy or a girl, but since most applying to West Point are guys, I'll assume you are. In that case, I'd be a little concerned about 34 sit ups especially in light of your other scores. That  would not be a qualifying score for this event on the  ARMY PFT. A Minimum score of  60 is required and for a 17-21 year old male translates to  53 Sit Ups. It is a different set of tests but the situps are also over two minutes. Sit Ups are probably  the area where it is possible to improve the score substantially in a short period of time.  http://usmilitary.about.com/od/army/l/bl...    Advice to the Candidate  In order to qualify for admission to the Service  Academies, you must take the CFA. You should  remember that your score is a combination of your  best efforts on each of the six events. Strive for  excellence and the highest possible score.

JDltTREfaa	It depends on what exactly you want to contest and what the circumstances where throughout the process.  (i.e., where you properly served with the Summons or did everything happen while you were out of the country?  Did you leave the country in the middle of your divorce and blow off court dates?)    If everything happened while you were out of the country and a default judgment was entered against you and you just found out about it, you can probably file for a Motion to Vacate the Default Judgment.    If you left during the middle of your divorce and didn't participate during the process, you are probably SOL.  (The argument would be that you don't get to blow off hearing dates and then come back to the court crying because you don't like the decision . . . especially not three years after the fact!)|`|RjpPzbBJaa	I agree. Here in the US the spouse has to be served divorce papers in order for them to be filed legally. If a spouse was not served papers then technically the divorce cannot continue.  Were you served papers? Did you ignore or were you not able to attend court?  If the divorce has been finalized and you're legally divorced then its not likely a judge will allow you to contest it unless you can show some fraud on part of your spouse that would nullify the divorce.|`|3afb1a9998ec7ae77d5dc07fa7abfe2aaa	Nope - what's to contest?

It was the closing days of the Bush Presidency.    Now the Republicans have been slapped across the face by watching both Congress and the Senate get handed over to the Dem's.    The Republicans at this point want two things.    First, they want to be back in power.    Second, to get back into power, they are shifting away from being Republican, and toward being Conservatives.    Finally, this works for both sides. When the Dem's are out of office, they try to get back in. And once in office they shift away from mild campaign speeches to the hard left party line.

If you've been married for more than 2 years, you're eligible for a permanent green card immediately.

Obama writes in Dreams From My Father that he saw Frank only a few days before he left Hawaii for college. He said that Davis called college an advanced degree in compromise, warned Obama not to forget his people, and not to start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the American way and all that sh1t.    The record shows that Obama was in Hawaii from 1971-1979, where he developed his close relationship, almost like a son, with Davis, and listened to his poetry and views about such topics as Trotsky's Red Army.  http://www.aim.org/aim-report/obamas-red...      2)  According to his campaign staff, Mr. Obama visited Pakistan in 1981, on the way back from Indonesia, where his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, were living.

GXrHjEgvaa	Gaza can end up in a final war    Somalia is pretty stone age and not a dangeroud|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	A few of us are keeping up with Somalia, its just not making the major headlines.    Iran has strong ties with Somalia for instance, but ya don't hear much about that.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	Both are wrong, the difference is we fund the genocide in regards to Israel. Therein lies the policy debated, and thumbs down does not end it.|`|3WLec6lsaa	the first few people got it right|`|QgE85Qynaa	This is due to two major reasons.  Firstly, while the US (which controls a hefty amount of international media) will occasionally show a clip about Somalia, it will tend to focus on the Israel/Palestine issue simply because the US has more ties to Israel than to Somalia and therefore the Palestinian conflict is more important. As a result, there isn't a whole lot of coverage in the English speaking media (in some other major non-Western news corporations such as Al Jezeera, stories about Somalia are far more common).    The second reason is, in short, due to racism. As tragic as it is, the West expects starvation, displacement, disease, and war of Africa. If three thousand were to suddenly die in southern Sudan the West would simply shrug its shoulders and go about its business. To the West, Africa is a lost cause- a continent of hopelessness. If three thousand were to die in southern California, the world would be shocked but in Africa? No way. As I've already stated- it's about racism. A higher value is placed on the life of a Westerner than on the life of an African or a South-East Asian or an Arab. Since Africa is on the bottom of the West's level of expectations, the Palestinian conflict gets more coverage by default.

c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	The Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy (1855-1931), a Baptist minister, a Christian Socialist, and the cousin of Socialist Utopian novelist Edward Bellamy (1850-1898). Bellamy's original "Pledge of Allegiance" was published in the September 8th issue of the popular children's magazine The Youth's Companion as part of the National Public-School Celebration of Columbus Day, a celebration of the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's discovery of America, conceived by James B. Upham.    Bellamy's original Pledge read, "I Pledge Allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all."    The pledge was supposed to be quick and to the point. Bellamy designed it to be stated in 15 seconds.    In 1952, Holger Christian Langmack wrote a letter to President Truman suggesting the inclusion of "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Langmack was a Danish Philosopher and Educator who came to America in 1911. He was one of the originators of the Prayer Breakfast, and a religious leader in Washington DC. President Truman responded to Mr.Langmack, and agreed to meet him along with several others to discuss the inclusion of "under God" and also "love" just before "Liberty and Justice". This meeting took place in 1952, and the seed was planted for the inclusion of "under God".    Senator Homer Ferguson, in his report to the Congress on March 10, 1954, said, "The introduction of this joint resolution was suggested to me by a sermon given recently by the Rev. George M. Docherty, of Washington, D.C., who is pastor of the church at which Lincoln worshipped." This time Congress concurred with the Oakman-Ferguson resolution, and Eisenhower opted to sign the bill into law on Flag Day (June 14, 1954). The fact that Eisenhower clearly had Dochertys rationale in mind as he initiated and consummated this measure is apparent in a letter he wrote in August, 1954.|`|EfLOc8K0aa	Eisenhower|`|FfxmE9Toaa	Eisenhower, during the McCarthy Red Scare era in 1954.

Because they are on probation, they have already been charged so the statute of limitations does not apply.    If the person was on probation and failed to report, the probation period would be suspended. Once they are apprehended, they would still have to finish their original probaitonary period, plus they may have other penaties as well.

IV6aRyI7aa	Hi, I am in Clearwater Florida, 15 miles from Tampa. There are 2-3 jails in Tampa, You can go here and se if he is in this Jail, http://www.hcso.tampa.fl.us/pub/default....    If he isnt then try the Orient Road Jail In Tampa Florida. I can assure he is fine, although the conditions are not like home sweet home (they arent supposed to be) He is safe nd doing fine. however I have heard that the men who have commited such crimes as rape, child abuse etc, do have a tougher time in Jail, because you get harrassed alittle by the other inmates. If he is in Gen Pop thenhe is fine. The food is grossm but he wil eat it if he is hungry enough. You can send him money for his acct,so he can buy food and clothing anf toiletries from the commisary. You canalso write to him as well, just remember the officers read the mail. As to what ists like, well, its boreing, sometimes noisy and there is no privacy. The showers are scrubbed everyday as are the bathrooms. You can laundry sometimes 2 times a week.. Breakfast is at 4 am usually which really sucks. If he can get into any programs, suggest to him that he should, it will look better to judge and help him Pass time.    Hope this Helps :

I have lived in many places, currently reside in california and see nothing wrong with having a tight-knit family.  I have met many racists and bigots and all of them are democrats.    Now here's your daily dose of fun - how exactly are the democrats helping other people?  We had a democrat in power for 8 years in the 90s and the poor people who voted for him are still poor.  The democrats help THEMSELVES, not the poor.  They only throw crumbs to the poor (especially minorities) and then point to the Republicans when the poor look for someone to blame for their lot in life.  They don't try to make their lives better because they are brainwashed to believe the lie that you are propagating here right now - that the democrats are here to "help people." The democrats have a vested interest in keeping the poor just as they are - poor - so they can have a loyal voting block.    I repeat, the democrats do NOT want to help the poor and they are among the most racist and bigoted people in America.  90% of the bigoted attacks against Obama during the last election cycle came from HILLARY supporters, not Republicans.    Finally, I am hardly some racist bigot.  I am latino.  I have never had a Republican make a racist comment to me.  I have heard plenty of democrats tell me to "go back to my country" and accuse my people of causing America's economic woes.  So go to hell with your self-righteous indignation.  The democrats are the racist scum, they are the ones keeping the poor and minorities DOWN for political reasons.  They know that if we ever rise up and become powerful too that they will lose a powerful support base.|`|AA12229787	So, if someone is Black, that automatically makes him a good President?

RANWeh9Uaa	The politicians will let this go in one ear and out of the other. The sad truth is the Government does not listen. they have their own twisted agenda to continue down the path of a Country without God.     A Government of lies and deceit. A Government bent on socialism and the destruction of the United States Constitution.    I am a proud member of the NRA|`|22tPNksKaa	I kind of agree on what he said, but I am an Atheist, I do not believe in a God nor do I have a soul. But I never would have done what they did, because my parents taught me to be a decent person, they never allowed  me to indulge in wicked behavior.    Klebold & Harris are to blame. As are their parents. As minors, they are the responsibility of their parents. their friends are to blame as well. One bought them the guns & others watched them use them irresponsibly.    And they made PIPE BOMBS!!! How could their parents not notice that?!    Changing gun laws had no effect on that. Parents need to take responsibility!    Byn the way, I grew up around guns, I listened to objectionable music & played shoot-em-ups. I was even bullied. But did I mow down the school? NO!    Actually I must confess. I am only an ideal citizen BECAUSE I am an atheist. I fear anything that threatens the span of my life & it's quality! Like death or prison! Because after this life is oblivion. So I am a good little boy so my eternity in the dark among the worms is delayed aas long as possible. My parents taught me the world was out to hurt & kill me, unless I was a Saint. There is no better way to teach your kids. Make them fear death & prison. Klebold & Harris were spoiled.    End of Sermon. I weep for the families.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Simple.    While the NRA is not the ones to blame for the gun deaths in the nation, the same can be said of God being the cure for it.    Education is the answer.  Parents are the answer.  The kids that kill other kids don't have involved parents - they either have accomplaces, or they have no one.  Teaching kids that guns are not the answer, and that a real man doesn't pull out a gun and shoot an unarmed person is where we need to go.  Guns are glamourized in music, movies and books.  They are not glamorous - they are for cowards when used against another human being that is unarmed.    And parents need to be held accountable for their children's actions.  There is no way that a parent involved with their children wouldn't know if they were stock piling weapons and bombs, or stealing guns and using them in a mischeivous manner.  Yes - kids are sneaky, but parents are the adults, and there is no such thing as respecting a kid's privacy when it comes to their well being and your home.  All that a parent teaches a child when they "respect their rights" is that they can hide things from their parents and there is nothing they will do about it.    I am a church-goer.  I am also very involved with my church.  But what I will not listen to is the way to fix the world is to put God back into the schools.  There are way too many religions in our nation's schools to just look at one aspect and say that it is the way.  It is NOT the way - ownership and responsibility are.  Until humans do that and hold people responsible for their own actions, nothing will change.  Not even if you put God into the mix.  All it will do is teach some catchy prayers to kids and give them something else to complain about while in school.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	When I was a teenager at Lafayette High School, every day was started with the pledge of allegiance to the American Flag, and a prayer to God to bless our school day and to bless our school. Since prayers and the Bibles have been taken out of schools, the violence in schools has increased and gotten worse.|`|HYlWlETAaa	It is true that the evil is in the heart of men.  Weapons really don't kill people do.  When our government tries to take the weapons out of the hands of the people it is not to protect the people but the government.  Our forefathers gave us the right to bear arms so we could protect us from government evil.  God is what we need but we must be allowed to stand up for what is right.  The government will try to push the fear of violence to strip us of our rights.      If we ever loose our right to bear arms the true evil will be allowed to run wild.|`|AA10255776	Ah, so it's the godless liberals who killed those kids at Columbine, not the criminals with the guns.  Right.    The above transcript is simply the anguished opinion of a father who lost a child, it isn't fact.  The fact of the matter is that nobody was ever killed by a copy of Bertrand Russell's "Why I Am Not a Christian"; people are killed every day with guns.  Allowing prayer in school isn't going to change that, but it would further erode our First Amendment rights.  I've examined my heart, and it's just fine-it's the heart of a patriot.

In WW2 many were places in prison some were hanged. In the more recent SH as hanged for war crimes against humanity.  Also the POW  to held to certain rules also.

Keep in mind you can collect disability through the VA AND Social Security Disability (SSDI) on top of your VA disability. Not many people realize that. You may also get a backpay check from the point that you file the claim.     It can take between 180 days and a year for the VA to get back to you, but dont give up. They do not want to give you 100% right away, so if you keep showing that you are unable to work, they will likely eventually give you 100% or temp 100%.

I have anti Obama stickers and I live in a very Pro Obama town.  No one has done anything.  And if they do and I catch them, they will be dealt with!|`|AA12191521	We could wait until he actually commits a crime. This is what was so annoying about the "impeach bush" people. You can hate Obama you can oppose everything he does. But let's be serious about what an impeachment actually is. This unfortunately means we have to wait for him to break a law or violate the constitution before impeaching him. Don't worry though. It shouldn't take long.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Just google "Impeach Obama stickers" and a bunch of different websites come up|`|yaDPjzcPaa	he's already president, so don't cause anymore drama. it won't change anything. it'll just get people pissed at you.     and plus, bumper stickers are sort of tacky ... :/|`|AA10687492	Where can I get one of those bumper stickers that say "The Divided States of America"...?    Seriously, suck it up, He's the president. I'm not happy, you're not happy, and a lot more people aren't happy, but there is no reason to want  to impeach him (yet) so I think the conservatives need to chill out a little.|`|4TqERLSgaa	E-Mail Shawn Hannity at hannity@foxnews.com, he will send you one.

Look for any signs of Fundamentalist religious people, and you're there. Conservative land.  A land of clowns, foolishness and dreams. Go to the carnival tent where you get to pick which Middle Eastern Country has Nukes and if you pick Iraq and there's nothing under it, you win a slap on the face, you lose an election and you get a bumper sticker! hooray for you!
kc1IBYMRaa	About as relieved as I am that it's not Palin!|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Wow, that's a great question. "anyone but Bush", "anyone but Cheney"... Yeah, never mind an actual plan that has proven to work through history....let's use one that has proven to fail. Hey, but at least it isn't George Bush and Cheney right? Libs, I swear.<br>  <br>  Ah yes, it's so much better now having Joe Biden there. I kind of like Joe Biden though because he seems like a very funny guy and would be cool to hang out with...you know, unlike the snob Obama. <br>  <br>  The worst part was seeing Nancy "stretch" Pelosi in the background. Gees...don't they know any better? You're trying to impress the audience of seals flapping their flippers at every breathe Obama takes. You don't need this hideous womans face up there. Damn, it was hard to tell at times if I was watching Obama's speech or watching the Exorcist. I was waiting for her head to spin around and pea soup to come flying out.|`|GgG0inaUaa	Oh yea that bunch up there last night was much better. I have never seen a better bunch of village idiots in my life. I didn't think they would actually be able to get that many idiots to sit still for that long but I must say they did a pretty good job.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	I didn't even think about it.

We're in for a long four years..|`|11zIhgqvaa	Biden and Pelosi were clowns.  I could hardly hear what Mr. Pres. was saying.  Pelosi reading her program had to be nudged a couple times by Biden to stand and applaud (again and again and again).  She looked as stupid as she sounds and Biden looked like he had practiced his "serious" look for weeks.  All the members of congress were obliged to stand and applaud at the lead of those two clowns.  How ridiculous the whole fiasco appeared.|`|LTNLIT98aa	Cabbage Patch--pelsoie--and Weasel-Reid--and mickey Mouse--obama--and Goofy-Biden...<br>  <br>  It was like Walt Disney meets Matel Dolls--last night...<br>  <br>  Cheney?Are you still being a bad winner?|`|qjH3Tigbaa	I had no problem with Cheney or Bush.  They didn't doom the country.  It was our way of life for 30 years that caused all this not one individual administration.|`|bZy74U06aa	Biden just looked completely clueless about what was going on and Nazi Pelosi looked like evil personified.|`|McA6PFUyaa	how fitting for a far left liberal.<br>  not listening to the one they elected, and judging people by how they look on t.v.<br>  they've been trained not to listen, they know the government will think for them.|`|AA10792232	Yes, Biden's look of confusion is much more assuring.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Very . I breathed a sigh of relief .|`|OlcC4hwcaa	that cheny is an evil dude|`|1ksrcsYzaa	no- when I saw Crazy Joe==I got scared!!!!|`|AA11729207	You don't have a  mortgage, or pay taxes or pay for your health care, do you?|`|I6dcRgD6aa	yes, especially when the comment was made about Joe that had him beaming from ear to ear. It was so nice to see the beautiful, intelligent, caring people who were up there last night rather than that hatemonger.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I was both relieved and happy. Biden is a little too Conservative for my taste, but infinitely better than Chaney|`|DNaMIcomaa	It is funny. I did not think about Cheney until I listened to Bobbie Jindal when it occurred to me that Republicans all of a sudden are embracing fiscal responsibility. They have changed their tune from when Dick Cheney said "Reagan proved that defecits don't matter".|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	It was far more fun watching Biden glancing at Jack-in-the-box Pelosi for when to stand up and clap|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Not as relieved as I will be when Cheney is sitting in the electric chair.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	Not at all. We have replaced brains with bovine feces.
5ac2dCxJaa	Changing your dollars to pennies|`|AA10413336	They are both the same thing.  Obama will appoint you to a cabinet position if you pay all the taxes you owe.  He is making millions for his government by doing this.  Blago just wasn't quite as creative as Barry H O is.|`|HzVE4kz1aa	what do you want, the guy stepped down.
gO1iAm99aa	They should all get a 50% pay cut, That would save a bunch. If they no longer want the job at the new rate, there are plenty of unemployed who will gladly take the job and pay their taxes too.  Again something about Yeti surfing Hawaii first. They'll cut everyone but themselves first.   Myopic vision.  Many if not most government agencies get a (rough) predetermined budget. If they do not spend all of it they'll get less next year. If they go in debt, they can ask for more next year. Who thinks they get too much money? This part of the system has to change so we can get more for the money instead of more money for the same or less. It starts with a realistic correction in prices, value, wages and benefits, and it starts at the top. Lead by example, trickle down reality.|`|bXn6WGaXaa	They generally have a pretty accurate idea of how much money is coming in, and they will make the argument that operating on that basis makes it impossible for them to be proactive. Whether this is true or not, I don't know. I can't recall the last time I saw anything remotely resembling a proactive measure from any level of government.     That said, I don't think that a trillion dollar deficit (soon to be two) is something one simply re-jiggers the numbers to overcome. There's a bit of a difference between deciding not to eat out and trying to figure out which part of the government isn't going to be given the means to operate.|`|AA11313983	They could balance the budget, but you'll sooner find the yeti surfing the beaches of Hawaii.|`|ZphAhwy6aa	They are up to there ears in credit and owe more than they can pay back.Until the get caught up and be able to start at 0 there is no quick fix|`|6B1sxgtOaa	How could they control us if they had a balanced budget.  More taxes = less personal freedom and personal choices in our lives.  Taxes=control.
VKrePQZqaa	Clinton - What she would do to bolster the United States foreign reputation?    Napolitano - Ask her about the Borders of the US or what changes she can make to FEMA to make them more responsive in case of national emergencies.    Holder - where he stands on things like the Patriot Act, how we should treat prisoners of Guantanamo, in our legal system.    Geitner - where is money actual needed and what is exactly needed to get us going again. How long till we get there.    Gates - is the DOD doing enough in Afghanistan or Iraq, are we prepared if Iran or North Korea become larger threats. Do our soldiers have the best equipment possible
qRnXasisaa	after last nite, I easily put Jindal and Palin to the same category. Bless their hearts,  I hope that  he will be around years to come... his Charisma and his ethics are very amusing ...<br>  <br>   Mr. Jindal is meticulous, and very conservative. His campaign platform centred on a promise to cut taxes, ban abortion and introduce ethics reform. He opposes embryonic stem cell research and same-sex marriage.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090224.wobama_jindal25/BNStory/International/home?cid=al_gam_mostemail" rel="nofollow">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/s...</a>|`|oTAPazvcaa	Playing the "race card" kind early huh?

Yes, it is true.  I saw it for myself.  The liberals are the only ones who "worship" their leaders.  <br>  <br>  Boy, you guys really are threatened by Bobby Jindal all the sudden, aren't you?  There are lots and lots of questions about him today and the only insults you can manage to come with are about his heritage and the uneducated saying he is a poor speaker, which those of us who actually do have college educations know that he is a rather good speaker.|`|4850afc4e1575249b34a8547afc4c916aa	Hey guess what, after the speech last night by Gov.

Don Corleone: We already have a world bank http://www.worldbank.org/  and rightfully nobody cares.    And honestly, that is the bigger problem here. Let's say there really is a big conspiracy to create an Amero. Maybe it would be a bad idea, but you are acting like it would be the end of the world.

Alkn6IJYaa	Most studies show that Women get paid 20-30% less than men holding occupations, education, etc.. constant.    Let me repeat.    Most studies show that Women get paid 20-30% less than men holding occupations, education, etc.. constant.    Now, personally, it's generally not a good idea to believe something FOR NO REASON, just because you 'believe it'.  Simply because your boyfriend believes something is not generally adequate proof that it is true, for instance. In the old days, they use to burn witches on the testimony of someone who would just say 'they believed it to be true'.    We are now in the 21st century. Hopefully you will now refrain from thinking like you are in the middle ages. Perhaps you will read a book, a study, and educate yourself about the world, before you come here, and become a victim of propaganda.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Yes, it is true.  Wal-Mart was successfully sued due to it happening in their company.  My mother got a "raise" because of it when she was working there.

I think one major reasons why women are being held back, is do to home life.  Many families do still support the, "male work, female take care of the home and children" approach. While many of the successful women, don't have a family to hold them back.  Allowing them to have more freedom, to work on a career, in a curtain field. They have more time for studies and so on. Depends mainly on how an individual lady has grown up.  What she and her family believes is best for the family.  I have seen many males become stay at home parents, as the lady of the house worked as well.  So it can swing both ways.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Obama likes trial lawyers, and he threw them some freebies.

ObLMLZ74aa	It seems a few of the posters here don't understand what corruption is.  Plainly put, it is the abuse of public office for private gain.  By this commonly accepted definition, Bush's regime was one of the most corrupt in history.    In fact, consider the case of Iraq.   Iraq's drop to the bottom of international corruption ratings during the Bush years was nothing less than breathtakingly meteoric.  A coincidence?  I don't think so.  Check this out:     2003:  113 (this means 112 countries were less corrupt)  2004:  125   2005:  137  2006:  160  2007:  178   2008:  178 (in second to last place for "The most corrupt country in the world" honor)      Here are the rankings:  http://www.transparency.org/policy_resea...  Click on the CPI rankings in the left hand margin by year to track Iraq's decline for yourself.  (Notice the USA's relative drop in the rankings as well.)    Calling the Democratic Party "a culture of corruption" is patently absurd.    EDIT:  Ladydreamer24:  Adultery, murder and lies is not corruption.

Wow, what a hypocrite! At least write a clear question! There's no punctuation! I hate that!|`|AA11963685	Party lemming sounds about right.  Republicans have the shortest memories of any group of people I have ever known.  All day they've been salivating over the tax crap, screaming about bad appointments.  Bush made some of the worst appointments of any President I've had the pleasure to live under. At least Obama's problem, which seems to be a lousy vetting team, is being taken of before they ever take office. This time around maybe we won't have to endure Congressional hearings to remove lousy incompetent people that the President appointed when giving out favors to his cronies.     I was an Independent for over 25 years.  I just registered as a Democrat 9 months ago.  My disgust at what the Republican Party has become in the last 8 years convinced me I would likely never vote for another Republican in my life.  And really?  They used to get my vote more often than not.  I'll even admit to voting for Bush the first time around.    EDIT:  Gotta love the Clinton haters talking about scandal.  Never mind that those "scandals" were created in the minds of Republicans, who then spent millions of our tax dollars and couldn't prove a damn thing.  But they don't shrink from acting as though they did.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Every party is corrupted somehow, although it may not be transparent.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	If you were truly independent then you would have included the 8 years of scandals we had with clinton as well. your not fooling anyone.|`|mxXwQRfxaa	I'm pretty sure the term I have heard was that "Washington has a culture of corruption."

Given that if he had ever used any form of THC he would understand the state of consciousness induced from marijuana is far less mind altering than that of morphine. Now seriously put yourself in our Obama's shoes  and what can happen when you use pot regularly in adolescents, you rise to the ranks of an American president our commander and chief.  Well that could be nice but isnt necessarily true just because not every individual wants to be the president or have responsibilities of a president. We have to understand we are different individuals coming together uniting for reason and purpose. Maybe some Americans have a dream of getting the economy back on its feet faster than ever maybe those people are potheads. Just because you have smoked marijuana doesnt makes you lazy. In all odds you probably were lazy to begin with its not rocket science. Its kind of like we learn from our government if you come up with enough excuses than you don't have to reason. In reality not everyone wants to be the same in that we are unique. Well for all you nay sayers out there its pretty relevant that smoking marijuana doesnt make or take from the person you are or become. In fact it really doesnt matter we are all people. Not every war and battle has to be one by force; its through understanding ambitions and educating people to make a right choice.   P.S.   and it should be a fact by now that marijuana is far less addictive than nicotine and cigarettes. Given that Dr. Evil or Mr. Money hasnt studied up on addictive substances to put on his black market crop has been sprayed with nicotine or other various addictive substances. Think about the money we made or didnt just give away and waste by lining the mobsters pockets with money, which in return rewards bad people with supplies such as fire power, ammunition, more alcohol and unstoppable transportation. Also think about all the people who would rather smoke marijuana than some dirty old weed sprayed with odorous addictive unknown substances. Its not up to you its up to every American to accept people for who they and in return benefit from it I mean isnt that the great thing about humanity is acceptance of our differences.       it sucks that we pay taxes to train people to corner cancer patients looking for a form of releif. whos smarter the man pumped up on steroids equipped with a gun chasing wrinkly senor citizen cancer patients or the person who can visualize our own personal freedom... does  it really make them feel accomplished or are they taking it out on there own citizens cause there terrorists

So, they got what they voted for.  It's their fault.  They were deceived and mesmerized by a man who the media claimed to be the "messiah" but he's no Messiah.  People will get deceived easily if they are not abiding in Christ.  That's what it comes down to and that's the way it always was and always will be.|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	If you read the bill you'll see that only about 25% of the 882 Billion dollars actually goes to stimulus.    It's a total farce.|`|HWyhc5rdaa	I am totally ignorant at this point.  I keep just hitting the channel button on my remote when the subject is mentioned.  That said, I did see a clip of a speech/statement that Obama's opponent in the election said about our presidents plan.  We need to CUT taxes for the citizens and do more to help those that lost their jobs, income, and housing due to the current economy.  Rather than give big cooperation's tax breaks.  Maybe I am a bit bias in that respect.  I know a very delightful person whom is currently living out of her car.|`|Alkn6IJYaa	Why would you want opinions when you have no facts?    The tax and spending portion of the bill is of course passed by congress. They must approve it. Just like any other bill.    You say 'much of the document approves spending of 700+ billion that do nothing for the economy'. But you do not state which ones *do* do something for economy. Nor do you give a single example to show any of them do nothing for the economy. Nor do even bother outlining what the theory of a government stimulus is, as, for example, any high school student now knows who takes introductory economics.    I believe that there is 300 billion in tax cuts. How in the world are you against tax cuts? The tax cuts were put in at the urging of the Republicans who suggested they would support a stimulus bill if it had a lot of tax cuts. This fact proves that your statement 'much of' is false - 400 billion of 300 billion is near half and not what most people would consider 'much' - however subjective those adjectives are.    Second, the rest of the spending will be spent on people's incomes. Even if they didn't produce anything of value from that income - suppose they just dug holes and filled them in, that would increase spending and raise output according to the basic Econ 1 model, and help the economy.     Thirdly, let's take an example- the bill would spend a billion say on people to help other with AIDS, and much more on health care in general. Do you think improving people's health will not help the economy? How would it not?    Fourthly, I have seen people ridicule the 50 billion spent on science and technology. Is it necessary to point out that today's economy is nothing but science and technology? And if our economy is to improve it would by necessity need the most science and technology possible? That's what the Chinese government is doing, spending hundreds of billions on science, technology and engineering.  And although there are obviously long term consequences to science and technology, there are also short term consequences since that money goes directly as incomes to the science and technology sectors. A similar argument can be made for education.|`|7L8Q91KBaa	Are you for real? Have you not wondered what happened to tax payers money over the last 8 years? Bush cut funding for education, healthcare, and gave the wealthy big tax cuts. Where do you think all of this money went? Obama wouldn't have to create a stimulus package to jump start this economy again if the last President hadn't wasted away all of our money. This so call projects you mentioned in the stimulus actually do affect the economy. Are the average Americans getting the things that we need to keep us happy so that we can in turn go out and put our money back into the economy? Right now the answer is still no. Everyone is still holding on to every nickel we get. Giving us another stimulus check will not work either because all we will do is pay off a bill with it. Obama's stimulus will work. It's going to take time but it will work.|`|MHacPpHcaa	In it's present form it won't do anything good.I agree with you.Libs will say otherwise.|`|AA12071655	But I guess you were okay with the 342-page document called the Patriot Act that was rushed through Congress without debate and gave Bush the power to be a dictator? Did you question that? Or are you only questioning this because you don't like Obama?|`|lRmhwiYpaa	I am a Democrat but maybe I am just a little bit jaded     I think a lot of this stimulus money is going to lobbyist who helped    get Barack Obama elected to President of the United States.    The Union is asking for theirs UP FRONT and it looks like they will get  theirs by generous donations to Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors.    There is just too much PORK that is not going to created jobs and or  stimulate our very sick economy.    I know Democrats love to spend money but this bill is OBSCENE
A560oUeyaa	Note the source. Basically total BS. Sounds just like a Chavez election results.|`|kCwhs8Reaa	It is not Obama that is the problem ... I have said this many times before - if he can do HALF of what he preaches, the US will be better off. He has great focus and I truely believe he doesn't want to leave this country worse for the future; even if it is simply for his daughters.<br>  <br>  It is the half-brained democratic congress that is and will get in his way. He wants to get down to what really matters, but his fellow constituents will not let it happen without padding their personal programs.<br>  <br>  He made some very good points and it will help our country, but we are going to have to piss some people off high up that have been used to getting their way for far too long and put that emphasis on the middle and lower class of America.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Most republicans have nothing to show for their efforts. Jindal helped bring support to Obama. It is an embarrassment for most reps. to see these incapable people represent them.|`|gau0w8LMaa	You got us there.<br>  <br>  Maybe if Obama gives one of those speeches daily, it would turn the economy around on words alone.<br>  <br>  Words are cheep, actions matter. Telling America that we need to be fiscally responsible, while telling America we need to spend like drunken sailors really doesn't make sense. We cannot spend our way out of this recession, we cannot afford the social programs he is proposing, we cannot increase taxes on the rich in this economic environment. <br>  <br>  Also telling America for the last three weeks that we are in dire straights and that this is the worst thing since the depression, we are in for a catastrophe, and that things may never recover, has done more damage to the economy and markets that the actual recession has. Now we are supposed to believe that he has changed his mind and realized that the economy is not that bad and will come back stronger. <br>  <br>  Lastly 80% of Americans think the economy stinks. Yet 75% say that they are worried about others and are doing ok themselves. Figure that one out and you'll quickly get that the economy is not as bad as Obama and the media would have you believe.|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Of course it did, because he's a GREAT MAN, and an intelligent speaker, that's why the haters are coming out of the woodwork this morning.  Anytime someone great is attempting to do something great that THE MAJORITY agrees with, they'll always be that evil, villinous element that will try to cast doubt, suspicion and fear.   Its part of the natural balance in life.  The devil once did the same thing. There has to be a negative force, and they are it.  Not all of them, just the ignorant extremist who won't admit why they REALLY don't want Obama as president.  Read some of these answers.  When have you ever heard of any other president (especially a HAVARD LAW GRAD) refered to as a "thug"?   The bottom line is, cons CAN'T STAND the fact that they've lost, and their archaic and simple-minded thinking is becoming  increasingly more obsolete.  We've try it thier way for eight years, and look where its gotten us.  The people you hear from here are just the bitter few who come here to spew hate, institutionalized racism and right-winged extreme rhetoric because the internet has become a virtual breeding ground for unpopular opinion.  If it were popular, fear and racism would have won the election.  This country's changing for the better, most of us know it, but you can't have good without evil, so the negative forces will consisting scream louder and louder.  But in the end, WE WON, so it really doesn't matter.  Most of them watched the speech last night for the SOLE PURPOSE of having material to come here this morning (yet again) to b@tch about.  Obama could have said "I love dogs, and they would have accused him of beastiality...lol.

Entire neighborhoods are getting erased, babies, women, children, senior citizens, all.<br>  <br>  Before they were saying :"deaths are related to drugs", but now, they are so far in corruption (Government, Police and Society) that is too late to reverse the damage, their government lost the control a long time ago. <br>  <br>  Now, they're controlling Phoenix, AZ, "already known as second capital in kidnappings in the world, Mexico City is the first one. And history repeats itself again, "people saying kidnappings in Phoenix are related to drugs" .In the other hand the border police are fighting drugs dealers with pistols because the US government don't give them money to buy long guns, while this criminals and drug dealers has AK47 to fight back!!!<br>  <br>  We need to buy guns to protect our family, before the government declare illegal guns; because is a matter of time to all those criminals get in CA, AZ, NM, TX and God help us!!

I'm Hispanic, I came here legally with a visa, paid taxes, mortgage, car insurance, etc, now I'm a legal resident and I never felt racism against me. Why? maybe because I work.<br>  <br>  In our culture, in the latin culture, we don't have racism, EVERYBODY IS THE SAME, but nobody gets nothing for free, everybody is responsible for their actions, children, EVERYBODY HAS TO WORK TO PUT FOOD IN THE TABLE, etc. They are just jumping in RACIST WAGON, the same than the "Blacks or Afro-Americans"  used to get wherever they want, without judgments or responsibilities.<br>  <br>  When a latin or hispanic scream about racism against them, just ask them " Did you receive food stamps in your country?

SwKPJRNvaa	Absolutely.  Africa before empire was not wealthy, but it was not poor, and there were no slums  Europe came along, created cities and pulled them into the global economy in a way that made them naturally subsurvient.  Go to Africa, and due to the WTO, shops sell American rice- it undercuts the local markets and creates dependency.    NAFTA and EU dictate terms of trade, and African states can do little about it. If we let them self govern and remove the debt that we encouraged them to take, and stop pushing the IMF on them, they will grow.    They have had some vast civilisations, most of which were actively destroyed by Europe. If we let them , their amazing cultures will flourish once more.|`|Gax0IIvOaa	If they would quit squabbling among themselves and form a common union like Europe they could conceivably become a power.

What many of the citizens lack however, is common sense and the willingness to stop seeking handouts and start looking after themselves.  The Big Men of Africa and their lackeys also need to be removed, as does the culture of corruption and tribalism that pervades each nation.    Sierra Leone as a classic example, has had several civil wars, instigated by thugs from Liberia, Nigeria, Western countries and home grown citizens.  These conflicts were all about making money from the gold, diamond and bauxite reserves that Sierra Leone has.    When Africans wake up and see the damage they are doing to themselves through ignorance, stupidity and laziness, they will realise that the power to change and carve out a better existence is in their hands only.|`|bchNobJ4aa	Allow them to?

Africa is really poor in some part and does not have the money to be a powerful continent. Its really about how much money you have and how many alliances you have. America is rich and has many massive weapons. If Africa gets a lot of money then it depends on if Europe ans America want to give them the supplies they need to be successful. But mainly no it all about money and unfortunately most of Africa does not have it, but there are really rich places there.

UH1IMszXaa	No, because we have to live in the present day, not in the past.    No, because it is all about money, and reparations would end up being made to plenty of people who qualified but who don't need the money. Does Will Smith need it? Or Michelle Obama?    For the sake of argument, anyone of pure slave descent living in America today has a better quality of life, more money, a much higher life expectancy than if their ancestors had stayed in Africa (although tragically their ancestors had to suffer for them to get to this point). So what are they being "repaid" for?    If it's loss of opportunity, then let's start from birth and say let's pay up for every person of ANY colour  who wasn't born privileged because why should that child suffer because its dad was an alcoholic or its mum was sexually abused. Or rather, let's NOT because it would cost too much. Let's just improve education and healthcare for everyone, so the poorest and weakest can improve their lives.     Also, it makes no sense to repay because 'Afro-Americans know their ancestors suffered'. If I found out one of my great-great-grandmothers was raped and kidnapped by the great-great-grandfather of my friend, would I cry over it, maybe, but would I go asking my friend in 2009 for compensation? No, because it's not his fault personally and he had nothing to do with it, and even if he did, money would not help. Read Shakespeare who warns us on revisiting the sins of the father on the son.|`|Q5MRKWUvaa	I feel truthfully that its justified, no one can turn back the hands of time. No one can make what happen back then better, no amount of money, no amount of nothing, tangible, or intangible.     & im not mad that its like this, but some one out there said _what       doesn't kill you, can/will make you stronger.   African Americans walk this earth still last time I checked so we didn't just die.  They are totally human, they fought for their rights, no one said it would be easy   They didn't ask for sympathy back then, for there was none to give. They did without it then and they awesomely made it right for them. That's fine, that's life...............People everyday fight for what they believe is right.........RIGHT ?  So no I don't feel offended by the prospect of reparations  its not gonna heal these people by dishing out money.   & yes African Americans got to live in a free country.........but who said your ancestors were free..........Just because your are not that race does not mean for one second that your ancestors always walked a free will|`|4Vmlf902aa	I'm not offended by most things. So why should I be offended about that? I've got better, and more important things to worry about.|`|Alkn6IJYaa	Well, let me answer this in points:    1) Where reparations can be proven, they should be paid. This is in accordance with simple jurisprudence. The offending party is the US Government, who allowed for slavery, and was a party to it.    2)" Slavery is ancient history , terrible as it was " - is false. 1875 is not 'Ancient History'. Ancient History ends before the middle ages, around the turn of the first century.     3) As people rightly point out, reparations would have to exclude many blacks, including those who owned slaves, or those who came to the US after slavery, or whose ancestors were never slaves. But to recognize these things does not make reparations theoretically impossible.    4) "Descendants of blacks are better off than they would be if they stayed in Africa". That is false. If I cut off your left arm today, and gave you a million dollars tomorrow, that does not excuse the crime that was committed, the injury and costs sustained.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	How would you qualify who gets this money?

No one in my generation has ever been a slave.|`|0hQ2IXIVaa	I don't feel offended by it, but I don't feel that reparations are neccessary, or justified. Slavery was a long time ago, asking for reparations is just bringing old issues back.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I'm a mulatto so I don't know if I'd be on the receiving end or the paying end.

I don't want to have anything to do with this bill--paying or receiving.|`|f9oAVdH5aa	That'll be rich,since Obama's ancestors   owned slaves. Mine never did.|`|qWSle4i8aa	I think it is a great idea to pay all of the individuals that have been directly harmed by slavery reparations.That would be slaves or their immediate families.(son,daughter or wife)|`|Ar7swtCPaa	Reparations for what and to whom?? Slavery is ancient history , terrible as it was , but committed by like kind. There have been many give aways for them in the form of welfare giveaways, ACLU interference, job perks.  .etc... I have never nor has any of my ancestors owned or demeaned anyone in life so why am I to be held accountable??? Maybe they should take a good look at where they came from  which nowadays if American is America not Africa. If someone is holding you down in America, theres a darn good chance its yourself and the governments giveaways that make it comfortable to stay home for those that are just plain lazy.. This also pertains to many other cultures/ races...    Lets have some decent studies on improving life instead of crippling people with government repression.|`|AA11993638	Just because some people "assume" all whites were slave owners and all "blacks" are decedents from salves, which by the way is not true by any stretch of the imagination, does not mean they are owed anything. My ancestors come to the US legally decades after slavery, so I should have to pay someone who may have been a descendant of a slave owner, who what not in the US at that time? 100 years ago it may have been justifiable, but in current times there is no one alive who suffered directly from slavery, just as there is no one alive who has been born in this country who owned salves. I believe it is time for every one to move on from this issue and learn to depend on themselves for a change rather than a governmental hand out.

i5FP4Vbraa	Yes, it is possible to do jury service more than once.  A pal of mine got called up for jury service to a rather horrid murder case at the Old Bailey back in the 1970s.  The thing ran on for over a month.  Couple of months later he was called up again, same court another horrid murder.    So yes, afraid so.    But then on the other hand you could be like me and never ever have done jury service.

If you are both a registered voter and in possession of either a driver's license or at state ID card issued by the dept of motor vehicles, then the likelihood of you being summoned for jury duty at least once in your lifetime is extremely high.    If you are not known to either of those agencies, your chances are (virtually) zero.      And the only reason I even throw in the (virtually) is because there is that extremely unlikely, yet provided for by law, chance that you could be approached - as you're having lunch at a cafe near your local courthouse, for example - by a uniformed officer of the court and duly ordered to accompany him (or her) into the courthouse to potentially serve as a juror.    Also, if you belong to any of a few specific groups of people you will not ever serve on a jury for as long as you belong to those certain groups - although it's possible you could still receive a summons by mistake.  Those groups include convicted felons, law enforcement officers, attorneys, judges, and anyone subject to a custodianship.    I just finished serving on a jury today.  It was my 8th time being summoned.

AA10255776	How they run their business is up to them, not you. You may find it inconvenient that a business doesn't accept debit cards, but it's very costly for them to do so, therefore many don't.  For example, my electrician (who by the way is not a "foreigner") only accepts cash or checks. He's not cheating on his taxes, he just doesn't want to have to pay money to process charge or debit cards. Your assumption that these businesses are cheating on their taxes is just that, an assumption.  Your accusation that it's just "foreigners" who are tax cheats is ridiculous. For example, my ex-husband is a natural-born American citizen, is caucasian, and is a tax cheat-it's one of the reasons I divorced him. Then I reported him to the IRS. But then, I had more proof than someone being a foreigner who only accepts cash.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Don't shop there, that'll solve it.

Have we not done this to death already.  His birth certificate was both made public and certified authentic by the state of Hawaii.  His records are not "sealed".

Where was your head stuck then?|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	The speculation is that there is something Obama wishes to hide.<br>  <br>  he has not released his long-form birth certificate, only a "certificate of live birth," which Hawaiian residents could receive for children even if born outside of Hawaii.<br>  <br>  Also, Obama has not released his school or passport records.  There is speculation that he was adopted by his Indonesian stepfather and changed his sitizenship (he attended Indonesian schools, which were only open to Indonesian nationals) and may have taken advantage of programs for foreign students.<br>  <br>  Obama has reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting lawsuits compelling that these records be released, rather than unsealing the documents.<br>  <br>  One has to wonder why.<br>  <br>  There's a possibility he is not constitutionally eligible to be president.  But it appears certain that there is something in those records at variance with his public biography that would reflect poorly on his honesty, aside from any eligibility questions.<br>  <br>  PS  I would have hoped that the liberals who regularly accused Bush of "trampling the Constitution" would want to see it followed.  Apparently that is not the case.<br>  <br>  PPS  the State of Hawaii has NOT stated Obama was born there.  They have stated that they have a certificate on file.  That's all they said.  Does that mean he was born there?  I don't know.  Does that mean everything he claims about his birth is the truth?  Not at all.<br>  <br>  It costs about $20 to get a copy of this document.  Attorneys cost hundreds of dollars an hour.  Again, why fight these suits?  The suggestion that people have no right to see this type of information about their president is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  PPPS  the statute quoted below demonstrates that Obama would NOT be a natural-born citizen if not born in the US.  Obama's mother was 18 when he was born and would therefore NOT have been able to have spent five years after the age of 14 in the US.  Q.E.D.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	It was shown to those who needed to see it, that is, the election boards that certified him as a candidate. He is under no obligation to show it to anyone who decides they want to see it, just as you wouldn't have to show me your private documents just because I asked to see them. The idea that the CLB is somehow given by Hawaii to anyone, regardless of if they were born there, has not been substantiated by anybody who has made that claim. The CLB is clear that it is valid proof for any legal purpose, which means it is as good as a long-form birth certificate. In addition, the state of Hawaii has verified that it has his original birth certificate, and he was born there. His records are sealed because in Hawaii, everyone's records are sealed except for those who have a legal right to see them. He hasn't shown his long-form certificate because he has no reason to do so, and doing so would be giving in to the demands of people who have no right to be making those demands. Doing so would set a dangerous precedent.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Never give up do you?<br>  <br>  The State of Hawaii showed his real birth certificate on line, or maybe other idiots don't realize one when they see it.<br>  Obama even posted it online but that didn't do any good.<br>  Remember that Supreme Courts case....nowhere.<br>  Those dates by which he had to show it, like the end times the date kept getting moved but it had already been shown, proved, and its over.<br>  <br>  Very, very, very over|`|pYRZcfsJaa	Why do liberals continue to say that his real birth certificate is on-line?

AA12109395	IMO history has shown us that attempts to eradicate drugs and drug trafficking, whether it be here in the US or in foreign lands, has failed miserably and will continue to fail.<br>  <br>  When you combine the global ability to make an incredible amount of money with a worldwide insatiable appetite for illicit drugs, and add to that the corruption within our borders and throughout the world, you have a system destined for failure. As long as the "demand" is there, there will always be someone willing to take the risk to "supply"that "demand" because the financial rewards are so great.<br>  <br>  By "reducing the demand" whether it be through legislation or stategy, we make great strides toward reducing the amount of illicit drugs in this country. And this can ONLY be done by "reducing demand"<br>  <br>  With a reduction of customers (demand ), there would be less incentive (money) , thereby reducing the flow of  illicit drugs. Taking the monetary incentive out of the process along with aggressive action to identify corrupt officials and serious public education on detremental effects of illicit drugs on our society are not the total solution but a step in the right direction.<br>  <br>  In summary, yes , we need to change our legislative and strategic policies, to include our foreign policy with countries which have proven to be the source of the majority of the world's drugs.

kDj5zUXoaa	This is not for our infrastructure...  Much of economic stimulus plan seems aimed at minorities.    $16 Billion for Public Housing.  $6 Billion for low income home owners.  $120 Billion for public schools, with $41 Billion earmarked for specific districts.  $15.6 Billion for need based college scholarships (need-based = no whites allowed).  $87 Billion for medicaid (the fund that is broke from paying for illegal aliens).  $10 Billion for public transportation (you know the buses whites are afraid to get on).  $31 Billion to modernize public buildings (this worked so well in Detroit).  $2.9 Billion earmarked exclusively for American Indians.    We are told that $140 Billion is going to cut cuts. However by tax cuts they are including increasing the child tax credit. The child tax credit actually increases welfare spending. When a welfare queen with four kids pays no taxes all year and then gets a fat check from the IRS for $4,000, it is called a refund instead of more welfare. Even though the recipient paid $0 in taxes. So part of the $140 Billion in tax cuts is actually more welfare spending.    Obamas economic adviser Robert Reich demand that the money go to unskilled minorities, and that white males be left out. Reich has defended by his comments despite a public outrage.|`|Souvww0maa	It is because they hope the so-called-stimulus package will work and aid them in the 2010 mid-term elections.|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	Disassociate spending.

All Presidents wanted to pass some sort of infrastructure measure, but they were not successful because it does not provide an immediate benefit to the economy.  It is a long term stimulus, not a short term one.  This is because of contracts and plans have to be written, projects must be planned before any single person goes to work.    Much of the stimulus bill is infrastructure building that wont kick in until 2010 and beyond.  I would not be surprised if much of what Obama plans only starts to become reality around 2012 or 2013.|`|Zr0fShabaa	Even Pork Barrel projects have to be designed, bid, and awarded before they start making payrolls.

Em88Qn3Oaa	Here come some brutal honesty......    You should get a ticket! for that speed you will also lose you license.  I hope you get a ticket. If you dont youll probable be dead or in jail soon anyway.    If you kill somebody at that speed you will be charged with vehicular homicide. It is very immature to drive at such a high speed.     I hope you just turn your license in and take a bus before somebody has to bury a loved one. Ironic---- You could even hit one of your family members. Ive seen it happen.    Grow up and drive right or dont drive..... Nobody deserves you killing them because you drive like a retard!!!!!!!!|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Wow I'm surprised he didn't get you right then and there. You definately could have gotten wrecklkess driving for doing that many miles over the speed limit and chances are you would have lost your license. You can get a ticket in the mail from a photo radar or red light camera, but this wouldn't have happened if the cop was behind you. Unless there was one of these cameras in the area. Some say though that if you get a ticket in the mail that you don't have to pay it. I don't know if that is a myth or not. Just think that you got lucky this time. I'd slow down so you don't lose your license. That would suck!|`|uh2bkRrFaa	He can send you a ticket in the mail but rest assured he won't.

Hope this helps.|`|HzVE4kz1aa	the most important thing I can say here is you're going to die if you keep driving like that.  I've driven over a hundred myself, just for fun, but that was irresponsible and dangerous, and even so I did it in a straightaway after many years of driving experience, and I can still feel that the car starts to become volatile and unstable on the road.  Even fancy cars.  one false move and you're dead, actually worse, you'd have no legs.  How much of a bummer would that be, trying to get a hot girlfriend and you have no legs.  no sexual reproductive organ.  just a gimp.  all because you wanted to drive faster than the speed limit. Almost as bad, is taking out someone else, like a passenger, or some kid that runs out into the road.  Or some idiot decides to make an illegal u-turn while you're driving like a maniac.  you live with the guilt of that death or maiming for years.  In drivers Ed didn't they show you the cops talking about how every accident they investigate has dead or maimed bodies that weren't wearing their seatbelts or were drinking, or driving wildly.  Cars are the most common cause of death in this country aside from Cancer.|`|y1hfGpQlaa	You should be OK, though I'm not sure why the officer would go after a petty violation, when you could have easily killed someone going that fast.  As far as repercussions?  At that speed you would probably lose you license until 18-21 years of age and get plenty of community service.  Want some advice?    Slow the "f" down!  Anytime you drive a car that fast you are risking the lives of everyone around you, yourself included.  I know you are young and feel invincible, but one slip of the wheel, one car pulling out in front of you, one nail in the tire, could spoil your life forever.    I'm only 23, so it's not like I'm an old man or anything, but there is a time and place for that kind of reckless behavior (the company I work for is hosting a car-show / drag-racing event this weekend).  For your own sake, and the sake of those around you, please slow down.|`|3FU960cCaa	i see you going to prison for endangering others around you.  you are not only risking your life but innocent bystanders.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	Yes, and you should lose your car for a year|`|qII8YKCwaa	The cop probably did not catch you on radar and started following you for hope you would speed again. he had no proof saying you were going 60 over since his radar wasn't on. you got lucky.

Bush on Monday granted early prison releases to two former U.S. Border Patrol agents whose convictions for shooting a Mexican drug dealer fueled the national debate over illegal immigration.    Bush, responding to heavy pressure from Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike, commuted the prison sentences of Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean. The two guards from El Paso, Texas, each were sentenced to more than 10 years for the shooting, which they tried to cover up. They will be released within two months.|`|D8I3Brngaa	they weren't just doing their jobs.  what they did was clearly not in their job description and they tried to cover it up.  they did not even know the guy they shot was a drug dealer when they shot him, they just lucked out in a pr sense when it turned out he was.  if you have no problem with the agents shooting the man in this case, then you should have no problem with them shooting you in the butt next time you're down that way, they don't know you any better than they knew that guy.|`|l2MjVVpRaa	You're as well informed as Bozobama's staff.

gasquENMaa	Hello Tracey. Expungement has nothing whatsoever to do with the FBI. The poster who stated that does not understand the law nor how it works.     Expungement is state specific. That means each state can chose what is allowed to be expunged and what is not. You are correct in that only a first time conviction can be expunged. Being charged with 4 counts is not the issue. Just that you only dealt with one conviction.    Best advice ( although not the cheapest) would be to contact an attorney within the jurisdiction of the arrest/conviction. He can tell you if you qualify. If you do, he can also draw up your petition and submit it to the court in your behalf. A court appearance is not needed in this motion and you will be notified by mail.    Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you|`|AA11494150	Eligibility for expungement is determined by state law. You did not say where you were from.    The easiest thing to do would be to contact the court clerk where your conviction was entered.|`|AA12071655	Expungement of a criminal record goes through the FBI. You need to be asking your local field office these questions instead of millions of Yahoos who probably have no clue.

AA11494150	Most police officers wear body armor for small arms fire only, it will not stop a high powered rifle. This provides adequate protection for almost every situation your dad will encounter.     Body armor for rifle fire is available but it is very expensive, heavy, and uncomfortable to wear so it is not practical for everyday use.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	Heavy, rifle-resistant, body armour is not practical for police officers. It's hot, heavy, difficult to move in, and generally unnecessary. Most police officers wear light weight, flexible, body armour that is resistant to most handgun rounds and things they are most likely to encounter.|`|nY5shKkBaa	Most cops don't get shot at. They don't even draw there gun.  I would think the vests they have provided are good.|`|WYMCC1gUaa	Normal Standard Armored Vest is meant for small arm fire. and they shatter easily after 1 shot from a 9mm the are finished once it get's shot it starts to crack in the inside which isn't to good. and the Army Use's Kevlar Layers of it or Steel Plates with Kevlar but they keep comeing out with better stuff do you never can really tell but if a normal standard Vest got shot by a AK normally what crimnals use there would be a slight chance your dad will surive matters where shot at or Range from being shot. and most Cops dont even see action in their career or even more unlikey ever have to draw there gun and plan to use it.
uoBoo8ouaa	Having gone through MEPS in October of 2008, I can tell you that the waiting list for NF is approximately nine to ten months, as opposed to AECF, which is around two to three.  Additionally, I have spoken to a previous AECF who has just retired and hired on at a nuclear plant in western PA.  With that said, not going nuclear does not disqualify you from a civilian, high-paying nuclear job.      Please bear in mind that recruiters are trying to fill positions to meet their quotas.  I urge you to do what you want to do, and to stick to your convictions.  You are the one going through the training and deployments, not them.  Example:  I was told "no" for the Nuclear Field (despite having already qualified) when going through MEPS (I believe they wanted to enlist me to jump out of helicopters).  So, I called their bluff and walked out on them.  Sure enough, they came back and approved it.  Beware their smooth talk and go with what you want!     Hope this helps a little.       From a fellow DEP'er|`|n2Iywlvvaa	i am a DEPer in the nuc field and i have a brother that is finishing a school for a AECF FC and will be in the fleet in april. the best way to look at it is AECF you will be in school for like a year and for fc you would be working on the missels and such on anything form a friget to a carrier maybe even a sub and you will spend like 9 months in chicago for you A school. now on the other hand the nuc field is one of the highest paid in the navy like for instance my signing bonas is 25,000 dolors and my reenlistment bonases are up wards of 100,000 plus. for nucs you will be in school for almost 2 years so you would have to be ready for that, and for advance ment you make e-4 right after A school which is for like 4 to 6 months in you are also in school down outside of charleston, sc which is an add plus and you would either be stationed on a sub or a carrior.but either way you go your looking at alot of school and and good bonases and advance ment but after the navy your better off in the nuc field because of the skills you have in working with a nuclear reactor. hope this helps alittle

ghz5D5iLaa	Bergen-Belsen was a concentration located in Lower Saxony in northwestern Germany.  When it was first set up in 1940, it wasn’t meant to be a concentration camp.  It didn’t become a concentration camp until 1942.  Up until 1943, it was a camp for prisoners of war.  Then in March of 19 part of the camp became a recovery camp where sick prisoners from other camps around Germany were brought.  Anne Frank was brought to the recovery station at Bergen-Belsen.  The camp had 8 sections other than the recovery area.  There was prisoners camp, 2 women camps, a special camp, neutrals camp, a star camp, a Hungarian camp and a tent camp.  The prison camp was just for Jews.<br>   It was liberated on April 15, 1945 by the British. There were 13,000 people found dead and most of the survivors out of 47,000 were seriously ill.  When the British invaded the camp, most of the guards fled.  The ones who didn’t leave wore white arm bands symbolizing their surrender, then the remaining guards cut the water supply so it was difficult to treat the sick prisoners.  After leaving the camp, Britain burned it to the ground. Trying to get the survivors healthy, they were put on a diet that consisted of bully beef, skimmed milk and a Bengal famine mixture.  Most of the illnesses were Typhus, a kind of parasite that without treatment, it can be fatal.  Between June of 1943 and June of 1945, 50,000 people's lives were lost in just this one camp that was more lenient that others.<br>   Compared most of the other concentration camps in Germany, Belsen was considered a "privileged nature."  Bergen-Belsen also didn’t have any gas masks while other camps did.|`|dKq7DZkbaa	wow<br>  go to google and type in things like 'german nazis 1940', 'german concentration camps', 'Jews in camp bergen-belsen'.<br>  <br>  no one on here will have time to type it all, so do your own homework.|`|mCbChkKraa	That's impossible.|`|d056344a206c7d51bc2f1a5e8ea289d2aa	google would have been faster...|`|YbXSNgUOaa	Right-To much time.

AA11042590	I think that the republican party should be embarrassed of some of their recent choices. First they give us the worst president in modern day history, then they give us the power team of McCain/ Palin ticket (the Dumb and Dumber ticket), now Jindal, how the republicans found a redneck hindu is a mystery to me.

He's consistent in what he says and does, has a very calm demeanor, which shows he is confident in himself, thus making Americans feel confident in him.<br>  <br>  Everyone isn't having second thoughts about the stimulus. Only his opponents and perhaps a handful of Democrats. But if he's going to turn things around, he has to do it in a big way, which is what he's doing. When he succeeds, he'll be the American and world wide hero.<br>  <br>  We need some hero's in our life right now.

I guess they don't talk about them on Fox News, huh?<br>  Edit:  For those of you who've apparently had their heads up their asses, here's a link to the Gallup Poll website from last week showing that Obama's approval rating is at 67%.

Smart people vote for Obama...right?  How then could they be anything but? <br>  Anyway, he wasn't elected for his policies, or for what he was going to do.  He was elected because of what he was.  That hasn't changed.<br>  People are so emotionally invested in him, they can't deal with being wrong, so it doesn't really matter what he does...yet.  Over time, the damage he has wrought will become obvious to even those in the deepest denial.  Until then, it's just sad to see.|`|AA11423026	In the time of a crisis, everyone is looking for a little hope, however small that may be.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	LOL you need to look more often its down again today.<br>  <br>  And 60% isint skyrocketing, dreamland.<br>  <br>  For the record, bushes was still higher this same time|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Because he is not Bush.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	People like the direction he is taking...why else?|`|Jq5WK8caaa	Its not skyrocketing it is 8 points lower then Bush's was two months on the J O B.

He has only been President for a little over a month.  I also think we will have to wait and see if his stimulus bills work, if they don't his approval rating will most likely drop.  We will see come 2012 whether or not he has done any good. I'll probably vote for him again in 2012, but if him and the Dems in Congress(given their still in control) don't get us any significant improvements come 2016, I will be forced to vote Republican in the National Election.|`|P5zXRe9zaa	Because people are giving him a chance right now.

Bush had the honor of having the LOWEST approval rating of any President EVER in the last few months of his presidency. The man and his administration literally murdered the economy of America. And now he sits on his huge Texas ranch, collecting his  huge ex-president's pay. Not bad for being a war criminal and greedy bastard. <br>  Obama, has an extremely large task ahead of him and he will have many adversaries, but he will prevail and get this country up and running. Approval ratings are stupid anyway, the proof of what this President  will do will be a better economy, a health care system, cleaner air,  Guantamo Bay, getting our troops out of Iraq, listening to people who oppose him (something Bush NEVER did) for the common good of the people. He won by a landslide....so the people have spoken, now we have to have faith in this man and not follow idiots like Rush Limbagh and Hannity on Fox5, amongst others.|`|0eFSeap5aa	Morning of April 14, 1912 had you queried the passengers on board the Titanic they probably would have given the journey positive marks.

AA10079277	That's nothing compared to the cap and trade energy tax that's coming soon.  According to the White House that will nearly double all energy bills (electricity/gas/etc) for all, and it will not be limited to any one earning group.  All will be taxed the same.    <br>  <br>  Just think about your electric bill today.  Now double it.  That is a massive tax.  And we all have to eat it.  I am sure the $13 a week I will be getting soon will not cover it as my electricity bill is higher than $52 a month now.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Yep, with all of his proposals, taxes must be raised on the poor and middle class, its not humanly possibe for him to fulfill his promises without taxes being raised, unfortunately. Rich are only 2% of the population, so raising taxes on them wouldn't do much.|`|wdz5RMaeaa	I have twice heard now, ( we'll see) that the extra money we shall start seeing in our paychecks in April (how Frank Capra!!), will be taxed at the same rates as this year. <br>  <br>  That means it will be treated as added income to tax for 2009 and 2010. <br>  We will spend it and then be liable for more tax. <br>  <br>  HELLO?|`|aFC72tLZaa	He's cutting taxes for 95% of Americans, and will let the tax cuts for the wealthy expire.|`|ohgrMZDkaa	Yes, I can't think of a politician that has told the truth.|`|4Aauh87yaa	Obama is a liar.<br>  <br>  But we already knew that.|`|3uH441n3aa	Let's not forget-No earmarks too|`|RDL3wC62aa	of course he lied|`|Jq5WK8caaa	No he did not lie.  He campaigned on that very thing of raising the so called "rich" taxes.  Not to mention he has never said he would extend the Bush tax cuts, nor has his spending bill included any such measure. <br>  <br>  YES POOR PEOPLE WHO PAY INCOME TAXES ON THERE PAY CHECKS GUESS WHAT YOUR TAXES WILL GO UP AT LEAST 100 DOLLARS A MONTH.<br>  <br>  But that OK because he adjusted your tax withholding's by whole 52 dollars.  Oh wait you still owe it, that would mean on your taxes you would still owe 624 dollars, why isn't that about half the average income tax return size??? OH MY GOD he took you income tax return too.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	not just there he is proposing getting rid of charitable line item deductions.. who do you think benifits from the money so donated.. that would be the poor.. <br>  <br>  if you look at the amount of wealth in this country that those that make about 250k have it simply is not enough to cover the bills involved the burden will be felt by everyone.. not just the rest..<br>  <br>  but i believe most conservatives said this all along...|`|LCpOh9OCaa	His taxes plans are out of control.<br>  He has stated that his goal is to bankrupt the coal industry.<br>  <br>  He will tax this country into a Depression.

Cigarette taxes are to generate revenue but also to keep people from smoking as much, which is does achieve.|`|711R4J6saa	He promised transparency too.|`|VfBaveaJaa	he is a harvard graduate with a law degree does that answer your question.|`|GNOsGDK4aa	i guess|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	Everyone has a different definition of poor...   So, theoretically, Obama can never go back on that promise.|`|KOF2lcydaa	It's an indirect tax so it doesn't count against his pledge. <br>  (Think like a lawyer, that's what he is)<br>  <br>  Increasing the taxes on gasoline doesn't count as promise breaker either. Even through, EVERY ONE buys gas. <br>  <br>  So far he has technically kept his promise and not increased income taxes for people who make less then $250,000 a year.<br>  <br>  I didn't vote for him, but so far he is doing better than the elder Bush.<br>  Back in 1988 he was elected on the promise of: "Read my lips, no new taxes" He merely raised the existing ones. So he technically kept his promise too. <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, it's a sin tax. I smoke myself, and everyone including the government seems to want me to quit. I don't understand why the government wants smokers to quit. Tobacco is great source of tax revenue and if I die sooner I get less Social Security money.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	Yes, O baa ma, oh Great Ram Lamb, lead us to the processing plant of sedition. Tell us more lies and make us drink from the 'kool aid' fountain. Yea, thought I walk in freedom today, it will not last for you have prepared a place for all who defy your greatness. Our lives are meaningless and useless, except for the taxes we pay, so let us work more to pay higher fees so you may take it from us and lay it in offering to those too lazy to make it on their own. For your greatness shines to guide us from the fields of clover into the dark shadows of massive debt and servitude which will last into the next century and enslave our children. Oh Great Ram lamb, tax us more until we can give only our blood, for we are surely to be your servants all the days of our lives.<br>  .<br>  Yes, O baa ma lied as do all politicians as the attempt to get elected. They tell the things the public want to hear and then when in office proceed in their own direction, which is usually the opposite of what they promise.

I've got a great idea. Let's make the workers pay all the taxes. The government can just snag their entire pay check. We could then stop taxing businesses and their shareholders. Then everybody would have a job. <br>  <br>  MORE TEA, SIR????<br>  <br>  It's the Republican dream.|`|AA10079277	Bingo.  That is exactly why it is bad to increase taxes on savings and capital gains.  Doing this forces the wealthy to move their money off-shore to hide it.   <br>  <br>  When capital gains taxes are lower, they can afford to keep their money here and not hide it.  They are more likely to invest it in companies here in the US.   When taxes are high, the rich are not stupid, they move their money away and hide it.   When they do this, they cannot invest it here in new companies, because then it would be exposed.  This is a major inconvenience for them as well.|`|NtIOVAxkaa	Well , let me tell you that the Swiss are doing fine with the money the hyper rich , send them to avoid paying taxes.<br>  <br>  Is this a great country or what.<br>  <br>  I would like to see the list with the name , and Kill every single one of them.

cJZL83pLaa	Don't completely take the advice I give you but I think you can.<br>  <br>  XD I just started learning about law and we learned that private law governs relationships between individuals or individuals and organizations. And a small claims court is in private law, so I guess yes you can.<br>  <br>  But what would you sue them for? Rude, unrealiable, and misleading service?<br>  <br>  I didn't know that Shaw sucked that bad! At first I though Bell Canada was bad, but after using Rogers for cable, I found that they made everything difficult too. Every sales rep. always gives a different price range, but overall, I think Rogers is the fastest and most reliable service. I honestly don't like Bell. Their prices are more expensive too. <br>  <br>  P.S. I heard that Rogers lowered their prices a couple of months ago. Go to a nearby store to check.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd talk to someone who has more experience in law but not yet a lawyer. I heard that some of them are cunning. They might trick you of your money. Do you have a written contract? What about those recorded calls that the business says that they will use for future or educational purposes? Idk....yah. don't listen to me.|`|lxRYFGM7aa	Not worth it...You however can contact your Attorney General in Pennsylvania it is Tom Corbett they will look into your complaint and if it is warranted they will file suit for you.|`|482c3c164b9ceae77a848c4b02f2704eaa	You really need to have things in witting. As to sue, you need to show a wrong was done to you. You just can't sue someone because you're unhappy with the service. And without a contract, its your word against there's.
vIiUD5HCaa	Actually I heard that it's getting turned over to the Navy and Guam will take it's place. So it's like we're swapping.|`|AA10709853	if you mean on Okinawa:  NO.  what will happen is that the overall number of troops assigned there will diminish.
Tb91H3D9aa	It will not hinder you.  The Navy's only hard on those who can't quite seem to quit AFTER they join, but this shouldn't be a problem with you according to the situation you described.  Your honesty will certainly be appreciated, but know that you're not the first or the last to use drugs before their military career and your supervisors will be too busy with the job at hand to worry about your past.<br>  <br>  If it makes you feel any better, I went to basic training with people who had admitted to SELLING drugs prior to joining.  A joint will not close any doors for you (including jobs that require clearances, if you should seek that route).|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Nope, <br>  <br>  Experimental  Marijuana use will not effect you enlisting or getting a security clearance.|`|Ot7PJrddaa	Honesty is always the way to go - it won't hold you back and gets everything out in the open so you have nothing to worry about.|`|AA10829482	Most people have smoked pot; Just be honest. . .otherwise,  you'll have to keep up the lie for the rest of your career.<br>  <br>  One time  use will not keep you out.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	didn't hurt mine.. as long as it was a "experimental once" you can usually get a waiver with no problems at all <or at least you could when i got in>|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	Experimental smoking as a youth will not hinder you But any use after enrolment will see you in the military justice system where sentencing is very severe for all offenses|`|OhxDofcRaa	my daughter was  honest and it cost her a 32,000.00 enlistment bonus but she went to YDC  also  ...    so if i was you i'd keep that to myself|`|K8qAniReaa	Yes.  Drug use is an immediate disqualification.  You will have to ask for a waiver.  The Navy is giving out very few of these compared to the Army and Marines.  If you do get a waiver you will not get a security clearance.  The inability to get a clearance will severely restrict the jobs you can get during initial enlistment.  It will also limit the career opportunities you will have later on.  If there is a mission that will require Top Secret security clearance you will be passed over even if you are the best for the job because of past marijuana use.<br>  <br>  On the other hand lying about anything at MEPS is illegal and if you are caught during a background check they'll toss you out for fraudulent enlistment.|`|2CPHm501aa	You will have to ask for a waiver. <br>  <br>  You will be able to get a Secret clearance with no problem, however; If there is a reason that will require Top Secret security clearance they will look at you a little harder than others.  <br>  <br>  Don't be discouraged because the DIS investigators don't expect you to have been a Priest before joining.  What they will be looking for is a pattern of poor judgment and associations with people that you should not be with etc...Honesty is the best policy.|`|s1ZxSkQiaa	Just a few questions... What would happen if you didn't tell anyone? Would they ever know? Would it cause any problems down the road? Would you ever bring it up? <br>  <br>  Nothing. No. No. I would suggest no. <br>  <br>  Why put the recruiter threw extra hoops? If you didn't do it routinely then it isn't an issue. No permanent damage is done so why put it on paper? However if you do go down that road then stay on it. Don't lie to a recruiter and then admit at MEPS.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that your contacts on your security clearance follow your lead. Don't have one fool slip if you are keeping it out of your history.|`|tROFU72waa	There is absolutely no need in even bringing that to the attention of anyone.  According to MEPS, a one time usage will get you DQ'd for quite a few jobs in the Military.  You tried it once and that was ages ago.  Let it go dude, no need to even think about it anymore.|`|e8932dd7f5f83291627b66fa55917121aa	Just be honest. Tell your recruiters and theyll be able to get you a waiver if it was 3 years ago. I met a guy in my DEP program whos trying to be a SEAL and he used to be a total pothead, but he got a waiver and now hes good to go. You should be fine :)|`|tZqi3hwwaa	As long as you don't use it now and that you let him know that you did it 3 years ago, then everything should be fine.<br>  <br>  edit: Matter of fact, dont tell all of your business.

NO, it isn't one world government.

lxRYFGM7aa	Depends on what you are going to do with the information? If you are trying to prove something then you need evidence to back it up.
fgIbNRHfaa	It depends on what type of hearing is set.  Your attorney goes to represent you, but to replace you.  You are generally expected to appear.  Depending on the hearing, your attorney MAY be able to waive your appearance.  When in doubt, show up!  But your attorney should be able to tell you if you have to go or not.  Good luck!|`|AA12109395	You need to talk to your attorney.

4Aauh87yaa	They may not be anywhere near as popular as Rush, but I do listen to liberal talk shows. From where I live, I can pick up KGO 810 AM from San Francisco every night. The station is 90% liberal hosts (it IS from San Francisco after all), and they can be quite amusing.<br>  <br>  Clueless, but amusing.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	I would try, <br>  <br>  I always try to see what the oposition is saying, unlike dems who simply try to silence any opposition<br>  <br>  Yes i watch hannity, but i also watch hardball (For as long as i can stomach it)|`|wdz5RMaeaa	Great question, really.<br>  No, because most libs sense of humor is nasty and based on untrue statements. Not funny.<br>  <br>  Easy.|`|OnWmqs4paa	No, Air America has proved that...|`|Jq5WK8caaa	Yes, I would, but only if it is a true Democrat.  A person who is for individual freedom and the common man not the common good.  Al franken was never funny to me due to his socialist views.  Jim Cook (Fayeteville, NC) was a talk show radio host that was democrat, and I liked listening to him talk, he had some good ideas and solutions.  But I don't like the scary socialistic talk show host.  Rush makes me laugh, he is never serious except when he talks about how much he loves America and what he believe would be the best solution for America.|`|AA10083573	If the host was honest, respectful of a person's right to their opinion, and didn't use profanity to make people laugh, I might give it a try. It's unfortunate, but every time I try to talk to someone who's got an opposing viewpoint (politically speaking that is), all I get is anger. They cut down certain people's character, and just seem very angry. When I try to put my two cents in (respecting their viewpoint), they either get angrier, or try to stop the conversation altogether. How can I get any sensible information if all I get is anger? That's not how I approach the opposing viewpoint. I really want to know the answer, from the opposing viewpoint, but I get shot down. It's almost like they think I'm personally attacking them. I don't personally attack...I just want answers. How can I understand the other side if they won't quietly sit down and discuss why they think the way they do? That's what I'd want from a talk show host, no matter who they were. I liked Johnny Carson. He respected people, and most of the time, wasn't rude or crude. Dave Letterman, on the other hand, acts like a buffoon. He's rude, crude, and you don't know if he's joking or telling the truth. There's a fine line between getting to the truth, and leaving a person's dignity intact. I don't listen to Rush a whole lot either, as I've found him to be rude sometimes too. Plus he's not kept his life "dirt-free" either, so is limited in his credibility. Don't mean to step on anyone's toes here. I give him credit for standing up for what he believes, and is courageous enough to do it in public. That's something we all could do a little more of. Stand on our beliefs with no apologies. Get a little backbone in us. <*)))><|`|YsQQ30YJaa	If I wanted comedy I would go elsewhere. I listen to talk radio for facts and truth.|`|pGAUjHwvaa	Rush is not very funny.

If it is a noise complaint he has the right to ticket you but if he sees signs of drinking then he has a right to enter if no adults are present.  If he was called to the house because of suspicion of drinking then he has a right to enter.

vVTmJjJDaa	Japan - by leaps and bounds in every area: <br>  <br>  Japan is the second largest economy in the world, after the United States, at around US$4.5 trillion in terms of nominal GDP and third after the United States and China in terms of purchasing power parity. Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, telecommunications and construction are all major industries. Japan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the largest, leading and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronic equipment, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemicals, textiles and processed foods. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.<br>  <br>  Philippines: Lower-middle-income economy, Medium human development, Secondary Emerging market, G20 developing nations.  In a bid to further strengthen the Philippine economy, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo pledged to make the Philippines a developed country by 2020. As part of this goal, she instituted five economic "super regions" to concentrate on the economic strengths of various regions of the good Philippines, as well as the implementation of tax reforms, continued privatization of state assets, and the building-up of infrastructure in various areas of the Philippines.|`|f0bb213732f5c2ceb3db8c6b3def0573aa	Japan is a first world country.

9r9edyUbaa	Sorry but doubling the deficit, waging a war on prosperity by taxing the people who create jobs for Americans, and his carbon caps which will raise prices on energy for all including the poorest of Americans, Is plenty reason to want to see him fail to implement his plans. Wost of all this is ALL DURING A RECESSION!!  Now it doesn't take an expert economist to know that raising taxes during a recession will end bad, heck just ask Herbert Hoover. How about this for a stat, In just his first few months, he has spent more then any other president in history. I haven't even gone into his national healthcare plan yet or other parts of his wasteful budget. President Obama is wrecklessly spending away our futures in the name of the failed Keynesian economics.<br>  <br>  I'm all about giving people chances but I can't sit back as our President spends us into debt and depression like Japan witnessed in the 90s. We as a nation must expect more from our leaders, sitting back and letting him take the nation where it may is exactly what Obama wants to pass these damaging policies!There is a Constitution to abide by. Our Constitution was designed to prevent radical change and for you to ask me to let Obama experiment with policies that have been tried in other countries and are doomed for failure, and all for the simple reason of giving him a chance is ridiculous! All this being said, I understand that we will bounce back, but I want to be able to tell my grandchildren that I fought hard to preserve the American dream, not that I sat back and supported the guy who spent us into all that debt you're still paying.|`|BlPKoHEhaa	It is not that Reps want to see Obama fail because McCain did not win.

Newt Gingrich had rewritten the rules in 96 so that the democrats, even though they were in the minority, still had a voice in the house.<br>  <br>  Second, he allowed Pelosi and Reed put together a stimulus bill, that was basically a hodgepodge of things that the Democrats had been trying to pass for years, and without the opportunity for anybody to read the bill (700 pages in 11 hours overnight) signed into law, even after promising that he would post all bills on the internet for 48 hours before he signed them.<br>  <br>  Third, He promised to include Republicans in the discussion, in the guise of bipartisanship, only to be told that they lost, get over it.<br>  <br>  He has broken almost every promise he made.  <br>  <br>  He complained that spending was the problem, so spending will get us out right?<br>  <br>  Giving him a chance is over.

I don't believe socialism is his agenda or motive but i believe that it rings true when it comes to Universal health care. I supported Bush and I will support President Obama whether I agree with him or not. He's human and not God and he will make mistakes just like the other 42 or 43 presidents. The good book says to pray over those who rule or have authority over you which is our government. I will continue to pray for him.

I sure hope you don't join a particular branch just to be around pretty girls.  I think most people would tell you the military is not the place to find the most image-conscious ladies.

Labor unions were responsible for giving us the 5-day work week (used to be 6), the eight-hour work day (used to be 10), the lunch hour, and a host of other things many workers take for granted today.|`|fNBGSfnAaa	it a law for some businesses that employees get that time. but mostly it's just nice of your businesses boss

Hmmm, did I just make a case against a govt bail out?|`|tvNkizDraa	On the off chance this question is for real...<br>  Neither.  But you could help them work out a budget and to make payment arrangement with their creditors to help them get themselves out of debt.|`|AA12212403	Obama will do it for them, don't worry.<br>  Oh, he'll pay my mortgage off and fix all that is wrong.<br>  <br>  Actually, if this is a real question, my answer would be to keep them from starving but otherwise they should learn from their mistakes and suffer the consequences.<br>  That is what should be done for all in similar circumstances.  People need to learn and take responsibility.<br>  My husband's parents are millionaires.  Yet, we have struggled all through our married lives (25 years) and worry about money all the time.  They felt very strongly, and I commend them for it, that we must learn to stand on our own two feet.  One day, I suppose, their vast wealth might be ours, but in the meantime I worry and we save pennies, literally, to get by.  We struggle and we've learned the hard way.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	They need to spend less, and not live beyond their means. Tell them to not adapt themselves in the government policy of spending, borrowing, while putting US in debt!

I would help them out a little, just enough to make it each month but my children would have to do civics essays and projects that would help them learn in a loving manner that stresses strong conservative values.  All the government will do is teach social dependency, as a "Parent" you should not let the President preform your duty.  It is important to stress self reliance, hard work, moral standards and ingenuity to get what one desires.  Your child look to you for help, but the problem is they do not know how much help they need.  They are hurting themselves in life and to stand by and let them get bailed out by the Socialist would hurt you and them even more.  You have the chance to change there lives for the better and make a difference in there lives and possibly there friends lives too.  The government will only teach them those who have what they want are evil and they should not have it unless the government gives it to them.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Neither.  They made their bed, they should lay in it.  My brother is one of those people you describe.  Perfectly capable and intelligent, but makes horrible life decisions.  At 36 he has 5 children with 3 mothers, doesn't stay at a job more than two years despite having a master's degree and is still relying on my parents to help him survive.  Personally, I think he should be permitted to fail so that maybe he'll accept responsibility for his own life.  It'll be a rude awakening for him when our parents aren't around any more because I certainly won't be picking up the tab.<br>  <br>  Edit - I did give my brother a copy of Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover for Christmas last year.  I think he's still mad about it, but I think it's an awesome gift for anyone who's irresponsible if they're remotely willing to read it.|`|AA11209831	Let them do it.<br>  <br>  If you do it then they will learn nothing and go back into debt.<br>  <br>  If the government does it, then they will learn nothing and go back into debt.<br>  <br>  Kind of like how it works with banks, car companies and other corporations.|`|6645fec6d8799737e024f54f2e868937aa	If you are a good parent, you should let your adult children reap what they sow.

Nixon lied straight to the face of the American people, and I don't think he ever fully apologized for it. Clinton lied(though I don't think a BJ is "sexually relations" ) He at least later admitted it.<br>  <br>  Besides watergate Nixon did do a good job, but because his ego wouldn't let him admit his faults, than F' him.

JOXQrsw0aa	This should answer your question.....<br>  <br>  Q: I was told I am not physically qualified for the NROTC program, what can I do?<br>  A: You will not receive a NROTC scholarship unless you are found physically qualified for the NROTC program. It is imperative that you become physically qualified before commencement of classes. If you are attempting to gain a waiver for some disqualifying physical condition and you start classes at the university, you will be responsible for payment of tuition, fees and books for that semester. If you are later found physically qualified for a NROTC scholarship during that same semester (i.e. your waiver is granted), your tuition, fees and book expenses can be reimbursed (case by case basis). If you are found not physically qualified for the NROTC program, tuition, fees and book expenses will not be reimbursed. If you are not sure if you are physically qualified or if you need information on how to get a waiver, please contact NSTC or the recruiter who helped process your application.<br>  <a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/nrotc/faq.php#q2" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandiego.edu/nrotc/faq.php#q2</a><br>  Good Luck!
AA11401901	200k is not rich, not even close you socialists out there..they pay 36% fed tax right off the bat and the bama wants more of their money..thats not how to do things..wont help stimulate anything.|`|AA12245455	That's barely enough to start a small business?  Huh?  Many small business owners actually use loans.  Not that many owners are making 200k a year, especially right now. <br>  <br>  No, they aren't millionaires.  I'll give you that.  But, the average American family makes between  30,000 and 100,000.  No, 200kers aren't rich, but they aren't struggling, either.  There are single parents out there "earning" what they make.  A single mom can't survive right now on 30000 a year.  Gas, food, and children take up most of their money.  I don't think someone making 200k quite has that problem.  How are struggling families going to get back up?  Honey, if they fail, they are homeless.  Many of these working poor families are one check away from being on the streets.  How do they pick themselves up from that?<br>  <br>  People making 200k are going to get taxed more.  They are doctors, lawyers, etc.  Guess what, millionaires get to pay more in taxes.  They make more money.  How are you going to tax someone who is barely making it?  And, when your kid is going to school and isn't in the 12th grade with coloring books... when you're driving down the street and you don't wreck your car in a pot hole... when the firemen come to save your house... you'll know where that tax money went.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	There's a difference between high income and wealthy.  You have to make $200k a year for a long time to become wealthy.  <br>  <br>  And someone who is wealthy may not be making $200k (taxable) a year.  If they're smart, they make just enough from their tax-free bond ladders to cover their expenses for the year.<br>  <br>  That's probably why the poor and the wealthy are the ones who vote Democrat...neither pay taxes.|`|33b29bdd98f8d8d34167893336d47bfeaa	I don't. <br>  <br>  You don't pay tax on your gross in business or personal returns.

The way you grow the economy is by cutting corporate tax rates, not increase them and "spread the wealth around". Why are we so jealous of rich people. They provide the jobs, they start the companies that provide jobs. We can't tax the rich and give to the "poor" who sit on their butts and don't go out and get a job. We need to cut tax rates, and reopen free enterprise and capitalism, something Bush did.

0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	For one, there are not enough Republicans in the country for Bush to have been elected without registered Dems voting for him too. Two, Nixon got us out of Viet Nam and opened relations with China. Watergate was hardly the most egregious thing done by a president in recent history. Third, I will admit that I voted for Obama and I hope he makes positive changes in our nation. Next, you underestimate the power of executive order and ignore the actions of the recent presidency you claim is worst since Nixon: Ronald Reagan, Bush 41, Bill Clinton and Bush 43 all clearly demonstrated that a president does not have to be concerned with the constitution in order to get policies instituted. Furthermore, how do you know the holes in the ozone are the cause of global warming? Nobody can prove beyond a doubt that those holes are not supposed to be there. All that being said, a president who cannot motivate congress members of his own party to engage in the bipartisanship which he promised would be one of the hallmarks of his administration will be judged by history as a failure. He needs to get Pelosi and her ilk under control before 2010.|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	We're not acting.|`|6nS62bB8aa	Why are the Dumbocrats acting as though he were the best?<br>  <br>  You see, best and worst are opinions.<br>  <br>  But things like the stock market crashing, taxes going up, jobs being destroyed, these things are facts.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	six to eight months ago no one thought we would be in a SEVERE recession only a dip we could recover from<br>  <br>  now there is an estimated 20% chance of a depression to rival the 30's when unemployment hit 20+ percent... hmm what he IS doing isn't helping it is hurting|`|4zKmOkI4aa	because he is!|`|3a082722cea27ba378a88a859b07202daa	Most republicans are on some sort of trust fund and have been dating their sister to double the size of the endowment that they have received by another relative who is hoping that this will be the Republican to be the graduate from college. The whole party is from all known statistics not well educated. You can not get a myth to be universally accepted by anyone with an education. Most of the money is possessed by this portion of our society that has been aggrandized. They fear loosing money from taxation. They hold on to cash and the market falls which devalues the dollar when government prints more money to cover the lost tax revenue. They are going to loose value by evaporation. They keep the worthless money in their own family and loss in confidence drives the wealthy to more ingenious acts of investment that only a grade school-er could match.<br>  <br>  I am sure it offensive to attack wealth. I apologize for the rant but people have to see that the past eight years have got us where we are not the past month. Sure Obama has been spending money and with all he has given to the financial institutions they remain un accountable the bill doubled i size in the last three days and that was not democratic spending it was to get the three republicans to vote in favor of the bill.

He's printing more money because we can't borrow enough money for his spending causing inflation.

Do you want me to go on?|`|HfNralgnaa	He said that he wants to "spread the wealth".  That's socialism.  Have you not noticed how the government is taking control of banking in this country?  The federal government is getting bigger and bigger with each handout.  I'm sorry but the people of this country who work hard for what they have and actually have success are being penalized.  I would be in a better situation if I would have taken out a mortgage a few years ago that I couldn't pay.  I could have the government renegotiate the terms of my loan as opposed to what I have actually done.  I rented and saved my money until I could afford the loan that I am getting.  Shame on me for being responsible.  He's not the worst president (Carter) but he's enslaving the idiots of America by giving them money that we don't have.  Don't succeed in America, because you'll get your taxes raised.  Go out and spend money that you don't have, show up at a town hall meeting, and get a handout.  That's the message of change that he's delivering.  How dare anyone take the money that I earn and give it to someone who does nothing but have babies and sit at home on their butts.  That's like me taking points away from my students who study and giving them to the lazy kids who don't study and get 20's and 30's.

The bottom 40 percent pay no income taxes. The bottom 40 get most of the services.  The more you take away from those who have, the less they spend. The less they spend the less that goes into the economy. The less money that goes into the economy the greater the problems of unemployment etc. Even if your statement about the billionaires is correct, that is a huge amount of money. We don't like high taxes bc it takes money out of the economy and things fall apart. Those evil rich people stimulate the economy. Those awful people who own planes keep people in that industry employed. Those disgusting wealthy people who own many homes pay taxes on them. When they eat at "sinfully" expensive restaurants they are helping to employ not only those that wait on them but those who supply the restaurant. When the "corrupt" corporations go to Vegas, they help pay the cost of many different people. You take away their money and they won't be investing. The money the govt takes does not get invested. It gets handed out to those who do not do anything for the economy.|`|AA10079277	Your numbers are flawed.<br>  <br>  2% pay 60% of the taxes.  <br>  <br>  38% of income earning people, or 40 million, pay not a dime in taxes.<br>  <br>  Republicans don't have a problem with taxes, they just think everyone should pay their share.<br>  <br>  The second problem is that even if the tax rate on all those making above 250k was raised all the way up to 100%, meaning every dime they make was confiscated (they would starve of course), then the 3.8 million people making above 250k would end up sending in 1.3 trillion dollars.  (These are based on the latest IRS numbers, which are from two years ago).  So even if every dime they made was confiscated, Obama's budget is still 3 times that amount.<br>   <br>  Increasing it from 35% to 38% will hardly make a difference in the over take by the government, but it will piss-off those making the money and get them find places to hide it, and stop them from investing it.  As always happens, this will result in a lower total income for the government.<br>  <br>  It is common sense.  The more you have to pay for something, the less of it you will agree to pay.  Whether we like it or not, they will just hide it or stop investing it.<br>  <br>  The problem isn't on the tax side, it is that we are spending more than we have to spend.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	Because they work instead of collecting welfare.|`|O6nKcE9yaa	Because republicans don't understand that taxes are proportional to your income and it's so obvious.

Nor have you been particularly inclusive in discussing the issues.  One particular issue that is critical in this discussion is the fact that the illegal aliens are killing some six American Citizens for every one of the illegal aliens killed.  The illegal aliens are being killed in robberies, while the Americans are being killed while the illegal aliens are robbing.  <br>  <br>  This site.. all by itself, raises volumns of critical questions that you and your ilk refuse to address.  The fact that the Mexican Government is supporting such a staggering lobby effort is outragous.

f5058943507feef30be15c90091dab2eaa	I agree with stu and think He has a great name.  As for Limbaugh the Hutt, he is most accurate in Obama's idea.   The problem is Obama is basing his plan on Keynesian Economics, but he has no clue on the subject.   Making the country more efficient is the worse thing for Keynesian economics.   The Bases of Economics is to use government money to create more jobs.  If the government become more efficient , the Government will cause a lost of jobs.    Is it a bad thing, it can be a good thing in some cirucmstances and I agree with what George HW Bush did in trying to trim our military expenses.   But we are in a recession and the timing is bad.

Part 1 had to with stabilizing the banking industry, to keep it afloat so that it can lend money again.  This includes the bailout plan that Bush passed, but there may be future money placed in this area as well.  This part has little to do with jobs so much as keeping businesses getting the loans and credit to keep going.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A later part of the plan is to include helping homeowners stay in their homes.  This part of the plan is designed to stabilize the housing market, where it is believed the failing of the economy began.  This will be done through a combination of tax cuts to new homebuyers and a refinancing plan for homeowners who have had homes for a while but are in danger of losing their homes.  Again, this isn't so much jobs as it is designed to stabilize the economy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The 3rd plan is the one designed for jobs.  That is the stimulus plan.  Obama is working on having America made more efficient.  This includes having new roads built and old roads repaired.  This will save businesses greatly on expenses when they can find more efficient routes to ship their products (saving on gas for shipping their products), as well as save on not having to repair truck fleets that are being destroyed hitting potholes and such.<br>  <br>  It also includes building more Broadband Internet Access towers, which will make for better worker-to-worker, worker-to-business, business-to-worker, and business-to-business communication.  It also provides another avenue of sales for businesses through online sales.  All of this should help businesses to keep more of their money as well as make more, which allows them to hire more people.<br>  <br>  <br>  And someone has to build and repair roads, weatherize homes, etc.  This will create work for many people.  Not permanent jobs, but longterm work.  But how this helps is that it also means those people get paid.  They need things, and the only places available for them to get those things are American stores.  American stores owned by American businessmen and staffed by American staffs.<br>  <br>  Then those people get paid, and those businesses can hire more people.  Then those new hirees have money coming in now, and they can get the stuff they need.  They spend to get that stuff, which means even more profits for businesses, which means even more hiring for those businesses.  It also brings back investors, who now see a profit being made and want in on it.<br>  <br>  That money from investors, combined with money from new sales, allows businesses to hire even more people; who then spend even more money to get things they need and want.  Hopefully, your husband will be getting one of those jobs along the way, either in construction early or the newly created jobs later.

It is not up to the Government, nor should it be.  Neither should the Government force people to help.  <br>  <br>  The problem is, the poor will always be with us, and billions upon billions of dollars have been spent on programs to help the poor, but nothing is done to keep them from being poor, or helping them out of it somehow.  Working two shifts at McDonald's isn't going to help anyone, nor has working 16 hour days worked for prosperity.  <br>  <br>  We as Christians can only respect Obama as leader of this country.  For me, I can't support him, because his policies and everything are going to destroy this country and everything about it.  We can't spend our way out of debt, we can't give money to enemies, we can't bail everyone who screwed up, and have no business buying more house than they could afford, and I resent the fact that the money I earn that is taxed, is going towards things and projects that I know are wrong, such as abortion and carbon taxation.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	No one MUST support Obama, but I can promise you he is not Christian, no Government is, No State is, only people are ,and that is why our fathers drafted the Constitution the way they did; to leave the power in the peoples hands, not the government's, executive,  judicial or legislative branches.

Its supposed to be so that there is no difference in classes but this obviously doesn't work. You can see this in Cuba, Fidel Castro is a communist and the country is a disaster and completely poor<br>  <br>  In socialism the government only controls certain large buisnesses. For example: France is a socialist country - the health/medicine is controlled by the government (healthcare). This give every person the access to medicine, in this case it is good. In the US congress it is often debated whether the government should take control of healthcare so that everyone could have it.|`|tLARGcr9aa	The modern socialist movement had its origin largely in the working class movement of the late-19th century. In this period, the term "socialism" was first used in connection with European social critics who criticized capitalism and private property. For Karl Marx, who helped establish and define the modern socialist movement, socialism would be the socioeconomic system that arises after the proletarian revolution where the means of production are owned collectively. This society would then progress into communism. <br>  <br>  Communism is an ideology that seeks to establish a classless, stateless social organization based on common ownership of the means of production. It is usually considered a branch of the broader socialist movement that draws on the various political and intellectual movements that trace their origins back to the work of Karl Marx.|`|8d41beedea7b54aa494a0183d13589c0aa	Socialism is a mild form of communism where the government runs the country .

It is difficult to discern the true differences between socialism and communism, as various societies have tried different types of both systems in myriad forms, and many ideologues with different agendas have defined both systems in biased terms. Some main differences, however, can still be identified.<br>  <br>  One difference between socialism and communism is that socialism is mainly an economic system, while communism is both an economic and a political system. As an economic system, socialism seeks to manage the economy through deliberate and collective social control. Communism, however, seeks to manage both the economy and the society by ensuring that property is owned collectively and that control over the distribution of property is centralized in order to achieve both classlessness and statelessness. Both socialism and communism are similar in that they seek to prevent the ill effects that are sometimes produced by capitalism.<br>  <br>  Both socialism and communism are based on the principle that the goods and services produced in an economy should be owned publicly and controlled and planned by a centralized organization. However, socialism asserts that the distribution should take place according to the amount of individuals' production efforts, while communism asserts that that goods and services should be distributed among the populace according to individuals' needs.<br>  <br>  Another difference between socialism and communism is that communists assert that both capitalism and private ownership of means of production must be done away with as soon as possible in order to make sure a classless society, the communist ideal, is formed. Socialists, however, see capitalism as a possible part of the ideal state and believe that socialism can exist in a capitalist society. In fact, one of the ideas of socialism is that everyone within the society will benefit from capitalism as much as possible as long as the capitalism is controlled somehow by a centralized planning system.<br>  <br>  Finally, another difference between socialism and communism is centered on who controls the structure of economy. Where socialism generally aims to have as many people as possible influence how the economy works, communism seeks to concentrate that number into a smaller amount.|`|1amF7oNwaa	COMMUNISM IS THE ULTIMATE SOCIALIST SYSTEM.

But Socialism is a form of government which the Pilgrims first used.  Socialism focused on a community wealth where all the goods (anything of value/basic needs items) are collected to be distributed to the community according to ones own need.  Regardless of the work you have done.  This lead to the Native American Bail out known as thanksgiving.

TfPDFmE7aa	Not inevitable but probable. The republic gained it's independence through violent means and went through a period of violence afterwards. The republic didnt recognise the border and laid claim to the north for many years. A planned redrawing of the border never took place and on both sides the governments were more or less hostile or at leased biased in treatment of minorities.<br>  <br>  Having said all that, there always were large numbers on either side who were decent and fair and wanted nothing more than a decent life. Perhaps the same can be said about people in many of the world's other trouble spots.

It has to be an ACTUAL life!<br>  <br>  So if we are talking about a zygote, just freshly fertalized, clearly there is potential for human life, but it isn't a human yet.  Therefore abortion is just a matter of choice, at that phase.<br>  <br>  But many of the "Pro-Choice" folks want "abortion on demand" at all stages.  They want a woman 6 months pregnant to be able to end the pregnancy because she just split up with her boyfriend.<br>  But to end the pregnancy, you would clearly, in this case, have to end the life of a real baby!|`|ejluOCdTaa	You are exactly right.<br>  I don't know why unless they are trying to justify in their minds that a growing life form means nothing.

What, specifically, are you doing to care for the 3 million US children in foster care, and the 250 million children worldwide? <br>  Personally, I am pro-life.....but my personal choices and beliefs shouldn't determine policy for ALL people everywhere. The fact is, forcing women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term essentially guarantees that the majority of thos children will be unwanted, neglected, and/or abused. Once those children become wards of the state--as most of them do--YOU will pay for them until they are 18 years old--even if they are adopted....<br>  So, again, I ask you: What, specifically, are you willing to commit to...and what have you already  done thus far to care for all of the living unwanted children? I and my children have been called all sorts of names by the conservative, pro-lifers out there who don't approve of their tax dollars being spent to care for the millions of children who don't have parents who can care for them. How much of your check are you willing to fork over for millions more children??|`|de711i5Vaa	Just use common sense and safe sex and about 90 percent of abortions could be eliminated.

However, many times Seabees are sent to construct things in hostile areas before it is secured, so they may get ambushed/attacked by the enemy. I cannot tell you whether you wil receive a C.A.R (Combat Action Ribbon) as a Seabee or not; no one can tell you that.<br>  <br>  Currently, I do not think that you (as a Seabee) will see any combat in Iraq; most of the areas there are built up and secured.

Work comp pays you up to a percent depending on liability (if it was your fault, safety issue, etc) and whatever they figure out is ALL you will get and any lawyer will tell you there is nothing you can do about it. You cant sue if they are paying for the medical care, it is there way of saying "We will fix you up as best as we can" <br>  <br>  After your all "better" they will do a test and see how much movement, strength you lost and they come up with a calculation on how much they are going to pay you for "pain and suffering, plus loss of mobility"  It is way low so dont expect too much. I lost 40 percent movement in my thumb and only got 900 dollars.   So the ONLY advice i can give you is lie, lie, lie. If you dont feel pain, act like your in hell. If you get alot of movement dont show any of it. Its your best bet to get any money from the man. Believe me, i went through the same process and got screwed for it

But the ideal for the sake of which they die remains unrealized.  The eggs are broken, and habit of breaking them grows, but the omelet remains invisible.  <br>  <br>  …..the search for perfection does seem to me to be a recipe for bloodshed, no better even if it is demanded by the sincerest of idealist, the purest of heart.  No more rigorous moralist than Immanuel Kant has ever lived, but even he said, in moment of illumination, ‘Out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing was ever made.‘  To force people into the neat uniforms demanded by dogmatically believed-in schemes is almost always the road to inhumanity….no perfect solution is possible in human affairs, and any determined attempt to produce it is likely to lead to suffering, disillusionment and failure.<br>  <br>  The very idea of universal fulfillment presupposes that human beings ..seek the same essential goals, identical for all, at all times, everywhere.  For unless this is so Utopia cannot be Utopia, for then the perfect society will not perfectly satisfy everyone.<br>  <br>  (therefore to achieve a Utopia it is necessary to develop a frictionless society in which the differences between human beings must be as much as possible, eliminated, or at least reduced, and the multi-colored pattern of the variety of human temperaments, inclinations, and ideas,  brutally reduced to uniformity, pressed into a  straitjacket which hurts and maims and ends by crushing men into a perfect, static order.)

ABmZYbDZaa	You will get so many days to travel depends on the distance between your duty stations and HoR location. They will tell you how long it is when you go to the travel office to fill out your paperwork. You will be paid per diem and mileage but not gas (that is what the mileage is supposed to cover) Per diem is a set amount and it covers your food and lodging for that day. <br>  <br>  As per <a href="http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/perdiem/faqpcs.html#8" rel="nofollow">http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/perdiem...</a> PER DIEM FOR PCS (ETS Travel is the same) TRAVEL For travel by POC, per diem for the member is at the flat Standard CONUS rate ($109.00 as of 10/1/2007). Per diem for the member when travel is by commercial means is computed under ‘Lodgings-Plus’ at the rate for the new PDS or the rate for the delay point if the member stops overnight. Per diem for the dependents is 3/4 of the member's applicable rate for each dependent age 12 or older and 1/2 of the member's rate for each dependent under age 12.<br>  <br>  As per the same site one box down TRAVEL BY PRIVATELY OWNED CONVEYANCE (PCS) Standard $0.24/mile. Effective date 1 Jan 09<br>  <br>  I won't bother with TLE or DLA  because you live in the barracks and don't qualify for either of them.  Sorry if that comes across as rude but being that you're single and living in the barracks you won't have to live in lodging while awaiting housing and you won't be dishing out for deposits and that sort of thing which is what TLE and DLA is supposed to be used for.Also you are ETS'ing so that isn't an otion this time anyways. <br>  <br>  Also, You do NOT need to save receipts because it doesn't matter how much you spend you will NOT get more than the per diem and mileage for your PCS/ETS travel money basically if you go over what the Army gives you that 's on you and will come out of your pocket. You can either make money or loose money when PCSing/ETAing. It's all up to the Service Member and how they want to handle things. <br>  <br>  You can apply for advance travel pay and they will give you the mileage in advance along with a portion of the perdiem. It will NOT come with your regular pay. It is a SEPARATE deposit. It will come about 14-20 days after you put in the paperwork. You can apply for the advance travel no more than 30 days prior to your departure from the post. They will want copies of your orders and any leave papers you have. <br>  <br>  Know that the time you are on leave does NOT count towards your per diem or mileage and that it goes from your current duty station to the new duty station ONLY. Any additional mileage you drive is on you and will come out of your pocket.  <br>  <br>  Once you get to your HoR you will turn in your travel paperwork (there will be insructions on where to fax/mail it to) and they will pay you the remaining balance of your per diem. It will take anywhere from 30-45 days to get it.|`|0lhw1bJIaa	When you goto your pcf brief you will fill out your travel vouchers, and they will be added to your pay.

But if I'm driving and he's on then I'll listen for ten minutes or so. Rush always makes me laugh. But more than half his show is simply commercials, which I never listen to and would never patronize. What a fat and lazy bastard!<br>  <br>  Whenever Keith Olbermann shows Rush on "Countdown," I gag and then I scream with laughter. God he's ugly.

It is so expensive today with any health problem and the cost of medical care is out of control and the President has to somehow control the medical bills that are being paid by the government. Health care is a lot more important than silly emails. Emails are just silly everyday talking back and forth to friends and families but when it comes to Health Care that is one of the top money making business for companies.|`|0wHdmGszaa	OK. Back up a step.<br>  <br>  1. Bush's system - mandatory, without a warrant<br>      Obama's system - optional, you can still go private<br>  2. Just because the government funds the docs, doesn't mean that they have authority to see your records. There is still patient-doctor confidentiality.<br>  3. Even if Obama could see him, what the heck does "controlling" them mean? It's not like he is allowed to alter them.|`|yQgUcJ1Taa	Millions of Americans are driven into bankruptcy b/c of healthcare (even those who have health insurance).  <br>  <br>  As far as the warrentless wire taps, the government had the full capability to find suspected terrorists.

Even those capable of stringing a few coherent sentences together have are reflexively repulsed by facts, so there's little point. <br>  <br>  Case in point - I've probably posted 15 questions asking cons to provide facts backing up their claim that the New Deal failed. Predictably, they ignore the fact that the height of the New Deal coincided with the most rapid peacetime economic growth the US has seen before or since. The best they can come up with is pointing out the 1938 recession, which ensued after FDR began adopting more conservative policies. Soooo pathetic.|`|r6JskEtxaa	In your world, they are.

Trust me it will really suck to need it in an emergency and you're fumbling around with it.|`|d1FyCl6Yaa	Go to galls.com|`|T2WPvUc1aa	as ME said, go to galls.com. Pepper spray is under the category of enforcement gear, on the menu to the left side of their web page. When the Enforcement Gear page loads, use the drop down menu in the middle of the page to go to pepper spray. However, don't think that you will be safe just because you have pepper spray. Always be aware of your surroundings, and if you see someone suspicious be alert for possible trouble. Understand that pepper spray WILL burn an attacker's eyes, but will not necessarily stop the person from  attacking you further.  The pepper spray is made to give you a temporary advantage, in order to survive an attack, and it doesn't affect everyone the same. There are a few people who have no reaction to it, although this is pretty rare. I definitely recommend pepper spray. Just keep in mind that it can save you in a bad situation, but you still need to react and get away when you have those few extra seconds of advantage that it gives you. <br>  Also, be careful not to spray it into the wind, or you will spray yourself instead of your attacker.<br>  I know I'm making pepper spray sound bad, but it definitely is a valuable tool, that if used properly, could save your life in a bad situation. Most people who have been exposed to it before do not want to go through it again.<br>  <br>  Mystik has a really good idea too. Buy more than one so you can familiarize yourself with it.  If you practice with it you will be more prepared if a real world situation occurs where you need to use it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh look. Some little YA troll is giving us all thumbs down just for giving out some good advice. It's probably some little punk who would be the recipient of the pepper spray for trying to start trouble with someone in the real world. Or, more likely, some other punk who wouldn't have the guts to confront anyone in the real world.

He didn't commit a crime, he was unarmed and had just come from his bachelor party. It was the day before his wedding<br>  <br>  We all know of the story of the man getting shot 41 (I think) times for trying to pick up his wallet.<br>  <br>  A man here in Baltimore was killed by the cops, he was shot in the back as he was walking (NOT RUNNING) from the police. They had no cause to arrest the man. These were all black men but not one had an uzi.<br>  <br>  I know first hand how cops are I've never commited a crime besides watching a black market movie, but that never stopped cops from harrassing me, it's like if you're black and live in a certain area you're automatically a criminal. I can understand being particularly cautious as a police officer but these guys take things way too far. <br>  <br>  Oh and as far as my run ins with cops I've never been shot no, but I have been assaulted, and all I did was cross the street, there wasn't even any traffic so I broke no crime.<br>  <br>  Now for this incident I can't pass judgement I don't no the situation, man, I'll check up on it.<br>  <br>  Also, if cops didn't lie to protect eachother when an officer does wrong, like killing unarmed men, people would trust police more and wouldn't be so quick to harp on them in a situation like this. The reason is because we feel that, "hey they were honest about this why would they lie about that?" We need trust in our policemen and they need to be more honest when a cop does something wrong.|`|VVCpJFxtaa	A little more background info would be great.

However, there is also other pay that most soldiers receive. Most soldiers receive a substinence allowance which is around $200 or $300. Also, there is the BAH (housing if you live off post or if you have dependents that live off post), FSA (separation allowance if you have dependents that are not able to be with you where you are living; such as during Basic and AIT), and many others.

FKJaQXQLaa	Dont go open contract.  If you do, it will be up to the USMC as to what job you get.  Sure, your ASVAB will count some, but it will be where they need you that will decide your job.  You say you dont have much proficiency in mechanics or electronics, but they may just make you a truck mechanic anyway.  Open contract is just rolling the dice and seeing what you get.  If you really want to be infantry, tell them.  I find it hard to believe that there are no openings.  When I was in, we were never at full strength.  An 'Infantry Unit Leader' is another name for Platoon Commander.  That is an officers job.  If you want to be in charge of a unit, you must earn it like everyone else.  In the infantry, you start at the bottom and work you way up.  When I was in, I started as Ammo Man, then Gunner, then Team Leader and finally Squad Leader.  You need to learn your job and be damn good at it to move up.  <br>  My advice to you is to sit down with your recruiter and go over your ASVAB scores and see which jobs you qualify for.  You can check to see if your recruiter is lying to you by calling up another recruiter on the other side of town and asking him if you were to come in and sign up, if you can go infantry.  Dont give him your name because he will be able to get your info and talk to your recruiter.  Just tell him your first name.  Good luck, bro.|`|YRtnn6GSaa	why dont you just go open contract since you cant wait till september to go 0300 if going to bootcamp right know is that important but dont be suprised when you get some job like working at the chow hall or something like that|`|dSbAz63baa	"Infantry Unit Leader," - Going for open contract....priceless! : ) you sure are leader material.|`|C7wjR42Daa	Don't mess with an open contract unless it is all you can get.

Ua2A5TEvaa	Depends on how you look at it. gay right advocates say it violates the establishment cause which states that the government is prohibited from establishing religion. gay people are saying that the gov't is establishing a religion by not allowing them to marry by basing their beliefs on judeo-christianity. If you take a look at the constitution and the bibles 10 commandments you will see alot of similarities. Take a look yourself. Another arguement is equal protection (14th amend.) this law states that marriage is a fundamental right. (obviously not for gays though) since they are being denied. research it you will be surprised at what you find.|`|GHD8JicSaa	There a clear statement in the Constitution of the USA that anything not delegated to the federal government remains under the authority of the states.    Since marriage is one of those things not given to the federal government,  it remains under the control of the states.   <br>  <br>  The Majority of states have passed a law or amendment banning same sex marriage.   <br>  <br>  Also,  while the Constitution mentions many rights in the Bill of Rights and in subsequent Amendments,  none of them discuss marriage.   You have the right of free speech,  right to keep and bare arms,  right to assemble,  etc.  But no where does it say you have to right to marry whomever you want.    <br>  <br>  The Supreme Court would have to "legislate" a new right if they said gay marriage is OK.   I doubt with the justices we have on the court now, they would do that.   It would be a bad move on the part of the gays to push the issue to the court as it currently stands.  They need to wait until Obama appoints more liberal judges,  changing the nature of the court,  before they try to bring a gay marriage case to the court.|`|8P1yz9t0aa	No Marriage is a state by state thing.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	They would say that it is a state issue and not consider it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SFC<br>  US Army<br>  Retired|`|74f74357f1e97881285bef9af7de548faa	Which one of the 10 rights listed does it Violate?

It is one of the largest producer of gas and has one of the best missile systems in the world. It would not be easy to combat Iran. Iran might even defeat US because of US's engangement in War on Terror, Soldiers in Iraq. Russia might even make a smart move and take advantage and attack US because most of its military is enganged in war. War with Iran would result into a massive full-scale war.

7f1TfskEaa	What Ray said above.  Plus:<br>  Once a unit "mobilizes", they will report to their home station for 2-3 days, then move to a military base.  They will go through additional processing and training for 2-6 weeks before deploying overseas.<br>  <br>  Don't quit your job or take serious action until you actually receive the mobilization orders which are supposed to be more than 30 days prior to the report date.  Typically, you get a rumor 4-6 months out with actual orders 25-45 days in advance of the report date.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Usually the mobilization starts with a warning order about a year prior to the actual mobilization date.  They start a specific training list of individual tasks.  When mobilization comes, there is usually a 2-3 month train up on some individual but mostly collective tasks and then the deployment.  Based on when his unit last mobilized or when the unit that the used to be last mobilized, they should have a decent idea about when they should deploy.  If they said 2012... it should be 2012... but if they're saying they're are about to mobilize... it should be this year.  It's weird.  Talk to them more.
J4Q8ScRsaa	Hi Ron,<br>  You must be doing an essay for Juvenile Justice. <br>  <br>  There are many dispositions which is nothing more than a sentencing by a judge or a commissioner upon a juvenile delinquent appearing in the Juvenile Justice System. <br>  Dispositions can range from probation, to community services, to being placed in a foster home, therapy, and drug treatment. There are many forms of 'sentencing' for Juveniles and a judge may place more than one sentence upon a single offense (crime). <br>  <br>  Individuals may even be committed to the Department of Corrections. This means the juvenile is placed in a juvenile correctional facility or put on probation, a procedure of being closely watch and supervision of  the offender, which may follow incarceration. Probation after confinement (jailed) could include house arrest, in person contact with probation officers, drug testing, counseling and etc. It is usually up to the individual judge or commissioner on how harsh or lengthy the disposition is. A severe offense should incur a severe disposition, while a minor infraction may only mean a week of community service.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  LKT<br>  <br>  Here is a link for the State of Washington that lists certain dispositions for certain offenses committed:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sgc.wa.gov/PUBS/Juvenile/Juvenile_Disposition_Manual_2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgc.wa.gov/PUBS/Juvenile/Juve...</a>

xtcwWlUJaa	The answer is 40%. However, its actually worse than it looks. <br>  On first glance one could argue that since the congress is divided 60% democrat and 40% republican the blame should be equally distributed. However, the pork is distributed slightly different. There are a good number of republicans that did not put any earmarks in the bill  (roughly 1/3) VS only a few democrats with no earmarks. So if you do the math, there are almost twice the number of democrats involved in grabbing some pork (which is bad) but the much smaller number of republicans earmarks are 40% of the entire bill (this might be worse)<br>  The truth of it all is that we the people should be pretty disgusted with the entire process of pork paybacks and expensive constituent "gifts" that we refer to as "earmarks" It costs us all, and very very few will derive any benefit. President Obama should be ashamed for saying "there will be no earmarks" and then allowing this monstrosity to go thru congress.  if he actually signs it, it may be his undoing.<br>  One thing that isnt making much news either is that Obama as a senator has earmarks in this bill, but he recently had his name removed from his earmarks. he didnt remove the earmarks though, just his name from them. Pretty slimy huh?|`|AA11327381	there are gops that have earmarks  There's a guy from Mississippi, for example-  They need to be voted out and replaced with real conservatives.

Any government spending should be in its own stand alone bill and pass or fail on its own merits, not because it is hidden in a more necessary bill.|`|gZEn8k6Saa	40%|`|8diTOnNiaa	they said yesterday on the news the majority of earmarks was going to republican governors|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	That would be NONE since the didn't have any input.
teKeLxX2aa	That's a good question. <br>  <br>  Growing up past the JFK era I had always been told great things about JFK. For one thing, he served during WWII. When his patrol boat was destroyed by a Japanese vessel, he managed to swim one of his fellow shipmates to a nearby island and secure food and shelter for his crew until help arrived. For this he was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and rightfully so. <br>  <br>  However, having read up on his Presidency in a college class, he wasn't all that great of a President. The Bay of Pigs fiasco is an example as one of the more historical failures of Presidents in recent times. His foreign policies also increased US involvement in Vietnam substantially. When he was Inaugurated there were roughly 1000 US advisers in Vietnam, by the time he was killed that number had gone up to 16,000. People often speculate that the war wouldn't have escalated if Kennedy had stayed in office, however, many members of his cabinet argue otherwise. <br>  <br>  He is also commonly misinterpreted to have been a supporter of the Civil Rights movement. However, he had secretly attempted to stop the Civil Rights march on Washington, which is remembered for Martin Luther King's, "I have a dream speech". Using his brother, he tried to negotiate it taking place in another city, then having MLK speak last for only 10 minutes (neither one happened). Although he did support both instances of black students attending white schools (by using federal marshals and the National Guard). <br>  <br>  Having barely won the 1960 election, Kennedy was always at odds with the Republican Party to prove that he wasn't "soft on communism" which was many times worse than being labeled a "socialist" today. This played a large role in his foreign policies that could be labeled a failure today, and his economic policies have also been attributed to the financial difficulties our nation faced later on in the 70's. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, Kennedy did create the Navy Seals and the Peace Corps, and was also responsible for revamping the space race and getting a man on the moon before the turn of the decade. He did manage to avoid Nuclear War during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is considered a major success. <br>  <br>  When looking back at his Presidency, I don't consider him to be among the greatest Presidents of all time by any means. But he was a very well liked President by the people, and his untimely death was a historic tragedy. I think he deserves the silver dollar modeled after him, but most of those who consider Kennedy to have been a great President probably don't know all too much about what he did in his three years in office.|`|3a082722cea27ba378a88a859b07202daa	He had great plans and much of what President LB Johnson got credit for was in the works because of JFK. He was a visionary and did keep the nation safe in one of the worst times of history with the Cuban Missile crisis. Other than that he did not get much done and the reason was similar to what we are seeing today with the politics and out new president. Just watch the Republicans are making it out to look like they are fighting the "good" fight but we all see through it and all they can do is filibuster. The Republicans face being redundant with just a few whiners left. Maybe one of the other groups will rise to the top because Republicans are loosing favor. The only leadership they have is not even a politician he is a radio talk host.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	He was a war hero but ineffective as a president. He did begin the Peace Corps, however!|`|xHcQSLiVaa	Exactly!|`|bVbwbqtpaa	If nothing else he wrote Executive Order 11110 which was to federalize the Federal Reserve. This would have taken the control of America's currency out of the hands of the private elite. <br>   A few days later(and most likely because of this very piece of paper) he was executed.<br>   This one thing all by itself makes him a hero in my book!<br>   Had EO 11110 been enacted,  America would not be walking down the road of Communism as we are today.|`|4nWv0NRuaa	anyone who dies early gets to be considered great.|`|xo7Ea5fZaa	He lowered taxes, then he was assassinated.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	lets put a man on moon,<br>  and they did!<br>  many people love america for that|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Die by an assassins hand on US soil.|`|g3ZJcIWlaa	cut taxes across the board and the economy flourished|`|c1b8d1e146f67c24fce8487a20a072b9aa	He was good-looking and died young.

15d14297526cc4b7de3047298f94dabaaa	I hope not considering the President we have now.|`|9r9edyUbaa	No, but it really depends on how you define strong. Strong presidents as in ambitious presidents tend to trample over the constitution in an effort to advance their own agendas. Then again sometimes strong presidents are needed to make the tough decisions and go against the will of the people. If we look at a historical context, I would say we needed a stronger President when JFK was in office, but a less "strong" president in terms of Bush or FDR.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	Barry Obama makes Bush seem like a Rhodes scholar.|`|oLuFHJ0Yaa	Yes, since they need to lead the nation!

They're just saying a short little prayer for their food. <br>  What is happening to our country? The people who FOUNDED America were Christians, and now look. Kids aren't even allowed to quote scripture in papers, or even say a little short prayer. It used to be that in school children would say the Pledge of Allegiance and the Lord's Prayer every day. I know that teaching religion is going too far, but kids should be allowed to do what they want when it comes to praying for their food. I do that!<br>  What's happened? We might as well go back to segregation and all that. It's going AGAINST one of the amendments!

I think it's one thing to say that teachers can not discuss religious views with students but if a student brings it up in a paper, uses it as a quote, they should be able to. <br>  Weather its positively or negatively used it is, after all, a quote from a book...they would have to ban using quote from other religious books too then like the quaran and the book that the Buddhist's read from (i forget what it is). <br>  I hate it when people single out Christianity...other religions are similar but because Christians make a bigger "roar" in America when we talk about religion they single them out. <br>  This country was built on Christianity, if people want to follow they can if they don't they don't have to I just wish people would realize it. <br>  <br>  Sorry to get off topic- just a personal opinion|`|uAAwgeI2aa	FIRST of all, <br>  quoting scripture technically isn't promoting a religion. scripture consists of literature.

I'm not a hardcore atheist who thinks anybody who believes in God is a fool, but I don't believe in a God myself. At least not in a God who is at all human like.<br>  <br>  That being said, I think that this legislation is anti-American and anti-intellectual on several different levels. Many scholars quote the Bible and other religious works. I know scientists who include religious quotes on the dedication pages of their theses. Many works of classic literature are centered around religion. How could one write about Dante's Inferno, or Milton's Paradise Lost, or T.S Eliot's The Wasteland without referencing the Bible. Furthermore, Religious studies are a legitimate academic pursuit. Many Universities have departments dedicated to it. I certainly hope the Maryland Legislature has the good sense to scuttle this nonsense before the courts do it for them.<br>  <br>  Public schools are not allowed to endorse a specific religion. But the idea that Religion in general is off limits and that personal expressions of religious conviction are prohibited is offensive and unconstitutional.|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	I don't think kids should be able to quote scripture for class projects -- essays, etc,  -- not because of politics,  but because if they consider it the final authority on every question, they'll never learn anything else.

Y4wQsBuUaa	That is kinda confusing, but I would say that the mentor is just trying to be patient with the obviously troubled person. If the troubled person started abusing the mentor then it was in the mentor's best interest to remove themselves from the situation. However the mentor probably still had emotional attachment to the patient and wouldn't want to hurt them further by pressing any harassment charges. They probably could, but it doesn't seem like they will since the person is troubled and lashing out.<br>  Thats just my guess

And I can't find any place where he did.<br>  <br>  Obama's health care plan is very similar to Bill Clinton's plan and GHW Bush's plan before that.  It has the govt. buying health insurance from the existing health insurance companies at their going rate.  That is certainly not -socialized medicine-, and it's NOTHING like the NHS.<br>  <br>  Now, my question is this.  If conservatives have good reason to oppose that plan, and they're not just reflexively criticizing anything Obama does, then why do they have to lie about Obama's plan to make it easier to criticize?<br>  <br>  If I said that Michael Steele was unfit to be the chairman of the GOP because he is a registered kleptomaniac and he has Downs Syndrome, and you knew those things were not true, would that make you more or less likely to listen to what I had to say?

Conservatism (the capital C kind) is exactly what you've stated, but it has been altered thanks to the neo-cons and the religious right.

Especially if its because of a bad deed as i see animals as innocents and believe they cant hold blame. ie If you teach your dog to attack and then it does how is that the dogs fault? but i also think its wrong even if your pet is sick and old. which can be seen as bad.I think it messes with the natural order of life and death. when its your time to die you will and i would rather be with my pet in our home where she is comfortable and unafraid than taking her on a trip to the vet to die. seems so morbid to me.|`|Uaoep16Qaa	of course, it is your human right to have total contorl over your body, the state shouldn't have control over you|`|KcAehrrKaa	If it works, and it's painless, why not?|`|QMzsM2fkaa	I think it's someone's own personal decision.  If they're suffering an inumerable amount of pain and their death is inevitable then it's their choice.|`|UgFntgI9aa	Heck yeah.  <br>  <br>  And if you're ever flat on your back in excruciating pain with some god awful form of terminal cancer you might come to think it's ok too. <br>  <br>  It should be decided strictly between the patient and the doctor.  And the relatives only if the patient is no longer conscious.|`|d8aF6Tz2aa	It's a good idea for the terminally ill and in pain, but doctors should not be associated with it, because doctors should heal you not kill you|`|A9fYsjmyaa	It should be a right. I believe that if your on the brink of death with cancer or something to that extent, you should be able to be euthanized. Who's right is it to make you suffer when you know your dying in a couple of hours, etc?<br>  <br>  the trouble is, who decides what is the "brink of death". I think if your fully conscious making the decision and of sound mind, it should be your choice. So long as your dying and you cannot be helped other wise.<br>  <br>  I'm for it, but their are too many what ifs with it. For me to fully see it happening, there would have to be a lot of things thought into it.<br>  <br>  I debated this topic in my Allied Health class a long time ago, haha. I have strong feelings about this subject so I'm sorry if I sound a little angsty.
o9dMd2rBaa	Army Reserve is part of the Federal Army<br>  <br>  National Guard is concurrently State and Federal. <br>  <br>  National Guard has all the same jobs available as active duty, including special forces. Army Reserve only has the combat support (ex. Military Police) and service support jobs (ex. Quartermaster) and so no combat arms (ex. Infantry)<br>  <br>  It's also easier to move from one state to state to another if you are in Reserves, since its easier to transfer units, NG wants to hold on you to since its the state money paying for a lot of your training|`|xugO6cDsaa	Reserves are federal, Guard is state.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	raised is dead on about everything, except that if you're in the Guard and you are moving more than 50 miles away from your unit or out of state, they are obligated to release you to transfer due to commute regardless of how bad they want to keep you.  If you voluntarily joined a unit greater than 50 miles commuting then you can't use that as an excuse to get out of the unit/state unless you move even farther away.
j89eDgTuaa	Which one would you enjoy more? Don't let the alternatives you 'read on the internet' fool you. Choose according to yourself or you'll never fully be sure. Not to be all philosophical or anything, but that's the true reality of it. Screw it I say Air Force.|`|C1fBdw95aa	I'm no expert on this by any means, but to my knowledge, MP is more of a police role and SF is more along the lines of guarding bases.|`|ae7b10671a422ce6d8862d25933e224caa	I have just returned from deployment in Kirkuk Air Base in Iraq, the difference in what the Army MPs and the Air Force SF is the fact that MPs do more outside the wire missions than the SF. My father is an Army MP and has been for 20 years, they have worse than the SF in most cases. Security Forces is the way to go if you would like stay inside the wire, the MPs have sustained more casualties in OIF and OEF than SF has, SF has only had 5 members die in both wars total. No matter what branch that you choose the training that you receive will be up to par, this i know for a fact from both my experience and my father's. Also another thing to consider in your decision is the fact that as of now SF deployments are usually only 6 months, while MP deployments are 12 and up. Also as the last reply to your question has added you can earn your associates degree through the community college of the Air Force.|`|ZdjfGjzIaa	There a few differences between SF and MPs.  SFs deals with guarding planes, bases, "priority resources" as well as serve as Law Enforcement functions.  They are also tasked to do traditional Army MP type duties in deployed areas.  Now the biggest question is quality of life...basically, after you're done with work for the days, do you want to return to a nice dorm or have better possibilty being able to live off base?  Air Force mess hall and gym are much better.  Also, you're have better chance to attend college while in AF than Army.|`|ZTiJeGlxaa	The choice is ultimately up to you! What didn't you like about SF? Was it that we deploy to forward locations? Army does to for longer.  The choice here is bigger than SF or MP.  It's really army or AF.   <br>  <br>  Both of them you are going to deploy to forward locations, and both of them you are going to have to act in combat roles.  In SF the AF has options of what you are going to do.  you are going to guard planes, guard missiles or components of them,  do joint missions with the army, or law enforcement.  As a Junior enlisted in the AF you really have nothing and can do nothing.  but the same is expected in the Army.  I'm not sure what the missions for the Army MP's are.  I do know though that in the army, you are a soldier first.  SF does suck if you get stuck at a crappy base, <br>  <br>  If you listen to no other advice, listen to this: the military will get their full use out of you.  there's a so many options and benefits that get overlooked because someone is unhappy.  Just make your choice and go with it.  and in the air force.  there's an old saying: "If you don't like it, give it a while it will change.  If you do like it too bad, it's going to change" <br>  <br>  good luck with your decision.|`|Zr8pO7AEaa	Go AF all the way. They really take care of their people. There bases are amazing compared to the other services. That's of course just my personal opinion. Good Luck

iWLeHnlnaa	Only if they hang around Yahoo answer's immigration section where all the narrow minded Americans seem to be.|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	Pressured to change and mold? They are spanish TV stations and Radio stations, bilingual ads in papers and magazines. Gov forms are bilingual. Press #1 for english. English Language Classes in schools that are now even teaching adults. Where is the pressure?|`|QA48ogeEaa	No, many immigrants come here because we offer excellent benefits (jobs, free healthcare in E.R.s, free education, and multiple cash handouts) They have no intention of contributing to our economy or society. This is evidenced by their lack of assimilation. Many do not become self-sufficient and remain on government assistance for years after their arrival. Many do not learn to speak English, this is extremely expensive to our healthcare and educational systems as non-English speakers require interpreters and providing services takes much longer due to the language barrier. Many still proudly display the flags of their country of origin on their homes and cars. Many immigrants further damage our economy by shipping money abroad, this money leaves our nation forever and is not spent here over and over again providing jobs to our citizens. Take California as a case study in the effect of immigrants on an economy. In short no immigrants do not feel pressured to become Americans, they are quite comfortable being foreign nationals with American benefits.|`|vet4adaYaa	No, but out of respect for the nation, they should assimilate and learn our de facto national language. Sadly, many immigrants come to the U.S and expect America and Americans to mold and cater to their culture and then complain when it doesn't' happen.|`|4xpXoG5Oaa	I think that many of them are pressured. As an American, I will say, I have my own personality and I don't  change to please anybody. I follow laws and behave properly but changing my personality to please others, no way.|`|49985cf959d1e0d14ae352838b416831aa	I think it's immigrants duty to learn and love their adopted country...If you don't want to learn and become a part of it.  What's the point of immigrating there anyway??|`|UiUPOA0laa	Heck no! The illegals come over and try to change the U.S. citizens!
Iyvt7ibmaa	It's not illegal because even though Alaina and Rachel said they would cover Lisa's shifts, it's still Lisa's shift that was supposed to be covered. The proper way this should have been handled was for all of them to go to the Manager and explain to the manager that Lisa couldn't work and Alaina and Rachel would swap shifts at 11. Since no one notified the manager, the manager only has to assume that, since the shift was in Lisa's name, it's her fault she didn't show up. It was Lisa's responsibility to figure all of this out, and it was her responsibility that it didn't work and affected the business. It sucks, but that's what happens. <br>  :/ sorry|`|tTOPb5cVaa	Well, she was suppose to be there during that time right? Although the other woman said she was going to cover her shift its still your friends responsibility to make sure it was covered or she is responsible for going in. I know it isn't fair but life isn't fair. And her boss is a jacka**|`|bhc7HuN9aa	I would fire her for crap like that!|`|zqPjdhgKaa	No it is not illegal for several reasons.  Even though she got her shift covered by the other people, it was still her responsibility to make sure that person came in.  If that person didn't come in, Lisa is still responsible for her shift.  That is how business works, no matter where you go.<br>  <br>  Secondly, she was employed at an at-will employer, which means she can be hired or fired for any reason the employer sees fit as long as it is not a protected discrimination class, and this is not the case for your friend.  Your friend was legally fired.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	no it is not..... <br>  <br>  she left a shop closed when it should be opened... that is undeniably a termination offense.. there are no laws for how the owner/manager has to fire someone.. the manager should have had more guts and done it himself but he doesn't have to.<br>  <br>  now there may be laws about having to pay her a certain number of hours if when she showed up she was scheduled but you make it sound like she just showed up when not scheduled for coffee.. if so they don't owe her anything at all.

I see both Democrats and Republicans constantly at each others throats.  From where I sit, I see the Democrats attacking Republicans more than the other way around.  What they did to Bush for 8 years is unforgivable.  I did not like Bush's policies at all, but the vitriol from the left was beyond anything ever seen before.  What is worse, is they kept it up, even when they won and gained control of the congress in 2006.  Why didn't they just shut up and do what they were sent there to do.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Are you just stupid, or what?<br>  <br>  Liberals are the nastiest, most violent, most intolerant and most hateful people in America, and you think conservatives can't play nice?|`|xu3GCouraa	If you honestly think that liberals play nicer than conservatives then you obviously weren't watching the news during the election or during the bush administration.|`|BsQcplTQaa	We have the right to disagree, even with each other.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	Nationalists, Conservatives, Right Wing Extremists do not believe in hugs or love or getting along with others who may have differing views.<br>  <br>  They are the ones that throughout history have caused wars, suffering, Recessions, Depressions and Genocide.  <br>  <br>  They will never get along with anyone and we must always be wary of their motives.|`|3DOQG6hEaa	I used to play nice, when I first came here... then I got suspended a couple of times by neocon reporting crybabies when I was posting rational and contained debate against the slander on here... now I post rationally still, but being civil to these losers is a dead-end street... it will never be reciprocated.<br>  <br>  Glad to see Liberal Asskicker (the first clue that he is a very intelligent and civil guy, what a name) set the record straight for you...

XO6HBgtXaa	I also applied to this years summer seminar and am still awaiting me acceptance. One thing is for certain, congressman who are responsible for giving us our nomination this fall really like to see that we've taken the initiative to visit the academy and see what the atmosphere of the academy is really like. The Air Force Academy admissions panel also looks highly upon you if you've attended the summer seminar.<br>  <br>  During the five days that you will be staying at the academy you will be constantly evaluated on how you perform throughout the week. You will have an evaluation put into your file that will be review during the addmissions process.  So make sure that you give them the absolute best impression that you can. Becuase this is one of the only opportunities for you to really show the academy who you are and how bad you want an Air Force career that includes the academy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! I hope to see you there|`|5uRHcVnXaa	I would think so, and congratulations!! I am a couple of years behind right now
c48198ba07699817fc902d874cd0ef75aa	USMC will try to sucker you in by saying they're the most disciplined and not offer you any money. that's all fine and dandy if you're in it for pride. Currently many MOS's are filled so the options of choosing your job will be slim to none and no money. No one really should join this branch if they aren't in to physical and mental challenges. If you're in shape you can be expected to make fast promotions. boot camp is the longest and most challenging. challenging things aren't always a good thing... you get a choice of being stationed either japan, cali, or nc. most you deploy is 6 months.<br>  <br>  The Army will offer you money, they let almost anybody in... They aren't as physically in shape as the marines, but you get more variety in what kind of job you want to have. Experience can nail you a nice job when you get out in a field you like. easy promotions. bootcamp is weak you get to get stationed in either guam, germany, s korea or any major army base in any us state. army usually deploys for 18 months. deploying is a good thing. it means more money!!!<br>  <br>  If you want to live in a ship for at least 6 months of your 4 years and want to keep track of a ton of uniforms joins them. it is very hard to get promoted in this service but job variety is there. enlistment bonus isn't as good as the armys... they do deploy and support marines.<br>  <br>  National guard is a border patrol job. lol. if you wanna help out for katrina disasters or earthquakes this is the job. the coast guard is stationed near the water. florida, cali, texas, oregon, ny, where ever the coastline is you're able to get stationed. <br>  <br>  I'm surprised you left out the air force. <br>  they have the best everything.<br>  they have the technical jobs that can make you the most money when you get out. you can get stationed pretty much anywhere.<br>  they are the chillest of the branches.<br>  <br>  remember they all pay the same, bonuses vary, and you get the same amount of leave days every where. if you want to work the hardest go marine corps. if you wanna chill your 4 years go air force.<br>  <br>  hope this helps...|`|P3s3UIlcaa	green berets|`|xkeSwj3Naa	Air Force.|`|C3qh54lgaa	I was always told by different people in the military, that the Air Force was the way to go.  The way I hear it, they take better care of you and your not in the middle of all the violence the way you are in the Army, or Marines.  I have friends from all military branches. <br>  I guess itt all boils down to what it is your looking for in the long run as far as training and education.  Just like different colleges, the armed forces offer different things.|`|ebf347ddf889d022aac6e9cb92553dacaa	When trying to decide what branch of military to join you need to think about what you are looking for.  For example, I joined the U.S. Marine Corps because of the reputation.  I'm not saying anything bad about the other branches, I'm just saying that the Marines have the reputation for being the best and the baddest.  I wanted to go into a branch of military that is known for their standards.  I was looking for the challenge and I wanted to be in that brotherhood.  All branches have something to offer, the thing you need to think about is what do you have to offer to the United States military, know this and you will know which branch to choose.|`|GsRpZJX5aa	i think it really depends on what you are looking for. <br>  want to travel?? any of these would be great active i mean. even the air force. if you dont mind spending long months on a ship the navy<br>  <br>  and if  you want to stay close to home?? national guard will prob be the best.   coast guard isnt that bad either. i heard anyways<br>  <br>  make sure you do your research though. im in the guard i probably would have done coast guard but im enjoying it|`|Qa0nq4BPaa	Airforce or the Army.

It sounds like a utopia when one hears about it, but if you delve into it, it is anything but.<br>  What happens is that 5 classes are made to do separate jobs, of varying difficulties. There are Alphas (deemed to be the possible leaders of the country) Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons, who are the lowest class. Each class is "conditioned" to appreciate what they have, and how to work their hardest. Conditioning is almost akin to brainwashing, IMO. Furthermore, there is no intimacy in this world, as love often starts conflicts in most cases, and erotic play is encouraged at a young age.<br>  Bingo, and outsider (like you or me) enters the "utopian" society. But it is not perfect, and he is driven mad as a result.<br>  <br>  So, IMO, Utopia is indeed an attractive idea, but impossible to reach (unless we brainwash everyone into thinking the same thing, but then it wouldn't be a utopia).|`|l6mKwFb7aa	Utopia is impossible because everyone has a different perception of what Utopia is.

AA11440601	Not all stem cell research is immoral. Only embryonic stem cell research is immoral.<br>  <br>  Catholics believe that life is a sacred gift from God and needs to be treated with all human dignity from the moment of conception to the point of natural death.<br>  <br>  For this reason, the destruction of human embryos to harvest embryonic stem cells is immoral. <br>  ? The end never justifies the means<br>  ? A moral good can never come from a moral evil<br>  <br>  Here are just a few of the common myths about Stem Cell Research:<br>  <br>  Myth: Stem cells can only come from embryos. <br>  <br>  Truth: Stem cells can be taken from:<br>  ? Umbilical cords<br>  ? The placenta<br>  ? Amniotic fluid<br>  ? Adult tissues and organs including bone marrow, fat from liposuction, regions of the nose and even dead bodies up to 20 hours after death<br>  <br>  Myth: The Catholic Church is against stem cell research. <br>  <br>  Truth: The Catholic Church approves three of the four types of stem cell research:<br>  ? Against Embryonic stem cells<br>  ? For Embryonic germ cells (from miscarriages)<br>  ? For Umbilical cord stem cells<br>  ? For Adult stem cells <br>  <br>  Myth: Embryonic stem cell research has the greatest promise<br>  <br>  Fact: Up to now, no human being has ever been cured of a disease using embryonic stem cells. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, have already cured thousands. There is the example of the use of bone marrow cells from the hipbone to repair scar tissue on the heart after heart attacks. Research using adult cells is 20-30 years ahead of embryonic stem cells and holds greater promise. <br>  <br>  Based on the “The Ten Great Myths in the Debate Over Stem Cell Research” by Tadeusz Pacholczyk, Ph.D. <a href="http://www.ncbcenter.org/10Myths.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbcenter.org/10Myths.pdf</a><br>  <br>  Adult stem cells are already being used for the medical treatment of:<br>  ?

And the problem is, no cure has ever been found using infant stem cells, the opposite is true, they often mutate into cancer cells.  <br>  <br>  Adult stem cells are more reliable and predictable, and there has been more success with them.  Plus, no one has to die to get them.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	no one is against stem cell research.. people are against FETAL stem cell research...<br>  <br>  it is wrong to kill someone to save someone else it is that simple a fetus is a person to.. they just can't talk...<br>  <br>  -----------------------------<br>  <br>  huge steps are being made using skin stem cells and NO ONE is against that... what matters is what you have to do to get the stem cell...<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  using your liver example would you be ok with getting the liver if in order to get it they had to kill say a prisoner.. we institute a prison lottery and whoever s number comes up gets killed so you can have a liver?? for those that believe a fetus has a soul and is a person there is no difference|`|7ce892cc4050e10ec9ceecb9421c3efdaa	Most people are not against stem cell research.

Why is it that researchers would want to use fetal cells in the first place if perfectly adequate stem cells could be obtained elsewhere?<br>  <br>  I suspect that they are not equivalent and that fetal stem cells offer an advantage to researchers.<br>  <br>  I can't see any valid reason to object to the use of fetal cells from stillbirths or artificially fertilized embryos that will never be implanted.  We use child and adult cadavers constantly in medical research.  Why shouldn't we also use fetuses that have been terminated?|`|eeGn51Oiaa	Because God came to earth and told Bush it is wrong.

697f4b7e2abf668416acd21a3fe138f0aa	I have heard of it.  The people calling federal income tax withholding a scam are commonly known as tax protesters.  These people do NOT know law.  They are mistaken about the origins and purpose behind income tax withholding.  Also, there is no such thing as a "Full Paycheck Law" or at least there isn't one that does what they say it is supposed to do.<br>  <br>  The government has the power to levy taxes on individuals and companies.  Taxes are not voluntary. Taxes are legal. Arguments to the contrary have been defeated in court every time. <br>  <br>  There are a few people who have successfully defended themselves from criminal charges regarding taxes.  However, none of these people have EVER been successful in having a court declare that modern income taxes are illegal.  An acquittal in a criminal tax case doesn't mean there isn't a law any more than O.J. Simpson's acquittal means there isn't a law against murdering your ex-wife.
A90SRsTxaa	Not this one, but you got me what is it?|`|fgIbNRHfaa	The Uniform Commercial Code deals with such things as security devices.  For example, if you take out a loan to buy a car or an expensive ring, the financing company may talk out a lien on the car or ring to guarantee payment of the loan.  (These used to be called collateral mortgages).  If you don't pay, they can seize and sell the item.  These financing agreements are done pursuant to the UCC.<br>  <br>  Common law is an evolving body of law which is derived from court decisions made in particular cases.  Once a court is confronted with a novel issue of law, their decision in that case provides a "precedent" for later cases dealing with the same issue.  Future courts will generally rule the same way as the earlier court did on that issue.  This body of court decisions is called the common law.|`|Ua2A5TEvaa	The uniform commercial code (ucc) is a regulation of goods or services. Common law is a system deriving from england in which the us adopted that bases itself on precedent. This means if a case was decided in a certain jurisdiction on a particular matter then every case similar to it has to be decided the same. The only exception to this is if the supreme court decided on a case thats similar to a lower ct. The supreme court always takes precedent.

Anybody in America can/may become wealthy. There are no rules saying that you are prohibited from getting rich. If you apply yourself, you will progress; if you make bad decisions and procrastinate, you will not. The role of the government is to provide you with opportunities to better yourself. It is not the government's role to give you capital. When you are given capital, you lose the desire to work for it. I don't want money from the federal government, I don't want tax cuts, I want them to take that money and create opportunities for me to progress.<br>  "Socialism is great until you run out of rich people to take money from". Ask a Cuban. By the way, my income is less than $50,000 a yea, but I'm working on increasing that number. key word "working".|`|c1b8d1e146f67c24fce8487a20a072b9aa	How exactly do you figure you've been "sharing the wealth upwards"?   I've been paying taxes to support social programs that share the wealth downwards.  I thank goodness my employers have shared the wealth downwards too.   Tax breaks for business helps to push wealth downwards.  <br>  <br>  However, taking tax money from the middle classes to benefit pet projects of wealthy politicians, is definitely driving wealth upwards, isn't it?|`|e0c51b39028498ec82e61c51a9b0b0e5aa	Take all the wealth in the country.  Apportion it perfectly evenly.  Within 5 years 90% of the people that are wealthy now would be wealthy again.  Wealth is dynamic.  The poor can become rich, and the rich poor.

You are not even allowed to put a note in some one's mail box, however people do it all the time. If you tell some one that you put the key to your house or apartment in the mail box, even though you may have told them to get it out and go ahead in, it is a criminal offense.

a8e1KcS2aa	Drug testing is just that, testing for drugs.  Depending on what kind of test you get, different drugs can be detected and for different intervals of use.  You're probably going to take a urine test, which detects most of the common drugs that are able to be found.  So, pretty much everything that you can get your hands on can get detected.

You'll pay the costs which vary by state but it's not a whole lot.  In the meantime, you can ask people to call you by your new name.<br>  <br>  After a few years (and you turn 18), you will know if you like your new name enough to change to it.  I wouldn't be really hasty about choosing a name.  Think about it carefully and don't choose a trendy name.  There is more of a chance you will get sick of it.<br>  <br>  I didn't like my name but I went by my nickname for years.  Suddenly, I couldn't stand the nickname and I was glad I had never changed my name legally because I really like it now.  Esp when my mother told me why she had named me that name.

But the 1st bailout was not used like it they said, the government did not buy up those toxic assets, instead the money went to CEO bonus.<br>  <br>  And now Obama only wants to stimulate Big Government and Big Labor Union.<br>  <br>  When in reality the government has not laid off anyone, and the private sector has lost millions of jobs.<br>  <br>  Because people that depend on government, or big labor union, for a paycheck, vote for democrats.<br>  <br>  Just ask any state, or federal worker, or anyone that belongs to a labor union, who they vote for.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	better banks would emerge like smaller banks that did not loan people that could not pay off mortgages, why does Obama reward failures? got me|`|SS1VReF0aa	Someone else would fill the gap. It's always painful when any business goes under...but ultimately you have to let the bad businesses pay for their bad business or else they will just continue to do "business as usual" ...just like they are now. AIG took how many billions of dollars and they are asking for even more? If you let these companies fall, good companies will spring up to nab the opportunity at their business and try to run their company better than their failed competitor could.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Not just students, no one could get loans until the banking settled to a few monopolies.  Loans would then be for much higher interest rates.  The monopolies would need to recover the capital they spent buying up all the distressed banks.<br>  <br>  The interest rates would come down after but still remain at very high rates because their would be little competition.|`|A90SRsTxaa	The only one that seems to have a clue is Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke.

This is a natural cleansing process that economies and markets go through. Money would become tighter for consumers and business of all kinds but eventually things naturally correct and things get better. Poorly run businesses fail, well run businesses don't. What congress has done is the same thing that happened during the great depression, take what would have been a 3 to 4 year correction and drag it out to what was nearly a decade. They haven't solved anything, they just prolonged the inevitable and made it more painful.|`|VuqM9YH2aa	the market would purge itself a lot faster. that is what the market does when it gets bloated.that is why it is always up and down.the markets would of rebounded on their own in time. now with every bailout you are delaying and making  this situation worse.and yes you would of been able to get a loan.just a little harder.|`|PBys4M2laa	The big banks would take small countries with them.

AA11598520	Hmmm....Who do I believe? The ex con or the wife of a police officer? It's a tough choice.<br>  <br>   Actually, she sounds like my sister-in-law which, in that case, I'd have to give you some credibility. She once got pulled over for speeding in the suburbs and actually had the audacity  to the police officer to go into the city and get a REAL police job! Naturally, she got a ticket and my brother had to track the guy down and apologize. I would just ignore it. She likes to make a big fuss but if my brother, I mean her husband restrained her from going back inside, she's already been told to drop it.

We have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We do not have the right to free health care, free food, free housing, or anything else that would require taking time or resources from someone else. The less government we have the more we will all be free to exercise our God given rights. If there were an improvement to democracy it would be that only people that contribute to government in the form of taxes would have a right to vote. Just as only stockholders in a company have a say in the running of the company, only those who fund the government should have a say in how the government spends their money. Otherwise those who contribute nothing will continue to elect officials that force productive citizens to fund their nonproductive lifestyle through ever increasing entitlements.|`|0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	Democracy is the best form of government because there is freedom.

DTSUJe2oaa	Section 3-701 states that no person shall operate, nor shall an owner knowingly permit to be operated, upon any highway unless there shall be attached thereto and displayed thereon when and as required by law, proper evidence of registration in Illinois.<br>  <br>  This section goes on to say that a vehicle required to be registered in Illinois needs to have a current and valid Illinois registration sticker or stickers and plate or plates, or an Illinois temporary registration permit, or a drive?away or in?transit permit, issued by the Secretary of State.<br>  <br>  Section 3-702 discusses the operation of a vehicle when registration is cancelled, suspended or revoked. Here it states that no person shall operate, nor shall an owner knowingly permit to be operated, upon any highway a vehicle the registration of which has been cancelled, suspended, or revoked; or a vehicle properly registered in another Reciprocal State, the foreign registration of which, or the Illinois Reciprocity Permit or Decal of which, has been cancelled, suspended or revoked.<br>  <br>  Subsection (c) notes that any violation of this Section is a Class A misdemeanor unless: the registration has been suspended for no insurance, then the provisions of Section 3-708 of this code apply in lieu of this section.<br>  <br>  3-708 states that any person convicted of violating this Section is guilty of a business offense and shall be required to pay a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $2,000. Any person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of this Section is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor and shall be required to pay a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $2,000<br>  <br>  Back to 3-702 subsection c, that goes on to say that if the registration of the motor vehicle has been suspended for failure to purchase a vehicle tax sticker then the violation shall be considered a business offense and the person shall be required to pay a fine in excess of $500 but not more than $1000.<br>  <br>  In Illinois, a Class A Misdemeanor is punishable up to 364 days in jail and can carry up to $2,500 in fines.~

Yk7ett2laa	All doctors have malpractice insurance. The first thing you would need to to is file a report and submit a claim against his or her insurance company. Be prepared to prove your suffering though.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	I agree with the other poster, your question as is, is much too vague.<br>  <br>  There are many ailments/post surgical conditions, etc. that create or result in chronic pain. Determining whether or not the surgeon is responsible in any way can be very tricky indeed.|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	Medical malpractice is a funny thing.<br>  <br>  MUCH more info is needed to even give you an opinion here. What was the surgery for, what makes you think it was medical malpractice that is causing the pain? Many more details are needed.|`|TrgbEjXoaa	It might be worth suing for.  Can you show that the doctor did something s/he knew s/he should have done differently?  Can another doctor say that there is a general way the surgery should be done?  It's not an easy thing to prove malpractice, you probably signed a consent to treat, which would have outlined the dangers, and your doctor may have explained best and worst case scenarios.  The decision to undergo surgery, is ultimately yours.  <br>  <br>  Pain is horrible, and could make the emotional stress of a lawsuit more than you could bear.  <br>  <br>  I wish you healing and best of luck|`|iOqmoIrcaa	Any doctor worth his salt will make a statement such as I am sorry your daughter is having so much pain.  That is not an admission of guilt.  It is basic human decency.  As long as he followed the standards of care for your treatment, you don't stand a chance of getting anything.  Just because you don't get the results you expect doesn't mean there was any malpractice.  The human body is not an exact machine.  Every one is different.  As long as he made a reasonable attempt to treat you, he did nothing wrong.  And just because he didn't give you the tests you 'wanted' doesn't mean he did anything wrong.  You didn't go to medical school.   He did.  So he is the one who knows what you do or do not need.  And gynecologists always pay attention to their patients' concerns.  The only patients they have are women.  You are trying to use an old wives tale to justify getting money you don't deserve.|`|VOccyg7daa	Have you talked to the doctor about your pain?

xxDjV6Axaa	That is always the hardest part of any essay.  I always write the essay first and then go back and do the intro.  And struggle over that much more than the content.  <br>  <br>  But in this one you would have a lot of material to choose for lead ins.  I would probably go with the fact that he was imprisoned for so long when he was innocent.  What type of character would one need to stay strong under the circumstances?  Use those adjectives to describe him.  What happened?  He was imprisioned for 20 years for the horrendous rape and murder of XXXXX (forgot her name but you know it).  So your intro will briefly tell what the movie is about but you need to be descriptive so use your adjectives.

That way the lawyer can apply for some sort of temporary visa for you.... if your child has an American father and is born on American soil, you may have a good chance of getting your own visa to stay until you can apply for citizenship.  The government will not send your child out of the country if its an american and they will not take the child away from you.... and yes, please do document all the abuse..... because you will need that in case the jerk tries to sue you for full custody.<br>  <br>  So... keep money hidden for the day you walk out... in the meantime go see legal aid and ask about an immigration lawyer as you have to figure this out first... then deal with that A$$hole.<br>  <br>  good luck

kz1ZxVaTaa	Always, always always get a lawyer. They will advise you. You will enter a not guilty plea at your arraignment (more than likely). I highly doubt you will go to jail at all. You'll have a fine of not more than $500.00, probably $300.00. You'll likely get 6 months of district court probation. Do not get in trouble ever again and in a few years, you may be able to get this expunged from your record.<br>  <br>  BUT, get a lawyer ASAP|`|ONPK7jznaa	if you are found guilty of petty theft, you could get probation and community service.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	Odds are you'll get probation and a fine, but you really need to have a lawyer.  Assuming that you're in the U.S.A. and can't afford one, they will give you a public defender and I think that Britain and the British commonwealths have a similar set up.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Cb4vZuIDaa	you can get fined pretty bad by the store and have to pay a lot of money,and maybe some jail time it depends on the judge.real embarrassing crime if you ask me though.sux 2 be you.|`|sZMa0s7Baa	I used to shoplift from there all the time, and it actually used to be easy!! Then of course they caught on so now they're extra careful. Don't shoplift you will always get caught in the end!!|`|4vLt3SqFaa	I agree with those who say you need a lawyer.  When I was 18 (seems a long times ago - when did I get so old?) I did some stupid things, not shop lifting but traffic crimes.  The guy ahead of me in court did not have a lawyer and was charged with basically the same thing I did.  He lost his license for 6 months and ended up with 6 points and a 1500 dollar fine.  I had lawyer and kept my license, paid only 500 dollars, and got no points.  A lawyer is always a good idea even though it will cost some money. <br>  <br>  Hang in there.  I know you feel stupid but there are not many of us who didn't do a shabby thing or two in our youth even though most of us got away with most of it.  The pain fact is that  most people generally do not judge a teenager for life because they do something stupid - Our own pasts remind us that youthful folly is not an indication that you will turn out to be bad person.  You will turn out all right if you learn from your mistakes and it sounds like you have. <br>  <br>  I do suggest that you NEVER have anything to do with that group of "friends" who encouraged you down the wrong road.  They are TROUBLE.  No real friend would ever lead you astray like that.<br>  <br>  Best of luck in the future.|`|racnq84Vaa	You are not honest.  Honest people do not steal.  You are far from honest.  And no judge in the world cares what your friends think of you.  You have already proven how honest you are.  <br>  <br>  And, you have no learned your lesson.  Not once did you say that you were totally to blame.  You passed the blame off on to someone's shoulders, not yours.  Your friends made you do it excuse is just another example of you being irresponsible.  <br>  <br>  I think you should re-evaluate your life and why you would even associate with losers who think that stealing is okay.    You are part of the reason that prices are higher than they should be.  People like you cost honest people like me money.  Stores have to pay for loss prevention and security and pass the cost along to the consumer.  So, it wasn't about 30 dollars.  It was about the fact that you think you are entitled to take something that is not yours.  <br>  <br>  It is easy to pull the trigger on a gun too.  So, if someone were to walk up to you and shoot you and say in court 'My friends told me how easy it was to do' that would be ignorant.  And if that person brought these same friends in to account for his trustworthiness or reliability, do you think the judge would take them seriously?  Not at all.<br>  <br>  And when you are sentenced to whatever, it will be on your record.  And in the future when you apply for a job, they are less likely to hire a thief.   But hey, at least you still have your loser friends.<br>  <br>  PS- All criminals say they will not commit crime again.  The prison system is full of repeat offenders who have said the same old thing you have.  Words mean nothing.  Change your life for real and then the judge might cut you some slack.|`|tNbk9C4Haa	You won't go to jail it is petty theft!

You stole it and you must be ready for the consequences.|`|5BPLPjAZaa	Well you are should not get in that much trouble because it's your first affence. Just say that you did it and pay the fine.|`|de7d45898731917adf0449cb2256a798aa	Where are you from?   Just go back to your country and never come back... After 5 years nothing will happen to you.|`|VROAR6gEaa	I got arrested b4 for shoplifting makeup in Target (less than $30 worth). I got caught and they called my family to come get be at the police station. Fortunately, I was only 17. My family paid the fine of $100 and I was free to go home. I didn't have to go to court then, but it did show a scratch when I wanted to become citizenship. I went back to the police station and they had no record. So no record at all.  <br>  <br>  I know for a fact that you won't get jail time, just because of the amount and being your first time offense. It'll definitely be a small fine and a slap in the hand. They would always tell you that misdemeanor will get you jail time, like maximum of 1 year blah... (it's actually up to 1 year). They're usually very easy on first time offense. I would suggest that you look up on the internet for criminal lawyers around your area. Some will give you free consultation with good advice.  Good luck to you.|`|wYojn096aa	Go kick out a few dollars and get a lawyer.  They have many tricks.  Don't listen to bunch of folks that say you don't need a lawyer.  Run their names and see how many conviction they have.  I learned the hard way..I'm no angel either, but will get a lawyer even for seat belt ticket now.  The courts will run you around the block at full speed. Plus the prosecutor is a lawyer.|`|xdnXeQAZaa	Calm down and take a deep breath. You need an attorney. You can talk to a Public Defender for free. Never Plead guilty. Research on the web for attorneys, free legal aid,etc. You should google the usual punishment for such a crime. Google shop lifting charge etc. Beware of unscrupulous lawyers as well. Make sure you get a written contract. Never pay by the hour pay the attorney by the job. Pay in segments. Interview several attorneys. You should be fine with a Public Defender, (State Appointed "free" Attorney), since it is a small theft charge. Good Luck.

You first would have to get congress to recognize there is a constitution to begin with. From there you would have to convince congress that the constitution holds weight with regard to US law, and then somehow get the amendment passed without 300 tons of pork rolled in to it (the constitution is no place for ear marks).

You don't say!<br>  <br>  Anyways, this is just another move showing that Obama is for terrorist supporting states and organizations.  Handing our tax dollars over to the Palestinian government (HAMAS) shows how Obama and his administration is in full support for this terrorist group and how little Obama thinks of our association with Israel.  HAMAS has continually broken ceasefires and truces between them and Israel and Obama rewards them with money.  <br>  <br>  I guess Israel defending itself against a terrorist threat must be a bad thing in Obama's eyes.  Personally, I want to see our money stay here and help America out of its multitude of problems, but even that is getting screwed up with Biden being "the sheriff" of the stimulus.

AA10829482	Mark is sort of right:<br>  <br>  You can compete for HSSP scholarships prior to 1 Dec of your senior year in HS.  Our scholarships pay a set dollar amount for tuition, there's a book allowance ($600 per semester) and a stipend that ranges from $300 to $500 a month depending on what year you are in.<br>  You have the option of dropping ROTC at the end of your freshman  year, no harm, no foul. <br>  <br>  If you do not get picked up for an HSSP; you can compete for in college scholarships with the same benefits. <br>  <br>  We also have specific scholarships for certain majors like engineering, foreign languages, and nursing.  These change periodically depending on the needs of the AF.  <br>  <br>  HBCUs and HSI have additional scholarships.  All scholarships include stipend and book allowance.  <br>  <br>  About 75% of my cadets are on scholarship.  They work hard and get good grades in some tough majors. <br>  <br>  <br>  You do enlist in the Reserves while in ROTC (Hint:  Its called Reserve Officer Training Corp for a reason) but you are not in the traditional Reserves where you serve one weekend a month, etc. You are in the Obligated Reserves which means basically, you will serve after you finish college.  I tell my cadets that the only way they will get called up from ROTC is if 9/11 on steroids occur and the entire Cadre is dead.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Nope, If your a non scholarship AFROTC student, which 80% are<br>  <br>  The first two years, it is just a class you take.<br>  <br>  Then before your Junior year, you sign the papers for a military commitment,<br>  <br>  Attend summer session ( like basic )<br>  <br>  And come back and start the advanced ROTC class's.<br>  <br>  The last two years, you are paid a stipend of around $400 a month.<br>  <br>  Scholarship students have their military commitment starting their sophomore year and receive a larger stipend the entire time.<br>  <br>  Tuition, books and l;ab fees are paid for, room and board are not paid for, ( housing and food )<br>  <br>  The reserves has nothing to do with AFROTC.<br>  <br>  Although you can enlist in the reserves while an AFROTC student.<br>  <br>  You are thenm commissioned as a 2nd Lt. following graduation.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Not quite. You attend ROTC for 4 years. For year one and two you simply attend ROTC classes each semester. There are also "drill" like events as well. Prior to your junior year you sign on the dotted line. You get a stipend (don't know what it is now) for each month you are in school. You go to a summer camp after junior year for 6 weeks (that was for me at Army ROTC). You still take classes junior and senior year as well.<br>  <br>  After you graduate  you are commissioned and off to officer basic training. That is not boot camp.<br>  <br>  It's not all that bad.|`|ZdjfGjzIaa	Kind of.  You get a monthly "Stipend" that is tax free.  This is only a few hundred dollars and is not the same as reserve pay.  AFROTC classes are usually once a week with Leadership Lab.  Sometime during the first 3 years, you'll have to attend "field training" for a summer, kind of like basic.  This is a one time deal unless you failed the first time.  After you graduate from college, you will have to serve 4 years active duty as a commissioned officer.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	You are essentially correct.  rotc/afrotc/NROTC/nrotc mo  is an officer commissioning course.  On graduation a cadet/Mid is commissioned a 2nd lieutenant in the army, air force or marines or an Ensign in the  Navy. An rotc/afrotc cadet or NROTC Mid is enrolled  in his service branches reserves in a non-deployable status once he signs a contract. The tax free monthly stipend can be considered as  in lieu of  reserve drill pay.  He drills during the  week instead of one weekend a month. <br>  <br>  All Service branches rotc programs include a "Scholarship Program" and a "College Program."<br>  <br>  The first two years of any service branches rotc course is the Basic Course. The last two years is the Professional Officer's Course.<br>  <br>  There are scholarships available for  the "College Program"  for both the Basic Course and the Professional Officer's Course. All "Scholarship Program" cadets/Mids are of course on scholarship. <br>  <br>  "Scholarship Program" scholarships are awarded in a national competition. The Air Force at the present time mostly awards these scholarships to students majoring in engineering and a few other technical majors.<br>  <br>  "College Program " scholarships are under the control of the universities rotc/afrotc/NROTC program. These are generally awarded in all majors.<br>  <br>  rotc, NROTC, nrotc mo "Sholarship Program" and "College Program" scholarships pay full tuition regardless of cost.  About 5% of afrotc "Scholarship Program" scholarships pay full tuition. The rest are capped at 15,000 or a lesser amount depending on type. Certain public and private universities offer free room and board from their own funds  to rotc/afrotc cadets and NROTC/nrotc mo Mids.<br>  <br>  With this background information, here is a good explanation of afrotc:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://military.berkeley.edu/usaf.html" rel="nofollow">http://military.berkeley.edu/usaf.html</a><br>  Good Luck!|`|4eLzY2hfaa	i was in army R.O.T.C.  the first two years are military science classes, and drills.  MS I and MS II.  during summer break between sophomore and junior years you complete basic training and are officially given reserve status, at that point you start getting paid.  upon graduation and successful completetion of MS III and MS IV, you enter the army comissioned as a second lieutenant.  i' m certain that changes have been made since i was in the program but, i'll wager that 80% of it is still in effect.  talk to a recruiter to get more info.

Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, gave us the administration's strategy soon after the election in a talk with Wall Street Journal staffers: "You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.

To me, not a big deal...<br>  <br>  <br>  It was put in the pledge in the 50's as a way to say that we are a "christian" (and I mean this very loosely) nation... suggesting that we will not be subject to the communists...

4deb2dbf6151064d95572221a395b8f5aa	En oposición a lo que expresan algunas de las respuestas anteriores, en el tema de las adicciones no es cierto que cada uno tiene el derecho de hacer lo que desee mientras esté dentro de su intimidad.<br>  El adicto es un enfermo y esto está fuera de toda discusión razonable porque hay cientos o miles de trabajos científicos que lo prueban.<br>  Además, el adicto en su necesidad de conseguir drogas es capaz de robar o matar si fuese necesario y en ese caso ya deja de ser un aspecto íntimo para transformarse en un problema de toda la sociedad y eso sin contabilizar los recursos que el Estado debe destinar a la recuperación de los adictos que debemos pagarlo entre todos.<br>  Yo no me opondría a la legalización de las drogas si los adictos pudiesen asumir, y cumplir, un compromiso mediante el cuál se estableciera que el resto de la sociedad no tendrá que hacerse cargo de su rehabillitación, ni de la familia del adicto si ésta depende de él y deja de poder mantenerla por los efectos de su adicción, ni de los desmanes que el adicto pudiese cometer en su afán de conseguir drogas. En esas condiciones sí sería un aspecto íntimo pero no cuando todos debemos hacernos cargo de las consecuencias de las adicciones.<br>  Es muy fácil y cómodo exigir libertad para el consumo de drogas sabiendo que el resto de la población, los no adictos, se harán cargo de las responsabilidades que deja de cumplir el adicto a medida que va deteriorándose por el consumo de las drogas.|`|c5f3261480be35432ec3443b02a53decaa	Che si toca alguna banda cuando lo publikes nuevamente confirmando fecha pone quien toca.

iTetA3oCaa	The friendly IRS can make life difficult for you if you don't have it.  Go to your accountant and in your presence have him call the IRS they should by law provide you with a copy if he can't get it on line or you can try yourself at www.irs.gov but that does not work as well as being in the same room with your accountant.|`|jlgfkyrEaa	yes you need it to be within the legal parameters of the irs but if it is nominal it wouldn't be something to sweat over. <br>  <br>  If it is such a small amount that it has little bearing on your return the irs will not look that seriously at it.|`|hZLkzuuiaa	if you received a paycheck, you need the w-2. since the employer is unresponsive, you should call a tax prep service (likeh&r block) to see if there is another way to file the taxes from that job. i know its minor, but not filing taxes for that job would still be considered tax evasion|`|4TqadRJYaa	Money is money, i would get it if i was you.<br>  Take what you can get these days while the economy is so bad....|`|S87USMKLaa	...|`|AWSmknxLaa	yes you need it or the IRS WILL spank you|`|92699e2aaea664c1bd6bdf1cd3805274aa	Yes you do.

But anyway.......have your dad apply for you......as  he should have done to begin with.|`|T8nap2Pnaa	If your father hasn't already filed an immigrant petition for you, he needs to do so as quickly as possible. While that petition would take 5 years before it became valid for use, it would be upgraded if he became a US citizen. If he becomes a citizen before you turn 18, you'd be eligible for US citizenship based on the petition. But, even after you turn 18 up to the age of 21, you'd be elgible to get legal status based on the petition.  If you turn 21 before he becomes a citizen or files the petition, you could be waiting quite a while.|`|kzgmFekKaa	I would have thought that if your father is a legalised citizen that you have no problems. Other than that, there is the citizenship test. I am actually Australian, and so coming from a commonwealth country, citizenship can be a bit different to that of the US, so sorry if I haven't helped much.|`|7zF9kxK9aa	Your dad can apply for your. But as a resident it would take many years i know cases that it has taken about 10 years. The best thing is for your dad to become a citizend and include you on his application. That will make you citizen too.|`|lGc0DT5Faa	u can but ill take for ever. if he has stayed her for more tha  years with his green card and has no criminal record tell him to become a citizen and ull be lagal in less tha a week no lie. i wish i was in ur place lol|`|UiUPOA0laa	You can't do it "fast".

We need to build something that is something somewhat similar to the Great Wall of China.|`|kqMDzJw0aa	Not a good place to ask. Go call the local police dept. and ask them. I would recommend your friend move OUT OF STATE.|`|0UjFOsHkaa	Wow, I'm sorry to hear about your friend. That would be so terrifying. She is taken good measures to protect herself. It will help it from happening again, but it's not impossible for it to happen again. If possible, maybe she could have someone move in with her , it might help her feel safer. She might also want to carry around mace and a stun gun with her. Also, make sure she isn't out alone after dark or in isolated areas. I hope she everything goes good for her. Good luck to her
EuGsGfuJaa	I own one of these.<br>  <br>  To open it, you release the safely and press the lever on the handle.  The shaft shoots out and locks in place by friction.  It pops out with quite a bit of force, and would hurt if it hit someone in the face, though this wouldn't be practical for combat.  It would just hurt them, not cause any serious injury.<br>  <br>  To close it, you have to drive it sharply point-first into a hard surface, like a floor, to break the friction.  At this point, the spring will continue to hold it open.  You then continue to press it into the surface until the shafts have been pushed back in all the way back in and lock.<br>  <br>  I bought this mainly has a novelty.  The guards on the sides can be taken off by removing a screw.  But the release lever makes it incredible uncomfortable to grasp when using it in practice.  It is also rather unstable mechanically, and can sometimes extend when you don't want it too.  I had the thing get tripped accidentally and shoot straight out of it's holster.  I use a Monadnock now.
eOQ8rGqCaa	That is extremely offensive to Americans, and Liberals such as me. Would you really like that to be a reality, wake up and see millions of Americans being killed one day.|`|DgfEkFGLaa	No. If Rush said that then a link would be helpful. But at least you didn't re-post the same question again. Good for you!<br>  <br>  Did you agree with Rush when he said:<br>  "We believe that the preamble to the Constitution contains an inarguable truth that we are all endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life. [Applause] Liberty, Freedom. [Applause] And the pursuit of happiness. [Applause] Those of you watching at home may wonder why this is being applauded. We conservatives think all three are under assault. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you."|`|xUQDTEbZaa	This is really sick. You want americans to die just so the GOP gets back into power? Sad sad sad|`|bXn6WGaXaa	No. Not at all. I really don't care whether the Republican Party comes back to power. Politicians are politicians, and they are all criminals. I don't see where putting one group of crooks in place of another group of crooks is any kind of justification for hoping for something like that.|`|S6XSLvjLaa	You just dont get it.<br>  <br>  What he said isnt a complicated concept to follow.  Are you being contrary or are you really just that dense.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	I too agree with Rush that Ohbama's fascism must be stopped so America remains free.|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	first level troll! you mean bush ruined it, and god your twisted.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	You strike us all as a very patriotic American.|`|nTzTIrataa	That settles it, you're insane.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Since Rush has never said anything like that, and since nobody else but you and some left wing nuts like Ward Churchill have said that, you obviously do not know or agree with Rush.<br>  <br>  I'm just wondering why you leftists think spewing such foolishness does anything but diminish you.<br>  ---<br>  My goodness. Are people really stupid enough to believe you're anything but a troll pretending to be conservative?<br>  <br>  Hello... hello.. any sentient beings out there?|`|cIPziIdnaa	As I recall it was Biden who warned of a terrorist attack once Obama was elected.

Make no mistake about it - wishing for an attack on your country and fellow citizens is most definitely a treasonous.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I can't even tell if this is a poor attempt at satire. I mean - wow - you don't even bother beating around the bush. Perhaps the disease of neoconservatism has rotted your mind so severely that you don't even realize what you've said, which is thus:<br>  <br>  "I don't want to have the GOP back in power because I think they'd be better able to prevent an attack on the US. Rather, I want to see another attack because I think it will help put the GOP back in power."<br>  <br>  You sir, are the embodiment of "party before country." Go hang, traitor.|`|tLHM4npxaa	Wow you agree with Rush.. a fat bastard who got caught with a month's supply of Viagra pills and Oxycotton..then claimed he did not have an addiction..wow..its sad...And you hope America gets attacked..that is sad..you belong with the terrorists..We are a nation of ONE..|`|AA11481889	I'm a staunch Republican...and I can truthfully say...that THAT may be the stupidest thing I've ever heard.<br>  <br>  Having a terrorist attack that would cost innocent American lives just to give liberals a big fat "I Told You So" is asinine.|`|EOhxXxM9aa	You seem like the kind of person who was standing in front of the TV cheering on 911!<br>  <br>  Why did the GOP block an investigation of 911 for more then a year?Why did Bush ignore terrorism until after we were attcked?|`|1FkYHLXDaa	I don't want Obama to fail that bad.

You who follow on every sound the man makes are in for a big surprise when you realize he and people like him (Anne Coulter) are in it for their egos and not for the betterment of the country.<br>  <br>  Oh, and Bill Clinton may have helped open the door to the economic problems, but it was the idiots who entered into a mortgage they knew they couldn't afford and the banks that allowed them to do it that are the culprits here.  Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should do it.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	You really don't want what's best for this country, do you? If he fails, he fails and we're dragged into the worst economic climate that this nation has seen...ever. Your rationale for wanting him to fail is so that the GOP can get back in power, which is selfish. You want success for the GOP at the expense of the well being of America. <br>  <br>  If you have any legitimate concern that it was, in fact, Clinton that broke this country, take a look at history. Under Clinton, this nation did not suffer any terrorist attack on our homeland, largely due to his activity in fighting terrorism worldwide, which the conservative pundits harangued him for. Bush was the one with the report on his desk warning of an impending attack and he did nothing. The relaxing of financial regulations under Bush turned a fiscal surplus into a massive debt. Not under Clinton. Clinton created the surplus, Bush pissed it away on tax cuts for the very wealthy based on the flawed premise of trickle down economics, which has been proven throughout history to simply not work. Just because you disagree with history doesn't mean that you can go back and claim that history is on your side. It doesn't work like that. <br>  <br>  But my prevailing concern with your thinking is this: why do you want American civilians to die? Did the attacks of September 11th not satisfy you? Why on Earth would you want for an attack to succeed on America? <br>  <br>  I'm amazed that you can listen to Rush Limbaugh and not question anything he says. The man is a drug addled narcissist and I'm not just name calling. He did, in fact, have an addiction to prescription painkillers. He does, in fact, have some weird superiority complex in which he is the head of the conservative movement in this country, demanding from the CHAIRMAN OF THE RNC to apologize for disagreeing with Rush. <br>  <br>  Again, why would it make you happy to see this nation fail?|`|ZOY7rS3Raa	Obama WILL fail.  However, the rest of America will not.  Vigilance will prevail.  THis aside, I think that the question is merely a provocative one designed to elicit comments along the lines of your question.  I think you voted for Obama, several times.  If you didn't, then you sure are acting like a Democrat|`|Hb7TW09saa	unbelievable..is that what Rush really said? i'm not sure i believe that he'd even say that. if you truly believe that you really don't like American or have any regard for your fellow citizens...pathetic.<br>  people like you are the reason the GOP is out of power and has a 20% approval rate..keep up the good work!|`|c1b8d1e146f67c24fce8487a20a072b9aa	That is an idiotic thing to say.  Are you just supposing that you and YOUR family and friends will NOT be in danger in the event of an attack on the US? .  Dumb.  <br>  <br>  By the way, I can't stand Obama and I'm a Republican.|`|8qS7Fzdtaa	I don't ever want this country to be attacked. I hate the libs pelosi etc.. but never want that to happen for any reason. And Rush or "typical republicans " never said they wanted that either.|`|NW6yqZ9Saa	I never would wish for America to get attacked on anybody's watch.|`|O8f8sxPraa	You're a stupid *******  slut|`|Cs7NbRHzaa	Typical republicans.|`|WvMTmAYPaa	You are a troll.

z88IMXNFaa	No.  Proof that she called is not proof of a threat.  Call or visit the investigator and ask him to level with you about what's going on.|`|zSABr7praa	You should be filing for a restraining order, not an arrest.  That way, if she contacts physically or over the phone, she will have violated, and will be arrested.  You need to take your phone logs, as well as the police report i'm assuming you made to the court house, and request a restraining order.<br>  <br>  Who told you this?  You do not need a summons to get a personal protection order or a temporary restraining order.  If this was the case how would battered women get away from abusive husbands?  Take what you have, go to the COURT HOUSE, not the police station, go in front of a judge, and request a temporary restraining order.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Go to court in Nassau County and file for a temporary restraining order.  The Clerk of Court office in the courthouse can help you obtain the proper forms.<br>  <br>  Even so.  with just the number on your caller ID, they cannot arrest her unless she is dumb enough to admit it.|`|T7gf3v5kaa	unfortunately there is nothing you can do at this moment. if she had kept calling and you had the call records pulled and showed them then she can get in trouble for harassment. but the police i've noticed don't generally do much until something is actually attempted by the person making the threat.

I think it has been explained over and over how Obama's words and actions are consistent with being a socialist.|`|bMtBtYDsaa	No,they meant to say Obama..Obama is a far leftist loon.Since taking office he has turned this country in the wrong direction and is making it worse everyday. <br>   We didnt want more problems.If you werent for killing innocent people in other countries I assume you are for killing innocent people in your own country.the democratic party had rule of the house years before the financial crisis.Why are you bringing up things that have the republicans have proven to be lies.|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	“When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross.” <br>  <br>  Sinclair Lewis 1935|`|Hb7TW09saa	bush isn't sophisticated enough to be a fascist..he was just an incompetent president. no more, no less.|`|Emq9jEc1aa	I don't believe Obama is a communist. He is definitely a fascist, and most probably a socialist, but there isn't anywhere near enough evidence of intent, or intelligence, to label him a communist. Alinsky (the man who taught Obama everything he knows) was a rabid fascist. He could tolerate socialism, but only if there was a VERY small elite controlling all the power. In essence, he preached "large fascism" or "small socialism."<br>  <br>  And Obama thinks he (Alinski) hung the moon.|`|AA10023996	It was an interesting video and I believe that someone could do the same thing about Obama and prove that he is a communist,if that is all the proof you would need.I don't think that you are anti-american,you have every right to voice your opinion,but would you have been able to do that under a Fascist government? How does belonging to the Democrat party prove that one is not a communist. And after all of that neither of us proved a damn thing did we?|`|ObceXHPjaa	You say fascist like it is a bad thing, socialist lib!<br>  What should poor people control the government?!|`|4PM1yljNaa	This the biggest joke I have ever seen.  Historians/political scientists are still arguing over what exactly defines a fascist regime, but I can tell you that the Bush administration was not one.  Most, if not all, of the claims in that video had very little (if any) factual basis.  Obviously the person who created it is a very left-wing nutjob who is still sore about the 2000 election that Gore legitimately lost.  Get over it.  Socialism is here, so be happy.<br>  <br>  See Rocky's comment directly below.  It's PERFECT.|`|9P3uKmPlaa	There is an extreme amount of opinion and conjecture in what you are using as proof of your statement that George Bush is a fascist.<br>  <br>  "even though he clearly is a member of the Democratic Party and always has been" <br>  <br>  You seem to be under the impression that because someone is a member of the US democratic party that they can't be a communist. Communism is a "left leaning" ideology, and most democrats lean left as well. Does this mean all democrats are communists? No. At the same time it doesn't preclude a member of the democrat party from being communist. The two are not mutually exclusive.<br>  <br>  "Any intelligent person will actually watch it and see what I'm saying"<br>  <br>  Watching or not watching the video is in no way an indicator of intelligence, it is a choice. Choices can be made by both intelligent and not so intelligent people. So can ridiculous statements.<br>  <br>  "I am so sick of being called anti-american because I hate george bush"<br>  <br>  Hatred can sometimes blind us from seeing the truth.<br>  <br>  "We went to war with a country and the rational for going turned out to be false...."<br>  <br>  This statement is opinion, of which you are definitely entitled, but please don't be offended or become angry when others see things differently.<br>  <br>  "I don't believe in killing innocent people in other countries"<br>  <br>  I'll assume you are referring to the Iraq war, again, clearly opinion with no foundation in fact.<br>  <br>  Fascism - a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism.<br>  <br>  Considering the recent move towards nationalizing the financial industry in this country and attempting to silence opposing opinion with the fairness doctrine, a case might be made that Obama fits the bill more so than George Bush.

Even then, he's not likely to get custody of kids he's failed to support and maintain a relationship with.  It's more likely they'd go to another relative who's close to them<br>  <br>  If she gets deported - guess what - the kids go with her.  Unless she chooses to leave them here.<br>  <br>  Encourage your brother to file.  That way, his ex gets the child support her kids deserve.|`|VOi43Tquaa	That isn't near enough information to make a decision.  It depends on who is the better parent and who can provide for the children the best.  If your brother knew what was best for him he probably wouldn't be suing as the judge could also turn around and make him pay child support.|`|X6rFPI2laa	Your brother needs a lawyer who handles family matters.  The decision will be made by the judge.
