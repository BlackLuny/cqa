Because once you have sex, so many emotions are attached to that person. So make sure that he is the "one" because you can never turn back time if you have regrets. I know alot of people are having sex before marriage in today's society but if you are still a virgin i would highly recommend waiting until you are married. That is the perfect gift to share with your husband. But if you do have sex now take peraussions (condoms, birth control) and be in love  with the person you share your virginity with.|`|4de49913438cbdab9fefc945ba5bd7b6aa	first off how old are u? if your over 15 congradulations on holding on to your innocence ok all your questions will be answered in time you are doing the right thing by waiting its hard but it is worth u will know the right man when u find him don't rush and please don't meet up with the guy online that is real dangerous be carefull and make sure the person u give your all to is the right one because once its gone u can't get it back i wish u the best of luck|`|ffd6257090e64b61da34e68d8b652cadaa	be patient... the best things come to those that wait.

First, ask yourself if you can handle being far away from him, and be honest with yourself. Then sit down with him and talk about it. If you think you can or cannot handle a long-distance relationship, tell him! Be sure to let him speak his piece, though, and remember honesty is always the best policy. Don't do anything like this without talking to him first, unless you have other reasons for a breakup besides the distance factor. Hopefully you two can come to a mutual conclusion. Good luck!

You can however be there for them if they need you to talk to or spend time with,  as long as you don't allow yourself to be used. No one is worth that. Believe in yourself, show your best side and be who God intended you to be. He may not choose this person for you....that would make it a mistake to try to push yourself on this guy. Just try to be nice, good, kind and a friend to him. These are qualities that people all look for in mates. Good luck to you however it turns out.|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	Well, you can't make anyone like you.  You can only command respect.

But in the end you realize that being you'r self was the best thing that you could of done and if he does not see that or respect that thin he isn't the one for you. or maybe he is just a jerk and turns out you deserve better any how.

886ae7391e9d3d67fdab48522c707305aa	Sorry, sweetie, there's nothing for you to do but wait. Be a good friend to him, wait out all of this rubbish, and one day when you're both single, you'll realise how you feel about one another, and it will be just right.    Trust me - I know from experience. I was friends with this guy for years and it wasn't till he started going out with this girl and moved to another city that I realised how much I like him. He came back a few months later when things didn't work out, by which point I was dating someone else. A few months later, we finally got together. Been together 5.5 years and getting married next March.    I know it's frustrating, but you just need time and patience. I'm sure it'll work out just fine. :o) Good luck!|`|e87d9e8120fb6fb30ddf958aa892504eaa	You need to learn some tips. Visit some of these site :  http://netnew.tripod.com/id13.html

And you'll spend your whole life with her, not with family. So just go ahead, marry her.  Maybe you both would get problems from her family, but dun worry, after a time (could take years), the relationship would get better between you both and her family. Because no matter what, she is the daughter of here parents, they have the same blood, and no one can ever change it. Not even her parents.  And when you have a kid, her parents will automatically be nicer to you. There's no grandparents who dun love their grandkids.  I'm so sure bout this, cuz I've experienced it by myself.. even we haven't got any kids now.  So.. good luck! ;-)|`|9a1eb97689a998e5c4bdd3b7fcbea028aa	You are marrying her not her family.

No sense teaching the old dog new tricks here, either.|`|998c29f8d2d127c641e00f915bca5ce0aa	Make a list of what is really important before you start looking for a long term relationship...not a terriably long one just the important stuff (want a family/marraige/religion/fitness/beliefs... this will help you understand more of who you are looking for. Don't count anyone out, people are always saying "it happened when I least expected it" I think they were just more willing to spend time on it.   The internet is a great tool....but just be honest as what you really want, after all you shouldn't take up others time just as they shouldn't take up yours.  I met my husband drunk at a bar, it took a few dates but I knew he was the one, he had all of the items on my list, not perfictley but close....and that's what really counts.

d0be65304982d5dfc56d5657f56c8c26aa	i will agree with you 300% myspace is a great place to find old friends from school.. yes there are some raunchy poeople on there looking for the other things and not their friends. MySpace is also a great way to meet new (clean) people if you have moved to a new town.. or not really to meet them but to find out from them what there is to do in the new town. MySpace is most likely the best thing that has ever happend on the internet in my opinion.|`|57a40e81467291e026bfe011cfbd1d1eaa	just be careful, cause a "friend" could turn into something else|`|fc50106b79171579165f55925729c43caa	i use myspace as a way to talk to my other friends its easier for me to message them then to call them.some people are on myspace to find other people and to network,and to just say they have one.everyone has their own reason they have a myspace.|`|AA11387246	I have a myspace account and only use it for past high school friends; close friends and family.

It seems the girls on there have no values.  I am so tired of looking at the naked pictures of girls.  I am hot too, but I don't show it to the world.  It's gross, and I don't think they realize how it makes them look.  But, what do you do?|`|28174152b603755efddaec828b54901caa	i love it!!  i talk to all my friends and its easy.|`|26895520b344fbc3d9d0e7496f0e96ebaa	I agree.  I am also a mother of 2, soon to be 3, and I get kind of aggrevated at some of those profiles, too.  But, for the most part, I just like to send a message or two to a few of my friends.  I try not to look at the nasty chicks letting it "all" hang out.      I love my space.  I have found a lot of old friends, too.  Some people are just there to find a date or a fling or something.  Just ignore those people like I do.
AA12083470	If you do, meet at a public place.  Do not let him know where you live until you get to know each other.  I'm not talking about hours, I am talking about months.  There are alot of sicko's out there.  Be very careful and carry a pocket knife or mace.  Protect yourself and watch this guy's behavior.  Don't let him take you off before you get to know him.  Let friend's or your parents know.  If your parents will freak they have good reason, but if your going to do it anyway, let someone know.  Anyone you trust.  Tell them you will call them and let them know when you get home so they know your okay and don't get a search party out after you.  Just use good common sense.  Usually your instincts are pretty good, so follow your feelings.|`|d1898a9afeea054b1cb7f52aaecb9d73aa	Internet dating can seem like the easy way to find lasting love, but don't give your hopes up too quickly.  There are many dangers that you must consider, not to mention other facts.  You can talk to a person over the internet a million and a half times, however the person you imagine you're talking too often ends up being someone completely different.  That person can often turn out to be someone who means to do you more harm than good.  Do you really want to take that chance?  While some aspects of internet dating seem positive, I don't believe you can find your true love in this type of environment. However, everyone differs. Everyone is in a different situation. You have to ask yourself, 'why do you have to resort to this type of dating?'. Sure, it's never easy trying to find that great person to share your life with, but why are you single? What's holding you back? Are you a work-aholic? How's your self confidence? Do you have a problem with approaching potential mates? You have to decide if it's truly worth your time. If you really need an internet dating service then I say go for it. But be prepared. All of these dating services make promises of finding true love, however, not all deliver. Personally, I would leave fate to do the work for you. Concentrate on yourself for now. How can you be a better person? Do you need to lose weight? Are there any bad habbits that you have to get rid of? Concentrate on improving your own self confidence by take better care of yourself. I think the reason you may be looking for an internet dating service is because of your lack of self-confidence. Once you up your confidence, you can feel better about entering the dating world- without the need to spend a ton of money for someone else to tell you who you should be with.  Good luck!|`|AA10192394	It seems to work for a lot of people, just be careful

4711a6666d2e6f88e7842a607a59a7a3aa	saying these three words are kind of hard for most people who are sensitive to other people's feelings.   for the reason that they always think ahead of what the other person might feel or what his reaction would be.  on the other hand, there are people too who just don't care how the other person feels so it just comes easy for them to say i love you even though they don't feel it even a bit towards him or her.     with regards to my personal opinion, i admit that saying these three little words could result to a deeper relationship or a disaster.  A deeper relationship if you really mean what you say and catastrophe(what a word) if you just don't wanna hurt the other person's feelings.  so i would prefer to say whatever that is in my heart even though it would hurt the other person, at least it would only for a while.  prolonging the agony is very unfair to the other person.|`|b9a1f9997a3e751a12c661485452507aaa	I have never been in love with anyone before.

He looked so sad when he said it, like it hurt him to feel that way about me..because he couldn't have me, because he knew I didn't feel the same.. I knew he meant it, but I didn't say it back because I liked him a lot, a LOT, but it wasn't love yet. I would never say "I love you" just to make a guy feel better. And I would never use it as a way to get something. I'm just not that kind of girl.

Sicuramente ci star male, ma vedrai che tu ti sentirai tranquilla.   Avrai affrontato la situazione di persona e nn tramite sms o altro.   Col tempo a questa persona le passer, ma nn potr mai venirti a dire che nn sei stata sincera con lei/lui.     Molte persone ti hanno suggerito di allontanarti senza dire nulla...   A mio parere nn  il modo giusto di comportarsi.   Hai detto che questa persona tiene a te, e sono sicura del fatto  che oltre a nn avere pi la possibilit di poter trascorrere del tempo con te, sicuramente si chiederebbe in continuazione la motivazione del tuo comportamento.   Sicuramente questa persona, conoscendo il motivo... riuscir a superare  molto meglio questa situazione, conoscendo il motivo per il quale  successo.     Purtroppo io anni fa, io sono stata la "vittima" di una situazione del genere.  Ancora oggi mi chiedo cosa io possa aver fatto di male, per meritarmi una cosa del genere.

AA10185087	Self confidence plays a *much* bigger part in how people view you than physical size.  If you're confident and secure about yourself, the people around you are going to pick up on it and notice you.  They may not rate you as "hot" if asked, but they're going to notice you, and they're going to be interested.  It won't get you all the way, but it'll get you farther than the size 0 wallflower sitting in a corner, or the nervous anorexic flirt self-consciously tugging on her hair all the time.  ^_^;  Just be yourself, and don't worry about stereotypes and media-propagated images of women--they don't matter nearly as much as Madison Avenue would like you to believe.|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	It isn't that big of a deal. Hygeine is what is.|`|AA11939205	whatever she can pull off and still be sexy...she has to move nicely and present a great figure..|`|6eff719311eeb5fb74992405262cb189aa	Size really does not matter.  It all depends on how you showcase your features and conduct yourself.  Look at Queen Latifa.  She is a big women, but fashion and personality make her attractive.  You could be a size 0, but if you act like you are on crack than you won't be viewed as attractive.    In other words, hotness and being attractive have absolutely nothing to do with what size you are.
77142ee6cba27ce882366ae991d4849baa	Depends on what you mean by "forced".  If you mean so religiously oppressed with sense of "duty" and "obligation"; by being so pressured by church and family to get married; to feel you have no real choice...  Then yes.  At 18 I married someone I didn't love, in place of someone I did.  18 bitter years later, after losing church, friends and family anyway I got divorced.  Marrying out of "duty" was the greatest regret I've ever had in life.  18 years of emptyness, disappointment and pain.|`|d76896e1e64297132e8d96add00f5f7daa	I wasn't forced to marry my now soon to be ex... but i loved my true love then and for 4 years before that and so when I started dating the husband it was rebound and so I knew he would take care of me.. well 7 years after that and I met back up with the true love and well 2.5 years later, my true love and I are going to marry.... isn't that wonderful!|`|6f0641fd51464ff6802d761769a10292aa	yeah, in the old days,   peeps from china had forced marriage|`|5900086482259c43bfc88fab1643bf32aa	Thats rape, if they have they should have killed all involved in the would be rape and all who influenced them ie their relgious leader and destroyed the church/mosque etc so they can harm and influence non more...      its no different to sex slave trafficing|`|819c01a403b1669a80df163dba048980aa	Nobody can force another person to say "I do"  When the preacher asks, you can say "No, I dont"- thats your prerogative.  Dont throw your life away on some spotty nerd your parents have chosen as "suitable".  Say NO even if it means leaving home;  YOU are responsible for your own happiness, not them- they dont have to live with their choice, be mauled in bed by some loathsome creep you cant stand, or be servile to a bully ; neither are you. DONT DO IT>|`|4d129b6b98bc8973c2f40cbbb65c0e7aaa	NO, you cannot be FORCED into marrying someone, I knwo when God brings 2 people together he matched them up, to compliment each other and to be a team, God would not FORCE someone into marrying them as God gave people free will, even if he brought the 2 of them together.  As for parents, most parents love their offspring and want them to be happy, and when they bring someone into your life, they see the comfoprts they can give you as they dont want you to struggle-like they did, or want you to be in need,however, ask yourself this - can you get  nto bed with someone and have and that sex, and live with them if you didnt care for them and loved another???  I have a friend and she moved in with a guy, becasue he was kind to her and loved her, he was better off than she was, and he treated her the way she wanted to be treated, and after a couple of months, she couldnt have him come near her as it made her ill, just the thought of him touching her - let alone him doing it, she hated him touching her very quickly, theyve split up-understandibly, he still loves her, and they talk on frindly terms, but if he tries to touch her she recoils.  So before you marry someone you dont love, or have any real feelings for -remember what ive told you, and remeber the person that you do love, once upon a time I loved my x and would have married him, then I met someone else, so I wouldnt marry him now - I deserve better, good luck|`|AA11830337	Is it tradition in your family or something? I don't think many people do that anymore. Some cultures do though.    But if your literally being forced into marriage then I agree with the other people, at the altar say I don't. If your being abused then you have to do something about this. I mean really do you want to be with a guy that you DON'T want to spend the rest of your life with?
AA11911339	only you can change the ways of your life.  start small but in a big way. perhaps you should change everything, like your diet, and what you do at the weekends, take up a sport or go jogging, redecorate... if you want to change you life you need to change the environment that surrounds you.|`|AA12394604	Read some tips on this site on how to be more confident|`|77ff6e25d2f47737fd25fccc7a8fb822aa	Go hug a girl.
fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	I would say you shoulda had held off untill marriage... Nothing wrong with that, but since you didn't... you can always tell him you want to... after all it's your body... and it's not fair you get pregnant cuz he wants you to. Your body is going to have to carry that so if he wants you to get pregnant he better make sure he has your approval.   Men can be really selfish... they want to feel everything, but when it comes to be responsible they walk away.  To tell you the truth, hon, I would go get a shot or something to make sure it doesn't happen w/out your consent.|`|130dba6dd4565d3d900d63269b7ab29baa	Uh Oh.... Good luck on this one sweets. You two need to have THE TALK about kids. Tell him you want to wait till marriage, tell him your not ready, tell him something.... and quick! But DO TALK to him... cuz obviously he is missing something.|`|8abac93ceca85f79f594241ccaeae132aa	yah talk to him...|`|6460883e2266cdadff692fb2332199beaa	most men don't like to wear condom, it reduces sensitivity... he's thinking more of pleasure and not so much of consequences. remind him and be firm about it everytime unless you wanna get pregnant.    or think of another solution like taking the pill|`|18e40518927ce863d459088fc2762a58aa	Sounds like he is trying to get you pregnant.  Tell him how you feel, and what you think he may be doing.  Tell him you are not ready for children right now and if he does not use a condom you cannot have sex with him.  Or...you can go on the pill
c6ceb05e8348f7b5fd18a8ef10c4c046aa	Is there a women's shelter or a domestic violence hot line in your area? They may be able to answer your questions about what your rights are and you might feel better just talking to someone about it. I know you are feeling desperate right now, but it will take some time to get it all sorted out and if the charges filed are false the law takes a dim view of people who lie about things and you ex will face charges and possibly a fine for doing this. Your attorney will be able to help you sort it out when he gets back.   As far as the laptop, you can file a claim in small claims court, and get a judgment against him for the value of the item which is a serious matter as well. I hope this helps, it sounds as if you've been caught up in a bad situation. I'm so sorry you have to go through this, but the best thing you can do right now is relax, and be glad your ex is gone and take care of your own needs. Good luck!|`|AA11746917	I'm not sure what your question is, but I'll give you the best advice I can......Because there is a no contact order, you cannot contact your ex in any way, and that includes contacting him to get your laptop back. So I recommend that you calm down and lay low for the weekend, and speak to your attorney first thing on Monday morning. I know that you're upset and sometimes things seem overwhelming, but use this time to get your head together. Once you talk to an attorney, you'll feel better.....and you can't really do anything about it since it's the weekend.|`|20f1c5f6187738c02c156597e24c0c5aaa	I can't really help you, but your ex-fiance sounds like a real jerk, hopefully he will get what he deserves soon enough and hopefully thats a long jail term.    You just need to have a clear head through these tough times.    Good Luck!!|`|7bad485eeb33249932a143e042561de9aa	Hang low for the weekend and first thing Monday get in touch with your lawyer.
4cdd7af3ec724562329be37dc5e98303aa	It depends entirely on a combination of your personal morals and the prevailing cultural norms in your area.  What's perfectly normal in Amsterdam would be seen as perverted and likely be illegal in the southern United States.|`|AA12258788	Well, most people's definition seems to be "everything I like to do isn't kinky, and anything I'm not into is kinky".|`|d78e45617ee4803fcedd88e93ab98905aa	If the police break in and drag you away it's not kinky.|`|b004ceb5b3204380f5b1af7a57f73f20aa	you need to be more specific. I know what you are trying to ask, but well is this a limit you want your boyfriend(assuming your a girl, sorry if I'm mistaken). Or is this a limit you want to set for yourself? your question should be alot clearer. I mean main difference is the way you talk, the cloths you wear, the kind of things you like to do during sex, difference between having casual and rough sex, put little things like handcuffs and blindfolds, whips, chains, etc...      Hope I helped somehow but really make your question alot more understandable if you want people to answer better.|`|5d8855201d27b4c0eaf74304f1c85c55aa	kinky is when you want be all in the kitchen, bathroom, frontroom,on the sinks just every where.

If you're asking when you should ask them out, give them about 5 days' notice. A week is too long, and any less than 5 days might make them think you're just asking them out on the spur of the moment and that you assume they won't already have plans.|`|AA11679556	On the boardwalk just before you go -   and I would say when your friend and her friend aren't there (try ang get a little privacy)- it could turn quite embarrassing for both of you if there are others present and it doesn't go like you want it to. that, and most girls don't want to be on show when being asked things of this nature.

She is staring into space while thinking of something and you just happened to walk into the space she was staring into.  You look vaguely familiar, and she can't decide whether you are someone she knows, or just look like someone she knows.  She could think you're cute.  Generally, I have to force myself to not look away from someone I don't find attractive and that may appear that I am staring too.  I don't like to hurt feelings and I'm afraid they can see it in the expression on my face.  Just yesterday, I met a man whose face was so badly burned, he didn't have eyelids, lashes, eyebrows, or lips.  Every time I caught myself trying to occupy myself so I could look away, I forced my self to look him in the eye.  If he has the strength to continue to live his life, then I need to have the strength to at least be able to acknowledge him and look him in the eye.|`|AA10785882	you should check for toilet paper stuck to your foot.|`|1b53ee803127f3ce4c8fd8a57bd6d752aa	either you hideous to look at or you might have a booger stickin out your nose|`|3415cbe4bcc32ea984a2174fcdc4a3a2aa	well she might think ur ugly....or she might think ur cute.....it can go either way|`|ff7eab59fcba6a44058ae03708e76886aa	it means she has never been to a freak show b4|`|AA11342265	She is clearly a doper.

But the fact that you don't enjoy conversing with her or her social circle should give you feedback that you may not have great chemistry.    Don't worry about "giving of the impression" you are friends with people?  Life's a little to short to be worried about disassociating with people unnecessarily.    Follow your mom's advice.  Be polite and courteous.

If you don't like to speak with her then just smile at her for it is the polite thing to do as your other said.

Don't let them be separated.  Do whatever you can to get them out of the system.  But if you do adopt them, since you're related to their real mom, she'll play a big part in their lives.  Will the kids know that she's their real mom (or are they old enough to already know that?)?  Why were her children put into the system in the first place?  If she is a bad influence on the kids, maybe you do want another family to adopt the kids so they'll be away from their mom.

89e4ee201d462784f64424f3c6c2e36caa	1.Claro que se puede perdonar!  la pregunta ms importante es  2.?Se puede volver a confiar en esa persona?  Mmm depende de cada uno... pero creo que siempre uno se la pasar verificando.  3.Entonces ?Como continuar la relacin?  Cada caso es distinto pero todo parte de restarle algo de importancia a la fidelidad... y aferrarse a que sexo no es igual a amor.  4. La pregunta importante siguiente ?Realmente te ama? o mejor an ?Qu significa amor para el?  Una vez que lo sepas sabrs si realmente te quiere o no. Si se quiere de verdad entonces hay posibilidades de continuar y depende de ti.  5.Ahora otra pregunta tan importante para poder continuar ?Es tu pareja consciente de las complicaciones de una infidelidad?  -Enfermedades como el SIDA  -Un hijo no deseado... herencia... cambios en la familia...  -Herir a una 3ra persona al incluira en una relacin sin futuro..  -Puede cambiar lo que sientes por tu pareja actual... y despus arrepentirte con el tiempo... y terminar todo en nada... estar dispuesto a tirar todo por la borda?    Si te fu util por favor eligela como mejor respuesta|`|2361f41208228d9c4b62981c1ef5b337aa	cuando se pierde la confianza e una pareja en el caso de infidelidad tiene muchos procesos el mantener la relacion es importante,pero si el problema no es el si no tu que lo has llevado hacer infiel,es bueno reconoicerlo sies sincero pero si es un pretexto para hacer lo que desea no existe la disculpa por el herrror cometido suerte y camina con prudencia|`|668a7547ca25b3f0ef62e424c4baf0a6aa	Mira, la verdad que yo soy bien rencorosa y de repente me acuerdo de cosas de mucho tiempo atrs y me da la misma emocin o me siento hasta peor, pero tratare de explicarte algo.  Si aun quieres salvar tu relacin puedes pensar (por tu propia paz interior) que tu esposo cometi ese error, pero volvi a ti porque tu eres la mujer de su vida y la que el ama realmente. Bien pudo haberse ido, pero se arrepinti y aparentemente esta cumpliendo con lo prometido. Ya ves que la otra no te pudo desplazar. Tambin te digo que  si uno se divorcia tan pronto ocurra la primera falta, todos tendramos una coleccin de divorcios. Imagnate que lo dejes y te cases nuevamente y este otro hombre te abuse fsicamente o cuando t no ests comience a tocar a tus hijos. Es como cambiar un horror por un terror pues uno nunca sabe que gran defecto tendr la prxima persona. Ya con tu esposo me imagino que llevaras un tiempo y los sentimientos se han profundizado.  Siempre piensa que nada es seguro en la vida. Lo que ves a tu alrededor tal vez no sea tal como sean las cosas en realidad pues este mundo es tan irreal. Detrs de una sonrisa quizs hay una mueca de burla y detrs de una cara seria quizs hay un corazn quebrado. El matrimonio ms feliz que veas tiene sus los en la privacidad de su hogar, pero salen y sonren y se toman de la mano. Lo otro que yo pienso, analizo y comprendo es que la vida es corta y no podemos arrastrar los malos ratos de ayer porque cada dia algo pasara y sino nos vamos a ir deteriorando con el rencor. Nacimos y vivimos, pero en realidad esto es un viaje y no le pertenecemos a nadie. Me parece que tenemos que vivir el dia de hoy, sin recordar mucho lo que paso ayer, ni preocuparnos excesivamente por lo que pasara ma?ana. A mi se me hace difcil comprender estas palabras que te digo, pero cuando el dolor o la ira me quieren consumir, leo mensajes de inspiracin que me ayuden a comprender mejor la vida y a superar los malos ratos. No es que no te ests valorizando, ni que te vayas a "dormir" y se te ran en la cara, pero recuerda, lo haces por ti, por tu bienestar y por tu paz interior.  Que los dias que te queden de vida no te amargues innecesariamente porque los dems siguen felices y tu misma no te vas a destruir tu propia vida con el rencor. No seas como yo|`|bd1d4b60e655e4538b8ef9d997883493aa	Ay, Amanda! Todas y todos entienden, pero si no lo pasaste, no saben en qu infierno ests metida. No es tan simple el "adis" para siempre. No es nada fcil encontrarse sola y creando hbitos nuevos en los que no est l presente. Ni su mundo, ni sus cosas contigo.   Hac las cosas a tu manera y como mejor te salgan.

Besos|`|4c0faedea365c7f182994311e3654c8baa	Nunca me ha pasado pero es interesante la situacion.   Suponiendo que estas en el momento justo que te pide perdon le hubieras preguntado que hubiera hecho si tu hubieras sido infiel?    Si la respuesta fue que te hubiese perdonado entonces esa relacion no tiene futuro, bien porque no le parece extra?a la infidelidad, porque no te ama o porque su amor es enfermizo.  Si la respuesta es que te hubiera dejado, preguntale porque deberias perdonarla, si trata de justificarse entonces tampoco es una buena relacion.|`|2214fece3438844ae3ec79e1d3cc4ee0aa	No te fies.... kien lo hace 1, lo hace 2, 3, 4.....

Si te sientes en capacidad de recordar sin dolor, es que puedes volver a confiar en la persona.  Pero cuando recuerdas y an te afecta y te duele, es mejor dejar la relacin; porque nunca dejars de sufrir.  Es cierto tambin que en todo esto, tiene que ver el tiempo.  Al principio, recordars a cada instante, con el tiempo, cada vez menos.  Si quieres dejar de sentir dolor, no lo calles; dselo a tu pareja, sin rencores, sin reproches; pero que l lo sepa y amerite tus esfuerzos por perdonar. Mucha suerte.

54654d3f3a805c789a46f3613aee45bfaa	Relax and enjoy his company.  You are way to young to be reading between the lines.  Transportation issues as well as schedules could be why you haven't had much time together.  Your parents still play a big role in your life as far as your free time is considered.  Hang out and enjoy his friendship.  Spend time with your girlfriends. You should be out having fun.  Soon enough you will be of age  to take on the added resposibility of a real relationship. Don't rush yourself. There will be enough pressure on you to make the right choices without you adding to what you have to deal with.  You do not need a romantic relationship to prove or be an adult.

It seems like this relationship won't last if you have already thought of breaking up. The question is how long do you want to stretch this? I'd say enjoy your carnival at the very least. As many people say honesty is the best policy so you should tell him at some point. If you stay in this relationship and then later on he finds out you started thinking about this in July, then the breakup may not be a good one. Were you friends before this? If so, that adds another dimension and hopefully you can stay friends. Good luck. I hope you make the right decision.|`|0744b89d54a03cbb0431344b1ea4954daa	You're young and have your entire future ahead of you.  Stay focused on your education.  If you're concerned about breaking his heart... that's very good that you care.. and you should.  However, being too serious at this time in your life can lead to some really serious choices that can change both of your lives forever.  Let him know (if you really mean it) that you care about him and yourself too much to make any commitments that would cause regrets later.  Tell him the love is still there, however, you both need to proceed slowly and carefully.  You both will probably continue your education and meet other people... or you may choose to travel, or train for a career outside of the state where you live.  Who knows?  But the point is at this stage in both your lives.. don't start something you may not be able to finish.     Continue your "friendship" on that level.  You can see each other from time to time, go out together or with mutual friends but don't let it progress past the "very good friend" stage right now.. otherwise you may be biting off more than you can chew, especially if you really aren't trying to go in that direction.  If you approach him with that attitude and those words  his feelings and yours won't be hurt.  Just be practical about it and remain good friends.

She even had that stupid head gear that they used to give you. As far as people making fun of you...That's going to happen to anyone. Kids are mean-and the reason they do it is because they're insecure about something themselves. Just ignore it, you have better things to do. Do't worry about the kissing thing-Huge unlikelyhood that getting tangled will happen-and the fact that he has braces too will probably put him a little more at ease. Just get the dumb things on and off as quick and painlessly as possible. You should feel lucky that it's not something worse like cancer! They'll be off before you know it.|`|AA11745756	Lots of popular kids at my school have braces. If they get tangled when you kiss your crush - then YOUR IN!! Don't you get it??

They can even have orgasms without ejaculating, allowing multiple orgams.     The problem: men have to be trained into it. It takes a lot of concentration and hard work.

AA11891612	first of all...no law in the world would make a 21 yr old male a minor! he won't need a parental advice from his parents if he wants to get married!! actually 18 yrs is already considered an adult...what more for a 21 yr old? i'm not certain about the law you have in Japan...but i think it's just crap! i got married & got pregnant when i was 20 yrs old...& right when that happened we're living in an Arab country which i would assume has the strictest religion in the world...but i never had any problem! when his papers come, ask your bf to go over to his parent's house & ask them to sign it...if they still wouldn't budge & sign it...there isn't much more you could do, is there?    now, my advise to you is...if Japan's laws would allow...give birth to your baby without getting married. then when you have the chance of going back to the philippines for a vacation, get married there & get your baby's last name after your bf. now if that's not possible...seek help from counselors, or lawyers as to what other possibilities are there available in cases like yours. ask them the best way for you to give birth hassle-free.    i wish you all the luck!|`|AA10166731	I hate when this happens....|`|4beaf671b28d4ea85ce401d3af24b2fcaa	To bad you cant go to the border and get married.

Goodluck Id just go to the Justice of Peace and get married. Atleast you dont have to have a big wedding right now.|`|c9c269ea850e86c5e7de1044e2b474bcaa	Just calm down and don't panic because that can make things worse.  Do you love your boyfriend? If you do, then thats all that really matters, right?  If you love each other than you will eventually be able to get married no matter what.  If his parents are considerate enough, they have to sign the papers sometime.  I know you're worried about the baby coming before you're married but maybe its best to wait until after it is born to do that, anyway.  I'm very sorry to hear about your sitaution.

fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	Well, if you have her name, google helps. It helped me find an old classmate before after I hadn't seen him in 10 years. Maybe an old email address or address. Send a note. If she's moved, maybe the new tenants know where she went and she left a forwarding address. But a romantic would say if it was meant to be then it was meant to be and she'll walk into your life again. Good luck. I hope you find her.

Men get to jail all the time just by slapping wifes in the face, or by pushing them, because the wife is hurting him in the first place, or because the wife was cheating on him. When is a women that attacks a man, nothing happens.    Some facts about testicle trauma:  -It may cause the victim to throw up.  -It may cause the victim to passout.  -It may cause testicular torsion, by initiating a muscle spasm; this is rare but is a medical emergency, testicular torsion may not happen immediately after the trauma.  -Testicles move freely and are slippery to avoid trauma, but if the trauma sustained by the testicle is hard enough (50Kg), the testicle will POP(rupture), and then probably must be removed. This is rare, and usually is associated with sport injuries when not wearing a cup. Even when can be repaired, the resulting inflammation will turn most of the contents into permanent damaged material.  -Even a medium force trauma will cause the destruction of spermatozoa-production cells. It will not cause sterility because those cells are in massive quantities, however those cells do not regenerate, it is permanent damage. And if hit many times or too hard, it may cause infertility, because the sperm count/mobility must be acceptable in order to get a woman pregnant by natural means.  -Will also reduce spermatozoa production as a result of hormonal changes, one of those changes is testosterone reduction.  -May rupture major blood vessels, and draining the scrotum will be needed. Or microscopic veins inside the testicles, this will permanently destroy cells indirectly.  -In case of very extreme trauma, the testicle/s can swell for more than a weak, with resulting excruciating pain and severe damage from prolonged heavy inflammation. The swelling reminds me of mumps, but in the case of mumps it will cause sterility for sure, and the testicles(usually just one) will shrink too, very sad and scary.  -In some cases may cause the antibodies to start attacking the person own sperm.  -It even may cause death as result of PAIN, heart will fail right away or will begin to fail(heart beat will became fast and irregular, usually face and lips very white) until finally stops, this is called neurogenic shock, and it is not that rare like people think, most of the times the victim is saved because gets medical attention on time, it will need shocks to the heart using the defibrillator!.  -Among other symptoms, the victim will feel shock/panic/confusion/anger, violated/abused, embarrassment/humiliation; those feelings will be stronger if young; especially if they do not know or never heard about kicking in the groin. The victim may seem ok, but will try to hide those feelings. It depends on the person and from the situation. This will lead to Post-Traumatic Stress, the worse symptoms may only reveal a year lather! People forget about emotional trauma, but it is the worse, and will not go away like the physical suffering. All men that like the fetish called ballbusting, have some kind of mental or emotional disorder; and the most common cause for that is because it happened to them in the past, they are physiologically very ill, it may change their lifes completely. The emotional trauma of being assaulted in such a private area, or the physical suffering, or the fact that it is a barbaric act, should be more than enough for girls not to do that; but the sad truth is that the only thing that make some(not all for sure) girls think twice before doing that is the permanent physical damage.  -Physical violence it is only acceptable if you are trying to defend/escape yourself from someone that is trying to use physical violence on you, and you may only use the necessary violence to ESCAPE harm. And kicking someone in the groin is only acceptable if someone is trying to kill you, or rape you(only extreme EMERGENCIES), not because you are pissed off, and most certainly not for fun like it is most of the times, keep it a fantasy. Why you girls dont tell your Dads what you did, I am sure they will be PROUD of you.  -Ironically, if someone is trying to kill you or rape you, probably is expecting that defense from you, and so you will not be able to kick him.  -This is becoming too popular, specially in schools, girls get sexually aroused by that!. Women look sweet, but.they are very mean and cruel by nature, they just try to hide it, it is very sad. Lucky for women men are not very vindictive like women are, and men are not very aggressive towards women like women are towards men, in fact men are very protective towards women. Men like to see and touch women sexual organs, they do not like to hurt them or to see it happen to women.  Women are so much sensitive about their sexual organs and sexuality, but then do that to men and laugh!  -And nothing happens to these sex offenders because they are women, just one of many double standards and laws that always treat men worse!    women justice is sick, how about if it was the other way around?!!!!!!!  Girls answers regarding this issue are always disgusting!

f79658efac82ddb237e340acd2d8d07baa	Instead of looking elsewhere to find the supposed solution to your problem you should talk with your wife to find out whether she feels the same about your boring sex life. If she agrees with you on that point, there are many things you could do to spice it up a bit. There are many online sites that suggest ways to keep boredom out of your bedroom.

AA11775796	Well first of all, ignoring her when she was obviously dressed up for you, and flirting with other women, and kissing and hugging other women, is NO WAY to show character.  Not to mention, that kind of immature behavior will probably send her running for the hills away from you.  Character means doing what you say, being open and honest, and treating other people with respect.  If you really want to get back together with your ex-girlfriend, start showing her some genuine attention - and mean it.|`|130dba6dd4565d3d900d63269b7ab29baa	I dont know...

We weren't sure of what we wanted and we were testing each other personalities until extreme since we were expermineting with how far our feelings can take us.. this is a stage and if you really respect one another, and be kind to each other, you'll make it through. Be affectionate, understanding and try to give her her space when she needs it.|`|AA10668954	You, show your character and don't play into her stupid & childish games.

92e1154cee03ed9e42a7d05f324eef62aa	Faccio parte di un'associazione che si occupa dei soggiorni dei bambini Bielorussi in Italia.  Tralascio l'intervento del ministro perch non  possibile parlare sempre e solo di leggi e problemi fra nazioni, esistono anche i sentimenti...  La cosa che mi preoccupa maggiormente , oltre alle presunte violenze avvenute in quell'orfanatrofio, il rischio che i futuri viaggi di salute che i bambini compiono ogni anno in Italia possano venir bloccati, visto che il presidente bielorusso non  mai stato particolarmente favorevole a questi viaggi, perch i bambini viaggiando per l'Europa si "occidentalizzano" troppo.  Pur comprendendo lo stato d'animo della famiglia italiana, l'ideale sarebbe stato lasciar rimpatriare la bambina e seguire dall'Italia gli sviluppi della vicenda, assicurandosi che la situazione all'interno dell'orfanatrofio sia veramente cambiata.  Tanti auguri a tutti perch la situazione possa risolversi per il meglio (della bambina, ovviamente)  Ciao|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	Ciao,  condivido la denuncia da parte della coppia di Cogoledo, ma sono assolutamente contrario a quello che hanno fatto.  La denuncia e la speranza che la piccola Maria, e non solo lei, possa avere nell'orfanotrofio in cui vive delle condizioni di vita umane e decenti  assoltamente condivisibile, l'attenzione dei media sia in Italia che in Bielorussia probabilmente aiuteranno a fare pulizia e ad aprire inchieste in questo senso.  Il nascondere la bambina in non voler restituirla   un'azione oltre che controproducente, pericolosa non tanto per Maria o per la coppia Ligure, ma per le centinaia di bambini bielorussi che vengono in Italia per 3 mesi di vacanze all'anno, e le altrettante famiglie che ospitano questi bambini, l'anno prossimo il Governo Bielorusso, dar ancora il benestare alle vacanze degli orfani in Italia? Occorre ricordare che ci sono centinaia di famiglie che sono in attesa di adottare (e non solo per 3 mesi l'anno come la famiglia Ligure) bambini bielorussi, che probabilmente sono in attesa da 1 a 3 anni, cosa sar dei loro ? delle loro speranze? devono dire grazie alla coppia di Cogoledo che sta cercando scorciatoie per diventare genitori adottivi?  Il Ministro Ferrero ha perfettamente ragione, Maria  una bambina Bielorussa, e giustamente per il Governo Bielorusso nessuno pu permettersi di rapire una sua figlia.  Occorre guardare pi in l rispetto al singolo caso, oltre a   Maria ci sono centinaia di situazioni tristi.  Il caso di Maria probabilmente aiuter altri a denunciare maltrattamenti e situazioni sgradevoli, ma purtroppo le famiglie Italiane che ospitano questi bambini non possono fare altro.  Ciao|`|fbaf47ca378619758a2d53c5361d7db3aa	Io avrei fatto la stessa cosa. Avrei rischiato qualsiasi processo pur di salvaguardare una bambina che  intenzionata al suicidio nel caso dovesse tornare in quell'istituto.

Il governo dovrebbe essere un po' pi "umano" e magari fare degli accertamenti prima di decidere il da farsi.

Perch se uno deve adottare un bambino deve avere un pacco di soldi, una casa gigante ecc. ecc. ....con tutti i bambini che rimangono negli orfanotrofi quando potrebbero avere una famiglia che anche se non ricca li accoglierebbe come dei figli, e quanta gente vorrebbe avee dei figli, non pu averli e per adottarli devi avere un santo in paradiso? ...Dai ma scherziamo!!!!! e sta povera piccola dovrebbe tornarsene da dove  venuta???

If you are not comfortable with chatting during sex, then don't.  The best you can do for him is to just let yourself enjoy what's happening and don't even think about whether you are making a sound or not.  Let yourself go.

AA10303765	I don't know just how you are differentiating between rough sex and rape; what is the difference in your mind. Also, you mention the unfortunate fact from the past, so was the rapist a stranger? If it was a stranger, is THAT what you want?    Not many men who want anything beyond sex in their relationship with you are going to want to hurt you. However if they do and this is what you both want, then this sounds more like a role-playing thing as opposed to non-consentual sex.    Without a more complete description of this situation, it's difficult to really see what you want. If nothing else, it sounds like whatever partner you have REALLY needs to have a good idea of what he's letting himself in for before you continue - be honest with him (it's a two-way street).|`|AA11280073	You need to get therapy to get over what happened to you. Otherwise, you will never have a happy and fulfilling life.|`|AA11589988	Oh sister.....You need to find the right man and there is someone out there for you. Don't think that you can never be happy because of this. You need a broadminded man who can help you deal with your sexuality in a loving way. He can play the role you need him to play and he will IF you let him love you too. You have to let a man love you.     Take care sister. There are men like me out there who understand women like you but what will hurt them is not your desire to be subjected to force but you not allowing them to love you too.     Maybe you don't have any difficulty letting a man love you and you can put this sexual fetish in a mental box and have a loving relationship too? If you can then you have no problem really except for finding that broadminded man and they are out there.|`|5220d75a1300551bc0e5a8de6aa97de6aa	Seems to me, seeing a shrink would be a good first step before ruining your relationship.|`|6dbd205140f02e3cfdf5718afeacdeb1aa	Please talk to a psychiatrist you can get a referral from a friend or teacher or collegue.    rough sex is ok, and fine like other fetishes. role playing "rape" with a lover is ok, which sounds liek what you would enjoy (me too) True rape is "unwanted sex".  If you like it, its not really rape I guess, sorry.|`|993678689677544b7b11aa0259f5440daa	god this is freaky... not that youre a freak but your all situation    anyway i know you ask guys but i have a retorical question for you  rape is when you do not want it  and your obviously craving for it so you would basicly be asking your boyfriend to do the cave man when your having sex I have friend who have much weirder fantasies  and that is basicly it enven if based on a really bad history and if you feel bad about it it is just a fantasy   so where is the problem in asking the men you love to fulfill a fantasy   he must have some as well if you talk about it both of your mutual sex lie should go up the roof  ;)|`|dbe80bd30efa212d90a0d7dc124a4c11aa	I stopped reading @ rape  I love hardcore sex  pen your legs back and bang bang bang

La quimioterapia afecta todo el cuerpo, e incluso las emociones, asi que antes de ponerte gallita con alguien asi, piensa que tu no tienes cancer y que no te estan tratando con algo tan fuerte como lo es la quimio  Yo entiendo que te sientas asi, y estas en todo tu derecho, pero no exigas y no pidas nada que no te merescas, porque desde cierto punto l tiene razn, si se siente mal no tiene porque estar soportando a nadie, aunque seas tu un verdadero angel...  Yo opino que mejor te las arregles sola, y que te des una vuelta a un hospital de oncologia para que veas que eso no es tan facil.|`|cbd80ba6190a2599bb66faca2761a91aaa	ten paciencia esta enfermo y lejos por otra parte piensa en su lugar aver como reaccionarias si el fuera el padre y tu no estas tomada en cuenta apesar de aver formado a sus hijos  dale tiempo y platica con el cuando ya este mas calmado no dejes que te grite ni maltrate pero supongo q tiene cncer por lo que dices de las quimioterapias   piensa como te sentiras si tu estuvieras enferma y como seria tu reaccin   suerte y paciencia|`|ca9aa95887adda180aac2a049c2d064caa	Tranquila.........creo que ests muy ofuscada en este momento para aclarar lo que kieres preguntar, mejor te recomiendo que te tranquilices y preguntes algo mas concreto.|`|abeefbfa542c6c2fcb9e273132d1c6beaa	Si le estan dando quimioterapias quiere decir que tiene cancer, y si tiene cncer debes entender que es una situacin demasiado trgica, estresante y l ha de pensar que es algo injusto que le pase eso a l; ha de estar muy sensible y por cualquier detalle que juzgue negativo o en su contra, explota, y contra quien lo hace? pues contigo, porque eres la persona mas cercana a l y a la que mas confianza le tiene, eres la persona con la que desahoga toda esa impotencia bastante justificada, no se lo tomes a mal, ponte en su lugar y piensa como te pondras t, si sabes que puedes morir y tu pareja no te incluye en esa dichosa lista de padres..no te sentiras aludida? aunque tu pareja no lo hiciera con esa intencin, t por la misma enfermedad y por el dolor y molestias fsicas que sientes, podras pensar mal de todos y reaccionar violentamente como lo hizo l, no crees? yo te recomiendo que le des un tiempo prudente, no le hables ni insistas ms en que te llame, dale su espacio y si en unos 3  o 5 das no sabes nada de el, entonces vuelve a llamarle y mndale la lista de padres con su nombre..aunque no te la haya pedido...|`|80db52b9c1aeb0ab63c27bb31839d3b5aa	Luna, te siento muy angustiada, trat de serenarte un poquito, y no te desesperes, a lo mejor te ests ahogando en un vaso de agua.

4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	What you want to do is not wrong or bad by any means. Even if you desire a younger woman solely for her sexual attractiveness. The reasons that people object to older men with younger women is cultural, and it is variable throughout life. My best friend's mother is 74, and her boyfriend (at the assisted care home where they live) is 95. Believe me, nobody points at this couple and 'accuses' him of dating younger women wrongly. Go to the other end of the spectrum, and you can see why there could be problems with a mere eight year difference: a 16 year old male dating an 8 year old girl, and so forth.    There is one more factor regarding why people get so upset: you are in competition with younger males, and they cannot compete with your income, stability, life experience, or wisdom. In Utah (USA), for example, where Mormons still have multiple wives  all usually quite a bit younger than themselves, there are legal provisions to allow young men to separate from their parents in order to better compete for women. As I recall, they are called the laws of emancipation.    Date or live with whoever you want, and allow everyone else to expel energy over being concerned. Or, wait until you're 90, and then nobody will say anything about you dating those "younger chicks."|`|AA11276475	Not all people call you a pervert...and none should.

If she has a bf she'll mention it.  If she is not interested in you she'll say somthing about her boyfreind even though she might not have one.  Then again if she wants you she might say "no" but really have a bf.  Hopefully he isn't 6'5 250 linebacker for a college team somewhere

If everyone thought they shouldn't date someone because they have children I would be alone for the rest of my life and for that matter so would my boyfriend and most of my friends.

Does this new found friend help you to get over your loneliness;   and is he good for your kids?  I think they are the factors that you need to consider to be the most important.    I guess what it comes down to, is what you want from your relationship with him.  If you are hoping for a long-term commitment from him, then you should by all means talk to him.   Tell him how you feel.   Tell him that you miss not being able to talk to him the way you used to be able to.   Ask him what he sees as being the future for you and him.   (Perhaps his taking on the extra responsibility was aimed at trying to make a better life for the two of you).  Anyway, unless you talk to him about it, you are not going to know.    I hope it goes well for you!!!|`|3d3b081575b38f91dcd769b90e4bd6d4aa	It is always best to discuss a matter rather than ignore it.  The real question is how much effort to spend on the converation.    If you really value this relationship, and want it to continue, then prepare for an important conversation.  It might go something like this:    I really value you and our relationship.  I want it to continue but I feel that you no longer have time for me.  I need to feel valued too and I want you to understand that and try to find time for me in your busy life.|`|AA10619473	If the friendship with this guy is something special to you (like you see him as a real friend) then I would make it a point to bring it up and let him know that you are worried about him and that you don't want to loose your friendship. Rather than forgetting it altogether.     More specifically I'd be careful how I broach the subject with this person because it might put someone on the defense. I know with myself the other person would have to say what they want carefully.     Perhaps you should say lets get together or somethign and when you are in private ask him how he's doing, and when he is done talking tell him that you've been seeing the stress in his features and in his voice and that you've been worried about him. That he means something to you and you don't want to see him hurt.    Thats what I would do in this situation. Hope this helps.|`|93313a8f7c25072bfa27d58053557570aa	Hi,  I would let him know that I'm missing the talks we had and tell him how I feel.  ..then ask him to give me a ring when he has time - without any negative or demanding undertone.    Good luck|`|d1ea42cadf8f6b4c80935b9ac7df46b9aa	It seems as though your friend's lack of attention has resulted from him taking on more responsibility on the job. Since you mentioned this and is aware of this, there should be no doubt that this is the reason his communication has been short and (you admit)sweet. I dont see any reason to forget the friendship, but you have to be more understanding. The next time you speak to your friend, express this by simply telling him, I know you have been busy, but I miss you..then come up with a scheduled date and time that you can get together with him. When people are busy, they tend to work more on a schedule. Until he gets used to the new responsibilities, be a true friend by being understanding and supportive.|`|af63fc6a20b098e2096942cb34d87ff3aa	i think that you should understand him and what he's going through right now. your friendship may mean more to him than you know and breaking friendship with him will only cause him additional stresses in his life. if you really care about him, you'd give him his space and just continue to remind him every now and then that you're still around for him anytime he needs you. that's what true friends are for.

Isn`t your daughter more important than sex? Your headed down a dead end road if you decide to procede with that type of behavior. Someone will get hurt, most likely your daughter. If she found out she would be devistated most likely, then you two would have trust issues on top of everything else. She might even be imbarrased in front of her friends to. Give your life to Jesus Christ, and make a real relationship with him and your daughter. The love Christ has for you is eternal, and unconditional. Stop hurting him by doing these things. Open your eyes, your heart, and your mind to him, you won`t be sorry. This is the best advice you will ever get, one day you will know that I spoke the truth to you. God Bless.|`|07f5e7793e3ad502fbad7fc2bbd75cb8aa	you had sex with your daughter's friend's mom while they were both in the house??? that is wrong. im ok with lesbians and all but when the friend and your daughter were both there at the same time...jesus christ you should know better. i dont know how old your daughter is but kids dont go to sleep when they are supposed to on sleepovers. that was very irresponsible of you and i think that you should really think if you are lesbian or not cus yes that would really f*ck up a family, and put your daughter in a kinda traumatized state. wut would you think if your mom had sex with your best friends mom?|`|fc6c0ef982b289e7914274d1280d35bdaa	If anything keep it to yourself for now. If you had a goodtime then you go girl. There is nothing wrong with being gay. As long as you don't freak out if your daughter goes gay when she get's older. If you have kids and doing soccer and all I'm sure your old enough to know what right decision to make. As far as family, it's your life and you only live once. I have a friend that was married for over 20some years and now she's gay. The family will freak out and no I'm sure they wont kill you. They'll get over it. If you like her and that's your sexual prefernce then go for it girl. But make sure its what you really want before you tell your daughter anything. You don't wanna tell her one day that your gay and then the next day that your straight. That'll confuse her. Good Luck to you :)|`|6059d81588c4312c78460b31a2971a44aa	Hey, what ever makes you happy! It doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks, it's your life. Not theirs. Sit down with your daughter when you're ready to discuss it with her and tell her your feelings. I'm sure she will understand. Just talk to this other woman first. As for your family, that's up to you when/if you tell them. Eventually they will know. It's how you tell them that is what you need to decide.

If you want to be with this woman, then do it.  I wish I could have the courage to take that step with a woman.  Your family should support you no matter who you love.  If you explain things to your daughter, then she should be ok with it too.  There are alot of gay/lesbian parents in the world.  It will be difficult for you and you will probably face some prejudice for it, but life is too short to live by someone else's rules.

91b6d988ce73301bb77def26adde5e48aa	men who are shy about sex usually lack the confidence that it takes to experiment with new things.  if one is not sure they are good at the basics it can be scary for them to try more advanced techniques.  if you are sure that this guy is the one and the relationship will be long lasting, you have time to take it slow.  pressure can make his performance even worse.  help his confidence level by praising his masculinity and sexual prowess after he has tried something different.  if you have to make comments that are not positive always use the word "and"; never but.  i.e.  that was great and it could be better if ....  when you say the word but the door of communication closes and it does not matter what you say after.  reassure him that no matter what the outcome of the play session you will still love and admire him and he will never have to do something he doesn't feel comfortable with a second time.  remember, men are about 75% ego.|`|AA11987197	Find out what he wants.

Nor should you have to change for them.  Keep looking for Mr. Right and when he is right you  won't have any complaints until you get married.
AA10515207	No, and I don't want to.  Judging by the antics of some of the people in my family who are still alive, I don't want to know about those who have already passed.

e8946d0f7e2560a39175a356cdca8a95aa	I think you handled that very well and in a very mature manner.  You were looking out for HIS feelings, rather than your own and that is a very admirable thing.    It really is pretty sad when you have to give up a good friend because their "significant other" is jealous of that friendship.  That person is not mature enough to realize that people of opposite sexes can be just good friends.  However, it would be extremely hard to be entirely comfortable about the whole thing.    He would have been stuck in the middle and his life would have been miserable because of it.  With any luck, given time, she will be confident enough of herself that she won't feel threatened by you any more and you and your ex can be friends again.|`|24330fe21e174f2ad6c9d286a42d8c72aa	SOME TIMES IT IS HARD BECAUSE THE NEW GIRLFRIEND FEELS LIKE SHE IS SECOND.

I'm sure you would'nt want your boyfriends ex hanging around all the time.|`|AA11380883	Your right, he should move on. If he truly loves you, he should be with you, not her...but I dont know the circumstances of the break up so...But, I personally believe that ex's can't truly be "just friends" because you'll both always think of your past relationship together which could spell trouble in the future.    I had the same problem with my ex. He always wanted to talk to his ex's and claimed they were "just friends". Long story short, he cheated on me and now regrets it.

AA12254468	What do you think?    What's the purpose of a strip club?  Cheap alcohol and great food?   No dear.  He's going to covet strippers.  Unless you share the same values as your boyfriend, it's time to stop dating.  Read, travel, experience many people and understand their cultures.  Never stop educating yourself.

As long as he's a distant watcher and not there to touch or try to hook up with anyone. Ask to see if it's okay to go with him! I actually went with my boyfriend to strip club and we had a great time together! I was more interested in the girls than he was!|`|f4fc076271fc31e0ab02174ab9947c7baa	once in awhile should be OK, but if it is a regular thing then I would say there is a problem...  If you don't want him to go, you should go with him once or twice if your not sure what goes on in there (yes many women go to the strip club) and try to do those things for him to keep him at home. If he is just going with some friends to have a good time (and again not on a regular basis) then it should be fine.|`|AA10819452	well i wouldnt allow my boyfriend to go to a strip club..unless i was with him.|`|ef346cf6d3f00e7a35df18f69c7b04b7aa	It's not ok for mine but if you're comfortable with it then let him go.|`|6f3387490b98743ecc6f5864aea1bf28aa	I don't think so don't let him because he cud cheat on u LISTEN 2 ME iight PEACE!|`|104ffab03e112893ed4d65a8d40bcdb3aa	Depends what age he is 25 and under I guess occasionally.

Don't be in too much control, it's not a good thing. Let him still be a MAN as long as he is YOUR MAN.     But at the same time, if it is something that honestly bothers you (other than natural insecurity) then this is the perfect time to have a talk and clarify boundaries for both of you.    I'm assuming this isn't a every weekend thing for him?? And there's nothing wrong with you insisting on going to a male review somewhere down the line. What's good for one is good for the other. Just make you both follow the same rules.     A cute tip or two to tell him, though. Ask him to bring his pocket calender with him. Because it's the only way he'll get a "date" out of those places. Also practice the museum rule: Look but don't touch, or you'll be paying for it!! Museums can be great, or on the other hand, they can be very expensive!! =P

2758ecd94bac2efbc8239eb2529404bfaa	1. Tell me about yourself.        My background to date has been centered around preparing myself to become the very best _____ I can become. Let me tell you specifically how I've prepared myself . . .       2. Why should I hire you?        Because I sincerely believe that I'm the best person for the job. I realize that there are many other college students who have the ability to do this job. I also have that ability. But I also bring an additional quality that makes me the very best person for the job--my attitude for excellence. Not just giving lip service to excellence, but putting every part of myself into achieving it. In _____ and _____ I have consistently reached for becoming the very best I can become by doing the following . . .       3. What is your long-range objective? Where do you want to be 10 or 15 years from now?        Although it's certainly difficult to predict things far into the future, I know what direction I want to develop toward. Within five years, I would like to become the very best _____ your company has. In fact, my personal career mission statement is to become a world-class _____ in the _____ industry. I will work toward becoming the expert that others rely upon. And in doing so, I feel I will be fully prepared to take on any greater responsibilities that might be presented in the long term.       4. How has your education prepared you for your career?        As you will note on my resume, I've taken not only the required core classes in the _____ field, I've also gone above and beyond. I've taken every class the college has to offer in the field and also completed an independent study project specifically in this area. But it's not just taking the classes to gain academic knowledge--I've taken each class, both inside and outside of my major, with this profession in mind. So when we're studying _____ in _____, I've viewed it from the perspective of _____. In addition, I've always tried to keep a practical view of how the information would apply to my job. Not just theory, but how it would actually apply. My capstone course project in my final semester involved developing a real-world model of _____, which is very similar to what might be used within your company. Let me tell you more about it . . .       5. Are you a team player?        Very much so. In fact, I've had opportunities in both athletics and academics to develop my skills as a team player. I was involved in _____ at the intramural level, including leading my team in assists during the past year--I always try to help others achieve their best. In academics, I've worked on several team projects, serving as both a member and team leader. I've seen the value of working together as a team to achieve a greater goal than any one of us could have achieved individually. As an example . . .       6. Have you ever had a conflict with a boss or professor? How was it resolved?        Yes, I have had conflicts in the past. Never major ones, but certainly there have been situations where there was a disagreement that needed to be resolved. I've found that when conflict occurs, it's because of a failure to see both sides of the situation. Therefore, I ask the other person to give me their perspective and at the same time ask that they allow me to fully explain my perspective. At that point, I would work with the person to find out if a compromise could be reached. If not, I would submit to their decision because they are my superior. In the end, you have to be willing to submit yourself to the directives of your superior, whether you're in full agreement or not. An example of this was when . . .       7. What is your greatest weakness?        I would say my greatest weakness has been my lack of proper planning in the past. I would overcommit myself with too many variant tasks, then not be able to fully accomplish each as I would like. However, since I've come to recognize that weakness, I've taken steps to correct it. For example, I now carry a planning calendar in my pocket so that I can plan all of my appointments and "to do" items. Here, let me show you how I have this week planned out . . .       8. If I were to ask your professors to describe you, what would they say?        I believe they would say I'm a very energetic person, that I put my mind to the task at hand and see to it that it's accomplished. They would say that if they ever had something that needed to be done, I was the person who they could always depend on to see that it was accomplished. They would say that I always took a keen interest in the subjects I was studying and always sought ways to apply the knowledge in real world settings. Am I just guessing that they would say these things? No, in fact, I'm quite certain they would say those things because I have with me several letters of recommendation from my professors, and those are their very words. Let me show you . . .       9. What qualities do you feel a successful manager should have?        The key quality should be leadership--the ability to be the visionary for the people who are working under them. The person who can set the course and direction for subordinates. A manager should also be a positive role model for others to follow. The highest calling of a true leader is inspiring others to reach the highest of their abilities. I'd like to tell you about a person who I consider to be a true leader . . .      10. If you had to live your life over again, what would you change?        That's a good question. I realize that it can be very easy to continually look back and wish that things had been different in the past. But I also realize that things in the past cannot be changed, that only things in the future can be changed. That's why I continually strive to improve myself each and every day and that's why I'm working hard to continually increase my knowledge in the ___|`|b4471c0dc1a0b131f920d608f2ade38aaa	There is book called "what is the colour of my parachute".

8284253a6cc3eae10d5138ac97837335aa	The Aries male is exciting, seldom dull and plans carefully for the future. Ambitious and hardworking, these individuals are ruled by the planet Mars and there is usually no holding an Aries man. Perhaps the most irritating fault of this male is his way of being contradictary, for he is usually very knowledgeable and heaven help anyone who gets their facts wrong. As an extremely masculine-oriented person, he looks for a mate who is "all female." Although he wants a girl who is intelligent, he does not want one who will "wear the trousers." Sometimes, there is simply no pleasing the Aries man, but he is very romantic at heart and once he has made his selection for a partner tends to remain constant and true. Marriage to an Aries male is wonderful...assuming the chosen woman can stand the pace. He prefers an honest approach and will immediately see through any pretence. First and foremost a creature of the body, the Aries male is strong and energetic with good posture, an erect carriage and irresistible sex appeal. He is a stylish creature and would never be caught dead in last season's fashions. The Aries man tends to fear the infirmity of age and the inevitability of death. Thus, he exudes an air of total self-assurance in order to compensate for this.    As a sweetheart, the Aries man desires to be the center of his loved one's attention and will most probably take it for granted that he already is. He will usually have a lot of women around him, with whom any potential mate will have to compete. He is fond of fun and can be charming when the mood strikes him. Flattery works with the Arian male because he can take any amount, provided he does not suspect that it is simply "a line." Once the Aries male is truly in love, he leaves no doubt as to his feelings. He is unlikely to be impressed simply by physical appearances. Intellectual stimulation is important to him and he is particularly taken with those who share his cultural interests. In the role of husband, he will be warm-hearted and virile, but prone to be somewhat "bossy." At home, he likes to be waited on hand-and-foot but, in return, stands always ready to fight for the best on behalf of his family. As a parent, he is a strict disciplinarian.    The Aries male is a man who is constantly in a hurry and one with his sights set on the future. In order to get along with him, it is necessary to fall in delightedly with all his plans and be ready to bestow flattery. He likes his women to dress in a feminine and pretty way, but they must be prepared to be thoroughly masculine in their attitude toward some aspects of life, such as driving the car, writing a letter of complaint or running a house or career. Above all else, he cannot stand muddle or fuss. To keep an Aries man happy, it is necessary to be totally organized. Though not afraid to take the initiative, this male does expect some backup from others should a conflict arise. He will win by any means necessary, but seldom stoops to trickery...he has a very strong sense of fair play.    The men of this Zodiac Sign make excellent lawyers and judges for their sense of justice and equality keeps them free from personal prejudice. Their arguments, being very sound and to the point, tend to carry much weight. They are also naturally gifted with a liberal amount of talent along architectural and inventive lines, as well as being lovers of science, art and music. Being self-assertive and a magnificent conversationalist, the Aries male possesses keen foresight and makes for a fine clerk, traveling salesman, speculator, banker or broker. No matter what the choice of employment, however, the Aries man, as a general rule, will be enthusiastic about the selected career and show a great determination to succeed. In the world of business, Aries males display wonderful push and energy. Being both venturesome and ambitious, they should associate themselves with those of a more conservative temperament who, while appreciating such inherent qualities, will serve to restrain the impulsive Aries tendency to leap before investigating the situation.    Aries males are usually quite successful in dealing with real estate for they are good financers, being keen and instinctively aware of potential opportunities. Cunning and shrewd, Aries men have a talent for money-making to a large degree, although they lack the ability to save any great amounts during the course of their lives. The Aries male is progressive and quick to demonstrate his ability to do good work. Thus, he tends to gain rapid promotion. The Aries nature is generally too enterprising in character for mechanical pursuits and there is unlikely to be much chance of success in any area which involves attention to detail. The Aries man refuses to submit to the dictates of others and may be aggressive and arbitrary when dealing with those who fall under his supervision. In other words, this male has a rather unpleasant habit of treating other human beings as though they were objects to be possessed.|`|6e31f31450af2f7d66f0497d03bdc440aa	Only a simpleton believes in astrology.|`|9f7b1cf10bacc1db84ca85a68ca341f5aa	http://www.astrology-online.com/aries.ht... does a much better job than anyone of us could give.

Dar un beso negro a alguien es lo que en ingls se conoce como "rimming" (lengetear los bordes del ano y el ano mismo)... Es excelente tanto para la persona pasiva (a quien le lamen el ano) como para la activa (quien lo lame)... slo hay que tomar en cuenta medidas bsicas de higiene, y recordar que el contacto con las heces de alguien ms podra acarrearte una infeccin (herpes o fuegos, o incluso hepatitis), as que hay que saber a con quin lo practicas.    La idea, si quieres intentarlo, es ensalivar y refrescar los bordes del ano -que tiene millones de terminales nerviosas- mientras repasas toda la zona con tu lengua hmeda, o incluso la introduces un poco, esto resulta sumamente placentero tanto sensorialmente como psicolgicamente.     Si eres lo suficientemente bueno, puedes lograr hacer llegar al orgasmo a alguien tan slo con un beso negro bien hecho (que puede durar literalmente horas...). Puedes variar las sensaciones si te metes a la boca una pastilla de menta o yerbabuena y luego lames el ano, o si inmediatamente de lamer soplas un poco para refrescar la zona...|`|6951dd1b570c7dbf7ecf92f08a3e35c1aa	sexo  oral al ano de tu pareja... solo hazlo cuando  sea alguien ke reralmente amas y ke deseas experimentar algo totalmente nuevo..  :)|`|d52ae268966385be32a8528eaff4231aaa	Chiquito!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  un beso negro es   lo mas lindo q le puedes dar a tu novia, llenala de besos, exactamente es lamer su clitoris. un consejo pidele q se depile antes. un beso iluu. y disfruta disfruta !!|`|39c0e1dfbe43912fcef56e14b81c15cbaa	Es una forma del sexo oral.

AA10036105	Your site looks good.  It takes a while for a site to become popular.  It is important that it stay up for a long time.  Sites that remain for 2-3 years get much better search engine inclusion than new sites.    Just stay the course and your traffic will pick up.  When it does...   your ISP will hit you up for bandwidth charges!    Don't compare yourself to Yahoo!.  Yahoo! has been on the net for a long time.  I've been using it since 1996.  Yahoo! offers a wide range of items that attract users, from news and weather, email, etc.    I joined your site- thank you- and I noticed that the page where I gave my desired passwords is not encrypted.  It should be.  Get a certificate and implement SSL.    It seems that your site has a 'singles' feel to it.  That can be nice, but it is more narrow than Yahoo's big tent, and will cause some folks to turn away.|`|56e9b31ed0009865d906d2628ac0f438aa	Dont get despaired   things will pick up for you im sure   it just takes time as all things do..........

There may be something such as lust at first sight or desire at first sight, but love at first sight is a romantic, poetic ploy for the weak-minded.    You can you love somebody just by looking at them when you don't know who they are? Are they a good or bad person? Are then criminals, or psychos? How can you know? YOU CAN'T!    So, call it whatever, but "love" would not be accurate. I have found that those who think love at first sight exist are usually those who are so hard up for attention and affection, and lacking self-confidence so that look at any opportunity to receive fulfillment and gratification by grasping for relationships.    TX Guy|`|35b117f78f74f8ec8ad0a350c69e3b31aa	No.  plain and simple no|`|AA11488201	yes|`|c64ff39aa97180da473419a2bdeee759aa	There is lust or infatuation at first sight.

I believe attraction to someone physically is just lust. It's the mind we are attracted to makes us fall in love with someone. After all the Brain is the biggest sex organ! To really experience love, we need to get to know the person, how they think, how they feel, their opinions, how they behave. Physical attraction is temporary. Mental is what lasts.|`|96fd6254c0dd60327c49935df7f385e8aa	Yes|`|d628b79aa189132128996b6ceaeb2761aa	Dear Lost Lonely Girl,  I believe a person can feel something akin to love on the first viewing.

What do you mean by dedicate a nice song to you? he wrote that song himself?|`|4c31de55b0f05ba1b98eb8e47070213caa	OK, by the sounds of it he realized that you are from another country.  And he probably thought that it was very difficult to have a serious relationship with you when you both are from different countries.  Sure you could spend 6 months together, but he probably wasn't hoping for just having a relationship for 6 months.  He probably wrote that song to tell you how he feels which you began to understand his feelings towards you.  He probably wrote this song in a last attempt to get you to stay with them.   If so he probably would have continued to hint his strong feelings towards you.  Yet, you left and went home,  therefore the man was heartbroken and decided that he is better off just finding another girl.  Only because you both live too far apart.|`|5a9372f6cd665d54db47a99755840562aa	he might have not called because he maybe lost your number.   he sounds as if he is really shy believe it or not 99.9% of guys are shy and dont knoe how to express their feelings. if i were you i would pluck up the courage to call him and just ask him are you interested in me or not. because if you dont call him you will never know what was meant to. i was in a similar situation to you three years ago. i really liked this guy and didnt really know how he felt about me. we were out for a drink with friends one night and he kissed me and we were dancing all night and then after that night i never heard from him even although he told me he liked me. so after 6 or7  weeks without hearing from him i called him and asked him what the score was. and it turned out that he was shy and didnt know if i felt the same way about him, so he didnt call incase he made a fool of himself.   and ever since that day i called him we have been a couple and we are getting married in october this year.  so take the chance and call him or you will nver know what is meant to be.

Rather, he's a user of you...  Hard to believe that people like you could be used by an assho_e, right?  Too bad it's true.  Been there.  Don't trust the fu_k.  Crush him in his own garbage dump.

I'd do it|`|895fe5072c2dd1326ba82b1fadce9c87aa	if you wanna do it, do it.    I for one have no interest in such things.

MFM, and your boyfriend might get jealous. FMF, and you might be upset.  You need to have a very strong, understanding, and supportive relationship.  Most men can not handle seeing the woman they love be penetrated and involved with another man.  If this is a fantasy of yours, think it through.  They are called fantasies because we think of things that are out of our reach (physically, emotionally, financially, etc).      If you've thought it through and still want it, go for it.  Be aware that your relationship may sour afterward, that the experience may not live up to your fantasy, that your BF may be bisexual, and that he might ask you for a fantasy of his own.  As for him looking at you the same way, He won't.  With a 3some, you will cross a boundary that you can't cross back.    Whatever you, be safe and have fun.|`|729b3119ac6ed2596678e63d0b459014aa	Well it seems like you would be uncomfortable with the whole threesome idea. If your going to be uncomfortable with it even if its just a little bit then don't do it.     Do you know if your bf is bi curious? If he is then that could mean the answer to your fantasy. If he's not then he could end up rejecting you after wards. It's a fine line that no one should try to walk on in my opinion. If you have a good relationship then why bring someone else in it just for a night of sexual fun? Is your relationship really worth it?     He could also have another motive. Maybe he's thinking that if you go in with him and another guy, then he can go in with you and another girl. I think if you go through with it some one will end up being hurt. I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|df7ba07d0265586ab72131950bb1e316aa	then leave him i kind of having the same problem to because he wants to have someone and me ******* him.|`|fc90764e52cef7b7b11459fbb8cbf182aa	Well, all I  can tell you is that my husband has been asking me the same thing for about a year and I finally gave in.  We had a MFM 3some and it was awesome.  My hubby was not jealous at all and enjoyed watching me with another man.  Please give this serious thought, though, because if you both are not completely comfortable with the idea, it will not go well and could ruin your relationship.  If you do decide to go through with it, set ground rules that you are both comfortable with. And above all else, be sexually safe, i.e. use condoms.

But if she does, then ask her out on the way home from the movie, it's almost a garrenteed yes if she held hands with you earlier and was fine with it. I'm sorry if it's a no, but odds are with it being yes. It would be a lot more strange if she had no clue who you are than if you are friends. I say go get her, she hopfully likes you back. Give her something with a little note on it, and that would be how I suggest to ask her out.|`|2bab7047ef7c34f7d4027e5d8a7eff79aa	no its not wrong to get her a gilf if you are friends already. take her out somewhere really nice. read more on love, dating and relationships to help you more on this site
a7c6ee8570b7aa608580bef0382bd952aa	This is not always true. There are some fairly ugly people who have and act the same way as the beautiful people. You need to open up your eyes and see that what some see as beautiful others see as shallow. The saying " You can't judge a book by it's cover" holds true today. I'm a beautiful big woman and Many men see me as just that. Not the fat lady over there, but the one who has a lot going for her. I tell people that I enjoy being alive and live my life by a few rules. The first being that life is fun, no one wants to be around a sad person. I live, there is only one life and we should live it.

Find an opportune time when things are not getting in the way and start the conversation with how much her friendship means to you.  See where she takes it. A girlfriend is easier to find than a really good long term friend so dont screw up the long term friend thing.  Let her know that you are developing different fellings than you have had and why.

When thinking about him makes you forget about all other stressful situations.  Being in love is defined by good conversation and good company.  Its not so much sex, but more about respect and appreciating all aspects of each other.  Being in love eliminates all doubts and insecurities because you know that you are his everything and he is everything to you.
1497961fbaf99a6c2a14178fab6832f6aa	I love this question.  Thanks for giving the background of how the term "good girl" came up in your own situation.    Good, according to Roget's Thesaurus, can be synonymous with having desireable qualities, suited to one's purpose, not more or less, having the ability to perform well (Hmmmmmm), to one's liking, etc.   Some good, some bad connotations.  It really depends on how your ex views you.    What does good girl mean to me?    A good girl:  Love's her mama, loves Jesus, and America, too.     A good girl:  Crazy bout Elvis, loves horses, and her boyfriend, too!    [That's from Tom Petty]    Notice there's no mention of virginity at all in that song.

Voc j percebeu que, sozinho, ningum consegue ser feliz por muito tempo?   Por isso,  n?o adianta querer educar seu filho dessa forma pois, caso ele n?o seja homossexual, poder ser um cara frustrado com as mulheres. A maioria delas desaprovam esse tipo de homem (os comentrios provam isso).    A mulher precisa cultivar a sua beleza, gosta de se sentir objeto de desejo  e ser motivo de disputa. E o cara que quiser conquist-la de se mostrar msculo e capaz de lhe proporcionar o prazer que ela deseja. Ela gosta de ser possuda, sentindo que tem um dono que cuida dela e n?o deseja divid-la com ningum. Isso  instinto. Na realidade, um pouco de machismo (moderado,  claro) agrada as mulheres.

e5dcf204d50e005d261ad890c01278c2aa	People will be people. You have no control over them but you have control over what you say and do.    Make it your goal to have more friends, from which you will have more choice. Sometimes, friends choose you; you do not choose them.    In the mean time, be polite yet firm and resolute when they do try to be annoying. Play along to know them better and find out they way they see you, but be aware if it starts to show signs of getting out of hand. That is your cue to leave for class or something, more importantly, your cue to move on with life by getting on your studies, make more friends and get to do the things you enjoy.|`|AA11085415	It's not only petty but stupid. Ignor them and find real friends.|`|52c6efd2a28acae483cd9a08949f7789aa	just ignore them|`|AA12083470	Kill them with niceness.  It will drive them crazy.|`|3d291501c7b6d3c3ffbfcf93aaf0bd93aa	Grow up, they aren't worth it. Be the bigger person and stay away from them. Don't waste your time. It hurts, but that will pass. Girls can be such b-itches sometimes.|`|3e3e62517150959968d9185882de85ebaa	I love sweet sweet revenge,  I would recomend spreading her most embarassing seceret around,or maybe beat her @ss.   But in any case you really can do both. Be the completely innocent little girl who could do no wron at school, only this b**ch will see what you are really up to.   Start out with beating her @ss, and when she goes to tell on you, if you keep up the innocent facade, no one will believe her.   Next steal her boyfriend, or crush or something along those lines, and then inconspicuously drop some horrible rumors around the school,  But a warning must be placed, Karma always comes back threefold.   So you make your own choice, you might come to find out to just let it go, and watch all her friends backstab her for what she has done to you.  Good Luck,   Listen to a little psycopathic, they have some good advice too.|`|6ed4abd7fe9aa7352a3762d2241f5110aa	Well, none of them are really your friends.  Just go on with your life and don't bother with her.  She's not worth your time.  Biggest payback would be that what she did, doens't even bother you. Say Hi when you see her, but thats it, keep walking.  Be the bigger person, you will find friends that are true to you.|`|a7db2b7a728fb2b78bfebc142ef2e9beaa	talk it out with her, ask her why she hates you and see if theres anything you can do to help the problem.   If the situation worstens tell a teacher about it   hope this helps   with love,   Fiona   fftc06@yahoo.com  Ah I see there not your friends..  Well just ignore them then, and if they say something to you agian, just be so nice to them, it will drive them nuts! And eventually they will leave you alone|`|AA10861015	Just say, "okay". And leave it at that. Don't let it bother you. You don't control her immature emotions. Don't pay her back because that would be giving her the control. She has given control of herself to you, and you can either use it or abuse it. Don't fight fire with fire... just let the fire burn its self out. You will be the bigger more mature person for not reacting in any way, shape or form. Go watch the movie, "Mean Girls" in the end, there's no reason for these stupd games teenage girls play with heach other. I hope this helps you put it behind you, and move on with more important things.|`|45d5cfe1820e8360e1e6bcdc82307f08aa	Just find new friends. Just ignore those other people. Probably they'll stop talking to you when you ignore them or hang out with other people.

I thought it's being said that gals should prefer a guy who's in love with her than a guy she loves. Never thought guys would think that way too. So.. it doesn't matter if you're a gal or a guy, everyone wants to be loved and would prefer to be with someone who loves them back. Personally, I can't be someone who doesn't love me and can't imagine being with someone I don't love.|`|ad689d10fad4c129cf8b1c1c6b8a7f0faa	what is love?  only your heart start beating but the mind refuses to work. everything else other than the one you love will not seems to be important. the love what you call is just a FEELING. we feel hungry to eat, we feel thirsty to drink, etc love is also like a feeling. it is a temporary exhilaration. every man/women will under go 2 stages in cyclic manner(once in 3 or 4 months) emotional high stage(EHS) emotional low stage(ELS) when both the partners are in EHS they feel like they are in love. both will try to keep the love going by building a castle on feelings. after some time when they are in ELS they feel like not loving each other. it is called as "trapped syndrome" so why to FALL in love like falling in to a pit? instead of it why can't we GREW in love? true love is Commitment , will to stay togather AFTER MARRIAGE|`|AA11853429	i would have to agree with answer 1 cats.....

BUONA VITA  WALTER|`|baed6e5da7182ff733cadb76b60a69f8aa	Il vero Dio e` quello che non commercializzano le religioni scrivendolo sui libri sacri. Il vero Dio e` quello che si conosce in spirito e verita`, senza tanto chiasso. Il vero Dio e` quello che non ha soldati fanatici di parole e azioni per difenderne i diritti. Il vero Dio non appartiene a nessuna religione ed e` di diritto anche di un ateo, che magari e` ateo solo perche` rifiuta tutto questo fracasso esteriore religioso. Il vero Dio non lo monopolizza nessuno. Il vero Dio sta certamente dalla parte di chi lo cerca per tutta la vita con sincerita` di comportamento umano. Il vero Dio l'uomo lo conosce molto bene, ma gli stessi uomini gli hanno confuso le idee con monopolizzazioni religiose. Il vero Dio e` a due passi da un ateo, perche` almeno lui e` sicuro di essere sempre sulla strada della ricerca, mentre i religiosi si stanno compiacendo nell'illusione di averlo trovato per sempre.   Beati coloro che nella loro umilta` hanno ancora il dubbio di non aver trovato Dio come si deve, perche` un giorno si accorgeranno di essere stati sempre in felice compagnia.  Non chi dira` " Signore, signore " entrera` nel regno dei cieli !  Le religioni non si integrano se non dubitando di aver trovato definitivamente il vero Dio, ma questo non lo potranno mai fare nella loro superbia dommatica.....ecco perche` Dio a volte sta lontano da loro, anche se credono di scannarsi in suo nome. Nessun ateo, credo, avrebbe il coraggio di scannare un essere umano per vantare il proprio Dio: ecco perche` Dio e` ad un passo da queste persone ragionevolmente corrette.  Non sono ateo, ma preferisco questo ateo, perche` sono convinto di poter percorrere la strada umana pacificamente insieme.|`|211b806a356a1d941d29769817e5b18baa	l'ateo----sta guardando come si scannano e spera di non andarci di mezzo!|`|ffa6270704913722caee7c068bef3f0baa	Il Dio  uno..... che lo chiami Dio, Allah, Jav, Buddha, o in qualunque altro modo.|`|af27275707e668bafe1314e50337fcc8aa	Io penso che Dio si sia manifestato nel modo in cui meglio poteva essere accettato.

2befc29d78d9aa0a66b020ff091c95bcaa	Seems to me that your hubby and his mom have been having problems even before you came around. So dont take it personal if she says she doesnt like you. I am sure she does, but right now is having problems accepting her disagreements with her son. One thing you shouldnt do is tell your hubby to patch things up. Hes going to have to decide on his own time when that is going to happen. The fighting needs to stop but the only ones that can make that happen are the ones that are doing it. Shes mad because she wanted her son to be somthing that hes not and shes blaming herself for the direction hes taken. Even if the direcetion is not wrong she will see it as wrong because its not way she wanted it! So instead of showing that she failed (which she didnt sure hes a great man)shes taking it out on him, hopping he will do what she thinks is best, even if its not what he thinks is. They just have their own oppinon and seem to have a lot of stubburnest in them and thats why they are bumping heads like this. She needs to stop yelling at him and taking out on him and you because hes choseing something differernt than what she wanted, and hes got to understand that his mom loves him a lot and wants whats best for him. And he needs to listen to her , doesnt have to do what she wants but just hear her out. Good luck and i am sure they will end up realizing what they are doing is just a waste of breath and that they need to compermize and meet in the middle for this to all stop!!|`|cb41d5c23ca37f5dcfa845618b4f9e28aa	CREATE SOME DISTANCE FROM THESE PEOPLE.

Good luck.|`|AA11103881	It's time for your husband to put you first. When you get married your spouse needs to come before anyone else--including parents and children. If your husband is siding with his mom there's a problem. Talk to him about this (when you're both calm) and tell him how it makes you feel to be put second. Also, I'd suggest reading the book "The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work" by John Gottman. It's got a LOT of great tips. Good luck!

I think that the only stable way to get through such huge stormy news as the one she stumbled onto about you....is to go for marriage counselling and ironing it out until you have reestablished that trust.    Without trust, you might as well be in those porn flicks again... because correct me if I am wrong, but the deeds you do in those movies are NOT done out of love and care......    You need to prove it to your wife exactly HOW and WHY she is different than the girls in your movies. And that kind of discussion is best held in a counselling session.

AA11820856	The trick to fishing is only keeping what your really want.  I think that if there are alot of lonely people in the world they choose that way of life.  There is the right person out there but you have to test them to find the right one.  You never know if the one that you think would be perfect may have flaws that you never realized.  The reason that is seems hard to find each other is because you have to work at it.  They are out there and probably just walked by you recently but you never took the time to take off the blinders and look around|`|AA12065549	I'm alone....|`|AA11939205	it's all the little nibbling that we do at each relationship. we grow and find it harder and harder to find someone who can fulfill all our needs and wants! as you get older, that gets harder....    good luck!|`|2b3eeb86bc8d64e12f3c71ade9c771eeaa	That is the "miracle" of Love.

(except guys, we're always looking or looking to improve, lmao) But seriously, there are special circumstances for two people to fall in love and those don't come by every moment of the day, there are variables : the place, the time, your mood, what you're occupied with at the moment, gosh seems like hundreds of variables.

In my experience, I would much rather  meet a woman online and provide her the choice of contacting me.  My past few girlfriends have turned out to be insecure, jealous, manipulative and psycho.  Online gives me a chance to get to know someone without all the drama and maybe in the future we might meet, but it is safe and I can usually get a feel if the woman is worth something by what subjects she likes to discuss.  That's my perspective.   I can't speak for all the other men out there.

ba808642a0667193fc002c2bbda18db5aa	I'm sorry for your loss and that you're still grieving.  In a sense, you will always grieve.  But that doesn't mean that you won't enjoy life again.  You must remember that your boyfriend would want you to be happy, he'd want you to continue to pursue your goals, to take care of yourself, and to surround yourself with people who care about you.  The trick may be in figuring out who cares....because as you've discovered there are alot of people that have their own agenda, that will never see your needs as important, and will try to take advantage of you.  I suggest you read as much as you can....books related to widowhood, grieving, death and dying, etc.  I know it helped me to read books that were pertinent to my situation.  I am a young widow and I will never stop missing my husband.  You're basically in the same shoes.  Forgive yourself for making the wrong choice in men following his death as that's a common and easy mistake to make.  Solitude is actually something that I enjoy now and I hope you'll eventually learn to enjoy solitude and being alone with yourself.  Lean on your friends and family for support, sometimes they understand what you need more than you do yourself.  It's okay to talk about your late boyfriend--others will understand the reasons why you want to do so.  Your situation has changed drastically through no fault of your own and you have to develop a life that works for you.  There's a certain amount of freedom (and fear) that goes along w/developing that life alone, but you must develop the self confidence to make it work.  You don't have a choice and you're stronger than you think you are.  You owe to those that love you.  Good Luck|`|d70c37c358dd2fe3a19721423771a632aa	You can not replace someone you love.

Late at night i start going to police stations. there was no record of him being arrested.

If it's been going on for awhile, it's not going to go away on it's own without medication. You may even need to go talk to someone. Medication is not a bad thing.

You see all these beautiful women and compare yourself to them.  Your b/f probably made the comment about how an actress is good looking and it gave you a complex about yourself.

No, I'm sorry to say that, but it's true.  You need to stop being so concerned about how you look- or don't look- and start counting your blessings. If you can't do that, then maybe you need to see a psychologist.  You may have a condition called body dysmorphia, where a person becomes so obsessed about their appearance that it may completely take over their life.   So... do you want to get over yourself and live your life, or do you want to take the "disease" road and start going to shrinks? It's your choice.  Decide how you want to be.

AA11537569	Maybe you give it up to easily.  If you give it up the first time you meet a guy, they begin to think (yes, men do think) that you probably do this with every guy you meet.  So don't be so quick to get into bed with these guys.  You can smell your own vagina by sticking your finger down there and if it smells then you know you need to step up your hygiene.|`|AA12338431	Maybe your bad in bed?

I mean you must be more or less attractive or you wouldn't be getting as much as you seem to be.|`|AA11116375	TAKE A SHAWER|`|d79f90edad43b491ee5a31d6fe334460aa	its not a bad vagina its bad guys.im sure your as fresh as a daisy|`|448d198d24c811562a101c4c77aa5fa1aa	I wouldn't say that they don't call back because your vagina stinks. If it did most guys wouldn't touch you at all. And if that's the case then your doctor should be the only man or woman that you should be trying to see. Maybe ur giving in 2 soon. If that's the case then slow down. B4 u get physical, ask him what's gonna happen between u 2 after u 2 have sex. If he gives u a bs answer then leave his bs @ss alone. Other than that, listen 2 ur first instincts and not ur hormones.

3114df4cdd050e29f9a1d5a4d320d15daa	One of the challenges you face is that people who are jogging (or in the midst of any exercise routine) may not really want to interrupt their routine for a conversation: doing so throws off their pace and also can cause the body to stiffen up, get chilled, etc. If you happen to know where he starts or ends his run, that would be the easiest place for him to chat.    Otherwise, begin to say hello to him  as he runs by. A nice smile, and a warm hello. Commenting on the weather is always a safe way to verbalize without being pushy (nice night, great weather to be outside, etc).     If you're up for it, ask him if he's got time for a quick question, and then tell him you've been thinking about taking up a little running yourself, and could he recommend a good brand of shoe (the most important thing!)...or a good store to buy your gear at, how to begin a running schedule, etc.     And then...think about taking up running yourself, if you're interested...he'll begin to look at you a little differently then, and it would provide the segue for some follow up 'newbie' questions.    If the interest or curiosity is mutual, this should be enough to get off the ground. Good luck!|`|ec55e11479befaf18866e39b61b807fbaa	ask him can you see his peckerwood|`|52c6efd2a28acae483cd9a08949f7789aa	just have a normal conversation with him and see where it goes|`|AA10793321	You could stop him and ask him a work out question.... i.e how do you get faster at running at strike up a conversation.|`|a63cc1858e5e699ccc4d28c10c17dae1aa	Just ask him where he is from and just talk to him like you talk to anyone else, I mean he is not going to bite you|`|8e8c0c75b8d2bb23056c1243381afb0caa	I am in a similar predicament myself at college with a girl, but I would advise to ask why he is jogging, like if he is doing it for a sporting or charity event (jogging is a good subject because you know it is one of his hobbies) or just say you have seen him jogging and introduce yourself. what is the worst that could happen? and good luck. remember if you dont know him, you have nothing to lose.    Also, if anyone could please help with my question in love I would be very gratefull, search 'grand gesture' or click my name for more details.|`|545ad80df5ce0d38dd236944a4ed9ce3aa	just say hi everyday.  eventually he will stop one day.    if all else fails. trip him.    but really saying hi is the only thing you should have to do.|`|87f426355bd7bd1bc81a2a0460753fefaa	Find some common interset you both have and start talking!|`|f51736761a56eefb7391207381c8245baa	Well you could ask him where he jogs to or if he knows any great shoe places to get new jogging sneakers. If those don't work jog over to him and ask if he wants jogging partner. If he doesn't then just ask him his name and say see you around and hopefully someone you know has his number and then you are good to go.|`|c83d132f83f368c142fc2a0d5a26dccdaa	Simply walk up to him and say hello I'm (whatever your name is) i have noticed you jogging a few times and I thought i might as well strike up a conversation.  then just go from there if he's interested he will gladly talk to you if not no big loss.  Take the chance.  I've found that people never regret taking a risk or a chance even if it doesn't turn out the way they want, a person only regrets never taking that chance.|`|8c0ee1860b5ae27b7b808ede1ea93158aa	you dont look desperate with any question asked unless you pop the question, you know, ask anything i quite frequently ask questions of ladys i see and 99% of the time get a good response i say just do it and dont worry do it
AA10059273	Hello There !!! My Step Father Died of (Throat Cancer) about Three Years ago & he was a Re-Tired Chief Master Sargent...When my (Father) was in the United States Air Force, He was stationed in (France) My Mother already had (Five Kids) When my Father met my Mother He feel in LOVE with her & they both Decided to get Married. when my Step Father Married my Mother he was at the (Tender Age) of (Twentytwo- 22years old) There are not alot of (Fathers) out there that would take on a Family of Five Kids at the age of ( 22 yrs old) May he rest in (PEACE) The  United States Air Force gave my (Father) a  21 Gun Salute... I 'am soo (Proud) of my Father... I call my (Step Father) My (Father) because he really stuck around & was there whenever any of the (Kids) needed him for whatever reason/s... It takes a (Special Breed Of Man) to take on any Family irreguardless wether it is his (Biological Family) or not, it really does take a (Special Man) to fill the shoes of being a Father... I want to tell you something,If my Father were still (Alive) in the flesh, he would (Truly) be with you very Fine Soldiers in Afghanistan & you (Soldiers) over there would have loved my Father as a (Very Fine Soldier) God Bless all of you (Soldiers in the Middle East !!! I pray that all of you (Soldiers) come back home (SAFELY). God Bless You Soldier !!!   rumeoui !!!|`|42fab8258e6803f77e157a97c6e7bc72aa	I would honestly say that time well spent with your children will help them develop emotionally, mentally and physically. My father was never really around and now that I am older and married he wishes he had spent time getting to know me. Society has so much influence on both women and men these days, it's a good idea for you to spend time doing what they like to do (even if it makes you feel like you're a kid yourself) and talking to them about anything. Go beyond the norm (toys, video games, theme parks etc.) and take them to a ballgame, hiking, swimming etc. since these activites promote conversation, attention and productivity & fullfillment. I would say my father was special because he showed me how to be both feminine and strong. I can walk into Home depot and tell you every thing about installing cabinets, doors, locks, even redoing your basement. I am all woman all the time, can cook a mean beef stew and re tile a bathroom and use a tile cutting machine all in a days work. (Damn my husband's lucky!) Anyway, Brainstorm!  Good luck.|`|f2c1dfdbdea5674fea53580ad5ffc176aa	I'll be 18 in Dec. My dad died when i was 5. Even though I was really young, I know how much he loved me. He died sticking up for me. I know if he were still alive, he wouldn't be like the rest of my family, he wouldn't care who I love, he'd be here and support me no matter what. I really wish I could have grown up like a normal kid, going to the park with him, having him push me on the swings, teaching me how to drive, looking out in the audience from my graduation stage and seeing him there smiling...I'll never experience any of that, but being alone all these years has helped me to find myself and appreciate who i am. Even though he's not here, he will forever live in my heart.|`|35e4bda9baefdff932394681bb6d0c6daa	My husband became a dad to my 4 children and raised them to be good thinkers. I feel my husband is special because when one of my sons went to visit his dad after 8 years he called up crying about whatever it was that his bio did.

My son is now in Germany after leaving Iraq and when he has trouble with his feelings he will call my husband for advice.|`|b0bf561a07abe3b5d4eb778a2270bfbbaa	My daddy always fixed me soup when I was sick.

Well, don't say it that way, just tell her to get together and catch up on the old times. On the date you'll see how it is going and if you wan't to stay in touch or not.   I don't know, it feels like you want more from her than to "bond with friends", well not really you still want to bond but on a different level... :) This doesn't really come off in your question, yet the drives that lead you to these steps might indicate that.   The stuff mentioned above would indicate that you have a fear of rejection and that's why you are moving at such a slow rate towards your goal.  If you find out what's your and her stance regarding your relationship, you'll feel much better. Sometimes the direct way is the ideal, so just ask her out, and stop trying to 'read between the lines'.|`|fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	How interested are you? If  you are really interested, go for it and tell her. How long has it been since the two of you last called? College is a real busy time. She may have had a huge assignment that week. Give it some time there. Some people don't really go on MSN and Caps lock could just be the way she likes to type. I think you should give it some time. I don't think she's mad at you, just busy with college stuff. Maybe she did like you back in high school but I doubt she'd be that mad after two years. She's probably had at least one relationship during college. Anyways good luck. If things don't work out, there are other girls and other classmates who you can probably email.|`|baed4cf76a5dd51fc260dc9c13897f69aa	hghjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjghghj|`|dd95f78dd0032074e795dc0dc4a7b04baa	Dude. . . .she may simply think you are only looking at her as a casualy acqaintance.  Since you haven't really  made a move at all she may be under that impression.  Many girls are still old fashioned in a sense in that they want to be persued.  Sure. . they may bang all the time but they still want to be persued.   You need to make an honest effort (if you want) and let her know how you feel and see where things go.   I'm sure she has plenty of men in her life that have or may be showing her more clearly what their intentions are.  If you've know this girl for that many years and nothing has come of it yet. . . she either is not interested or simply thinks you are not interested.   Let her know how you feel and just take a a chance and see what happens.  At worst she doesn't feel the same way and you will be no worse off than you are now.  Good luck!!
93557d7e72126f5b5caf9a17d4940a44aa	Ovviamente non stiamo parlando degli amici veri, quelli che anche se assenti li riteniamo presenti perch sono importanti per la nostra crescita morale. Un amico vero non  mai assente o presente,  un amico "" e basta! Noi non telefoniamo all'amico per sapere che fine ha fatto (avr avuto senz'altro cose importanti da fare), noi ci rallegriamo del suo nuovo rapporto (sicuramente il nostro amico non vedr l'ora di condividerne gli aspetti positivi o parlarci dei suoi problemi), noi non buttiamo soldi per i nostri amici (se del caso ci interessiamo di poterli aiutare). Se cos non fosse, che tristezza, abbiamo confuso dei conoscenti per amici........   In questo caso non sentirti coinvolto moralmente ma agisci di conseguenza, dando loro il giusto peso. Dal tono della tua domanda capisco che la tua sensibilit ti fa stare male, ma ricorda che ognuno di noi  unico e sicuramente essendo sempre te stesso, troverai i veri amici anche solo guardando meglio quanti ti sono vicini. Ciao e auguri|`|c12e2903577b3cad0d35875d25c3d663aa	Mi comporto di conseguenza, non li mando a quel paese ma sono meno disponibile rispetto agli altri.Mi faccio meno problemi per loro (di lasciarli da soli, di invitarli nei posti..etc).Gli voglio bene ma cerco di fargli capire che non servo a comodit!!!|`|bb677ff08f4d04906558949f480474deaa	Premesso che sono per la vendetta servita a sangue freddo io mi comporterei allo stesso modo...come ha bisogno di me, mi nego e poi per una questione di correttezza e giustizia le spiego perch l'ho fatto...purtoppo spesso queste persone non sono abbastanza intelligenti da capire il gesto, per mi sarei tolta lo sfizio....  tenetevi stretti gli amici veri.....sono rari!|`|e006a0139df38cf5b513ccfb7e316d05aa	Come con tutti gli altri amici: da Amico con la "A" maiuscola. Personalmente non mi faccio influenzare da come gli altri si comportano con me per decidere come comportarmi con loro. Mi comporto bene e basta.  Credo che la vita sia un dono arricchito della capacit di godere di ci che  bello.  Nella maggior parte dei casi non c' bisogno di far capire agli altri quanto sia rara e fragile la bellezza: quando la trova, risponde nella maniera giusta; e se mettiamo gli altri nella condizione di sentirsi "parte" di essa, allora cercher in ogni modo di accrescerla.  Quando che non mi ritrovo bene a frequentare qualcuno cerco semplicemente altre amicizie. Non allontano, non giudico e non parlo male di nessuno. al massimo, ove occorre, mi limito ad esporre i fatti.   Un vero amico non si riconosce da quante volte si fa vedere da te; pu essere molto impegnato e esserti comunque pi amico di quanto tu creda. Un altro pu esserti vicinissimo e pugnalarti alle spalle.  Un vero amico non giudica l'altro, semmai, se occorre, e se richiesto, gli d buoni consigli per migliorarsi.  E infine... se lui non si  fatto vedere da te... tu hai provato a farti vedere da lui?

AA10946225	She probably needs to get laid.|`|AA12393872	Sweety, there is actually two issues that need to be addressed here:  First of all your Mom has brought you up as a single parent all these years and that is very tough to do indeed. She has sacraficed a lot for you and I applaud her for that. Unfortunetly now what is happening is all the pent up feeling in her may be seeping out as resentment towards you now that you are in your upper teen years. One thing I had to learn as an adult is to realize that, to your parent(s), you are a reminder, not only of all the great things in life that they have done, but also some of the failures as well. It is a guess here that your Mom had you when she was about your age and you are reminding her of herself. This would explain her actions towards you that you have described as maybe it is hard for her to realize she cannot turn back the clock. Your mom has feelings of hurt and pain too.  Second issue is the issue of finding your Dad (I also read a question from before you asked). Once again, it is not the issue of why your Mom and Dad failed as a couple but the issue is for you to find out who your biological parent is. You may not like what you find and be disappointed so be prepared for that. One positive thing is that you will at least open the door to communication and fill an obvious gap in your personal needs. As you get older, knowing both parent's biological make-up will be beneficial as in what the family medical history is on both sides and what you maybe inheriting physically from them.   Last thought is one of caution and understanding. When I was eighteen my head was as hard as cement. I made a lot of mistakes and did not want to listen to good advice. Please do yourself a big favor, "Think Before You Act" . This is an old saying that has worked for so many years now. Talk things out with your Mom and search for your Dad, you do not have to tell your Mom that you are searching since it only upsets her. Ask her about what I wrote here and if she does not want to listen, then maybe a new place to live might be the best option for the both of you. I only hope that if you do decide to move, where ever you move will be a stable environment.|`|6fe070b9f470d901c00fa7e2f19239b3aa	I wouldn't be suprised if your mothers terrible behavior is why your fathers not in the picture.     You can't do much about her, she is her own person who sounds like she's gonna do what ever she wants regardless of what anyone says, and even if she's wrong, she'll believe she's right anyway and make matters worse.    Try not to let her bother you too much, enjoy the comfort of your friends, and work your way into a situation where you have a good job and move out. If your mother really cares, she'll reach out to you.    You could try talking to her, but it may or may not work depending on how dense she is.|`|5ee9152f02a24fc2f8462f47c2a54d97aa	If you are not sure what you are doing, don't do it! Being at home at 18 is not such a terrible thing. You can use the time you are in home to find a converging spot with your mom.  I propose this from this day to new year  try to find 10 things you like about your mom. Find for a good occasion to tell her how  you feel about all those thing you said in your question (I mean about no hugs, or kisses, or nice words.) Maybe she refuse to hear you at first, but I'm sure she will understand you. Don't act impulsive take your time and wait. You can talk to God anytime you feel desperate. I will do it  too.

Might be a good idea if you moved out of the house. You don't say weather you have any other family other than Mum. Maybe a grandma or aunt would be willing to help out.

f793bb49042ed653b8c9499244b5caccaa	How can he call you first if he doesn't have your number?  You have to be the one to call him.  The age is really not very different.  When he said he had his own place was it part of the converstion or was he trying to get you to go to his place (big difference!).  If you are not sure, call him, stay in public places for a while, keep it casual.  Or what you could do is call him to thank him again for helping you.  Then he has the chance to get your number or ask you to hang out.|`|AA12083470	If he doesn't have your number, how is he going to call you first?  Call him.

It could be bad or good.  The fact that you have been with him since 3/21 is a good thing.  Try emailing him and asking him how he feels.  I know for me it is alot easier to express myself through writing/email.  Good luck!

Ci sono anche altri rischi di morte derivanti dall'assunzione di alcol, come gli incidenti alcol-correlati (sul lavoro, stradali, ecc.) o il suicidio, anche fra i giovani alcoldipendenti.  La dipendenza da alcol  pi dura da spezzare e molto pi dannosa di molte altre sostanze che provocano dipendenza. I sintomi fisici durante l'astinenza da alcol sembrano essere uguali a quelli sperimentati nella fase di astinenza dall'eroina.  Hai ancora voglia di bere e di ubriacarti ? Spero di no ?

Aversion therapy. If you see cleavage, you shock yourself or pinch yourself. Substitution. Whenever you think of cleavage, you picture broccoli. Whenever you see cleavage, you picture broccoli or something that you hate. The final is to burn yourself out on cleavage. Look at loads of magazines. It'll take many hours of non stop looking but at some point you'll grow tired of cleavage. Good luck. It's pretty natural so I wouldn't really worry about it.|`|3098f6f048266a18901453bb2505482eaa	it seems harmless to me. i have a huge chest and i think its OK for guys to like cleavage. but if your looking for a way to stop your obsession then I'd say to avoid women for a while. no magazines or web sites. just avoid them for about a month or two and see how it goes. if that dosent help then good luck to ya.
b933109d88eb132210b29523022b89dcaa	Yes, I believe you can.     You have been together this long and you still get to meet every 2 or 3 weeks. It will actually spice things up to have that seperation.     Two of my good friends have done much worse:    They had only been together for about 4 -5 months, they suddenly had to live on opposite sides of the globe for an entire year without seeing each other. You know what happened?    One of them eventually moved to the other one's country and they got married. After a whole year of seperation they just kept it going over the phone.     True and strong love knows no boundaries. You have a longer history with your man and you will still frequently meet. You are fortunate. I see no problems with your situation.     Best of luck to the both of you.     Love is the most beautiful thing in this world.

d11beb9dbe4d078345e0f4632d56c6d9aa	Special Time is a time for one parent to spend with one child doing something the child and parent enjoys doing together.  To begin Special Time, set a regular time or times each day to do something with your child.  Special Time gives each child the normal attention he/she wants.  Scheduling and keeping Special Time as regular routine decreases the child's constant demands for attention and helps parents to turn requests for attention at other times of the day into Special Activities.  Regular routine activities become part of Special Time.  How often and how long Special Time will be determined by the age and attention span of the child and family time available.  Special Time does not mean Family Time.

But I know women that are with men that are "well to do off" complain because their husbands are constantly working and don't pay them any attention, and a woman needs attention. But with a guy that's like a thug or doesn't have that much going on yet or at all, they ususally will pay more attention to the woman because 1. they ain't that successful in their ventures or 2. they are lookin for a free ride and know how to get it.

You need to probably talk to someone professional. stay safe|`|568ecf294267efef82135bfaaaddd87eaa	you seem very upset. why all of a sudden life has to be stupid? let me tell you why you should still live. if you try something stupid like commit suicide then your leaving behind all the wounderful opportunities of becoming something no one can imagine. by doing this your making the most permanent descision in your life. once you make this mistake there is no turning back to learn from it. life is too short to be worrying about someone who hasnt treated you right or made you feel unhappy. things like that dont count in the end. your love towards people will bring them closer to you. walking around with your head down wishing the world was just one big hole is not the right attitude. you have many people out there fighting for you and making sure no other countries come and invade your personal privacy. you have parents who care about you. the friends who you thought were friends arent much to worry about right now. life is very fragile. if you take it from yourself you aint gettin it back. make yourself happy. put a smile on your face. email people that still care about you. go to a club or something and make yourself useful but dont make the biggest mistake ever. because the consequences are gonna be hard to bear if you do. and im not just talking about leaving behind people that really care about you.|`|AA12077161	Life is not stupid it is challenging every day. Overcoming the challenges is what makes life exciting, it's like being on a roller coaster ride day and night. Challenges prepares us for the next challenge and enables our mind to grow and mature. Friends are far and between and few are true friends. An acquaintance will come and go in this road of life. Your best friend will always be " YOU ".|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	Quit feeling sorry for yourself.  You think you're the only one in this world that has it tough.  Do you have a job??  Do you have food in your house??  Do you have a loving family??  Are you  healthy??  Do you have something to live for??  What are your passions in life??  Where do you want to travel??  Who's the hottest chick you know?? What's the greatest job you can think of??  When stop focusing on the negative things in your life and start to celebrate the great things in front of you, then your life will change.  Celebrate that you have some of the greatest gifts in the world and you're not using them everyday.  How about that you can see, you can  smell, you can touch, you can taste, you can think of a better place to be, you can love.  Use you natural god given talents and enhance them everyday and you can become an even more amazing creature than you already are......|`|ffe88f2196f12ed2eb79e9a703728ef2aa	There are Alot of reason to live!!  If nothing else why give those people that you thought were friends and your ex the satisfaction of bringing you down??  Theyre not worth it really are they?    You got your whole life ahead of you.  Honestly.  Look at all the good things you like about yourself and thats in your life!!  If theres somethings you dont like  then make some changes. Talk with someone you trust and do things that make you feel good about yourself.  Dont let those other people ruin your life they arent worth it. keep your head up, tomarrow is another day and the future can be what you make it. good luck.|`|c9b1d8bb1607e19460e52a960cdbba8aaa	Stop your freaking whining.

AA11809344	You should go to your friends party even if there is someone you hate there...avoid that person that you dislike and hang out with those you do...dont let people you dont like come between you and your friend..that other person is probably going to juss get on your nerves..well show them who the real best friend is..they go up to you juss tell them you dont want to be mean but your there because you are being a friend..well i hope you end up going for all you know you may have a good time...good luck|`|d9c822f9f72d1bf3b780908a5d109e35aa	Yeah I would but just try to stay away from the person you hate and enjoy the party as much as possible.

fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	Practice talking with female friends about anything and maintain eye contact there.

Good luck.|`|4176521a5111c9fde88742be787d45aeaa	When you can't look someone in the eyes it makes them feel like they are not close enough to you.

Start looking into her eyes.  Grow a little balls if you have to.  But it's all a choice.
fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	I wish I knew because I feel  girls do this as well. Maybe he though you were a close female friend and was treating you as one. He is tying to keep you as a friend and you may have misinterpreted his feelings towards you. I'm sorry that it hurts. I know it hurts from personal experience. But miscommunication occurs at times. I recently talked with the girl openly and honestly and found out that I'm considered a close friend and confidante. I'm her safety net if anything goes wrong. I hope the pain will go away soon. Take care don'tgow/theflow. I hope an even better guy winds up on your doorstop soon.

There are plenty of single people, it would be foolish to hurt your best friend over something that is probably only intriguing because you know it is wrong. Relationships are hard enough, you would have a major strike against you from the get go. Good friends are hard to come by, you have to be a good friend too.

7b273e08d6cea7299939e088b6501d0baa	What I know is they make their wedding dresses one size smaller. Example, if you are a size 4, you wouldn't fit in a size 4, you have to go a size bigger.  Or if you are a size 2, you have to wear a size 4.  When it comes to dimensions such as bust, waist, and hip, I don't think it's given even if you check their catalog.  I bought my wedding dress from there.    My suggestion, go back to David's Bridal and bring your own tape measure.  Check the circumference of the dress, like when checking the waist size, run your tape across the waist line to get the circumference and then multiply by 2, you get the dimension of the waist. Do the same thing with the bust and hips.  That would give you an idea.    Hope that helps.|`|3e48f429b671dcc535739160b469fac0aa	If you go back to David's they will have a sizing chart for you...every designer's chart is different though so it really depends on which dresses you tried on. The person you met with should have measured you and kept a record of those sizes...you could ask for that too...|`|c6fb2d5d793c9f83be349dbf6f07d1f5aa	I got my wedding dress at David's Bridal and it fit perfect and was *my size*. Everywhere else (ie, normal bridal salons) I tried on dresses, I had to go up at least two sizes to fit. I was not about to buy a giant dress to have it altered to fit me. The other dress I wanted was $1200 plus it would have been another $400 to alter. I don't think so. David's Bridal doesn't use that weird arcane *you're a size 6 but you'll be wearing a size 10 at your wedding* way of measuring. They are true to size.  I found David's Bridal a blessing. I walked in, told them what size I had been trying on...they laughed, said "try this". It fit perfectly, I loved it, and I look FANTASTIC in my wedding pictures.|`|AA10018638	First off, let me tell you..... I LOVE Davids Bridal. That's where I got my wedding dress from (im getting married in June)...and the consultants are sooo helpful there! If you were to take the measuring tape in there with you, im sure they would be able to find out what size you are/what you need. I do know, that their dresses do run a size smaller though.     Good Luck!

85a54ae23daab322fac63efe1bb8bff8aa	First off, you are not fat. Stop thinking like that. Second, they are teenage boys they haven't matured past 4th grade yet.You were right to have told your friend and no it is not  right that her boyfriend says those things to you,and his friends.You are a very pretty young lady and I am wondering if you have talked to your mom about what is going on. Trust me, she would want to know. My daughter is 13 and we can talk about everything. There is nothing she can't tell me that will make me love her any less. I want her to be able to come to me with all her problems, boys and all.I really want you to say something to your mom if you haven't because what those boys are doing now just might get out of hand someday, and she needs to know where it started , also try sitting somewhere else on the bus.If your friend doesn't start talking to you then you need to let her go, that is not a friend because she should tell her boyfriend to stop. I hope I have helped some and that it starts getting better for you.|`|AA10912959	Let's talk first about your friend, your friend is probably mad about something that her man said, and she is simply taking it out on you, Then it could have had something about you since it was her boyfriend that is asking you out in the first place.    Personally I don't think I have to look at your picture to tell that you have a low self esteem problem....You shouldn't feel bad about your size at all and if you are 123 pounds you are not fat...And who ever told you that lied to you... I weight 198 and I am 41 and I don't look like I am and I don't feel bad by the way I look not one bit and I don't let anyone else tell me other wise. I know that I look good and I can look at myself in the mirror and say so....Don't be listening to people tell you about how you look make it up to yourself how you look because if you do and have been waiting for someone to tell you that you look good then my girl you will be waiting a long time.    Now for the boys, yes they are making fun because of one thing! and that is because they want to have sex with you and you are not biting to there questions, so they have no other thing better to do is to tease...Boys are inmature at times and sometimes you have to overlook what they do because they haven't grown up yet...My last thing I am going to say is that all this drama is exactually what it is drama, don't let yourself get beat up by all of this and continue being who you are and don't worry about your girlfriend what ever it is she will get over it in time when she sees that you are not bothered about it at all.|`|AA10375363	dont worry about ur weight and dont worry about them  but i wouldnt hang with them they sound weird|`|49ed2778d99bf00cce9349b4d378d306aa	First, you are NOT fat.  And second, they're just teasing you because they think you're hot.  That's how middle school boys are; they're awkward and they don't know how to act around girls they like.|`|AA10408335	don't think you are fat, but I do think you should find a new friend and  can you tell your parents about being  harassed by these boys, or perhaps the school or bus driver?|`|AA11552835	Listen.....your perfect just the way you are.....do not listen to anyone else.  Your beautiful, if you want salad, eat salad, if you want a burger eat one too.  Your a healthy beautiful girl, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Guys are messed up at that age, don't listen to them, they sound like playas|`|AA12072675	i looked at your pictures and you are NOT fat at all...why would you think you are? and if your friends boyfriend is bothering you then you should tell someone who can do something about it|`|8ec151060dbfb1965c1df2acc3b09d46aa	They are jerks and they don't deserve attention from you.|`|704581408989fd893e8f2530df5dcbcaaa	okay...first, no it's not okay for her boyfriend to do that, she needs to respect herself more than that, she deserves better, second yea, those guys are just being immature and jr. highish, cuz they like you...but they need to stop if you tell them to!! and lastly your not at all fat!! i saw your pics, and i just wanted to tell you, you look adorable in that dress :)|`|AA10053806	Well each girl has their own opinion but I personally think she shouldn't be alright with her bf asking you if you'd date him. that's odd. and also you should tell them not to say things like that I mean It's ok to say it but if they're always saying you have a nice body ect. they need to cut it out. We don't have short term memory loss and yea I think that they may just be making fun of you. Not saying your ugly of course your not but not everyone thinks the same. And your not fat, weighing that much at that height is perfectly fine. Now if you think you need to lose weight then yea I would have a salad a day and also try not eating alot after six at night because since it's night time your metabolism slows from not getting as much excercise so if you eat alot after that time, your more likely to gain weight. Also try eating more vegetables because your body uses alot of energy digesting and even more when they're vegetables so you might lose weight if you eat more of them. And of course excercise alot even if it's just playing outside because it speeds up your metabolism. I hope this helps
83cc1842767c7adbc4d3818e09eb9a5daa	good for you! its great that you want to be healthier|`|ba216034f3d3d8e76b8d090eea52c67aaa	you don't need no fat camp   healthy diet and regular exercise are the only way to lose weight  learn about healthy diet there are alot of ways to eat healthily and still eat good    no diet plans or pills just a big scam|`|acc06e32aa1b61885e803d0885de8de2aa	You're still very young and far from fat.

Talk to someone about this and tell them how you feel. Talk to a pe teacher or a nurse. they will tell you what a healthy weight for you is and how you can continue to stay healthy.   By the way I love your dress! And if those two guys by you in the black and white pic of you in your dress are your crushes they are just skinny and you have good taste in guys!|`|e2c5cc961d973ca4431f810ff9302066aa	What if your crushes like girls over they own weigth.|`|e8ce410d8319f0687b936695d5e44fd1aa	A lot of girls are never happy with there body shape.  Take it from me I was anorexic for a long time.  Now that I have grown up (and gained about 60 pounds) I realize that I look way better now.  Guys like a little meat on a girls bones they don't want to feel as if they will break you when they try and hug you.  You are not even close to being "FAT".  You are the perfect size.  If you really want to work on your body just do some Pilate's to tighten your muscles.  This will bring on the results you are looking for and in a healthy manner.
c4c3ea015ceda18a29560a1ed911868aaa	You need to stop fixating on this guy. I like someone, and i can't be with me, especially seeing as i rarely see em, and it means i just think about them, then like them more, and its a really bad cycle  STOP  the more you think baout him, the more you'll like him. If he thinks your a stalker, then hes not gonna go out with you! You need to take a chill pill, stop obsessing. It will scare him off. Be cool, act uninterested and as if it was jus rumours that escalated. He's more likely to like you that way.   He sounds like he is a concieted jerk, but i no how easy it is to fall for em. And if he IS a jerk, the fact he knows you arent running after him MITE annoy him, guys love it when they have admirers, so wen u disappear he could veyr well want you back  Your not a looser, your gorgeous, if he doesnt reckognise that then f*** him, its his loss. Don't let your self confidense take a dive like mine did when my guy didnt like me back. Be strong, life is full of hurdles the more you overcome the mroe grgs u are ;)|`|bd5e8aab4d15d5a6a76056d1fea81199aa	Well you are very attractive and any guy who can't see that is blind, I like you my space page alot|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	Oh Kate. How many times will you post your myspace photo and beg to be told you're cute? Don't you value yourself at all? You've posted that link so many times, with the same drama.|`|90adc70d307e2ea672c98adbedad7186aa	Damn, ur very beautiful|`|a172da0596293c3f2686a5c8fed7fef6aa	Give up on him. It is a lost cause. Just be yourself, and you will find someone who is compatible with you. You are an attractive young girl, you just need to realize that. There is no reason anyone would not want to date you other than your lack of confidence in yourself. Take some time and really get to know yourself. Learn to accept yourself as you are, and other will notice you also.|`|5a294d51857abc2efb87c195045107c4aa	You definitely don't look like a loser. By the way you have a beautiful eye colour, just amazing.   The no self-confidence thing can be cured by just not caring about what the guy thinks, he's obviously a real jerk and he doesn't deserve you. People also just get attracted to certain people. You'll find someone who is right for you and likes you for who you are and what you look like.   You don't seem like a stalker and you wouldn't count as one anyway, just forget about the guy, he'd like to get a bad reaction from you so just forget about him. He's probably some wanna-be "cool guy" who spends his days thinking about himself.|`|156727ffaa0cc54aba6a2edbeef16c28aa	Tell him you are not a stalker but you just like him and your friends took it out of hand. That you never meant for this to happen but you promise that it will not happen again.
0586201f2055b9772fb87891ea6f4f85aa	Well, for one I think you are cute :)  And there is no need to not belive to your friend. He could flirt with you and from your picture I see he has all right to do ;P  I think he will like you personally.  You don't need to ask him out straight away. Get to know him, start talk to him more often. Start from just saying hi and then after a couple of weeks doing that you will have enough belif in yourself to talk to him or just say couple of sentences. Aftyer that just start flirt with him, give him different signs of attention and hints that you like him.  If you are at school together you can ask him what subjects he is taking, what are his hobbies etc. and go from there. Like if he likes football you could ask him what team he likes, best player etc. etc.   If he likes movies ask him how often go to the cinema and what last film he watched. When you get to know him better you will not have a problem in finding what to talk about.  As I said start saying hi to him at first and then you will get your confidence over time talk to him properly. Don't be afraid of him, he probably as nervous as you are if he likes you.    Hope that helps a little bit, Wolfy.   P.S. Just be yourself but be careful if it will happen at school you could dislike going to school if the relationship will not work out.|`|430c416d99e85d4052a9423e2dbcbaf1aa	Yes, you're going insane.

If you just assume and only listen to the rumours you hear about him then you'll never know true or a lie and in the end you'll lose out.  Who know this guy probably does have girl but she could be living overseas.     Key is don't let him play you, it'd mess you up and its not very nice.

Maybe just ask him to do something casual like go out for a drink.    Or you could just say to him, look I really like you and I get the impression that my feelings are reciprocated. Then ask if he is attached and if he isn't, ask him out.

Tu misma has dicho que el NO confia en ti, y cuando la confianza se ha perdido, no hay relacion que sobreviva. Te aconsejo que llores lo que tengas que llorar, sufras lo que tengas que sufrir, que te acostumbres a su ausencia en tu vida sentimental, te va a doler y te va a costar, no digo que no. Pero no hay mal que dure 100 a?os, y veras como habras crecido y como te sentiras despues de que esto pase. Ten fe, por algo suceden las cosas, y si sucedio es porque algo mejor te espera.

Some guys can become addicted to pornagraphy and shut out physical contact with their partner. Do not let your self image become damaged by his behavior. I believe pornagraphy is not "evil" if partners use it to stimulate a relationship in a healthy manner-however, I am considering ending a long relationship over my partner's obsession with porn.

And no, she was not a little girl, she was 22 and in college, but for me, she was so HOT!     Cup C is my limit, but I dont like any bigger.  I hate stretch marks on boobs.

b2be7de6ea7ef5a51b5b236d795bc814aa	You're trying way too hard, women hate that. Give her some  room and space and see if she misses you and has any real interest in you.    She'll bail out and dump you if you keep pestering her and smothering her.    My advice is too dump her and move on. This works for 3 big reasons.    1) She'll want you back and try to get back together if the shock of the breakup makes her realize she's taking you for granted.    2) Otherwise, your free of her and you can move on to find someone who's really into you and likes you for who you are.    3) If you break up first, you're empowered and able to move on, if you keep your current pattern of behavior up, she'll dump you and you'll keep following her around, calling her, stalking her, spying on her and get even more obsessed with trying to control something you can't have.|`|AA11280073	She's just not that into you.

See dear girl with good look  always have more choice so may be this is one possibility that she is waiting for some one or not interested in getting tied with one guy and want freedom.   DO not wait or watch.. this is time to fight for your love....    Why not u are going by back door. See just tell  her like this ..Suppose her name is pinky and nisha is one image character    Pinky you are right , we are good friends today I feel that the relation we have that is friendship not a love. I am sure the love will be totally different which I felt today. You know I meet with Nisha , Ohh my god I think you know my heart started running from today only, I am sure now I am in love. Pinky tell me how to propose nisha ?    Thats it And see she will start thinking about nisha I am sure she will feel that she is losing you and will be curious to know about your image girl NISHA, take benefit of her feelings of insecurity  and day by day go close to her. One day act as you the very happy and tell her you are going for a dinner with NIsha Start singing and take pinky in your hand ..tell her you will take nisha in your hand like this and you will kiss her like this and give a small kiss on pinkys cheek. Thats it.. Now  do not contact pinky till she call you. When she is calling act as you re heart broken and crying. Tell to pinky that nisha is good but not as you want you are looking for some thing which you hold..go more and more close to pinky and with crying and sad face say her I wish nisha will become like you and ask her cant we be lover pinky  ?    Thats it .. man sure she will tell  Yes yes and only Yes      It will take only 7 days but I am sure you will get PINKY.|`|2d0d1917f13f3ff84da3ebd775be12b5aa	Boss this type of girl is very difficult, she wants her own demand that how many boys say that i like you, i luv you bla bala bala.

4b15163983dc650bfabe69fa6744bc4eaa	That all depends on how things are going now. If you two have spent a lot of time together in each other's personal spaces (i.e. bed, bathroom, kitchen...) then it won't be much of a problem. And if either of you have had roommates before it might be easier. BUT, my boyfriend and I moved in with each other a few months ago and we did learn a lot more about each other. You also have to be careful not to just get into the trap of going about your daily lives and only seeing each other briefly at night before bed. You have to make sure you have quality time. Quantity comes easy when you live together, but it doesn't keep a relationship together.   Also, you might want to think about marriage and whether or not that is in the future. If it's not, think about how much you want to devote to the person if it won't amount to a future together.|`|AA11268129	Yes things will change you have to compromise and do your share of cleaning around the place, but its will test your relationship at the most, Be prepared and don't expect anything out of this.

You can't just leave and go home like you used to.|`|2fa2e224702ecf3c775b23d335665f3faa	Of course things will change.  Some changes will be good and some will be bad.  It is never easy to live with someone else.  You will have to learn to compromise and make decisions that are in the best interest of your household...which may not always be the decision you want to make.  Hang in there, but if you are having serious doubts, delay it.  There is no shame in taking your time and being sure that it's right for you.  Better to find out before you wind up in debt.|`|00ba354106f7e4ec5aec7e5e1f8bd15caa	change the things you can accept the things you cant!!!!    at this point in the relationship you can still change things but after she moves in all bets are off... slowly but for sure things will change and not for the better.... sound negative doesnt it but thats the truth and going by the other answers to this question id say im not far of the mark...... good luck buddy i'd be interested to hear your final decision|`|a3b366b96d1758cf46dc94ba1c834a0caa	YES!

It is a committment to the day to day activities of living....shared.      You are about to embark to the place where most men fail and never even know what they did wrong.This woman is not your mother.  It is not her obligation or her responsibility to feed, launder, housekeep or transport you.  She will enjoy doing these things for you.  You will go watch TV.  And she will think that is so great.  And then she will get tired, and then she will resent you.  .....(This is when most guys get real confused.).....    Treat your lady with respect.  Give her someone she can trust.  Not just in the relationship, but every day.  Do the things that have to be done (with or without her).  Vacuum.  Do the dishes.  Throw in a load of towels.  Cook a couple times a week.  You walk on the floor, eat, shower......this is the work part of life.  If you can avoid exhausting your lady love then thats when you get to keep the extended date.|`|d2f3eb61912ab6139000aa7c223bf137aa	first thing that will change will be the sex.  for the first week or two it will be as normal then the transition begins.  she will tell u that she wants this relationship to be based on love not sex, then little by little over the course of 6 months u will be lucky to get a hand job.  then anything u want in the house is out, like ur fav chair etc....then its how u dress, then its your hair, you get the picture DONT DO IT STAY SINGLE|`|e0a2de3607bbfcbf876a348fbfdf21f7aa	Dude. It's about to change big time. I wouldn't go into things giving her all of your space if that is not what you are comfortable with. I would say communication is key. But it depends on how your relationship is. I never date women who act needy and want to be taken care of. So if we lived together it'd be about both of us creating a new space and not about me moving into her space. This is both of your lives, not her life with you along for the ride.

d22c4a37634fdcfc89fc8c5eaff4468faa	I enjoy a conversation abut her and her life and her veiws.This allows you to understand her betetr and learn more about her and her past.Also gives you some input on how she will handle some issues and she wil lalso expose some feeling on issues so you can better understand her and her reactions to you.    And yes Ladies , I do share those same topics with her if we are communicated on that level.After all its a two way street.|`|e8dcbbdb9f4c6267514dc562bf234213aa	when we are talk about life and our dreams|`|58d0fd7b6cf209d4a2a384672e8ca951aa	Sense of humour and a pleasing smile.|`|dd3a40d92f686725b4d4ca1430b72aa3aa	Dude if your tryin to impress your girl be yourself and no one else girls hate that ****, your sweet to them one min then your true mean *** colors show the next lol but seriously try being yourself and you will be fine !! promise|`|c70e91d3a09080710a5d700136d94f84aa	Everything except shopping, makeup and the hottest guy in town!|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	If I knew, I'd be talking to a great woman, instead of chatting here!    Seriously, there's something magical about just "hitting it off" with a woman.  Does the interest in conversation flow from the attraction, or vice versa?  I don't know.  Making a connection is the best, though.  I've had better times with "plain Janes" who were interesting than with "fashion plates" who were unintelligent or unkind.    You just have to find the person who is genuinely interested in the same things you are, or who has a similar background so that you feel more comfortable with each other.  It's hard to find it, but it's worth it when you do.  Good luck.|`|AA12105049	i like her to tell me how much $ she has what she's going to buy me and the ways she's going to let me violate her|`|b82b3ae05e320f75be4c2fc320c67e8baa	chemistry  depends the situation and lady

You might try introducing yourself first  even if you 'casually' know him. Men are almost invariably flattered to be asked out, so worst case scenario can't be too bad. Good luck!

It's a part of life. It's either going to be yes or no. So, just ask the person out. He'll either say yes or no.    Here, you can say "I'm going to so and so on what ever the day is.

Make sure that you let him know how much you love him- this is your last chance to do so.  Help him to assume any responsibilities he has accepted after he is gone, such as your mom or siblings.  Make photos.  Make voice recordings.  Learn and record/write all and any family history that he can share and remember.      He is probably already proud of you, but do the right things now either way.|`|9332051206eab5fd5c156d670de5c839aa	How can anyone know that?

A person your age doesn't need to be worrying about all that nonsense - ye Gods, what is this world coming too!  YIKES!    Seriously, no one needs stitches to stay virgin tight -- this is just rubbish.  Don't take any advice from this friend/cousin -- at least not in the love department.

The goal is to reduce incontinence - wetting themselves.     I'm sure exercising that muscle can only be fine for you, better prepare you for pregnancy.  The focus on staying 'virgin tight' is so pathetic and sad, I despair for the girls of today.  Please don't be influenced by such talk.  I'd say it would be far more instructive for your cousin to talk to you about how to be assertive in a relationship and get your sexual needs met or how to please a man with techniques or what have you (for when you are married or at least with someone whom you would immediatley marry should pregnancy happen.) She is talking to you about teaching women and the natural progression of their bodies to hate and reject themselves.  You cannot begin to imagine the changes that happen to a man's sexuality as he ages, either.  If he's so immature he wants to pretend he's having sex with virgins and not with a wife whose grown through life wtih him, then you don't want him.

Stimulating a man usually results in precum on the tip of his penis.

a6671dfe72f1edea1edc702b559f4d29aa	At the very least, it sounds like it's not the right time for this relationship to blossom, and it may never. I find it a little odd that he couldn't at least return your phone calls. Any he claims to be shy so you need to call him? People, especially adults, don't usually make a habit of going around verbally telling people that they feel they are shy! Hmmm....shy enough to prevent him from calling you but not shy enough to prevent him from telling you of such an emotional inadequacy?? Odd really. Eventually he calls you so why can't he call you in the first place? It really just doesn't make sense. Consistently breaking plans? Hmmm...red flag!! Well, he gets an A+ on the apologizing thing (although it doesn't mean anything when it happens all the time) and maybe he truly is sorry for breaking the plans. I mean, you could just flat out ask him why he can't call you, doesn't return your phone calls, breaks plans, etc. but regardless of how he truly feels about you and regardless of whether or not his odd behaviour is somehow validated, this is certainly a very one-sided relationship at this point and not a good way to start. I wouldn't waste any time chasing him. I wouldn't necessarily write him off completely. Maybe he's just not at a good place in his life right now and unable to have a succesful relationship with anyone.Hmmm, or maybe he's not over his ex?? (just a thought). Anyway, certainly don't let him entertain the idea that you are there for him whenever he chooses to acknowledge you. Don't put your life on hold for this guy. Maybe if he sees you moving on, he may wise up. If not, so be it. Who wants a relationship like there was, if there was one? Especially in the beginning when it's supposed to be the best! Life's too short. Find someone who will be as anxious and excited to talk to and see you as you are them. Good Luck.|`|AA11398577	That is what all the girls in his life are saying!!!    Sounds like he is playing you!|`|515c6e245859ce6d7c6a52565aa72a32aa	maybe distance yourself and see if he'll run after you. If he does run after you then that's the time you decide.|`|28b0483c80e979a7627570f637b992c9aa	Run from this guy like the wind. People who are consistently flaky are trouble, especially when it comes to relationships. You cannot build a strong relationship with someone who is going to let you down in this way. If he truly cared about you, he would stop and think how not returning your calls would affect you, obviously he isn't doing this and it is affecting you. Speaking from experience, you don't want to be involved with a person like this. Find someone who can't wait to retunr your phone call, someone who is excited about hearing your voice. Not someone who is playing games with your emotions. Good Luck.

Mais, avant tout n'oublions pas qu'il s'agit d'un pilier de l'Islam et qu'il vaut tout autant que la prire ou la Chahada. Le june est avant tout un acte d'adoration de Notre Seigneur.

c63384fe368fec4a1250387f5694cc0baa	Relationships all go this way through time.  The more you pressure your wife for sex the less likely you are to get it.    Maybe you could treat your wife to a romantic weekend to put the intimacy back into your marriage, maybe she is the one who is feeling unattractive after having kids.    Take 1 night a week to spend some quality time together, don't expect wild sex straight away but pampering her every once and a while should help the situation. (make sure you tell her though that she isn't under any pressure to have sex right away, us women can read between the lines :) ), give her a back massage, cook her dinner, give her a nice glass of wine and sit down in front of a good movie.    She just be exhausted and not feeling very attractive after a day of working, cleaning the house and looking after the kids...give her time, it's not all about you :)|`|834b7af96c67200da6ff563a747887cfaa	Is this my husband??  Just kidding.  I myself feel unattractive, and that makes me want to have sex less.  Before marriage we were crazy, now, not so much.  What could he do to make me want to have more sex?   I believe a lot of the thrill comes from anticipation.  Planning and looking forward to special time.  And then the occasional spontaneous tryst as well.  Only approach her when she is cleaned up, not after mopping floors, a woman needs to feel desirable as well.  If you make her feel desirable, she will reciprocate.  My husband almost never married me for fear of this, and unfortch it has come to pass.  Good luck.    PS-my simple words of advice-make her feel desirable.  Have the occasional hot and heavy make out with no sex.|`|8a49fc655789176306e864ddb91a4fbeaa	Feeling your pain.  I too thought that I may have been the unattractive one, so I did something about it.  I lost 35 pounds down to 175 6 foot tall.  Got a different haircut and went to contacts that are a slight shade of blue.  Started to pick up around the house and stayed more focused on little things that needed details.  Have rearranged the basement and garage and have tried so hard to be EVERYTHING! Still the sex drive for her is NOT there.  I was so hoping.   Try doing what I did, if it does not work for you with the less weight and better health you will outlive her and be able to find someone who cares.|`|96e05001c2508a1b088abc66046f05bcaa	why wont u talk to her how u feel?|`|6c0f7e6446fe6aed17c2e306055d0188aa	Quit your bitching and tell your woman that you are taking what is yours.

Then through several questions here I found that I needed to improve my approach. I had to realize that she isn't just going to do it because I want to. So I started emailing her some relationship building emails everyday. Some had questions directly addressing my concerns and it opened up a channel for her concerns. I try very hard to make her feel loved, not that I didn't love her she just needed to feel it. Evaluate things you can improve on during the day like helping her out with dishes and such. Also try to rekindle the flame. It worked for me it can work for you.|`|a30c245733ce2cb1ea28d57e6f1bcb7eaa	Its pretty much a fact that the initial lust wears out, than a different kind of love forms, a stronger bond that gets better and better.  However the sexual lust usually fizzles out.  Words of advice: go out for an exciting night dancing and drinking.  Get her horny the whole night, build it up.  Then **** the shitt out of her.  Eat her pusssy real good, make sure she enjoys the hell out of it.     Then act lie nothing happened the next day and just be real relaxed with her.  Don't beg for sex nothing.  Then repeat about a week later.  Make sure you please her though.  Eating coochie correctly is usually a sure fire way.    If not, **** that bitchh, go out and get a prostitute on a weekly basis.|`|d09432d5f16b0b606f445596be973266aa	They do it all the time brother! I was married for 13 years and her sex drive took a huge dive after we had kids. We are divorced now and I have a sexy 22 year old girl that lives in my house. I get sex on a daily basis, usually initiated by her, and I have never been more sexually satisfied!     Start sending her sexy text messages and teasing her with emails and flirts for like a week, walk by her and fondle her ***, caress her breasts lightly (never imply that you want sex) keep this up and she will melt in your hands (unless she is just too far gone). Help her out around the house, even if you are tired. you have to sneak up on her, give it a week. Then when she gives you the signal, lay her on the bed and make her *** by eating her. Keep this up and you will get the poon when you want it. You have to make her feel sexy, not just like a piece of meat, use your skills man!|`|AA12322094	try to turn her on in someway like nuzzling her neck or making her a very fancy dinner.

fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	Have you ever asked him why he hates your boyfriend? Maybe you are his only daughter/ youngest and he feels really protective. Being raped before could be the reason as he doesn't want you to suffer through that again. He maybe afraid he will lost you. My first recommendation would be to talk to your dad about why he doesn't like this boyfriend. Maybe afterwards you can introduce the two of them. Take them to a baseball game or basically see if they have a common interest. It seems like you are real set to keep going with this boyfriend. Your dad may have to face the facts and to ease the transition, your boyfriend and dad my need to have a man to man talk. This way your dad can feel that he's protecting his daughter by laying down the law. Good luck. Hope things work out for the best.|`|5c31a9eaee79f9eddf681269990ceb41aa	Your 15, deal with it! YES your Dad has every right to be worried!|`|c0613c67338f47cce651e9a8cdb06e10aa	Sounds like your dad loves you and just wants to protect you. Tell him that you understand and you love him too, but this treatment is only pushing you away from him. I had this to happen to me when I was a teen too (with my Mother). Have a real heart to heart talk with him and try to come to a compromise that will make you both happy. Try to make him see your point of view and don't forget to listen to his. Do this calmly and with respect and hopefully he will do the same. Dad's do know a lot more than kids give them credit for, so don't discount everything he says. He really only wants what's best for you. He probably just doesn't know any other way to show it!!!    Hope things work out for you!

It turns out I should have listened to them, because I ended up getting hurt.     It may seem like your parents are just trying to rain on your parade, but they most likely do have your best interests at heart. Ultimately, this is something most of us have to learn for ourselves - the hard way.     I don't know the whole situation, but I suggest that before you just dismiss their disapproval, think about whether you're just not listening because it's not something you want to hear.|`|4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	Yes.|`|AA11588361	has happened many times. tough decision.|`|686474545d8ad5c6dd29b05f756a831daa	nop|`|AA11267495	quick note: your parents never really approve of anyone you date....just thought i'd share that with you.....now make your decision...|`|110335e62d7b666334676a82cb34f324aa	If you reall love him... and if you think it is worth it for fight for him... then be with him...

All you ever need is love,  communication and understanding. That's what I figured out so  far. If you are down, you need to get up and start doing something with  your life.

In fact, the opposite is true. Try considering that they have been there..done that - they know exactly what they are talking about.   I myself dated a couple of different people I knew they wouldn't have agreed with, then I married one lol. As much as I do love my husband, I understand now a lot of what my mother was always trying to tell me, and while I will make the best of it and continue to make every effort, I realize it might have been a tad easier on me if I had really taken what she told me to heart and followed it. She didn't want me to have to experience the difficulties that she did. But I did what I thought was right - because I thought I knew better.   It just doesn't work that way. I do think some beliefs might be a little extreme - that of course is religion specific. But there are certain facts that older people come to realize, and it is part of their job to teach this to their children - no matter how old they get.   So, while you may not precisely follow what your parents are telling you, keep an open mind and tread carefully when they are putting up warning signs.   Someone else might be seeing something that you aren't. Love really is blind - and it can blind you to something that is going to come back and bite you in the butt later.   If its only their religous beliefs, then you need to simply sit down with them and explain to them that you just don't believe the same way that they do. You only insult them however by saying they are ignorant in what they believe.   Insulting your parents is never a good idea lol. So if you want to keep the relationship with your parents, then talk to them about the decision you have made. They may not approve, but they don't want to loose contact with their child either.   There is a difference between acceptance, and understanding. Like my mother always told me, (no..not a box of chocolates)...'I don't agree with what you are doing, but it is your choice and I have to let you make your own decisions'.   Its more a matter of respect. Don't expect other people to just sit back and accept what you are doing, they certainly don't have to. But fighting everyone certainly won't win you any fights.   Good luck.|`|AA10827040	I found out the hard way that sometimes parents know best. And I am 30 years old and wish now I had listened to them. At least think about what they are telling you

Good for the goose good for the gander.|`|853cb69ccc10ded39020f6e41e8e6597aa	yes. tell ur feelings to her|`|AA10793321	I would see how long it usually takes her to get her orgsasm then cut it off by ten minutes or so. :d|`|AA11745675	So sounds like when you say she's getting carried away she really is so much so that when your finnished with that and decide to make love to her she's already almost about done and can only take you for 5 mins. when your just getting warmed up.    How about not going so long on the vibrater so she still has something left to go longer with you the other way. Sounds like she's getting most of her fill from the vibrator and by the time your cooking she's about done.    So dont' take the vibrater away just judge where she is at that time and make your move away from the vibrator you may have to gage it a few times till you know when she's had enough and then you can begin doing your thing. start tappering it down a few mins. and so forth till you get it right. so then she has enough gun ho left in her for your time with her..    You said is it worth saying something to her. I wouldn't at first try this way above without her knowing. You just do it calmly like its no big deal and see how that goes. If she doesn't take the bite then you will have to talk to her about it.|`|c4724456cd15eb2a1e069f4d014b864daa	have ya told her?????? may just be miscomunication

5dbabcb3ec8c9bca91bd1c90f2019a21aa	love is when you think about dream about and so on i hope this help.    Love is a feeling you feel when you feel youre feeling a feeling you never felt before.     Sounds profound, doesnt it?     I quoted it for years until I thought about the first time I received an electric shock. That was a feeling Id never felt before, but Ill guarantee you it wasnt love!     The problem with the word love is that we use it to apply to so many emotions or situations that we sometimes dont know what it means. So what is it? What is this thing called love?     Dr. Robert Sternberg at Yale University probably defines it best. He says that love consists of three components: 1) decision/commitment; 2) intimacy; and 3) passion. When all three strongly exist in our feelings for another person, he says that we feel consummate love for that person. What do these components mean?     Decision/Commitment has both a short-term and long-term dimension. The short-term dimension occurs when we consciously decide that we love someone. The long-term dimension occurs when we commit to maintain that love. Interestingly, some evolve into commitment without ever consciously deciding to do so.     Intimacy means closeness, connectedness, warmth, and bondedness. It has to do with understanding each other, accepting each other, and having open and intimate communication with each other.     Passion is physical attraction, sexual desire, and other strong emotional attraction to another person.|`|AA10637756	wen ur in love it means that u cant get that person outta ur mind and keep thinking about the person........like u want to hug and kiss the person and be everywhere with the peron all the time and never want to let them outta ur sight.|`|e63e3090f743046942d93540f99a116caa	Mmmm...if u r in love...u could easily discover that...THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TIME OF A MAN LIFE IS WHEN HE'S IN LOVE....IT'S MORE THAN A GREAT FEELING...

AA10456432	Sounds like you are both a little jealous of each other. Just love her for who she is and tell her your feelings in a nice, quiet way. Do not get upset if she criticizes you back. If she does get offended apologize and tell her you love her and did not want to hurt her. Tell her she is your best friend and you feel like you can tell her anything...

She probably doesn't even realize that it's making you feel like crap. If she has no job and all she does is live for her kids... what else would she talk about?? Anyway, in the end who's approval are you looking for? Do your kids love you? Do they think you are a great mom? Cuz that's what counts. If you love your sister and you're her best friend, all you can really do is be proud of her and her accomplishments. Of course you'll get annoyed with her... you don't think she's ever annoyed with you? That's what family is about.|`|AA11484381	I think you should think about your own attitude as well as hers. Is she really nasty or are you just jealous that she seems to have things a bit better than you? Of course she does whatever she can for her kids, just as you do. Are you saying that if you had the means you wouldnt treat your kids like superstars? Of course not. You shouldnt badmouth your sister for volunteering or for giving her kids the best she has. Talk to her, tell her how you feel, but dont blame her. You said it yourself, she's your friend as well as your sister, perhaps she doesnt realise you feel this way. If she has all these resources and spare time maybe she can help you give your kids a better life. You cant hold her responsible for 'thinking and acting like she's better than you'...you dont read her thoughts, you cant know her motivation. Be a sister to her and let her be one to you.

What you see in a particular person will be seen by someone else differently.  It's just that the things that he or she are looking for the other person has at that particular time. It may be material, sex, whatever  The things that you see in that person my not have even occured to the other party.  I think that every relationship offers different things and love comes in different degrees.  Don't beat yourself up about it.

8255179bf9630191a4532f97cdacdefcaa	Hi,    No disrespect intended but johnny can be applied towards any gender.  Orgasms (climax) are more visible in men.  Ejaculations determine the fulness of your enjoyment  A woman's is a lot more complex.  I have asked women this question before?  Can you describe your orgasm to me?  The answers that I received were quite humourous.  I got responses such as when I get really wet, etc.  When a woman has an orgasm she knows it.  It is like a series of uncontrolable muscle contractions.  Like feeling a fire works explosion (smile).  The wetness is just the body's way of preparing you for intercourse.  It is amazing to me how many people have sex and kids and have never experienced an orgasm.  How did you feel when you climaxed, that's what it is all about feelings.|`|AA11820856	It could be sexually satisfying unless the flood gates are open and I need to be dressed in plastic just to sustain|`|AA12201841	no sick|`|04bf686e0b0decd967b3c09547705429aa	WOW THAT DEPENDS ON HOW WEIRD THE PARTNER IS BUT I THINK ITS GROSS|`|4720ea1d9c7d374cfbed96673e14ac69aa	yes, unless its like a gallon.|`|ceb2320ab2bb1fb80db6e07896137608aa	if you are a female i think it is the sexiest thing ever i would love a girl like that.

AA12084859	In my opinion if you really like him then together you two can work through it. Yes he is embarassed that his ex went crazy with you there but look at the positive side of things. At least you were able to see that he is not the type of man to raise his hand to a woman even if she is going nuts. So if you are still attracted to this man then keep your plans in tact.|`|e74c21792cd3183246018ac0e1553d2daa	First of all if you found someone on a dating site, then congrats to you , I've been trying to do that myself but it just hasn't panned out yet.  But on the other things you wrote, I really don't think its the end, I think he was just humiliated and doesn't know how to face you yet about it....give it some time and I'll bet he gets back in touch with you.  Good Luck    ----Duane|`|499245013a49060e34c40bba148c03e8aa	I sincerely doubt it's over.Being embarassed,he may wait a little bit longer to call back,but as long as you assured him that,that situation didn't detour you,he should call and thing's should be fine.FRom the sounds of it he really likes you and that shouldn't push him away.Stay positive about it and he'll be fine.|`|AA12194882	ok how old are you?

37503ce5df97ef4d85381d27c702c654aa	Definitely talk to your brother about it. If he wants to break up with her then he should just get it over with. There is no reason you and her can't remain friends when he does.|`|52c6efd2a28acae483cd9a08949f7789aa	stay out of it|`|e9635543a2e53e29b09b1b690b2096b2aa	Stay out of it.

He just needs to grow up.|`|9181b26f76f473ef3f2e9dfd2542d30aaa	she has the right to know, but you should talk to your brother first, but you should tell her, let her be the on to leave him, make him miss what he had type thing!|`|b0bf561a07abe3b5d4eb778a2270bfbbaa	Stay out but make sure he knows how you feel.

They broke up and I kept my friend this time. Good luck hun.
AA12107607	I think its obvious that you just tell him how you feel and ask him how he feels. On the other hand, what kind of life would this be if we didn't have a few little games of romance? How about if you nuture the relationship a little at a time? All you have to do is be open to his advances. Make him comfortable. Smile, flirt, invite him to do things with you that you both enjoy with or without other friends. But don't expect him to respond the way you want him to. He may not be into you. He may have someone else in mind. Don't let it get you down if it doesn't happen too fast. If this guy wasn't meant to be.. don't worry.... there's a few million more where he came from. But if it goes somewhere, enjoy the ride.|`|932d5a6f59d070d52d0a61af3c7466afaa	I think girls are silly.  We always hope that some romantic magical thing will happen to fix our romance issues but the best way is to speak your feelings to him.      You dont have to ask him in a dark corner and tell him you have some big revelation, just do it casual.    My favorite is "I have a crush on you".  You find a way to work in to the conversation so it isnt too awkward.  You could watch for an opprtunity where he does something sort of funny or whatever and punch him on the arm lightly and say "your so cute, I have such a crush on you".  You see what I mean?      Either way though if you want anything magical to happen, sometimes you have to push it along.  I told my hubby I had a crush on  him 6 years ago and now we are expecting our second child.

Give yourself some more time.  Try to make sure that you both are on the same page.  Always keep your verbal communication lines open.  Talk to him ask him what he expects out of your relationship.  Is he looking for a lasting relationship or just a fling?  Even when he answers these questions this early always be cautious.  His actions will determine how he really feels about you further down the road.  Give yourself more time.  Don't be too easy to give him what he wants at this point.  Always make a man wait a certain amount of time before you share your most prized possession with him.  It makes them appreciate you more and it makes them feel special that you thought enough of them to share yourself.  Hope this helps.|`|18087d96616751e96dff78fce77aa268aa	wanting to spend more time with you than just to have sex, wanting to introduce you to his parents or family, introducing you to his friends, talking about the future with both of you in it...|`|53ad4cc7dd51e4f2352439c48f08ed6faa	that he doesnt laught at everything you are trying to be serious about and if he isnt avoiding you in anyway. if you make eye contact when you are talking to one another and if you ask him a question he has a serious anwser|`|54436ec579553d134ede9199a17d9fd1aa	there are no "signs" > just kick back and realize that in the grand scheme of things two months is like 2 seconds , they pass away pretty fast and there will be enough real serious stuff in your life that will determine if hes serious or not by the fact that a serious person takes everything seriuos not just a breezey {so far } relationship with another person.

See the thing is,  you havent had a chance to find out that there is more to your love life than what you remember.  There is something more real out there than you have felt before.  However,  you have nothing to compare to at the moment,  and sadly, it will take either a whole lot of time or another love in your life to make this go away.

There's thousands of experienced women that would love to get their hands on a guy like you and teach you exactly what they like.

Smile whenever you look at him and look deeply into his eyes, but don't show it in words...............Let him explore what is there in your heart.

And never be clingy, women don't like that, it creeps them out actually.|`|f4410d16d54cdc594a09cb77a46601f9aa	Truth be told-she's keeping her options open.  She isn't very interested in you but she hasn't met anyone "better" yet.  So she's keeping you as a backup.    If you want to play second string-put up with it.  She may see when in a crunch.  If you want a real relationship with someone who actually likes you and wants to spend time with you.  Move on.  There's someone better out there for you too.|`|2052e18fc0d72841570806264391dee7aa	Just 2 weeks & she's already looking on the negative side... it's not a good sign.

d50619beaea8176bb3efd294c7d045f0aa	I had that problem to the point that i had nightmares about being chased.  I think it has to do with wanting different things in a relationship and not being clear about it.  When I first started dating I was shocked about how soon guys wanted to commit.  Saying I love you on the first date!  Being official BF/GF.  There is no casual getting to know you, seeing if I like you.  I learned to be clear, saying:  I take a long time deciding if I like a guy.  I like to go out with them and then think about them.  I don't like to be pressured into a relationship, and I don't like to see too much of a person that I get sick of them.  If I tell them that right off the bat there is never any problem with clingy boys.  They know better.|`|AA12359948	Cling to you how?Tell em to get off then.|`|AA10912968	I personally don't like a clingy man either, but a lot of women do.

If he knows that you are asleep at 4 a.m....why is he calling?  This is the first sign of an unhealthy relationship.  The second sign of unhealthiness is the person that you are with making you feel bad on a regular basis.  If you are not getting what you need from someone (especially after you have exhausted all of your efforts on making healthy progress), don't waste your life trying to make a person what they are not.  Your boyfriend is probably a good person, just not the right one for you.  Life is too short to spend it on an emotional rollercoaster.  Figure out what it is that you want and go after it.  Good luck, sweetie!

9667a2880dd52b76cfd27734cddaca69aa	BIG SMILE! thats ahuge way to show you're interested in her. check her out head to toe, and if she catches you staring at her, let her catch you. touch her subtly (dont grope her, now). if the time comes up brush her hair out of her eyes (dont put ur hand too much in her hair, its kinda intrusive :p ) compliment her. "joke" about how fine she looks (dont be too pervy, just a simple lookin good will do). ask her to hang out- hang out together alone, she'll get to see how it would be to date you. have a REAL conversation, ya know? connect with her, woo her.|`|21edf7e3cc4e91438e1608aca1e638b3aa	give her a tiny gift, like a chocolate kiss|`|AA10805888	don't be subtle. just put that interest forward. you know she's cool so she probably wouldn't laugh in your face. if she's interested as well then you have a date. if she's not interested, at least she knows you are and may potentially come around to seeing you as an option. you'll still see each other on occasion so keep up that great rapport and you might get what you want in the end.

I knew he liked her more than I did and I did not want to risk losing my friend so I moved on.You should evaluate your feelings for this guy and see if it's worth possibly losing your friend. The two of you can agree  to make this guy not datable so neither of you feels betrayed or hurt and then you can move on. You should have a heart to heart with your friend and see how much she likes him. True friends will support you if it is really major love. But it seems as teenagers whom I assume you are one of, don't feel true love that is worth risking  everything for.

I think you should see why she is so jealous, I now she likes the same guy, but if she was a real true friend and he said yes to you, she should be happy for you. If you think  it's going to effect your friendship then talk to her and see if she would be mad if you did date him. If you are good friends with her, either you or your friend would find a way to resolve it so that you are both happy. I don't know if I'm right or wrong but that's what I think you should do.
c63384fe368fec4a1250387f5694cc0baa	You let him use you, it's the old saying that he has been having his cake and eating it.    He has taken advantage of you when you have been at your weakest and by telling you that he loves you is only taking you for a ride (excuse the pun).    He's not worth it, tell him where to go and to leave you alone...Oh and tell his other ex girlfriend that he's been playing you both off together, let her deal with him.|`|e5b7de1b2ed90ed52ad778ebde203aeeaa	I agree with telling his other x, he obviously just wanted wot he'd had b4.  All my x's have wanted to carry on as **k buddies, & as long as I was happy for it to happen that was fine.  But we both knew it wasn't anything more than the casual use of each other. As soon as either of us found someone new we'd move on.  He's been lying to u & using ur own mixed up feelings to get what he wants. As for the other x was he with her while u were together?  If so u need to get urself checked|`|AA11552202	You are going to get hurt by this guy he is using you for sex.|`|AA11755038	I think this is a definite case of "wanting the cake and eating it"  MOVE ON|`|8685f374025039b945ea382ba6cdb552aa	He's playing you.

8c4c85a092932c9c2f10043239260006aa	Her body language is most likely due to something you say. So make sure that about a week before you want a "good time" you dont say anything like:  1. That dress makes your butt look fat  2. I hate your mother  3. YOU SPENT HOW MUCH ON SHOES?!?    Those are just a couple that keep me out of the dog house. I'm sure there are thousands more. Sometimes every other word will offend her and you know what that time is so it will be best to wait a week for the "good time" and really it's best to just avoid her for that whole week.|`|a9d4697a5818d4541f67951affc514c8aa	When she washes her p-ssy before bed.|`|AA11939205	she's ready to play when she is playing with you, touching you as she walks by or just smiling at you alot.    she's not in the mood when she is sounding grumpy or just moving slow and groaning....leave this person alone!|`|AA11610088	when you approach her and try to touch her and she is cool and respond to it i say the you have a GO. in the other hand if you try to approach her and she rejects you then is a NO GO|`|AA11328491	If she is not screaming at you and telling you to go straight to h*ll or something like that........She is probably up for a good time?

There are several other cues she will give when she's ready for what you are probably ready for all the time. Wait until you are 100% sure of what she wants without any assumption on your part. If you assume she's ready when she's not, she may feel pressure from you which will turn her off completely and if you do that well it may be quite a while before she's actually ready again.|`|AA10453315	man, if you don't know that by now, you were wrong to get married.

If she is stressed, be nice to her, and draw her a nice bath, then maybe she will cheer up and get in the mood, or just show her you appreciate her. It is hard to tell, women vary. Good luck! :)|`|3a5af486fd6941fb853813329a81b9ddaa	Several ways to know if your wife is in the mood:  1. She continues to stay around you.  2. She touches you.  3. She gives you a soft innocent smile and turn away.  4. She dresses seductively.

What I want to know is , Why do men think they work harder at work than women? They are a weird race.  I use to start work in the morning at 5 to 8 then come home take my children to school and my ex to work. Do all the housework, gardening , including mowing the lawns etc. Then go back to work at 2 till 6 and then get home and cook tea, while the slob just laid back on the lounge telling me that he had a hard day at work. He never did anything, except abusing me for everything I did wrong, I had enough after 18 years. I got out.|`|338ed6c4b9b213d9bf7463f129305b70aa	Solving problems in any relationship relies on both parties being reasonable and not on scoring points or winning an argument. Obviously, in your situation, a compromise or understanding must be reached. He will never be motivated to do something if he feels he is being nagged. Also, his contribution must be recognized, because he could be doing nearly everything there is to be done, but if you are still going to be upset when he doesn't do something you want done, none of that effort will be worthwhile.|`|8095e6731dd71c3e158d2bf542e796e9aa	so in other words you are a normal housewife and mother. My husband would be gone for work all week i do normal stuff during week take care of child cook clean work a part time job but i save the good stuff for him on weekends he comes home on fridays and he does laundry he washes and dries it and i put it away he mows the lawn or it won't get done and takes trash out on sunday before he leaves again. That is all I expect of him because he works so hard all week long. That is part of marriage and being a stay at home mom. Don't ask him to do things as a favor tell him that you are getting overwhelmed and need some help with some things around the house.Give him hints like put the trash bag by the door and he cannot get out unless he picks up the bag and when he does just say well you have it picked up just take it out then. But in order for it to work you need to tell him how u feel without yelling or sounding like you are wanting a arguement. Just sit down one night with him and explain that you are feeling overwhelmed and understand that he works a lot but you would really appreciate some of his help around the house and just tell him a few things you would like him to do to help you.  Believe me when I say sometimes a person can take advantage of having their spouse around and get mad over simple things but like recently my husband just had a massive heart attack and they had to bring him back twice we did not expect any of this to happen so now I am working my pt time job and taking care of child and housework and taking him to doctors and still have to go through one more surgery in 2 days with him . But it is all worth it because he will live. You never know how much time you have with the ones you love so don't waste it on picking over the little stuff. Explain how you feel and move on from that point and if he don't start to help ask him why he feels he should not contribute to house hold chores. Good Luck and God Bless Remember in the end it usually ends up  you and your spouse are each others rock and support each other through the hard times

I would think if someone is that worried about their physical qualities then there is something else going on in their head.  Maybe it's self esteem or how they feel about themselves.  I don't know many people that have a great body and feel like their ugly.  Beauty fades, but intelligence lasts forever!!

If all she does is crack jokes then I would wonder if she is hiding behind all the humor to get attention.  Making me laugh is great, but all the time would become a bore.  Tell me something deep, tell me some of your goals, ask me about my hobbies.  Guys and girls want their mates to be interested in them and vice versa.  Humor is great, but not necessary.  I would rather make the girl laugh at my jokes and she could concentrate on making me feel important and worth hanging around.|`|2890eca9773f153e2a58a8215fb48b44aa	It depends.

I myself have alot of guy friends and even ex-boyfriends are my best friends. But you see that is because of all the love and caring for the mate that there was never any hatred between us. I also have friends who would help me with life itself so if you need a friend I can be one if you want.

AA11812715	Yes. There is so little time in this world. We always seem to think that we can put something off for a little while and pick it up again, but often this isn't the case.

He was not taught to respect people the way I was...he was not brought up to treat women the way they deserved.     By me taking the time to know HIM and then learning to love him unconditionally...He learned to love himself and to respect all people in general. Leading by example was really a huge factor...He changed because he decided he wanted to...but he still thanks me to this day for helping him grow "into himself" and become a better person    You may be exactly what this guy needs!    YES  YES  YES|`|543bfbb2ecaba5e4c711d9ddab0cbeb0aa	Everyone deserves a chance. he may have been hurt in the past and has a thing against girls.|`|ecc1cdc9e8648000b59191cf4281457faa	There's never any harm in trying something out, as long as you don't get in too deep. Which is easier said than done. Just be careful, and listen to your friends, because they often see things which we can't see for ourselves, and they give sensible advice! Good Luck.
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I would prefer a virgin because there is not a more flattering show of trust, love, and respect than a woman wanting a you to be her first lover. Here is the thing though, I am no longer a virgin myself and the only way I would have sex with a virgin now would be if we were in a serious and committed relationship... and if we were then it would make sense to me that we would be getting married, and if we were getting married I would want her to wait. I know that a woman that has had a handful of lovers might rock my world but the real fun would be in teaching an inexperienced woman about making love and sharing that intimacy with her. I am not looking for a porn star... I want to be with someone that loves me back... I do not  know just how that fits into your bet but that is my answer... good luck to you.|`|AA10700604	Hello behappy333,    Virginity is overrated.

I've done the Star Trek thing (boldly going where no man has gone before) and it was a bit weird.  Sex wasn't that great and I felt guilty afterward because we weren't in a relationship and didn't have any plands to be in one.  Plus non-virgins can sometimes show you a new trick or two.|`|c991deb1d43258ea2b2d67b38dd31374aa	I prefer virgins because if they are saving themself it shows that they stand for something. that tells me that they have very high moral values.
e6d942fc68739df2348ecb1d3f7fe315aa	Instead of waiting for the guy to ask you out, why not ask him out yourself. If he's not interested in you, he will sure turn down your invitation but if he like you, he will accept your invitation. Why wait for the guy to make the next move when you can take the 1st move rather keep on asking yourself the "He loves me, he loves me not" question over and over to yourself? Get a new target if this guy don't like you the way you like him. Maybe you will find a better man? Love is about taking risk, no risk no return right?|`|f2b1a09b580fe9049bc28c8e845abd3aaa	talk about a movie, and then say "iam gonna go and see it wanna come?"|`|64502109e22999a29537a786f279b298aa	well .. you could just ask him out . maybe he\'s shy     ======================================...

This one is always tough but you need to do it, even if it doesn't work out at least you'll know and then can move on.|`|1cf1acd5a1faed478f357d369acedec3aa	I commend you for giving him "signals" and resisting the urge to ask him out (many people would say you should just go for it, but trust me, guys would rather do the asking, they just don't admit it)    If you're sending him all the signals and he's not making a move, you can probably be sure he's not into you.  I recommend the book "He's Just Not that Into You."  It's VERY inciteful and funny, but will help you deal with his mixed signals, or lack thereof.    You'll find a great guy soon and this time HE'LL be the one giving YOU signals.    Best of luck!

I guess what the second guy says has some truth in it too - the guy you like is probably feeling a bit rejected, so try and get to chat to him soon.      If he's worth having, then he still likes you and won't mind once you explain!  If he's been put off already, - well, I reckon you're better off looking for someone who's a bit more sure what he wants and has more staying power!    You're not the only one to feel like this. (A long time ago now) I finished with my first boyfriend a couple of days after he asked me out because I was terrified about kissing him!! It wasn't that I didn't want to, but I was just scared I'd do it wrong. I'll never forget the shade of red that he turned, and I was too ridiculously shy to even tell him why I was backing off.  I didn't stop regretting that for a while.  When I did eventually have my first kiss, I had told the guy that I was nervous, and it really made all the difference.    Good luck!!
326c8453b2c1669cc34f37de0adb6e22aa	Do YOU think he is cheating? If you do I bet it's not just because he calls less. I think we know in our hearts when something is over, it's accepting it we have trouble with.    If you have no reason to think he is cheating other than he calls you less than he did then maybe you need to talk to him about how insecure you are with him and find a way to deal with it together.    Buy him a cell phone for Christmas maybe?    Whatever happens I wish you luck and happiness.

When someone tells me to stop singing, it's like a patient being in therapy and someone comes in and says 'Shut the hell up!'  I get angry,, and actually annoyed by them cuz I need to sing to express myself. Singing is more convent than running to grab a pen and pad, it easy and everyone does it.

She may be trying subconsciously to hang on to her own brain cell activity and reality. Good luck!

e1434a5f6ed4fa161831296eabe86efeaa	Thank you I agree with you 100%.  Women love confidence and the power it projects.  Confidence comes from doing.  Play sports, stop studying all the time, get off your a** and stop playing computer/video games, etc.  My number one recommendation is to start lifting weights, this is by far the biggest confidence booster that I know of.  I know I lift weights and I've gone out with plenty of non-Asian girls.  Remember it's the energy you project, have pride in being Asian, etc. and that confidence will project power (within yourself) and you can attract any woman you want, if you do this.

GOD didn't make trash so don't get treated like it|`|d108dd96db7b678c518ab4a9b9fcd713aa	I have been in this same situation and it really sucks bc no matter how hard you try, you can not change how you feel about that person and you swear they are the one for you bc that is what you want so badly in your heart to be.  I have been ignoring signs that my boyfriend may not really care about me anymore forever.. and when i finally just believed this it made life much easier. I was able to let him go then. In your case, maybe he really is the one for you and that would be great, but just try to be aware of things that are going on with him and the way he treats you, and try not to ignore it, so you can better evaluate the situation.  If you really feel you should get him back, you could first either let him see you with other guys, maybe go on some dates and be sure he knows about it, or another thing is to just act like you don't really care, bc the moment you start acting like the breakup did not bother you, thats when the guy usually wants you back.. it has worked for me|`|9294c13544d9d3a8f6e04b0c67d80aeaaa	give him a tight slap and get over with it|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	why would you want someone who cheated on you????  doesn't make any sense.  move on!!!|`|d0737ef8f11da887c8ae5b3067f7ff97aa	no,don`t take him back again.He`ll cheat again ang again.There r lots of boys out there!|`|5d3c9df2955b5effd82152f81ee2bac4aa	why you wanna get cheat back again and going the same situation again. is this call fun or love?|`|AA12281158	If he does not want you back there is no way to get back with him.|`|d2bb978cc2bcae45cfb4af076babe8b4aa	Please use punctuations...I lost my breathe reading you !|`|19e149298524414f211601ae2b313518aa	well i know u love him but why be with him if he cheated on you.

AA10408209	You worry too much!!! Obviously there is something there if you guys have been together for 8 months and are still together now. We cannot answer whether or what you have with him is love but from the sounds of it, it is. Stop stressing about whether or not it is love and enjoy your relationship for what it is with this man. Live in the moment and don't worry about the past or the future. I'm sure everything is fine and that you are worrying yourself over nothing.

Love has no limitations. My advise to you is that if you are in love with someone than you should have no doubts.

333304d4d02132e9d369d889459b06d4aa	It depends on whether you have levels of friends... I personally have 3 levels:    1. Acquaintances - The largest group. It is composed of people that I like hanging out with but would not confide in. I love this type because the relationship is not complicated.    2. Good Friends - Small group. It is composed of people I've known for a long time and can talk to about anything. I know that they really know me no matter what others may think or may say. Only down side, is that you really have to cultivate these relationships because there are some expectations on both sides.    3. Best friends/Soul Mates - Only one or two people. These are people that you seem to have a spiritual connection with. Mine is my spouse.|`|AA10799113	Someone who shares with you.|`|3192dd71479f39e347fbd4f88c2c90f3aa	someone, that you can say anything too, no matter how ugly, or mean (except I'm going to murder you're children or something phycotic like that) and they'll forgive you easily if you apologive, and forget about it-- basically someone how is always there for you|`|7ea315d431a1759f36593b96220d041caa	FRIENDS ARE BACKSTABBER'S WITH A SECRET IDENTITY'S|`|AA10739773	A friend is someone you share a bond with.

AA10744296	Sometimes no matter what you do, those around you will never be happy.  And when you try to help out, it sometimes happens that you are not appreciated.    That being said, it sounds like you are enabling them, by contributing to the bills when neither of them are employed.  And if you continue to do so, they have zero incentive to get off their butts and do for themselves.    Weigh the input from your friend, and any input from your sis and her b/f and decide for youself where in this picture you really want to be.  Perhaps the best thing for all of you is for you to move out, get your own place, and let them take responsiblilty for their own actions and consequences thereof.  It's called Tough Love.  Good luck and peace be|`|AA11939205	If your the one making the $$, simply cut off the cable and all other forms of entertainment.

332c8821f687befd4fec2563f3ad9d55aa	You should call her on her lies.  You should really grind it in and corner her and put her in a spot.  Make it really difficult for her to lie.  Keep asking questions and doubt everything she says and delve further and further to get to the truth.  If she contradicts herself because she retracted a lie, then really make it known that she lied and that she is now caught because you grilled her.  Really rub it in.  Really grill it in her.|`|eacddddc08ab2f00ff52e4fd2bedfd80aa	She's a compulsive liar! I would leave her alone and find some new honest friends.|`|J02rggZgaa	Well am sorry to say but that girl is not your friend. A true friend will not lie to you because she would not like to hurt your feelings even though if she has an award in lying. If you love somebdy you don't lie to them. Her constant lies to tells you that she's not your friend and that she doesn't care about you. Do yourself a big  favour, dump her and look for somebody that has the same value as you, somebody that trust you  and respect your feelings.|`|huoiz2YSaa	Move on, there are lots of people out there that are willing to be your friend without all the crap attatched.  Also, if you seek approval from others, you'll end up disappointed most of the time.  Try spending some time alone on a regular basis and accepting where you are at in the present moment.  If you are accepting of yourself, other will feel inclined to accept you for who you are aswell.  Take up a skill or join a social group.

fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	It really depends. If I am looking for someone for a serious relationship, it would be someone nice personality wise. We should complement each other. We should be able to talk to each other and have somethings in common to talk to each other about.    Physically no preference in hair color except natural. I hate girls who wear tons of makeup. She has to have a nice laugh and a nice smile. With those two, she can make my day and make my worries go away. She also has to accept me as I am.  The ultimate question is will she go on a date with me?   :D I hope that helps.|`|3ad4603f634dd556102f48bb0d29d641aa	beautiful honey with a beautiful body|`|gQkjaYNXaa	Commonality, full on lack of morals. A history of self abuse. Someone who's desperate and certifiable. Stone fox will be more than adequate, and a plain Jane is just right. But women should accentuate the differences, nylons, heels and other such things should be visible. I don't care for women who feel self-conscious in lingerie. The best I've found was an athlete/model who could really improve a pair of bike riding shorts. After all of that, or before that, one can talk and get to know what's working upstairs. What I guess to say is, they just fit right.|`|HPFmMK8Qaa	When looking for a date I look for a woman who looks as if she can enjoy herself without the stress of looking toward the future in the realtionship but seeing it as only a date.|`|cqPML6k0aa	Character and faith in God.|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	every guy looks for different things in different girls. i personally look for turst, honest, cuteness, a girl who tries to understand and who is not too much demanding...|`|188c06c0ef12c8c198734c93c413485eaa	Someone who is emotionally secure, down-to-earth, and not too hyper.

I look for a woman who appears serious about life.  Someone who has been hurt in her past love life actually.  Not that I get pleasure from others pain its just that I don't find people who haven't been hurt and recovered well to be capable of true love.  I wouldn't date anyone I wouldn't want to someday love.  Otherwise its a waste of my time.
5db14b93b6f8b7df5274c10511ae863baa	sure why not? why have all the dressing at the top? you could dive right in i suppose, the tomatos are usually at the bottom. and the dressing would be a little much - but some like it tangy like that. but once you get past the upper strata, there won't be any flavor left. so it's probably best to toss the salad.|`|1ba7acc31a90f4c4670f70bea72551c2aa	i do sometimes, you have to be in the right mood, don't just dive right in, work your way. personally ineed a couple drinks first.|`|7c9d979bfb7e1d907a9eded964b5f582aa	I've never had my salad tossed, so I couldn't say....I definitely would not reciprocate though......|`|a3b366b96d1758cf46dc94ba1c834a0caa	Yeah I don't mind, as long as I'm comfortable with myself at the time (i.e. I know I've showered today, not gone number 2's lately, etc). If it's done right, it's great I reckon. I'd say it would probably be a good idea to gently test the waters before just diving right in, maybe a little quick lick or something just in case she's not down with that action.
AA10785321	Hmm...well, Valentines Day is coming up; sounds like the perfect chance to swoon her (romantic dinner, flowers, etc).  Make sure that you really tell her that you love her and that you're dating her because of that fact- not for any other reason.  I'm sure things will work out okay...good luck :)|`|3ba037b05903ac9005634f2b380e25f8aa	You can't really tell if you are going to last, unless both people in the relationship feel the same way about each other and their future.      Right now, your girlfriend is probably doubting your relationship for a number of reasons.  After being together for a year, a relationship can become routine.  You might be less affectionate then in the beginning, or feel that you don't have to impress her that much.  This is normal, and just signifies that you are comfortable with your relationship.  However, your girlfriend feels differently and is questioning wheter or not you still care for her.    Sit down with her and discuss your relationship.  If you still care for her, let her know.  Communication is what keeps relationships alive.|`|2f31e428ffb810e47bfb5aeb31238e69aa	Tell her that. And not just in words. You need to SHOW her you really love her. Be romantic. Even if that isn't your style. V-Day is coming up -- Use that to your advantage too.    buy her a single rose and a card for no reason at all, but just to say you love her. Give her a hug when she least expects it. Bring her diner, home cooked by you. Little things like that always make a girl feel special.|`|NJ1RNOI4aa	go out of your way to plan a very nice day and night out for her. Don't take her to things you like or even enjoy take her to things she loves. That will show her that you think for her interests and needs over yours. Pamper her and put her ahead of you. Hang out with her friends for no reason. Just some suggestions.|`|e9ee86b90137e45294945d886e6ecfddaa	Hey What's up dude, Well take a breath and relax and tell her for feelings. It sounds girly i know but it works. And when i say tell her all of them and emphasize the fact you want to be with her and that you love her. And dudue its gonna be ok. Just remember for every person out there. They do have a soul-mate And i hope you find her goodluck bro. And god bless.|`|344acc00fb74cdff93a2852e75aecab8aa	If both of you love each other and can make it through all the hard times then its a really good chance you'll last.  You and her both need to start doing things to show one another that you're still in love with each other. It doesn't have to be anything big, just little simple things work.  And try to do some things that add some spice into your relationship so it doesn't feel like the same thing all the time.  And last, just tell her how much you love her.  Let her know how you feel about her.

RUN FOR THE HILLS !|`|4JvCeTm1aa	GET AWAY from him before you start believing in what he says.  My family always bugged me about my weight, even though I was skinnier than all of them. as a result I became anorexic because I started believing them. My bmi was 19 when I started to believe I was fat. I became extremely skinny with a bmi lower than 17 which is unhealthy.  I got away from those who bugged me about my weight and with the support of some of my friends I got back on track.  I still don't eat whenever I'm alone because I don't feel like it. I remember I used to enjoy food but not much anymore. If it weren't for those who loved me for who I was rather than what I looked like I would have probably be dead now!

OR be a man, and stick with your girlfriend.|`|EhD84WLQaa	Be honest with yourself.  If your girlfriend meant all that much to you, you wouldn't even think about dating someone else.  So maybe you should just tell her you just wanna date around right now.  But DON'T cheat.|`|wl7Vf0Nbaa	Aren't you already in an intimate relationship? If you are truly close to your girlfriend you shouldn't be so easily persuaded into dating these girls. Ask yourself," Do I even know them very well?" Your girlfriend may hate you if she ever realizes you were interested in other women.|`|QfhqkHacaa	They see you are taken and good to your girlfriend. Well, they should have thought of that when you were single. Not if you don't want to lose your girlfriend. I don't know about dating girls who "lay in wait" and hang out on street corners and in parking lots. Take it as a compliment and you're a good catch.      A man is judged by the way he treats the women in his life.

1INtkpfIaa	its not a marriage where by you start  to think about  alot like,   if i leave ,how will  my children take this and how will they survive etc......   But this is an affair dude , you are so free to do what is right for you ,   you know that this is not what you want even tho you still love the girl in a different kinda way ...isnt so bad ..    just sit her down and tell how about it , coz even if she has said before that,   if you had to breakup she would kill herself ....its not  true believe me...   we are so many who use that expression , its true to say all those things but doing it , i dont think she would do it .  I bet she would have long nights with tissue boxes by her side (crying out )   coz breaking up isn't so easy to go tho .. but with time she will copy up , same with your side .    So if its really true you want to breakup with this girlfriend of yours that you have dated for 3 yrs and found out that all this was in vein ...  So why don't you do it the right way .... tell her you just cant go on doing this, when you know its not what you want .    just do the right thing  and free yourself ... life is what you make it .    Good luck and remember , life goes on, no matter what  !|`|ubDQTBudaa	Sweetie you only thinking about the bad stuff she have done with you , think about the good stuff too............    If you love her ............Give her a chance !!!!!!|`|XCHoHCrnaa	Tell her parents/family/friends you cant be with her for the reasons you gave us and ask for their support leaving her, good luck x|`|AA11900069	Get tacit and moody and forgetful for the next few weeks.  No intimacy, sharp moods and no laughing, and she will want to see the back of you!|`|heddCBy1aa	That's really hard and I'm sorry. I just got through something similar: a boyfriend of 4 years I left because I found someone else. Unfortunately you're right, you should leave. Anything else would be stringing her on. And I completely understand you still loving her...the sucky thing about this is that it's pretty much going to be impossible for you to get out of this without hurting her. Here is what I recommend.    1. Leave her in person. Don't try to do it over the phone or anything.  2. Tell her you need time apart to reevaluate your feelings, that you still love her, and that you'r really sorry this is hurting her.    If she threatens suicide (and you believe that it isn't just a cry for attention), then warn her that if she keeps threatening that you will call the police. If she doesn't listen, then really call the police. They will come and take her to a safe place (probably a hospital) and make sure she gets help. Trust me I have personal experience with that. Nothing horrible will happen to her if you get her the help she needs.     All in all, this blows no matter what you do. But if you do it gently and tastefully, it can blow less. Good luck man :(|`|1d8ccc50c6ace4eafcb394c95a11bf1aaa	Do you love her? or are you staying because shes threatened to kill herself?    First work out what you really want. If you want to stay then you need to have a serious chat.    If you want to leave then leave. Ask her this when she threatens to kill herself ....."Do you really want me to stay just because your threatening to kill yourself..... and not because i WANT to stay?"    Some times you have to be really hard. You will feel terrible and for a while will be waiting for the phone to ring  but you know your girlfriend do you really think she would do this?    Work out what you really want and go from there    GOOD LUCK|`|qk6DYRxcaa	if yu dont want to be with her you should break up with her.  if she finds out about this, she'll be more hurt.|`|BYOXsyseaa	Re : emotional blackmail. If someone threatens to kill themselves if you leave..you have to be firm and say "I'd be very sorry if you did, but that's not my responsibility".    No one needs to hear that..it's very low of her.    |`|zE0Ya38xaa	50 ways to leave your lover 1/step out the back Jack...... 2/just drop off the key Lee  3/no need to be coy Roy ..... just listen to me....  the answers all inside your head the answers easy if  you take it logically|`|ngmgQ2wMaa	It's a sad fact of life that this happens. Obviously, you are not suited to each other and maybe it is time to go your seperate mail. Staying for the sake of emotional blackmail will drive a wedge between 2 people who were once good together.|`|AzrGiUMOaa	Hey! I know what you mean about emotional blackmail. I have been through that before.Some bluffed but there was this one lady who actually did,but the doctors saved her.She suffered a brain damage from the poison.I guess you just have to know if they will or not.But staying in a relationship where you are not happy is taking that same poison yourself.
1ae169d5afb570e364ee51963f52e1d9aa	The baby mama is clearly upset at the fact that he married you and is not with her, so she is using the child to put friction between you two...and maybe break you two up so she can try and win him again. Sadly, she's teaching the daughter hate too.    You need to have serious talk with your husband as soon as possible and tell him he needs to put the baby mama in check and tell her that it's not cool to teach daughter to hate you. The baby mama has to realize that you are his husband and she and the daughter has to respect your marriage...and that means having the daughter show respect to you when she comes over.     You and your husband needs to have a talk about disciplining your child and his daughter...if yall haven't discussed it already.    I agree with your feelings that you don't want her over at your house if she keeps being disrespectful. Your home is supposed to be full of love and respect, not anger and drama.    If your husband doesn't work to put both of them in check, that is a huge red flag and you may want to take a step back and have a second look at your marriage.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	ever heard of the saying "ignore a b****" (the ex wife) shes brainwashing her child and putting stuff in her head because she feels threatened by you, shes afraid that little girl will love you, take the little girl out sometime and do a girly thing she likes to do and get some stuff and make some crafts she would lie , you will eventually convince her that your not so bad after all. Your hubby wont say anything cause he fears losing his child to the evil ex, so for the childs sake he says nothing, its not because he wont take your consideration of your feelings, he protecting his baby girl he loves. treat her with the kindest respect and if you want to get back at the ex wife you can either Ignore a B**** or kill her with kindness|`|4e7bea630da81cb077ea42ca9591e26eaa	you need to make him understand that you will not put up with it. i have the same problem. i have been with my h usband for 8 years and his son is now 11. his mom tells him not to do what i tell him to and to be mean to his little brother. i do not do any of the dicipline but his father handles it and he knows now that the rules his mom gives him do nothing but get him in serious trouble. also i would NEVER allow his exes other children who are not his come too. mines ex tried that and i asked her what her regular sitter charges because i only watch for free my friends and families kids and she is neither. she never asked again. good luck.|`|6f977ff61c3033064962bbd63a0ce0a2aa	You need to take the kids out and show them the best time. Have ice cream, play tips in the park and generally have fun. Ignore the comments and looks they will eventually go away becuase she will see that you are fun and you aren't a bad person.   Be as positive as you can and never let her see you angry becuase of the way she is treating you. It will be a victory for her and confirm everything her mother is telling her. Be positive and bubbly and she will see her mother isn't always right.

48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	Remembering details is always a good sign.  I'm sure he's played over and over again in his head to remember all the details because it was a pleasant experience.  He also could be very polite and have a good memory.  If he shows some more interest in other things that you do then he's definitely interested.|`|By2HAU85aa	Some people remember the details, some don't. My boyfriend and I are deeply in love and he doesn't remember sh*t! A guy that likes you will go out of his way to see you or talk to you.

He HAS BEEN TELLING YOU by his actions!!!!    DUH.  Time for you to decide what you want to tell him...you want him, or not?    And stop playing this stupid game with him (and don't tell me you didn't know what you and he both were doing!)|`|5RBiRo3Paa	then ask him if you ae the joker type he may think its funny so he can get your attention|`|AA10137451	well you need to make the decision whether you like him or not. I you do go for it and if you don't you need to tell him to stop and if  he continues making comments about playing with your boobs, then you need to report this to your supervisor as this is sexual harassment.|`|xexrGghraa	He likes you, but probably is not sure how you will "take that".  Also, the fact that you two work together may also be another barrier, since he probably doesn't want to mess up things at work if things don't work out (or if you reject him if/when he tells you he likes you).|`|duI3ZZiCaa	it seems like he does, but maybe he's just trying to play hard to get.  or maybe he's to shy to actually admit he likes you.
AA11375224	No, it won't make you loose.   Your body is made to birth a baby then go back to normal, so nothing you could do with just your fingers would come even close to that.  Just do whatever feels good and enjoy it.|`|Bv48PI5Vaa	the skin on some ones ear freaks me out.  some woman wear earrings that and to heavy, and stretch there ears.    Luckily its not the same in our pants.  There are muscles there, and if you exercises a bit every day, you can be so tight you can shoot out ping pong balls.    There is nothing wrong with masturbating yourself, how ever don't over do it.  To much apple pie makes you sick of apple pie, and then when the real thing comes, you wont want it.    Hope you enjoy yourself.  I now i do...|`|BUzeqqrnaa	when a woman perform masturbation is not good at all so i would plead with you to stop it.|`|xcYGkeA2aa	I don't think you can get loose by fingering your self .

The muscular walls of the vagina will contract back into place, fingers will not make you loose.|`|d22d9c6ceb0a29374e859c4ec8e14bcbaa	I'm not a woman...but from my experience, it will loosen up for a little bit. But if you go without for awhile it will tighten back up. My step brother told me that 2 weeks after his wife had their child that she was back to normal.

fuu6ExvXaa	si certo,ma sicuramente pochi ormai rispetto come una volta che esistevano i poeti doc in persona e poi una volta vi esisteva davvero il vero amore e saper cogliere la vera semplicit di un sentimento puro e senza limiti..oggi quasi si sta perdendo la fantasia,la semplicit va a diminuire nella massa,e inoltre i veri valori non vanno pi rispettati come una volta tipo l'amore,il matrimonio etc...quindi non vi  piu la fonte per poter scrivere  poesie d'amore o crearle...Solo quelli che ancora sono semplici come noi  possono scriverle,e io so per certo che tu sei molto romantico,me lo sento... e ti faccio quindi i miei complimenti di essere un ragazzo cosi.|`|efzzb1xtaa	la gente non so..io scrivo poesie fin da piccola sia d'amore che di altro tipo..besos besos|`|4QwK1vjuaa	Alcune le ho conosciute,si ce ne sono,un mio amico x esempio mi faceva leggere le poesie che scriveva e mi venivano i brividi,qualcuno  molto bravo ad esprimere nero su bianco ci che sente dentro e una poesia d'amore  sempre ben accetta,magari a me ne avessero scritte,ora si va avanti solo con gli sms..peccato.Ciao.|`|jtjPQMN3aa	Chi ha un sentimento si, le s scrivere eccome.

AA11939205	My girl has a set, and she is really happy when she wears them and I take care of her needs...
tYmhDsb7aa	He is looking for an excuse.    Tell your buddy to get it right iwth his wife before he finds himself all alone.|`|6gCJ7NDQaa	If he gets mad when you ask him that  then he not ready at all.   He just want to get some new stuff|`|AA11939205	sounds like he's just looking for a excuse to get something new. and he's not ready to see his wife with another guy either.

Don't listen to her.|`|AA11939205	well, maybe you have done such a fine job of building up her self esteem that now you've created a little monster!|`|z1HsFSxnaa	no  she loves u|`|x0FPGmojaa	Depends on what your relationship with her is.|`|2e71125e7a9ae0d8fe731fbc6e94adb6aa	How does that make you feel when she says that?    Apparently you think it sounds needy or you wouldn't have asked the question.     If that statement scares you then you need to think about why it scares or bothers you.     Maybe she's not the right one for you!
AA11939205	sounds like she is really infatuated with you, I'd be careful!
xZjnWnoNaa	i would pull her aside and have it out with her,she is just a waste of space and she is no friend otherwise she would not do this to you..hope it all calms down,good luck,hope i have helped you out xxx|`|yyn7nFKWaa	sounds like she thought you were gay!!! :D    perhaps you should just chat and not move too fast... though i'm sure other gay women would have been interested... ;)|`|AA10912968	She's a loser.  She probably thought you were trying to pick her up.  The next opportunity you have to speak to her, tell her that you thought she was a nice person, and she automatically assumed that your offer of friendship was a pick up line.  Tell her for the record that you're not gay and even if you were, you wouldn't choose someone as ugly as she is.  Don't let this incident with one horrible person deter you from making other friends.

I don't think many answers can be provided without that information.|`|f4Tksyd8aa	The former bf sounds like a smooth talker. Be careful. If this new bf is sweet and fun and considerate, don't blow it. Stay with him. Why hurt him just to go back with someone who may hurt you again?|`|AA10025996	Your ex is your ex for a REASON, at least one; think long and hard about that before you take him back. was he unfaithful? Abusive? Emotionally unavailable? Whatever he did, he's unlikely to change. Being a guy, I know.|`|ra9kjPjuaa	I really think that you should give him another chance. I do not know what the reason was that he gave you to end the relationship.  But you still have feelings for him, and obviously he is still in love with you.  There are reasons for the way you two feel about each other, so I say go for it!|`|psSD2BJaaa	It sounds like the situation I was just in. I known this guy for a long time since we were kids, he has always liked me, and four years after I met him I decided to finally hook up with him, we became so close, he was always there for me through basically everything I have ever been through, and shortly after I hooked up with him I broke things off because I wasnt used to what I was feeling for him, I messed up bad though because I used this other guy as the reason, and had the other guy there, and everything instead of just explaining to him how I was scared from not being used to feeling so strongly for him. Well we ended up spending time apart from all of this I felt like we needed to, and I am sure after me breaking up with him like that he did too, I know it hurt him because he has always felt strongly about me. Now recently we started talking again, and when I look back on it all, everything between us it was amazing like you we were always able to be ourselves around eachother, and no matter what it didnt make him think differently of me, and it was the same for me. It was just great between us. What we have is different from anything I ever had with anyone else, and I always regretted breaking things of with him. Well anyway when we started talking again I just told him how I been thinking about him, and wondering how he was, and he brought up all the things we used to do, and how he missed me too, and how maybe if we were still together, etc.. We kept talking, and a couple weeks later here we are back together. I guess what I am trying to say is when you have a relationship that good no matter what had happened in the past to mess things up it is worth holding onto, and giving it another try. I have tried to be with over seven people since him, and each time it didnt come close to what we had, and only made me miss him more. I regretted that we broke up for a while, and thought that he would never give me another chance for a while because I know I hurt him, and how long it was before we started really trying to keep in touch again. Now I couldnt be happier. I believe relationships like this are meant to be, and I would never do anything to mess it up again because I know I will never have what I have with him with someone else. Nothing can compare. I think its definetly worth a shot because at least then you dont have to wonder "what if" down the road because you didnt give him one more chance, at least you will have the closure you need to move on if things dont work out this time.

sXHO6PeMaa	Step out of the rut.  Don't expect your partner to do it for you.  You are the one that is feeling it, so it is more your problem than his.  It usually means that it is time to challenge yourself in life, not necessarily in marriage.  It might be time to look at incorporating new things, or activities into your life.  Things that you thought you might like to do but haven't gotten around to doing it.  Things that challenge you.  Try a zip line, or seadoos. This is your life, and you have to take the time while you are here to explore the things in life that will help you to grow.  By stepping out of your comfort zone, and exploring something new in your life, your relationships with people will feel different because you feel alive. When you change something within yourself, you will change how people react to you.  If you invite people to join you on these new adventures, it will change them too, therefor changing how you react to them.  However, try hard to just focus on changing you, so that everything you connect with will change and continue to create chain reaction for different experiences.  Good luck!|`|35b426ef4a3e21311d48ca5b6ac491fcaa	Just watch porn together. That should count as spontanious!

First, everyone is in a rut.  Some people know it and some don't.  Some people like their rut and some don't.      Some people mistake "rut" for "consistency".  Assuming you know the difference, the short answer is do something different!    Find new friends, get a hobby, go somewhere new, take a different route to work, go find different work, change your hairstyle, get new clothes....or....    try meditating on the rut.  Sink down into the deepest part of the rut and see what awaits you.  There may be a deep lesson.  Go into the rut and look for it.    I wish you Peace.|`|qICjmDDYaa	Vodka and orange juice is always a good solution.|`|AA10356453	Yes Yes OOOOOO Yes it does its called The Impulse Jack Rabbit!!    >,> did I just say that?    anyway, join a book club or stay  home with ....  or a gym or stay home with....  or maybe go have a coffee in the mall and people watch or stay home with........|`|AA11305351	Yes, do something different! Watch movies all night, go to the mall, and "people watch"....go to the library and read a book. Think what you would like to do if you had the chance, and do it(as long as it's legal, and not immoral)...get out of that rut!|`|KqEjtljeaa	climb out|`|NqbBjS0raa	Sometimes we all have that happen to us at one time or another. You need to shuffle the deck a bit better to mix up the things you have interest or things you do, so it doesn't always feel or be the same. Then add some new things in there to give it variety. Remember variety is the spice of life!       Try to do things spontaneously and let chemistry take over, if you read, meet or talk to someone else that floats your boat better than anyone before. Life is short and you might be missing out on the best thing, but can't see it because it's too close. Learn to know a good thing by life's experiences. Now quit reading and jump in there! Good luck and happy nice chemistry finding.............|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	let others give you motivation and support.....like me or yopur family and friends

En conclusin se podran tratar de una amiga que se siente celosa por la relacin,  pero que mantengan una amistad en comn con la pareja  o tambin de un amigo de la novia, que este interesado en ella y que adems conozca de las andanzas del novio, por lo cual le enva los mail de advertencia para que este en alerta de la situacin y lograr mediante esto la separacin de la pareja.  En ambos casos, existe una marcada preocupacin por el bienestar de la novia, por lo cual seria muy til para poder dilucidar quien podra se el autor de los mails, las intensiones que demuestra dentro del mensaje, porque si solo se tratan de  advertencias y no existen intensiones de buscar la separacin definitiva, me inclino a suponer que puede tratarse de una amiga de la novia, pero si las advertencias van acompa?ada de ciertos detalles que comprueben la mala actitud del novio y que inste a la separacin estara indicando que se tratara  de un hombre que siente mucho inters por la novia y que de algn modo busca separarla de su novio mas halla que tenga o no las posibilidades de concretar una relacin con ella.  Estas serian las dos hiptesis mas claras que se podra considerar en una situacin como esta.

Es normal que niegue que hizo esa pagina, el no es tonto en decir que la preparo. Por lo tanto, ponte en alerta. Si el dice que no la hizo, pues dile que tal vez, pudo haber sido un fantasma, o tal vez se escribio sola, eso es una forma de seguirle la corriente, pero diciendole en la cara mentiroso.

ZqTc58P0aa	Sei una ragazza meravigliosa, soltanto per il fatto che hai avuto l'umilt di raccontarci la tua storia, e come padre di famiglia devo dirti che hai fatto bene.  Se   vero che i genitori hanno l'importante compito di educare i figli, mantenerli, e soprattutto seguirli nel corso di tutto il periodo che loro coabiteranno nello stesso tetto,  pur vero che i genitori  non devono pretendere nulla dai propri figli, i quali quest'ultimi, hanno diritto alla massima libert, a non essere "ricattati" per ogni qualunque cosa il genitore  in dovere di fare, e certamente non deve essere considerato un qualcosa in pi. Tutto questo a mio avviso.  Insomma, per precisare, per quanto pu essere dura la vita di noi genitori, non abbiamo alcun diritto di pretendere proprio nulla dai nostri figli, se non soltanto che ci rispettino e che osservino una vita dignitosa fin quando almeno abiteranno con noi.  Tutto ci premesso, considerato che tu sei una ragazza molto educata, rispettosa con i tuoi genitori, insomma una che non crea problemi al padre ed alla madre, purtroppo e mi dispiace dirtelo, difficilmente potrai cambiare la mentalit di loro, per cui abbi pazienza, perdonali.  Certamente, un giorno, penso non lontano, avrai la possibilit di rivalutare la tua vita, ritrovandoti in un contesto pi accettabile, adoperando questa tua triste esperienza, per migliorare il rapporto con i tuoi futuri figli e.. partner.  Pazienza, prendi questo lato positivo, stringi i denti e come penso tutti gli amici di answers ti auguro un mondo di bene e ti mando un bacione dal profondo del mio cuore, come se fossi mia figlia.  Ciao|`|O9sUirDbaa	spesso le mamme nn capiskono nulla.. purtroppo la tua evidentemente  stressata dal lavoro... perk nn inizi a fare un po piu di lavori domestici ma ad uscire di piu?  compensi in una cosa e scompensi in un' altra!|`|5991218c9e883742d3eaa04b677902f3aa	La mia mamma ha sempre fatto come la tua e anche molto peggio. Un bel giorno ho deciso di essere me stessa e mi sono ribellata.....Ti faccio notare che ho piu di 40 anni e avrei anche il diritto di essere me stessa e di non il suo zerbino. Non credi??? Sai cos'ha fatto la mia cara mammina???Mi HA SBATTUTA FUORI DI CASA  e non mi ha mai pi cercata. Guarda che non sono una delinquente e ho una famiglia a dir poco splendida e felice. Pertanto attenzione.....purtroppo esistono anche persone che si fanno chiamare mamma ma sarebbe meglio facessero un altro lavoro, magari il killer.|`|ziOMH7Mjaa	Hai fatto davvero bene a tirare fuori tutto...Non conosco tua mamma e non posso ne voglio giudicare ma probabilmente nella sua critica si nasconde una profonda stima..Ricorda ke chi ti critica e' il primo che sa che quanto vali...Forse lei non lo ha ancora capito...Ma e' un classico.i genitori  trovano sempre qualcosa per criticare i propri figli..coraggio..fatti scivolare tutto addosso|`|q9ZW6NKaaa	Non sei stata assolutamente noiosa con le tue considerazioni, anzi fai riflettere su come i giovani siano pi responsabili di quanto si possa pensare. Personalmente posso dirti che vivo da sola da quando ho 19 anni, ma oggi come oggi con la precariet del lavoro non  semplice essere indipendenti quindi fino a quando puoi, se ci ti fa stare bene, rimani con i tuoi genitori, cerca di farlo per con intelligenza, contribuendo nelle mansioni domestiche. Soprattutto cerca di non rimandare le faccende al giorno dopo. Ho imparato che se rimandi prima o poi ti ritroverai a dover svolgere una mole di lavoro enorme, mentre se ogni giorno dedichi un p del tuo tempo alle pulizie domenistiche neanche te ne rendi conto e avrai una casa sempre ordinata e pulita :) Per quanto riguarda tua madre non pu pretendere che sia solo tu a occuparti della casa, per il suo lettone matrimoniale lei o tuo padre(perch non sta scritto da nessuna parte che sono sole le donne a dover fare la Cenerentola della situazione!!!) se lo vogliono ritrovare sistemato la sera basta che la mattina si svegliano 10 minuti prima e se lo rifanno!!! Tu cerca di non trovarti in situazioni in cui possano dirti:guarda dove hai lasciato le scarpe, guarda i vestiti sul divano, guarda i tuoi piatti sporchi nel lavandino...non metterli insomma nelle condizioni di poter puntare il dito e di lamentarsi di quanto sei disordinata. Alle tue cose devi pensarci tu, cos come devi contribuire agli ambienti comuni, ovvero gli spazi che usano tutti, ma non deve essere solo compito tuo, ma di tutti coloro che li utilizzano, quindi tua madre, tuo padre ed eventuali fratelli o sorelle. Se poi ti chiedono gentilmente di aiutarli nelle loro cose se ne hai voglia e se lo fanno senza pretenderlo allora a tuo buon cuore, ma non sei obbligata!!! ;)|`|p1cslWD5aa	Hei...non rattristarti. Guarda il segreto  che tutte le mamme sono cos. La frase  tipica...ci augurano sempre di non avere figlie come noi.

Se loro sono nel torto marcio ed evidente, non lo ammettono, ma anzi il loro torto si trasforma in ragione a tutti gli effetti!!  io non riesco a tenermi tutto dentro e quindi voglio far valere anke i miei diritti, ma loro reagiscono male.. e quindi l'unica cosa ke devo fare  ignorarli.. ma nn ci riesco!!

Even Indian men are encouraged to 'sow' their wild oats before settling down to marriage and white females are seen as an easy source of satisfaction for obvious reasons.   If you expect any man beyond 18 to have a sex free ( Virgin) life it may be possible! but is very unlikely and there is no difference with Indian males  living in UK as to number of sex partners on average.    If you are looking to find any male in Uk  whom has not had sexual relations with  another person by age of say 30  you will have a very long look.|`|c1151c182f36d1332c4303038b1c37f6aa	if you try you'll see. don't look at the color. we are all the same.

Ha iniziato a girare tutta la casa per cercare "prove",  figurati se avesse trovato un diario !    Questo per dirti che se prendi un'abitudine, poi te la porti dietro, e dato che la vita cambia le persone, i sentimenti, ecc.    sempre meglio non scrivere mai !

Si elle est persuade qu'elle n'a pas d'effort  faire, tu n'arriveras jamais  tre heureux avec elle car elle fera toujours ce qu'elle voudra sans penser  toi.

A la longue, tu vas en souffrir et tu vas te poser des questions sur ton propre comportement alors que tu n'es pas en cause, le problme vient d'elle.  Si elle te respectait, elle prendrait les mots doux que tu lui donnes et en serait heureuse. Si elle t'aimait vraiment, elle saurait comprendre tes regards car vous seriez sur la mme longueur d'ondes...  A toi de voir ce que tu fais, mais cette fille n'est pas m?re pour une histoire d'amour.  Mon conseil est de lui faire comprendre que tu ne feras pas tout ce qu'elle te demande, que tu n'es pas infrieur  elle et que tu mrites le respect. Ca passera ou ?a cassera mais sans regret  avoir.  Plus tu feras ce qu'elle voudra, plus elle en demandera et moins elle te respectera.

Ta copine est peut-tre dans une phase de manque de confiance en soi. De ce fait, elle a besoin plus que d'ordinaire de marques tangibles d'affection (si possible verbales!). Toutefois, ?a ne colle pas avec sa remarque, je te l'accorde! A moins qu'elle ne tente par l de se persuader que tout va bien pour elle; et que rien ne cloche. En d'autres termes: peut-tre est-elle mal dans sa peau et ressent-elle le besoin d'entrer en conflit et de se persuader que la douleur mentale qu'elle ressent ne vient pas d'elle mais de sa relation conflictuelle avec toi...    Cela fait-il longtemps que vous tes ensemble et si oui, a-t-elle eu des comportements tranges ces derniers temps ? Ce type de remarque t'est-il familier ?      Il se peut qu'elle soit rellement narcissique et convaincue de sa supriorit et de sa perfection mais dans ce cas un bon conseil : Laisse la tomber; ce type de personne est incapable d'aimer autre qu'elle!    J'espre que tout s'arrangera pour toi! Courage!

Enfin, tu parts avec une bande de potes quand elle est seulement partie avec une copine. Loin de prendre sa dfense, je crois que dans son esprit elle voit plus de danger  te laisser partir car elle s'imagine que rien ne t'empchera de cder  une ventuelle tentation au milieu de tous ces gars, forcment obsds sexuels cela va sans dire.   Elle abuse certes, mais ce n'est peut tre pas compltement volontaire et dans l'ide de te brider, c'est plus une question d'inscurit.|`|9056eb89ce09d256ea1c0501127d846faa	Pour ma part, je vous comprends tous les deux...

SOFTS => plus orientes dtente et bien-tre  Les vacances entre mecs, c'est souvent l'occasion de "pousser le bouchon" plus loin que quand les copines sont l!!!    C'est comprhensible que ta copine s'inquite, mais il faut qu'elle comprenne que ce n'est pas forcment justifi (tout dpend de toi, de tes potes, et de la confiance qu'elle vous accorde!)

LyFJqV5Eaa	Dans le cas d'un divorce en consentement mutuel vous devez tre d'accord sur tous les aspects y compris la garde du ou des enfants. Sans quoi, effectivement il ne peut tre prononc.  Pour les autres types de divorce, je ne pense pas que cela pose de problme pour la procdure et effectivement c'est le juge qui tranchera.   Cependant, ne places pas trop d'espoir dans une issue favorable  ta demande de garde alterne surtout si l'enfant est en bas age. Il semblerait que les demandes aboutissent (sauf cas grave) plus facilement  partir des 11-12 ans de l'enfant.  En plus, je ne veux pas te dcourager mais il semblerait que les magistrats soient de plus en plus oppos  ce genre de pratique..  Ton avocat sera le mieux plac pour te conseill. Sinon, tu peux toujours demand un droit de garde largit.|`|wMwnRESAaa	Pensez  ce qui sera le mieux pour votre enfant en premier lieu.|`|mUyXf0Mcaa	Le JAF va dcider|`|RVr3K5CTaa	Si c'est un divorce par consentement mutuel, soit vous vous mettez d'accord, soit il n'y aura pas de divorce.

Si votre femme ne travaille pas, vous devrez lui payer une prestation compensatoire en sus de sa moiti de la communaut, et de la pension alimentaire pour votre fils, donc ce n'est pas franchement un argument  avancer sauf  vouloir payer encore plus de prestation compensatoire.    Le juge tranchera en fonction du contexte (chaque parent doit habiter proche l'un de l'autre pour que l'enfant reste dans son environnement scolaire et social qu'il soit chez l'un ou chez l'autre, dans le cadre d'une rsidence alterne. Les deux parents doivent aussi avoir un logement correct) et des arguments avancs par chacun.

92n42vksaa	Of course you wouldn't enjoy sex as it reminds you of bad experiences. Please dont feel obliged to do it to please your boyfriend, you shouldn't have to go through this trauma now on top of everything you've already been through. If he doesn't care how you're feeling he isnt worth it anyway.  Maybe if you only have sex when you really want to (it could take a while to get to this point) and with someone who knows about and understands the emotions you feel, someone who really cares about you, you would feel more comfortable and in control. Then hopefully you will start to enjoy it more.|`|3UlGItEEaa	I think you are choosing the wrong men. I was used by a friend when I was younger and he was hoping to get sex out of it, but he didn't so he tried to rape me, but I got away. My experience wasn't nearly as painful as yours and I am sorry you had to experience anything at all.    You are dealing with men that don't make you feel good. Mentally or physically. One was selfish, the other makes you want to cry.    I think you need to take a break. I think you need to stay away from guys for a while and work on healing yourself. You don't need a man to complete yourself spiritually, mentally or physically.    Take as much time as you need to practice forgiving those who hurt you as well as yourself.     Without  being healed from old wounds, sutures tear back open leaving you hurt again, right? This is definitely self-inflicted.     You had a bad expriences and you don't know how to change that cycle. You just keep finding your way to get back into it, right?      When people say "when it feels right, you will know" they are telling the truth. The warning signs are always right in front of you. You need to practice looking for those signs before you bother getting into anything with any guy, especially something physical.     I would suggest that you leave your boyfriend. I understand that relationships are partnerships and its give or take, but if you are not happy at all,  is it worth it? No.    I hope this helps..I know it was quite a rant.|`|om9PLGecaa	sorry to hear this my eyes started tearing up   first i would say tell him what you have just put on hear and if he don't care hes not worth being with (the are descent blokes out there, i would never ignore this if a girlfriend told me) and if he don't help you   then try talking to a doctor or someone knows about emotional things and you can let it all out and it might make you fill a bit better an they will help you move on and have a normal sex life  good luck|`|AA11900069	Sorry for your previous ordeal.  You can either stay like this, or tell yourself that you have the power within you, to put the past behind you, and enjoy the pleasure you can give to each other.   I'm slightly confused, you are open about what you like, but you say you don't like it at all?        If you want to remain as a couple, but don't want to have sex, does the idea of telling him it would be ok to look elsewhere for pleasure appeal to you?  Is that something you could feel comfortable with?  |`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Tell your boyfriend how you feel. I feel the same way sometimes, I too had a bad start with sex. I think that the more your bf agrees to cuddle, perhaps the more you will start to see sex as a positive thing. And if you don't feel like doing it, tell him! Don't be shy. Because when you finally DO have sex, it will be very enjoyable for both of you. Also perhaps you may want to consider seeing a therapist to talk about your feelings... but you may be able to handle it by yourself, if you are continually in touch with your feelings and talking about them with others.|`|syKIxX45aa	Perhaps you need to ask your doctor to refer you to a Professional , who can help you to over come this as it stems from a very bad experience.  You need to rid yourself of these negative feelings , but can only do this with the proper help.|`|01K2QAydaa	if you hate sex then stop having sex. its simple. you do not need to have sex just to please your man.    sex is not everything in life. |`|3kfK7Uaaaa	it takes time and the right partner. i went through something similar to you and after was with an unhelpful bf for 3 years. we stopped sleepin together as the sex was all about him. now im engaged to an understanding guy who i sincerely love and trust. have sex when you feel like it and know it wont hurt. then you will slowly get used to sex about being love and sincerety. but dont do it just to make your partner it wont help u in the long term.|`|eMXIQaQlaa	You need to let go of the past, realize that what happened to you wasn't in any way your fault. Don't be afraid to like sex because of something that happened a long time ago. Why wouldn't he care about how you feel? I'm sure he does. He might not really know what to say. Try to just concentrate on how it feels physically and dont let other thoughts get into your head. Just think about you and him and how it feels. Good luck. |`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	you need to come to terms with what happened to you, im sure if most people had been abused they to would have problems with feeling good about sex so don't be so hard on your self you have to some-how separate what happened to you when you was young, from making love its not the same.  the best place to start is with your Doctor and getting Cancelling  good luck..xx|`|YIwCgWHnaa	I am very sorry to hear about your previous abuse. I have no doubt at all that the abuse against you is entirely responsible for your hatred of sex - this is in no way your fault, and your response to sex, given your circumstances, is entirely normal. I would advise you to see a humanistic psychologist, who will remind you of your self-worth and sexual power. You will come to see that sex isn't just something men do to women - it's something women can do to men as well!|`|As1pBao0aa	Im sorry to hear you had a bad experience, no-one should ever have to go through anything like that. The only thing I can really say to you is that when you find the right guy you will want to have sex with him and you wont feel bad. If he knows how you feel and he still does not care he is not the right man for you. Sex can be a great experience, but only with the right person, if you dont feel comfortable with him then he is not the right person. You need to accept what you have been through and move on, I know it cant be easy but until you do you wont be able to have a healthy sex life. If you really care about this guy, tell him how you feel and if he is worth your time he will understand and be patient. I hope this has helped you, even if it is only in a small way.|`|YhGe9Fqyaa	you are developing phobia, please stop and change your life style.

bK9YS2kpaa	Pues yo creo que no, uno puede amar mucho a una persona pero no necesariamente estar enamorado  Por ejemplo yo amo a mi familia,pero no estoy enamorada de ni uno de ellos, pero si hablamos de una relacion de pareja, lo mas posible es que al mismo tiempo que hay amor puede haber enamoramiento,pero ojooo no es obligacion,enamorarse es un complemento del amar, es como algo que lo refuerza.|`|COj6oH8aaa	noooooo, el que est enamorado no ama, o s, y el que ama a caso est enamorado?.  no querias decir es lo mismo amar que querer, porque eso no es lo mismo, el que ama no mide lo que siente, slo siente y el que quiere piensa lo que quiere, eso es todo|`|421307d63cb2dc0797f57c57cfdec663aa	El estar enamorado es querer a alguien porque te gusta y es el inicio de un verdadero amor, para mi amar es el darse a si mismo sin esperar nada a cambio, es entregarte sin condiciones, es querer que tu pareja no sufra, yo por ejemplo dara un ri?n a mi ser amado si lo necesitara, un rgano si as lo requiriera, y lo mejor que no es nicamente con mi pareja, se lo dara a mis hermanos, padres en fin a un ser que en verdad ames, ya que para amar no necesitas que sea como pareja si no como ser humano.

Pero enamorarce o estar enamorado es un sentimiento que se lo asocia con el amor asi una persona de la cual pretendes recibir amor de pareja, enamorarce pertenece al vinculo de los novios, matrimonios.  Una persona cuando esta enamorada, es capaz de cualquier cosa con tal de lograr recibir amor de la otra persona, en cambio el amar no necesariamente necesita que la otra persona sienta lo mismo, el solo ama sin nada a cambio.

db9AEDecaa	ciao capisco perfettamente la tua situazione io ad ogni occasione particolare penso che mi farebbe piacere ricevere anche solo un messaggino dal mio ex perch io non ho il coraggio di farlo per paura di essere fraintesa perch come dici tu  tutto in buona fede, si tratta di semplice curiosit perch si tratta di una persona con la quale abbiamo condiviso molte cose e che ci rester per sempre nel cuore.  Comunqua a parte tutto secondo me hai fatto bene a non dire niente al tuo ragazzo perch non capirebbe sicuramente come tu ti arrabbieresti se lo facesse lui con una ex, stai per attenta a fare in modo che non possa leggere i messaggi o vedere che ti ha chiamato.    Ciao se ti va fammi sapere come andr domani|`|mRNBGeYTaa	se gi lui ci aveva riprovato con te quando tu stavi con un'altro significa che ancora prova qlc x te e cos rischi solo di dargli false speranze. E poi un'altra cosa come ti sentiresti tu se il tuo ragazzo attuale sentisse una sua ex che ancora  innamorata di lui e non ti dicesse niente???|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Secondo me, da quello che hai scritto(che il tuo ex ci ha provato con te anche se eri gi fidanzata...) dimostra che ancora lui ha una cotta per te(e quindi fa bene il tuo ragazzo a non essere contento se sapesse che vi siete sentiti). Allo stesso tempo non fai bene nei confronti del tuo ex, che magari si illude che tra voi due ci possa essere qualcosa.   Insomma: se il tuo ex ha ben chiaro il fatto che vi sentite "in buona fede" allora se ti va di sentire come st, fai bene; se la situazione con lui non  piu' che chiara, ti conviene evitare.|`|XwPlHlHMaa	magari puoi anche risparmiartela..|`|WI7arlveaa	se sei sicura che a te non ineressi pi allora non farti problemi..basta che dopo,quando la telefonata sar finit,tu non rimanga l a pensare a quello che vi siete detti ecc ecc...sono del parere che a volte al proprio ragazzo non si deve x forza raccontare tutto soprattutto se si  in buona fede come te.........giusto?!pensaci bene cmq ciau :)

HdMDQMRZaa	sono stata due anni con un ragazzo tutto rose e fiori l' unico a cui ho detto ti amo... il mio primo ragazzo con la R maiuscola... poi si punto in bianco non si fa pi sentire, lo chiamo, vado da lui, non risponde... io piango giorno e notte e dopo 2 mesi si presenta con una nuova ragazza ora sono assieme da quasi 3 anni... io non sai  quanto ci sono stata mele.. di tempo prima che trovassi qualcuno ne  passato parecchio circa 1 anno per uscire con qualcun altro... nonostante quello che mi aveva fatto non trovavo qualcuno csi... ora dopo molte prese in giro... sono felice accanto al mio nuovo ragazzo... vedrai tutto si supera... ttt abbiamo il diritto di essere felici|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	io ho aspettato 3 anni prima di rimettermi in gioco, uscivo da una storia tormentata di 6 anni (dai 16 ai 22) e da un anno e mezzo sto con un ragazzo che mi rende felice e mi ama...vedrai che  solo una questione di tempo! in bocca al lupo *cherrypie*|`|RotstnDxaa	si che sei normale...probabilmente devi solo trovare quello giusto che fa per te, e allora ti lascerai andare...abbi pazienza...cmq ti passer...ciao|`|AXLnCr7faa	Dopo che il mio primo, grande amore mi ha rifiutata (ed era due anni che ci ronzavamo intorno, mica noccioline) sono stata tanto male che per due anni interi ho allontanato tutti, non volevo avere a che fare con nessun ragazzo per paura di rimanere di nuovo ferita, poi ho ricominciato a guardarmi intorno, ma non riuscivo a vedere nessuno che mi piacesse veramente (o forse continuavo a vedere lui e solo lui). Solo a distanza di quattro anni sono riuscita a frequentare qualcun altro e solo ora, a distanza di cinque abbondanti, sono riuscita a trovare nuovamente qualcuno che mi piace per davvero e per cui sono disposta a soffrire. L'altro ormai  solo quel ricordo del primo grande amore che non si scorda mai, ma non ha pi alcun tipo di influenza sulle scelte della mia vita  Con il tempo si aggiuster tutto, se non ti piace qualcuno oggi sicuramente lo troverai domani, nulla  irreversibile, men che meno l'interesse per l'altro sesso dopo che si  chiuso un importante capitolo. Devi solo avere la pazienza di attendere che il tempo cicatrizzi quelle ferite che forse neanche ti rendi conto di avere e poi ricominciare da capo ad amare, come e pi di prima. Il trucco  solo non fossilizzarsi e rialzarsi anche se si  caduti e la ferita ci fa male|`|wLAROPTiaa	Anche io dopo un bellissima storia lunga ci siamo lasciati per incompatibilit, ma dopo di lui non riesco nemmeno a trovare un ragazzo, che voglia stare con me, insomma non sono pi riuscita a baciare nemmeno un ragazzo sembra strano ma non so cosa fare. Comunque penso che sia normale.

48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	For me it's always something different.  I get turned on when I see a girl who's not afraid to be herself.  She has confidence, but she doesn't have to let everyone know how good she feels about herself.  She has her own style and she's not afraid to approach a guy who she thinks is attractive.  A nice smile is always a good start and then depending on what we talk about determines if I will get turned on or not.  Just be yourself and you'll enjoy the fun of meeting lots of people and then you can pick the one that seems attracted to you.|`|Pm2AEMsDaa	turn off- a sad girl that expects everyone to feel sorry for her, or one that is really hyper and won't shut up    turn on- good smile... very talkable.. nice eyes... not too much makeup|`|cO7ytCzyaa	big boobs and lil outfits turns on turns offs sweaty arm pits
dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Your daughter's pregnancy is NOT causing trouble in your marriage.  Your HUSBAND is causing trouble in your marriage.    He has been raising her since she was 3.  He is partly responsible for any lessons she has or hasn't learned.    I would suggest to you that he is insecure and jealous that she will get your attention, and is lashing out at you with name calling.  And how on earth would grounding her make a difference?  What she needs now is loving supportive parents.  If he's not willing to do that, perhaps he shouldn't be a parent anymore.    Is this really how a man who loves you and the children acts?|`|wKzH60Xlaa	Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about it now, the "damage" has been done.      It IS a big blow at first. Allow him to calm down and hopefully once the dust settles, you both can think clearly.  More than ever, your daughter needs your support.      With a premature pregnancy like this, you can bet it'll put things out of whack.  It affects everyone.  Just remember this baby is a gift, every baby is a gift.  This is life growing in her so your journey through life is now taking a different course.  Pray for guidance and wisdom in the months ahead.  It won't be easy but the strength you'll need will be there. Good luck!|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	She is your biological daughter not his, you do what you think is right for her|`|B7fQ6dUtaa	Do what ur heart says|`|AA10986891	I think he is overwhelmed about everyhting that is going on and he is taking all this very immaturely. He is afraid of the role he will play with your grandson/daughter if he will be seen as the grandfather or just grandmas husband. He is also afraid that since she is only 15 and your son in law a minor too, he will have to support the baby economicly and with this hard times. He probably feels a little left out too, that maybe if he had a more active role in your daughters life things would be different and he probably wants to be part of all of this but does not want to just come out and say it.    Have a really deep conversation with him about it and then make a decision.    Kudos to you for supporting your daughter that most mean a lot to her right now.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Actually I know for a fact that your younger children may suffer for the fact she is pregnant. One the children will send the information down the gossip line and it will stick with them when they get to that age. Not to mention that some of the parents of the may not want their children around a unstable environment or teen pregnancy. They may feel that is telling their children its ok to have sex before marriage and get pregnant. You have to look at it from there point of view. They will be effected by it weather its now or later.    Also you will be more safe or strict on your younger children when they get to about that age. So yes that will cause a effect on your younger children. Also you will be having to pay more attention to your oldest daughter who is pregnant more then the younger ones.     He is probably upset cause this went on under his nose and that you guys didnt think about birth control. He is upset with the thought of people saying he is a bad parent due to the fact that your daughter got pregnant while in the care of the two of you. You have to understand people react differently. He will get over it and yes it is going to cause some fights but that is normal.     As a teen mother I would think it would have been in the right for my mother to punish me for what I did. She should have grounded me and then give her as much information about the options. At the same time I think she should get a part time job, yes while she is still pregnant, to teach her it wont be easy. There are things she will have to face now due to the poor actions she made in the past. Nothing you can do about it now. She should have to put together a budget as to how she is going to take care of the child if she wants to keep the baby. That way she will know what is in the future and you shouldnt make it easy for her. Dont treat her special. Which means making sure you dont start treating the baby like it will be yours. This means you dont buy all the diapers, clothes, car seats, or anything else for that matter. You can give her gifts like a crib or something for the baby shower but that should be that.|`|hyerONTPaa	i wont be with anyone who talked about my kids like that! divorce him and deal with it on your own!! enjoy your soon to be grandbaby!!    i had a baby at 17|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I don't blame him for not wanting to play daddy to another child.  It's not like your daughter is going to be supporting the child.  I'm sure I'll get a ton of thumbs down...but in cases like this - I totally believe in abortion.

l1VZTF1Haa	My mans member is 5 inches.  He likes me to wear high heels in bed.  Cannot ejaculate unless I slap him.    Is that enough for you?    EDIT: Happy: Yep, well maybe not the slapping but it comes out a lot quicker if I do, oh and biting his ear lobe turns him into a maniac.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I used to discuss things like that with my friends but got to the point I didn't want to hear about the intimate details of someone else's sex life. I fell like some of them were probably lying to make themselves appear to be some sex goddess. I guess it has gotten a lot more private for me.|`|RHux2Fmnaa	I personally don't really like to talk about our sex life. I just think it's something very personal and should be kept private. But, I know my husband has made a few comments about it with some of his closest friends and I -definitely- don't like it at all. Most of my friends  -when we get together-  talk about their sex life; some go too far, but most just make innocent comments, like your wife said. Yes, I think it is a double standard, because if I don't want my husband to mention anything about what we do in bed -to any of his friends- then, I shouldn't do it either. |`|qnxAN2t5aa	i think you brought up a really good point by saying you don't bring it up because you don't want your friends thinking sexually about your wife. women don't do that so much when their friends tell them stories, my friends will share details but i don't ever look at their husbands sexually! that could be the entire reason for the double standard. |`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	People are like that though. I once knew a bloke who thought it was okay to two time his girlfriend but the other way around he was totally against it. Nobody turns the tables round to even try to understand what the feeling is like.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	We both do it and it's fine with the two of us.|`|nnXBlLjTaa	Women must talk to their friends, it is our duty as friends. It is totally different then when men talk about it to other men. Men are only in it to hear every nasty detail. women talk about the better sides of the act.  My husband and I go through this all the time too. I do talk to my friends about how good it is and the things I love him doing to me. When he talks to his friends; it doesn't matter who all is around. If are all together at a get together say like at my brothers house; we are all gathered on the back porch-He has to put our sex life out there as a joke as to say that he never gets any and how quick it is when he does get it;(which is all not truths) he is only after the laughs.  I hate that!!!     So anyway; in answer to your question, it is very different. Don't worry about it and let it go. We women just have nice quiet conversations about it because it is. We are not comparing you or talking bad about it etc.    good luck|`|0b04c7a0c2d6347def6134f6598d75d4aa	They usually do.|`|3685fdeae86a81346f3b588f28ed00feaa	Have you not seen Sex And The City?    This is a totally common occurance!! You are massively over-reacting and probably owe your wife an apology!|`|EW1RBhnwaa	most girls do, not a big deal!! |`|M1pH4zi9aa	Did you see the question posted about you last week?  Once again, you are rambling on.  I know now that I am not the only one to feel this way.  I really can't be @rsed to read your question but yes, women do discuss their sex lives with friends.  Get over it|`|K8C14P7Caa	Wouldn't that create a potential interest in you by one of her girlfriends? I think there is some risk in talking about your man to another woman...who may be looking for someone exactly like you?  I don't know what women discuss in private...but I would think it would be dangerous...just a thought|`|WiycCxpzaa	I am going to be honest here.    What my husband says to his buddies are between them and them alone. what is said to my girl friends are between us. I have respect for my husband to not degrade him or talk nasty about him, but I do have conversations about sex in general and I do use our sex life as examples. Do I tell them every detail of it? Of course not, there are things between a husband and wife that don't need to be shared. That includes our most intimate moments.    It should go both ways, as a husband or wife, if you don't want your spouse saying certain things then you shouldn't either. It's a matter of respect more than anything. I respect and love my husband and I know certain moments we share in the bedroom are personal.     But to talk in general about sex toys or positions or things of that nature I don't see a big deal. Would my husband rather me use us as an example or my ex's? I would much rather him use me as an example than an ex.    If your wife does not want you discussing it, then she shouldn't either. It goes both ways. Women can talk just as nasty and sleazy as any man can, trust me. It's not just "innocent girly talk".|`|QJslTCUBaa	Sorry, but I don't agree with the posters saying it's ok to discuss your sex life with her friends. You are giving sexual information about your husband to another woman, who if she wanted to could use it to get to him sexually. Don't laugh, it has happened to many women. Don't be a fool..keep your mouth shut. :-)|`|3fOFbz5Taa	My wife speaks to her pals about our sex life, that,s how we got into swinging and 3somes !!!!  It,s good for them to speak to their pals about it !!!!|`|SsCMH480aa	we all do it|`|AA11827424	Women talk. Men talk. Like it or not, it happens. Deal with it.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Yes im afraid women do discuss like you mentioned above but after reading you saying "how would you like it if I discussed you with the lads"  I dont think I would like it.  Your right double standards.  But we do do it for sure.  |`|49516892a30256a05c73d42ba16ec24eaa	Yep, I talk about my sex life, but since my husband rocks it's all complimentary. |`|AvhJoL5baa	I wouldn't give a crap as long as it was "discussing" and not "complaining" about our sex life.      Tiffany: LOL!  Are you serious???|`|wU21ABkYaa	yeh its double standards, but i speak to my friends about it and she probably does the same. i don't really care what they talk about. its quite normal for both to talk about it i think|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	It's different. Because:   Her friends can listen without picturing it. ~ Your friend will picture it, and maybe even picture her doing it with them.   Her friends take it as something she likes to do in the bedroom...the end ~ You friends take it as woah shes well up for it, she will do anything.   Her friends will see you no differently, they don't really care what you do in bed ~ Your friends will look at her completely differently knowing what she likes/doesn't.      Those saying your friend could use th einformation to get your husband, if my husband was going to wander I'd be glad it was because of me. I trust my partner enough to know that even if my friends tried anything with him, he wouldnt do it.|`|HcnMtJJ6aa	I'm only 18 so you might not listen to me but girls always talk about their boyfriends or husbands. It's just a girl thing. You shouldn't take it in offense or anything. Sometimes they might just need advice from a girl cause we think a like, you know? If she talks about only good things then you shouldn't have anything to worry about. I wouldn't talk to your friends just in spit of her talking to hers cause that might upset her. All girls just need a good girl chat about anything. I know I talk to my friends about me and my boyfriend. I go to them with worst and the best. If you really want your wife to keep her your sex life just between her and you maybe you should come at her in a matter that is respectful ( not saying you didn't or won't ) just tell her you don't feel comfortable with it or whatever. Just like she didn't seem comfortable with you talking to your friends.|`|TFV8RLiQaa	They all do- it is the most interesting aspect of female feminine dames. So become the talk of the town and enjoy it.|`|IbYyBzroaa	i talk to my best friend about my sex life and she does the same with me. i did nt really think anything of it untill i read ur comment, i think i would be annoyed if i found out my husband was talking to his mates about our sex life. i guess its just the way men and women are, it is double standards, but its like if a man sleeps around hes a stud, if a woman does it shes a tart. its the world we live in. women need to talk about things, we think, worry more than men. |`|b9Cw25WVaa	I'm honestly one of those women that doesn't like putting my business out there and my guy's penis and whatever he does with it is my business. I don't brag, I don't tell people what we do and neither does he. The most that I mention is that my guy has a foot fetish, but I never go into details about what turns him on about feet or what I do for him. I don't want people to know what we do, how we do and when we do. That's our own personal business. Not to say I don't get into conversations about sex in general, but it's never directed to what my guy and I do or did the night before or any of that and he feels the same way. Intimacy is one of the things that you don't share with other people and only with who you're with, so I like to keep that just to us. ;]|`|AomOynajaa	my boyfriend does not discuss our sex life with anyone beyond "she's the best i've ever had" because he's a very private person and doesn't want his friends picturing the intimate details of our love life when they met me or later when we began to hang out.  i understand where he's coming from and i used to give my best friends the low down dirty tell all details of every sexual encounter i had but because this man means the world to me and i plan on marrying him as well as the fact that i respect his want for privacy i edit myself. he knows that i need to work my things out aloud and with my friends but out of respect for him i try not to give away too much detail and only talk about the necessary points...i also have the added benefit of my two best friends living in california and new york while i live in madrid...  so i don't think you're over reacting but maybe you owe her an apology...and she owes you one...both of you for hurting the other's feelings...this will lay good ground for you two to have a level discussion about your comfort levels and the "fairness" of the double standard and that she knows that you would never discuss your sex life and she needs to respect your want for privacy. explain to her that you don't want her to stop but that maybe she could limit the details for your comfort...  hope that helps|`|e1658dd6f8cadd2baaecc6d6db216dfdaa	My wife and freinds talk about it all the time.  She will usually tell me what they talked about with out giving names.  Can be interesting trying to figure out which freind does what.  I have discussed with buddies before, but I find that most of them just make it seem better then it really is.  |`|IliSEc0uaa	I can't understand how women can feel it's OK to share intimate, private experiences with anyone they feel like. They're not just your secrets to give away - they're someone else's secrets too.     I think it's really cheap behaviour. And if women do it they sure as hell can't complain if their other halves do it to!     This 'it's different for women' attitude is total BS. It's not different at all. What couples get up to in bed should be private between them, unless you both agree otherwise.

bzfXbM4raa	Hey, I am going to give a proper answer for this, I just have to step out for a minute.    Edit:  Lol, I actually did have to step out for a minute.  I guess some people gave me thumbs down, not realizing I was serious.    Okay, first of all the perfect girlfriend is different for everyone.  I'll tell you what I think my perfect girlfriend is.      She would have to be attractive.  She doesn't have to be a model, but someone I am attracted to.  She doesn't have to be perfect appearance wise, she doesn't need huge breast (I actually prefer smaller breasts), or have a small bum, although I do like that.    What's most important is that the girlfriend understands me.  Who isn't selfish with her time.  I am not asking to be with her 24/7.  But I do need her sometimes, and I can't think of the number of gf who never had the time.  I can't help but think that it's because the gfs were high maintenance.       She has to be smart.  Even if she was smarter than me, that would be great (although alot of guys hate this), it would be great if she kept up with current events.      In the end, it's all about being comfortable with someone.  If I can sit with her at a cafe for 10 minutes without talking, and none of us even notices the silence, then it's perfect.

d7cDzMgfaa	I would definitely call him first.  You really need to find out how he feels first, otherwise you cut off your escape route if things don't work out.  My future husband didn't want me to emigrate for him (slightly different, but similar), only for myself, so if you're moving back, make sure it's what you want to do for yourself, independent of whether he's in the picture or not.    In other words, you need to make sure you're going to be fine, whether your ex comes back to you or not.  That will put that much less pressure on your possible relationship, because you want to avoid all pressure possible.    You need to come up with a script of what you want to say to him, and write it down before you call him.  Have a really good think, but you've already put some good points down in what you've written here.  You will need to tell him exactly how you want things to change and go on from here.      You need to be very careful though that you definitely want all of this before you ask for it, as there's no going back afterwards.  Be aware too that as you left him, he may be angry that you want everything on your terms again.  He may have new girlfriend too.  Basically you have to take it as it comes, and see what's actually available to you, what he's prepared to give you. At the very least, you could ask him to think about it and let you know how he feels later.  He may not be able to give you an answer straight away as it might be the last thing he's expecting, and he may have to think hard about what he wants - to be with you or not.    I realise it's scary, but prepare yourself - even run through the conversation in your mind - and give him a call.  You may be pleasantly surprised.  But if he doesn't want you, yes it'll hurt but it will be worth it in the long run because it will just mean that you're destined to be with another.    Best of luck :-)|`|AA11900069	Yes, don't move back just for him...  and is there a mutual friend who knows what is going on in his life?  Maybe in five months, he had found someone?  Ask around, see if he is still available.|`|41d9bbe883651498cfddaa868b122362aa	don't really have advice but i hope your only motive for moving back is for him, that is definitely a mistake

eiDjLEuJaa	maybe he is feeling like HE has been used?  if she saw him in the cafeteria the next day and didn't go to talk to him, he might think that she was ignoring him!      he's texting her back, so i would guess that they are both just feeling a bit shy and embarrassed about the whole thing.  why doesn't she call him instead of just texting, see how he responds to that?  it would be a shame for something to fizzle out because they are both just too shy to make the next move...|`|35163a8ea0e9bf443bd176516a68af50aa	Well, you never know, he might have, but you don't really know this guy, do you?

She appears to have willingly went to his place and slept with him. There's no crime for that.    Not only is he's afraid to speak to her upfront, so is she. She isn't exactly innocent here. Instead of speaking to him in the cafeteria, she kept quiet.    If she really wants to say something, she shouldn't wait on him to speak up. She needs to make the move and go talk to him.

V2VhS6Oaaa	Espero te guste, esta muy bonita, Saludos.    EL AMOR VERDADERO  Papi... ?Cunto me amas?     El da que mi Hija naci, en verdad no sent gran alegra. Por que la decepcin que senta pareca, ser ms grande que el gran acontecimiento que representa tener una hija.   ?Yo quera un varn!  A los dos das de haber nacido, fui a buscar a mis dos mujeres, una luca plida y agotada y la otra radiante y dormilona.  En pocos meses me dej cautivar por la sonrisita de mi Carmencita y por la infinita inocencia de su mirada fija y penetrante, fue entonces cuando empec a amarla con locura, su carita, su sonrisita y su mirada no se apartaban ni por un instante de mis pensamientos, todo se lo quera comprar, la miraba en cada ni?o o ni?a, haca planes sobre planes, todo sera para mi Carmencita.  Este relato era contado a menudo por Rodolfo, el padre de Carmencita y yo tambin senta gran afecto por la ni?a que era la razn ms grande para vivir de Rodolfo segn deca el mismo.    Una tarde estaba mi familia y la de Rodolfo, haciendo un picnic a la orilla de un ro cerca de casa y la ni?a entabl una conversacin con su pap, todos escuchbamos:    Papi,... cundo cumpla quince a?os, ?cul ser mi regalo?  Pero mi amor, si apenas tienes diez a?itos, ?No te parece que falta mucho para esa fecha?  Bueno papito,... tu siempre dices que el tiempo pasa volando, aunque yo nunca lo he visto por aqu.   La conversacin se extenda y todos participamos de ella, al caer el sol regresamos a nuestras casas.     Una ma?ana me encontr con Rodolfo enfrente del colegio donde estudiaba Carmencita quien ya tena catorce a?os. Rodolfo se vea muy contento y la sonrisa no se apartaba de su rostro.   Con gran orgullo me mostraba las calificaciones de Carmencita, eran notas impresionantes, ninguna bajaba de diez puntos y los estmulos que les haban escrito sus profesores eran realmente conmovedores. Felicit al dichoso pap. Carmencita ocupaba toda la alegra de la casa, en la mente y en el corazn de la familia, especialmente en el de su pap.  Fue un Domingo muy temprano cuando nos dirigamos a misa, cuando Carmencita tropez con algo, eso creamos todos y dio un traspi, su pap la agarr de inmediato para que no cayera...Ya instalados en la iglesia, vimos como Carmencita fue cayendo lentamente sobre el banco y casi perdi el conocimiento.  La tomamos en brazos, mientras su pap buscaba un taxi hacia el hospital.   All permaneci por diez das y fue entonces cuando le informaron que su hija padeca una grave enfermedad que afectaba seriamente su corazn, pero no era algo definitivo, qu deba practicarle otras pruebas para llegar a un diagnstico firme.  Los das iban pasando, Rodolfo renunci a su trabajo para dedicarse al cuidado de Carmencita, su madre quera hacerlo pero decidieron que ella trabajara, pues sus ingresos eran superiores a los de l.    Una ma?ana Rodolfo se encontraba al lado de su hija, cuando ella le pregunt:   ?Voy a morir, no es cierto? ?Te lo dijeron los doctores?   No mi amor...no vas a morir, Dios que es tan grande, no permitira que pierda lo que ms he amado sobre este mundo   respondi el padre.   -?Van a algn lugar?   ?Pueden ver desde lo alto a su familia?   ?Sabes si pueden volver?           preguntaba su Hija.  Bueno hija,... en verdad nadie ha regresado de all a contar algo sobre eso, pero si yo muriera, no te dejara sola, estando en el mas all buscara la manera de comunicarme contigo, en ltima instancia utilizara el viento para venir a verte.  ?Al viento? ?Y cmo lo haras?   No tengo la menor idea hijita, solo s que si algn da muero, sentirs que estoy contigo, cuando un suave viento roce tu cara y una brisa fresca bese tus mejillas.  Ese mismo da por la tarde, llamaron a Rodolfo, el asunto era grave, su hija estaba muriendo. Necesitaban un corazn, pues el de ella no resistira sino unos quince o veinte das ms.   ?UN CORAZN!   ?Dnde hallar un corazn?   ?Un corazn!   -?Dnde Dios mo?  Ese mismo mes, Carmencita cumplira sus quince a?os. Y fue el viernes por la tarde cuando consiguieron un donante, una esperanza ilumin los ojos de todos, las cosas iban a cambiar.  El Domingo por la tarde ya Carmencita estaba operada, todo sali como los mdicos lo haban planeado. ?xito total!   Sin embargo, Rodolfo todava no haba vuelto por el hospital y Carmencita lo extra?aba muchsimo, su mam le deca que ya todo estaba muy bien y que su papito sera el que trabajara para sostener la familia.  Carmencita permaneci en el hospital por quince das ms, los mdicos no haban querido dejarla ir hasta que su corazn estuviera firme y fuerte y as lo hicieron.  Al llegar a casa todos se sentaron en un enorme sof y su mam con los ojos llenos de lgrimas le entreg una carta de su padre.  "Carmencita, hijita de mi corazn: Al momento de leer mi carta, ya debes tener quince a?os y un corazn fuerte latiendo en tu pecho, esa fue la promesa que me hicieron los mdicos que te operaron. No puedes imaginarte ni remotamente cuanto lamento no estar a tu lado en este instante.   Cuando supe que ibas a morir, decid dar respuesta a una pregunta que me hiciste cuando tenas diez a?itos y a la cual no respond.

fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	Personally, a girl's weight is not a big deal with me. So long as she feels good about herself then I am happy for her. The thing that I find important is her personality. Can we have great talks? Can we go on long walks? There's more to beauty than just what is outside. For a long term relationship, it is what is inside. Be who you want to be and the guys who are worthy of having you will like you as you are. If they want you to be a model and really skinny, then they don't deserve you. Good luck.|`|ZexapZfYaa	if its in yr bral no|`|4f55d2ff9515ab32bf18556229a3228eaa	Sounds a bit heavy.

Be honest with yourself, do you look like a linebacker?   There is a guy for every girl of every shape out there and vice versa.  A happy, bubbly, go getter type of personality will hide any heaviness you may be feeling and will be more attractive to others of the opposite sex.

These days with long hair and short hair on everybody and unisex clothing it is getting harder to tell by those items.  (Plus some guys look like girls in facial features - and vice versa)  Then hair and face and body shape.

TmzB9f9kaa	Bottom line: Absolutely NOT.    Why?    Alcohol impairs judgement. Yeah, we all like to feel a little buzzed, but there is no refuting the scientific proof that alcohol impairs judgement, especially when you have a lot of it.    Maybe he only asked you because you were drunk, and if you'd answered, your level of drunkeness could have affected your answer.    Now looking at it from his point of view... he may feel hurt or rejected because you didn't say yes. Which brings us to the next point.    The real issue here is the question. He has an "out", now, because you were both drunk. But if he doesn't take that out, then he really does want to marry you and you should answer him.    Don't make the scenario during which the question was asked become the focal point here. If he really did just ask because he was drunk, then try to get him to drop it. Just explain that you were drunk and didn't know what you were saying and didn't feel comfortable talking about something like that when you were drunk.     If he loves you he will understand and let go of it eventually. All you need to do is offer reassurance that you're not rejecting him.    And if you love him, and his proposal still stands, and you decide that you do want to marry him, then SAY YES!!! (and congratulations if you do!)    If his offer stands and you say yes but he still won't let this thing go, tell him something like "I didn't want to say yes and risk not remembering everything the next day", etc. etc.|`|7023e882f4672b54a908f90bb345d015aa	no, you were absolutly right in saying that. hes just mad because you didnt accept right then and there.|`|1ae169d5afb570e364ee51963f52e1d9aa	No. You two were drunk. Stuff like that shouldn't be done when you're buzzed.|`|11d6f79de536b3c6e92254f3330f905baa	Not one bit.|`|a3e24ccce628e9c2c4acbe6866d298baaa	No you werent a 'marry me' kinda thing should be romantic not while your drunk and might not remember it in the morning while the sun, nose and everything is bugging you from your hang over.|`|AdAhN4fkaa	Absolutely right. You are more matured in this. Try to explain the situation u were in (he also knows that). Better tell him taking decision on somethin serious will be dangerous during that time.|`|f31c1a6beb14eb8d5cbe57ba3c3b8f21aa	they say the truth comes out when you're drunk... so he deffinitely wants to marry you... but it doesn't seem like a real proposal... tell him you'd like an 'official' proposal... drop a hint or two...|`|zaq4EMUeaa	They say that when you're drunk you reveal your deepest most darkest true feelings, maybe you're not ready for marriage yet.  Also, no I don't think u were wrong because a proposal should be a memorable experience and something you can look back on.  Can you really see yourself making a lifelong commitment to this guy, its only been 7 months!He can always ask you again when your not drunk!no problemo! xxx|`|f3e53972f4f189d59710852d66c87365aa	No you are absolutely right with what you did. It almost doesnt seem sincere when they ask you drunk. That is a memorable moment in a womans life. And wouldnt you rather be sober for it....

That is how a succeeful marriage is build on. Love is like a rose , first it blooms then it grows. No one fells out from love , they fell out of commitment. Commitment has cost but it is worth it at the end. Anyone wants to pay the cost will be blessed in their ordained marriage. Got to give up something , to gain something.

Personally, I am an idealist and a romantic. For me, love is the bond between two people whose hearts went put together form one. If I were to love a girl, then seeing her smile would make me happy the whole day. Hearing her laugh would make my worries go away. Love would help us through any problem. It's a mutual feeling where people are there for each other through anything that goes wrong and being complete. I hope if you haven't found your definition of love yet, that you are able to find the missing part of you.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	when divorce comes it is hard even if the marriage was tough, we still are loosing someone we loved. divorce doesn't stop someone from loving the person. divorce is the end of the dreams and life we had with that person, it is always sad, especially if we weren't the ones wanting it. there is always a little tinge of regret there, because people hate giving up on things. even when the marriage was bad, there had to be some good times too. she is feeling some grief, wondering if the right choice was made, wondering about her future, and what it holds for her. if she cheated on him she may be feeling some guilt, and remorse over it. she really appears to be sad and not really happy about it.|`|86a96d3da3b8c998b43c7d6cf6ac39c8aa	like she has failed in life and love!|`|qEWTk2Yraa	maybe she just cant believe its happening|`|a7cd4d5babdaca8813b9a8973f4e9e8eaa	some mixed emotions maybe, talk to her|`|96f2cee0d770b3768c2a1686a820dc21aa	she is in disbelief and emotionally drained.

9449d08699c2a8aefe17779bbabfdc7eaa	Selon moi, la femme-enfant est une femme qui a les responsabilits d'une adulte, les choix d'une adulte et tout un tas d'aptitudes que l'on a en grandissant, avec l'age : prvoyance, ducation, gestion, sduction...    Mais  la diffrence des autres femmes, la femme-enfant garde ses rves de petite fille et ses dlires aussi. Elle manque de lucidit et reste souvent na?ve. Elle s'accroche  ses impulsions, ses dsirs et ses humeurs.  Elle sait trs bien s'amuser et parfois mme  des jeux qui ne sont plus de son age...

Separation is when two people seek separate residences for a while even though, THEY ARE STILL MARRIED.  If they want to see other people, then they need to be divorced.  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/s...|`|Ngxxic6zaa	In the simplest of terms, separation mmeans    You here...  Him there....    Separation means time apart..time to contemplate wether the relationship is worth saving....or not.    It means the beginning of thinking what's mine is mine...and what's her's is her's.    It means you live apart and start seeing the world once again as a singular...no longer a plural.  Not matter what the intention, this seems to be an automatic response.     It means weighing the odds of going back with him or moving on.    Lastly, it means one of two things:   it can represent a physical and emotional return to the marriage or relationship with the vow that both will try to fix all of it's wrongs.    OR....    The complete dissolution of the relationship.|`|115RWsDWaa	Not together, apart, separate.|`|a7cd4d5babdaca8813b9a8973f4e9e8eaa	Depressed, lonely, scared....  that's just my experience|`|AA11118745	Separation in a marriage means when two people can't get along and they "SEPARATE" to work things out. They may never get back together but some couples do this just to see how and if they could live without that person. Sometimes kids are involved and that is hard. Some people don't believe in divorce so they do the separation thing.|`|7HKKbdZtaa	Depends if you want the legal definition or common.  Legal separation is when one or both parties decide the marriage is over.  This event starts a clock ticking.  If the decision is wishy washy the clock keeps starting over.  Many take a break from each other without the intent to end the marriage.  This is not legal separation, just a time out.      http://www.predator-awareness.com/|`|fqInpJiqaa	Running in oppossite directions to avoid responsibilities.

5d4086bf6180dad4ada0540f4f0142d8aa	Sometimes the answer is right in front of our face but we continue to look for the answer we want. He was honest with you that he likes you as well as someone else. Now its up to you whether you can handle knowing that you're not his one and only. Either in his heart or in his life period (if he visits her or something). I know plenty of females who can handle doing the non-exclusive thing. I'm not one of them, so you have to judge the situation and know your tolerance level. Based upon the end of your posts, I don't think you can handle. You think like me, and you weren't happy that he called the girl after leaving you. Unfortunately when you aren't exclusive, thats what happens. Maybe you should cut off that relationship and find someone who is interested in only you. It would definitely cut down on some confusion. Hope I didn't ramble too much, and was actually some help. Best of luck to you.|`|8XQLhqBOaa	dont play second best. you are first and thats that.
b13fbab4183f4877a35b22225b3e395aaa	How about U plan an extra special date nite. First go rent some dvd's, maybe buy a new teddy, some scented candles, etc.  Cheese and crackers, strawberries and champagne candlelight, sexy lingerie, massage oil and throw the porn in the dvd player.  My guess is once he sees how much more fun it is sharing his porn w/ you, he'll never want to sneak again.  Good Luck!!|`|8e28ad49d99988787c3b86c641d381b6aa	You make it sound like watching porn is unusual, he is a man after all..It probably makes him more interested in you, and no less....|`|AA10673237	Openly discuss porn with him.  Tell him how you feel about it, that you don't mind his watching it, and that you would even like it if he were to include you, so you can watch it together.  Present all this is a playful, sensual way that turns him on, and you'll see how quickly he changes his tune.|`|AA12213012	ur bf is perfectly normal....maybe he is hiding it from u ....coz he doesnt wannt u 2 get upset ...    coz gurls dont like their Bfs watch porn..!!!    anyway good luck with him....|`|lkVGJ3oZaa	The mere fact that he is hiding it is extremely suspicious! I had an ex who hid what he was doing from me, he would refuse to let me see what he was looking at and he too put on passwords. There is definitely something going on, there is something or someone he does not want you to see.  I can't believe that you can say you don't care that he looks at porn because you should! He is very badly disrespecting you. And no not everyone is doing it, my current boyfriend doesn't!    By the sounds of it he isn't having sex with you much is he? That is another bad sign that something is up, my ex almost completely withdrew from me he spent more and more time locked away on the computer, he would hardly talk to me   and almost never had sex with me. He was almost never home too. If that sounds like your boyfriend then pack your bags and run! And keep on running to the doctor to be tested for STDS.  These are very serious I"M CHEATING signs. Let me tell you a friend of mine helped me hack into my ex's locked files and Oh my god! We were stunned! We found files of people he was having affairs with on and off the computer as well as sleazy web cam connections so he could watch other people and them watch him plus tons of gay and child porn! I cried and cried then I came to my senses I kicked his a** to the curb! Please be soo careful and confront him, don't let this continue! And please don't come down on yourself, you deserve no blame for anything, you have done nothing wrong. It does not matter what you look like, once a guy gets into this perversion  you could look like a supermodel and it would not matter.  You deserve so much more than this honey he is far from worth it MOVE ON!!!!|`|5d4086bf6180dad4ada0540f4f0142d8aa	You should talk to him about it. If he's doing it in secret, then maybe he has a problem. Let him know that you want to be included and if he continues to do it in secret then you should suggest that he get some help. People do have sex/porn addictions. Its not the worst thing to deal with. I hope everything works out for the two of you.|`|YAlJgLpKaa	maybe he is just scared to amit it to you. so just come to him with tell him you want a part in it. why would he want to do it by his self any way. i think you should just talk to him. so go for it make yall sex life better it might be some excitement yall been looking for.|`|7ur1vrg0aa	your wrong..not everyone watches porn. If you dont care about him looking at it then tell him and ask him if you can join. What is this world coming to? Why is he having to look anyways why dont you just spice it up a bit and give him a strip tease...at least it would be real and with you.|`|74n6pN7Baa	he shouldnt be watchin porn. i wouldnt want my bf watching porn and he shouldnt of tried to hide it. he needs to be honest.|`|TukmIcfhaa	he wants to make love with u|`|XZdZXVK3aa	Ok your boyfriend needs help. The more he watches porn the more he's gonna expect girls to look like that. He's going to want a girl like just like the ones in the porn. The girls in the porn don't even look like themselves in real life. There are computerized to look perfect. No bodys perfect and the more he watches that stuff the more he's going to expect you to look like them.
3f39f2293c6fd58923de137f7da985fdaa	The man lied to you. But unless he is getting a divorce/anullment and it's well under way, then I think you should give him a second chance.|`|AA11388175	you arent married  turn him in- he's a Bigamist|`|jp2EipFvaa	Sounds like you 2 moved WAAAAAY to fast. Getting pregnant 2 months after meeting him and getting married 9months later? I do think you need to give the relationship a second chance b/c you have already moved to the part of having children and its only fair to the  child and him to try to make things work. How selfish!|`|fhB3Lua3aa	Well, how did you find out about his being married?  If he is not telling you the truth, you may need to break it off with him.  Maybe not permanently, but at least until he can finalize the divorce with his wife and stop keeping lies from you.  I understand that you love him.  But, he won't respect you unless you ask him to.  He doesn't know what you need honey.  I mean, he doesn't even seem to know what he needs.  Come on, he's stuck in two relationships...sounds like he doesn't know what he wants.  Or at least, how to get what he wants.  He is walking all over you, you can't allow it!   Because it will hurt your relationship even further in the end.  You have to be confident and let him go so that he can work things out and come back to you with the commitment that you deserve.  He has to make a choice about which woman he is going to be with!  He may love you and maybe he is not trying to hurt you or use you.  But, regardless, that is what is happening.  You need to push him to be a better man...to respect you...and to respect his wife and five children!  I can only imagine what his kids are going through!  And does his wife know about you?  Has he told her?  Will her tell her?  If he is planning to make a life with you, he is going to have to let her go and tell her that he no longer wants to be married.  I have to tell you though, that I feel pretty sorry for you, because he is not being very considerate of you or his wife.  It sounds to me like he may need some counseling or to speak to a religious advisor.  Does he go to a church?  Maybe he can speak to a pastor about it?  If he wanted to leave his wife he would've left her though...if he wanted you, he would've left her.  Don't let him get away with saying that he doesn't want to hurt thier kids, because let me tell you from experience...it will hurt worse for them to see their parents living in this half-assed state.  Plus, don't you think that they would like to know that they have a half sibling out there?  What he's doing is not right!  I'm not telling you to leave him, if you really love him.  But, you have to draw a line somewhere.  You have to tell him to choose which woman he wants to spend his life with.  And if it's not you, you have to be understanding and let him go!  Good luck to you and God Bless!  I will say a special prayer for you both tonight!  I hope this advice helps you!|`|AA12149458	Turn him into police and then take him to court for emotional pain and suffering and the most child support anyone has ever gotten out of a man for one child.

Moving in with you're boyfriend and his parents is not the path you need to take. That is just a way out for you and not at all a wise decision on you're part.    If you are grown up enough to write this in this site you should be grown up enough to talk to you're mother and let her know what is coming from you;re heart, think about what you say before you say it and be compassionate about it.    Before you decide to get a job and move in with you're boyfriend and his family you need to consider what you want to do for you. That boyfriend may not always be there and he may not support you like you need to be supported. Limiting yourself in that field is a shame and you should consider that.    Stay home and work things out there, if you don't you will spend a lifetime running away from things because you can't fix them.|`|ef900587f42a3006a5209f45881cb638aa	That is alot of responsibility for a 17 y/o.  however I am not sure if moving in with your boyfriends parents would be better for you.  It has only been three months and at your age things change.  I would hate to see you move in with your boyfriends family and if things did not work out you would have to ask your mom to move back in.  I am a little confused at the fact that your mom is counting the days until your 18th birthday but on the other hand giving you the responsibility of your siblings.  What will she do when you are not there.  Are you sure she is that adamant about your 18th....??? Try a heart to heart talk with her first.....if she is that adamant about you leaving on your 18th birthday, I have to tell you that she is wrong, as a parent myself I would never fathom of doing that or saying that to my child.....I wish you luck and think your thoughts out....lay out all the pros and cons.....|`|AA11198222	well i totally agree its not ur responsibility but think of the little ones they didnt ask for any of it either it may not be ur responsibility but helping may influence the kids for the rest of theyre lives no greater feeling ahen u see them grown up and succeeding in life to know u were apart of that to early to move in anyway besides ur family should always come first no matter what good luck
AA11902003	U have a problem!!! ur making him pay what others did! he is w u almost 24/7, if u dont trust him and start investigating him he will leave u! most of the people loves freedom, and if u really love him u should let him free and trust him. Cause he is a keeper, he seems a good guy. I know is not ur fault to act like that, cause once we 've been hurt we cant trust the same way. But give him a chance, instead asking how to investigate him, have sweet detaills w him. Dont make a drama, where there is not! boys hate that... Be sweet w him, make him some special dinner, try to be always w a smile and try to dont start a fight w no reason. Imagine ur life w out him, dont take him 4 granted!... And if u trust him and he fails to you, at least u tried and gave all u could. Remember life is like that, until we find the one... everything could happen but is not a reason 4 u to dont trust and love.|`|4wOOa0JNaa	If you can't trust him, investigate why.     Most such hunches are really founded in facts that we just don't want to face. In other words, you know why you shouldn't trust him, but you won't admit it, even to yourself.    If you really are crazy and you like him, don't burden him with yourself until you get help recognizing reality.|`|f4Tksyd8aa	Speak to him on a positive note.

I didnt know until my ex's bestfriend told me they where going out... I do karate so i could break her ugly face, but instead that i waited cause i knew what goes arround comes back arround. Both (my ex and her) failed the year, they also fight all the time... she is loudy and loves to make a drama all the time. Now he regrets and want me back, she is crying all the time and nobody talk's to her anymore. He losted his friends and my ex treats her really bad. So my point is... u enjoy the most when life make justice by itself!  And cause of my god behavior I look all the time like a glamorous girl while she looks like a drama-vulgar girl.

d9N5t4Uraa	Hola linda Bueno antes k nada dejame decirte k tu situacion me es familiar por k me ha pasado a mi e incluso a mis amigos hombres, con decirte k tengo un amigo k hasta la casa tenia.... lo k te puedo decir es k eres un ni?a muy linda y no se vale lo k te esta haciendo..pero yo entiendo k lo kieres y muchisimo, pero no hay nada k puedas hacer... es algo por lo k tienes k pasar y nadie podemos hacer nada por ti mas k darte nuestro apoyo y comprension , cari?o y consejos, y por mucho k te duela creo k lo mejor es k te separes de el por k para empezar si sigues pegada a el no t va a extra?ar ni te va a comparar y mucho menos va a valorar lo k tenia contigo recuerda k cuando t vea perdida, t va a valorar....y es posible k regrese aunque lo dudo pero la mejor recomendacion es olvidalo xk no puedes confiar en el y algo k debes hacer es k llores mucho, golpes la pared o la almhoada, y cuando tu creas k ya no merece k llores por el dejes de hacerlo    entonces sal a hacer ejercicio por k es antidepresor y mejor k las pastillas cuidate tu belleza, sal con amigos, y aunque te cueste no hables de el para k se te vaya saliendo y si es necesario busca nuevos amigos, busca un trabajo para k estes ocupada y demuestrale lo k se perdio, y ya encontraras a alguien k valga la pena y lo vas a encontrar y te volveras a enamorar te lo prometo y va a ser aunque no quieras !!!!    en estos momentos es dificil yo lo se, pero tienes k sufrir y tienes k pasar por esto par ser una mejor persona y madurar,    y por ultimo como consuelo recuerda lo q dijo Jesus "el k a hierro mata a hierro muere" asi k animo y encomiendate a el.    sipones esto en practica ya luego de 1 a?o veras k diferencia en tu vida y entonces te vas a acordar de tu amiga Regina si me necesitas escribeme regihart@yahoo.com  saludos y k te mejores.|`|xMeUYUh9aa	Si quieres empezar de nuevo,el tendria que dejar a la otra,y si no la deja es por que no te quiere,obvio.|`|2bRDJmmKaa	te puedo ayudar en algo...???    avilaclick@msn.com|`|cna9EgtZaa	hola... si te valoras a ti misma, te daras cuenta que eres su pasatiempo, dime, a donde se fueron esos 4 a?os de ralacion? era en realidad amor o era otra cosa? tu tienes sintomas de algo llamado "infatiacion" que es algo muy parecido al amor pero no es amor, el amor se da a respetar y hace muchas cosas por la perosna amada, pero siempre con dignidad, "estar juntos" me imagino que te refieres a tener sexo con l pues se hace el amor cuando es de 2, sin que el lo tomara en cuenta creo que solo esta jugando con las 2 pues ni ama a su actual pareja por que la enga?a contigo y ni a ti pues solo eres un pasatiempo... ten un poco de dignidad y si el no supo valorarte, ya veras que otro hombre lo hara... pero no dejes que te siga usando como hasta ahora....si sintes algo como esto, es seguro que estas infatuada y no enamorada: Emociones extra?as.  Despus de separarte de la persona sientes un vaco que no puedes explicar.  Ninguna otra cosa te llena excepto estar y hablar solamente con ese muchach que te hace escuchar campanadas estrepitosas en tu corazn.  La mayora de las ocasiones la persona se siente desanimada y no quiere hacer nada si la otra persona no est presente. espero que te ames a ti para tomar decisiones correctas... suerte|`|AA11902003	si el realmente te quisiera no andaria ahorita con alguien ni te hubiera enga?ado. Recuerda esta frase: si me enga?as una vez es tu culpa, pero si me enga?as dos veces es mi culpa. No regreses con l, entiendo que loq uieras y lo extra?es, pero el solo esta jugando contigo. No esta a tu lado pero tampoco quiere perderte.. eso no es justo. Mejor dejalo y enmienda tu vida! Ya vendra alguien q si te valore.|`|a07775a1d5b6b14d0125f6b0fb8dc4b0aa	Haber , haber haber...lo que explicaste fue que tu lo buscas a el. Estuviste en el momento en el que perdio a su padre ( el te llamo)?  Le llamas y le dices que lo quieres ver. Te dejas ayudar porque estas sin empleo. Lo que pasa es que estas super confundida. Y estas tomando el papel de "victima" "Se quedaron juntos" aun tu sabiendo que sigue con su novia ( y tu dignidad)?     Madura por tu propio bien porque de lo contrario tu misma te estas haciendo da?o. No culpes a nadie de tu falta de criterio para saber que el esta mas interesado en la otra chica.    Cuida mas tu autoestima, tus emociones y tus sentimientos. Para que los demas te aprecien mejor.

Bien porque la nube est ms cerca.|`|JTznqPe8aa	cuando uno no esta en tu piel, contestar es muy facil.  es muy feo lo que te pasa, me da mucha pena, pero tambien pienso que si l te confunde es porque vos das lugar a que eso pase, pensa que hombres hay millones, ademas si te enga?o, no vas a tenerle confianza nunca mas, y eso a la larga, te trae problemas.  Yo creo que es confusion, amor, costumbre y una gran mezcla de sentimientos por el solo hecho de haber llevado una relacion tan larga y hace tan poco que termino.  Tal ves l tambien necesite tiempo para darse cuenta que quiere, porque por  lo que decis que pasan momentos juntos, yo creo que esta confundido.  pero vos deberias abrirte nuevos horizontes, la vida no se acaba cuando un amor|`|x9OUMq3qaa	Yo creo que deberias de dejarlo de ver definitivamente, ya que verlo solo te va a hacer mas da?o, y no te ayuda a olvidar, si te enga?o y ademas esta con otra persona ahorita, no creo que este interesado en regresar contigo y entonces no vale lapena que estes sufriendo por el, yo estuve en una situacion similar y de verdad alejarme fue lo mejor, sufri por un tiempo pero despues me di cuenta que quedarme con el hubiera sido la peor desicion, ahora estoy muy bien y estoy con una persona que si vale la pena.|`|lrR3cpCmaa	Kat@ty, lo siento por ti, tu auto estima est por los suelos, no dejes que pisoteen tu dingindad, es lo ultimo que debemos de perder como ser humano, no importa el tiempo que estuviste con alguien, no te valor, como mujer, como amiga, ni como compa?era, si nunca fue tuyo dejalo ir, y si es tuyo que vuelba a ti pero con condiciones, valorate como mujer que sos, no des a conocer que esta derrotada, porque a tu espalda se rien de ti,  Se ms inteligente y astuta, y no te ahoges en un vaso de agua, porque cuando tu mal sea viejo, para l ser nuevo  busca otra forma de distraerte que no te perjudique, nadie se ha muerto por amor, s practica.  Buea suerte
AA10575417	That's really sweet...  you should pursue her, ask her out in a simple date, like a coffee, or a study date, or walk her home and carry her things for her. Drop hints about your intention to take her to the prom etc.  Try also to do good in your class so that you can really understand her plus you can study together and instead of being a source of distraction, you can be a source of inspiration for each other and a life line as well..  you better move fast, or else some swift talker might replace you in her heart|`|yj2QCuoDaa	dare to make a move man!!|`|TZhrCQcWaa	Woh!! 11 years!!

Seriously, I'm pretty impatient myself, and I give up on crushes after a few months :)    Anyway, I definitely think you should go for it.  As you pointed out- you've liked her since kindergarten- you know your feelings for her are real, and you don't really have anything to lose at this point, anyway.      Be confident and good luck :)|`|NkyNI55zaa	c'mon dude! seriously! make a move will ya! n anyway if she likes u too then u r already bringing her marks down  as she must be thinking of u already most of the time.

Quit living in your fears and break through them.  You'll have twice as much fun on the other side.....  Good Luck!!!|`|AA10299502	IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PROBLEM IS YOUR LOW SELF-ESTEEM!...|`|3LJjUboUaa	Wow.  I think you are just being the paranoid type.  When your self-esteem is so low, it is easy to not accept what others tell you about yourself.  When I am in a relationship, I tend to not believe it when the guys tells me I'm sexy....or that I turn him on.  To me it isn't fathomable (is that a freaking word lol).  I can't actually accept the fact that maybe I do make the person happy because I have been in past relationships were I was treated like ****....and was convinced that I was nothing.      You have to look past your own self-esteem and find out whether you truly believe she is telling the truth (not whether you believe if the things she is saying is true....such as you being sexy).  Nevermind if you don't believe it....if she wants to think your dirty smelly feet are hot....then let her.      Also...if she chased you for so long, then she truly likes you.  Take it from a girl that has chased an ex for longer....we don't do it just to do it.  We truly do care!      Do me a favor and go to my profile and check out my latest question.  Leave me an answer to my relationship question.  Thanks in advance!|`|eGXhmFcOaa	You're gonna NEED to learn to let go if you don't stop sabotaging your self! MY GOSH what more can this girl do to show you she cares???? She's proven it! And don't you think she would know if you were cute and funny etc?? Why would she waste her time if it wasn't true? The problem is you and your self esteem. You need to understand and to BELEIVE that you are worth loving and obviously you are because she does! Love yourself too! the biggest threat to your happiness right now is you. And I guarantee if you don't stop being so insecure and paranoid you will cause what you fear.   YOU DESERVE FOR SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU OF COURSE!! Just relax and enjoy it more and question it less! And you need to trust her enough to talk to her. You left someone who loved you because you couldn't be honest. Think how that must have hurt HER, and yet she is STILL by your side . BELIEVE HER! If you can't get these negative thoughts to stop even if you really try then talk to your doctor about getting on some medication because it could be a  chemical imbalance that meds would correct. And for God's sake be HONEST w/ ur Doc.  !!!!!
tpHhK5Mhaa	Your best bet is to do it through the court system, have them file for a motion of discovery.     There isn't any legal way for you to find out on your own, that I'm aware of.|`|B5GfkjFKaa	Your part, or your lawyers part, is to be sure that he isn't hiding income.  Harder if he's self-employed.  If you don't have one, get one, with the stipulation that his fees come out of your ex.  He filed the motion, you're just trying to protect your children's interests.    If this change will put you into the welfare system, the prosecuting attorney or friend of the court may be of help.|`|Zmx40Nnpaa	Would you want him digging up this kind of information on you? Please try to remember that this man is your child's father.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Not unless he is willing to tell you. There isn't a whole lot you can do here. If they feel he is making less and needs to pay less you will just have to adjust.|`|AA12305326	if you don't want to ask him - ask your attorney. or his.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	he will have to disclose this information to the judge.  But I am assuming that if you have a lawyer, he can request that information from the x's attorney.  But your x may in fact be making less $$$'s that before, especially if he has lost his job and obtained a new one, or if his company cut his pay.  It may also be that maybe you have received a raise, that would offset the difference between the 2 salaries.  But the judge will not just reduce it without first looking at his income and income tax forms.|`|BmU1755Uaa	He has to submit it to the courts in order to pull it off.    Whether you know or not is irrelevant. The judge will know.|`|YgSio4vgaa	The money is for the kid,not YOU!!!  What the judge determined is plenty to support the child.  Thats why its called CHILD SUPPORT!  not Ex wife or girlfriend splurge/revenge money.|`|6HrePsidaa	How much is he paying you now. The thing is that child support should not be used as a weapon of spite against your ex. If he is consistent with payments that the both of you agreed upon then he is in the clear. and if he is making less then he used to he could probably pay less. and the court will know exactly how much he makes.|`|wfSFS5kcaa	If you have his social security number, birth date, and things like that you can go online and find that information. You might have to pay to find it out but you can do it,|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	find his last tax return.....or find a way to win the lottery and dump him forever.  Focus on what you can do so eventually it won't matter whether he supports you or not.  Try to imagine what it would be like if he didn't pay anything.  What would you do to get by.  What would it take to make ends meet or get a better paying income???   Take it a step further.  Don't let what he does limit your own creativity or creating a better future for you that doesn't involve him.  When you figure that out then it won't matter what he makes because anything he gives you will just be a bonus anyway.  Good Luck!!|`|wgkztsk7aa	not really unless you know someone he works with and makes the same as he does....but to have it lowered he will have to prove to the court he is making less than when he was ordered to pay support in the first place....no matter what the court will go by what he makes and they will check the paper they go by......|`|AA11558652	I think you'll have to hire an investigator.  My ex did the same thing and the hearing judge granted reduction simply b/c my ex said work is slow due housing market (he's a self-employed pool tiler) and he said he couldn't find work.  There's no proof filed by my ex and his attorney, other than the Income Affidavit.  My ex owns 2 properties and 1 lot that worth almost half a million, and he and his wife bought a Lexus SUV with cash.  And his support payment got reduced to 450/mth.  Prior to the hearing I had filed form asking for his tax records, but maybe it's not the right procedure or something so it was ignored.  I don't know where to research to find out whether or not you can push the request for proof of financial information.  At this point, I think I'll just hire an investigator.    AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ASSUMED THE ASKER is going AFTER THE MONEY FOR HERSELF,   If my ex can afford to live with his new wife and 2 kids in a house that worth bought at 350k, ON HIS INCOME ALONE.  Owns another house that he rents out.  And a lot.  The same ex who hardly sees his kid unless it'd look good to the court that he does, I think he can afford more than just 450/mth. DON'T ASSUME.|`|l4gqo2LBaa	Did you ever stop to think that he wants to have it lowered for a reason??  A legitimate reason~ Say like....he honestly can't afford to pay what he's currently paying??  The courts will need proof of his income to determine if his payments will be lowered or not...its the courts decision...not yours.. So even if you did know what his income is...I don't know what help that would be for you.
l1MDeY1Naa	If your still in school, why bother with dating?  Do you really need that kind of drama in your life???  You are way better off being just friends with boys then to be limited in who you can be friends with.  You don't need the heartache, or headaches of dating, it only limits the number of good guys that you can get to know.|`|5paPd4qlaa	choose between them, obviously. either keep the bf or, if you're sure he likes you, dump the bf and go for the new guy. or ditch both of them if you feel like being single.|`|1ae169d5afb570e364ee51963f52e1d9aa	Ignore the other guy, unless you have no morals.

If he is behaving in a way that is totally obvious he is detatched from you, I'd say it's over. But men aren't good at talking about feelings like we women are. If the fight was something to do with feelings, he may have clammed up because it's a stressful subject he can't address with you. Or he may not even be aware that you think something is wrong. Use your best judgement, but be sure that you don't keep asking him about feelings. It might do more damage, and that's not what you want.|`|pdzrMfd1aa	Sayin that sh*t all the time gets annoying|`|qmC6CRWDaa	The only way to find the answer to that question is talk to him.|`|mHdXF0E0aa	um... What's he say when you say it?    If he smiles and says Thank you or gives some kind of positive sign... it's probably something you can work out.      If he's not really saying anything and kind of blows off you saying it - it's probably over.  Even if he hasn't left yet.    What happens when you talk to him about it? Ask him why he doesn't say it?  He doesn't have to say it all the time... But, obviously... since April is a bit of an issue...     Good Luck  Livia-
iwYzO6Wzaa	well for that fact that he is staring at you means that he shows some interest in you... he probably thinks that you are pretty..so dont say that you are not pretty enough...start up a conversation with him... ask him to show you have to play baseball because that is what he likes... that will help... if you like sports.. talk about your fave teams... go to a sport event with him... here is an idea i did for this one guy... i had tickets to a basketball game and i asked him to come along and it worked.. little things like that...when he looks like you.. just smile back at him.. show him that you are interested and that might help you out... good luck!|`|d974f7d9872614e12db344d3a90d6950aa	whew boys! bring a firend w- you & do the same thing that he was doing to you- let him know you girlies are scoping him out. Since he seems to be going for whos close to you- maybe he'll take the opportunity to ask your friend about you!;)|`|2kjtt35Faa	ok. if he was looking at you obviously he saw something there, go up to him and chat him up. see if you two got something in common. and if he's interesting ask him out.|`|f382f7229afd07878e760fda0a8546a8aa	i knoe ur feelings jus talk to him as friend n see were it takes u there|`|VSCJdGGTaa	omg i think he likes u.Just go up 2 him and say hi and blah blah blah and just start a conversation.Come on all people r pretty even if u think so or not.So i hope i helpped.       Erin :)|`|6LzGd5dmaa	yes he likes you or he wouldnt be showing off talk to him about baseball and you dont have to worry about how pretty you are if hes the one checking you out|`|gTATn6M6aa	Yes he likes you. He may not want you for your looks, but only for your personality. Not all guys are interest in looks. :)|`|v9DKedEpaa	I think you should talk to to him! GET_IT_GIRL!|`|oquUO3q4aa	it is as clear as day, he likes you  to talk to him , just ask him open questions:  1) where do you go to school  2) what grade is he in  3) what does he think about English class...  you know just random stuff, get to know him, before you just jump into a relationship....  and you know some guys don't care for looks, he could like a good personality, so just be yourself.    that is my advice, I'm hoping that it turns out the way that you want it to, whatever happens keep your chin raised and keep your head held high!|`|yfzwACrdaa	You go girl, he really likes you. Talk to him and see where it goes and enjoy.Good luck1

But if he's calling you once in a blue moon while you're calling him more, calmly let him know that you'd like for him to call you more. Let him know that you don't like to do the calling most of the time.|`|vDpJqbrEaa	^ ...More?|`|c3fed73b65f42a16bb31412b5d077d1baa	Call him less.

1799b6cacbca24f7fb918715c718a39aaa	Yo pienso que esta pregunta no es correcta, porque que un hombre sea atractivo o no, no quiere decir que se tenga que fijar solo en lo fisico de las mujeres, siempre lo mas importante son los sentimientos ya que de nada le sirve ni a un hombre ni a una mujer lo corporal o estetico, pues de belleza no se vive, mas bien dicho son de los sentimientos y toda la parte emocional lo que logra que dos personas se amen, si un hombre es atractivo no significa que no pueda buscarse a una mujer tierna y con mucha fragilidad y mucho amor para dar, en todo caso quienes buscan o pretenden buscar algo fisico simplemente es eso, y la belleza fisica pasa con el tiempo, pero los sentimientos permanecen aun ahi para siempre. y son las personas que se enamoran realmente de lo interior los que son muy felices al lado de sus parejas, pues encontraron el verdadero amor y no solo una atraccion.

It's also very easy to fall back into the comfort of being with him because you two have made so many memories of being together.  The best way to be just friends is email.  Being together reminds you of being with him and at any moment you can fall back to what feels comfortable.  You just have to keep your distance and hope he doesn't take any offense to it.  Besides, you're going to college and there are plenty of distractions there.|`|5fb6a7f5538081e370cc8e62cdee4d73aa	see what u do is find u a new friend in college and really get to know that person and that will take yo mind off him and if that dont work then u can b friends wit benefits until u tired of each other... and if that doesnt work then u got problems and u gonna have to work through it wit him let him know how u feel and how u wanna do things from now on and if he care about u then he will b cool with it|`|XuMEC5PYaa	do you know we have two kind of People 1. the people that they are making Friends For Fun and sex. 2. the people that they are making freinds for there future to shaire there fellings with eachother. as i swa your Question,, you are from second group of people. so if you love your friend then you should do what your heart says but you have to do it (after thinking twice) you have to be carefull.
LPO3cYtYaa	Ciao Yasmin,  ho letto la tua domanda e mi ricordi la mia ragazza.  Solo che lei ha 24 anni!!!    Io , come uno stupido l'ho sempre criticata per questa sua invidia e solo con il tempo ho capito che in passato, forse proprio nella tua et, ha sofferto davvero tanto per questa invidia.  Io non so a che livello di invidia sei ma posso dirti la risposta alla tua domanda.    Per non essere invidiose delle altre ragazze devi imparare ad amare te stessa.  Una madre che ama tanto suo figlio difficilmente  invidiosa dei figli degli altri.  Tu non devi fare altro che amarti per come sei, amare il tuo fisico, amare il tuo carattere con tutti i suoi lati senza scordare che tu hai cmq il dovere di migliorarti perch si desidera sempre il meglio per chi si ama e tu devi desiderarlo per te.    Non so se ho reso l'idea....  E' come un tifoso di una squadra di calcio dove anche se la sua squadra non vince niente rimane cmq fedele e la sostiene fino all'ultimo.  Tu dovresti "tifare" Yasmin.  Non so se ci siamo capiti...  Se ragionerai in questo modo, non solo proverai meno invidia ma diventerai anche una persona migliore dentro e fuori.     PS: Fidati di queste cose che ti ho scritto. Per capire il problema della mia ragazza ho cercato in siti di psicologia e in tutti la chiave del problema era amare se stessi.  Ovviamente ci sono anche problemini secondari ma sono di secondaria importanza e hanno una soluzione specifica caso per caso.|`|khkqxxV6aa	Per noi ragazze  normale: quella ha i finachi pi stretti, quella ha pi seno di me, ha il viso pi carino... anche a me succede devo ammetterlo spesso...ma bisogna capire che ognuno va bene com'... e che ognuno  speciale a suo modo|`|jjoG2tJtaa	scusa..aprezza il tuo look nn quello delle altre!!!!!!!!!o sei tu o nn 6 nessuno!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|dcde60dd1a00ffd5289b9620ad8ba286aa	invidiosa di cosa? nessuno e' perfetto! e tutti siamo unici! non troverai due persone uguali! guarda che i difetti li hanno tutti, solo che tu ti concentri piu' sui tuoi che su quelli delle persone che ti sono attorno! prova a fare il contrario, e a vadara gli altri come una somma di pregi e difetti. ti renderai conto di essere perfettamente normale. e non ci sara' piu' nulla da invidiare..(io non invidio nessuno. e non penso di soffrire di narcisismo).|`|9c2dd8b5532d82416af432e358b57b23aa	E perch dovresti?

Breasts are nice but not the top priority. I would say that the body shape is second with her butt taking an easy third followed by breasts in fourth place. A great butt is important but not as important as a smooth figure and definitely not as important as a really pretty or cute face.    The problem with breasts is that you don't really know what they're going to look like under all those clothes.

b6af7936dad0cd1d36ee8eae23b407e0aa	Interesting question... I think most people don't think about it as literally as this.      I think that the important thing is that you are happy with yourself and that you are respectful, honest and just really nice to any woman you get involved with. If that's all in place then someone will be lucky to get you.     I don't think it's good (or probably very attractive!) to go around feeling like a 'prize to women' - sounds like you've got a better attitude than some of your friends. Just know your own worth, and don't do your head in about it!|`|gRoUgCM7aa	Actually (even though women may say different) women like a guy who is self confident, some would say cocky some wouldn't, but expecting women to be attracted to you is bad. Attraction isn't a choice, if you aren't attractive or you don't act self confident, women will quickly pass you by.|`|b9a1f9997a3e751a12c661485452507aaa	You're right. Parading around like you're a top notch guy and all the women should want you is almost always extremely unattractive.|`|e162f5d7db8f255d2a28367714b02c51aa	If you show attractive qualities, then women will think you're attractive.  Always show respect for others and for yourself, and that will shine through.....good luck...|`|AA11282609	there is nothing wrong with having expectations just don't be too disappointed when things dont work out how you want them to.     Just because your friends think so highly of themselves doesnt mean you have to be like them, sounds like you were doing alright before you started worrying about this|`|3fsOJXzkaa	you can expect people to be attracted to you, but you can't know who those people might be. but you also have to expect people to not be attracted to you. it's kind of a tossup.
IToIh53maa	ACTUALLY everyone always get caught...............by God.    -These are what man do to lie without getting caught:    *****Few things that they follow:  1. Know your story. Make sure you firmly establish what you are going to use as the basis of your lie. Make sure it is easy to remember and do not waver in your story. Inconsistancies will give you away.  2. It's all about the details. A person who is a bad liar is vague. Add some details to your story to add color and make it more believable.    *****Things they avoid:  Do not go overboard. Although embellishing and adding details to a story can make it more believable, it can get messy, and you can give yourself away. Details are great, but don't give too many that you will not remember your story.|`|ce46cc631243408096334a4509da2b2aaa	I have notice that some girls don't want to see the tell tell signs that they might not be up to know good.    I say the only tactic they use is gain your trust.    Edit:    I think it is easy to lie personally,  ya just do it.  Lies that I failed at... I was overridden with guilt or lack knowledge in the subject.  I am not sure why others are bad liars.    I usually don't lie big.  I am not that bad of a person.  A lot of my lies are partial truths... so they are hard to question.    Edit:   I guess my best suggestion is take it slow if with a guy.  If he is in just for the sex, then he won't respect your decision to wait.|`|1SCzxmKYaa	Lol anyone can play a girl, I mean tell'em what they want, words without a meaning, but why does anybody wanna play a girl. I rather keep a woman byy my side. Lover or friend, but player is meant for fake men, you need a rel a guy if thats what your worried about|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	I don't consider myself a playa and their is no technique about lying.  If you tell one lie then you have to tell another one to cover it up.  If all you do is lie then eventually they will come back to haunt you.  No one I know wants to have the rep for being a liar, because if you lie about one thing then the chances are you can lie about something else.  With no trust their is no honor.  With no honor then your word doesn't mean crap and I wouldn't associate myself with you.  I'm hoping you're asking this question so maybe you can figure out when you're being lied to.  In that case, whenever you think you're being lied to just stare into someone's eyes and watch if they can tell a lie without looking away.  Do they studder or get twitchy???  Lying is very devious and most of the time they can't lie with a straight face.|`|2jiBqNpuaa	but i don't want to lie to you..because ur very .........|`|e1rULiP8aa	I get called Playa at times but you know what, I just tell the truth about it. I am just straight up from the hip tell it like it is. Got a gf who is very accommodating / participating and its all good. Fact is my sex life is amazing (yes keeping it safe) and the drama is down around zero. So my advice for playas? Find a woman on your level, be straight up about it an you will be nuts deep in pus for the remainder.|`|4451121270936791354c3b48d851bd6caa	well let me say... you are very pretty, thats one more compliment among millions    well a man would look you straight into your eyes and really get into you and he'll say some sweet stuff, some high quality bs. he'll keep you interested in the conversation just like any man, but he'll try to lean in more, to distinguish the difference between a man and a player, i would say the touching the player would do. he would try to make more slow, out of nowhere contact and basically its all to try to get you to bed. you cant lie without getting caught eventually, i dont even lie when i speak anymore, but a player is out of your life so quick, you cant even put the (unfit) peices together.|`|F4bJJDy9aa	Well first you have to be able to look someone in the face and learn how to lie. But some guys are just stupid. They can't sstare straight at someone and lie they always have to look away and have their eyes look up and down or side to side when they are talking. Me I tell a woman everyhting she wants to hear and more. then I will always look at her when I talk to her to make her think that I am telling her the truth. Then when I get what I want I just drop her liek a rock.

AA11902003	Por experiencia te digo... el karma funciona de maravilla. Para qu vas a vengarte, solo pierdes tu tiempo. Vas a ver que con el tiempo el pagar lo que ha hecho. No hay nada mejor que ver como la vida toma justicia por si sola. Si te vengs de l, puede que a el ni le afecte y que luego tu recibas un karma por haberte vengado. Adems que venganza le puedes hacer?? si el anda con mil mujeres y dems, no creo que le afecte que le hagas algo, l ya est acostumbrado y puede conseguir mujeres fcilmente. Mejor comprtate como una dama e ignrale. Bien dicen por ahi, que no hiere ms el odio sino que la indiferencia. Suerte|`|505fc9065d0c4063a3b73aa97433d477aa	ya sabes lo que dicen.....TODO LO QUE HAGAS SE TE DEVUELVE EL DOBLE Y ES UN KARMA QUE ESA PERSONA LLEVARA POR MUCHO TIEMPO POR SER DESHONESTO .|`|s3215hqMaa	Es un desgraciado en todo el sentido de la palabra...es un enfermo y dale gracias a dios que ya no compartes con l pues es una persona falsa, es mas no te hace falta vengarte mas bien es tenerle lastima pues es una persona que apesar que tiene dos mujeres no sabe lo que quiere en la vida y est mas solo que nadie, o te parece que el es feliz?, tenle lastima...pero sabes la vida se encargara de cobrarselo, solo procura indagar ms en tus futuras relaciones para no volver a cometer el mismo error. Te doy un dato que te ayudara mucho, indagar sobre el historial familiar es bueno, las disfunciones familiares influyen mucho en las conductas de las personas, lo que ellos ven en su casa lo repiten en la calle OJO CON ESO!!!...Saludos!!|`|AJVURgcraa	ignorandolo !!!  Si le demuestras que estas ardida o molesta con el, solo conseguiras que se burle mas de ti... pegale donde mas le duele que es su ego...

Para empezar creo que eso no te lleva a nada bueno antes que nada hay muchas formas de sacar tu coraje yo te recomeindo que te encierres en tu cuarto y saques todo ese sentimiento gritando llorando y golpeando una almohada.  veras que con eso te sentiras mas tranquila. no tiene caso darle importancia a ese hombre insignificante que solo te destrozo tu vida, veras que hay hombres que estaran tras de ti y seran libres y sinceros no te preocupes por eso.  ahora si estas mal no se si recomendarte que les hables a sus mujeres para que vean que clase de hombre es a el le dolera.  pero no hagas eso ok  bye|`|b0d27c578934166622a32b4a39e243c4aa	La mejor venganza es la indiferencia! La venganza lo hara saber que le importas lo suficiente como parapensar en el! Lo que mas le puede a alguien asi es que lo ignores!|`|fCW7tYFzaa	Mira damos por hecho que es un pobre infeliz de por, eso no cabe duda, asi que yo diria que ni te gastes en pensar como desquitarte... el tiempo solo se va a encargar de el, eso te lo aseguro, todo lo que hiciste mal en vida lo pagas en vida tambien. Ademas nisiquiera merece que te gastes en pensar en el, ni en hacer por aqui esta pregunta, sencillamente no merece nada de tu preciado tiempo!!!
28zPPqOcaa	Hay amiga cuanto lamento tu situacion, pero acabas de conocer a este nuevo tipo y ya estas convencida de que es el hombre de tu vida?  Creo que mas que nada debes estarlo idealizando, el problema en si radica en que no deseas estar con tu ahora "esposo". Porque no mejor eres sincera contigo misma, trata de meditar bien que es lo que deseas, porque te casaste con el a final de cuentas? Te obligaron? no lo creo...  Por el momento deberias poner en claro tu situacion con tu esposo antes de involucrar a terceras personas. Te sugiero que veas a algun terapeuta alguien que pueda guiarte y asi estes mas segura de lo que quieres en la vida... muchisima suerte|`|b62399afa01b34f0624f15e861011df0aa	"As o asa",  Prepara los papeles para el Divorcio.

Con lo referente al otro chico es cuestion de que lo trates y lo conozcas ms sin jugarle la vuelta al otro.

No hagas eso a to prometido serias uan persona sin corazon solo estas en UNA ILUSION.  no puede ser el amor de tu vida baja de la nube.  casate y si no funciona existe e divorcio
636289f168f4556d6549783dd20ce57eaa	No es infidelidad pero si una grave confusion!    Primero por que en su corazon el chavo habia perdido todas esperanzas de volver y solo le quedaba como consuelo buscar a alguien y ese alguien le dio unas horas de placer!    La confusion esta en que si esa persona que sirvio por horas de comodin siente algo por el chavo, ahi si que se armo la grande por que la decepcion nadie las aguanta!    Ahora yo le hago la pregunta al chavo este: Como se sentiria el si su novia quien penso que ya no regresarian juntos busco un consuelo por unas dos o tres horas, alguien que la abrigo y le dio cari?o en ese instante de depresion? Consideraria el chavo este una infidelidad por parte de su chava?|`|nIYU3H8Paa	no, no es infidelidad porque ese dia habias terminado con tu novia, igual que no se te torne costumbre|`|A79Tw9i4aa	Jajaja.es muy buen verso,tipico de machista  y  de charlatan!!|`|D8yvT2Xkaa	Para mi lo es, porque ke tal si termino con su novia para poder acostarse con la otra y luego regresar y que pareciera que no fue infidelidad..    Es un infiel..|`|nIpOiKQGaa	si porque si lo pregunstas es que te sientes culpable, y seguro terminastes a propio para acostarte con otra|`|IRFrfTxMaa	Si, claro que si, por que cuando uno "termina" debe de darse un tiempo precisamente por eso, por que los sentimientos estan confusos, como es posible que si "amas" tanto a tu novia, terminas con ella hoy y HOY tienes relaciones con otra, claro que es ser infiel es como que estabas esperando a estar libre por un instante para luego irte a tener relaciones con alguien mas, para luego volver a tu relacion....si yo fuera ella estaria MUY enojada, probablemente seria yo la que terminara esta vez para siempre.....SUERTE!!!|`|164677091d4c6912fd5d62ac529b86d1aa	No exactamente. Porque ya no era tu pareja (yo no lo considero) si ya no hiba a regresar, lo malo seria que fuera mientras fueran novios, y fue claro al contartelo, aunque ahi se nota lo mucho que te que no espero un tiempo prudente para tener relaciones, pero habria que analizarlo friamente.|`|87931f5849479c734de2dc35880d8efaaa	Claro que lo es!!! como que no........si fuera ese un caso aparte, entonces se valdra dejar a tu pareja ,tener relaciones con quien quieras y bolber con tu pareja al par de das y si lo continuas asendo as no es infidelidad porque la dejastes por 4 das????

Al menos tuvo la consideracin de mandar a su novia por un real tubo antes de acostarse con otra.    Sin embargo, el hecho de que 4 das despus de botar a la novia, est con otra claramente significa que ya conoca a esta chica y hablaban y se vean DURANTE el mismo tiempo en que estaba con su novia.  La negra intencin ya exista.    En la alternativa, este hombre es capaz de acostarse con cualquiera, si es que en realidad conoci a dicha mujer durante los 4 das de "recreo".  Perro sarnoso!  Solo le abrieron la puerta y se volvi loco.    Y si en verdad la novia le cree la pendejada de "noviazgo perfecto" la loca, e ingenua, es ella.    Cada vez que se presenten problemas correr a la cama con otras?  Elemental.|`|bCWWezDfaa	Yo creo que tu debes responder a eso.    no conocemos realmente la causa de su termino de relacion, pero algo que creo muy relevante es el hecho de que independientemente de que se termine por algo grave o no, como que se guarda un respeto (un luto) al menos un tiempo, eso de que termines con la pareja y en una horas estes con otra persona pues ?cmo?     ya estaba planeado o que buena suerte o que pex.... eso es para mi lo relevante fijate el saber como puedes estar con otra persona en la cama si se supone estas dolido (a) por que acabas de terminar una relacion...     pero igual te digo que si tu fuiste el infiel aclarate la duda acepta tu error y adelante no se lo digas a tu pareja a menos que cumpla con las las 3 respuestas (1.- No va a da?ar? 2.- Es de vital importancia decirlo? y 3.- Afectas a otras personas con lo q diras? ) es decir ?VALE LA PENA DECIRLO?     Y si eres al que enga?aron, por que te martirizas asi de alguna forma fuiste parte de lo que paso, asi que no te quejes y mejor aun si volvio ya sabras que nadie lo hace como tu, y que ese ERRORSOTE le sirvio a tu pareja  y a ti para que en un futuro se valoren mas y no jueguen a eso de terminamos nos reconciliamos por que es una agonia muy dolorosa, dense espacios  de un rato cuando se enojen pero no terminen de todo. eso desgasta la relacion  por que se van acumulando situaciones que despues salen a flote.

1100071d61b564f59fcdb5caa7386db8aa	Why would you want to be the woman who tried to break up the family when they were trying to give it another shot. Don't interrupt their second chance and don't complicate it by trying to attempt to be his friend.  His relationship with you isn't as important as his with the mother of his children. And even if they don't work out as a couple, they need to try to figure out what their family dynamic is going to be. And this is their time to figure it out. Please be the bigger person with the self control and walk away. No friendship. And tell him why, " You want to be sure that he can give his family a fighting chance".  If after it is all said and done and he wants to be with you, and they have decided that they wont be together, then you can decide if you are even open to the idea.  You will feel much better about yourself if you step aside and let them give it a shot.

YES! Brittney is absolutely correct! I ended a relationship very much like this awhile back. He loves you, but he isn't IN love with you. He's probably staying with you because it's COMFORTABLE. He's been with you for some time, and he knows you quite well, and he's comfortable with what he knows. The unknown is uncertain and Uncomfortable. As human beings we tend to choose the path of least resistance. That's why he chooses words such as, "maybe". That way he's not obligated to a definite choice. He sounds as though he has become more of a close friend, rather than boyfriend. I would END it....Only YOU can decide whether you can handle being, "just friends" after a 4 year relationship. (Which is usually a very difficult thing to accomplish. Keep in mind that it can, and has been done though...It's all about what you want). Best, BEST of luck to you! ; )|`|zy8tQI8maa	It's a cake and eat it too situation.  He does love you, but he's not in love with you and he is waiting to see what happens, potentially waiting for another female option to become available, but in the meantime he is still getting whatever he can from you.    Why don't you want to let him off the hook?  Aren't you just hurting yourself by not taking the power in the situation and tossing him out?  I can understand that you still love him, it's comfortable and difficult to move on, but you may have to accept that it is head towards over.    Then again, he may just need some space.  Sit him down and ask him where his head is at.  He may not fully tell you, but it will hopefully give you some insights as to where the relationship is at.

Tu verras ca va lui faire tout bizarre et il va surement se rapprocher un peu. Ou alors autre technique tu lui sors le grand jeu (strip tease ou petit repas champagne aux chandelles) pr lui donner envie de passer la soire et la nuit avec toi et pas avec ses potes.  Bon courage en tout cas.  bisous|`|mLHbPfvwaa	perso mon homme sor pas il et pluto genre pentouflard et sa me convien comme sa, si on sor ses emsenble si non rien , ses pas toujour bon de les laisser trops de liberter a la longue il en profite|`|629ec8fb478ef284057463b45bf7cd5daa	essaie de faire un effort et de l'accompagner dans ses sorties, mme si tu as  l'impression que tu seras de trop.  tu auras surement des affinits avec ses collgues, et tu prendras ainsi plus de plaisir  sortir avec lui  quant  cette fille avec qui il est si bien, mfies-toi tout de meme, et il vaut peut etre mieux avoir un oeil sur elle|`|993678689677544b7b11aa0259f5440daa	sort avec lui quand il te le propose c pas par ce qu'ilinsiste pas qu'il a pas envie que tu sois la et au debut tu te sentira peut etre a part mais en connaissant c amis ca se passera mieu|`|1nbfJI96aa	?a fais seulement 6 mois que vous tes ensemble  normalement votre amour il est encore frais ?a veut dire que si y'as vraiment de l'amour vous allez tout faire ensemble sortir en boite c bien mais il veux mieux avec une personne qu'on aime mfie toi et bonne chance|`|UiUNpy7Saa	Et toi? n'as tu pas des passions des loisirs, des occupations, que tu pourrais envisager de raliser, au lieux de l'attendre.

YAwvszITaa	That is truly sad that he has leukemia but I wouldn't go there with him. He has been pursuing you relentlessly for 25 years and now wants a friendship? No I wouldn't go for it. If he has kept up his charade of a marriage while being in love with you for 25 years he could probably say anything and make it sound believable. He has a wife and family that can offer him what he needs at this time. Don't let him make you feel guilty with the leukemia.|`|zEp6xHacaa	he just wants what he can't have, once he has you, you will be like the woman in his current relationship, there is something wrong with this man|`|SmFVG8eXaa	That's a tough one. I think that depends on your own personal strength. It sounds like this has been a neverending cycle.  If you're willing to give it another try - clearly define the boundaries of this friendship.  Tell him that you are not interested in a relationship and cannot and will not be pressured by him.  If he does so in the least little bit, tell him you're gone that it's no more chances.   If you're not willing to put yourself through that again, tell him that you're sorry and wish you could be there for him, but right now you have to take care of yourself.|`|SsvyPMjcaa	It sounds like you have a big history together, and you've had a lot of hard decisions to make. It also sounds like he's very insecure, and at a time in his life, with leukemia, he needs you. Be there for him AND his family, maybe even try to become friends with his wife. At a time like this, even being a friend to him is all he can ask for.|`|KZMezu7oaa	I think it maybe a plot to make you develop feelings for him you have already acknowleged aren't there. It sounds to me as if he knows your getting fed up and this is his last ditch effort to try to get you to develop something for him. If I were you I'd email him back telling him EXACTLY why you are severing contact. That you are sorry to hear about his ailment but that you are not putting yourself into the position again where you are uncomfortable around him because he's pushy about his feelings toward you. He's a man so don't buy into the excuse he'll undoubtedly give "It won't happen again, I'm sorry..blah,blah blah"|`|QFfewAywaa	Hi i'm Edita! Well i honestly think that you should just send him and e-mail saying so and so and be honest with him make sure he understands where your coming from, i think fading away is the best you can do it will be hard but tell him you just can't be friends but if he ever needs anything please i beg you be there for him cuz i had a problem like this before and even tho we aren't friends when he had an heart attack i was still there for him! Do what you have to do. I hope my advice has helped you in a way and i hope the best for you! Have a great day! =)|`|utGddhnVaa	That's tough. It sounds like this guy harasses you more then befriends you though. You would also think that this would be a good time for him and his wife to confide in eachother.    I suppose you could give another chance though and if he still persists to get you to fall in love with him I would suggest never speaking with him again.

The way you and a girl can hit it off is if the first conversation with a girl is a hit.  I think the reason why you hit it off with guys better is because you have more to talk about.|`|izbAdDUraa	Maybe because we sense you are bisexual (gay). And thats a turn off. I would NEVER date a guy who is into men, even the slightest interest. Total turn off. You are either on one team or the other and it sounds like you are team gay. Which is perfectly fine. But quit confusing yourself!

It's awesome=) I'm straight but I have huge respect for people who've embraced themselves=) Go for it, man!|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Please ignore them.  With your statement you are handsome.  Go to parties and pickup conversation with pretty chiks they will fall for you.  It happen to me and now I have lots of girlfriends.
SsfnitjXaa	The problem is that he was not fair in telling you how serious he took your problems.  He has already moved on while leaving you clueless that these thoughts were going through his mind.  Nine times out of Ten these men have found another girl and are hoping from the marriage bed to their lovers bed (so much more comfy to do it that way).      You are going to have to go through the same process as he did of disconnecting.  Do not plead or beg or bug him about staying.  The more you act like you have moved on the better.  Get real busy and try to stay out of the house as much as possible.  Get a make over, buy new clothes.    Even if he came back you will always be wondering if he is going to up and just move again.  Don't think of this as an end of your marriage, think of it as the beginning of your new life.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	First thing I'd like to know is WHY JKOOL said that he's leaving because she doesn't understand him??? I think it's more like THEY don't understand each other????  He has NO IDEA whats going on in this girls marriage. You give bad advice JKOOL.|`|QCmRRbABaa	There is not point to still in a relationship when he doesn't love you. Move on!  He doesn't deserve your love.|`|GBC39wHAaa	Sounds to me as if he has detached from being close to you because he wants out. I'm sorry to say this but it really doesn't sound good. I'm wondering did|`|MOeToR1Xaa	ask him wat u did wong|`|GeruGGOQaa	Sounds like he's through with the relationship regardless of any feelings you may still have.  The best thing you can do is simply move on with your life.  You're still going to feel hurt for a while but as long as you don't sit around feeling sorry for yourself the hurt will eventually go away and your emptiness will be filled with someone new.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Why do I feel like he's counting down the days until Feb 27th?  He must be like a 5 year old in December right now.  And like the 5 year old who's done ripping open all his Christmas gifts, your husband will probably have that same empty feeling.  Because Christmas is hardly about Jesus anymore.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	He doesn't want you to bother him because he doesn't like the stress of answering your questions.  In his mind, its over, and he will file, sooner rather than later.  My husband did this too, and even added, "We can try counseling, but I don't think it will work."  The reason it wouldn't have worked is because he was already involved with another woman (he denied this when I asked, but I had him followed).  He has decided and all you can do is to do things that will make you feel better (start working out, it helps tremendously with the stress, I promise you!) and to hire an attorney.  This is hard to do, but necessary.  The attorneys will soon tell you how they play the games that they do.  My attorney told me on the phone, that he thought my husband was having an affair (working later for years and not available by phone, since I've known him, because he was "working.").  Hire a P.I., they arent' so expensive and you could learn that he's not being honest with you.  Knowledge is liberating.  It was easier to fight for myself when I knew he was lying.  My experience tells me that men don't leave their wives before they find a replacement, so investigate.  Good luck and I'm sorry for you.  It gets easier, it does!  Good luck!|`|Y5NXQ0JPaa	Sorry to hear about the Break Up. I am sure all women wish something like these never happened to us, but it does seem he is ready and over the relationship. No matter how bad a situation might be , there is no reason to move out if you still love your spouse and you are willing to work things through. Like they always say if it was yours it will come back if its not then just let it go. I am sure he will then realize the mistake.    It will hurt but eventually you will be alright, surround yourself with people that Truly love you and support you!|`|Q8D60Ed3aa	omg Im going through the same thing too as of Sunday, except we have an 8 year old involved who has no clue we are about to get a divorce after we get our tax return. it hurts so bad, i cant even concetrate at work, i have no one to vent to or ask for advise. my husband is not being the nicest to be on top of all this. we decided to stay in the same house/different beds but i think it makes it harder because i just want to climb into bed with him and make up and live happily ever after. i dont know what to tell you, if you get any good answers to help ease the pain please let me know!|`|e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	Do you know what's the cause of all this?  What is it that you're always fighting or arguing about.  You need to turn towards each other more instead of turning away or against each other.  He's leaving because he feels that you're not understanding him.  You've been together for many years you must have a shared meaning to make it last that long.  Maybe time away from each other would help to reflect on the relationship. You both need inner change, how you view things and how you communicate with each other.|`|yNbGq4viaa	My ex and I were together for over 10 years and married for 8 of those.  We decided to split up the day after Thanksgiving, but he didn't actually move everything out until December 10th.  Those two weeks were extremely difficult as even though I was angry and hurt I had to deal with him on an almost daily basis while he was getting his things together and moving to his apartment.  He kept saying he wanted to work on things, etc. and I believed him, but then found out later that he was still seeing the person that caused us to split up in the first place.  There is no easy way to get over someone you love and that you made the ultimate commitment to.  It takes time to heal.  Once I got over the initial panic, hurt, rage, etc. and took a long, hard look at my life...I was much better off without him.  We have now been divorced for almost 6 years and I can't imagine ever going back to him or how I lived like that for so long.  Sometimes it's hard to see how unhappy you are until you get out of a situation and when it really boils down to it, you can't force him to stay and you can't beg him to either.  Your only choice is to pick yourself up, hold your head high and deal with the situation one day at a time.  Best of luck.
BYm9KzQvaa	What does he do, otherwise? sounds like you have a life, and he hasn't.    I assume he's close to your own age....too late to change. He needs a woman who is also needy, someone who HAS to be needed to feel good about herself. You need a man who is willing to share your life, and let you share his, on a fair basis, no guilting and manipulation.    I think you know where this will end, you don't really need us to tell you. Just imagine 3 years down the track, a sick baby keeping you up all night, what's he going to be doing? making your breakfast? or  whining he had to sleep alone all night?    Whatever feelings you have for him are being overpowered by the suffocation. Don't wait until you go bitter about it. This guy is a child inside, and is NOT going to grow up fast enough for you. You'll have to let him go, as gently as possible, and expect a few tantrums.    At school (college?) you are much more likely to meet someone who at least shares other interests with you.    Good luck :)|`|VSCYTZ38aa	Ditch him, fast. It's going to get increasingly worse until you can no longer even stand the thought of him.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	You should be happy that you are with a guy that actually wants to spend time with you and wouldn't rather be out in a bar hitting on other women. What would you rather, a guy who never calls or wants to spend time with you and basically doesn't care. Or a guy who loves you so much that he misses you every second you are away. It's your call but if you let him go, some other girl will be very happy to have him.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	he sounds like if you left him he would become a staulker|`|yZqRYFsPaa	spend time with him when your free!|`|GqQwdxXpaa	Dump him he won't change.|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	it's easy to suggest to drop this guy but i agree with the 1st answer, he may not go away so easily.  doesn't he have any friends?  if not, make him some friends to take up some of his time and attention.  if that's what it takes, it might be worth the trouble.  he's insecure and needs attention to feel he's worth something.  maybe you can help him find someone else.   i just think he needs someone, anyone,  to give him the attention he needs.  so if you have a neighbor lady or co-worker, i say introduce them and hang out with them.  then slowly work yourself out of the picture.  it's far-stretched yes, but this guy is stalker-material the way you describe him.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	If you really don't want to be with him anymore, explain to him that you need a break because you're very busy with work and school and need to get that on track before a relationship.  Maybe if you take a break for a bit, it'll give you both a different perspective on the relationship.|`|b6a1a2605fc16fc118c286edfa66c836aa	I wish I had a clingy boyfriend. It's the other way around for me. You should break up with him, it's obvious you have to much going on in your life right now. You don't need the stress of a boyfriend as well. I know it might be hard, but it will feel like a relief. Good Luck!|`|CEtuK7Raaa	I think if you really love him and want to try and make it work despite his recent whining, maybe you should consider exactly what kind of time he needs to spend with you.  For instance, some people revel in the idea of spending a night watching a movie on the couch.  Other's need to go out in public and be seen together.  Talk to him, find out exactly how he wants to spend time with you, and maybe you can economize the situation by meeting his needs and keeping your hectic schedule.|`|cq4ng6QLaa	You need to tell him that you need your space and school is more important right now. Maybe you and him need to take a break.|`|2b4OFx5Oaa	You have a good head on your shoulders and you are doing the right thing. The problem is your man is doing the complete wrong thing. He should understand and promote you trying to better yourself and obviously doesn't seem to understand that his role should be playing. How can you spend more time together? He can start doing things like cooking you dinner or doing small things to help you get free time is how he should be helping. However I doubt he will make the effort and it is about time you gave him the boot.    Don't be ashamed for wanting to do better. Get rid of the whiner as there are plenty of gentlemen out there who adore an independent, aspiring woman.
7VUkNBDGaa	I Def. think he likes you.  I thought at first he was just being friendly, but then he gave you his number.  Do you like him? that's the real question!

So you need to be causual but flirtly until he asks you out. Hes trying to show that he can be a good friend plus a boyfriend at the same time, hes trying to gain your trust to the next level.Hope I helped

God is concerned with how we treat each other.     We have been instructed to love   + Our neighbor as we love ourselves  + One another as Jesus loved us    When we treat each other like sex objects, when sex is taking instead of giving, we damage the human dignity of both our partner and ourselves.    True giving of yourself to another in a sacramental marriage is what love is all about.     Marriage is a symbol of God's creation of the world in an act of divine love and self-outpouring.    Marriage is a symbol of the love, commitment, intensity, and passion of Christ for the Church for which He laid down His life.    Christians take sex very seriously because it is a glorious gift from God that lets us feel just a bit like God. We become lovers, givers, and creators.    With love in Christ.

x3Ymafv3aa	damn. this sounds almost exactly like my situation a couple years ago. She seems like a party animal, and at 14, a little excessive. What you should do, is try to lighten up to her a little bit. Try to appeal to her party side a little more. She might think all the "i love yous" are kinda sappy and she wants to hang out and party more instead of settle down with one guy. Tell her you respect that, and DO something that shows how you feel. Girls love stuff that shows them how you feel as opposed to just saying it. Even if its corny, trust me, they love that shiitt.|`|4dYEfBL0aa	i think u shud move on because you're only hurting yourself with this one. she doesn't respect you because she does all these things regardless of how you feel. she doesn't deserve you. you have to leave her before she leaves you. she comes off as a swinger. and they're not looking for serious or long term relationships.  in my opinion you would be better off with someone who does in fact respect you, your family, and your feelings.|`|7c3de427a8a693c219832ffa56aefa6caa	awwww ......  thats cute .....  lol get her attentiion dude ...   do wuteva u can u need to be on her mind only u !!!!  valentimes day ... oooh perfect timing huh ?  scerate admirer will get her mind off of all the guys and start wonderin who it is   if she figures out that its u tell her and ext. go on from there   it wont hurt unless u give it a shot u have to get her attention

Qr0pld2kaa	E' un  periodo, l'hai detto tu stessa. Passer. Tu devi farti forza, devi volere con tutto il cuore che questo periodo finisca. La tentazione  grande, in un certo senso  bello lasciarsi andare e non reagire, succede anche a me tante volte.  Hai detto che hai pochi amici, ma veri (Sempre meglio di tanti amici falsi)fatti aiutare da loro (se sono amici veri non rompi, stanne certa). Per quanto riguarda la scuola puoi studiare con loro, farti aiutare.  Non affezionarti da subito alle persone,  sbagliatissimo. Trattieniti dal farlo, ci rimani solo male se le persone in questione non sono degne di fiducia. Aspetta un po', cerca di conoscerle. Aspetta che quelle persone si affezionino a te. Tu potrai ricambiare il loro affetto.  Poi fregatene di quello stronzo che non aveva di meglio da fare! Ce ne sono tanti di ragazzi a questo mondo, sicuramente qualcuno che ti dar il rispetto che meriti e che sapr volerti davvero bene c'.  Le delusioni servono a renderti forte. Dopo questo brutto periodo ti sentirai rinata, energica come una leonessa, rinvigorita, galvanizzata. Ti ci vuole una spintarella. Un po' di buona volont pu bastare, oppure una mano dai tuoi amici! Confidati con loro. Il loro sincero affetto cambier un po' le cose.  Spero di esserti stata d'aiuto. ^^|`|m87wSLbLaa	Se fosse capitato anche a me ti direi le solite frasi banali, tipo "passer", "queste cose capitano a tutti". La verit  invece che  ognuno vive una delusione a modo proprio. Io ti consiglio di smare prima di tutto te stessa, solo cos potrai focalizzare l'attenzione su cosa  bene per te. Non cercare di capire gli altri, non ne vieni pi fuori. Impara a gestire le tue sofferenze e se da sola pensi di non riuscirci, parlane anche con uno psicologo. Il primo passo verso la guarigione  ammettere di avere un problema e questo non significa necessariamente essere depressi. Gli amici servono, ma soprattutto in questa fase ti serve un gruppo con cui distrarti, per liberar la mente dai brutti pensieri. Adesso s che posso dirti... sono sicura che ce la farai. In bocca al lupo.|`|moeCUWtWaa	solo dopo aver toccato il fondo si riesce a risalire...  non ti preoccupare... tutto passa...   successo tante volte anche a me...  a volte non ce n' una che te ne va bane...  ma arriver il momento che ci riderai sopra...  e credimi... quel momento arriva proprio quando meno te l'aspetti!!   ti sei concessa ad uno... che ti frega... ti sei divertita...! magari la prossima volta ci penserai 2 volte... ma non  la fine del mondo!!!|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	vai a scuola, immagino tu sia giovanissima...l'unica cosa che puoi fare  non abbaterti troppo e aspettare che questo momento passi da solo, questi momenti negativi capitano a tutti.

It is so hard to get guys presents, especially if you just started dating.  If I were you though, I'd try to get something small in size, small in price ($20-$60), but thoughtful and then pairing it with an appropriate birthday card.    I'd avoid giving something unmeaningful just because you think it might be useful, like some plain t shirts or a mens bath/shower kit or worse, boxers.  And avoid getting something expensive that you'd think he might like, because it might scare him away, and you don't want to take that chance if you like him.    I recommend paying attention to what he likes, what his hobbies are.  At the beginning of a relationship, keep things simple.  I think a good gift would be a special edition CD of his favourite artist, his favourite movie in DVD, a candy or chocolate that he likes in a limited edition flavour (strawberry flavoured Kit Kat bars), if he likes to draw - artist pencils, if he likes to go fishing - fishing bait, if he likes to go camping - a swiss army knife, if he likes cars - a new shift knob (make sure it fits), if he complains about his crappy mouse/earphones/remote control - get him a new one.    Keep it small, keep it simple, keep it inexpensive.  Good luck!|`|rxT7SlVUaa	check with friends of his for ideas..|`|mIPNAzFvaa	Well if you two are really close then you could always do this: Go to his house then call him, tell him to look outside; then there you are with a ribbon on your head and say I'm your present =) haha. but if thats to extreme or too big of a step you could always do something simple like make a CD for him something handmade. sorry but that's all i can think of, good luck!|`|WbXGdOskaa	just get him a card and a little 'cute pressie' - nothing too big / extravagent|`|dQNQwJcAaa	Some cherries!|`|RPD6aBVJaa	Does he like sports or music?

I bet that will make him the happiest guy in the world.|`|S4pwP3Nkaa	Get him what he like and if he ain't one of them city boys then get him some mossey oak camouflage, you can't go wrong w/ that.

Your behaviour is the paramount factor when it comes to having a relationship with a guy.    A better way to get a boyfriend is to take some time to find a guy is right for you. Its rarely easy to just 'pickup a date' at some party or meeting.   Start with a person you might already know, or is easy for you to get along with. It is alot easier to have a relationship with a friend (or someone closer than that stranger you saw last week) and it is more likely that you both share the same interests.|`|69f03476c09281fa20b0bf2a23ec61acaa	email me   randy_014@yahoo.com   too much to type|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	be yourself, believe in yourself, and ignore him!!!  next week he will be begging for you to call him!!!!!!!!|`|Ji3ohP30aa	excusme......boys...always not lik beautiful nd hot nd sexy kinda galz.....c just have confidence.....if you lik sum 1 go nd tlk to him...not lik showing your assests...or something dirty....just look decent nd good...nd if you want yourself to lik hot..thn just follow da latest fashion...nd just go toa saloon nd make a newhairstyle.......|`|Tt6ZlxKNaa	be a nice girl cute kind of play hard to get not desperate at all somewhat of a body|`|PMq4rpW8aa	lots and lots with details ,then you need to hire some one , just be yourself , do not act , be normal and thats all i can say .|`|c7gMmRJDaa	Guys like hot girls and beautiful girls.

I personally like, confidence, and ambition in my girls. Ambition as in she has a plan and wants to make something out of herself, and wont let anything get in the way of it. Looks help, but if you have the first 2, you will get the right guy and not some asshole who wants to use you.|`|K0xnjOezaa	I hate saying this, but I'm gonna give you the reality. To make yourself "apealing" most guys have been socialized to want a slim girl with big breasts and round butt. There's the simple shallow truth.    BUT, to go a little more deeper, guys like girls who go with the flow. Doesn't complain or fuss. If we're watching a sports game, we really love girls who will watch with us or let us have our time with the game without giving us a guilt trip. Or if we go out to eat, someone who isn't picky won't complain, we like that. Also, we like a girl who are confident and secure. We don't like it when girls are always trying to get us to say how beautiful and great you are (ex. omg i don't like my hair, its sooo ugly!), we wanna say nice things to you on our own.

m26sYlLjaa	Firstly, thanks for the term "menage a tois"; I didn't know that there was a term for a "threesome". You earn a star from me, for my learning of a new word/term as well as for the good and thought-provoking question that you've asked.    Well, to answer your question; I have, always, all along belived that sex is best when it is between one man and one woman, and heavenly when the man and the woman are in love with each other.     However, the thought of a "threesome" evokes mixed feelings.. I'm sure it evokes similarly mixed feelings in other people's minds as well. To my mind, how easily one accepts/adjusts to the idea of a "threesome" is largely dependent on how sexually liberated one is (in thoughts and actions). For some (and many) people, sex is an expression of affection, intimacy, and love, and I might regret to say, here, that not too many people in the world are sexually liberated enough..! In the same way, there is nothing like "enough sex" for the moment/day/week.    Yes, the whole idea of a "threesome" is hugely enticing, teasing, appealing, and is almost irrestible at times. Yet, at the same time, it also depends on which side of the bathroom door one finds oneself in. For example, are you the "outsider/guest" or in the "relationship" and are seeking an "outsider/guest"?     Again, there are questions like: One woman and two men, or two women and one man? What do you want? Which is better/obvious?    Plus, there are other highly delicate issues that are just as sensitive as they can ever be: Who gets more attention? Who touches what/where, and first? Who gets to insert first (assuming there are two men and one woman)? How to maintain equality and fairness to the two members of the same sex by the opposite gender? You obviously cannot set ground rules that one of the man can only touch you below the navel while the other feels you above the navel region, or things like/similar to that, can you?     So, what/how do you set ground rules? It is difficult, perhaps! But, yes, highly tempting!! Note that, I am not against the idea/concept/thought of a "threesome"; just that, I find that one cannot set ground rules on the act of love-making/sexual act in the case of a threesome. There can be ground rules on the confidentiality aspect, and such, obviously; but, there obviously cannot be ground rules on how one should act/behave during the act. I hope you understand what I am trying to convey..    To answer the third part of your question: how does one choose/select the "outsider"? To my mind, a friend/acquaintance may not be a bad idea, in lieu of a complete stranger/escort. The reasons are obvious: you aren't sure of the sexual history/background of the stranger/escort. The stranger/escort may be the sexiest man in sight, but you wouldn't be knowing how good/bad he possibly could be, as a person (of being trustworthy) as well as his sexual background (in terms of contracted diseases). That certainly doesn't mean that the "threesome" is better with a friend/acquaintance as an "outsider" and less so with a stranger/escort; it might, for all the reasons, even be the contrary, but the risks associated with a stranger/escort are higher.     Are you contemplating a "threesome"? What are your thoughts on setting the "ground rules"?|`|3f1563d7674a7b9619e6194de22fc1d9aa	first ... its called "mnage  trois"..     second ...a relationship is supposed to be something special between two people.... so i dont ever see how i can like a girl and allow another guy to be in there with us sharing her with me....or how i would respect her and get another girl to be with us......  if she liked or respected me she wouldnt allow it either....      thats if ur in a relationship..... if its just casual sex..... then...do whatever would float your boat...    i wouldnt consider it myself....    it will make the relationship seem shallow and cheap....|`|VzhJsEUDaa	My wife and have been together 13 years. This is something that came up several years ago involving a close friend(female). We did go through it. That ended shortly after because of the fallout. However, it opened a door in our marriage that has been wonderful and challenging. We even had a live-in girlfriend for about a year and a half.   It WILL affect your relationship. Whether the effect is good or bad depends on you and your partner,and the strength of the relationship.|`|uXOhQidGaa	Ground rules are always necessary whenever straying from the beaten path. That is basic safe sex stuff. When you are in a traditional relationship, everyone knows, if not exactly where you are, then at least where the road is, because society and convention have a significant role in defining that relationship.    Ground rules are necessary in any nontraditional sexual/romantic relationship because there are fewer or no conventions to follow. You must decide what is allowed/forbidden in bed, whether it's a one night stand or could happen again, and whether it's just sex or you're adding this person to your relationship.    A friend is good, because you know where they've been; an escort has the advantage that s/he's a professional and won't freak out or get clingy, and someone you just met has the advantage of not having a history with you. Do whatever seems most pleasurable to you.    Yes, it will affect the relationship, but how it does is up to you. It can make your life richer or f*ck it up. That's why you have to have open communication, and make sure it's a turn on for everyone.|`|PrTqXaUjaa	been there.  done that.  usually a friend  of his.  it can hurt a bit if it seems that the other woman is getting more attention, but it never had a negative affect on the relationships.    i would rather be the guest and i would prefer that the woman approached me.  its a bigger turn on.|`|1bR8y8CRaa	i want to keep my boyfriend all to myself, and i dont know if that would change..|`|KvzuTfX7aa	Its ok, as long as it remains a sex thing.  I'd love to be the guest star, if I could find 2 bi women!|`|TSzfrDMZaa	Yes I have done this - both as the extra guy - and with an extra guy or woman with my woman.  I have also been in many foursomes.    When with couples - we usually had the groundrule that we didn't have intercourse with the other person - just play around orally and touching.    When with another guy - sometimes she would only give him oral and let him play with her orally and touching.  Sometimes he would have sex with her - depends.  With another woman - usually I just played with her touching and orally - but on occasion had sex with her.  It's harder for a guy to have sex with two women - because he can't come as often or as readily as a woman.  And you should save yourself for your partner, primarily.    If you are doing it - you should make rules ahead of time - and not break them in the heat of passion.  It should be about you as a couple - not about the other person.    I would never pay a professional for this - just seems unseemly to me.    If you are both on the same page - both unselfish and both not jealous - then it can be a great enhancement to a sexual relationship.  If not - it can cause trouble.    Make sure you are both ready to do it - and to not do it if the other is uncomfortable.|`|H6fHcXN8aa	Never in a million years would I think that is okay! I mean if three people have no emotional attachment and they are just having fun...well it's their body as long as they know the consequences. But in a relationship??? NOPE! If my boyfriend and I decided to find another partner for a threesome..I think we have gone insane! Sex is meant for two people who are deeply in love! I don't get why people have to even do threesomes. Maybe adventure and spontaneity are missing in their lives...but my bf and I will have sex and it will only be the two of us. If we did have a threesome then our relationship will definitely change. Besides we discussed this a long time ago and none of us want to ever do it with another person. IT's disgusting to the both of us. We want to only touch each other..not another "guest." I think this whole thing is kind of stupid but I hope I answered your questions.|`|AA11827424	Absolutely, definitely NOT.    I've never seen such arrangements last for long. Sooner or later, the attachment gets more serious on one side, and the proverbial hits the fan.

9H6mCZE2aa	So your friend said that his GF doesn't even like him? Then why is she with him? You have to consider if what she's saying is the truth. You don't want to jump in and then ruin your friendship with his GF. That could make things sloppy and he could resent you for that.    If you think he likes you, you should just sit down and have a conversation friend to friend. Don't make it seem like you're trying to be with him. It'll be a desperate cry for a relationship and he'll read into that. Just say, "I heard that you liked me from a few people and I just wanted to clarify that because your GF is a friend of mine. I don't want her getting hurt. So let's just clarify things." Talk about it. Then you talk to the GF and see if what was said was true.    This is a good way to avoid getting a fat lip, some hair pulled, or some clothes ripped. You don't ever want to lose friends if you can help it.    Talk it out!|`|a058927df39068adb68685b4fb859199aa	If you have to consider:  - Your friendship with the girlfriend than the possible boyfriend, which one is more worth while.  - I think you have to talk to both people and see what they think about it, so ask the boy how he thinks of you and her girlfriend and if there is anything serious there, and ask the girl how she feels about the boyfriend and how she would feel dating him.    Just be confident and truthful of what you say, hopefully they will understand and they should help you figure out what to do.|`|327W3UCvaa	if she doesnt like him, then it seems that it wont last long. Wait until they arent together, even then you risk hurting your friend, even though she didnt like him. Find someone else if you arent ruthless enough.|`|afZKsnqKaa	ha ha ha,in this situation u have to hurt to someones feelings to please yours.if u are to achieve your aim of snatching your girlfriends guy,u should be ready to break up with your girlfriend.  u liked this guy b4 he and your girlfriend started dating,what were u doing?watching?  u cant have this guy without hurting your friend,thats an undisputable fact.|`|48a36aa7379298b3843667848ed8d7e1aa	best case scenario is that u hook up with him, but maybe down the road it doesn't work out.  Now you have an ex bf and an ex best friend.    the choice should be easy....
20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	He needs to leave.   He has told you how he feels, and as hard as it is, as long as you let him stay, he will .  As long as you are still doing "wifely" things for him, he will let you.  Let him  be away from you,  let him miss you, he may decide that he was wrong and does care about you.   Problem is, he feels better for telling you how he feels right now, and you feel worse because of what he said.    I think as long as he is still living with you, he will stay confused.  You deserve to be happy and and should be with someone who appreciates you.|`|zRiJnXKnaa	Yes its normal to be confused. Confused is like saying uncertained....Maybe he feels that he doesn't love you but also see's the good in you being with him. So obviously even if he stays with you...it will just cause problems in your relationship in the long-run due to not only it lingering in the back of your mind that he told you he didn't love you but also the fact that he mentioned the D word. So, I would demand communication as to what he is really feeling and why? That way there will be some kind of closure on this Divorce topic. Its hard to play and move forward without the answers. Good luck~|`|AA10267496	Well a person can be confused for a long time. I would have to agree with the previous post. You cannot wait for him to determine what he wants. Take it from someone who knows. First be honest with him and give him the opportunity to stay. Tell him you want to be with him. If he still wants to do this then you have to let him go.|`|wq6uk2Braa	You have a child.  He does not want to be with you but cares about the child and he is confused.  Give him time and space.|`|AA11305351	I was confused for over a year after my ex left me, until one day I got my head on straight and realized that divorce was exactly what I wanted....so , sure, a person can be confused in matters of the heart for 3 weeks. I would hope he's weighing all the pros and cons, and will make the right decision. You also should be making some decisions of your own. Good Luck!|`|AA11570347	Yes, 3 weeks is still quite short to be completely sure about such a major decision.  Try to encourage some marriage counseling before going forward with divorce.  If I had to guess, he does really still love you but he's at his wits end about something.  Offer to be willing to help him figure out what's making him unhappy in your relationship.|`|n1AAHi5qaa	I am sure he can be confused for a long period of time.  Talk to him.  If he can't figure out what he wants, then you figure out what you want and then do it.  Life is too short to wait for someone to decided if they want to be with you or not.  I am sure there is someone out there that will want to be with you and won't be confused about it.
JbRTKDFmaa	Not weird or an idiot. You do what you like and there's nothin' wrong with that. No reason to get into a relationship if you don't want the hassle.|`|Y8VvjEMeaa	Maybe you should date guys!|`|AA11827424	You're just gay.|`|MHCaLtTZaa	This reminds me of the guy explaining how much dating sucks at the beginning of Wedding Crashers.|`|gZGUZ67Baa	yer not weird! and yer not an idiot either! yer actually smart for doin that! cuz,usually,it is a wait of time dating people. so,this will help you in tha long run.|`|wMLPBc9waa	Actually you're a weird idiot!

Poi come ti ho detto laltra volta..se devi ricominciare con la modella devi partire dal presupposto che il passato  passatosi..ok..la 15nne non ha preteso quando era sparita ma ormai basta guardare al passato!!!!!se vuoi stare con la modella pensate solo al futuro ..  Sinceramente la modella che viene a sapere che tu sei indeciso e lei che ti dice che ti aspetter..boh un atteggiamento che non mi so spiegare nel senso che si vede che  molto innamoratama  del tutto strano--- se fossi in lei io non potrei stare con una persona indecisache deve scegliere perch questo tuo fatto di scegliere mi farebbe capire molte cose..ovvero che tu non sei innamorato di nessuna delle 2ricorda che  impossibile provare le stesse cose per 2 personee te lo dimostra il fatto che cmq ti offrono cose diverseun altro motivo per cui tu non sei innamorato  che in loro non guardi ai sentimentima stai pensando al futuro che potrebbero dartinon puoi essere innamorato di nessuna anche perch se ti rendi conto in qualche modo una ti piace per come  fuori..laltra per come  dentro.invecequando ti innamorerai la persona che ami (che  una cosa diversa dallattrazione che tu vivi ora!!) sar completa..cio.. per te sar  il massimoti interesser per come  in tutti i sensie soprattutto per i sentimenti che prova per te e riesce a fare provare a TE.  Sai..mi sembri quasi estraneo ad entrambi i rapporticome una scelta che non ti riguarda prettamente..il che mi porta a dirti che non ci sono TUOI sentimenti per nessuna delle dueti interessano soltanto..il ceh  diverso.  Oravedi tuvuoi stare con qualcuna per il fatto che LEI ti ama ( mi riferisco alla modella) ?

Secondo me, valuta bene prima di decidere, perch non  detto che la maggiorenne sia quella giusta per te, anche se ha soldi ed  bella...... Nel giorno d'oggi anche le 15enni sono mature!! :O)!! e non bisogna solo giudicare dai soldi e dalla bellezza, perch una raga pu essere cos, ma all'interno non ha nulla!!|`|uBbQSGWHaa	secondo me dovresti lasciar perdere tutte e due.hai gi individuato delle cose che non ti piacciono di entrambe e quindi credo dovresti rischiare, lasciarle perdere e sperare di trovarne una terza che ti ponga questi problemi.  non perdere tempo a decidere se no saranno loro a decidere per te.|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	sei tu che ragioni male. aspetta di crescere e capire quello che vuoi prima di far soffrire una (e pi) ragazze. ts!|`|Al1DoF3Vaa	tony..la cosa migliore e' ne una ne l'altra per adesso.devi prima fare il punto...lavora su te stesso..su quello che provi..metti tutto sulla bilancia riflettendoci sopra con serenita'..quando avrai capito cosa realmente vuoi indipendentemente da loro due..puoi scegliere..e pottrebbe anche capitare che nessuna delle due siano quello che vuoi..un bacio|`|1s8vCttvaa	sei decisamente un bel Mandrillo ma certe scelte sono solo individualii perch non hai chiesto a qualcuno il parere prima di andare co n la ex ti avrei risposto dilasciar perdere.  ma nonmi avresti dato ascolto ora son caxxi tui. la bimbetta per non l a sciupare troppo lei crede in te. rilego la dmd e.. hai troppe ex fra le mani devi scegliere un p definitivamente se no non cresci.|`|XDJ0g8uxaa	Con un ragionamento del genere spero tanto che tu non scelga mai me...che sono bella fuori, bella dentro, e ho la grana!

Non sono andata via per non metterla in imbarazzo, ma quella sera nel lettone non ho chiuso occhio...per me era come se l ci fosse stato un uomo. comunque siamo rimaste amiche tranquillamente finch si  trasferita all'estero|`|Lj21YYt2aa	ti senti lusingato dipende dalla bellezza del gay ovviamente|`|2d5a9c2b0e43310700420e75d8a2f7c6aa	Io penso che un ragazzo rimanga + infastidito di una ragazza...i ragazzi quando non sono gay stanno molto attenti a non parlare di quell'argomento e badano bene di stare alla larga da un gay per probabilit che ci provi (in linea generale intendo)! Infatti quando un ragazzo vuole deridere l'amico x qualcosa lo chiama in termini dispregiativi x riferirsi ad un gay (cosa che a me d molto fastidio peraltro). Se una ragazza ci provasse con me rimarrei un attimo disorientata e perplessa, per mi farebbe anche piacere!

5oxtLqFpaa	premetto che ho 22 anni.  sinceramente fai bene a fare questa domanda e, per quanto mrs satana si sia ribellata, ha 13 anni ed a quanto pare ancora capisce certe cose, ritengo che sia una domanda degna di nota (e quindi stella), poi sempre per continuare rivolta a mrs satana (scusa ma oggi ce l'ho con te), ti volevo solo dire che:  hai 13 anni, fai la tredicenne, questa  una chat in cui si discute anche di problemi di vita reale, questo  un padre che ha un problema con la figlia minorenne e non si dovrebbe intromettere nella sua vita????? guarda che finch non compi 18 anni ne rispondono i tuoi genitori delle c.a.z.z.a.t.e che fai, quindi prima di aprire bocca (anzi di muovere le mani) connetti il cervello ed impara un p di congiuntivi.    conclusa la breve parentesi.    per risponderti ti posso dire che anche io a 13 anni ero ribelle, uscivo con gente di 25 e tornavo a casa con un sorriso a 50 denti, non era successo nulla per semplicemente ero contenta (sono stata troppo matura e responsabile anche a 13 anni).  le ragazzine di adesso sono diverse, vanno in giro con minigonne, perdono la verginit troppo presto per capirne il valore, io non dico di aspettare il matrimonio, ma almeno potrebbero aspettare di capire davvero il significato dell'amore, quello fatto anche di problemi e non solo di gioie, (e per problemi non intendo "lui che fa uno squillo alla ex").    detto ci io inizierei un attimo a mettere i paraocchi a tua figlia, nel senso che, inizierei un attimo a farle vivere la sua et, c.a.z.z.o a 13 anni giocavamo con le bambole e il sesso manco sapevamo cosa potesse essere!!!!  io ci parlerei, per quanto so che  una cosa inutile, e le metterei le cose in chiaro, vuoi fare la grande??? ok la farai per ti prendi anche le tue responsabilit, vuoi fare sesso con il tuo ragazzo??? ti trovi un lavoro per mantenerti te, il tuo ragazzo ed ipotetici figli!!  mia mamma cos mi ha cresciuta, sinceramente la mia prima volta  stata a 19 anni e ne sono entusiasta!!!!   bello essere piccoli e fare i grandi quando alle spalle hai pap.  sono tutte cose difficili da far capire ad una tredicenne, per secondo me un p di disciplina ci vuole.  non bisogna essere troppo permissivi per essere amati dai figli.....  a quella festa pu essere successo tutto come pu essere successo niente, ma almeno ti ha dato uno spunto per risolvere un problema che, se non si  gia presentato, si presenter presto!!!|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	temo sia cresciuta troppo in fretta....stalle vicino, se vuole fare la "donna" falle capire che non vuol dire andare solo alle feste e sbaciucchiarsi.

No importa q tan bonita sea o como es su cuerpo, lo mas importante y q deberias de valorar mas es la manera en la q se comporta contigo, si realmente te respeta y te quiere y no como se ve, ni las sensaciones q su cuerpo te hacen sentir. Talvez pienses q si la dejas te vas a volver loco pero la verdad es q todo en la vida pasa y si una persona te lleva a sentir tanta rabia, tristeza y desesperacion es porque no te quieren y tu confundes esos malos sentimientos con amor. Ten valor y mandala a volar, si ella es capaz de tener tan malos sentimientos y sobre todo de no importarle si lastima a una persona es claro q ella no es un buen ser humano.

Lo mejor es que hables con el platiquen acerca de lo que sucedio y despues ir con un especialista para que los ayude y que esto suceda lo menos posible: Es importante recodar que Por el tipo de sociedad en el que nos manejamos se le da mucha importancia a la duracion sexual del hombre.

WqK0oTgBaa	Sin duda que cuando los padres optan por el rompimiento legal, es porque no encontraron al travs de los meses el rescate de la relacin afectiva que dio origen a su relacin.    En algunos casos, la determinacin de hacerlo, aunque dura, es la mejor decisin ante lo que postre y de no hacerlo, se convierte en una tortuosa relacin que no lleva a nada sino a afectar an mas a los hijos.    No olvides que los que se divorcian, son los padres, no los hijos. Tus padres sern por siempre tus padres a los que les debes ante todo respeto. Te sugiero hables con ellos y externes tu sentir, si bien no frenar su determinacin, te ayudar a desahogar tus emociones.    Luego vendr la etapa de "duelo", los cambios, la afliccin ante las ausencias, ms de forma paulatina habrs de irlo superando. Acaso te agradara que ellos sostengan una relacin que se ha quebrado ?? no crees que cada uno debe de tomar su camino, claro est sin que olviden que son padres ??    Te exhorto a hacer acopio de fuerzas y lo hables con ellos... no los juzges que solo ellos saben las razones que les llevan a tal decisin, pero es importante que te escuchen y ms an que te comprendan.

Si tus padres siguen casados las cosas pueden llegar a tal grado que tu mismo vas a desear que se separen.   Los problemas son de ellos y ellos tienen que resolverlos, tu no debes tomar partido por ninguno, trata de convivir con ambos lo mas que puedas pero no intervengas en sus problemas.  Se van a divorciar ellos y a ti te seguiran amando, de eso puedes estar completamente seguro.

Es normal que dos personas se dejen de querer. Pero si tu los amas, diles lo importante que son ambos para ti y que necesitas su atencion, especificamente a tu edad.

Primero que nada, llora, desahogate,. busca una buena amiga con quien platicar de como te sientes, sacalo todo, veras que vas a sentirte un poquito mas calmada, una vez que pase esto, piensa muy seriamente acerca de la relacion de tus padres, probablemente esta ya se encontraba deteriuorada, piensa que tambien es muy dificil para una pareja tomar la decision de divorciarse y probablemente ellos tambien la estan pasando mal, yo te aconsejaria que les escribieras una carta comentandoles lo que sientes y tambien haciendoles saber que cuentan contigo, y que los amas, es muy importante que lo sepan, puesto que con el divorcio suelen hacerse divisiones y algunas veces los hijos toman partidos, no lo hagas, amalos a los dos por igual y apoyalos, veras que con el tiempo las cosas comenzaran a verse mejor y probablemente logren una mejor convivencia separados que viviendo juntos, lo mas seguro es que hayan llegado ya a un punto en el que no pueden tolerar vivir en la misma casa, respeta su decision, y apoyalos, veras que todo se resolvera para bien. Un abrazo y suerte !|`|RVNI51p6aa	Bueno,mis padres se divorciaron estaba yo muy chik,me costo aceptarlo hasta hace poco que perdone a mi padre por su abandono.Debe ser fatal a tu edad pero debes comprender lo mal que quizas se la estaban llevando sus padres,ellos estan vivos los dos ,no lo veas como que los a pardido aun pueden compartir ahora quizas mas de lo normal que lo hacian,Dios es quien te puede dar esa serenidad que tanto necesaitas en este momento,le voy a pedir a Dios por ti,me impacto bastante,una vez lo vivi,y mi hijo tambien le toco vivirlo,pero le dije que si no las estabamos llevando muy mal su papa y yo era mejor separanos y lo entendio,tienes que estar tranquila quizas ellos la esten pasando bien mal,por que la separacion para nosotros tampoco es facil,si ayudas un poquito a tus padres te sentiras mejor,y si te pasara mas facil cuando te sientas util.. Cuidate mucho..Dios te bendiga...Y sigue adelante siempre..|`|rcpKwQYxaa	hola    pues lo mejor  aqui es no tratar de interbenir en los asuntos de ellos pero si podrias hacer algo es decirle al qe tu crees  qe mas o menos tiene la culpa y decirlew cuanto lo estra?aria si se fueran  espero averte ayudado|`|maGN27Skaa	Entiendo por lo que estas pasando y se que es dura la decisin de tus padres. Pero piensa de esta manera, si ellos se llevan mal, no te hace bien verlos as. Ellos son una pareja lo cual no significa que por esta decisin dejen de ser tus padres. Lo sern toda la vida.

Arriba ese animo lo principal es que los tienes.|`|1f20f13afffbb0a6e8da35372cabf24baa	Yo tambien senti eso, o sea se que duele que los padres se divorcien, pero tenes que ver su lado de las cosas, el amor algun dai se acaba, y si no elegiste al compa?ero correcto, o compa?era, habra mucho dolor y se lastimarian entre si ademas de ustedes,  no se ayudara esto, pero es mi pensamiento sobre una situacion, se que duele, pero el dolor se ira con el tiempo, ademas, si bien es algo muy malo, ahora lo ves negro por le impacto, poco a poco veras que todo mejorara, llora, porque eso te ahra bien, llorar son palabras no dichas y eso te ayudara a descargarte , de ahcer no se puede ahcer nada si? solo esperar, nada mas, sufre con tranqulidad, suena estupido pero no hay que desesperarse en estos casos, mira el futuro con esperanza. Espero haberte servido de algo perdona si te heri en algo que dije, pero no siempre es todo sufrir ok?|`|08f419be1a1233a9ba5740843cb08c2aaa	Hola!!

Antes del siglo XIX la restriccin alimentaria estaba directamente relacionada con tabes alimentarios y practicas religiosas o expiatorias, fue a partir de la desacralizacin de la medicina y la introduccin del pensamiento cientfico cuando se empez a considerar como una enfermedad. En 1873 Lasegue en Francia y poco despus Gull en Londres hicieron los primeros diagnsticos de Anorexia Nerviosa, considerndola como un estado de nimo patolgico de orden psicolgico.       Respecto a la Bulmia Nerviosa era tambin conocida desde la antigedad, as como tambin el vomitar despus de ingestas copiosas; en 1885 James describe tres tipos de bulimia: de hambre pura, la asociada con desvanecimientos, y la que finaliza con vmitos.  La bulimia como alguna forma de voracidad impulsiva y narctica fue descrita recin al final del siglo XIX como un trastorno mas del apetito junto con la pica. Durante las tres primeras dcadas de este siglo se encuentran varias referencias a la enfermedad pero en 1932 Wulf hace la 1a descripcin de bulimia nerviosa, la asociacin con otro tipo de adicciones y alteraciones cognitivas con relacin al peso y esquema corporal. Eva ha sido lista en 1981 cuando se ha observado un claro aumento de la incidencia de este trastorno y la consecuencia de este trastorno y la consecuente preocupacin de la comunidad medica, por ello el culto a la perfeccin impera en nuestra sociedad creando verdaderas adicciones al consumo de todos los productos, relacionadas con la belleza, con el nico propsito de encontrar eso que llamamos justificacin personal y reconocimiento de los otros. Muchas revistas que encontramos en los quioscos hacen referencia a las ultimas tendencias de moda, cosmtica, etc.  Dando a entender que triunfar en la vida puede ser posible gracias al culto del cuerpo. Todo ello fomenta el aumento del trastoco desarrollndose en una franja de edad cada vez ms amplia.  Por todo esto consideramos necesario la apertura de centros especializados para poder tratar de forma especifica estos trastornos.    El hospital de da LABOR-NEPP, trabaja con un abordaje bio-psico-social por lo que tiene un equipo multidisciplinar compuesto por psiquiatras, mdicos y psiclogos que consideran al paciente desde una perspectiva muy amplia, con asistencia individual y de grupo.

Poi potreste provare per qualche settimana (cosi' provate anche la quaotidianita' e non solo il fine settimana), se vedi che le cose funzionano allora potete prendere una decisione piu' definitiva.

If you think your being this way or your partner is then trust your gut insticts.  However every relationship has different communication levels and everyone has different personalities than others obviously so some would find it annoying and a turn off wheer as others would love it. So it depends on the individual and so try slyly asking them and say you want them to be truthful because you dont want to jeodardise the relationship and really want it to work -on terms that both of you are comfortable and happy with.  For me personally I would say more than three is a bit mcuh but sometimes they may need to call you other than for a social call to ask sometihng etc so I wouldnt count that as long as it wasnt asking what into so muh detail like what am I doing right now, who am I with, what am I wearing, what time will I be home etc etc.If it is just to check p then unfortunately even if with good intention many would think it was being obsessive and controlling and a negative because relationships are more ful of freedom and trust nowadays between both sexes being equal and so unlike older times when the man was said to have every right to know whee what when how his woman was etc with no come back from her, now everything is diferent and it is seen as control.  Good luck.

I don't ring him that much - there is usually a purpose to my phone calls. I certainly would not ring him more than twice a week, he does all the ringing...AND WE LIVE TOGETHER!  I think more than twice a day is too much; maybe I'm hard, but people don't need to live in each other's ear do they?
5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	He's feeling hunted.  Backtrack a little, stop the pressure.  Do you love your husband?  If so, perhaps you should find out why he is so tired.  He might be suffering from dperession or genuinely overworked.  In which case, allow him a half hour rest when he gets home.  My husband does this every day - and when he wakes up, he's ready for his "night shift" as he puts it.  (Accounting, studying, watching tv, and yes, coming to bed.)  Children thrive in a household where there is a loving mother and father - it is far better for them than the uncertain future you are searching for.  You're after better and more sex - that doesn't go hand in hand with being a loving father.  So try the coffee trick - when yourhusband comes home, make him a cup of coffee - not decaff! - and send him to the bedroom.  The caffeine takes twenty minutes to take effect - just enough time to snooze, recharge and wake up.  Hope it works for you.|`|JiKWi3R1aa	go to marriage counceling,try to make it work some how before you make one of the biggest decions of your life,you don't want to regret it for the sake of yourself but most important your child..if you both give it your best but still don't make it work then its time to move on & if you give it your best but your husband doesn't try at all,then its definately time to move on..but for now just try & make it work,8yrs is a long time to give up & its only worth giving up if youve both really given up on your relationship!|`|PeUwTTDaaa	if you are still happy together, ask for an open marriage to get sex from someone else... :D|`|29de67f94c5490271c7a3619e58bf1d5aa	You have a decesion to make.

I noticed you didn't say you suspect he's having an affair.  To be optimistic, let me share something with you.  I know of a 34 year old male who was having issues in his marriage concerning a total lack of sexual drive.  He had his hormones checked and found he was at the lowest level for his age.  He is now taking testosterone shots, etc. and things are beginning to level out and are definitely picking back up for him and his wife.  I don't know if this could be the problem, but I thought I would share this with you.  If he is loving and caring there may be a medical issue.  Unless there is no love, he is wanting out of the marriage or is having an affair, I say separation is the wrong answer.  I feel that should be your last resort.  I do hope for you, your husband and your child, you are able to work through this.|`|AA11827424	You said you have talked to him, so what did he say?

People don't always have to have intercourse to get off. Ask him to cuddle with you or just lie in bed with you while you satisfy yourself. You never know, it could be fun.|`|0q9FCY1kaa	every married women should be entitled to a fulfilling sex life. in this situation i can think of very little justifiable positions to explain away ur husband's lack of passion for sex. it cannot be sexual impotence or inadequacy because as u said it was steaming hot before. it cannot be pressures of life from work or finance because if it was, such disinterest for sex would be for a period and no more. that leaves me with 2 conclusions.    1. you hv neglected yourself so much and the perceived deterioration of your physical attractiveness has made him lose interest in you. still you cannot even remotely be blamed for such a situation. he should've told u about this and ur affirmation that you hv made all different efforts to improve the conditions show that you are aware of what you must do to keep his interest.    unfortunate as it may seem i hv no choice but the come to the final conclusion that he has another woman outside who is showering him with so much affection and sexual activity that he has no means left to do it at home. sad but it looks like it is that way.    you will hv to summon up the courage to confront him if you want to keep the marriage you must prepare yourself for his likely admission that there is another woman outside. he may deny, call you crazy, question your motives, make a big scene out of the whole situation but you will have to stay strong throughout the process. don't show your weakness by breaking down and crying and dont show your emotional susceptibility by losing control and getting worked up. if you want him enough, you must be prepared to make and stand and win him back and this can only be done if you attempt to make it better and to affirm that you will be better.    it is so unfair sometimes we think that the grieved party is the one who must make concessions. when you feel this way remember that there have been  many other occassions in other aspects of life that he could hv been a grieved party too. the only way to heal such a crisis is to extent the power of forgiveness into the relationship.|`|Dcz5dFnbaa	When men say they are too tired for sex, you can be positive something else is an underlying issue. But the good news is that you can figure it out and make your marraige stronger at the same time!    So, your hubby is too "tired" after work... surprise him by setting the alarm thirty minutes early and having sex in the morning. This would definately wake him up, give him more energy for the day, and add spice to the relationship when you give him something unexpected.    If he refuses your morning advances, then wait until that night to talk to him about it. You don't want to start your day off bad by arguing first thing. When he gets home and gets relaxed, just look him in the eyes and ask if he really loves you. Does he still find you attractive? If the answers are genuinely yes, and he insists that he's just too tired to make love to you, then ask if he'd be willing to get a doctors appointment to find out about an underlying medical cause that would deplete his sex drive.     Tell him how important sexual intimacy is with him for your needs. If he really cares about your legitimate needs, he'll take action to get help and get back on track!    Good luck!|`|wwHDaGzdaa	I am thinking that this is just a part of being married. Especially if you are not as good as your spouses past lovers. Take care or your physical needs while he is in the shower and then stop looking to him to satisfy you in that area.

But you know - reading questions such as this - it just feels as if you - generally - not just you - want it all.  You want cake, be able to eat it and not have anyone complain.  Everyone should be able to have what they want and everyone else just accept it without reservation.  Well, life isnt like that.  The chap that thinks you fancy him without realising you fancy his friend - get over the fact that if you go out with the friend he probably wont want to speak to you - its a male pride thing and actually, quite understandable.  Your girlfriend fancies the same man - this will - without doubt - cause friction if one or the other of you gets him.  Thats nature and life.  So - go for the man you fancy, and be prepared for the other one to be pretty miffed.  And be prepared for the other girl to be pretty much the same.  This isnt rocket science!

But of course only if she likes them, has the proper situation to care for one, and it is okay with everyone in the house.|`|ch7l0pDjaa	sweet way: stick it into a cookie.  bahaha.  take her to her favorite place.  or where you first met.   or do a fuuun activity and ask her in the middle of it, randomly. :D|`|EY0wnkh3aa	be like "yo baby let's get hitched." lol jk idk do something sweet.|`|joxz5bxSaa	well ask her parents first!  then lets say you guys are somewhere that means alot to both of you. or where you first met and then ask her there!|`|106e3e778c5efcc93bd6160b4540f5bdaa	It needs to be personal between you two. You need to be romantic. Be sure and get her parents permission first--parents love that!|`|FGR7j3Q8aa	go to a base ball game where it is on TV and have them put it on the screen for everyone to see. have them do the count down and we all can watch the  happy moment. and don't forget to have someone tape it. OR go to the mountains have a romantic time with whine and fire place and do it there in a cabin. cook her a nice steak dinner and stick it in her wine glass.|`|8eKplVJXaa	I would love to be preposed to in an air ballon in napa as the sun is settin...love the idea...if not napa in temecula...don't do it in a restaurant that is too cheesy! Be very sincere, look into her eyes, tell her atleast five little thins that you can't live without her or that you love about her. Share a funny moment that really brouht you two closer or the moment you realized she was the one. I think we all want to know what it was that made our husbands decide to marry us instead of all the other women out there. I wish you the best of luck and hope you will be the happiest man on earth. Love is awesome and you rock for askin for tips to make it special for her! Just don't take too lon otherwise she will take it personal and may move on to someone who is offerin it sooner.
ZPqDhHpyaa	I'm going through the exact same thing. I did everything for this boy and he up and left, taking my heart and most of my life away from me unfortunatly. It's been a week but it feels like a decade and it's not getting easier.    It's hard to listen to other people tell you that you deserve better and you should move on and find someone else, when your heart is so attached to that other- it's frustrating. If its able to be fixed and he's willing then try to talk it over, but if not give him space which is extremely hard and extremely hypocritical of me to say. What I like to put faith into is fate. I like the safety of knowing that if it's meant to be, then it will be- it takes a little bit of the stress out of my hands.    If we got along without them before, then we can do it again. In the meantime, I'm there with you so if you want a buddy- email me :). We can share stories and cry together, hehe.|`|Ao8c7F1baa	im not gonna lie. he sounds like kind of a jerk!! dont put up with that.maybe its time to move on to nicer guys!!|`|s5oZga2Baa	Why do you want somebody who doesn't want you. He is with somebody else he has moved on as you should do also.|`|lKpLsOcjaa	I would call you dumb too.  He lives off of you financial, emotionally, and probably sexually too.  You low self-esteem, as it seems would be perfect for anybody to take advantage of.|`|lxkt3LGOaa	well he broke up wid u so theres kinda nothing u can do but try to move on n get a guy who can actually help u n love u not u havin to take of him|`|NVSambhPaa	It doesn't sound like he really wants to work anything out. I think he is over it. And honey, believe me, it might be hard now but it will get better. You are young, get out there and party! There are plenty of other guys that are way better anyway!|`|842484b6464b5a7615cbfdd7b78e65e9aa	He is using you.  You are there for him financially and emotionally.  It should be the other way around he should be giving you money.|`|dFlofWQjaa	just end it!|`|6d7jqG11aa	you should tell him that you about him or those other girls he likes . I knew that you was cheating on me anyway  so i was cheating on you to. NOW WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7NRkZzmPaa	Well it seems like he's more into the "single" scene.  Being a big flirt & having girls call all the time.  You deserve better.  Someone who yes has girls who are friends, but not one who has girls calling that LIKE him.  You love him, so it'll be tough moving on.  But there is someone better out there.  The break up happened for a reason, and you were obviously bugged by the girls calling and stuff.  So it wasn't mean't to be.  Take time away from contact with him to think things over & get over him. Yes, its going to be hard.  But its life, we get put into these situations to learn from then to better out future.  Hope this helps!  Good luck :D|`|Molu004zaa	You can throw your all into a relationship, but it will NEVER work if the other partner isn't willing to work on it too. Just face it, if he's split up with you, it's OVER. You deserve better than a guy who flirts with every woman he sees for goodness sake :/ He was showing you NO respect! You were surviving before he came into your life and you can survive now that he's gone. Don't mope around for the rest of eternity trying to win him back; have some self-respect! There's better guys out there for you, trust me. Good luck!|`|5BOZ2ryLaa	Sweetie, you deserve better than you are asking for!  You are hurting over a loser who took money from you and flirted (and you know it went beyond flirting).      You shouldn't be wasting your time trying to make him happy.  You should be spending time with someone who does things that you are BOTH happy about.    You HAVE to move on, or you have to accept that he will treat you like a doormat.|`|xBvcejuTaa	It doesn't sound like you guys communicate very well. It's not that you're not good at letting go. You already did once. You obviously have strong feelings for the guy and really don't want to give him up though you say you would prefer to.  Your problem is in the communication department. That is where you need to make some improvements. You have articulated very well on Yahoo/Answers. Now you just have to tell him what you have told everyone here.|`|4SHr6i55aa	ok there is NOTHING you can do because he DOESN'T want to be with you. its sad and it hurts. it has happened to me MANY times. a relationship is about TWO people not one trying to make it work and the other one having a good time. i know what it feels like to give your all to a relationship i know that now you feel like you don't have friends or there is nothing to do. but give it time because it gets easier. find a hobby or reunite with old friends.. love was NOT meant to be easy..|`|106e3e778c5efcc93bd6160b4540f5bdaa	I know it hurts, but do you really want to be with someone that is ready to move on? And just because he broke up with you, doesn't mean that you have something wrong with you--it means that he is just ready to move on. I think you will be surprised when you find a boyfriend that doesn't use you for finances, and allows other girls to call them and flirt. You deserve so much more respect than what you are getting. It will hurt for a while, but soon, you will realize it was the best thing in the world to finally be free of him.
Pib6Fu3haa	Minha querida Luzimar, aconteceu esta situa??o comigo, e mostrei depois de uns anos, que a decis?o que tomei era a correta, nunca voltaria atrs, pois decis?es se tomam pela raz?o e nunca pelas emo??es. Um beijo.|`|D7sNY0OEaa	Primeiro eu iria falar  para eles o porque da minha decis?o,se a opini?o deles n?o mim convenceu,sigo em frente.|`|GVr7TE2Baa	Luzimar,    Pergunta complicada, amiga, pq depende de muitos fatores.    Se minha famlia toda fosse contra, certamente teria me dito antes de eu tomar a decis?o...e, levando em conta que nossa famlia  a nossa base, s quer o nosso bem, eu consideraria, com carinho, a opini?o dos meus familiares.    Porm, se aps refletir, eu continuasse achando que estava no caminho certo, n?o voltaria atrs, por causa da opini?o deles.    O mesmo vale para a decis?o j tomada : se eu estivesse feliz com minha escolha, com minha op??o, n?o desistiria apenas para agrad-los.    Acho importante levar em conta o que  determina??o e o que  teimosia. Tendo o discernimento entre esses dois conceitos, o importante  fazer o que se acha certo, e ter responsabilidade para colher os resultados, bons ou ruins.    .(`'?.?(`'?.? ?.?') ?.?')?.?') ?  ?`'?.?.... .?.?'?(?.?` * (?.?`.* ?

Eu acho que escutaria cada opini?o com carinho, mas n?o deixaria que me obrigassem a fazer ( ou n?o fazer) algo que eu n?o quisesse. Claro , n? Se eu tenho minha independncia, n?o dependo de ningum, quem tem o direito de se meter na minha vida? Isso vale tambm para os familiares. Pelo menos  assim na minha famlia, cada qual com a sua vida, no seu canto.|`|xoY8FOKmaa	Geralmente quando tomo uma decis?o,  porque tenho plena certeza do que estou fazendo.  Procuro antes pedir orienta??o da famlia, amigos, porque s?o pessoas que s querem o meu bem.  Analiso tudo, mas quem decide  o meu cora??o e s vezes a Raz?o tambm...  Resumindo...analiso por todos os angulos...e se mesmo assim eu resolver seguir a minha "intui??o"...estarei consciente de que, se eu errar, n?o poderei culpar ningum a n?o ser eu mesma.  Independente do resultado, o importante  tentar...o risco de errar  grande, mas voc s descobre depois que as coisas n?o saem do jeito que imaginava n?  Ningum consegue prever o resultado de uma atitude antes de tom-la...o importante  se perdoar e seguir em frente...de qualquer forma serviu como aprendizado...sempre  bom fazer, tentar...pior  ficar o resto da Vida pensando em "como poderia ter sido..."  V em frente... mais um aprendizado...s isso.  Tenho um texto pra voc. Espero que goste:    RASCUNHOS...     A Vida  um grande Livro.     s vezes ficamos estacionados numa pgina, escrevendo, rasgando o rascunho...escrevendo de novo.     Os pargrafos s?o o dia-a-dia.     Levamos muito tempo at virar a pgina, que s?o as fases que atravessamos...os relacionamentos.     Virar a pgina significa que estamos satisfeitos com o que escrevemos ou vivenciamos do nosso jeito.     Certo ou errado.   O importante  o que est "escrito".     N?o importa se foi uma experincia boa ou ruim, o que fizemos...  Cada pgina precisa ser "virada", para que outra possa ser escrita, ou "vivida".     Os captulos s?o a Adolescncia, a fase Adulta, e a Velhice, seja ela do Corpo ou Esprito.     Querendo ou n?o, estacionados "psicolgicamente" ou n?o, estamos "escrevendo"...     Os rascunhos s?o as atitudes que tomamos, e rasgamos, ou melhor, nos perdoamos, compreendendo que a prxima pgina poderemos escrever melhor.     Rasgar o rascunho, significa nos perdoar pelos "erros" que achamos que cometemos, mas enquanto estamos escrevendo,  cada acontecimento  est sendo devidamente registrado.      Temos que aceitar e continuar, porque esses rascunhos j fazem parte do Livro, e um dia vamos nos lembrar deles, quando estivermos l na frente, depois de muitos outros captulos j escritos...     Ent?o o que temos a fazer,  compreender isso de uma vez por todas e pararmos com essa mania de carregarmos esse "sentimento de culpa" por um "rascunho".  O prprio nome j diz:  rascunho.  Ningum pode se culpar por escrever um "rascunho".     Ser perdoado n?o importa.  Se outra pessoa n?o consegue compreender que foi s um "rascunho", a culpa n?o  nossa;  dela, porque n?o foi capaz de entender e nos dar uma chance de escrever, ou "viver" uma nova pgina.     Se perdoe pelos seus"rascunhos".  N?o espero ser perdoado.  E perdoe os "rascunhos" dos outros tambm.     A vida  sua... voc precisa continuar "escrevendo"...     Espero que o Livro de sua vida tenha muitos rascunhos devidamente amassados e jogados fora...   Sinal que est tentando escrever o seu Livro da melhor maneira possvel.

She might smile as you tell a story  even if it's not funny at that point and will laugh at the appropriate times.  Bear in mind there is a difference between signals from a girl in a pub who wants some and a girl who is really into you that you see regularly e.g. at the office or in a group of friends.  Those are more the 'she really likes you' signals, pub girls will often be more forward, getting in your personal space and touching your shoulder when she laughs or something like that, and still the eye contact.|`|eNwO3Vedaa	she teases you    she laughs at almost everything you say    she punches or hits you PLAYFULLY    she makes cute faces or pouts|`|NTrjFujCaa	ask your mum, she can tell you better.|`|50b696d6ca858cc9222722f864760f92aa	from me i would say a LOT of eye contact (gazing + staring), smiling, + being really friendly! :D
M2VUXLBIaa	He probably has some thoughts about some stuff in his mind, wanna share them with u and may be doesn't know how or where to start from, or whether u will accept sharing those thoughts with him..  Since u r wondering now about what he wanted to say, that means that u really care. So, I would recommend that u communicate more with him and make him feel more comfortable about talking with u and also try to start sharing some stuff that interest u with him, so he will be more confident and courage to talk to u about his feelings or thoughts, and good luck..|`|AA10732509	HE WANTS TO GET NASTY BUT HE ISN'T MAN ENOUGH TO ASK.|`|KLJX8u50aa	It means he thought he had the balls to ask you out or something like that, but then lost them when it came to actually asking you. |`|AA10227719	Sure he doesnt mean anything.|`|26wGV0mQaa	He got nervous and anxious and chickened out.

Understand this about men.  We are not as complicated as women are, but women try to ascribe meaning to every thing men do based on what women do.  It doesn't.  Women have a lot of connections between the two hemispheres of their brains, men don't.  We are simpler beings.  Projecting female motives on what men say or do doesn't work.  We also have this tendency to speak our minds directly, no hidden messages or meanings. When a man says something, he generally means exactly what he said, no hidden meanings.

Honestly, don't do it.|`|w2xooybHaa	I don't know anybody that prefers a shaved head athletic or not but if you do shave your head a bit of stubble always looks better...otherwise you might get the sun reflecting off your head. that's never a good look...think Wentworth Miller|`|7t4jDyoeaa	A little bit of stubble is good. i like a guy that looks clean and neat.|`|1KWWxWORaa	smooth.  my ex was bald and I could rub his head for hours after he shaved.  dam I miss his head:)

I would never, ever even consider asking her out because of the age difference.  What could a fossil like me have to offer a kid like her, who has her whole future and family prospects ahead of her!  It would just be selfishness on my part.

Di solito, prima di uscire mi informo sulla"meta" e nel caso non avessi abbastanza soldi lo dico subito. Poi si decide se cambiare meta: al posto di una cena si pu fare un'aperitivo o un "dopo cena" o addirittura una passeggiata, magari in un luogo carino, che non costa nulla. Oppure se proprio vuole offrire lui, la volta dopo offrir io... |`|LtZZg75Uaa	 normale k questo accada ma soprattt penso k lui lo faccia ancora + volentieri xk vede k 6 sincera e hai la testa sulle spalle..

Ciao|`|lBv6ztfLaa	non mi linciate, ma secondo me  una cosa bellissima che lui volgia pagare sempre per te, come se volesse fare di tutto per assicurarsi la tua compagnia. nelle mie poche esperienze, poi, ho nootato che i ragazzi che offrono sono anche i pi attenti e innamorati, mentre quelli che fanno alla romana o che fanno pagare tutto a te sono proprio dei cialtroni, come se non volessero mettersi veramente in gioco.   poich anche il mio ragazzo fa sempre il cavaliere (e io non mi sento affatto in colpa, ma mi piace coccolarlo sempre), gli cucino spesso dei pasti con i suoi cibi preferiti e gli confeziono cose con le mie mani, gli faccio un massaggio, gli registro le cose che non pu vedere, gli preparo dei video su di noi, gli compro dei regalini, perch se c' una cosa che veramente non pu essere rimborsata  il tempo che qualcuno spende per fare quancosa per noi.  In conclusione, credo che dovresti sentirti lusingata di quello che lui fa per te e che i modi per ricambiare sono moltissimi, senza sensi di colpa|`|AEF2NUOfaa	penso che dovresti parlargli nel senso spiegagli la tua situazione economica ( normalissima!) e spiegagli il disagio che ti provoca il fatto che paghi sempre lui..  ehhe  si e' sgradevole  lo so      e' sgradevole perche' puoi anche sentirti in obbligo nel comportarti in un certo modo con lui piuttosto che in un altro.  accertati che ti piaccia davvero questo ragazzo|`|pXgkuirIaa	prova a fargi un regalino di tanto in tanto e lanciagli la battuta che lo fai perche a cena nn ti fa mai pagare.|`|yiB3gPkQaa	fati pagare se loro vogliono farlo approfittane e pi dovrebbe essere cosi;-P|`|Y1Nlop0Taa	parla del tuo disagio al tuo fidanzato se ci tiene a te capir magari qualche volta paghi tu|`|iSz1BGZXaa	anke il mio ragazzo paga sempre lui..anke se vorrei pagare io ahaha  infatti ogni volta ke usciamo sempre a dire "no pago io" e io "nooo iooo" e paga lui alla fine..
RuZd7oLBaa	Fai una cosa: trattale con distanza e quando loro cercano di avvicinarsi respingile, e quando  il momento opportuno (oppure dall'inizio) parli con loro, in tono calmo (devi sembrare delusa, non arrabbiata) spiegali come si sono comportate e farle scegliere se voler continuare questa amicitia o no... restare cos non giova a te che, mentre le due se la spassano, soffri per la loro arroganza... dunque parlaci cos ti potrai chiarire e solo allora decidi se mandarle a fa...ulo o continuare il rapporto|`|Cii8pJlwaa	io farei cos...ne ignorerei l'esistenza fino alla rikiesta di clemenza e intanto andrei in "quel posto" cn altre persone e cerkerei un modo x farlo sapere ad entrambe (magari confidandomi cn amici comuni...) e se poi dovessere kiederti spiegazioni, tu risponderai ke..."amor con amor si paga!" ciao|`|44fed05f03de4877729132bdfabb3776aa	A me non farebbe incazzare e non me la prenderei pi di tanto l' importante  ripagarle della stessa moneta perch per il momento sono loro che si stanno prendendo gioco di te|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Che la tua amica sia scema, secondo me  fuori di dubbio...io mi incazzerei molto (anche se per carattere non riuscirei a tenere"il muso"). Comunque  stata scorretta con te e secondo me hai 2 soluzioni: o fai come niente fosse e quando meno se lo aspetta le restituisci "pan per focaccia", oppure(e credo che sia la scelta opportuna) ci litighi. Se poi vi chiarite tanto meglio, se no pazienza, avrai perso un' amica immatura.|`|MGXYugO2aa	credimi..succedeva anche a me spessissimo quando ero tipo alle medie etc. io mi incazzavo molto, non mi facevo pi sentire per un po'...fino a che poi piano piano la rabbia svaniva e loro si facevano sentire.poi, crescendo, ho imparato a dire in faccia le cose.infatti quando esco con una mia amica, a volte mi tira i bidoni oppure non esce perch non ha voglia. allora un giorno a luglio l'ho chiamata e le ho detto tutto quello che dovevo dirle (mi ero preparato un discorso) del tipo "non mi merito questo tuo trattamento nei miei confronti, per me sei speciale, io ti adoro..lo capisci? e quando m tratti cos ci sto male perch so che anche tu mi vuoi bene.." e lei mi ha chiesto scusa.sinceramente.da allora non si  pi comportata cos. sai il rancore c' ed  normale averlo!  umano..ma non portarne troppo! chiarisci e se la tua amica non dovrebbe capire o essere d'accordo lasciala stare per un po' e fattene nuovi di amici anche se so, credimi lo so pr certo, che  difficilissimo! ciao! 
AA10423186	just  tell  them|`|AA11015890	I had an abusive mother and have come to realise that I need to distance myself from her.  I haven't cut myself off or disowned her, but I realised that being around her made me feel bad about myself.  In order to improve my self-esteem and confidence I needed to put plenty of distance between us.  Now I see her occasionally and keen an emotional distance when I'm there.    Don't let bad parenting ruin your life.  If it affects you, see a counsellor and work it all out.  Otherwise, it's likely to follow you around throughout your life.  And, yes, your mother does have questionable morals.  Fortunately, you don't take after her.  Be grateful for that!|`|AA11900069	I had a terrible mother, but she is dead now.

If you move out remember this,There's no going back with your tail between your legs,your parents will be twice as bad.  I really hope thing work out in your life,Dont listen to your parents ****  move out,even if it means moving into a friends make the break,you will be a better person for it,  I've never missed my parents,because they put me down so much,i was just glad to leave the house|`|cxN3GLneaa	your mom is wrong. my dad is a lawyer and plays the piano for our chruch so he makes a good amount of money. my mom still divorced him because he has a horrible temper. my moms is a hospital nurse and works the night shift.

vsJ7tifdaa	For you to have a life with him...  He has to move out.  Tell him he will always be a Father to the kids but he's not a part of the entire family (meaning his Ex) in that home.  I would assure him that you support that he is the kids' Father.  It is not healthy with him living there & it will cause problems,   because you can't be included.  He doesn't have to choose between you & his kids...  He just has to choose between you & Ex's home|`|77d7d84d5a4a1152b83fd0114e664134aa	Is he planning to move out when you get married or his is going to stay there with his ex-wifey and the kids and you are moving in there?  Dont you see how ridiculous this is?????  He needs to grow up and decide what he wants.  I dont even know how you can call yourself "engaged" when your man is living with another woman.  That is a joke.  Yes is is hard to leave your kids, if your "fiance" cant manage to live on his own he really should be in counselling with the ex and trying to put that family back together.  I think you are wasting your time here|`|AA11785285	Unless you like being number three on his list, why are you even allowing this guy to be in your life?

Talk to him about this.  He needs to take one of these chances to be happy for himself and the kids will adjust to it.  If he does not want to make the commitment to you you are looking for then you must move on and find someone that does want to commit with you.    rd|`|wmkcztYHaa	Why is he making his life so complicated. He has a gf and then he has an ex- that lives with him because he does not want to leave the kids. Sister.......Listen find a man that will devote all of his time with you and not give you the run around of ex's and kids you don't need that find someone that does not have commitments|`|vc0ti7Xhaa	The more that you force the issue the more he will not want to move out.  Express to him how you feel and ask him if there is a way that you guys can work this out.|`|aLNNnv20aa	YES you Should  really pressure my fiance to move out. yes give him an ultimatum he can get custody of the kids and live with you.     |`|8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	I don't think you should place yourself between him and his kids.  You want him to choose you because that's what is in his heart or you'll always be the bad guy.    I think it is a bad situation, but his intentions might be good.  What you need to do is say out loud what you do not like about the situation and then ask yoursef:  Can I live with this?    Then do what is best for you.  Don't try to convince him of anything, just do what you need to.  If it works out, great.  If not, great.|`|AA12250380	Yes, I know nothing is going on!.. He no doubt sleeps on the sofa every night. How gullible can you get?|`|AA11746917	He continues to live with  his ex because he wants to. It doesn't matter if they're romantically involved or not. The fact is, he'd rather live with her and be closer to his kids than be with you full time. That's a fact. If you've been engaged 6 months and he hasn't moved out yet, he never will. You can continue to be taken advantage of, or you can show some self respect, give him an ultimatum, and stick to it.|`|kOqCvTToaa	no 1 in your bf life is hes ex  no 2 is hes kids  no 3 is you    wow so by that time hes really exhausted by dividing hes time.    do you really want to be the last priority?  if not give him an ultimatum    by the way if he choose you don't forget hes kids is still no.1 and you ar the no.2.    i would rather find a man that can give me hes full time and commitment for 100%.  |`|5xmyhFshaa	His baby mama should feel like garbage for letting him live there and he should not want to live with her. What's going to happen when you two get married? Are you all going to live together? He needs to get his children use to the fact that daddy is not going to live with them but that he will always be in their lives and have them stay the night on weekends and things. I think this situation is completely unfair to you and if he won't move out with YOU then you need to move on without HIM!!!
8RgmcysMaa	Guarda che la scuola di baci non esiste... Anche dopo aver avuto diverse storie il primo bacio con un'altra persona  sempre "difficile", nel senso che non si sa cosa l'altro far o si aspetta... ma  un disagio che si supera presto!|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Senti, come dare un bacio non  facile da spiegare a parole...ti avvicini piano, chiudi gli occhi, socchiudi la bocca e appoggi le tue labbra alle sue. Non ti preoccupare della lingua o cose simili. Se lui  pochetto piu' esperto di te, sar lui a mettere prima la lingua. Tu basta che ti lasci andare e assecondi i suoi movimenti...  Su youtube ci tanti filmati di baci...ma spesso sono cose complicate e giochi con la lingua...insomma cose poco naturali da fare durante il primo bacio.  Prova a vedere questo.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCITaAyJR...|`|aac34931935f17d1dee2c8f68556a687aa	Ma ti pare che con un video impari a dare un bacio?  Quando accadr sar unico e indimenticabile, non puoi imparare con un video...|`|AkzAb5k6aa	Guarda ke  una cosa ke t viene naturale...  normale ke tu sia preoccupata o che cmq hai paura di non sapere cs fare ma  veramente impossibile... vedrai ke una volta ke lo dai ti sembrer una sciocchezza xk viene veramente naturale, nn c' nulla da imparare...!|`|hAw8LzRkaa	non credo esista un video cos specifico.... Comunque non farti troppe paranoie, il primo bacio  stupendo anche perch  una cosa che, quando sei pronta, viene naturale.  Vedrai che sar cos e dopo che lo avrai dato ripensando a questa tua domanda ti renderai conto di quanto ti eri preoccupata per nulla!|`|dcv6GwkXaa	E' impossibile scrivere un manuale dei baci. Ognuno  differente e speciale a modo suo. Tu appena proverai vedrai che troverai immediatamente senza nemmeno pensarci il modo in cui ti viene pi comodo e come ti piace di pi e ogni volta che cambierai ragazzo saprai adattarti al loro modo di baciare. Il mio consiglio  quello di buttarti e sar il tuo istinto a seguirti e una delle cose pi naturali al mondo, quindi non sentirti impacciata perch non avrei alcun problema! Ciao!|`|BQBZEK8raa	primo, secondo o terzo non fa alcuna differenza a livello di contatto...sono le emozioni che variano!    adiosSsSsS  Dianz|`|wqkFvEtdaa	seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee......come no|`|q0tlNKsQaa	ma  perch non sai come fare? proprio non sai dove iniziare?  questo il tuo problema? devi mettere la lingua e muoverla come ti pare, non so se ci sia un video cos preciso..
tb67znNMaa	Ragazza mia, premetto che ho 15 anni ma ti voglio rispondere lo stesso. Le storie vecchie secondo te perch vengono chiamate proprio vecchie? Semplice perch sono e rimangono dei ricordi, il tuo ex ti ha usata e trattata male e tu lo hai perdonato? Facile cosi, dovevi fare la dura e farti rispettare e vedere se ti stava ancora dietro! Comunque, secondo me, visto che hai detto che del ragazzo nuovo ti piace il carattere (che  quello che conta) e che  molto dolce con te e tenero Cosa vuoi ancora?? Quel ragazzo si vede che ci tiene a te! Non perderlo e lascia perdere il tuo ex  perch ha sbagliato e deve rimediare lui ai suoi errori! (perch secondo me ha chiesto di rimettersi insieme a te solo perch ha la coscienza sporca!) Secondo me siete fortunati entrambi, tu perch vuoi un ragazzo che ti rispetti e lui perch vuole una ragazza da coccolare e rispettare!|`|5nDbgaQLaa	Io ti consiglio vivamente di frequentare il ragazzo della chat,e in fondo al tuo cuore lo vorresti anche tu, ovvio!   per quanto riguarda il tuo ragazzo,beh se vi siete lasciati dopo 2 anni un motivo c', perci perch riprendere la storia,e rinunciare a qualcosa di nuovo,ed emozioni nuove??? forse uscire con entrambi ti serviva per capire cosa provavi dentro di te nel stare con uno e con l' altro! forse appari un po' confusa ma in realt non lo sei. hai abbastanza le idee chiare,e vuoi semplicemente che qualcuno ti dia la certezza! questo  quello che penso io! vedi tu... ciao un bacio|`|jFSwRGmsaa	ricorda che al cuore non si comanda fa quello ke ti senti di fare attenzione il nuovo ragazzo lo conosci da poco nn sai davvero il suo carattere e ricorda anche che gli ex sn str**zi cio mo ti tiene a c...i suoi xke stava senza ragazza e sa ke siccome ti ha lasciata lui tu lo vuoi ancora bn  io direi di prenderti una pausa e nn stare cn nessuno dei due poi ti ripeto fa quello ke senti|`|3XKOJT8qaa	Da come ne parli sembri molto pi interessata a lui che al tuo ragazzo..e credo che se lo allontani staressi male..pensaci bene e fai la scelta giusta..|`|R5e7Lqzraa	devi saperlo tu...  la cosa migliore  staccare da tutti e 2.  cmq non sembri molto presa dal tuo ragazzo.|`|6Tx0a7oOaa	ti devi porre una domanda semplicissima....    lui oil tuo ragazzo??????  rispondi e vedrai k risolverai i tuoi problemi....  solo te col il tuo cuore devi decidere, e non pensando di far rimanere male qualkuno...ricordatelo..... ciao   fai la scelta giusta......  bacioni|`|TuxHO2MOaa	Io direi che tanto per incominciare puoi scrivere in un italiano decente con qualche abbreviazione in meno, perch l'ho dovuto leggere 2volte per capirlo!|`|tSpCN2KAaa	quando a una persona batte il cuore vuol dire ke  innamorata... devi saperlo tu... stai cn ki ami... io nn so ke konsigli darti ora cm ora... baci...|`|h7U0kNk1aa	secondo me dovresti sentire nel tuo cuore ki ami di + e ki senti ke ti ami di +...sta tt a te...cmq da qll ke mi racconti credo ke andrebbe mejo il nuovo...se l'ex ti ha ftt soffrire dntr te rimarr smx qlks...qlk rancore o qlks del genere...e ricorda...IL MARE E' PIENO DI PESCI!!!!...b buona fortuna...decidi tu e ascolta il tuo cuore...e se hai bisogno di appoggi confidati cn qlk amiko o amika d cui ti fidi...ti daranno appoggio e consigli...buona fortuna kizzoni|`|PQ7HUZlXaa	assolutamente LUI!!!!!!  sbaglio o hai detto tu stessa ke il tuo ragazzo ti aveva trattata male?  beh, qst nn dovrebbe succedere e da cm ne parli sembra che questo altro ragazzo nn ti tratterebbe mai male...  nn la kiamerei proprio ripicca...ma, anche se fosse?  il tuo ragazzo nn sembra 1 granch rispetto a quest'altro...|`|OgloUg0Daa	se ti mancher tanto, significa che al tuo ragazzo nn ci tieni cm vuoi far sembrare.fossi in te,mi prenderei qualche gg per pensare a cosa fare,poi la scelta ti viene spero naturalmente,chi ti manca pi  chi tieni di pi...a presto.ermes|`|5B5QQDPCaa	sei troppo confusa.

dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Five times is great but my wife and I usually save it up for the weekends... for whatever reason, neither one of us is really in to quickies... so what we do, it can take a while.    As far as spicing it up goes.... I am not sure what you are into. Just looking at my wife gets me in the mood and she knows that all it takes is about three good kisses and I about set.    Just try some new positions, rent a movie or two, buy a couple of books, wear sexy outfits, try some role playing.... Studly pizza delivery boy and the lonely woman without enough cash for a tip?    Most of all just let sex be open, honest, and fun... that is what works for my wife and I. When two people focus on the other, both win.|`|jYmvtUC5aa	Make a movie...........public sex.......rockin the truck bed watchin the sunset in the mountains...........use your imagination. Time to fulfill your fantasies..........|`|ma6Re8B1aa	NOOOOOOO  I can't share. Because my sex life is none of your BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... and personally I really DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE EITHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|cCbAFvbraa	The main sex tip for anyone is to make a pact not to have sex in the bedroom for 1 week (or longer). You can have it anywhere else i.e. the car, the kitchen, the park (!), his office etc. Once you mastered this simple exercise, you're ready for better things. x|`|77ZVd5hyaa	Making love to my hubby is never enough for me, 5 times a week is not enough for us.|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	5 times a week too much? if my hubby was only getting it 5 times a week, he'd feel neglected.. He wants it at least once/twice a day. To be fair so do i, so no complaints. Invest in a copy of the Kama Sutra, and try role playing.. Get your hubby to write down his fantasies, you do the same, then once a night pick one out at random and fulfill.. Fantasy fulfilling can be fun.. Not expanding any further, but hope it helps..|`|dN3Ik6fPaa	No five times a week isn't too much ... and no I'm not sharing any trade secrets. |`|ndVFMJbuaa	I dont believe in doing it just for the sake of satisfying one partner, sex should be mutually enjoyed and done when both of you want it. It's not a chore, and what about your needs? It shouldn't be all about him. Selfishness during sex is never good.|`|wYT1my5Yaa	I say it is never too much!!!  my husband wants to have sex at least once a day and me, well i love giving it to him.  i feel like it is better for him to want me all the time than to be some where spreading his love around to other women.  as far as spicing it up just use your wildest imagination and it will come naturally.  try things like going  out and doing it spontaneously like you may have when you were dating.  alot of people seem to think that you don't need to do it as much once u get married.  i beg to differ,  my motto is "the same things u do to get a lover are the same things you have to do to keep them"  so i  say to you enjoy the way your hubby is loving and wanting you all the time.  there are some women out there that would love to have their husband want them like that.|`|AA11827424	It's only too much when it becomes a chore. Your problem seems to be same old-same old, not quantity. Go visit a sex shop already!|`|8MEfSwGmaa	5x is just great...             eventually you will have to do some reruns!   but practice makes perfect.    here are some ideas:  crazy locations  dress up and roll playing  roll reversal  zero contact love making  do it in front of a web cam  karma sutra  termination without moving either of your bodies(very hard but can be done)  food play!  anything with a digital camera    that should keep you going another 2 weeks  have fun|`|pWneH9yFaa	it depends on the age of the person and many more aspects.. generally, 4 to 5 times in a week in their twenties is not too much..... it depends on your interst....  well.... coming to spice up new ideas... u can try new postures... and ask ur buddy to try out wid you...good luck darling|`|79505ca68c46ff33cc40ab5e27efa1c3aa	You get it 5 times a week?  I hate you!!  I am lucky if I get it two times a month. What makes it so bad is 8 years ago we used to go at it 3 times a day.  I miss those days.  I guess someone should have warned me about a relationship with a man 13 years my senior.  It has caught up to him.  I can;t get it off my mind "I've been dishing it out to the hubby about 5 times a week"  LUCKY LUCKY
PaILQVDnaa	I can't wait to cuckold my husband. It turns me on so to know how much he wants it. I will do it  for him because he is such a good man. But before I met him, I never thought of it. He has brought many things to the surface for me. I can really be who I am meant to be, when I am with him. TU :)|`|WKtakdsOaa	It is something I fantasise about but have not done. I like the idea of watching my husband and another woman and I am made to watch. Dont know why I am into it as I cant explain what gets me so excited about it.|`|AA11827424	Aspired??? What are you on, man?|`|KmtxIfG5aa	I have no desire to put the horns of a cuckold on my man....lol    Just so all you ladies know...cuckoldress is an old fashioned word for adultress....or for a woman that's being cheated on...it can go either way.|`|l1VZTF1Haa	Boring, nope.|`|qL15Bojvaa	That's funny - "aspired" - like it's close to winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.    No, you just missed them all, scooter - *Tuesdays* is when all the cucks slither up from under the floorboards.     See you in 6 days!
tSioasYUaa	if it's thick, you can engrave the  1. date when she became your gf  2. your surname if you'd like it to be a heirloom  3. put both your name  4.put your endearment to her such as "honey", "my angel"  when you engrave something in your engagement ring  and when she sees it will make her very happy because for a woman a ring with something engrave on it means its important|`|AA11827424	Nothing. You can have something engraved on the inside of the wedding bands, though.|`|ne5eP4Z5aa	I think something special to the two of you is best.  My engagement ring isn't engraved but our wedding bands will say "you better" because it is our inside joke..when one of us says "I love you" we occasionally respond with "you better."  So we always joked we would have to put it on the rings...so we probably will.  but that is just us.    I also love the very sweet sentiments.  Skip the date...nothing really special about that.  If you have some personal nickname (ex: monkey) use that like..."B my monkey 4-ever"|`|F35F3DUdaa	your name and her name|`|dxKidioQaa	Get something that's meaningful to both of you. Something that no one else really knows what it means when they see it, besides you two. I think that would make it special!|`|CIIE5HnQaa	Awesome idea, think of something that only you two know about, like an inside joke or something that sets you two apart as a couple, and have a short phrase that deals with that on there.     Sweet idea bro.|`|m4Rrfkwxaa	First off, congratulations. Your girlfriend is very lucky. Secondly, I totally applaud you for taking the time to try to make it as special as possible.  If I were you, I would try to find her favorite poem or poet or if she doesn't have one, you can search for some online (easiest).  Read some of their poems and choose one that represents the love and respect that you have for her and your relationship. The poem that you decide to pick out, you can have read at your wedding, so that it holds more significance; a special poem that you chose for her.  Choose your favorite verse of the poem and have it engraved in her ring. It will show that you are (1) taking this seriously (2) sentimental. Check out this website...your sure to find some.  www.poetry.com/lovepoems/lovepoems.asp   |`|Y08YLysXaa	Mine is secondhand and has nothing engraved on it, I dont think my partner thinks of those kinds of things.    I would be blown away if I had anything engraved. I think it's a lovely idea and she'll like it no matter what.|`|5QDcpmGpaa	you could have the date you propose to her on it |`|tzoJ96c4aa	Nonrefundable. That's what's on my fiance's! We like to take life a little less seriously sometimes.|`|Q5KhpYbvaa	ALWAYS|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	I would not have anything engraved at this point. Wait until you buy the wedding rings together, then have all the rings engraved. |`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Something meaningful only you two know.   In-joke :)|`|2kdQwvbnaa	If it's a thick band you could have "more today than yesterday, less than tomorrow" engraved on it.  My parents have that.
FzFSzilmaa	perhaps you need to learn that peace of mind can't be found in cyberspace...    get off the computer, talk to your husband and work out your marriage between you!!! :D|`|AA11827424	Call 800-SUCKER-9000 and have your credit card ready.|`|a44ae0ff85131fac209cb7a6b624b0fdaa	No one can give you this, marriage can't give you this. You are the only one who can. Find something you are passionate about, throw yourself into it (and I don't mean another man) and live the life you want. We create our own realities, and right now yours isn't what you want it to be.     What are you missing? Are you bored? Is your marriage not what you thought it would be?     There is too much missing information here to be able to help you. 
3HmNEO5Gaa	dump this guy.  he is NOT a man. he is such a wuss, letting someone talk to his wife like that.    being married means that each of you is there for one another and should be a team against any outsider who tries to hurt either of them.      there is no point of being in this relationship no more longer than a second!  he will never be there for you!  what if you get into an accident, and at the same time his dad tells him not to go to your side? which do you think he would choose?  and what type of man do you want?  find a man who will be there for you no matter what, and protect you. this one is NOT and will NEVER be it.    once you get him out of your life, find out why you chose a man like him.  be stronger so that you never choose such a man again!  good luck.|`|pH7CmzOIaa	What your husband is doing is emotional abuse. Get out of the relationship. You have already apologized and shouldn't have to do it again. He is trying to control you and so is his father. He is manipulating you. Get out while you can, before the abuse turns physical as it usually does. This type of abuse tries to make a person feel worthless, and that isn't the case. You are a worthwhile human being and deserve to be treated with respect. Respect yourself enough to get out now. Good Luck.|`|bbF0Wbduaa	Unfortunatly if you are not happy with the way your husband treats you now, you might as well leave, coz nothings going to change.   A lot of what hes doing has been taught to him though his family, but culture shouldn't be a reason to not care if your wife is unhappy.   Either get happy or get out - you will not be able to change a man like this. I know I couldn't. |`|5RT4qEyeaa	Why stay with such a selfish controlling man? You're worth alot. Loeave him and sytop apologising for nothing. Please...|`|PgrKQL7Baa	There is no point in staying with such people who insults you and ask u to apologize and also want monetary help... so i think they have no principles and your hubby is just a puppet in their hands... you have your own self respect... so time to decide ... |`|15eb8387d74986a6f6f9cf3828274860aa	The goose that lay the golden eggs  will bring the husband and teach him to live as a man .|`|AA11496842	Knock hubby to his knees and tell him he can apologize to you. |`|NqMmvvgVaa	What kind of weird family did you marry in to?   You should never ever get on your knees to apologise to anyone, you speak to them as an equal. Honestly, it sounds as if you would be better off without this man as well as his family. Any man who condones this kind of treatment is not a good man. |`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Nope.... your husband is doing nothing but controlling you.  Making you apologize to a person who then insults you... and he knows that he once again will insult you, is beyond silly and immature.  Your husband needs to grow up and stop living and pleasing his parents.  You should be number 1 on his list....but I can see that you are anything but.  Please...find a man who puts you at the top of his list, and not his parents.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	What a poisonous relationship you two have.  How degrading he is treating you, and his father as well.  I am truly disgusted I really am... Why would you ever stay with such a cold and cruel person?    He is your husband, he is supposed to stand by YOUR side and DEFEND you.  He is not a good husband at all...you need to pack your bags and find a real man.  One that will treat you the way you truly deserve.    Don't put up with this behavior, you only get this one life, don't waste it with someone like him.|`|AA11827424	Your husband is a wimp who can't stand up to his parents and takes out his inadequacy on you. Leave now and file for an annulment.|`|68msDkYUaa	i think you should be glad and take up this opportunity to  get divorced from him... he is just controlling you the wayhe wants n will make your life hell later.......ihope you are well educated and can be self dependent.. there is no shortage of good guyzz. so plzz move on n be strong..|`|hQMiSlvMaa	Leave that freak NOW.  you don't deserve this.  
Y2fde4Qjaa	It all depends on the guy.|`|j1FCM0pqaa	yep defo let him know how u feel or else u could potentionally lose a good thing |`|AA11900069	If you want a nice kind of guy, a sheep-dog, don't go to clubs which are only full of wolves!   Any guy who is in a library on a Friday evening, or at a local college to take a course to further himself, is the kind you may want to consider.|`|OXP6gUfmaa	it kinda is!!! just put ur flirt on!! maybe he will make the first move|`|k4ZIdMrKaa	No not all the time, just because he's a nice guy doesn't means he's shy...my bf is a pretty nice respectful person and he came after me.    If he's shy different story you probably will have to make a move on him.|`|GNXCSXPVaa	speaking from first hand experience. I consider myself to be the "nice guy". I'm shy, soft-spoken, and a little low on the self-confidence. One night at a friends party I was eyeing this beautiful blonde girl. We made some eye contact, and I knew something was up. Of course I didn't have the balls to go up and talk to her, and since basically every girl I know doesn't have the balls to come up and talk to me, I just thought it was going to be another missed opportunity. To my suprise she sat down at the thumper table with me and started talking to me. To make a long story short...we've been going out for almost 2 months and we r having a blast.    LADIES, PLEASE INITIATE CONVERSATION MORE. MEN ARE TIRED OF HAVING TO START EVERYTHING.    hopes this helps  Cope|`|7gmQPFKcaa	yer i think this is true|`|deq7I2NTaa	not always..|`|S1NxVTG2aa	No! I don't think so anyway... If he's shy, just make it easy for him to talk to you. Don't be loud and intimidating, just talk to the guy. |`|C4gmp1Zcaa	most of the time, yes thats the case x|`|aW9tCiQ4aa	I think it is true|`|SRmCzkPIaa	That's been my experience. Just getting their phone number is a good start because they might never have the courage to ask you out.
RC8Pxx8eaa	You want him because he doesn't want you, its the old cliche - you always want what you cant have.  Forget him you sound obsessed if he is the only reason you are working and living, I love my fiance more than I can say but he is not my main motivation for working and living and if anything ever happened to part us then I would be able to carry on.  Life is not about giving your all to another person its about sharing things and being part of a couple, you are not part of any couple you are an individual and you are almost throwing your own life away because you are not his cup of tea.  What does that say about you ? its says get a life and move on, you are worth more than day dreams and unless you are 16 - you should have more sense than to spend your life thinking of him.  He does not want you, understand that and do something else other than fantasise about him.|`|AA11900069	Unrequieted love is pointless.  Claudia Schiffer doesn't care about me!|`|DBJtgCDkaa	give up and find someone who loves you even more than you love him|`|tFVCoSIjaa	You failed to mention whether or not he reciprocated your feelings for him.

You'll get over him.

If you want the bf, consider that you'll be moving out on your own soon, so it's possible you can put off the relationship and confrontation until then, when it's easier to handle your family from a distance.  In the long-term, how do you feel about your religious differences?  Does it matter to you what religion your kids might be raised in?|`|9WR2lKBtaa	He loves you. It looks like you have to think about this. Follow your heart.|`|NgpHScXnaa	thats so sad - what religion are you?      i think that if you both love each other very much ...theres nothing you can really do about it.  If you're 19 and he's 23 maybe you could marry so the family will shut up ...just depends how much you want each other ...sounds like he really wants you.|`|31a4c0f9a918bf2a314d5f576851bc6aaa	its so obvious this guy totally adores you. if you really want this relationship you need to find a way to make this work, if not you need to tell him and not lead him on, its unfair. and as for your religion situation, your love saw no colour or religion, if this guy makes you happy why not.does you family want to be happy at your expense. and you don't have to say anything just kiss him back, it means more than words|`|cPe9Y9CAaa	follow your heart, its funny because there is only one god, and hes the one who created you both and you guys are praying to the same god, and god is made of love, also religions were never made to make space between people and hurt them. wow when do people get real, sorry but i just feel sorry for the people who still think like that, it drives me crazy  but dont worry hun, i believe that nothing can stop love so just hang in there and wait, your 19 i still dont see why, because your on your own now, your parents cant control you, if i was you i would sneak out, its childish but i couldnt wait to see my girlfriend (if i had one) after a week    anyway, good luck|`|vrkPjEZjaa	Well, no ones wants to choose between family or love,  but maybe you can sort something out, between the family  or even try finding someone different, that your family likes.  or the last thing is to follow your heart  would you be able to live without your family loving you?  anyway later on your family will come around and then you'll be all happy again    just love him unless you dont, so then from that get rid of him    Best wishes

uqPDoT2haa	Forse  una reazione nei tuoi confronti, a volte i bambini si sentono valorizzati dagli insegnanti a scuola e danno il meglio di s per non deludere chi crede in loro. A casa vogliono attirare l'attenzione ma lo fanno nel peggiore dei modi. Prova a cambiare strategia, a concederle pi tempo e attenzioni! Auguri!

A casa non succede questo, ha piu' confidenza quindi viene fuori il vero carattere che non e' detto che sia permantente. Non sgridarla per ogni minima cosa ma poni dei paletti, di modo che le sia chiaro quello che non deve fare. Devi farle capire le cose senza gridare ma con fermezza perch puo' darsi che il nervosismo lo coglie in casa.|`|XoC8zXlxaa	io mi son trovata nella situazione opposta: a casa tranquillo e a scuola un diavoletto  ovviamente si cerca di parlare con i bambini, ma non si pu pretendere che cambino atteggiamento loro se noi manteniamo lo stesso. Non ti dico che stai sbagliando, ma che provando a cambiare approccio, tono di voce, cose che fate insieme si disinnesca un circolo vizioso. poi se il caso provare anche a farli sfogare con lo sport : tutto il tempo in cui fanno i bravi ho paura reprimano cose che dovrebbero sfogare e forse correndo e sudando (magari insieme a te) si sfoga in modo piu'.. salutare.  |`|NqC3brQBaa	hahaha! pure io ero cos.. non preoccuparti, se  educata vuol dire che hai fatto bene il tuo dovere di genitore.. e comunque hanno ragione le maestre.. dopo un giornata a scuola o all'asilo che sia facendo la brava.. questa bambina potr pure fare un p da monella? tranquilla quando arriva alle medie (se fa come me) le passa, visto che  pi grandetta e lo capisce|`|h6N4HyPjaa	E si, anche io ero fatto cos, per il senso contrario, non si preoccupi, il tempo che si orienta negli anni la bambina e sar anche lei una pazza scatenata.. ahah..|`|7kqY0KKwaa	allora sai una cosa io mi intendo di bimbi anche se sono una adolescente(ho fatto Baby sitter per tre anni e maestra d' asilo) cmq quando fa cosi devi dale una sculacciata e metterla in castigo no viziarla mai un po quello che serve ma non troppo essere dolce nei momenti adeguati essere cattivi quando ce ne bisogno e non farti prendere in giro quando ti sbuffa perch senno si burler sempre di te e poi quando sara grande il suo futuro non sara quello che speri ma un' altro brutto ragazzi diciamo hai capito (senza offesa ) mai sottomettersi ai bambini senno li vedi da adolescenti!! cmq questo  un consiglio e non prenderlo alla leggera|`|07rq1sczaa	Non lo so!  |`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Secondo me, il punto non  che "a casa si sfoga".   Dipende tutto dal comportamento che avete in casa con lei.  A scuola si rende conto che non pu essere sempre lei al centro dell'attenzione e che deve rispettare le regole; a casa, probabilmente, "le regole" cerca di farle lei!  Innanzitutto per farsi rispettare bisogna farle capire chi comanda: se dici "NO"  "NO"..."no" non pu voler dire "ni, forse..."anche a costo di sentirla strillare e piangere(perch se dici no e poi, per non sentirla strillare, il no diventa si, lei impara che per farsi dire di si deve solo "pichhiare un po' i piedi per terra"...). Anche il fatto che magari quando tu le dici di fare qualcosa, lei va dal pap e subito il pap contraddice ci che le hai detto tu di fare( dicendo:"lo fa dopo" oppure facendolo lui per lei),  un esempio sbagliato.  La prima figlia non ti ha dato questi problemi, perch ogni figlia  un caso a parte: ogniuno ha il proprio carattere.
8yE2sYGeaa	Two years is an awful long time to have to wait because dad is uncertain|`|4uB0bbhnaa	didn't You post a similar question and comment on this relationship already, a week or so  ago    To be honest I think its very romantic    obviously loves her very much and wanted to respect    her father's wishes    writing her poems and art work is very romantic and is certainly not pathetic    Aren't  you just a bit jealous of them ??  In fact it's their marriage,not yours|`|gKYdDqccaa	He sounds like a better man than you do. Sounds lovely - romantic|`|AA11900069	So, he was calm, level-headed and patient, he waited those two years to prove his love to the girl, and a respect to his new father-in-law.  He didn't try to pry the girl from her father, and force her to choose between family or a lover.       He writes poetry for her.  Have you never written poetry, or a song, or a piece of music for a girl?  Not just because you wanted some reward from her for it, but because those emotions needed to be poured out and embodied, from inchoate personal thoughts, to a form that could inform her of your feelings to her.       He paints for her?...  I would paint, if I had the talent.  I am able to write expressively, and play guitar.  I can compose music to show the feelings I carry inside.  Such gestures have always been well received.  Eric Clapton wrote "Layla", and the woman he wanted left her husband for him, catalysed by the powerful emotions she felt on hearing it.        He didn't sleep with her until they married.  That is their business, and no-one elses'.  It proved to her that he was there for the long run, and didn't just want to carve another notch on his bed-post.         You write definitely a homo right?" - well, he is the one with the wife who you say is hotter than Jessica Alba!  |`|9ac4efe2c281bd465dbf8d33952bdfb8aa	You're an idiot.|`|Cq1chP3Qaa	Romantic. Thought you got over this.... GET HELP!|`|MPoN5bKeaa	I wish I had a dad who cared about me like that, that woman is very blessed to have such a good father aswell as a great husband. Very lucky. |`|SO7zygg9aa	Romantic, definitely! He never gave up on the girl he loved, what's so pathetic about that?    Its quite awkward for me reading this, you sound quite close-minded.  Not everyone conforms to the idea of having sex before marriage, doesn't make them a freak/geek/homo etc.  Lots of people like to actually know their partner inside out before jumping into bed with them, its your kind of attitude (and similar) that's why everything is so sexed up these days, its really bad.      Yates, Monet, van Gogh, Hughes - were they all gay?    Stop hating!!|`|ReLh0ttjaa	Well if it took that to marry someone hotter than Jessica Alba and now he has her, what's to complain about? It was obviously all for a good cause and they're both happy, yes, even the DAD!!    I write letters but not often poetry to my girl. Havent done any drawing yet but was thinking it might be nice recently. Could be fun. I love to surprise her with nice things.

df7e0a98adad7376c2265d7ad4d45e2faa	Many countries require you to have proof you are free to marry. If that is the case you have to give notice at your local registry office. After 21 days you will be issued with a Certificate of no impediment (CNI) which you will have to have translated at the British consulate nearest to where you want to marry. Easy.  I had to do this when I married abroad.|`|AA11900069	take good advice, because you have to live in some countries for a month before you can marry there.|`|yab6j7vaaa	It is NOT true. I worked as a travel agent for over 25 years, and I got married in Jamaica. You do not need to do anything at all in the UK. You must abide by the laws of the country you are marrying in, and provided you get a proper notarised marriage certificate from that country,  your marriage is legal in the UK.  Go and see a travel agent, who will explain all the legalities to you, depending on the country you choose, and they should hopefully be able to give you some literature too.  It's not usual to have to live in the country for a month. One or two weeks is more common. Holiday companies (Like Kuoni or Virgin) are well experienced in foreign marriages,and they have wedding departments you can call for advice.  Check out their web sites for contact numbers.|`|cbtvdvo0aa	i'm not sure about the answer to your question, but if you are looking for a place in england to have your wedding this site has tons of great venues that would be perfect!    http://www.funkyweddingvenues.com

On nights your going to be together only have two or three drinks. Girls are simple creatures. Be respectful, Be nice. And have good Hygiene and your already way ahead of the curve. Guys by nature are a little rough around the edges and girls notice these slight differences. Be confident, women don't want a man who is self doubting. They can sense that and its not sexy.|`|9FIdlUcwaa	First of all, most males are in the 5 to 5 and a half inch range. More often than not, a lot of males compare themselves with the porn stars that they see on the Internet or adult movies. This is not a fair comparison as they are not reflective of the average male. In getting back to your situation, it is important that you understand that your girlfriend is interested in you because of who you are and how you make her feel. If she has small breasts or a butt that is smaller than you'd prefer would you hold that against her? Definitely not. Then why would she? The truth of the matter is that this problem is in your mind, not between your legs. When making love to her focus your energies on pleasuring her rather than on your "performance". She will see you as a tremendous lover. Also, you may want to try Viagra to help you maintain your "confidence." Often times when males (young and old) are anxious about performing or they're insecure because of a certain "area" they tend to lose their confidence. Viagra helps boost ones confidence in this situation. In fact a recent study showed that the highest users of Viagra were males between the ages of 22 -32. Also, keep in mind that there are millions of men who think just the way you do. We just don't have the courage to say so. Good luck.          |`|H6uYThgjaa	maybe you should talk to her about it. maybe she does not think that way.
NvW6voPJaa	Hi and congratulations on your recent marriage!    I would NOT do the "fake wedding."  Your friend is right.  People will feel like they were duped into, what they thought, was a "real" wedding, which, in fact, it isn't.  This gets into so many lies.    What I would do would be to announce it to your families soon....during the Holiday season?  Then, let them know that you are planning a 1 year anniversary celebration party.  DON'T plan a fake wedding.  Obviously you had your reasons for eloping, which are not important to any of us strangers.  But....if you didn't want to do the wedding in the first place in front of family and friends, then why the pretend one?    Again, just announce it....give them time to "get over it."  And, then plan a 1 year anniversary celebration party!!|`|AA11900069	Wow! What a situation!  I think you should approach a production company, and film this!  It might keep their reactions in line more, if they consider that they don't want to become nationally famous for ranting over something they cannot change.      Where does the heart of the disapproval lie, may I ask?  Your folks don't like him, or his folks don't like you?  |`|AA11591803	I cannot answer any better than MyLadyJ...I agree with her totally.    |`|jZ03Zdjdaa	Wow, how deceptive.  You're already married, and you're planning a phony wedding.  After the gifts are given, the showers and bachelor(ette) parties held, and people have taken the trouble to dress up and participate the phony wedding, you're going to tell them basically, "ha ha, it's really our first anniversary, not our wedding!"  Yes, your friend is likely right, it will piss everyone off, even more than your failing to tell them you're married.    Even if you come clean and then do a 1st anniversary vow renewal, 1 year is way too soon to be publically renewing vows.  They should be very fresh in your mind.    Fortunately, most officiants won't let you pull this off.  They'll ask for your marriage license so they can sign it and make it official at your ceremony.  You won't be able to produce this document.    P.S.  Palmtree, below, has an excellent detailed explanation about why family members would be pissed about this.  Thumbs up!    And the 2 posts above mine explaining that this is a greedy gift grab are spot on.|`|ZfleGhXLaa	I know of one wedding that had this exact same situation.  The bride and groom had already eloped without telling their family.  Only the closest friends, and the couples house mate knew.  They planned a wedding (a vow renewal" ceremony) on April fools day.  No one knew it was a vow renewal until the vows, but at that point everyone thought it was a joke.  Until it was announced that pictures from the couples courthouse nuptials (which had taken place a year prior) were on display in the reception hall.  No one was mad, in fact the brides very religious family actually expressed that they were relieved she had not been "living in sin" this whole time, and that she decided to have a ceremony for the families in spite of already being married.|`|IUpIHFTKaa	It's always best to stick with the truth.  I eloped and told my parents right away.  Since we also moved 2000 miles away, my father never met my husband for 2 years.    Once he did, he loved him.  Before my Dad died, he told me I was his only child he didn't have to worry about because I had such a wonderful husband.    If you love your husband, then so will they.  If not, then it's their loss.    Good luck!  |`|cPhZKATTaa	Definitely don't wait.    Invite them to a housewarming and announce it then, saying that while you would have loved to have everyone at the wedding, you chose to have a quiet ceremony with just the two of you, but you won't really feel like a couple till you have the blessing of all of them. Then stand back... present each of them with a photo of your wedding as a thank you card for helping you celebrate "On this day". They will be annoyed, and probably hurt, but if they love you, they will come around.    Congratulations and best wishes.|`|uxsncY1paa	as far as i know once u r married u 2 r family they just have to build a bridge an get ova it it is u lives or have a house party or bbq and annouce u pregnate then go no just kidding we eloped were married if they dont like it dont worry they cant be mad 4 eva just enjoy u married life okay|`|71eb194551f71e5eb573dce622125c6eaa	Queen,  Are you crazy!!    |`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	I cannot stress highly enough what a horrifically bad idea this is. If I shouted it from the rooftops it wouldn't be enough. This is not just bad manners and bad etiquette, it's also illegal and will leave every member of your family appalled.    You must, and I mean this, you MUST tell your family now. Then you must either call off the wedding ceremony or turn it into a vow affirmation: you have absolutely no choice in this. If you want a big party next year you may hold a reception, but you cannot under any circumstance on Earth have a wedding. No way, no how.     You have had your wedding ceremony, and that's the only one you get for this marriage. You legally cannot have two for the same marriage. It's unfortunate that it wasn't your dream wedding, but nothing can be done about that now. I cannot in words even come close to explaining how immensely and intensely offensive it would be to your friends and family if you faked a wedding ceremony just to have a "big white wedding", pictures, and fake memories. No matter the reason you have for doing it, it would come across as a grasping, gimme-gimme cash grab made by a couple of greedy, entitled people who faked a wedding just to get gifts. I'm sorry to say that but that's what people think of fake weddings. More traditional relatives may even see you as breaking the commandment about bearing false witness, especially if you're planning a church 'wedding', or even blasphemously mocking the sacrament of marriage. It's that serious.    Also consider that in many places, performing a full wedding ceremony for a couple who is already married is a felony. In other places it's merely a misdemeanor carrying a stiff fine. Because of this, a sensible officiant will refuse to perform a wedding ceremony if you tell him you're already married. If you fail to inform him, he will find out after the fact when the state or provincial government has him arrested for fraud.     You could have a vow affirmal instead of a wedding, but the vow affirmal ceremony does not sound like a wedding ceremony. If you don't tell everyone you're married first and they attend your affirmal thinking it's a wedding, they will notice the difference before you have a chance to tell them, and they will be enraged by what they will see as your duplicity. I can guarantee this. Making them spend big dollars on a big wedding (or even just on attending the wedding) to find out it isn't real at the last moment would enrage and disgust anyone.    Don't do this. Tell your families now, and either cancel the ceremony or replace it with a vow affirmal. Second weddings for the same marriage aren't just in the worst possible taste, they're also illegal and go against the teachings of every faith there is.|`|mJiO0LYyaa	send everyone an announcement.    a fake wedding at this point WOULD piss everybody off. it would be perceived as a gift grab. it would be a VERY BIG LIE.    you are already married. there are no do-overs. you are no longer a bride.    to bubba blue: standing ovation! brava! brava!    to the posts below mine well said!  honestly if this happend i would pull my gift and leave the reception. if i found out later i would stop payment on the check.  what a con artist! what a fraud!|`|Ocv4G6Y4aa	I think the situation you described will get people mad especially close family- the worst part about that is that they will have to act like they are happy because there will be so many people around.  That's not fair to them.     I know of a couple who got married, and about a year later they had a fake ceremony, where family and friends thought they were really getting married.  I thought it was a little strange, but hey it worked for them.    second choice is to just announce that you are already married.  Either take close family out to dinner and announce it.  Or just send out cards announcing it.  I am sure some people will be a little upset, but I guess it would be better then lying.      Good Luck with whatever you choose =)|`|MannYZf7aa	Just tell them.Yeah,they'll be pissed.I cant understand how anyone wouldnt want family (if their close to) at the wedding.Thats selfish.|`|mZtUh4JFaa	You either fake a wedding. Or write them all letters or cards. And let them flip out on their own. maybe they'll have calmed down a little by the time you see them.|`|kzxRhsXVaa	I think your friends are right; people will be hurt if you invite them to a wedding and they find out it is actually an anniversary party. People are going to be upset that they were lied to... not just because of the amount of time between the wedding and the "party", but because of all the time and effort put into the lie. They're going to be mad that they spent so much time, energy and money on a fake wedding. Your family will feel taken advantage of. They are not going to smile and say, "Oh, what a sweet surprise!" There will be bad tears. There will probably be a scene. Your families will look back on the last year -- all those times they offered marriage advice; or had open, heart to heart discussions with you; every time you say you're excited about the wedding -- and see you both as dishonest, selfish and manipulative. They'll be mad that you were intentionally deceptive for so long, and will think about things like how you take your wedding ring off before you see them. I know this sounds harsh, but it's what you're going to face. It will be bad... Especially when the family is shocked and your friends are not. Ouch. You'll also be setting yourself up for snippy comments for years to come... if you get pregnant down the road, do you want to hear, "Are you sure you're pregnant? Or is there a toddler running around that we don't know about yet? HaHa!!!!!!" A fake wedding is bad.     If they're going to be mad either way, your best bet is to tell them as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the worse it will be. Tell your parents and in-laws that you want to get together as a group because you both want to make an announcement. Avoid getting together in a restaurant. Then, tell them the truth. Tell them that you and your husband would like to throw a reception party and you hope that they are willing to attend (it is not appropriate to ask your family to contribute to the cost of this party). When you tell them, be calm (no giggling) and prepared.     Good luck! And remember -- tell them immediately.|`|VHgfWPS2aa	I would send Christmas cards from Mr and Mrs just like some ppl do when there telling families that there pregnant :)    Good luck Hun and congrats :)|`|IUgkylWqaa	I think you're parents may be upset if only because they didn't get to throw their little girl a nice wedding. Just tell them about your marriage now, don't wait, and tell them to look on the bright side. 1) they saved a fortune by not having a huge wedding to pay for, 2) they got a son out of the deal, and 3) they saved a ton of money.    If you go along with this fake wedding idea, how many of your friends do you expect to play along with your scheme since they all know about your marriage?   Would they all pretend to throw you a bridal shower? Would they pretend to give you gifts? Would they pretend to go to your fake wedding? Would your fake wedding attendants love the idea of spending $500 on dresses, shoes, tuxes, accessories, etc to be in your fake wedding? Would they all pretend to be surprised when you make your announcement?    If I was one of your friends, I would think this whole fake wedding idea was just a way to be greedy and get gifts. I would write you off immediately.    And no doubt your family would be pissed because they spent thousands of dollars throwing a fake party for you, basically like lighting a cash bonfire. It's stupid and pointless.    If you actually picked a decent guy to marry then your family will not be mad at you for eloping.   So to answer your question, you tell them NOW.    You say "Mom, dad... I'd like you to meet your new son, my husband."  Let them react and ask questions, because there will be questions. And point out to them the gains out from eloping like I mentioned previously, 1) save money and 2) gained a son.    Tell them now!!
U3rAnM0Xaa	Hello Jisoo, I was pretty much in the same boat. Of course it's possible. It's called Family Planning. See if you have a family planning centre or association where you live and visit them for advice depending on your specific needs.   I was 24 when I married my childhood sweetheart of 7 years (who was 26 then), and will complete 5 years in Feb 2009. We finally decided to have a baby in May this year and I conceived within the first month of having unprotected sex. I am due in March 2009. For the past 4 years, we used protection- condoms- and had sex without protection on the 'safe' days. They're not so safe actually, but I guess we got lucky. You should ask your gynac about that.     Birth control pills are an option as well, but I stayed off them because I didn't want to play with my menstrual cycle, which is otherwise normal to the T. It's great that you and your fiance have discussed this issue and are proactively working to achieve your family planning goals. And you need to decide for yourself, what you would do in case you accidently get pregnant. We had 2 scares in these 4 years- my periods got delayed by a couple of days. We were so worried and I don't know how many home pregnancy tests I did to find out if i'd gotten pregnant! Happily, I never did. :)   Whether you resort to an abortion (in case it's legal in Korea) or go ahead with the pregnancy would entirely depend on you and your husband's situation at that time. Hopefully you both will exercise caution and prevent any unwanted pregnancy. All the best to you both.- Preeti|`|RMscxyemaa	yeah sure if he agrees with it. just go on the pill or something if he agrees.|`|13knmfG0aa	Its your relationship, your in control, anything is possible :]  I hope it all works out for you :]  In my opinion I think it is as you are both in love etc .. x|`|kkm8fN5Haa	Of course. My mom and dad were the same age as the both of you and waited an ETERNITY before having kids. It did them some good because they got to know each other even more and did so much together that would have been impossible with children. Whether you wait or not, you won't regret having children, I'm sure. =]|`|z98CWQ4taa	Heck yeah. Just wait, wait, wait, you'll have plenty of time later to change poopie diapers. Just have fun while you can.  If your not ready your not ready.  But if it happens by accident that's ok.  God is telling you to have a kid. Just go with the flow.  Just take a pill everyday.|`|dkbE36izaa	It is absolutely possible. Married couples are doing it everyday. There are far too many products available that protect you from pregnancy to worry about it. As long as your future husband agrees that it is best to wait, then find the right product for you and have a great marriage and sex life. Go wild and enjoy your life.|`|wrnTKAgbaa	It is totally possible. It is unwise you have a child before you are financially ready. Just keep using contraception until you are ready.|`|e6b9b283e7948cd500682bf20cb7ad16aa	well, i think is fine. both of you hav the point of why not hav child:  "we decided we want to wait until we're financially stable. and during that time we wanted to spend more time with each other and travel more."    it just, you may not regret wht will happened in the future. nobody know what happened in future.|`|I5Mb1OGNaa	You can hold off but I tried that and once we were married he refused to use protection b/c we were married and I was secretly on birth control but that didnt work for very long still got pregnant|`|hVrfm4eIaa	Absolutely, that is what my husband and I are doing as well.  We married when I was 21, he was 25.  I started law school a month after our wedding.  So, right now my education is the priority.  We don't want to rush into having kids.      We are currently enjoying spending time with one another.  I am on hormonal birth control which is 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.  As long as you create an effective birth control plan (and consistently stick with it), you should be able to wait to have children.  I would not rely solely on condoms to prevent pregnancy though.  Condoms can break and their effectiveness rate is lower than birth control pills.  If you use a condom and it breaks, you should take Plan B as soon as possible to decrease your chance of pregnancy.      Lastly, if your religious beliefs require you to use natural family planning methods of birth control you probably won't be able to wait 4-5 years to have children.  These methods are much less effective because you must try and determine which days you are fertile and then abstain.  Our friends who used this method were pregnant within 14 months.|`|BA3y6MBlaa	Of course, unless you have a religious issue with contraceptives.  My husband and I were married for 13 years before having our son.  But I wouldn't recommend going beyond much more than 28, fertility goes down.  We didn't have a problem, in fact our boy was a blessed "accident" but I've heard many stories of women waiting too long.  Enjoy your time together, you are very young.  There is nothing wrong with your decision.  It makes alot of sense.  Being the responsible people you are, children will consume so much of your energy.  Achieve some of those goals before you embark on that irrevocable journey.|`|WKtakdsOaa	We were married nearly 4 years before our daughter was born. My mum and dad were married for 10 |`|svg71dazaa	Yes of course -we call it contraception and it is readily available to women. My husband and i are also planning to have kids much later on. Unless there is a little oops! I think it's great to wait, as kids do change your life in a huge way and need full attention and love!|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	If you can't figure out this answer yourself, you don't need to get married.  You will have problems bigger than this in your lifetime and you have to make decisions.  Having kids is a part of a lot of marriages.  We planned when to have each of our children, since we wanted them 2 years apart.  First  one was born when I was 28, after we were married for 3-1/2 years, just like we planned.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I  am assuming you are a very, naive young woman and that you are a virgin. Why not so  some research before you marry on the many ways of birth  control available. I'm guessing it will be up to you  since your husband has already accepted  a pregnancy  before you are both ready. Actually you should show your husband what your research has turned up and make sure that will not be a problem with him.|`|AA11023855	its very much possible, if you follow some precaution measures|`|AA10240683	Why not? |`|AA11900069	That is why the call it Birth Control.  Congratulations on your stance.  You will be more mature, in a more stable relationship, before the children come along.  You will be able to provide a better life for them.  I see some mothers who have 3 children by 25, then their marriage fails, then there are few men ready to take on that level of responsibility...      One day at a time.|`|lVuvUqoiaa	Of course!  You can do whatever you and your fiance choose to do.  Having kids is a huge responsibility and it changes your life forever, and you shouldn't dive into that until you're both ready, financially and emotionally.  You're very mature.  Just get used to lots of questions all the time "when are you having kids?  Are you going to have kids soon?  Will you try for children?"  Because those questions start on your wedding day and don't end until you're pregnant!  What I don't understand is that you'll be older in "Korean tradition"?  What's that about?  Good luck to you!  :-)|`|UDi1OxH7aa	  In my opinion you can't    When you get married you want to be a mom    You cant it is the nature sweetie  |`|0f20a5a6e44450923ec1dc4f592cd631aa	is it possible to be married and hold off on having kids?     Yes its possible as long as you take pre-caution.   Either you take pills or he uses condom.   Communicate to him that you would like to spend life as a couple for a good 2-3 years instead of 4-5 years.   It goes down on him better this way.     Well on the 2nd or 3rd year if he pops by to ask you to have baby then tell him that you like this couplehood life which i think he would too and tell him that you wish to extend for another year or so.    The only cons is that, when you want to have baby, you will have to be the initiator.     Bacuase when the burning desire in man to have baby dies, it died. Take it from me. Its a personal experience and i share with all my female friends.     If you miss the chance your husband wants to have baby, you will have to take on the role to be the initiator then. This is never going to be an easy task as he has also tried his best to convince you for as long as you reject him.     The best is to compromise have a time in between and all agreed upon so both of you will be looking forward to it. Couplehood should be a joyous occasion. Ultimately the choice and decision is yours|`|JChTHxeeaa	Yes it is possible.My husband and I have been married for 3 years now and we finally decided to start trying for a baby but some couples wait even longer.
Tj0pqUMraa	Because they play dumb as to not get a real catch like you.. azz clown    SteveC|`|0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	They are hot b/c they focus on making themselves hot for attention, so all the focus goes on there appearance instead of school work.  Make sense?|`|6WfjdZN3aa	cuz they're 2 busy worrying about thier hair, makeup, etc.|`|M1MRM8MRaa	are you really asking this question?|`|OeQbs95Naa	Im like that =( Im very pretty but super dumb but im a very nice person with a big heart so people realy like me (well not girls tough they hate the attention i get). http://photobucket.com/XXxPinkBabyxXX     Oh hey but most girls who are pretty pretend to be dumb cause it makes them look easy and they think its attractive.     Just find a girl who you like in personality. I know not all guys like girls who arent smart. Seriously personality realy does matter and she will become more atractive to you in looks too, then what you use to think about her cause she werent as beautiful and popular. I just think we are all different and we souldnt be judged based on how smart we are or how good looking we are. We should be judged on what we do, how big our hearts are and how we treat other people. My bf treats me like a princess cause i have a caring personality and treat people with respect, he dont judge me based on my iq, he always say my looks is a bonus and thats propably why i love him so much cause he dont just date me for my outside.|`|3192dd71479f39e347fbd4f88c2c90f3aa	Now what would a hot smart girl do? She would continually be disappointed with the hot stupid boys who like her :)|`|b397c83144479c841989b65aede5b9c7aa	i guess its like some kind of rule or something??
e70lDiEPaa	Envy is a waste of time.     Go live your life!|`|AA11900069	Maybe they love her becasue she can PUNCTUATE, AND PARAGRAPH!  Which are two skills seeming to elude you.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Because people like that are the most annoying people in existance    Seriously though, we never see the full story on peopels lives, just see the surface, and the surface is always misleading. How can you be sure these girls really like her, maybe they fall out often and are just using her to make themselves more popular, maybe she puts it about and thats why she has all those fellas gawp at her, her marriage could be a mess, she could be desperatly depressed and just pretends to be happy. All these things we'll never know, so dont be jealous of whats on the surface|`|K60l9Rlnaa	You still sound like your jealous of her. Don't be jealous of other people just worry about your own life and im sure you will have a great life married with kids in time....|`|ZMZzNkuMaa	you have to put urself out there you have to pretend like ur the best thing in the world but know that ur not and u have to put ALL ur GOODIES out there because they can't stay in the jar...
fOc6PB2Oaa	Ill have a Chinese girl please.|`|AA11900069	Race, colour, origin doesn't matter to me.|`|3m0elHd6aa	dosnt make no difference to me   personality matters not looks|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	Don't do what your parents tell you to do, do you what you want.  Personally I like Japanese girls.|`|ifdNUvwbaa	Personality is the best factor when looking for a girlfriend. All different people are attracted to different types of people.     Rate yourself (looks and personality) out of ten.  Then look for a girl who is slightly under your mark.    So if you marked yourself 6/10 then go for a girl who is 4 or 5.    It doesn't matter about race either. If you like a girl and she likes you then go out with her. However, in your case use the rating system to ensure you don't get rejected and end up with a white girl.    Hope I Helped.|`|Bu4aTVAQaa	i prefer boys with longer hair snd personality is everything to me|`|pDwOb2HJaa	i can relate to a certain point, im hispanic but dont relly look like it much ( im mostly spanish tho) my parents want me to go out with white guys (and personaly it doesnt bother me) but wut i wanto say is that race doesent matter,its what  you feel for each other is what relly does. right now im in  happy relationship with (let me say!) a white guy and i adore the guy so much. but im also equally attracted to other races too...
66SwkHPVaa	youre going a bit haywire here. just calm down. it has been a while since you were with somebody but dont let that interfere with your confidence. Just go to a nice wine bar or get involoved with something new eg. learn to ski(!) and youll meet new women there. DOnt join the brotherhood, thats a little extreme. Just give these things time and dont get too worked up. If a gal can see youre not calm then she automatically thinks uh oh. Be open and friendly and hey! at least youre not a male slut!!!|`|AA11900069	Whhhhaaaattt?  paranoid about pregnancy?  There is birth-control available, and if you make it clear to a girlfriend that you don't want children, you will find one with a similar outlook.      What is this brotherhood of which you write?|`|q90ozSQ9aa	The Brotherhood, like on Asians Creed!? MAN! I love that game!!    -greedings from Finland
DFT6tYepaa	That's their problem not yours. Your boyfrieend loves you and that's what counts. Besides, I'm sure they will warm to you eventually, all parents are a bit fussy at first, but when they get to know you, I'm sure things will work out.     Don't let it affect you either, don't be sad. =]|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Thats a fairly typical response. Many parents do not think anyone is good enough for their dear child. I've seen it often in my friends.     Good for your boyfriend standing up for you. Hopefully over time they will realize how special you are to their son and they will change their opinions of you. If not at least your boyfriend knows what he sees in you. I know easier said than done but try to just brush off what they are saying as being over protective parents and don't let their opinions bother you.|`|AA11746917	The fact that your boyfriend shared their thoughts with you, knowing it would be hurtful, is disturbing.|`|0ky4TktEaa	If you're old enough to get married, you're old enough to handle your own business. Don't ever let those people tell you anything about it. If they are secretly whispering to their son to try to get rid of you, find out if he has balls or if mommy has them in a vice grip. If it's the latter, pack your things and get out of the relationship since he clearly won't be making any of his own decisions...ever.|`|Q1SR9Lgfaa	Being able to get along with your boyfriends parents (possibly in-laws) is important to your relationship.  If they don't like you based alone off your looks, then that is ridiculous.  And if this is the case, hang in there and soon they should warm up to your good nature, well educated side.      If this is the worst thing they say about you, but do acknowledge your other positive sides, then maybe they like you but noticed something they are concerned about.  Maybe you weren't feeling well that day and they picked up on it.  It doesn't say that they don't like you because of that, just that they noticed it.      Sometimes people (moms) need time to warm up to who their kids are with.  Keep your head up.  Hang in there.|`|TG2LrbJSaa	look you are beautiful and NEVER LET ANYONE TELL YOU DIFFERENT. oviously you must have some traits that your boyfriend likes or else he would not have introduced you to his parents for marriage... do not let what they may or may not say distract you away from your love. walk with your head held high knowing that you are a wonderful person and you are kind in your heart and they will see this beauty shine and they will feel mistaked about their misjudgement of you. Be happy be in love and enjoy your life with your boyfriend....good luck to you and no matter what  .....YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND IF SOMEONE IS TOO STUPID TO SEE THAT THEN THEY ARE BLIND.|`|Otv585x6aa	Well some people is like jealous or feeling that u like him a lot and he likes u a lot too.  U should be happy who u are what kind of type u are just be ur-self|`|RTYa8h2Saa	Listen, as long as you and your boyfriend love each other, it does not matter what his parents think. Your relationship with your boyfriend is between the two of you, and has nothing to do with what THEY think of you.     Besides, I'm sure that as they get to know you, they will see that you're a great person, and see all the things about you that your boyfriend loves. They're jerks if they judge you just on your appearance! But just give it some time...they will see all the reasons that their son has fallen in love with you. Good luck with your relationship!|`|vubs08yWaa	my boyfriend's parents don't like me because i'm white and 2 1/2 years younger than my boyfriend.    i texted his mom earlier and was like "look, you're going to have to get over it because we love each other and i'm going to be around forever so you'll have to get used to it"    she called me and was like "yeah i realize that now. i'm sorry. i don't have a problem with you anymore."    soo, just tell your boyfriend's parents off.|`|umAMNFQ3aa	it's important to get cool with your boyfriend parents but at the end of the day you are dating him and not his parents and obviously he likes you the way you are......oh and plus they have the right to speak their opinion but they don't have the right to judge you|`|7Lw8mEhJaa	DON'T BOTHER THEM BECOZ YOUR BOYFRIEND LIKES YOU  BUT HELP THEM AS YOU CAN|`|zSBLfEZaaa	I can feel ur pain....  dont worry about...  Is ur guy happy with u?  tat's more than enough...  u can achieve anything with him by ur side.    I had been in this situation...  The thing is... in laws will never be satisfied with ur looks, no matter how much evr u look beautiful, because its just a small possessiveness that their son should marry someone whom they chose. u cant blame them either.... rite?    Pray in these kinda situations.  It helped in mine...  Made me come thro it...    Dont be dis-hearted   come over it....
CaPZrWVWaa	After the ceremony you send the guests to the reception location where they have cocktails and appetizers while you take pictures. 30 min or so.    You're quests are asked to sit during your entrance along with those who stood up for you.    A dinner or lunch usually follow with all of the traditional dances.|`|aY40cuPZaa	good luck on your wedding.  i wanted to have married, but the b...wife said no, so we got married by ourselves.  we married each other 9 times, and we did it all by ourselves.  we got drunk on non-alcoholic wine (joke, ha, ha, ha. the drunk part is.  we take med's that says that we can't take alcohol ).  .|`|6UcJWkUJaa	I work at a country club and have seen a lot of receptions.  If it is small (around 20 people or less) definitely have a nice dinner and some dancing.  Do cocktail tables, not big tables.  Most of all it is your wedding day!  Make it memorable.  Unique weddings are the best weddings!  Do an hour cocktail time.  Hour dinner.  And more cocktails afterwards.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Whatever you do, you need to serve dinner--- or very, very substantial apps (which will probably be more expensive than serving dinner). Cocktail receptions are better for the afternoon hours.|`|JrVhTyLdaa	You will definitely need to have tables and a dinner. Don't forget to include some sort of wedding favors as Thank you gifts for your guests.

LLhmWi2daa	My fiance proposed to me in public and I loved it. He worked at a haunted house and I worked next door. about 11:30 at night when I went over to see him he started to call out on the street for everyone to take notice and did it in full haunted house makeup in front of 20 or so tourists. it was great! he asked me later what i would have done had the answer been no and i said i would have said yes to save him face then told him no later lol but the answer was most defiantly yes!|`|b1xQKDEraa	lets just say, if theres any doubt that your partner would say no, then you shouldnt be proposing. you should propose when your both ready to take that next step, it shouldnt be one sided, marriage is a joint thing. it also depends on what your partner would like. My fiance knows how much my family mean to me, and there was nothing better than being proposed to in front of them, so they could share it with me. if you need to do it alone to be on the safe side, maybe you shouldnt be doing it at all.|`|DqZJ1KOgaa	I think it's far more romantic if he proposes in private. It means he's saying the things to you, and not for anyone else.|`|8HewQkkoaa	I think it depends on the couple, and if its special.  Me and my boy met in Hyde Park, Sydney...and we visit the place we met on our anniversaries.  It would be totally special to me if he were to propose there (in public) or at the place we had our first date or some other place where we've had a special time.  OR if we were on holidays somewhere where everyone else around us where just other holiday goers.    Otherwise Id want it in private. I dont want friends and family there because I want it to be between the two of us. We'll share our wedding with the others, but I want a private memory for us, and a great story to tell people :)|`|58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	My boyfriend WILL propose when it's just the 2 of us there! I'll probably cry and get emotional and I don't want to have to think about what other people are thinking about my tears and how I react.  I just want to think about me and him.  We've talked about it lots of times, so he knows better than to do it in front of other people.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I'm totally pleased that my husband proposed in private - after all, it's a very intimate, special moment.

I know that some have reasons for doing it in front of family and what not but on the Jumbo-tron?   The best things about our proposal was that it was just the two of us for the weekend so we were able to enjoy each other and the enormity of the occasion before sharing it with others.|`|AA11441704	That is why it is should be private.|`|7a8db8d183d13feb7759bd9779e41ee3aa	I would prefer it to be in private.

My fiance proposed in front of some of his family.  Its sad that my family was left out of it and I'm not that close to his family and they are permanently a part of our special day.  I'd have been happier if he had done it privately and let them be the first to know.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I think that should always be a private moment. When you see proposals in public on tv and whatnot, the woman always seems awkward in that she must say a certain thing because all eyes are on her, which isn't right. It isn't romantic when you're uncomfortable and put on the spot either.|`|4d52hvrZaa	yes, private..cause, yea, what if u want to reject them lol it would be so awkward|`|KOYZfaDkaa	I want my boyfriend to propose when we're alone.

Because both he and his girlfriend think it's a good idea.    2. Because the guy thinks that if he proposes in public, the girl can't say no without becoming The Meanie, so he can extort a yes out of her.    3. Because he wants to show off and be the centre of attention.    Edit to add: there's also the fact that most people would rather not hear someone else's proposal. How tacky!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Private.

mOxVL0luaa	public is romantic and it got it negative sign but i'll still go to public tho coz even she said "NO" in front of the people its a good try for me and a good sign to tell her that " i wanna marry u even i lose all my pride in front of people coz u are my everything and idc about myself"|`|sLtmg9xzaa	Definitely not over the Internet.    Both ways are fine, as long the public one is romantic and there is cake in the end.|`|OoaZGumxaa	My fiancee proposed to me in our bedroom in the middle of the day out of no where! He didn't have a ring either! He wanted me to pick it out. Many people say thats wrong but I loved it. I got what I wanted, we agreed on a budget to stick to and it was very romantic to me.

The kids were there, (first trip to Disney) as well as he invited her dad,  stepmom, brother and sister, and his parents and brothers to come as well, so they were all there.  So sweet.  (Then again, they have been together 4 1/2 years and have 3 kids together, so he knew it would be a yes, just had to make it official).  I think it is sweet if a guy goes to the trouble to get the people you love all together for what is the most memorable time in your life.  But only if it is something where you know that there isn't going to be pressure on her, you know she is gonna say yes.  (That should basically be the situation anyway before a guy proposes... no matter if private or public)|`|8rLH4YNsaa	definately private|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Definitely private. More intimacy, and I think it's more romantic without a bunch of nosy people around.|`|GSzQWlccaa	Private, it seems u think your dude is gon propose and you dont want to marry him, well at least not yet!

Wouldn't want tons of people hanging on my word when its something between me and him! :)|`|c9df3bd9f369154d93aaff27c1c3b49aaa	I would prefer a private setting. Something that personal would be difficult for me in a public setting, since I'm not very social. And of course there's also the slim possibility that they say no.    Oh, wait, I'm a guy. So I guess that changes the context a bit for me. I would rather attempt to propose in a private setting, then. But then again, as long as the other person says yes, what the hell does it really matter how or when or where you proposed? Hell, why don't you women start proposing? As long as the answer is yes, what does it matter what the petty details are? Given the option, though, I do admit I'd prefer it to be a private event. But then again, I'd also prefer to.....well....have a girlfriend. :P|`|EsVjwKPAaa	public is too pressured in both parties. lots of hassles.    for me, i would prefer private coz that's your moment. you can tell you feelings w/ each other w/ no interruptions. no pressure!|`|D2g0XSLTaa	private|`|BsvhB4Dzaa	I would defenitly say private.

0b836850a4407fcac4f0677f589e4cd3aa	One of the biggest was when I was sixteen I got my mom her mothers ring. she had hinted to my dad for like 5 years and he was just too thick headed. So I busted my butt and got her one. My older sister was floored.  It wasn't the most expensive but it let my mom know that yes " I do hear you when you speak". Which in itself is a pretty nice gift.

In today's world, the fact that he has waited so long for you is wonderful and proves that he loves you. But sex is a very important part of a relationship. Its how you bond to your partner and get closer to them. Surely you would want to feel as close to your partner as possible before you decided to marry him?|`|b477e184fb7e94143808301cf628005baa	if he loves you enough, he will wait for you. don't compromise your morals because of a guy. good for you for standing up for what you believe in, more girls should be like you :) good luck!|`|7041a3dbd762ecaa432013a7b87b38eaaa	follow your heart. You know whats right for you.    If you are really worried that he would go somewhere else for sex, do you really want to be with him?|`|55c7bd8a9e289aac805bf4dfbffee25eaa	FOR THE FACT THAT I'M MAN ENCOURAGES ME TO ANSWER THAT YOU SHOULD HOLD YOUR GROUND AND DO NOT HAVE SEX AS YOU HAVE PROMISED TILL YOU GET MARRIED.IF REALLY YOUR MAN LOVES YOU, HE MUST RESPECT YOUR STAND AND BEING FAITHFUL TO YOU AS WELL.  PLS ALWAYS REMAIN TRUTHFUL AND FAITHFUL TO HIM AS EVER.THANKS.|`|ccd8b510f25c5c2defba386e56c3f9afaa	Stick with your values!    You know what you want in your heart, and if he REALLY loved you he would respect your beliefs.  Don't worry about him breaking up with you, if this is what he thinks is going to keep the relationship solid, then he doesn't know what it is to be in love with you!    Stay true to YOU!|`|f207c6317a84c06260f03d340c92cadfaa	If he can't stay true to you due to your beliefs and if he cannot respect them by staying faithful, then he is not worth your time.  With true love, you should not have to be worried about if he will cheat on you or not. Keep an eye on him, or just sit him down and tell him this:    "Look, these are my beliefs, and God knows I love you, but if you think you can't stay faithful to me because I'm not giving you what you want, then I suggest you find yourself anothe girl to screw with, because it won't be me."    Don't change your views for anyone.  Keep your belief, and save what you have to offer for marriage.  I'm doing the same.  Hope this helps you, and good luck.

35fdfcc942da772e22a482dd20b5e9b9aa	I have been alone for 40 years now, and it's OK by me.  I have met a few women over the years, and they all turned out to be interested in what I could do for them rather than what we could do for each other.  I have learned that there is really no such thing as true love.  Love is an emotional and physical response at the beginning, and it changes with time.  Often it changes to contempt (as in "familiarity breeds...").  There is no "special girl"...or, if there is, your chances of finding her are essentially nil.  People have such high expectations of their "perfect man/woman", that they are invariably disappointed at some level when reality sets in.  Love is not fair, and neither is life.  We are guaranteed nothing in this life, and the universe owes us nothing.  We are not entitled to anything, either.  It's just the way it is.  As someone who has remained single all these years, having seen friend after friend fall in love, get married and then get divorced, it makes me wonder why anyone bothers anymore.  Of all of my friends, I can say that only one of them remains happily married to this day.  The others are either divorced (some for the second time) or barely tolerate each other.  I have cats, and they make excellent companions.    I am sorry I don't have anything more positive to offer...but in my experience, reality is a lot harsher than fantasy.  You have a lot to give, but the other person has to give in return.  People are a LOT more selfish than they used to be.|`|AA10888522	Love will find you no need to go searching for it in the wrong places, it will find you trust me on that.|`|AA10307468	I understand your feelings man coz i am alone too!|`|AA12378062	AWwwwww..... :o( ..... u got me sad........

I mean I guess being ready to date isn't really about how old you are, but more If you're emotionally ready. If she's mature enough I think its ok.

There is a book - The Idiots Guide to Communicating with the Spirits - the title is goofy, but one of the authors is a well known Artist Medium - her name is Rita Berkowitz.

They are very real.|`|1bae4ad646f3906af4e729aacd4c530caa	No I don't think you are looney, and yes I do believe there are spirits out there.

97fa32e0cdc329ca1b606d4ee47e657caa	Vancouver is a beautiful city. There are great shops, restaurants, and lots of activities, never mind the gorgeous scenery. Granville Island is one of my favorite areas in the city. There are all kinds of galleries there, as well as a brewery, museums, stores, boutiques, and the views are terrific. The Sand Dollar is one of my favorite places for dining when I go there. Stanley Park is a gem in the city, a terrific place to get away from the traffic and people, right in the heart of downtown. Gastown is always good for a day of looking around, and don't leave out Chinatown! There's great nightlife along Robson Street, and you can find plenty of places in the surrounding areas for hiking, cycling, and kayaking. There are wonderful wineries in the outlying areas outside Langley, BC, and the ferry system can transport you over to Vancouver Island, where you can spend a weekend touring Victoria and visiting Butchart Gardens.     I live in Washington state, just across the border from Canada, and when I want to go out for a day of shopping or go to the movies, when I have friends visiting from out of town, it's just a hop, skip and a jump to one of the greatest cities I've ever been to, Vancouver, BC.|`|2df190d28e76f7d188ad956ec64aedafaa	Picc up some Cubans while you are up there and have fun  They are alot more wild then America anyday.

3188f2ccd1ee2dd098305f2e026b68c4aa	The young lady probably did like you but you did not respond to her flirting, she may think that you are not interested and moved on.

It's your turn to flirt back!!|`|e1549b7fed4178b452308417af284e61aa	Ok Dude she's probably tired of waiting ont you to ask her out! do me and you a favor and ASK HER OUT ALREADY! geez she liked you and the only way your going to find out if she still does is by asking her out!|`|b9c7ce4af7bfad356df7527da85e9c55aa	If you are both together in a a class (again), try to pick up where you left off! If things are still fun and flurty, try saying a few more words to her if you pass her in the hall or something, like a one liner, or teasing her. I girl won't talk to you if she doesn't want to. In this case, she still says "hi..." so she does remember you.    If you're not getting the same vibe as last year she may have moved on. In that case...  take a deep breath...and move on, but don't be bumed out! Have a blast with your other friends in class, and she might just see what she is missing !

93b53c5ba37275697d1cbc9be5932cd1aa	Just try to let him go. Telling you to forget him would be stupid, because you won't. You care about him and you still think of him. But try to think about some other guys you meet and how wonderful they are. Eventually you may grow to like them enough that your former relationship will fade to nothing more than a memory. I think that trying to get back together is a bad idea. I may be wrong about that, but it's my opinion.    Good luck. There are plenty of great guys out there!|`|30bdde65abd34ded4cb0e396c36c0ca2aa	I know where you are coming from. I dated this guy over a year ago, and it lasted about 3 weeks...I was the one to end it, which I regret now.    It's tough that he is not responding to you. That makes it harder to try and be "casual" and start things up again. If you see that he is online, I would deffinatly try and talk to him. If he doesn't respond, wait a week or so, and maybe try again then. Just don't push it TOO much, or you will look desperate.    The best hope, since you go to the same university, is to meet him in person. Not like a 'set time' kind of deal, just like if you see him in the library or something, try and make casual conversations, like you are just normal friends. If you are willing to take things slow, and let him slowly "come back" to you, I think you could make things work.    Good luck!

It is best for you get on with your life and if it meant to be you will find each other again.  I know that it is difficult to let go and there will always be a part of you that thinks fondly of him.  But I promise that it does get easier as time goes on and eventually, when you find someone else, you will realize that although he was great, there was a reason that it didn't work.|`|7e2888fdd54e234a877eb1a38b728075aa	So he used to say hi and now he doesnt anymore?  I think it would be best to get on with your life, and ignore him.  Some boys come around if you leave them alone.  But you should honestly look at him as a stepping stone to the right guy.  You gained some insights and knowledge by being with him, now the next guy will give you more and so on and so on until you meet the right one, your soul mate.  Go from one experience to the other with a happy outlook.

A little relationship like this probably doesn't mean anything to him. Especially since he's more experienced than you. The best thing to do is move on. And no it wouldn't be desperate of you to IM him once. But if you constantly IM him he will probably try to avoid you. Don't act clingy. Another way to get over him, meet someone new. Go on dates.

412858370a4e8ab571eea3e7bde38ec8aa	Yea actually i have and it just so happends that it was my mom as well. It's rough and no, no one will no exactly what you're going through. I didn't seek any professional help to deal with it mostly out of stubborness and the fact that i luckily found and kept some amazing friends when i was at college. Trust me dealing with this sort of thing and making your way through college is not easy. It sounds like you're doing the same thing that i did. I just kept myself so busy so i didn't have to deal with it. Eventually it caught up to me. I had to deal with my mother who had pretty much forced me out of her life through her actions and capacity for cruelty. My friends finally made me see that it wasn't me and that it was her that had the problem, that i can't change her, and that it was only hurting me and continually disrupting my life by trying to make things workout and being the "bigger" person. I'm not sure of your situation and how much it really relates but i can tell you this i eventually stopped contact with my mom and it was the best decision i made. The hardest but the best. I was always of the thinking that family is everything and that you stick by them through thick or thin etc... well that isn't always the truth b/c no one deserves to be treated like they don't exist or be taken advantage of especially by family members who know you're susceptable. I have since come to the conclusions in life that 1) nobody is a permanent fixture, the only people you need in your life are those that need you and treat you well. 2) Family are those that you choose not necessarily the ones that you're provided with. Friends usually fall into this category. I can tell you for sure that i had similar thoughts as you but my friends pulled me through it and regardless of whether i know them till i'm 90 or not they were and will always the ones that got me through it. The best thing i can say is don't expect them to understand pr replace the relationship with your mom, but if they're willing they can be a great support system, and sympathetic ear as long as they're willing and care about you that's all you'll need is someone to listen to vent and release your fears, stress, and insecurities. I would also definately suggest seeking some professional counseling campuses usually have them provided through the health centers, and they're totally discreet and if i had it to do over again i would def have talked to someone like that in addition to my supportive friends. You've probably dealt with growing up quickly and feeling independent like i did, your friends will also not necessarily understand that either. What you need to focus on is finishing school, and getting through your own life. It's important for you. I just graduated college this fall and am doing grad school, so if i can do it so can you. Good Luck, hope this helped you out|`|0eda52b8cf9a0eb73c4ee751654a66d7aa	This is probably one of the most painful things a person can go through, yes it does happen, and its impossible for people who haven't gone through this to understand,  to all you parents out there who are cold and unloving towards your own children, please know that this kind of hurt lasts a lifetime! And unfortunatly the poor children think that its their fault they are always looking for the reason why the people who brought them into this world, the people who are supposed love and protect them and always be there for them just dont care. I think one of the things you can do is to always make sure no matter what , that your children never feel that pain!|`|319e4c1fe311011f6d90cd2896a7ba84aa	your mother must have been hurt by your relationship with your ex.

AA11126650	I know this sounds boring, but just be yourself.  If it's meant to happen it will happen.  It's a logic that comes with age and experience, but if he doesn't like you best in the first place, it's not worth it.    You shouldn't have to fight for a guy's attention... He should be fighting for yours!|`|d3defc656e3dd905be27c8f2bdd650adaa	In my opinion, you should just do things that he likes but in the same token, things that you enjoy as well. For example, if he likes rollerblading, go to a roller rink with him. Just show him that you really like him and are prepared to take your friendship to the next level. Remember that this is only my opinion.

AA10698363	i have a 4 prong princess sut.  Got it at a store called robbing bros, which, if I bring it in every six months for inspection, will cover my diamond's replacement if it is lost.  So...  have your fiance get her ring checked out every once in a while so it doesn't become loose.  4 prong is pretty.  And congratulations|`|49e67a93e4e4c4cbc2efd7f53464911caa	Dose she  like  it?   thats  all  that counts.|`|8b9d10d1075052b40766489376f2dc3eaa	The value is in the quality of the diamond.Not the number of the prongs.The real value here is the Love behind the ring.Don't worry about the ring so much.If in the future you both don't like it.The ring can always be refitted.|`|AA11089960	oh, its so cute how you're fretting over this...what a lucky girl you have.  Anyway, my ring has 4 prongs, and the diamond falling out has never been a problem.  It's never even really snagged on anything.  If it's from a reputable diamond dealer/jewler, then it should be fine at four prongs.  Also consider getting it insured through your homeowner's insurance.  Congratulations and good luck!|`|569202b98ddf361f85c3b2a9bc26c452aa	forget the prongs  how big is the rock and is it real. usually the more prongs there are then the smaller the rock....|`|AA10588267	the prongs are only there for holding whatever size stone it is if shes happy with it then leave it be dont worry about taking it back|`|c946d9d1d992aa08ebe8732aceb620a1aa	I don't think you should worry so much. If she really loves YOU, then the ring should not make that much difference either way! Mine only has 4 prongs on it and it is fine. It was also bought at a pawn shop for about 1/3 of what it is worth. I don't see what the big deal is, but then again I'm not hung up on material things either. If the 2 of you are really "in Love," then save your money for more important things and buy really nice ring(s) later in life. Besides, what you bought sounds nice enuf to me.

AA10092543	I have had both and there really isn't much of a difference when it comes to intercoarse.

Non-circumcised...much less friction...higher risk of infection due to sweat and dirt build up in fold.|`|2fa2e224702ecf3c775b23d335665f3faa	I prefer circumcised but it is solely for the appearance.

I would say it's gross because the uncircumcised penis' collects dirt underneath the skin folds & if you would do it with them, they might pass it on to you and you can get a disease from it, possibly a pelvic inflammatory disease.

5dd48df95bd68447ae1be5ff0417d737aa	I'm in exactly the same situation. The distance thing is too unbearable...we are about 1000 miles away, and we known each other for a about a year . Last nite I tried breaking up...but even that is too painful...because I am close to her, as much I try to be logical...    I guess it depends on how you feel...even now I'm still confused as what to do... Its like I don't want to hurt her but if I stay with her longer I might end up hurting her later... And later on it will be unfair to both of us for having spent so much time together and it didn't work out.    If you really feel that maybe you don't feel for him as much as you do, then before it gets to painful for either of you, step up and tell him how you feel. Its better to get it out, because at least then the other person knows that this can be problem or its the reason why. If you do break up with him, just tell him that the distance thing is unfair for both of you, and you want to a reationship to progress but that won't happen if you both are not together. Tell its easier now to do this than spend so much time trying to make it work and then it doesn't.    Hope your problem finds a suitable ending for both of you. Hope there is little hurt as possible. Good luck.|`|AA12208596	Just be honest.

If the distance is the only reason, who knows he might consider living near you. But If you have fallen out of love, don't ever use distance as an excuse, it would just add up the hurt.|`|4e6ec39860032fc5b68acb8373480f0faa	Its unfair to him if dont say anything.

Good luck|`|d260bc686163bd683753401bf36cf957aa	Distance doesn't have to break a relationship.  I know because I am in a long distance relationship that has gone on for years.  The distance is shortening soon (this year) and the relationship is solid.    NOW, if you're ready to try new things and meet new people, you'll have to decide if these new things also include a new boyfriend/lover/luv-hunk.  If you don't see things working out, then try to explain to yourself what things you don't see working.  Maybe distance is just an excuse to cover up the fact that you're afraid to just admit that you're incompatible, or that he's boring, or that his toenails are too long, or something.  This doesn't make you rude or shallow.    As far as how to do it?  First decide if it's something you really want to do, and then if you decide that it is, then the best way to break up with him is honestly and gently, but don't be a pushover and take him back just because he begs you to, if he begs.|`|AA10900216	if i was you and you feel your feelings are not there any more then i would break off the relationship cos long distance dont ever work one of you two are going to cheat on the other 1 trust me!!!!!!

I think you made a good decision moving. Many women get too comfortable with a man and end up in a rut, and wasted years.  Get out, meet new people, try new things, and enjoy yourself.  When the time comes you'll know what to say and do.  Who knows maybe your move will be just the thing to spark your relationship with this guy.  Whatever the case, enjoy life and everything will fall into place naturally. Mo|`|AA12346188	Make him understand, your friendship is not going to lost for ever. Speak to him or send him emails.

Questo non  il modo di amare una persona!!!   Non PRETENDENDO di farlo!!!  L'amore deve essere una cosa complice tra due persone, e se lui lo vuole fare solo per "deliziare il suo regale augello" nonostante tu non voglia, beh, non  l'uomo che fa per te!!! Fidati! Ti prego, sii sincera e smetti di soffrire per le sue voglie, fai un passo avanti e urlagli in faccia BASTA non sei un oggetto di piacere da usare quando lui ne ha voglia!!! non  questo il modo di trattare con una ragazza!!! Spero che tu sappia cosa  meglio fare per te...

If she walks next to you, don't take the headphones off & only 1/2 answer her questions.

As for taboo, I believe both are, but age really is just a number therefore as long as a person is happy and in a healthy relationship, then who cares about age difference no matter how great or small.|`|ae3e1243969cb203908a0b52e9da0cd6aa	well i am married to a guy 8 yrs older to me and once was with a guy 4 yrs younger,  age doesnt matter its the person that does. its not a taboo any more every one that i know of has accepted that age is but a number.  as for me i learned no matter how old a man is iin his heart he will always be a boy.|`|AA11974917	I was in the service and far from home...I learned alot from this woman, about life and sex!

Been together for almost 8 years.  Can't say its been an easy ride but I don't think we would still be together had we been closer in age.  I needed a "real man" to whip me into shape so to speak....I truly wouldn't be the person I am today if it weren't for him.  He helped me out of my shell...urged me to go back to school....urged me to look for a better job.  Its worked out pretty well I think for both of us.|`|AA12038239	Yes, I fell in love with a man 11 years younger than I am(we are over 30) It wasn't something I set out to do cause I always thought I wanted an older man but, it didn't happen quiet like that. I relate better with the younger crowd I guess cause I have such a great relationship with my 3 kids.

And I also learned that we are all entitle to change and that we want to change we will.  I also learned that I can be a real b**** when my man crosses the line. Would I do it again hmm... maybe, maybe not who knows. I did get a surprise an engagement ring! It doesn't get any better than that besides we've been together for  eight years it was bout to happen anyway!|`|4a2494571ce90d8cd9f95932b94b2c6daa	I married a guy 4 years younger than myself but thats not huge age gap - the reason I believe older women go for younger men is that women reach their sexual peak later in life whereas men reach it much earlier so they attract each other for sexual reasons|`|2592731056d68cd57e76207f5ea9e4dfaa	My man is 5 yrs younger than me and im 35,,not a big deal at all.

5a879c515f89dfae658d75bd124c386caa	I think that if he is brave enough to talk to other people like that about you to protect you then he definitely likes you, approach him about dating and see what happens.  IM me and tell me what happens. Good luck girl!|`|AA11646751	It sounds like he may be liking you more.but now he has just showed you that hes going to be there for you.now you no that you have somone to protect you.Dont fall for him so fast where in the end you might be the only one getting hurt.take it slow!!.dont rush.you have lots of time!.|`|aab6d45ef643f5bb900ae86855dfafccaa	Sure seems like he is changing the way he feels you.......I guess that is a good sign|`|f08983e7b1428fad39d1829704866807aa	It seems like he's shy.    He won't seem to interested/talk unless he knows that you're interested in him.  By starting that conversation, you showed interest and he is just now acting on it.    He hasn't changed, you just found a way in!    I'm pretty sure he likes you; he is defending you, which would not happen if he didn't care.    Best wishes with your new friend :)|`|fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	Sorry about the jerk but on the bright side, your crush was willing to step up for you. He's protective of you meaning one of threethings. He was raised to always protect a lady's honor or two, that he's interested or that it's both. That's a good sign if he is doing it because he's interseted or both as he's a gentleman. Sounds like he's interested in you. All the staring and you catching him staring is another sign that he's interested. Talk with him some more in real life and get to know him a little better first. You can say thank you. Hope it all works out.|`|24fcef8edf039e3b42de30f1aaa0b45daa	I don't know but maybe but you should not act any different then you are. I think he just got use to being to get to talk to you online so he feels comterble to be able to talk to u.|`|1efbd7d8028382cee242126e1bce5cdcaa	Everybody feels better talking online to eachother but in like face to face its kinda hard and mayb when he talks to you face to face he doesnt wanna get embaressed or something i think he really likes you.|`|d5aab8b7b84ca8374ee0c18b5acb0d63aa	im sure he does like you just go for it girl if you like him then go for it see how it works out for you|`|abc729c981514a7dfa3208df32ad7cecaa	Does it matter WHY he's changed? He obviously is interested in you. Hope you like protective guys 'cause that's what you got, girl. This means that you have your foot in the door with your crush. Time to celebrate!!!|`|AA11408083	that would depend on what he said and how he said things when he approached you.  due to the fact that you now broke the ice in your communication barrier, it is possible that he had gained confidence in approaching you this time.   yes, he might also have a crush in you, but beware!!! if he is a little bit too confident about himself in the way he presents himself to you, and his topics would be a little bit offensive, he could be another jerk that may ruin your life.  the best thing about relationships (whether they be friends or crushes), be more observant in their behavior towards you. it is the best way to know how you would react to every word he makes, and for every move he makes.    take care!! =)

AA11850056	Just from the few examples you've given, it's my opinion your fiancee is more than a little self centered and selfish. Personally, if you're seeing this kind of attitude from him now then you can expect this to only get worse after you're married. I think  you have to ask yourself if despite your love for him can you see yourself in a long term relationship where your husband is more interested in his own happiness than in yours.|`|AA11707323	Loving him alone is not enough.  If he doesn't take your feelings into consideration then you will become very resentful over time.  You must fix this before you marry.  You deserve to be happy too.  He needs to understand that the world doesn't revolve around his needs only.  He is being selfish and he needs to change that.|`|AA11918870	I'm in the same boat, it's like we are already married, huh?  I have been thinking about counceling, maybe this is an option?

hTRJFA4Jaa	Yes, love isn't just fancying someone.    Love is when you truly connect. You enjoy the things they enjoy, and not just because you and her say you both do.    Love is when you can stay with someone forever and not get bored of their company.    It's unlikely she hasn't "liked" anyone per se, but to have not loved anyone is something that can happen.|`|d07797575b9836110677f24a37896268aa	yes of course, normally it happens after a relationship has broken down, and you just can't be bothered with the opposite sex.|`|AA11441704	not true|`|IWRKbpVGaa	There have been stages I have not had anyone that I liked.

AA10227109	don't write it in a email or letter if your don't want to ruin your friend or possible relationship ...because if his current girlfriend finds it that will bring to much drama...just tell him on the phone when his girl is not around or in person...the best policy is no evidence...and this way it will not destroy everything if he does not feel the same way|`|4802ef2542b6dfbcdcee5b6d8a11a039aa	Dont do it    Please dont    If you really love him you would want him to be happy ... and if he's happy with her then you should be happy on his happiness ... it's too selfish to be thinking only about ur happiness not his ...    Besides ... it always happens: What u do to others happens to u too ... If u're doing it ... Be ready for someone to do this to u also...    If that guy can leave his girlfriend for u ... he can also leave u for someone else !!!|`|4192dd5f03afcb1f4e208fdade8a1fe5aa	ye Its better u tell him what u feel and he will surely respond. u just mention what u feel about him in the email.

I have to agree with Dublin. You are aweful. I know you can't help your feelings for this guy, but he has a girlfriend. Have you ever stopped to think, what if he loves her, do you know how much it would hurt this other girl to know another woman has her man in her clutches? I have been with my b/f for over a year now, he is the love of my life, not to mention very hot. I have problems with girls like you constantly. They are always trying to get with them, and it pisses me off more than anything in this world! If I could get ahold of them I would straight up kick their ***, not to mention yours! I hope your not one of the hoes trying to get with my man. God bless that guy's girlfriend. I bet she looks better than you anyhow lol.|`|AA11820856	Well personally if I was in love with my current flame and you were beautiful and hot and wrote me a provocative email I would be flattered unbelievably.

Make sure you include a picture, that does wonders|`|52c6efd2a28acae483cd9a08949f7789aa	you shouldn't write this email,he has a girlfriend. ho would you feel if you were in her place|`|30d2b22486b442dc3bd6c47b403023d8aa	If i were in ur shoes, i will let him know how i feel.

e7ed58b1d2d49cbe25310d3a823c36a7aa	Just make sure you really honestly like her and realize the risks involved in telling her that you like her and then determine if you're willing to lose her friendship for the sake of getting into a relationship with her. Sometimes its just best to not say anything and to move on. But don't forget, sometimes the closest of friends make the best lovers. So go for it, if she means that much to you, and be completely honest about it.|`|fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	If you really like this girl and you want to have a girlfriend boyfriend relationship, the only way is if you tell. While it is taking a risk, if it's really worth it you have to confess your feelings. Regardless of what  you choose, good luck. If it helps, I'm still friends with girls I've told I liked before. You just have to act like nothing happened and it is all good. Good luck again.|`|639bc1f0d656cdba5499cfb1b1e23ee6aa	for me i will try joking say u love her n playing wit her try talk more n hear wat she ans u , if she ans nth special n like normal then wait another day say seriously tat u love her , she she reject u say u just joking onli dun make it serious  good luck

d6cf496a21622df5961f84184be182a1aa	I've always tried to avoid inter-political relationships, since I happen to be intensely passionate about some political issues. Overall, I would say it depends on the couple. Are they extremists when it comes to politics, or could each one handle the other's opinions and views? Unless you KNOW the other person shares your views and you can get along, I think anyone in a relationship would do well to tread lightly on this topic, especially with today's political situations.

I would think of him as a very caring father showing responsibility as father and having fun and enjoying his kids.    In one since of the word, the way you have worded your question, it is like you are trying to use the kids to attract a woman and that is totally wrong. I didn't say that you did that but that is what it sounds like.    Since I can't send you a messages to answer your email to me. I didn't mean any thing bad here.

ca7a7042d63892172ad7c945d91b78e4aa	I think if a couple watches it together for entertainment sake then fine but if a person is watching it alone or often then that could indicate some issues. Porn is for entertainment value only .... it should not be seen as the end all be all for educational purposes. Porn is usually surreal and not based in reality in terms of depicting good examples of real life long lasting relationships. That is the problem with teens watching porn IMO. They get the wrong idea about what love is and what a loving relationship consists of.|`|c06d6ced72fd3f1ac9c100812f9f1a26aa	it's a turn on lol..but i mostly laugh my @ss off when i watch tapes..every time i go to my friend's house and watch tapes, we laugh our a.sses off!! we go "dude her boobs are so small" or if the guy has a white dick and black balls (lmao i've seen that b3fore).. i mean wouldn't you laugh?? but then again..many agencies kidnapp girls and rape them and make them do tapes..so it's hard to say..if a girl choses to do it, it's fine..if she's forced into it..then no..|`|b6fdc89aedfa9fee88b8adf64245fae8aa	Depends on the porn.

If not then I would suggest you gave this up, but make sure you get any deposit back, and look for somewhere else with someone who doesn't have so much baggage.  If you lived with this person you would end up regretting it.|`|4beaf671b28d4ea85ce401d3af24b2fcaa	Sounds like a circus lady comes to town brings all her butch friends about. Shes unstable for 1 you cant have more than 1 family dwelling. That means If you sign a contract with her and it states 1 family dwelling or to the appointed people are only allowed a female and a male person. You need to talk to a lawyer. It sounds a bit fishy. I think next time dont get involved with people that are unstable Its like letting a BB King kid run a high class company they dont have the education or the senority. Do some research. Good Luck

Don't.    If you force yourself to look sad long enough for them to ask, you'll actually mentally have a hard time stopping and you can slip into depression.    After I was done and satisfied, I noticed I was constantly feeling sad and couldn't stop.    I told my doctor and he said I had developed depression.    It was horrible, and I had done it just so someone would notice I was sad.    You should rather just walk along normal and be happy with someone else.|`|P3pJnwpWaa	take a knife and cut yourself everywhere. sad people AlWAYS cut themselves. maybe you'll even pass out from lack of blood!!|`|31sPPNpTaa	I don't understand your problem?

Your eyes will go a little bit red and watery and then they will know.    Be careful not to get onion juice on your clothes or you might smell like a hot dog stand. For that reason it might be wise to take the sniff, then put the onion away, and wash your hands before going into the class.    If you have hairs in your nostrils a sharp tug on them will induce the same effect.|`|PyUDK9IGaa	livejournal.com|`|sLtmg9xzaa	You mope around until they eventually ask, because they want to know.|`|JaOddaodaa	stop suddenly in between a dance practice session, and sit and start crying..................|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	Teenagers go through these feelings and chances are the person already knows.|`|jYMlAN4Paa	Umm..yes you are asking for attention.

The terms friend and friendship mean different things to different people and different things to the same people at different times.

In spite of friendship's vague and seemingly indefinable quality, friendships contribute in important ways to psychological development and health and well-being from early childhood through the older adult years.

This property in question was given to you by your father & that too after two years of marriage. The title of this property must be in your name or there must be some record showing the property stands in your name only & not in joint name with your wife. Considering all these facts & the legal position ,your wife has no right over this property, however she can always seek relief as far other rights I have mentioned here so be careful about those.|`|jp5lfmzTaa	SELL YOUR HOUSE BEFORE THE DIVORCE PETITION, TAKE THE MONEY AND STASH AWAY  - YOU BLOODY FOOL?

My query is, was this the same property where you brought your wife after marriage? if yes, then this is a matrimonial house and she has a right on it. If No, then this claim can be contested that its the In-law's property and as per SC's ruling in Batra vs Batra, a daughter in law, does not have any right on the In-law's property.     My dear friend (the Lawyer) who has replied to you before me might be interested in this topic too. What he says is also right. But he would also agree that we need more clarity on your situation. right brother?|`|tqJeFCYZaa	What are the laws. Check it out. I got burned before because I didn't check the laws.|`|lfQHjp5baa	Marital property is generally considered to be all property acquired by a couple during their marriage or earned by either spouse during their marriage. It is all property owned by the marital estate. Generally, gifts or inheritances to either spouse along with any money or property earned prior to the marriage are the separate property of that spouse unless it is somehow "converted" into marital property.    In most states, the character of the property in question is determined by the nature of the property itself, the nature of the event giving rise to the need for the particular characterization of property ownership, and the manner, agreement, and instrument by which it was acquired. If the event giving rise to the need for the characterization is divorce, a set of rules will apply to each portion of the marital property, depending on how it was acquired and what kind of property it is: bank account, primary home, automobile, real property, etc.    To be sure, consult your attorney for specific legal advice in your specific matter......
J6IUshdYaa	I could give you the typical self-righteous answer, however it's trite in my opinion. I think, if you truly love her ad have waited this long, I believe that it's in your best interest to sit down and talk to her, ask what her true intentions are. If she says she loves you, tell her that you need her, but completely and you no longer want to share her. If she doesn't leave him, TRY to move on, and give her some space. This usually causes people to miss what they once had. Sometimes you have to play passive-agressive to get what you truly desire.|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Dang. Someone with no brains.

Is it really all that?    Do you not have it in you to want someone to call your own, your very own?    She is only trying to calm the situation down by doing what she is and he doesn't have any moola. How can you trust her? I mean, after all, she is a cheater right? If she loved you, you would have all of her and she would not lie to you.  Just like women and married men, the same goes for men and married women....you are truly eating off of the crumbs of their spouses.    Are you not worth ALL of her time? Tell her that this is what you want and see what she does...she doesn't seem to mind "hurting" you. Why be second?|`|iOqmoIrcaa	If she moved out, then they are separated.  And she was having an affair with you and married him.  That should have told you something right there.  If they have been together 8 years, she was well aware of his financial habits long before she married him.  There will be no divorce.  You are her plaything, nothing more.  If you want a significant other, then you need to be moving on.  She told you that she can't leave him but wants him to leave her.  Did you not think the same applies to you?|`|iblT1HJpaa	How many times do you have to read / hear about adultery and affairs to know that they are not good.   This woman has no ethics, no honor and is not only lying to you, but to her husband, children and family over this affair.   Is this the kind of woman you really want as a "wife"?   Think again. If she is willing to do it to her current husband, she will do it to any husband for this is her character. She is fully selfish and will do ANYTHING to please herself - screw all of you!   Guess what? You're next.|`|2MVG5StDaa	Personally i think she is just using you for whatever.  I wouldn't put up with this from any woman no matter what.      If i were you i'd just lay it on the line and tell her she either divorces the other guy and marry's you.  Or she can go live with her husband and stay out of your life.

So she's doing all she can right now to keep you from doing that.  I can tell you from experience, if you were to change your tune and not talk about leaving her anymore, all the extra special things she's been doing lately will soon stop, and everything will go back to the way it was before.  She's comfortable with it, so why change it?  A lot of women wont make the first move to end a marraige because they harbor some hope that their husbands will come back and reconcile.  If she WANTED to get away from her husband, she would have already done it.  Sounds like you are just a boy-toy.|`|UOmhBNxKaa	It just amazes me that 2 people who are both obviously void of any conscience, moral character or ethics eventually question the other persons intentions.

Some children are fortunate enough to get to live in a truly caring, loving foster home, but then again, I say "some".  I have known and know children/people who were in foster homes, and I also know women who served as foster Mothers and did a damn good job of it, and I also know of women who just did it for the money and then there are those "B(s)" that still do it for that same reason (there will be a judgment).  In most cases before children are placed in foster homes, relatives are contacted to see if they will care for the children and I find it so harsh a reality that Family doesn't hold the weight it held back in the day.  Those poor little souls, have to keep each and everyone of them in prayer, constantly.  God Bless.

Just get out and meet people or meet people online and see if you can make friends with someone close to where you live.    Don't be afraid to try and speak English, people will understand that you don't know the language well and give you a chance.|`|EsVjwKPAaa	doesn't matter if your english is bad. talk to your office mates, anyways, after the long run you will perfect your english. so, don't worry.|`|a1436d6dcfdc775dce0296b51f7c127aaa	Don't be afraid to talk to people just because you think your English isn't so good. Don't let language hinder you from making any friends. Just talk to the people you work with, to your neighbors, to the deliveryman. If you think you need practice, then practice by talking to real people. I'm sure you'll have lots of friends in the future.
YWUjeTnUaa	Take the pictures to a store that will help you scan them and put them on disks, or purchase a printer/scanner and do it yourself. If there are a lot of pictures, the second option would be cheaper. You could scan all of the pictures then burn them all to disks and everyone would have a copy of them all.|`|EsVjwKPAaa	go to a photoshop then ask them, they will help you..    also, there is this thing that they will do, i just don't know how they call it. they will scan the pictures and resize them into small pieces then they will form your friends face. then have it framed.     hope this will help.

7iEk06aDaa	Your being a normal, protective dad. I think that if it makes you that uncomfortable, may your seeing or feeling some sort of warning of things to come. The rash is something you should definitely mention no matter what. Be assertive when you tell him to stop because she shouldn't be getting a rash just from some neck nuzzling. He's either doing it too hard, or she's allergic to any kind of aftershave he might use. Regardless, though, if your uncomfortable with it, tell him to back, off.|`|CHCPnvksaa	I wouldn't worry about it too much. It just sounds like your dad is a very loving grandfather. If this is his first grandchild, he's probably showering her with love because he hasn't had a baby around in a very long time. Even if it's not his first grandchild, babies just seem to bring out the best in older people. Right now, your baby is his pride and joy, so let them have their fun. When I first read your question, i thought you were going to say that you dad was a molester, but he sounds like a wonderful grandpa! The rash on her neck is probably from facial hair or stubble. It's best to just let him know that she gets a rash and he needs to stop. Maybe suggest that he make the noise on her belly instead. She'll laugh just as much and the skin isn't as sensitive.|`|d1d43c8be7b4dd12bd1e7e90583bbe5eaa	I hear ya Dude ... and I know what you're sayin' ... you have to tell your dad that all the attention makes her "hyper" and she doesn't settle after he leaves ... the rash thing could be that she's allergic to his aftershave or something as simple as whisker rash if your dad hasn't shaved that day ... I'm sure he just does it cause he loves his granddaughter ... you just need to tell him in the kindest way to ease up a bit ... Good Luck :-)|`|onbwN4csaa	You had not mentioned weather you have a sister. If not  all parents would have loved to have a boy and a girl. To enjoy  the experience of both. I would have.enjoyed it.  This may be the daughter he never had. But now is able to experience what it's like and enjoys being with her.  Grand parents are not like parents.  Grand parents have the time and the knowledge. To see and enjoy  there grand child as they are. With out the responsibility or the need for discipline That's up to the parent.  Also there not with them all the time. So they make the best of the time they do have with them.|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	wow - reading this I thought I was reading my own story.. except I have an 18 month old son and it's my father-in-law that overcrowds him.  He is constantly in his face.  There was once a time where my son was on his lap while we were all watching t.v. (my family was over as well) and he was kissing/pretend biting his neck and somehow managed to get his earlobe in her mouth and had it there for a few seconds before I said "ok, lets get my son's ear out of your mouth please" and he laughed and I tried to make light of it, but I thought it was so strange!  My father-in-law is completely obsessed with my son and we're actually having problems with it now.  Ugh... enough about me though.  My advice to you is that if something makes you feel uncomfortable - even if not intended by your dad -  then just end it.  When he's over and you think he's too much in her face, then just take her away and change the subject.  I think he will notice it and might just see what you are hinting towards without anyone having to say a word or make anyone feel awkward.  Best of luck!!!  (to both of us!)    oh, and if I were you, I would NOT talk to your dad about this.  That would be like opening a can of worms that do not need to be opened.  Trust me!!  It would be uncomfortable for both parties and he would be so hurt.  I would try to "show" him how your feeling without having to say it out loud.|`|haCssg2Laa	and welcome to the world of PARENTHOOD      NOTHING prepares you for how you feel about this tiny little wrinkly mite, NOTHING    and as they grow, so does the love, and the overwhelming feelings that come with this little person, what you are feeling is not rational, but completely normal, she is YOUR little girl, and you want  to be the male figure in her life, that she loves, and looks up to, and your father seems to be hogging the limelight in your eyes    I was Daddys little girl, and didnt really get on so much with my mother, and my gran, was the biggest mentor in my life, she sadly died when i was 25, and a mother myself, and still i miss her, and her influence, not only on me, but my children too,   an attentive loving grandparent is worth EVERYTHING, a littley gets so much from them, that stands them in good stead, and stays with them forever, HOWEVER, it has no bearing on how i look back on my Dad, his influence on my life was HUGE, and has no bearing on my childhood with my Grans time, Looking from here, as a fully grown adult? It means i had double EVERYTHING, double love, double time, double learning etc etc    Nothing can sever the ties between and loving Daddy and his little girl, think how special you feel, because she is yours? let your dad feel the same, let him be the grandpa he so wants to be    and be glad your little girl is growing up, surrounded by so much love, many many children never know how that feels, isnt that so sad?|`|1Df04dWaaa	if ur daughter doesnt have a problem with it, then she is fine, she must not think he is overcrowding her. hes only trying to be a great grandpa too her. he thinks she deserves it. but if u think he does go overboard just tell him to tone it down a LITTLE. its the least he can do to make u feel more comfortable about it.|`|U0D5MXQjaa	like you said your father just loves her, and watch out he sounds like he loves her a lot he'll probably end up spoiling her =)|`|D2g0XSLTaa	This is all very strange.   What I would do is get a video camera and record your dad everytime he comes over and smothers your daughter.  Tape him the entire time.  Then you can go back and look at the tape and see if your daughter is uncomfortable.    If he is doing what you say he does, he will look like an idiot on film and his behavior will look unacceptable.  Play it over and over.  Maybe if he sees what he is doing he will stop it.  Some people don't realize they are acting like a fool sometimes until they see it for themselves.|`|u7bxSrtKaa	talk to your dad.  i know its going to be uncomfortable, but maybe you should sit him down and talk anyway.  you want your relationship with your father, but your blocking him out and its only going to get worse unless you say something.    start out with "dad, i know this is going to sound strange, but i feel a uncomfortable when you are constantly crowding in on the baby. i know im probably overeacting, but i would feel better if you backed off a little bit." - or something along those lines.  maybe tell him you're a new dad, and know he must have felt the same back then, and you know he will understand.      good luck!

Fs4fAwfwaa	I think you have got 2 options:    1. Seek marriage counseling and get to work on your problems. I guess there are some things between you that havent really been resolved yet, can you think of something?    2. Cut your losses and save what can be saved. But I would think about talking with your daughter about it first. It helps to involve her in the decision process. (if she is old enough)    Generally it boils down to the question if there is still hope for you two. You already got that one right. But you should take the time to sit back and try to leave out your emotions as far as possible and try to see thing rational. Maybe have a couple days away from hometo sort things out or something like that.    You should know that marriages can be saved and even in the most devestated relationships there is hope if both, wife and husband, are willing to work on your past.    One thing thats important no matter what decision you make is that it takes 2 people wreck a marriage. Even if you get a divorce it is crucial for your future relationship to find out what led to this and what you personally could have done better.    All the best and god bless ya!

Its wrong for anyone to ask you to leave him just like that.. give it a chance.. not one.. more.. but stop if you feel there is no hope. Best thing you can do is tell him how you feel and see how he takes it...if he is genuinely nice he will understand.. give him sometime. If he is innately as you say he is then time to tell him so and move on. Listen to your heart and do what you think is right.

Once you have decided what to do then you tackle the BF.  If you decide to exercise your choice and have an abortion, i don't think he needs to know.  he betrayed you, he has feelings for someone else. i know its hard but you need to let him go, let him go far, far away.  he isn't worth it.  If you decide to keep the baby then he needs to be aware of his responsibilities!  Child support and everything that come with children.  Good luck|`|AA10390606	Tell him right away that you are pregnant. It was not so bad what he did, he may have just missed her as a friend.

If you truely love him and think he loves you too, then you need to talk to him about the relationship.

You deserve better than him. I realize you have been in this relationship for 2 years, but if you leave him now, it is only 2 years  of your life. If you stay with him and "work things out", eventually, he will hurt you again. You need a guy who is committed to you. As far as your baby... you need to decide whether or not to keep it or give it up for ADOPTion if you are not quite ready for a child. If you are more than 3 weeks along, it already has a heartbeat. You still have a chance to move on with your life and stand strong. Good luck! :)|`|4554c4505cd94e0b0ce4ad530cab31a4aa	I am very sorry about your problem first and foremost but you have to talk to him. Tell him how he hurt you. Not to mention that you going over to his house almost every day just adds up more to your hurting. You need to also go into another perspective maybe he was not cheating on because there is a chance that he has no interest in her. Many guys keep in touch with ex's (this might be true because you two are still hanging out.) So maybe he was just checking up on her. I am not saying this is what he was doing because I don't know, but i do know you have to find out from him why he did that not just assume that he is cheating. You have been together for two years that shows he loves you so he would not try to hurt you. Plus you are pregant and he needs to know that. My real piece of advice i must say and I am saying over and over is that you have to talk if not for the sake of your relantionship than talk  for your baby.  Good Luck|`|AA12104677	dump him get abortion|`|b40fc1cfefac690553cb9758e5f6ab2faa	dont tell him yet if it's his and if its not oh well but any way ask him if you could have a second chance and then tell him if you do/ if not still tell him|`|AA11955312	keep the baby and find a new guy who will love u and the kid|`|AA12293820	HAVE THE CHILD> Look you may hurt bad now, but if you let him play with your emotions you are putting you and the childs health in danger. Besides if he can't be man enough to stand by you then he isn't worth it. Tell him your pregnant. HE can not just have sex with you and have you on the side then be someone elses boyfriend. It isn't right and you shouldn't let that be an option. Love yourself and the child enough to keep yourself out of a situation where you will think you are second best. Don't worry about him. You have a child, which will be the best part of him I am sure. Keep your head up, don't stress it will make things harder. Good Luck|`|AA11826525	i am really sorry to hear ur story... first decise whether u want to be with him or not.... and well if gets to know that ur pregnant then it might change him too... but since things have gone too far just dont be angry and leave him.... even though he did some thing really bad.... so talk to him... and u will feel wht u need to do.. may be u will feel tht okay u can forgive him and might be in a possition to welcomeback he in to ur life.. if he really wants u... and if it turn out to be tht u cant get over wht he did and still feel soo disgusting about the whole issue then.. have to deal alone with it... may be a abortion would be a answer too.. wht ever the situation is...|`|AA12179309	This might be the toughest ?uestiion i've answered. I dont believe in abortions. And whe nu have a family or expecting, from what I've observed, people tend to try a little harder. He needs to your your pregnant. Next, you need see if he wants forgiviness, see if he wants to try the relationship again (yes that means the possibility of taking him back), and u need to him to tell u how much he loves u and to explain himself about that emai lto his ex.     ok. If he is not inlove with you and agrees it should be over then it is! As far as your baby, take care of yourself and love you ad the baby. Then make a DOCUMENTED agreement so he can start giving u $$$ for the baby. U both deserve this and he should be more than willing. Babys have MANY MANY needs, get as much as u can early so it'll be easy later on.     whew! ok next, if he wants to really try the relationship again and be a father and perhaps husband. Dont take him back for a few months, like 3 t least. Let him show you by being there for the baby, calling and checking on u everyday, and being LESS stressful as possible. Let him spoil u rotton!!!. And after the WAIT PERIOD, if u want, then try it again letting him know that if he even things about disrespecting uand the relationship and now the mother of his baby ever again, the only relationship you'll have with him will be CHILD SUPPORT.    Good Luck hun and think things through. Relax and rest. and EAT!|`|AA12390213	wow. you should tell him that your pregnant if you haven't. if he denying ya'lls kid, go to maury's show for real. tell him how you feel. ask him does he even love you. i mean was you and his relationship a joke or something. he probably still has some feelings for her but, ask him those questions. if he ain't willing to be there for you and he says he doesn't love you, then move on. no matter how much you love him, go on, make him pay child support, don't go back to him either. because you don't be waisting your time with that boy, when he ain't for real. because you need to do whats best for your child thats coming soon. i mean just go on take care of your baby and you'll find another man don't give the baby up either. be a good/ smart person and keep your baby and give your baby a good life. you then show him that you didn't need him and your child will be on his case why he wasn't there and you'll be the better person.
AA12319981	This is my suggestion.  If the guy is nice and polite when asking you out, then I would say something along the lines of "thats very nice, I appriciate it, but I have a boyfriend."  Be nice and polite, but firm.  If the guys a jerk and obnoxious, then you return in kind, expecially if it's in a public place.  You could say something like "look, a**hole.  I have a boyfriend, and even if I didn't, I wouldn't want to spend time with a lowlife scumbag like you!"  If that situation should arise, then you would have informed many people at once that you don't care for the attention.  But, again I would stress to wait till the guys a jerk from the start, or else everyone else will think ill of you.

05319610907787ea3aad25c6db8a6ef6aa	He just wants regular sex and knows you'll put out.    It's easier for him to just have sex with you on a weekly basis than find a new girlfriend and then wait till she has sex with his father or the same best friend again.    Maybe if you didn't have sex with his best friend in the first place, you wouldn't have this problem.  But that's all in the past and now you're just a place for him to stick it into regularly.|`|cde262aa36fcbd52c431cd2e2cf41107aa	tell him your way or no way|`|AA12393872	If the once a week does not work- find a guy that will spend more time with you. There are many guys out there and that will want to spend a lot of quality time with you instead of their buddies. Do you think this guy is in it for the long run? If you had a family together do you think spending one day a week with you and the children would be acceptable? Guilt only stretches so far. Apparently he is more attracted to his best friend more than you (not in a sexual way--at least I hope not). Cut the old stale and damaged relationship and start anew with a clear slate.|`|AA10281430	ya ***** *** mother ****** u expect me to read all a that|`|01365ed109568cd6348f995ad0f4f485aa	do you really want him? cause that is the worst thing you could ever do to a guy. ouch. my advice for you is to talk to him and ask him what he truly wants.
AA12393872	Just let him know-- he already has shown interest in you. Honesty has always been the best policy for me.

At this age the natural development is to become more independent and detached from your parents.  As frustrating as it is for the parents, it is a neccessary stage which a child needs to go through in order to be able to handle things on their own when they leave home. We, as parents know that they still need guidance even if they don't think so.  What it becomes is a power struggle and the parents are, in their eyes, tyrants and just plain mean.  My 14 year old son is going through this right now, but i just keep reminding myself of what i was like at that age.  He may also be feeling left out or ignored especially if it's apparent that you don't want to be around him.  If his temperment or personality is really different from his siblings, you are going to have to find a way to value his uniqueness and show him that he is as important and loved as the other children.  He needs some positive reinforcement  instead of just negativity from you.  Is he perhaps envious of the time his father spends with you or angrey because he thinks you are trying to replace his Mother?  There's probably a lot of things going on in his mind that he can't discuss with you because you have shut him out. Saying that you can't stand to look at him is a pretty strong statement to direct at a child and feelings that strong have to have an effect on how you treat him. Maybe a little one on one time alone with his Father might give him the bit of special attention he might be craving. I definately  think you both should  get some counselling to help understand the animosity between the two of you.  If you can't resolve this not only is your sons self esteem going to hit rock bottom, but it is going to affect the entire family. I hope things improve for the two of you.  Good Luck.|`|AA12393872	Talk to the Dad to straighten his little *** out!! The father needs to help on the discipline too and this is a good example! If he cannot do it then out the door you should run. He should be thanking you over and over for accepting all of his children into your life! Relationships are hard enough with one or two kids of your own. Step children usually bring the baggage of their  past with them as they have experienced distress before you ever came around. The Dad needs to step in now and tell this kid that what he is doing is against the both of you and not just you. A marriage is a unified front--both adults together on common ground. This needs to take place quickly or you will have no relationship at all!|`|12f34f3d4c907271913bae6970260903aa	put him in diapers and treat him like hes your baby|`|AA12096112	well wut i would do...is talk to him about the situation...and ask him if any thing is bothering him...and consider doing stuff with him so he could gain respect, trust ,and LIKE for u.|`|AA10034690	Most likely nothing.  What you could have done is not get married to some one who had children.  You are not their mother.  Where is she?  Was your husband widowed or divorced?.  Were you divorced and do you have any children of your own.?  Things get very complicated for children when they are not being raised by their natural parents.  If you had become involved  when they were 2 to 7  things would probably  have been different.
AA11885925	I would confront him and ask him for the truth.  How long have you been together??  Do you trust him??  Do you love him enough to stay with him if it is true??  I think that the chances are if they are just friends, then they probably didnt.  Only they know and you need to trust what he says.....if you really love him.  If you dont trust him, then move on......I would also ask him why she was there in the first place.  Was it to make you jealous???|`|e596264fc78a88f320aaf23d5646ba29aa	Yeah DUH!!!

It's fun to flirt, it's a compliment to get a smile or a wink from someone, but there is not other physical contact with others.     Only you can decide what you'd do if your spouse fools around on you.  There are too many different situations out there.  If you are both considering playing around, if you are both are unhappy, then perhaps it is time to separate from each other and decide what you really want then.|`|AA12353353	yes i am faithful to my husband  of almost 9yrs  , yes he have cheated on me in the past but i forgive him and he promise me he will never do it again|`|87eebe17d3f4845af2d4c36dd439c222aa	I have always been faithful to both of my wives even when the first was running around.

Enough said.|`|AA11022086	it hard been faithful, NO|`|17c217b009e48562c86aab6bed425794aa	It depends on what you consider faithful - a lot of people in committed relationships have sex with others, but most of the time it is just sex - there is no bonding going on.  I think a lot of people do this.  If you consider being faithful not having a real relationship , both physically and spiritually, i think this is much less prevalent, since it is hard enough to keep on committed relationship on the right track.|`|AA10784310	yes I am faithful.....I would leave in a minute if i found out he was cheating on me. The trust is gone once this occurs....it would make me always wander if he is cheating again if I did not leave.....too much energy wasted on that.|`|AA11960752	Love, trust and loyalty are parts of us when we star growing and when people do not know that it is very hard to expect from them to have it.

Of course but we need to know who and whom we are going to tide our live with it and believe on something that is the best of my advice

Does he look jealous, because he might be trying to joke it off. It might jealousy, but he might be unsure of his feelings. That's more likely I think, that he is unsure. Does he do anything else that makes you think he likes you?  I'd drop a few hints, maybe compliment him a bit more, flirt with him a little. If he responds well, propose that you guys do something as "more than friends" or however you want to put it.  Even if you are too afraid to drop hints, I think it's best that you clear the air. He might have a great poker face. But when you tell him how you feel about him, don't just do it right out of the blue. Start to state your feelings during a conversation that you feel relates to that. Perhaps one about relationships. But don't go all crazy on him as you extol your love since kindergarten and your various diaries entries promising you to him. Just keep it cool, calm, and collected.
AA11250450	no way. Dutch|`|b8bdff54b7d6b58fd1069ffed97db45daa	no, a man should never pay for everything.

But, it would probably be a more enjoyable relationship if there is some sharing! If a man is paying all the time for everything during the courtship - something is going on in that relationship that is not good for either person. One thing you should never do is start spending more on dates than you can afford - always have a guide or know the limit in the amount that you can spend. If you're pressured from the other person to  spend more - you need to spend somewhere else!|`|754ec673686451587dd05c8293ff5360aa	lol....I guess I'd have to , have been in a relationship to answer your Q...lol|`|22b9793f7017a47fad9d28feb0e795d9aa	Yes!! on the first couple of dates and then i feel we can go dutch or chip in together.|`|e467e67dcd922c44c1eaa095fa5d3319aa	If one desires, either a man or a woman can pay for everything.

WHY?    Well, if you married the slut, you'd have fun your whole life.  Most marriages end in divorce because of either money issues or SEX issues.  If you spend you whole life banging sluts and then marry a "good girl", you're going to be dissappointed in the bedroom.  You'll have unreal expectations leading to either suppressed sexual desires or cheating.    I say, date all the little good girls and marry a butt plugg wearing, leather boot stepping, strapon banging, sperm swallowing SSSSSLLLUUUUUUUTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

Suggest what you guys could do to bring some happiness back into your relationship.    If you honestly feel that you can't stand her anymore and there's no way anything could change that, then I'd say leave her now before you hurt her more in the future. The longer you wait, the more she'll suffer in the end since you led her on to believe for so long that nothing was wrong.

79631809ef9f21bf17b3d211b5b710a0aa	I have been married for 3 years and I know exactly what you are talking about.. we used to make love and now all it seems to be is sex... no foreplay, no cuddling... just do your business and that is it.... I have tried explaining it to him and he doesn't get it.. he doesn't see the difference and he calls what he is doing making love and I don't.... there is no mental connection there and I don't know what to do because it is getting to where I don't want to have sex with him anymore...|`|AA12287228	I have been married almost 6 six years July 18, and my hubby is the sameway. he only wants it when he wants it , not when i want it. i absolutely hate it.

Maybe you need to make a date to have sex.|`|87eebe17d3f4845af2d4c36dd439c222aa	My wife is the type that can take it or leave it. I am the type who is very intimate. At times she is like "just come on and get it over with, and I am trying to give her the whole works. It gets on my nerves, but there is nothing I can do about it. I have just had to learn to live with it.|`|6f226fe23ebccb300bd42c55fa738629aa	I can relate to your issue.  I have a similar issue with my fiance.  My scenario is different though.  I work in Iraq and take vacations home ever 4-5 months.  In my case, my fiance was not able to be affectionate in her past relationships, so it more or less dulled her desire to be touchy feely.  As for me I am all about passion and touching, holding hands, spooning while sleeping.  The problem that I have is that she isnt into kissing a whole lot and that foreplay really isnt much of an issue... but I love working up to the moment of making love.  Sometimes it feels like you are being rushed to get it over with.. almost like it's a chore,  another check off the check list.  Intimacy is a key element in the develpment of a healthy loving relationship as is open communication.  Since you have expressed your desire for more intimacy and he yields at the thought of it, perhaps seeking advice through a marriage conselor could be an avenue of approach for you.  There is no shame of asking for help, but there is for failure when there is help all around us. I wish you two the best.|`|284ab899b333513696731d768c358377aa	Just out of curiosity....

Sometimes guys seem to just toss aside what we say when we complain believing that the feeling will just pass after awhile.  I can see where they get confused sometimes because, let's face it, we will complain about something small and then later we are over it.  You'll have to make him see this is not one of those times.  Not in a yelling or confrontive way though, ya know?  Hopfully he'll come around.  If NOT and he doesn't even try....I would wonder if your needs are important enough to him.|`|AA10875108	Yes I am experiencing it right now and I hate it.  I'm to the point that I'm ready to cheat and I know it's wrong-but I want to feel like I'm wanted again.  We've been married for 6yrs. I've expressed my wants several times to no avail.  He was like that in the beginning too and I should have known.  It isn't getting any better.

Como o usurio ao lado falou, as m?es que jogam o beb fora, provavelmente n?o tem amor nele, assim como as que espancam at matar.

As vezes, as m?es podem bater nos filhos, j mais velhos, isso pode provir de uma falta de educa??o e amor da M?e, enquanto era crian?a, ou de uma crise de famlia, ou de at mesmo uma loucura.

AA11982425	My advice is for you to attend a free English As A Second Language class.  They're available everywhere, and of course, don't cost you anything.  There, you will meet many Spanish speaking people who are trying to learn English.  Become friends with those you like.  Explain that you feel you are losing your primary language.  Help them with their English for an opportunity to interact with them in Spanish.

Anytime you start having sex with someone, you have more urge than after you've been doing it for a while. You have a chance to slow down, and see if this builds to a relationship. Don't blow it by continually pushing for sex. This takes emotional maturity. She is now waiting for you to show you like her and care for her. Do this and she'll come back around. If you don't, you could lose her.|`|AA12082377	Alcohol prolonged your ejaculation and it's very possible that what she said did effect your ability to get an erection.|`|AA12151893	First consult your doctor.

Of course it isn't a problem for the females but sometimes I need to get mine if you know what I mean. It's been such a problem that I've had to make the personal decision not to drink when I plan on being with a women.

AA11525748	I had your problem. Shy and stuttering. seriously don't make a big deal about it. Girls go for relaxed guys who don't show any interest to them. My advice would be to start with a hi and let her steer the conversation first, then when you feel comfortable take control of it. Ask a few question to build the momentum, if the feeling feels right then go ahead. But if you have not spoke to her much, then build that first until you feel that she feels comfortable. Go for it.  Find only the positives. Good luck. One more thing, If you feel nervous breath into your abdoman and push your belly out and in. This relaxes you and creates a feeling of peace all around you. It also make things work out for you in your favour.|`|b1baeaf59e5f6d0516821c843a8f1f76aa	deap breaths|`|23f928d36f8f7bc78e66479080278c7caa	you gotta believe that shes the one thats lucky you like her so much. feel good about yourself and remember shes not the only girl out there.   be who you are, make her laugh and be there for her. but don't let her walk all over you.|`|a3b6391333884f1a05aefb0b1acf7d8daa	tell her how you feel and prepare yourself by what you are going to say to her.. and stay calm|`|aa53d3bd3ac620d9ea87c7f30da4f22faa	instead of thinking of her as the hot chick that work with you think of her as a friend that you talk to oe write her a letter email her start lil conversation bout work sometimes pull a fake push to get her to talk to you this is a normal thing everyone is shy at first but after a while you will get over it

9abfe9056703871e74f9b14048cd2843aa	Na minha opini?o o sentido da vida consiste no angariar conhecimento e virtude, ou moralidade. Acredito na reencarna??o e infiro que  impossvel alcan?armos a evolu??o, adquirirmos o conhecimento amplo e total, sobre um assunto seguer, numa nica existncia. Portanto, n?o podermos ser julgados por desconhecermos a totalidade do conhecimento sobre as implica??es da escolha que fizermos. J, com a reencarna??o, temos um sentido para a vida e damos mais valor  ela e a valorizamos no nosso semelhante. E atravs de vrias vidas podemos acumular virtudes que nos balizar?o com o cabedal do entendimento amplo, abarcando um horizonte mais vasto, menos restritivo e, ent?o, poderemos fazer a escolha certa, n?o cegamente, mas conscientemente.  O esprito s ser detentor de uma virtude quando seu anelo, toda a sua aspira??o , todo seu desejo se embeber em cada fagulha de luz que pululam e dimanam dessa flama da virtude que almeja. Um exemplo: N?o abarcars a virtude da serenidade enquanto ainda latejar em teu esprito laivos de teu aspecto irascvel, de tua ndole intempestiva e inconstante. S quando despojares teu esprito dessas rotas vestes poders ataviar-te de uma nesga dessa virtude, como uma luz que acompanhar-te- pela eternidade, credenciando tua alma a angariar mais luz para essa virtude, consolidando-a indelevelmente em teu esprito.

Os benefcios de fazer as pazes   Assuntos relacionados:    Quando surgem desacordos no casamento   Como fazer verdadeiros amigos   Por que devo pedir desculpas?      Donde procedem as guerras e donde vm as lutas entre vs?  TIAGO 4:1.    TIAGO, escritor bblico, n?o fez essa pergunta aos soldados das legi?es romanas ent?o em guerra, nem estava analisando os motivos da luta de guerrilha dos Sicrios, ou faquistas, judeus do primeiro sculo EC. Tiago se referia s disputas que envolviam apenas duas pessoas. Como assim?  que as disputas, da mesma forma que as guerras, s?o destrutivas. Veja os seguintes relatos bblicos.    Os filhos do patriarca Jac odiavam tanto seu irm?o Jos que o venderam como escravo. (Gnesis 37:4-28) Mais tarde, o Rei Saul, de Israel, tentou matar Davi porque tinha inveja dele. (1 Samuel 18:7-11; 23:14, 15) No primeiro sculo, duas mulheres crist?s, Evdia e Sntique, perturbaram a paz de uma congrega??o inteira com suas discuss?es.  Filipenses 4:2.    Em sculos mais recentes, homens resolviam as diferen?as em duelos, confrontando-se com espadas ou pistolas. Muitas vezes, um dos duelistas morria ou ficava aleijado. Hoje em dia, as armas mudaram. A hostilidade entre alguns geralmente se limita ao uso de palavras amargas e ferinas. Embora n?o se derrame sangue, os ataques verbais ferem as emo??es e a reputa??o. Os inocentes muitas vezes sofrem nestas guerras.    Considere o que aconteceu h alguns anos quando um sacerdote anglicano acusou outro de m administra??o das finan?as da igreja. A rixa entre eles tornou-se pblica, e a opini?o dos membros da congrega??o se dividiu. Alguns se recusavam a assistir aos cultos presididos pelo sacerdote a quem se opunham. O desrespeito mtuo chegou a tal ponto que eles nem se olhavam quando se encontravam durante o culto. Quando o sacerdote acusador foi ele mesmo incriminado de m conduta sexual, a rixa se intensificou.    O Arcebispo de Canturia apelou para que os clrigos parassem com a luta, chamando-a de cancer e de escandalo que desonra o nome de Nosso Senhor. Em 1997, um dos sacerdotes concordou em se aposentar. O outro se manteve no cargo o mximo que p?de, at a idade da aposentadoria obrigatria, ficando ali at o dia 7 de agosto de 2001, quando completou 70 anos. O jornal The Church of England Newspaper mencionou que a data em que ele se aposentou era o dia da festa de S?o Victricius. Quem era S?o Victricius? Era um bispo do quarto sculo, que se diz ter sido a?oitado por ter recusado lutar no exrcito. Notando o contraste nas atitudes, o jornal disse: Negar-se a lutar numa batalha eclesistica n?o era caracterstica do [sacerdote que se aposentou].    Estes sacerdotes teriam evitado prejudicar a si mesmos e a outros se tivessem aplicado o conselho de Romanos 12:17, 18: N?o retribuais a ningum mal por mal. Provede coisas excelentes  vista de todos os homens. Se possvel, no que depender de vs, sede pacficos para com todos os homens.    E voc? Se algum lhe ofende, ser que o ressentimento o leva a um clima de guerra? Ou evita palavras speras visando manter o caminho livre para uma rela??o pacfica? Se ofender algum, ser que evita a pessoa e espera que, com o tempo, ela esque?a o problema? Ou voc pede desculpas sem demora? Quer pe?a desculpas quer desculpe outros, tentar manter a paz contribuir para o seu bem-estar. Os conselhos bblicos podem nos ajudar a resolver at mesmo conflitos antigos, conforme mostra o prximo artigo.           OS BENEFCIOS DE  fazer as pazes    Nesta srie:    Guerras de palavras  por que ferem tanto?   Os benefcios de fazer as pazes   Assuntos relacionados:    Quando surgem desacordos no casamento   Como fazer verdadeiros amigos   Por que devo pedir desculpas?      ED ESTAVA morrendo e Bill o odiava. Duas dcadas antes, Ed tomou uma decis?o que fez com que Bill perdesse o emprego e isso p?s fim  amizade deles. Agora, Ed tentava pedir perd?o para que pudesse morrer em paz. No entanto, Bill se negava a escut-lo.    Quase 30 anos mais tarde, quando Bill estava para morrer, ele explicou por que n?o havia perdoado. Ed n?o devia ter feito aquilo comigo. Eu simplesmente n?o quis me reconciliar com ele depois de 20 anos.  . . . Talvez estivesse errado, mas era assim que me sentia.*    As desaven?as n?o costumam ter esse resultado trgico, mas freqentemente deixam as pessoas magoadas. Pense em algum que passou pelo mesmo problema de Ed. Ele sabe que sua atitude causou problemas e por isso talvez conviva com uma conscincia pesada e um sentimento de perda arrasador. No entanto, ele sente-se magoado quando lembra que seu amigo ofendido descartou a amizade deles como se fosse lixo.    J algum com a mesma opini?o de Bill considera a si mesmo uma vtima inocente e talvez fique profundamente magoado. Para ele, seu ex-amigo n?o fez algo sem querer, mas talvez o tenha prejudicado de propsito. Muitas vezes, quando h um conflito entre duas pessoas, cada uma tem plena certeza de que est certa e que a outra est completamente errada. Quando isso acontece, dois amigos que eram muito achegados ficam, por assim dizer, em p de guerra.

2af167d68763fb4b94c0764c70da3c23aa	ok first of all think of what you are saying - imagine your wife posting a question like this also wanting some good loving from someone else? would you like that?   i think your high sex drive is due to the fact that maybe you are spending too much time satisfying it rather than satisfying her. so in the end there is nothing in it for her but just a marital service and thats it.   so before you give up and think of ways of cheating  - spend time trying to figure out what makes her really enjoy sex , spend a little more extra time on oral sex , spend a little more time complimenting her body and not by words - eg: hold her hand while driving. give her a kiss on the head while she is cleaning up or get up and make her some tea so she knows you do apprieate her. the next thing is to think if what you want done in bed to you, once you have thought of that do it to her instead, so you like a bit more of touching in your sensitive areas, you like to be held in a certain way, you like to use cetain things in bed- instead dedicate your time ( maybe bout  2 a week ) pleasing her- even if it means her pleasing is more oral then the real thing then do it. you will find yourself having longer and more oftern sex as she will want to do the same . most men think that women are instantly ready to have sex but women need a little more work - after the first few times of you showing an effort women become more willing to do more daring things. as long as they know its going to be just as good for them as it is for you they will have sex t least 5 - times a week and you will then be satisfied.   one more thing- try finding out her sexual fantacies  - you will be suprised !! give it another go and if she is still not up for it then by all means consider leaving and getting it some where else cause she might not be sexualy attracted to you. also find out if it hurts her cause then it might be medical condition that could easily be sorted out and she will stop avoiding sex.|`|239164231b6f4af4bb38d2a39979a7c6aa	Get a can of red paint ~  Get a paint brush~  Now paint these words across your chest ~  Honey you are married to a freaking nut ~  Please divorce me now!!

Are you willing to risk the friendship for love?  If you hung out at his house after you broke up and she was around... how would it make either of you feel?  If you all are adults and they don't live together talk to your friend in a polite manner no saying things like "Man I think your sister is HOT!" or something like that.

Women certainly do mature faster than men do. Most guys by the time they are 25, are about as mature as they will ever get. However, occasionally you meet a 30 something year old that is immature. I think I was every bit as mature at 18 as I am now at 31, but I think that I am rare in that regard. I actually have a female cousin in Kansas who is 30 years old and she is extremely immature. For some unknown reason she deliberately sabotages every relationship that she gets into, she whines all the time about everything, she will annoy even the most patient person, and you just can't wait to get away from her within a couple minutes of being around her.|`|74d45f96a7d7133219787a07a7ddbe84aa	wow thats rly nice to guys  let me tell u something: girls get so offended when some guy puts an "offensive" question on here, but its ok for girls to put up an offensive q about a guy?  think about it.|`|144b33abb0688c093d892beabb2a6f2caa	Hell I'm 23 and i'm a super big kid at heart.

The honest answer is that there is no way to really, 100%, know how another person feels. Sometimes you don't know even after they've told you because actions usually speak louder than words.     Case in point, a person says that they really like you, however they don't treat you with kindness or respect or love. They don't take you out anywhere nice, never introduce you to their friends and don't even bother to do the tiny little things that would make you happy like a card or flowers or taking you to meet the parents.     In this case your heart is hoping that the words they told you are true while your head is wondering why a person who loves you would act this way. What a sticky situation and an uncomfortable one too. What do you do? How do you know if they mean it when they say they like or love you?     Here are a few things that you can think about that might help you at least come to grips with how you feel and what you expect from a relationship.     (1) No one is "lucky" to have someone like them. If you're feeling like you are really lucky because another person wants to be with you or because you think they are so special that you can't believe they would like someone like you, you're on the wrong track already.     Human beings choose to be with one another. No one is doing you a favor by going out with you. You and the other person decide to spend time together. You must value yourself and your time before anyone else will. If you feel great because you're going out with someone wonderful remember that that person is going out with someone wonderful too, you! No one will like or love us until we first can like and love ourselves.       (2) Respect yourself. No one will show you respect and kindness if you don't first treat yourself that way. Once you do, all other people will too. What we will and won't stand for is how we develop our values and characters.     If you respect yourself enough not to do destructive things that you know can harm you then no one else will either. The minute a person lowers their standards it's easy to follow suit. A simple example of this is when a person cares so little about their car that they throw garbage in the back seat, let junk pile up and then get mad at their friends when they do the same and trash the car. If you put yourself down, belittle your abilities and drop everything to do what someone else wants regardless if you want you, you are showing your lack of self-esteem and confidence. When you do this other people will devalue your time and talents just like you do.       (3) Like the person you date. I hear horror stories about bad dating experiences and after the person is done describing in detail what a waste of time this date was I usually ask them a question. I ask, "Why did you go out with them?" It never ceases to amaze me when their reply is similar to this, "I went out with them because they asked me."     RAISE YOUR STANDARDS!     Even if you don't know how they feel about you, don't say yes to a date unless you like the person. This way at least you're starting out in a good place and not just killing time with someone because you don't have enough respect or confidence to spend time alone or with friends. How will you know if you like them? Talk with them over the phone or over a beverage and find out how they think, speak and act.     The biggest mistakes we make are when we really want a relationship and we're lonely and so we convince ourselves that this is the person for us even when our heads and hearts are telling us that this isn't the person.     The signals you send are the ones that are the most important when dating. You will only be ready to read the signs that other people send when you send confident and positive signals: that you feel good about yourself, that you're okay with being alone. There is no magic person who will make you complete, a date is the beginning of learning about someone else you hope is ready to treat you with the courtesy and respect you always give yourself and expect from everyone else.|`|AA10717543	The most common mistake women make with men? Believing them about anything, ever. They are not to be trusted, and in your situation with children to consider, you need to be even more careful than most women.

But give it lots of time- don 't rush into anything that you may regret later.|`|d3cf9853c96968dfccc746c13ffd446faa	The only answer I know is the old-fashioned one, which might not be in style any more.  He wants you so much that it would be a miracle if he could keep his eyes off of your face, his lips off of your mouth, he hungry hands off of your body. And yet, miraculously, while acting like a man he begs to become your husband.  I still think that is the litmus test of love, because unallayed lust without desire for committment is nearly universal, but love-- an urgent need for physical joining mingled with an unquenchable desire to join in committment as well as physical embrace-- is somewhat less common.  As the Irish say, if he wants you so much that he can't keep his hands off of you, but too much to seduce and abandon you-- he loves you enough!  Anybody who thinks this sounds sappy is too ignorant to understand it. Love is the greatest reality in your life, and marriage is the most important transaction you will ever make.|`|30457c1158972526ce5a920452223741aa	things r more confusing when a parent, because u r not makning the choice for just u.  in my opinion its the simple things does he know what ur favorite color is, or what flavor ice cream u like, does he know what u would order at buger king?  if he takes the time to care about the small stuff then he cares.  do not make the choice just by what he says.   the old saying actions speak louder than words.|`|a83d798909fea4fc6d92b34244a4321faa	He always thinks you're gorgeous even when you couldn't look any worse, he cant stop thinking of ways to demonstrate he cares about you or how much you mean to him. He says he doesn't deserve you because you're  the best woman he's ever met, but at the same time would give anything to spend his life for you. Will defend you no matter what and gives his all. Sticks with you through the toughest situations. But only certain instances arise where you can really tell he loves you.    I guess its harder when children are involved because if your his child's mother he has a duty to have a relationship with you for the child. But a friendship can never be confused with love.    The most common mistake women make with men, and some men make with women is giving their heart away too soon. But then again, sometimes we have to get hurt in order to appreciate real love.|`|324ff9df9883ec240aa672b196c3f434aa	If the guy is just a little shy.

Quando uma pessoa faz somente sexo, ela faz porque sente atra??o fsica e sexual pela pessoa, mesmo amando outra.  somente o ato em si, o momento, que acaba al mesmo. E acredite, infelizmente esse comportamento  mais encontrado nos homens. Quando dizemos que fazemos amor, envolve algo muito maior que a atra??o fsica.  um sentimento que envolve amor, carinho, cumplicidade, aquela maravilhosa sensa??o do depois, de ficar al coladinho, agarradinho com quem ama... a completa uni?o entre duas pessoas!!

If you keep doing things to win his heart just hoping that he will love you back, you are just going to find yourself being unhappy and miserable because the fact that you love someone does not waranty that this person is going to love you.  You can give it a try but if your innerself says he doesn't love you is because he is not the one, something is not working out and he is not your soulmate.  Move on, don't waste your time, outthere someone is waiting for you, just open you eyes and your heart, smile and be happy.

Do you feel that you still love him? Do you think the break-up was a mistake? Are you thinking about just the good times versus the bad? Maybe you are just lonely? Only you have those answers...     Don't get me wrong, it's natural to go through this type of thing but you have to be careful your not going to get stuck in a cycle of regret. Many times relationships end for a reason. There are exceptions, of course. This one sounds innocent enough, it isn't like one of you was cheating or being abusive towards the other.     There's nothing wrong with at least saying "Hi" to him again. Be casual and keep it simple. See how he reacts. It's possible he could have moved on already or maybe he's thinking the same things you are?     IF you've decided your truly still interested and IF he is still interested, you'll certainly have to work out the communication problem between both of you. Don't put your heart out on the line just yet, but if there's still a spark in his eyes, telling him that you've been thinking about him and "I'm sorry, I thought breaking-up was a mistake..." would be a good place to start.    Best of luck, hon! :)

AA12039172	yeah that's ok, I'm tall too and would definitely go out with a shorter guy if I liked him.|`|AA11114063	I have the same problem except I'm taller than you.  If he doesn't want to go out with you because you're a little taller than him, you don't need him.  Lots of men find taller people attractive.    People are going to talk because that's what people do.  They find lots of stuff to talk about like what you're wearing, so if people talk just ignore them because they are obviously giving some other poor soul a break.    It's all the same when you are on your back anyway.|`|78856934d1ea046c6aca8dabc3c51b86aa	Go for it this is 2006.. women/girls can ask a guy out and it is fine...we guys would love it if girls/women took the initive...as to the height difference it dosen't matter one little bit...if people look at you let them look if you are happy what others might think makes no difference..your happiness is what counts.|`|c0813f537ba56bdcb020796a413e769daa	This is silly--height shouldn't matter.

89e4ee201d462784f64424f3c6c2e36caa	Se pueden escribir libros!  Pero te doy una pista que le por Internet.      Aclaracin importante:  Eso de que les gusta "que les traten como REINAS" no es cierto!  Lo que en REALIDAD les gusta es "ESTAR CON UN REY" y por ende son reinas ya que solamente un REY sabe como tratarlas as. As que SIENTE TE REY, un rey que la quiere y tratala en consecuencia. Siente BRAD PIT, y tratala as. ESO es lo que les gusta.     Pregunta-le por su DOLO y eso te dar pistas de con quin quiere estar.    Otras ideas:  - Fijate qu tipo de Mujer es. Una buena forma es preguntarle a quin de las mujeres de Sex & City se parece ms o se siente ms relacionada. La escritora es normal y le gusta la aventura, la que tuvo el bebe la peli-roja es prctica y le gusta todo de frente pero no desubicado las cosas como son, la rubia sexomanaca a la que le interesa que te banques malas palabras y todo sobre sexo, y la chica york a la que le gusta lo familiar por sobre todo. Tambin puedes intentar con Amas de Casa desesperadas.  -Sabiendo su patrn entonces intenta y verifica si es como dicen... muchas veces dice una cosa pero en realidad es otra.  -Normalmente les gusta lo que hace juego con ellas si son centradas o lo que es opuesto a ellas si son reveldes.  -Todo buen trato... no es cierto que les guste, prefieren alguien que tiene conviccin y sabe y esta seguro de lo que le gusta. Para inseguras estn sus amigas.   - Debes ser tu mismo. No digas: Me gusta lo que vos quieras. D: Yo quiero tal cosa, vos tens todo el derecho de pedir lo que vos quieras o Eso no me gusta ni me agrada PERO voy a ir/hacer/comprar/probar tal cosa POR VOS as como ESPERO vos hagas LO MISMO POR MI.  - Les gusta las buenas sorpresas salir a comer entre semana. Ir de paseo algn lugar un fin de semana.  Una flor (no un ramo) sin que sea un da especial.

If this is not possible write her a note and slip it in her books as you pass her. Say this " I would really like to get to know you better, would you mind if I called you?

It catches them off guard and a little defensive. Not a good way to start a relationship right?

9fb19d9fd9c6eb9bdbdd03fb95dfcec7aa	I think the most important thing about a woman is her personality! What good is beauty?, if you have nothing in common. First you need to find out about each other ,then find out if you are compatible with each other. If you both find that you have mutual interests and enjoy each others company, then her being beautiful and having a great figure is just an added bonus. I hope my input helps you,"God bless you"|`|AA11584360	I've never had a girl that had a high pitched laugh.

Personalities, looks, humor and intelligence are all important.  She can be drop dead gorgeous, with a all the personality of a brick, and I will not be interested.

Their jelousy when u'r around with another girl. The way they try to make themselves look apealing in u'r eyes. etc.. etc...    But what I hate about them is when they carry their jelousy too far.

I don't hate their giggling or when they are annoyed with others. I am sometimes annoyed when they say they are fat when it seems like they are near perfection. Dislike when they get cranky but I understand why so it's something I just accept.  Everything you say seems true. I love being able to talk with things that are more intimate. Looks are great but if we don't have compatible personalities, then it just won't work. So personality is a big quality. It's not just that they look beautiful on bad hair days but even if it's raining and the weather's horrible, I see girls with no hair out of place and it is just amazing.|`|c32ced27ed0a71194bbde49911f56160aa	when women say u r not listening or when they say we need to talk

It would have to be secret meetings which are kind of nice because they are really romantic. Find the girl while doing your normal day life. You may see her just walking around. And then flirt a little. I really don't know what you mean by no liberty as in internet access or what not. If they have internet access, email and messenger. Good luck.|`|AA10084738	Man is a social animal and so finds it difficult to live without family and friends too. Sometimes, such moments come in persons life that he needs friends desperately.

It sounds like you are afraid to lose some kind of "freedom" or, in other words, like you are afraid of the committment.    Get to know yourself and what you really want inside.

Was it just the 'chase' did you just want to see if he would ever actually go through with it. Maybe you weren't comfortable or ready to move ahead. 6 years is a long time... I wouldn't throw it away. Perhaps take a step back and just postpone the engagement. I mean you waited 6 years who cares if it is 7? :)

AA12393872	I am not a "lady" but I have been in a few break-ups over the years. Depression is a natural reaction to any loss especially one that is so intimate as a relationship. Being that it was a three year relationship, there is a big void to fill where you used to be a part of and now not there. Being apart can actually be a great opportunity to allow your relationship to grow. This will give you the chance to look at the things in the relationship that you would need to repair if you would ever want to be a lasting and enduring couple again. Please be there for her now, though, as you are still an important part of her life. Work out the issues together but do not rush them. There is not time limit to this. It sounds like you two need the time apart and it will either strengthen the relationship or allow it to drift further. It is up to the two of you to work this out together which ever way it will go. Always use straight forwardness and honesty, that has always been the best tool. Though you may not like the answers, at least you will know where everything is going. Good luck and be understanding and patient!|`|8fab0559d5e8aef8f19a2a8fa9e7ace8aa	SIMPLE BY SAYING I LOVE YOU...

Depression can really confuse a person. Maybe she didn't break up with you because of that dressing comment. She probably associated it with negative thoughts, thinking that you don't love her or that sort.   You must really be patient and let her understand that you're always there to support her. She'll get well eventually.|`|6c40dc3b91c27b7ccaea42fc337dca4faa	let her kno u still love her.....and i agree with another person who answered.......give her space, and tyme to think things through.|`|AA11089230	Depression is a serious condition, no joke, I know from experience. I didn't want to be around anyone or do anything. It totally sucked, it caused me to quit my job, I didn't talk to my friends and my boyfriend of 5 years, I didn't care too much about. You kinda just don't care, and want to be alone. She probally doesn't want to be mean, bc she realizes what is going on, and it''s nothing personal towards you. This just takes time.  I can't see how my boyfriend dealt with me, we are still together, you just have to be patient with her, I'm glad my boyfriend was. I was put on medication bc I got so bad that I hated everything, and I was put on medicine, and if she is on medicine, it makes you act funny too, I didn't know who I was for about 3 months or so. It was a total damper on my life. My point being is that you just need to be there for her through this, please be patient and kind, if you really love her, be there for her. She needs you right now, if she doesn't want to talk, respect it, she's not wanting to be rude, not wanting to hurt you in any way. Just wait for her, it will take time, but if you honestly don't feel like waiting and see no point of sticking it out, move on. If you love her, stick it out. I wish the best of luck to the both of you :)|`|AA10846678	I call it The Dump-Weird-Girl Syndrom. Sometimes, women are inclined to feel and act WEIRD, either consciously or not. I get this quite often...:) I flare up over nothing, one little thing can make me absolutely miserable. Of course, not to the extent that I could break up with my boyfriend for the reason you mentioned... Yes, this IS some sort of a depression. What you need to do is to try and find out what makes her feel so, there may be some other reasons she hasn't told you about, and she might want to see how much you care and how PATIENT you are able to be with her. My boyfriend amazes me when it happens to me - he will give me some space, he will not pester me or  beg me to tell hime what it is, but he will talk to me in his usual caring way, and next time we talk I can't hold it back from him. Another scenario: I get over my dump thoughts and worries myself, it just takes time. The most unpleasant thing that could happen to your gf - she could have broken up with you because she found somebody else, and couldn't find any smarter reason to walk out. But I've never seen girls who would tell their bfs (after they broke up with them) that they love them and still want to be with them. So I'm almost sure, she is just being womanly weird. be patient and understanding! ;) Nice little gifts might also  be of help ;)
da94a0afd781963dcc81aec4336c76d6aa	If you are engaged, i say you could go for it but if she is not comfortable, and boy keeps on wanting it could scar the relationship.

Its painful though  If your friend doesn't have sex before marriage she will be respected even after marriage when situation arises for him to suspect her  So take care of the situation. Actually it is necessary to have sex unless she (your friend) needs it otherwise I would say no for her well being. Because boys are dogs they turn the plate as and when the situation arises  All the best

We kept the same schedule, I made sure we had 1-2 fun days a week doing things without daddy that we normally hadn't done.  We also wrote letters, and got webcams (thanks yahoo chat!).  It helped immensely.  He came home a year later, they were fine, we settled right back in to our routine.  I also was calm with the situation, and they picked up on that, and felt at ease as well. :)|`|2ccfe02e101b7725ab0cf2149bb124e7aa	It's up to the parent left at home to keep the absentee parent's memory alive in the children. Make sure you have lots of pictures displayed around the house. Talk about that person all the time....eg. "How do you think Daddy would feel about this?" and let the children's imaginations loose. When they are helped to remember, they don't forget. And with today's technology, even absent parents can be connected more than ever. We can email the same day. If we have webcams, we can even have a live picture of Daddy talking to us from wherever he is.   Separation need not be a bad thing. And just think of how pleased the absent partner is when he DOES get home!

You can't know that she doesn't care about you by following her around.|`|b493caa427317263d70ed82e7d49512eaa	What you're doing is stalking her and what exactly do you wish to accomplish by stalking?|`|8b207a6336dd44e4f18f925deef3f39daa	move on!|`|cee76a533b75649c349d03a354f96d54aa	Well, following her around is called stalking and in many states there are laws to prohibit this activity.  If she knows that you are following (stalking) her she's probably already freaked out by you.  And it's too late to redeem yourself.    If she doesn't know, stop now before it's too late.  Approach Kata Li (usually referred to as Jane Doe) and ask her about her interests and see if she's interested in going out on a date with you. This would be much more fulfilling than your previous methods.
AA11683608	Congrats! I don't know where you live, but you could go to the beach, or rent the fanciest suite that the nearest nice hotel has, and buy a bottle of some expensive wine, or go somewhere quiet and secluded. If you're talking about your wedding, have your wedding at a nice hotel. It's so much easier! Then, have a nice meal and use the hotel's pool; ask if it can be closed to the public while you're using it. It'll be great!

c4a7a92763712fbb6be7efc06f370b18aa	focus on the beautiful child...not on people's judgment and hate. hold your head high and give the child all the love you have (and then some more)     and give your sister all the love and support she needs. being a single mum is very hard and stressful. if you are able to give your sister a little "time off" once in awhile I know she will appreciate it. My sister gushed about taking the twins for an overnight or watching them on a saturday, so i could get a little rest and she is never available. I practically have to beg her to stay with my mom for little while and help her out when she watches the girls for me. It breaks my heart. I will never ask her to sit for me on her own (and she is 45!!) Anyway, even if you just sit with the baby while she catches an hour or two nap is a great blessing!! For me, if my mother or father just shows up out of the blue and sees that i am tired and stressed and says "why don't you lay down for a bit, i'll watch the girls" this is waaaay better than any gift!!    Anyway, forget hateful people and concentrate on the love of family!!! Congratulations Auntie!!!|`|AA12394429	People are a--holes, that's why.  No big mystery there.  Looking down their noses at someone makes them feel better about their petty, miserable little non-lives.  She can take some satisfaction in knowing that her kid will be grown up and gone while she still has a decent body and a chance at a future, and by the time their kids are out of the house, they will be nothing but used up old hags.  Tell your sister to be careful not to have any more kids or she will not ultimately win the game of "who is the hottest mother of a teenager".|`|111e198064249321bd48943f3fa7a7e5aa	No body's perfect but it's always easier gossiping the others than focusing on our own issues.  If you ask my personal opinion, I don't agree with your sister's choice as for me career comes first.  But it's her life, she should feel proud of her choice, being a single mum is not easy and do her best to rise her child!|`|AA10574362	Listen people do what ppl like..that is ruining a person's life by gettin into their personal matters....they just have a comment on each and everything...all that can be done is to ignore whatever they do....ur sister has her own life to live....and if she keeps on gettin upset becos of these insane ppl how will she live it peaceful...telll her to concentrate on her life and dont give a damn about anything...they'll stop once they see that she's ignoring...just take care n be happy...al d best fr life...!!|`|3d3b081575b38f91dcd769b90e4bd6d4aa	Have you ever looked at a pointing finger.

a74949a85abb936f28b712937cb6a695aa	Geez, why are you so worried about it? It's just sex, get it over with if you really feel that way. Talk to your ex and have him help you out. At least you know it won't be that bad cuz he probably will be a lot gentler and nicer than someone you don't really know or care about. And yes, I think 18 is way too old to still be a virgin!

Therefore if your age and mind permits u to do it just go ahead. But if at any moment u find it wrong just stop there without a second thought otherwise u will regret later.|`|AA10684042	You shouldn't look at it as something that you want to get over and done. Take it for someone like me who didn't have a choice to whom it was given to( it was taken). I will never know the pleasure of having my first time with someone who I really cared about and wanted them to share that important time with me. Hold on to it as much as you can. I was almost 18 and if that didn't happen and I would have held on so much longer. Please just don't just give it away. No one ever thinks about it but you are very lucky............|`|81893071781425ba9bce583da5f1add1aa	losing ur virginity is a once in a lifetime thing an dyu dont want to lose it to the wrong person. it has to be with a special person and not something someone can help you out with and its also not a burden. just coz everyone is having sex doesnt mean you have to . wait until the right man comes along.dont rush|`|ad64cf505583a9d3d54762472a482059aa	If your ex says no, then I'd happily help you out!|`|37cef7809795706a98bfb6b418acbd64aa	You will lose your virginity when you are ready.

Be patient.|`|bf4828f4edd4b6ab371b525325ecebe5aa	I think you should wait because I had a bf when I was young and him and I split up because my mom didn't like him, he and I had never been together intimately. While him and I was broken up I started seeing this other guy and he got me drunk and I lost it that night. Make a long story short when the love of my life and I had gotten back together a short time later he was broken hearted that I was no longer a virgin and that broke his heart.... I haven't seen him since but not because of that.   Seriously think about how great it would be to give it to ur first true love... it is a great feeling regardless if you are the receiver or the giver.... WAIT.... give it to your husband or someone you plan on spending your life with.   Good luck honey, your gonna do what you want regardless.|`|5455c4244f24918d0ba65c63a1c6cedbaa	why do you feel the need to get it over and done with. it should be something special to share with someone you care about and cares about you. later in life you will regret your decision to be so eager. dont give in to peer pressure if  thats the problem.|`|7b080c21dc77c94682316cacfa708ab8aa	Keep ahold of it until you find the guy who floats your boat, there's no hurry, and you really will regret it if you don't.|`|f386fc3326cf0afa523601a426284496aa	Why do you want to get it 'over and done with'? its not something so awful that you have to rush to do just so its out of the way. Dont go to your ex you will regret it, save it for someone special. I understand how you feel, i was the last of my friends to lose mine and they teased me about it but you know looking back i think they were jealous because they had lost theres in some drunken fumbling and they knew i was being fussy about saving mine for someone special. I am glad i waited, it wasnt the best sex by far but it holds special memories for me. I am not with the guy i lost it to but at the time i loved and trusted him, he was so pleased to find out i was his first. Dont be in such a hurry x  P.s then all the more reason to wait for someone special, dont be scared we had to try a couple of times because i was so nervous but it was fine.|`|bb0e36d5cab04a3a75dc185d1eaff1c9aa	your virginity is special you can never get it back so dont be in any hurry to loose it!!!your ex is not your ex for nothing save it for someone worthy of it!|`|32a673a7e165424ba38ccab7afd71854aa	I don't think you should just 'get it over and done with', losing your virginity isn't the kind of thing to get over and done with. I don't know your age, but it sounds like mentally you're not ready for it, by that I mean you seem so worried about it.    Trust me, when you find the right partner you'll be glad you waited, it won't be a case of him, 'helping you out', and you'll feel right about it afterwards.|`|c102dfb4a5cfd43aba77d870347f1943aa	Wait until you are sure you have found the right guy.

ba464474ee14217f239eb20ea39e7c07aa	You should only take her back if you`re willing to accept her for the way she is and you can deal with her lack of responsibility. If it bothers you really bad and it will cause further arguments, you should just suck it up and let her go. Asking her or trying to make her change will probably drive her further away from you. People only change when they want to change. You can`t force it. I hope that you get the answer you`re looking for here, but keep in mind these are only opinions. Only your heart can lead you in the right direction. Good luck! I hope whatever happens makes you happy in the end. :-)|`|AA11138696	No don't do it.  You don' t give a lot of info here but what you do say says it all.  The two of you are not compatable.  She wants to party you want to stay at home.  That is a basic difference that is always gonna be a bone of contention or else one of you is going to have to change and do the thing you don't like just to keep peace and stick with the other.  That is not what a relationship is about.  Let her go have her fun and you go find someone who wants to stay in with you.    Also if she is choosing to party over paying bills she is not on the same level of maturity that you are and not paying the bills will lead to trouble.  You are better off, realize it and move on.|`|0a8ffe6d0c5777e8506c5773c3acaa86aa	Only if you want to be back in the same situation.

AA11056099	Yes. I have changed my cycle several times. I finally asked my doctor why they say to start on a Sunday. And the answer was so I wouldn't have to deal with my period on the weekend.

If you can go get your own place , remember although you are in the back house you still live in your parents house and still have to follow their rules. If you cannot find anything cheaper then talk to your parents about lowering the price a little bit. That is kinda high for the back of the house.
2fa2e224702ecf3c775b23d335665f3faa	Your husband married you because he loves you.  It is easy for us to see our own "flaws", we are our own worst critic.  However, it is very easy to overlook and be blinded by the "flaws" of those that we love.  Your husband either doesn't see anything wrong with you or these things are so small and insignificant that he doesn't care to see them.  Count yourself lucky and be grateful for such a wonderful husband.|`|AA11352460	You sound like me! HA HA, I dont understand why he is so sweet and nice to me 24/7 even if I am in a bad mood.

AA11598063	The way that you are feeling right now is perfectly normal. Instead of being a really good friend to you, she said some really hurtful and mean things to you. This girl's emotions is like a roller coaster ride- one minute she is happy when it's all about her, and the next minute when it is all about you, she is not happy. I can't believe she acted like nothing happened when you got back from Europe. She's not a good friend and good friends are hard to find these days. If you really want to take the time to find out why she's acting the way she's acting, talk to her about it and call her on it. The bottom line: she doesn't deserve a friend like you. Do what you think is best for you- if you want to continue the friendship that is. Otherwise, find a new friend who will share your happiness- not just hers.|`|819e1f19fe218313b6fa5b466e0b0c40aa	You should forgive her.  I know it might sound hard, but for whatever reason she got mad, you must forgive her.  Why would you want to hold that inside and let it eat at you?  She might have felt that you were going to decide to stay in Europe.  People who are insecure like that, get mad for various reasons.  You need to be the bigger person and forgive her.  No one says you have to still be friends with her, but you can forgive her.|`|fa55f623dfe6fa800b8a0416caf753eaaa	forgive her. what are friends are for?|`|AA10501517	I think she blew up because your focus wasn't on her. That you went and did something that didn't involve her. I think your feeling like this because you don't want to give her another reason to hurt you. You need to tell her what she did that hurt you and how she's making you feel. She needs to realize that things aren't always going to be the way she wants them and she also needs to realize that her actions hurt people. Honestly I don't blame you for not wanting to have anything to do with her. Why should you be there for her when she couldn't be happy for you when you needed her to be, instead she blew up like a little kid who didn't get her way. And now that she got over it she wants you as a babysitter/friend  etc. to help her out. If I were you I'd tell her why should I be here for you when you need help but you can't be the kind of friend I am to you when I need you to be. She needs to learn that friendship goes both ways. That it's not just about her. I think you should be the one to put her in her place because maybe it would sink in better if she heard it from you. Best of luck!|`|8b9d10d1075052b40766489376f2dc3eaa	It is normal.She had no remorse for the hurt she caused.Yet she asked you to babysit. It also sounds like she is using you.

bfd938d1e00c11363a98c3f73a019713aa	To be honest with you, i think you should tell her how you really feel. If she's a true friend she would understand and put that behind her, and wouldn't make a big problem out of it. Sometimes you have to let them know.

You need to tell her how she makes you feel regardless of her feelings. She obviously doesn't care about your feelings because she keeps hurting them.    Remember, a true best friend will understand.     Start making other friends. You need them in order to realize that it won't be the end of the world if this girl chooses not to stay your friend.|`|48d11e1b0901096ef999adfe0218c27faa	If your friend is a TRUE BLUE... she should be able to handle what u need to say.

But also maybe she is just not that into it as you are so to test it do what she does go out on hang on girls like she is infront of her to see how she reacts to it thats how you will know if she feels the same or maybe she just dosent wantt o hurt your feelings so she jsut tells you what she thinks you want to hear.|`|AA12076278	Yeah|`|fff9803cd4cfeca8799a5fcef8ccdc28aa	well if you really love her, don't just say i love you. ya have show her that you love her. men should do that. i mean you should take her to dinner, a walk on the beach....... a movie! and if she hooks up with other guys try to make her understand that she doesn't need to hook with other guys and that you are the one for her that you are the only one she needs. that you will be there for her every step of the way. that you are her man!|`|3f1b3119a4d10cc91e3356e9b96268ffaa	Tom thi is how the best relationships start as friends then lover just take it slow and when your both ready it will happen|`|984aef226cb416e22fe2486f7c0ef28daa	tell her exactly what u just told all of us people without lives here at yahoo answers she won't be able to help but to fall even deeper in luv with u if u do. hope i helped

But i am learning that one should take the time to find their own path and not worry about and let other peoples ideas influence and alter your own ideals and direction too much.  Because then it becomes not your own path, but someone elses.    I try to fill the void with the things i know that make me happy and grab my interest and have faith that nature will take its course and point me in the right direction.    But when i do feel down, i ask myself why, make a list, and try to come up with solutions to cancel out this feeling. Sometimes asking others for their opinion can be helpful.

c3a8c5fd7518e47343bdc9a3982b3e02aa	To be a true friend to anybody is very hard work. Try to be on good terms with everybody you meet, but choose your friends with great care - not everyone who speaks kindly will want the best for you. Try to be honest and respectful. Be patient, generous and kind. Be very forgiving - even the best friend will cause you pain occasionally. Be ready to stick by people through thick and thin, but know your limits. Don't be too soft or people will take advantage of you. Be ready to stand your ground when you have to. A good friend asks for very little but is willing to give a lot. Any person who has these qualities will probably make an excellent friend.  Remember the old adage 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' It's the cardinal rule of good friendship.    Take care of yourself, friend.|`|AA11899313	The BEST definition i have come across that describes a 'Friend,' goes.....    ''A friend is someone whom you can make a fool of yourself in front of...........    And know that you have not made a complete job of it.''

I am a product of donor sperm, and surprising as it may be, I don't advocate it at all. It is hell to grow up this way, not knowing half of yourself and not knowing who your siblings are. Passing every man on the street and wondering if any of them are "him" is heartwrenching- as is asking every person you date what their dad did in their past, just to make sure you're not dating a sibling. Our situation is not looked at enough by people considering donor sperm for themselves, when really it is what should be the first thing considered. I'm not disregarding your desire for a child, but in your desire for your child you want what's best for them, right? The pain that we carry in our hearts and every part of our being is the cause of our parents neglect, even if they had good intentions. And this isn't to say that we don't love our parents- we do (well, most of us). But all of us would rather have been born into circumstances where we at least had a chance to know our fathers, or know that he existed. We may be a minority, but there are a good deal of us running around yearning to know our kin- the eldest that I know of us is in their 60s, and will never know their father. It really is a tragedy. Please look further into this case, into our cases before you make a choice. If you would like more information from me, message me please, as I'd be happy to give you more. Thanks|`|fbdef4e33dad43a18804c0d514a8079caa	Hey you, the icon with the red hair; turtlesomebody; Ive checked out some of your other postings; you know what, I was adopted. I went through the same things you are talking about. Guess what? I got over it, I suggest you do the same. Don't let what happened in the past rule your life this much, its called obsession and it's not healthy. If a person wants to adopt, donate, whatever, its their choice and decision. The donator is no more the parent than the person who gave me up for adoption. The people that raised me were and are my parents, they sat with me when I was sick, they cried at my wedding, they have been with me through it all. Thats a parent, a parent is not just a genetic donation or gift. So, Im sorry, but get over yourself.

(The idea is to enstil that you won't stand for anyone treating you the way you don't deserve)  It may sound like a hard reality but I've been betrayed, stabbed in the back... and all around treated like a tool. And if you don't enstil the idea you won't stand for betrayal in them, they will try and do anything they want.    On top of this if you really don't think this person is loyal to you jsut stop talking to them if they ask "why" you can take one of 2 routes to tell them why, or to just tell them that you've grown too far apart.    It sounds harsh but it's better to cover your **** then to live in fear.

You suggest women are doing the men a favor because they are trying to chain them...im sorry, change them.        Well more importantly you've asked so many WHY questions that are also assumptions, that is impossible to answer all in one.    Abuse is a term that has the range of infinity that someone is always going to try and use to persuade someone else by saying "you should not take 'that' kind of abuse".  What's worse?  Physical or mental.  Which has more devestating consequences?    cheating is a type of abuse certainly, an abuse of respect towards another you have vowed to remain faithful to (not necessarily mirage, Im sorry marriage).    Is who really a man?  The guy who cheats, sure he's a man.  Ive cheated before but I am actively faithful and committed.  Lesson learned.  Maybe you could learn your own lesson by deciding you (women)shouldnt try to change him or teach him a lesson show him who's boss by doing him a favor,   Greatly loaded question! :)  I had fun answering it.

They are also rather well off financially.|`|aef517b295ae3c0278c38379d2299101aa	well seriously, I have nothing against Iranian people. You are people just like everybody else. There is nothing weird about you.You just come from a different culture.|`|fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	Of the Iranians I know, they are all friendly and great people to be around. Iran has a rich culture and history. If only the US government and the Iranian government could get along better but I was happy to hear that the Iranian president was against legislation to make all Americans get fingerprinted. He was right in saying his problem is not with the American people but with Bush. I am not American so I do not subscribe to Bush's point of view not that all Americans support Bush.

a8d84474cd0c157fccb3be985125bdf3aa	Wow, you must be a good guy if you want to be a district attorney. good for you! I would not move to England for her, but I would ask her out before she leaves. Tell her that you want to give a shot before she goes, or your will always wonder if "she's the girl that got away". This will probably melt her heart (or it might creep her out), but either way if she's leaving you really don't have anything to lose, right? (But don't move for her if your dream is to stay in NYC - moving for someone usually ends up in disaster - I can attest to that!). Good luck.|`|c9cc8b2a57096c5bcd84e21040942293aa	Dude!  Look at the question!   Would you rather have a relationship with a non-friend?  Give it a shot.  Most people get together for the sex thing hoping to find more in the reltionship.  The best thing that can come out of that is friendship!  You already have that going.  Let her know your true feelings!  I'll bet she feels the same about you!|`|AA12324159	Dude!  Just tell her already, make sure you get her attention this time!  Oh the friends thing, well, that is sort of a touchy area, but one has to remember also, best friends do make best lovers!  Or so the saying goes...|`|e86372f889afb42945014df17595981baa	Life is short so just try to ask her out. I mean whats the worst that can happen?|`|3e3bd7b44592a1bdc1d2b87120f3dba7aa	take the risk,ask her out.good luck|`|b499ce67148237fadff6cc7ad642fcc1aa	well, its okay to be shy but think of it that way, if u didnt tell her that you like her maybe someone will and you would keep wondering what would have happened if u asked her first , beside arent you bestfriends?? then you understand her well, you can start doing things for her that you know she likes, and girls like , like buying flowers and choclates, movies on sat, hanging out alot , regarding long distance relationship works if both sides are loyal and are deeply in love , if it didnt work out i am sure it was worth trying, you will never lose anything if you try and dont miss out a chance with someone you love|`|AA11149006	Geez, just ask her out and worry about the rest of it as it unfolds.|`|AA12307902	dude, ask her out!!!!!!!|`|d0216f291820c0afb9e4e9345f6f26eaaa	So just go for it just practice in a mirrior cuz pratice amkes perfect so give it a try good luck!|`|fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	Go for it because if you don't, you will wonder what if. Long distance relationships have worked in the past so you don't need to give up your dreams plus it seems like one of your dreams is to be with her. If it's something really worth having, then you have to take risks. Good luck and I hope it works for the best.

AA11375224	Well, first try all the search engines, Yahoo, Google, etc.  Do a search for his name in quotes: "James Gibbs" and also without quotes.  Quotes is usually better.  Next try all the online White Pages, like Yahoo People Search and SmartPages.com, Addresses.com, Lycos People Search, Netscape White Pages, Anywho.com.    If you strike out on all of those, then you go to the "private detective" sort of websites, try ussearch.com    If you know what school he went to, try reunion.com or any of the other sites like that, and maybe you can find a classmate who knows where he is.      If he was in the military, same thing goes, find the webpage for his unit and try to find someone there who knows him.    If that all fails, there are some longshot things you can do.  Go to the sheriffs website for orange county or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, they both used to have an index of anyone who had been arrested in their county, so that might help if he has been a bad boy.    You can do a search on the Orange County website to see if he is listed on the tax rolls as a property owner.  If you know someone in the police department or at the license tag bureau they could try to look him up (although this is against their rules, so don't get caught)    Call the library in Orlando and see if they can look in the old phone books to see if there was a listing for him.  If so, use a "City Directory" to find who his neighbors were, then call them to see if they know where he went, or if he left a forwarding address.  The post office might be able to help you here also if you ask nicely.    If you still can't find him... I would recommend hiring a private detective in Orlando to track him down.  This is not cheap, but if you find the right guy, he will have connections and will be able to find him within 24 hours usually.   Be prepared to pay a hefty fee.|`|AA12359948	Good for you.|`|8c0d04482a8ad9e87fdf74b628f039d7aa	I heard he ran  away with the circus..
3c475f6b9ebfeda317d91febb7021f75aa	Its what you've grown up with & what you've been used to so its not abnormal. It sounds like its the people around you that have a problem with the way you act & talk not that you have a problem with them. A lot of people can be quite narrow minded, you've just got to find that person that takes you for who you are...you must be special to be able to relate to other races, a trait which should be encourage as so many others single each other out.|`|fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	I find it not abnormal at all. You've been growing up with black women around you. It doesn't matter what the color of the skin is, it matters who they are inside and if the two of you match. In terms of suggestions, go out with whoever  you want to go out with. In this day and age of increasing globalization, it's become more accepted to have interracial relations and it seems like while you do not look like them, you have adapted to their mannerisms. Good luck.|`|8dca01be03f49cd8873cb23add75bf01aa	is ok..|`|19edb6a45dbd0cb141f2c1cb923a9e09aa	You were raised different than  most white boys!

It must have been difficult for you to have been raised in foster care.  That may be some of the reasons that you feel pain. If you are more attracted to black women then I don't see a problem with that.  You did not mention ever being with a white woman so I guess that you never have.  Maybe a mixed race woman would be another avenue for you to explore.  Be with a white woman if you want to and see how you like it!|`|AA11840238	lol, yeah I guess it is, though I'm attracted to hispanic women, and asian's a little, black woman, just beyonce, mexicans, eva longoria, asian don't know! but I guess it has ben hardd fo ya brotha, well take it ez!|`|AA10649888	Normal? i donno its a matter of preference its human though. personally i have never found myself attracted to other races its just a thought that never entered my mind, not to say that there aren't some beautiful people of other races in the world, but its not my FIRST thought when i see someone...  thinking about what u said about ur upbringing i guess it makes sense ur attracted to what u are USED to and i guess that is how most people are they are used to their race or what environment they are raised in...    I think its a matter of personal preference or what ur comfortable with. and yes i 'm sorry i have been one of those "ur cute for a white boy" persons, but don't take it personally its actually a complement b/c they at least considered u.

fe476205f1d7373eff5d787708786a66aa	It's natural to feel nervous about meeting his grandparents. It means that this relationship is more than just a fling. Maybe you are worried. First of all, don't worry. The fact that he loves you enough and feels that something is possible is apparent as he introduces you to his extended family. People get what they deserve and if that means you have a great guy, then that is who you deserve. Your boyfriend is a great match. As the sparks fly, don't worry about feeling inadequate. He thinks you are perfect or else he wouldn't be with you. Take care and good luck.|`|FphKaKWtaa	from the way you are talking i think you deserve him and i think he is the one to decide that ....dont worry sweety it will go well i guess just show them that you care for him so that they like you ..in other words be your self.....good luck

fI5c2jmzaa	Io sono geloso e non poco,ma ho fatto un lavoro  su questa cosa...ed ho capito che...La gelosia parte dalle nostre insicurezze... abbiamo fondamentalmente paura di perdere una persona perch dentro abbiamo un giudizio o una poca AUTOSTIMA di noi stessi.SECONDOFacciamo i Gelosi anche quando pensiamo che una 3 persona ti possa portar via qualcosa di Tuo.SBAGLIATISSIMO...,il partner non  nostro.TERZO,ci si deve interrogare perch a volte e cosi forte questo sentimento...In tanti casi  il partner a farci abbassare il livello di fiducia,non attraverso il fatto che guarda altre ragazze-i,ma quando scopriamo aspetti trasgressivi,poco corretti,un certo attaccamento al piacere,tutto questo noi lo ingeriamo e si trasforma in gelosia,perch cominciamo a vederli sotto l'aspetto naturale della vita che si pu anche cedere da qualche parte e non pi come quando ci si conosceva da poco tempo,quindi dei SANTI...e voi ripensate a quando avete  conosciuto l'altra persona i primi tempi eravate gelosi???SICURAMENTE NO!!!  L'ultimo fattore che scatena questa cosa e la nostra AMBIGUITA', cio quando pensiamo che il partner possa tradirci e perche noi per primi nei nostri pensieri,con uno sguardo,una provocazione ETCETC lo facciamo, e NON SIAMO MORALISTI DICENDO CHE A NOI NON SUCCEDE QUESTO ci succede ci succede,e poi pretendiamo che il partner si debba comportare alla perfezione.In pratica la gelosia  normalissima dal punto di vista umano perch abbiamo di questi limiti e ci dobbiamo fare i conti,bisogna gestirla ogni volta e vedrai man mano aquisterai pi sicurezza anche in te, perch dipende tutto da questa cosa, e quando ti succede una qualcosa, dentro di te non scendere a compromessi nel farti male con la gelosia, ma ditti IO VALGO e NON AVERE PAURA DI UN CONFRONTO CON UN 'ALTRA PERSONA,SE TI AMA,RIMARRA' AL TUO FIANCO...OLTRETUTTO E ANCHE UNA DIMOSTRAZIONE SE IL TUO PARTNER FA PER TE...COMUNQUE PARLANE ANCHE CON LUI TI AIUTERA' TANTISSIMO|`|SvGonxTZaa	Anch'io soffro della stessa 'malattia'.Sono il tipo che fa scenate anche al grande hotel,davanti a tutti!!purtroppo la gelosia eccessiva  sinonimo di insicurezza...|`|01e8bd23e2db171bb0f59cbe4ba5b0d5aa	ti capisco,lo sono anche io,al punto che arrivo a sognarlo anche la notte!nn ho motivi per esserlo ma penso sia una questione di carattere.|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	io sono gelosissima, ma una volta lo ero ancora di pi. cerco di evitare le situazioni pericolose tipo andarlo a trovare mentre lavora (lui  un istruttore in palestra); il lavoro che fa lo porta molto al contatto umano, poi lo so che lui non fa niente anche perch sarebbe poco professionale, ma vedere le ragazzine idiote che fanno le oche con lui mi mandarebbe in delirio, quindi evito di farlo (anche perch andare l e farle fuori a mazzate sui denti sarebbe controproducente...perderebbe clienti e poi dovrei mantenerlo io!!!!)

85959e768b1d42be82d47c928b7fabc5aa	They can be pricey, but it depends on where you live and what your income looks like.  I couldn't drive when I was in high school for medical reasons, and didn't get my license until I was 25.  I went to a private school, and paid something like $210 total for the school.  I think it was $160 for the lessons and $50 for materials or something like that.  It looks like the same company is now charging $260 - $270 for the 9-day course.  And you also need to have money for the state licensing fee and for the road test (I took it from the company the driving school recommended, and found it to be a pleasant experience--no waiting in line for the test, and when I went to the driver license office, I was all ready to go with my paperwork).    The 9-day course means it covers 9 days, but that may take 6 to 9 weeks to get the 9 days in, depending on when they hold classes, when you can drive with the instructors, etc.  I didn't get as much instruction on how to care for my car as my friends did in public school, but I think the rest of my instruction was superior to what my friends received.|`|491da8cbb96de0df0de6597a38440541aa	It depends on which state you live in do you have a good driving friend that can teach you you've taken drivers Ed so you are ahead of the game just pray and have courage you can do this never let anyone tell you that you can't do something. My mom never learned to drive and got married at 17 she got her drivers license at the age of about 45 and she was scared but she did it don't wait Good luck and God bless you I will pray for your strength and resolve in this matter good grades keep it up
AA10100909	Fact from fiction, truth from diction. You want more out of him and a relationship with him. Sadly, you are not going to get it. You can be dumb enough and let him between you and your Victorias but he will soon be gone and if he corks you up with a little one, he will be out of there like a ferret through the back fence. Appears to me the more you say "no" the more he makes it his mission to get you naked. I do not even think he has any real love for you or he would be going out of his way to spend time with you. You know how you create situations to be with one you really like. But he is not doing that. Don't waste anymore time. If you keep listening, you may fall under the spell and be just another notch in the gun belt.|`|d7496fcc8e5ea74b3f76a7b930122a20aa	forget about him.... there are 1000 of really good guys in this world... i always wonder why you girls are never interested in them...|`|NZkpPOGmaa	What more do you want?

BUT, like the other lady said, there's thousands of guys that will treat you right. if he wants sex so badly, let him go to 5 finger mary....
18ZACuQZaa	Sad to say, it sounds like he used you. Now that he's gotten what he hoped to get. It appears he either has moved on to another girl or he wants you to feel like you owe you something. Either way, I don't think you should call him. As I think he'll only use you again. As a man myself. It's awful to think that he was using you and manipulating you for the sole purpose of having sex with you.|`|c2Rbmyu2aa	it's a scam. a VERY weak scam. it's what con-artists do.|`|sP0QHgYXaa	You got used.

Why would you call him?  Are you delusional?  That situation makes me feel sick to my stomach.  Why would you want to be involved with someone like that.  He was obviously using you and testing out the merchandise.  don't be so naive!!|`|a6d47b4cacf89b67bb3a0ebe61dade8faa	If he doesnt have the decency to call someone he had sex with and seems to like very much from the way he treated you in the beginning, hes no good! Call him one more time and tell him that if he expects to see you again, he should make an effort to do so. If he doesnt call, honey, you gotta let go. Because if its true that hes a pimp, then he might keep coming to you for sex when he feels the need. Do not allow him to do so!!!

veXjwrIxaa	Hmm maybe before? Since you guys talked for a year ..   it'd be weird and awkward if she recieved a V-day thing from you when you guys haven't talked in ages.

Personally I think it's trashy to have sex the first time you meet someone, whether you're a male or female.  That's the kind of behavior that spreads disease and leads to unwanted pregnancies.  If you think you need to sleep w/ a person to get them to like you, 1) they're probably not worth it and 2) you need to find some self-confidence and learn to think more highly of yourself.|`|AA11328491	I LOVE, LOVE LOVE Bed Buddies!!...They are fabulous if you can stay unattached!....You are great friends and you know what each other wants and needs....Usually have very open, honest communication and I just think it is GREAT!!!!.....

Just believe that life is way too short to be wasted on such people. I know you will miss her, take all the time u want and delte from your list and move on.

What ruins relationships is the way you break up.  Obviously people don't plan ahead for their break-ups, but you may want to keep this in mind about how long you think you might be together, and whether you want to get emotionally attached or not.  If you think it might end badly then don't do it, if you just want to sleep with him you can set it up in a way that, if it doesn't work out too well, you can call it an "accident" and keep your friendship.  Otherwise just get yourself another guy.|`|da42bcc55c4f3f34a0dca875889fe02aaa	I like one of my friends too.

With me, it turned out well. We're still close friends but we were never boyfriend/girlfriend or went on a real date. You have to decide if it's worth risking a friendship for. But since you guys are really good friends, you must have a lot in common or have similar interests which is always good. I know your mind is  going haywire. Don't overanalyze it and follow your instincts. Good luck with whatever you choose.
ca7edc2d7e40026ca0cf75a53626e9ccaa	Well age isnt really a factor here. If you love someone or care dearly about them it doesnt matter the age. If she is happy then you should be happy for her.

Generally, one of their responsibilities based on my own personal experience as a stage manager at my school is to maintain order backstage. That means telling people to be quiet so it could have been totally natural. I can't say if he likes you but this guy doesn't really seem to care. Yes, he complimented your outfit but if he doesn't care about what you say then he's only interested physically. Is that what you want? Or do you want a meaningful relationship? If you want something meaningful, find someone else. It doesn't seem like he deserves you.

eRj8mWASaa	First of all never let anyone make you feel bad about yourself. Second, I'm betting that the reason she told you was not the real reason, girls like to play games like that. I bet she don't hate you either, she is just acting that way because again girls are just like that. Just remember that you are a great person and you have something to offer another girl. Why do you want to only please her? Talk to someone that you wouldn't normally talk to and see where the conversation goes. Open your eyes a little more and i'm sure you will notice that this world is full of interesting people. Finally you are NOT pathedic, break-ups are always hard, just remember that if it was ment to be than you would still be with her. The universe is telling you to keep looking.

y4WuNn4aaa	Me parece que la primera respuesta que te escribieron es la mejor, por lo general y no es por genero, uno siempre busca el mismo tipo de persona, quizs el paquete por fuera cambie un poco, pero por dentro es lo mismo. Me parece que por la forma en que haces la pregunta, el problema esta en ti.    Haz la prueba tu misma, aquellos amigos o amigas que cambian de pareja frecuentemente (no hablo de promiscuos, por favor), te dars cuenta que siempre tienen el mismo problema, siempre.    Quizs veas las cosas mejor desde otra perspectiva, porque no cambias de circulo de gente, frecuentas otros lugares, SOLA, y ves si puedes lidiar con otro tipo de gente, as te dars cuenta de cual es tu destino , o en el mejor de los casos veras la luz, ya que ningn hombre el igual, y tambin podemos cambiar.|`|Td2fNNrDaa	uno moldea a su pareja, si aguantas que te haga lo que el quiere y no sabes darte tu valor y lugar, ser independiente obvio que todos los hombres que pasen por tu vida van a ser unos patanes.|`|umhotK5vaa	no creo! por eso prefiero a las mujeres!      hablando en serio, todas las personas, hombres o mujeres tenemos cosas que nos identifican como tales, pero otras que nos hacen nicos, estas caractersticas son las que debemos buscar en la gente que conocemos, creo sinceramente que todos tenemos algo positivo (aunque en algunos casos es imposible encontrarlo!)|`|JoKp9Jp1aa	Yo soy distinto.|`|Rvg6KBQXaa	TODOS!!!!

Te aconsejo que no lo pases por alto no es lo correcto...

Aun cuando tu marido pago por la casa les pertenece a los dos. No es exclusivamente de el. Creo que debes de hablar con el y preguntarle porque hizo lo que hizo y si con eso te quiso decir que te puede sacar de la casa cuando quiera. Debes aclarar esta situacion antes de que las cosas lleguen a mayores. Quien sabe que hara si se enoja mas.|`|6kYrKzQ2aa	? Queeeee eso es maltrato llama a la polica y denuncia lo.

Tus amigos debern hacer lo mismo (una cuenta), en el chat podis reuniros (puedes llamar a varios amigos a la vez)todos y este chat es indetectable como tal, adems al ser conexiones https (pc a pc) el servidor proxi de tu empresa no puede cortarlas, pues debera cortar todo el acceso a la red para conseguirlo.   La cuenta es peque?a (3MB) pero no caduca en el tiempo, es inviolable por hackeo y es totalmente segura si mandas correo a otra del mismo sistema (safe-mail) pues no sale a la red.     Que te sirva.

Ci si pu amare ed essere incompatibili per cui  meglio staccarsi definitivamente. La storia del tipo '' se a sett. ma mancherai ti richiamo...'' mi sa un p di uno che sa benissimo quello che tu provi per lui e se ne sta approfittando! Frequenta altre persone e datti del tempo prima di metterti con qualcuno, il chiodo scaccia chiodo non serve, devi prima ritrovare te stessa e questo non riuscirai a farlo se difronte ad ogni richiesta del tuo ex tu dici si. L'amore che hai per lui  forte, ma non credo che sia ricambiato al 100%. Abbi stima di te stessa ed inizia a voler bene prima a te poi a qualcun'altro che lo merita. E' il consiglio di una che ci  passata e che si stava autodistruggendo anche fisicamente.    Buona Fortuna e scusa ancora per la crudelt delle mie parole, ma sui sentimenti non posso mentire.
