20070611164625AAMyCRz	Sports;Football (American)	Genarlow Wilson??	Can you believe it? After serving 2 years of a 10 year sentence in prison for a consensual act of oral sex with a 15 year old girl when he was 17, Genarlow Wilson was ordered to be released from prison. But the Georgia attorney general,Thurbert Baker(quite possibly the biggest D!ck on earth) filed an appeal to keep him in jail. This @sswipe wants the poor kid to spend 8 more years in jail and spend the rest of his life a sex offender for nothing(how does he sleep at night?).  Is this his idea of really justice?The girl even siad multiple times it was consensual!!! What do you think of that?

20080520005333AA4uHIo	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (Other)	Should the captaincy at Barcelona be given to Xavi or Inniesta?	I think Puyol has had a poor season - after Deco he has conceded the highest number of cards and just the other night made two reckless challenges which gave the opposition a penalty and a free kick, both of hich resulted in goals.  The team have underperformed this season and as a result the manager loses his job so whilst I don't think Puyol should leave the squad it seems only right that he also takes some responsibility and therefore should give up the armband to another player - preferably a catalan who has come up through the ranks and has the good attitude and performance record to be considered captain - to me this should be Xavi but I'm interested to see what anyone else thinks?

20071117145621AAP9ZN8	Sports;Wrestling	Why are heels bad and faces good?	I don't mean bad as in bad guys and good as in good guys? What i mean is that i don't root for a wrestler depending on his popularity. I treat it as if a superstar was like a sports team, I root for them when they are the champion, and i continue to do so when they lose match after match after match. But why is it when a wrestler seems like they can never be beaten when they are the fan favorite. But when they are hated, they can only win a match by means of cheating or interference. Prime example, I've always been a die hard Triple H fan, therefore I was an Evolution fan. So therefore I like Randy Orton, Batista and Ric Flair. When Randy Orton won the World Championship, Evolution turned there back on him and he became an instant favorite. But see, when someone like Orton is like they are capable of pulling off wins like his legendary performance over Chris Benoit for the World Title at Summerslam a couple years back. And now, Orton sucks and is the most hated wrestler. Any thoughts?

Don Nelson) overpaid, arrogant, self-centered athletes would do. He tells the guys to run (which every in shape player wants to do except Fat Shaq and Crybaby Glen Davis-lol), shoot the rock without disregard for the shot clock and play no d. However he's going to win multiple coach of the years, but will always fall short against defensive minded  coaches (Ex. Gregg Poppavich and Avery Johnson in the Western Conference the last few years). The ball is in your court. What do you think?

20090305040049AANqGid	Sports;Wrestling	What happened to the Kliq?	The kliq, probably the most famous group of wrestling buddies in real life. It consisted of Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Sean Waltman and Justin Credible. When all these wrestlers were up and coming in the WWE they formed a real-life alliance/friendship where they would look after one another in the wrestling business. Of course Scott Hall and Kevin Nash went to WCW for more money but years later WCW folded leaving WWE the only show in town making heaps of money in the process. So what happened to this group? Shawn Michaels and Triple H are the only ones that have stayed in the WWE with WWE not only dominating the wrestling industry and making heaps of money but also Michaels and Triple H, especially Triple H wield real life power in the company. So now that Triple H has overly made it, why isnt he helping out his Kliq buddies? I know in the early 2000's Nash, Hall, Waltman and Credible had a run in the WWE but it was short-lived with all 4 stars soon leaving the company. Hall is the only one i am aware of the reason why he got released because of an alcohol problem, but why arn't the Kliq running wild all over WWE, the biggest show in town making a crap load of money with their Kliq buddie Triple H looking after them with the creative power he now has with the WWE?

Très cher monsieur Oreo, apparamment le fait de lire des avis différents des tiens t′amène à faire des envolées lyriques exceptionelles.............   Dire que l′Italie a joué un football de merde, n′est en rien être raciste ou être chauvin, d′ailleurs ce terme utilisé vient de journalistes brésiliens et pas de moi.   Deuxiémement critiquer son intelocuteur sans le conna?tre démontre une frustration interne mal acceptée.   Donc malheureusement, tu es le genre de fran?ais qui appelle raciste toute personne qui critique une nation étrangère, c′est exactement ce genre de personne qui m′a amené à quitter la France il y a plus de dix ans............   Une vision de l′extérieur te ferait peut-être du bien pour voir que les italiens n′ont pas été seulement critiqué en France mais dans de nombreux pays, d′ailleurs Cannavaro ne gagnera certainement pas le titre de meilleur joueur du monde car il est voté par des joueurs et des entraineurs qui en savent plus que beaucoup de journalistes.........

20090305043543AAclmTp	Sports;Football (American)	So, since T.O. was dumped by da Cowboys, and Torry Holt wants the Rams to release him, do they switch teams?	It wouldn't be a trade, since T.O. is going to be released, and Torry Holt wants his release.  Still, wouldn't it be interesting to see Torry Holt a Cowboy and Terrell Owens a Ram?  Like Steve Mariucci on nfl.com said, it's very puzzling that the Cowboys didn't trade T.O. because they don't have a first round pick.  Surely the Cowboys could have landed a first round pick if trading someone of T.O.'s caliper.        I believe the Cowboys did him wrong.  He wasn't the problem in the locker room.  I hope whatever team he ends up with, he burns the Cowboys when both teams play the next time.
