20090128094537AAQL1hu	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Working with my artist on a large design?	I've never used my artist to help me design a tattoo before, so this is new to me.      I have the bottom half and the top half of my back done, but there is a gap in the middle and down each side. I have an image from a book that I want in the gap in the middle, it will need to be reworked as the detail is too fine as it is but I don't think I'll have a problem explaining that to him. However, while I'm at it I want to create a design that will spread out along the middle gap and reach out into part of the gaps on each side. The top and bottom bits that I already have hold a deep meaning for me, the image from the book will be symbolic to me, however the stuff at the sides will be 'decoration' to make my back more presentable and aesthetically pleasing. All my tattoos so far are black, so I want some colour added to the sides (and there is colour in the image that will go in the middle). I can semi-envisage what I want my back to look like, I'm picturing vines with lots of black but vivid green peeping through, large leaves and japanese style flowers, again with a lot of black but vivid colour peeping through, and then some small white doves (symbolic to me) flying up towards my shoulder blades.      That is as much description as I can muster for what I'm actually envisaging. Do you think my artist will be able to take that and work with it? I'm scared that he's going to spend ages drawing up a big design and I'll hate it! Do you have any tips for the whole 'getting-your-artist-to-draw-up-your-des... process?

I have trouble drinking out of soda cans and bottles with wide brims (like vitamin water),kissing is an embarrassing experience and when I wrestle it gets really beat up on because the other wrestlers use it against me. SO what I want to know is what your opinion on plastic surgery and should I get it before I head off to college?      Here is a picture of me       http://img407.imageshack.us/my.php?image...       Thanks      Chuck!

20090128120754AAROqHv	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	What should I do about this piercing situation?	I am 20 year old female and I live with my parents. I have a small heart tattoo on my hand, my tragus pierced, 2 helix piercings, a nose piercing and my ears stretched. I have approached my mother about the fact that I am into the subculture of tattoo's and piercings and she is well aware of this. Out of respect, I told my mother that I am getting a shoulder chest piece when I have a proper influx of money and she said she doesn't approve but didn't over react. I told her that I wanted to get my tongue pierced and she want absolutely crazy saying she thinks that it is disgusting and she would not let me live in the house if I got that done. I keep asking her why she is so against it but she just sticks with that fact that she thinks people who have their tongues pierced are disgusting. Okay, flash to a couple of weeks later. I have let go of the tongue piercing for a while and actually went to an amazing piercer (brian decker of pure body arts check him out his is a body mod rock-star) and got my nipples pierced last saturday. Absolutely no pain and healing going so well it's almost disappointing. To make a long story as short as possible, my mom figured out that I got my nips pierced and she is acting as though I did this specifically to hurt her. I need to know how to make my parents understand that this is a lifestyle choice that I want to live and that even though they are saying I can not get anything done, I am going to do it. Not out of disrespect to them, just because it is something that I perceive to be beautiful, meaningful, and in a lot of ways (the act of being pierced, the healing period and the knowing that it is there) spiritual?      I also have a birthday coming up and a boyfriend who is willing to dish out a good amount of cash to aid in getting a tattoo/scarification piece/or another piercing. So I will not be paying money for my next body mod. But they do not like him so I can not tell them that he is paying for it. I just need some way to assure that they know I am not paying for anything any time soon.       I need to know how to have a conversation with my close minded parents to convince them that im not trying to hurt them and that im only expressing myself in a way that suits me.       Thank you in advance.

20090128142153AAxQLXC	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Ladies, do you think I have a good idea?	It's just a thought... not the biggest deal in the world.  :)  Here is my idea:  some women think too much about plastic surgery to get the right bottom or chest or feet or nose... when that stuff is just biology and does not point to fashion sense.  I think a woman could just wear her shirt tucked in and look sexy and it would cost her a lot less than going through reconstructive surgery.  Also, stuff like shoes and bracelets and earrings and hair ribbons... all of those are just extra details that only count if the FOUNDATION is right.  To me, just a regular shirt tucked in (worn SOMETIMES, not necessarily ALWAYS) will show her fashion sense much more and at a much less pricey rate.      Ladies, do you think I have a good idea?

20090128142914AAfeW2P	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Should I have my Chest Shaved?	Last summer I went for a pre-holiday hair cut.  The barber asked if I would be going shirtless much and, if so, as his shop was quiet would I would like my back shaving too.  I don't particularly like having a hairy back so agreed and was pleased enough with the results that he's done it three or four times for me since.      Last time I went in, the shop was busy so he just cut my hair but his parting shot was, if it was quieter next time I visit, he'd shave my back and did I want to consider having my chest shaved too?  I can't really say that I have a firm view one way or the other - I don't dislike my chest hair but, equally, wonder what it would be like without it for a few weeks - hence this question to see what others think.  Also interested if anyone has had it done, what's it like?  e.g. is it true that it itches as it grows back?   The last time I went in

20090128143321AAbmEf7	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Are women aroused by men who wear sexy underwear such as g/strings, thongs and string bikinis?	I am seeking womens women's only please.    I have a fetish for womens lingerie.  I don't wear women's underwear myself, but I find everywhere I go, I am looking at women's backsides to see the outline of their panties.  I especially like seeing the outline of women's g-strings under skirts or pants.  I extremely like seeing the outline of g-strings on women that wear tight track pants or cycling pants.  I love seeing string sided panties on women in white see through skirts.      Because of my fetish, I have found I wear men's string sided bikini underwear.  I also wear g-strings and thongs of all materials including satin and silk and colors are white, red, blue, etc.  I have bought lingerie fetish novels.  My underwear is men's style not women's.  When I wear my underwear I feel sexy and I often try to let women see my underwear when I am shopping.  For example, when I wear g-strings/thongs, I ocassionally wear white jeans so my underwear is visable.  I also bend over in shops to look at items on lower shelves hoping women will see the outline of my underwear to if my pants fall down a little when bending over my g/string/thong is fully visable.  I also surf and when I change out of my wetsuit in the carpark I want women to see me in my underwear. I feel sexy.  I also want to write my own lingerie/underwear fantasy novel.    My questions are - are women aroused by men who wear g/strings/thongs and string sided bikinis?      And are there women out there who perve on mens backsides in shopping centres etc to see if they have sexy underwear on?    And if yes to the questions above, are these women plentiful or is it rare to find a women who loves men in such underwear?    And out of curiousity, how many women have lingerie fetishes and do any of you dliberately show off your underwear in public (ie by wearing short or see through skirts, tight pants etc) and do you get aroused by men (in public siutations) looking at your visable underwear lines or exposed underwear?

20081101232537AAdbYzR	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Did I "Pass" as a Girl for Halloween (pic included)?	For Halloween, I thought it would be fun to dress as a girl (I'm a guy). I asked everyone for ideas, and got a lot of responses. Most people also wanted to see a picture after I was done. Well, here is the question I originally asked, PLUS a pic:      "My friend Crystal gets really into Halloween, so I told her I would go to a party w/ her. She asked if I would dress like a "girly girl" as my costume. I didn't have any other costumes in mind, so I said Ok. How should I dress for Halloween? I'm 22, about 5' 8" and 130lbs, so there's a lot I can wear. I don't care what I wear, I don't really get embarrassed--plus I'll be drunk, so I really won't care. How far should I go with this, should I wear underwear too? Is there anything to worry about?"      Halloween (and the parties) were a LOT of fun, but I don't think I would ever dress like a girl again. I know the skirt was a lil short, but I had so many girls whistling and guys smacking my ***, it got to be annoying (and embarrassing). Please let me know how you think I looked as a girl though!!!
