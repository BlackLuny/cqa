He married a woman and she got pregnant and was only 3 or 5 months along and when she went into labor there was a whole bunch of doctors there confused about it.  The baby was normal.      2.)  The only thing I remember was a pregnant woman who was bleeding bad after she had the baby but a white light came and she woke up.  It might be the 4400 because it might be a tv show but I believe it was before the 4400 was made.

Now that i'm done, i can try to catch up so i can watch it regularly. But the "Ronnie Chase", "Gene Shelly" and "Roxy St. James" episodes are nowhere to be found.   Anyone know where i can find them?

I think most people that say that this is no big deal are ppl who are not asian. Think about, are you saying that Asians have goofy faces? If everyone was supposed to make "goofy" faces, then why is the Asian not making the goofy face? would you say she was having fun if she was making fun of black, or hispanics? i think you would get offended? Just cuz she is a young pretty cerliberty dosen`t mean she can be racist.

Now, I know that he was blond as a kid, and blond on Smallville, but he's got light brown hair on Supernatural. Is that his natural hair color (for all of his hair), or is his hair cut so short that you can only see the darker color near the roots, or is it dyed for the show?      Just a question that's been rattling around in my brain.

20090304134533AAbXVD6	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What are bands that you like the music of, but the vocalist's voice makes you like them less?	Sorry, the question is very verbose.   Are there any bands that you enjoy the music of, but the vocalist's voice makes you like them less?      For me there is:   Guns N Roses   Clutch   Blind Guardian   Opeth   High on Fire      Now I don't want to get flamed for saying how I don't like these vocalists. The music is awesome, but the vocalists are either annoying (Guns N Roses) or a little out of my taste (the other four bands listed)      So, what about you?
20090304135736AAXo8tq	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Who do you think is better/who do you like more: Boston or Foreigner?

I love how Boston is so epic ("A Man I'll Never Be", "Foreplay/Longtime", etc) but I love Lou Gramm's voice. Then again, Brad Delps's was absolutely amazing...   I CAN'T CHOOSE!      What do you say?

The place was hopping with music and loud conversation and every once in a while "the lights would turn off."      Each time the lights would go out, the place would erupt into cheers.      However, when the revelers saw the nun, the room went dead silent.      She walked up to the bartender, and asked, "May I please use the rest-room ?"       The bartender replied, "OK, but I should warn you that there is a statue of a naked man in there wearing only a fig leaf."      "Well, in that case, I'll just look the other way," said the nun.      So the bartender showed the nun to the back of the restaurant.      After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place stopped just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause.          She went to the bartender and said, "Sir, I don't   understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the rest-room?"      "Well, now they know you're one of us," said the bartender, "Would you like a drink?"      "No thank you, but, I still don't understand," said the puzzled nun.      "You see," laughed the bartender, "every time someone lifts the fig leaf on that statue, the lights go out."      "Now, how about that drink?"

He was performing the highlight of his show when a parrot walked onstage and squawked, "It's in his sleeve!"       The magician chased the bird away.       The next day the magician was performing his highlight again (in front of a smaller audience) when the parrot walked onstage and declared, "It's in his pocket!"       The next day, as he was performing the highlight, he saw the parrot in the crowd. But before the parrot could ruin the magic trick, the boat crashed into a rock and sank.       The magician was lucky enough to find a board to hang on to. On the other end of the board was the parrot.       They stared at each other for three full days, neither of them saying anything, when suddenly the parrot said, "I give up, what'd you do with the ship?"

It just hurts that he thinks he has to lie over small things. what can i do to make him feel more at ease, or is it something that i didnt do?    basically, i just want to know where im at fault so that i can fix things, and how i can make my guy feel like he can open up more.

Come with me running through the forest, you'll see, you'll feel so much better!"      The giraffe looks at him, looks at the joint, tosses it and goes off    running with the rabbit. Then they come across an elephant doing coke, so the rabbit again says, "Elephant my friend, why do you do this? Think about your health. Come running with us through the pretty forest, you'll see, you'll feel so good!"      The elephant looks at them, looks at his razor, mirror and all, then tosses them and starts running with the rabbit and giraffe.      The three animals then come across a lion about to shoot up... "Lion my friend, why do you do this? Think about your health! Come running with us through the sunny forest, you will feel so good!" The lion looks at him, puts down his needle, and starts to beat the crap out of the little rabbit. As the giraffe and elephant watch in horror, they look at him and ask, "Lion, why did you do this? He was merely trying to help us all!" The lion answers, "That little idiot makes me run around the forest like an idiot for hours every time he's on ecstasy!"

She had only just noticed this but then thats Scarlett Adams for you. It had been 2PM when the interview had started, when all the kids had been in class apart from a few gangs hanging in the corridor.

20090304135724AA0D8nx	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Does anybody have any idea where I might be able to find physical copies of these cds?	House Of Heroes - The End Is Not The End   Half The World - The Death Defying Years      The HOH album was supposed to be released yesterday, but I cannot find any retailers who have it. I looked yesterday too. I really doubt that everyone everywhere just completely sold out, because while they are an awesome band, they just aren't THAT popular. But I don't think that they moved the release date again either, because there is no mention of doing any such thing on their website or anywhere else for that matter.   As for Half The World, I just don't know where to look. They are not signed to a major label, but they have their songs up on iTunes and (supposedly) have some sort of limited nationwide distribution.       If anyone knows where I might find either one of these great albums it would be awesome!

So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---leaving me out there BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there on my tippytoes, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???      What mental images are so hilarious to visualize that makes people laugh so hard?

They did plural scaleS, so I am unsure if they mean more than one.      When they say prepare a tune and ballad, I am completely lost, all help appreciated here.      Thanks for all the help guys!

20090304151750AA3TwvW	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Noise Song For Wednesday #106 (I See....)?	Some may call this next selection a bit euphonious. I would strongly disagree with that. I have used this before, but it was the album version. This band definitely attains something special when performing live; a certain madness takes control -which I use loosely-. A madness that is often absent on their albums. It begins, after the introduction by Henry Rollins, high on pretension. What is this noise?  There has to be something wrong with these gentleman. The feedback screeches. The expected bass groove is somewhat obscured by the wall of noise that protrudes from the assorted amplifiers and speakers. They don't care about perfection: the keys pushed in full, black and white. You get the feeling that something is about to happen; the rising and ascension even further into complete anarchy. Then at 1:45 it explodes. This is vicious, terrible noise. Beautiful. Cedric, oh Cedric! A total disregard of brevity (and dynamics!)       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8YLDb2hi...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghZulDIbs...    Sorry it has to be divided.      So...?

20090304150810AAaqTvX	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	X-men, Fanfiction, and Christianity...?	I know that this question seems a little out there, but how do you guys feel about the backgrounds of some of the X-men characters? More specifically, I want to know what you guys think about Storm's character. I grew up watching X-men:TAS on TV every Saturday morning, and I have fond family memories of it. We used to pretend to be the X-men and go on missions. As I have gotten older, X-men is still a favorite of mine. But as I have recently gotten into fanficition (RoLo for those who are curious, yes I want them together!), I began to learn more about Storm and her past. I didn't know that she was worshipped as a "goddess" for a time in Africa. And, I didn't know that her extended and ancestral family members practiced magic and witchcraft. Or that she herself is still into her form of spirituality and "goddess" worship that she practiced in Africa.      Now, I know that I may be overreacting because she is a fictitious character, but her background bothers me a bit. As a Christian, it was a little unsettling for me to find this out about her. I believe in only one God, and that His son Jesus came to Earth to die so that we could be forgiven of our sins. I do not believe in the existence of a "goddess" or multiple "gods", ancestor worship, magic, or anything like that. There is only one God, and his son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. I loved her character when I was naive to all of this, but now I don't know. Maybe I'm just going too deep into this and should not focus on her fictitious background. Maybe I should just enjoy the story, take it at face value, and leave religion out of it. I don't know. Can you guys give me some advice on this? Especially other Christians who are fans of the X-men series. Not that Christian opinions are better or anything, but you can probably relate more to what I am struggling with. Thanks for all of your help in advance guys!

20090304152342AA3Hk7K	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Is baroque style anything like Elizabethan style?	Hi, in my english class, we just finished reading Romeo and Juliet, and as a project we got the options of reenacting a scene from the book, making a portrait of Shakespeare, or build a replica of the theater in which Shakespeare performed a lot (cant remember the name). well any way, the only project that caught my attention was to perform an example of Elizabethan style. so immediately Pachelbel's Canon popped into my head. i'd love to learn this and play it in front of my class, but it has to be Elizabethan style music, and all the places i've checked, Pachelbel's Canon is listed as Baroque, i'm to lazy to figure it out for my self, so i'd figure if come here. so basicly, would Pachelbel's Canon count as a peice of Elizabethan style music? if not, what would?

20090304152956AAitmjU	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Can Limewire give you a virus?	My friends tell me that you can only get a virus from Limewire if you download inappropriate stuff.   I used to have it on my computer, but then I got a virus but I only downloaded songs, but  don't know if that was because my brother was playing on game websites. I don't know if you can get viruses because you are downloading music. But anyway, I have recently been using iTunes because after my computer got a virus, to get limewire back, you have to download it, so I just never bothered. But after buying so many songs from iTunes, the price really starts to add up. But with iTunes, I know I wont get a virus. That's the whole problem.      So now I am wondering if Limewire really does give you viruses. Do you know? Please include any links if you can, if not, that's perfectly fine too.      Thanks

What I mean is to choose a line or a verse from a song that you think has amazing/meaningful/thoughtful/truthful words to. Like an example, I'm not saying this would be mine:      Live right now,   Yeah, just be yourself,   it doesn't matter if its good enough,   For someone else      This is from 'The Middle' by Jimmy Eat World. I believe this is a great lyric because it teaches people to be themselves and not to be influenced by what others do/think.      Get what I mean?
