20090307170453AAD94py	Dining Out;United States;Austin	My says she never feels the erge to have sex with me?	We've been together for about 3 years. About a year ago we spit up for a month. When we got back together I found out that she became friends with her ex. I found some messages that he sent her and they weren't good. He would ask her to meet up with him behind my back he would talk dirty to her. She would give in or talk back like that. I told her I didn't like her talking to him because of how he was talking to her. She told me she  stoped. I found out she lied. They were still talking. That happened a few times. Things have gotten better. About a month ago I found out she went to his house while we were spit up. They messed around they didn't have sex she said it was hard not to. The reason they didn't was because she didn't know how she felt about me. The pepblem I have now is that for the past 2 years she's been telling me she hasn't felt that erge to have sex with me. Its hard for me to understand because when we were spit up she felt that erge with someone else. We still have sex but she says its to make me happy. She says its great but that she wasn't in the mood.    I know I do things right because I make sure she gets her before I get mine   I don't know what to think?   Or what to do to turn her on because once she know that I'm trying to turn her on she stops me

A friend claimed that the fast food chains include a substance, in the already unhealthy food they offer. It opens your appetite, and prevents your from feeling satiated. I argued that I can barely finish a small burger cause it bloats me so much. Do you have any scientific facts about this?
