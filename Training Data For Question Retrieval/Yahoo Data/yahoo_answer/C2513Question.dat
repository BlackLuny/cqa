20081019112031AAnTEd8	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good STORY idea? (here's the first paragraph + a brief description)?	It's about a girl who's obsessed with death and depressed and all that jazz...And, um I was thinking maybe this dude comes along and he's like all psycho and insane and gets her to kill things for him because he's the only one who pays her attention and even though he abuses her she loves him...But the twist at the end will be that he's not even real, he's just a part of her imagination. I was thinking maybe she could wake up in a hospital bed or something...Does that sound good? Any suggestions?      Here's the first paragraph : (is it any good, I'm only 13 btw)      "The corners of my lips twitched into a smile as I rounded the corner. Why, I didn't know. But in that place, everything felt alright. For some abnormal reason, the cemetery was my happy place, and when I was inside, shielded by the thick brick walls and surrounded by the serene, yet sinister headstones I felt secure. I listened as the leaves and wind rushed around me, crinkling and painted with the colors of early autumn. The air was crisp and biting. It smelled of precipitation, I could almost taste the cleansing rain. The sky was leaden and brooding, I knew it would be pouring soon, and yet I didn't care. The rough icy feeling of the iron gate sent chills down my spine, as I forced it open. I was encircled by death and even so, it was the most alive I'd ever felt."

I glance at the clock as it laughs in my face.   Time ticks by and I still not have slipped back,   Back into the coma like state called sleep.   I can’t do anything but wait for that spiritual nirvana to come.   Sleep is not needed when I try to find my nirvana,   For that place in my mind calms me just like dreaming   Yet I’m awake      Every night I let the darkness consume me,   Yet tonight it just can’t swallow me,   For tonight I must find an alternative   In the corners of my mind comes my nirvana in the form of joyous memories,   Memories of my family and friends in the prime of our lives together   I can’t help but smile at these thoughts,   With the joy in my heart and mind I don’t notice   Notice the dark is consuming me again for another night of sleep

20081021022449AAKY2Cs	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What Do You Consider Some Of The Most Heartbreaking Moments In Literature?	I read a lot, and I have a lot of books I really adore, and many of them have keenly sad and painful moments in them, but I will simply limit myself to a few.      --When George shoots Lenny in "Of Mice and Men."      --When Winston and Julia meet after betraying one another in "1984." The casual admission of betrayal from both of them is so heartbreaking I cry when I read it, and I've probably read the book at least 20 times.      --When Quincey Morris dies at the end of "Dracula." It's even worse, to me, than when Art has to stake Lucy to set her free.      So, care to share some of yours with me? Feel free to share several, if you like. Do please include the title of the work, so I know exactly what you are referring to.      Thank you.      Oh, nearly forgot, for those who aren't familiar with the books I listed, I should include the authors: "Of Mice and Men" by John Steinbeck; "1984" by George Orwell; and "Dracula" by Bram Stoker.

Title: When All Else Fails      When all else fails, we run to our mother;   Wrong, when all else fails we run to our sisters, our brother…      That “sacred” bond is no further,   For you alone, have broken it; slaughtered.      With the everyday mistrust and lies you fill us,   This will all stop, for we cannot bare it no further.       We’ve endured so much pain this far,   Now we stand here, alone, and scarred.      We only have one another, minus you…   This pain, this hurt, all going back to your views.      This can only be withstood for so long,    We finally stand, and say you are wrong.      Maybe now, you will see what you have done,   In which you alone have brought it all on…

It's extremely cheesy, but that's just me :)        So, last Friday he went away and I'm trying to come up with something to make him that reminds him of how he makes me feel.

La realtà puo essere costruita su una Verità precedente, oppure su una Falsità precedente.   Una bugia può influenzare l'evento successivo esattamente come una verità, l'evento successivo sarà realtà e quindi vero indipendentemente dalla veridicità o meno della causa.   Se quanto affermo è vero, e potrebbe sembrare che lo sia semplicemente aprendo un giornale e leggendovi le notizie che vi sono scritte, non vi sarebbe nessuna ragione di essere sinceri e virtuosi, ma neanche d'esser Falsi e peccatori.   L'unica cosa che avrebbe senso sarebbe quella di manipolare la realtà facendo in modo che essa si adegui alle nostre esigenze.   Qual è la vostra opinione su quanto ipotizzo?      Pace e bene fratelli!

Loaded words      “Loaded words” are words that when used can automatically add a sense of approval or praise or a sense of criticism or disapproval to the object or event they are describing.  Load words often cause us to assume certain things about and event or person without really knowing anything about them.      “Massacre” is just such a loaded word.  Massacre doesn’t just mean killing a lot of people or animals, it means the wicked, evil, or immoral killing of a lot of people or animals.  We have seen the word “massacre” to describe three events in this unit; the Fetterman Massacre, the Sand Creek Massacre, and the Wounded Knee Massacre.  In each case, one side involved calls it a “massacre” while the other side calls it a “battle.”            1.  What is the difference between a “battle” and a “massacre?”         2.  For each of the three events listed, which deserves to be called a “massacre” and which deserves to be called a “battle?”  Support your opinion with facts and logic.      Fetterman Massacre:         Sand Creek Massacre:         Wounded Knee Massacre:

20090130194243AA1xyMp	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	Is It Normal…      Is it normal for your heart to beat faster when you see his face or for your mind to play every memory you had together at the mention of his name?      Is it normal he is the last person you think about before falling asleep or hoping he does the same?      Is it obvious when I see him that my eyes widen, my voice cracks or that it feels like someone set my body on fire? Does this ever happen to him? If so whom? Me?      Is it normal to see him as the most perfect person but it is still easy to notice his flaws but love them because they set him apart from everyone else?      Is it normal to want to break-up his current relationship but wont because she may make him more happy then I would myself?      Is it normal to be upset when he was in walking distance and didn’t stop by to say “Hello”?      Is it normal to think it is my fault I am not with him because I turned him down many times before because I was blind?      Is it okay to believe this is love and not lust?      Is it normal for him to feel like a brother because he is protective and caring or a friend because he is fun and understnading, and like more than a friend because he is loving and confident?      Is it normal to think I think more about him than he thinks of me? Is it normal to think I love him more than he loves me?      Is it normal for love to feel miserable especially if I don’t have him? Is it normal to think the feeling would turn euphoric instead if I had him?      Is it normal to ask for love and for it to fall into your lap a week later?      Is it normal to believe if he gets out of his current relationship he wont take me because I told him no many times before?      Does he still love me like he used to?         i wrote this when i was like 14 but i just ran across it wondering if it was good or not. Be honest and tell why its good or bad. i honestly think it sounds a little childish but u tell me

20090130195944AAokjLZ	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	How do I become an actress in the film industry?	I realize a lot of people have asked a similar question on here, but I feel like my situation is different than theirs.      I'm nineteen, and I've been acting since I was six.  I've done school plays, training in the community, high school drama classes, theatre auditions, and just recently I was accepted into a traveling murder mystery theatre troupe (paid).  And although theatre is all well and good, it's really not what I'd like to be doing.      I guess what I'm trying to say is, this isn't a hobby; this is one of those things where I know I have to do it, because every minute I'm not, I feel literally caged, as though part of my heart is being taken away from me.      My family and I, while not poor, are not exactly rich either.  I don't know if they understand how much acting means to me, and even if they do, would it really be reasonable to ask them to take me across the border to Hollywood or LA?  How much of a chance would I really have to get an agent, and would I be risking my family's money for nothing?

20090130193907AAepavg	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	What is the best camera settings for taking a picture from a helicopter?	I'm going on a helicopter tour of the grand canyon and want to know what camera settings would be best for pictures from the helicopter.       I have a Fuji Finepix S2000HD. It seems I can set the shutter speed, which I would want to be really fast, but I see the faster it goes, the dimmer the shot is, so not sure what it should be.      Then I have the ISO setting. At 10 MP I can go to 1600, but if I go down to 5 MP I can go to ISO 6400.      So I don't know what the balance between shutter speed and ISO should be for this.

20090130201420AAoVB5b	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	A poem - What do you think?	In Waiting      Sitting simply beneath heavens welcoming shroud   In a room with four corners spaced evenly round   No wall holds a door to encourage a sound   Sitting simply forgotten removed from the crowd   Between thought and action without mind to care   Emersed in sorrow without floriage or flair   Sitting simply bewildered encrusted with fear   No room for denial no threatening sneers   Sitting simply cross-legged dead center in space   Amongst dust and memories an unsettling place   Curtains pulled closed as they hang off their rung   Sitting simply above where her life was undone

You enclose me in your strong arms   You hold me close and keep me warm,   You tell me I'm the one for you ,   You tell me I'm your every wish come true,   I wake up to your tender kiss and to our days to    play on repeat once again
