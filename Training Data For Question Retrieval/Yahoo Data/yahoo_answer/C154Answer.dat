mFQydvncaa	depends when your period was, you usually ovulate about 2 weeks after your period. that could be from either. wait until you miss a period to find out for sure.<br>  <br>  The 17th was 3 days ago so it could be from ovulation or something else, depending again on your last period. you wont have signs of being pregnant until about the time you miss a period.<br>  <br>  Just drink lots of water and try not to stress yourself out. <br>  <br>  goodluck|`|xGkew2y3aa	lol sorry to say but if your on the pill and he didnt us a condom it could be his friends coming out of you ..... they can live inside a womens for 7 days before the die|`|1CryEnb3aa	Sounds like CM.  But, you didn't mention when your period was.  So, go back and count 15 days from the first day of your last period.  This should give you your ovulation day.  That is, if you are on a 28 day cycle.  I also, know that it could be signs of pregnancy too.  Good luck and baby dust.|`|lq0JNwK7aa	Anytime you have sex there is a possibility of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  But, from your description, it could just be discharge or an infection.<br>  <br>  Take a test after your first missed period (if you miss it) and if you're not pregnant and you're still having those symptoms, you should go to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Goodluck.
sbfm5rCAaa	I am 35 weeks pregnant and feel exactly like this. My baby has also almost fully engaged which is even more uncomfortable because I need to pee every hour.<br>  <br>  During the day it seems ok but at night I really struggle to even roll over in bed let alone actually get up! It is really frustrating but I know it will all be worth it in the end!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	im around 35wks and hate to say some night i end up in tears! braxton hicks seem never ending and really hurt<br>  moving seems so painful and ill admit most of the pressure i feel is in my bottom!<br>  <br>  i finally manage to get into bed then need to get up ever what seems like 5 mins to pee<br>  <br>  the end is so close yet feels so far still<br>  good luck with the rest of your pregnancy lets hope these babies dont keep us waiting to long  x x|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	OMG yes and I hate that I don't know what to do about it. It sucks. I feel the same exact way and hoping that he'll come sometime in the next two weeks lol. I'm in pain when I switch sides at night and my pelvic bone pops. I just try to stay on the left side with the support of pillows but now it's getting to the point where that's not even good enough. Well we're almost there and it'll soon be over. Just keep thinking positive (:|`|JBsilBYXaa	I have been having BH for weeks now, and do find that when I get them the urge to pee is more.  I normally just lie in bed and wait till the BH is over with then go to the loo.  I also have to put my feet over the side of the bed before sitting up, I litearlly roll off the bed and the couch when I am lying on it.  So I would suggest if you can to just stay in bed until it's over with, that will make it easier.|`|hAuemuWTaa	Oh i no how u  feel am 34 weeks and over it. i experience sore muscles around the thigh area muscles near the virgina, and heaps of pressure down there specially wen i need 2 go to the toilet.<br>   i seem to need to go at night about every two hours. and feel like i cant walk.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i am 2mths postpartum but i can remember my last trimester like it was yesterday. yes the  last 3wks i could of barely walked. i felt like i needed a walking cane...hips was stiff, groin pain, pressure..omg yes its bad. sorry u feel sore but just hold on its almost over|`|IdoZbO39aa	Yes!

h1AIzD9baa	Even the faintest positive result.. Is still a positive.. You should really go to the doctor or a clinic and find out for sure.. I tell you this because I had the same problem.. I had taken 4 home within 3 weeks and all had faint lines.. went to the clinic and they did an test and blood work.. the test was negative but the blood work was positive.. i am now 11 weeks along.. due on sept 8.. so just be sure and safe..|`|1CryEnb3aa	Yes.  go to the dr and have them draw your blood to confirm it.  Good luck|`|ACyrJQHOaa	hi, i believe that you should get a blood test done.That is the best way to find out your pregnant.Also the pink spotting could be implantation bleeding or could be a break through bleed.This is common and normal during pregnancy.If it becomes heavy and painful, i would get checked out.Good luck and congrats|`|I2WKO33Maa	It will be better if you will see an obstetrician-gynecologist so you don't have to think too much..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://FreeTryAcai.com/blog" rel="nofollow">http://FreeTryAcai.com/blog</a><br>  <a href="http://superslim99.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://superslim99.tumblr.com/</a>|`|t8HPCzrOaa	i think you shouldd retest if thats the case love a faint positive is a still positive and yes go confirm it ok hun|`|3c724f5ab73b7356d0f55d16d18e2019aa	Go get u a second opinion from a licensed medical  professional .Get a blood test.

nrqWwQBXaa	if the babysitter knew of the food allergy then yes?|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i would imagine so...doesnt matter if she knew or not either way if the kid died it's manslaughter.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	100% yes but could be charged with much more serious charges.|`|1hciyvKdaa	If the parent has alerted and reminded and reminded the person, maybe. It all depends even a parent can have a brain fart and accidently give their child something. It depends on how well the parent prepared the home in keeping no foods in the home or kept away from easy access, or at a day care, youd have to keep reminding them and each new employee, its the parent responsible for keeping up on every one knowing whats going on, one mention to me would not suffice as enough notice.

All these questions have to be answered before any legal charges can be contemplated.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	She has to have either know the child was allergic and or failed to act wehn the child had an adverse reaction.  <br>  <br>  Say your baby sitting and you have not been briefed on a childs bread allergy by the parents and there is bread in the house so you give them some.  Not your fault.<br>  <br>  If they stop breathing and the baby sitter does not call 911 that is negleact as well.  <br>  <br>  But if they did not know and it just make them a little sick they can not get in trouble.  Except maybe in california you can sue for anything and win there|`|CdTe8MO4aa	if the babysitter had direct orders from the parents not to give the kid a certain food then yes the babysitter can get into trouble<br>  <br>  and if the babysitter didn't know then no.. it was a accident..|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	depends on whether or not the babysitter knew of the allergy|`|79e4b3c6bff1c064ae45299e8ee84170aa	too many variables to tell|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Well you should've told her anyway.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	with any babysitter, with a child of ANY age, the sitter needs to be informed of the childs allergies to food, fibers, meds, etc. <br>  <br>  if she was not fully informed, you cant expect the child to tell her that he is allergic to it. for heavens sake, what if she offered the child chocolate not knowing he was allergic? most likely, the child will still take that chocolate. so legally, unless she was informed, she cannot be held liable and it then falls on the parents.|`|XPO11i9Yaa	i completely agree with dazed and confused.. as a parent you should do everything in your power to find the RIGHT babysitter but these days it's so hard to tell who would be good for the job and who's going to neglect your child/children. i would say if she knew about the food allergy she should be charged with far more then child neglect... if she didn't i would say that's both the parents fault for not informing the babysitter AND the babysitters fault for possibly not asking|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	depends on a lot, baby sitter's age, age of the child, knowledge of alergies, intent..... ect.

The babysitter would only be  at fault if they knowingly gave the child food it was allergic to. That would not be neglect, but murder.

PymLdXM8aa	Oh i hear ya! My 8 months old is getting to be the same way minus the sleep issue. Otherwise sounds identical to my daughter. I even feel bad leaving her to go the grocery store because she just cries and it makes my husband feel horrible.  She has never liked to me "confined" so no swing, no boppyseat, no exercausee...lol. SO until she was able to sit unassisted at 5 months it was crazy! <br>  <br>  I think that it has to do with the separationn anxiety". It seems to kick in at about 8 or 9 months and from what i've seen with all my other friends kids ( especially girls) it lasts til their at least a year... so were pretty much screwed...lol. <br>  <br>  But hey I am just enjoying it now because all my friends and family with 2 and 3 year old.... blahhhh. Am so not ready for that age yet. haha <br>  <br>  GL and if ya figure anything out lt us know!|`|Dk5OY5cZaa	My son was the same exact way and i noticed that he was really clinging with me!! He felt like if went to sleep he would miss out on his mommy and me time.

Good Luck i know how it feels|`|RdprMxoUaa	You might have to try (some will think me the worst mum for saying this) sleeping with her for a bit so she stops thinking that sleep equals no mummy. My son is nearly 11 months and has not wanted to be alone sometimes although I will admit he is not as dramatic as your daughter seems to be. It got to the point that I was so tired I lay him down on my chest and patted his bum til he went to sleep. I had to stay like that til he woke. You might think that this got him into a bad habit but actually once whatever the issue in his mind about not being with me was gone he was perfectly happy to go back to his own cot. It's hard when they can't tell you exactly what's wrong, isn't it.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	Separation anxiety starts usually around six to eight months of age and peaks between 12 to 18 months.<br>  <br>  "If you think about separation anxiety in evolutionary terms, it makes sense: A defenseless baby would naturally get upset at being separated from the person who protects and cares for him."<br>  <br>  <br>  "Your baby's fear of being separated from you at night is very real for him, so you'll want to do your best to keep the hours preceding bedtime as nurturing and peaceful (and fun) as possible."<br>  <br>  <br>  My daughter is ten months now and I am noticing some more of these types of things. She is the lightest sleeper in the world, but I have found she will lay on the sofa with me for the 20 minutes it takes for her to fall asleep. When she falls asleep I slip up and get some things done.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	My first son did that, but he wasn't as bad about sleeping. That was when I discovered Baby Einstein. Someone gave me one of the videos when he was born and I'd never bothered to even unwrap it. In a fit of desperation, I secured him in his bouncy seat and turned it on. He shut up instantly! In those 30 minutes, I loaded the dishwasher, swept the floor in the kitchen and got dinner started. After that, I got more DVDs, CDs and toys. I was amazed by how much my kids love those things! That Lullaby CD saved my sanity for many a cranky night.|`|AA10776535	Oh mom you need a break...My one year old  great nephew ( is that how you say that?) is doing this to my niece.

I would let her cry or let her think it wasn't sleepy time and hopefully she will go down herself, maybe she is cutting teeth.  If she knows mama will come if she keeps crying this will continue.
4CtHdiuBaa	I would take your six month old baby to the doctor then they can decide what medication they can give you or weather or not you need to take her to the local hospital|`|Dk5OY5cZaa	Call the doc tomarrow!!! She may have a little bit of cold but nothing serious
g9mh9doSaa	As long as the water is clear, u can wait for the contractions to get started (within 24 hours and no fever) but best if you call and inform your gyne or hospital as well. Do not take hot bath and make sure to keep your area clean to avoid infection. It becomes emergency if you notice the discharge mixed with blood or greenish color. Otherwise, you can stay at home, try to relax and wait until contraction gets stronger before heading to hospital. Don't forget to eat something to keep ur energy level up, such as dried fruits. Good luck!|`|3gToWPZdaa	You're supposed to go in when it's broken or when you think it's broken, because they'll want to monitor you. And if contractions don't start on their own within a certain amount of time after the water breaks, they have to start them for you. Good luck!|`|mFQydvncaa	if you woke up wet then your probably going to see labor soon, call your doctor but i suggest going in.

All the best.|`|F3ArhTiRaa	it's bad to wait and see you ave to go to the hospital or else the baby will be in risk|`|VHHis05Naa	You are supposed to call and go in when they say to.  You have to deliver after a certain amount of time since there are risks for infection.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Go to the hospital if you aren't sure your water broke. They need to test to make sure that you did or didn't. Go to the hospital. You can call them also.|`|vTfEYeKQaa	Even if it's not your water actually breaking, any leakage of fluid needs to be monitored. If it's your water, the baby can be in danger of infection if you don't do something about it soon. I wouldn't wait any longer than you have to...go to the ER as soon as you can.|`|qaMrAspCaa	No, you have 24 hours to go to the hospital after your water breaks. I don't even plan on getting to the hospital until i'm way into my labor, but I have doulas to help me know the signs and symptoms...but you don't have to rush, just relax and get yourself together. Don't freak out.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	well you should call up the hospital and see how long they want you to wait. for me my water broke around 6:22pm and my doctors told me since it was a trickle and not a gush i should take a shower eat a nice meal pack my bags and come in around 10:00pm. plus i didnt deliver till the next day around 5pm|`|jYPeis3Saa	when i was pregnant with my son, the birthing class instructor told us that when your water breaks, so long as the fluid is clear you can wait to go to the hospital.<br>  <br>  however, i think that you should go as soon as your water breaks, or as soon as you even htink your water has broken. they will want to monitor you and typically they want the baby out as quick as possible after the water has ruptured. usually within 24hrs. <br>  <br>  when my water broke i hemorrhaged so i was immediately on the phone with the 911 operator waiting for the ambulance to get to my house since i ihad no clue what was happening. (my husband works nights, and he was at work at the time.)
pm6h7YNPaa	It's difficult because the term Black is too broad. I mean an African name is different from an African American name.<br>  <br>  I personally think African names are very beautiful but lets face it pop culture has dubbed "black" names as Latisha, Lashonda etc which I don't consider very beautiful.<br>  <br>  It's not really the same, in theory it is but people's responses are very different.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	I think it IS the same thing.  A lot of parents want to pick a name that relfects their child's heritage.  But heritage can mean different things; it can mean a nationality, an ethnicity, a culture, or a family heritage.  And everyone has their own idea of what represents their background.  What sounds like a black name to one person might not sound black to another.  It's all in the interpretation.  A lot of American parents choose "Irish" names that aren't even used in Ireland... and someone in Dublin would be like, ummm, whatever?  But if they feel it represents their heritage, who's to say it's wrong?|`|bae3b34f8cfcdb7878e0d8bfe7de1948aa	Ahhh...*rubs temples* Black is a broad term and therefore not the same as Irish. If someone said they wanted an African-American name then yes they're the same.<br>  <br>  Though I understand the context of a "black" name the name's listed were in my opinion a name that anyone who wanted to name their child would give. I have met Caucasian Tyrone's and Caucasian Damion's etc...<br>  <br>  "made up" names like Shaniqua to me are just that, made up and you won't find them in a baby name book to give you an origin. <br>  <br>  So I understand your question and maybe the poster could have reworded her question to avoid attacks from angry posters, but otherwise, I don't see anything wrong with she just wants a name to identify her child as a certain race. Or she may like the names from that race. etc.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	I can understand that.  I would not want to name my kid tyrone because my wife and I are white and would not blame a black person for not wanting to name their kid conner because they are not Irish.<br>  <br>  If someone wanted to name their child a name from another racial or national background I would not complain or think any different I just think that if I give my kid an Irish name when he shows up to a job interview they won't be shocked that he is Irish.|`|9y4mUvaFaa	i think it depends on the way you ask lol like i wouldnt say hey tell me all the black names you know. id say hey can u tell me all the names mostly associated with african americans. u know i think the racism is perceived in the way you ask.|`|zuIBmNTOaa	I think that it's the same idea.  Every race/culture has names that are unique and I think that when a person gives their child a name that reflects meaning it is a wonderful thing.|`|r8Ulgpvaaa	haha i agree that a name is a name....(i actually know a white girl named keisha) lmao!|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I agree with you. To each their own.|`|kzbEWqgLaa	i see a name as a name... No name has no specific color..... a black baby's name maybe Mary Jo... Or a white baby's name may be Keisha... It don't matter....|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Not really, because Irish is a particular culture, while "black" is just a skin color. People with dark skin come from many different cultural backgrounds and will have different sorts of names.<br>  <br>  I also think people often get confused, because I've heard people say that names I've suggested are "black names" and they're actually just names from the Bible and in fact are Jewish names. Roman and Greek names have also been declared to be mysteriously "black-sounding" for some reason. I notice that people are saying Tyrone is a black name, when it's actually Irish in origin. <br>  <br>  I don't think you can say a name is "black" - you can say, "That name has a West African origin" or "This is a common name amongst 21st African-Americans". <br>  <br>  Actually this question made me laugh, because I know a woman from Jamaica, and her name is an Irish one - Sheila!
n3PE2lvDaa	I suffered from insonmia really bad in the first few months. I found that I got so frustrated because I couldnt sleep and I would be stressing about it so much that it made it even harder to get to sleep. What worked for me in the end was some advice from my mother in law. She told me to go to bed without the intention of falling asleep right away. Instead just go to bed with the plan to get some rest. So I started trying it and would lie there with my eyes shut and think to myself that I didnt have to sleep but I was at least going to enjoy the peace and quite and let my mind and body rest. I was soon sleeping properly again because without the stress to fall asleep I would fall asleep easily. <br>  You could also try a hot bath right before bed with some lavender oil in it.

At some point, not sure when exactly, naps were no longer a good thing.  If she napped at all during the day she would be up until 2am.  Now, we are on a sleep schedule of 2am-10 or 11am.  And on the nights she actually gets to bed early, I am still on the late night schedule.  I am slowly trying to get up a little earlier each day, so we will be tired at the end of the day and ready for bed.  I've also tried sleep aids.  Walgreen's carries a huge selection, Benadryl and Nyquil work just as good though.

It is a huge worry and concern.  I understand where you're coming from.   You want to be able to have a nice, steady home life and a nice place to live.  You probably also want to have the extras and be able to take the kids on vacation or let them play sports.  That all costs money.<br>  <br>  I think about it too and it's definitely the reason why so many people are waiting to get married and have kids now.

ebQJsYTxaa	I didn't get any ultrasounds with my first baby.  I got one with my second baby.  I completely avoided the Doppler with my first baby.  My second baby got exposed to a total of probably 10 seconds of Doppler.<br>  <br>  I don't think multiple ultrasounds are safe.  The one I had with my second baby, I asked the technician to do it as quickly as possible, to keep the ultrasound exposure down to a minimum.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	ive had a lot---partly bc i was so spastic and thought everything hurt my baby and in the end bc i wasnt measuring correctly but turns out my baby wasnt too small at all.|`|bc9inzicaa	I had the regular two--one at my first appointment to confirm the pregnancy and obtain the gestational age.

I was on state insurance and they paid for all of them, but just because I was having complications.  I had gestational hypertension and that often affects the baby's size, so they had to make sure he was growing right.  The very last one I had was because I developed preeclampsia and they wanted to check the baby's size before they induced me to make sure he was big enough and they didn't need to try to wait another week or so.<br>  <br>  I guess all together I had 8(?) ultrasounds.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i had 7 because i had bleeding they said it was a threatened miscarrage (5 ultra sounds were to check baby for this)  then i had one at 20wks for a complete scan to check baby for growth and sex.  then at 40 wks 1 day i had one because my baby kept having heart decelarations and had slowed his movement down a ton.  but he was fine turned out when he was finally born he had the cord wrapped around his neck once and during any contractions (real or fake) it would push his head against his chest squeezing the cord.  and most insurance will pay for all ultrasounds done for medicaly neccecary purposes but if if is one done voluntarily they dont cover that.
TsjqzanQaa	Few people really realize how mutilating BOTH circumcision of male and female are.<br>  <br>  First of all, for those misinformed individuals, male circumcision is much more mutilating, as it removes half of the penile skin.     This would constitute 15 square inches of skin in the adult male, the size of a 3 x 5 inch index card.<br>  <br>  Female circumcision is removal of the clitoral hood, and some portions of the labia, NOT ALWAYS damaging or removing the clitoris.     The clitoral hood is analogous with the male foreskin; it is the female foreskin.<br>  <br>  Genital mutilation is genital mutilation, regardless the sex on which it's perpetrated.<br>  <br>  Both are mutilation, both damage sexual sensitivity and both are atrocities when perpetrated on minors.<br>  <br>  As an infant, I was strapped down, assaulted, sexually molested and mutilated by the process called circumcision.<br>  <br>  I had more loss of sensitivity than the usual (50-75%in most cases) sexual sensitivity, and this ruined my sex life.<br>  <br>  Most males who were victims of this as children don't realize the loss of sexual sensitivity and ability, as they don't have anything to compare it to.     Most victims of male circumcision had no choice in the matter; it was forced on them as infants.<br>  <br>  Very, very few males ever choose to be circumcised.<br>  The few that do are frequently talked into it by doctors, and see other males who were circumcised, and somehow think that it's better, as the propaganda put out by doctors, who make money from it and are very frequently members of the religions that try to perpetrate circumcision on all males, are biased and do not ever disclose, and in fact suppress, the adverse effects of circumcision.<br>  <br>  Sexual sensitivity is NEVER discussed.      The psychological effects of males being mutilated is totally ignored.     <br>  <br>  And the deliberate lies!!!      HIV is much more prevalent among circumcised males.     That's one statistic that they can't cover up.      The HIV rate in the USA is much higher than any of the countries that don't habitually mutilate male infants.<br>  <br>  The foreskin contains Langerhans cells, which have antiviral and antibacterial properties.    <br>  <br>  All of the old wive's tales and deliberate lies about the so-called benefits of circumcision have been disproven, yet uninformed individuals still persist in thinking that there's some nonexistent benefit in chopping off parts of male infants.<br>  <br>  Circumcision of female minors is illegal in all civilized countries, including the US.       It's open season on male infants' penises.<br>  <br>  This is sexist in the extreme, and unconstitutional as such.<br>  <br>  If one is illegal and wrong, then both are.     Genital mutilation is genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  I have restored my foreskin, and it has vastly improved my sexual sensitivity and function.      It will never be completely restored, but it's better.     It doesn't make up for the years that I suffered from the complications of this atrocity.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|ANHsv4ENaa	We are sadly lazy and brainwashed in regards to this. People don't bother to do real research, they just go with what they were told by doctors who promote it or figure it's more important to follow tradition. The reason that just kills me is, "His has to look like everyone else's or he'll be teased/traumatized." What bull****! In every other way we want our kids to be individuals and make their own choices and not give in to peer pressure but we mutilate them so they will have the privilege of being like everyone else. A person who can do that to a little baby should be in counseling, not running a medical practice. If it's wrong for one sex it is wrong for both, hopefully some day we realize that in our culture and stop causing unnecessary pain and trauma to innocents in our care.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	The women suffer pain, every time they urinate, have sex & excrutiating pain during childbirth if they've been circumcised so your comparing it to male circumsion is just simply not funny!!!<br>  <br>  Not only that, but what they remove during female circumsion is the male equivalent of removing a man's penis altogether, not just the foreskin, but the whole thing.  For women an orgasm generally comes via the clitoris, if your clitoris is removed then that means no sexual enjoyment anymore.  Can you imagine having your penis removed?  Female circumcision is so appalling & barbaric I shake when I think about it & have never been able to bring myself to watch a documentary or read anything too detailed about it.  It is the only thing, apart from animal cruelty, that when I hear about it it actually makes me feel physically sick.  Not to mention psychologically disturbed in the extreme to think that people do that to one another.  And even worse, in tribes it's often the women performing it, even though they know how much you suffer with it.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think both male and female infants and children should have rights over their own body and not be circumcised. Although the most severe types of FGM are anatomically more severe than MGM, many types of FGM practised are equivalent to MGM (removal of the clitoral hood), yet all forms of FGM are illegal in Western countries. It's a horrible double starndard. People in the USA are culturally blind on this issue.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|K4zsztkRaa	I agree they BOTH are mutilation. f you think one is, and the other isn't them you are sexist and ignorant in my opinion.<br>  <br>  People need to wake up and realise they are mutilating their children and even tho they don't want to admit it it's true.<br>  <br>  You can close your eyes and wish all you want, but it doesn't make it true.<br>  Parents just don't want to admit what they are doing to thier kids is a form of abuse.

Hubby and I decided the it was not something we were willing to do to our sons. Men have just as much role in choosing to have their son's circumcised.<br>    You can't imagine how many times family (male's) say our son's will think that there is something wrong with their penis's because they don't look like dads and they will have mental problems because of it.<br>    Our oldest knows that his penis looks different than dad's because when dad was born the doctors thought it was best to remove the foreskin and now we know that it's ok to leave it alone and he is a happy healthy 11 year old.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I agree with you 100% and am SO thankful I only have a daughter so far, since had she been a boy she would have been cut.  :(<br>  I cannot watch the videos; just reading the steps of the procedure makes me cry and almost vomit.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I would never put my child through that.

There is more than one kind, one of which only removes the clitoral hood, which is the exact same thing as male circumcision, except far less traumatic (but no less wrong). This is because the amount or tissue removed is far less extensive, there are not as many nerve ending in the female foreskin as compared to the male, there are less functions for the female foreskin, and the clitoris is still protected by the inner and outer labia.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Wow, this certainly hit a sour note. <br>  I completely agree with you. :) I don't see how it's COMPLETELY different. <br>  <br>  By the way, to the people about the hygienic aspect of circumcision, when left uncircumcised, the penis is a self-cleaning organ. With normal bathing, it's fine. Also, if my son feels like his penis is "gross" later on in his life, I will give him the money to be circumcised. My husband is angry that his parents circumcised him. I'm so sick of people bashing parents who don't circumcise when they don't even know what they're talking about.<br>  <br>  Stacy: I agree with you completely :)<br>  <br>  "God wants it that way."<br>  ...Why wouldn't God have just made the penis look like a uncircumcised one if this is the way he wanted it? That makes no sense.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the thumbs down!|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Female FGM may be more sever, but in being so, does not make  MGM OK! or less sever than it is.<br>  <br>  I read items like cancer only in natural males. False! It is more noted in circumcised, and the instances generally happen in the scarred area. It turns out too that women are more the carriers of HPV  and not the foreskin of a natural male.<br>  <br>  While FGM is outlawed in the western world, Male circumcision is equal to removal of the Labia only, with the same nerve equivalent, then leaving the clitoris bare to rub and callous on the environment like clothing.  Before removal, the labia would be crushed in a couple spots with surgical clamps which stay clamped fully tight for several minutes. Oh, I forgot to mention that the knob of the penis for a baby is bonded to the inner wall of the foreskin, so a surgical clamp is shoved down in and rotated around the knob to tear the bonding of the two apart. It would be like the sensation of slowly tearing your thumb nail away form the nail bed, except the clitoris feeling being the nail bed instead of the thumb.<br>  <br>  No they do not use anesthetic on baby boys because an infants system would react in an unpredictable manner.<br>  <br>  Baby boys go through a living hell!  ...I know,... it's just a boy! ..so  "Oh well"! <br>  <br>  There are no health benefits to male circumcision and it's all based around myths, tradition from the Victorian times and those who think that a circumcised penis would make better wall art than a natural penis. Over 80 % of the world would dispute the wall art item.<br>  <br>  It's about functional and providing the best possible feelings and pleasure, not pleasing some ones idea of a cosmetic appearance through removal of critical feeling full parts which guard the sensitivity of other parts.<br>  <br>  Circumcision should be banned, and I wish that I had become a lawyer because I can foresee future law suits where young men will be suing peoples butts off for sexual abuse as mutilating their parts as a child or infant when they were incapable of defending themselves or having a choice.<br>  <br>  You don't treat an infection by removing parts, or we would have all kinds of body parts missing like fingers. You treat the infection and keep the body parts. A foreskin by no means equates to infection...quacko doctor!<br>  <br>  Maybe I could still become a lawyer.|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	There are extreme form of both male and female genital mutilations but the milder forms of female genital mutilation are very similar to what is done to many male babies.<br>  These websites directly compare the two practices and the attitudes of the societies that practise them.<br>  <a href="http://www.fgmnetwork.org/intro/mgmfgm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fgmnetwork.org/intro/mgmfgm.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/FGMvsMGM.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/FGMvsMGM.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP.html</a><br>  The foreskin is sexual tissue, closely analogous to the labia. Circumcision removes over half the skin of the penis (about 15 square inches or 40 square centimetres, in an adult) and it's not just simple skin. It's packed with nerve endings, special anatomical features like the ridged band and has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive. A recent study has shown real differences in fine touch sensitivity between circumcised and intact penises and that the most sensitive parts of the intact penis are those that would be removed by circumcision.<br>  It is widely recognised that female circumcision is mutilation but there has been 100 years of propaganda that male circumcision is a good thing to do in our society. <br>  I myself am circumcised. I have hated it ever since as a 12 year old I saw a mate masturbating with a foreskin and realised a little of what I had lost.Many men resent being circumcised, some so much that they stretch to try and regain some of their lost foreskin's function. They can never recover all the complex anatomy and lost nerve endings though. Infant circumcision is a violation of a man's right to intact genitals and I will never forgive my parents and the medical profession for doing it to me.<br>  Both male and female genital cutting are abhorrent to me.<br>  Geoff|`|lKsIKKm2aa	You are right. <br>  And screw whoever says uncirc penises look gross. Your little freaking helmet tip looks gross to me, and too bad for you, you don't get the pleasure out of masterbating like a uncut man does. That is why they even started cutting boys back in the day: PUNISHMENT. You know how many nerves are in all the skin 'God meant for us to not have' or whatwver.What??! Dumbest thing I've ever heard. He made boys that way for a reason is what i think! Uuugh this subject pisses me off. <br>  In 20 years when circ is rare, the ones circ are the ones that will be getting 'made fun of in the showers' <br>  <br>  Female circumcision is just plain stupid...and doesn't even exist in the US does it?|`|tMtBe1lKaa	I never thought of male circumcision in that light, but you are right. Our culture tells us what to think most of the time, and definitely in regard to this matter. <br>  I can say though, there is a difference between the two procedures. In many of the places that practice female genital mutilation, it's not a one time procedure, executed with pain medications. There is a procedure that they shut the opening closed until marriage, open it a bit, so that sex is possible, open it furthur when the baby is to be born, reclose it after, so that sex is pleasurable again. The women are no longer babies, but still held down and attacked. <br>  I don't have a son, and don't plan to have any more children- 2 girls is enough for me, but will pass this info on to friends who are having sons.|`|ksuXZ5gRaa	During female circumcision parts of the labia and clitoris are cut off and stitched back together. Some cultures do it to make sure that their females don't have sex before they're married because if the barrier made during circumcision is broken they will bleed and then when they do get married their husband will be able to tell that they had sex because they won't be the one to break the barrier.<br>  <br>  A lot of people think it's barbaric because cultures don't do it when the girls are babies they do it when they're between the ages of 10 and 15. And it harms then physically and mentally.
bae3b34f8cfcdb7878e0d8bfe7de1948aa	I know how you feel. It was worse when I was 13 and has even'd out as I grew up but the thought is always there. But I tell myself I want my baby to be able to have all the nice clothes I can give her, and all the nice stuff. And I cannot do that on a minimum wage job. Do you have a job? You can't support your baby off the government and your parents IF they help you. Stick with taking care of your niece and other family members or even get a job baby sitting. I am in school for Early Childhood Development (Go Figure) and I enjoy learning all the cool stuff about pregnancy, etc.<br>  <br>  I figured out myself what was causing the urge for me to want a baby. I wasn't getting much attention and my father was very horrible to me growing up so I kind of ignored him most of my life and I still don't "love" him. So I think I just neeeded something to replace that love. it manifested itself in the need for constant attention from men and the want for a child. The sad thing is no one I know shares my want for kids. Everyone's like "Ugh, kids? I hate them." "Or they're too much to handle and I don't want any." And that's depressing because who will my baby have to play with if no one I know wants to have kids?

First get a 15 pound rock put in your backpack and carry it with you everywhere you go. DO NOT TAKE IT OFF FOR ANY REASON !! Second, When you go to bed set you alarm clock to go off every hour on the hour. When the alarm goes off put the backpack with the rock and walk around the house for one half hour. Go back to bed wake up when the alarm goes off and repeat the same thing. When you get up in the morning take you rock and backpack for a walk around the block. If you can do this for 9 months without fail you may be ready for some serious talking by someone who is 15 and already had a baby and lets you know what it's all about.<br>  Please, GET A PONY after all once you have shoveled all it's crap, kept it cleaned, watered and feed. There will come a time when you will get tired of the Pony and will sell it......try doing that with a baby.|`|ECegmuCRaa	Just not a good idea....... 1 your not even old enough to work, 2 you need to consider the welfare of the child, become something successful and then pop a baby out every 9 months if you want, 3 raising a kid takes teamwork, unless you want your kids turnin out like ol' uncle steve ( me lol ), so the bab definetly needs a father figure, 4. try having a 40 + hour job AND taking care of your little niece ( you'll be gray within a year ) 5. your 15 i dont want to see another case of a failure at life ( no offense ). im trying to help you, believe me, adolescent pregnancies have increased risks of medical problems for you and your baby ( including SIDS sudden infant death syndrome) and i cry when i hear about a baby dying on the news, yes a full grown man, cries, i admit it, but i couldnt even imagine the despair of the mother who's child dies... at only a few hours old. please save yourself trouble,tears, and most importantly save your future....<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|uiQGzWLFaa	Some people are meant to be something, you must be meant to be a mother!<br>  <br>  It is very normal to love babies enough to want one as your own, I'm not the only one, most of my friends love the idea of a baby but aren't ready yet for their own. They all babysit and spend time with friends who have younger siblings. I'm really in love with babies too, and I also am not interested in a boyfriend right now, i just want to be me. <br>  <br>  I spend almost all of my summer at a local day care, she loves me helping and the kids love to see me too, babysitting is another option. <br>  <br>  The problem isn't if you can handle the amount of work given to you, it's if you're emotionally ready to actually have a baby, some people are very ready until actually pregnant, then they get second thoughts. <br>  <br>  The solution is to wait until you have finished school/traveling/college/ext., get everything done that you want to; it would be extremely difficult to raise a baby while trying to finish high school if that's what you're doing.  You could then look into adoption or a sperm donation if you still aren't interested in a relationship after finishing the part of your life that would be hard with a baby.<br>  <br>  Keep looking to the future, and spend as much time with young ones as you can to ease that want for your own, I went through a stage at 13 when I just needed to be around children, it eased up a lot after I had spent 5 days a week at the daycare for 2 months, the last month of summer I could really enjoy being their because I wasn't dreading going home.<br>  <br>  Relax, if you want a baby that much then it's certain that you'll have one or adopt one someday, now might just not be the best time.|`|vQtRmZETaa	please wait.

Just enjoy the teen years while you have them and before they are gone|`|dQZzbSXhaa	Trust me, you don't want a baby. My aunt got pregnant when she was 14, and look where that got her. She ended up as an single mom with no money. It's a big risk, if you want to raise the baby by your own.<br>  <br>  But if you're willing to take that risk, just for the start, you can try to adopt one. If you like it, and feel that you can handle it, you can go to the sperm bank and you know the rest. But you can't have a baby without a male.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: That's what Uncle above me said. Do not get pregnant before you finish school.|`|nhhCow4haa	i found it so funny when you said its not hard to look fter a baby, i actually laughed! looking after a 7 month old is a lot easier than a newborn. you know its wrong to have a baby at your age. and you have no idea how it will change your life. i was 18 when i gave birth and all my friends thought it was 'cool' that i was having a baby. however when my son arrived only one visited me in hospital and she is the only one who is still my friend. you cant just leave your baby with someone if you decide one day you want to go to a party or something similar. maybe choosea career path to do with babies, early childhood teacher or something
Qz7YtDXUaa	maybe but then again if you think about it genes are weird yes there are extremely dominant genes BUT you may each carry recessive genes and you have like 1 in 4 chance that your children would have that hair color and/or eye color but it is possible because of your genes you may carry the recessive gene and so could your partner thus making your children look like they were adopted....<br>  <br>  Genes are messed up sometime :S but if I saw your family I would understand|`|uh5DlJzqaa	Ummm no trust me I'm 15 and i'm tan  with brown eyes and my little brother and little sister are as pale as can be with clear blue eyes and another little brother with blonde hair very tan with hazel eyes [they are all under 4 years old]<br>  <br>  so no i personally wouldnt|`|93JgYS4Vaa	My best friend is half black half white and her son is fire-engine red! <br>  <br>  If these people had paid any attention in high school biology they'd remember that the red-hair gene is recessive. You and your husband were carriers and when you combined your DNA, your sons had a 50/50 chance of getting the gene! And it doesn't matter what people think of you so don't worry so much. If you are  a good wife and mother and you take care of yourself it doesn't matter what people think.|`|BpUo2WGkaa	No I wouldnt question it, I'd like to think people know better.    Certain physical appearance traits can jump a generation. My daughet has different coloured hair and eyes to me and her dad, however three of her four grandparents had that coloured hair.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt try to stress over it, at the end of the day atleast you and your husband know the truth and no one else matters.|`|Dk5OY5cZaa	Forget them!!!!

NhPSz1kHaa	Go to bed. Sleep a lot and when you are awake drink lots of water or juice.  Take vitamin C, garlic, and IF you are not allergic you might want to try Echinacea.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I heard that zycam works. My daughter was in the hospital and I had a cold. This nurse came in and told me to get those zycam nasal swabs. She said that she had a cold and she used that along with the zycam nasal spray and her cold was gone in 3 days. I usually get me a box of tissues and load up on vitamin C once I start getting symptoms. Echinecea works too. I am a firm believer of sleeping it off and drinking hot tea so that its harder to get a sore throat. But it is hard to sleep it off when you have kids. So this last time I had a cold. I drank theraflu, took nightquill before bed and took tylenol cold and flu. However its not best to take theraflu and tylenol cold and flu. So if I took tylenol then I wouldnt take theraflu. And Vice versa. Good Luck and hope you get to feeling better. Oh my cold was gone in 3 to 4 days.

47M20WOUaa	I like Joshua Taylor & Joel Wesley :)|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Audrina Michelle & Angela Renee - I thought of using Audrey and Angela for my twins. I like Audrina too - but I prefer Audrey. I like the names together, their both really feminine and independant names, and the middle names are also nice, pretty, and simple. <br>  Leah Suzanna & Clara Marie - I like Leah, but only spelled Leigha. Otherwise I see it as being very soccer mom -esque. I don't really like Clara. It's kinda boring to me, with the same repeating sound. I do like the middle names though, and the names compliment each other. <br>  Joshua Taylor & Joel Wesley - I love Joshua! I wish more people would consider this name, it's so charming. I also really like Joel, for no specific reason. The names go well together, since they both start with J, but that's the only relation I have with the names. The middle  names are okay and sound nice with the names. The names as a whole are a little gender neutral in my opinion. They're obviously boy's names, but they aren't masculine. If possible, more boyish middle names should be considered. <br>  Isaac Lee & Elijah Robert - I love Isaac and Elijah! They go together so well. They're both so soft and angelic - or that's how i'd describe them. The middle names work well also. I really like the combination of the two names - really really. <br>  Kylie Brooke & Joshua Brooks - I don't really like Kylie. I just don't think of a pretty girl when I hear and see the name - sorry. I love Joshua though. I also don't like the middle names - I don't like the individually, and I especially don't like them together like that. I think it's like having George and Georgina - not flattering. <br>  <br>  My favs are Audrina Michelle & Angela Renne, Isaac Lee & Elijah Rober.|`|2CYfjPA6aa	Leah Suzanne and Clara Marie<br>  Isaac Lee and Elijah Robert<br>  <br>  Don't like Kylie and Joshua, too common and annoying|`|vdPS8dQxaa	Audrina Michelle & Angela Renee 6/10<br>  Leah Suzanne & Clara Marie 8/10<br>  Joshua Taylor & Joel Wesley 7/10<br>  Isaac Lee & Elijah Robert 5/10<br>  Kylie Brooke & Joshua Brooks 6/10|`|9Er7tHo7aa	all of these names are beautifulll my favs are..<br>  g/g<br>  audrina marie and kylie renee<br>  <br>  b/b<br>  joshua brooks and isaac wesley<br>  <br>  b/g<br>  joshua taylor and clara marie
575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	I didn't give my little kids junk food in general; but it shouldn't be considered "abuse".  When all is said and done, seeing a mother give a baby a couple of french fries in a fast food place doesn't mean she does it all the time.  It also doesn't mean that the child will grow up fat.<br>  <br>  When my kids were little we had nothing but nutritious, healthy, foods and drinks in the house; and when we'd go out to eat I'd always get them healthy meals.  Once in a while, once they were old enough to start to enjoy the toys in Happy Meals, I'd bring them to Mcdonalds every once in a while.<br>  <br>  They'd get milk or orange juice with their Happy Meal.  The two little ones wouldn't eat more than about three French fries.  My oldest son was, by that time, about eight or nine years old.  He'd eat the French fries.  A Happy Meal every once in a great while isn't going to do anything in terms of damaging their health.  I also let them have cake and junk at birthday parties, and sweets for holidays.<br>  <br>  They were all super slender, healthy, active, children.  All three have grown up to have beautiful teeth.  All three have grown up well aware of healthy eating.<br>  <br>  When your house has nothing but nutritious, healthy, foods and snacks; your children won't get fat from having cake at a birthday party or that occasional, half-eaten, Happy Meal.  <br>  <br>  When your little kids know that "such and such a toy" is being given out with Happy Meals, it doesn't seem like such a big deal to let them get the Happy Meal and that particular toy, just to make them happy.  Making the occasional exception to the healthy-eating rule is approaching eating with common sense; and if some girl at Mcdonalds ever had the nerve to make up a whole story about how my kids - with their monthly or every-two-months Happy Meal were being "abused" or going to grow up overweight and addicted to junk food, I'd want to smack her.|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	If the parents are constantly feeding their children junk food it's not healthy no. If it's every once and a while i don't see anything wrong with it. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are healthy but classifying it as child abuse i don't think i'd go that far. There's so many things these days that people think should be classified as abuse and that's where it's  getting out of hand.  No one is going to agree 100% with the way you parent your children.|`|D5eQqTmCaa	There's a certain point that some children/parents reach where it becomes child abuse. Having kids a little overweight, or even quite a bit overweight is not child abuse. Morbidly obese children, on the other hand....<br>  I was watching Maury Povich the other day and there were children under five weighing over 100-200 pounds. The mothers would feed them pizza, macaroni and cheese, burgers, fries...you name it!|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	I wish.  One of my foster babies was raised on bottles of formula and doughnuts.  With that, and no interaction, it took me three dance of good nourishment and talking to him before he "woke up" mentally and responded.  CPS gave him back to his mom who let an ear infection go to point of bursting his eardrum not once but twice.  Fortunately he's adopted and a very happy boy now.  Who knows what bad effects his first year left him with.|`|59GymH27aa	What healthy choices for kids did your restaruant serve for kids.  Whenever we take our 1 yr old out for lunch the only things these places ever serve as kids meals are chicken nuggets and chips, pizza and chips, fish fingers and chips....there are barely any.  Plus my daughter will only eat finger foods.  So what do you suggest? That we never go out for lunch or dinner.  <br>  <br>  I don't think even for a second that you can call it child abuse.|`|hQMiSlvMaa	My Daughter first time I fed her french fries when she was 11 months.  We take her out 1 every 1.5 months and she enjoys herself.  at home back to normal cooking and veggies.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with feeding a little of junk food.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Its not child abuse<br>  <br>  There is no harm giving kids junk food every so often. You cant tell parents how to raise their kids.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	well once a child has teeth and gets to the toddler stage i believe they should have a taste of pretty much everything we eat, to point out allergies, likes and dislikes and just to keep them interested. i also do agree that healthy kids make healthy adults but i see no harm in my 17 month old munchin on french fries with us if we grab some burgers on the go.. its the american way!!<br>  <br>  but.. i was a waitress for a long time too, and i remember a couple came in with a 2 week old baby, 2 WEEKS OLD, and the mom went to use the restroom and the dad was giving the baby dr. pepper with a straw!!! just letting it run into its little mouth! i was sickened. <br>  <br>  but once a child can feed themselves bits of grown up food i think its just fine... its a treat for everyone to go out to eat, babies included.|`|BpUo2WGkaa	It's ok to have some unhealthy foods every now and again. And how do you know these mothers that went into your restaurant constantly stuffed their child with chips?     And I think you saying that those are the kids that grow up fat and addicted to junk food an incredibly wrong thing to say.<br>  Kids / children / babies should experience a variety of foods.<br>  <br>  Giving your child a chip (with or without teeth they can still do mashed potato)    is not child abuse.|`|xlzt97tIaa	It's sad to see little adorable babies ending up FAT, but if the babies enjoy it, it's technically not abuse.|`|ByoYmFsBaa	Hi - My friend and I were just having this conversation last week. Her daughter, 10, never eats anything that isn't healthy and rarely has a french fry or piece of pizza.<br>  <br>  I, on the other hand, grew up with parents that owned a fast food restaurant, so fast food was always available.<br>  <br>  Ya know what? It didn't make a difference. In fact, it wasn't a "big deal" for us kids to eat this type of food (since it was always around). I am as weight conscious as any, don't really overindulge and always maintain a good weight. Just because it's available when you're young, doesn't always mean you're programmed to eat like a piggie your whole life. :-)<br>  <br>  But I understand your point, too ~ totally. I'm sure my Mom wasn't stuffing me with french fries as a baby, either. I say moderation and a good balance of variety is usually key.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	my niece who is 10 mons gets fed formula (gasp!), pureed gerber food, and gerber graduates, but is now being fed table food. her mom my brother's wife feeds her a little bit of fries, with no ketchup, tomatoes, and little pieces of hamburger here and there. my niece enjoys it very much and it's getting her accustomed to eating at the table and in restaurants which is a good thing. as long as they don't feed their child JUST that, it's okay.<br>  and just for your info, my friend didn't have her 1st burger til she was 16 bc her parents were vegans. well now shes 33 and overweight and every diet shes tried doesn't work.<br>  i got pepsi at age 4, mcdonalds twice a week beginning around 6, and i grew up to be a very slight woman.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I understand exactly what you are saying. Age appropriate sometimes junk food is ok, not babies, not at all. Moms do not understand, the foods of today determine teh childs quality of life as adults, its about bringing up a child, into a healthy adult. It is treated as abuse, but only when teh kid is so fat the state steps in and takes custody and that is very rare.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	when the child ends up really over weight, then it should be considered child abuse. Sorry to say, but i know a 4 year old who ended up in the er many times because her lungs couldn't support the weight on her chest. Of course she didn't just eat junk, she was addicted to TV too..... that should also be considered child abuse/neglect, letting your child be babysat by the TV.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Unless the childs diet consists of nothing but unhealthy foods, there is nothing wrong with letting them enjoy some french fries and ketchup once in a while.. when people eat out they go to enjoy food, its a treat for everyone.. how can you assume thats what they feed them on a daily basis?   Sounds like your parents did great as far as raising you to eat healthy, but they failed to teach you not to judge others.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Feeding babies junk food isn't abuse. people just do that i think because its cheaper, and they like it so they will feed it to their baby. I am a very healthy mom also. I give them lots of fruit and veggies. The only time they eat kinds bad is when its lunch time I'll give them mac and cheese or grilled cheese, but i put peas or celery, sometimes carrots into those things. We always have a side of cold veggies or fruit at lunch.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	well if it is MY KID it is MY CHOICE to feed him.  you do not ALWAYS know the whole story.  maybe it was a special day,,,maybe they hadnt eaten out in a month and it was a special treat.  My question is why do people always need to question how i raise MY KIDS.  my kids have drank soda,,eaten french fries, drank koolaid and juice,,,i think my kids were about 4 months old and my sister in law gave them the icing off someone's birthday cake.  when will people worry about themselves and not worry about others so dang much.  If i choose to do something it is MY CHOICE and if it goes wrong,,,MY FAULT.  Maybe you should get the government to ban french fries, or maybe ban donuts,,,or even just ban anything that YOU think is disgusting.  If i want to eat a package of oreos,,,(with WHOLE milk to dunk them in) and let my kids join me,,,,,,who are you to tell me i am a bad parent.  NOT every kid in american is fat and unhealthy and addicted to junk food.  Mind your own business and leave my dinner and my kids dinner plate ALONE.
WWfL5tMvaa	when I was pregnant and I had a cold all what my doctor agreed for me to take was Tylenol. Though i know that there are doctors who give Tylenol cold also.<br>  hope you will get better and your TTC works|`|QWaspeg7aa	I think you're getting this slightly out of proportion- there is no need to see a doctor for a cold, even if you're ttc. In fact, there is a poster up at my doctors specifically saying that there is nothing the doctor can give people for colds. You just need to go to a pharmacy because the pharmacist will be able to suggest something that will be ok for you. You just have to wait for a cold to clear up. Please don't worry about what you're taking hurting your chances.|`|PWBXjCgSaa	the only thing you can take for colds in cough drops or REGULAR Sudafed... no special kind just original!|`|yV373JUiaa	There is no medication that treats a cold anyway you just have to ride it through. <br>  <br>  Tylenol is fine even if you are pregnant to help with the symptoms of the cold. Do not take ibuprofen!!!!!
kRui5wGtaa	You may want to call the doctor just to be sure. At the end of my pregnancy I experienced the same thing and they told me that it was just a discharge. It would happen during my sleep and throughout the day. I would even feel it "flow" a little bit. The feeling of it was that of "water". Not sticky and it was color and odorless. I freaked out because I didn't know if my water had broken or not...I just couldn't tell lol. It happened all the way till the end of my pregnancy and it started about a month and a half before I had my son.|`|sbfm5rCAaa	You do not say how far along you are but it does sound like you have a leak in your membrane. You need to see a doctor as soon as possible so that they can see how bad the leak is and if it will require emergency intervention.<br>  <br>  Also make sure you do NOT have sex now as this will cause infections etc.<br>  <br>  See a doctor and good luck!|`|hAuemuWTaa	I wont wait untill next week as this sounds not good, it could be ur water leaking. if it happens again smell it. to see if pee.|`|3c724f5ab73b7356d0f55d16d18e2019aa	Yeah seek a medical Dr.|`|bf977d45406286cec89ce77e17169069aa	with what you've posted before about your appointments with your midwife. I would seek a second opinion.  I would make an appointment to see a doctor asap, and the doc can check your amniotic fluid.

tivpa7Vlaa	listen honey! this is your labor and it is a very messy event i suggest you tell them who will be in the room with you and put your foot down on it. y would you want a child to see your vagina preform this miracle. tell your  mom and your husband to be there and everyone else can wait in the waiting room or at home and wait till you guys get home and celebrate. for me i was very specific on who i wanted in the room and how i wanted them positioned. only my hubby at my side and not! betwn my  legs and my sister taking pictures with no vagina shots and thats exactly how it went. its bad enough you gonna have different people in and out your vagina (the doctors). who cares if others get insulted do whats best for you.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	You are just going to have to tell everyone that the hospital will only allow two people to be in the room with you and that you choose your mom and hubby. If all else fails tell the doc and nurses and they will make everyone leave|`|DTUOvJm0aa	it's yourchoice, not theirs. so just straigt out tell them that you only want your mom and your husband, and especially not your cousin's kid....i doubt he wants to see that either.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	My wife just told everyone not to be there except me.  That stoped all the choosing who could come in.   She did not let me watch either and I am glad.  I stood by her head and held her hand the whole time but the gown kept me from being able to look down and see anything and I did not even try and look because she said know and if you have ever seen a woman giving birth they can be very scary.<br>  <br>  I am glad I did not look one of my friends passed out when his baby was born and the smell that filled the room when he started comming out made me want to throw up so yeah.<br>  <br>  Some people say it is beautiful I don't know how they can think that.|`|EJl2RvDfaa	Its perfectly normal. I'm on baby #2 and I will only let my husband in the room. My husbands grandmother invited herself in the room. Which isn't going to fly with me!!! If you talk to your dr before hand and make it clear who you want in the room I'm sure they will help you out! GOOD LUCK and congrats.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way don't stress about that you have a long way to go and it will just make you really anxious about having the baby.|`|a4sISUfUaa	check ur hospital regulations. if it is allowed then please do deal with it now, its ur body and ur labour and only people you want and feel comfortable having in should be in. <br>  <br>  i have told my husband strictly no looking below the waist, i think its normal to feel like that|`|4QTHSTbbaa	Just tell them you arent comfortable with anyone but your mom and husband in the room...<br>  ohh and you get to choose!! and also theres a minimum of people its not more then like 2 MAYBE if you are lucky 3... but most the time they only like one.|`|5yIph0u5aa	Most hospitals wont allow children in the room. I feel the same way I am not sure I would want my bf in there with me. I would rather have my best friend even though my bf is a pediatric doctor.|`|06iOhuHWaa	most hospitals dont allow children in. but if yours does simply ask the nurses to tell your cousin they dont. this way you cause any problems with family members on you, your husbands, and new babys big day.|`|R21aV2mLaa	u will be the one that chooses who will be in the room!! yes its weird only my mom and my husband will be in the room!!|`|SwG2PJTNaa	Do whatever makes you comfortable.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i do not hink a delivery room is appropriate for a child unless it is the one being born. how incredibly rude of your cousin to first invite herself to your delivery and second to say she wants her young child in there to watch. that child will have no idea what is happening and will probably be scared. i hope your hospital has some sort of rule against this. <br>  it is your baby, your birthing experience and your body. have who you want i nthe room. who cares about everyone else. <br>  <br>  i do think its a little weird that you don't want your husband to watch the birth of your child. what if he wants to? im actually disappointed that i ended up with a c-section and didn't get to see anyting.|`|SyVQF3FHaa	as far as i know hospitals don't let kids in the room. but as far as you not wanting your mom or hubby watching hes going to any way his baby coming and your mom might take a peak, i know its you who is labor but they love you and want to see the little person who is coming. i felt the same way when my daughter was born, but the feeling goes away. your to worried about pushing. Congrats & good luck.|`|IdoZbO39aa	Oh my god, it is YOUR pregnancy and delivery so it is your choice of who you want with you! They should most definitely understand if you make a decision that you do not want certain people in the room with you (especially a cousin - unless you are super close!)...<br>  I am due to have my first on the 7 March, i am having my partner with me and no-one else unless i call on my mum. Other than that, i am very close with my sister and would consider having her there, but NO-ONE ELSE.<br>  All the best to you, hope you work it out.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I told my doctor I strictly wanted only him to watch. When my sister in law gave birth TONS of nurses and hospital staff came in to watch....without even asking. And the nurses waiting for the baby we're sitting there watching too. I think it's rude to stare at a women's vagina without her consent, but aparently some people think giving birth is an open invitation.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think it's normal to not want people to watch.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Hospitals put a limit to who can be in the delivery room. Also YOU choose who gets to be in the room. If you don't want her son there tell her. If she brings him anyway have the nurses or your husband to ask him to leave. You can tell them ahead of time to keep an eye out for him so they know what's up. <br>  <br>  You don't have to have someone in there if you don't want them there. Usually it's only 2 people in the room while you are actually pushing and delivering the baby.
g5JeSJbNaa	highly likely take a test|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's too soon for you to be getting symptoms actually. WAY too soon. Implantation hasn't even occurred yet if you did get pregnant again. Implantation occurs 4-16 days past ovulation, usually 7. You can't get symptoms until a few days after implantation when your body starts producing the pregnancy hormone. You aren't pregnant, or at least can't know it yet.|`|qaMrAspCaa	yes, i knew a girl that went to her ob for her 6 week check up and they told her she was preggers...so it's possible.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	it seems pretty early to be having symptoms like that, but right after you give birth is the easiest time to get pregnant. . so it is very possible if you have had unprotected sex. since your periods will be out of whack for a while after having your baby, i'd say talk to your OB at your 6 week post-natal appt, they can test you right then and there!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Good lord looks like you will be another mommy, women have a greater chance of getting pregnant after they just had a baby, be careful if your not and use a condom|`|637SBLmIaa	yep!!! you can be! I got pg after my 2nd child was 8 weeks old. now there 11.5 mos apart.. make sure you take a test, and use a condom next time!!!!!|`|jYPeis3Saa	well take a test!|`|ACjPwIc1aa	Well every pregnancy is different but im most sure that u are! but well there are some pregnancy test out there that detect early pregnancy so yeah u should check up on that...but if not the best thing to do is to take a blood pregnancy test that's Always better! n if u are congrats hehehehehhehe!!!|`|FRNz89OIaa	This is why you shouldn't have sex until 6 weeks PP. You are the most fertile you've ever been after having a baby!!!! You could very well be pregnant, and most likely are! You're VERY VERY VERY fertile right now.|`|NXeLcbO0aa	most definitely, you are the most fertile you will ever be in your life 3mths after the birth of a baby.|`|BbBPxH9Maa	I highly dought if you are pregnant but to be sure go for a test.

6W4ZWOetaa	Any time you have sex without protection you can get pregnant; even if he doesn't finish inside you.  It only takes one sperm to get pregnant, and he lets loose millions of them, even in precum.  Use condoms!!!  I know they're not as great as bare, but they also protect against STDs.  <br>  <br>  But don't get yourself all worked up, that won't help.  Just keep extra careful track of your period and if it's late by two weeks, then take a pregnancy test.  If you take one earlier than that you won't get an accurate answer.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Of course you could have gotten pregnant but try to not worry too much about it. You can't test until 14 days after the incident. Most women get accurate results 14 days past ovulation or sex so you can try to test on the 28th. If it comes back negative I'd wait another week and see if your period comes. If it does you are fine. If it doesn't take another test. Good luck!|`|3c724f5ab73b7356d0f55d16d18e2019aa	Go to the Dr. and get a blood test. first u should wait 2 wks  go get a Ept and try not to worry .|`|5yIph0u5aa	You could but right after your period your chances are alot less. I would suggest taking a morning after pill but it maybe too late.|`|mFQydvncaa	as soon as you miss a period take a test|`|uIAHkm0Naa	are you on birth control? does your boyfriend smoke weed? both of those lessen your chances of being preggo|`|IdoZbO39aa	if you have a regular 28 day cycle then there is certainly a chance that you could fall pregnant. sounds like you had sex right around where ovulation would be. you will need to wait another week or probably 2 to test.|`|q6iDNUlmaa	Possiblity is too high. Why didnt you take emergency contraceptive within 72 hours if you were worried?
UfhE3k1baa	You can have something like 200 mg of caffine a day. Just check the labels and add up your totals! I personally am craving soda, pepsi which I never drank before. So I am watching my intake.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	By small bottle do you mean the 24 oz ones? My doctor (and my previous doc and midwife) told me it's ok to have the equivalent to a can (12 oz) of caffeine a day. Sprite doesn't have caffeine so that's not an issue. The others you want to consume small amounts of. You'll be ok if you moderate.|`|yV373JUiaa	You must stay under 200mg of caffeine a day. Doctors do not tell you do watch your caffeine so the baby with not crave it..that's not right at all.<br>  <br>  Caffeine can constrict the growth of your babies blood vassels which are Essential to its growth and health.|`|a4sISUfUaa	i hope its fine, i do pretty much the same thing, i haven't heard anything to say its not, just watch out to stay under 200mg caffene a day|`|Bg6txvxqaa	There is no caffeine in sprite so drink that instead of the others. Lemonade actually helps with morning sickness.|`|R21aV2mLaa	i am 34 weeks i drink a 20 oz bottle or more a day!! its just they dont want u to drink alot so the baby will want it.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	I was told you can have 2-3 cans of soda (12oz) a day and its safe. Sprite, Sierra Mist, and 7up don't have any caffeine.
2Hot9EJiaa	If you are using an early prediction pregnancy test- a positive can show up 5 days before your period is due- so yes, you could have tested a few days prematurely.  A negative test that early could have been false negative. If you get a positive, it is positive- there are no false positives. I volunteered in a clinic for over 10 years. I would suggest you re-test in a few days, or just wait and see if you get your period.  If you are on the pill you are less likely to get pregnant- but they are not fool proof either. I know women that have gotten pregnant on birth control.|`|BbBPxH9Maa	Oh if you are still on the pill then that shouldn't worry you coz the pill is protective against pregnancy.Do see a doctor for your other symptoms.|`|IdoZbO39aa	You may have tested a little early if you think you might be. I would test again in a week.|`|y2JmcaUeaa	Maybe you should study harder next time you want to pass a test!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You are on the pill. It's 99.7% accurate. You are probably not pregnant. The pill stops you from ovulating. If you don't ovulate you can't get pregnant. Nausea can be caused by HUNDREDS of other things not just pregnancy.
rVs2nfgGaa	Because she doesn't want to seem desperate and was trying to not talk to you but then decided she wanted to. She read it when you sent it and then thought about it for the entire 5 hours. It's part of being a girl with our strange mentality.|`|ghPzWipnaa	the phone could be on vibrate and she keeps it in her purse, she was sleeping, she was busy and didn't have time to text back or check, she forgot it somewhere or didn't take it, or maybe she needed time to think about responding, like what to say.  don't read too much into it, i know tons of people who don't always respond promptly to texts.  i know i always forget to check for new texts cause i can't feel the vibrate in my pocket.|`|jTi7k9kEaa	well if it wasn't a mutual breakup then she still might be bitter that you broke up with her. unless you guys both decided to stay friends and said that you will still talk to each other then sometimes it can be awkward.

If you want it from a girls point of view...whenever any of my ex's text or call me I ignore it for as long as I can, because it just ends up being a pain in my ***.|`|E7ViD8EWaa	Because not all of us are going "Ohmigod, ohmigod, do I have a text? Was that my phone telling me I have a text? Is there a new one!?!?! Ahh!"<br>  <br>  Maybe she was off, you know, having a life.|`|F47MyGDSaa	Maybe her phone wasn't by her, or it was dead, or the message was delayed because of service problems (that can happen).<br>  <br>  Or maybe she just didn't know what to say, and she kept writing something, and it wasn't right, or she didn't know what to say, and finally she did.|`|y96eYj0Faa	Well you areee her ex. <br>  <br>  Maybe she had better things to do than talk to the guy who broke her heart. Girls are weird like that. We can just sit and sit on something and never let it go.

Throughout my pregnancy I've been having awful muscle spasms, and since I can't be on perscription pain killers my doc says the next best thing is a heating pad, and back rubs from hubby...which never happens. I've been using one constantly since I was 16 weeks or so (I'm almost 34 weeks now) and no problems have ever come of it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yes both of my doctors advised against using heating pads. It can raise your body temperature which is NOT good for the baby.<br>  <br>  Better yet. Ask YOUR doctor. He or she is the one you should be asking this question. Both of my doctors were apparently wrong....|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I practically lived on heating pads during my pregnancy (Sciatica) and everything was fine.  I had my doctors approval and used one every evening for at least half an hour.  The main reason you are supposed to stay away from things like jacuzzis or very hot baths when you're preggers is because they can raise your body temp which could be dangerous for the baby, but heating pads just heat isolated small areas, so they are A-OK!|`|tivpa7Vlaa	well if its good enough to put against your skin i guess it cant be that bad. all i know is you can't be in a jacuzzi but a heat pad on your back. i cant see the harm|`|EIJm83Psaa	You can use it on your back. My doctor told me to use it. It on your belly you cant have a heating pad on.|`|h1AIzD9baa	Expert Answers<br>  Russell Turk, ob-gyn and founder of the Riverside Obstetrics & Gynecology in Riverside, CT <br>  <br>  Using a heating pad while you're pregnant is safe. When applied to a specific area of the body, a heating pad can provide relief without raising your core body temperature.<br>  <br>  If your core temperature gets elevated early on in pregnancy, it can increase the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida. This is why women are advised to avoid hot tubs and saunas while pregnant.<br>  <br>  Pain can be a sign of potentially serious complications, such as a detached placenta or a uterine rupture, so alert your doctor if your pain is not obviously from overexertion.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tekoa King, certified nurse-midwife and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health, Oakland, CA <br>  <br>  A heating pad applied to sore muscles or aching joints won't harm your baby, because moderate heat applied to one area of your body won't raise your overall blood temperature. And there's no evidence that EMFs (electromagnetic fields) pose any danger to developing babies.|`|IdoZbO39aa	I was having a lot of back pain during early pregnancy and now again in late pregnancy (38 weeks) and my obstetrician and nurse both advised the use of a heat pack.

Use it in 10 min lots so you dont overdo it, otherwise it is perfectly fine to use on your back.|`|NXeLcbO0aa	yes, i've been told this is true,just don't do it to be safe, they say it is safe to have a warm bath to relax sore muscles though!

Semen, can live a very long time after ejaculation. You are not safe during your period. There is something called preejaculation which can occur with in even the very beginnings of sex or foreplay. Without protection IE Birth control condoms  spermicides etc etc. You can end up pregnant ANYTIME you have sex. scratch that even when you use Birthcontrol you can end up pregnant. I have 4 children to prove that. <br>  <br>  What to do know. Buy a test, the easiest way to tell but, it sounds like your young so if you don't have money, go to planned Parenthood and they can do a test for you. <br>  If that test comes back positive, you need to go home, give your parents a hug tell them what is happening and apologize, they have dreams and goals and want you to lead a good life. <br>  <br>  If that test comes back negative, you need to go home talk to your parents and let them know you have been sexually active. And before you are so careless again, think about how you are going to raise a child, think about what you want from your life, and then take some responsibility and say no! <br>  <br>   A child is A ENORMOUS responsibility. I was a teenage mom and my life was soooo hard when I started out. count your blessings!|`|oyINZiNDaa	take a ****** pregnancy test....that was a bunch of **** to read an its very rare to get preg on your period because when woman have their period its the egg bleeding out because sperm didnt reach it to produce an offspring....and its very not likely to get pregnate right after your period because everyone has ovulation days which when you have a normal 28 day cycle its usually around the 13th or 14th day from the first day of your period and then if its about a 30 day cycle its about the 15 or the 16th day would be your ovulation day...so im thinkin its not likely your young so if your not on BC it don always happen that your cycles are regular mine werent til i got on it an there would be times i would skip a month...so id say take a test just to be safe....but its not likely....
AA11763588	Typically symptoms will show up between weeks 3.5 - 4.5.<br>  <br>  Just wait it out till your next period, I know it's not really the answer you are looking for, but it's the best advice I can give you.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's WAY too early to get symptoms sweetie. The symptoms you listed could be from MANY MANY things.|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	WAY too early to be getting symptoms.|`|bf977d45406286cec89ce77e17169069aa	if you ovulated on those days, then how can you be pregnant? unless you're thinking that you conceived in those days, but it's too sudden to have those symptoms.  Sometimes our body goes thru sy mptoms that we think we are pregnant.  You could have the stomach flu, andif you didn't eat, that also help bring a nausea feeling too.|`|XBTF1XvZaa	Not really and too early to see the symptoms, just give 3 to 4 weeks or even more than that and see what happen.
kPl8TTzNaa	It is a masculine, Gaelic boy's name. Nothing feminine or girly about it. Nothing unisex about it.<br>  <br>  [Edit] Poster above, what is feminine about this name? Nothing. It is pronounced (KILL ee yan). The fact that it has 'kill' in it is pretty masculine.|`|FU6Lb5vKaa	Both:-)<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace<br>  :-)|`|60baf852112ab775b85b655dca099e1aaa	Dude.

He is living in a fantasy land, and can't deal with reality.|`|sAAnquoTaa	I'm not sure what you can do. As his mom you probibly have a lot of influence over him so I'd talk to him and explain to him the pain that hating someone for their race, religion, or anything brings. <br>     I myself have no tolerence for predgudist people and will make sure my daughter knows how it makes people feel to be hated for something you can't control, and teach her that we're all people that deserves love, no matter your skin color, beliefs, or social rank. A person with no money deserves just as much respect as a person with millions, and a black, spanish, or Asian person deserves just as much respect as a white person.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Get him away from those kids and move him to another school.  Do what you can to teach him empathy toward other cultures.  He probably feels a lot of self loathing, especially with his dad leaving (feelings of being unwanted) and part of the nazi thing is "white power" which can be uplifting.  Maybe if he actually met some people of other races he may see that they are just people too, and his hate is misdirected.  I would also suggest counseling.|`|lvlCJDO3aa	I think you should get more involved with him .. dont get me wrong none of this is your fault.. i think you should get him involved in a organization that is mixed with different races.. some sort of team organization .. or something that will put him in a different setting also get his father involved if you can if not find a man that he looks up to and get him to get out ...|`|EgdR7cfTaa	did you really just say "colored"?<br>  <br>  you should take him out of the school he is in now and put him in an inner-city school where he'll be the minority.  i bet he won't be so outspoken then.|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	I'd use the fact that his father left as an excuse to tell him that I'd like "both of us" to go to counseling "because you seem to be very angry and upset with the world".<br>  <br>  If he has found something appealing about the Nazi side of the war he needs counseling while he's young.  <br>  <br>  I'd do whatever I could to get him away from those so-called "friends" - whether that would be to make sure he had a job that kept him busy, limited Internet access, limited money, limited transportation, or even a change of schools if possible.  I'd try to make sure he got into activities that included a lot of different kinds of people.  <br>  <br>  (Choosing to use the term, "colored", is a sign that maybe he hasn't been sent the right message at home either, even if in some subtle way.  People who respect African Americans don't use the term, "colored" these days.)|`|5abb6cf20f6d1b8b8ef23d153a85ab34aa	Wow, honey, I am so sorry you are going through this.<br>  <br>  You know, until recently, I lived under the false assumption that there was some blueprint for raising kids, that if followed, would turn out a productive member of society. <br>  <br>  I don't doubt that you've loved, nurtured, and done your best to instill good values. Think of the story of the prodigal son from the Bible (or Jacob's own brothers selling him into slavery). Obviously this problem has been around for a long, long time. <br>  <br>  I hope, for your sake and his, that he will return to a sane manner of thought and behavior--much as the prodigal son did. <br>  <br>  All I could say is, continue to love him. Be there for him when you can, but be firm in letting him know that you do not condone his behavior in any way.|`|X0ubZnPjaa	i would usually say never control who your kids decide to hang out with but in this circumstance i think its best to keep him as far away from them as possible. <br>  <br>  i agree with another post that you should show him how evil the Nazi actually were and what they really stood for .. im sure that's not what your some really believes in.<br>  <br>  if your both really close he should care about your feelings too, tell him how ashamed and sad it makes you feel and he might think twice about what he's doing.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	I don't know in which country you live, but in most countries in Europe styling yourself as a neo-Nazi is the ultimate form of provocation and protest against the "adult", politically correct world. That is what your son may be after. Many self-proclaimed neo-Nazis crave for attention and feel threatened by the world around them.They look for protection among friends where they can bask in simple images and explanations of the world, mixed with a strange form of nostalgia for a time they have never known.<br>  I'm afraid that there is not much you can do to help your son except to be available for him, talk with him and keep open a window to the real world out there. Don't expect him to tell you too much about his neo-Nazi friends and their activities. There is a good chance that he will outgrow this phase, especially since you have given him a background of loving parenting.<br>  Best of luck to you!|`|1hciyvKdaa	I would pack up and move. You are really at a teens mercy these days. <br>  He needs a boot camp type intervention. Kids are so set, so immature, so impressionable by friends. Im sorry, I hope something changes in his own mind, I fear it wont though. <br>  If your able to take him to school, pick him up, lock him in the house to show you mean business other than that, theres nothing you can do, a kid on drugs can get locked in a facility to get better, there is no real help. Go up to the school, they are not supposet to allow sect cults at school, get no help, go to the school board right away, and get them involved, they need to help with this. Seriously get the school on it, I tried to find a cult deprogrammer link with this in it, and could not. Good luck on that.|`|8fca5c297d662977a4d7b03db1ae059baa	lol umm "colored kid" isn't very PC...<br>  <br>  I'd start showing him how evil the Nazi's were... <br>  <br>  Schindler's List/Sophie's Choice might be good<br>  <br>  American History X is specifically about neo-nazis.<br>  <br>  <br>  But I agree with the previous poster, you need to get him away from those kids.
5abb6cf20f6d1b8b8ef23d153a85ab34aa	I don't care one way or the other about the choices of others. If you want kids, great! If you don't want kids, great! <br>  <br>  The only time a problem comes into play is when childless people start getting snarky about people with children or vice versa.<br>  <br>  I've run into childless people who want the whole world to be a childfree zone because children are a nuissance (in their opinion) and people with children who think children should go everywhere without any exceptions. Both attitudes are dead wrong.<br>  <br>  Kids shouldn't have free reign over the world, neither should adults. Live and let live.<br>  <br>  I say, if you don't have kids, try to respect those who do and if you do have kids, try to respect people who didn't follow your same life path. And for goodness sake, don't let the kids run riot at an adult gathering. <br>  <br>  Trust me, I know this is hard. I have three kids and two of them have sprouted horns lately. (One reason they won't be going anywhere remotely adult for a while...at least, not til' they straighten up.)|`|1jwbQaZTaa	for some that do not have children, they dont understand that being a GOOD parent is the most selfLESS and UNselfish thing a woman can do. and some mothers look at childless women and think they are selfish because they dont want to spend their lives nurturing children..<br>  <br>  <br>  but i think some women are meant to be mothers, and some are not. if you can distinguish what you are when your young and make that decision to either have a child or not have a child, that makes you unselfish in my eyes.<br>  <br>  selfish ones are the ones that have children yet dont take care of them, just use their children for pity, money, (HELLO, octo mom??)|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	neither is selfish. I am a mother and i love it. my daughter is my everything but some people are not interested in becoming parents and that's okay. it's not for everyone. Some people work and love working so they don't have time to be a parent, others don't like kids and i can't really think of any other reasons ive heard but no one should be judged wether they want to be a parent or decide not to. it's a personal choice.|`|93546fdb2e067ecf5800cd861c95c57daa	I see like this: some people are meant to have kids and be parents and their are some people that just aren't meant to be parents.<br>  <br>  Either way it's the individuals choice and no one has the right to judge because it's better to not bring kids in this world rather than have kids and treat them like crap.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i don't think either is in itself selfish. i do think it's selfish when ppl who don't want kids get pregnant anyways and then treat the kid like crap bc they didn't want children. or when they have children bc they think it'll get them attention, or help from the govt., etc.<br>  i imagine ppl think that bc partly jealousy of their freedom, but also bc GOOD parenting requires huge self-sacrificing and basically giving up your whole life for this child, putting their needs before your own always, and that is incredibly UNselfish. Childless ppl don't have to do that, and often times they don't. So childless ppl don't really know that depth of self-sacrifice.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Im pro choice. Some people dont want kids, I find myself actually envying my one friend, and all her vacations and freedoms that she has during hard episodes of parenting. Its not selfish to do what you want to do, now to pump out babies as a dog has puppies and give more kids less of a quality life, thats just pure stupidity.|`|um29wkUPaa	There's an assumed, detestable definition of the word selfish that wouldn't apply here.  It's (usually) a very unselfish person that has children, in that a good parent puts their children first.  They go without, they maybe turn down the career of a lifetime, they eat at Friendly's instead of elite restaurants now, and shop at thrift shops for themselves so that their kids can wear Osh Kosh.  There are plenty of parents that don't meet that criteria though.  Not every parent is unselfish.<br>  <br>  A person who decides not to have children for the reason they want their career, their free time, their money, peace and quiet, etc.  I suppose technically it's "selfish" by definition, but not at all in that frowned-upon way.  I think it's a mature, responsible, commendable person that would rather not have children, than to have children and still fight to keep everything they ever had/did/wanted before.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Because they can't mind their own business. Pure and simple. People have a knowledge for being a Busy Body, and because they have kids themselves it is quite natural to think that "You are the weird one." which is Preposterous. Yes, it is just as Selfish to have kids when it is for the wrong reason. "Aka: To Please a Mother in Law/Father In Law", "To Keep up with your Brother", "For Tax Purposes", etc.etc. <br>  Don't you worry about anyone thinking you are selfish. It is perfectly normal.|`|sAAnquoTaa	I don't think either is selfish. Some people love kids and want someone to nurture, love, teach, and to be the next generation of their family, and some just aren't the parenting type. It's everyone's choice.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Lol i have never said that those people are selfish please tell me how you can justify that a parent is selfish? We give everything to our kids thank you very much.
kaqPSgTVaa	You may go into labor earlier but keep in mind you are full term once you hit 37 weeks. I had my daughter at 36 and she was very healthy.  Try to rest as much as possible. I found sitting cross legged helped relive some unwanted pressure. You can try that.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	A friend was fully engaged at33 wks but she didn't hve  baby till39wks. good luck|`|59GymH27aa	It doesn't mean that you will go into labour early.  Most babies should be engaging at around the end of third trimester in preperation for birth.  When I was told my baby was fully engaged at 36 weeks I started getting all excited and panicking that my baby would be coming soon.  Turned out she was 12 days left.  <br>  <br>  The pressure on my area was really bad.  I had to bend over every so often when I walked.  You just need to rest and get lots of sleep.  Unfortunately there isn't much that can be done about the pressure but it's almost over and soon all the pain and discomfort will be worth it.<br>  XxX|`|JtcNY3Kqaa	it doesnt mean you will go into labor earlier than expected but there is always a possibilty you might.. i thought i was gonna deliver early because i was having hard contractions at 32 weeks and she was so low that the doctor was poking her in the head when she checked to see if i was dialated and she wasnt that far in me.. and i ended up delivering late!! but as far as the pelvic pain what helped me was laying on my side with a couple of pillows between my legs but other than that nothing really helped.. but good luck and i hoped this helped =D|`|VeuJB4lEaa	hey hunny, my sons head was engaged at 34 weeks but it wasnt a problem, i gave birth to him at 38weeks but got put on a drip to speed it up anyway but i dont think it was due to him being engaged so early, he was a whopper at 9lb 1oz but if u are concerned speak to your midwife :D xx|`|ETvV9aypaa	no doesnt mean anything. my baby was engaged at 32 weeks. I had a stillborn at 38 weeks and didnt go into labour at all b4 hand... good luck just enjoy and cherish every moment.. :)
dpPqH7BAaa	Most people will tell you not to do a self check because you risk infection. However you are already carrying the germs on your hands in your body, so you are less likely to get an infection than with a doctor who has his hands up 30 other women a day. Just make sure you wash your hands. It's good to know your own body. He may not be feeling the head through the dilated cervix, he may be feeling it resting in your lower pelvic bones resting against your cervix. This doesn't mean you aren't dilated a little, but probably not more than a few centimeters.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	You shouldn't self check - leave it to your doctor!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You would have to be VERY dilated to feel the head. This is why it's not good to self check your cervix. Unless you are medically trained you aren't going to know. My gynecologist was telling me when she went to med school and everyone had to do their first exam and find the cervix only 2 out of the 8 people could find it at first. <br>  <br>  Don't self check.<br>  <br>  ADD: If he felt the head then most likely you are very dilated and will go into labor soon. Stop self checking if he did feel the head you could cause an infection which would make labor and delivery A LOT more dangerous for you both.|`|2soyTz7eaa	Ah thats crazy! You really should not self check. Thats good you saw your doctor just trust his word. You risk infection and possibly hurting your baby with self checking.<br>  Good Luch with the rest of the pregnancy!!|`|op55FtqYaa	No No NO NOOOO! Never do that!<br>  <br>  If you want to know speak to your midwife. Never self check because you'll likely cause infection.
NmsBFeNJaa	No, you shouldn't. When you breastfeed you are giving all your vitamins, nutrients, etc to your child. That means that among other problems, you may have low iron levels which means you may become anemic and bleed profusely. It's better to either wait or check with your doctor so they can make sure your body is equipped to handle both a tattoo and breastfeeding.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	Do you like getting a tat while the baby is actively sucking your boob or in general.<br>  <br>  I would not because they tell you not to give blood if you had one less than a year ago so that means some of the ink moves around into your blood and the to your breast milk if your lactating.<br>  <br>  Since your an adult you can pass these things no problem, babies not so much.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	this is a good question, because the week i got my tattoo i was scheduled to give blood at a blood drive, and silly me, i didnt know i couldnt give blood in my state if i had a tattoo in the last 12 months. so i guess if it would affect your blood supply it could in turn affect your breastmilk.|`|VQZAxF5Laa	tattoos and breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  sounds like an album name for a rock band|`|QJoXFMYaaa	im not sure! im about to pop and have been craving to more ink done through my whole pregnancy! ive been told though, you cant as the ink goes into your bloodstream or something? thats how come you have to be careful about an artist if they use clean needles ect. thanks for asking this question though!|`|SHQHnKfcaa	It is safe, and whatever she wants to do let her....it's her choice!!<br>  <br>  I personally love tattoos|`|HQp1MGgvaa	i don't see why not, just as long as it's not on your breast.  I know duh, right? haha|`|74C2DOKGaa	Nope... that's extremely selfish of u. Don't worry about u, worry about ur baby!|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	Yes but go to a legit place, they ask u if ur pregnant, but never asked me if i was breastfeeding so i like it's ok|`|D7ewD6u3aa	I think it's not only the ink you need to consider. Is the tatooist running their studio safely so there is no risk of contracting any diseases like hepatitis and HIV, this is why I would imagine blood banks are not keen on wanting donations from recently tatooed people. Then you would need to research the likelihood of transmission through breast milk. This question needs more medical expertise I think.
OHfZFR31aa	Because parents don't want to ever admit that their children are not "perfect" <br>  <br>  But they would be better off focusing on what their child really does well and helping them develop that talent. Not all kids are book smart, but they may be amazing artists, or athletes or have some other talent.|`|8oKazGVGaa	umm maybe its because it is their child and many parents see anything their child does as smart..........|`|McZVvtvoaa	your weird...|`|4pkFJxNJaa	OK I'll bite. <br>  <br>   you could go two ways with this. <br>  <br>  1. It's natural order, survival of the fittest (not the smartest) Brains didn't get humans to where they are on the evolutionary chain, Brawn and physical prowess did and..............the ability to procreate. While brains definitely made life easier for the brawny, IE the speech, the wheel, fire. It was the strong man that hunted and caught the food or buillt shelters...The smart man was the one who left stories behind for us to know that. There is also the fact that with medical advancements, survivability of natural selection is through the roof. <br>  <br>  2. Parents can look past any flaw...If it's a birthmark, oh look she's blushing, He's not so smart, well he makes up for it other skills. <br>  It's how parents are able to defend their young, and only parents get that gift :D
VKQzj4Pmaa	I really enjoy this game . . . Everyone gets a paper plate and they place it on top of their heads. With a pen or pencil, everyone draws a picture of a baby on the plate, while it sits on your head. The plates get passed to the mom-to-be, and she picks the one she thinks is the best (while not knowing who drew what).<br>  <br>  Another popular baby shower game is this . . . Upon arrival, everyone receives a necklace. The necklace is usually made from a string of ribbon with a baby shower charm on it. The rule of the game is that if anyone sees you cross your legs, they can take your necklace(s) away. At the end of the day, whoever has the most necklaces wins.<br>  <br>  Another game that I enjoy, is the "Guess the mom-to-be's belly size." You pass around a roll of toilet paper or roll of ribbon, and everyone has a turn to guess how big her stomach is. You rip the toilet paper or cut the ribbon at the length you think will match the circumfrence her belly. Afterwards, everyone takes turns wrapping the paper or ribbon around the pregnant belly. Whoever came the closest to matching the right size of her belly, wins.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	we put chocolate bars into diapers and mushed them up and everyone had to guess what candy bar it was !!! it was disgusting but we all got a good laugh!<br>  <br>  and one called "baby birthing". we froze little plastic babys (party favors) into ice cubes, and everyone grabbed one and had to suck on it till the ice melted then they spit the baby out, winner got a goodie bag or whatever the prizes were. it was such a hoot.|`|fAr9qSmQaa	This isn't really a game.. But for my Aunts shower, and my Sisters shower we bought a bunch of WHITE plain onesies (various sizes) and fabric markers and had everyone decorate the onesies.. Then the M2B has a bunch of unique gifts, and once the baby out grows them they make a GREAT memento!|`|lKXtfYFxaa	At my baby shower my friend bought a bunch of white oneis and paint and had all the guest decorate one.  I got to pick my favorite and the winner won a gift.  The gift was a box of diapers that the winner gave back to me.  I still have those oneis, they made a great souvenir from that special day.   <br>  <br>  I was also able to save the paint which I used for my kids to do arts and crafts with.|`|ACjPwIc1aa	HMMMM WELL THIS ONE IS A BIG ICE BREAKER!!!!<br>  1ST: U SIT (IN THIS CASE) UR AUNT!!!

I am going to have a $50.00 visa card raffle and to enter you have to bring a big box of diapers|`|fUvB4MGWaa	At my shower, the one that had the most laughs was passing out a cheap paper plate to each of the guests, have them hold the plate on top of their head, and give them 30 seconds to draw a baby. The mom-to-be picks her favorite for the winner (I showed everyone the funniest ones). My advice is to not have too many - they can get pretty old quickly. As for gifts, we gave out some gift cards, and little decorative candle holders with candles, etc.|`|BpUo2WGkaa	I saw this one on tv once, you take a variety of chocolate bars and melt them down, it's good to have a variety of textures. Then you put some on diapers and then everyone has to taste them and guess what they are.<br>  <br>  It was quite funny to watch, probably sounds disgusting, but it was good.|`|Si9hhcW1aa	Ok, my favorite game is where you get a baby picture of everyone who is attending the shower and then place them on a board and everyone has to guess which pic is whose. It is a lot of fun!

1tmX7xbRaa	i will tell you what if that was my kid i would be horrified. however I wouldn't let something like that happened because if my kid was running around like an animal and being an obnoxious little brat i would have taken her home and disciplined her. some parents are the type that think everything their kid does is cute... needless to say it's not. i would NEVER allow my child to act that way. not just because it's wrong but it's also embarrassing and for your sil to think it's funny is Absolutely insane.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	Well even though I went to college, grew up, and moved away the rest of my family is still really red neck and if someone would not discipline their child and my family get together someone else will.  Why did not your husband do something.  I would have yanked my niece or nephew up and busted their little butt.  If I would not have and their parents did not, my mom or dad would have.  You see where I am going with this.<br>  <br>  If my family feels you are not being an effective parent they will either voice their opinion or give a demonstration and a fight to break out at a family reunion is quite common.  One year my cousin stabed my brother in the hand with a fork because he tried to take a piece of ham off his plate.  We had to take him to the hospital and they were both in their 20's at the time.<br>  <br>  I think grandma beat them both for making a scene and not taking the fight outside.|`|vkQOeDlUaa	Well, seeing as how my hubbys a drill sgt..my kids have discipline.  It drives me nuts the way kids act these days!  What drives me even more nuts are the parents!<br>  <br>  It's not really the kids fault, it is that parents fault...and sadly, there is nothing you can do to make things better, she will just keep going on the way she is going.  <br>  If I were your friend who had the baby I would have slapped your SIL.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	ugh that would drive me insane. my husband has a friend with 5 year old twins. these 5 year olds still dont talk, they drink from bottles and wear diapers. there is obviously a lack of parenting in that house as the children have no mental or physical disabilities. <br>  <br>  the children came to our house along with their parents for a BBQ last summer and i put my 6 month old down for a nap in her crib. the twins said they were going inside to get ice and i expected that their mother would keep an eye on them. after 10 minutes goes by i go inside to find them jumping in my daugthers crib! JUMPING in a crib with a 6 month old baby in it! i wanted ot take them out and whip their butts because they could have killled my daugther if they stepped on her head. the mom just took them out and said "no no". that was it?!?!?!<br>  <br>  some people... they take the whole "anti-spank" thing waay too far.|`|3a0d6717f085518722c0b3739942ccc2aa	Yes, the child most definitely needs to be taught some manners and control.  I don't like very strict parents and belive that children should be free to express themselves and play but up to a point and depending on their surroundings.  Problem is that most kids and parents I see nowadays act exactly as your nephew and SIL.  The sad truth is that you can't interfere with someone else's child.  Even though you may act out of concern for the other person's child, they find it insulting, unless of course they put your own children in danger in which case I would bloody well tell them off.|`|u00IalCZaa	Let me tell you. I understand. this past nov. my baby and her cousin had their pic taken together. I wasnt in favor of it bc they are so young. well I got very hyper when it looked like he was going to fall on her. Mybro inlaw got mad at me! canyou believe it.well then he apologized to our mil and not me. I was not pleased. see my son who was due one day different than his died. so I am super cautious.he is a rough boy and my girl will not be roudy. I guess I am going to be strict . I like peace and I dont like chaos.so no if they had done it to mine. not only would I have left. I would have kept a hold of my baby and no iinlaws would be around for a while. YOur sis in law needs to be straightened out.|`|nOmX8XGUaa	thats totally bad, when he grows up hes gonna be totaally violent. they gotta disipline him, cause otherwise who knows what will happen, especially when hes a teen. a thousand sorries to you kid|`|74C2DOKGaa	I would SMACK the living $h!t outta that child! My son knows better and he's only a year old!|`|NOjcTeT4aa	Wow, i agree with person above me if i was your friend i would have smacked your SIL. I dunno, maybe it seems wrong but i might have even considered knocking your nephew on his butt (i know its HORRIBLE but no one can say that all reasoning just goes out the window sometime when i comes to their kid). <br>  <br>  I also agree it's the parents with the problem, i was at the DMV Tuesday, and this little girl was hitting her mother, and her mother only said "stop" one time and nothing else, but this child kept hitting her.|`|QJoXFMYaaa	its soooooo frustrating!!! i find it difficult to be friends with people who do not discipline a child at all. it just frustrates me too much and i do not want my children thinking its ok to behave that way. i guess because you cant escape it, because she is a relative, you just need to think to yourself how you will never let your child get so out of control. And think of the future the problems she is going to have when she FINALLY has enough and decides to put her foot down. its going to be tough and hard!!! All you can do is know that people arent thinking of your child what they might be thinking of her's, and find peace in knowing your child knows his/her boundaries!
RE6GBw0Baa	oh my hunni, take a test, im as nervous as u i swear. lol xx<br>  <br>  let me know how u do xxxx|`|kykmpr0Caa	whats due on wednesday?? sorry for being stupid but you havent said|`|E6obQSpraa	Take a test hun...it will show up positive by now if you are (hopefully). Try the first response ones as they can detect up to 6 days before AF is due.<br>  <br>  Discharge is anything to woryy about normally unless its itchy or smells. Also, creamy lotion like mucas can be an early sign of pregnancy as its the plug forming on your cervix.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and keep us posted! xx|`|am7Ykwqiaa	Take a HPT. A yellowy non smelling discharge shouldn't worry you overly. If the area becomes smelly or itchy, see your GP.

Every woman has it just before labor begins. Sometimes up to a couple days, sometimes a few hours. You should tell your OB and be ready to go soon!|`|5mVnKKn3aa	I have the same thing and I'm due in one week! The doc told me it has to do with your plug getting ready to come out. I've already dilated one centimeter. Congrats on your little one!
ilLPvvU7aa	Have you two discussed kids before?  I would just feel him out by bringing the subject up, if he makes positive comments, just lay it on him and tell him what you want.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't base the decision on the economy.....if you are both ready to have children, you will be ok financially - you tend to make it work coz you have to.  We weren't that financially ready when we had our child but things worked out well in the end - you just have to decide what is a luxury and what is a necessity and go without if you have to.<br>  <br>  Just because you feel that you are not sure about the childcare job doesn't mean that you aren't ready to become a mum - looking after other peoples kids is way different from bringing up your own.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|74C2DOKGaa	Don't tell him if he is not going to support you. Just stop taking your birth control, don't use a condom and make it happen. You are thinking this out wayyyy too much. I mean having kids is hard, but worry about that later!|`|lNmtjtHsaa	Ask your fiancee if you can have unprotected sex. Dont try protected not if you want a baby.|`|NOjcTeT4aa	Wait till after your wedding.|`|412167FVaa	Just casually bring it up and see his reaction if it is receptive then seriously talk about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	let me tell you..a child will cost alot of money to raise..clothing, housing, food, ELECTRONICS, EDUCATION and most important. love and resposibitly, and YOUR TIME to raise it.... are u ready to give this ?
AA11763588	You are stressing way to much.<br>  <br>  You need to find a hobby or take up reading. Take a nice warm bath dim the lights and play some light music.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I think you should call your doctor. It's perfectly ok and expected to have to call them from time to time. Call your doctor. it sounds like you need some help.|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	Sounds rough. First of all, you REALLY need to stop the worrying. I know its hard sometimes, but you are putting stress on your baby by doing this. I was a mess up until 12 weeks, as i have miscarried twice. But i knew the more i stressed myself out the more there was a chance i would hurt the baby myself. I got an Angel sound heart beat monitor and everytime i felt a freak out coming on I would use it and listen to my babys heart beat. It honestly worked wonders. You should be able to hear babys heart beat on a monitor by now so u should invest in one.|`|EHvb0Ohpaa	WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN UR LIFE UR RELATIONSHIP IS IT OKAY UR JOB FINANCES ECT CAN GIVE U PANIC ATTACK I HAD A HERD TIME BREATHING TIGHTNESS OF CHEST FELT A TON OF BRICKS ON MY CHEST PRESSURE ON MY LUNGS DR TOLD ME WAS A PANICK OR ANXIETY.

Knowing you're having a baby is overwhelming, but let me tell you, I've raised my daughter for 3 years all by myself and everything worked out well.  She's doing great.  i find that when you overanalyze things, things tend to work out easier than I thought.  It's easier said than done, I know.  When you feel that way, do something that keeps your brain busy, tell your brain to shutup and think of positive things.  <br>  <br>  Talk to an advice nurse and see if you can see the doctor earlier than that.
ePEQcIz3aa	Don't listen to a guy unless he's a doctor, because he doesn't have a vagina, thus no clue as to what is happening in there.<br>  <br>  My sister bled while she was pregnant and had two healthy children.  Some women continue to bleed, doesn't mean a placenta is breaking down for a menstrual cycle.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to see a doctor though. You could have a bug in which antibotics will be prescribed.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test.|`|9BxpGX3Daa	I know I'm a guy and all, but I thought that when you start bleeding that is the beginning of the shedding of the uterus, thus if any had been "in there" would have bled out. But if memory serves me right, there could still be a possibility of that happening and becoming pregnant. As with all these questions, not one of our answers is going to be correct as the only correct thing to do is get a pregnancy test and if you need more, go to the doctors. As for your temperature, those are normal numbers as our temps can fluctuate a few degrees and we are still healthy. Overall, if you want exact answers, I suggest trekking down to Walgreen's of Rite Aide and purchasing EPT.
LLq9uPi4aa	I had my son when I was 18... he's now 15, in college already, he's an awesome kid.  I have a Masters degree in Social Work and am finishing my PhD.  I am still with the baby's father (who is now my husband).  Here are my tips:<br>  <br>  -build support systems... in your family, extended family, people who are healthy and fairly well-adjusted... tell them you love them and that you know you're going to need their love and support.<br>  <br>  -DO get on welfare or public assistance or WIC or any services you are eligible for.  See if your local public health or school program has a teen pregnancy home visiting program.  Often they can help with material goods, as well as provide support and connect you with other young parents.  Don't be ashamed if you need assistance, because you WILL... either emotional or financial or both.  It's better that you get it than your child get off to a bad start.<br>  <br>  -Stay together if it's a healthy relationship.  It will be hard sometimes and rocky sometimes.  See about counseling if you've got stuff to work out. Sharing a baby when you're not together is really really hard.<br>  <br>  -Stay away from drugs, drinking, bad influences, people who will bring you down.<br>  <br>  -Go to school if you can.  Take college classes online.  Take early education classes, it's funner to watch your baby grow when you understand early childhood development.  Read lots of books, join yahoo groups for young moms, find community.<br>  <br>  -Use birth control/good protection.  Two is a lot tougher than one.<br>  <br>  -Breastfeed.  It's good for you, good for baby, good for bonding. It saves money.   It's not hard once you get used to it.  A lactation consultant at the hospital will be happy to help you.  Don't give up.<br>  <br>  -Know that everyone thinks they're not getting it all right sometimes.  It's normal.  If you think you have postpartum depression, though, talk to your doctor and get support.<br>  <br>  -Remember that your level of education and life choices are the number one predictor of what your child will attain.  Keep striving for your goals.  Demonstrate healthy relationships and good communication skills.<br>  <br>  Good for you for taking parenting and Lamaze.  Keep it up.  Best wishes, and congratulations.  There has been nothing more rewarding in my life than my son.|`|FadwoZW5aa	I'm in the same boat. I'm 20.. but I still don't feel like I'm ready to be a mother. Baby is  due March 26th. I'm really nervous as well. Everyone tells me that once the baby gets here.. You will know exactly what to do.. Motherly instincts. I'm hoping their right. I've got millions of baby books though.. Just in case my motherly instincts. Good Luck with everything. And congratulations.|`|IZTmipyaaa	I don't think anyone is truly ready when they are pregnant with their first baby. I'm 25 and i'm 8 months and 2 weeks pregnant with my first baby and i'm really nervous and scared about it. My husband is a great support though, but i'm just really scared about the whole labor thing. Don't worry, you will be a good mother and you will know what to do once the baby is here. Good luck!|`|5FdFIyguaa	chill ya<br>  everything gonna be alright ................<br>  u should not be scared inspite of that u should enjoy the pain <br>  and u should feel happy that u r going to have baby ............<br>  that is awesome feelings really <br>  ..................|`|57j6hSjNaa	It's great you acknowledge your not ready for a baby, but you acknowledged a tad to late.. Always think before you lay down.. Five minutes of lust is not worth a life time worth of responsibility your not ready for.. <br>  <br>  However, that's great you and the father are still together, but since your so young I would suggest that you always think ahead. I don't know your man, but men can come and go as they please. So always make sure everything you do right now in your life will benefit you and your baby in the long run..<br>  <br>  I would also suggest not putting your dreams on hold. Yes, you have to focus on the baby now, but its still possible to continue your education and raise a child.. You will have no regrets in life if you continue to accomplish your goals..<br>  <br>  I'm not a mother, but all I can say is continue your parenting classes, college education and fulfill your dreams, while being the best mommy you know how. A happy mother makes a happy baby... <br>  <br>  Another peace of advice, don't have anymore if your not ready.. Example: Married, College grad., career with good benefits.. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and best wishes !|`|UABIq8zxaa	Well congrats, but why would you want to bring a baby into this world at the WRONG time? Recession ring a bell? lol<br>  Here's some tips: Don't get on Welfare, taxpayers have enough stress on their plates, plus they're cutting off welfare for all the slackers who just wanna lay up in bed and have babies all day, jobless and no education.<br>  You have a diploma, thats very good, but people are looking past GED's and diplomas, they mean nothing in this day and age. They want degrees, are you willing to go to college? I'm not trying to be mean but its some knowledge for that azz girl.<br>  My sister had got prego, said she'd wait five years, turns out the baby came sooner than she planned. Her stupid husband left the Navy, they were set for life, but him being stupid he left. Got a few checks from the Navy, then that stopped, now they're on Wick. I guess its something like welfare, but not. They had a house in Hawaii, they don't have anything anymore, all because he left the Navy. Now they come over my house trying to eat everything. smfh. Heres a tip, tell your man to take his azz to the NAVY if you wanna be takin care of because in this Recession? No one gives a damn about you and your problems, people are trying to make it as is. Good luck.
tHEBPDenaa	Orion is okay... I think it's the kind of name that would grow on people the more you hear it... I guess he would end up getting called Ori and that's kind of cute... I think Orion could be a good name.<br>  I'm not a huge fan or Arwen... It's not horrible but I don't like it. I would use Arlen over Arwen... But if you like it, go for it! It's definitely not bad.

a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	You didnt mention how old was your partner? Both of you may want to consider pre-conception health screening before or after marriage. It is a fertility health screening where both need to undergo some blood and physical testes. The man will need to do a SA - semen analysis and for the woman a pelvic ltrasound. You may wan to include additional check such as pap smear and HSG to check if there is blockage in the fallopian tubes. The doc may not recommend any fertility treatment since you have not been ttc for over a year or more than 30yrs old.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Most doctors aren't worried about fertility if your yearly gynecological exams are normal as well as your pap smears. They also usually don't want to do expensive tests unless you've been actively trying and not been able to conceive.
kaqPSgTVaa	Best to ask your doctor. That could be sooo many things.<br>  <br>  Add: If it would make you feel better you can always call labor and delivery.|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	i think you should contact your midwife or doctor just to ease your mind
yPLS0FeWaa	There's a possiblity he could be autistic. Each person with autism is different. Some characteristics can be more profound in some than others. Some may have some characteristics but not other characteristics. There are other conditions that have similiar or can share some characteristics of autism as well so even though he may have some characteristics it may not be autism. There's also certain conditions that can co-exist with autism. The best way to know for sure would be to have him evaluated.  In most cases with autism all of their behavior is some form of communication, they simply don't know how to communicate it like we do so it comes out in their behavior.  If he is autistic it is very important to get the help he needs asap, the earlier he gets help the more likely he will overcome many of his characteristics and live a very normal life. Trying to get his mother to come to reality can be tricky whether it is autism or something else, the charcateristics should become more noticable as he gets older to the point where it doesn't seem normal in her mind. If worse comes to worse, when he gets to starting school, they should recognize something isn't quite right and mention that to her because they would want to conduct their own assessment. Is there someone else you can talk to about it in her family such as her husband if married, a sibling, etc.  Maybe if she heard it from one of them she would take it more into consideration without the fear of being offended, or even if all of you could get together and approach her as a group. Or maybe mention it to her saying that it may not be your business and you don't want to offend her, but you're concerned because you care about the well being of her son and that your there to support both her and him. No mother wants to hear their child is autistic, it is not the end of the world if he is, many excel in math, music and arts and have unbelievable memory skills.  Here's a list of the common characteristics from the autism society <a href="http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_whatis_char" rel="nofollow">http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageS...</a><br>  aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior <br>  difficulty initiating and/or maintaining a conversation<br>  insistence on sameness; resistance to change <br>  difficulty in expressing needs, using gestures or pointing instead of words <br>  repeating words or phrases in place of normal, responsive language (echolalia) <br>  laughing (and/or crying) for no apparent reason showing distress for reasons not apparent to others <br>  preference to being alone; aloof manner <br>  tantrums <br>  difficulty in mixing with others <br>  not wanting to cuddle or be cuddled <br>  little or no eye contact<br>  unresponsive to normal teaching methods <br>  sustained odd play <br>  spinning objects <br>  obsessive attachment to objects <br>  apparent over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to pain <br>  no real fears of danger <br>  noticeable physical over-activity or extreme under-activity <br>  uneven gross/fine motor skills <br>  non responsive to verbal cues; acts as if deaf, although hearing tests in normal range<br>  sensory integration (this can be a variety of things such as sensory to lights, sounds, textures, foods, etc, some may have sensory issues with certain things and not others, or a combination of things) If he has sensory issues that can leave to behaviorial problems as well, he can have sensory integration without having autism.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Could be aspergers syndrome or autism.  A classic sign of autism is not interacting with people, looking at them or talking with them, being in your own world.  The other behaviour isn't necessarily autism though, lots of kids draw on walls at that age & throw stuff around & don't do as they're told!  That part is normal, the other part isn't.  I'm surprised no one close to her like family or her partner have noticed, or her doctor as they usually check development when you go there.  <br>  <br>  If you don't feel comfortable saying something to her about his non communication then maybe say something to someone in her family if you happen to see them.<br>  <br>  Regardless of what is wrong with him, if you don't want her coming round with him then you can take the cowards way out & just keep saying you're busy (until she gets the message) or just be open & say look I'm tired & it's difficult to have him around as to be honest he doesn't behave as well as my other friends kids that age.  Yes that will offend her but too bad, you're offended by her not doing anything about his behaviour.  And she does need to address his issues & someone needs to point it out to her.  I do this often with strangers as I'm appalled at how people allow their kids to behave in public.  I politely say things like, you know when I was that age I just wouldn't have done that, my parents would have told me off.  Or just out of curiousity, did you behave that way at that age?  They get the message, look embarrased, but I've had no abuse from it as I say it politely & what I'm saying is reasonable & true.  Also glaring at parents when their kid misbehaves works well too!!|`|NqEZ120iaa	IT could be Autism, but this forum is not a place to make that diagnosis. Advise your friend to see a specialist, if she has not already done so, and get some help. If it is Autism, early intervention is vital for his development.<br>  <br>  Also let her know, with the right behavioral therapy, children with Autism can respond enormously - there is hope.|`|wHOQXToHaa	THere is a program across the US called Early Steps. It is an intervention program specifically designed for children from 0-3 yrs. of age and will for FREE evaluate the child by an occupational therapist, psychologist, etc. My son is on the other end, gifted, but slow in social advancements and we have gone thru this system and it is fabulous. A little hard if the mother is in denial, but if she will listen have her call Early Steps in her area and set up an appointment. They can give her son free therapy in the areas he needs.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Symptoms of autism:<br>      *   Social interactions and relationships. Symptoms may include:<br>            o Significant problems developing nonverbal communication skills, such as eye-to-eye gazing, facial expressions, and body posture.<br>            o Failure to establish friendships with children the same age.<br>            o Lack of interest in sharing enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people.<br>            o Lack of empathy. People with autism may have difficulty understanding another person's feelings, such as pain or sorrow.<br>      * Verbal and nonverbal communication. Symptoms may include:<br>            o Delay in, or lack of, learning to talk. As many as 40% of people with autism never speak.1<br>            o Problems taking steps to start a conversation. Also, people with autism have difficulties continuing a conversation after it has begun.<br>            o Stereotyped and repetitive use of language. People with autism often repeat over and over a phrase they have heard previously (echolalia).<br>            o Difficulty understanding their listener's perspective. For example, a person with autism may not understand that someone is using humor. They may interpret the communication word for word and fail to catch the implied meaning.<br>      * Limited interests in activities or play. Symptoms may include:<br>            o An unusual focus on pieces. Younger children with autism often focus on parts of toys, such as the wheels on a car, rather than playing with the entire toy.<br>            o Preoccupation with certain topics. For example, older children and adults may be fascinated by video games, trading cards, or license plates.<br>            o A need for sameness and routines. For example, a child with autism may always need to eat bread before salad and insist on driving the same route every day to school.<br>            o Stereotyped behaviors. These may include body rocking and hand flapping.|`|bf977d45406286cec89ce77e17169069aa	It sounds like he may have Autism, or something wrong with his hearing? but what has your friend say about how he behaves and acts?  My nephew has severe autism, so I'm aware of some behaviors, which are: no eye contact, doing something repetitively over and over, they do something very well but not so well in others, very picky eater.  Wants to be alone rather than in a group.  Doesn't understand directions or stop the behavior, pretty much goes back to it after a minute of a parent telling him/her no.  And kids with autism tend to be in their own world, they do things that you wouldn't understand but they like it.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can be subtle, and when he throws a behavior or if she complains about him acting up, maybe you can ask what her child's doctor think about how he behaves and acts.   Say that you are concerned and you may think he is showing some symptoms of autism.  Just do it lightly because some are in strong denial and they may take offense to it.<br>  <br>  I suggest if you're not comfortable around him to keep your meetups neutral like in a public setting, such as stroller walking, kid's play area? her house?
op55FtqYaa	The symptoms of pregnancy aren't a check list sweetheart. We're all individual and so the pregnancy is individual. <br>  <br>  You won't have a  "Bump" until about 5-6 months. Even then you might still just look normal. I didn't show until I was near enough 8 months.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yup. Some women never get symptoms. Feel lucky.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	You don't necessarily have to symptoms while you are pregnant. If your doc said your baby is fine, I would not be concerned.

And by the way, CONGRATULATIONS!!|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	Everyone is different, some get them bad, some dont get them at all and some get them later than others. I didnt have any symptoms at all.. i almost didnt believe that i was pregnant! I am now 22 weeks and have a bump to show for it now so i can now believe it! Enjoy not having any, coz u wouldnt want to get hit with it all right?! good luck :-)|`|5p0AW33jaa	yes its normal. every pregnancy is different. with my second pregnancy i barely had any symptoms aside from sore boobs. not until i was on my second trimester that a little of every symptoms started to appear.|`|VeuJB4lEaa	yes its fine, you just may be one of these lucky women lol, i am bout 4-6 weeks and iv only got sore bb's and tired but thats it, lets hope i dont get it bad again this time ...bleurgh!x|`|MCWNXCa5aa	sure its normal, even my self from the very first week of my pregnancy upto now in my 23rd week i dont feel any symptoms like vomiting, diziness and nausea...the only changes i feel when i became pregnant was frequently urinating and sore boobs, and now some martial arts, kickin' of mah baby! hahahaha so funny to feel those movements. some women says im really lucky to feel nothing! we'll it was my first child and i think im really that lucky having this baby!

mCF4wGjdaa	Hi Shae e,<br>  it's one way of releasing anger and liver jams (the liver isn't fully developed until about 4 years of age). <br>  <br>  Another way is laughter.<br>  <br>  Laugh with her and you'll both get the joy you need.<br>  <br>  Blessed be<br>  <br>  Karma Singh|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I usually ignored things that were just fits or tantrums and my daughter would just stop after a bit cause she saw I didn't have any reaction. My rule of thumb was always ignore the bad behavior until I could start giving time outs. It worked out pretty well for me. My daughter is 4 and healthy, happy, loved, and very well behaved.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I don't think your baby is aware that she is throwing a tantrum. My 9 month old does this when something is taken from him. When we have to take something away from him that he can't have, we try to replace it with something before hand. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When he does get very upset, I usually pick him up and try to distract him and change his mood. He doesn't know what he is doing and is too young to manipulate anyone. Babies get upset for many reasons, and they need help regulating their emotions. They are unable to do this on their own at such a young age. Now, when they get to be around 2, that is another story. For now, I would try to distract your baby when she gets overly upset and show her how to be happy by changing her environment, trying to make her laugh, showing her something interesting, etc.<br>  <br>  Take care!|`|vsFJZRkGaa	choose how you'd like her to behave and choose the rules of the house e.g. water cups are for drinking. <br>  everytime she disobeys the rule, remind her of the rule and if you can, show her how it is done. when she follows the rule show her you are proud of her for doing the right thing.<br>  starting this early will save you years of pain!! <br>  <br>  as for the tantrums try to offer her a choice of two things as much as possible. offer two pairs of socks so she can choose which one to wear. offer two toys and let her pick one. that sort of thing. often tantrums are children crying out to be allowed to be in control of their own environment, so offer a little control through choice making. <br>  <br>  if she tantrums, acknowledge her emotion out loud - sometimes they just want you to know how they are feeling. and tantrums are scarey for baby's, so she'll be looking for your reassurance as well. for e.g say something like "you are angry because you aren't allowed to play in the toilet. when you calm down come and give me a cuddle" and then ignore the tantrum. if you acknowledge and give guidance your baby will know that you love them, you are there for them, and it is okay if they feel angry sometimes.<br>  <br>  i know this advice may seem too advanced for some 8mth olds, but the sooner you start, the easier life will be.|`|145RUNQHaa	Your baby is just trying to communicate with you how else is she going to do it?she's trying to tell you she's not happy about something when she's screaming.try to figure out what she's trying to tell you don't ignore her.put yourself in her shoes.she can't talk she gets upset she can't get her message across.it's a frustrating time for babys.try and work out what she's trying to say if you can't figure it out and she's otherwise comfortable distract her or rock her and soothe her.|`|vErfaRB5aa	I think that your baby is going through a natural phase of when they start to become aware of their own personality and relationship with you and how they can manipulate someone else as they are expecting a reaction. Just ignore it totally, baby sounds very clever . Dont react or look the other way, once they realise that they get no reaction from it they will soon stop.|`|u00IalCZaa	am I so happy to hear that someone else is in my shoes. I will use your advice. Do you ever just get stressed about  the behavoir especially if you have been alone wsiht her a long while?|`|1xsUVtzBaa	Temper tantrums-<br>  Considering the complexities of life, and the circumstances under which many children are reared, I think it amazing more do not display outward signs of temper. After all, self-control must be learned,for nobody is born with this as an in-built attribute.<br>  Children are often the product of their environment and,in early formative years,that environment is the home and the members comprising the family unit. If there's perpetual dissension,infighting, disharmony and friction,then babies will automatically absorb this into their own subconscious mind. In turn this will reflect back,for as they witness the activities of others,so this will soon be regarded as the normal reaction to certain situations.<br>  If they see others shouting and hurling things around,then this is the reaction that will take place in a similar position.<br>  I think self-control by parents is vital to the normal development of a child. Babies brought up in a serene,secure and loving atmosphere will have fewer bouts than those subjected to a harassing atmosphere. Give it some thought.<br>  (all info taken from the book "Parenting..family medical care" by Dr.James Wright)<br>  *This info is taken from a book written by a doctor and not my actual opinion..but hey it might help.|`|slILtaEiaa	Ignore it! If She is throwing a tantrum because she is frustrated, try to help her, but if she is throwing one for the sake of throwing one, just try to ignore it. If you're anything like me, you'll be hiding your face a lot while you laugh at the tantrum, lol.|`|9EmOuiovaa	its all a bit of both, try to distract her if you see one coming and do your best to ignore it when they do happen. as long as she is safe all is well. set your boundries and rules now and let her know what they are and stick to them.
AA11763588	Typically pregnancy symptoms, which are about the same as PMS, start around weeks 3.5 - 4.5.<br>  <br>  Morning sickness usually starts about week 6.<br>  <br>  Peeing a lot happens later on in pregnancy... so does eating odd things.<br>  <br>  You'll just have to wait till you miss your period and take a test.<br>  <br>  FYI, stress can delay a period.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	You should have gotten the morning after pill. You will have to wait and see now (4 weeks after you had sex is the norm before taking a pregnancy test) Hopefully the test will be negative for you.<br>  <br>  You could end up getting yourself into a lot of trouble with pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases if you don't know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  You should always use protection when having sex, but please remember that there is still a chance you could become pregnant even whilst using protection, even though the chances are much lower, so make sure you are financially stable enough for a baby if you're going to fool around.|`|HkWTYhjDaa	Well it sounds that you might be pregnant. Every woman is different from another. I didn't have a lot of symptoms. As far as i can remember i only missed my period and pee a lot, but as weeks goes by the symptoms started to show, tired i throw up all day everyday and i feel so hungry all the time, sored breast and yes i become a little emotional.<br>  I suggest you have a test done.|`|RPc63EK2aa	i was already 2 months preggo when i knew it...i did not experienced morning sickness at all, but like you i was very tired, and pee a lot, those are the signs i had during my first 2 months... so u better have a test to make it sure whether u are pregnant or not.|`|QBFbvO21aa	are your periods different? u can still slightly bleed if your preggers.<br>  take a prego test.<br>  also..it could be all in your head stressing on it too much and...<br>  maybe it's just bad pms.
cGNaZU4Gaa	Your only pregnant if you are excreting cheese and whipped cream, your good.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It could be PMS too.<br>  <br>  Swollen belly means bloating (which is also not necessarily pregnancy related). Swollen belly doesn't happen until MUCH later in pregnancy.|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	yeah you could be... but its a bit early for the cravings coz by the sounds of it, if you havent missed a period you would be less than 4 weeks pregnant. But it is possible. Take a test once u miss a period|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Odd? Sounds like a pregnant woman to me! BUT don't stress to hard.<br>  Could mean that your period is just around the corner! So..<br>  <br>  BUT if i were you, buy a test soon! Less stress on you!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|lNmtjtHsaa	Could be pregnancy though its unlikely if you havent missed your period. Take a pregnancy test just to be sure though|`|AA10426129	more than likely.<br>  Call Maury he can find your baby daddy|`|57j6hSjNaa	The symptoms sound like it.. But you said, "No missed period yet," so the only way to find out is to get an early detecting pregnancy test or visit a doctor.|`|146iNd9Iaa	It's 3:28 here and I'm eating cashews while typing on the Yahoo Answers, am I pregnant?|`|HkWTYhjDaa	if you had unprotected sex then there are chances that you might be pregnant. Why not take a pregnancy test? Goodluck.|`|8k79Kv7faa	what have you been up too  will answer the question<br>  hope not any hanky panky <br>  take care  play safe your choice
kaqPSgTVaa	I doubt that is pregnancy related. My body was doing all sorts of crazy things when I was trying to get pregnant last year.
lKsIKKm2aa	Sounds exactly like my son.. Yeah, he must be going thru a growth spurt..My baby Jayden nursed every 1 1/2-2 hrs for probably the first 2 months (we also co-sleep and 3hrs is the longest he went w/o nursing at night, until about 3 months when all of a sudden he started sleeping a good 5 6 sometimes 7 hrs at night! Boy were my boobs engorged in the am!! But now he's 5 mo old, mostly wakes up once to nurse but falls right back to sleep..it's so nice co-sleeping. I love it. Almost as much as I love breastfeeding;)~<br>  Bahh humbug for any thumbs down I get for my 'attached parenting' ways...|`|9EmOuiovaa	at 5 wks your son should be going for more than 2 hours between feeds, he should be able to last 3 hours during the day and up to 5 at night. co sleeping is great i did it for awhile with my son but found i had to get hime out of the bed if i ever wanted him to stop feeding all night long. once i stopped the co sleeping it made it easer to streach out the day time feeeds. im not sure about the second Q though sorry
iwcp9rJzaa	you should just tell him what worries you and why it worries you. maybe you could tell him to invite his friends over for the weekend or a night during the week. so you can meet them and you will know where they are. if he asks to go some where with his friends or over to his friends house then be the driver so you can see where he is going.<br>  tightning the reighns never works too well. it will just make your son want to rebel even more.|`|5IA9Qe2aaa	Well i'm 17 so i remember exactly what i was like when i was 12 so i'll just say what my mom did and how it affected me; i was also getting pretty mouthy to my parents but you have to understand that at that age, all a kid thinks is about his friends, popularity and having fun so it gets a bit tense once in a while but nothing big; the best you can do is ground him if he does something bad and educate him about falling in the wrong crowd, the best way like my mother did was to bring me downtown and show first hand how the people from the wrong crowd lived (eg : showing bums etc..) and i knew she wanted what was best for me; it didn't stop me from smoking weed occasionally and drinking a few drinks, heck i'm not perfect BUT times will change and around my age, your kid will smarten up again and grow up a fine member of society.<br>  4 blocks is fine but don't let him ride the bike too far, that's giving him alot of freedom, show him that you trust him and that even though you're though at times that he knows you still love him.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Trust me, this is coming straight from somebody that first hand knows this thing. Don't toughen up on him too much, it will make him worse. You do need to give him freedom, yes, it's good that you realise that because alot of parents actually don't. Don't give him too much freedom so that he would get even worse, but don't give out too him too much because he will feel like he wants to rebel even more, which he will. I don't know how long 4 blocks is, or how long even a block is because I'm not from America so I can't answer that part, sorry. But you can find out more about his friends and his goings-on through social networking sites. Does he have a myspace, bebo, youtube or facebook account? You could look at those and find out what kind of crowd he hangs around with and that sort of thing. Though don't cross the line and invade his privacy by checking his myspace or whatever every day.<br>  <br>  Him getting mouthy is basically just a part of his age and him growing up so there isn't quite alot you can do to prevent or stop it. And your son probably thinks ''why is she being so mean to me? I didn't even do anything wrong (so to speak)'' And that would make him rebel more, the fact your giving out to him when he genuinely did not do anything wrong. Now, I'm not saying you actually did that, but it's just a theory. Make sure when you give out to him or whatever you do, that there is genuinely a good reason for it. Think about it, because when you start giving out when he didn't do much wrong, he will feel like ''well she is gonna give out to me anyway, so i may aswell do something bad''. If you get my point?<br>  <br>  I'm sure your son is responsible enough as to not get a girl pregnant, you could have ''that talk'' with him if you feel uncomfortable about him being with girls and warn him about the pregnancy and STD things.<br>  <br>  And I know it would be hard for you to ''let go'' of him, but you need to understand, although it seems like you already do, that he is growing up, he is at the age where he needs his freedom and needs a bit of breathing space from you, if you don't let him have this, he WILL get worse and he WILL treat you worse. So don't let yourself let that happen.|`|F6g2iH78aa	you should be able to let him walk places by himself. and im sure he knows not to let anyone...kidnap him<br>  and you hopefully you should feel that you have raised your son to be more responsible than to fall into the wrong crowds or get a girl pregnant|`|OoftsMLhaa	The most important thing is communication as long as he is willing to talk and you're willing to listen and vice versa then you can guide him but hes a kid and he's growing up and he will make bad decisions hopefully ones that aren't to permanent all you can do is be there and teach him the little things along the way.  <br>  <br>  Especially at this age he is going to fight you at every turn.  Just be honest and don't bullshit him with horror stories or lame excuses why this or that.  Trust him and tell him the truth and that your proud of him.  For a kid its a lot more motivation to do the right thing NOT because you're afraid of the consequences but fear of letting down/disappointing the people that care about you.<br>  <br>  If you want to know about his friends have them come over.|`|wi5NqhAcaa	hey,<br>  <br>  At the age of 12 my parent's let me have sleep overs and things like that. Maybe if you would like to get to know his mates a little bit better then maybe you should invite them over to stay and to family outings. You wouldn't be able to get to know them better other wise you did some secret investigation case. I think that he is a teenages and yes he is going through puberty and it can be really hard. I remember when i got my period that i almost broke down in the bathroom because i couldn't figure how to insert a tampon, i was about 12. I think that it can be an emotional time. The only time that you should worry about your son is when he leaves the bank and it starts going down hill. I used to play the saxaphone. If you are getting yourself into misschuff is when your band starts failing. Trust me i know. You will be right. If you start pulling in the reins and start being tough on the things that he wants to do, you will find that he would do it behind you back and lie about it anyway. If you want to let him do things but are too afraid to, just do it. But you have to be nice and be able to let him talk to you or other wise he won't tell you what he is getting up to. If you get mad at him for a little mistake that he makes then he won't ever tell you again. Be nice and he will tell you everything and anything that you want to know.|`|z2leWA1naa	You should try to give him some responsibility for himself. After all, the child is getting older, and by this stage in growth, children act like they know everything. Also, this may be awkward, but try to discuss this matter with your child. I'm sure that he already knows about all of this, and will heed you, as long as you don't take a harsh appearance. Preteens like to be told that they are right, so when you try to steer them toward the right direction, you have to do it in such a way so he agrees with your reasoning. Good Luck.

jKMH27gKaa	Like marqueen said, a pitocin drip (like an IV) is what induces labor; first they will probably insert a Cytotec tablet to soften/ripen the cervix first. The softening part alone can take 24 hours. Once your cervix is softened, you are ready for the pitocen. Some women respond right away, others have to keep moving (not easy dragging the drip around with you but it does work). They will likely hook you up at the start for monitoring, too, to keep an eye on baby's heartbeat (that's often the first thing that happens) <br>  <br>  Once you water breaks (or after they break it) and the pitocen kicks in, you will find the labor pains come faster than normal, so don't worry if you have to ask for an epidural to help block the pain. Labor induced is relatively shorter, usually, unless it's happening as the result of prolonged labor.|`|NhPSz1kHaa	They give you an IV of pitocin ( a pit drip ).  It's similar to the oxytocin that your body produces when you go into labor.  That will cause labor to start.  It is also used if you have been in labor a long time and it isn't going anywhere.|`|SyVQF3FHaa	you wait it out till you start to dilate, you go through some pain depending on how much pain you can handle. if its still not working they give you more in your iv. well good luck and congrats.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	my doctor used a gel which he put up inside me then i had to stay layin down for half hour, then 6hrs later he check  me ova in it had started to work so i just had to wait for my waters to brake (if they didnt braake by morning he would have broke them) they brake an hour later.
kaqPSgTVaa	That actually isn't a lot of variation. That's not too much of a big deal. ALSO if it was cause for concern your doctor would have said so. Unless your doctor says to worry don't worry.
xIlIbZJtaa	I am a veteran with side by side doubles! We have 3 yr old twins and I have always walked literally miles every day.  We wore out 3 side by side buggies before finding one that works for us!<br>  I'm not 100% sure about the Zooper Tango as I havent seen one but although the Aria was my first choice, it was poorest performing buggy. As far as I know, the graco seat doesn't fit. The wheels wore unevenly which made it difficult to push - it would always go towards one side. This will be especially true if you dont keep swapping your eldest and youngest onto different sides as the wheels will wear unevenly. We look after our things but it did only last 6 months or so. <br>  Same problem with the Graco Duo and the Chicco. I guess it is the same with all the four wheelers if you use them regularly.<br>  We went on to a Mothercare Three Wheeler pushchair and it is amazing! Although they are heavier to lift, I would call it the most lightweight to push as the neumatic wheels make it so easy  it feels like it is wheeling itself and you are having to keep up with it - unbelievable! The wheels never go flat, even if you go over glass, and it does actually fit in the car if you find the position. It doesnt have a divide in the middle so each child can have as much room as they need, and our newborn was great in it with the lovely padded cushions and cosy toes. It looks so posh too!<br>  Good luck with your baby! Hope you find your perfect carriage - it's like buying a car!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	Hi there, I'm assuming Peg Perego is Mamas and Papas as I'm in the UK. I had a twin aria which was great, really lightweight and easy to fold. The seats are smaller than the single version, and as far as I know from using one, you couldn't fit a baby car seat into it, as it would be too big.<br>  <br>  Lovely pushchair though. I even took it on the bus :)
cxNLOPHNaa	The links below have lists.<br>  <br>  Most kids will eat nuts, beans (such as the kid-favourite, baked beans) and raisins. I also noticed that while most kids won't eat liver, for some reason they will eat liverwurst. As for the clams... Clam chowder is an option, and while fried foods should be a treat, not a habit, you could also try fried clams. Most kids will eat those as well, just as kids that do not like fish will eat fish sticks.<br>  <br>  Turkey, chicken,and cereal are also very kid-popular. As are tuna sandwiches. Nuts are easy to sneak into baked goods and for eating out of hand, as a snack. You can also shake dried parsley flakes into virtually any food without affecting taste.|`|8oKazGVGaa	pork,beef,lamb some types or cerials, rice and pasta, beans, nuts dried fruits, turkey, chicken and eggs. i had that same problem as a child and i would only eat rice and chilli chicken so try all an see which one he likes|`|WK6UNCm5aa	Get him some cereal (not too sweet) or gummies.|`|bf977d45406286cec89ce77e17169069aa	Don't feel bad, some things are out of our control.<br>  <br>  If he's not eating much or healthy, give him pediasure to get the nutrients needed.  <br>  <br>  get vitamins with high amount of iron. look at food labels as well to see how much iron it has.  cereal and cereal bars is a good source.  Does he like chicken nuggets or tenders?<br>  <br>  I found an article, here's  a list:<br>  Iron Rich Foods<br>  Foods that are a good source of iron include:<br>  <br>      * liver<br>      * lean red meats, including beef, pork, lamb<br>      * seafood, such as oysters, clams, tuna, salmon, and shrimp, etc.<br>      * beans, including kidney, lima, navy, black, pinto, soy beans, and lentils<br>      * iron fortified whole grains, including cereals, breads, rice, and pasta<br>      * greens, including collard greens, kale, mustard greens, spinach, and turnip greens<br>      * tofu<br>      * vegetables, including broccoli, swiss chard, asparagus, parsley, watercress, brussel sprouts<br>      * chicken and turkey<br>      * blackstrap molasses<br>      * nuts<br>      * egg yolks<br>      * dried fruits, such as raisins, prunes, dates and apricots <br>  <br>  Iron Rich Baby Foods<br>  At first, unless your baby was premature or is already anemic, your baby will usually get all of the iron she needs from breast milk or an iron fortified infant formula. Once she is 4-6 months old though, she will likely begin to need some extra iron, which usually comes in the form of an iron fortified baby cereal. Later on, be sure to choose from a good variety of iron rich baby foods, which you can often find by comparing food labels and choosing foods with a high iron content. Or choose age appropriate iron rich foods when making your own baby food to make sure your infant gets enough iron.<br>  Iron Fortified Foods<br>  In addition to foods that naturally have a lot of iron in them, many foods are now fortified with iron or have iron added to them. This is good news, because many kids, especially younger ones don't usually like many of the best iron rich foods, such as liver, oysters, clams, and lentils.<br>  <br>  Check food labels to find foods fortified with iron, including:<br>  <br>      * Instant Oatmeal<br>      * Ready-to-eat Cereals, such as Total, Product 19, Raisin Bran<br>      * Grits<br>      * Iron Kids Bread<br>      * Carnation Instant Breakfast Mix<br>      * Pasta<br>      * Iron Fortified Toddler Formula, such as Enfamil Next Step or Similac 2 <br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  reward him if he eats something he doesn't really like, such as eat 10 raisins and you get a cookie, ha, if he likes oatmeal cookie then he gets some iron in there too without him knowing!  they now have yogurt rasins in either chocolate or vanilla, try that.

tLGbtmGsaa	I started to develop colostrum about a month before my twins were born.  I squeezed the nipple like I was taught how to express milk and eventually got a few drops.  But then I got told to stop because it could bring on early labour which I didn't want.  When my twins were born I was able to express colostrum within 24 hours by expressing every 2 or 3 hours.  I could not breastfeed my twins immediately because they were in the NICU with tubes attached to them.  By day 4 my milk came in.

He had to be dropper-fed formula for the first week while I attempted to nurse him and spent hours every day pumping.<br>  Three things are a sure trick to get your milk supply increased once your milk DOES come in.<br>  1: domperidone. In the US, this isn't approved by the FDA as a lactation aid (I'm in Canada so here it's no problem to come by it) It works to increase your milk supply and the only side effect is usually a mild headache. It's also used to treat reflux, this is actually it's original purpose. It doesn't cross the blood brain barrier and only a miniscule amount enters your breast milk. It does not effect your baby, in fact many babies with reflux take domperidone at much higher doses with no side effects. Although it's not approved by the FDA, you can still talk to your doctor about obtaining a prescription if that's the way you choose to go. I've been using it for about two weeks and I'm now at the point where my milk is TOO abundant for my son, resulting in him not getting enough hindmilk. It does the trick though it takes between 2 days and 2 weeks to really show improvement.<br>  2: fenugreek. This is an herb you can use to stimulate lactation that you can find as a capsule, a tea in health food stores, as well as in specialty yogurts. Because it's natural and doesn't require a prescription, this is the route lots of breastfeeding moms take.<br>  3: pump, pump, pump. When you're not nursing, spend at least 20 minutes every two hours pumping. You can either express by hand (though this may take longer until you get used to it) or with a manual or electric pump. Your body will interpret this as additional feedings and boost your milk supply to meet the demand. Plus, then you can store milk for later on!<br>  <br>  Milk production is on a 'demand' basis. The more often and more thoroughly your breasts are completely emptied, the more your brain will tell your body to make milk. The more frequent and efficient the emptying of the breasts, the fuller and faster your breasts will fill. Nurse as much as your baby will eat!
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Because a prenatal paternity procedure is high risk I would do a blood test or DNA test after the baby is born. If you use a condom every time and you are not lying to yourself or use about it then you should be fine. I would still get the test when the child is born though even if it is your boyfriends, you might wanna still have proof that it is in case he has doubts. Good luck sweetie!<br>  <br>  Oh and ignore sanctimonious *itches like NATASHA B. The whole point of this forum is to help people by giving advice, opinions and helpful answers. She didn't do any of the above just tried to spit in your face. She should be ashamed of herself for being wantonly callous and cruel when you are just seeking advice and help.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	It's probably your boyfriend's since you used condoms.  Are you going to keep up this lifestyle once your child is born?  I hope not.|`|OhJcq4uWaa	If you have always used condoms then you can be 99% sure it is your boyfriends...The paranoia is natural and may get worse thru out the pregnancy, the babies blood type will help determine the father after it is born.|`|IZTmipyaaa	most likely it's your boyfriend's baby.

"pelvic girdle pain" or "Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction"..... i suggest you ask your doc. it could be normal, but better to be safe than sorry.|`|FadwoZW5aa	I have had the same pains and thoughts! I'm die the 26th of March. I have read that when you go into labor.. You know it. Like the pain will shoot up the side of your stomach and you will have no question as to what it is. But yeah. I believe that the labor pains will be worse.. Because everyone tells me they hurt really bad.. Which makes you think.. What could possibly feel worse than this? I wish you the best of luck. Hopefully there will be a difference or were both in trouble. :0)

I think she should go to the doctor and get a blood test done to see. Those will be accurate. Or if she wants to keep testing at home, it wouldn't hurt...just more money. Good luck|`|qe3NQIwgaa	if she is stressed out it will screw with timing. so can other things.. so dont worry.
QBFbvO21aa	well if you took more than one test, and it siad negative...<br>  more than likely you aren't. how late is this period?<br>  if its more than 2 weeks then i'd go to the doctor or clinic and<br>  get a professional test done. Alot of places provide confedentiality so they wont tell your mom. but it honestly could be maybe just something you are pushing so far in your head that u actually beleive you start feeling the sysmptoms. alot of us are guilty of it.<br>  :] good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Your stomach doesn't "harden" in early pregnancy. Your uterus is still below your pubic bone so that is not pregnancy related. That can be caused by bloating or constipation. <br>  <br>  I would see a doctor at this point. You are two weeks late and still getting negatives so you shuold see a doctor. It's very possible it's not pregnancy related. <br>  <br>  I've thought "I'm pregnant for sure this time" before and wasn't. More than once actually. I was convinced. You may not be pregnant.|`|Ox81PJ9eaa	it could be a number of things honey. You could be pregnant, but the fact that you have had a period makes me think your not. it sounds like your freaking yourself out and stress can cause a late period. Also, if you are constantly thinking that you may be pregnant you can sometimes trick yourself into having some of the symptoms. Go and get a blood test or take another home pregnancy test. good luck|`|IvsvUzKuaa	if you're not getting your perios well then maybe you're pregnant and should take PT but if you are getting your period but not like the normal ones that you had, like just spotting or just for one day but not that heavy then I will advising you to go to OB and have the blood test. pregnancy signs does not always mean oyur pregnant sometimes it can also be an indicator that you'll be having your period.|`|XBTF1XvZaa	there is possibility for you being pregnant, because sometime is like that you will see your period while you are pregnant but the best thing is to tell your mum what is going on with try and make her understand how you feel, I think she is in the best position to help now before is to let for you. Try and have another test after two or three weeks to be sure of what you are suspecting. Best of luck|`|VSG70WcFaa	I had the same thing to and now i have a 4 month old boy and i also got pregnant around new years. <br>  my doctor told me that it's the hormonal count it builds up. and the only way to really know is a blood test. <br>  i didn't go to the doctor until i was 5 moths pregnant, i felt something moving and freaked... and now i am a happy mom :)
xue72D76aa	There is some research out there that suggests that smoking can affect fertility.<br>  <br>  In men, smoking can damage sperm (both quantity and quality).<br>  <br>  In women, "smoking may contribute to the destruction of eggs while they are in the ovaries, before they reach maturity. This results in a lower egg count. Smoking can negatively impact the fallopian tubes, and can even lead to disease of the fallopian tubes. Smoking can cause a woman’s eggs to be more prone to genetic problems, as well. Finally, some research has suggested that smoking may even negatively affect the ability of an embryo to implant in the uterus."<br>  <br>  The site I read suggests quitting smoking for at least 2 months before trying to conceive.  <br>  <br>  Of course, just because research suggests it is possible for smoking to affect fertility, that doesn't mean it happens in every case.  I am sure there are many many smokers who became pregnant.  But, if you are having issues with fertility, giving up smoking couldn't hurt your chances.<br>  <br>  EDIT - found some additional information:<br>  "Impact of cigarette smoking on reproduction in women:<br>  Virtually all scientific studies support the conclusion that smoking has an adverse impact on fertility. The prevalence of infertility is higher, and the time it takes to conceive is longer, in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Active smoking by either partner has adverse effects, and the impact of passive cigarette smoke exposure is only slightly smaller than for active smoking. Research indicates that cigarette smoking is harmful to a woman’s ovaries, and the degree of harm is dependent upon the amount and the period of time a woman smokes. Smoking appears to accelerate the loss of eggs and reproductive function and may advance the time of menopause by several years. Components in cigarette smoke have been shown to interfere with the ability of cells in the ovary to make estrogen and to cause a woman’s eggs (oocytes) to be more prone to genetic abnormalities. Smoking is strongly associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage and possibly ectopic pregnancy as well."|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It cannot effect pregnancy test results. Honestly I smoked for years and got pregnant on the first go with my daughter. It all depends on your body and the woman.|`|1hciyvKdaa	No, smoking is bad for you and bad for your baby, but it doesnt not alter pregnancy tests, and is not birth control|`|eV7rtxmuaa	There are several ways that smoking can affect female fertility. Smoking may affect the way that hormone estrogen is released. Some studies suggest that smoking reduces the amount of estrogen that a woman’s body produces. Smoking may cause a decrease of blood flow to the genital organs, which can cause dryness of the vagina and other sexual issues. Smoking may contribute to the destruction of eggs while they are in the ovaries, before they reach maturity. This results in a lower egg count. Smoking can negatively impact the fallopian tubes, and can even lead to disease of the fallopian tubes. Smoking can cause a woman’s eggs to be more prone to genetic problems, as well. Finally, some research has suggested that smoking may even negatively affect the ability of an embryo to implant in the uterus.|`|brkvK1Teaa	Probably not. Two things happen during smoking:  your body not getting enough oxygen and your body getting nicotine.  I don't think either of those things would affect you not getting pregnant.  However smoking can seriously damage your health over a long period of time.  If you are planning on getting pregnant, then you have to consider that you are seriously harming the fetus that will form inside you.  Your future baby could have serious health problems for life.  So if you want to get pregnant, then quit smoking.  Good luck.|`|IZTmipyaaa	I don't know, but i used to smoke for about 5 years and always had unprotected sex with my husband. I quit last year for my new year's resolution and five months later i got pregnant for the first time.  I think it depends on your body

Unlike other forms of contraception, this drug allows women to lower their risk of getting pregnant after they engage in unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  Putting aside your political stance or whatever ethical or moral qualms you have about either side of the argument, it is important to understand how Plan B works. Here are the facts:<br>  <br>  What is Emergency Contraception?<br>  Emergency contraception, sometimes called emergency birth control, is used to prevent a women who has had unprotected sex from becoming pregnant. It is not meant to be used routinely, but only in particular instances, such as when:<br>  <br>      * Birth control is forgotten entirely<br>      * A condom breaks or comes off<br>      * A woman forgets to take two or more birth control pills in a row<br>      * A woman is late in getting a birth control injection<br>      * A woman is forced to have unprotected sex <br>  <br>  It is important to realize that, like the birth control pill, patch and injections, emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV, herpes and chlamydia.<br>  <br>  Also emergency contraception only works before a woman becomes pregnant. In other words, it must be taken before the egg is fertilized for it to be effective.<br>  <br>  What is Plan B?<br>  Plan B is a type of emergency contraception approved by the FDA. It is prescribed as a packet of two pills containing synthetic progestin, a type of hormone naturally made in a woman's body.<br>  <br>  The drug works in the same way as a typical birth control pill in that it prevents the release of an egg from the ovary so fertilization cannot happen. If ovulation has already occurred, Plan B can also prevent the sperm from fertilizing the egg.<br>  <br>  Plan B is ineffective, however, once fertilization happens and the egg is implanted into the woman's uterus. That's why the first Plan B pill must be taken within the first 72 hours after having unprotected sex. The sooner Plan B is taken after intercourse, the more effective it is. Twelve hours later, a second pill is taken. According to the manufacturer's website, "When you take Plan B as directed, you reduce your risk for pregnancy by up to 89 percent."<br>  <br>  Is Plan B the Same as the Abortion Pill?<br>  No. You may have heard Plan B called the "morning after pill", but it is significantly different than the abortion pill, RU-486. That drug is used to end an existing pregnancy by causing the uterus to force out the fertilized egg. Plan B only prevents a pregnancy, it cannot end a pregnancy. And it shouldn't be taken by pregnant women for that purpose.<br>  <br>  However, if the drug is taken after fertilization of the egg, there is no evidence that Plan B will in any way effect the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Are There any Risks of Taking Plan B?<br>  The most common side effects of Plan B impact menstruation, causing early or late periods and lighter or heavier menstrual bleeding. Nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness and breast tenderness may also occur.<br>  <br>  If you vomit after taking Plan B, the National Women's Health Information Center advises you to call a doctor for advice.<br>  <br>  Also, there is still the risk that you may become pregnant even after taking Plan B. So, if you do not begin menstruation in three weeks, or have other symptoms of pregnancy, consider taking a pregnancy test or seeing a doctor.|`|30167669b952e11d46010997c237e93caa	Just take it... <br>  <br>  You bought it u may as well use it.<br>  <br>  Count to 3 and take it.<br>  <br>  it won't hurt you, but it might hurt if u fall pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|49b98532f1c2a607d94d38f43a315f96aa	Absolutely, do not wait any longer.  It does not work if you are already pregnant.  Pullout can get you pregnant because the clear fluid before he ejaculates contains sperm  Where there is sperm there can be fertilization and where there is fertilization there is pregnancy.  Do not wait until it is too late.  If you get pregnant or wait to long it will not work.|`|7edc74c0482676d0f9055d7c89ae8657aa	im not sure what plan b is but if your not close enough to be pregnat then why are you mating? thats what sex is! to make babys how about are you close enough to get a std from somebody because that tends to happen from sex too... sorry some advice if your not prgnant and well you must not care about std's aleast try this stuff they call "foam" all it is, is sprmicide it kills any sperm that enters the area it doesnt stink and its not uncomfy|`|e5c5efd7a4a56ea2dea8959e23b39503aa	Just a tip if you don't want to fall pregnant then stop having sex with him just pulling out use some form of contraceptive because all through sex a man is losing sperm I know this cause my bf used to pull out and that is how I fell pregnant with my daughter

(as labor progresses it will feel more like cramps that just keep getting worse and worse) like a bad period-this was the feeling right before i had my daughter, i felt like i was sick to my stomach from these.<br>  at first you can walk around with the mild discomfort but then it gets harder and harder to move, (while driving in a car every little bump hurt like hell). <br>  but this is based on my experience hope it helps good luck|`|a37dc179b9a04772f24bb7711a8e0702aa	this does certainly mean labor will begin soon and you shouldn't be worried sometimes you can be up to a week late with your first pregnancy.

If you have to ask yourself am i really in labor, then chances are you are not or you are so early in the stage of labor that it would be too soon to go to the hospital. If you are really worried though call your doctor asap, but believe me girlfriend you will most certainly know when you are in labor.|`|2a4eb611ed2a2cd9139853c737b70731aa	when contractions start, they are not always painful, it usually starts with your lower back pain, and in your pelvic area you feel a tightening and your belly will go hard, 2 centimeters dialted doesn't mean you are going to go into labor soon... i have seen women that were 30 weeks prego and 3 cm dialted until 40 weeks. But trust me when your contractions start you will know... look for signs of lower back pain, tightening in your pelvic area, stomach hardening and etc. When your contractions are 3-5 mins apart, getting stronger by the moment you should go into the hospital, if they send you home then they send you home but if your water breaks... definitely rush to the hospital asap

En el V Encuentro Feminista Latinoamericano y del Caribe celebrado en Argentina en 1990, la Asamblea del Movimiento Feminista Latinoamericano, tomando en cuenta que las complicaciones por el aborto inseguro y clandestino constituyen la primera causa de mortalidad de las mujeres en muchos de <br>  los paises de la región, decidió declarar el 28 de septiembre como el Dia por la Despenalizacion del Aborto. <br>  Desde entonces mas organizaciones de mujeres se han sumado a la campa?a de presion para demandar la despenalizacion del aborto en la region latinoamericana y caribenia. Hoy suman mas de 600. <br>  El 28 de septiembre recuerdan a los gobiernos latinoamericanos que seis mil mujeres se mueren al a?o debido a complicaciones de abortos. <br>  Mencionan que la cifra anual de abortos que se practican en Brasil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru y Republica Dominicana asciende a 2.8 millones y en toda la region la suma llega a mas de cuatro millones. <br>  Cada dia se realizan 55 mil abortos inseguros en el mundo, 95 por ciento en paises en vias de desarrollo, los cuales son responsables de una de cada ocho muertes maternas. Mundialmente por cada siete nacimientos se lleva a cabo un aborto inseguro. Se calcula que el aborto inducido -en forma clandestina y condiciones inseguras- es la causa de una de cada tres muertes maternas en la region y de aproximadamente 800 mil hospitalizaciones por a?o. <br>  Cada 28 de septiembre sirve a las feministas de la region para demandar el acceso de servicios de aborto seguro, lo cual podria prevenir entre el 20 y 25 por ciento del medio millon de muertes maternas que anualmente ocurren en los paises en vias de desarrollo. <br>  Recuerdan que en America Latina y el Caribe entre el 10 y 30 por ciento de las camas de los servicios de ginecologia y obstetricia estan ocupadas por mujeres con diagnostico de aborto incompleto.A nueve a?os de la declaracion del Dia Latinoamericano por la <br>  Despenalizacion del Aborto, de nueva cuenta las cifras y una peticion: recordar que cada numero alguna vez tuvo rostro de mujer. <br>  (Cifras provenientes de: Instituto Alan Guttmacher; Organizacion Mundial de la Salud, Fondo de Poblacion de las Naciones Unidas y Grupo de Informacion en Reproduccion Elegida) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nodo50.org/mujeresred/aborto-repem.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nodo50.org/mujeresred/aborto-...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  -Mi opinión: <br>  <br>  La decisión de aborto corresponde EXCLUSIVAMENTE A LAS MUJERES, y es cuestión de CONSCIENCIA. La despenalización del aborto NO SIGNIFICA PROMOCIóN DE éSTE. Cada mujer debe decirlo.  La despenalización del aborto es con el fin de que las mujeres que que decidan practicárselo sea por derecho de decisión y si está legalizado el Estado la proteja de malas prácticas seudo-médicas y pueda morir.  <br>  <br>  Aquí no se trata de decidir por otras si debe hacerlo o no, NO ES NUESTRO CUERPO, cada una de acuerdo a su consciencia deberá hacerlo.<br>  <br>  Ejemplos: <br>  -El tabaco -que causa una dificil adicción, pues causa muerte- lo venden en mil presentaciones en cualquier tiendita, pero es cuestión de CONSCIENCIA y decisión de cada uno, comprarlo y consumirlo, aún cuando se esté bien informado de los da?os que puede causar.<br>  <br>  -En cada farmacia venden condones -y aunque según los católicos su uso sea pecado- es cuestión de consciencia usasrlos o no, para prevenir enfermedades-embarazos indeseados- y MUERTE.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|c373026c7fbb584e93abb3e3409ae922aa	No estoy ni a favor ni en contra del aborto. Estoy a favor de que las mujeres tomen su decisión con respecto a sus cuerpo. Me imagino que no lo hacen o harán por matar a un ser humano (antes de14 semanas no lo es todavía, comprobado) La mayoría de las mujeres que han pasado por ese trance quedan da?adas fuertemente y por cierto que al corresponsable (hombre si así se le puede adjetivar) no le pasa nada ni tampoco le preocupa nada.

Estos ni?os serán los próximos sicarios, malandros, asesinos y violadores de nuestra sociedad, fueron rechazados desde peque?os, cada que la madre los ve, recuerda esos momentos amargos que le hizo vivir y por eso no lo quiso como debia. <br>  Por eso antes de hacerles un mal peor a ellos o a la sociedad, la madre debe tener el derecho de decidir a cerca de su vida, de su cuerpo. ?O es que todos los que estan en contra le van a ayudar a criarlo y a superar los traumas que ese embarazo le pueda provocar?|`|06YuBqP0aa	Estoy en contra del aborto,ya que es un asesinato.Hay muchas formas para evitar tener hijos y al alcance de todos .Nadie pide que lo traigan al mundo,no es justo matar a un ser humano ,ya que desde el primer día es una célula viva ,nadie tiene derecho a quitarle la vida a nadie y muchos menos los padres a sus hijos.Esto del aborto es un crimen espantoso ,te pican en pedacitos a los fetos y después lo sacan,sabrá DIOS lo que sufren, esto va encontra de DIOS y de toda buena persona .NO AL ABORTO!!!!!!!!|`|2cf6af50f9afa8fc401b402311007fa3aa	En contra, of course!<br>  Pienso que aquello a lo que se le impide crecer es un ser humano en potencia, y yo no puedo elejir por su vida.<br>  <br>  Soy libre, pero hasta cierto grado, porque no se es libre 100% en la vida.

Este cambio, en actitud de antes de abortar, desea solamente deshacerse de un problema, y después del aborto, sentir que, te han quitado algo suyo es muy repentino, como lo es el shock o trauma físico, que el cuerpo experimenta cuando cambia de un estado de embarazo a un estado de no embarazo en un período de unos quince minutos. La mujer misma, no puede entender este cambio psicológico en ella; por lo regular, el dolor físico después de un aborto es tanto, que la mujer rechaza el dolor psicológico que ella comienza a sentir. Este es el comienzo de lo que ahora llamamos el síndrome post-aborto; el rechazo del dolor y por consecuencia el rechazo de la realidad del aborto es lo que llamamos negación, y parala mayoría de mujeres, aquí es donde comienza la negación, que puede experimentar por meses o más común por a?os después de su aborto. Cuando una mujer se da cuenta que fué su ni?o que se murió, en el aborto, se siente muy culpable.

Ademas eso seria si salieran embarazadas y si la contajian de algo ?que vamos a querer que despenalizen despues?.  <br>  <br>  pero por supuesto que estoy en contra; que se atengan a las consecuencia de tener relaciones sin protección y con cualquiera.

0948bd5a88aa2c09d8903792496cd05aaa	The fact that you aren't communicating about missing his son is going to add extra stress and that stress can be preventing you from conceiving.  You need to make him sit down and talk about or at least voice your feelings if he isn't ready to deal with it.  The hard part for you may end up being that it isn't in your realm to change anything.  Ultimately the issue is between him and his ex.  If you're concerned that there might be something physically stopping you from getting pregnant talk to your gynaecologist or family doctor.  As a alternative there is adoption or if it's your need to be with children you could see about volunteering to work with young children.  Try to relax and good luck,|`|79428e8783564e94408813d9dc891931aa	i agree with the stress and also i would call my doc and set appt and discuss my concerns with him having a child and tryng and your just wanting to make sure everything is fine.. and then take it from there.. but i would difft. talk to you hubby about his son and try to ez the pain i'm sure he's going through

I asked my hairdresser and she said it was something to do with the hormones and recommended a product for me....I forget the name of it, but if you talk to your hairdresser, they should be able to tell you the name of the product, they may actually have it in stock.  I also asked my Dr about it and he did a thyroid test which came back negative, to this he said "Well, not sure what is the cause, but if it doesn't go away in a few months, come back and see me"  HELPFUL!!

Did you take you prenatal vitamins?|`|cc3f085f36ba86b52b8c60b7a8876b4aaa	its because of the hormones i believe but go and see a doctor to make sure|`|AA11226053	Yes it can be normal it is usually from hormones, however 6 months seems to be too long.  Hair falling out is a sign of a thyroid disorder also, and for some reason many women develop that problem after pregnancy.  See your family doctor.
447342b1c68256e4481fd6baf750c38daa	I think you should leave it alone for now. She's too young and it probably bothers you more than anyone else. I would wait until/if she mentions it on her own.|`|63a7abd045cc49ddeb43e136e6b00d67aa	I don't think you could make it worse by leaving it alone. You couldn't possibly make sure that your child would sit still while you try to trim it. I would think by the time she's 3 she might be able to sit really still. Better yet, ask the pediatrician to do it when you're in the office. They do stuff like that, believe it or not.|`|41557171b2bed12aaa3d03e792712ab6aa	I would wait until later to worry about it.|`|054ee24caecaefc4efe57162e5b1d2dfaa	I would leave it alone until she's older and old enough till it makes a difference in her life and until she can make a decision if it bothers her or not.<br>  <br>  However even though I don't advise it, if you were to remove the hair, the safest way without any pain would be to simply shave it.|`|AA11315346	shave it!|`|bf550112dc9e1b94bc58d351a2b7571baa	it's called a unibrow<br>  and no leave it alone|`|AA11729352	My daughter has one as well and she is 4 and I think it is beautiful.

2425ccca62ec6f1cbebe3dcb945bc4c3aa	Well when I was a kid, my mother's best friend had her daughters nine months and eight days apart, so it can happen.  She did not have any problems with either pregnancy, she did say that the sex was painful though, so it is not a wise idea and she did have an infection do to it, but the infection was easily taken care of. So if you are pregnant that soon I am sorry.  If it is a friend I am still sorry, she is probably on major hormone overload.|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	Well you would be pregnant again.

Durning that time it's very easy to get pregnant, plus you're not on birth control yet.  And if your partner didn't use any pertection when you had sex then you're more than likely pregnant AGAIN.|`|5b0ee20e6ce7aff5b80e7c3eca5d30bfaa	well thats highly impossible but if that does happen you need to go see your doctor. Sometimes If you do take a preg. test after the baby was born it can come back positive because your hormones havent had time to change and get back to normal yet. Dont sweat it.|`|a59a766b8ccec076024c56dc7726b577aa	You will have another baby...  My sis have 2  10 months apart it was ok
7a74eb7a287d923fc95861a431f7904caa	just one of the many joys of being pregnant...  ha    whatever you, do limit your water intake to stop the frequent bathroom breaks.  it won't help,and you will just dehydrate yourself.  and it is pretty normal to feel like you really need to go, and then nothing happens.  i am like that a lot with bowel movements, but it is not constipation for me.  i think it is just because the baby will move a certain way and push on everything, making it feel like i have to go, and then by the time i get to the bathroom she has moved again,and the feeling is gone.  <br>  <br>  there is nothing you can really do about the frequent urination, but if you are constipated you can talk to your OB, and she may recommend a stool softener.  try to also up your fiber intake.  there are some great breakfast cereals like Fiber One or Cracklin Oat Bran that actually taste good, and can really help get things going.<br>  <br>  and be sure not to strain on the toilet, as pregnant women are very prone to hemorrhoids to begin with.  and you do not want hemorrhoids on top of everything else pregnancy throws at you!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA11773063	Hmmm? well i have a had a very similar story. I was at my mates house and i was trying to sleep... but i went about 15-25 (no joke) times this was very frustrating i went to bed at 11.30 and i fell asleep at 2.45. this annoyed me... my advice would be... try and ignore it and you wont have to go to the toilet so often|`|acdb9c257959ffd4b52224c6ddc0f500aa	Maybe you could get a prenatal vitamin that isn't so high in iron...

IgoybtTtaa	Because it feels good! It's a comfort thing. She associates your hair with you - the softness, the slippery cool feeling over her face, and as someone else said, the scent. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about it! Enjoy it!

Once babies start being able to reach and grab things, they will grab at everything they can reach, and everything they can grab goes into the mouth.

5f08a3478b1e05bf91118318ea104956aa	Porque el bb mientras esta en nuestro útero lleno de liquido amniótico no respira mediante el sistema respiratorio sino que lo hace a través del cordón umbilical, ( también mediante este se alimenta) ... recién cuando nace se pone en funcionamiento el sistema respiratorio (sus pulmones).|`|4381f7176c47d634b6d69f726e735eeaaa	dentro del vientre, no usan los pulmones, sacan el oxigeno del cordon umbilical ,osea de la sangre de la madre,<br>  ,por eso es tan importante que lloren al nacer, para que se llenen sus pulmones de aire y empiecen a respirar ??<br>  si los metes bajo el agua una vez nacidos, unos segundos no pasa nada, (por que aguantan la respiracion ) pero mas tiempo es obvio que se ahogan.|`|0p7hp7z9aa	La verdad es que es impresionante|`|8772610b9c29b57a40662e6c7a369ddfaa	el liquido amniotico tiene mucha utilidad para el bb, pero en realidad no lo respira. El bb respira mediante el cordon ubilical. Salu2!|`|PlzhEBS8aa	A manera de información te cuento que el líquido Amniotico se forma en la cuarta semana de embarazo, el embrión ya ha anidado en las paredes del útero y se empieza a formar la cavidad amniótica, la cual se irá llenando de líquido. <br>  <br>  Lo mantiene calentito, a la temperatura de tu organismo, ayuda a desarrollar los pulmones e incluso le alimenta, ya que cada traguito del líquido amniótico le proporciona a tu bebé iones y proteínas.<br>  <br>  Ese líquido le da al bebe todo lo que necesita, pero cuando nace, tu ves que a los ni?os se les debe inducir para que lloren? bien sea con una palmadita o poniendolos boca a abajo, en fin, esto con la intensión que sus pulmones se llenen de aire y comiencen a funcionar, pues hasta ese momento (el nacimiento) el bebe no los habia utilizado, no habia comenzado a respirar por la nariz.|`|jm6bt1slaa	Lo que pasa es que el feto no respira por la nariz cuando esta dentro de la madre.... se alimenta por el cordon humbilical....es impresionante pero no necesita respirara.... es por eso que antes cuando los bebes nacian se les daba una nalgada para estimular sus pulmones y que jalaran aire y empezaran a respirar....|`|6rPBDK29aa	mira tenemos un taponcito en la traquea llamado glotis cuando el bebe esta en el liquido de tu pancita la glotis esta tapada y no permite que los a los pulmones les pase  liquido,pero cuando nacemos esa glandula se destapa para q los pulmones trabajen y es por eso q si pueden ahogarse.<br>  el hipo es una peque?a idea de lo q es la glotis|`|AIUonDQkaa	Hola.yo estoy esperando mi bebe para mayo y te aseguro que es la pregunta mas complicada que he oído.Tienes mucha razón.|`|QYAreeHyaa	estando el feto en el vientre este no respira, recibe el oxigeno que necesita por la sangre de la madre atravez del cordon unvilical, el a gua es agua y el liquido amniotico tiene otros compuestos|`|VSyVNiW1aa	Poque los bebés cuando están dentro de la madre no utilizan sus pulmones; pero mira que ahora se ha puesto muy de "moda" los nacimientos bajo el agua, lo has escuchado? no son los hospitales y esas salas de parto sino una "piscina" con agua a  temperatura igual a la que tiene el bebé dentro de su  madre. Cuando él sale lo dejan en el agua y no se ahoga, impresionante, además de que dicen es un método natural y favorable tanto para el bebé como para la madre.|`|W0di3nxpaa	como te han explicado ,mis compa?eros el bebe en el feto no respira todo lo hace a través de la madre, y cuando nace esa  "función" desaparece.<br>  lo que esta comprobado es que aun recién nacido si lo metes en el agua puede sumergirse sin ningún problema sin respirar ( puede estar unos segundos) porque piensan que aun siguen en el feto.<br>  un saludo!!!|`|ZjPPKvByaa	Querida Flaquis, perdona que te diga que estás en un craso error, si a un recién nacido le dejas en un ba?o de agua con la temperatura constante de unos 37 grados C, para que no muera por enfriamiento, verás como es capaz de nadar y buscar por sí mismo el oxígeno que necesita en sus pulmones subiendo a la superficie y aspirando aire. Mientras está en el líquido amniótico sus pulmones están atrofiados y recibe el oxígeno a través del cordón umbilical. Al nacer sus pulmones deben activarse de ahí que se les ponga boca abajo y se les golpee las nalgas para que el diafragma empuje a los pulmones y se abran adquiriendo aire a través del llanto y por lo tanto la boca.<br>  Te podría hablar largo y tendido del tema pero no hay más espacio. UN beso de tu amigo, Carlos.|`|pjA5pv2baa	Muy simple corazon dentro de la panza el feto no necesita respirar todo se lo provee la placenta, la alimentacion, el oxigeno, inclusive tiene la funcion de li`mpiar los desechos que hace el feto a sierta madurez.....y cuando nace sus pulmones estan listos para empesar su funcion por eso hay posibilidades de que si no lo sacas pronto se ahoge cuidate y cuida a tu angelito y recuerda ante todo seguiridad..<br>  <br>  suerte|`|yFcReZfFaa	lo que han respondido es cierto asi que BYE

Claro que las que tienen dinero para hacerlo quizás se sienten un poco menos preocupadas, no lo sé.<br>  Además, el feto de 12 a 14 semanas de gestación (3 meses) no tiene la capacidad biológica de pensar, ni de tener emociones, vamos, ni siquiera de sentir dolor.<br>  Si te opones al aborto, estás en tu derecho, y si no lo piensas hacer nunca, qué bueno, pero esos argumentos sentimentales son un poco "televisos", ?no crees?|`|jm6bt1slaa	Ya la he leido es muy buena.... pero sabes que... como mujer, cuando te encuentras atrapada en una sitiacion asi tu manera de ver las cosas cambia.... nunca sabes como vas a reaccionar....

uHiyNiEyaa	Abruptio placentae is a premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. It can occur in three different degrees of severity, from mild to severe, with the least being a small separation and the worst being a total separation. It can cause abdominal pain and bleeding and threaten the life of mother and baby. Placenta previa is when the placenta either partially or totally covers the cervix at the base of the uterus. If the mother's cervix begins to dialate, there could be severe bleeding and it could be dangerous to mother and baby, so these babies are usually delivered by c-section. Both of these conditions would be visible on ultrasound as well.|`|zk0Led9iaa	abruptio placenta is when the placenta releases from the uterus prematurely. It causes bleeding and is dangerous. It is usually caused by some sort of trauma to the mother: falling, car wreck, etc.<br>  <a href="http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/000901.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/000901.h...</a><br>  <br>  placenta previa. My sister had this. It's very dangerous. The placenta (instead of migrating to the side of the uterus) covers the cervix (the exit for the baby) if you start to go into labor, then the placenta leaves first and leaves no way for the baby to breathe and the mother can hemorrhage to death. My sister woke in the middle of the night to heavy bleeding and hemorrhaging. This is usually diagnosed by ultrasound, but her doctors didn't do an ultrasound (idiots!)<br>  <a href="http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/000900.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/ency/article/000900.h...</a>|`|6abd914fedbae285e5e079d65459142aaa	The 1st is when the placenta partially or fully separates from the uterine wall, the 2nd is when the placenta partially or fully covers the cervical opening of the uterus

There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges surgery for foreigners in India. They are called the Fly2india4health Consultants. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. I have also read that they arrange financing for international patients, as all surgery is not covered by insurance or by the stinking NHS.<br>  <br>  They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. The cost savings are incredible. As a doctor I personally believe that your surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of Healthcare available here is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star. <br>  <br>  My cousin got her IVF (in vitro fertilization) treatment; IUI surgery done there and she is more than very happy with the results. She is all praise for Fly2india4health Consultants. She paid just 20% of the cost what she was quoted in USA and it was like a wonderful vacation for her.

Wine tasting will not affect the test like that.  I was in the Napa Valley yesterday!  Went up and through to Windsor and hit the beach.  :)<br>  <br>  Ept does not have false positives so the hormone is in tact but whether or not you have a true pregnancy is debatable.  Wait a couple days and try again.  Or go directly to your doctor and get a blood test.  You will know right away then... after they run it anyway.  Most accurate!  And the results line is typically fainter in super early pregnancy... I would know, happened to me twice!|`|El7Z8W1Kaa	Your best bet would be to go to your doctor and be tested there.  While those tests can be highly accurate, there are always factors that can effect them.  Alcohol being one of them.  All those pregnancy test are is a reactivity test.  Basically if a certain enzyme or hormone is present, they change color indicating that the enzyme is present.  In this case, it is an enzyme that is primarily found in pregnancy cases.  A doctor's office tests urine for specifics which makes it much more accurate.|`|PxmwzEZFaa	go to a free clinic or a doc they have better tests<br>                                       hope this helps|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You are not supposed to read a pregnancy test after 10 minutes, because most tests that look negative will eventually get an "evaporation line" that makes it look positive.<br>  <br>  Wine tasting would not affect it.

If your period doesn't come for 2 weeks and you keep testing negative, make an appointment with your doc and get a blood test.
DwQwGKZAaa	Make sure you are testing first thing in the morning when the hcg levels would be the strongest in your urine.  I myself never tested positive with a urine test and I was four months pregnant with twins.  I always have to have a blood pregnancy (three pregnancies never a positive urine test) test so perhaps you should talk to your doctor about having a blood test versus a urine test done.  The tests typically say the first day of your missed period but I have doubts as to them being that sensitive.  And if you are not that regular it is difficult to discern the first day of a missed period.|`|AA11061115	Is that Esperanto or that new Hawaiian language?To answer your question-most of those tests are old,that will alter the result. Make sure you look at the date showing when it was made-get 5 tests.|`|jd4MzIYtaa	i wouldnt wait two weeks id wait one then retest, i was in your boat last month i took a test 6 days late and it was negative then i started the next day, stress overpowers your body sometimes, all the emotions cause delay especially when trying to concieve, just relax and take a test friday at the doctors and if its negative and you still dont recieve it try next week and always use morning urine..hope i helped!|`|00ecYwF6aa	hi.I have the same problam as urs.Even im 5 days late and havent tested yet fearing it comes out negative.As much as ive read on the net the safe peiod for testing should be after a week from the day u missed ur periods.Thts wht is said it gives u pretty much an accurate result.Even if i dont start my mensus till  7 days im gonna test.<br>   Try testing in a day or two i hope it helps.Goodluck n i hope it turns out the way u want.|`|NkiGYmiCaa	hey, a pregnancy test, in the instructions will tell you, to test the day of your first period or after. but i have a friend who never got a positive pregnancy test, and by the time they doctors tested her she was 12 weeks<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|x9j6R9lmaa	I'm in the same boat. I'm 5 days late and waiting. I have taken 2 tests, negative. I suggest not to test till a week late, because it does get frustrating seeing neg. results. But even then it may not  show. I'm tempted to get a bloodtest, but I'm not sure how soon that would detect a pregnancy. Keep us updated with the results!
v1jnIsHnaa	Well, sometimes people are preg. and have neg. tests until a ways into there preg.  I guess I'd wait and see what happens.  If your having sex every night, that could def. be the reason for all that white discharge (what goes up, must come down).  But good luck and just wait and see!!!|`|NkiGYmiCaa	well, it sounds like you are pregnant,<br>  i would wait another week and test, its all you can do as of now, my friend who is 13 weeks never got a positive hpt, she had to go to the doctor for blood work and thats how they found out she was pregnant<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|cHHb94I7aa	YOUR PERIOD IS COMING SOON! YOU ARE NOT PREGGO GET OVER IT GIRL
MLiefnU9aa	Your in the dreaded 2 week wait, that so many of us have gone through.  I suggest not testing early.  You can drive yourself crazy peeing on sticks and waste a lot of money doing so.  There is also a chance of getting a positive test early only for it to be a chemical pregnancy and getting your period. You then have a heartbreak that you would not have known about.   Hold off until your 1 day late.    I suggest you visit babycenter.com, go to the 2008 birth boards and find the board that your baby would be due.  There are lots of women in their 2 week wait also. <br>  <br>  Best of luck and baby dust.|`|4a5ebb04e884364da68746ae33611f30aa	dunno if you can be pregnant, but if you had unprotected sex, well, DUH you "can" possibly be pregnant :)<br>  <br>  You can either wait a week and get a blood test  OR<br>  <br>  Wait until you miss your period (which to me is a better idea) and test yourself.

9b7094bb6caaebf6f6e1e7d1dc3e1c36aa	How sad. I was watching Montel today (shut up!) and the subject was "Daycare Nightmares" It was talking about all these horrible things that have happened to children while in Day care. This one woman through this 2 year old girl across the room into a playpen. She said that the little girl laid there for about 5 mins with one eye shut unconcious. She had to have brain surgery and half of her brain is dead. <br>  <br>  It's so horrible. How can someone do this to a child. And someone who is supposed to be responsible|`|8076b945cafebd634cc12fdea0a9f47faa	i visited her site a few times. A girl that was close friends with her put something up asking people to pray for this child actually got reported! Can you believe that? I feel so terrible for this family and really can not believe that that B*TCH got out on a bail that small! She attempted to murder this child! I signed a petition to put her back in jail. It was at i petition.com<br>  I do hope that this poor little guy gets better and can lead a normal life as much as he can.

PEjiF0uOaa	hi hun. that's whats EXACTLY happening to me RIGHT now!! lol. but saying that i haven't missed my period YET! by cycle is irregular so its hard for me to find out when I'm ovulating so I'm going to by the kit. i hope it doesn't come and i hope yours doesn't come either. you can go to the doctors and get a blood test or just wait a few more days or a week to test again.(i know how you feel and how frustrating it is) I'm just going to wait to see if mine comes fingers crossed both of ours DONT come. good luck and e-mail me and let me know how things go please thanks hun good luck x|`|15fbdd1ddde8d18efa4186d8cc0bfcb5aa	go to the dr for bloodtest goodluck
c3c4c27ec88e366dbdf39ae257e73554aa	I know how you feel.<br>  <br>  I'm 17 and I have a 14 year old brother.<br>  <br>  He has no respect at all. He talks to everyone like sh*t. I hate him for it. He gets whatever he wants. My mum will drive him everywhere and he just comes home from school (he's always in trouble) and watches tv till late. <br>  <br>  My parents seperated when I was 3 and my old step dad was abusive, alcoholic and a gambling addict. <br>  <br>  Maybe your brother needs a positive male roll model. If you've got a grandfather or an uncle who could be there for him.<br>  <br>  Try and talk to your mum. I know it's not easy and she'll just defend him (mine did) let her know that he has no right to talk to her like that.<br>  <br>  Also try and get him to go to a doctor, they may be able to give him something. This is also maybe this way of dealing with the death of your father. He may need counselling.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to say but this partly just a normal stage, but he needs to know he has to respect others before they'll respect him.|`|mN5xsHe9aa	wow he needs a male infulence in his life, sorry to hear about ur father. if u guys were my neighbors, i  would whoop  em in to shape in  no time<br>  <br>  tell ur mom to take away all his things, what will really scare em nex time he touches your mom CALL THE cops on his little butt, they will settle em|`|23d92c495de9d3c0724b100d22f2a655aa	baby's are NOT born spoiled , their made.<br>  about time someone starts reading and following directions on proper parenting..... it's not natural for us to all know these techniques, most of us should be trained so not to create monster children.|`|5zSqeugCaa	I would take him, tie him down, and shove some liquid soap in his mouth, and tell him if he isn't nice, that you will, and can do it again.  About the pushing and shoving, that is physical abuse, and he can go to jail for that, and he may even be tried as an adult, depending on the local laws in your state(if in the USA).  So sorry to hear about your father.  But try to get him to stop swearing, and maybe when he's asleep take some of the computer stuff, so that he can't go on it, and make him earn it back.|`|891ff91323551bd2f4b87c9a96eadf7baa	No, he prolly is spoiled rotten, and should be sent to boot camp.

She needs to feel empowered so maybe finding a way to tell her?|`|NqVjThp9aa	Don't make it sound like a hopeless situation. IT'S NOT! There are many things you can do, and you can get your mother in on it too. First, whenever your brother curses or hit your mother, CALL THE POLICE. This is obviously verbal/physical abuse, and your mother should not be taking it. Second, take him to counselling, like to see a psychiatrist, obviously since your father's death, there wasn't anyone there to discipline the boy since your mother was working all the time. If he has ADHD, take him to a facillity so that they can diagnose it and give him pills. It might make him do better in school. <br>  <br>  If none of these options work, then you'll have to send him to bootcamp, or military school of some sorts. He needs to change. I know lots of teens rebel, but this sounds like an extreme situation. I have a little brother, and yes he's spoiled, but he does listen to us sometimes. I hope your brother will be the same one day. He better appreciate the life your mother gave him: clothes to cloth his back, food to fill his tummy and games to entertain himself. There are deprived children out there, and he must realize how good he has it.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't change, let's hope he ends up as a hobo in the near future. ;) <br>  <br>  I don't think you deserve this either! >=[<br>  <br>  Best of luck too you!!|`|S4wYEPqoaa	Well, if it were my kid, not only would I not buy him all that crap that he asked for, I'd start showing him from an early age who the boss really is.

Smack 'em every once in a while. Hell, smack 'em all the time. That's what they really need, not computers and games.|`|TQ5liuLsaa	the best thing for your mom to do is take away his crap!she won't have to yell anymore,he'll stomp around and cry,but oh well.sounds like he's been very spoiled because of your fathers death,nows wake up time.he needs to appreciate what your mother does and what she goes through everyday also.if he hits her,she should call juvenile detention.there's no excuse for that.but if your mom's not strong enough,things will never change and he'll wind up in jail,very soon.|`|WIJuvn2Laa	he should go to juvenile.immm so sorry about that happening:).god bless you and your mom:).|`|YFCPVG0vaa	either you and your mom needs to beat the hell out of that boy or send him to another relatives. i understand you completely i have siblings like that too. dont give him what he wants and fight back. and you have to tell your mom that if he hits her agian she needs to take action even if that mean beating the hell out him. obviously your mom works to hard. i cant stand it when i hear stories like this it makes me so sad how kids can treat there parents like this. i am fifteen i have never ever cussed at my mom i have never hit my mom and thats why she says that i am her angle out of all her children. i had to deal with this with my mom getting hit by my brothers and when my mom finally went to blows with them and won they slowed down alot. all you have to know is that is your bro love him forever but remember the all the things he has said and did in the future. dont be afraid to help him when he needs help but remember to never give those type of people an inch cause they take a mile. good luck to u and ur mom and some to ur brother.|`|spXMbyYLaa	wow..i see your brother is unruly..hmm..maybe when he is at school take ALL his stuff away and take it somewhere where he cant get it like a friends house..or maybe try sending him to some kind of camp.you know..like boot camp or something to let him learn disaplan.no one should ever hit there mother! ecscapply since your dads death. i hope this helps and i hope he stops soon!

san7VvNyaa	Fetuses are only human!  Just like us, they have 'up' days and they have 'down' days!  Babies are usually active the most between 24 and 28 weeks.  Don't be tempted to compare your baby movement notes with other pregnant mothers!  Research suggest that from the 28th week on....Although you can do this anytime you start feeling the baby move....that it may be a good idea to do a 'movement test' twice a day!  Once in the morning when movement is sparser and once in the active evening hours.  Your practitioner may recommend a test or you can try this one....check the clock and start counting.  Count movements of any kind (kicks, flutters, swishes, rolls).  Stop counting when you reach ten, and note the time.  Often, you will feel ten movements within ten minutes or so.  Sometimes it may take a little longer!  If you haven't counted ten movements by the end of the hour, have some milk or a snack; then lie down, relax and continue counting.  If two hours go by and still not ten movements, you need to call your practitioner without delay.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I'll be praying for you and a continued healthy and happy pregnancy!<br>  <br>  Due in 12 days with second son!|`|AA10342648	Oh girl i am in the same boat!! lol i had actually called my ob nurse becuase i was sick to my stomach too!! and my baby had been moving everyday since i was 19 weeks curently 22 weeks!! and what they told me it's that not to worry about it's perfectly normal!!! the baby has some down times so it can be very active some days and other days not!!! but they did tell me if you don't feel anything and i mean nothing for three straight days then you should go to the hospital asap!!! you know us being mothers we tend to worry but just relax your baby may just be having a lazy day!! lol i hope this helped ;-)|`|G8Lclgomaa	Hey hon, <br>  <br>   I'm 31 weeks, and my lil one still does this., He'll be super super active for days, then for like 3-4 not much at all.

Anything less, call the doctor.<br>  <br>  And of course if you feel 10 movements in less than an hour, you can stop counting and you're fine.|`|lKEBesbuaa	i would contact doctor just to be safe. you dont want to take any chances with this. even if its nothing its better to be safe than sorry.
LqfbSgWYaa	Hola compadre<br>  Es obvio que se siente suplantado y piensa que van a querer mas al nuevo miembro de la familia que a el, trata de que les ayude a ti y a tu esposa en cosas que tengan que ver con el bebe, como que el lleve el biberon cuando se lo van a dar y entre los tres hacerlo, que el pase el shampoo cuando ba?en al bebé nuevo, que le canten una canción los tres juntos, en fin trata de integrarlo con el nuevo bebé y compartan con el casi todo, haganlo juntos los 4 para que el se sienta útil<br>  Quiere llamar la atención y también verás como un retroceso en el porque se sentirá bebé otra ves, no hagas mucho caso, eso pasará y trata de engrandecerlo y decirle que es un ni?o grande y que puede hacer muchisimas cosas como ayudar con el bebe, ser aplicado y obediente etc etc etc<br>  veras como pronto pasa<br>  Se está adaptando al cambio y es normal, en vez de cuestionarlo o reprenderlo ayudenlo a hacerlo y el proceso será muy rápido<br>  <br>

pasó, el estaba solito tenía todas las atenciones y cuando me separe lo pasó mal, pero cuando restablecí mi vida con otra persona que tenia un hijo mayor que el mio, se puso muy celoso, y además fue mutuo por las dos partes...<br>  Lo que tenéis que tener en cuenta es en no dejarle de mimar, que vea que tener un hermanito es bonito, que el lo cuidara cuando sea grande y cosas así, pero que no se sienta desplazado, ni reemplazado por su hermanito por que le podría coger manía, a mi fue lo que me aconsejaron varios psicólogos con los que consulte las reacciones de mi hijo...<br>  No es fácil

cambios importante necesitan de un proceso de acomodación. son muchas las sensaciones que experimentaran igual que nosotros como nuevos papas. en mi humilde opinión no creo que deban preguntarle tanto como se siente pues  así se le hace más incapie en los sentimientos que pueda estar experimentando. creo que hay que alabar mucho todo lo bien que hace tu hijo, lo importante que es su ayuda, el

a ser el " mayor ".<br>  <br>  Adoptando el papel de hermano mayor protegerá a su hermanito y poco a poco aprenderá  que compartir tiene su lado bueno.<br>  <br>  No te preocupes en exceso , es un

Rzztwnlyaa	hi i was on the depo for the same amount of tI'me and im sorry to say this but it took me 2 1/2 years to conceive it was very stressful and exhausting at the same time but my advice to you is not to think that you want a baby just have pure fun and pleasurable sex and enjoy being with your partner cause if you think about it all the time it don't happen cause your stressed but i can give you some advice that the doctor gave me <br>  <br>  1st tell your partner to wear boxer shorts so his bits are free to hang an be loose this helps with not suffocating the ball sacks<br>  <br>  2nd after sex lay with a pillow under your bum for 1/2 hour this helps with the sperm travel<br>  <br>  3rd just enjoy having sex and don't even think your there to make a baby your there to enjoy your time with your partner <br>  <br>  i did all this and after the 2 yrs 3 months i found out i was pregnant with my 1st child and i was over the moon cause i forgot all about it and it was a huge surprise to see the test a + and not a - but good luck and don't give up hope it will happen just be patience and relax and it will eventually happen heaps of  BABY DUST YOUR WAY|`|ILbCO69Waa	im on depo, have been 4 5 yrs, i was told it can take about year 2 get back 2 normal|`|eVamlpWnaa	17 months and counting honey.

I'm sure it varies for each person.|`|xbv3yCoWaa	It took my body about three months to get back to normal and then it was about 5 months after I stopped the shot that I found out I was pregnant but I also think it happend so fast because I only had 2 of the shots, then stopped taking them if you have had more then it may take a little longer. I do not like the effects of the depo and encourage an alternate b.c. method when possible, best wishes and take care!!!!

75oU12V3aa	I have also got irregular periods. All pregnancy tests only pick up a pregnancy on at least day 28 of your cycle. It is agonizing to wait till then, but it is devastating when it comes out negative. You could wait till, say, Monday and then go have a blood test. A urine test may also pick it up by then. Save yourself all the pain of going through a test when it's too early to pick it up!<br>  Good luck, I really hope it goes well with your endeavors!!! !!!|`|O3JpqxW2aa	I think that maybe it is your boyfriend.

U7WQWgMmaa	Bueno la primera vez duele mucho mucho mucho... y es normal que cueste que entre. Yo os recomiendo que useis algo como baselina o unos tubitos que venden ahora con un liquido que hace que se deslice mejor y así entrará con más facilidad... probad sino en el agua... Además ella debe estar muy muy excitada para que le duela menos, por lo que te recomiendo que muerdas suavemente sus pezones y juegues con su clitoris y le practiques sexo oral para que ella se excite mucho y sea más fácil la penetración y bueno aparte pues usad algun de esos liquidos que os he comentado son de la marca durex o control pregunta en una farmacia alli los suelen tener, cuestan como unos 8 o 9 euros, o sino comprad baselina en una farmacia o probadlo en una piscina, en una ba?era, en una posición en la que os resulte cómodos a los dos.<br>  Y ella tiene que concienciarse de que le va a doler, y la posición de que tu no fuerces ese dolor y que ella lo vaya soportando es que ella se coloque encima de ti, a horcajadas es decir tu tumbado y ella sentada encima de ti y que vaya metiendo tu pene poco a poco hasta que veais que queda dentro totalmente, que lo haga unas cuantas veces antes de empezar y luego ya podeis tomar la posición que más comodo os resulte porque ya no le dolerá tanto. <br>  Y si, es normal que muchas veces se resbale y se salga... hasta que la vagina de la chica esté más abierta así que por eso no os preocupeis... Y también te advierto que las primeras 3 o 4 veces le dolerá... pero que haga eso de ponerse encima tuya antes de empezar y ya está.<br>  Espero que os funcione.<br>  Un saludo y suerte!|`|1gMLm1Raaa	las relaciones sexuales antes de el matrimonio se le llama fornicacion, y estas pecando con tu cuerpo mejor no te metas hacer eso , mejor casate para no pecar|`|6920cbab90dec06b045cce96eff0fa8eaa	No es tu culpa es dificil y muy especial la primera vez.

Apesar disso, há muitas mulheres que n?o se preocupam em controlar o peso no período pré-natal. Se de um lado, tentar evitar o aumento de peso a todo custo pode ser prejudicial, comer descontroladamente também gera uma série de riscos para a gestante e para a crian?a. <br>  <br>  A médica endocrinologista do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da USP, Cíntia Cercato, afirma que o aumento de peso ideal na gesta??o está diretamente ligado à forma da mulher antes da constata??o da gravidez. "O indicado para mulheres com peso normal é adquirir de 11,5 a 16 Kg. Já mulheres que iniciam a gravidez com sobrepeso podem ganhar de 7 a 11,5Kg. Mulheres obesas, por sua vez, n?o devem ultrapassar o limite de ganho de, no máximo, 7 kg durante a gravidez", explica. <br>  <br>  A aten??o com a balan?a n?o é meramente estética. De acordo com Cíntia, o excesso de peso influi diretamente na saúde da m?e e do bebê. Gestantes que engordam muito têm mais chances de ter uma infec??o urinária, press?o alta, diabetes, entre outros problemas que podem ocasionar, inclusive, complica??es no parto. <br>  <br>  "Além disso, o ganho do peso fetal é proporcional ao ganho do peso materno. M?es acima do peso normal podem ter bebês muito grandes ? um caso que é denominado macrossomia. O fato de o feto crescer em demasia viabiliza o aumento da taxa de a?úcar no sangue e estimula o pancreas a produzir muita insulina. Isso faz com que a crian?a tenha mais probabilidades de apresentar hipoglicemia. Bebês que nascem muito grandes também têm mais riscos de desenvolver obesidade na infancia", destaca a endocrinologista. <br>  <br>  Apesar de os problemas com o aumento de peso serem inúmeros, Cíntia faz um alerta para m?es que n?o se alimentam adequadamente com medo de engordar. "Uma dieta extremamente restrita também faz mal. Ganhar pouco peso potencializa o risco de crian?as com baixo peso ao nascer, o que aumenta a morbi-mortalidade infantil", ressalta. <br>  <br>  O ideal para uma m?e que quer aliar o físico bonito a um estado de saúde equilibrado? A receita é simples: ter a indica??o de um especialista. "Após o parto, a m?e deve manter uma dieta adequada, para permitir uma perda de peso lenta e progressiva sem afetar a lacta??o. Em geral, recomenda-se um aporte adicional de 500 calorias/dia durante a amamenta??o e que a mulher perca cerca de 0,5 kg por semana, no máximo, para n?o prejudicar a produ??o do leite|`|NXgSkmfeaa	Olha perder peso durante a gravidez pode ser muito prejudicial ao bebe<br>  Mas isso tbm pode ser extresse e tes?o que a gravidez pode estar lhe causando e muitas tarefas excessivas<br>  Pois o correto ou é vc manter até o 6 meses e apartir dai ganhar alguns quilinhos  e nao perder<br>  ok<br>  bjus|`|cqlQor8Naa	Olá<br>  Olha n?o se preocupe, tambem emagreci ate o 4 mes, n?o sentia fome, depois do 4 mes adiquiri peso e come?ei a comer melhor, o ponto critico é ate o 4 mes, depois fica bem melhor,sem nauseas, vomito,etc. é so curtir mesmo<br>  <br>  Boa sorte.|`|3eeec083eb50ab6aaa996d7c4c2af47daa	N?o é normal n?o vo?ê esta correndo risco de vida.|`|d3EZfv1Baa	vc tem que fazer pre-natal e se consultar com um médico obstetra. n?o aceite  somente as opini?es de desconhecidos. vá a um médico logo. isso nao é brincadeira. o q foi normal para alguém pode ser risco pra vc. bj! se cuida!|`|d4pDVRiAaa	na minha gravidez eu ganhri peso e nao perdi,mais eu acho q nao tem nada ver nao.|`|eIBeyeNXaa	Super normal querida...fica tranquila que isso é até bom pra vc...quanto menos vc engordar, melhor será pra vc na hora do parto!!muita saúde a vc e seu bb....<br>  Bjos!!!!

Rarely, some people still have what looks like a period a month or two into their pregnancies.    Or you could've just ovulated sooner, which would've made your period sooner :)    Congrats!|`|3eedacdd967671121cd9896508699ccdaa	Sometimes a "period" will happen when you have already conceived. I've heard of this happening with several people that I know. One is 27 wks preggo with twin girls right now. She didn't even know until the beginning of September that she had conceived in July because she'd had her AF. So maybe you're farther along that you think.
be5IoBEmaa	Elodie Briar.  It's a great name.    I think Adalie would be forever mistaken for Natalie.  And if you nicknamed her Addie, well ... there are nearly as many Adelines and Addisons as Madelines and Madisons!    Elodie has so much history and style.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Go w/Adalie|`|n1mwxljzaa	Adalie Briar|`|V8wUAVdyaa	AdalaE (Add-a-lay) sounds better to me.  Adalie is better than Elodie though.  I think Melody is pretty too!|`|nkM6wmv6aa	I absolutely love them both! I also love Adalais (pron. ad-uh-lay). I really can't choose between these though - they're so gorgeous!!|`|zmRfnPomaa	definetly Elodie|`|27Uu2IJxaa	Adalie Briar|`|sxXoLSPxaa	yuk for both.|`|CpUn8MZeaa	I love Adalie it is cute Elodie sounds toooo old fashion for my taste Love the Blair though|`|PE0pcTX9aa	Elodie Briar|`|M8CTz7M0aa	I think Elodie flows better.  Adalie is loud and bold.|`|6bK5Vfpdaa	Adalie Briar, but i don't like briar...if you're going for names that start with a B and sound like that Blair is a good choice! :)
dwrdP3rQaa	First have him medically examined. If it is not physical it could be mental. Have him examined. If it was peeing it would be more physical but I think this is a response to the environment. Not an expert but I have three kids and know a thing or two.     You are not being mean but I think this may be a little more than him simply disobeying you. It sounds like it may get worse, try to give him a treat if he doesn't poop himself. Positive re-enforcement worked for my 1st grader.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	At the age of seven children usually do not soil. I would suggest he see his doctor about this. There is a condition called encopresis which is very treatable.|`|Amkmles0aa	ok he is not your kin send him home|`|Ip4Zd7AIaa	a shot of what?|`|cypZ0ykXaa	7 years old boy must hav learned this. waht his parents r doing?? u better talk to yur friend whether he has any problem or did'nt learn to use the toilet|`|mhvb9eFkaa	Sounds to me like an attention reaction.  Just tell him "he will have to just sit on it and if he goes home with it like that, his mother can take care of it".  See how he reacts to that!    Good Luck!|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	does he have aspergers?|`|zATQaiwIaa	he could have a medical condition ....get a medical opinion - and stop threatening him!
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	I like Ava or Scarlett..|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Very pretty names to choose from, but I've always really like Chloe. Isla, Ava, and Scarlett are beautiful too though. |`|TAIlyvgyaa	Isla is a fabulous name.  It's not overly common, but it's still traditional (in celtic countries anyway).  Perfect name.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Scarlett and Chloe are about tied....I'd say Scarlett was 1 though (less popular then Chloe)|`|ARAYm7BLaa	Iris|`|doLyOac0aa	Chloe is so common,<br>  <br>  I would say Isla,|`|7uznrLBXaa	Anything but Scarlett or Chloe. <br>  <br>  Not sure about Iris.  I *love* the flower, but I tend to dislike names that end in "s."  But it is a great "vintage" name!|`|8uvb3Nroaa	Iris is cute not on overly popular like Chloe or Ava. I personally don't like Isla and Scarlett is not that great.|`|nkM6wmv6aa	Isla<br>  then Scarlett<br>  then Chloe<br>  Ava's nice but a bit plain, Iris is cool but not that pretty - and a bit creepy when you think about that bit of your eye..|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Iris|`|SF1uPJZhaa	Isla or Scarlett<br>  |`|ev671fdkaa	ava.<br>  <br>  i like scarlett and chloe too though.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	Chloe|`|z6BtwSE8aa	Chloe|`|i2RSpZ6caa	Ooh, I like Isla, Scarlett, and Ava (although the latter is a bit too popular for my taste). Chloe is also nice but not as nice. And I don't really care for Iris.|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	I think both Ava and Scarlett are beautiful names!

And what is the point of picking a special name if a quarter of the other girls in the class have it? <br>  <br>  The only problem with Isla is that it would get mispronounced. It is a nice enough name that I wouldn't rule it out because of that, but with a shy chid that might be a burden. <br>  <br>  Iris is classic, but not too common. I know two girls named Iris, one is 8 and the other is 4, and they both like their names. I also have a dog named Iris, so I might be biased, lol! <br>  <br>  I also recommend Sylvia because it is classic and lovely. It means woodland. It has always been one of my favorites. <br>  <br>  ETA: Oh, I just re-read the part that says you aren't pregnant. That might change things for what is common. Hmm, I still don't like the others that much, though. Maybe Eva, but not so much Ava.|`|WIpRtLoFaa	Ava is too popular.<br>  <br>  Iris, Isla-okay...not a huge fan of either...no one around where I live would ever pronounce Isla right and Iris sounds like an old lady<br>  <br>  Scarlett- sounds too harsh for my taste<br>  <br>  Chloe is nice. Means "green shoot" in Hebrew. Not way overused.  <br>  <br>  Another suggestion: Phoebe<br>  <br>  My opinion. <br>  Thanks,<br>  Heidi|`|VKLY5vEgaa	Scarlett.<br>  Isla is a close second, but I prefer Inna (ee-nah).<br>  ~ε?з|`|okGkrfMraa	Chloe<br>  I'm not preg either but when I do have a child and if it's a girl , I am naming her Chole Marie I think it's a beautiful name.

s4LWmcTjaa	I would love to start a no-profit Christian based Pregnancy Resource center that advocates adoption and protecting the life of unborn babies.  Counselors would be on hand 24 hours a day and no pregnant female would be turned away.    I think it would be a good opportunity to minister to those in need and to show women there are people who care about their lives and that they are valued.    This place would be a shelter, OBGYN care clinic, L&D/post natal care, adoption agency and a place to received donated baby clothes, cribs, diapers and other supplies needed to care for a baby if you need them.    *I guess not everyone likes that idea.  I assumed if there were more places out there willing to take in pregnant women in need that it was a good thing.    *Sure you can Carrie.

Making and selling pies! I love pies, and I love making them. But that's never going to happen, right? So, going back to reality, I'm going to school to become an RN.

The organization would give them a "safety package" which would include things like a smoke alarm, carbon monoxide detector, first aid kit, safety gates, outlet covers, toilet seat latches, stove and oven guards, cabinet, drawer, and window latches, electrical cord kits, child-safe nightlights and bumpers (for sharp cornered objects).

I originally wanted to be a stay at home mother of six kids--  I would have adopted, fostered, or had some .. I just wanted a big family.

Then we moved back, (WHY?!) and I wanted to be a nurse but school/working didn't exactly work out....    my dream job now might be along the lines of  3 came early--- wildlife conservation ...

HXfHkoSHaa	In that case, someone else will be raising your children.  It is very understandable that both parents often work, but this much would be unfair IMO.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	I think if you're undecided, this should sway you to 'no'.    If you really, really want a child and will love him/her beyond understanding, then there's really no reason not to have one.    You could in fact limit your hours and I would strongly encourage you to do so if you have a child. While it's no reason to not have a child, it would really be a lot better.|`|gx4s68s8aa	You could be a good parent, but it would be very difficult.  And especially when the kids are very young you would be missing out on so much.  Babies sleep about 12 hours or so when they are infants.  So you would miss out most of the infants life.  And even as they get a little older they still sleep a lot and they change all the time.    If you can a good support system and good child care then it could work out for your child.  But I would think the people that would be the worst on would be you.    My husband sometimes has to work 10 to 12, six days a week.  Thankfully this isn't every week.  But it does happen and there are some months when he doesn't hardly see his young daughter.  Thankfully, I say home with her, so when his schedule is a mess, I email him on all the cute things she does during the day.    So it could work, but it would be tough on you especially.|`|ZusC87WBaa	I guess you can still be a good parent when you are available....what you would have to be more concerned about is finding a childcare provider that would be a good replacement.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't have children in that situation, but I know I couldn't do it.  I couldn't stand being away from my kids that much.  A lot of people seem to work it out though.|`|faPKwClPaa	Aside from the typical snide answers of everyone else raising your children (which is not entirely true), the bigger question is where would either of you get the energy to be with your kid(s)?  A 12-hour day is grueling; how do plan on recharging when you get home (that's if your kid is still awake).    I firmly believe you can balance kids and career (I do it every day), BUT, it really depends on the hours you put into both.  I love what I do, but I'm no workaholic.  I put in my 8 hours and I go home.  Same with my husband.      I just think 12-hour days (and odd shift work, like your husband has) will just be too much of a drain on all of you.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I have friends in psychology, both have PhDs, and work in counseling capacities, one at a hospital and one at her own practice.  Their husbands stay home with the kids (formerly in business), and are all great parents.    Take a look out at working mother magazine, or any article on how to be a working mom with flexibility for family.  Put in the hours now, and build the momentum and respect.  This will give you the bargaining power if you do want to change your schedule in the future.|`|dDVAUA9saa	Yes you can still be a good parents and have a career.  I haven't read anybody elses answers but can only imagine what they are.  Working or not working does not define a good parent.      Having said that, 12 hours is a long time for a baby/child to be in daycare.  I feel guilty and my daughter is in daycare for 8 hours a day.  Probably once you have that precious baby you will change your mind.  Or perhaps you are just not ready yet.  Not everybody wants children and if you are in your early 20's, you have lots of time to establish a career and then take some time off to raise a famly if you want.      Personally - I couldn't stand to put my daughter in daycare for 12 hours a day.|`|qImMwhUHaa	To be honest, you wouldn't be being a parent, the caregiver would.|`|AA10772154	NO - Do not even consider having children with this work schedule - Either you quit and take care of the children, ALONE, or forget about it -|`|jLYTKr33aa	You wouldn't be a parent at all if you worked that many hours.  Having a child doesn't make you a parent.  If you are working 12 hours per day, someone else is raising the children.  You're just a source of income for the people who are doing the raising - babysitters, daycare workers, etc.  Now, I'm not slamming mothers who work outside the home.  Of course there are parents who work outside the home and still spend plenty of time with their children.  But there really has to be a balance between your job outside the home and your job as a parent.  Either cut down your hours, or don't have children.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Not really. Of course it is possible, but the added stress, and lack of sleep would deminish the quality of time you would have to spend with the lil one/s.    Depending on how the hours worked out, it has the potential of having one or both of you gone from sun up to sun down. So the only time you'd have with the lil one/s would be on days off. It could work, but isn't my idea of ideal.    Now if you worked somehwere that offered say... 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off, than that'd be great!|`|eISzHe5maa	This might not be the best answer seeing as I'm actually not a parent, but a teenager but I have two working parents. My dad aside from being a platoon sergeant in the military (who will be heading off to Afghanistan in 5 weeks) works for the United Survey that's about 7 or 8 hours but it gets very difficult during the winter because of the poor weather. Sometimes it gets too cold and they can't work or whatever.     My mother is an RN and used to do second shift used to do 10 hours I think...now she works the night shift for 12 maybe 13 hours. I think she's an outstanding mom and anybody who says different about my mom will resort to me saying very rude things to them because I know I have one of the best mom's on this planet.    My mom has always worked, she's much like you ina way she was always career oriented but she did want one kid (me, haha). And those who say you'll miss out on everything as your child grows....I think they're very wrong. My mom was there when I said my first word, she was there to potty train me, she was there when I lost my first tooth, and she even was a big helper with me during pre - school and kindergarten yet she still worked.    And as for where I went when my parents were working was simple - to grandmothers house er...apartment. Which was perfectly fine because my grandmother and I got to sort of bond and when my uncle still lived in Ohio he would take us to so many places like to see my grandfather clog dance competitively, took me to the swimming pool, took me to the beach (I call it the fake beach). The only reason why I hated going there is because it's just an apartment and it's not like you could really go outside and such.    My mom worked two or three days and she would be off during the weekend (somedays she would take extra but that's usually during the winter when my dad can't work).    Also when my mom wasn't at work my dad worked 1st shift and that would give him the opportunity to spend the day/weekend with me. And it would give us a chance to spend time together and my dad took me everywhere. To heavy metal concerts (like the Ozzfest), to the Science Museum, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, to the golf course (which is how I started golfing).     My mom and I still spent a ton of time together. We went to the pool, to Cedar Point (we go every year), we'd go sled riding, we tried snow boarding but I quit after like one try, lol. Also she tried traveling with me when I was younger by taking me to North Carolina, Canada, and we visit our homeland in Germany once or twice.    My mom and I have such an impecable bond even with my mom working. It hurts me when people say that working moms can never be good mom's because it's like they're saying that my mom's a crap mom when she's freaking awesome. She's been with me every step of the way, she's been supportive, she's disciplined me, she helps me with school, she made sure I was all set for college by starting a college fund for me when she was pregnant, she's got me music and singing lessons, etc.     I'm not going to lie at time's it does get difficult and of course she gets tired but she's able to do it. It's much easier now with her working the nightshift. But it's not impossible.
rVnTnuU1aa	Absolutely. If he did not want to be a dad, then proper precautions should of been taken prior.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	yes.    if he really didn't want to be a dad before she got pregnant he could have chosen not to have sex or had a vasectomy.|`|UUpsa35Daa	Yes, he still should. If he didn't want to take care of or support a baby than he shouldn't have had sex...or at least used every kind of protection possible. He knowingly and willingly took part and is partly at fault that a child is being brought into the world so either he should choose to step up and pay child support or somebody should knock some sense into him and make him pay child support.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Yes, a man should pay child support  The child did not ask to be born to parents by accident    No, it's not fair  Life is not fair|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes he should unless he signs over his rights. It doesnt matter whether he wanted to have it, it is still his baby and he should have thought about it before having sex because with sex a baby is always a possibility.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	plenty of women didnt plan a pregnancy either ..but it doesnt get them off the parenting hook...you play ..you pay|`|AA11327039	If a guy has sex with a girl, and that sex creates a baby then yes, he should pay child support.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	Yes he should still have to pay child support.  Regardless of if he wanted the kid, he had sex.  Sex can lead to pregnancy, not matter what precautions are being taken.  If he has sex, he is assuming the risk, and should assume responsibilities if the girl becomes pregnant.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Yes i do think a father should be pay child support weather he wants to be in the childs life or not. The baby didnt ask to come into this world. If he didnt want any children then he should have been using protection or have gotten fixed. It takes 2 to tango and the mother shouldnt be left with all the responsibility. Its bad enough if he doesnt want to be a part of its life and the mother has both the mom/father position to fill herself...let alone all the expenses for the child.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	absolutely.     he chose to do the deed, so he needs to be able to accept the consequences. Whether or not he wanted a baby it's his responsibility.     if he doesnt want a baby he shouldn't have sex.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	My thought is that regardless of his desires to have a child or not, he had sex and therefore hes half responsible for the pregnancy. Hes obligated to take responsibility.|`|505c28ffab4b949ab353bc9f3870e311aa	Well, if you did not want to be a father then why are you?    And if you have allowed for this to happen... that means that the baby is half yours and half hers.  So you are responsible for half of what it costs to raise that child.    The point is, if you didn't want to be a dad BEFORE the woman got pregnant then you should of covered up your winkie.  It's to late now.  Take responsiblity.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Yes he should  Weather he wanted to be a dad or not doesn't matter. He should have taken the measures to insure he had no more kids, if that was the way he felt.|`|aqto0hJTaa	If all people of child-bearing age would learn some simple math, life would be easier for all.    Sex = babies    No sex = no babies    True, you don't always have babies if you have sex, but you always have the chance for babies if you do.  I'm pretty sure no one since Mary has had a baby without sex (or sperm from a donor).    Yes, a father should have to support the child he created.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	absolutely YES. if he didnt want to be a parent he should of thought of all contraception options before conceiving a child with the woman or not have sex with her at all....clearly he didnt so he should cough up and help provide for his baby|`|AA11210405	Yes. There is such a thing as birth control out there if her really didn't want a baby..... and if he REALLY didn't want one then he should not have had sex in the first place.   Sex makes babies. If you are going to play then you must accept the consequences.|`|tmh42R6Caa	I think if he turns over his rights as a father then he may be able to get out of paying.  However, if he wants to keep his rights, he has to pay.  It's probably different by state.|`|qImMwhUHaa	If you put your penis in her then you took that chance. You should have to pay up, it's your responsibility, no if's ands or buts about it. If she chooses then she can have you sign off on your parental rights and you won't have to pay child support or see the child or if another man adopts the baby and you sign off on your rights too, but other than that you're sol.|`|l7vDiKDzaa	Absolutely!  A father has as much responsibility for his child as does a mother---no matter the cirumstances.  Man-up!!|`|mO7FOXNYaa	Yes the dad should pay child support.    I didn't want kids. I had no plans whatsoever of being a parent. Then I got pregnant.    Whose fault was it? MINE...and of course the father.    I "pay" by being a caring, loving, mommy. I make sacrifices (um, not being a drug addict for example...j/k) and give my son a healthy life.  Dad "pays" by sending child support payments.    Done.   Next question please.|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	Absolutely.  Unfortunately, accidents do happen and he should have talked to the woman prior to the accident.  If he made it quite clear that he did not want any children and proceeded to use condoms and she still ended up pregnant, tough cookie.  Pregnancy is a consequence of sex.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Of course he should, the mother has to care for the child regardless of whether she wanted to be a mother or not (unless she gives it up for adoption).     If he truly did not want to have a baby then he could have just not have sex. If he has sex he is accepting that there is a chance (even if a small chance by using condoms, birth control, etc) a baby could result, even when using birth control there is a small chance it can fail.|`|VC8ivJHjaa	If a man participates in unprotected sex, then yes he should have to pay child support. "Do the crime, do the time"    If he did not want to be a dad, then he should focus on abstinence, self service, or safe sex. Vasectomies are not hard to get|`|Ubb4RiXLaa	well, my thing is this, after all the objections, he still had sex with the girl right? cos that's how she got pregg; so let's see..did he insist they use protection? did her ask her to take the pill or something? and if she didn't and he still wanted her so bad, did he go get condoms? no? well then he shoulda never put it in, Duh! Anyways, sex is sex and it makes babies if no plan to contrary. might wanna support that kid, it's the decent thing to do, the least you can do.|`|0QYIbn1saa	Hell no he shouldn't, it's the woman's fault for getting pregnant, right??    (************BIG EYEROLL************)    My answer is yes.|`|Fh6ozB5faa	No bashing here, however each person in a relationship has a resposibility to avoid pregnancy if they do not want a child.  It is not just the womans duty to be certain she does not get pregnant it is also the mans responsibility to protect himself.  There are many women who will "trap" a man but the man could have prevented it so yes you are going to pay child support for a very long time. The child born from this type of situation suffers.  I guess the interesting part of your question is "he expressed his view that he didn't want to be a dad before the woman got pregnant".  I have never heard of expressing a view as a form of birth control.  I used to tell my son these things as he felt it was "up to the girl to take care of" when he was much younger.  Respect yourself, your future, your goals and your desires of how you want to live your life by taking responsiblity for something as major as this.  I wish you the best of luck if you are in this situation.|`|UPF4LzmXaa	yes. l think that child support should be payed in this situation because it isnt right to leave one parent with the results of carelessness- if the father said he didnt want to be a parent he could have insisted on protection. but he made a decision and should accept the consequences-financial help. the baby didnt ask to be born either- why put a child through something like that- l know from experience that when your parents fight about having to support an unwanted child that it hurts. A lot.|`|9LWuWHiMaa	Put it this way:   Did you ask to be born?  Did you have a choice in the matter?  Did you get to choose the parents you were born to or the time you were born?   But you are here, and you are alive and from the sound of things somewhat healthy and educated.  So this man should put his selfishness aside and think about the innocent child who is in the center of this mess.   This child never asked any of the above questions or even had a choice in the matter but the child is here.  I believe that whether it was planned or not the bigger picture is that this child needs food, clothing, shelter, education, heathcare, a mom and a dad. This child is a person, who needs love and support regardless of whether or not he/she was planned for.  The child is here and needs to be taken care of. so the father who is talking need to think about these things and really consider how selfish and heartless his stand is.   Also if he did not want to have children he should have been using a condom, he cant make the woman take contraceptives but he sure can protect himself from a unwanted child by using a condom. Even better, the only sure fire way of not having a child should be to abstain.  So this man need to step up to the plate and take responsibility for his child because the child deserves to be taken care of.   He should not punish the child because he was careless and neglectful about his sex responsibility. That is what I think.  Another reson fornication is wrong, it destroys the livIlihood of innocent children. The laws of God are good|`|GPW6HUZFaa	Yes he should.  He still chose to have sex and he knew what could possibly happen.|`|kZRTekoJaa	i have to agree that he should have to pay.  there's always a chance of pregnancy no matter what precautions you take so he should have abstained from sex or pay the price.
pkdDEJd4aa	I would go to a naturopath, they can recommend natural antibacterial products that aren't near as harmful.    On a side note: I had chronic bronchitis from the ages of 0 to 22, (my 18th-22nd year were the worst.. it was a constant infection I coughed for years it was awful.)  I decided to make a change, I realized my body is sensitive and deals with things I eat differently than other ppl.. I did a yeast cleanse with a naturopath for at least one month, I stopped eating refined sugars, trans/hydrogenated fats, colors, flavors, preservatives, pesticides etc. I eat organic when I can and stick to foods as healthy and natural as possible. Guess what? No bronchitis since! And I am 26 years old now.   I feel much much better. You would not believe how many prescriptions of antibiotics I have been on.. it did so much harm that I had to reverse with my yeast and good bacteria levels.    I'm sure your baby will be fine if you ARE pregnant, but I strongly suggest you consult with a naturopath quickly to see if you should finish your dose or if there's an alternative for you. Of course you can go to your reg medical doc, but a regular doctor is exactly the man who prescribed me all the antibiotics and never got down to the root of my problem, and instead, aggravated it.|`|grKtTRYtaa	Wonderful websites for your ?:    WebMD and Mayo.com       Go for them.|`|jTkJbTc6aa	well i had a sinus infection a few weeks ago and  i told my dr that there was a possibly of me being pregnant and that i am ttc, he put me on amoxcillon(sry spelling) saying that it is a safe antibotic for me in case i was pregnant, so you should be okay on that...but im not sure about the codene, i would call your DR and ask what he thinks just to be sure. Best of luck!
xL16bC3waa	Your baby is probably fine, when he starts looking around more and using his neck better it will probably fix itself. That is a rather large baby to push out so maybe that has something to do with it. If you start to notice that he is always looking to one side then you need to tell your dr. I noticed that about my daughter when she about the same age I saw somewhat of the same thing. Her head was a little lopsided, I asked the doctor about it and she took a look and told me that she had Torticolis. This is where the muscles on the one side of the neck are tight and it causes them to only look one way due to the fact that the muscles are tight. It can easily be corrected w/stretches. If you are concerned ask your doctor to take a look.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	It could be plagiocephaly.  Which can be caused by constantly laying in the same position.  Or is could be Craniosynostosis, which is a serious condition.  It is common for a newborn, to have a misshappen head for the first few weeks of life, but if it continues after 6 weeks, then it's usually no longer from birth, and a sign of something else.  Take a look into the two things I've told you,do some research, and talk to your doctor at his next appointment, or if he does go for a while give him a call, and make one.  It could be nothing, but it could also be a sign of something serious.  Plagiocephaly usually can be treated with a helmet, or repositional therapy if caught early, where Craniosyntososis needs to be corrected with surgery.      ADD*  Just noticed he was a big baby.  Plagiocephaly, can also be cause by cramped quarters in the womb, sort of molding the skull, they are very pliable up to the age of one.  Take a look into it, mild forms can be corrected with the repositional therapy.  My daughter has very mild positional brachycephaly, which is doing much better just with the repositional therapy, but that should be started at 2 to 3 months to get good results, if you wait to long, the use of a helmet 23hrs a day will be needed!|`|r5R2nstRaa	did you have to have a vacuum used during labor? or forceps? could be why. shape your baby's head. really. every day just rub your baby's head in circles. its something my grandmother told me, and it worked for me. if all fails, hair will grow in and you wont even notice.|`|LhEoVly0aa	its early days and it depends how you delivered him, did you have suction or forceps?? talk to your health visitor or doctor if you worried, i wouldnt worry anyway because as soon as he gets hair you wont notice at all.
lzivF4Idaa	no. that probably wont be enough unless you have documented stepmother threats or worse.    EDIT- i do know how you feel though, they just come back and sucker you in!!! good for you if you learned your lesson, i say that all the time.....and i always seem to get suckered back in. i always say he will never see our son again, then its like he gets me! aghhhh. right now ive just cut him and his whole family out of my childs life for very good reasons.|`|AA10772154	Please go to the Police and ask they write a report on all you have said -   It may not be enough for a restraining order but at least if this keeps up, you will have ample proof that he is bothering you. Go to the Police twice if you have to and get a written report  from them - Sooner or later the judge will grant you and order -|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I am in agreement with Stay@homemomma, and if I didn't know any better, I'd swear it was my ex, except he has a major drug problem in addition with the alcohol.  I got rid of him 3 months before my now 2 year-old son was born.  He always pulled the exact same stuff with me.  He didn't see my son until he was 26 months old.  My son didn't know who he was, and didn't feel comfortable around him, as I'm single and plan to stay that way for a while, so he's not used to being around men at all.  Right now, I let him see my son once a month as I'm scared of him finding out where I now live, and having an officer @ my door with papers for visitation.  I feel like he only wants to "be in" my son's life to show, "Hey, I'm your dad".  Sorry, but it takes a MAN to be a dad.  I don't think he cares about my son, he just enjoys playing games with my head.  My best advice is while I truly do not know if you can prove emotional abuse to the authorities, you can try to consult an attorney about the threats via text.  You should be able to get a free consultation at least, or for advice if nothing else.  I hope things go better for you.  I know what you are going through.  I still go through it, it's horrible.    Good luck.  = )|`|IlOjhe9Xaa	Rad-tech...about your baby's father being a nut. Sorry babe, it's KARMA. Hopefully you suck it up and can make wiser decisions about men next time. I don't feel sorry for you.|`|kMyVAMLoaa	If he wants visitation he can get it through the courts.  Your days of dealing with his crap is over.  The courts were willing to grant visits to my kids dad, even though he abused be for 5 years and almost killed me twice.  I hid out, and after a while, he gave up. They dont really care, especially if he can not come around for 7 months,.  You can offer your daughter much more on your own.    Good luck, and good ridence.|`|UUpsa35Daa	I don't think it would hold up in court without evidence. Emotional abuse is a lot harder to prove than physical abuse, obviously because of the physical damage. With emotional abuse, you basically need a recording of the acts or a witness to the acts or it's just down to he said-she said and that won't hold up in there.     If i were you, i would consult a lawyer or public aid, maybe even just a police officer. Tell them what happened and what's been happening and ask if anything substantial could be done. They're better equipped to answer this questions for you.    I'm sorry you're going through this.    Edit: When you go in to talk to whoever you choose, take the evidence you do have. That will change the result of what they say greatly.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I don't think the emotional stuff you described could get a protective order.  however, if you have text messages describing threats to himself or others, it would be worth a phone call to your local police station to ask for an opinion.  i can't see why that would hurt...
UYfqzCoMaa	Tell them that until they can speak to you and treat you with respect that they cannot see their grandchild. They would be teaching your son to do the same by their behavior. Stick to it if you do say it so that they know that you are serious.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	I would tell them to stuff it!  You don't want your child to be around people like that.  Do you want your child to hear them saying that kind of stuff and let it rub off on him/her?  You don't need anything but positive influences in your life, so tell them to act right or good bye.|`|oL3AoLPsaa	Tell them how it is!

Tell them when they say things like that it hurts your feelings and offends you as a parent.  And if she proceeds to talk to you like that just tell you feel uncomfortable with your precious child being around someone who feels so horribly about his mother.  And if she isn't adult enough to change her ways then there is no reason I'd put up with her.  Best of luck.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Take the high road. If they really are trying to get a rise out of you, not responding will annoy them more than reacting. If you ended up making a comment and falling out, you might be blamed for a loss of relationship between your son and his grandparents.    I'm pretty sure most people have to 'put up' with their in laws, or ignore stupid comments once in a while. Just be as patient as you can, and if it really gets to you, leave the room and scream into a cushion!|`|lzivF4Idaa	tell them you would appreciate it if they would watch their comments.     if that doesnt work, tell them to back the **** off.|`|kp0QYdb9aa	SAY SOMETHING U DONT DESERVE TO BE DISRESPECTED|`|q2AsDnjpaa	I don't understand the term outlaw in-laws. do you mean they are wanted?

If they are saying those things to you chances are they will start saying them to your son and he will start speaking disrespectfully to you even if he doesn't know that he is.  They are the grandparents but not the parents and you can tell them bluntly that if they want to talk that way to you, then they don't have to see him anymore.  If they want to treat you with some respect and dignity then they are welcome to see him.|`|AA11100518	ok, first issue is that you are labeling them as bad things:  they make you feel like crap  they insult you  they are rude  you need to take a third option of having empathy with them instead of seeing what they do as bad.  they are just trying to connect.  they are just having behavior.  they are not 'driving you nuts' or insulting you.  they are being generous (buying the kid things u can't afford) and spending time with the kid.  these are good things.  try saying  "oh thank you, i could really use a break" or  "thanks so much, he does need a winter coat if that would work for your plans" or  "thanks so much for the art supplies, david really enjoys them"  or  "i have a list of school supplies if you'd like to help with that" or  try to work with them instead of rebelling against them.    they are the kid's grandparents.  they really don't sound like bad people at all to me.  it's your response that you need to work on.  if you feel insulted by something they say or do, tell them your feelings:  i feel a little hurt when you say that because i have a need for independence (or whatever your need is that isn't met by their statement)|`|AA10590885	They can afford to buy things for the child that you can't.  That is the case with most grandparents - so why do you get so sensitive about it? You are working your butt off to supply the essentials - just like your parents before you - it has always been the grandparents joy to spoil the grand-kids.  How much of your hostility comes from the fact that it is your ex and not your parents? Roll with it, do you depend on them to watch the child to give you a break? Is it important that they have contact with family even if it is not your blood family?
bAp35x7uaa	It's not impossible however in most cases it lasts between 10-13 days.  They say your luteal phase is always constant however mine fluctuated between 11-13 days regularly.  It varies from woman to woman.    What tends to happen if a luteal phase seems longer than average is that that ovulation was delayed that month -  so it looks as though the luteal phase is longer, but actually it isn't.    However, temps extended beyond your normal luteal phase could indicate a pregnancy....    You only really need to worry though if your luteal phase is shorter than 10 days as that can prevent implantation.    Good luck    x|`|BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|jaP0TANdaa	I don't think it can NEVER be any longer... but from what I've read it is VERY RARE for a luteal phase to be longer than 16 days. It makes sense if you take into consideration the statements that if you are 18DPO with high temps, chances are VERY good that you're pregnant. So no, I don't think it's impossible to be longer than 16 days, just extremely rare.|`|XO4talxxaa	I was wondering the same thing i believe i ovulate around cd 11-13 and my cycles are 31 days that would make mine around 18-20 days!

WrGq35zSaa	I am still forcing naps.<br>  I need my sanity and just 5 MINUTES PEACE.<br>  <br>  My boys all need their naps, otherwise they become unbearable. And I don't like naughty, grumpy, tired little boys.|`|BRBPDBvIaa	With my two children, I got them use to taking naps since they were babies.  They are now 4 and 2 and I can't get my 4 yr old to take a nap what so ever now.  I don't think he really needs it anymore, so I don't really to and make him.  However for my 2 yr old, she still needs them so put her down and let her sleep for like 2 hours and all is good.  |`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My son gave up naps on his own at 1 year old.  He is 2.5 now and takes maybe one nap a month, on his own time.  My daughter is 1.5 and she takes one nap most days, but probably skips 2 a week.  I let them decide for themselves and take me cues from them.|`|ND2a7EVnaa	my son was 18 months old when he stoped taking naps. it as been hard no time for my self at all i do get stress out sometimes. my son is now 27 months.|`|SMcrEhiTaa	My daughter who is 25 months stopped wanting to take naps about 3 weeks ago. But we still lay her down for one because she sits there and rubs her eyes. So either my husband or I lay down with her and get her to sleep :)|`|AA11947878	At 23 months we started waking him after about an hour, because night time sleep was awful. I tried having him nap earlier, but his didn't help. So it works better for us if he gets no nap or a very limited one. |`|v9PNCMXbaa	They stopped taking naps around 3 I miss those days|`|JGjpc7Itaa	My granddaughter  is 3 and a half and most of the time she doesn't sleep when it is rest time but she does lie down for quiet time.  She has been doing this for over a year.|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	One day I put my 2yo daughter to bed and all she did was muck around and not go to sleep for an hour, I gave up and stopped putting her to bed, no more sleeps after 2 years old. My son is still having sleeps at 22 months and until he stops sleeping well at night or starts mucking around rather than sleeping he will continue to have a nap during the day. No matter how you stop the naps the child will either need to have a top up day while adjusting, or go to bed a little earlier until they have adjusted.
hh892gJfaa	Favourite: Madeline 9/10 (lovely name, can be shortened to Maddy/Maddie, my friend is called Maddy)<br>  Karin 8/10 (sounds really nice, I like it)<br>  Karen 7/10<br>  Sylvia 5/10<br>  Jutta 4/10 (I understand this is probably from a different language but it won't really hold up here - perhaps a middle name?)<br>  Least favourite: Urte 1/10 (sounds like 'hurt' so no)|`|QVJ0CwNtaa	hun, im sure those people were not trying to be horrible about your grandmother or great aunt. i'm so sorry to hear about what you've been through recently. they were just giving an opinion on the name, which is what we thought you wanted. dont let our opinion on a name upset or hurt you, we only were trying to help. anyways, i love Madeline, its the sweetest name. Karen and Karin are also cute. |`|doLyOac0aa	Sorry, but i don't like any of those listed,|`|z6BtwSE8aa	I think Madeline Karin is pretty. |`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	Karin|`|0BC2WTyoaa	I like Madeline and Karin.  Is it pronounced KAH-RIN?|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love Madeline!!|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I don't like them...sorry. Sylvia is ok. But the rest? No. Madeline is extremely overused, Jutta and Urte are just horrid, and Karin and Karen...well, I dont know what the difference is but they both remind me of old ladies.<br>  <br>  Well, I don't mean to be rude but you asked what do I think. I do think, however, that it is your aunts baby so if she loves those names then that is what truly matters. Im sure a beautiful baby girl would be no less cute even with the name Hortensia (or Urte for that matter). Congrats to your aunt and good luck!|`|GCN3dquAaa	I like Sylvia and Madeline.<br>  How do you pronounce Karin and Karen differently?<br>  Urte is a little weird.<br>  Jutta is also weird, and looks like Judy or Judah.|`|K3uVBPTaaa	I like Madeline <br>  <br>  Jutta & Urte - sound like old names to me<br>  Karin & Karen - however you want to say it, just wouldnt be my first choice<br>  <br>  Sylvia is okay<br>  <br>  How about choosing your own first name and then selecting one of these as a middle name |`|NbsBwYDJaa	The only one I like is Madeline.<br>  I guess Sylvia is ok.<br>  x|`|5d4a98ef0b6163a6f10b0c267b9ae934aa	Madeline or Sylvia|`|40jlWKL9aa	madeline is okay, and Karin is very pretty.  Not fond of the other names|`|bAkYn7ySaa	This names are best<br>  Jutta<br>  Karin<br>  Karen|`|gqqNae3Laa	Madeline OK<br>  Jutta No God please no,end the suffering.<br>  Urte Unknown pronounciation looks ugly.<br>  Karin I prefer Karyn pronounced 'Kar' like in Karen 'yn' as in 'in'.<br>  Karen (different spelling to Karin and pronounced different)<br>  Sylvia my old auntie is called this so im thinkin of her i cant decide whether its pretty in which case i really love it or old-fashioned.|`|2rCZbaEIaa	Madeline is so cute<br>  Sylvia seems dated, but still nice....recently Ive seen some younger children with that name comming back and I personally really like it<br>  <br>  Karen is a boring name, I think of really boring people when I hear that name   (sorry if thats your name lol)<br>  <br>  as for the other names I've never heard them before, and probably wouldn't consider any of them for a baby because they don't really look or seem to sound pleasing|`|ByWRzuuraa	Madeleine is beautiful.<br>  I dont really like the other names but im not going to be horrible to you over it and it still doesn't give people the right to say nasty things to you, Please ignore them honey.<br>  x|`|QBKzvw4faa	I LOVE MADELINE.. it's an adorable name :)..<br>  <br>  Karin is cute too.. different but not to wild & crazy lol.. <br>  <br>  The others aren't really my style.. it's not my child.. <br>  <br>  Wishing your aunt good luck with her pregnancy  :) xo|`|CmftMWkmaa	I like Jutta if she wants something different but if she wants something adorable and sweet then Madeline is a nice choice (= |`|CO7YWfTyaa	I think the best one is Madeline as you can shorten it to names such as: Maddie <br>  Sylvia and Karen is OK,  I'm not so keen on the others though. Sorry.|`|CTmWS6dMaa	I love Sylvia! It is pretty and playful while still being suitable for an adult. She can go by Silvie when she is younger if she likes. |`|eM2eMqoZaa	I like madeline it is very pretty and sweet and can be shortened to Maddy.|`|oHZKqAF1aa	Madeline is pretty.. sorry the rest are pretty dated for a baby..|`|4xst6JKBaa	Karen|`|hNhzBrtJaa	Madeline is definately my favorite :)x|`|Y8xG9qlIaa	madeline!!!!|`|M87RwXZYaa	MADELINE!<br>  definitely and you could shorten it to Maddie <br>  so cute XD|`|6fyeRxO2aa	i like madeline, but they are all quite cool and unusual|`|697EHXNeaa	I like Madeleine|`|LTBrUtosaa	i like the name madeline|`|DdosnVKSaa	I really like Jutta and Urte they are relli diffrent ..<br>  madeline is cute..x<br>  |`|iITmC52qaa	I honestly do not like any of these
dUeDmb7raa	swift smack to the ***|`|rAUDaQSYaa	i would be sad because i know then that he doesnt respect me.|`|W3mhMbSVaa	I would slap him/her across the face! Teach em who's boss!|`|VjV7W6qLaa	sent him to his room and teach him never to do that again|`|3NQR75zraa	slap their *** up|`|xKeC9C2daa	i WOULD SLAP HIM SILLY!!!!!!!NO LIE!!!HE DNT TALK T0 ME DAT WAY.....HEAKSSS NAW~!!|`|tPV0MlgKaa	It would depend on HOW they said it.Angrily or playfully.|`|LU96bnCdaa	i would probably smack him or her in the mouth  kids need 2 have respect 4 their parents|`|t043WEDIaa	explain how that is inappropriate, put them in a time out, and do not let this behavior to continue unless you want them saying that to you for the next 10 years|`|IJnfoIehaa	I WOULD GIVE HIM A LITTLE SWAT TO THE BEHIND OR HABD AND TELL HIM WHY ITS IMPORTANT TO NOT TELL HIS ELDERS "SHUTUP" BECAUSE IF YOU DONT TEACH HIM HE'LL KEEP DISRESPECTING YOU AND OTHER ADULTS.|`|zzbOfTEjaa	i'd 1st talk to any teachers or babysitters to see if they might have picked it up there. the child just needs to be sat down and talked to.|`|BO28Mn8haa	With all the desire to smack the sh*t out of a brat like that, i'd probably ground him, and make him write a report about why it's wrong to hurt mommy's feelings like that|`|WQkNgof5aa	It all depends on how you have disciplined him in the past. A light smack, yelling, taking away privleges. All those could be useful, depending on how you have raised him.|`|69GgJhnWaa	I would give them the mom look and say in a very low, angry tone that you, under no circumstances EVER tell me to shut up. I am you're mother and you WILL NOT speak to me that way. But since you decided that it was acceptable, than I am deciding it is also acceptable for you to be grounded the rest of the day. After this I would recommend re-thinking what you want to say before you say it.      In most cases I would say send them to their room, but by 8 they know better.|`|1hpctY4saa	I would discipline them and make it clear that should NEVER happen again.  If I don't curb the disrespect now, it will multiply as the child grows older.  And the child would not only not respect me, but also others.    Take this seriously.|`|XfXRFCtcaa	I would be sad.    BUT    I would spank their hynie too|`|UOIvSlgcaa	First I would explain to my 8yr old that telling someone to shut up is rude and hurtful then, I would explain that it is also disrespectful, especially to tell an adult to shut up.  I would then tell my 8 yr old that he/she would have to sit in time out for ten minutes for telling me to shut up.  I would assure my 8 yr old that I still loved them but that what they had done was wrong and came with consequences.|`|1vbX1KYAaa	I would be in total shock and be like wow these parents did an awful job.  This kid has no discipline and no respect for his elders.|`|u5XMQ1Ysaa	hey i have a 8 year old bro and if he says that i give him a smack because he should not be talking to you like that.  my bro stoped once he had about 6 smacks. lol|`|xeS8pUfbaa	smack on the mouth, grounding and no TV.    thats what my mom did and it worked|`|3Tqq1nCGaa	Whatever you do, dont give them the "Respect" lecture. Just tell them in a strait face very calmly that that language is inapropriate in your house. If it continues then i suggest finding the source of this problem and fixing it. If its tv, check the shows they are watching and block some of them, If its a friend of theirs talk to their parents. Don't get too drastic though. Im pretty sure i started saying "shut up" around 8-10.|`|TVEeQfmGaa	You have to tell them that saying shut up is not appropriate language to use, they need to apologize and or be sent to their room for some down time.  When all is calm you can then approach the subject and try and calm the situation down.|`|WhSRZJjYaa	WELL FIRST OF ALL HOW ARE U RELATED TO THE 8 YR. OLD?? PARENT?? WELL YELLING BACK AT HIM/HER WILL MAKE HIM/HER YELL AT YOU AGAIN (IM IN PSYCHOLOGY) AND THEN YOU WILL NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MADE HIM/HER YELL AT YOU IF ONLY U ASKED A SIMPLE QUESTION...THE CHILD MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING....IT ALSO DEPENDS IF THE CHILD SHOWED AGGRESSION OR A CALM TONE AS HE/SHE YELLED AT YOU.....|`|OPSfAK5paa	make the kid chew on soap|`|7d7289f5881a8134ad8a1218803485acaa	IF any of my kids told me to shut up, they would have a red ***.  On top of that? NO tv, no video games, extra homework, and oh yes, MORE chores.  Parents have to start taking control of their children, and not let the government tell us how to raise our kids.  Old time punishment does work, as long as it is within reason.  NO, i'm not talking about child abuse, I am talking about a swift kick in the ***.|`|cqW3NhqVaa	SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE.  MY KIDS WILL KNOW BETTER THAN THAT, AND WOULD  NEVER SPEAK TO ME IN THAT MANNER. I WOULD NEVER  LET IT GET THAT OUT OF HAND.    ITS CALLED HORRIBLE PARENTING.  THATS WHATS WRONG WITH SOCIETY TODAY, IM NINETEEN  AND I SEE IT.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Tell him that kind of language is not to be used. Then Time out for 8 minutes.|`|iufAPDeWaa	Whoop his 8yr old butt! Spare the rod spoil the child. Our generation is proof that that statement is true! If you allow him to get away with it he'll do it again and soon things will get worse. Dont just spank him, or send him to his room. Because eventually that lil bit won't phase him. Make him shed a few tears. He'll act right because he won't want to be whooped again.|`|hneetSf2aa	call the super nanny HAHAHA|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Just don't pull a Clint Eastwood on him (love the avatar! :D )    I would think an apology would be in order, then the kid would be spending some serious quality time in his room. Perhaps he let it slip, but if it were a regular thing there would be major consequences in my house, for sure.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	You get right in there face. As your looking down at them you very softly explain why that's not acceptable behavior. Then you ground or take away or whatever your thing is for a long time. You remind them for the next few days what they did was wrong and whats going to happen if they ever do it again.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	The child would be standing with nose in corner for the next half hour ... hands down at sides, no 'wiggling' and no 'talking.'  This should be done repeatedly (add 15 minutes each time the child does this) and IMMEDIATELY after the child says it.  Your child has been rude to you, and all you need to say is 'Rudeness is not acceptable behavior in this house.'  Be sure that there is nothing near the corner for the child to see or watch ... even a picture ... and be sure the child is standing 'straight up' with the nose IN the corner, not 'near' the corner ... leaving 'nose prints' if possible.  I raised my four kids on 'corner time' and NOT ONE ever told me to 'Shut up' more than once.  Note, if your child says "I hate you!' that is a different 'error.'  Then you should simply shrug and tell the child 'That's okay.  It means I'm doing my job as your parent' and continue to do what you were doing, as if it's 'normal behavior.'  The difference is that 'I hate you!' is an emotional response, and emotions should never be denied ... don't get hurt, because every child hates the parent once in awhile if the parent is a good parent.  To say 'Shut up!' is simply rude behavior which needs to be stopped immediately.|`|zhk8o514aa	A smack in the ***.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	I would have a 8 yr old with a sore butt.     I raised 9 kids and I know what to do...|`|oojO4WAraa	I'd definitely send the smart *** to his room right away - for at least an hour.  After that, we would have a serious talk where the kid found out he lost his allowance for the rest of the month, and his privileges to watch television and play computer games, and he would not be playing with his friends for the next two weeks either.  And if he whines, I would threaten to increase the penalty.|`|3jMsJXjGaa	send him/her to his/her room and ground him/her from tv and or Computer/video games|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	bad parenting my in a laws kids are brats and do this the parent are Mormans and think as long as there family doesnt drink coffee and beer then it is ok but their kids are rude|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	i would react the same way when he threw at tantrum at 2 and yelled at me when he was 5.  lady, you need to get on board here.  your kid obiviously thinks he's the one wearing the pants in the family.    For whatever reason you have not laid down the necessary ground work for him to understand that telling your mom or dad "shut up" is not acceptable.    you need help and its only going to get worse if you don't get some real advice and help and starting changing the way you're doing things.|`|93ef28cefacaf49d52606517946a2d08aa	I would first punish myself first for raising a child that would behave like this because it's obviously a learned behavior. Then, I would punish the CRAP out of him until he/sh realizes that what he did was wrong! Make a bad punishment such as, no T.v., confined to bedroom, or restricting anything he/she really cares about.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I wouldnt react...shut up isnt a bad word. It means be quiet. And I dont make mountains out of mole hills..Im secure|`|JH2GqpA2aa	Poor influences and/or parenting.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	Spank his ***.|`|P9oP8CS9aa	"Wanna see nine" would be my answer. If he said yes, then I would correct him "It's shut your pie hole"|`|tA8T4QYFaa	Some time in the time out chair.|`|fa95a107c51b407e83a3e95fe81a0e10aa	Tell her it was unacceptable and if it was a repeat offense either put her in time out or take away a privilege.  The first time would be a warning.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Try to figure out if she learned it from me or someone else.|`|LbbawO7naa	I would shout at them "No you shut up."  Mature  Simple  :D|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...SPANK his little *** till he remembered who's the parent !   (both of my kids went thru that stage and both of them ended up with "bright red" butts !)  and a brand new outlook on how the family works...  works just fine !|`|QzWHMGHJaa	8 minutes in time out and an apology expected, as long as that isn't how you speak to you child!  If you tell your child to shut up, then how can you expect anything different from them?|`|OTxCCXa5aa	I would explain to him why he shouldn't speak to me like that and why he should respect his parents and his elders and send him to his room.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I've been acting that way since I was that age and I'm 24 now. It's the way kids are. Let it go!|`|yHlWHB1Yaa	This all depends. Has he been acting out a lot lately? If yes, do what you feel is right to discipline him (however, I don't recommend slapping him. I remember getting hit when I was younger and it messed me up. I was always scared when I acted out a bit, and having your child fear you isn't going to make you happy, I hope). Check if he has been learning this from someone. For EXAMPLE, an older brother or sister that is rebellious? This doesn't mean that an older sibling is the result of it, I'm just giving out possibilities. This COULD have been a slip of words if you were having a disagreement and he had no points to give back. Make sure he knows it's rude, though.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I would shut up. And by that, I mean for the next 24 hours or so, anytime I heard "Mom", I would completely ignore it. Let's see how happy my 8 year old would be if I did shut up.   "mom, I'm hungry"- no answer.  "mom, I need help with homework"- no answer.  "mom, I need a ride"- no answer  ...after a day of that, hopefully they wouldn't say it again.|`|JdqDauEDaa	The same thing my mother would have done with us: slap us.    I don't understand this send them to their room business. Bedrooms are goldmines these days. Kids have more fun watching tv and playing music in their bedrooms-what kind of punishment is that?|`|P5G3afbZaa	I shut up myself.|`|pdzfq7ojaa	I got in so much trouble for that!|`|5ViTUTyZaa	Tell him why it is wrong and send him to his room....duh!|`|5njBYJ1oaa	I would scream back, "IT'S MY MOUTH!"
zAKFuGGiaa	We go on vacations twice a year, one is always back to New England to visit family during the holidays and the other is either spring break or over the summer. We try to do something different every year. Last year we went to Greece in April and then ended up going back to New England to visit again in August because my baby sister was born in June! My daughter is only 3 years old and she's been to Italy, Greece, London, France, Aruba, Mexico and across the US! One place she hasn't been yet is Florida and Disney World (she's been to Disneyland because we live 40 minutes away from it though...) This year we don't have a ton of money so I think we are going to go down to Florida!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I love this question.    I grew up taking a family vacation every summer and want the same for my boys.    Since I've been married, we've traveled from Texas to Wisconsin to see my in-laws EVERY single time I take vacation time.      I want my boys to be close to their grandparents up north & visit them frequently... AND know what a vacation is.  How do I pull off both?!!    I asked a similar question once and I remember people recommending the in-laws meet us at our vacation destination.  I thought that was a pretty good idea.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	We like to go to fun, interesting places.  Sometimes we make the journey into the vacation, stopping at all kinds of places along the way.  Or, we'll go camping for a week, forcing lots of one on one family time.  Occasionally, we'll go on cousin vacations, all of my siblings & I taking our families & heading to the same destination.  Very rarely do we visit relatives as part of a vacation, just because we don't really have many that are 'vacation distance' away from us|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	We've rarely done fun vacations, simply because staying in a 1 room hotel rooms, with ones so young, is tough when they go to bed so early.    When we did, I searched and searched for web deals on 2 room condo, suites.  Even if at cheaper places, without the adjoining rooms, its not as much of a vacation.  We've tried to plan things with other young families too, to swap off, but never can get it coordinated.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I would LOVE to go to Hawaii....I always have since I was a little girl. Hubby promised me that one day we will get to go....for now i will settle for any nice beach. I've never been to a beach.|`|zQWNb6neaa	Every summer we take two vacations, one with my In-laws and another with the extended Murphy family- both only require a 3 hour drive. While those are great fun they leave no time or money for us to vacation by ourselves. We are planning on going to Mexico next year in April for my 30th Birthday (I told hubby he better d@mn well have me on a tropical beach with a jug of tequila for it) and to Disneyland in 3 years.|`|AA10811784	We're like you, our vacations always persist of going to visit relatives. And it's usually once a year, for a week. It would be nice to go somewhere else for a change. Although we do take mini vacations to Chicago or something for the day. Things like that, but never where we spend overnight or for longer than a day.     Maybe one of these days, when the kids are a little older, we could go somewhere nice together for a few days.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Most of ours are for fun/vacations cause any fam we have lives here and i dont really have much family on my side.  I live in Cali so we take them to all different parts like northern cal, San Diego, stuff like that.  Our big deal one is to go to Disney World in Florida and we're also planning to go on a cruise.  You should def take more vacations where its just fun, the kids will love it.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	We tend to go to Florida, we have a family condo on Longboat Key.  Our families are both close and don't involve trips to see them thankfully.  We are going to the beach in April and that will be our first trip since our honeymoon in April 2007.  We plan on having a vacation each year, at least, in the future though (if $$ allows each year).    Would love to go back to Mexico soon too.  Eventually Disney once Elyse is old enough to appreciate.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	How about talk to your parents    Plan a week to ten days trip  See if one will keep the children for a few days days and you and your husband could go some where and time for yourself    You will have a family vacation/family visit/ a day or two for couple    I do not know which is better  You could also take the family some where, depending on where the grandparents lives|`|8yTP3jO8aa	We haven't taken any family vacations... we're pretty good at being home bodies.  We did go visit my hubby's parents for Christmas, and since they live about 900 miles away, it was quite a trip.      We *would* like to vacation in the Dominican Republic, though.  My hubby lived there for 2 years and really wants to take me to see everything and meet everyone there.  I'm nervous, though, because the country is pretty much super touristy or super ghetto.  Areas where normal people live have limited electricity, limited plumbing, tons of great fruit but not so great meat, and unsafe drinking water.  But, it's a super cheap tropical island!|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	We don't really take many vacations. Before the baby was born my husband and I liked to go to the mountains in Tennessee for the weekend. We don't live very far from the Gulf Coast, so we sometimes do a weekend at the beach. The next big trip will probably be in a few years when we take Landon to Disneyworld.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	This month, we're going up to Vermont for the weekend. There's plenty to do; ice skating, skiing, snowboarding, tubing, snow mobiles (no matter how much they scare me), sledding, and my favorite, sitting by the warm fireplace. That would be a good vacation to look into, and you can keep it fairly cheap.    Every April, we try to go somewhere warm to escape the cold. If we're not able to go anywhere that year, we do a week of day trips. There are some really cheap vacations. You just got to do your research!|`|UTP1UBIRaa	We have family kind of far away too so most of our money goes towards those trips but we are planning our first "real" vacation around Easter to drive to Disneyworld (P.S. military offers are really great right now) and on our way back we will spend Easter with family.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	anywhere but here warm please|`|0QYIbn1saa	When Eli gets a little older, we are taking him to Disneyworld.  In the meantime, we decided we are going to spend a lot of summer weekends camping all over the midwest!  Cheap, easy, and fun :)    Both of our families live within an hour from us, it seems most of our vacation time is spent with them even though they are close!|`|nfzQkvqraa	We end up going to Bethany beach in Delaware every year.  It's only a 4 hour drive from our home and it's affordable.  Thankfully most of our family lives very local except a few aunts and uncles.  They come up and stay over the holidays every year though.  I'm glad I don't have to worry about visiting relatives when it comes to vacationing.|`|AA10772154	Our parents, now deceased, lived in Mexico City so we did not go there often as they came to see us in California-With our kids, we go camping to Big Sur. We have been doing this for years since they were 7 and 8. Now that they are 17, they still like to camping. - Ages range from 11 to 28 - Once  we all  went to Niagara Falls and once to Boston. It was a fantastic vacation for the entire family ! - Try it.|`|WirFwirLaa	All my family lives within a 20 mile radius so our vacations are always fun destinations! This past Summer we went to Williamsburg, VA which is very family friendly and a great place for history buffs (like my family) and Gatlinburg, TN. My husband's family is originally from Tennessee so he has spent alot of time there and we love the mountains! Both of these places are great to take family vacations!|`|HmZm1gbraa	We love to go to Martha's Vineyard.   It's a blast taking the ferry from Cape Cod...you really feel like you're "getting away".    Few people know the Vineyard has a campground.   This can be an affordable lodging option on an island that has charming B & B's and luxury hotels.    The Vineyard beaches are beautiful and Edgartown and Oak Bluffs have fun restaurants, interesting stores, lots of ice cream, fudge and sightseeing.       There's deep sea fishing, biking, sailing, wave runner rentals and more.
Y8ZmuWwgaa	I love Elsie, Scarlett, Isla, and Adelaide as a sibset- I'm not sure how to pronounce Adelais- I haven't heard it before. But if you're willing to switch it up a bit, Adelaide is so fresh and beautiful :)|`|JQ5M7WChaa	Hi!<br>  Elsie, Claire, Rose, Daisy<br>                      or<br>  Elsie, Claire, Rose, Scarlett.<br>  <br>  But what do you think about these names??<br>  Elsie, Claire, Julia, Camilla<br>  Elsie, Clarie, Savinna, Camilla<br>  <br>  Hey, Good Luck!<br>  |`|r01OAFnDaa	I LIKE SCARLETT......BUT....<br>  WHAT BOUT CRYSTAL, MADISON, HOLLY, KEYSHIA,JESSICA, JANET, BRITANNY , AMERICA, ASHLEY, SHANNON, REBECCA, ALISON, TRACY, SAMANTHA,BEVERLY ??|`|lMJbtEsBaa	To be honest, that's a list of names that seems a little too "try hard" and would generally evoke a response of rolled eyes, however you shouldn't really care as long as you like the names....|`|ePq2vUMmaa	I like Rose. If i had a daughter i would name her rose. I always thought of Scarlett as being a murderers name :D "Miss Scarlet, the knife, in the dining room.. bla bla bla " :) Cluedo is a good game :P|`|Y27cr7Ugaa	Elsie<br>  Scarlett<br>  Claire<br>  Rose<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  i think they all fit really well together. because they are all different,  theres no elsie daisy (same endings..) but i think adelais is too different from them all.. and i dont really like isla.|`|z2leU9Ogaa	i like Scarlett.<br>  i know sisters called Daisy and Elsie Bleu. <br>  <br>  i dont really like Adelais, daisy or elsie.<br>  but i like Scarlett. |`|ByWRzuuraa	I love Scarlett!!<br>  I hate Claire.<br>  <br>  I would choose Scarlett, Daisy & Isla. <br>  Lovely combination :)<br>  x|`|cqG0TWKpaa	I like Claire.<br>  <br>  Also Anais  (Anna-ees) is really beautiful for a french name. |`|AA10598531	I like them, if you switched Daisy with Rose. So it would be Elsie, Rose, Scarlett and Adelais.|`|2w1pmTpMaa	I love these names! I don't Adelais quite fits. Ada would work better, but Claire would also be lovely. Nice job!|`|IduMEIJsaa	I think a lot depends on the surname. My friend always wanted Penny but married Mr Wride....not good.  she had 2 boys anyway!|`|5KFBHpRPaa	I like Scarlett, and I actually changed my name to Claire|`|jiCPom35aa	If you are going to name a kid Scarlett, she better be a redhead.  |`|tkyAp1Ojaa	Elsie is OK but the rest seem like 'loser' names to me.<br>  |`|sXMI44Mvaa	all are nice|`|AA12358995	Rose, Claire or Isla are all better|`|6do2yt9vaa	I love Daisy!!|`|TiFLBWv4aa	i like Claire|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Adelaide would be nice. Scarlett is pretty too. :-)|`|AA11350988	I think Scarlett is a lovely name.<br>  Adelais is very original and would really stand out.<br>  <br>  Scarlett and Adelais are my choice :)<br>  Beautiful choice of names :]|`|zbjaBgyEaa	I think I prefer Elsie, Rose, Claire and Daisy.<br>  <br>  Scarlett and Adelais are too dramatic for me.  I tend to like simpler names.  They seem to be, as somebody else put, a bit too 'try hard'.  They're trying to be elegant, but falling a little flat.<br>  <br>  So I'd cute them and replace them with Rose and Claire, which are really sweet and classy and beautiful.  Effortlessly.|`|Ll4yjTa7aa	i like elsie and i like scarlett. i think daisy is pretty but makes the child sound a lil bit stupid. the last one is a bit old fashioned for my taste. i like spelling of Isla but not sure of the sound of it. claire is a bit dated and rose it a bit "old" <br>  <br>  how about Elsie, Evie and Ava :) they go well together.|`|ZPDa09YKaa	I like Elsie, Scarlett, Daisy and Isla|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I like Scarlett, Claire is ok, and Isla is ok|`|azIJoIdIaa	well i LOVe Elsie.<br>  <br>  i like the combo of Elise and Claire (but Clare)<br>  <br>  Elsie, Clare, Scarlett|`|fP3gToEiaa	Elsie and Rosie go well, other than that I don't really like the others that much.|`|sqso3NKKaa	Yes i like them, especially clare but i spell it that way as my daughter is called clare. There good strong names|`|32fe87baeed7e0c8aa8d991c71e5e195aa	No sorry I don't like any of those names.|`|6m6LjAVNaa	I love Elsie!<br>  Rose Clare and Scarlett is better in my opinion!|`|Xm24FpSlaa	keep scarlett and adelais, get rid of daisy and use rose or claire. <br>  <br>  idk how to pronounce isla|`|qmvJPRlVaa	I think they are all nice.|`|a6ed7acf264e14fc00a9f345b6f76010aa	i dont really like any of them. sorry
fm8mnTlkaa	I've looked at a few babyname questions today, and your list is way ahead of most of them, they are all contenders.<br>  <br>  I think I'ld choose Claire or Rosemary above the others, they are good names, with long history, and yat both have a bit of real feminity about them, without being prissy.<br>  <br>  Scarlett and Astrid ar next, I think I prefer Scarlett. <br>  <br>  Isla - simple, sweet name. <br>  <br>  Adelais - good name, different and thoughtful. Sounds to me like a 30+ year old, might be a bit odder when they are young? Shortening it is fine, and Daisy seems good. <br>  <br>  Of them all, I think I'ld give Tess a miss, nothing wrong with it, just your other choices are better. |`|9OKG0a5Baa	Scarlett - pretty 7/10<br>  Claire - classic and pretty 7/10<br>  Isla - not keen, i always think it sounds like a brand of mascara 2/10<br>  Adelais - very pretty 8/10<br>  Rosemary - not too keen but its ok, i prefer just rose 4/10<br>  Astrid - lovely 8/10<br>  Tess - cute and i agree teresa is not too nice, anastacia would be lovely.7/10|`|3OdCHAxPaa	Definitely not Astrid, or Anastasia - you can't call a child that!<br>  <br>  Claire is probably the best of those, or Adelais.<br>  I lke Rosemary if shortened to Rosa.<br>  <br>  |`|dVJOF4Bhaa	I like Scarlett the best it is really pretty and cute and please do not name your kid Astrid.<br>  and if you are looking for a middle name for Scarlett I think Isla would work pretty well.|`|uVvUfpk0aa	Definitely Scarlett and Isla.<br>  <br>  My favourite is Isla. Its pretty, pronouncable and the only one I know is Isla Fisher!<br>  <br>  So Isla is a definite good one =)|`|ByWRzuuraa	Scarlett & Isla :)<br>  x|`|MwdnCRy9aa	isla is beautiful reminds me of isla fisher<br>  <br>  isla clare is pretty|`|xoq83Yckaa	I don't how to pronouce Isla, Astrid sounds pretty awful but the rest are pretty nice.|`|p3ZQffuLaa	I really like the name Anastasia! Its a greek name and very beautiful.|`|VCjHXymcaa	Adelais, I like the way that name sounds, and that nick name is nice, great girl name.<br>  <br>  |`|T718vo8uaa	I really like Isla but personally prefer Isle?|`|Md4nhQJTaa	love Scarlett! Tess is cute too, not too fond of the rest though, I'd go with Scarlett :)|`|jNayBvH7aa	Tess (short for Testicle)<br>  <br>  they are all rubbish|`|5mvq8xhcaa	Isla is very nice...|`|5fIAggqjaa	ARE YOU TURKISH???|`|9ExQMhWCaa	i like Isla, not keen on others sorry.|`|VbGOCV0vaa	I only like Isla or Tess|`|7hv22wRhaa	Scarlett or Tess. I also personally think Bronte is fab for a girl|`|CqhVqX5laa	Sounds like you have an actress fetish. Are any of those family names?|`|u7o75zipaa	I love the name Claire! I think it's a name that would suit someone of any age, which is naturally a good quality.<br>  <br>  I also like Scarlett. It's unusual but I think it's pretty elegant.<br>  <br>  |`|Elxuvon8aa	I like Clair as Clara With middle name Leigh<br>  I do not like Isla  It is like is la Why not Tessa?<br>  Astrid as a middle would be cute I do not like Adelis as it is hard to pronounce from the spelling<br>  rosemary is very old fashioned but nice and will grow with her.<br>   I do not like Scarlett or Charlotte <br>    |`|eBKJRmEgaa	Adelais, Isla and Astrid. <br>  <br>  I think Isla will become popular in the future, so out of the three I would choose Adelais because it is the most unique.<br>  <br>  Anastasia is good, but I think Tess is a bit of a stretch.|`|doLyOac0aa	Claire is to boring,<br>  <br>  Scarlett to Chavvy,<br>  <br>  Isla, Nice,<br>  <br>  Adelais, Sorry don't like,<br>  <br>  Rosemary Pretty,<br>  <br>  Astrid, Awful<br>  <br>  Tess, No,|`|UJaCObdyaa	Scarlett - love<br>  Claire - too old sounding<br>  Isla - not bad<br>  Adelais - no way<br>  Rosemary - fat old lady<br>  Astrid - love<br>  Tess - love this as a name<br>  <br>  Suggestions:<br>  Scarlett Tess<br>  Scarlett Astrid<br>  Astrid Tess<br>  Astrid Scarlett<br>  |`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Astrid is a great name, so is Isla.

I think it's really gorgeous.  It's one of my favourite girls' name.  So that's my favourite.<br>  <br>  I don't really like Scarlett too much.  It's got to much drama going on for me.  Also seems really faddish. <br>  <br>  Rosemary is cute though.  I like that.  Very nice.|`|x0J8S5sWaa	My favorites are:<br>  <br>  Scarlett, Isla and Adelais.<br>  <br>  Claise, Anastasia and Rosemary are okay names. I don't like Tess or Astrid.|`|c2073ec3afb9b236f32e07810223f223aa	Rosemary is so beautiful|`|cFUFt1uMaa	I like Scarlett and Claire :D|`|cz4GQJpbaa	If I had to choose out of those I would go for Scarlett|`|FKApExj2aa	My favourite name here is Scarlett, but i also love Adelais, Claire and <br>  Rosemary.<br>  <br>  I chose Scarlett because it sounds so elegant, and it is really beautiful...<br>  <br>  Claire is lovely, but I would only use it as a middle name. I also might be tempted to spell it like "Clare." <br>  <br>  Isla is an unusual name but it flows well and i would probably use it as a middle name again.<br>  <br>  Adelais is beautiful. It may be unusual, but that doesn't stop it from being lovely!<br>  <br>  Rosemary is a gorgeous floral name. It flows really well, and you could shorten it to Rosie, Rose or as you say Romey!<br>  <br>  Astrid is probably my least favourite name. It just doen't sound as flowing and pretty as the others...=)<br>  <br>  Tess is great as a nickname, maybe as a shortened version of Theresa, Tessa, Tesla/Tessla, Tracy or Esther?  Anastasia is a great name on it's own, you could shorten it to Annie, Ann, Anna or Stacey?<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! =)|`|YSHOAkc1aa	To the idiot above...Scarlett is an adjective not a noun...freaking moron. Plus its cool...anyway.<br>  <br>  Scarlett- awesome<br>  Claire- cute, more for a middle name<br>  Isla- Cute like Isla Fisher haha :)<br>  Adelais- A little too old fashioned/country for me<br>  Rosemary- super cute<br>  Astrid- nah...just not as pretty compared to the others<br>  Tess - Ohhh would love this to be short for Anastasia..gorgeous name.<br>  <br>  I think my fav out of all of them is definitely Scarlett or Rosemary. haha yeah and since you like a lot of actresses name, do you think yo u'd like the name Sienna? Its one of my favorites, yours are great tho :)
2arZOZWgaa	Be happy that you have two daughters. Adopt a  son.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Cross your fingers and hope. You have about a 50% chance of getting lucky.|`|viwq8ldvaa	What?   Any adult is intelligent enough to know that you don't get to choose your children's gender.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	There is no way that you can get a baby boy. It's all genetics and we have no control over that.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	There is no way!  If there was anything I could do I'd do it next time because I want a girl and a boy!|`|A89ezcg5aa	Um, concieving is like pulling straws. Some say a diet high in fiber (bananas, ceral, etc) makes it more likely for the egg to be fertilized by a male sperm, but it is not proven at all.|`|kT7GVOosaa	ummm... pray I guess... there is no way to get a boy just by wanting to. there is nothing proven to give you a boy every time.|`|qIHTmouhaa	There are myths out there that if you do it in a certain sex position it will most likely be a boy. Like I said those are just myths there's nothing you can do or know to make your next baby a boy. I hope you guys do get the boy you want and i'll pray for you.|`|yMfJNatnaa	Well, the mom has nothing to do with the sex of the baby  it's determined by the male partner's sperm. Aside from having an amniocentesis during the first trimester to check the sex of the fetus, I'm not aware of any reliable method of choosing your baby's gender. Some scientists think you can influence your baby's sex and many old wives' tales suggest things to try, but none has been proved in rigorous testing as far as I know.    You could solve this problem as a friend of mine did, by adopting a male child. She also had 2 girls and wanted a boy.|`|xzh8r0jIaa	well its up to the guy to determine the sex of baby, so when you have sex just have him concentrate real hard on having a boy and maybe it will work out that way for you|`|bL3rzrEYaa	Well it's really up to God, but I have read that the closer to your ovulation that you conceive the more chance of having a boy. This is because girl  sperm are slower & live longer, and the boys are faster & die faster, so if you conceive way before you ovulate, the girl sperm have a chance to get there & the boy sperm die by the time you ovulate, but if you conceive right around the time you ovulate, the girls don't have a chance to get there but the boys do.    Hope I didn't confuse you lol. I tried to explain the best I could.|`|vfFwkUKSaa	you has to do it on a full moon.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	you dont decide, nature does.    unless you go to a specialist.    they can get a male sperm in the egg for you. other than that it is just chance girl.|`|cjqKMjWnaa	there is no proven method of getting a boy, but i've heard that the X-sperm are slower, but more durable and the Y-sperm are faster but more sensitive.  so, i've heard of people doing vinegar douches right after sex to kill the Y-sperm (i do NOT recommend this) and having sex early in their cycle to try to get a girl.  on the same note, i've heard that having sex later in your cycle increases your chances for a boy because your egg is lower and the Y-sperm don't have to go as far.  i've also heard that an orgasm for the mother helps the chances of a boy.  this is of course not scientific and may have just been made up by some woman who wanted to convince her husband that she needed to have an orgasm haha.    we have 2 girls also and are always asked by friends, family, etc .. "are you gonna try for a boy??"  and i always respond - i'm not going to try for anything ... if we have another, it will be because we want another CHILD, not because we want a certain gender and i give you that same advice.  make sure you want another child, regardless of gender, before getting pregnant again because even with all of the methods, etc in the world, there's never a guarantee.|`|nnKtP60Oaa	it's your husbands genes that decide what sex you have. you can't do home remedies to get a boy. you can go to a fertility specialist and they can do the procedure to fertilize the egg with male sperm...|`|k4SlMtYHaa	It is the luck of the draw.  It just depends on which sperm meets the egg.  It is the mans sperm that determines it.  There is no way to genetically engineer something like that.  Sorry.|`|4WNeBRjVaa	Goggle Shettlers Method! It's proven to do the trick!!|`|cj32tL1Yaa	Adopt, it's the only way to "guarantee" a boy.

1RwZZ2aPaa	Oh yeah, that girl on the Tyra Banks show? I know, dude. That was really bad.     It's amazes me when people say "All teen girls are pregnant." Do you see pregnant teens everywhere you look? Then not all of them are pregnant.     I don't think giving your child away is selfish at all though. It I think it's responsible as how some teens realize that they don't know how to take care of a child. So adoption can be the better choice in some cases.    Well, you seem like you have a good head on your shoulders and your trying. Best of luck to you.|`|7qAlZRHmaa	I agree with you I was 14 when i got on drugs 15 I got off drugs cuz i got pregnate now here i am 2 and half years clean and I have a wonderful daughter I did quite school but you are your own self.

Me? I really don`t care if a teen gets pregnant. But I guess people think it teaches kids that having sex is ok. Some people can be really prejudice.     Anyways. Congrats on the Baby sweetie!  Ignore all the nasty comments people are leaving.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	"Teenagers cant get good paying jobs"    "Ive been trying to get a job before I was pregnant"    I learn all I need to right here.   So just prove us wrong.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well my opinion of teenage moms comes from what i saw in high school. girls from the ages of 14 through 17 having sex with a bunch of different guys and getting pregnant and either having the child and neglecting them because they want to  live their lives or using abortion as an option. however with that said that's my opinion on the teenage moms that I know personally. not ALL teenage moms are bad moms. i know quite a few mothers that got pregnant when they were in their teens and they are some of the best moms i know. i think that people group other people in one category although they don't know each individual person. just like people are racist. not all black people, or muslim people or who ever is bad. not all teen moms are bad. some have their head on straight... like you. and the ones who are responsible (like you) should be commended however there is just that stigma that is attached to teen parenting that it's just not that easy for people to get older. im sorry that people may say mean things or treat you differently or badly because you're a teen mom but for myself personally i say way to go. you seem very Intelligent and seem to have your head on straight. i think you'll make a great mom.|`|TffCSzHxaa	Just because your pregnant and you're not married, or you are under 20 doesn't mean that you are going to live on the streets with no money, and your boyfriend will leave you. You can still be a pregnant teen and have a wonderful life! You can go to college, get a good career, and have an amazing family. And I say congrats to you for the things you've decided. You're trying to get a job, you aren't getting an abortion, and you will keep the baby. I say you are on the right track, and you're doing great  from what you've written about yourself.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	It's seems as though you souly wrote this to defend yourself. Don't feel like you have to do that. I for one, am not a big fan of girls getting pregnant at a young age, just because you miss out on so much. I got pregnant at 19 and even then it changed a lot. Don't get me wrong being a mom is better than anything else in the world, but it's so much tougher when you are young. I must say that you sound very mature and it seems as though you will make a great mother. Don't let anything anyone says discourage you. I wish you, your boyfriend, and ya'll baby the best.|`|hswTS1jVaa	Part of what you say is right, but giving your child for adoption is absolutely not selfish.  That is actually the most selfless thing that you can do because you are giving your child a better life than what you can provide.  I'm not saying that is what is best in your situation but is is not selfish.|`|TU7dLOP8aa	I'm sorry, but pregnancy just doesn't "happen".  You let it happen by having sex....period.  Whenever you have sex, protected or not, you take that risk.  If you weren't ready, then why have sex?  Because you can't live without it, because you're uncool if you don't?  Been there, done that.      Anyways, to answer your question, people's opinions about teenage pregnancy exist because they too were once teenagers and they KNOW how immature and irresponsible children can be.  It's just a fact....I'm mature at 30....and was seriously IMMATURE at 16.  If I had a baby at 16....wow.  I also thought my boyfriend and I were going to grow up happily together and get married.........nope.  Never happened.  Teenagers have no idea what the real world is like and they won't be able to know what it is like until they grow up.      I applaud you for raising the baby....but be prepared for the hardest journey of your life.  Even at 30, both my husband and I have jobs that pay $80,000 a year combined and we still struggle....and yes, we have a child.  I hope you have a great support system around you.|`|CrTmA5TUaa	Your so right , so many people are gonna give you sh*t about this question .I already know but who cares they are a bunch of uptight people that come on here and tell other people how they should live their life .    They really don't know . You sound responsible and mature , keep doing what you're doing ! :)  Your boyfriend sounds great by the way , you're lucky to have him   most teenage guys do leave .     I think you're going to be an awesome mom .  Don't let others get you down . You sound like a girl that doesn't care what other people think , that's good ! Ha you have an attitude like if you don't like me ...get over it |`|E6T9DPT9aa	Well, yeah, to be honest, the TV just practically lies! Reality is a lot different than what the TV says.    Teenagers can actually have successful relationships. They can be in love and can be mature.    Many adults believe that they can't!    I hope all the best for you! You seem sensible. Hope you and your boyfriend have a happy future together with the bab :)    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:    EDIT:    You are really pretty :D  x  x
NXVgwPcZaa	Well if you wanted to go with the whole "J" idea... I would go with:<br>  Jordyn, Jaelyn, Jaedyn<br>  Jordyn, Jaelyn, Jaidalyn<br>  <br>  If you perhaps wanted to give them all different letters... I would go with:<br>  Jordyn, Aubriana, Juliana<br>  Jordyn, Alyssa, Kaelyn<br>  <br>  If you wanted to have the twins have the same letter in their name.. I would go with:<br>  Jordyn, Aubriana, Aliyana<br>  Jordyn, Aubrianah, Aliyanah<br>  Jordyn, Audriana, Aubriana<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  And congratulations to you and your family.|`|5diWrdtKaa	For me personally, I like McKena and Juliana because each twin needs to be different. I know somebody that had twins and she named them Taylor and Taylyn. These names for me seem the best for the girls. /you want them to be unique, not carbon copies!|`|JtlOuKJnaa	Aubriana and Jaelyn.  Defiantly.  They are both cute and beautiful names.  Congrats|`|JfoZOHEZaa	Jaelyn and Juliana are pretty. I love the name Jaelyn. Very pretty.|`|kRqm2X2Baa	I like Aubriana and Jaelyn. I think it is best to give each twin their own unique name. I've known a number of twins who hated that their parents kept them as carbon copies of each other.|`|ByWRzuuraa	Hmm i like Jaelyn & Makena.<br>  Or Jaelyn & Brianna even though they arent on your list.<br>  But i do love the name Jaelyn :)<br>  x|`|43af73c5e88c213db3e3b2abf87c8bdcaa	Jaidalyn and Juliana|`|dVraPVrVaa	Jaelyn or Jaidalyn.  Jaidalyn is really cute and I love the spelling of it.|`|mu6soUDeaa	I like Jaidalyn and Juliana the best. The rest are cute too.|`|QeCagPHraa	Oh, I like Jaidalyn and Aaliyah. Pretty names!|`|EhimGXRYaa	jaelyn and aaliyah<br>  all really great names though<br>  CONGRADS!!!|`|iwYu32N2aa	 Arbriana and Jaelyn are very cute...<br>   Congrats and good luck|`|sHzSYL5raa	McKenna And Aaliyah! <3|`|nwi9Fv9Baa	?Makena and Aaliyah?<br>  <br>  I'd avoid any names that start with J (b/c of Jordyn) and any two names that start w/ A (for ex. Aubriana and Aaliyah)  My reasoning being that they would sound too similar to another sister's name, it is better for them to have a more individual name from their other sisters.|`|UCkkrhdhaa	I like Makena & Juliana but I'm not a big fan of Jaelyn, Jaidalyn, or Aaliyah. Aubriana is okay, but I like it better when it is shortened to Aubrey.<br>  so my favorite set would either be Juliana & Makena or Makena & Aubrey.|`|bTLFOlynaa	I prefer Aubriana and Makena but Aubriana and Jaelyn is pretty too.  But Jaelyn and Jordyn are a bit similar so on that note maybe Aubriana and Aliyah, although I prefer Makena over this! Good luck!|`|GUE42quiaa	i would go with jaidalyn and juliana. you know, kinda wanna keep the "J's" going and plus their both really pretty names
mxIYhkAnaa	la ilaha ill Allaah.<br>  <br>  In my marriage we don't use any thing to prevent pregnancy. I give breastfeeding fultime and it still protected me. After the first it took 2years to get pregnant agian and after the second i am still not pregnant (15 months) <br>  <br>  My husband buys every month a test. simply my period hasn't come back yet, because of the breastfeeding... <br>  <br>  Or you have to pay for those stuppid pills or for the test. Or feel blessed that you could receive a pregnancy... ?? Soebhan Allaah. |`|W0KQTXrvaa	aren't you ashamed to have that avatar? do you know how many women are killed because of that piece of work?|`|AA11947878	Sounds like what my friend went through, but she had her pills adjusted and was fine.  <br>  <br>  I however need a very low dose, and within the month I stop taking them I am back on track.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, I think every woman's body is different. And if you feel like you need to see your Dr. by all means make and apt. or at least give the office a call and talk with an assistant and they can tell you if you need to see the Dr.<br>  <br>  Hope you get back on track soon.|`|jZ6Ptkafaa	it depends on your body i came off the pill injection and i was really messed up for about 6 months, if you are worried each month just do a pregnancy test at the doctors which is free you just don't get an instant result.<br>  have you considered any other form of b/c? find out where there is a free condom service

q4EXFhV7aa	Hi,  We adopted through foster care. We were willing to accept any age, race, sex, etc. We were placed with a bi-racial 1 year old boy. Upon learning of our child's background, we were told that he had a large extended family, but that none of them wanted him SOLELY because of his race. The black side didn't want a white-ish child and the white side wasn't willing to accept a black child. Neither parent was capable of caring for him, so he was placed into foster care. Upon bringing him home, my family was surprisingly supportive. I expected them to be happy for us, but they went out of their way to make him feel like he is a part of the family. My husband's family, however, has been a disaster. Prior to the adoption, they were SO excited. Thrilled. Learning that he was bi-racial, they made no real comments at first. The day before we brought him home, my husband's mother said some things about black children and foster children that isn't repeatable within this forum. She never said she was sorry, she never said that she didn't mean what she said, so we never have had a relationship with her since that day....which is difficult as she lives right next to us. She ignores us and STILL to this day--a year later---tells other people in our town about us adopting a black baby from foster care (again, her words are far different from what I am posting here).   Older white people sometimes ignore him when he talks to them or says 'Hi'. Young black women ignore him or give me ugly looks when they see us without my husband. At least once a month, someone will discuss the likelihood of him becoming the next _______ (Insert ANY bi-racial politician, sports star, entertainer here)....as though his skin color suddenly makes him the next Tiger Woods or Barack Obama.   Most people love him and think he is absolutely perfect, but we have had to sever all ties with some people....difficult, but necessary. There is no way I will continue relationships with people who degrade our child or who want nothing to do with him.|`|TTS9cvUmaa	My Aunt in the U.S at being told of the great news (we are finally parents via adoption) was more keen on getting the ethinicity of the child. Sounding disappointed, did not congratulate me, said in that racist tone * so its a Mexican child...hmmm*. I was stumped !! I cut all contacts with her henceforth !    Then another grand Aunt In-law in the U.S said something nasty about our child's birth mother and "how could she abandon this beautifull child?"  Not a statement but expecting me to start giving her gossip and trashing our child's birth mom. I told her i remember with quivering voice (was about to cry) that its our personal business.(since we don't talk back to elders in our society.     Back in India nobody has ever said anything stupid to my face yet.     But another 29 y.o adoptee IRL in India,(who's become a good friend) told me i think i am "amazing" to adopt. And she feels so much gratitude for her own mom. We got into this whole conversation where i told her that i am sure her mom feels equally gratefull to her for being her child just like how i feel about my child for loving and taking me for her mom.|`|6orvPrLLaa	we live in a racist county. adoption is not immune from it's effects. many have attempted to "deal with the race issues"; yet, only do so when it directly impacts their own lives. IMO    regarding your grandmother's situation: this is what many in the BSE were instructed to do. the belief was that nurture would trump nature.    as we see, both of these issues (and many others) make adoption quite complex.    i applaud you for "venturing deeper."|`|E7MgO2pZaa	Well, before my amom adopted me, she fostered. Two of her foster children were interracial. She took them to church and had to deal with people snubbing them because they were mixed and also because they were foster children. These people were all small town folks who were not very cultured, and could be classified as racists.     When I first started opening up to my fiance he did not know that adoptees face so many challenging emotional issues. He was not aware that our OBCs are denied to us or that we are denied rights to our vital records. But he has quickly come to understand and really think about and be open to the idea that it is more than rainbows and butterflys. There are people out there in the general community though, that refuse to believe that adoption does any harm. These are people who have not experienced any of the negative side effects since they are usually not at all connected to adoption. This to me is much like when people who have not experienced racism try to deny that it still exists.
xue72D76aa	There is an opening to the cervix that gets plugged with mucus.  This is to ensure that nothing can enter up into the cervix and cause infection for the baby.  As you get closer to delivering, the cervix begins to slightly dilate, which can cause the mucus plug to come loose.  If the mucus plug comes loose early in a pregnancy, your body will form a new one to safeguard the baby.  If you lose it near the time of delivery, you will not form a new one.  The mucus plug looks like snot (gross I know, but very descriptive and something everyone is familiar with!).  It may or may not be tinged with blood.|`|942758fd1ed500339f1a1e8db65b2d27aa	your mucous plug keeps your cervix closed I think. It can fall out at any time but doesn't necessarily mean labor is coming because it can 'renew itself. With one of my pregnancies, mine fell out 2 weeks before the babyw as born.|`|em8A42Bqaa	I've been wondering the same thing.  I have read several people say that they lose it at about 31-36 weeks and it doesn't mean that you are going in labor.  I also read that it looks like snot and may or may not have blood in it.  People don't make a big deal out of it, but my doctor hasn't said anything to me either.|`|aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	The mucous plug is what protects your baby form outside bacteria.  It is a gooey plug that forms over your cervix, and it stays there until you start to dilate.  Once you start to lose your plug, you can lose it in clumps, or all at one time.    It looks plegmy... pretty much like snot.  I know this is gross, but when you blow your nose when you have a cold?  That's what it looks like.  It can also be streaked with brownish bits, which are old blood.    Usually you start to lose your plug about 36 weeks or so, but maybe earlier or later.    Here's a good link for you that has lots of info:  http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornb...
iZk9jEBpaa	I know EXACTLY how you feel!     It hurts like hell to think people don't want you around doesn't it?   Well my mum told me to keep my head up, don't shaft them because if you do well it's not helping anyone. Act normal around them and they will realize how nice you are and include you.|`|cypZ0ykXaa	it does feel bad when friends do so. just convey them that u r feeling bad. may b they hav an answer|`|AA10309649	Yes, 100%. That's really not fair.   When that happens to me, I silently even cry sometimes. It hurts so much when people do that. That's the thing about girls. Everyone has "clicks" and they always leave someone out.|`|HOdblqIkaa	I would be upset if I were you afterall these are the people you invite when you go out so they should have no reason to not want to invite you. I'd just mention that your a little hurt you haven't been invited but don't make it into a big fight. Maybe they assume since your leaving you have other things to do|`|Sjb4jauxaa	you totally have a right to be upset|`|tmh42R6Caa	You have the right to be upset.  However, you may not want to stress about it since you're leaving the school anyway.  They're overtly leaving you out.  They're not the friends you want anyway - be glad you found out now.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	You have a right!    Ask one of them friends that you are closest to, why they are leaving you out!    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|MFwPwftnaa	yes you totally have the right to be upset.  i know i would be.|`|xZvzLztZaa	You absolutely have a right to be upset.    Sounds like they aren't as good of friends as they seem.|`|oqUci1MNaa	you have a right to be upset  ask them about it  i knoe exactly how you feel.. same thing happened to me    if they say it was an accident and they forgot about you, then next time they go out (if they do in the next week) make sure you are invited|`|Y0ffbZKraa	You have the right to be upset, but you also have to see things from their point of view. The only way you will be sure about what they feel is if you ask them, but to me it sounds like there's a good chance they're trying to get used to the idea of you not being there with them. It happens all the time with groups of friends when one friend is moving away, the others start to distance themselves. Not because they don't care, but because they DO care and it hurts to see the friend who's moving. Talk to them.|`|xRcqusUaaa	hell yea you have the right to be mad and they not yo friends, friends wouldnt do **** like that to you|`|AA11327039	I would be upset too.  Maybe they think you are too busy packing or something.|`|9PptaFdXaa	Yes of course you have the right to be upset.  But in your friends' defense, they are probably distancing themselves from you so it won't be so difficult to be apart.
Amkmles0aa	just have fun|`|AtJgXB59aa	be urself|`|2v60zG5Faa	maybe turn up like u would at ure old school so if u usually wear makeup then don't on ure first day cos if u do then u could make friends with the wrong people (people who wear amkeup everyday)|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Girls will be catty and mean at many times but if that does happen, tell someone you trust. That way someone can know what your going through.    Just remember, it's okay not to feel like talking to anyone. If you don't want to say hi, you don't have to. Wait until your comfortable talking to other girls.     But if you happen to feel like saying hi just do so. If your going to lunch and you see a group of people you want to sit with just say hello and ask if you can sit with them. It's kind of hard to say no anyway. I'd feel really bad if I rejected someone who wanted to sit with me.    And don't let it stress you out. If it does remind yourself that it's a tough time right now and soon enough you'll make some friends.     Good luck!  :-)|`|3LvlXDOAaa	we get a lot of new people in our school and i really love the ones who say hello first. so my advice is if you're going into class or something say hello and ask someone can you sit with them in class or at lunch.    the most important thing i'd say is don't be shy but friendly and if you've no clue what they're talking about ask about it. show interest in others and they tend to like you more!    and remember if a girl is bitchy or mean to you she's only one girl don't be put off.    good luck! xx|`|5IN0AjxOaa	Do confident, But not Cocky.  Their not gonna mess with ou,  If the don't think it will get to you.  Don't wait for people to sa stuff to you.  Randomly say little things to people like;  Wow, that bracelet's cute.  Or, your hair looks so pretty.    Be the super nice girl,  Everyone always likes her.|`|zlQo7WMoaa	I'm not going to lie, all girls schools are tough places because they are so bitchy. I am 14 and I am also in year 9. I go to a school in London a state comprehensive but I'm guessing a private school will be much nicer and the people are probably a lot more friendly and supportive. I would just try and make friends the best you can and talk to as many people as you can, so that it will be unlikely that you'll get bullied, best of luck.|`|EhJlgKLAaa	be yourself and try to talk to people. i transferred schools when i was 15 and my problem was that i didn't talk. i am very shy and the only way i started making new friends is that guys started talking to me. and since there will be no guys just talk and be yourself. good luck hun! i know it's hard!|`|6lSbmXunaa	Hey Girl!    First, I want to say good luck. Switching schools seems scary, but everyone I know who's ever switched schools loves the fresh start it gives you so take advantage of it! Don't be shy and worried about what other girls think, because although some of them might be catty, a lot of girls will welcome you with an open heart as long as you seem friendly.  It might seem scary, but introduce yourself to everyone around you.  Be friendly.  My one friend who came from a Catholic school did that on her first day and she has so many friends now, including me because she introduced herself! It'll be worth it.  Also, genuine compliments do wonders when meeting new people.  If you tell the girl next to you "Hey, your shirt is so cute!" It will not only make you seem friendly, but might also start a conversation.  She might respond with "Thanks! I got it at (store name here) Shopping is like my hobby!"  Be nice to everyone, no matter how "popular" or "nerdy" they look. You'd be surprised what happens when you go into a new place with an open heart!
dDVAUA9saa	Felicia -cute, but I wouldn't choose it - like it because it's unique  Kyra - love it but not the spelling - my niece is Kiera  Logan- it's okay for a boy  Rhianna - hate it - I knew a little girl with this name and she was the Devil!

Those are my favs from your list.  They are not extremely common yet they are pronouncable and sound great.    I would especially pair Rhianna Blaire as a first and middle name.|`|LQetTtM9aa	Felicia -- Not my favorite; I know a girl w/ this name, and she's a you-know-what, so I'm biased against this name.    Kyra -- This is cute; I would never choose it, but it's likable, lol.    Logan-- I know a girl w/ this name, but I prefer it attached to a boy.    Rhianna-- I like this name...it's different, but not made-up.    Morgan-- This is such a cute name!    Freela-- Umm...no.  Not for me.    Rose-- I like Rose used as a middle name more than I do as a first name; otherwise, I think of Rose off of Golden Girls, or Rose on Two and a Half Men, lol.  Both kinda strange.    Blaire--Pretty!  I like this name; hubby doesn't, though :-(    Jordan--I prefer Jordan for a boy, personally.    Michaela--Love Mchaela!  So pretty!    Hailey--Not overly fond of this name, I think it's because I know several girls w/ this name; it's too common anymore.    Cameron--I like this name more for guys.  I wouldn't use it for a girls name, but I do like it for a boy.    Courtney--Eh, it's okay.  I know some Courtneys, and a couple of them are, let's just say, odd...    Levanya--This one's cool.  Not my style, but I still think it's pretty!    Quinn-- Not fond of Quinn for a girl unless it would be the middle name.

xqgE4CrBaa	I like Wet 'n' Wild for that age range and older because it's pretty, fresh, and cheap. www.wetnwildcosmetics.com|`|d8KnXFoLaa	I was about 7 when I wanted to wear makeup. I just started out with claires things. They are pretty cheap. It is not extreme make up it is light.|`|feE0inXTaa	Show for your sister pics of stars,how they're look without makeup =]  and how it's unhealthy for a little girl's face.....|`|X448ZWr2aa	Carmex, Nail Polish, and Webkinz Body Spray. That's the only make up a lil 7 year old girl should be wearing.|`|G2auAv1Saa	A 7 year old shouldn't wear makeup and the parents shouldn't make any kind of deal that involved her making a specific dance team. That is awful to put stress on her like that. It is also awful the 10 year old knows about makeup testing on animals and is opposed to it, should we test it on babies?   What is going on in this family?    edit: Krissy, activism is always good and I do encourage it- you apparently know nothing of me or my parenting style so you should just stop right there. I do think her knowledge of it may be skewed since the alternative to no animal testing would be human testing. Putting the value of an animal over a human is not activism, it is ignorance.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	for playtime right? Little girls dont wear makeup in public unless they are playing dressup..|`|Jzi3YCScaa	A 7 year-old wearing make-up? Wooooooow. That's stupid. Lip gloss is fine but blush,powder? You doin too much.|`|NYZ8ebD6aa	Wet N Wild (walgreens) or NYC(walmart) are cheap ranges of make up, and the best for younger kids to get into the proper useage of makeup, i work as a beauty advisor, Wet n Wild works best, its more gentle on the skin. but if you're looking for something thats not tested on animals, youll have to spend more money and go to the body shop and get something..    She's not to young for make up, but its all about how you're applying it, like you said, something light and nothing over powering is ok, but being a dancer, i have alot of dancers that come in at age 5 and look like clowns, so make sure you're keeping it minimum,..    Reading down and commenting on mrs herrea's comment, its great that a 10 year old is smart enough to know about the issues out there in todays society, its better that then her glued to a damn tv or video games all day, i give her plus points for being aware of the harm on our furry friends..|`|2XNVys7Eaa	if she is serious about wearing real makeup,shes to young.if she just wants to wear colorful blush or lipgloss,thats fine,she might need something like Lipsmacker and I heard Covergirl is "mom approved",so yeah.hope it helps!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	pretty name! a little lip gloss is okay!|`|a94257e28d6b37ec0048499a1cda4a58aa	7 year old children are too yourg for makeup.|`|7geLpG6Oaa	She's 7, that's insane.

Blush...eh...not so much. Powder..I didn't wear powder until i was 13 or older! I think you should just stick to lip gloss or lip balm.

XTDeAfTqaa	As an adopted child the three big things I wanted to know were:    1. My Bio-parents Medical history  2. My ethnicity (100% Polish)  3. If I had any biological siblings (1 Sister and a Brother who died as an infant)    There were a couple of other interesting facts I found out about after I met them but those were the big 3 for me.  All the men in my Bio-family have musical talent, we all like to hunt, most of us are Veterans and we all had jobs that were Construction related whether White Collar or Blue Collar.  Politically we were on different pages.  I have no want or need to see them again.

The 3rd reason would be for medical history.|`|7aCH91ISaa	1) Medical History  2) To know your culture/heritage  3) For a sense of self-worth.

CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, whattoexpect.com is a great online version of the bestselling book What to Expect When You Are Expecting.

Also another really good route to go to get free literature on healthy eating habits and foods to avoid is your local WIC office (you don't have to be in the program for them to give you literature). They gave me tons of useful info for maintaining a healthy diet as well as unsafe foods.|`|IkuZj0Lbaa	You need to be under the care of a doctor. You shouldn't trust what you read on websites.

XPYa9qkjaa	How weird! My little sister has brown hair and green eyes and her names Rhianna Lol although she wasn't named after the singer because shes 9 and Rihanna the singer hasn't been famous for 9 years so unoo! I like the names Tegan or Morgan Nicole. <br>  But Rhiannas a cute name! Not just saying that but at the end of the day its your choice what you name her! And i think adopting someone is amazing so congratulations.  |`|NSTdVLjhaa	I agree with the majority who say they don't like the name Rhianna. Maybe it's due to the pop-star; maybe I just don't care for it!<br>  <br>  If you like the "anna" names, you might consider Annabelle, Annabella, or Annalaura. Also, Annalisa, which is spelled a host of different ways.<br>  <br>  I would advocate you keep the name Madison and make it her middle name - that way you can call your girls by different names, but they both get to use it. If she came to you with a middle name, you might consider just flipping the order of her two names.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for other names that go with Madison, you might also consider a theme... such as naming your newest daughter after a different locale that doubles as a girl's name (Sydney, Georgia, Florence, London, Savannah, etc.)|`|PHoK7foOaa	Yeah, I agree with others who don't like Rhianna. Yet, I have to disagree with the people who suggested you go with something similar to Madison. In my opinion a nickname of Madison wouldn't be fair to either child.<br>  I really liked the choice Annalise. That's a pretty name and still incorporated the Anna part of Rhianna.|`|JLAW7kKSaa	I don't think Rhianna fits into your classic names you have chosen.<br>  At three months old you shouldn't really have a problem renaming her, she's very young. Hmm....How about:<br>  Madelyn/Madeline<br>  Anna<br>  Katelyn/Caitlyn<br>  Ariel<br>  Ruby<br>  Abigail(Abby)<br>  Aleah<br>  Elizabeth/Elisabeth<br>  Avery<br>  I think any of these names would fit nicely with Madison and Frederick. Good Luck and God Bless!!|`|PN1cGUOmaa	Hey if you leave her name as madison thats bad coz my names m adeleine and she'll get called maddie like me and its so annoying being called MAD maddie all the time. so how about Zoe or Honey because of her brown hair or... India or lily or Isabelle. Molly. nothing like too traditional like Elizabeth or Anne. Maybe Siennna.Freya.Lola.Nicole.Megan(or Meghan).Shannon.or Ruth (a glorious name!)|`|F68X1HJ3aa	Margeret, Lindsey, Julie, Cathrine, Marissa, Nadine, Helen, Nia, Esther, Paulette, Lucille, Dafnee, Lauren, Joanne, Alexis, Ashley, Emma, Scarlette, Sage, Grace, Brooka, Hailey, Savannah,Jasmine, Addison, Gabriella, Carly, Paula, Anna, Samantha, Tamara, Christina, Kaitlyn, Francine, Rennay, Tiara, Rachel<br>  <br>  <br>    I cant think of anymore right now but,hope this works out for you.|`|vTpl0mIIaa	I wouldn't go with Rhianna just because Rhianna (the pop star) is sort of a thing or something right now, and that's what a lot of people would think of.<br>  I really like Annalise.<br>  I think it would flow well also with the other babies names in your family. Good luck!|`|AA11986363	If you like Rhianna and dont want it to sound too much like the singer try Rihannon or Rhiannon both of those are cute and are similar to the name you want, just with a twist on the end. You could always call her Anna on Rhi |`|VQlkO7lqaa	Is this a baby or a dog?  If a baby, I'd keep the name and maybe add a new middle name.  My daughter was adopted and that is what we did, she liked having the name from her birthmom and one from her mom too.|`|sp6DJCKvaa	How about using the last part of her original name SONnie (Sunny) or MAdISon Maisy/Maisey.  I prefer Maisy as it will still be part of her name.  Good luck.|`|W9ZuBC0Zaa	I like Rhiannon better than Rihanna :)<br>  sounds better<br>   Also i think Ella and Nina are nice names :)|`|K1PH26TPaa	You should keep Madison as at least her middle name.. after all, it is her name :)<br>  <br>  I like<br>  <br>  Lilly<br>  Holly (Hollie)<br>  Molly<br>  Kara<br>  Alyssa|`|vap6okjSaa	How about Raelynn<br>  kaitlynn<br>  kyleigh<br>  moriah<br>  <br>  there are so many possibilites!|`|N52Eik6haa	I dont like Rihanna its like your naming her after the singer. I like Laura or Lauren =) x|`|f04a6873fb6ccafa68e423bac6e65f18aa	name her what you think suits her but keep her birth name as a middle name.|`|d6c5091f4ae22232c337d5a7245302feaa	Rhianna... is an okay name.

I hate that name, and so many people are using it now a days.

It will Link her to her birth parents, and it won't be too huge of a change. If you don't like her middle name, do a variation of it. I.E. Madison Katherine, name her Katelyn. I'm not saying u should name her that, though. Name her whatever you choose, but I don't really care for Rihanna. It reminds me wayy to much of the singer, and it doesn't go with the others. |`|R7mnEUOZaa	Whatever you choose keep her given name as her second name, this will give her a link with her birth mother, <br>  Tara or Katie are lovely names.|`|E9rzNd97aa	I'm not a fan of Rhianna. How about:<br>  <br>  Anna<br>  Brianna<br>  Jillian<br>  Hannah<br>  Lorraine<br>  Valerie<br>  Delaney?|`|doLyOac0aa	Rhianna is so Chavvy, |`|dK6YGyNyaa	i'm not a fan of the name rhianna, because it reminds me of the singer, and people might assume that was what you thought of when naming her. to go with madison and frederick, how about sticking with the three syllable pattern and going with:<br>  alexa<br>  georgina<br>  amelie<br>  louisa<br>  samantha<br>  melody<br>  francesca<br>  carolynne<br>  adelais<br>  vanessa<br>  imogen<br>  isabelle<br>  makayla<br>  melissa<br>  emily<br>  annabelle<br>  natalie<br>  sophia<br>  monica<br>  juliet<br>  tiffany<br>  abigail<br>  joanna<br>  loretta|`|e4M4uQXNaa	I don't really like the name Rhianna... it's just a personal thing though I can say that it's a nice enough name. <br>  <br>  I like the sound of just Anna better; it's a classic, gorgeous name that fits really well with Madison and Frederick as her older siblings.<br>  <br>  I also like Annabel, Annelise, Sophie (maybe not if Frederick is called Freddie as well with the -ie ending), Lily (Liliane, Lilith), Alexandrine, Isadora, Ruby, Scarlett, Charlotte, Lucy, Violet, Hazel, Claire, Laura or Laurel, and Jessamine.<br>  <br>  Phoebe<br>  Lucy<br>  Rosalie<br>  Juliet<br>  Penelope<br>  Claudia<br>  Beatrice<br>  Georgia<br>  Summer<br>  April<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!!|`|sHzSYL5raa	Rhianna is beauiful but i would call her that, Maybe, Rhianne?<br>  <br>  Madison, Frederick, Josie<br>  Madison, Frederick, Rebekah<br>  Madison, Frederick, Vanessa<br>  <br>  love xxxxx|`|nkM6wmv6aa	Not Rhianna<br>  I LOVE Frederick by the way.<br>  What about Madison, Frederick and Adeline? <br>  Claire?<br>  Sofia?|`|UKPYoPKuaa	"Renaya" That was my best friend in kindergarden. Rihanna is a singer, and ppl will think your copying her name or paying homage to her.|`|z6BtwSE8aa	I don't like Rhianna. Brianna is nice if you want something similar.|`|p3O5roqOaa	First of all,,good on ya.. There aren't enough forster or adoptive parents out there.. <br>  How about  Nataniela  Hebrew  for  Gift of god ?|`|3FcOchxnaa	i like the name Renesme<br>  : )<br>  Katie|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	I don't think that 3 months old is too old to change her name.  Normally I would say not to change her name, but if you already have a child with that name and the baby is really young then I think it is a good idea.  I don't car for Rhianna.  I really think that you should consider keeping Madison as her middle name.  It would be something she could "keep" from her birth mother.  But I would definitely call her something else.  Some names I think are pretty are:  Sara Madison, Emily Madison, Elizabeth Madison.|`|28WJwHf4aa	I'm with everyone else... I don't care for the name Rhianna, but in the end, you're the mother and you should pick a name that you like. And I also agree that it'd be a little odd to say, "These are my children, Madison, Frederick, and Madison." <br>  <br>  If you can name her something close, that'd be good. Addison or Madelyn is all that I can think of right now that would be close. I think Maddie is cute, but more as a nickname. Maybe use Madison for a middle name?<br>  <br>  I plan on naming my first daughter Kelsey Anne. <br>  <br>  Other names that I like are:<br>  <br>  Carly<br>  Camryn<br>  Emersyn<br>  Lauryn<br>  Kayla<br>  Miley<br>  Elsa<br>  Addison<br>  Kate<br>  Audrina<br>  Olivia<br>  Breana (bree-on-uh...not bree-ann-uh)<br>  Evalyn<br>  Sophie/Sophia<br>  Lucy<br>  Cailin<br>  <br>  Hope that helps some! Congrats on your newest addition!!|`|OGiuuCDzaa	Well being three months old she won't notice a difference. I'm usually against renaming adopted babies but in your case it's necessary. What a coincidence! I'm not a big fan of Rhianna myself, but of course she's your baby. The idea of keeping the name similar is not bad actually. Plus I think that Madeline ...however you want to spell it is a very cute name.|`|nZBtm3meaa	Rhianna isn't a favorite of mine.  Since you have traditional names for your other two, I'd stick with something traditional that matches them.  She'll already be adopted, you don't want her name to set her apart too.  Here are my suggestions:<br>  <br>  Evelyn<br>  Sydney<br>  Marissa<br>  Ella<br>  Isobelle<br>  Katherine (call her Katy for short)<br>  Audrey<br>  Morgan<br>  Lauren<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new baby!|`|dBXSdk5Taa	hi my name is stacey and i'm 14 i can't wait till i grow up cuz i wanna adopt. right i don't really like Rhianna much but have a look at these:<br>  Lisa-Marie <br>  Kizzy<br>  Scarlet<br>  Amanda<br>  Ammie<br>  Kelly<br>  Ruby<br>  Rose<br>  Rachel <br>  Hanna<br>  Kimberley<br>  Louise<br>  Jakie<br>  <br>  hope this helps good luck.|`|a1fa61b1465082cad7d2ea82295c14a9aa	Rhianna is nice.

mx3gFmIKaa	27    I feel that young girls have little life experience and getting pregnant for most of them wasn't planned or was a lapse in judgement, I have more compassion for young pregnant women than selfish old women ttc or pregnant knowing that they put the child in jeopardy because they are way over the advanced maternal age recommendations, they have life experience and should know better.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	the first time I was 23|`|viwq8ldvaa	I fell pregnant at 23.|`|lNw8hTU5aa	Well being a young girl that got pregnant, I feel as if some girls can handle it and some young girls can't I was 15 years old when i got pregnant 16 when I had her. I was in a serious relationship and got pregnant again when I was 17 and 17 when I had her. Now i am engaged and have temporary custody of my younger sister and just found out I am pregnant again and I am 18 and I will 19 when I this one.    I often wonder what i would be doing if I only would have waited. I love my kids and I know I am good mother my two year old does more than most 3 1/2 year olds. But I tell my sister to Wait until she is married and out of school.|`|IjcdwJiMaa	i was 21, i felt it was the right age 4 me, i turned 22 3 months after my son was born, im now 24, and loved my choice 2 have my baby!!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I was 19
R7U1sDd1aa	I know how you feel. I was using the ovulation calculator and my cycle is like 27,28,29 days every single month. I am currently 18 weeks along with my first baby, a boy! When my husband and I were ttc I thought it would NEVER happen, and on the third month of trying I was sure it didn't happen again that month, because according to the ovulation calculator, I really kind of missed the marks, just due to different occurrences that month. Anways, the big day came, and NOTHING. It was day 28, so I was sure it was just going to be 29 this month. Well, being so impatient, as soon as I got to work I had one of the other nurse draw my blood for an HCG level, and sent it off stat to come back at the end of the day. Sure enough it came back elevated, and here we are 18 weeks later! I really didn't have any back aches, but I just felt different. I was pessimistic from the other two months of BFN, and also from the BFN on the day of my missed period, but it happened! Good luck to you. Hope this helped! 8)|`|Dhsyroekaa	i have the exact same problem and expecting period the exact same time. Good luck with whichever way you want it to turn out!!!!

0udjgaoBaa	Im a mother of 2 boys and I agree with you...She has him dong way too many Feminine things....If you want to sway your son back into sports then do what you need to do to be in his life more...You cant sit back and ***** when you see him 15 times a year....Move closer to spend more time with him...Im not getting on you im just speaking my mind.|`|D6asmqFVaa	you know a castrato is a guy who's castrated right? anyway, stop judging him by what he likes. just because he may not be the sports loving son you want him to be, you can still love him.|`|NhBi8q80aa	I want to punch you in the ******* face for even saying you don't want him turning gay.  Asshole.|`|2a6KI95Vaa	Um first SUPPORT is what he needs IF he is gay 2 Castrato happens BEFORE puberty he still has till 18 and 3 CONTROL HIS DIET|`|ik1Gh9HVaa	you are the BIGGEST fag in the WORLD im 14 1/2 myself...and hell...i wouldnt mind singing...though i play Tennis, Football, and Baseball....but you should SUPORT your ******* son like a ******* dad should do. you racist to your son|`|bqehqlFHaa	You need to love and accept your son as he is.  But, are you trying to spend more quality time with him??  Why do you only see him 1 or 2 times a month??  This is your son!  If you want him to do manly things, he needs a man in his life!!  More than just a couple times a month!!  I'm sure his mother is doing the best she can!  Maybe you should be more of a father!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well i think no matter what your son is that you need to accept him for that. you brought a child into this world but i can almost guarantee when You chose to do so that you didn't do it thinking 'i will only love him if he is this one way' ... there are no guarantees as to how a child will turn out and its a gamble you have to take. so just love him for who he is. as for his diabetes that is something him and his mother should control closely. and if you are talking to your ex wife about anything in your sons life changing then THAT needs to be the point you are making. getting him healthier|`|7qAlZRHmaa	You know that is the biggest problem with parents I am one myself but i would accept them for who they are does he spend more time with you or your wife when he is there if your wife then because the way you put your self off and that is not good maybe one day he will be the new Toby Keith you never no just accept him for who he is dont be one of those that misses out on there kids life because you didnt accept what they done. Belive me it will happen he is only 15....|`|rE9J1DqTaa	OK first off if he is gay you need to understand that and support him if he is. Talk to him about tell him if he is gay then you support him. Thats what most gays want is to be supported.     On the diabetes not you need to make sure when you see him that all the food in the house is healthy. Dont let him eat the sweets. He could get worse. So help him control his diet and try to see him more often.    I hope i helped    Also your son has a gift not everyone can sing that good. Be happy about that he could be famous one day.|`|hGY08GjRaa	uhm.. the castrado were called that for a REASON.. so unless what they did to those boys happens to your son, singing cant make him "become a castrado" Only a knife can do that, if you get my drift.     Some guys have high tenor voices, nothing wrong with that. I prefer more baritone/bass myself (IMO the most soothing  male vocalist is Roger Whittaker) But there's nothing wrong with being a tenor.     Perhaps his voice still hasn't changed. He could wake up tomorrow as a bass.. my brother did. One day, nobody can tell him and me (his LITTLE sister) apart on the phone, the next day he wakes up with Alan RIckman's voice, and is singing LOW bass in a quartet.     Let your son be who he is.     Singing is NOT dangerous for a man during puberty.  Perhaps if he's in voice lessons (or interested in doing them) you can recommend that he develop his lower register (increase his vocal range to be able to sing LOWER notes) But otherwise, just leave him be. NO, you ARE being a moron for worrying.     You know how many male astronomers there are? They're very intelligent people. They put us on the moon.     As for the diet, that is your one legitimate concern. He does need to manage his lifestyle (diet/exercise) to better control his diabetes. Bug him about that, and leave him alone about his interests.     Let him be who he is.. It does not mean he is gay.
faPKwClPaa	Pushing yourself isn't going to help the situation either.  The best you can do is just call it a day, stay home, and REST.  You're body will not be able to repair itself running on empty.    As a secondary thought, maybe now's the time to think in terms of 'backup' or someone who could come in when you're feeling ill.  They may not be able to do your job *exactly*, but enough to keep things moving.|`|AFNN6wBeaa	If you are feeling that ill you should phone in sick.|`|GPW6HUZFaa	I would definitely call in sick.  Your boss will understand.  Maybe you can take a sick day, personal day, or vacation day if your job has those.  Otherwise, you should call off before you get even more sick and miss more work, or get someone else sick.|`|9LWuWHiMaa	Cara,  do you have an assistant, now is a good time to delegate. you are no good to your family sick so stay home and do wat you can but leave your professional and efficient assistant in charge and with the way this economy is i assume that she will; not let You down when you need he most  hope this was helpful
8uiH6iRbaa	yes i have this problem with my under ware rubbing against my scar it can be so annoying and makes it sore sometimes.    but i would never get a tummy tuck surly that would make things worse.     this will go away you had a Major operation your body and scar are still healing. please give it some more time before making any unnecessary decisions|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I actually asked this question recently.  Yes I have this problem, however my C-section was only 10 weeks ago. I can button my jeans, but they're a little tighter than they were prepregnancy.   I'm going to try to just buy a size larger until I get back down to size so they're not as tight on the scar.  I'm not about to get a tummy tuck.|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	When I first had my c-section, I could not wear anything that would rub against the scar.  It is still a little sensitive after 4 months, but to bad.  If you are still having problems after 2 years, you may want to get a second opinion.  Good luck|`|RuHtOvnJaa	my son is 8 months old my scar only hurts if my son is climbing all over my tummy like wen im cuddling him he put his legs into my belly ouchhhh which can cause my scar to hurt mine hasnt faded 1 bit either does it eva fade???|`|SpcYCBndaa	this doesn't make sense  if you get a tummy tuck, you will have a bigger scar to deal with  so i don't understand why you would get a bigger scar than the one you have now.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Mine can be still pretty sensitive, and I'm 4 months pp.  If I lean on it wrong it hurts too, but it's a weird kinda pain.  I'm just assuming that it was major surgery, and will probably take a while to heal fully.  They had to cut through all kinds of tissue and nerves, I'd say it would take at least a year, or more to completelyy heal!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Well, there's no law that says you have to wear designer jeans...    Seriously, your scar will continue to fade and become less raised for several years yet.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I had a c-section in 2004 and I have healed up fine as far as that goes, I've even had a VBAC and another coming up in May, but I still have problems with irritation, itching and the like.  I hate to say it, but it was major abdominal surgery and it after effects aren't going away anytime soon|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Because I had a question mark over whether I was allergic to morphine I was given extra anaesthetic injected into the scar after my CS. 5 years later its still numb and painful to lean on...not OUch just odd...but well as lots of you have said its major surgery but I wouldn't go for more surgery to try and make it better :P
5N3odm3Qaa	Nalgene brand products are just about indestructible. They are used everywhere from scientific laboratories to the great outdoors. They make a colorful array of children's sippy cups, too. You can find just a small assortment of them here: http://www.google.com/products?q=nalgene...    I had a friend in college whose mission was to break a Nalgene water bottle. After standing on it with 175 pounds of his weight, he dropped it from the fifth floor of our building. Short of running it over with his car or taking a sledge hammer to it, nothing broke it.    Oh, and Nalgene sippy cups are BPA-free.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I have hard wood floors and just use the first years take and toss cups. You have to use the handles to hold the lid on, if you don't the lid pops off when it hits the floor, but otherwise we haven't had a problem with them.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I've always used the Munchkin sippy cups because most of them have rubber lining that wont break. They also come in cartoon characters such as Dora that my daughter always liked.      http://www.google.com/products?client=fi...|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I buy anything by Playtex and they have never broken on me.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	We are on our 3rd sippy cup.  1st was the Nuby...it leaks too much and now is cracked. $4.00  2nd was the Playtex one, she just wanted nothing to do with it..think the spout was too narrow for her.$3-$4 cant remember    3rd Munchkin She loves it and I love the Price it was $2.99 at Target. She has dropped it, hasn't cracked , it doesn't leak at all, and I like the fact that she can hold it with one hand. Its the Tall ones with the soft spout. And it can hold up to 10 oz of liquid.|`|A89ezcg5aa	My daughter has Playtex sippy cups.  They feature baby Einstien pictures, and are hard to crack because of the rubber bottom.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Really you broke a nuby?    Anywho look for plastic that is slightly squishy rather than completely rigid.  But I think those all had BPA in them, I'm no plastic expert.  The take 'n' toss are softer, but if you fear BPA I've never checked them    You could also just use any normal cup, when baby is in the highchair.  Technically sippy cups are bad and can cause speech problems and orthodontic problems.  Since your highchair is on tiles then the mess shouldn't be too bad and the baby will learn proper cup use.  Then just buy any cheap small cups.    I try to use real cups at meals and only use sippys and water bottles for when the kids are wandering around and out of the house.|`|4JuwXJrEaa	Playtex cups are of very good quality and my daughter preferred them to other brands as well.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	We have many different kinds of sippy cups.  We had a nuby break just recently.  Try something more sturdy like a playtex or munchkin.
MltMtmqbaa	What?!  I actually haven't got a middle name, but I've always wished I had.  I'll borrow yours if you don't mind!  I think Margaret is a lovely name, but that's probably not what you wanted to hear.      They're just picking on you because you're so sensitive about it.  I'm sure some of them have got far more embarrassing middle names than you but they keep their mouths shut so they don't get given a hard time.|`|64CjdY3Vaa	Dont worry about them! If they are being mean to you just because of that, they need to just grow up (: You could go to a parent or somebody and just talk. it really does help to talk about things! Just do the right thing, it will all work out in the end!|`|YHMvi106aa	My middle name is "Hui." It's actually my chinese name.   Also, my last name is "Luo." Nobody can ever say it right! When I bring it up, or when they bring it up, they keep trying. "Luo? No, Luoo, Loo, LUa..." But instead of letting it get to me, I laugh it off. It's funny.    In fifth grade, this kid started calling me "Janicky." It's because my name is "Janice, and if you say the last two letters as "kee" you get "Janicky." For the whole year I was called that. It started around the whole classroom then. The school had a rule; anyone that knows if someone else is being bullied or teased, that person will be punished as well. So I was afraid to tell on the kid that started it, because would that mean everyone would get punished?  They didn't know that I really didn't like the name. I don't like showing my feelings and starting fights. I tried to laugh it off, so that's why it spread so easily. Only the kid that started it knew how much I hated it, but even he didn't REALLY understand; he thought he was joking with the name.  That name is over; now I look back and it seems really funny. Don't let it get to you. Roll your eyes. Tell them they're not very funny, and get on with it. Tell them the truth about how you feel, maybe they'll actually understand what jerks they are. But remember that you'll look back and laugh at it someday.  They're not trying to pick on you, and they don't mean to laugh at you. They want to laugh 'with' you.|`|qyT15nmXaa	Seeing as you asked; my middle name is Nicole. =]    I think the best way to cope with your problem is act like you don't care. If people call you stupid because of your middle name just say to them "Your the stupid one stressing at me 'cos of my name! It's just a name- get over it." or "and your just sad causing a commotion over a name." Something along those lines anyway. They really are pathetic bullying you because of your name. A name is a tiny thing, and they make all the fuss because of it. How sad are they. I know it's hard, but laugh right in their smug little faces. They aren't worth the tears. Keep your chin right up hun. x|`|grKtTRYtaa	Make up some sort of joke and laugh.      "I'll have to bring that up with my parents.  They didn't ask for my vote"  and laugh.  practice laughing and not crying.    Then, they will go on to someone else who will react.  You cannot react.  That doesn't make them less jerks as they are.|`|ChuhyvEaaa	The next time they make fun of your name just be like "it was kinda funny the first time but now it's just getting really old. please stop." If you are firm and look them in the eye when you say it, they'll know that you are serious. If they keeping doing it, continually tell them stop each time getting firmer and firmer in how you say it. Hope this helps.    My middle name is James|`|0NcRUSCoaa	Hi sweetheart,  these people are pathetic and insecure, that is why they are picking on you.  Tell a teacher and try to ignore them.  What people are saying about you is none of your business! :)  It;'s their problem,not yours.  My middle name is Bridget, by the way.|`|pJieNfzOaa	Tell them to shut their face, or better yet just be proud of your middle name, mine is Ruby-and i have red hair. But no one makes a fuss out of it if i don't. Seriously they are not worth your worry. Their morons who can't think of something better to pick on a middle name. If this really bothers you, i would recommend NOT telling the teacher and just face them, tell them to shut up and if they still don't then get them really wound up enough to say something really mean, and then just hit them in the face.  Only way to deal with bully's, It's how i did, this girl kept throwing pens at me and calling me and my friends names after a couple weeks i just got so fed up i just went over and punched her, best part-i didn't get in trouble. It doesn't matter if you're a shy person because i am, i have my friends and never speak in class unless i have to.   Good luck. x remember their just idiots.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	you have a pretty name!|`|J10eYdIAaa	ignore them,  seriuosly  and TELL SOMEONE.  it helps :)  my middle names lee :||`|fjMJJnCUaa	our lives are insignificant.

People are always going to mess with you and make fun of you for the rest of your life, and most likely it will be for worse stuff than your middle name. It's something that you're going to have to get used to. Also, even if your middle name is something horrible that's not really the point; people are teasing you about it because they know it will get to you and that you will cry. You just have to get over this, and if you really can't stand your middle name you can change it when you turn 18. If you just ignore people when they pick on you for your name they will eventually stop, but the more upset you get about it or the more you try to stop it the more you will get made fun of. Just let it go... if you let it get to you that you have a stupid middle name how do you ever expect to handle harsh criticism in a work environment. It's just something that you have to learn to do.|`|JZKMxaNeaa	y not ignore them pretend its not bothering you( it'll b hard at 1st) and laugh with them. they'll see that u dnt care and will get board sooner or later..my middle names Breege..whats yours?|`|UrXHT8UHaa	hi. my middle name is joan, i think that u should try and ignore them as much as u can while in school and they will soon realise that it doesn't bother u so they will get bored of it soon. i am very sensitive aswell so i no that it is hard when somebody says something hurtful not to take it to heart. its even harder when people who are not as sensitive as u tell u to take no notice. i learnt that as sensitive as i am if i just not listen to people and try not to think about what they have done it doesn't hurt me as much.    hope this helps and remeber there is only one person like u and u shud be proud and happy 2 be u.|`|AA11158034	my middlename is Elaine and i dont really get picked on for it.they all sound pathetic. what is ur middle name bet its not tat bad?

I think it is cute and unusual and will suit any age. I did think it was a bit nicknamey at first but it has grown on me and now I think it is a great alternative to the more common Hailey , I'm presuming you are pronouncing it with the short a, (hal-lee).<br>  Summer- This name fefels a bit americanised but it is actually pretty for a little girl born in summer because of how fresh and feminine it feels. It does always sound a bit posh or preppy to  me but I still kind of like it.<br>  Willow- I prefer this name to Summer, it is unusual and quirky but not weird and I think it sounds and looks really nice. I do think it will be associated with celebrities, as it seems to have joined the sort of celebrity baby's names trend but I think it is a nice name to have.<br>  <br>  The only one I like out of the boy's names is Elijah, that is unusual and sweet yet strong-sounding. Jobe does not sound very nice at all to me and Remi is a bit feminine, I feel, maybe because it is so similar to Demi.<br>  I like:<br>  Hallie Kate<br>  Hallie Caitlin<br>  Hallie Kendall<br>  Hallie Summer<br>  Hallie Rose<br>  Hallie Mae<br>  Hallie Rae<br>  Hallie Jade<br>  Hallie Eve/Eva<br>  Hallie Evelyn<br>  <br>  Summer Rose, kind of classic!<br>  Summer Hope<br>  Summer Leigh (not sure about how this flows)<br>  Summer Theresa<br>  Summer Mary<br>  Summer Kate<br>  Summer Emery<br>  Summer Emerald<br>  Summer Eden<br>  Summer Danielle<br>  Summer Elisabeth<br>  Summer Eliza<br>  Summer Noelle (I guess the meanings kind of contrast, though!)<br>  Summer Eve<br>  Summer Evelyn<br>  <br>  Willow Rose<br>  Willow Matilda<br>  Willow Orla<br>  Willow Elsa<br>  Willow Emer<br>  Willow Aisling<br>  Willow Remi<br>  Willow Eve<br>  Willow Evelyn<br>  Willow Anne<br>  Willow Sienna<br>  <br>  Elijah James (if you don't mind him having the same middle name as your son)<br>  Elijah Lee<br>  Elijah Evan<br>  Elijah Jacob<br>  Elijah Isaac<br>  Elijah Edward<br>  Elijah Cobe (cobe-ee)<br>  Elijah Oak<br>  Elijah Joseph<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, some good names there and maybe your friend could use a family name as the middle name. x|`|hh892gJfaa	Summer - 7/10, I like this name but it's becoming really common<br>  Willow - 6/10, very nice for a pet but not really for a person (maybe a middle name?)<br>  Hallie - 2/10, NO.<br>  <br>  Elijah - 4/10, I'm all for Bible names but this just sounds old.

nBlSS6HUaa	Wait a couple of days and take a test?!?   That is the only responce I've gotten. My LMP was 1-6-09, and it lasted till the afternoon of the 10th. I've had a lot of sore breasts, sore nipples, headahces, dizzy spells, very very tired, a little pain on my right side....took a test today...and negative. So I might only be like 3 or 4 weeks...so I am going to wait another 4 days and test again! Goto a dollar tree and get a test. They are only a dollar! BUT...you don't just   'pee on them' you pee in a cup, then use the dropper they give you and put 4 drops into the round area of the stick and it works that way. So you only need a very little pee.   As for are all AF and prego symptoms alike?...uh..for me NO. I Only ever have sore boobs when I'm prego, along with dizzy spells, very very tired, nausea. I only know AF is coming because of the days...I usually have a 27-28 day cycle.     Good luck and baby dust!|`|7uqOSZNKaa	yeah hun. test at the end of the week. im nt gna sit here and say wooah sounds like ur pregnant coz its devestating if ur not. if theres a bun in the oven hes still gna b there next week. good luck, got ma fingers crossed for ya x loadsa luck xx|`|l46COY9eaa	I'm in my 2ww right now, and I am having the exact same twinges on my right and left side ovary areas!! My nippled don't hurt but my boobs feel like they are full of cement and are very painfull (although the boob thing happens every month, but I've never had the twinges before!) And I have to pee sooo much at night, although this too could be because I gave up caffine and soda and am drinking water more. This waiting does suck! I test friday. Good luck to you and much, much baby dust!|`|AA12300309	Take a hpt, if it's negative, you might want to call your dr and have a blood test.|`|GcJszsMnaa	Well good  luck hun....But i'd wait an see what happens like you said at the end of the week! but until then...careful wat you do..You know..in case anything were to happen...|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, I'd either say test again or go to the OB and ask for a quantitative blood test.  Either way you need to test.  You definitely sound pregnant though dear.  =)|`|3MDY29gnaa	no u said it best. Just test! Good Luck
rlLf5m0xaa	I like all your names, they're very pretty, but I  like Jakob David better(David means king) out of the Bible; and for your girls' name I like the  best:Amelia Jayne Christine, this one very pretty! I like all your names they are all pretty.May I be the first to Congratulate you for the soon to born your gift from God.All 3 names for the girl is also out of the Bible, so  both names are already blessed!|`|VkvwwywHaa	Jakob David: It doesn't roll off the tongue like a name should and if he prefers to go with his middle name, it may cause confusion.<br>  Jakob Gary Ian: All three names have different origins and are awkward together when spoken quickly.<br>  Jakob Glenn: It's easier to say, and If you no longer use the name, it would be best to give to your son.<br>  Jakob Stefan: again, the names have different origins, and if he prefers to go with his middle name, It may cause confusion as well.<br>  <br>  Amelia Susanna: Are you comfortable with having a child that carries your name? If you are, then this name is best in my opinion.<br>  Amelia Sanna: I would never give a child a nickname  for a name, and if she preferrs sanna to Amelia, then when people call you, she may respond to it.<br>  Amelia Jayne Christine: Amelia and Christine are not names that ring well together, but Amelia Jayne sounds pretty good.<br>  Amelia Agnes: Who actually gives a kid a name like Agnes now? It's too much alliteration and could lead to massive teasing from other students.|`|t9yWXJUWaa	I believe that all of them sound great. Since you're choosing to name the child after someone you know, I think it would be fun to wait until the child is born. When you first hold him or her, you'll know. Out of all the people, who does he or she remind you of? Who did he or she look at first? Something will guide you to the right decision.(However, I do like the idea of keeping your maiden name in the mix for the boy. Cool!)|`|AA12093196	I like Jakob Glenn and Amelia Agnes.  <br>  <br>  In defense of Agnes, I think it's unique these days and hints at family history, hints that there's meaning and thought behind the name, that there might be something more to this person, that she comes from somewhere.|`|VZ0xI1Jjaa	How about mixing yours and your husbands names: Amelia Davanna (Da-vanna) or I like Amelia Sanna best of those listed.

QLcM671Paa	emily kate! double names are SOOO in!|`|4cdq26oraa	Pick a list of names you like and then listen to how they sound with the last name. While some people get stuck on some names regardless of how they sound with the last name, I do think it's important. As much as we pretend it doesn't happen, kids can be cruel and let's not make it any easier by picking an easy name for them to harp on. You'll be able to tell if it sounds right together by saying it over and over. Eliminate the ones that just don't sound right and choose between the ones that are left. You can be original without going over the top. Do some research on some of the names and the meanings. A little work on your part now is worth the investment, as they are going to have that name for the rest of their lives. They appreciate (some day) the work you put in coming up with the name. |`|tjaBctiBaa	Rhiannon is my very favorite out of those 4.

When she is 18, she can then choose to live with you or wheverever she wants...It's just a month, hang in there until then|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	See a lawyer    Nobody can tell you this    You need to see a lawyer|`|7uqOSZNKaa	you probably should av thought more about it before giving her away 10 years ago|`|2wyDALHgaa	If she was legally adopted then it may depend upon what arrangements the man had made or what his family wants.      I don't think it would be possible but contact a lawyer as only one of those could examine the case and advise you how you may be able to proceed.  If you wanted to "get her back" then you may need to adopt her yourself if thats possible and for that you would need to qualify like anyone else.|`|xBd96wvRaa	I don't agree that you will be treated harshly because you gave your daughter up for adoption.   Especially if you were a teen parent.     I am sure it was a very difficult and painful decision and you did what was best for your daughter at the time.     It is the courts job to do what is in the best interest of the child - not judge the birth mother on whether or not she should or shouldn't have put the child up for adoption.     As long as the reasons you put her up for adoption have been resolved completely and you an prove that you will provide a good home then you have a case.    So yes, you have a chance to get her back. How good a chance depends on many factors.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	In most cases adoption does not work like that. The death of a parent who has adopted does not guarantee that the child that was adopted will be returned to their biological parents.  What arrangements did this girls father make for her? Who is she currently living with/has custody of her?  How is her home life?  Who ever has custody or guardianship of her would have to give up their legal rights to her and then you would have to re-adopt her.     Assuming she is 10 year old or even a year or two older then that, a  child does not get to pick who they are going to live with.  Take an older child in a custody situation they can tell who they would rather live with but in the end (in most cases) they do not make the finale call.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Chris & Kelsey,    Congrats on having each other in your lives again! :)    http://www.adoptingback.com/    Good luck and best wishes for a long, happy and healthy future together!|`|biqMTkWbaa	Contact a lawyer, he should be able to help you.|`|yMfJNatnaa	I believe all states differ when it comes to the laws of adoption. But for sure contact a lawyer. Especially if she is still in your life and wants to be with you. She can have a say in  all this.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	Be prepared to do DNA testing. Unless you have already established parentage. You may have to establish it again.    Excellent that she wants to live with you!    AS the others have already said, you will need a family rights attorney.    Since she has been adopted, she will have to be adopted by you. Weird, but that is how it works, unless you or the adoptive father made some other arrangement, such as an automatic placement in case of death.    Make a case for yourself. Are there other relatives who can stand up for you? Friends? Church? Community?The more the better. The laws in your state will look at you very harshly because you surrendered her, so you must show that you can pass the squeaky-clean test.    You are older now and that may help you.    The laws will state that you must be prepared for her, be able to provide a clean home,decent neighborhood, education, medical care, guidance, stability,good food,etc. and that you are not a danger to her.    ETA: check the laws of your state, but most likely easier after age 18, because she will be an adult. Legally speaking, it matters a great deal that you do this.It is very important to establish a legal relationship, as well as the biological one.    Good luck to both of you.|`|AA12174100	it depends on alot of things. First, when people adopt they are usually required to name a person or family who will get custody of the child in the event of an emergency. Plus it really depends on the circumstances of why and how she was adopted. Like did you just voluntarily give her up, or did the state take her due to neglect or abuse or inability to care for her. They will surely dig deep into your past on this. Sounds like you might need a lawyer on this one.|`|984c0feac5fcb2b2527360725a42fac5aa	Don't get a lawyer.  She turns 18 in a month.  Things move very slowly, and likely by the time you get anything done she will be 18 and officially an adult.      You and her should sit down with her grandparents (the ones she is living with) and tell them the plan for her to come live with you.  It is possible they will agree to have it happen sooner.  Even if they don't, it will smooth things over when she does move out.    The ONLY reason you should bother with trying to adopt her might be for health insurance reasons.  But otherwise, once she is 18, it really doesn't matter much.  And, certainly isn't worth the cost.|`|2f49jsLpaa	In order for her adoptive father to adopt her, you would have either had to give up your rights to the child, or your rights were terminated by the court. Since she was adopted by someone else, then in the eyes of the law, you are no longer her father and have no legal rights to her.     You didn't state if her mother is alive or not, but if so then she would need to consent to you adopting your daughter back, or if not, then the grandparents would need to, but she will likely be 18 by the time the adoption is final. Or they could probably just give you temporary guardianship since she's almost an adult, and you could re-adopt her after she turns 18 if you want.|`|UPtWwVYsaa	okay well when the child is 18 she is legally an adult. After she is 18 if she chooses, she can make you her legal parent.        goodluck|`|AXshzI0Kaa	Off the cuff, if she is considered an adult at 18 in your locale, then she can go anywhere she wants to go then. She could even be adopted back by you if she wanted to be.     A lawyer could settle this.....    March is just next month.....|`|JcVHhFZbaa	To be honest like why would you even give up your kid 10 years ago anyways? But you should get a lawyer and see what happenes.
iQjS2lJ4aa	I did at 7 months, you can buy baby stock cubes without the salt.|`|AA11947878	I never have used them. If you want to make homemade foods for your daughter, I would sugguest just giving her some of the same foods you eat, such as tender cooked squash, mooshy carrots, Soft peas and green beans. You can pretty much cook down any veggie and add a little butter and see which one she takes to more. <br>  <br>  They make baby food maker machines, I think they are like some sort of grinder, I used a food processor. <br>  <br>  |`|aPN7NsvXaa	I wouldn't use bullion cubes in a baby food recipe for a while longer.  I was really leary about the salt and sugar intakes of my first born when he was eating.  Bullion cubes contain a lot of salt.  However, you can always cut it...and replace the bullion cube/water portion of the recipe with a reduced sodium broth, instead.  Or, you could just boil your own chicken to make your own broth.  <br>  <br>  Your baby is 11 months old, though.  And, at 12 months, my son was eating mostly everything I was making for the family.  Again, personally, though...lots of salt.

I know it sucks he can't be with you...but just think that soon you'll have your baby and see your husband again...even if just for a little while. He's doing something great for our country btw!  Be sure to thank him for me!|`|IjcdwJiMaa	just hang in there hun!! xx|`|nZBtm3meaa	First... let me say a big thanks to your hubby.  Second... take a deep breath.  This is completely normal.  Many spouses are lost, scared, sad, etc when their spouse is in the military and leaves for a tour, especially the area he's going to.  Add in the pregnancy hormones and everything seems completely amplified.  Do you live on base?  Is there a support group there or close to where you live?  I'm sorry you have to go through this.  Big hugs to you!|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I can't even imagine how hard that would be. Hang in there! I'm sure everything will turn out perfect!! Be strong...your baby needs you. :)|`|UYfqzCoMaa	First off tell your husband thank you from me for doing what he does and for protecting our country. Second, I know going through pregnancy is tough. These last few weeks are the hardest because you just want it to be done and over with so that you can hold your new baby. Just relax and try to take it easy. Hang out with friends and family. I know what it's like to be worried about someone who is over there. The man that I was engaged to when I was 19 (i'm 26 now) went over there and came home in a box. The truck that he was in was attacked and he died saving his buddies life. I don't want to scare you at all. Your hubby will come home and will see that new baby. Just keep the picture of him holding that newborn in his arms and giving you his special smile and telling you how wonderful you are for raising your son. Because you are. Us women have motherly instincts built in to us. It's our nature to worry. Your going to be ok and so is he. Good luck and may God bless you and your family.|`|Y2K5oNDNaa	I have seen many women go though this including my sisters.  I feel for you and I am sorry you have to go though this.

wzXJOSIeaa	5 days before your missed period|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Take one AFTER you miss your period!|`|HOdblqIkaa	You can test a few days before your missed period or after it.

Best Of Luck & Lots of Bay Dust =) xx|`|aJjV5b95aa	You can take a HPT a few days before you period is supposed to come. Or you can wait until you missed period.|`|pRaPxsLzaa	depends when your next period is due.  Once the egg has been fertalised and attached to the uterus lining the hormone level will double every 2 days, but this doesnt tend to show till earliest 4 days before a period is due.  To be safe wait till your period is due and try.  If it should say neg wait at least another 2 days and try again.  They also say its best to use early morning urine as the pregnancy hormone is stronger!!    good luck.
MkCTwE95aa	Thats how i got pregnant. Almost 4 years of the pull out method, but i guess one of those little guys just made it past...it is obviously not 100% effective but i believe as long as the guy pulls out soon enough its usually ok (seeing as many people do use this method), but as you probably know there are those times that cut it really close and you never really know what happened before he pulled out. If he pulls out a good 30 seconds before climax and 'finishes' himself you should do fine.    but like others have said, if you dont want to get pregnant dont use this method no matter how good his timing is...for us it wasnt a huge issue that i got pregnant it was one of those if it happens it happens type things, but i wouldnt rely on pulling out if i really wasnt ready|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Really high!!! If you dont want to end up pregnant then i urge you to get on birth control. Dont think because it didnt happen yet that it wont happen.|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	I don't know about "the odds" but I have several friends who have had babies from the pull-out method.   You are either extremely lucky so far or one of you may have reproductive problems.|`|bmoCpcdraa	odds are very well you cant pull it all out|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	The "Pull out method" is not effective. You should use another from of contraception if you do not want to get pregnant.|`|Dhsyroekaa	wow. people need to be educated that the pullout method is not a method!!!!!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	The "pull out" method is the most irresponsible method ever.  You can easily get pregnant this way.  Pregnancy must not be that big a concern if that's what you're relying on.|`|AA12071655	A male can leak before reaching... uh.. you know.. the "moment." I have a 31yo son because of using the pull-out method.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	Alright, let me tell you that not all men have the best control that they claim to have. Many spill a tad while in there and would never own up to it... but I strongly suspect that it contributes to the "failure rate" of pulling out. My husband is very very good with it, even if he thinks there's a chance he may dribble he pulls quickly and we never got pregnant having sex that way. We had sex full on two times while I was ovulating and bam! I was pregnant. So I think the pulling out method works not so bad if you can afford to have a child right now. Seeing as you aren't married, you are worried about the odds, etc, I'm assuming you're not trying to get pregnant. Don't rely on this method alone then. Use something else as well!!|`|qImMwhUHaa	I got pregnant the second month of not being on birth control using the "family planning" and pull out method combined. So, obviously differs from person to person. I'd defiantly use a back up method if you're not ready for kids yet.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Depends if you know your cycle, and practice it correctly.  There is still a good chance of pregnancy if he obvious ejaculates inside you, but if you use the withdrawl method correctly, know your body, and watch your ovulation cycles, you should be okay.|`|KlQO9CYgaa	I have gotten pregnant with that method twice now in the past 2 years. And this wasn't our normal method either. We only did it when I ran out of bc. Guess it wasn't too effective. I would recommend another method.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	The vast majority of women who rely solely on the "pull-out" method get pregnant within a year.  It depends on how fertile you are and how high your partner's sperm count is, etc.  You have been lucky to not get pregnant thus far, but remember that just as the "pull-out" method is not a form of birth control, abortion isn't either.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	like 50% - 60% effective in pregnancy prevention.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Pull out method is not safe my mom told me that is how she got pregnant with me.I urge you to use a condoms it is better than the pull out method.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	It is possible but it never happened to me...|`|grKtTRYtaa	There is an old joke.    What do you call a woman who does not use birth control?  Ans.  Mother    You may have been lucky so far.|`|QVg9KB1vaa	I got baby  2 from using the pull out method.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Statistically, the failure rate runs about 20-25%  (20% of women will become pregnant in a year of use -- by contrast, condoms have about a 2% failure rate, and using 'nothing' will result in pregnancy in about 80% of women) ... but it depends somewhat on the man's control. If he IS able to pull out on time every time, it may be a bit more reliable.     If you don't want to get pregnant, please find another, more reliable method.  You've been lucky so far, so your luck WILL run out eventually.|`|hZuq2XT9aa	well if your using contraceptive's/condom's then there's a slim chance of you falling pregnant,despite this otherwise you can anytime fall pregnant and if you're so worried then you should be extra cautious :) alway's think with precaution if you least expect the unexpected :P
C22jeMVhaa	Go sit in class with him for a few days.I'll bet he'll behave then. After that all you have to do is remind him you know he can do it. Besides, the threat of having to go to school with his mother should be enough. I used to have a social butterfly. One threat to spend a week at school and I haven't had a problem since.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	If he says he's acting crazy for his friends it means he acts out to get attention. Its not self esteem he needs its attention for good behavior.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	He needs a good talking to.|`|JjBtgSixaa	Keep talking to him about it and that it isn't nice to act "crazy" at school, tell him to do that on the playground.  It will slowly filter into his head.  Good luck.|`|440ff12c5c7f9158d1cd2548877d0d23aa	A few ideas:  1. Is he associating with right kind of friends?  2. Talk to his pediatrician for advice  3. Meet with the school principal and teacher to work out a motivation & discipline strategy that you BOTH use so there is no confusion for your son as to what is acceptable behavior.  4. As mothers, we sometimes see our children through rose-colored glasses (myself included!). Perhaps friends or family members have similar observations about your son.    All I can say is that no action is worse than trying a strategy that doesn't work.   Good luck!
J2kNmvMGaa	Mira, se recomienda que durante los primeros tres meses de vida de un bebe, el coma cada vez que el pida, puesto apenas se esta adaptando a este mundo, luego de esto lo que debes hacer es irle incrementando la racion que puede ser 6 onzas cada 2 horas, o segun la prescipcion de tu pediatra, luego mayor cantidad pero con periodos mas largos, esto es poco a poco.<br>  <br>  El bebe se va adaptando y cuando menos lo pienses esta comiendo tres a cuatro teteros por dia, esto es de mucha paciencia y de entender a tu hijo, a veces las madres confunden los llantos por hambre... pero existen otros factores, como tiene calor, esta incomodo, le aprieta la ropita, y muchos otros factores, aqui es donde fallan mas los padres y lo que crean es un desorden alimenticio a futuro, igualmente tampoco es facil.<br>  <br>  Espero haberte sido de ayuda, y mucha suerte y exitos en tu nueva etapa de ser madre, es muy hermosa y muy fructificante.
5k5ZuVxyaa	Hola, mi bebe tiene lo mismo que el tuyo y el esta tomando 4 oz. cada 4 horas, tu bebe duerme poco porque de seguro le despierta el hambre deberias de darle mas y si se duerme despiertalo hasta que se tome minimo 3oz y media.|`|FSkvJbi6aa	mira lo mejor es que consultes con tu pediatra pero a mi la pediatra de mi hijo cuando nacio pues me envio a darle de lactar entre 15 y 20 minutos en cada seno y 2 onzas de formula (era muy comelon) y me dijo que lo haga cada dos horas de ahi que fuera aumentando la formula (sin dejar de darle de lactar el mismo tiempo) y que de a poco le vaya aumentando una hora...|`|4gHPaTOIaa	Lo mejor es que su pediatra sea quien te diga que hacer, hay bebes que tienen su estomago muy peque?ito y no hay nada que hacer que UNO adaptarse a ellos, como me paso a mi con mi nena.<br>  Saludos|`|8ff7136c58c367bbab1a538febe22e04aa	pues para mi se me hace bien lo que come pero a lo mejor no le esta llenando la leche que le das intenta cambiarsela por otra que lo llene mejor|`|CN8YGvQgaa	Mira.<br>  <br>  Y o tengo una bebe de la misma edad y la verdad mi bebe duerme 3 horas o mas y luego despierta para comer lo mas seguro es que tu bebe se quede dormido mientras lo alimentas así que despierta lo para que siga comiendo has que eructe y vuelve le a dar para que quede satisfecho y así va adormir mas horas <br>  <br>  mira yo también fu al pediatra y me dijo que muchas veces los bebes no quieren comer si no mamar comprate unos chupones por que es mucho lo que tu bebe esta comiendo y si puedes ve al pediatra a ver que te recomienda el<br>  <br>  Espero que mi respuesta te sirva y no te desesperes yo se que es difícil animo amiga|`|Hxy6YBWPaa	generalmente los bebes al pasar las 10 semanas empiezan a regular su estomago pero en si, los recien nacidos comen cada 3 o 4 horas..eso es durante los 3 primeros meses, mas adelante se van a ir acostumbrando no te impacientes y ten mucha calma..|`|U3kf0IBqaa	Cada bebé es único, lo mejor es que consultes con su pediatra. <br>  <br>  Por qué le das biberón en vez de amamantarlo? La leche materna es el alimento perfecto.|`|eixkQUVPaa	hola, imagino que no le das seno materno. y me parace que te come cada dos horas poruiqe le estas dando poca acantidad, te aconsejaria que probaras con tres o 4 onzas y cada tres hrs aproximadamente, ese horario es el mejor para los bebes, recuerda que si tardan mas tiempo el azucar puede bajar y pueden estar somnolientos(adormilados) si es menos tiempo es muy probable que no te aumente de peso adecuadamente. que debe ser 750 gr por mes,aunque hay algunos bebes que suben hasta un kg o mas. Suerte!!!!|`|z0EHMBTZaa	cada hora o 2 es muy poco tiempo para que un bebe haga una digestion correcta.<br>  Deben de alimentarse cada 3 horas. Dale mas leche.<br>  Mi sobrino tomaba 2 onzas cada 3 horas + 10 minutos en cada pecho de su madre.<br>  Incrementale la cantidad de alimento. Y que sea cada 3 horas, si se queda dormido antes de terminar despiertalo.<br>  <br>  Por sobre todo habla con tu pediatra!!!!<br>  Saludos!

Pero al principio el bebé no conoce a su cuerpo. Reconoce a su mamá por el olfato y no tarda en "verla" con su mirada. <br>  En esta etapa el bebé todavía no ve con nitidez. Apenas consigue ver sombras a una curta distancia de no más que medio metro. <br>  El bebé reconoce la madre por el olor<br>  La respiración del bebé de 1 mes es algo ruidosa e irregular. <br>  Duerme la mayor parte del día y de la noche. <br>  Y nadie puede sustituir la presencia de su mamá. La reconocerá por su olor. <br>  El bebé descubre en esa etapa que el llanto es su único y por lo tanto su mejor recurso para conseguir atención. La cabeza del bebé es grande y pesa mucho. Poco a poco se va fortaleciendo el cuello con lo cual se torna capaz de levantarlo cuando se lo ponen de boca a bajo. <br>  Además, consiguen mover pies y manos.<br>  El bebé de un mes ejercita sus reflejos. Consigue agarrar los dedos de sus padres e incluso tirar de ellos. <br>  <br>  Busca actividades que estimulen todos los sentidos del bebé, puedes conseguir los videos de baby Einstein viene para todas las edades.|`|nlJnmYoqaa	hola... ahora ve sombras pero es importante que cualquier objeto o tu siempre esten a 30 cms de distancia los primeros 3 meses.<br>  saludos.

I would change my first name but not my middle because my mom chose it due to my great-grandmother Grace (one of her favorite people) and her own middle name Lynn (what she goes by).  I appreciate that she put thought into it and created a special name for me.  I really don't care that it is not a "real" name which is what people always say about it on this site, it was chosen after family members who matter to me and I care much more about that than having a "real" name that would have no story behind it like Kelly Marie.<br>  <br>  I would choose Genevieve Gracelyn because I love that Genevieve is a classic, substantial, underused name with great nickname options (GG, Genna, Gen, Evie, Eve) and I think the double G is too cute.  This is why I was proud to name my daughter Genevieve Gracelyn aka Evie, I gave her the name I always wished I had!|`|jCJbo2f8aa	I am happy with my name so I wouldn't change it but I have a few names picked out for my next bundle of joy you might like them.

mGxwDq1Raa	Hola Nalley:<br>  <br>  1o Debemos consevir una posible fecundación (embarazo) para eso:<br>  <br>  POSICIONES AYUNDAN:<br>  <br>  A continuación te detallamos las posiciones y los trucos que aumentarán tus chances de lograr el ansiado embarazo.<br>  <br>  ? Posición de plegaria<br>  Existen trabajos de investigación que apoyan que la posición en plegaria (con el hombre detrás o encima) da mayores oportunidades de concepción porque facilita la penetración del hombre más profundamente en la vagina, y en consecuencia se logra una mayor proximidad del semen al cuello uterino.<br>  <br>  ? Posición lateral<br>  La posición lateral (con el hombre detrás) es a veces más confortable y también permite mayor contacto con el cérvix uterino, ya que facilita la penetración del hombre más profundamente. <br>  <br>  <br>  ? Elevación de la pelvis<br>  La elevación de la pelvis de la mujer (mediante un almohadón o almohada), después de la relación sexual, por efecto de la gravedad permite que una mayor cantidad de espermatozoides queden expuestos al cuello uterino, aumentando el número de espermatozoides en la cavidad uterina.<br>  <br>  ? Permanecer recostada<br>  Es también muy importante permanecer recostada por lo menos durante media hora después de una relación sexual. Esto facilita la penetración de los espermatozoides en la cavidad uterina y de allí seguir su recorrido hacia las trompas de Falopio, lugar adonde se realiza la concepción (unión del óvulo con el espermatozoide).<br>  <br>  <br>  ? El orgasmo<br>  La presencia de orgasmo en la mujer también es fundamental, porque consiste en potentes contracciones vaginales y uterinas que tienen como función acercar el semen al cuello uterino, y favorecer la entrada al útero de los espermatozoides.<br>  <br>  <br>  NO HACERLO <br>  <br>  También existen posiciones que dificultan la concepción. Ellas son en posición parada o sentada arriba del hombre, en las que por efecto de la gravedad, los espermatozoides son evacuados de la vagina más rápidamente y las chances de un embarazo son mucho menores.<br>  Debemos recordar que existen creencias populares que determinadas posiciones en la relación sexual favorecen la llegada de un hijo de un sexo determinado. No hay estudios científicos que lo corroboren. De todas formas si quieres saber mas acerca de cómo tener más posibilidades de tener un hijo varón o mujer puedes leer nuestro artículo acerca de <br>  <br>  <br>  Primero, la mujer debe de tener ciclos regulares y saber que dia ovula, eso se logra con el metodo del calendario y el metodo de la temperatura, el dia de ovulacion debe de estar marcado y saber que dia llegrara.<br>  .<br>  Segundo: El hombre produce espermatozoides, de dos tipos, el androesperma que engendrara a un varon y el ginoesperma que engendra a una mujer, el androesperma nada muy rapido pero sobrevive poco (24 a 48 hrs) y el ginoesperma nada lento pero sobrevivie mas (hasta 72 hrs.) si tomas en cuenta eso te daras cuenta que debes de tener relaciones el dia de ovulacion de la mujer para que los androespermas que nadan rapido lleguen antes que los ginoespermas para fecundar un varon. si quieres una mujer ten relaciones dos dias antes de la ovulacion para que los ginoespermas sobrevivan a la ovulacion y los androespermas hallan terminado su vida germinal para ese momento.<br>  <br>  ADEMAS DE LA POSICION QUE COMER: ANTES<br>  <br>  Para un ni?o<br>  ? Come carne roja.<br>  ? Ingiere alimentos ricos en sal.<br>  ? Ingiere bebidas cola.<br>  <br>  Para una ni?a<br>  ? Come pescado.<br>  ? Come chocolates.<br>  ? Ingiere dulces en general<br>  <br>  ELIGIENDO EL SEXO DEL BEBE MEDIANTE RELACIONES SEXUALES<br>  <br>  Para un ni?o<br>  ? Realizar posiciones que aumenten la penetración profunda.<br>  ? Permanecer recostada 30 minutos después del coito. <br>  ? Concentrar la estimulación en el placer del varón.<br>  ? El varón debe dormir a la izquierda.<br>  ? La mujer mirando el norte.<br>  ? Los testículos deben estar calientes.<br>  ? Que el hombre llegue primero al orgasmo.<br>  <br>  Para una ni?a<br>  ? La mujer sobre el varón.<br>  ? Iniciativa femenina para el juego.<br>  ? Concentrar la estimulación en el placer de la mujer .<br>  ? La mujer alcanza primero su orgasmo.<br>  ? Los testículos deben estar fríos.<br>  ? Que la mujer llegue primero al orgasmo.<br>  <br>  ELIGIENDO EL SEXO DEL BEBE DE ACUERDO AL MOMENTO DEL COITO<br>  <br>  Para un ni?o<br>  ? Con luna cuarto menguante a la noche.<br>  ? Los días impares del mes.<br>  <br>  Para una ni?a<br>  ? En luna llena por la noche.<br>  ? A la siesta.<br>  ? Los días pares del mes.<br>  <br>   Espero entiendas y practiques <br>  <br>  Saludos. Lo mejor para vos y tu pareja . Que consigas lo que tanto anhelas|`|0WhVwNjkaa	La Mejor posición para concebir un varón es: LA PROBETA. Chica, informate, el sexo de tu feto lo terminará el Espermatozoide de tu esposo que entre a tu óvulo. De los millones de espermatozoides que tu esposo depositará en tu vagina solo 1 llegará a fecundar tu óvulo y dentro de la materia GENETICA del espermatozoide que lo haga se enuentra definido si será femenino o masulino. Así que si tu empe?o es tener un varón ve on un gineologo genetista a que tome muestras del semen de tu esposo y feunde tu ovulo de manera INVITRO (de probeta) que ademas de ser muy costoso y llevar muchos riesgos a la salud, tiene un enfoque moral muy fuerte... deberias preocuparte por alimentarte bien y pedirle a Dios que te de un Hijo/a SANO y no por si será ni?a/o y lo querras mas o menos.<br>  <br>  Saludos =).|`|484a7c82cdf56fefc5c6c24a259aa27baa	orale,,, apoco eso se puede???? no creo!!!|`|KfDoUacgaa	456565|`|TRF69jJHaa	busca calendario lunar en google.com|`|bw3a3q8taa	solo dios o el destino. aun no puedes elegir eso ni el color de pelo y otras cosas,sin duda hay que esperar muchos a?os mas para  que eso sea realidad|`|e37c63e1aab053b2dc08cb82112fbdeaaa	Mirá insití, pero la verdad es que las que saben son las viejitas y muy pocas, preguntá a las que tuvieron varones.

dx1xR0sVaa	Generally speaking, people say that the least likely time is before or after you ovulate.  But, you can't rely on that - nature is crazy, and hormones (especially at your age) are even crazier.  You can get pregnant ANY time of your cycle and sperm can live inside a womb for up to 7 days.  Use birth control, condom and/or the birth control pill, or don't have sex at all.  Birth control is the only way to be "prepared."<br>  <br>  Good luck. =)<br>  <br>  And no matter what people say, you can get pregnant no matter WHAT position you're having sex in.|`|LbHuUxkhaa	just make sure you wear a condom as your only young and go to the doctors for the pill to stop you from having a baby while taking them or the morning after pill which you take the morning after sex...|`|PhDxC2qPaa	If you don't use protection you can get pregnant when ever.

54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Just try to eat healthy, I know it is hard but dont worry about your weight gain as long as your doctor isnt worried, gaining weight is what keeps the baby growing and healthy.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Just make sure you eat healthy, take your vitamins, and get enough fluids. Talk to your doctor, they can help you take steps to not only stay at your current weight but also possibly come out of this pregnancy weighing less. You may want to mention that you are getting winded and experiencing pain when trying to exercise, you may need to cut back. That doesn't mean you have to stop losing weight though. Simply changing your diet will still shed pounds. Good luck|`|H1NjIT10aa	Oh, sugar I having been formerly morbidly obese I can so relate to how you feel.      First get your doctor's ok.... then look at something like Weight Watchers.  You need to focus on Proteins and veggies.  Cut out fried food, sweets and breads...|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	Continue to eat healthy and take small walks whenever possible.    I'm at 36 weeks right now and I haven't been able to do much exercise for my entire pregnancy due to fatigue and muscle soreness, so you are definitely not alone.    Being pregnant boosts your metabolism and a lot of women who begin overweight will end up losing weight by the end of their pregnancy. I have a friend who started pregnancy at 275 and after she gave birth, she was down to 250 and the baby was completely healthy. Don't worry about it too much!    Remember to do your kegals and take your prenatals to make sure you are still getting the nutrition that you need. Enjoy your pregnancy and stop worrying!!|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i was 180 a few weeks ago. that meant i gained almost 60 pounds!!! yeah im realy depressed about that. just ask your dr what food and exersizes you could use.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	first of all, do not diet! not while pregnant. eat as healthy as you can, continue to try to do some light exercise. chances are, if you eat healthy and exercise, you won't gain as much weight as you think. i gained 17 pounds during pregnancy, and lost all of it and more after having the baby. us obese gals do not need to gain 20 to 30 pounds to have a healthy pregnancy--in fact, we can make it unhealthy if we do. just make sure you have the gestational diabetes testing done on time because that's a big part of being obese and pregnant--chances are, you'll get gd. but it's easily controlled through diet. in fact, if you want to lower your chances of getting gd, go ahead and talk to a diabetes counselor or nutritionist about following a diabetic diet. it's fairly easy and you only have to do it for 3 months or so... good luck!!!|`|IkuZj0Lbaa	Yes its healthy to maintain weight while your pregnant. Eat a varety of healthy foods. Your doctor can give you suggestions. Try walking as much as you can. Walk for 10-15 minutes 3 or 4 times a day. Take your prenatals. Your doctor can really help you with this. Are your feet swelling?|`|6rOJZxxSaa	watch your diet!!! how much did you weigh when you started out? just walk around. maybe go to the mall or something that isnt making your mind focused on the actual exercise|`|yQqbULPLaa	Swimming is a great way to feel your best.

PFO1jxZGaa	My husband took our 17 mos old daughter out of state to see his mom for 6 days. ( we also have 3 and 5 year old kids who stayed home) I didnt really want her to go but she was free to fly and so the best choice for him to take with him.   I cried the first two days and even around her naptime I accidentally went to check up on her couple of times only to find an empty crib :(  I was absolutely heartbroken the first two days but after that it got better especially since ny husband would call me at least twice aday to let me know how they were doing. And they did good, she had no real issues while she was gone and they were so busy that I dont think she even missed me that much  She used to be extremely clingy to me but after she came home I was able to go to bathroom etc without her screaming outside the door so I guess her trip showed for both of us that we can go on even if the other person is not there 24/7.   Just let them go, he is with his daddy and his daddy loves him and knows how to take care for him. I know it will be hard for you but its only for a week. I'm sure he'll be having a blast with his grandparents :)|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Seriously relax, your kid isn't going to spontaneously combust just because he's away from you for a week. Can your husband feed and clothe him? Make sure he takes his meds if he has any? Are his parents capable of taking care of a 15 month old (I would assume so since your husband survived his childhood)?     Let him take his kid to visit his parents and enjoy the time off of mommy duty that he's giving you.|`|HF97Rs9qaa	I personally agree with you. 15 months old is too young to be away from his mommy for a whole week.    It is not fair or right for him to go against your wishes and just take your son away from you for a week. He would not want you making decisions that go against what he feels with no regards to him at all. Parenting is a joint effort not I do whatever I want with our child regardless of how the other person feels.    I would ask him to compromise and wait till you can get time off work and go with him. Why would he want to leave you behind on a "family" trip anyway?????     I think the two of you need to talk it out and a decision you both can agree with needs to be made. Just taking your son away from you for a week should not even be an option if you are not okay with it.    Goodluck!|`|AA10987824	If one parent says yes, shouldn't the other parent respect their wishes?    Calm down, he's your husband...you trusted him enough to marry and have children, let him take his own children out of state if he wants.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	My daughter is 14 months and there is no way in HELL that I would be away from her for a whole week......I would just miss her way too much...its not a matter of trusting my husband it is just that she is still so young....|`|9Q1muFGXaa	My mom has taken my daughter when she was that age to florida for a week and we live in ohio. I had no problems with it and neither did my husband. They went to go to disney world and visit with my uncle.  You cant be over protective with him. Things will even happen while in your care. My duaghter as i recall even got sick a day before they left. My mom took her to the ER there,which I wish she had waited cuz she didn't need to go to ER. It was a COLD. She even took the little girl that she babysat with her. that little girls parents didnt have a problem with it. your husband and the grandparents will take care of him. relax. If i was the grandparents or your husband i would be so upset with you. You have to learn to share. They dont get to see him that much and he lives with you so you see him a lot. Take the week they are gone and have fun and just spend some alone time for yourself. He will be fine. He is your husbands son to not just yours.|`|tmh42R6Caa	I think he has every right to want to take your son to visit his grandparents.  You have every right to miss him, but you can't ignore your husband's opinion.  You should let him go.  Enjoy a few days to yourself.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Honestly i agree with your husband. Thats your husbands child to not just yours!  I dont think its crossing the line at all. He has just as much right to take the 15 month old out of state as you do. He is not to young to be away from mommy and its not like its gonna be for weeks on end. I think it should be fine.|`|7geLpG6Oaa	I'm sorry. I know your son is very young and it's hard to be away from them, especially if you haven't before. But that is his father. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect to take him to his parents house. It's not like he's a stranger, he's capable of taking care of his son. I was never away from my son overnight until my daughter was born. My son was 20months old and he actually did really really great. Your son might be upset for a day or so but he'll get over it. And when he gets to see you again he'll be so excited. He should have oppurtunities to see his grandparents, they won't be around forever and I'm sure he'll have fun. I do know that it's very very hard to let him go and the first instinct is to say no. You might enjoy a week to yourself too.|`|WqkOI7RDaa	My first out-of-state plane trip: 5 weeks.  We went to see my grandparents, and I turned out fine.  Oh, and if you never cut the umbilical cord he's gonna grow up to be a sissy momma's boy. No offense.|`|SOt3a4xYaa	Well obviously if you are against it then your husband should not take your son with him. That would show that he doesn't respect you. However, you also have to consider that he has somes 'wishes' too, and I don't think it is wrong for him to want to take his son to visit his grandparents. 15 months old is still young, but you have to understand that you can't hold on to him forever. You need to trust your husband and understand that he can take care of his child. Think of it this way: If your son is too young to be away from you for a week, then that must mean he is too young to be away from his father for a week (if he stayed with you, he would be). That's the only fair way to think of it.|`|kmQqbxpQaa	Question:  if your son stays with you and you are working then who will watch your son while you are at work?  Also, you would rather trust this person to watch your son over your husband?    I understand that you will miss him greatly and your hubby sounds a bit insensitive, but like all wives (myself included), you seem to think  you outrule him.|`|8DDK2K5baa	you see the problem with your logic is you think your son NEEDS you. you HOPE that your son cant be without you.    the harsh reality is: he will be completely fine. you cant smother him.     you ARE being overprotective and need to back off|`|3KyVMVncaa	I think you should just relax and let him take the baby. It will give you a little break and you know how Grandparents are. He will be well taken care of. I understand your reasoning, I am that way too but, just take a deep breath and think about stretching out in a big bed all by yourself, no hubby bothering you in the middle of the night, no waking up early to take care of everyone else's needs before yours.  Man, I wish mine was going on vacation..... Haha!!    Good luck!|`|mLWYHm2vaa	I would have absolutely no problem with my 17 month old going away with his dad for a week, except missing him terribly. I trust his father to care for him at home, so i trust him to take care of him anywhere. I think the problem is not he's too young to be away from you, but rather that he's too young for you to want to be away from him.|`|sciO32Bsaa	Not all parents agree on everything, it's just one of the many fun things we deal with as parents.  Yes, he is only 15 mos and you are going to miss him dearly and rightfully so but if your husband has the time to take your little one to visit his grandparents that I'm guessing he doesn't get to see often, you should really let him go!  Yes, he'll be away from Mommy but he will be with his Daddy, it's not like he's going off with strangers for a week.
HXfHkoSHaa	Sounds like a definite case of pink eye.  My daughter's pediatrician said when kids get colds then rub their eyes, they can get pink eye.  The doc should give y'all some drops that'll clear it right up.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Usually the eye looks very pink and red around the eye and in the whites of the eye, but if it is pink eye, keep everyone else away from him, it is very contagious.|`|KlQO9CYgaa	I actually just got over pink eye and I can tell you that it doesn't come with a fever or cold symptoms. To me it sounds like he may just have a cold or the flu. If he had pink eye, he'd be rubbing his eyes a lot due to extreme irritation. I think it's good that you are taking him to the doctor. Hope he feels better! Good luck.|`|yB8djbeNaa	could be conjunctivitis|`|YX93lq4daa	I had terrible pink eye along with that I had many periods of very high fever and a cold.    it sounds very much like pink eye.. it can be caused by both bacteria or viruses

Their not too much trouble but they do need to be entertained.
bmoCpcdraa	yes up to 6 weeks but call your doctor they answers questions for free be on the safe side|`|F8iyUqJBaa	If you've gone on the pill it just sounds like you've stopped postpartum bleeding and you're just having your period now.|`|8WRnqs08aa	Each individual is different.

So why dont you do invitro fertilization using your husbands sperm? Also why dont you AND your husband get tested just to make sure if its just you that has the problem or to see if your husbands sperm count is too low. It might not be your fault that you arent able to have a baby. Talk about it with your husband.|`|GcJszsMnaa	Well hun... you do got a chance to be.... but if your not you can try....Fertility Blend...for woman....It's like a prenatal..in some ways...but with a fertility formula mix...as well there cheap on this site..like 23.50sum thing..www.Iherb.com An got good delivery time...I been on it 12 days now I'm waiting til it's been a month on it...For my BFP soon after...You can read about it on here ladies talked a lot of good things about it.. I can't find anything bad about it...But GOOD luck Hun...!|`|D6kwriPxaa	Go to a fertility doctor and find out what the problem is.|`|175ydQo5aa	You can use some of my super sperm? (not kidding) just dont come after me for child support.|`|jaP0TANdaa	I'm sorry you've gotten so many answers from men who have nothing better to do with their time then hang out in the TTC section. I feel your pain... I've been TTC for about 8 cycles now too and no success. I was on Depo for a long time though (last shot in March 2008), so I'm sure this is most of my problem and I'm SCARED TO DEATH that there is something "wrong" with me. I've a little over my BMI too, but if you're missing periods I'd guess that's the least of your worries. Usually if you're skipping periods you're really having extremely long cycles and possible not ovulating at all, thus you can't get pregnant. Do you do charting? The first step is to figure out if you're ovulating or not... then go from there. I would strongly suggest taking Vitex as it helped my cycle this month. I just started taking it this month (one pill in the morning, one at night) and already saw a change. I ovulated much sooner and my luteal phase was extended by two days. If late or no ovulation is your problem, perhaps Vitex can help you too! There's always the option of consulting a doctor too. Being that you are missing periods they will most likely do a consultation before the official "year" is up. Good luck to you!|`|mgiJVjaKaa	Test now, and if you aren't pregnant then talk to a doctor. But some couples - normal healthy couples - take up to a year to get pregnant. They say not to be worried until you've been actively trying for a year with no success. But you can always talk to your doctor early to at least figure out why your cycle is sometimes messed up and have no period. You might not be ovulating every month.|`|U6XzrG91aa	Adopt a child.|`|4WNeBRjVaa	I dont like BMI- I'm in fairly good shape and I'm one point to being obese! Have you been tracking your ovulation? Just type ovulation calendar into google. That way you can track it, without having to buy a test.   I know the feeling of a negative pregnancy test. But you need to find out becuase obviously it's eating at you.     You also should try to relax as much as possible-being stressed doesn't help to make babies. Good luck! I hope everything works out for you
256cVXsmaa	Hey =]  I am 19 weeks pregnant and I def have a bump.  No one can ever tell though because I always wear a tight zip up jacket.  Although the zip ups are really tight now they really do suck you right in.  Underneath the zip up I wear a tight long tank top over the secret fit maternity belly shirt.    No one has yet to be able to tell I am pregnant =]    EDIT: I ALSO FORGOT TO SAY, Wearing a cute scarf with your outfit def works too.  If it's long enough it always seems to camouflage the baby bump!!|`|bmoCpcdraa	baggy cloths but i hope you see a doctor they wont tell your office|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Baggy clothes.  Black is a good color.  Wear more jackets.  Maybe start wearing babydoll tops, and dresses.|`|bAp35x7uaa	The only suggestion I have for keeping it secret is to not rub your belly in the office.    I thought I was doing a great job hiding my bump wearing baggy clothes etc, but as soon as I told everyone they said they already knew because I kept rubbing my bump subconsciously.  I'm such an idiot, LOL|`|m25lpepOaa	Where clothes that aren't form fitting. They don't have to be baggy, necessarily, just looser fitting. You can also walk around the office and just mention to coworkers that you think you need to get yourself on a diet because you are gaining weight.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	wear black, for one. It helps.|`|jUO5holFaa	I am Due in August too - the 7th! And I have a bump too and have not yet told my work!! I Just wear baggyish clothes! all the best xx|`|Lx5vYz9jaa	just complain about how fat ur getting!!!|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	The only thing I can think to suggest it maybe wear looser fitting tops, maybe like those ones that flow out more towards the bottom (sort of like maternity tops often do).  I never really bought/wore maternity clothes when I was preg, but did wear a lot of those types of shirts I already  had over summer (I was 3 months mid May then).|`|joPJtKemaa	I was in the same situation, I tried hiding it and people still noticed.    It depends, some women show right away and some don't, if you are not showing yet maybe you can get away with it.    Goodluck!!!!!!|`|4dx98G8oaa	wear sweatshirts?|`|rC6gL7KOaa	I would say wear bigger clothes but on second thought, that would only make you look bigger, which will make people question if you're  pregnant. So really I don't know, just don't wear any body slimmers, corsets, gurdles, or anything like that.|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	Congratulations to you.     These websites might be helpful to you:      http://community.thenestbaby.com/cs/ks/b... or    http://www.ehow.com/video_4441460_hiding...|`|VT24zOomaa	My best friend was the baby doll top, snug on the top, then flows down the front!    i didn't tell my work right away either, and they never knew because i gradually switch the type of clothing i wore. i also still wear those tops now, they are great, and you can wear them after you have the baby!  also cheaper than maternity tops.

tBQEfgnraa	i think that it is great that you are raising your boys on your own. i have a son and it gets hard sometimes, but i know that i have to do it and be stronge for him. you let them know about him and dont talk about him in front of them because it can change what they think about him. tell them the truth and dont hind anything let them know up front. how old are the kids cause that changes alot of things. if they ole enough then let them know about him and its up to them if they want to talk when he do come around. best of  luck with you and your kids|`|0Nm30xWFaa	Being a single parent is tough all on it's own, I understand your concern as a single Mom with boys. The best thing you can do is be involved get them involved in activities such as Baseball for youth and school sports where they are involved with men and other boys who may be in a similiar situation. Another good resource is Big Brother's as well as your local YMCA as well as Boy Scouts. As far as what to say about the absent Father... Be kind, allow your little men to love their Dad and always make them feel special and give them the assurance that they were brought into this world with love and that Dad is most likely always got them in his thoughts and heart whether you believe this or not is not important, the important thing is that they believe and you all will be just fine.

Ka52nbhNaa	If you don't want to have a baby . . . then it is probably time to start using protection as you have been lucky!<br>  <br>  Conception is about more than sex - the woman needs to ovulate an egg, the male needs to ejaculate healthy sperm and the sperm and egg must then find each other.  If they find each other, pregnancy is still not a definite as the fertilized embryo must then successfully implant.  At any of these points, something could go wrong when you are trying to conceive.<br>  <br>  A healthy couple with perfectly timed intercourse only has a 20 - 25% chance for success on any given cycle.|`|zATQaiwIaa	well then by God i hope you get some birth control - you sound like you should be in school still, not having sex 5x a day!  Please, use protection!!!!!|`|DfNb8SZiaa	cause they use protection and they are careful.....|`|dy34Qyugaa	Instead of wasting your time having sex five times a day, you should go to school, learn to spell, and stop being a jackass.|`|3e379b57ba770c0a315cfe12dbeeea34aa	couse sperm is exousted.No,it s just that the body produces smaller amounts so sperm is not strong or enought|`|AA10561878	Their age.

Apply an anti- fungal to the area twice daily, purchase a new bra, or go without one, and keep the inflamed area dry of sweat.|`|ad47e66108ebe5b08193efaa9725a287aa	It looks like a heat rash.  Try to keep it dry and stop wearing a bra until it gets better.  Go see your doctor and maybe you can get a cream for it.

(You said that your breasts have grown, so I am thinking maybe your bra is a little tight, which contributes to the rash.)<br>  <br>  Or try going without a bra, if you can.  I know not everyone can do that.  To get rid of the itch, try using cornstarch - it is probably the mildest thing you can use to treat it.<br>  <br>  Stay cool this summer, and good luck with the rest of the pregnancy!|`|KqZ19MzEaa	I don't really know what you can use for that, you'd have to ask a doctor. Whenever I have a rash in that area I shower and go braless for a bit and apply some lotion to it. Just let it breathe.

In short, yes, there is still a chance you can be pregnant.<br>  And please DON'T wear two condoms, the friction created between the condoms causes them to rip, which increases the likelihood of pregnancy or transmission of an STI.|`|NoHXd3lWaa	Yes, there is a very small possibility that the condom is defective. It's very rare but there is no 100% effective birth contraceptive.<br>  <br>  But its soooo rare. The chances of you being pregnant is equal to you finding 500 bucks in your shoe. However, if you are really so worried, you should use more than one contraceptive. Use birth control and condoms.

Boa sorte.|`|f6e7dcb3d37edfda288f18e8e8f7d392aa	Pouco provavel, os sintomas normalmente demoram até umas<br>  5 semanas para realmmente ser visiveis ou sentidas,<br>  sem falar que vc tomou anti concepcional durante um ano e meio, e na maioria dos casos que eu conhe?o, demora<br>  pelo menos alguns meses para o corpo normnalizar a falta do ormonio.<br>  Mas..a melhor coisa, compra o teste de farmacia, pelo menos desencana|`|NXgSkmfeaa	Pelo tempo que vc toma o anti... seria um pouco provavel que vc tenha tido uma ovuula??o...<br>  Dia acordo com o dia que vc mesntruo é mei dificil pq vc ainda estava em periodo da mesntrua??o mesmo n?o estando sagrando.E a ovula??o ocorrre 3 dia e antes e depois do 14° dia do ciclo.<br>  Mais isso que vc está sentido pode ser muito mais do seu pisicologico,pq eu n?o tive rela??es durante um periodo mestrual parei de tomar o anti... e sentia os seios tbm doloridos.E como 9 dia n?o deu ainda pra barriga endurecer n?o.|`|1cFdGlZLaa	oie, olha pelo q vc me falou, n tem como esta gravida n, usou a camisinha, n tem problema, uma dica: quando vcs fizererm da proxima vez faz o teste, depois de tira-la, enche-a de agua ate a boca p ver se ela ta furada ou n. E essas dores pode ser gravidez psicologica, quando ficamos com medo de engravidar ocorre isso, nosso organismo come?a a reagir dessa forma, mas espera um pouco deve ser psicologico, mas se as dores continuarem é melhor ir ao medico, pode ser outra coisa: gravidez, ou ate, uma outra doen?a!!!

Antes disso qualquer sintoma é de origem psicológica e algumas mulheres passam pela gravidez inteira sem apresentarem qualquer sintoma exceto a ausência da menstrua??o. Boa sorte.|`|T6Oogw9kaa	O primeiro sinal de suspeita de gravidez é o atraso da menstrua??o. Após dez dias de atraso deve-se realizar a dosagem de beta-hCG em laboratório.

I guess with Evia they will all be 4 letters.<br>  <br>  You could also consider:<br>  <br>  Erika<br>  Elsa<br>  Enid<br>  Evan/Evin<br>  Etta<br>  Emma<br>  Emily<br>  Elisa<br>  Eloise<br>  Evelyn|`|KBY67SVQaa	personally, i dont like it at all... anytime you have say it more than once to get it to sound decent or spell it out for people to be able to pronounce it right it just doesnt work.

I never thought about putting these two together.  I'm still roling it over in my head.  I guess it really depends on how it sounds like your last name.  My last name is Davis.

I am sorry but I do like the name Laura Rose, Laura Peyton, Laura Elizabeth, Laura Merriam, I do like the name Lilly Kate, Sarah Lilly is pretty so good luck and CONGRATULATIONS! on your baby. Oh remember that children can be mean to each other when they go to school so please make sure it is not  a name that children can easily tease your child with, it could scar a child for life when that happens.

(well, almost)<br>  once i got into year 11 i found it so hard to get motivated to do my work. alot of my coursework was handed in late and i left my revision for my exams almost right up until the night before. i used to be one of those girls who sit in the corner and get on with my work but found it so hard to resist joining in messing on with the rest. i still do. i think if i hadnt let myself get distracted and got my work done on time i would have done so much better in my exams. i've realised now it's best to stay on top of the work. i've promised myself now that i will work until all my homework is done (meaning i dont get distracted so much especially if there's something i really want to do later) and i'll catch up on my work if i didnt do any in the lesson. <br>  <br>  basically, nomatter how much you'll rather be doing something else, keep on top of it and keep working hard. it really does pay off.|`|D6qhkajBaa	I felt the exact same way when I was at school .

Year 11 is just practise and preparation for year 12, as such both Year 11 + 12 are called the VCE program. This also means that the 'juniors' arnt called juniors. All 11/12's are called seniors.|`|M6WMB20vaa	I never did.

Freshman Follies: That's when you're a freshman, you still think you're hot stuff because you were at the top of the school in eighth grade, and also, 9th grade is disgustingly easy.<br>  <br>  2. Sophomore Slump: You're bored with the whole 'High School' thing, and it's starting to lose its newness.<br>  <br>  3. Junior Jitters: All you're hearing about is SATs, college applications, etc.  You're stressed out about college, they pack a lot of work in junior year, so it is stressful.<br>  <br>  4. Senior Sorrows: You realize that, in spite of its crappiness, high school wasn't that bad, and you're afraid to enter college.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to realize that you only have a year left, and you'll be out.  Just focus on your schoolwork, and see how fast the year goes by.  Good luck!|`|IHw2qUtcaa	OMG YES!!<br>  <br>  My geography teacher is ALWAYS on my case, I haven't had a lunch time at school for the last 2 days cause shes a *****.

My french teacher ALWAYS tells me I'm gonna fail french.. I really don't like french and her telling me and I'm gonna fail aint making it any better. My english teacher starts 1 piece of coursework gives you about a week to do rough draft AND type it up, he's carrying about that cause I have loads of half finished coursework.

FKApExj2aa	Ciara Melody is so beautiful!!<br>  I love those names, and they go really well together.<br>  I also love Dylan Mackenzie - Two unique names which sound great together.<br>  Great choices! =)|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I adore the name Dylan but instead of ciara i love the name sienna|`|pxhS7ol6aa	Oh, they're lovely names, I really like the name Melody and Dylan and Mackenzie go great together.<br>  <br>  They're both beautiful names.|`|ZKDIMnVKaa	I like Ciara Melody not too crazy about Dylan Mackenzie for a boy sounds more like a girl name|`|8w0786yeaa	I like Dylan Mackenzie better for a girl.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	You're going to get a lot of people saying Key-Ah-Ra, not Sierra.|`|5d4a98ef0b6163a6f10b0c267b9ae934aa	When I think of the name Mackenzie, I think of a girl.  My best friend named her daughter Mackenzie Rene and we nicknamed her Kenzie.  Ciara I really like.  Dylan...eh? I think of the show Rugrats.  |`|e5ab8861f853dfb5e950f381962e8e78aa	Above all make sure that the names will not date  badly. How do you think middle aged men called Elvis and Duane or old ladies called Dolores feel? |`|pHAKN32yaa	For our next child if it's a boy, we were going to pick the name Dylan. I absolutely LOVE it! <br>  <br>  Both are very very good choices!<br>  CONGRATS!!! XXXXX|`|ByWRzuuraa	Lol i thort Ciara was pronouced See-air-a.<br>  I like both of them names :)<br>  x|`|joT6bbSXaa	I love both of the names they are lovely (: x|`|e17025d63b591426b1c43c2197cd3fc8aa	I think they are extremely boring. |`|sINAaRudaa	Wow they are nice good luck!|`|nZBtm3meaa	I really like them.  Great choices!!|`|WaDGhX3haa	I like Ciara Melody but how would you pronounce it? Keer-uh is the traditional pronounciation, but because of the R&B who pronounces it Sierra a lot of people will pronounce it like Sierra. Regardless of what pronounciation you use people you meet will use one of them so you will end up correcting people on the pronounciation either way. <br>  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't use Dylan Mackenzie for a boy. Dylan is pretty much a unisex name now (helped by female Dylans on Desperate Housewives and Charlie's Angels) and Mackenzie is technically unisex but most people will associate it only with girls, and most people would probably see a unisex first name and a girl's middle name and they would assume Dylan Mackenxie is a girl. I think something like Dylan Matthew would work better. = ]|`|AA11554857	The Ciara Melody is ok but I do not like the Dylan Mackenzie. I think of Mackenzie as being feminine. If you are wanting something that starts with an M, I would suggest finding a baby name website that lets you type in a name and then it gives you the masculine version along with the name in other languages. I used this website a few months ago trying to help my cousin. Just google "baby names creator".|`|EUPYaMasaa	Dylan is a unisex name and so is Mackenzie but when i hear it i automaticly think of a girl|`|oY92A0RZaa	Ciara Melody is a cute name...<br>  Dylan Mackenzie...Mackenzie sounds like a girl's name|`|LTBrUtosaa	i love mackenzie <br>  <br>  dylan mackenzie love it <br>  <br>  <br>  ahh i love them both|`|Bgez0LCMaa	ciara is cute,<br>  but i dont know if i'd go melody for the middle namee...<br>  what about ciara mackenzie?|`|xtefH34Eaa	I like the girls name I don't like dylan though... mackenzie is nice and it could also work for a boy or a girl.<br>  <br>  By the way congrats|`|THaLECpTaa	they are both beautiful names especially the girls name<br>  |`|RzZ911Sgaa	I don't like Mackenzie for the boys middle name, it sounds feminine|`|ZhQh57dZaa	I like them.

GqvAXWNcaa	WOW. It's such a pretty name. I love it. :)<br>  And it's unique.<br>  It's not hippy at all. When I heard it I just thought of a really pretty girl.<br>  She won't be picked on. I would never pick on someone with a name like that. To be honest, I'd love to be called Autumn rainbow. :)<br>  What is with all these "hippy" stuff. It doesn't sound hippy at all. People care about the personality more than the name. <br>  Seriously people do you judge people by their names and not be their friend cause of that?|`|9OKG0a5Baa	my instinct is to say no.  autumn is pretty but rainbow is a bit silly.  yet i like it.  somehow it works, especially with the reasons behind the choice.  so, yes i do.  even if it does sound like she was born at glastonbury festival in 1971|`|qXq0nmBzaa	sorry, no<br>  <br>  it sounds like something a movie mogul of the 40s would come up with for a child star or a drug-addled hippie name<br>  <br>  certainly not a name that will sound good for a responsible adult which you would hope she would become|`|w9cicy0Daa	I went out with a girl called Summer Meadow, when we were arrested at a festival in the 80s, her parents had to drive 80 miles to the police station to prove to the police that was her real name.|`|MfKWHH4Naa	Maybe too earthy.

Dakota could be a girl or a boy to me.<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats.<br>  |`|gP2lgeFHaa	Devon Reece: All of the guys I know with this name pronounce is "De-Von", so I am not a fan of the Dev-in pronunciation. If you like Devin, use Devin. Personally, I think it's cuter anyway. <br>  <br>  Kayson Bailey: It's okay. Bailey always reminds me of girls or small white dogs. Kayson is cute, but Kason is a more masculine spelling. The "y" makes it look cutesy, but not manly. Kason Bay is cute. <br>  <br>  Adden Kaleb: I would have pronounced this Aid-en. Adden is okay... I like Adden Kaleb is nice together. <br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  Nikayla Shontel: I like Nicola as a spelling better, it looks classier. <br>  <br>  Tahlia Jayde: Very cute. I love the name Tahlia, it's beautiful and not over used.<br>  <br>  Dakota Alexis:  Nice, I like Dakota with Logan and Charli. Alexis Dakota is also cute.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	I'll rate them on a scale of 1-10 (1=hate,10=love).<br>  <br>  Devon Reece ~ 3 (Devon is nice, but I dislike Reece.)<br>  <br>  Kayson Bailey ~ 6 (Very cool names. I think Kayson is really cool and creative, but the spelling looks feminine. I think Kason looks more masculine. Or maybe Kacen? I personally prefer Bailey for a girl, but it's nice as a middle name for Kayson.)<br>  <br>  Adden Kaleb ~ 3 (The names go nice together, but I really don't care for Adden. At first I thought it was a creative spellign for Aidan, until I read your pronounciation. Kaleb is cool. I like it with a K. I think Aidan Kaleb sounds nice. {Aiden, Aaden, Aden, Ayden, Aydon, etc}.)<br>  <br>  Nikayla Shontel ~ 4 (Sorry, but I'm not liking Nikayla. I love Makayla though. The N and the M sounds sound kind of similar so I think Nikayla would forever be correcting people. Shontel is really cool. Great middle name choice!)<br>   <br>  Tahlia Jayde ~ 4 (Tahlia is ok. I don't love it or hate it. Jayde is ok. Just as a suggestion, how about Jaida as a first name?)<br>  <br>  Dakota Alexis ~ 5 (I can't decide how I feel about Dakota. Alexis is ok. I don't really care for the A sounds so close together: dakotA Alexis.)<br>  <br>  I really like that all of your boys names end in N.I have a bunch of boys names I love that end in N.

I give it a 6.<br>  <br>  Adden Kaleb.  Adden will always be pronounced as "Aiden" and Kaleb is cute.  I give it a 4.<br>  <br>  Nikayla Shontel is cute, but looks a little cumbersome.  Try Nykaila, perhaps? Hmm...still looks long....I don't know what to do here.<br>  <br>  Tahlia Jayde is cute, but once again you are going to have pronunciation issues.  It looks like Towel-ya.  Try Taliah, Taleah, Taleea, Taleya?<br>  <br>  Dakota Alexis is very cute, but I have only known boys named Dakota....how about Sydney Alexis?  Still a Western-ish name, but more feminine?<br>  <br>  Favorite Girl Name: Tahlia Jayde<br>  Favorite Boy Name: Kayson Bailey and Devon Reece are tied.|`|z5laJ7L9aa	Devon Reece - Like This Name The Best Out Of The 3.<br>  Kayson Bailey - Not Quite Fond Of This One But Kayson Adden Is Quite Nice.<br>  Adden Kaleb - Would Like It Better If It Was Adden Reece<br>  <br>  Girls names:<br>  Nikayla Shontel - You Should Change It To Nikayla Jayde - Like That One Too.<br>  Tahlia Jayde - Love This Name - Soo Cute And Pretty<br>  Dakota Alexis - I Think Its Abit Of A Unisex Name And Dont Really Like It.(Thats Just My Opinion)<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped..<br>  <br>  x<br>  |`|4863f8dd77952e57a9c03006243c12c6aa	Devon Reece   [ its  cute ]<br>  Kayson Bailey  [ i like this one alot. ]<br>  Adden Kaleb  [ dont like this one ]<br>  <br>  Girls names:<br>  Nikayla Shontel [ its ok. not that great ]<br>  Tahlia Jayde  [ favorite ]<br>  Dakota Alexis [dont like]|`|ufDmHCPcaa	I love Dakota Alexis.

AA11232354	I would start by praising her for growing bigger and becomeing more grown up.  Then I would start telling her frequently that she is getting so grown up that she will soon be using the toilet like the big people, like bigger kids.  I would praise her and show her that she used to be a baby but look how good she is doing, how she can now eat at the table, help Mom, talk, and play games that the baby cannot play.  You have already taught her the beginnings of using the toilet, all she needs now is the will to do what you taught her.  Continue to treat her in a more grown up style, talk to her at her true maturity level.  When she is comfortable being more grown up, her toileting habits will mature, too.  Right now she feels she has to compete with the baby, to be a baby again to get your attention and love, but you will begin showing her that she has a special place in your heart for the young lady that she really is.|`|u4xSC0HCaa	This relapse is quite common, especially considering she's under 2 years old.  You will probably have to start from the bottom again with her.<br>  <br>  My son is 28 months and I wanted to potty train him before his younger sibling comes along (in one week!!!) but he really resisted the idea - hates to have his clothes off, and loves his diapers.  We read that it's better to wait until after 2 years old, and with him, he's just not ready.  He is plenty mature enough to understand the process, he doesn't want to do it for himself!  I don't want to make a fight out of it, so I encourage but don't force and sometimes that's all you can do.<br>  <br>  I would say - don't sweat the small stuff, let her go diapers for a few months and then try again after the new baby has become less new :)|`|HZf9Cv3Vaa	My Daughter Is doing the same thing right now, All i did was make her be there when i change my baby and let her know that only the baby wheres diapers and big girls go to the potty. I let her help out with the baby so she can feel more grown, she just needs help to understand that its ok to potty in the toilet and still be your baby! It worked for me.|`|AA11922860	she is doing it because of the attention your giving the baby and she jealous. just explain to her why a baby needs a diaper and a big kid like her who can use the potty doesn't. then have her help change, feed etc,  the baby and give her some alone time without the baby and she will come around.|`|AA10561878	Use a newspaper.|`|gx4s68s8aa	It is very normal for this to happen since she just had a baby brother.  And remember she is not yet 2.  If I were you, I would put back on the diapers for a few weeks and not worry about it.  In a month or so you might try asking her to go to the potty.  Don't rush it.  Wait until she is ready again.  She is going through so many changes right now, the diaper is likely a comfort.<br>  <br>  Likely in a couple of weeks or months she will be out of the diapers and going back to the potty.  Don't worry it will happen.
dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Congratulations<br>  You both needs family support and both needs to stay in school<br>  <br>  Cheyenne I like the best<br>  I like<br>  Chevonne, it's gaelic means god is gracious<br>  I just think it's cool and different by similiar to other names<br>  |`|CMuL7XpKaa	Virginia you know why don't ya Georgia is nice to|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I like Cheyenne or even the Montianna (Monti-onna) that the earlier poster mentioned that is really pretty. <br>  More importantly than the name at this point you need to be thinking about the responsibility that this baby is going to bring, you need to sit down and figure out exactly what you are going to do. I know three different couples that got married just because they got pregnant, one couple is together and happily married, one couple is together and can't stand eachother but it is economically easier to stay together and raise the kids and divorce after the kids are out of the house, and one couple got a divorce before the baby was two. Another option is adoption, both of you are young and I don't see with how the world is today you are going to be able to raise the baby by yourself so unless you have a lot of help, this is maybe something you should look into. I got pregnant when I was 16 and miscarried, I got in an accident. And every christmas season I think about what my now would have been seven year old child would have been like. What would I have named them? And I am sad, but I have a career, I have a house we are almost done building that won't have a mortgage, I have a wonderful husband that I would not have met if I had a child, I am in college, I am enjoying life and its freedoms, everything happens for a reason, so think really hard about what this is going to affect and how the two of you are going to handle this. Good luck|`|ZYouNFQbaa	Cheyenne is nice, not fussed on Montana, a girl in my sons class is called Montianna, that is prettier and a little different|`|UFFGF2XEaa	you should mostly and firstly care about what the heck you are thinking not the names and btw both names are awfully harsh and tacky...and why we should care about how old are you?|`|192VzAFGaa	sounds like a horse ranch or something......terrible names|`|j3pUIxv3aa	Montana is different, but Cheyenne is much nicer. I have to say though, that Cheyenne is becoming more popular. How about Savanna?|`|azIJoIdIaa	neither.  theyre both a little far fetched.

MHg9JhEKaa	She wants to know how she and the baby are going to fit into your life when you have been married before and already have kids. <br>  <br>  Please don't ignore her questions about your ex and kids, be really open - she needs to know the answers to these before she's ready to talk about yours and the baby's future. <br>  <br>  She probably wants reassurance you won't go back to your ex. She might feel second best, remember you have been there before with the whole marriage and kids thing...obviously it's not going to be as special this time round for you as it might be for her.<br>  <br>  Your ex and kids are not everything, but actually they ARE quite a bit to do with you two now. Has she met your ex, does she know your kids, will she be expected to become a step-mother, will you fall apart like your last relationship, is she really ready for a baby? All these things will be swimming around in her mind. <br>  <br>  I can understand she's wary...try to think of it from her side: first serious relationship, not living together, she's independant, and now pregnant, it's all moving so very fast. All this coupled with the above makes for a confused, hormonal, and worried woman!  She doesn't want to pick a fight, she's probably just frustrated you aren't seeing things from her persepective. <br>  <br>  So my advice is hold off on your feelings and wants for the short term future, and listen to her, she needs to know about your past. Tell her about your ex and kids, answer any questions she has. If you want to marry her it's important you're able to talk about this, even if that means visiting unpleasant memories. Then you can move on to talking about you two, one step at a time. |`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	Ugh....you sound almost like my ex. he wanted a baby so bad that he lied to me because he knew I don't believe in abortions. Just man up and shut the **** up. Don't talk just work at proving you are taking care of your other children using nothing but actions and no words. I just hate men who think their gf should get pregnant when they want them  to without the gf consideration in mind (my ex is 45 and I am 22). if you can do that then she might change her mind. do you have a STEADY job with STEADY income? Do you pay child support for those other kids? Do you have YOUR own house and YOUR own car? DO you know have money saved for emergencies cause it sounds you are just looking for a family with a woman who probably didn't want a child at the moment (like me) and feels like you are being immature about this.. if you have all those and take care of your other kids , then you should have no problems. Just next time ASK HER. so she can be ready and happy as you are. She even talks to you so that means she is listening to you. i told my ex I hate him and wants his head on a silver platter while i raise the child myself. JUST GET YO ACT TOGETHER AND MAN UP AND SHOW YOU CAN BE A GOOD FATHER TO ALL YOUR CHILDREN.|`|8Rq20myeaa	wrap your damn meat and stop asking this question.

Build up your trust with her and dont let her down.<br>  congrats xx|`|aGxbD6snaa	as you have only just found out she may just be scared and not sure how to deal with it so pushing you away feels like the easiest option for her. you need to talk to her about how you feel and explain that you want it to work out. she may be nervous that you will leave her etc. pregnancy can be scary at any age and if she wasnt ready for a baby its probably harder on her until she gets used to the idea. but i really do suggest you openly talk to her as she may want to get things off her chest that she doesnt know how to say. i doubt she would terminate behind your back, you need to trust her and get to the bottom of her worries so you both know where you stand and can start planning for your unborn childs future. good luck.|`|ifUB8Zziaa	she is probably just worried that things wont work out for the both of you, as you have kids prom a previous relationship. pregnancy is a hard time for all women you become very emotional and hormones all over the place. you should just be there for her and don't push the subject with her right now. tell her you love her and always will. i wouldn't worry to much she needs you to be the strong rational one right now just support her in every way you can. im sure she will come round and see that you do love her and everything will be ok|`|jGOPgcw5aa	Ask her if she'd be willing to sit down with a third party and talk.  Sometimes having an unbiased party (counselor or mediator) can help you find out what each person is really thinking.<br>  <br>  Or, you could go out and buy a ring.  Propose.  Tell her you'll wait for her to be ready, of course, but make it clear that you want to be responsible for her and this child, and that you will be their to support her through this.  If she needs some space to "process", try to give her that space but ask her to keep you a part of her decision making process.|`|cal8y3Adaa	perhaps she doesn't feel ready for kids, in which case you need to respect her wishes. discuss it properly with her, ask her what she wants to do, as this is a decision that needs to be made by both of you. if one of you isn't ready, then maybe a child isn't the best idea.|`|ulGcg5dkaa	Give her a ring, when alot of women get pregnant there body goes through alot of changes so she is just maybe having bad mood swings.That is totally normal for pregnant women.|`|FLFBCVhUaa	Propose, show her you want a serious relationship with her and only her.|`|ByWRzuuraa	Buy her a ring and ask her to marry you.<br>  Have the baby, They are absolute joys :)<br>  Good luck.<br>  x|`|GVcudkVoaa	Why don't you ask her to marry you?

63bxt86taa	i rang me boyfriend (i tested while i was at work, in a different town, i didnt want to wait until i got home) i said "i have something you tell you, youre going to be a daddy" and he was in utter shock. lol. after about 10 minutes (thankfully) he could speak and was over the moon!!! lol!!<br>  <br>  <br>  you'll be fine, you'll know what to say when the time comes.<br>  congrats!!!! xxxxxx|`|LmgDTXTlaa	I told my partner by text...i didn't really mean to but i was a work and did a test on my dinner and he was working so i didn't know what to do.

BUT a whole year has passed and our beautiful little girl is here now so i don't think it really matters anymore. I may matter at the time...but its not the finding out your will remember forever, its the actual baby you'll remember and the birth.|`|3a16f29d91dc82f5362c9dca7425ed57aa	Just come out and say it<br>  <br>  my boyfriend was 20 when we found out we were expecting <br>  <br>  and he was with me when i took the test x|`|EpfVsCa2aa	Just tell him your pregnant, the most he can do is leave you|`|xTlfOPu5aa	hi hun, we found out i was pregnant at my specialist appointment (for endometriosis) and it was a big shock! but what helped was having my partner with me. i went through a lot of emotions and thoughts about the baby, but now we are both happy. i think the best is to wait until he is home, it is so much more personal to tell him in person and easier for him to take too. if you cant find the words, show him the test! :) also- dont worry if he needs some time to let it sink in and doesnt give you the immediate reaction you were hoping for. remember, you hae had the day to process it, it will be a big shock for him when he gets home from work! best of luck and email me to let me know how everything goes :) x|`|YGDoQbs1aa	Depends on the circumstances.

DLDweOcYaa	1.  Yes you can boil the water ahead of time and leave it in a pitcher at room temperature.<br>  2.  Before you go out you can make up the bottle but only if you are going to feed it to your baby within the hour.  Otherwise you can buy containers to put the formula powder in so you can make it up when you need it.|`|siDcjgJCaa	I boil a big pot of water, let it cool and put it in a pitcher or water jug and use it as needed. When we go out I either fill the bottles with the right amount of water or bring a bottle of water in the diaper bag and a Tupperware full of formula. I  just add the formula as needed. Once made they are only good for 2 hours at room temp so I make them as needed so I dont waste them.|`|WWdgyvU9aa	The way I handled going out with formula was by putting the powder and one of the scoops I had saved from an empty can of formula in a ziploc bag. So I would have water I also added a bottle of water to my son's diaper bag, along with the ziploc bag of formula. If you make the bottles ahead of time you usually end up wasting formula or not having enough formula some times.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	Instead of boiling the water, we bought big jugs of it (just make sure it's not spring water). I would think boiling and leaving it at room temp would be fine though, I just wouldn't do more than a days worth ahead of time. And you can get little containers that hold the formula in dividers, so we would just take a bottle with the right amount of water, and mix the formula in when needed. Good luck :-)|`|EpfVsCa2aa	Dont make the bottle before u go, your not suppose to let it sit for over a hour, there is this thing in stores that u can buy to put milk in and take it with u, i forgot what its called, i have my sons bottle with water in them at room temperature, or when u got out u can take the can of milk with u and just mix it, either or is fine, |`|AA11947878	You can do that with the water and leave it at room temp.<br>  <br>  However formula doesn't keep as well.....I think once you mix it you need to use it soon.  However they make great little powder packs/single servings to go. Just toss in your bag with bottles full of water, that way you can just mix as needed and not waste a bottle. <br>  <br>  |`|zFNTJq9laa	As long as your boiled water is kept in a clean container with the lid on, you can boil it in advance. I used an empty distilled water gallon jug and that worked out well. <br>  <br>  If you are going out and need to supplement, you'll need to keep the formula cold. Mixed formula is good for 24 hours as long as it's refrigerated. They make some little bags that are meant to keep formula cool but I'd invest in some little ice packs as well. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Unfortunately nothing worked for me, but all those usual things have worked for other people I know, a couple of other suggestions would be sitting on top of your washing machine while its on spin cycle and if you have a shower use it on a high power setting but not too hot to massage your bump in a clockwise circular motion, my friend swears this works for starting labour and I must admit I did it with baby number two when I was in the early stages of labour and had him within two hours!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|W2q3x3h7aa	I am sure you have heard this but the baby is ready when he is ready,my son was 2 weeks 4 days late and I went into labor naturally.I think it is a big accomplishment when you can say you waited without waiver until you go into labor or your doctor tells you it would be better for the baby to go ahead and be delivered congrats and you will make it.|`|yd3Hs0q1aa	I put 10 to 12 drops of Clary Sage oil into a warm bath, it stinks but after lying in it for about 30 mins, i started getting tightening in my stomach. |`|AA11308841	i tryed everything like you,no labour so i decided to go for a big car journey (1 h) and bang labour started that night|`|id9c2nDyaa	arguing with natwest over bank charges brought my labour on and i was 41 weeks and 5 days! good luck and congrats|`|ulGcg5dkaa	Do lots of walking and sex I heard that this helps.|`|drDpM6opaa	a lot of sex made me go into early labour |`|ZNsNgpihaa	Walk walk walk....<br>  <br>  This is what i did, try stomping down the stairs, i did this with my 3rd got me going as it helps babe's head go further down and press on the cervix. Some old ones are sex nipple stimuli, fresh pineapple, hot curry, warm bath, and walking loads more i just cannot remember them<br>  <br>  Do not go down the caster oil route<br>  <br>  Baby will arrive soon<br>  <br>  Congrats in advance|`|PK0myXU1aa	Hi, try this site.

Good luck xx <a href="http://www.homebirth.org.uk/overdue.htm#2" rel="nofollow">http://www.homebirth.org.uk/overdue.htm#...</a>|`|wJy2ihNeaa	when they are ready they will come.|`|10378e2ac12dd0ce21216447690f33cfaa	keep trying them all starting with sex -}|`|8Q6gnTLKaa	Lots of sex!  The prostaglandins in semen will help ripen the cervix.  <br>  <br>  Blue or Black Cohosh can help, but get advice from an herbalist on dosing (too much can be dangerous and can cause other complications, be sure to tell the OB/midwife if you use it as I believe one can be a blood thinner and if you were to hemmorage they would need to know)<br>  <br>  Evening Primrose Oil--can be taken orally or you can break the capsules open and place on the cervix--best to do at night<br>  <br>  Castor Oil is no longer recommended as there are studies showing women becoming dehydrated by the diarrhea it causes.  <br>  <br>  And as a couple others said, waiting it out is best.  Your babies may take a little longer to be ready to be born!  An induction often causes many more interventions and pain for you than just letting baby come!<br>  <br>  Best wishes!  Happy labor!

It may seem pretentious to us that 'stars' are calling giving their kids uncommon names but it already makes them individual. Without individuality on some level we are all sheep, following the herd.<br>  <br>  'I wouldn't want to be that kid at school', rubbish, i bet you would love to have a famous parent even if your name was not 'normal'. <br>  <br>  Your a bunch of celebrity junkies, get a life! |`|VXVfwPCYaa	i wonder if any of these crazy mom's consider there kids  when they name them, i understand naming your child something original and different but that name is just dumb. poor kid god bless the kid when she goes to school!|`|vQWt9Dcyaa	I've heard worse (Zuma Nesta Rock is the worst celeb baby name ever) but Coco Lux is pretty terrible.

pCX1dFLzaa	Well it's not illegal, but the 22 year old should probably know better!|`|AA11366224	Going out's OK.  Staying in could be a bit dodgy.|`|A3zAXntxaa	Um, it's illegal, you know that.|`|3yNvJ30jaa	it depends. wat both lovers want. real love? money? sex? something else? i think love can exist with anybody regardless of age,sex and race- but not regardless of maturity and and true emotion. but too many people are used-they are in love with someone and they think that someone really loves them back but in truth-they dont. so just analize the situation okay? good luck!|`|VrjF986Aaa	Ew, I'm 21 and would never date somebody so young. What is wrong with this 22 yr old that they need to prey on children? Depending on where you live, it might even be illegal! If you are the 16 yr old, beware, there has to be a reason this person can't get someone their own age.|`|nZjyIAVhaa	It's legal but a bit dodgy to be honest. The 16 year old needs to get a grip, and for the 22 year old it's a bit pervy! <br>  xx|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Where do you live?<br>  <br>  Tell me privately and, I will find the law for you.|`|snsRyuqyaa	The thing is in the UK it wouldn't be illegal. A 16 year old could have left school and have a full-time job by now (although I believe they have changed the law so you will have to stay in education until you are 18) but also they could have their own house by now, and the 22 yr old could have stayed at school til 18 and now have only just finished uni and are stuck at home with their parents again. Even is age of consent was 18 it wouldn't be illegal just to go out. If the 22 yr old really loved and respected the 16 yr old they would wait for the 16 yr old to be ready. Why should it not be ok, it's only six years difference not 20 yrs and in two more years it will be fine (if it illegal at the minute)! |`|UrrRgmDwaa	No way! A 16 year old and a 22 year old are at two different points in there life. I tried this and my friends did. It turned out bad for all of us. I ended up getting raped on a first date with an older guy. My friends just ended up getting their hearts broken and in trouble. A 22 year old thinks nothing of buying beer, staying out late, getting into a R movie, or getting into a club. A 16 year old can't do any of these things. Even though it seems like not a big deal, it becomes one. Enjoy being young. |`|ZPPLvHDaaa	Why are you asking this, when you know it's not okay? <br>  Come on seriously. It's against the law. And he/she can land in jail. It's a stupid risk, nobody should take. I suggest you getting out of this relationship immediatley before something bad happens.|`|rjVALevtaa	It's okay if you're cool with being taken advantage of. A man of that age would most likely be with you for sex and that's it. Either that or he's very immature.|`|281c3ba73135f0aba46e15ec7c1bd949aa	Technically, yes, it is okay.<br>  Not unless they are sleeping together.<br>  <br>  ***Its not illegal unless you get caught.***|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Totally fine :]<br>  <br>  And to all the others, how is it illegal?  It's not in the UK anyway!|`|BUGuJIk9aa	As it doesn't break any laws then it's completely fine.|`|WOnDm7a5aa	According to the Law, No|`|R3DY16Biaa	Oh my god, this is a case of deja vu!!<br>  I'm a 16 year old teenage girl and earlier this year, in April, I started seeing this 22 year old guy.<br>  People were like 'Eww, isn't he too old for you?' and 'Don't you think that's a bit pervy?' but I didn't care.<br>  To be honest, I didn't really like him that much at first, it was just the thrill of an older guy.<br>  After a while, like a month, I realised it wasn't going to work out because we both wanted different things from the relationship.<br>  So overall, I know from first hand experience that a 22 year old going out with a 16 year old isn't really a good idea.<br>  x|`|RBZnNmTkaa	it is ok in england and i don't see anything wrong with it to be honest they is only 6 years difference  it happens all the time. when i was 17 i went out with a 29 year old did not work out. but that was ok. it could work out for you don't listen to anyone else. as long as it is legal where you live then go for it.x |`|jjL1K9ijaa	I knew a girl who when she was in 8th grade dated a guy in the army. So your fine, depending on your parents rules I guess.|`|kbP32zIUaa	Yea its fine :) Its legal ignor every1 else!<br>  <br>  Im 16 & my limit is 19 lol but if i liked a man enough i could stretch :)<br>  <br>  If you love him.. forget all the nasty comments!<br>  <br>  x|`|SUS3IsbSaa	Well morally its wrong. But hey its legal. Each to their own, just not in my back yard.|`|0wCToA0Aaa	well i was 15 and my partner was 21,yes its illegal but 8 years on we are still together so for me it worked out well|`|1RViU68saa	legally - its fine<br>  Ethically - he should be burned.|`|Foi6PFWQaa	Not legaly.|`|eKFaUPvoaa	Of course it's ok. In the UK and the rest of europe this perfectly legal.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	If it was my 16 year old son or daughter I wouldn't like it :)|`|u37jksU0aa	No. For starters, it's illegal. |`|yUyx2nhmaa	NO!|`|sCuumWVTaa	I would do it.|`|op55FtqYaa	No its not ok. Shes barely becoming legal....jesus, he should know better |`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	no....|`|rzEK4ANmaa	i think its ok, love has no age|`|iqWRMcNvaa	Kind of weird, i'm almost eighteen and that's kind of a strech even for how old I am. This is legal in pretty much every state other than those that have the age of consent set at 17. Some states have laws only against it if the partner is over thirty, some states over twenty-five. Weird right? Those 18 and over laws are actually only in peoples imaginations, romeo and juliet laws apply to people under the age of consent and having sex with people only a few years older than them. In states where the age of consent is 16 a girl could possibley have sex with someone up to thirty.<br>  <br>  Instead of actually buying that the AOC is 18, actually realize it's not and step up to change it. In my state it is legal for someone who is freaking fourty to screw a 16-year-old girl as long as he isn't in a position of authority. So parents dont be dum realize that the law is NOT eighteen. Stop preaching the law as eighteen when it is NOT and work to freaking change it so some weirdo doesn't get away with ******* your daughter!!!<br>  <br>  I vote for a nation wide consent age of 18!!! Like everyone already thinks it is LOL. Sadly it isn't!!|`|gqqNae3Laa	Not to be sexist or anything but i think there is a greater chance of being taken advantage of if the older partner is the male.As long as he doesn't push you into anything or make you feel as though you have to do something for him after something he's done for you.Just don't fall completely head over heels in love with him until you have seen abit  more of him.Be careful. don't go to far with him, unless you are absolutely 1000% percent sure you want to.Don't get pushed into something to soon!<br>  Hope i helped!<br>  xxx<br>   |`|jLFDEJGVaa	Where do you live? Are you having sex?<br>  In the UK this is legal and it's fine. At 17 I was dating someone much older than that and we were together for 3 years.<br>  Dating is fine, but preferably make sure you're above the legal age of consent for wherever you live when sex enters the picture.|`|A1fu7mhFaa	Age doesn't matter, I don't care what people say. At 16 your old enough to know what decisions you make are okay and what ones are stupid. As long as you understand each other and your pressuring one another then your fine. Just don't listen to other people's opinions.|`|4p7UWp0Baa	yes its fine. and its not illegal. if your in the UK then if you are planning on having sex it is legal, as the legal age is 16. im 18 and im going out with a 22 year old. it would only be wrong if you were 14|`|JATqf8Zkaa	well i guess so..?<br>  i mean if you think abt it when ur 20 hes gunna b 26 so its not that bad..its kind of early though to be dating i think...but if you're both committed and serious then i guess its okay. |`|AA11479328	If u really love him.<br>  But say your 20 and he's 26 and he wants to have kids? you might still want to do things like travel the world or go to uni and u might not want to settle down yet.|`|dBXSdk5Taa	ye it's fine i believe that age doesn't matter it's just a number. i am 14 and i'm going out with a 19 year old.<br>  hope this helps good luck.|`|KP1L0sJAaa	<br>  There is quite a big age difference that is all i can say|`|mJQQtKmFaa	Not in my book!|`|ByWRzuuraa	Its fine, He's only 6 years older than you.<br>  xxxxxxx|`|sjopXIquaa	wow i was just about to ask this haha 
ByWRzuuraa	Yeah :) Rach-ELLE.<br>  xxxxxxxx|`|CMuL7XpKaa	yeah i'd use Ella and Ellie too|`|1xggHtgXaa	A nn can be whatever you want it to be, although no, Rachel does not usually have the nickname Elle.|`|GbiFRG5eaa	Technically speaking no, it would be "chel" . Saying that, you can nickname your child anything you like, If you like Elle then that is your choice, both Rachel and Elle are lovely names. |`|NbsBwYDJaa	Of course. I f you start it of young, other family or friends will pick it up and so will her friends :)<br>  Im called Laila, but my dad calls me Tallulah, and lots of people call me that too.<br>  x|`|XkBCrlEHaa	You can have any nickname. I'm Craig and was called Legs.|`|csWF95Yuaa	unusual i guess its normally short for eleanor or danielle|`|3g5EvX6baa	You can use any nickname you want.<br>  My mom's name is Yolanda and her nickname forever was Cricket.<br>  <br>  Nicknames stick when you use them all the time.  Introduce yourself, or your child, or whoever Rachel is, as Elle, and people will start to address her as such.|`|fRl0O2XYaa	Yeah <br>  Or spell it Rachelle<br>  Its well cool<br>  My Names Lucie So i get called L Or Elle My Middle Names Gabriella So Ella Or Elle again<br>  lol<br>  but it tottaly is cool for rachel<br>  go for it babes<br>  |`|KpVKfJF8aa	Yeah I guess they could. There's Rach too :D cos Elle doesn't really sound like Rachel.......but you can still use it.|`|K0dYEBUUaa	My friends dad is called Micheal but everyone calls him Jim (dont know why) so go for it!|`|hh892gJfaa	If she wanted to, or her parents or friends wanted her to|`|sMc5rrtFaa	I don't think so.Perhaps Ra Rach but Elle is different.|`|MIRQscqcaa	I guess so becoz the last letters are EL x

Dwayne is a form of the Irish name Duane, which means "little and dark/black."  Some other names that mean dark or black are:<br>  Melanie<br>  Ciara/Kiera (KEE-ar-uh)<br>  Rajani<br>  <br>  If you're willing to stretch it a little and give her a name that means "night" (since that's the time when it's dark outside), then here are a few ideas:<br>  Layla<br>  Nisha<br>  <br>  My favorites are probably Nisha, then Layla, then Ciara.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope this helps!|`|t55KZzzuaa	Really, whatever goes these days.<br>  But to be more appropriate for a little girl i would personally go with Dwaney.

wcNdpyGbaa	That is so nice of you! I have worked in day cares for two years and things I have received from parents have been those holiday bath and body works single shampoo/body wash combinations. They come in different holiday flavors. I also got a $25 gift card which I was actually surprised to get, I don't expect anything at all, let alone $25!<br>  Something we received as a group of teachers from one parent was a big tin of different Christmas cookies. Those were popular! We just left it in the classroom for all the teachers to have when they were in there. It doesn't have to be something great. Just getting anything makes us feel great!<br>  <br>  As for the gifts for all the kids. Try a cheap Christmas book gears towards their age. I found a lot at the dollar store. Maybe add some candy, a stuffed animal, etc.|`|FxXaBd16aa	Honestly, I would make cookes, bars, breads stuff like that and wrap them in that holiday baking paper. It means more to have something homemade, esp this year when everyone is short on $$$. <br>  <br>  It will mean more too, you can always make a card and have your child help. That is something they will always remember!!|`|AA11121750	we are on a tight buget this year, so for all my family members I am going to make either fudge or chocolate truffles or cookies, (havent decided yet) and put them in tins that I bought at the dollar store.  It is personal because you make it yourself, it is cheap (as long as you dont buy fancy tins), and what woman doesnt like chocolate? especially homemade stuff!  doesnt take a lot of time either.  Here is a link to some really good chocolate truffles, not only do they taste good but they are pretty easy to make<br>  <a href="http://www.kraftfoods.com/kf/recipes/easy-oreo-truffles-95085.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.kraftfoods.com/kf/recipes/eas...</a><br>  <br>  And for the kids, you could also hit up the dollar store, they have a lot of great stuff there.|`|AA11947878	Speaking as a former daycare employee I can tell you what we got that was nice and thoughtful. One year a parent brought in a gift basket full of pastry and bagels from a local shop, this was great to have in our break room. One parent stuck gift cards for a free cup of coffee at a local shop in our mailboxes, this was also great....it was the thought that counted. One year we also got movie passes.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you choose, I am sure it will be fine.|`|efMkbRCuaa	I am a daycare owner/preschool teacher. One of my fav gifts was a popcorn bowl w/ a Blockbuster gift care, 2 sodas, movie size candy and a bag of microwave popcorn!! I thought it was great!!!!<br>  I also love homemade items from my students, too!! I hang all of my ornaments my students have made me on my tree at home every year!<br>  Best of luck!|`|iLLoc003aa	Well my husband is a Branch Manager of a Bank and for Christmas we give all the girls "Christmas" candles...since some of the ladies do not celebrate the holiday...so I go to the dollar store and buy candles and they have a small plate either in gold or silver and then at Micheals I get a small wreath type thing and decorate it around the candle and on top of the plate and its a decoration they can use every holiday...as decor for their home and they love it...I have one in my home and I used burgundy candle with a gold plate and other decore to compliment my colors in my home...and it looks nice...its on my fireplace mantle|`|pWArTam4aa	That's so sweet of you!  Oh!  I myself work in a daycare and a good, from-the-heart compliment from the parents is always good for me.  I love the way I feel when they compliment me on how I'm caring for their child so well.  I love it!  Anyway, try giving them a gift certificate for a local restaurant or movie theatre.  Or perhaps a spa or nail salon, if they're into that.  As I said before, a sincere thank-you is always appreciated, especially by child-care workers.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and child-care-workers were rated as having one of the top ten germiest jobs in America.  So maybe an industrial sized bottle of Purell?  LOL... |`|0qP8gLpyaa	Get some blank canvas totes from a craft store and have your daughter put her hand prints on them to give. It will be a nice memory for them of one of the kids they cared for and useful for them to carry things in from groceries, a lunch, library books etc...<br>  <br>  You could also go to www.bronners.com and order a daycare/sitters ornament for each of them. They will ship fast and you'll have them well on time for the holiday. You can also have them personalized for free if you wish on some ornaments. <br>  <br>  The only other idea I have is maybe a nice card for each of them and a visa type loadable gift card for maybe $20 each. That way they can use it to buy whatever they want with it.<br>  <br>  Don't feel pressured to give in to elaborate gifts. It isn't necessary at all.  It's just nice from a care workers or teachers end to be acknowledged at the holidays- especially with something other than porcelin apples and lotion.<br>  <br>  |`|3F8f1SoQaa	why not have a lunch delivered for the teachers from a sub shop or pizza place or something like that? Or make them individual buckets of homemade cookies ( walmart has cheap but cute plastic tubs). I am tossing the idea around about making home-made chocolate truffles and flavored hot chocolate for the 15 teachers, aides and busdrivers I need to gift this year. <br>  <br>  as for the kids...why not a cute cello giftbag from the dollar store with gerber graduates snacks, small books from the dollar store, and maybe a few other little things.<br>  <br>  until just a few years ago I would put together a small bag for all the teachers and busdrivers for my kids. In it was  a small lotion, lip balm, nail clippers, and a handful of christmas candy.|`|Kpn4xceEaa	I'm a teacher - gift cards is the way to go - like Starbucks (15.00). Don't give lotion! Maybe your daughter could make something for them, too. That's always special.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	It is so hard buying gifts for teachers and childcare providers....I feel they must get so much stuff each year...some useful and some not.<br>  In my sons nursery school 2 of the parents took up a collection and asked for money to be put towards a gift certificate to the mall.  If everyone chipped in $23. each, each teacher would get a $75 gift certificate so they can buy what they want.  Get a card and have everyone who contributes sign it.<br>  Christmas or Holiday dish or bathroom towels are always a nice gift.<br>  Picture frame...mabe a holiday theme.<br>  For the kids, I saw board puzzles on sale...I THINK in target for 3 for $10.00.  The dollar bins in target are good also.  I bought all stocking stuffers from the dollar bin, and some gifts.  They have those watercolor books with the paint attached to the front.  Coloring book, crayons and stickers.  If the children arent much younger than your daughter. Also in target...I love Target! in the christmas section they have small toy items, 10 or more to a package.  Dollar stores are good also. May I suggest no candy...every holiday my 2 kids get so much candy at school, it is nice people want to give something but, why candy...|`|UyAGXNCsaa	First of all, I think that's SO sweet of you.  The $ amount does not matter it's the thought that counts.  I have the same dilemma with my son's teachers (he has 4 at his preschool).  My budget is very similar to yours.  I was thinking of gift certificates to a restaurant they like - something like that.  One of the teachers likes to knit, so I was going to give her a gift certificate to JoAnn Fabrics.  I'm sure anything you do will be very much appreciated.  Enjoy.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	You know.. I was thinking a really nice gift for the teachers instead of giving them something individually how about buying a big size chocolate box for them to share -on their breaks..and a really nice card saying how appreciative you are of their job. Something along those lines... or maybe a gift basket that you arrange yourself full of I dont know good coffee, chocolates, tea, cookies... etc etc things they can share at the school among them.<br>  <br>  When my oldest daughter graduated from daycare.. she'd been there for four years! Since 18 mos till age 5! We wanted to really thank the teachers for the wonderful job and we did something similar, and let me tell you they loved it! =)<br>  <br>  As for the children...you could get them maybe some nice little Xmas books... I got a couple for my daughter last year at the Dollar store! They're cute and sturdy for their little hands, it has a foamy cover with a Xmas tree and a sort story with nice pics...there's 4 in the collection so you can get them something like that and get a nice christmas wrap.. those that are a bit see thru... and you can put the book in there, along with a nice card saying Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays... and maybe a couple of age appropriate sweets?? <br>  <br>  For example for halloween some parents in my daughter's toddler class gave out some nice lil treats.. my daughter got a very yummy chocolate ghost -lolly pop with a ghost card saying happy halloween...<br>  <br>  Anyhow I hope I helped!! =D
vQWt9Dcyaa	Rosalind - 6/10. In general I don't really like the name - by that I mean the pronounciation etc - but I think there are some really cute nicknames you can have. For example Rosa, Rose, Roz, Lyn and Sally. <br>  <br>  Stella - 8/10. I really like this name, but, in a way, it sounds too grown up. However, when she's a child she could easily go by Ella, Ellie or Elle.<br>  <br>  Honor - 7/10. I love this name, but I feel that it's too "copy-cat" and (probably) too popular because of Jessica Alba. I would recommend this name as a middle thouh.<br>  <br>  Norma - 3/10. I hate this name, sorry. It's too granny-ish. I like Nora though - I think that names really pretty.<br>  <br>  Eileen - 5/10. Don't care for it. Again it's too granny-ish.<br>  <br>  Sadie - 8/10. I think this is the best out of your list for your little girl, because its a name that can grow with her as she older. Personally I like the combination Sadie Honor. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Earthy |`|o5jJVjUFaa	i like alot of the names that you picked(:<br>  hmmm here:<br>  <br>  Rosalind: i like this name, its not a favorite of mine but i <br>  do still like it. it has a catchy ring to it although i still<br>  prefer Rosaleigh or Roslina 8/10<br>  <br>  Stella: i think this name is really pretty. my cousins nickname<br>  is this and her first name is Estelle. the whole sound of <br>  the name is great & i just love it! 9/10<br>  <br>  Honor: this is the one im not sure about. im not that fond<br>  of it but thats a personal thing. id like it more as a middle name<br>  but its your choice. 5/10<br>  <br>  Norma: even though this name is old fashioned i still adore<br>  this name(: its cute & fun but can work for a child of an <br>  adult 8/10<br>  <br>  Eileen: yet, another old fashioned name. i also like this one alottt!<br>  this is actually my aunts name. and when she was growing up<br>  they called her Lainey but now as an adult she goes by Eileen.<br>  9/10<br>  <br>  Sadie: would have to be my favorite of all of these. its adorable <br>  and its really really nice. also, another catchy ring to it with this<br>  one. 10/10<br>  <br>  again, overall i like Sadie. but its your choice (;<br>  <br>  anyways, good luck on finding a name<br>  ohh & congrats|`|nvcqdyeVaa	Rosalind- Cute, you could call her (as a nickname) Rose, Rosa, Rosie <br>  Stella- Okay....but not the best<br>  Honor- Do you want your kid to be the oddball or made fun of?

RjUhISEIaa	Stacy Z is on the $$$ with her answer to you...can't believe that's twice today I've given her the kudo!<br>  <br>  One thing you said makes me wonder though about the financial future when you stated "...I doubt I need his help financially..." That is now but as you go on to say...what about the future? <br>  <br>  With this said I would highly recommend that you list him as the father on the childs birth certificate as this will help you if you do need to go after him in the future. BUT it can also backfire against you if he wants to go for visitation rights and see the child. <br>  <br>  Soundly, you would be best talking to an attorney on this issue for their legal advice. Most will offer you the initial consultation for free and just because you speak with them does not mean that you have to act on their advice. However, it gives you a complete understanding of where you stand and your rights as a parent. And what if he does come around when the baby is born? Better to know what you can/cannot do now for that time then!<br>  <br>  Oh...and tell your father you love him but that the child will not be sleeping with them! This is said "jovial" and not meant to slam your folks at all... : )<br>  <br>  The ultimate decision is yours to make but read Stacy's post again...and again...it makes sense.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	He may not want to be there but he helped create this child, it'st he least he can do.  Trust me when I say I was far more pissed when I was old enough to realize that my father had stopped paying child support when my brother decided to come live with my mom and I when I was about 10.  Needless to say, you want to feel uncared about, that's one way.  He OWES this kid that much.  <br>  <br>  In some states you can dictate how much like my ex paid $300/mo for his son even though he could afford more but of course, he actually asked his sons mother every 6 months if he needed to up his child support payments.|`|qAR26vRFaa	It's really up to you.  I would file an order, being the child is also his responsibility. He should be obligated to pay, but that's just me.  My sister was in a similar situation and has not gone after the father of her daughter for child support or anything.  She's supporting her daughter just fine and is just happy to be done with the loser.  |`|PiwaB7l6aa	I'd leave him out until he willingly comes to you to see your child. If you try to force it on him, the child could get attached and then go through all kinds of issues when he stops coming around again.<br>  <br>  Let him make the first move and don't give him any **** if it takes him a while, like years even.  You need to raise your kid with a picture of him and tell them positive things about the Dad.  Kids naturally think of themselves as half Mom half Dad until they're about 8.  If you talk bad about the Dad, they hear it and think they must be at least half bad.<br>  <br>  You can expect this road to be difficult, but at least you have your family.  Just prepare yourself for the Dad not to be around much and raise your kid to feel great about themselves anyway.  Good luck!|`|VgX63KSIaa	If I were you, I would approach the subject as a matter of principle. Many people use the system as a way to be vindictive but you don't come across that way.<br>  <br>  It's a lesson that he HAS to learn. Whether you'll receive the money or not isn't the case. It's making him accountable that matters. If he can't even form a bond with his child while he's in the womb, how is he going to be a father once the child is born? He has no connection.|`|d7fXJGWvaa	talk to him, tell him, he need to pay child support, or you will file an order and he will have to pay even more.<br>  <br>  or you can go the opposite direction and ask him to give up all rights to his son. so you will never have to worry about him again!
JPaT4BT4aa	I like Evangeline Leah. 8.5/10 Its really feminine but its very powerful and strong. Good choice!<br>  <br>  I like Adrienne Mia. 7/10 I LOVE Mia. Adrienne is lovely, but i prefer Mia.<br>  <br>  I like Shelby but not with Karen.  For Shelby, 8/10 I think its really sweet, but you must think about when your baby grows up!<br>  <br>  <br>  Shaden Bernard Nicholas I love the Nicholas and Shaden, but not keen on Bernaerd. Its lovely to honor your father though and it does suit! 8.5/10 for this one!<br>  <br>  Levi Daniel Joseph 9/10- This is my fav out of your boys names. I love Levi and Joseph and Daniel. Its so classic and well put together. Good all around!<br>  <br>  Mitchell Robert James - I only like James from this. I'm really not keen on Mitchell or Robert, but i think its nice your honoring your family! 5/10 because i love James. <br>  <br>  Dustin Michael Anthony - I like Michael. The others i'm not too sure about! Dustin is ok, but not one i would pick! 4/10, (only beacuse i like Michael) Sorry x<br>  <br>  In the end honey, they are you and your partners kids, so you choose what you want. I hope i helped! x|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Evangeline Leah Cristina: Im not too keen on Evangeline. I prefer Eva on its own. Leah is not a name I'm fond of either. Don't know why its just a name I've never liked. Cristina is ok, puts me in mind of Christina Aguilera.<br>  <br>  Caroline Angela Patricia: If I'm being honest I would choose Cara/Kara over Caroline anyday. Angela is ok but Patricia is so old-fashioned.<br>  <br>  Shelby Karen Ann: Shelby is unique. Karen is quite common, same with Ann but if its after your mom then I think its great to honor her. I just don't get why you would use Bee as a nickname for Shelby though. Shelby is pronounced (Shell-Bay) therefore there is no Bee in it. Personally I think you should nickname her Shell or just call her by her whole name.<br>  <br>  Adrienne Mia Catherine: Adrienne is too masculine for my liking. Mia is cute, I like it as a nickname for Amelia. Catherine I love too but I prefer the spelling Katherine as the C looks old-fashioned to me.<br>  <br>  Mitchell Robert James: I absolutely love the name Mitchell. Its super cute! Robert Im not so keen on. James is a nice middle name<br>  <br>  Levi Daniel Joseph: I've only ever met one Levi and she was a girl. Therefore the name is feminine to me. I like Daniel and Joseph is a bit, I don't know.<br>  <br>  Dustin Michael Anthony: I prefer Austin to Dustin. Michael is nice and I don't like Anthony<br>  <br>  |`|EXBMxFCKaa	If you're going for fluidity, meaning they actually sound right when you say them out loud, the only name that works is Adrienne Mia Catherine. I can understand wanting to honor family members but the names get long, drawn out, and lose their ability to speak well when you add so many syllables. <br>  <br>  Evangeline Leah Christina: Two names that end in the same sound don't flow. Love Christine as a middle name both Evangeline and Leah as first names but they don't work together. <br>  <br>  Caroline Angela Patricia: Again, two names that end in the same sound don't work. There are too many syllables in this name.<br>  <br>  Shelby Karen Ann: Love the spelling of Karen you've used, don't think Shelby is all that great and Karen Ann is a little redundant.<br>  <br>  Adrienne Mia Catherine: Not the best fluidity but cute.<br>  <br>  Mitchel Robert James: Three nice names with Mitchel as the ideal first name but together it's too long and has too many syllables that don't compliment each other.<br>  <br>  Levi Daniel Joseph: Like all of the names in the same places, Levi as a first name Daniel and Joseph fit more as middle names but the fluidity isn't the best<br>  <br>  Shaden Bernard Nicholas: I don't like any of the names separately, together they're just more of a mouthfull. <br>  <br>  Dustin Michael Anthony: Dustin Anthony works, Michael not so much.<br>  <br>  Try:<br>  <br>  Leah Karen Christine<br>  Evangeline Patricia Karen<br>  Shelby Angela Catherine <br>  <br>  Levi Robert Joseph<br>  Shaden Daniel James<br>  Dustin Anthony Michael (Though it'd sound best w/o Michael)|`|q82cqg3raa	I love the stories behind these names!

ZpnSka8Baa	Love the first two!<br>  <br>  I'd probably go with Imogen Anne, because I'm not a huge 'Lee' fan.|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I actually really like Kaydie, I've never heard of it before but I think it's absolutely adorable.  Instead of choosing Lee/ or Anne why not LeeAnne?  -- usually spelt differently but if that's how you like each of the names spelt, go with that.  My daughters' middle name is LeighAnn; spelt after 2 different relatives, each spelt exactly that way.  If only choosing one middle name I prefer Kaydie Anne.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Georgia Lee|`|8DF64P7Gaa	i like, Georgina Leigh, Imogene (Idgie) Anne and i dont like Kaydie... is it pronounsed like Katie? eh not a fan. i like Georgina Leigh and Idgie Anne though.|`|UJaCObdyaa	1st choice - Imogen Anne<br>  2nd choice - Georgia Lee<br>  3rd choice - Kaydie Anne|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love Georgia Lee - it flows really nicely and is very pretty!!|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	Kaydie Anne|`|FFbWgs0Xaa	I really like Georgia Lee.

Goos luck with choosing a name, CONGRATTS!!|`|WF1YqNzhaa	Kaydie Lee.<br>  <br>  Georgia sounds kind of country-ish, Imogen is ok... but doesn't go with Anne, and Kaydie Anne sounds more common than Kaydie Lee.

eDjhI8hkaa	I always make my daughter's food.  I just buy frozen organic veggies and steam them in a basket over boiling water. This helps them to retain their nutrients.  It is much cheaper to make my own, the only reason I've bought jars of baby food is when I had to travel on a plane with my daughter.|`|8zXiqIK0aa	steam the veg, it holds more nutreients that way, if you over cook vegetables they loose alot of the good stuff!. such as the vitimin content. i made my own baby food as i woudnt eat those horrible little jars so why should i make my baby eat thm. they are disgusting. they have additives and preservatives ect in thm, which id rather not fill my child with. they also lack the high amount of nutrients you get in real veg. i never fed my baby anything that i wouldnt eat myself. it also makes the change to familt mealsalot easier if youve made it yourself as the flavours and textures are more real.|`|AA11947878	I made some of my own as well as bought jars. Yes, you cook the veggies first to make them mushy enough for the baby and then I used a food processor. I ended up with jarred food because my little man really didn't go to much for the texture of the homemade. He didn't mind sweet potatoes that I made, I was able to get them pretty smooth. I also mixed in his formula with it and sometimes his baby cereal too. <br>  <br>  |`|DimBfcOnaa	I make all of my baby's food. I used veggies right out of the garden. I do cook them first then I run them through a puree and freeze in ice cube trays. After frozen I put in a freezer bag and stick it in the deep freezer.<br>  <br>  I make his food because mostly it is healthier for him but it is also MUCH cheaper. 2 butter nut squash makes him a 4-5 week supply. |`|BcjFssaEaa	boil or steam the veg first n then blend it n add it to 1 part baby rice, 10 parts baby milk.<br>  <br>  try 1 veg every day for like 3-4 days then try another.<br>  sweet potato is suposed to be good, carrot, brocolli, <br>  u can do the same with fruit, apple pear u dont have to cook bananas tho.<br>  <br>  best of luk xx|`|FQrl1Azbaa	steam the veggies until they are soft. this way, they keep their nutrients. <br>  <br>  if you boil them for hours.... they will be a soggy mush with no nutrition left. <br>  <br>  the jars are great for if you are out somewhere and don't have anything else.

mgm5YYOeaa	pues pueden ser por muchos factores, tal ves le esta saliendo pokita leche a la tetina o demasiada.. o por lo mismo ke komentas de los dientitos estan tan sensibles sus encias ke por eso la evita, yo te recomiendo ke le pongas una pomadita en sus dientesitos hay una ke yo le pongo a mi baby ke se llama kanka baby y es de sabor uva y esta hace ke se le pase la molestia, ya ke adormece la zona.. dale mordederas para ke alivie su comezon.. y respecto a la mamila puedes endulzarle la leche y seguro kerra tomarsela..  solo konke pongas unas gotitas de miel bastaran... y no le ara da?o, al igual puedes hacerle kon el agua natural agregale un par de gotitas de miel y listo! esperemos eso ayude! suerte!! |`|fd5d8dbacf41675ff7ac842e43bd47ffaa	bueno quizas tiene como asco, pero vuelve a tratar y deverias de darle algo para la comezon de sus dientes aveces se ponen muy inquietos y chilloncitos tambien revisa la temperatura en la que se la das, o en caso extremo llevalo al doctor y consultale eso, mimalo y como si fuera un  recien nacido acomodatelo y dale tu misma la mamila, revisa si tiene  buen fujo el chupon, suerte |`|yPMHEyWkaa	Pues seguir dándole la leche con cuchara. A algunos ni?os cuando les salen los dientes reullen de los chupetes y tetinas. No te lo tomes como algo malo, las tetinas pueden deformar el paladar y la dentición de los bebes si se abusa de ellos y hay muchos padres desesperados por que no le pueden quitar el bibe a sus bebes. Tu bebe se está haciendo grande|`|3sInkh3kaa	creo que pueden comprarle un vasito entrenador ya que estos tambien hay unos con una valvula antiderrames que no se tirara la leche es bueno si no quiere tomar en tetera o biberon pero creo que lo importante es que el bebe tome su leche como debe de ser y no con que lo haga , un consejo comprale unos vasitos o uno que tenga  monitos agradables a el le gustara .. suerte espero que les sirva mi consejo.. bye.
b73bda331fdfa778ce67f7c1e95159e5aa	Not true.  Conception might be less likely, but it's still possible.|`|stRWElvPaa	no they can conceive, but if the periods are irregular due to a hormonal imbalance like pcos, then it's less likely, and also, if the ovulation is very late then the egg might not be such good quality.<br>    but, whenever there is an ovulation there is a chance to get pregnant, so on the whole, the statement is false.x|`|AA11222790	You can conceive, it is a little harder to figure out when you ovulate though.  If you have irregular periods you should get a ovulation kit.|`|1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	Not true.. Best way to conceieve if you have irregular periods is to take your temperture every morning and track bbt. This way you know exactly when you ovulate.|`|zTaSPXRjaa	no, its not true- its just that the woman may not be able to trace her cycle well. its just makes it a bit hard to conceive- but irregular periods does not mean that a woman cant conceive.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	You can conceive but it may take some time to figure out when you ovulate.  Try an ovulation kit so you know when your most fertile days are.  Good luck!|`|l5iL1p8Yaa	No that is not true. So, if this is you don't worry! <br>  <br>  If you have an irregular period that just means that you ovulate at a slightly different time each month. The coupld of days before and the day of ovulation are the best days to have sex if you want to conceive. <br>  <br>  I would siggest that you go out and get a ClearBlue Fertility Monitor, which will test the hormones in your urine and tell you when you are about to ovulate. That will help you pinpoint the time of ovulation and increase your chance of conceiving more quickly. Good Luck!|`|dab391535c3cca2e58914658b7393ff0aa	nope, my periods were irregular and i got pregnant w/ out any medical involvement.  I know a lot of women do have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) which can make it harder to conceive but even women w/ that can get pregnant w/ or w/ out medical help.|`|ILzp6Tniaa	No, but women who have PCOS usually have irregular periods and they are often unable to conceive.|`|fe446779837164e5f54b78b5881dd1b5aa	not true, but it can be more challenging to determine when you are most fertile or ovulating.|`|tht0DrHsaa	No it is not true.

That's like playing roulette with a six shooter with six rounds loaded. Hopefully one of the rounds is a blank!<br>  <br>  Maybe it's time to take the time to learn before taking an action and then asking here on this forum. Good that you used a condom to lesson the chance of pregnancy occurring but they're not 100% safe either.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself this question...are you ready to have a child and if you get pregnant would your b/f be willing to marry you? If the answer to either is a "no" then learn to abstain. It's that simple.|`|ErCJnABBaa	What you are describing is the calendar method of birth control.  Many a woman has gotten pregnant using that method of birth control.<br>  <br>  If you have sex several days after you ovulate, then it's basically impossible to get pregnant.  But I get the feeling that you have NOT been tracking your fertility with FAM (BBT, CM, & CP).  Therefore you do not know when you ovulated this month.  Because there are lots of things that can cause a woman to ovulate late, there is alwasy the possiblility that you THINK you are a few days away from starting your period, when in fact you might have just ovulated and therefore just had sex at your most fertile time of your cycle.<br>  <br>  If you are not actively tracking your fertility, there is no way to know, so you most asuradly might be pregnant.|`|MgvYMfIWaa	it just depends on when you ovulate.you can get pregnant anytime of the month even on your period. but since you used a condom i doubt it if it didnt break or have a hole.|`|eMQrNqgAaa	you can get pregnant at any time its just sometimes you have a higher chance. |`|lqV2FcZZaa	Rule of thumb: Pregnancy is ALWAYS possible.
