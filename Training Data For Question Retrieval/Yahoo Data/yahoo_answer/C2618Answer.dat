Very common (but not recommended) practice in the industry. The credit crunch is causing lenders to take a long, hard look at each deal that comes through their desks.<br>  <br>  Long story short, until the bank signs off on the loan, the car belongs to the dealer until that occurs. If they cannot get the financing worked out, take the car back.<br>  <br>  Doesn't matter what you did at the DMV (odd, usually the dealer would do that for you... what state are you in?). You don't "own" a vehicle that you're making payments on, the bank does. <br>  <br>  **Side note - The BBB is not some legal strongarm organization. If you lodge a complaint with them, they will deliver it to the dealer. The dealer will have a chance to respond to it, and no matter what their response is (from "we took the car back and refunded the money" to "we told the buyer to go fly a kite"), the dealer's response will mark the complaint as "satisfied" in the BBB's eyes. The BBB's dealings in the matter end there. They do not represent consumers in any legal fashion. I know dealers/businesses with hundreds of complaints lodged against them, but they are still able to keep their BBB membership because they pay their yearly dues.<br>  <br>  Contact a lawyer? For what? It's not the dealer that's the problem, it's the lender. Until their requirements are met, the car still belongs to the dealer. The dealer would love to get the car sold and "on the books". No need to get a lawyer to prey upon the dealer.<br>  <br>  EDIT** --- Folks, if she is financing the vehicle, she will not have the title. The title will not come into play in this situation.

It took me a long time before I thought I was ready for a GSX-R1000. If you are a new rider, the Suzuki SV650SF is a great learning tool that you would never really need to outgrow. <br>  <br>  It isn't like a big I4 sport bike is going to explode the second a new rider gets on it. In fact, they are fairly tame if you shift before about 6,000 RPM. Several have the ability to electronically limit power too. <br>  <br>  The main problem is that a new rider just doesn't have the skills needed to use any of the upper range of the bikes performance. By the time you realize you are in over your head, it may be too late and you are going to be hurt or dead.<br>  <br>  Riding is one of my favorite things to do, but it's way more fun if you get into the sport right and learn the basic skills.

I will be twenty in April so I can give you advice. Owning a car and making payments, maintaining it, paying for gas, paying for insurance, taxes, etc... is EXPENSIVE as sin. Are your parents in a position where they could maybe loan you money instead of you getting into this mess by yourself and going through a legit loan company? I am not doubting your work ethic or income or anything, but unexpected stuff happens at our age and if you can't make payments the credit people are after you and before you know it you have the credit score of a lawn gnome. Which means you are effed for a very long time. I just bought my second car in December. I worked it out with my parents for them to give me a loan. We sat down and worked out a payment plan and they are making interest off of me just like a bank would. While it wouldn't go over too well if I missed a payment, they are probably more forgiving than a bank would be. It's up to you, but it sounds very risky to me at your age to get a car loan.

My insurance is still in the neighborhood of $3000 a year. <br>  <br>  Based on my own case, I don't think that any 16 year old will be able to get insurance on a Mustang for anywhere close to $1500 a year. The insurance companies look at a young male driving a sports car, and see a huge potential for accidents. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do, though, is have your dad call his insurance agent and get an actual quote, rather than relying on what some random guy on the internet tells you.|`|kvGHnEHjaa	wish i had your dad when i was 16, i had an '87 ranger and paid $1500 a year. try calling your local independent insurance agent, they can shop many insurance companies and find you the best rate. remember not to skimp on coverages for a better rate, if something terrible happens it's always better to be overinsured for a few extra bucks now than underinsured and paying on a settlement for the rest of your life.|`|klYZR2lPaa	Like in your situation,I would like to advise you have a look here <a href="http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insuran...</a>

f41f07330effd00e202635eab4dc96b5aa	Wait... you were "told" it runs. Right? How in the hell did the seller walk away with your money without you actually seeing/hearing/riding this bike??? You have no clue doesn't begin to describe your problem. First things first: have the guy hurry back and tell him to not forget to bring your money, or carry this bike back over to his place and go up his butt until you find your money. If you are going to keep the bike, I assume you are talking about a XS850?(or some variation thereof) -with the timing chain on one end of the three cylinder bank? OK, Why are you using the kick-starter?  For the (backup) kickstarter to be successful the timing mark should be 180 degrees out. (#1 cylinder on the bottom of the exhaust stroke) That makes the other cyls. make power to "bump it off". If the electric starter is not working start there: Get your meter out and start ohming out everything, especially the coil(s). DO NOT try to push start this bike: you will tear up the shaft drive. If it has been jump started off a car there's a good chance the fuseable link is fried. Check all the circuits, the fuel delivery, ignition everything. -good luck,..you need it.
Gn0nR2S1aa	Based on not knowing what type of vehicle... the MAF sensor usually fails electronically in it's signal so the car can still run.

54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	No it will not "Ruin" the engine. However it will cause you to cus and throw tools across the shop when you try to get it running again. Is the gas still there? Probably not, or not all of it. What you have is mostly condensate(Water) and the sludge left over from the fuel vaporizing off at low temperature. What to look for? 1: Pull the carb. Either have it rebuilt or replaced.2: Pull the intake manifold, Clean it thoroughly.3: While you are doing these 2 things, Pull the spark plugs and examine them for rust or corrosion.4: Replace them.( you are not looking to see if the plugs are bad. You are trying to determine if the inner cylinders have contaminates in them.) If there is a small amount of rust or corrosion then 5:with great care apply about a 1/8 ounce of motor oil to the plug holes. About an eye droppers worth.6: Pull the plug. Drain the oil. Change the filter. Put in new oil. ( the eye droppers worth of oil in the top of the pistons is to help contaminates break free and flow out the exhaust as you fire the engine for the first time, also it gives your rings a little head start so they are not completely dry when you turn the motor over for the first time.) 7: With a Small pry bar and with gentle firm pressure turn the motor over by hand for at least one 360 deg. rotation.( This will establish whether the engine is still capable of turning over on its own. It may be hard to get it to move the first time. Just be patient with it and once you get it to move it should get easier.Very important note: Be gentle otherwise you may damage the teeth on your flywheel)from here it is the hookup and starting process I will leave to you. Things to look for: You will have some condensation in the oil pan. Just be thorough and clean it out.Run your fingers gently trough the oil as it drains to look for metal shavings or broken pieces. My last advise for this venture is don't sink a bunch of money into it. Use new but dirt cheap oil, and new but dirt cheap filters. The only place you might sink a little money is in the carb. You need a good carb to run the engine. Anything else is a waist of time and money. Don't buy new belts and hoses unless you just have to. That is an investment for after its running.|`|2349afcbac4c3a4a0dce26e0d170e44faa	Don't  even start it. Have it drained and the fuel lines cleaned and carberator rebuilt preferably by a professional. If you must start it at least remove the spark plugs and crank the engine for a minute to get the oil pump primed and moving oil. Old gasoline turns into a gummy stinking varnish and gas only has a shelf life of 30 to 60 days before it starts to go bad. Adding fresh fuel to old fuel at this point is taking chances. It will probably start but performance will be poor. Cold starting any engine is equivalant to 500 miles of wear. An engine that has sat for a year then cranked? I can only imagine the damage to try and start it without taking steps to minimize trouble.|`|oHc3S74baa	top off the tank with fresh gas, and drive carefully until you need to fill up next. ie: don't rev too hard or lug the motor at low rpm. Change the fuel filter at next service too - as it probably will have a bit of sediment built up.|`|AoNBI840aa	Drain the old gas, it just won't work. Also, change the oil and make sure it's tuned up before starting it.|`|AA10241412	Drain the old gas out and run a can of Sea Foam gas additive in with the new gas ,,, old gas can "gum" up and cause a world of headaches making the carburetor stick and plug up , Time line ?

knSyGZBoaa	Goodyear is an excellent brand for tires. I currently have Hankook tires on my 2008 Scion xB and they perform very well for me, considering I'm not grabbing for monster speeds on the highway.<br>  <br>  You need to look at the trim of the tire, rather, the rating.<br>  <br>  Z tires give you the most performance. Those are the ones you want, but they're very expensive.<br>  <br>  R tires are the most common ones. You can find them on most sedans, midsize, coupes, cross-overs, etc.<br>  <br>  Your car has a sport trim, so you're most likely going to have to get a tire with a better rating than R. They'll work, but they won't work as well if you want longevity out of your tire.<br>  <br>  As long as you don't drive like an over-caffeinated deranged soccer mom, then you should be fine with Hankook R-type tires.|`|dZmR9W6maa	the hankook tires are good.|`|LJv3pgeCaa	Hankook and Defintiy are garbage...

7YE2arJWaa	Ahh..  I see the asker saw the same National Geographic program on scrapping and salvaging railroad locomotives that I saw tonight.  :-)<br>  <br>  The reason why that SD40's diesel engine is worth that much is because those General Motors 645-series diesel engines are not exactly plentiful in supply.  If someone wants to rebuild a locomotive with a 645 engine they can't just order a new one from GM, because they don't make them anymore.  You'd have to get a reconditioned one, which makes those used engines valuable commodities (especially the ones that are still in good shape).|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	For one thing mileage is completely irrelevant as its use is measured in hours. In fact that huge engine is actually a large diesel generator that makes electricity, the locomotive is actually propelled by big electric motors. With proper maintenance that engine is good for another 40 years.|`|E70A7aqcaa	As one who worked for BNSF and Norfolk Southern Railroads as a freight train conductor, I can tell you that even the old engines are awesome powerhouses.  But, that having been recognized, I'm not likely to trust that your "data" in your question is accurate since you don't know EXACTLY what was sold in the deal, and you don't know the condition of the engine, or the number of miles or hours it has on it, and what that engine was used for, such as in the yard work or over the road work, nor what terrain and size of trains it had to pull and what assistance power it had in doing so.  All that having been recognized, I doubt you're familiar with the power and longevity of a diesel engine, especially one built for a railroad locomotive, and so to try to explain to you the incredible power these things have, and how long they can last and what all is involved in "tearing" one down and rebuilding it is too big an undertaking for here on Answers.  I can say that even though I already owned a VW Rabbit Diesel when I went to work for those two railroads, after working with those locomotives over the road and in the yard, I came to the extremely easy  decision that any car or truck I drove was going to be diesel powered, or I wouldn't own it.  And you ought to see the new VW Jetta TDI (turbo diesel) I drive, and the one I bought my son, and the nice big diesel pickup truck I own.  It may cost a bit more, but, as that L'Oreal commercial says, I'M WORTH IT!!  You need to go to work for a railroad.  You'll REALLY get your question answered.  God Bless you.|`|0CkFC43raa	partly because few were made in the first place. also they likely sold the generator along with the engine. these engines were built to last for a long long time, and 2 million miles means it might have been rebuilt once, and has at least two more left in the engine, unless they are built like the diesels you find in 18 wheelers, then you can rebuild as many times as you need to, and as long as the crank shaft remains servicable.

JKQhSGEEaa	well i will compare both my dodge engines. gasser is a 5.9 v8 average 15mpg. my diesel is a 5.9 l6 average about 22-23mpg. my diesel is great for towing i was getting around 22-23 now that i added a lift(6 in and 35in tires) and engine mods i get around 17-18. gas is nice in winter time because it doesnt have to be plugged in but it take a little bit to warm up once started. my diesel in the winter time has to be plugged in if its not in the garage but it starts easily and warms up quicker. gas uses spark to ignite fuel. diesel compress the air/fuel in the cylinder and when it is compressed the air heats up to a high temp and that very hot air ignites the fuel. if you ever drive a diesel you will never go back to gas. i only did because i needed a small work truck and dakotas dont come in diesels so i got the 5.9 v8. I love it in the winter time around 6:30 when i go start my diesel i can smell that great diesel smell. before i added my lift i could beat my friends v8 mustang(some engine mods) and i even beat my dads friends corvette(stock). imo diesels are better all around they last longer more reliable and they can easily see 200,000miles|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Gas is faster and more fun to drive and sounds better.<br>  <br>  Diesel can tow more weight, is more reliable, and gets an average of 10 to 15MPG better than gas engines.<br>  <br>  Diesel is more expensive, but you still save more money with Diesel because of the gas mileage.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Diesel is better thermodynamically.

That way you know for sure!|`|T68C67Usaa	Yes in most states the bill of sale will be enough, if you are in the same state. they will do the title transfer only if the car show that the lein has been settled..if the car still show a lein they wont title the car for you till the lein shows up paid in full.|`|tCpJPjHQaa	You could, but you need to go to the DMV with the seller and have him sign a form called "duplicate of title". but then again thats California DMV. I dont know what state you are in, but I'm sure if you contact the DMV they'll let you know if they have that form or not.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	you dont need the title just the bill of sale.<br>  <br>  if you finance it the bank will want it before they hand over their money.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	A Bill of Sale is NOT proof of ownership. A title is the ONLY proof of ownership of an automobile. Someone who steals a car and sells it can write a Bill of Sale, but it doesn't mean he owns the car or has the right to sell the car.<br>  <br>  I suggest you contact the seller's bank or loan company to find out it the title is REALLY being sent to him. It's possible he didn't use your money to pay off his loan, but took a vacation to Mexico. It's NEVER a good idea to take a promise to get a car title later. You should have gone with him to his bank or loan company and writtten your check to them, and let them know that you are to receive the title.
4HoVVCenaa	Yes, but you can't license it until the title comes or you get a new title from the DMV. I've bought vehicles without titles before. To get a new title, you have to get a VIN inspection by state agency and post a bond on the value, which you don't get back, and then they will issue a title. DMV can tell you what you need to know... if you can get them to answer the phone.|`|YujjEUjEaa	not legally. you need the title|`|AA11156853	Maybe you can rent it from him for a month on the cheap.

f3b4a3eea25a5783bbde8265b9451986aa	As some have stated already, you can do 40mph in a curve, but is it safe for all vehicles or weather conditions?  Probably not.  Many curve speed limit signs were designed for semis, since they have a higher center of gravity.  If the semi takes a curve too fast, the load can shift causing a rollover.  <br>  <br>  Under dry road conditions, a truck driver will get into a 20mph curve at 15mph & gradually speed up &/or maintain speed to keep the trailer behind the tractor.

Watch how much you plan to go over a speed limit. Anyway as to signs I go about the recommended speed, that's all the yellow means. The idea in a lot of cases is Semi traffic as well. Anymore I'd consider SUVs as well, since they have a higher center of gravity(hence more prone to rollover).|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I'm always able to go 10-15 miles faster then the speed on those yellow signs without a problem. Only me would drive 70 mph on an interstate off ramp (as long it's not a sharp curve) even through the yellow sign signs 45.<br>  <br>  One time I was on a road with a posted speed limit of 30 mph and I approached a curve with a yellow sign that said 40 or 45 mph, I thought that was odd. Basically, the speed on the yellow signs are based on engineering studies of the road to determine a safe speed. It's just a suggesting that is way outdated I think because those signs were put up before power steering and cars are now better equipped to go around curves faster. <br>  <br>  The speed limit on the white signs are political figures set by the state, county, or city and are not based on engineering studies of a safe driving speed. Normally under dry conditions, it's safe to drive 15 miles over the speed limit.
dWLgwb3baa	The bag is a temporary holding place for the oxygen.  The oxygen in airliners is chemically generated.  When you pull the mask toward you, you are actually pulling a pin to start the chemical reaction.<br>  <br>  You don't need oxygen when you are exhaling, but the oxygen is still being generated.  Instead of wasting the oxygen, it is stored in the bag.  The warning that the bag may not inflate is so you don't take off the mask thinking it's not working if the bag is not puffed up full.  When you first put the mask on, it probably won't inflate at all.|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	Same reason a person who is hyperventilating breathes into a bag.  When you're in a plane going down, odds are you'll be breathing a little fast!  <br>  <br>  Hyperventilating = all carbon dioxide goes out, your blood chemistry changes and you need more CO2 in your blood.  If part of what you're breathing back in came from what you breathed out, you'll be replacing that CO2 as well as the oxygen coming through the ventilation system.

TdrgZwnoaa	I once saw a 1967 Chevy Sedan that someone had painted with exterior paint using a 4" brush. It wasn't a pretty sight but the owner was quite proud of tha fact that he had done it himself for less than $ 35.00 not including cleanup. My guess is that he had no idea what masking tape was for as he had even painted the trim.<br>   The car was painted in the ever popular 'forest green'.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	I would go with a tremclad rust paint instead, I used to have a 76 chevy truck and used it for off roading, It's easy to touch up as well if you rub up against a tree or rock.  I have seen paint jobs done with house paint but they really look bad because of the brush marks, if you can spray it it may be okay.|`|JWf1IIpZaa	if i were you i wouldn't use any kind of house paint, it wouldn't look right.

HFrsH9MRaa	You may not even need a total rebuild. Remember that when this car was released, there was ONLY leaded gas. There are modifications that should be made to the valve guides and seats to reflect these changes. This involves the removal of the cylinder head, and appro-priate alterations made. I wish I was there to oversee this project. I know these engines and carbs very well. You might even think about updating your ignition to a point-less high output distributor. You can even find high output cams, manifold, and carburetors. They are available from Ford itself, as well as aftermarket car shops.

Just run the shoulder and lap belt through the back of the child seat and buckle it.  There are shoulder and lap belts in the second row of the Expedition.  After the belts are buckled, pull the belts out as far as they will go, you should hear a ratcheting sound as they are are being fed back in, when you have then returned as tight as they will go, the belt should be locked.  This is the child seat feature, it must be pulled out all of the way and then let back in to where you want it to lock. Once you get the belt snug, it will be locked into place.|`|4604991602004ad27d5b575e0446cfe7aa	If your installing forward, and not rearward, just put them on the sides-problem solved..  The lap belt will go through either way!!  If you want to put them in the center location, you better have a 3rd row seat.

1ce0b31352ddac4983f71b8fd4ae3b56aa	It isn't all that uncommon for a truck to have different tires on the front and the back.  <br>  <br>  About the only major concern with putting larger tires on the back is you will reduce your effective caster angle.  This will make the truck a little less stable.  <br>  <br>  It seems to me a Dodge 2500 has about 3.5 degrees of caster.  If you increase your frame angle more than about 1.5 degrees you'll notice the truck will wander pretty significantly.  <br>  <br>  Oversteer is more of a function of weight, if that's what you're worried about.  You truck will still plough like a pig (understeer).  It will actually help to have the larger tires if you tend to load it aft.|`|sz7mLOLoaa	hi.. i really havent seen or know anyone do this kind of mismatch. how fast will you drive this thing? i think in the long run, something will wear out and give cause the the front will turn faster than the rear, and the meeting point of the two is in the transfer case.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	sounds kinda dumb and dangerous.  go to the tire store and get a matching set.|`|qjtzjC7Vaa	Sure, as long as you dont put it in four wheel drive, like you said.

cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	go to the parts store and get regular starter shims, it's a 1 piece deal that goes under both bolts and all it does is moves the starter down some fron the flywheel, it doesn't take much of a shim to cure the problem, the parts store will know what you need when you tell them the problem.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	you can shim it til the cows come home that will change absolutely nothing. on a gm a shim is used to adjust starter position in relation to the stater this is done to create a set amount of clearance between the ring gear and pinion gear on the starter to minimize noise. if your starter is hanging up in a ford, i would replace the stater.|`|i5lk5eN2aa	The problem is in the solenoid which is mounted above the starter. That solenoid not only energizes the starter motor but it also actuates a spring loaded plunger which pulls a bellcrank-like engaging lever back which in turn pushes the starter drive gear out to engage the flywheel ring gear. If that plunger spring weakens it will not immediately push the plunger back to disengage the starter drive gear. Replace the starter.|`|AA12208565	If you shim one side, you'll end up with a cracked nose cone.  That equals a bad idea.  If you have to shim it, do it equally, and try to get a proper starter shim.  No washers.  Also, you could take it to the parts store and have them check it.  If it sticks off of the vehicle, it's got nothing to do with shimming.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	I think you take it in and have it tested and replaced if needed.Many parts stores will test it for you.|`|4BAJoTZhaa	i would try a shim, just a washer at a time till it stops.

Let's put it like this;  If the work performed to your vehicle was related to the battery or alternator in any way, check the wiring.  Check your connections at the battery.  Scratch that.  Jump the car, drive to the parts store, and have them test the battery and alternator.  Then, go from there.|`|KrZhJwqraa	Buy some distilled water and top up the battery if that fails then replace battery, you can always buy an alternator.|`|FqMiuklxaa	Try installing a new altenator depends on the vehicle it's usually cheap (under 100 bucks) and easy to change.|`|a800672b2a7729d25905e4dad9353b0faa	It sounds like your altanator
crhJLuw5aa	The problem you describe definitely DOES sound like the timing is off. The question is: Is it ignition timing, or is it valve timing? As has been previously stated, the ignition timing doesn't normally have to be touched when the timing belt is changed; but that doesn't necessarily mean that the mechanic DIDN'T mess with it for one reason or another.<br>  <br>  You should take it back to the shop and give them a chance to make it right. It's a simple matter to put a timing light on it & check the ignition timing. <br>  <br>  If it's not ignition timing, then it has to be valve timing, which can only mean one thing: The belt was installed incorrectly. Either way, ANY shop owner worth his salt will admit the mistake & fix it for free.<br>  <br>  And yes, installing the belt one or more teeth off WILL make it stutter on the start and/or have a rough idle.|`|AA12208565	You just tightened up a lot of things that were used to being worn out.  The possibility does exist that they installed the belt a tooth off, but you may also be noticing things that you were not able to before, even though the problem existed.  You may need to get the valves adjusted.|`|sz7mLOLoaa	hi..how far apart was the job done and the problem start? months after or the next day after the work was done? if months or weeks later, it is unrelated to the timing belt replacement... is the check engine light on?  take it back to the shop and ask them what is wrong with it. good luck|`|gGBPPjLeaa	The above is correct, it does not need to be adjusted unless off. The belt sometimes has a direction or rotation marked on it, otherwise line up the timing marks as indicated and isstall the new belt with correct tension. They should not have played with timing unless someone screwed around in the pass with the electronic advance or vacuum advance, then this might need to be recalibrated with a timing light.|`|7fbZCmfXaa	You don't have to adjust the timing unless it was changed.<br>  <br>  It is possible that the belt was installed incorrectly; the belt is toothed, and it may have accidentally been installed off by a tooth.

b637df4c5d99edf4bd75147b1fdb49d3aa	Almost all the Highlanders that we rent out have AWD, which is on all the time and is automatically controlled by the vehicle.  It's not the best in the world compared to other four wheel drive vehicles, because the Highlander is really a crossover vehicle with a transversely mounted motor, which is usually typical in front wheel drive vehicles.  But it will give you more traction than your basic two wheel drive.<br>  <br>  If you are going to do some serious offroading and need something more durable, try swapping it out for something like the Kia Sorrento, Toyota 4Runner 4WD, Jeep Cherokee 4WD, or Chevy Trailblazer 4WD.  We consider these as the same size as the Highlander, and all of those are sturdy truck-based vehicles.

You can try having the engine mounts loosened and readjusted, but as I have seen in the past, including my own vehicle, it made little difference in the vibration, it is a vehicle characteristic and will not improve much, the ZX2 was not the only one, the Contour and Mystique also had the same vibration.

You can email me for more information, or do some research on doing it yourself w/ HPTuners or EFILive.|`|tBq6ZDZvaa	try 3800 V6.com they only deal with all generations of the Buick 3800 Series V6 engines.|`|ksSAPbMaaa	(chips) in General where desingned by AM General to replace the ecm in the old military trucks back in  the 90's  (chips) there are different types there's the plug and play which downloads new settings to your module in the computer built in your vehicle, mainly there only good in trucks, diesel and some gas. in my educated opinion i would go fro a newer replacement  <br>  ecu ( electronic control unit) and along with a module thus taking off the speed limiter, maximizing your engines HP potential and your torque as well, increased fuel mileage and improved timing on the plugs.you can use [Pretty much any module for your vehicle. there's no specific one you need. but its up to your standards each mod does a different thing. there's racing ones hauling, gas guzzling cures, everything, i own a 95 6.5 liter diesel i replaced the factory modul with a kelsey hayes. full replacement in 05 i gained 80HP and 120 pounds of torque, i now get 29 MPG and i put new diesel trucks to shame with the power of mine, the (chips) would not be a good idea for you, i highly suggest a module Replacement, and also some headers(exhaust manifolds) and electric fans, new fuel pumps and new spark plugs, if your doing all that then you Maxwell get all new gaskets as well. so good luck i hope you find what your looking for and FYI  i customize vehicles in the family shop all the time T's custom trucks. and i have been a mechanic since i was 20 13 years experience doesn't sound like much but i have been around engines since i was 3. good luck
5C7wKDcRaa	Bus fares are based on distance, not time.<br>  <br>   Train will be faster than bus in most instances.|`|6Gfz125Paa	It really all depends.  Tell us which cities you are going between, and we might be able to give more specifics.  But generally bus is cheaper and train is faster.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	bart doesnt go anyway that would take 5 hour<br>  <br>  you dont say where you are going either|`|ND1nFEWSaa	5 hour trip about $ 65-70 dollars
KpOQktc8aa	you cant feel the speed when youre on the plane. my advice to you would be to close the window (if you really have to), though once you get right up there it really is an amazing sight, you get to be above the clouds (quite literally). you dont feel the speed at all, it's just very loud, and trust me just make sure youre comfortable, go to sleep if you get really scared. have a few drinks or something to help you get to sleep. make sure you drink plenty of water, and you should be fine!|`|6f6PmHRTaa	ok ok.. if you sit by the window.. close it before the plane leaves land so you don't have to look out the window. also nothing is going to happen. but as sooon as you do feel comfortable, then you can open the window and enjoy the view. I am as well afraid of heights but airplanes are different. :D|`|wHencbOAaa	have something to keep focus ipod, video games, ect*<br>  chew gum. i was riding in a air plane 2 weeks ago and when your landing it feels like someone is punching you in the Temple. the worst feeling ever! that's the only tips i can give. because i love heights.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Don't look out the window when you take off the first time.

But the lack of sleep and drinks work just as good|`|F32uPjAraa	Take a good book.|`|hTgnvLOSaa	Classic approach is to get drunk.

When you are up in the air, you can't even tell you're moving, most of the time. I bet when you are back on the ground, you will be saying, "Gee, that wasn't so hard!"<br>  <br>  When you get scared, close your eyes and take a deep breath. The plane will make a lot of weird noises as you take off and land, and it would be easy to say "Oh no, that sounds like the wing falling off!" It isn't. (And if it is, hey, you get to be on the news! Just kidding.) Bring a book, or a handheld computer game device if you have one. It's going to be very dull.

JWf1IIpZaa	I'v had that happen before also. What I did was use a dremal, it worked just fine, than pried it apart. Also I tried hammering a slight smaller socket on.|`|54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	Go to a professional, there are other items that need to be inspected if you have a stripped lug nut.  the wheel and hub both need to be inspected for other damage as well. yes most tire shops have a reversing socket, but it should be used with care as the entire lug can be snapped off if it is used incorrectly. Also look for a shop that uses torque controlled tools or torque sticks(looks like a ratchet extension, but is made to limit the amount of torque applied to the lug) when mounting tires. This is probably what caused the problem to begin with( An improperly used impact wrench). This is why I bought my own tire bars and torque controlled impact wrench and learned the proper method to remove and replace my own tires. I got tired (No pun) of stripped and broken lugs and damaged rims from the morons( Uncertified, barely trained Tire Mechanics) around here.it is also acceptable for a shop to tighten the lugs with a manual torque wrench, provided it is done correctly. One last note on this issue. A tire tool like the one that came with your car or a 4way type wrench is for roadside repairs only and the lugs should be re tightened afterward by one of the a fore mentioned methods.|`|sz7mLOLoaa	hi.. there is this lug cutter sold in local car parts store.. where you put it on the lug and tighten the bolt of the tool till the lug is cutted across . good luck|`|EZMkioAgaa	take it to a shop,most have a reversing socket kit..it will work....you might be able to rent the sockets from a autoparts store...you pay 15.00 for a deposit...then return the sockets when finished..in good shape...get your money back.

First two were over 30 years ago.  I cried last ticket.  Don't expect mercy from the cop but you could appear in court and perhaps the judge will reduce it.  That is what happened to me.  I was driving a new and more powerful car, noticed something on the dash I hadn't noticed before and as I was momentarily distracted I  slightly pressed the gas down just as I passed into a much slower, fines double zone.  I just admitted I was wrong but also that I couldn't afford it.  My sympathies.  Buck up, this too will pass.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	You got off easy for going that fast.  And you would have gotten one sooner or later so don't worry about it so much.  My dad got his first ticket when he was 50.

LxRq2zYPaa	3,000 RPM at 60MPH is not a lot at all.

On your shifter it should be P R N D 1 2 3 . Make sure its in D and not in 3 . If you were in 3 your transmission wasn't shifting itself into Overdrive making your RPMs higher at a normal speed. As far as your oil..... check your oil level it might be low and it may be just a coincedence that it was low at the same time.|`|AA10241412	check the oil ? maybe it needs some
F4FCBEgzaa	The principle on which "cold air intake" is derived is based on the fact that cold air is more compact than warm air. This is done to get as much oxygen mass into the combustion chamber to create a more powerful explosion. Thus, the colder the air molecules the more that can be fit into the combustion chamber. Keep in mind that only 20% of air is oxygen and is actually used in the combustion process. To answer your question, the main function of any performance intake is to keep air cold. Plastic is an insulator, metal is a conductor, so Ice Box says their product is superior for keeping engine compartment heat away from intake air.<br>  <br>  Ram air induction is the next step beyond cold air induction. The idea here is to find a high pressure area on the exterior of the body and use that higher pressure to help force more air into the intake - kind of a poor man's supercharger. Back in the '60s, the NASCAR boys simply popped out a headlight on each side and ran hoses to the air cleaner for racing, but it didn't work on the street due to rain getting ported directly to the air cleaner. Then in the '70s Chevy used the area where the windshield and rear of the hood came together. Wind tunnel testing showed them that this "cowl" area was a high pressure spot and "Cowl Induction" was coined. The best part is that rain can't turn corners as well as air can, so at highway speeds, most of the rain continues over the windshield. To this day, cowl induction hoods are used on many hi-performance hoods.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	1. You car already has cold air intake. Go take a look. Follow the intake pipe, and see where it goes. I guarantee you, it goes away from the engine, and towards your front bumper. That's to get cold air. Advertising something as "Cold Air Intake" is to take advantage of retards who don't realize that their cars already have one.<br>  <br>  2. No, there's no different between the different types.<br>  <br>  3. Further to that point, there will be basically no difference to your car's performance. At best, maybe 1-2 wheel horsepower. That's all.<br>  <br>  They've been proven time and time again, to be complete wastes of money.<br>  <br>  Here's a good example:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.importtuner.com/powerpages/0108it_2001_honda_civic_ex/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.importtuner.com/powerpages/01...</a><br>  <br>  $150 for a Hayame intake, for 1.8 horsepower. Does that sound like a part worth buying, to you? And that's a pretty average result.
9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	If you were to put your sub in a ported enclosure you could have around the same output as you would with two subs in a sealed enclosure.  So if you were to just get a ported enclosure custom built for your Type-R you would save a little bit of money. <br>  <br>  The sound quality wouldn't be quite as good but it would still be plenty good enough for most people.  I would recommend the Type-Rs in a ported enclosure anyways because they perform better in that type of enclosure.<br>  <br>  Everytime you double the cone area of your subs you gain 3db.  Everytime you double the power of your system you would gain 3db.  That means you would have a 6db increase from 1 sub to two subs.  These are theoretical values so in the real world the gain is maybe around 3db or so.  When you compare that to the extra output you gain in a ported enclosure the gain is very small.  The difference in output between the two subs in a sealed enclosure and one sub in a ported enclosure is barely noticeable (in output that is, the actual sound may differ).<br>  <br>  So just get a well built enclosure and you will get some added output and save money.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!
Yq2CUhtYaa	Pros: None.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  <br>  1. Does NOT give you 12 wheel horsepower. "ESTIMATED" is the key word. Expect to actually see 2-3  actual wheel horsepower.<br>  2. For $180, you got 2 horsepower. That's 90$ per horsepower. Nice way to apply money.<br>  3. With 2 horsepower, your car will not be faster. You will think it is. And you will drive it harder, which makes it feel like it is. Take it to a track....and no change at all in performance.<br>  4. No change in fuel mileage.<br>  5. Nice how they mention "dyno proven results", but post a video of someone just driving around, rather than any dyno proof. Already, you can tell this is a crappy company.|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	pros: prettier engine bay if you're lucky. maybe a cooler sounding engine.<br>  <br>  cons: see 1st answer.   <br>  <br>  summary: waste of money or the greatest marketing move in aftermarket auto performance history.

In theory this makes the manifold taller/larger and can devolep more horsepower, which it does.. But from my experience, more Hp means more petal, If your driving habits remain the same--I would expect maybe 2-3 more mpg at Highway, and really no result in town..|`|kFsviR9waa	ahh the intake debate , well it all depends , short ram itakes make the car respond slower cause of it sucking in hot engine air but for example when dynoed as on the maxima it gave more power then a Cold air intake which suck cold air out of the fender area or down but the bumper or  wherever the piping leads you ... ,i basically consider it a sound mod unless u tune it afterwords or also do some exhaust work|`|tBq6ZDZvaa	Total waste of money the first answer took the words right out of my mouth.

AA11435704	ROTC will help pay for your college education. When you graduate, you will be commissioned as an officer and will have a minimum service commitment. (This is the same as if you went to the Air Force Academy)<br>  ROTC is not just for the reserves You are considered to be in the reserves while you are in school and then will serve as active duty.<br>  <br>   Contact an Air Force Recruiter for more details|`|Xnod6v5Vaa	Yes. You WILL be active within a month or two of ROTC graduation. ROTC only teaches you basics. How to dress, ranks, procedures, etc. That's it. They don't teach you to fly or whatever job you want. During ROTC you will take a series of tests in you Junior and Senior year that determine your aptitude to do well in flight school. The most important of these is the Air Force Officers Qualifying Test. (AFOQT) If you are selected for flight training, upon graduation of ROTC you will go to flight school. <br>  <br>  I recomend getting this. <br>  I don't remember what it's called exactly but look up:<br>  Ed Rush <br>  Or<br>  How to become a fighter pilot (exactly like that)<br>  <br>  It is a VERY usefull and beneficial tool.

Put higher-octane gas in it (Like half a tank if you want, just enough to increase octane) and some octane booster, that'll give it a bit more power and clean the engine out a bit.

f3b4a3eea25a5783bbde8265b9451986aa	I also love to travel & yes, I do drive a truck for a major dry van carrier that operates in all 48 of 50 states.  This career is good for a young single person with a sense of adventure.  It is a lifestyle not suited to everyone.  I have days where I love my job & days that I wonder why did I get my CDL.  Truckers have to balance federal, state, & local regulations with the needs of their customers & the motoring public.  We are considered Public Enemy #1, despite the fact that most consumer goods & many manufacturing components are transported by truck.<br>  <br>  Truck driving is a trade, like plumbing, electrician, etc., but they don't operate underneath the same rules & regulations that govern other industries.  We have to pass the DOT physical & keep our driver's license clean.  Most drivers don't have 40hr work weeks with overtime, work any hour day or night in all sorts of weather & road conditions, & seldom sleeps in the same town every night.<br>  <br>  There are no specific grade requirements, but you do need a high school diploma or GED & a clean MVR for any company to consider your application.  You need to find your local truck driving school(s) in your area & apply.  School generally lasts from 4-20wks, depending on the program & some programs can help you with financial aid.  To oufit your truck with creature comforts, like TV, a power inverter, tools, etc. can set you back around $500 or more, but some of it is tax deductible.  (I have a CPA do my tax returns every yr, due to over the road business deductions & mortgage interest.)  <br>  <br>  After getting your CDL (Commercial Driver's License). bear in mind that federal regulations will require you from 18-21yrs of age to drive a commercial vehicle within your home state only.  That limits your job opportunities to a handful of companies.  At 21 yrs of age, you can drive interstate which means that you can drive a commercial vehicle across a state line.<br>  <br>  Get your CDL in your home state because your driver's license (CDL or regular) is in a government database that any law enforcement can obtain your information on (Been driving for over 5yrs & have had my license ran in CA, CO, IL, MD, TN, & OR for various reasons).  In addition, if you get your CDL in another state, you will have 30days to get your license transferred to your home state.<br>  <br>  Most truck drivers will see a starting salary in the mid-$20k range, but it will vary, depending on the operation, experience, etc.  Hope I helped. Good luck!!|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Well I am assuming you want over the road long haul. To drive a semi accross state lines you will need to be 21 years old. But you can drive locally at the age of 18, trucks like garbage trucks, coal trucks, log trucks, local delivery. I would suggest, hitting up the local truck stop, and grab some of the free magazines advertising trucking companies. Give them a call and start making your contacts now, so that you can get the experience required before you hit 21. Preparation is key here. If you want to own your own truck then I would suggest looking into some vocational tech schools for maybe diesel mechanic, to service your own truck, you can do this while still in high school.|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	you need to be 21 or older to get a CDL, you ca deliver stuff around town driving anything under 24,000 which is still a good sized box truck, like mattrresses or furniture,,, and like the answer above most wont hire under 25, and you need a clean driving record|`|5C7wKDcRaa	For insurance reasons, none of the majors will hire you until you hit 25.|`|AA11264416	you can get a CDL at 18 but no trucking company or even local places will hire you until your 21 because you have to be 21 to drive a truck requiring a CDL out of state, so you'll have to wait until 21 to be a trucker but you can get the CDL at 18 though if you want, just don't expect to use it until your 21 unless its for a farm or something like that, i tried out trucking and the real test of your driving ability in "good" weather is in the mountains lol|`|ND1nFEWSaa	<a href="http://www.careerexplorer.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.careerexplorer.net</a><br>  <br>  try here

sz7mLOLoaa	hi.. i'm very sure the engine needs to be worked on.. open the valve cover and you will know what happened and you will also know what needs to be done.. if the spring is broken, it will be hard to do a compression check to it.. and also, the valve will need to be replaced if it indeed hit the piston . good if the valve did not puncture a hole in the piston.. <br>  but if a rocker arm is broke, count your blessings.. repair cost is just minimal.. check the push rod, i would definitely replace the lifter on that cylinder,... come to think,, why is the lifter stuck? bad oil? wrong viscosity oil? dirty engine? wrong engine temperature? if this question is not answered, expect more or similar engine problem in the future.. good luck|`|133abf844568680d8b832894174407cbaa	listen to what the first guy said, i have a 2001 mazda b3000 dual sport<br>  that almost the exact same thing happened,except my set of valves on the first cylinder put a hole in the piston, it wasn't pretty,<br>  cross your fingers!|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	There are several things that could be wrong with the valve.

jsQhnXTiaa	As a former mechanic and a guy who races and restores/builds muscle cars I know something about TH350's and 400's. I have a TH350 in my 69 Chevelle 454. It is making 550rwhp and the TH350 handles it just fine. It is a built up transmission though but a TH350 can handle roughly 600-700hp built properly. And like my friend said about the TH400 saps more power from your engine because there is more to turn. You might lose roughly 18-22 percent from a TH350 and 25-30 percent with a TH400. If your running 400hp the stock TH350 can easily handle this as long as the gears and tranny had been rebuilt recently. Good luck!|`|AA12261615	a good built 350 will handle 450 horse power real easy without putting  it in any kind of a bind,i have one in a truck running about 425 horse power and i have had no problems  at all from it,and its been in this same truck for over 4 years,and i light the tires up every chance i get,the turbo 350 is probably one if the best transmissions there is to build,and the toughest,good luck.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	The TH400 saps much more power than the TH350, and at your horsepower level, you absolutely don't need it. TH350's, properly built, will totally work for your projected goal (by the way, when you talk transmissions, its more appropriate to think in terms of torque capacity, since that is what transmissions are normally rated for, and what does the damage when things go awful). <br>  <br>  Since you're working on your dream car and don't have the parts on hand yet, I've become quite the proponent of the 200R4. A well built 200R4 will be about the size of the TH350, bolt up the same way, and will easily handle well over twice the power you're talking (I say again built, mind you!). You can then work on the rest of the package knowing you have an overdrive that will allow you to select a more favorable rear ratio, and give you less of a "step" between gears.|`|v8TWvtQgaa	A th-400 uses up about 25 to 30 HP more than a th-350, and the 400 weighs about 30 lbs more than the 350. <br>  <br>  At 400 HP a good th-350 will do you just fine.

Oy9IYvBTaa	I ran a 1986 S-10 with a 355 Fuel injected V-8 with a 700 R 4 with a 2500 RPM stall converter drove for about 5 years, till I put in a T=5 Camaro 5 speed manual transmission. Had 3:23 rear end 295 60 15 tire in rear I never red line engine in overderive at about 3500 front in got very light. Very fun to drive 16-18 mpg every day 23 on highway 75 miles per hour. Fuel injected is only way to go for performance in economy|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Okay. A newly built 350 horsepower 350 does NOT need a 3500 stall converter! That's too high, and you'll be wasting good driveability (not to mention heating your trans) unnecessarily. The newer cams and heads are up to this performance level without losing bottom end torque. Plus you're talking an elky - something that already has a light behind to begin with. Slap it with a high-stall hit, and it will turn your tires into black giblet unless you set your rear up to launch hard. Honestly I think a 3.73 is a little high for the street (I run a 3.42 on the street in a Camaro and I'm a happy speed monkey) <br>  <br>  Look for a 200R4 - they can be built to stand the torque, and they're not saddled with the weak neck that the 700R4 has. Art Carr recently did an article either in Chevy High Performance or Car Craft that extolled the virtues of the 200R4 overdrive. But you should get it with the extra hardened parts if you want many, many trouble-free years. <br>  <br>  Personally, I have a TH350 with some B&M parts, and I'm looking to put a Gear Vendors overdrive on it - it gives you overdrive for each gear - so you effectively have a 6 speed automatic. Sweet.

These are mostly used for 1/4 mile cars. The 700 has a higher gear ratio and is better for faster highway speeds.|`|v8TWvtQgaa	WTF... How in the world do yall think a 700r4 and a th-400 is any where close to the same transmission<br>  Is everybody a fool? <br>  <br>  The 700R4 is a light to med duty overdrive econo trans made in the 80's to back up low HP (150-210 HP) engines. <br>  <br>  The th-400 is a heavy duty 3 speed auto used in high performance cars and  heavy duty, tow/dump, 3/4, 1 ton truck useages. <br>  <br>  Now the newer 4L80E is pretty much an over drive version of the th-400. <br>  <br>  THM400 - The THM400 was GM's Heavy-duty 3 speed transmission used from 1964 to 1990. Used on large displacement, high torque engines and engines with towing packages. Generally found in Chevy & GM trucks, cadilacs and large displacement engined, full size GM rear wheel drive cars. <br>  <br>  THM700-R4 - 4 Speed transmission used in GM cars and light trucks with the 2.8, 3.1, 4.3, V6, Chevrolet built 305, 350 engines from 1982 to 1992. <br>  <br>  I don't know how the 700r4 can be built "tough" the whole trans was flawed when it came to performance. A built one will do good to hold up to 450 HP, while a built th-400 will handle 1500 HP and laugh at it <br>  <br>  Heres the trans gear ratios. <br>  Th-400 <br>  1st gear  2.48 <br>  second  1.48 <br>  third    1.00 <br>  <br>  700R4 <br>  3.06 <br>  1.63<br>  1.00<br>  .70 <br>  <br>  Now what this means is the 700 r4 will launch harder (or cause more tire spin) in 1st gear but look at the BIG 1-2 gear drop.  Going from 3.06 to 1.63 will drop your rpm way down and engine will have to recover and build back up. <br>  <br>  Thats one major flaw with them, the 1 to 2 gear spacing is too wide. <br>  <br>  Next the 700r4 uses about the same HP as a th-400 to drive it, but the 700r4 has a lockup torque converter with a clutch inside it. That 700r4 converter weighs a good 15 lbs more than the th-400's converter.  The trans is also a good 20 lbs heavier than a th-400 <br>  <br>  <br>  The 700r4's .70 4th gear will help you get better fuel mileage. Thats about it.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	the 700r-4 has a lower first gear ratio, and also has over drive. Effectively it will allow a better seat of the pants feel on take off, and allow your engine to run at a lower rpm in over drive, compared to the th-400. Both have their advantages, the th-400 is just about the strongest transmission you can find, if you plan on upgrading the engine to make serious horse power then it is a good transmission to handle the power.|`|jsQhnXTiaa	Like everyone else said a TH400 and a 700r4 are basically the same except the 700r4 has an over drive gear. You wont get better performance as far as racing is concerned. It will give you better gas mileage and if you have a low gear ration, lets say 4.11 gears, then it makes it a little more street able. But really if your wanting to keep it as a performance oriented car then the best thing to do would be to buy a shift kit for the TH400 and it will allow it to shift at a higher RPM and shift harder and faster. Good luck my friend.

f41f07330effd00e202635eab4dc96b5aa	MAN, OH MAN!! Charlie! give the guy a break! whats with the guilt trip?-did you still have the training wheels on your huffy @ 12?? don't  talk down to the guy. -all rise for judge-mental!!<br>  The answer is: don't go behind your mom's back, but go with dad on this; ask him to pay only half of the safety/license course fee....he already knows they're worth every penny. he'll see that as beginning to take real responsibility in hand. (you do earn your own money, right? -if not, START NOW) the courses supply the bike (in Texas) so you don't have to run out and buy one.  I did this deal with my son, and had hi mom out shopping one day and "accidentally" stopped at the mall parking lot where the course was being administered.... his mom was moved to tears and seeing him in full safety gear riding responsibly did the trick. you don't have to learn it the hard way, do it right the first time. REMEMBER! respect ANY bike's power and LISTEN to the instructors. apply what they teach and you will learn: -and motorcycling will be a lifetime of enjoyment and continued learning. I STILL learn something every day. the day that I think i'm too smart for the road is my last day on a bike. -be safe. have fun.|`|eftUcx8oaa	She already knows that you're responsible so start there.

There isnt much you can do to convince them. The thing is, you mom isnt thinking about how well of a rider you are, she is worried about other idiots that wont see you for that split second that could cost you your life. This is why many say they ride as if they are invisible, always a second ahead of the cars around you, constantly anticipating their every move. <br>  <br>  Good luck. Hopefully you turn 18 soon. Always wear a helmet at the least!|`|qC6kel14aa	Dirt riding is just as safe unsafe as road riding is assuming you are street wise. There are bike training schools and or courses, and  it's a lot easier  to convince your Mum it is safe, so go to a proper registered bike school.<br>  Remember tin top drivers only look forwards, but even then, there is always a percentage of them who are blind.

The Murcielago is more of car to drive really fast so Gallardo is better since it doesn't have as much power. A Porsche is fun but think about, would you rather be seen driving a Porsche(a car that you see everyday) or a Lamborghini(not many people see one every single day). Lamborghini is more of a head turner then a Porsche.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	A Lambo for sure.  I just grew up idolizing them.  Yes you can make a Porsche turbo way faster for half the price.  But by that thinking, you can make an EVO or STI faster then both for a quarter the price.  So if money was no object, I would love a Lambo.  Only thing I like about a porsche is you can get away with parking it places with out the negative attention.  With higher end cars, you can not with out worrying.
54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	I like Wrangler AT or MT. Decent grip in slick conditions, and seems to wear well over time. I got better mileage out of them than I did the michelins. About 90,000 on mine but I have an F250 4X4 so I forked out the extra 30 bucks for the 10 ply heavy truck tires. Also they are not as noisy on the highway as some of the other AT's or MT's are.The only 2 tires I will never use again are the Toyo Open Country, or the Yokohama. The Toyos fell apart after pulling heavy equipment around for a few months and the Yokohama have problems with the inner linnings overheating and starting to crumble as the tires age. Cooper makes a good off road or all terrain tire as well though I haven't used coopers in a while because the local dealer went under. Just be sure to get them balanced when mounted and don't worry much about tire rotation. Modern radial tires once they are broken in need to keep their direction of travel the same. Just have them rotated front to back occasionally to keep even tire wear. if you do a side to side swap then the tires should be remounted and rebalanced. A good tire shop will do this. Also check your pressure constantly. I quit having tire problems years ago when I started checking my tire pressure once a week on my personal vehicle.|`|5C7wKDcRaa	Check www.TireRack.com

XNFvoIGxaa	Three things, your alignment is out, your tires are worn on the sides, You need to replace your sway bar bushes in which case your alignment is out too. If you have to hold onto your wheel tight over bumps then your sway bar bushes are stuffed and giving you too much sway. In which case your alignment will be out. Also your wheel bearings could be stuffed as well. In fact Id lay odds on sway bar over struts... Lie on the ground and look at the bars that go to your wheels, If they look different on either side then they're bent, however sway bar bushes...try that first. I've included a link that shows you what a sway bar looks like roughly (In front of the motor and behind the bumper underneath) and another that shows you what a bush looks like. If the bush looks worse off than this then there's your culprit.<br>  The shaking at speed is 90% positively alignment, and the steering problems sounds almost positively the sway bar bushes. More than likely the bushes went first and the domino effect has caused alignment problems.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	alignment problems, bad tires, etc.  get the car to a shop & don't drive till it's repaired.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	I would start by checking your air pressure, alignment and have the wheels balances.|`|0VHzP9jzaa	well either it could be that your tires arn't all facing the same way, or that your suspension is really bad. you can obviously narrow it down to your tires...are they all on tight, sounds bizzare but still, you never know. sorry im not much help but i mean its either they arn't facing the same direction, suspension, or they are falling off. good luck|`|qjtzjC7Vaa	Sounds like your tires need to be rebalanced and you also need new struts. There is a chance you hit something and your rim is bent or damaged or your tire is damaged, could simply be that your balancing weights fell off the front wheel/ wheels.|`|bB3f4duZaa	Could be the suspension, but more than likely you need to get the wheels balanced...and I've never had a wheel balancing cost me $100.00, so shop around.|`|a26eba86953ed34210b238b49888f72caa	Im pretty sure its your alignment and you need wheel balancing. Its going to run you about 100 dollars.|`|f94429414cd98123c4786b002c4a1354aa	yes your struts can cause the shaking but i would have the tires balanced and rotated first that will be the best starting point and the cheapest if that doesn't do it then i would start having the front end supension looked at i know that sway bar end links will cause some vibration as well as some very loud popping noise on bumps  good luck|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	My dear have it checked out right now. Don't wait as something is very loose. You could end up in the ditch or worse, under a semi.|`|qJTGzKrZaa	The only Zen answer is: WHY NOT.|`|6qPndPvXaa	think what is happening is that the brake rotors are warping and causing an "imbalance".  This, in turn, caused the tires to wear irregularly.  There is probably some wear in the suspension components - most likely ball joints - and that allows the vibration to continue after it is generated by the brake rotor.<br>  <br>  I suggest you have someone look at the brakes - and the suspension - and even if they replace some parts, the vibration may still be presesnt because of the wear in the tires, so you may need to replace them, too. <br>  <br>  <br>  I also had a broken motor mount that did the same thing...check both..bearings and motor mounts and get 2 oppinions but dont tell either one your getting a second and then compare

SNDxHMjQaa	No as long as the container is made to put gas in|`|6jAzWVJGaa	Explain Container, I guess your talking about a reglar Gas Can. but Beginning in 2005,  Most states have change the law for all gas cans sold. They must meet certain “no-spill” requirements and be CARB (California Air Resources Board) approved. THE FOLLOWING STATES REQUIRES REQUIRE CARB APPROVED GAS CANS: Already, CA, DC, DE, MD, ME, CT, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, TX, VA.  CHECK YOUR LOCAL LAWS AND CODES BEFORE ORDERING.  Substantial penalties can be leved for Non-CARB approved gas cans. However, Some states state that you can continue to use your old gas can for as long as it lasts, but you may want to consider replacing it to protect your family’s health and the environment. Expect the Rest of the States to follow shortly.|`|133abf844568680d8b832894174407cbaa	no but in oregon it is illigal to fill you're own car|`|fO5JWKMlaa	if it isnt red and designed for it then yes|`|uiDJlhy5aa	If you mean one of those gas containers, no. You're paying for the gas so you should be able to put it where you want to!|`|54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	If you are asking if it is illegal to top out the tank then no it is not. It is however impolite and a safety hazard to spill over out of your tank while you are doing this. I don't because you don't gain anything from it and over time it will marginally shorten the life of your fuel pump. With a modern vehicle in good running order you might only get 2 to 6 miles out of the tiny amount of extra fuel that you might get. you actually spend more for the spillage than you gain from tiny amount of extra fuel you get. If you run your tank that low you are damaging your fuel system anyway. The same rules apply for filling a gas container. you want to keep a little air space over the fuel for expansion and contraction. If the container is completely full then when it expands from sitting in the sun or sitting in a warm space, you wind up with spillage. Go look in the garage of someone who keeps gas around. Look at the floor around the container. If you see a dark, but shinny  stain on the floor under the container then that persons can has probably been over filled. Also in a tightly closed container this can crack the plastic and cause a leak. As to the laws about this Most communities have laws about fuel spillage and containment. This is usually the responsibility of the vendor or the station itself to insure that adequate safeguards are in place to deal with spillage. It however is everyone's responsibility not to spill fuel or other contaminates anywhere. there are laws about the spillage but not usually about overfilling a container or your vehicle. Overfilled containers are specifically mentioned in some laws, but the wording and details leave a lot to be desired.|`|bcsPyqfUaa	well it depends on what type of contain i guess. if its those orange ones that fill up lawn mowers n stuff then no. but you have to put the container on the ground|`|6sJhoXAAaa	All the automotive stores sell those red gas cans everywhere I've been, so I have to say no.|`|AA11177990	Not if it's made for gas.

sCqdisvnaa	BMW was going to produce the model that they showed (initially in Shanghai) as the Concept CS.  However, when the economy tanked, the project was cancelled.<br>  <br>  It was a 7-series based "4-door Coupe" (whatever that is!).  The Mercedes CLS, effectively an E-class with a low roof line, sleek styling and a large price premium has been such a hit that other manufacturers have rushed to follow:  Porsche Panamerica, Aston Martin Rapide, even VW's Passat CC.  The Concept CS was to be BMW's response.|`|YLajQcFkaa	If the world stayed stable and kept good values and family tradition then NO it would never happen.

I love it.  I get good gas mileage, I have had it since the beginning of September and have not had any thing wrong.  I really don't have much to complain about on it.  Also, Scions are cheaper, built well and you can add lots of accesseries to them if you would like.  As far as room, the back seat does lay down which gives you more space to put things but with the seat up there is not alot of trunk area just enought for say a ice chest and 2 peoples luggage to fit perfectly.  But If it has enough room for you I would advise you to go with it.  Plus it is a safe vehicle and made my Toyota which is always good.

tDZMJue9aa	AP , Litchfield Beach: Feb 20 2009 Made Popular Feb 20 2009<br>  United States :<br>  A mother, daughter and a young man died after a small boat carrying six people capsized only 15 feet from shore on a chilly South Carolina river, authorities said Thursday.<br>  <br>  The 14-foot boat was making the 300-yard journey across the Waccamaw River from the mainland to Sandy Island on Wednesday night when the accident happened, Georgetown County Sheriff A. Lane Cribb said.<br>  <br>  Showers and thunderstorms swept across the coast Wednesday night but Cribb said it wasn’t clear whether the storms had anything to do with the boat capsizing.<br>  <br>  County Coroner Kenny Johnson identified the victims as 19-year-old Shaquatia Robinson of Sandy Island; her mother, 47-year-old Lou Ann Robinson; and 18-year-old Rishard Pyatt. Pyatt’s body was found after a daylong search on Thursday night under the water, close to shore.<br>  <br>  Shaquatia Robinson’s 1-year-old son was found in the water Wednesday night and was listed in critical condition at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston on Thursday.<br>  <br>  When the child was taken to the hospital, his body temperature was in the mid-80s, Johnson said. Doctors were able to raise it into the 90s.<br>  <br>  The sheriff said the woman operating the boat and her 5-year-old daughter were able to safely get to shore. Cribb said it was his understanding that those in the boat could not swim.<br>  <br>  The 12,000-acre island is located between the Waccamaw and Great Pee Dee Rivers and is home to an enclave of about 20 families, most from the Gullah culture. More than 9,000 pristine acres are managed as a wildlife preserve.<br>  <br>  The boat’s passengers were returning to the island after boarding at a landing near Litchfield Beach, an upscale coastal resort community of golf courses, condominiums and restaurants about 70 miles northeast of Charleston.<br>  <br>  The sheriff called it one of the worst boating accidents in recent memory in Georgetown County.<br>  <br>  “All of them are bad, but lately it’s been one of the most tragic we have had,” he said.<br>  <br>  AP , Litchfield Beach: Feb 20 2009 Made Popular Feb 20 2009<br>  <br>  <br>  thats the only thing i could find about any boat capsizing off the coast of sc

It's an old platform, but it is a proven platform at least.<br>  <br>  These cars are durable, reliable, comfortable (the average adult will not complain about riding in the back seat), relatively easy to repair and maintain, relatively cheap to insure, and parts are cheap and plentiful.<br>  <br>  Fuel economy is okay, considering that it's a full-sized car with a 4.6L OHC V8.<br>  <br>  However, if the car has cruise control (which it likely will, especially if it's the LS trim) check with a Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury dealer to see whether or not the car has had the cruise control deactivation switch recall service performed.  A fault in the cruise control deactivation switch on the hydraulic brake master cylinder could lead to an electrical fire in the engine bay, even if the car is not running.<br>  <br>  The recall service involves modifying the engine compartment wiring harness to install a fuse for the deactivation switch; in the event of a short circuit, the fuse will blow, keeping the short from causing a fire in the first place.  The switch is actuated by hydraulic pressure in the brake master cylinder, which deactivates cruise control.  All that separates the electrical parts of the switch from the fluid is a thin membrane.  If the membrane is ruptured, brake fluid can make its way to the electrical contacts, causing a short that can trigger a fire if the brake fluid is ignited.<br>  <br>  Another thing to look out for is if the engine uses an intake manifold made of a polymer composite instead of aluminum or cast iron.  The composite manifold is known to crack, leading to coolant leakage into the engine.<br>  <br>  A problem that can occur with the Panther platform is a gas tank fire in the event of a severe rear-end collision.  The rear axle can pierce through the fuel tank.  There are protective measures available for these fuel tanks, but they are not installed on civilian vehicles by Ford from the factory so you may have to pay to get such a protective device installed.

Jeep owners think they have some sort of corner market on SUVs, since Jeeps have been around for a long time.<br>  <br>  But that's about it.|`|Rwn0svq0aa	I politely disagree with the first response to your question. He implies their is nothing special about Jeep. Conversely, the Jeep brand has a loyal following, which means that people who drive Jeep may be on their third or fourth vehicle. It is possible to have a less sophisticated lower performing vehicle, that is not as well fastened together as it's peers, but hold it's value to it's target audience. And that same product can have a unique history alongside a quirk that makes it beloved. What comes to mind is Harley Davidson Motorcycles. The Harley and Jeep have a somewhat similar history, with both being pressed into military service. As you well know Harley's trademark quirk is the classic oil leak and the putt, putt rumble. <br>  Jeep too is one of those classic American commodities that has many war stories to tell through our veterans and through the brand's own scars with it's travails in manufacturing. Jeep was formerly made by Willy, AMC and at the present moment Chrysler.<br>  I think it was philosopher David Hume who once stated that "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." So is the case with Jeep Cherokee and the entire Jeep brand. Jeep is an iconic American brand that has a great story. To purchase a Jeep, a Jeep lover would then assume you are in agreement that you have something to add to the brand's reputation for rugged individualism.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	It's because they are generally more capable off pavement then they typical SUV. This has changed a bit over the past few years as they have left the simple drivetrain designs behind for more car-like products. All of the older models with solid axles front and rear have a very large volume of aftermarket support for off roading upgrades. Because of this they are more in demand by those who actually drive on terrain/trails more difficult then a gravel road maintained by the forest service. For those kinds of roads 99% of the time you can drive ANY passenger car over them except in really foul weather. When you add deep ruts, large rocks, ledges and drop offs a foot or more high a properly set up suspension and 4wd drivetrain allows you to transit the area. It helps to have a "old fashioned" iron block engine that lasts for 200k+ miles and more compared to most of the small suvs with their "high-tech" motors that need overhauls by 150k miles.|`|08a542503113638ff89e9695a92c2c8baa	Its a Jeep thing, you just wouldn't understand! ;)<br>  <br>  Seriously though, the reliability and offroad worthiness of a Jeep help us owners maintain value.  <br>  <br>  I paid $2900 for my 160k Jeep Grand Cherokee a year ago, and it was the best investment I ever made!<br>  <br>  I will settle for nothing BUT a Jeep.

RitEOApJaa	don't take this the wrong way, bu tit sounds like the problem is you not  the car. on most cars built up to 1997, it's a good idea to let them warm up about two to three minutes at least when you first start up in the morning. just like you, they need that time to get the juices flowing(gas,oil, tranny fluid) and to all the right places so that your jeep runs like it should. start it up in the morning and get out of the jeep right after. if you have a 99 wrangler, after you get out, head to the rear and listen to the tailpipe. you will hear the engine running, and you will also after about thirty seconds to a minute later, hear the car take a breath(revs a little, then settles down) this means your jeep is almost ready to go. give it about a minute or two more, and you should be fine to go on your way.<br>  <br>  ignore the above post. i didn't see your earlier question and went with my gut there. <br>  <br>  you need to do one of two things:<br>  1. replace your fuel filter. these can go bad, despite what the person in your earlier question said. jeep has a replacement part number for it for a reason. also, depending on what fuel tank you have on your cherokee, you may have rust blocking the fuel line (either at the filter or the intake inside the tank). <br>  2. check your fuel pump. i'm not saying to replace it, just check it out: check the wires for fraying  or cuts, run a voltage check, etc. pull the pump off the tank and clean it. again, you might have a little smidgen of rust depending on if you have a metal tank or not. next, check your fuel lines from pump to engine. check for any kinks, and/or dents to make sure you have proper flow. replace as necessary.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh'yeah, plug in your o2 sensor again. it's there for a reason|`|AA11662307	try an injector cleaner.

Do this check.  Without hooking up another battery with jumper cables turn the key to the on position.  Do the dash lights come on? If they do are they nice and bright or dim? Then try to start the engine, do the dash lights go out completely?  If the lights go out or are very dim when trying to start the engine the battery is very low, perhaps shorted out internally. If that is the case then the alternator does not have enough voltage to operate. Judging by the way it happened I would say the battery is bad.  You can take the battery out and take it to Checker or Autozone and they will test it for free.  Even though your alternator is not very old it can also be bad it does happen from time to time. Quality control is not what it use to be

fQBfjdz1aa	no fault only applies to injuries where basically you file under your own policy first in most states.  Your auto policy is primary for the medical bills incurred by your son.  Your medical insurance normally has a right to recovery of those funds.  I wouldn't spend the money and make sure you talk to the medical insurance first.  in most cases they will ask for that back.  However there is some good new.  The auto probably paid the entire bill.  The medical insurance probably has an agreed rate with the hospital resulting in a lower cost.  For example the bill was $1500 from the hospital of which the auto insurance paid you this amount.  But because your health insurance has an agreement with that hospital they paid $700.  You are only required to pay them back the portion that they paid out.  so the remaining $800 would be your son's to keep.<br>  <br>  I'm glad that he wasn't seriously injured.  And I hope he's doing better.

WO68RZdIaa	You will need to remember that you are higher and longer than the vehicles you are accustomed to driving & will need to take turns a little wider, but without leaving your lane if possible. <br>  <br>  The type of car hauler will make a difference too.For example- a 2 wheel dolly, meaning that you only drive the front wheels of your car up on it will make your towed equipment shorter in length than if you are pulling a car trailer where you pulled the entire car up on. <br>  <br>  Backing is another thing that will cause you problems. If you have never backed up a vehicle pulling a trailer, it is pretty easy to jack-knife the trailer & not only possibly damage the U-Haul equipment, but also your own car. Just remember when you are backing up, if you want the trailer to go left, you will need to turn your steering wheel right & vice-versa.<br>  <br>  I drove trucks professionally for 10 years, even taught students how to drive a semi during that time. The biggest problems my students had was shifting gears in a non-synchronized transmission & learning to back up. The average length of my tractor-trailer from bumper-to-bumper was approx 60 feet & the trailers were either 48 or 53 feet in length.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Just never back up. The trickiest thing is backing up. If you get stuck in that situation find someone who can back it up for you. <br>  <br>  Just take it slow and easy. The U-Haul trucks are easy to drive, but don't expect them to drive like your car...ESPECIALLY while towing. <br>  <br>  Give yourself plenty of room. If you pass someone...remember that you have a car behind you.|`|98aUwjuwaa	You have to make wider turns than usual. You'll get a feel for it pretty quick I bet.<br>  <br>  One thing that's good to know about pulling a trailer - if it starts getting wiggly behind you - you might be tempted to put on the brakes, but it's actually easier to control if you speed up and pull it straight before slowing down - that make sense?<br>  <br>  hth,<br>  Andrea<br>  <a href="http://learnitstepbystep.com" rel="nofollow">http://learnitstepbystep.com</a>

7L0zp7O6aa	Subaru is one of the only manufacturers that sold more cars in 08 than 07.  The release of the new Impreza and Forester helped with that a lot.  And the new Imprezas sold in record numbers for the first six months or so after it's release.  With that said, that doesn't mean they made a bug profit.  Because people are finding it more and more difficult to get loans, They are having to give big discounts to get people approved so profits are not big.  And Subaru's hold their value very well.  Their quality is way up with the top cars of Honda and Toyota now so yes, in certain regions used ones still cost a lot.  The best way to get a good idea of what they are selling for in your ares, check your local classifieds in NASIOC.com and see what people are getting for them.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Honda and Toyota, in addition to Subaru, are making money.

They are highly reliable and hold on to their value for many years.<br>  <br>  If the dealer isn't willing to negotiate, simply walk away from the deal.

Unfortunately, an employee cannot use traveling expenses as a deduction for the purposes of reducing Income Tax liability as they are not 'wholly, exclusively and necessarily' incurred as part of work. A self employed person may be able to, so one way to reduce the outgoing is by becoming self employed and pay tax under Schedule D rather than Schedule E. However, this has so many downsides, including the need to file annual accounts with HMRC that is probably isn't worth it, even if your employer would (or could, under tax legislation) allow you to be self employed. You would also loose all employment rights such as rights to redundancy pay (probably very important in these difficult times) If your only source of income is your salary, then you have to bite the bullet and pay out of earned income.. If you have a sizeable amount of capital, you have to calculate whether it is cheaper to buy, say, monthly season tickets rather than an annual one, and allow your capital to earn interest
uL5772kCaa	Edgar, please learn the basics before you go and babble on with something you don't know.<br>  <br>  A sealed box does not put a higher stress on your subwoofer. In fact, subwoofers can take more power when they are in sealed boxes because they have the air "cushion." with a ported box, the power handling is greatly reduced below tuning frequency.<br>  <br>  Now for the question. I think boxes will come with wires, of not, you can just use normal speaker wire. Yes, you will need to drill holes, and screw down your subwoofer.|`|2gzy7DwWaa	You would need some extra speaker wire to hook them up to the positive and ground that come with the box. Then just hook it up to the amp, you'll get it when you buy the box and sub. And you will need to drill the screws in to secure the sub into the box. A ported box is better then a sealed box. A seald box puts more stress on the sub. Ported gives you longer base and sound.

Did your contract have an exact vehicle listed on it with a VIN # or did it just state something like " a Toyota Camry" ( for example). This MAY come under the law known as "bait & switch" where a dealer says that they have a car in stock, then says sorry, we made a mistake, and tries to sell you a more expensive car. Probably best to go to the dealer and take ALL copies of contract and destroy in your presence, then go elsewhere for a car|`|Jpqswddmaa	Uhh , no.<br>  <br>   If the car you signed for doesn't exist...<br>   the contract is worthless.<br>  They owe you nothing, you are both back at zero again as far as making a new car deal.|`|AA12018403	No, there can be a laundry list of reasons as to why they could not deliver the car.  The best you have is to just say no.|`|HQrMEkm0aa	A car salesperson is tricky and preys on not so smart customer.  it's their way of getting you into buying a more expensive car.  Every salesperson knows what's in stock or not before finalizing the deal/signing contract.  The dealership owes you nothing and you owe them Zero.  Tear up all the paper works and walk away before they get you then they may change their mind and give you the higher trim model for the same price.

A gasket prevents these from leaking.  If they are not leaking they do not need to be replaced.  That said, if the valve cover or oil pan are being removed because they must to be removed in order to make a repair, the gasket needs to be replaced whether it's leaking or not.|`|3saEQEuuaa	An oilpan gasket is the seal between the bottom of the engine block and the oil pan.

Although, I recommend going to your local speed shop and just getting them there the same day because not only do you usually get free instillation with purchase but they get covered with the stores warranty longer than if you bought them online.

Almost all coolers use ambient temp to cool. best is to connect add on Cooler to return line from radiator to max cooling effect.|`|AA11273149	unless you are hauling heavy loads or driving a lot in the mountains a cooler won't help you much. Just maintain the transmission well and you will be ok.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	I have never heard of a oil cooler cooling to much, ever, so i would have to say no.|`|oaH2p181aa	You can not keep your transmission too cool. The cooler the better. Keeping the tranny fluid as cool as possible results in longer life and better power transfer and better throttle response. It could even lead to better gas mileage.

I have no doubt 10 miles is do-able.<br>  <br>  Of course the air can have an adverse effect by limiting the distance the whistle can be heard, such as when snowy conditions are present.  That is why it is important to look before crossing the tracks in your car or even on foot, because you may not hear the whistle at all...

Nr7e4jrYaa	The question you need ask yourself is, if the car sells to somebody else would you be upset for not having paid what he asked.  If the answer is "yes, i would be upset" then you're better off not risking it.  Call him and make a slightly higher offer but be willing to pay whatever his lowest price is.  Typically by moving only $100 from his original price, that means he's not willing to sell it for much less and is willing to wait it out.|`|30LMCJrAaa	There is a school of thought in negotiations that says "it's not how much you raise (or lower) your offer, but how many times you move".     You should skip the phone call because that doesn't show the seriousness of your offer. Go in person and tell the seller you are prepared to do business NOW and that you will pay cash. Emphasize the ease of doing business with you.     Now for the numbers: He was at 5100.00 and you were at 4200.00 That's a difference of  900. A realistic target would be to split the difference which would put the deal at 4650.     The first offer should show some movement on your part but leave room to negotiate. Make the offer 4400 cash now. If he is motivated to sell he will accept or counter with a better price.      Make your next offer a LITTLE higher, but not very much. You want to show that you are flexible and serious. If he wants to make a deal he will have to move as well.     The most important thing going into a deal is to know your limits and stay within them.     good luck|`|e0CED2EZaa	hes not going to contact you. you need to contact him and its not too early i would call him and offer him 4900. if he still says no. say 5000 and thats all you can do. he will take it

AA12261615	try running a pressure check on the cooling system, i ran a check on a 98 model today that is doing that and its showing to have a bad loss of pressure somewhere,when its running check to see if the top or bottom radiator hose swells up and gets real hard that's a sign there's an internal leak on it,there's a good possibility you have something blocking one of the return passages in the engine,that will cause it to run hot all the time,good luck.
AA12261615	you shouldn't have to many problems from it ,especially with it being low mileage,one thing i would do though is take it and have a good mechanic check it real good,they did give some problems with the bal joints and tie rod ends wearing out prematurely on them,so it might be a good idea to get the front suspension checked out on it,other than regular maintenance on it just keep up with all the small things that will break and tear up over time and it should last you a long time,most of the problems with the dodges is poor maintenance,people think you can buy one and drive it forever without doing any up keep on it and that's not true,neglect it and it will cost you more money in the long run to keep it going,you probably got a good truck just do really good maintenance on it and it should be alright for a while,but it will tear up on you sooner or later,all vehicles do,good luck with it.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Thats a GREAT truck.

The 90-91 A1 had a redline of 6500 where the 92-93 A1 had a 6800 redline, due to the different cam profile. Also, the 90-91 was OBD0, 92-95 was OBD1, and 96-01 was OBD2. They are all very similar, but there are minor differences.

There are other indicators located in different places to tell where the "apparent" wind is coming from.

m3HgLw5Laa	Okay if you want to run two amps and a cap the best option is to run power from the battery to the positive on the cap. run a ground from the negative on the cap to an appropriate grounding point. run power from the positive(not the negative if you do that then your system wont be setup as a parallel circuit) on the cap to a distributor block. (a device that correctly distributes power from one or more inputs into one or more outputs. available at car audio store. you would need a single input ant at least two outputs. it would cost about 10 to 20 bucks) Then run two power lines out of the distributor block, one to each amp. run ground wires out of each amp and a remote wire out of each amp and solder them both to the remote lead on your head unit.|`|IuF26BFSaa	well it depends if you only have one amp. first of all, the cap is just a cut off point when it comes to set up. if you only have one amp powering 2 subs, you are gonna run a power wire from ur battery to the cap, then from the cap to the amp. then run ur remote wire from your after market stereo to your cap, then from ur cap to the amp. then lastly run one ground wire from your trunk metal to your cap, then another from ur cap to your amp. make sure to scratch of the paint though to get a good ground. also make sure before you do all of this, take the negative of your battery.i hope i have answered ur question. if not, write back with another one.
4biGrjPkaa	The alarm unit has developed a fault, not sending a signal to the indicators. Should still be under warranty (unless it was registered in Jan '06), get it in asap to get it repaired, not because its serious, just so you dont need to pay!|`|rTDbxYYcaa	It could be the sensor that tells the car that the boot is closed. The car still locks but the hazards don't flash to let you know something is still open. My Clio does this. Hazards only flash if my boot is shut. If not, it locks but no flash|`|uEjh3CAbaa	sounds like a loose wire to the lights from the alarm.But try disconnecting the battery then reconnecting it.|`|k3PPULbMaa	It sounds like one of the door catches maybe faulty. The catch has a switch built into it that controls the interior lights and the door open warning light, if the ecu does not see a signal from all of the switches it will not flash the indicators when you lock the car, but will still flash them when you unlock the car.
