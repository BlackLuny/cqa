Brush teeth, put on clothing, etc while waiting.<br>  2] apply cream blush, then powder blush of same shade for lasting color.<br>  3] brush entire face with translucent loose powder [ non-comedogenic of course ] after all 'skin' makeup, and before all 'eye' makeup.

You shouldn't do that if you want a cleaner look.|`|CU9pfIR2aa	If you want a fresher look, I would cut down on the mascara and liner (a little is better). Try concealer on the scars (light, and a mineral type with no oil) and then put some light foundation over that and use a powder puff to prevent it from fading to quickly. To make your cheeks seem thinner keep them pale, and don't wear blush (if you do, it makes your cheeks seem rounder, which, is also very good looking). Also try some gloss and light eye shadow. Good luck!|`|TNx6Kdf9aa	I had the same problem several months ago.  I was using dermablend because I wanted to cover my acne scars. It helped but it would make my skin look so flaky.  I searched everywhere and found MAC.  It is pricey but IMO, worth it.  My skin isn't ever going to be perfect but the MAC makeup really helps smooth my skin.  <br>  I went to the MAC counter and told them my issues and they matched me with what I needed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I know how frustrating this can be.|`|gnWodF2jaa	Hi ! I know many other people who had the same problem as you. What you wanna do is first use your cover up and put it all around your face. If you have fair skin you should probably look all white. Next you  get a nice rosy blush. Not to pink though because it makes your makeup look unnatural. What you wanna do with your blush is brush it on your cheeks up towards your temple and down towards the side of your face to make a slimmer look. Don't over do it though!  This should be giving you a natural look. To make your blue eyes stand out I suggest a nice silver eyeliner. It really brings out your eyes and it's very clean. Instead of mascara you could always try fake eyelashes. Some mascara tend to smudge alot. Fake eyelashes are probably best! Good luck with everything. :)|`|intuNZllaa	It's okay, I have acne too.<br>  And it sucks, lol ):<br>  <br>  My best advice: Don't put makeup on unless you have a clean face to work with. Otherwise, you're piling on foundation over lots of bacteria on your face. (Which isn't good, because you're layering too much makeup while your face is unclean)<br>  <br>  Best things for you to do:<br>  <br>  1. Buy a face/makeup PRIMER. This makes your face appear smoother, make your pores look smaller and holds you foundation for longer. (Get a type that wont clog your pores and designed for your skin type)<br>  <br>  2. Get OIL ABSORBING Sheets. These things absorb the oil on your face, so if you feel like touching up on makeup, get rid of the excess oil off your face before you reapply makeup. (PS: This oil blotting sheet is inexpensive and won't take the makeup off your face. Just dab, don't rub)<br>  <br>  3. To make your cheeks look thinner, there is something called "contouring" where it defines your cheeks. You take a bronzer, suck in your mouth (like a fish) and then using a brush, dust some bronzer in the hollows of your cheeks. Works great. :)<br>  <br>  ^ www.youtube.com <3 Just search up "how to contour your cheeks"<br>  Will be amazing, trust me. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  And don't worry about acne, a lot of people have it (like me) and we make it through!<br>  <br>  Good luck :) !|`|pc3RbN1jaa	I would start by getting a really good concealer made for someone with your skin situation.  Dermablend is a cosmetic company that caters to people with face and body scarring, tattoo covering or facial discoloration.  Try a concealer by them, and use your normal foundation, or a mineral foundation like Bare Minerals, on the areas that are not in need of cover.  If your foundation is fading, a makeup primer will do the trick.  Laura Mercier, Benefit, Nars, and Shu Uemura make great ones.  If your makeup looks discolored, that means that the consistency and/or the color is not right for your skin, so you need to change.  There are plenty of cosmetics companies that are hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic, so you don't need to stick with Clinique if you cannot find something that works the way it is meant to for you personally. <br>  For blush, don't apply too much directly to the apples of your cheeks, or if you must, then use a bronzer as a contour in the hollow of your cheeks (the space between the apples and your jawbone).  Don't brush it on in a crazy line or use a brush too small, a blush brush that is made for contouring would be ideal.  Sonia Kashuk, MAC, and many others make great brushes in many price ranges.  You need good tools to make everything work the way it is supposed to.  <br>  For liner, I would ease up on the top/bottom line in order to make it more natural.  A kohl liner in a brown or gray is less harsh than an espresso/black/navy.  You can also use a smudger brush or qtip to soften the line after you apply, or to even it out.  Mascara on top and bottom can be done, just subtly.  Go with a lengthening mascara (Lancome Definicils or Loreal Bare Natural) that won't be too volumizing to keep away from the tarantula lashes.  Then go easy on the shadow, or at least stick to the neutral tones.  If you do up your eyes, go easy on lips too.  Stick with a great neutral toned gloss or a lip stain and a sheer gloss over the top.  I love MAC, Laura Mercier, and Stila glosses.  Victorias Secret also makes some killer sheer lipsticks and glosses.  <br>  <br>  PS: Skincare is key.  Your makeup will never hold the way it is supposed to if you have dry, oily, flaky, or broken out skin. Find a skincare regimen that is simple and works for you.  All you really need is a good cleanser that removes all your makeup, and a moisturizer, if you are young.  I love Purpose (drugstore stuff) because it is gentle, gets all my makeup off, and is recommended by many dermatologists.  I use the cleanser and moisturizer.  You can go the proactiv route if you still have acne issues, or I have heard that Laura Mercier and Shiseido have fabulous skincare options.  But less is more, you don't need 500 layers on your face.  But do use an eye cream--that is a must to make your concealer and eye colors go on right.  <br>  <br>  Take care and happy makeup shopping!

wWzK6eJaaa	They have this tool at the drugstore that you can use on blackheads and whiteheads.

I think it works good!!|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well for me, even when I don't bother them, I still get scars on my face. Usually I just douce them in rubbing alcohol to dry it out, that will make them smaller.

WLuEIwp5aa	Ah, this is a serious point of debate among some people.  I think that if it's all the way up towards your hand, it should be right side up when you're holding your arm up and looking at your wrist.  If it's more on your forearm, it should be right side up when your arm is hanging down at your side.<br>  <br>  Make sense?|`|zggJKu5Gaa	WTF?  Why are you asking this question?  Whichever way you like better.  There is no "right" or "wrong" way.  Whichever way you think it looks the best is the way it should be.  It is your body, your tattoo, and your money.

intuNZllaa	To darken POWDER foundation: mix with dark/golden/light brown eyeshadow, or BRONZER. <br>  <br>  To darken LIQUID foundation: same as up there ^, except use creams, don't use powder.<br>  <br>  Or, I have cocoa butter moisturize that is slightly tinted. I'd add that to my moisturizer.<br>  <br>  To make it lighter: Moisturizer, or just lighter colours of foundation/concealer (mix it together) or same as above, only with light colours.

XZ0RvmTRaa	i dont know about tattoos, but why shouldn't rocketwife answer? sorry just wondering|`|clInlnIqaa	Please just wait. A tattoo is a very big decision and should wait until you are 18, when you are a little older and you are more aware of your likes and dislikes. You may not think so now, but you may hate tinkerbell in a few years. Then what? Getting that removed is thousands of dollars and quite painful. If you still like tinkerbell when you are 18, go for it. At least then you'll be adult enough to decide and to get one legally. From your past questions you are still quite young, and it's against the law to tattoo someone of your age. And anyone that does tattoo you will not be the most clean and reputable. If they tattoo a minor obviously they don't care about anything. And your health is not worth risking for a tattoo. I implore you to wait.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	I dunno, I don't know why your mom objects to it.  Figure out how to allay her fears or just suck it up until you're 18.  I could tell you right now I would never let my kids go get tattoos until they're 18, I had to wait for mine and pay for them myself, same thing for them.<br>  <br>  I have no idea how much tattoo artists around you charge or how fast they work.  You'd have to go in for an estimate.|`|AA11950233	are you a little girl like 13? <br>  <br>  wait till you are 18. You might not like Tinkerbell anymore.|`|tiddZZuAaa	if i were you i wouldnt get it, im not against tatoos atall but just think when you in your 80's and you have this big colourful tinkerbell on your arm|`|bmdBGWGdaa	wait until you don't need your mom's permission|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Why can't Rocketwife answer? Because she tells the truth and you don't like to hear it? You know what, I loved tinkerbell at your age! I'm only 21 now and the thought of a tinkerbell tattoo makes me shudder. There's nothing you can say to your mum that will alter her decision - if she decides, for some ridiculous and irresponsible reason, to agree - she will do that anyway. If she decides to disagree, trust me, you won't sway her. Lets just hope you have a responsible mother! And, just like with all the millions of other 'how much will this tattoo cost' questions - it depends on the studio.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Dear God don't do it! Tinkerbell??? What the hell? You'll regret Tinkerbell one day! I'm not opposed to tats, I have 3 myself, but this is an incredibly stupid tattoo and I'm begging you to at least wait until you're 18 before you get youself inked.

She was definitely showing you the book because she wanted you to ask her out, and she's to shy to do it. And those smiles are hints too. DEFINITELY ask her out!

kCioxjwFaa	Yes they did. :\|`|Fjixv6d3aa	yep
tlsgvCwHaa	Totally agree with you. I'm barely 18, but I feel as if it has been overdone and overused. Especially monroe piercings, and septum, its this whole stupid trend going on right now. I love piercings and tattoos, it's always going to be with me, but I will be honest and truthful, people are over doing it. Its not being done culturally now or for a meaning, its being done now to just look cool and fit in and that sucks. It's like oh my god I have to get a piercing because my favorite artist has it, or oh my god I have to get a IPHONE because it's so in.  Yeah, see the same thing here?<br>  <br>  Anyway,  just ranting out.<br>  <br>  But yes I agree.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	For myself i have never seen them as a style or fad..Some people do,but i got them cause i liked them,and i did not do it to rebel..The ones that did it to rebel and got them cause they are in style are the ones going to regret them...|`|zmjAccMFaa	Yeah some of them are getting played out now.<br>  Like just ones that everyone gets, the other ones are still cool though.|`|N3OuAcx3aa	Really old, it would be extremely stupid to get a piercing.|`|tWgGLVxXaa	Yeah it is kind of getting old.<br>  I have a nose ring, and even though not a lot of people have a ring compared to a stud, it still seems like a ton of people have it pierced, and I just don't think it is as cool anymore. I almost regret getting it.|`|xxSGhywoaa	Yea, like 20 years ago.  I feel the same way with tattoos.  They are just over done and unoriginal.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Yeah. I work in a supermarket and it seems like every second person has a facial piercing of some kind. I think it was more of a rebellion thing back in the day but now they just look kinda silly.
Awv7stIJaa	Man I have the same problem, but I've been getting pretty good results from what I've been doing.<br>  I've been taking a multivitamin everyday, painting my nails frequently, using a strengthening polish remover, and using a clear lacquer when they're bare. So far they're really thick and growing out pretty well.<br>  Good luck!|`|Kl0i5wRaaa	Well, if your nails break a lot you might have a calcium or iron deficiency. There are nail+hair strengthening Iron tablets (but be careful of those if you are pregnant or at the risk of pregnancy), drink some skimmed milk for Calcium.<br>  <br>  Another thing is, try to be careful while doing chores as I always accidentally breaking my nails while doing dishes or cleaning.<br>  <br>  I like to use the Vaseline nail+hand cream as well :)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|0xtU8bG5aa	i would paint a coat of UV nail polish coat on your nails. they dry quick and are strong so it won't break or chip.|`|Xpj8Mn2laa	I used Dr Lewinns "Revitanail" works really well to keep nails strong. nails - don't cut if they are alreadu weak cutting wont be good for them. Gentle file will be good.  I never thought I'd have strong / thick / long nails - Revitanail is AMAZING! <br>  <br>  You can also get a calcium polish for them. It isn't a polish as such so you can put it on as much as you like - just look in your local beauty supply store :)<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|c0UhndO6aa	At least you can grow your nails out . I have a nail biting problem . It sucks .
l6PeuLOOaa	black would be awsome :o you are pretty ;) dont critisize yourself|`|BTAcwiMIaa	I don't think you should dye it jet black only because you look pretty pale but i think a dark brown would look really pretty on you.

Or burgandy. I just think you'd look good with red hair. <br>  I wouldn't go jet black, I think it'd be really harsh against your skin color.<br>  <br>  I love how you have your hair cut.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	yes you are pretty, dont put yourself down, i wouldn't do jet black what about a pretty chestnut brown..which is a medium-dark brown but it has some highlights in it.........jet black it too hard looking if you ask me...what is your natural hair color? i would go only 2 shades darker or lighter than that.......|`|BXgBZ5KVaa	you are a brat- your GORGEOUS<br>  yes it would look amazingg|`|2CAtj8d5aa	I think brown would look better than black on you.<br>  But I also think black would look better than blonde.|`|R1scPRfVaa	Yeah..

You may also try requesting a sample straight from Urban Decay.  I get mine from eBay.

nwDe2nHJaa	Hahah this is funny.  I live in Nebraska and I assure you we are normal.  We dress the same as people do in Minnesota, Texas, California, Boston...everywhere.  We don't wear long prairie dresses and cowboy boots or anything like that.  Just like anywhere else you have people wearing Hollister, Abercrombie, American Eagle, Wet Seal, Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, Hot Topic...basically everything.  <br>  <br>  Some big trends in Nebraska right now are NorthFace jackets, Burberry Scarves, Coach messenger bags, Uggs, fashion accessory scarves, v-necks, and skinny jeans.<br>  <br>  Basically, if you look at the people around you, people in Nebraska are wearing the exact same thing.|`|L0FPStGxaa	I used to live there...

TjPwxbuJaa	The wearable area indicates how long the plug is. Some people have ear lobes that are thicker than others. If I get plugs that are not long enough, the plugs won't be long enough for the hole and the ear 'flesh' will extend past the plug. Not good. So I have to get more "wearable area".|`|ZaGvokzEaa	idk google it
idhcqr5Daa	First start by cleaning your nails using a scrubbing brush and a mild soap. <br>  Then dry them thoroughly and apply a light hand cream. <br>  Now wait til the hand cream has soaked in and then using a nail file, file your nails down to one length even if they are really short. <br>  Now rinse your hands to get rid of any dust from filing. <br>  Now your ready to paint start with applying two coats of paint in a bright color and then add a clear top coat when dry. <br>  Every week take off the nail polish and apply cuticle cream/oil and file nails neatly. <br>  Eventually they will reach the length you desire. <br>  Remove Nail polish thoroughly. <br>  Note! Keeping nails painted all the time actually makes nails stronger! Just be sure to refresh your polish. <br>  Water <br>  Scrubbing brush <br>  Mild soap <br>  Towel <br>  Hand Cream <br>  Nail File <br>  Coloured nail polish <br>  Clear top - coat <br>  Cuticle cream/oil <br>  <br>  x0x0_Lei

7ouqu8f4aa	Yes, it was terrible. I had died my hair black, and ended up dreading it completely.    I ended up having to strip my hair, twice. The aftermath of that was a bleached blond color with red looking spots all over my head. So I went to the Salon and ended up having to go with a light-medium brown. After about a year I was back to my blond hair that I missed so much.    I know where you are coming from, and its not a fun place to be.     Good luck hun!!|`|5U08NILHaa	you have to go to the hair dressers i completely wrecked my hair by dying my naturally blonde hair black and trying to get it back =/    it started this like this http://img19.picoodle.com/img/img19/3/2/...    then i bleached it twice D= and had to put a wash in ginger dye over it to cover the patchyness http://img19.picoodle.com/img/img19/3/2/...    then it was in such bad condition i had to go to the hair dressers and after three trips to the hairdressers and about 200 it looked like this http://img19.picoodle.com/img/img19/3/2/...    then i got impatient and bleached it myself again twice. now it's the right colour, but i had to have all my hair cut off because it was so bad it was just breaking off of my head and i would have gone bald D= http://img32.picoodle.com/img/img32/3/2/...    so yes, please go see your stylist so they can strip the colour out for you, and don't do what i did.  btw it took a close to a year to get from black to blonde.|`|IXWMIOPiaa	you can bleach it or there is a hair dye that takes out dyed colour but i dont know how effective tht would be in your case ( i think its called 'oops' or something), hope this helps a little!|`|7d44f700ee742e7892a02928c7a89dd0aa	Bleach is the only way to do it

Just my opinion.|`|OP6zAOULaa	Honda Civic. there a reliable older car. (1998-2002 model) although there easy to break into. i recently baught my (own! i've been driving x4 years though, just havent needed one) first car, a used chevy cobalt. if she's paying for her own gas i can get up to 36 mpg. if your looking for saftey  for her (she's just learning) an older sivlerado or toyota pickup. think back to when you had your first car did you get into any fender benders? i got into a few with my dads truck. so something that could take a few dings and dents becaust its going to happen. another thing-ONLINE CAR SHOPPING! you view cars online and deal with an internet rep. they get paid on a salary. not comission so they'll help you find a car that fitsyour need.

Uj5kuzoJaa	A lot of "looking good" is about health. They probably get enough sleep at night, drink tons of water (can help with acne) and more often than not they have the money and time to keep up that maintanence. They probably get up hella early to get ready for the day and have many bathroom trips throughout to touch up their look. They probably can afford a good dye job on their hair and the good shampoo to keep it up|`|u7o75zipaa	It's probably their confidence that makes them appear attractive.  Just style your hair in the morning and it'll look fine.  If you suffer from zits try a good facial wash like clearasil.  Get your eyebrows waxed if you like.  Most importantly.. CONFIDENCE. If you don't have it, fake it.|`|1aSrTpbhaa	Aww honey this makes me a little bit sad.  I know it may seem hard, but really you need to focus on what's on the inside.  They may seem perfect, but I'm pretty sure that there are many people who think they are stuck up or something is wrong with them.  NOBODY is perfect, seriously.  There's nothing wrong with a little makeup and a clear complexion though, so try some eyeliner and lipgloss, and find the right face cleansers.  If you feel pretty, then you'll probably have more confidence and people will want to be more like you.|`|OsH2JR9oaa	They use a lot of makeup, especially cover up. They eye brows they either do themselves or they have done at a salon place. Same with the hair too. There are a lot of hair products that help control your hair, such as smoothing cremes to control frizz and give a nice shine. Hair irons will straighten your hair if it's really curly or puffy.    I'm sure there's plenty more that you can do, but being a guy I don't know as much. We just wake up and walk out the door after a quick shave and brush.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	Ha. You should see them without make up and without hair straighteners! would be a whole different story then aye? My boyfriend says I always look the most beautiful au-naturel in the morning, and I guess your waaaay more prettier than those girls, just cos they look perfect,behind the mask they are just... below average:)|`|YgPYv4OPaa	they probably spend alot of time in the morning getting ready . and they probably get their eyebrows done at a salon .     dont try to copy them though , theyll probably get annoyed and start rumors or something .   :]|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	Well first of all, its all makeup hun.  Cover up, Foundation, Eyeliner, Eyeshadow, and Lipgloss.  If you want the clear skin you need to wash your face twice a day and add lotion without oil.  It really depends on your type of hair but usually you can go to a salon and get their cut. Their hair stays nice because of all the product thats in it.  Its really their overflowing self confidence. Theres really nothing special about them. But as we all know girls like to look as good as they can so if you want to be like them go ahead. Its your life.  Just experiment with make-up and take a mirror and brush to school.  Dont over do it though cause you will end up failing everything. :)|`|xqan4ChSaa	y? just becuz they look hot doesnt mean you have 2 b just kidding just try hard ok?|`|58jwkbbSaa	Well, i'm sure it takes a lot of work on their part to look this good.   For flaws on your face, wash your face twice a day everyday, and use moisturizer afterwards even if your skin is oily. & exfoliate every 3 days. Use primer before applying makeup, it makes your skin look really smooth.   & Try using makeup that plays up your features (: Pluck your eyebrows to get rid or stray hairs, but be sure not to make them too thin! As for hair, definitely straighten it unless you have naturally gorgeous curls. Use heat protectant to get rid of frizz, and buy a GOOD straightener. I prefer CHI, they're amazing.   Hope I helped, &Good luck girl!|`|ljWqn7Zhaa	thick makeup, hair spray, hair salons and eyebrow waxes professionally (atleast that's how the 'perfect' girls around here do it)    just remember, looks arent everything, why not just look like you?|`|OP6zAOULaa	I used to think the same thing in high school. HOLY COW look at them. i didn't think i looked good at all. but i had an older sister to help me with all the tricks. all it takes is messing around with makeup and hair stuff. as to acne- try different cleaners and find one that works. but i grew out of that phase and now (i'm not trying to sound concieted) i feel comfortable to say i think i'm beautiful. and some days-HOT! you just need to get comfortable in your own skin|`|OeQbs95Naa	I was one of those girls in high school 2 years ago. I didn't understand why but people always said stuff like im so perfect no flaws and all that but i never saw what they see like i felt like i have so many imperfections yet my nickname was barbie and i was voted the most talked about girl it was even written in my year book. I just take care of myself as much as possible, always making sure that i look my best but still i never feel the way people describe me but it is a good feeling to be admired. My advice is to just love your body, care for it and respect it. Dont change who you are. Instead of waisting time on wishing you looked like some one else use that time to care for yourself and make yourself look beautiful. If you want more help from me just email me. You can find my email when you click on my icon and add me. Hope i helped. (everyone have  good qualities some just dont know it)|`|smFfcmYuaa	Get up hours before school to make yourself up, buy high class/cost beauty products, go to a beauty spa for treatment on a regular basis, see a reputable hair stylist every couple of weeks for years until your hair improves, spend your free time reading beauty magazines instead of studying, eat a diet low in animal products and processed foods (candy mostly) and high in leafy vegetables. Of course in order to look *perfect* even with those steps a person has to be born with a certain level of superficial beauty and into a family with a certain amount of money in the first place.    As usual my advice is that your time would better be spent learning math. The untold story of the current economic crisis is how trophy wives are being left with absolutely nothing now that their husbands have no jobs or money to support their vacuous lifestyles.    I am a fan of people in the world having good hair though so go ahead and find a better stylist and hair care products but in general the less you chemically treat your hair the more beautiful it will be.|`|fltNZu6eaa	There are girls like that at our school.    And they try really. really. really hard. I mean, they take straightners to school. How embarassing. All they do in lessons is check their makeup, and all they do they second they're out of lessons is run to the bathroom to check their hair.     And that's it.    You don't want to look like them. You have a life.    But take a small mirror , mini-brush and a compact into school with you if it makes you feel better and you can do LITTLE touch ups during the day. Don't focus too much on it though.    xx|`|65gLWAm7aa	spend more time in the moring to look better but u shouldnt let this bother u|`|Tgqji3lLaa	Why do you want to look like them?

As soon as you start maturing then you'll realize there is alot better things out there than looking 'perfect' I'm sure you've heard this before. But that's just my opinion|`|H6RnpYtXaa	Believe me, their self confidence is what makes them seem perfect to you.|`|mXyOxgCmaa	the harder they try to look good, the more imperfections they will see in their appearance.  seriously, don't let it bother you.|`|Kg7P7zOqaa	First, they most likely clean and moisturize their face every night. Then it's the make-up and hair product's they they use. If they are like the popular posy of the school they get their eye brows done together, and they maintain them.|`|DM96vgR5aa	if you hair goes frizzy then use john frieda collection Frizz-ease hair serum.  put 1 or 2 squirts of it in damp hair.  another thing you can do is after you have washed your hair and your still in the shower you can wash your hair with cold water. it eliminates frizz.    i don't know if that helps. but that is what i do with my hair, and it helps control the frizz|`|ULLRoTsVaa	ALOT of up keep!

Like ask who does their hair, or where they go to get their nails done etc...thats if they are nice..|`|NYwoG13Haa	If the 'perfect' girls at my school are anything to go by then I expect they plaster their faces with foundation and pluck their eyebrows so there's not much left of them!!! I reckon you look perfect just the way you are and shouldn't try to make yourself look like them - all that foundation will clog their pores and give them tons of zits sooner or later!!|`|AA10868740	You are your harshest critic. I am sure these other girls find things they don't like about them that you never notice, and they may not notice your flaws at all. Make sure you wash your face well (inexpensive clean and clear face wash works for me). Then use moisterizer to even out your skin. The key with eyebrows is to not overdo it. Sometimes the more you pluck, wax the worse it looks. Take off just a little to keep their natural shape. If you wear your hair straight invest in a good flatiron it will work wonders.|`|zRIDQraFaa	Okay don't say "perfect" because what girls think is pretty guys might think differently. Not only that but if they have to go out of their way to make themselves look "perfect" than they are obviously trying to compensate for something else whether its there looks, personality or insecurities.    You don't have to look "perfect" to be beautiful. All you have to do is be just a little cute and you'll catch a couple glances from guys.    Trust me if your beautiful your life doesn't become significantly better. Sure its nice to get attention, but the only way they can get confidence comes from that attention and they never can never build character.    I'm not saying all beautiful girls are like this, but its school so I would put money that these girls are like this. Just don't compare yourself to others and you'll be fine|`|G5GsVtBcaa	I bet you a pretty penny none of them came into this world looking like that! They probably spend lots of time working on themselves to be "perfect". As for the skin, i spend nearly 30 minutes each night washing and moustoriing my face to achieve clear break-out free skin. If you want to look like those girls you are going to have to work for it. but no matter what you are beautiful and you should love yourself.

And make sure she does not leave the house with the stuff on.|`|3906f43b843cc7c4980882fdeb0526a7aa	First not everything is animal tested.  Look for "no animal testing" on the label.  Second there are makeups made especially for youngsters that are more shine than color and age appropriate.  All department stores have them.  ------By the way,     Parents should always be watching their kids of course, but be extra extra careful when allowing young girls to wear makeup or dress up for dancing, talent shows, etc.  There are lots of sicko's out in the world who will target them because of how they look.|`|o1irBbeNaa	shes seven, if she starts wearing makeup now shes gonna have horrible skin by the time shes in her 20's. stick to chapstick

iYL37RfPaa	straighten them first, before the rest of your hair,  so the straighteners aren't as hot,  also when you straighten them, curl under!!    xo|`|cf4b2c89769e2fa8220e3e5f4b43c112aa	Just when you straighten them, start at the very top by the scalp and curl it under.|`|Sd0V2Sd9aa	As you straighten them, pull the straightener downwards and to the side of your face at the same time.  And try putting the heat on the straighter on low.
kOkrwUmgaa	search homemade conditioners on google. i did that once and found a lot but they took avacados and stuff which i didnt have. it also creeped me out having the idea of some of the things they suggest on my head. (mayonnaise, avacado, yogurt, etc.) i like the ones that are papaya and mango or something. its a brand. they smell delicious. and they are all natural.|`|cia9dLy3aa	well first make sure that you keep in your condidtioner for at least three minutes and you can put some in your hair after ward or just cut your hair off or dont straighten your hair as much|`|OOz5ox6aaa	i don't know about home made but garnier fructis is the best for splits|`|gqvvXknQaa	Vo5 Hot Oil|`|6Tx8Opmraa	The only way to get rid of Split ends is a trim, and Honestly, The only way to prevent them is a trim every 4-6 weeks...Conditioners and whatnot aren't really going to help you much.|`|2Ai3kWeDaa	Dove itense damage therapy
xoTzDLJ2aa	Wow 18... I would be like Oh my gosh!  But I don't lovee makeup, it just saves you for shows, performances and lookin good :)|`|gXrwqoTGaa	Like crap. Yeah I am a makeup addict but it is because of all of the acne marks on my face. And to make it worse my face is very oily which makes me look worse. The oiliness on my face makes me look much darker and like a monkey. I remember one day when I left my blot powder home, in the middle of the day my face got oily and someone asked if I had been outside in the sun a lot recently because my face looked darker (which happens when it gets oily).|`|jgti45eGaa	Eighteen! <br>  That's a little intense, don't you think?<br>  I started wearing eyeliner in grade six, and now I'm totally all out in it foundation, light base eyeshadow, mascara, liquid + pencil eyeliner etc.) But! I would be very MAD if I could not wear makeup, I don't know how I went through middle school without it :)|`|AA12367450	I'd be pretty happy. I feel ridiculous comparing my looks to some photoshopped model on the cover of a magazine considering her looks aren't even real. Most celebrities look pretty average without the 5 lbs of makeup.|`|owCzkhNRaa	then i would never come outside.<br>  but i think that i would try to consider my self pretty and boost my confidence.<br>  try to do something with your hair so you look pretty even without makeup.|`|c5LNo5Mxaa	fine. i dont wear it everyday and i don't NEED it. and everyone would feel like that cus we would have no knowledge of it.|`|BTAcwiMIaa	I would feel very ugly. :/ aha.|`|PDYiwb3Raa	I'd be fine because I don't even use or need it! : )|`|JCG36VRVaa	i wouldnt know any different<br>  <br>  since it had never been invented i would just be used to being natural|`|6ORP9P06aa	I would die without my eye makeup D':<br>  & Your mom is trippen, lol.|`|7JDuae2Laa	I would be unconfortable, make up ( I don't use it very much ) makes me feel more self-confident.|`|gipfVShsaa	I'd be okay with it. I have pretty clear skin so I have nothing I need to cover up. <br>  <br>  We also wouldn't have an unrealistic standard of beauty. Becuase the celebs we compare ourselves to cake that **** on.|`|oquBKA4naa	It probably wouldnt be bad. Animals wouldnt be tested on and girls wouldnt feel bad about their looks from the makeup ads in magazines. Peoples faces would probably be less broken out, and in some peoples case (drag queens,people who put so much on its scary and what not) it would make them better looking without makeup. Also you would never feel self concious about your makeup or face looking bad because no one would have makeup on either. Now that I realize it, the world without makeup wouldnt be so bad afterall. hahaha|`|Gslf19Uvaa	I would be sad :(<br>  I think makeup is so much fun...I love art, and that's pretty much what makeup is to me lol. I'm an eyeliner junkie...<br>  But then again, if we never knew it, than I might be ok. People might be a little less fake...<br>  I'm 15 by the way.|`|YL8tTemwaa	I wouldn't know... I wouldn't know what it was like to have it if it didn't exist!|`|iRqhkfJtaa	I WOULD KILL MYSELF!!!!!!!!!11<br>  JK BUT IT WOULD BE SOOOOO DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH@!!!
jv0O4pjhaa	i can see that nobody answered this question properly yet, so here i go.    i am an avon rep and salesleader which means i am also recruiting people to become reps all over the uk.    how it works    the avon brochure comes out every 3 weeks, as a rep you show the brochures to friends, family or people at work etc. or you could even work in your local neighboorhood.  by dropping books to neighboors leave them for 3-4 days and then go back to collect them plus any orders.    you then submit the order and once it arrives you take them to YOUR customers collect money + pay avon and earn yourself between 20-25% on your sales e.g. a total sale of 200 would give you 50 for yourself just by showing the books around.    its flexible a you work from home and choose your own hours plus it free to try.    i have 2 young kids myself and it fits perfectly around our family life as i do my avoning when hubby is back from work.    i am constantly looking for new reps all over the uk so to find out more or to apply visit my website.    www.myavon.co.uk/azaduhi|`|so0NgwHjaa	If a avon rep, is what i think it is,then here is how it works. My friends mum is one. She gets given like 10 catalouges, that she hands out to people in her area, they(people who get given catalouges) fill out order slips of all the items they want then the avon rep, comes and collects them(slips&catalouges) a week or two later, and they send them away to avon, which then add the amount of money that the customers are spending say they spen like 60 you'd get like half of it, or like a third. Hope i helped(:  xx|`|o298GAKcaa	they come to your house to drop it off they give you a couple of days to choose wat u want then they come back and it takes bout 2 weeks|`|95f9fbd65bd5cca87e4b843390b3468eaa	No I'm not but go to their website and they should have all the details on there.|`|v2CwKFDMaa	idk but my cousins friend is :)    answer mine?  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|GM3zog4Jaa	Go to their website here:  http://www.uk.avon.com/PRSuite/home_page...  Click on the NEED A REPRESENTIVE? (on the left hand side)    Fill in the form & they will contact you about your nearest representative.  The rep will contact you or you contact her & arrange a time to meet.  She will come & drop off a ctalogue for you to browse through.  When you have decided what you want, you fill out the form that comes with the catalogue with your items.  You give that to your rep, she will return with your goods & you pay for them upon collection.

sHUnctqIaa	Urban Decay primer potion is there best product hands down, although I like a lot of there products, my fave shadow is Midnight Cowboy rides again, and it looks awesome with there 24/7 eye liner pencil in Bourbon. I LOVE there eye liners, there the only kind I use. They stay on great and come in some wicked colors. I also like there big fatty mascara. The only product I really dislike from them is there Lip Venom, it stings too much I can't use it.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I like the primer and the eyeshadows.  Even the primer alone can make non-brand name shadows really stand out and look awesome! ^-^|`|AaYEgDwWaa	There shadows and the deluxe shadows and the primer potion and the blush in Quicke|`|IIpEaDCcaa	Urban Decay Primer Potion, I haven't really tried any products from them, except for a lipgloss set.

But yeah, get the primer - it's phenomenal!|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	I love them ALLLL!|`|MpqIrZJNaa	I used to use their Primer potion, but it's kinda thick for me & I prefer using Too-faced shadow insurance instead.

It doesn't smudge at all and I also believe that it is waterproof =]|`|3a5e13c07c94d0964ad8dc45cd9ead0daa	I can swear by their primer potion, their 24/7 liners come in the richest colors I've seen yet, and their eyeshadows are amazing I love almost everything they make :]|`|xU3uBy4Saa	There is no such thing as a favorite with Urban Decay!

I couldn't purchase it though because Sephora was out!
EVzw4l1aaa	I went to the beach for a week over the summer and I got so dark. I'm naturally fair skinned and I still got crazy tan. I don't burn that easily so I just used a tanning oil with like spf 15 everyday. And after you get home, keep your tan by moisturizing a lot and maybe lay out once or twice a week to keep it up for a while.|`|J2iPVt1Laa	i useed http://www.hairproducts.com/showimage.ph... in californiaa on the beachh i tanned for like 4 dayss and i wass soo dark  people thought i fake baked i only laid out for two hours a day!    try that stuff i bought it at my resortt but im think i seen it at walmartt!|`|8qeDEWWJaa	Are you talking about laying out or going to a tanning salon? If you are going to a tanning salon DO NOT use baby oil in the beds it makes the acrylics crack. If you are laying out yeah you can use baby oil. It depends on how high the UV rays are for that day! You should check weather.com for that area to see. If you lay out even day you could get a sun burn so be careful!! Pace yourself =]|`|wbIEau0qaa	go to your local tanning salon|`|GfMRewh7aa	dont use any bottle tans , no matter what you'll turn orange, fake annn bakee! i do it an it the best, its about 20 bucks a month then every time you go it 5 . not to bad but its the only way to get a full tan . =]

Your very cute.|`|j3g5UapGaa	i really really like your hair i say keep it like that and i would rate you a 8|`|UCKAiLN1aa	You are pretty. I suggest a short haircut to make a contrast between a sweet face and a bold haircut. Something really short. :)|`|OeQbs95Naa	Here are some tips...    Hair- id say you should go shorter and add some darker color to your hair. A fringe will really compliment your face shape. something like this...   http://celebhairstyle.files.wordpress.co...    http://www.beautifulhairstyles.com/magaz...    and maybe use colors like these...  http://roblucassalon.files.wordpress.com...    This will bring out the color of your eyes more.   If you do decide to get a cut like that a Straightener and a hair dryer will be needed because your hair is wavey.     Face- Use some foundation and a light bronzer to even out your skin tone and hide the flaws, also get some mascara LOreal is really good its what i use then add a bit of color to your lips light glossy colors will be great. Here is an example...   http://styletips101.com/wp-content/uploa...    Dress- Colors like pinks,blues, greens and whites will look really pretty on you. Wear something more flattering, with more color instead of a dull full cover shirt that makes you look unconfined and shy.   Here i made you a poluyvore set. http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=62996...  Hope this helps and good luck =)|`|Kg7P7zOqaa	In this picture it looks oily.

As for styling do as you wish.|`|fltNZu6eaa	Your cute... maybe a fringe?    xx|`|kQ6x5Mokaa	based on that pic I'd say an 8 cause your face is pretty and your body looks to be good although you might be a few pounds underweight, but ur hot so... hair idk maybe straighten it and grow it out?|`|SzZxgHdtaa	You are definitely on the pretty side of average.  If you are not pretty then I must be a monster    I'd say a 7|`|2v60zG5Faa	7 out of ten ure pretty but ure pout looks a little trout pout ish lmao ur ehair looks fine maybe straighten it or umm i dunno maybe oull it up in a pony x|`|SC3jqHZCaa	....4|`|Lzk24WGcaa	My sincere opinion is that you are very beautiful.  Any guy would be lucky to be your bf|`|IARQmZjVaa	8|`|LdJHh00qaa	I would straighten your hair. Personally I think wavy to curly hair is very hard for girls to pull off. I really only like it on a select few. That's just my personal opinion though.  I would also go for some side bangs. It would look really nice. Surprisingly your very pretty considering most girls who post pics on here do so because they aren't, have a low self esteem and therefore want others to tell them how good they look. Your certainly one of the exceptions. I wouldn't worry to much, your still young but I can tell in a couple of years you will look 3 times better for sure. I would give you an 8, and in a couple of year a 9 - 10. Your really cute.
ALI7xvcHaa	not s short as Selena has it but that same style would look great.|`|a5rUvtjSaa	Get Selena Gomez's hairstyle it would look really cute on you, and it would suit your face!!!|`|E6W5TRZKaa	I really like the Selena Gomez hairstyle! Its really cute and fun, but the only thing is its just shorter and angled so you probably get sick of it pretty fast. I dont really like the last one though. Get the selena one :)|`|rY75BRp1aa	Heyy, i think a cute hair style that would look good on you is the hair style selena has is very nice and would totally work for you!! =)|`|y2O1D8q7aa	definatly get the selena gomez haircut! it would frame your face really well!<br>  <br>  and your really pretty!|`|MaA5cWzwaa	You would look gorgeous with selena's cut.<br>  definitely that one.|`|B4nujMnlaa	Selena's hair would look PERFECT on you!!! :)|`|TtGP5bC2aa	i like Selena's hair. but if you want to stay long, I'd go with the last one. but i really like your hair now! if you think it's plain, why not get highlights or cut you bangs? i think that you should dye it a chocolaty brown and put caramel colored highlights. it would go nice with your eye color. or, with your hair color, you wouldn't need to dye it at all.<br>  <br>  if your looking for the edgy look, like in the last picture, put some weird colors in your hair, like red or reddish purple. or blue! or your favorite color. lol|`|AwXDBoASaa	the first selena gomez hairstyle would go best with you face.|`|apHtbAgqaa	your hair looks pretty much the same as Selena's...
c969a0205149b08a90d1b4dbabd1a38daa	I lean more towards natural, day to day. But if you know how to pick out the makeup and wear it so it isn't too obvious that's usually cool too.|`|ZXlzOVRbaa	Well.. a little doesn't hurt.<br>  But I'm fond of girls having the natural look..|`|ClnSGIS4aa	does it matter what guys think? there just ridiculos if they are even bothered about it. I can under stand orange faces, white necks but if its alot but nicely put together, then whats the fuss ? <br>  if they loved you or meaned anything to you then they have to realise that you want to wear makeup wether they like it or not.<br>  makeup is only makeup. <br>  theres other things to worry about, just do what you like!<br>  i love wearing makeup and probably wear too much but if it makes me feel happier why not? lol makeup is my best friend =P|`|xHdbDMJTaa	It depends..<br>  some men prefer make up,<br>  but some don't.<br>  The key,if you wanna go either way,<br>  is simplicity.<br>  if your wearing make up,don't overdo it with eyeshadow,shimmer powder....bla bla bla..that will just remind us of a drag queen/our grandma's(to a certain degree.)<br>  if your going natural,<br>  at least put some lip gloss..<br>  that would make it look like you put in an effort,and you would look very kissable... =)|`|3b28FoTfaa	All natural, maybe just some lipgloss.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	I've had my son's name on me for about a year and it's been fine! The whole 'curse of the name tattoo' theory only applies to partners - the curse being that couples always seem to split up shortly after tattooing their names. Probably coincidence but that's the theory - well your son can't exactly split from you can he! Go for it, it's a great idea, and good luck! :-)|`|WLuEIwp5aa	My kids' names would be the only ones I would even think about having tattooed on me, to be honest.|`|ALC0oqWyaa	It's only "bad luck" to have a partner's name tattooed on you because unfortunately there are no guarantees when if comes to romantic relationships.  It won't break up a relationship, it's just not a great idea.<br>  As for your son's name, it wouldn't be "bad luck" at all.  He will always be your son, and he bears the name you chose for him, so I think you should go for it!|`|AN2svreQaa	Tattoos of childrens names is all I will tattoo...I will not do any other names such as boyfriends, girlfriends, husbands, or wifes....and no its not bad luck...I have my daugthers name worked into my sleeve...her name is done with bamboo lettering...shes my child and that will never change.....|`|k4J9f9U9aa	your child is always going to be your child. some people are just REALLY superstitious. i would say, go for it. nothing bad is going to happen because you have your child's name tattooed on you.|`|Kru3PZbkaa	The only names that are safe to tattoo on yourself are your children's and your parents'  or grandparents'.  It's not bad luck at all.  Go for it!!|`|PwBrJMp3aa	of course its not bad luck its only superstition! your son means a lot to you it can't be bad luck! I'm getting my first tattoo tomorrow as well!|`|9P0r7Qbaaa	Bad luck would be if the tattoo artist would mess up...<br>  It's just superstition.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps!

e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	I think because they took more time to look that way.  Women were raised to be ladies so they were more glamourous back then.|`|3RzBPDSXaa	Women in the sixties weren't consumed with hair and make up and cloths.  The sixties were the time in American history where natural and spontaneous you, were all the rage.  Anything that made you feel pretty was the look.  Women took full advantage of that, and came up with looks that felt good.  That is the key to beautiful.  Because beautiful does come from the inside, and it's a feeling that pours out of a girls personality.|`|YTasscmKaa	Its the natural look, the long hair. Lovely.|`|W76VDFKCaa	Because they were natural!!! They did not need a ton of makeup, hair products, plastic surgery, etc to make they feel beautiful.

gqvvXknQaa	Too bad sweetie... I love bright red hair! If you try to dye it lighter, then the color will become a brighter red. Go to a beauty supply store and ask the girls there what products will safely take out the color from your hair. And tell them about the strawberry blonde you'd like to go. They are very helpful and the advice is free. They can show you a wide variety of products. Good luck and hope it turns out good.|`|200afe35d45dea8a4192b6e0e30ed767aa	Try highlights and making it a mix of brown or blonde. It should take it down to a more natural red color. I wouldn't suggest stripping it, it really messes up the health of your hair and makes it brittle and such.|`|jy52NZEjaa	stripping it will turn it orange.  like pumpkin spice orange.  haha      but! here is what you do.  and listen to me cloesly, i know this sounds insane, but its what hair salons do.      either a.) try finding a blonde hair dye thats blue based.  you cant find that at the grocery store, so good luck.    OR    b.) get blue hair dye. put it your hair.  leave it in for a max of 2 minutes.  then wash it out.    it should tone down the red A LOT.|`|pNOx7vD6aa	well having it bright red makes you look like you got in a fight with hair dye and the hair dye won. It doesn't look natural and makes you look immature. Stripping your hair is probably the WORST thing you can do to your hair! You should probably try to bleach it out as much as possible but try avoidind stripping it! you will regrete it major! I honestly think you should go strawberry blonde :) with your light skin you should go lighter because the darker your hair is....is only going to make you look even paler.......|`|oSPT8dnaaa	WOW well striipping it WILL RUIN UR HAIR COMLPLETLY! but maybe u could bleach it then dye it again?!??!!?! idk if that would ruin ur hair to...actually just dye it over that dye.i knew someone who did that. her sis messed up 3 times so just dye over that 1!

xreWOKBYaa	Sounds like it's infected. Take the piercing out, let it heal for at least a month, then get it re pierced and take better care of it this time! Clean 3 times daily with saltwater only.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I had the same problem with mine! You might want to try Bactene. It's a disinfectant made for piercings. You also might have an allergy to the metal in the post that you are wearing. I had to switch to titanium instead of stainless steel. Titanium or 18K gold should help if it's a metal allergy. Mine never swelled after the switch.|`|8cLLhDrfaa	some people are just more exposed to get infections.  deal with it.|`|ffdf225d9f6c6bf94ed4f57553ac0e7daa	Uhh....

Not the shiny stuff you get at walmart. It sounds liek to me that you may be sensitive to what your wearing in it. call some peircing shops and ask where they recomend getting nose rings for sinsitve skin...(if infection isnt the problem) thats the same problem i had with mine and i was finnaly able to obtain one that doent swell me up. im not sure where i got it but stay away from gold, and silver plated.... and stop putting chemicals in it lol.. cleaning the ring and the area with water should be enough....|`|9eouWphjaa	Get rid of the nose ring|`|tAYuDzuqaa	try antibiotics..might be an infection.|`|LpDGxOD4aa	Are you allergic to the jewelry?  Have you tried a different type?  If what you are currently using has nickle in it then that may be your problem.  Try the Bio-Flex (some call it Bio-Plastic) or titanium - they are nickle free.
CHCPnvksaa	If you have curly hair, you definitely want to get it layered. It will add so much volume and bring out the highlights. Highlights won't ruin your hair as long as you take good care of it. No Suave or anything like that. Sunsilk Hydra TLC is awesome and inexpensive. I highlight my hair religiously, and I have to admit I have great hair. For a pic, google images for Beyonce's hair. Most of the time, she's a layered wavy brunette with gold highlights|`|6Ss31wyBaa	Talk to your hair stylist about what you want. They know what is good and bad for your hair, as well as how to achieve volume and the look you want.|`|jXblvTG0aa	get a treatment done and trim your ends every 6 - 8 weeks!|`|OGckGQePaa	i think the highlights youre getting might be too extreme for your colored hair, but what i do for volume, is brush it up at the top    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|vDHKYLlraa	i dont think you should highlight your hair. personally, i dont like any kind of fake highlights. and if you already have them natural, you should leave it like that. the more you do things to your hair, the crappier it gets. you should use the sunsilk shampoo that adds volume if you want more volume for your hair. or you can put the anti-poof garnier fructis thing right after you get out of the shower and then blow dry your hair upsidedown. or straighten it then tease it.|`|HbmHRiwLaa	honestly, the best thing to do for thin hair is layers, multi colored dye job, and curling or crimping.  my mother has very thin blonde hair.  so she gets it layered, dyes the underneath really dark brown, and most times she uses those crimpers that have like three irons on one.  looks sooo awesome!!    hope this helps!|`|jiGE97cNaa	french fries|`|kTF3kKBKaa	Get your hair trimmed every few weeks. You'd be amazed what a few millimeters off your ends will do to help volumize your hair :-) Highlights won't ruin your hair as long as you don't get them too often or your hair isn't naturally brittle.
gqvvXknQaa	Pantene Pro-V has a line of products for dried/damaged hair. It works great!|`|OOz5ox6aaa	I like aussie and head and sholders.  There's also john frieda(a little more expensive) wich works great even if u don't have dyed hair.  Also try a leave in conditioner from garnier fructis (put in everyday after showering)  and a deep conditioner. use it every month once for 20 mins.|`|iuQ2DBoyaa	herbal essences -- moisture works kind.

1ZfFSH6maa	i have mine done, i got it about a month ago.  there is no right place to have the piercing placed. as long as it is in that general area, it is considered a monroe piercing (or as you keep calling it, marilyn)  but i DO think that he has pierced yours too low on your lip. it should NOT be catching on your teeth (mine catches on my gums sometimes and THAT is ok) but catching on your teeth is potentially dangerous.   i know that the bar does have to be long for the first like 2 months but it should not be that low to begin with, so that is not an excuse for it being so low or catching on your teeth.   if i were you i would call up the place, tell them it is catching on your teeth and it has gotten dangerous [you could always say you have almost pulled the whole bar out, even if that has not happened (although it could so be careful!)] and ask if they could please re pierce it  i wouldnt suggest saying anything like they messed up because they may get defensive and say no.   just stay calm and good luck!!  :) :)

So I really don't think you'll be able to do it at 15 without parents consent, sorry :(|`|5C2B23Qnaa	i dont think so. i think you will need an adult with you.    hope i helped|`|5WO9cczKaa	I live in the UK and I seem to think that for body piercing you can be pretty much any age if you're accompanied by an adult & 16 or 18 unaccompanied...  They'll probably ask for ID if you look young and are on your own...    You could just go in and ask how old you need to be...    Good luck :] x|`|AaYEgDwWaa	Were mostly in the I.US sooo i know here you need a parent and if you go alone they will ask for ID and you MUST be 18 and older|`|ezMoS0mqaa	No reputable piercer will pierce a minor, parents there or not. You will be asked for ID and when they see you are under 18 you will be turned away.  If you are over 16 they MAY allow it if you have a parent with you.

jxRooBhUaa	i have an anti-tragus as well and since it's a thick piece of cartilage, it's going to be a very tricky healing process.  i suggest not using cream because they can end up irritating the piercing rather than speed up its healing. always stick to a long titanium piece of jewelry just in case swelling begins.   as for pain management, i reccomend ibuprofen, its decreases intensity of pain and swelling. tea tree oil has also worked wonders for me in the past for infections; just apply it once a day since it tends to be very drying :/  you sound like you're doing okay. just be patient, sea salt soaks work slowly but surely because they draw out possible infections from the piercing and soothes it.     i wish you the best of luck with your anti-tragus.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Any ear cartilage is going to be sore for quite a long time. 3 months is not unheard of, especially if you have had problems. They can take up to a year to heal.    Discharge is normal as long as it's clear, white or yellowish white. If it's green, that is a sign of infection.     How strong is your salt water solution? it shouldn't be any more than 1/4 tsp sea salt to 8 oz water. Any stronger will irritate the piercing. Make sure your salt is not iodized as this can irritate the piercing as well.
IA5SuFkdaa	honestly if your pale chances are your just going to burn, and pale people dont get tan no matter how much tanning you go they end up getting pink and red...      stick to natural beach tanning :)|`|NCl7B7diaa	If you are really pale the professionals will probably only let you in for 5 mins. They probably wouldnt recommend a lotion at first because they inhance your tan and will cause you to burn more easily with your pale skin.   prevent sunburn??? by not going or going a short amount of time|`|S4a3sYumaa	Just build up gradually, maybe 10mins first day, then 15 the next and build up gradually!  Don't use tanning oil until you have built up your tan first, its really good for going darker after a base is built, it would be safer to use normal sun cream and you really shouldn't burn!  I find this one amazing, we got a really amazing tan from this! and no burning!     Best sun cream/stuff ever :  http://www.johnlewis.com/jl_assets/produ...  ~    Hope i helped;   :)
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	When you had it removed did your doctor tell you it was a keloid or a hypertrophic scar?     If you've had keloids before, there is a pretty good chance that you could get them again. However, hypertrophic scars are far more common and would develop due to the irritation and allergic reaction from wearing cheap ear rings.    If you decide to get re-pierced, make sure you get it done at a proper piercing studio with a needle. This will dramatically reduce your chances of scar tissue. They will also use quality jewelry that your skin should not react to.     For more details on piercing guns vs needles:  http://www.articlefit.com/Dangers-of-Pie...    As for your daughter. Personally I don't think it's right to pierce such a young child, but it's your choice. If you decide to have her ears pierced, please get them done properly, not with a gun.|`|2tnXJmfkaa	yeah repiercing your ears is fine  i had mine repierced about 2 months ago  and its fine. As for 3 month old daughter  im not so sure. Children like to fiddle with things  so she might get her ear infected while she was  pulling at the earing. Also babies with  pierced ears really isnt a good look they are   just too young let them make the decision when  they are old enough.|`|2Ys29djAaa	I too have keloid skin, had a "titi" on my ear also, the second hole, i had it removed, dr warned never pierce the ear again or it will most likely grow back larger than the original. for my daughter i put stickers for your fingernails, nail art, diamonds, gold hearts etc, although i eventually pierced her ears, so far no keloids!!!!!!!!!, good luck|`|LpDGxOD4aa	If you are going to do it again have it done in a piercing studio not Wal-Mart or Claire's.  The use of hollow piercing needle & removing the flesh is "said" to help lower your chances of developing keloids; unlike a piercing gun that just causes the flesh to explode into itself.  After that stay away from cheap jewelry.  I do not recommend using a gun for any piercing...they cause nothing but problems (ever notice the knots that develop around the piercings?) & the fact that the gun cannot be properly sterilized doesn't help either.  So with that being said...No, you should not pierce your 3 month old's ears.  Not only because she will more than likely end up with an infection from touching them but also no reputable shop will touch her at that age; so that only leaves you the option of a gun @ Wal-Mart.

AA10036540	The brand may not mean as much as what type of metal the earring is.  It may take a while to see which metal works.  I can only wear gold and silver earrings only.  Any costume will cause a rash.  I can't wear the hypo allergenic kind either.|`|0vfX40Qxaa	Most people who are sensitive to metals are allergic to Nickel,  get Surgical Steel backs and you should be ok.  I have known people who were allergic to many other metals as well and could only wear gold.  Titanium should be ok as well if you can find it.|`|msd2cl5vaa	It's not so much the brand name, but the type. Gold & Sterling Silver are the best types to wear if you have sensitive ears. Try to clean your ear piercings twice a day using a Q-Tip and rubbing alcohol. It will help keep them clean, and free from infection.|`|ylDHOIp1aa	my wife gets bad reactions when she get earings so we went with sterling silver only it is also least costly then gold and more stylish|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Stay away from the cheap ones. Surgical stainless steel, or 24k gold.|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	I have the same problem.  I cant wear any brand though.  I have to wear real gold.
y39iNwFjaa	Take it back to wherever you bought it from - your contract is with them not the manufacturer.|`|FmqKsvuJaa	Your best bet would be to take it back to wherever you bought it, and say you want it to be exchanged because it's defective, or give you a refund.     If that doesn't work out, go to a fabric or craft store, buy a new zipper, and ask someone who works there for help on how to sew in the new zipper. People at sewing stores are usually very enthusiastic about helping customers and could probably help you fix it very easily and cheaply.     There is also this, it's a zipper fix-it kit, and supposedly it's very good, and under $10:    http://www.joann.com/joann/catalog.jsp?C...    Good luck! :)|`|XqIqz52Paa	its from the cocoa companyy.

Plus the fact that although nearly every girl on the planet lives in it - you rarely see some1 in the same thing as you or wearing it in the same style.    My fav online shop is Asos.com for the same reasons and that both shops offer cheap clothes but also offer the more expensive ranges for when your feeling more flush|`|4o9CxQOLaa	Topshop or New Look as the prices are reasonable, and they have a wide selection of clothing!|`|dsxDysQZaa	Hot Topic baby... they always have cute goth clothes. i love them.|`|UZXfHWGRaa	I like river island and bank because there both great shops and have loverly designer clothesand accessrories x|`|VIFxtHdPaa	Aeropostale and Hottopic|`|z0Wkh9hDaa	Topshop and River Island, the clothes are all really nicely styled and good quality :)    I see some nice stuff in primark but if you get it then you quite often see someone else wearing the same thing which is really embarrassing so i don't tend to buy from there anymore, except from the accessories are good teamed with clothes from different shops :)|`|zon13nY2aa	Topshop because the clothes are fashionable, they fit me really well and most of the stuff isn't too pricey.    Primark is great for basic tshirts and cardigans.    I like Harvey Nichols because they're the only place near me that sells Juicy Couture which is my favourite brand - I love their tracksuits and jewellery.    x|`|84crzC80aa	That's quite a tough question!

Truth be told you pay cheap prices therefore you get cheap things but they're pretty good.    There's also this shop near me called ZZ's and they have so much nice stuff! If I had loads of money, I'd choose there to go on a spending spree.|`|aa35e095a615d2c9fa9251d229a3968aaa	Mine is an online shop called syren.

3a5e13c07c94d0964ad8dc45cd9ead0daa	No I don't think you are. As long as you keep it light and natural, you'll be fine. Remember, the point of makeup isn't to create a new face, it's to enhance the natural beauty you already have. Also, try to play up one part of your face at a time, not all of them at once. If one day you want to go a little bolder with the eyeshadow or eyeliner, don't put on much lip gloss or blush, and vice versa.     I've been wearing makeup since I was 14 (with permission from my mother) and she'd only let me start off with powder based foundation, a little eyeshadow and mascara. As I got older though, I could do a little more and play around with it. I'm 17 now and wearing makeup is just another way for me to express myself, and it's really fun :).     I hope this helps you :D.|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	no it doesn't sound like too much. just dont go for the whole "I want to be a raccoon" look..thats not good on anyone!|`|2e16f4a446bcc1c4a776329047757ddbaa	ehh depends as longs as its in moderation..  im fifteen half the time just wear eyeliner.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	Yeah it sounds like too much for school you probably don't need it|`|MIILkAR4aa	thats alittle to much  my sister is older and doesnt wear that much|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	Nahh. I know a lot of people that wear the same as you.  I have freshman friends and some wear way more.    Max Factor Foundation.|`|so0NgwHjaa	Thats, basically what i wear, but i go really heavy on the mascara,its a must do, kinda thing, big mascara's good, & im 13, and use to wear all that when i was 12, so dont worry bout it, xx|`|Ly20pGC9aa	you do NOT wear to much make up.  oh and for foundation,  benefit, mac or lancome are a must.|`|ueR1rVo6aa	heck no!   im only in 7th grade an di wear all of those except i wear eyeliner all the time but i wear gray instead of black|`|wqtwzzPeaa	It depends on how much you apply and how well you apply it. A makeup job can either look really good or really bad, personally, I never use eyeliner because it makes my eyes look racoon-y. It doesn't sound like you use too much, as long as you don't cake it on.|`|yVMGqyIwaa	yes thats too much  i'm 14 also and if a gal wore that much here we'd call her a whore|`|xqan4ChSaa	um your 2 young 2 wear makeup young lady|`|pXTUMTdEaa	the only thing i would kip out on would be the blush and only use it for special occasions, otherwise it is perfectly fine :)|`|WLZFuBVBaa	it depends if you always do touch up... when i was in freshman i only wear light foundation lipstick/lipgloss and eyeliner...|`|o1irBbeNaa	nah i dont think so, thats what i  wear but i always wear eyeliner. i use bobby brown make up, its expensive but its light and doesnt make me break out.|`|2JZ9vzMMaa	no, as long as it's done subtly, that's what i wear. bare minerals is the best by far|`|dBAuX8hwaa	Well to be honest you dont need blush.  Use natural colours for school & then go wild with colour on the weekends.  Make sure you have the right tone of foundation. The foundation I would reccomend would be the "Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse". It lasts all day and is VERY good.    =]|`|W8gSKNzdaa	tbh i dont think its over the top unless your putting loads of each thing on. maybe if your not going anywhere special dont bother with the lipgloss and eyeliner, and make sure your foundation matches your skin tone perfectly so it looks natural. thats all i can suggest really it doesnt sound like your doing much wrong to me lol xxx|`|JMEghB3Zaa	nope as long as it looks natural thats fine!|`|wu89UJtxaa	not at all i were a little less than that but thats only because i need to get more :)
98NiEivhaa	Your question always draws negative answers here... people get off on trolling to be able to be negative I think.  I'm self taught, all with stuff off ebay to boot.  And have nothing but top notch fine work.  step 1, buy A-Z tattooing by huck spaulding and read it 2 or more times... forget the needle making crap though, it doesn't pay off, you can buy premade and presterilized needles for like 30 cents a piece, and same for grips/tips... go for everything disposable... I have no reason to need an autoclave because everything that could be autoclaved... gets thrown away and never reused.  if you buy a kit type thing, don't forget to get stencil paper, transfer solution, green soap, presterilizer, and rubber gloves... that stuff doesn't come in the kits.  read the book, then buy your stuff, i even got the book from ebay|`|oX9hnJV1aa	Jeez...

You know nothing about the art of tattooing, you called the machine a gun, know nothing about ink, needles, and sterilization techniques or machines.  If you want to do it, please do it right.  Tattooing isn't like outlining a picture then coloring it in, there's much more to it than you could ever expect.|`|2SzYXPrHaa	Are you doing an apprenticeship?  It seems that the person apprenticing you would tell you that...    If not, the world does not need any more scratchers putting out shamefully ugly tattoos and spreading diseases.  Thanks.    Edit:  and it's a machine, not a gun.

WLuEIwp5aa	It's 18g, all those idiotic piece of crap piercing guns use 18g studs.  I suggest getting a hoop, personally.  The kind where the part that goes through your ear is a little smaller and then the hoop part is a tube and the part going through your ear just pops right in the hoop are the best.  Nothing sticking out to poke you at all.<br>  <br>  If you ever want to get your other side pierced, be safer and go get it done with a needle, okay?|`|hQ6ZqHjzaa	You wanna go to a proper piercing place and ask them for a barbell, they don't look very unique, but they are comfortable and there are no sharp bits. I'm pretty sure you can get coloured ones too. Also make sure its make of titanium or stainless steel.<br>  <br>  You wanna be careful with hoops, I started out with a barbell and (stupidly) changed to a hoop and my cartilage started to heal to the shape of the hoop, and then it tried to reject and stuff, it was painful. <br>  <br>  Also, wait at least six months before changing the earring, that was my first mistake, changed mine after 2 months, and it just completely messed up the healing process because the exit wound from the needle hadn;t healed up completely.

Just make sure  to get all of it out after, or you'll look like you have major dandruff =)  Another thing you can do is, if you have it, use dry shampoo.|`|oOzNMiKtaa	You could wash it in the morning before school and wear it in a wet, sloppy bun to school.

Or maybe you should try to squeeze in time to wash your hair.|`|7wlgFBacaa	Just pull it back into a ponytail and hairspray it a little bit. Then if you still feel like it looks greasy just drop some casual comment while you are with your friends about "gosh, hairspray makes my hair look greasy.." so they won't think it is really grease.

Wavy, thick red hair is soooo pretty!  Don't get Frutice hair dye get like Clairol or Loreal.<br>  3. Don't get it thinned!!! It will thin on its own once it's dyed, trust me, it will even it out nicely since I got mine dyed and I have super thick hair too.<br>  4. Go messy some days, just don't do anything to it.  Other days braid it, other days staighten it.  Mix it up and have fun!|`|wJbaTS0Aaa	I also have super curly brown hair. Remember that when you cut curly hair, the end result will always be an inch or two shorter since the curls bunch up. So always ask for a cut a little longer than you actually want.  In my personal opinion, though, hair should be either really long or really short. That weird in-between length, like at the collar bone, is just boring. Be daring! Get a shorter cut.<br>  <br>  With light skin and blue eyes, I would go darker. It will really emphasize your eyes and make your skin look brighter. Go with a semi-permanent.<br>  <br>  Get your hair layered to take off some thickness. If you ask your hairstylist to thin it, they may "razor" your hair to take off some body.<br>  <br>  With a shorter cut, you could straighten it and use gel to make the layers edgy and fringe-y. Super cool. Or, with curly hair, take a shower the night before and throw some frizz-taming mousse in it. Then wake up beautiful!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bmoCpcdraa	I.yes you should definetly cut it to your collar bone but you could always go a few inches if you want remember no matter how you cut it  so if you dont like the way it ends up looking it will always grow back, so totally go for it <br>  2.scence your light brunett and you want your hair to look more defined instead of dieing it mabey consider streaks, higlights, or tips like in a golden blonde or a choclate brown colorif you do die it find hair dies that are all natural so they dont tear up your hair {3)dont be afarid to mix it up crimp it, curl it, straighten it ir put it in cutie little braids.just dont go to messy with jell because it leaves your hair looking greasy<br>  <br>  hope i have helped you out

6kVgsUveaa	Comb only when its damp, gently, with a wide-tooth comb.<br>  I suggest an Afro-comb.  Section your hair into small parts - 4 left/4right, & do them each gently & individually.  <br>  Don't pull downwards forcefully from the scalp but ease the comb inch by inch down the section of hair to the ends until all sections are complete.<br>  If this method continues to hurt you, then try using your fingers only to run through (thicker teeth than an Afro-comb).  Detangle gently & away ya go. Good Luck!|`|BiepGfSPaa	YES!! Absolutely.  You are tender headed.  Same as me.  It simply takes time.  Once you do it yourself long enough it no longer hurts.  I got through it easier by wetting my hair combing through, dry with a towel, and then I just combed it when its dry.  Combing it while its wet moves the hair around easier and gets through the naps and tangles.

You're already pretty! My few suggestions would be to try and improve your complexion, and choose colors that can really complement your eyes and smile (they're gorgeous!). Try seeing a dermatologist for some more information about how to clear up your skin and really make it radiant. By the way, I think that your fair skin really complements you so I wouldn't worry too much about a tan! As for making your eyes pop, I would try using some brown eyeshadows and some volumizing mascara to really boost your lashes. If you really want to push it another step, you could go a shade or two darker on your hair and then, Mam, I believe that you will be set. Remember though, let your confidence shine through because it's your real source of beauty!

Pick another hair style but don't go bald :)|`|9yMRbtK5aa	no, don't shave it! just get it cut to the point where it looks clean-cut. <br>  if you shave it, girls won't like that because it'll look like you think you're cool. i'm not saying you will look like that, but that's how most girls take it to be. instead of shaving it all off, just get a decent trim (:

qZzNkbsBaa	First of all, you need a narrow face and almond shaped eyes. If you don't, then you might not be able to pull of the look. But to do it, you use liquid eyeliner, silverish blackish blueish (a dark color) eyeshadow and an eyeliner brush. You first put on the eyeliner then go over it with the eyeshadow using the eyeliner brush. But you dont have to do it on the bottom. How to actually put on the eyeliner, just practice on making it look like that.|`|bNE83Dsyaa	Start with a eyeshadow that is about the same color as your skin tone. Then add a darker brown ( one that is about 1 -2 shades darker than the other) into the crease to define the eye. Line the top lid with black eyeliner and wing out the corners. Line the bottom line. Finish with a couple coats of mascara...|`|dOzYXMLZaa	ok. u use black liquid on the  top & bottom of ur eye.

I also think fresh colours like greens and blues are good for spring.

You should at least have medium length hair to achieve that style of bangs, and in my personal opinion, you should have layered hair to pull of that look.

AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist, and I work for Mac.<br>  <br>  I would not suggest using a powder if you skin is dry. However, if your skin gets oily during the day, then you do not have dry skin, but COMBINATION skin. <br>  <br>  I would use a primer before applying foundation to help it stay put.<br>  <br>  The best foundation for combination skin is Studio Fix Fluid or Powder. They liquid version goes on smooth and blends nicely, and it feels good on the skin. It has medium plus coverage, and helps keep skin matte throughout the day. The powder version can be used alone, or set overtop of SFF. It's a soft, highly pigmented matte powder. But if you have dry skin, it will stick to flakes.<br>  <br>  I have been using Studio Sculpt since it came out. It's a gel formula that goes on smooth and blends effortlessly, and feels hydrating. It's medium plus coverage. The shades are a little off on this line, but once you get matched correctly, you may just fall in love with it. I know I have!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)

Whoever would say anything like that is obviously lying and just jealous. You are honestly gorgeous!<br>  <br>  You really don't have to change anything at all, but if you want some helpful tips, buy a straightener and try straightening your hair. You could also change your parting in your hair so its more to the side. Wear a little bit of brown eyeliner, and if you want even try mascara! I would get: Lash Blast! It comes in an orange bottle. Greens and purples would look great with your complexion, so try wearing a green or purple shirt every once in a while. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|Dl7NgTMdaa	aww yur pretty!<br>  i luv how wavy yur hair is!|`|w4l8NajJaa	get contacts will really bring out your eyes <br>  wear a lil makeup not alot since you have nice skin<br>  try a new hairtstyle <br>  ask the hair stylist what would look good on me<br>  then you will be invincible haha|`|yVRnOawlaa	your gorgeous, <br>  <br>   maybe straighten your hair|`|MuVPoAUiaa	You're pretty!

Just put your fingers at your ears and run them back an dup till you get enough hair to pin. Also you could do a bun, or you could do a messy bun, or you could grab your hair at the nape of your neck and twist it pull it up and put a claw clip in it letting the ends hang over the clip.

Jp3cWTJiaa	what is threading????|`|vtW3qPZmaa	No - both use the same method of pulling the hair out by the root.  Waxing just does a larger area at a time than threading and is therefore faster.  The threading will have the same result on the hair shaft as waxing (as would plucking or epilating).|`|IEQtnSbyaa	i dont think so cos aint youu just pulling the hairs out from th roots when threading like they do waxing<br>  <br>  it should have the same result but you should check with a professional just in case

BOofOvNOaa	The itchy-ness under your arms is probably not an allergic reaction. It's probably just bumps from shaving. To make sure its not an allergic reaction dont shave someday and then try the deoderant. Otherwise, maybe contact your doctor.|`|j0zDQQG2aa	Try a roll on deodorant.<br>  <br>  I would thing you have a sensitivity to the sprays.|`|5Hmyjr7Eaa	ask your docter|`|51iL6SvAaa	actually, mens deodorant works alot better if you sweat a lot <br>  as for the allergic reaction: it could be that you're allergic, or you could have razor burn and the deodorant is making it itch because of the broken skin. in that case, find a deodorant that is for sensitive skin|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	If you have tried the ones for sensitive skin the only others are either natural or perscription.  I know Burt's Bees has several natural ones that make work without issue.  You should also be careful not to shave right before putting it on because your pores are still very open|`|FHi0v36eaa	You could just have dry underarms. Try using a moisturizing cream and see if that helps. The deodorants could be drying out your skin too much.|`|zsEW8stLaa	TOMS! im allergic to dove deoderanttt.<br>  just put on lots of layers.<br>  or try one of those roll on ones that are reallly liquidy just wait till it dries to put on your shirt.<br>  dont want fake sweat stains hahaa

Just use some walgreen brand cleanser and another product used on the spot to get rid of them.  I only say that b/c you can tell from the shower pic that you were wearing coverup in the others.  Pretty eyes, nice lips, and your skin looks soft.  SO remeber do stay hydrated.<br>  <br>  BY THE WAY mineral make up doesnt clog pores like cover up does.  What you should do is use avon's mineral foundation, its a lot better for skinn.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	listen girlie, you are in no way shape or form gross. you are very vert pretty, with amazing eyes and perfect lips!!!!<br>  <br>  a good foundation will help with your skin, and actually help it clear and take the redness away. i have bad skin too. i use "everyday minerals" and my skin looks flawless, even though it is far from it. and because its all natural, it helps it heal!!! <br>  <br>  go here and try it <a href="http://www.everydayminerals.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.everydayminerals.com</a><br>  <br>  you can try it for free, no strings, only pay $3 in shipping.<br>  <br>  since i started using it i get mega compliments on my skin!!<br>  <br>  the only other thing i would change about you is to have longer hair, but then again, im partial to long hair.<br>  <br>  plz answer mine!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnaOX.zTPukxxmF7XOyauBXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219175047AA8rIR7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|l2E4qEsAaa	You look really pretty in the last picture-- a cute, up-turned nose and very full lips.

Your absolutely gorgeous and i see nothing wrong with your appearance. I have acne myself, and im struggling with it. Sometimes i wish i would practice what i preach, because the things i say to others, i don't really take note of and tell myself the same thing or listen to the advice i give others. Acne isn't a problem, that is something that goes away as time goes on. I think your very pretty, and i wouldn't change a single thing. If you have to change a thing about your look for others, then those people just aren't worth your time, in the long run you will meet a lot of other people that will accept you for who you are. Your skin doesn't look bad, at one point or another, we all have bad skin.|`|3EBGykXEaa	you have a unique look, i think its your eyes they are very pretty! I would say your a very pretty girl. If you think your skin isn't "perfect" you can do a few things to improve it. You could try using oil free makeup, washing your face daily, removing makeup at night, moisturizing and you could try some kind of acne system like acne free or SkinID if you want to go that far. <br>  <br>  You could try out different shades of eyeshadows or lipglosses (those things can make a huge difference!) I think lavender would look great on you with a nice pink lip. Maybe a thicker eyeliner on the bottom for some added effect. <br>  <br>  :-)|`|nF6whiGqaa	omg!!!!! you are so pretty!!!!! you could get rid of your acne and wear eyeliner. you would look really pretty with black eyeliner!<br>  and you would look much better with curly hair and longer hair.|`|jPnhpmhsaa	Nothing wrong with you.Only thing that you should get proper make up kit.Don't have to be expensive one.|`|SUWvLpaXaa	i like the 3rd pic|`|l3Fx04Ghaa	you look best with your hair up.<br>  you should let it grow out.<br>  ur skins the only problem..<br>  and use foundation and powder too.|`|hahwsMd7aa	add lotion and drink tons of water|`|7KWNeuG9aa	your very cute!<br>  i like the black and white photo which makes me think that you would look amazing with chocolate brown hair...that is a bit longer and not straightened as much..<br>  a bit of eyeliner and mascara as well as MAC powder foundation would improve your look so much more<br>  good luck|`|PkoPonY6aa	I think your pretty.<br>  Just some foundation and maybe the slightest bit of eyeliner would make your eyes POP!<br>  I have the acne problem too and no cleanser works great for everyone.

MAC power is great to cover those types of skin problems just be sure to match your skin tone.|`|CXT1SecRaa	yea your cute. i would say less makeup though, plus wearing less makeup would prob make your skin (which isnt that bad) healthier anyways, so you wouldnt need make up in the first place!|`|tqntoFxnaa	Aww, hun, you're gorgeous!<br>  <br>  Love your hair, it's cute!<br>  <br>  <3|`|vQWZx5Yuaa	maybe just some foundation..and curly hair would look better..
AA11461724	black hair usually looks good on tan skin, fair skin it rarely does. black dye is almost impossible to change, so you should try using a semi-permanent brand first to see if you like it, and if you decide you don't, it will rinse out, and if you do like it, wait for the semi to rinse out and dye it with a permanent brand. good luck!

C0HZ8ZB4aa	It's not tacky at all! I have three tattoos for my mum who died - and I will be getting tattoos for everybody I lose who I love in the future too. Nothing is tacky about a memorial, no matter how many people it's for, as long as you pick a great artist and do it right. I can't give you any ideas because I don't know you or the people you lost, I think you need to work out how best you want to reflect those people. If you're religious you may want to go at it from that angle, or you may like portraits, or you may want to fill it with random images of things they loved in their lives, or you may want to create a memorial garden scene with flowers and birds, or a paradise scene to reflect where you feel they are now. Anything, but think about it for a good while and very carefully. Your back is a big blank canvas so it's a great space to use for something like that, but use it wisely, you only have one back! Once you have your theme decided, find as many images as you can based on that theme, draw out any ideas you have if you can, and present them to your artist who will be able to bring it all together for you (unless it's a portrait piece - in which case you'll just need the four chosen photographs - but if you go down that road you must really pick a top quality artist, and probably be prepared to travel a bit to find someone good enough). Good luck. Don't worry about others opinions. Some won't like this idea but this is YOU and your way of expressing your grief and your love for those people. If it's what you want then don't worry about things like whether people will consider it tacky. I, for one, don't anyway. Good luck. xx|`|gyoylefvaa	Maybe a Cross with a name on each leg of the cross.<br>  <br>  Or <br>  <br>  A angel wings and in the bottom the 4 names.<br>  <br>  Sorry about your lost.|`|TprIqGhCaa	wow, I can't really think of much any ideas...but, I'm sorry sorry hun!<br>  I actually just thought of something, I mean, you probably already thought of it, but when you do the memorial, you can put You're Nanny and Grandfather at the top, one in each corner of your back, and your bestfriends at the bottom and one in each corner of your back. Just get things that they liked and maybe things you and your friends have in common and stuff. I'm not really sure what kinds of things they liked so I can't really help you much more then that, but I am so sorry.|`|EUnx6Ncoaa	no, but ask your tattoo artist....i think it will be hard to connect all those names...but sometimes they can do tattoos that use symbols for those people. my boyfriends mom has a tattoo with three flowers for each of her kids...so something that represents those people might be a better idea.|`|quHnUWyWaa	memorial tattoos are always a good choice in ink work, you keep the loved ones close to you, and you will probably never regret getting them. as far as theme, pick one that can reflect the loved ones.
AA11461724	i think you should show them how to dress like you do but nothing too short or revealing, etc. you can dress like a diva without showing too much. tell them that they can start wearing a bra when they have something to put in them lol it's true, they should wear bras as soon as they get boobs but they don't need them if they don't have any. as for makeup ... i think makeup isn't bad on younger girls as long as it's not too dramatic. like no bright lipstick, no bright blush, neutral eye shadows, brown mascara ... nothing shocking. if you think they're too young for that, tell them to wait a couple years and you will show them how to put makeup on in an understated way, to look natural. good luck!|`|kknSPYxKaa	It is important that your daughters feel comfortable.<br>  If they need a bra, let them wear one.<br>  I started wearing one when I was 11, but it didn't have padding in it.<br>  Let them wear makeup, but only on special occasions.<br>  Explain to them that they will be allowed to wear makeup at _____ age.|`|U5gixzszaa	well every kid wants to be like there mother they look up to you so just simply tell them that they are to young to dress like mommy and that this is mommies style and they should start there own and it would be fun for them to look "cool" in there own way without copying you!<br>  good luck!|`|g3IXprk9aa	First, I think there is nothing wrong with being a confident, strong woman. And I think showing that you are that type of female is a good example for your daughters, however, I wouldn't let them go overboard with make-up, clothing, etc.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how old your daughters are, but if they are younger I would just explain to them that when they are older then can experiment with make-up, but they don't need make-up to make them beautiful. I would tell them that make-up enhances their beauty, that way they know they are beautiful girls and are just adding to it. <br>  <br>  I would also tell them with clothing that they don't need to show off all their body parts when they are older because they should look beyond looks and have people (men and women) except them for who they are when they are older, not have them judged on looks.<br>  <br>  I would tell them that being a strong and confident woman comes from within and not by beauty or clothes.<br>  <br>  If they are getting out of control by being rude or forceful to you about this I would make a stand and let them know that you are the head Diva in charge, haha. And that when the time is right for them to know about these things you will be there for them.<br>  <br>  I don't want to seem rude and tell you how to parent your daughters, because that is all you and your choices. But mainly, I don't think there is anything wrong with showing your girls that kind of confidence, I would just make sure that they don't do over-board with these things or assume that make-up and bras is what makes a strong woman, because it's wayyyyyy, way way way, more then that.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped out a bit, good luck! :-)|`|tem6AQHHaa	omg honestly, these days, all kids are growing up fast! like im not even kidding when i was in pre-k and elementary like no one cared about style! but these days i see all these little girls with the latest fashion and sometimes they even show stuff. it can b cute but it can also b sad and scary! just kno tht i kno u are not the only parent with this problem! as for the make up, thts totes natural! i couldnt wait 2wear make up when i was younger! u can buy them like some fake makeup stuff but dont bring out the mascara or eyeliner till u think theyr old enough 2not poke their eye out. u can give them bright colors if its like for a b-day party or wen u kno they wont b in public. otherwise, let them use more natural colors like clear or light pink lip gloss. blush is okay too! u might want 2dress down a tad but u dont need 2. anyways its all up 2u! ur the parent! (but dont pull the im bigger than u kind of stuff. just use the its not right at ur age or wen ur older u can or other polite stuffz like tht! if they dont listen, dont b hard on them but dont give in either. ur their mom! im sure they wont stay mad at u forever!
zI3Y7Pz5aa	a tattoo will usually start to dry up within the first 5 days.<br>  <br>  its great to put a&d on at night but the fact your covers rub on it is not good. it takes off all the a&d and then can irritate your tattoo or even make it infected.<br>  <br>  what i do before bed when i have new ink is i put the a&d on, then i take saran plastic cling wrap and wrap it around the area i have the ink, that secure it with regualr ol scotch tape. works great, keeps the ink moist over the night, and actually helps speed up the healing process overall. my tattoos never ever scab because of this. once the tattoo ink stops bleeding out you can quit with the ad and plastic and just use lotion.<br>  <br>  plz answer mine!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnaOX.zTPukxxmF7XOyauBXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219175047AA8rIR7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|tCqj6lpqaa	Generally tattoos will stop bleeding in a relatively short amount of time after they are done.  For about a week or two afterwards, while applying A&D, you may get some of the ink seeping out with a small amount of blood and causing a nasty inky goo mess on clothing or sheets.  If you want to avoid the mess, wash the tattoo with antibacterial soap and warm water before bed and wrap it in saran wrap all night with no A&D on it.  You'll still have the seeping but it will be caught in the saran wrap and you'll have to repeat the washing process in the morning. During the day, just keep A&D on it and after a week or so it will start to heal itself just fine and you won't have any problems.|`|ERaIVdN8aa	It should stop bleeding in a day or 2....<br>  <br>  Put the A&D on and cover it with plastic wrap held on with athletic tape, or medical tape to sleep, otherwise you're going to get ointment, ink, and blood all over your sleep.|`|XToDPPuQaa	Just leave it alone for the first few days but you should keep washing, keep it clean. Clean it in salty water (or is that piercings..) at least twice a day.<br>  <br>  What did you get a tattoo of btw ? :)|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I find it very worrying that someone working at somewhere called Bodymods is going around advising people to wash their fresh tattoo in saltwater - thank you Charlott - I know now never to go to your place of work for any of my mods!! And needless to say, don't follow that advice!<br>  <br>  Everybody has really answered your question so there's not much to add. Personally I don't put a wrap on my tattoos for bed, I prefer to let them breathe and I don't have any troubles other than a bit of ink on my sheets in the first day or two occasionally. But we all have our different ways and I know a lot of people successfully choose to wrap it up for the first few nights so it's not wrong to do that at all. You're fine to start putting the ointment on now, clean it first (with warm water and antibacterial soap - not saltwater!) and then a very thin layer of ointment, don't over-do it. Good luck!|`|gyoylefvaa	Yes, it will be fine.<br>   it's fine and it's supposed to do that you skin it probably just really healthy just keep putting ointment and lotion on it stay away from lotion with alcohol and perfume it burns and drain's the color. It will scab up with color and DON'T PICK just let fall off.<br>  I have a butterfly tat on shoulder blade pretty big and that happened to me.<br>  wait a couple days if you still bleeding call your Dr.
j0yv0T0oaa	Emrace your curls and enhance them.  Your hair will be healthier if you do not straighten regularly.  I divide my hair in half, twist and pin them on top of my head and wake up with ringlet curls that are shiney and healthy looking.  You do not need a styling product for night, but you can use a bit of leave in conditioner or Pantene's glossing cream.|`|b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	Depends upon your face.

AA11461724	that color is pretty, but it's bold, and since you're hair is really light right now, it might turn out brighter and bolder than you were expecting. but red hair dye always fades - it never stays the same color it was the first day so it would fade to a softer red color. it might look a little severe since you have real fair skin, but a lot of times really red hair looks really good with light skin. i personally think it would look really good on you, you have the perfect features for that color. i say go for it. you might want to consider dying your eyebrows too. people will say not to and it's dangerous, but i used to do it when i dyed my hair brown 'cause my eyebrows are red. i did it with a q-tip. it just looks more natural that way instead of red hair and brown eyebrows. good luck!|`|TZlBh9XBaa	VERY SEXY COLOR!!<br>  GIVE IT A TRY!<br>  I THINK YOU'D LOOK WONDERFUL IN IT :)<br>  I DID IT AND I LOVE MY HAIR COLOR!<br>  THANKS FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTION!<br>  <3 JENNI<br>  <br>  AND YOUR WILL POP AND STAND OUT SOOO MUCH WITH THIS HAIR COLOR!

If you do color your hair this color and you (inevitably) decide to change it, it is VERY difficult to remove the red pigment.  Especially since you have lighter hair to begin with.  I think your hair color is beautiful.  There are women who go to great lenghts to get hair like yours.  I know that this will not change your opinion, but it is a very difficult color to pull off and when you color your hair and realize this, or you hate it altogether, it will be very difficult to un-do.

Wear  and wash your hair with the bands in tact.  Do not remove them.    You can spray spritz in your hair if you want.  That will keep the hair firm.   Once you keep washing your hair...it will begin to mat.  This is good.<br>  <br>  After a while of wearing the bands and washing your hair, the rubber bands will pop off.   This is good.    The end result will be dreads.<br>  <br>  You can watch the free video at AmidBeauty . com to learn how to plait your hair.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AjdaezeTaa	dude...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hipforums.com/newforums/forumdisplay.php?f=209" rel="nofollow">http://www.hipforums.com/newforums/forum...</a><br>  Dreadlocks - Hip Forums<br>  <br>  read this forum

However, if you continue to break out you may need to switch again.|`|cb8d9061f02810c2cced8d65c11335bdaa	absolutely. and if you are using a better product then you were using before it will put everything to the surface to get it out of your skin.|`|5ifgrIp4aa	Yes.

Ywz92rgXaa	If you have blonde or light brown hair, lemon juice can be used to lighten it. Unfortunately, lemon juice can also dry out your hair, causing a dull look and brittle ends. To avoid damaging your hair, try diluting the lemon juice. Mix one tablespoon of lemon juice with a gallon of water. Rinse your hair with the solution. You can repeat the process daily. The mixture will gradually lighten your hair. When your hair reaches the desired color, you can use the lemon mixture less frequently. <br>  <br>  Spending time in the sun will also lighten hair. If you go to the beach or pool, get your hair wet and then let it dry in the sun. Over an extended period of time, this will lighten your hair. If you plan to spend many hours in the sun this summer, this process may work best for you. However, if you are anxious to have lighter hair, try spraying your wet hair with a mixture of lemon juice and water. Let it dry in the sun. <br>  <br>  Some herbs can be used to naturally lighten blonde hair as well. Chamomile flowers work well to brighten hair and evenly add color to it. To make a chamomile rinse, steep half a cup of the flowers in one quart of boiling water for half an hour. Strain the mixture and let it cool. Wash and towel-dry your hair. Then pour the chamomile mixture over your hair. Catch the solution in a container and pour it over your head once more. Repeat this 10-20 times, depending on how light you want your hair. After the last rinse, leave the solution in your hair for at least fifteen minutes. Then rinse it out completely.|`|ifxzxsBmaa	I don't know but I think you should schedule an appointment with a hair stylists and have them suggests ideas on how to naturally lighten your hair.My hair naturally lightens by chlorine in the pool.So that might work for you too.

AA11461724	i think a medium mahogany brown or medium reddish brown would be really pretty. definitely something to lighten it up 'cause it's very dark and you have more fair skin. reddish/warm tones would suit you 'cause it will add more color to your face and bring out your eyes. good luck!|`|YROG9aGKaa	The one that says:...

VzBLSyfkaa	Well, first off, if it gets damaged by the heat I would recconmend buying a ceramic one. If that doesn't help, you could always buy heat protectant spray. That always helps. And another way to get good curls is use a flat iron. If you don't know how it's done, go to a good salon, such as Regis and Kelly, which is where I always get mine done and it comes out AMAZING, and watch how they do it. And if you do get the flat iron, make sure it's all solid with no lines or toothy things sticking out, cuz I had one like that b4, and everytime I used it, it pulled all my hair out and it hurt really really badly. And one more thing, make sure the flat iron isn't fat. You want it to be really small and slender. Also, I posted some links below. I also posted a link to a barrel weaver, which is one of those curing irons that makes it really wavy and crimped.<br>  <br>  Barrel Weaver:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2127495&productId=prod2127495&navAction=push&navCount=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...</a><br>  <br>  Ceramic Curler:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2158616&productId=xlsImpprod481670&navAction=push&navCount=1&categoryId=cat1000003" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...</a><br>  <br>  Flat Iron (the one used at the salons):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tranism.com/weblog/images/chi_flatiron.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.tranism.com/weblog/images/chi...</a><br>  <br>  Flat Iron Curling Videos:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv-JSQbcuHk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv-JSQbcu...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca3k1syt2G4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca3k1syt2...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiOfZv9EoUw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiOfZv9Eo...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrU5vRFWP-U&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrU5vRFWP...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c97pp_ebF0&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c97pp_eb...</a>|`|qB726TKSaa	you know if you go on youtube you can actually watch it so yea well if this isnt good sorry-ps dont go to tips it ruins ur tips strat in middle and do that then work way to bottom<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWRtOQIaLgo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWRtOQIaL...</a>|`|hkqrkpD7aa	If your hair is damaged, use a heat protector next time.|`|whAGMaYtaa	scrunch it! ;p|`|PvAQ7MYCaa	go to a hair stylist|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Buy some 'bendy' foam rollers, wash & towel dry your hair, apply styling mousse wind yr hair around the bendy rollers & blow dry gently all over till not quite dry.

Too often a head of defined, shiny ringlets turns into frizz or goes straight in the afternoon. With the right mixture of products, style tricks and healthy hair habits, anyone can keep curls all day. The following steps will teach you how to keep hair curled and frizz-free throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Wash hair with a mild shampoo and follow with a moisturizing conditioner. Detangle hair with a seamless wide-tooth comb while the hair is soaking wet and full of conditioner. The conditioner allows the comb to slide through hair during detangling without snagging hair and causing breakage. Moisturized hair holds curl better and is easier to style. If you plan to style straight hair into a curly hairdo, wash your hair at night so that you can use curlers. Curlers are much gentler and offer longer lasting curls than curling irons, hot rollers and steam rollers. Naturally curly hair can be washed and styled into a curly hairdo in the morning because styling takes less time. <br>  Step2Wrap hair in a 100 percent cotton towel and use palms to gently press out excess water. If you have naturally curly hair, substitute a cotton t-shirt for the towel because towels roughen up the delicate hair cuticle, which can contribute to frizz. Do not wring or squeeze the hair to avoid tangles. Remove the towel or t-shirt. <br>  Step3Add a moisturizing leave-in conditioner. A leave-in conditioner seals in moisture and helps curls clump. Comb the leave-in through the hair to distribute evenly. <br>  Step4Apply a styling product with extra hold prior to styling. Divide your hair into four sections. Smooth the styling product into each section from the ends to the roots. Comb the product through each section for full coverage. Your styling product may be a gel, mousse or styling cream. Gels and mousses usually offer a firmer hold while styling creams provide a more flexible hold. Use the product that works best on your hair. <br>  Step5Style the curly hairdo as desired. For straight hair, divide hair into sections and roll the hair in curlers. Get cloth or rubber curlers that are comfortable to sleep on. Let the hair curl overnight. Remove curlers in the morning and style as desired. Use hair spray to help the hairdo last. For curly hair, you can fix your hair on the morning that you plan to wear the curly hairdo. Divide hair in sections and finger twirl each curl and style. Add hair spray to finish. The right mix of styling products can keep a curly hairdo in place all day. It takes some experimenting to find the products that work best in your hair. However, the true secret of keeping curls all day is knowing how to revive any frizzy or straight sections of hair before you lose the entire hairdo. <br>  Step6Use leave-in conditioner and distilled water when your curls start to frizz. Mix 1/2 tsp. of jojoba oil with 3 tbsp. with distilled water in a spray bottle. Lightly mist curls with the conditioning mixture. Twist individual curls around your finger to revive any drooping ringlets. Curls are now shiny and defined. This method works best on naturally curly hair. <br>  Step7Put hair up in a curling pony tail. When curls start to frizz or straighten, an pony tail arranged to reset curls can revive curls. Gather the hair in a pony tail with an elastic. Divide the hair in sections. Roll each section into large sausage curls and pin them to your head. Arrange the large curls around your head in an attractive style that you can wear in public. Mist with hair spray. Keep the hair pinned up for one hour. After an hour, remove the elastic and pins. Style hair. Your hair should have more body, bounce and curl. <br>  Step8Add a curl enhancing product to your hair when you start to lose curl. Some styling products are created for curly hair and contain ingredients that enhance curl formation. These curl care products often come in the form of a styling spray or cream that can be used on dry hair to encourage curls. Even if you have straight hair, a curl enhancing product can help revive a curly hairdo. <br>  Step9Cover hair when it rains.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	i have the same problem<br>  <br>  i bought this curling mouse from a hair salon in a green and blue bottle, i think by TIGI. was only about $8 and it works great!!! apply that in your hair BEFORE you curl (or any other curling mouse i suppose), curl, then spray with firm hairspray. this is what i do and my curls last through the night after!!!<br>  <br>  plz answer mine!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnaOX.zTPukxxmF7XOyauBXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219175047AA8rIR7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|BtK9nSalaa	use a hairspray afterwards so they don't fall flat.<br>  u can always use a curling blam on dripping wet hair instead<br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219180026AAhdDjP">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|Zi0g5K3Iaa	Use hair spray and gel both.|`|LANeKStMaa	n!44a!

ZyQFd6NVaa	Step1Learn to like your curls. Straightening efforts and hair relaxants damage hair. <br>  Step2Keep shampooing to a minimum since shampoo tends to dry out hair. If you do wash your hair daily, dilute shampoo with an equal amount of water. <br>  Step3Use a daily conditioner to keep hair moisturized. Finger-brush your hair while the conditioner is in it. Then rinse. <br>  Step4Apply a leave-in conditioner or anti-frizz serum to your damp hair. <br>  Step5Deep-condition your hair once a week. <br>  Step6To touch up your hair in the afternoon, moisten your fingers with water and a small amount of conditioner. Run your fingers through your hair and smooth out the frizz.|`|xPkNM9cOaa	This product by american crew called di:fi is pretty good.  You should try it.

xqQO81Omaa	First things first, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. You might see a couple and think one of them isn't very attractive but that doesn't mean everyone will agree with you.<br>  <br>  Also Matthew Fox and Margherita Ronchi have been together since they were 20, they've been together for 20 years. I think you should respect their commitment to each other instead of criticising how they look.|`|DySUxIn4aa	All the time.|`|QeO8t3eCaa	all the time. its all about the personality ;]|`|a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	Yes, but so what.

A lot of people do that.|`|W0JeXey0aa	YEAH, MOST ALL GOLDIGGER YOUNG BIMBOS UNDER 30.  THEN AFTER YEARS OF GETTING NOWHERE, WITH CUTS AND BRUISES FROM BEATINGS, BEING FAT AND BROKE, THEY TRY FOR A NICE NORMAL GUY.

A5PWZgHfaa	Because of genetics and the melanin in the skin.  If you are lighter, it would be beneficial to use a sunblock in #15 or higher.  I have seen some whites who age well, especially of Jewish/Arabic heritage.|`|k1FenuRLaa	i agree with africans but not azns. a lot of africans look older than they really are when they are young so i guess it paysoff.|`|XsLj9jERaa	they have more melanoma in their skin...which is what us white people typically lack. <br>  just make sure if you are white that you use lotion and put some money aside for surgery...my mom is white and she doesn't look at all her age and she merely uses lotions and stuff! <br>  :)|`|wvrMda78aa	Probably because  thier darker pigmented skin doesnt react as much to damage from the sun, or you just cant notice the damge as much. Lighted colored skin wrinkles easier and the suns rays can damge it faster then darker skin.|`|B24W8w43aa	Darker skin hides spots and blemishes better. (My husband is Korean with really bad acne. He looks ok though because he has dark skin)|`|jgpYS0oEaa	I just turned 20 and people think I look 15...lol<br>  <br>  I think with Asians we tend to be smaller, have a overall younger look in the face to most people...dunno why.|`|QlzFoBS3aa	They don't make a practice of Sunbathing/tanning.|`|B3HsDsIXaa	Well, technically colored people are more evolved that white people, I mean look at their skin, it is dark to prevent sunburn and blends in better in most environments.  Its kind of ironic that white people think they are better than races that are more adapt at surviving in nature.|`|W0JeXey0aa	It is black, NOT african american, because then you should say asian-american, etc, which only causes racial strife.  It is all in how people take care of themselves when younger.  Teens who go to the beach a lot, or anyone for that matter who does, will be a wrinkled prune by 30.|`|3df04cb0f414d1878769ff772712fe9caa	because they tend to die young.|`|vkogRydnaa	because they're black and you can really tell if they have wrinckles.

By law, they have to list the active ingredients, so it should be right there on the back.  Try looking at a vitamin store or a grocery store with a large natural health department, like Whole Foods.  I have heard of people having good luck with the crystals, but they never worked for me.  Your other option is to switch to a deodorant, which only contains scent, not antiperspirants, but if you sweat a lot, they suck.  <br>  <br>  Have you spoken to your doctor?  There are other treatments for sweating like Botox injections and sweat gland removal, but those really should be a last resort, and I'm not sure that a doctor would perform them just because you don't want to use aluminum based products, I think they are usually reserved for people with serious hyperhidrosis.|`|cb8d9061f02810c2cced8d65c11335bdaa	did you read the ingredients on your Secret to be sure that your friend is well informed?

XEqyrTTGaa	defenatly blonde! blondes are specail! only 20% of the blondes you see are naturealy blonde! but if you really want a change i sugest lowlights|`|eIjiI0M8aa	I like the blonde but I think that you would look cute with light brown hair too. One thing to think about though, when you want to go back to blonde, it will be hard to find the color you once were without having to keep coloring it. I was always a dark  blonde, now it's brown..just in the past few months when I dyed it. Good luck! The color I use is Acorn and I really like it!|`|UBXkJM3Waa	chestnut is the perfect color.<br>  it'll really bring out your blue eyes.<br>  i'm going to suggest herbal essences' color me vibrant in CARAMEL SHIMMER.<br>  i used it once and my hair came out really shiny :)|`|hcqoELicaa	no you look very pretty and should stay like that dont go brunette you are very pretty dont ruin it girlfriend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|MuVPoAUiaa	I think you look good blonde, but you should give chestnut a try!

eIjiI0M8aa	I have the same problem. What I have to do when I tan (in a tanning bed) is place a towel on my face about 75% of the time I lay and just use a self tanner on my face. If you are laying outside, I would just wear a really strong SPF and a hat.|`|VjDNLUIRaa	use sunscreen or keep out of the sun when it is at its hottest, in mid afternoon.<br>  but i think freckles are lovely. they are cute and individual.|`|XADP739faa	You use sunscreen or zinc. The sun gives freckles.|`|c9cTrfqEaa	Use a high sun screen on your face also you should be proud of freckles there pretty use bronzer to enhance them!|`|5ifgrIp4aa	That stuff happens when you go out in the sun.

acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	Honestly, I don't think black head washes or cleansers work very well. I've tried a few, and they don't make a difference. Try Biore Pore Strips. You keep it on for 10 minutes and peel it off. It hurts a bit, but it literally pulls everything off of your nose. Here's a video of somebody using the product. It's kind of gross, but it shows you what it removes. All the stuff on the strip are blackheads and particles in your pores. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQuShpOoJ-Q&feature=PlayList&p=A469C57A9D40C3DE&playnext=1&index=106" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQuShpOoJ...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.biore.com/usa/products/productInfo.asp?productId=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.biore.com/usa/products/produc...</a>|`|AA12133586	philosophy purity n clarisonic brush the way to go look on sephora.com|`|tsr8suCAaa	Biore|`|mKEu8rAaaa	Neutrogena works very good. Its in a tan bottle. The facial wash with the micro scrubbies works good too. I use then together.|`|87KMkWLuaa	WHAT IS THAT
wGwBpIDQaa	i would heat it 4 like 20 seconds and use it as a hot oil treatment but dont leave it in too long!:)|`|ULitp0PWaa	Yes u can. 20 seconds is a bit much though. I remember one girl telling me that she put hers in for 10 and it burned her hand. 5 sounds like it would be enough, but it all depends on the power setting on your microwave.<br>  <br>  ?
quHnUWyWaa	costs vary depending on location of tattoo, size of tattoo, artist, region of country, and various other factors. best bet is to talk to an artist, yes, most tattooists are artists. have your artist draw it up for you, if you have already drawn it up and know the size and location, choose the artist, one you feel comfortable with, also ask to see a portfolio so you know he type of work being done. at hat time you and the artist can decide on a price|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Good choice!!! Can't beat the Beatles!!<br>  It totally depends on the size and the font etc. If you have it too small it will blur over time. And if you want single lines or thin outlines with fill. You would probably look at about ￡60 for an average sized tattoo of that, if you had outline and fill (which would look better than single lines), at the studio I go to here in England. But that could vary massively depending on the artist and the size.<br>  I understand what you mean about it being nerve wracking to enquire about something without knowing if you're getting it yet (kind of like asking a salesperson in a shop how much something is when there's no price just knowing they're going to expect you to buy it). But they'll be totally used to that. And they would expect you to go away and think about it again - they often have more respect for the people that do wait and think it out a bit more. So try not to worry. But perhaps you could email the artist you're interested in using with the exact size, font and layout that you want, give as much info as you can and see if he'll give you an estimate over email? Good luck!|`|gyoylefvaa	Depending on when you going to get the tattoo.<br>  Depending the size of the tattoo and the style.<br>  I think Somewhere between $120 and $250.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|k4J9f9U9aa	well, it depends on if you get it in color/black, the text style, and how big the tattoo is all together.<br>  <br>  if you get color, it'll cost more, and if there's a lot of detail, it will cost more. if you get black text and the style just a basic style, and it's about a medium size...it might cost about $100-$135.<br>  <br>  your best bet is to just call them and ask them...maybe email them the picture and ask them over an email.|`|rp7TdRdEaa	i got a tattoo with a sparrow and some lyrics and it was 130...it really just depends on how long it takes them. but i would expect around 100.

zGQt7sAOaa	well, most dark brown or black hair dyes actually improve your hair's condition. so you shouldnt worry about that. when you bleach it or go lighter is when you have to worry about damage. so just go with basically any brand.|`|KSC9fCwOaa	hair dye.....??|`|0tlkSKScaa	Go get it done at a salon, or use L'Oréal|`|AA11202462	go to a professional. <br>  they kno the best.|`|qMpykWznaa	try a hair dye like at spencers or like sallys beauty store|`|SNsfvo0Laa	I think dyng your hair is kinda dumb stay natrul, or go see a professional they do it the best.|`|ILLm6gnZaa	Shade 'natural black' by Nice 'n' easy.

OW and my opinion about them is that they look kinda gross. you could try styling your hair different. I got my hair cut short a couple months ago, but not too short a little above my shoulders and a little below my chin and a lot of people like it.

2Dy6jZBtaa	the smearing is because of these reasons: ur not waiting for it to dry completely before putting ur clothing on, ur not rubbing it in well and evenly and u don't exfoliate well enough, no water or sweat on ur skin for a couple hours, so no working out after until a few hours pass and don't use n e thing with oil in it before u use a sunless tanning lotion, gel or spray...a spray tan at a salon is fine, they modified the formula so that even if ur white a a ghost, u will get a natural looking tan. they do have recommended darkness's for each skin tone. u can even just get a light glowing bronzed look. st. tropez has a great self tanner...another great one for beginners is clarins...they do have mystic tan for at home use, which is what salons use...thereis a great how to and what to do to prepare for self tanners and spray tans on mystic tans website..<br>  <a href="http://www.mystictan.com/consumers/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.mystictan.com/consumers/defau...</a>|`|zgBelCROaa	I don't know why spray tans don't work for you...but I would reconsider cause that is really the best way to get a nice even tan without burning.|`|dBPCT41kaa	Theres a whole bunch of them.

But I also know for a dewy look just moisturize. Face primers can really do the trick!<br>  MAC is a great brand for that. :-)|`|idhcqr5Daa	Choose the perfect foundation. Something that will not cake on your skin and leave it looking moist and almost dewy. Once you have found the brand, also buy the matching concealer in the same colour (or one shade lighter if you have dark circles). For this look, I recommend one of the many 'Recover' or 'Sleep effect' foundations now available. <br>  Find the perfect colour. Rub the foundation on to the palest piece of skin showing, like your inner elbow and back of your hand. Rub it in lightly and if it disappears, you've got your match. <br>  Apply the make-up. First wash your face and apply a rich moisturiser, not a light one, as you want to create a dewy radiance about you. Un-perfumed is best, as it will not sting your eyes when you sweat. <br>  Dab a blob of foundation onto your fingertips once the moisturiser has soaked in (about half an hour), and put a dab of it on every spot or uneven tone you can find on your face. This shouldn't be too much foundation. Now, with your fingertips, blend it all together in a circular motion until you get even coverage. <br>  Look at yourself in natural light. If any blemishes or dark circles show, now is the time to use that concealer. Apply it thinly to the offending areas and leave for 2 minutes to soak in, before using your fingertips to pat it into the skin. If some is still showing, don't worry at this stage. <br>  Take a large make-up brush and the slightest dusting of talc. Use both patting and circular motions to apply the talc and finish off the blending. <br>  Apply a natural blusher. Pinks are more natural than reds. Form a large smile so that the apples of your cheeks swell, and in a circular motion once again, apply the blusher. <br>  Gently sweep the blusher that is left on the brush across your forehead, your nose and anywhere else to take away what can sometimes become a 'ghostly' look. <br>  Choose mid browns or any other light colour that compliments your skin tone for your eyes. Apply a thick bold dusting of eye-shadow onto your upper lids. Where the skin just below the upper lid creases, apply the same amount of shadow again. Blend it all together with your fingers. <br>  Choose some eye liner and dot it onto your lower lid. Sweep it across with a cotton bud right into the corners to create a subtle but eye opening line. <br>  Apply mascara to your upper lashes as usual, especially in the corners. As for the lower lashes, the best thing to do is to wipe the wand til it is almost dry, and dab the remaining mascara gently onto each bottom lash using the wand tip. This looks less obvious. <br>  Put on a pale shade of lipstick followed by a slick of gloss, or just the gloss will be fine. <br>  Make sure you always use a dab of self tanner on your cheekbone to add that extra sexy look <br>  Use the best light to apply the make-up <br>  Choose the best foundation for your skin type <br>  Be sure to moisturise your skin deeply first, and let it soak in <br>  Apply only a small amount of powder <br>  Using too much of a scented moisturiser can make your eyes sting when you sweat later on <br>  If your skin gets irritated with redness or excessive bumps DO NOT KEEP USING IT. This will just make the problem worse <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi

I would say defeinitly do not try and bleach the black hair yourself as this is going to be really hard and will probobly not turn out as you want it.<br>  If you want to fade the black a bit use head and shoulders to wash your hair as this is the best shampoo for fading black dye x

Normally it's equal parts, but just look on the box or the bottle and it should tell you. If it doesn't, call Sally's and ask them.|`|zlXofrG4aa	I didn't know of any chemical unnatural colours at Sally's.  Vegetable dyes like manic panic and special effects are what I've always used for crazy hair colours.  In any case as long as it requires developer it should say somewhere on the box like 1:1 or 1:2.  That means parts, so 1:1 would be 1 part with 1 part, or equal amounts.  Obv 1:2 would be 1 part whatever, and 2 parts whatever.  Good luck!

Make sure its 1/2 inch.<br>  Twist hair all the way around the straightener, just like you would do if you were twisting hair around your finger. Imitate that, and youll end up with bouncy curls!! Just spray them lightly with hairspray, and use little sections of hair, instead of big sections. It really works. If you need better info. on how to do this, search it on you tube. they have good videos.

Not sure about your hair style? <br>  Use this website that you can upload your photo and find out all kinds of hair styles and hair colors - <a href="http://xrl.us/begt2c" rel="nofollow">http://xrl.us/begt2c</a>

AA11461724	try loreal natural match. it's a store bought box dye but has no ammonia. it has chemicals, but not the bad one, ammonia. revlon colorsilk is another brand that has no ammonia, and it's a lot cheaper than natural match but it doesn't work very well for lifting natural color. it's great for staying close to your current color. colors come in warm, natural and ash shades ... say your hair is medium brown ... there's natural medium brown, warm medium and ash medium brown. stay away from ash shades, they aren't good for covering grey. good luck!|`|ylh8dRokaa	I would recommend henna. Go to a drugstore and buy henna natural hair dye. It's made from an herb, so it dyes (and conditions) your hair without chemicals and gives it an amazing shine. You can get whatever shade you want.<br>  You should consult someone who works at the store for help.<br>  Consult this website for more info on henna.<br>  <a href="http://geebal.blogspot.com/2006/08/henna-on-hair.html" rel="nofollow">http://geebal.blogspot.com/2006/08/henna...</a>
AA11461724	well if it's darker than the rest of your hair and you're trying to dye it lighter to match the rest of your hair, that's why it's not working. store bought box dyes are 20 volume. a lighter shade of 20 volume color can't lift a darker shade of 20 volume color. it has to be 30 volume or higher. you can go to sally beauty and get some 30 volume peroxide and a bottle of color you want and dye over it with that, but if this patch is much darker than your color you may need 40 volume. if you aren't sure about that you can also get a highlight kit and mix it together and saturate your patch with the highlight cream, and get a box of hair dye in the color you want and dye over your patch after you lighten it with highlight cream. just be sure to not leave the highlight cream on to long. if you leave it on too long it will make your hair stretchy since this hair is dyed. just leave it on long enough to where it's close enough to the rest of your hair, then dye over that with your color. good luck!|`|Ta7snyIoaa	Well how have you been dying it? Was it with a lighter color because that won't work. I'm assuming your hair is lighter so maybe try and take the color out with bleach and then dye over it? <br>  You might want to go to a salon.|`|wHdPzovBaa	maybe get a small carpet to go over it or get new carpet where the stain is!?!?|`|Rf2r23sYaa	You could get a hair dresser to bleach it. You won't be able to do it yourself without ruining your hair. Other than that you can only cut it off.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	Get some dye remover.  You might need to go to a beauty supply store, though my fav drugstore stocks it.  A box is comparable in cost to hair dye, except it removes dye without changing the color.<br>  <br>  Now, when you take out the dye, you'll get whatever the hair dye did to your hair without the color.  If the dye contained a little peroxide, then it probably lightened your hair as well as depositing color.  So you won't get your natural, undyed hair color.  You'll get...well, you'll just have to see.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to dye or bleach your hair afterward.
AA11461724	if you want to do it, go for it! but i think you shouldn't go as light as bleach blonde 'cause everyone has it, it damages hair really badly and it's really hard to upkeep when you have dark hair. a medium honey blonde with some lighter blonde highlights would be so pretty for the summer. i would do it myself only because i'm really experienced with coloring hair, but if you don't know what you're doing ... go to a pro to prevent any accidents or unexpected results. good luck!|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Don't try to do it yourself believe me you'll be sorry. It could turn a weird color or easily fry your hair. Go to a professional and you'll get a great turn out promise!!!
euTcjyusaa	hahah she does look like a fish|`|0xgVNOsaaa	i think that in that picture she looks like a fish...hehe...just thought i would point that out<br>  *use curling cream stuff so taht it will hold the curl and then curl it and then throw it in a messy bun...thats the run down get it, got it, doubt it hahahaha  MASTER OF DISQUISE i just watched that recently haha
Ue56xZ7vaa	i doubt that it will make your hair grow faster, but after you wash your hair, or when your rinsing the shampoo or conditioner out, cold water makes your hair shinier. <br>  <br>  i've heard using lots of conditioner and leaving it in your hair for a while makes your hair grow faster, i've tried it and i have to say it seems like it worked for me.|`|154dzJ1Faa	haha... some friends can be so cruel!!<br>  <br>  No, there is absolutely nothing you can use on your hair and scalp, or do to it, that will make your hair grow faster. (see previous question for full explanation)  But if you use good products, and keep your hair healthy, it will look better as it grows.  If the hair is too long, it just becomes too unwieldy and is of no value.<br>  <br>  However, you sometimes need to stimulate blood flow to your scalp to encourage optimum health to the hair root.  Brushing daily (with a proper brush and in the right way) or massaging, or maybe a cold rinse, will get the blood to your scalp.  That can only bring positive results.  So will good health, and good nutrition (no sugar).<br>  <br>  You shouldn't think that a cold rinse will improve hair growth.  It is a good rule to follow, though, to close the cuticle, and your hair may shine just a bit more.  It's all undone if you use heat after that to dry or style your hair.  A cold rinse in the shower is invigorating and stimulating to your immune system, however, and can keep you free from minor communicable ailments.|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	If you want fast-growing, shiny, healthy hair, use the Pantene Beautiful Lengths system. Part of the proceeds go to making wigs for women who have lost their hair to illness. It makes hair grow really fast, too!|`|11QzdN87aa	who knows.. it might it might not, but turning to water hot to cold cant be that good cause durastic changes like that doesnt work well with ahir<br>  allthough washing your hair with the coldest warer possible that you can stand showering/bathing in will make your hair shinier and healthier so, since it does make your hair healthier it might just help with length you never know|`|3oanK9hkaa	No, but it will make your hair less oily. I linked an article called "How to Stimulate Hair Growth". There is just way too much to type here! Hope it helps :)|`|H2l7tFFHaa	Nope! not true!|`|vOfAalGZaa	nope
jGBk09aeaa	Shampoo.  While hair is still damp, rub in a little gel.  Make tons of little twists in your hair and let dry.  As weird as it may sound if you have a bonnet style hair dryer even better!
Y0WSB4C2aa	brownish blackish is really flattering with blue eyes and pale skin but if you're nothappy with it, you should try something extreme. did you like the blondish? if so then you should try going platinum highlights and blonde because not only will it make you look tanner but it will really compliment your eyes :) good luck!|`|8V0yeQJ6aa	go for a natural shiny red or a chocolate brown.|`|SmJ8jXwRaa	i would do a chocolate brown I have pale skin with blue eyes also and I think this would look good and really warm you up Lil if that makes sense<br>  <a href="http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/articles/approve/4148_5635_Longoria-Eva-10-4x.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/a...</a>

wjPcDlK7aa	Please, please, please don't do it at home. There's a high risk of infection and it will definitely hurt! Go to a piercing place and get it professionally done! <br>  :)|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	well since no one is going to tell you how to do it at home because they assume it will get infected, but that is only if you use saftey pins or needles and rubbing alcohol like most people use who dont know what they are doing., so<br>  if you are going to do it at home do it the right way, NO SAFTY PINS OR SEWING NEEDLES YOU NEED TO GET<br>  a sterile 14 gauge hollow piercing needle<br>  16 gauge horshoe or captive bead ring, or labret stud<br>  piercing clamp/ forcepts<br>  latex gloves<br>  clean the area of your lip first. make sure everything is sterile.<br>  mark where you want the piercing. clamp the forcepts on your lip and make sure it is straight and lined up . make sure you are not going to hit any veins or anything and just push the needle through. then take the clamps off, put the ring through the hole of the piercing needle and pull it through. then put the ball on.<br>  <br>  clean it with 1/4 teaspoon of SEA salt and like 8 oz of water or so. the original orange dial soap works well too.<br>  <br>  do not use alcohol or peroxide or any of that to clean it. if it gets infected use bactine.<br>  <br>  be safe!|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	you don't do it at home, unless you want an infection that could possibly make you have to get part of your lip cut off! [seriously]<br>  <br>  the way to pierce your lip is save up some money and go to a professional.<br>  simple.|`|KCZYGGQVaa	u stick needles into it
AA10397194	I think growing out your hair and styling it would make the biggest difference.

If you don't have one in your area, Marshall's has really cute shoes that are comparable in that style.<br>  <br>  Heels also lengthen your look and straighten your posture, giving you a more confident walk.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/c3274x" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/c3274x</a>|`|hep8pA7Gaa	since it's for a job interview you probably wouldn't want to wear sneakers or converses or anything like that, so i think you should wear a pair of black ballet flats. i think they sell them at payless or kohls.|`|ebGjDZtMaa	flats heels or chucks/vans|`|tnoyKjJ1aa	depends on where you are interviewing but i would def say heels..<br>  <br>  a peep toe pump in black, gray, or nude will look adorable|`|4n6yhUbyaa	heals <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=6700347" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=67003...</a>
zXHNSohTaa	You're wearing black with navy? What kind of navy, those are two tough colors to mix, it can look mismatched or clash-y if you're not careful.<br>  <br>  I don't know what position you''re interviewing for, but for most job interviews, you should look polished and professional, so no printed tees or trendy blouses. NO sneakers, unless you're interviewing for Foot Locker! A nice, tailored button-down shirt, maybe in a bold colored solid satin fabric and black dress shoes is not too stuffy or made up, but will still look appropriate.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	A brightly colored, but modestly cut blouse. <br>  A printed tee with a little sweater over it<br>  a tank top with a crop jacket<br>  <br>  you can wear a lot of things hun--- if it is for a job interview just make sure it looks professional!|`|aedb18cb864b201ba7d9fcc0a8addbf0aa	Before you strap on the Converse (which are amazing shoes by the way), make sure that the outfit you are choosing is appropriate for the interview. Generally, you're expected to dress professionally and that would entail dress pants, not skinny pants, formal shoes, a button down etc. What I found looks cute with black skinny pants, if you're sure that that is appropriate, is a black cardigan vest (I know it sounds nerdy, but it's not, it looks good and semi-professional still) and the converse shoes or shoes that are black or white. Or, if the cardigan vest is a little much, a regular vest... and if that's too much... a black form fitting sweater to go over your navy top. Good luck!|`|C8NK12ieaa	I am going to give one Antiguan  style dressing ok gold belt black and gold hoodie black and golden nikies and a black sheds girl trust me you go look fly.|`|vtUeGp1Caa	A button down and converse. It shows multiple sides of you.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Heels and a white blouse
f4f3f79b7b8f882378c37ad59affe31eaa	Yes- it sounds really cute how you described them. People now wear white after labor day so I think the old rules aren't as important as they used to be.|`|tnoyKjJ1aa	that is more than ok.. it is okay now to mix your jewelry.. nothing should be matchy-matchy anyway|`|0AQF8pnKaa	Since gold's base color is yellow, yellow and gold will match together. I like to wear gold jewelery if I ever wear yellow clothing.|`|jwvGjDa4aa	white gold and yellow gold are ok.
DeQsKdmSaa	If she's plus size, try the plus size section in Deb, or the store Torrid. Try saying, "You know what hair dye I saw in Hot Topic/the mall/wherever you buy hairdye? It;s the best color! Itll look great on you!"

Those shoes would POP! <br>  <br>  -Try to lose that bag<br>  <br>  Second outfit: Very Paris style. Instead of that red lipgloss. Try a nude color. It will make you look very sexy.<br>  <br>  Third outfit: That looks a little bit to much. I would lose one of those jackets if i were you(:  For the neckalace, try something thats chunky (Silver or gold) At least put on a necklace and thats fine. And girl, lose that ring! Try a black one. Also, try a black glove too(:<br>  Overall, that outfit is very dramatic (in a good way)<br>  <br>  <br>  Fourth outfit: Very amazing! Too much red though.

They don't really look good with anything.<br>  And I'm not a fan of skinny jeans because I like to see girls wear clothes that show off what they have, not what they wish they had. The odds of a girl having the legs and hips to pull off super skinny jeans are very slim. I think I've seen one girl ever pull them off. Sad, huh.<br>  <br>  But what it comes down to is this: If you like it, and you want to wear it, then wear it. It's your style and your body.|`|KjW6f07maa	WOW i really like your sense of style.!!!

84bfe623838974188db70f3e01e4ea29aa	wait til ur 18. ur thoughts may change.|`|kCdISEGqaa	I'll just copy and past what I tell every minor who wants a tattoo:  Unless you live in Colorado, Florida, Idaho, New Mexico, or North Dakota, it's illegal, and state regulated, even with parental consent. New Mexico and North Dakota are non regulated states, and have no licensing guidelines, so any dirty scratcher can start a shop and ruin people's lives. Even in the states that it is legal, no reputable shop will do it.|`|OxUnUolBaa	Three X's could also look like "XXX" as in adult films. And 16... you're still a teenager. I suggest waiting. I thought of several tattoos I wanted but when it was time to get one I realized it may be a mistake for a few.|`|ibpoLakuaa	really cool idea. i would say the back of the neck? i think it would look pretty tight. but then again all 3 of those choices were good.|`|clInlnIqaa	Since you're only 16 you really don't know what you are going to do when you are 21. Understandably you can be different and still be straightedge throughout your life. Wrestler CM Punk (WWE) has been straightedge his entire life, and still is even in the setting he is in. Put it where you want it, but please think hard and long about what could possibly happen in the future.|`|Vr3GO7PJaa	i think its one of the most done out and pointless tattoos out there, you want to refrain from doing things that harm your body so your going to inject ink into your skin, if your gonna get a tattoo, especially when your that young, dont go with fads, wait a few years and really think if you want something like that on your body|`|8DjbA8ouaa	...maybe you should wait on getting something that dedicates your whole life to it tattooed on you just yet. i'm all for straight edge don't get me wrong. but you're young and your mind is subject to change.|`|zmjAccMFaa	Well you are only 16 so more than likely you are not even going to be able to get it in the first place.  You must be 18 in most places to get a tattoo legally, if any place tattoos you underage they are breaking the law and it is most likely not the best place to go.<br>  <br>  I guess that is an okay tattoo if you are over 21.<br>  Since you are only 16 and you don't do any of those things you are obeying the law not really making a statement.  There are a ton of people that are over 21 and don't do any of the above and don't say I am straight edge.  It is just a label sorry.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	I just want to let you know that when I was 16, I wasn't going to smoke cigarettes, do drugs, or drink (until I was 21, anyway).  I went to college and it all changed.  I drink, I used to do drugs, and I smoke about a pack a day.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying you're definitely going to change, but I do know that if you do and you have a straightedge tattoo, there's going to be someone somewhere who will see you drinking a beer or smoking a cigarette, see your sxe tattoo and beat the crap out of you.  Better safe than sorry.
AA10849332	your friend who is a piercer might have told you no for more reasons than just how it would look on you. your helix has to be formed a certain way to be able to get an industrial done, not everyone can get that piercing.<br>  <br>  if you want the industrial, go for it. but there are plenty of OTHER ear projects that can be done with your cartilage, not to mention a host of different cartilage locations that can be pierced. do some more research into it. <a href="http://www.bmezine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmezine.com</a> is a good place to start!|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	i'm getting an industrial...i guess i'm an ugly girl! haha. jk.<br>  <br>  if YOU want an industrial, then get one! you should consider other people's feelings and opinions, but in the end of the day do what pleases YOU, never waste your time doing things for other people or doing what they want you to do.<br>  <br>  i think regular cartlidge piercings are cute, and industrials are too (:|`|NS8GnAjdaa	I have my cartlidge, if you want industrial that bad you should do it. <br>  I thought about but decided against it... <br>  <br>  I think for now you should just do your cartlidge, and later you can maybe do industrial.. haha. :)|`|4vn0LdvQaa	well im 13 and i have my lip, industrial, and my cartilage pierced!<br>  <br>  my parents said the same thing about the industrial and i got it done and they all thought it looked sweet and i loved it but now it bugs the crap out of me. i have long hair and it always gets tangled up in my industrial. it sucks!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but do whatever you please.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh and answer my latest question please!|`|EVcqB9ehaa	Well I wouldn't recommend going against your mother's wishes or trying to be sneaky about it, but if you're allowed, you should go for it.  I, for one, think they look awesome.  Don't worry about what other people tell you to do.  Get what you like.|`|j1Js4uuTaa	Personally I think septum piercing are the ugliest piercings of all. On guy or girl. VERY few people can pull them off.

They can look pretty. :-)|`|7a8ab4344d6bd224f31215730fd8e1cfaa	Yes it does look like a spot but that's only because of your colouring, i.e skintone & hair colour. If you go out and buy one with a deep red or brown coloured stone in it, it will then stop looking like a spot or wart.<br>  By the way you are a very beautiful girl, be careful this nose stud does'nt leave a nasty purple scar on your "really Clear" skin for life.

My pierced hers but she used a large ring and it sagged and tore her gums.|`|JElrLv23aa	Your kidding right?|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	It looks uncomfortable and would be really bad for your teeth.

You need to use moisturizing shampoo.|`|Lqx6yJ1jaa	No way,thats just a rumour,because some people relax thier hair but still straighten it to help it along the way :) i dont know if thats what u meant by chemically straigtening though,plus,curly hair is the bomb :)<br>  hope this helps a little<br>  peace x|`|3IpTytUwaa	You won't go bald if you don't do it every day. Like once or twice a week is fine. If you use it too much then you will fry your hair and it will begin to fall out. At that rate eventually yea, you will go bald.|`|QuQioUd7aa	i remember when people told me i was going to go bald .. lmfao|`|PRzmwFfgaa	If you chemically straighten your hair and you need to use a straightener you should use it on a lower heat setting.

Great comboand I really recomend you to shave with warm water. Hot water tends to dry skin out. Warm water will soften your hair just as well as hot water does. Don't use cold water it can cause you to get goose bumps and you might cut yourself.and when you are done aply some cold water to close your pores back.I hope I my answer can be helpfull and good luck girl!!|`|TKf6z1vHaa	When your shaving your legs, shave in the direction of the hair growth. That is the best way to get rid of the hair. Many people shave against the growth and the actually causes razor burn or bumps, which are not attractive. Also, when shaving in the shower, try to shave after you've washed your hair, that way there will be enough steam in the shower that you legs will stay moist. Never shave dry or with cold water. It will give you razor burn. Also you can get shave gel or lotion and put on afterword. Nair is good to use, you leave in on for 5 min or so and then wipe off and you can do it when you shower. But shaving is pretty easy, you have to just get used to it. <br>  Good luck.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	I use a Mach 3.  I feel like men's razors are sharper and work better.

rsWzi253aa	It depends on what kind of mousse it is. Mousse is mainly a word describing the texture of the product so it could be made by a variety of companies for a variety of styles. Some are for scrunching, some for bounce, shine, volume etc. The main reason why people buy mousse is because it generally has an airy texture that won't be sticky or heavy (since mousse has bubbles in it).|`|SA6dCr0Laa	ANYTHING U WANT IT TO DO. <br>  IF U WANT BOUNCE THEN APPLY GENEROUSLY ALL OVER.

MMpKdxvLaa	Personally, I'd get it on one side, but I don't know. I just have a thing for one siders.|`|U7vLYGodaa	I only get piercings in pairs. so i would say get paired tragus' or paired conches. not one of each, it just looks weird and unbalanced to me. it would be really unbalanced to have them in the same ear, but if you get one in each ear at the same time it would be hard to sleep. unless you sleep on your back already. idk. I just think they look better in pairs.

LOL.<br>  <br>  gl!|`|INjM2aC4aa	Go to the doctor. It's a very minor procedure.|`|AA10335926	It's best to go see your dermatologist. Home kits can be dangerous if you've never been exposed to the element and you can be allergic to it as well. Go see a dermatologists who specializes in skin and they can guide you in the right direction. I read in a anatomy and physiology book that you HAVE to go see a doctor if the mole is bigger than the tip of a sharpened pencil so yeah. Hope that helped :)|`|5dMw30kMaa	I've had a mole removed. The procedure doesn't hurt too much but you probably would have to wear a bandage on your nose. And it leaves a little scar like just discoloration in your skin, like its lighter then the rest of your skin. But as far as if it's safe YEP it is. So go see your doctor and have them take it off, if it weren't safe they wouldn't do it. Good luck :D|`|8MnjjpJ7aa	It is safe and sometimes recommended, yours don't look so bad, see a dermatologist and have him remove it, if it bothers you, I never could understand why people with moles on their face don't have them removed.|`|Ixb3nCIDaa	best to see a doctor to get it properly removed otherwise it could get infected and even worsen|`|rK1nSum8aa	I really don't know about removing moles, but my best advise is to go see a doctor.

rb2XqC7daa	Handle your hair gently and carefully while combing and brushing. <br>  Try using wide teethed combs or own fingers to detangle hair. <br>  Don’t take a bath in very hot water.

rAEIG2jbaa	go to a professional and ask for help|`|6nMLLh2Naa	My Answer is that you don't need to be out in the sun a lot it is really dangerous it can cause skin cancer but you can go in the sun just as long as you have sunscreen, but don't you go out in the sun for too long. (The last time my friend went out in the sun, she got tanned like bad, so this what she did she scrubbed until she became lighter and it worked.)  But when i got tanned it went away;;<br>  But if you want a tan go into the the yellow pages or go to google maps and search for tanning salons near you but i prefer yellow pages.
qlnmWsinaa	Yes! They get 75% off merchandise to wear themselves. When they are at work, wearing Betsey is a strict requirement- hence the generous discount! Most stores have a 'sample rack' in their backroom that you can wear something off of for your shift tho, too.
HLSlEjluaa	don't just try the heel pads, put in full insoles and that should help, if they are too tight at the toes, then cut the front of the insole off and leave the mid and back bit in, let me know how it works out..i buy a lot online and i hate it when things don't fit!|`|8294rVR2aa	WOW nice shoes :)<br>  errm difficult question that i often find same problems because i have wide feet.i dont htink thicker socks would help because half the time they just make your feet slip out anyway, hmmm you could maybe try getting some insoles or gel cushions for the balls of your feet that normally helps mine fit better :) hope it helps and u get to wear them gawjus shoes :L|`|1suIEET4aa	oh God theyre gorgoues!<3|`|DeQsKdmSaa	You could also get toe pads.

If they even sell hair bleach in a drug store, most likely none of them will work. Unless your hair is already a light brown or dark blonde, your hair will only turn orange. So if your hair is anywhere between medium-brown to black, don't even bother. your hair will just turn orange. Sorry :/

4oH8rZ59aa	I have a girlfriend who has hair that sounds similar to yours and she also uses african american products. She also uses baby oil and occasionally goes to the salon for a conditioning treatment. I have used mane and tail and think it works good, especially since your hair tends to be a bit frizzy and puffy (which sounds dry to me). I would suggest if you wash it everyday, switch to every other and just use conditioner on the opposite day. Wash mainly the top and sides and let the rest run down your hair, that way you are not over drying it with shampoo. Let air dry when possible and use a comb not a brush, especially when your hair is wet.Try to stay away from heat damaging products. My hair is to the bottom of my butt cheeks now, just by doing a few simple things and paying attention to what it needs.|`|nT6dNIfBaa	If you go to Sally Beauty Supply they have a TON of things for your hair.. including lots of deep conditioners.. and hair strengthener.. and all that.. also if you take prenatal vitamins (even when your not pregnant) it will make your hair and your nails grow long and strong.. Your hair will grow much faster too.<br>  <br>  Just a note.. if you decide to use a deep conditioner, do not use it every day.. it is very good for your hair, but if you use it every day it will cause build up in your hair.. and may make it look greasy.. use your regular conditioner.. and use the deep conditioner once a week.. or every few days. At sally's they have a lot of deep conditioners in packets that are only like 99 cents.. so you can try them out before actually spending money on the whole bottle. <br>  <br>  Hopefully this helped you out. =)

VN2wyTnFaa	1) Depends on your skin type.<br>      Dry Skin--> Liquid or cream<br>      Oily Skin--> Powder<br>      Normal--> Any<br>  <br>  2) Compact foundation can be either cream or powder (liquid would slide all over the place)<br>  <br>  3) Depends on your skin type. Liquids and creams adhere better to dry skin and powders adhere to oily skin better. Coverage varies from product to product, but powders traditionally don't give too much coverage.<br>  <br>  4) You can definitely mix and match types of products like a liquid and a powder, but if you're going to, just remember that all liquids and creams go on together then powders go on top of those. If you do a liquid concealer and a powder foundation, concealer first, then powder or if you do a powder concealer and a liquid foundation, foundation first, then concealer. <br>  <br>  5) If you chose a mineral foundation and a liquid or cream concealer, the concealer would go on first, then the powder foundation on top of that. And if you're using a mineral foundation you don't need a finishing powder. Finishing powder is used to lock liquid and cream products into place. <br>  <br>  And I like cream concealers best. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped, if you have any questions feel free to e-mail me. Good luck!|`|dBPCT41kaa	I suggest mineral powder definitely because other makeups are bad for your skin, mineral is good. with mineral you dont need a concealer with loose mineral powder.

Then i usually do brown or rose color eye shadows for a natural look which im assuming you want. the darkest part goes on the eye lid then add a medium tone and a light tone along the eye brow line. always use a eye brow pencil that is lighter than your eyebrows and never press down or make a straight line it looks horriable when u can tell someone drew on their eye brows. I always just lightly fill in gappy spots. and as for eye lashes guys dont care how long they are so you dont have to clump them all up just so they look long just put two strokes of mascara on and they will look fine no matter how short. when im done all my make up i use a ver very little amount of  bronzer along the top of my hair line on my 4 head on my nose and cheek bones. And finally i have this pale skin tone blush and dab it on lightly so my skin looks glowy. I dunno where i got it but it makes a differance if anything just use a little tan sparkly eyeshadow and blush your skin with it.  I get so many compliments on my complection and my make-up and for my lips sometimes i use a pink colored lip liner and a pinkish shimmery lip stick lip gloss just wears off to quick. Trust me i live with for women ive experimented with it all.
X2I9Mu4Vaa	I colored my hair black when i was in 8th grade because i love black hair. BUT about two months later i was ready for a change and i literally had to bleach my hair 5 times in a week just to lighten it up enough to color it red (cause it will turn orange after you bleach black) and i figured red would be the way to go. Unfortunately red doesn't like to come out either. LOL Since i was 13 I've had a love affair with black hair and every few months i'll color it black and then regret it cause i'm ready for a change.<br>  <br>  If you want to commit to keeping the black hair then I totally suggest it, its beautiful. But if you like to color your hair alot you'll be sorry cause it will get damaged quickly! Hope I helped!|`|GYCy25vwaa	idk i think a bright red|`|3IpTytUwaa	It would look awesome on you. You are just pale enough and just tan enough. And the cut is perfecto!|`|8f330249a3b7ffb3745449eaf089d5cdaa	you would look georgous<br>  <br>  go for it|`|cKggyi3maa	i reakon you look good with the blonde
yUMDsXLYaa	well maybe u can find someone on yahoo someone who really likes fashion or maybe u can interview other ppl to c if they hav the right stuff and if it does turn into a buisness i will probally visit it all the time i love fashion i wanna be a fashion dizioner when i grow up
z33hxpHJaa	that isn't weird... i see guys do that all the time... but if you got a problem with it then start a new habit like when you go to twirl your hair start tapping your fingers or something.|`|IM7nzdjbaa	Sit on your hands?  Wear a hat?  It's not weird, you just picked up a random habit.  It should eventually go away.|`|mvotlqL9aa	do something else with your hands.Lol not meaning to be funny  maybe you should start a new habit like tapping your fingers or cracking your knuckles i personally bite my nails
Q0Ky6DeLaa	That's one big purse! Anyways, I think you can narrow it down to the bare essentials. Think: what can't I go with out? Not: How much can I fit in here?<br>  <br>  -Your fave Lip Gloss (Make-up, you never know)<br>  -Your fave mascara<br>  -Contact Solution (Needed)<br>  -Glasses (Only bring when it's supposed to be sunny)<br>  -Wallet (Need. Always good to have money)<br>  -Keys (Needed. Drive/get in house)<br>  -Phone (Needed. Call anyone)<br>  -ID (Needed)<br>  -Batteries (Just a few)<br>  -Pen+Pencil ( Always good to have)<br>  -Gum (Good to have)<br>  -Brush (When you get indoors if its windy or fix your hair)<br>  List will vary depending on where you're going. If you're going to the beach, it makes sense to bring books and glasses, but not to bring lip gloss/mascara. If you're going out with friends, you'll need your keys (if your driving, cell, gloss, and a couple other things. The tanning supplies can stay home if you're not going to tan. Good luck!|`|0OB7yhCKaa	why the hell do u need 3 mascara??? lipgloss is ok i guess and contact solution if you really need it. sunglasses, wallet, keys and cell phone obviously are normal! id is ok and your batteries. books??? really? dont carry your camera in your purse if someone tries to rob u it's gone too! wow you do have lots of stuff! i have my wallet my cell phone my chapstick and my keys! lol thats it|`|Ig8gn0E1aa	i think that the things you NEED are neccesary, if you need all that stuff its fine but dont lose them and make sure nobody steals them......the books might need to be taken out cause they will take up too much space and who needs to read on the go anyway lol|`|1r5d87Oraa	I carry that and scissors, tampons, and a compact. As for designers I am loving YSL bags. The absolute awesomist thing now in vintage Chanel if you could get your hands on one. What else Marc Jacobs of course. Oh and MIU MIU, Chloe, and Lavin, are other good ones.|`|jIyvb2OOaa	no thats not enough. I always carry a first aide kit with me at all times. And a dog. It's not so much a purse as a closet though.|`|AFgwcJUPaa	Its a bit much, but if you use everything in it then I think its fine! There really aren't any rules, just whatever works for you!|`|XeEkpxXoaa	im pretty sure that all of that couldn't even fit in a purse!|`|zlWDgSNZaa	nahh everythin seems normal except the book msybe .. but  i would get coach or prada i just got a really cute prada:)|`|ll6e1VEzaa	no, thats not a lot. i have more in my purse(haha). my purse is really cluttered and i KNOW my purse is cluttered, yours is NOT even close to being cluttered. I have...<br>  - lipgloss<br>  - like 5 mascara<br>  - about 3 books<br>  - a camara<br>  - a little mirror<br>  - my wallet<br>  - pictures of me & my family<br>  - eye shadow<br>  - blush<br>  - my straightener or my curler<br>  - and a whole bunch of odds and ends(i mean a whole BUNCH of odds and ends, lol)<br>  <br>  so, i can come safly to the conclusion that you don't have a cluttered purse, i do(lol)<br>  <br>  Hope This Helped!|`|08CcFecIaa	i don't think you should put books,camera,or whiteout in your purse.that is kind of a lot of stuff,but if u think you need all of those things you should put it in.|`|kV49h0xzaa	ITS kinda much...but I would take out the 3 mascaras to 1, take out the white out,and the books!!!!|`|3cvHXxUSaa	It honestly depends on how much you use everything everybody differs. Like i have lip gloss brush ( small one) Wallet glasses keys phone and gum in my purse...|`|N8xg78Flaa	i dont think that you need like a book, but yeah everything else seems pretty necessary. just dont lose it.<br>  i would get coach|`|CqvatiKoaa	i think its too much so get rid of...<br>  some of the masscara<br>  wallet(thats y u have a purse)<br>  pen and white out<br>  books<br>  camera<br>  perfume<br>  <br>  seriously u made a purse like your room :)|`|9N7qEf9Faa	It sounds like you would be set for anythin anywhere so I think thats just enough. Try coach, or juicy coture|`|bwBSmCouaa	thats a BIG purse....|`|brVHExN0aa	girl i carry way more in my purse/backpack so that's enough ha-ha|`|zMYYow55aa	uh. not 2 much<br>  jus get a bigger bag|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Whatever she wants in her purse...<br>  <br>  It depends on the individual I guess.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Why do you need three mascara??<br>  And why carry perfume?  You should only put it on once a day or else you will smell too strong-- just because you can't smell it doesn't mean we can't.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't carry a book and a camera with me all the time-- just when I thought I'd use them.<br>  <br>  I carry--<br>  <br>  Wallet<br>  planner<br>  water bottle<br>  pens and pencils<br>  eyedrops<br>  sunglasses<br>  lipstick<br>  chapstick<br>  keys<br>  gum<br>  iPod<br>  pills|`|is4zQxltaa	do you seriously need THREE mascaras? i understand one (in fact i carry my whole makeup bag with me), but 3? you only have 2 eyes darling...:P<br>  <br>  other than that, i carry a lot of that stuff around too. this is what i normally carry...<br>  <br>  makeup bag<br>  brush<br>  hairspray (my hair is like my insecurity, lol)<br>  wallet<br>  keys<br>  cellphone<br>  ipod<br>  sunglasses (summertime)<br>  any books we are reading in english<br>  mirror<br>  lip balm<br>  gum<br>  pen|`|AA11029380	You could take out a couple of the mascaras and a lip gloss.  But as a girl you probably ought to carry a couple "personal" items just in case.|`|IhtABUWMaa	In my purse I have keys, cell phone, ipod, gum, money, ids/credit cards, and some lip balm. How big is your purse? =O|`|7nrhPCf0aa	wow girl, you must have a big purse. lol.
3iB7bnJGaa	yeah u have learned your lesson...<br>  so it is time to go to the salon. <br>  My Friend did that and it came out looking like a blind person cut it.<br>  She went to her hair salon and they made it look awesome. So the best thing is to go get it re-done.|`|QuQioUd7aa	go to a hairdresser ?|`|BtK9nSalaa	even it out by trimming it to the shortest length. or go back 2 hairdresser<br>  <br>  answer mine some1? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmAWaaKOiBH44edaHPTf7LPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
tnoyKjJ1aa	white and grey are neutrals and will match everything..<br>  <br>  sounds really cute|`|C0KejMfVaa	sounds ok to me.|`|2jJTKeIHaa	They match fine. Gray (along with white, black, and brown) is a neutral and will match with anything. So any colored shirt would look fine underneath. Pairing that with jeans or a skirt would look very cute.|`|1uvKFOmoaa	sounds cool. white and grey will match with everything. the blue will add some color to your look. thats a pretty nice combo. jeans would go will it too.|`|4QfyirQjaa	Sounds good :)
62ba5ca2b4be2582988c9c78b56c7032aa	Did you pluck the hairs off of your upper lip and chin? If so that will make them thinker and have more growth. <br>  <br>  Bleaching your hair is fine, but waxing or threading will help slow the growth and thinkness of the hair. I suggest you get a professional to wax it.|`|Sga6uU4Zaa	Do not shave your upper lip hair!<br>  It will come in darker<br>  If you have a little more just get Nair<br>  You leave it on for like 5 mins <br>  Then all the hairs gone<br>  Just do it like every 3 weeks<br>  Not that bad<br>  ;) Or you can wax|`|0S0wRN0haa	bleach but save up some money an go 4 Laser removal. it works and permantly removes it for good.|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	It's safe, a lot of people do it. I'd rather bleach than wax facial hair!|`|IT7ka3Ybaa	shave them off

But what you should do is find a hairstylist that is able to work well with your hair. Any great hairstylist should be able to do whatever you want to your hair. If you get your hair washed, blow-dryed and straightened before any up-do, that will reduce frizz big time!  You can also have it curled after it is straightened for a perfect frizz free curl!  Good luck girl and have fun!<br>  <br>  P.S.  For your prom dress try Deb's!  Hopefully you have one in your area!|`|9WM91gMHaa	I'd either do the pinned back at the bangs look with curls or maybe try a lose 40's wave. <br>  <br>  If your dress is strapless, try putting your hair entirely up in a nice updo<br>  (curls pinned to the top of the crown of your head would be nice)<br>  <br>  if its a halter-- try wearing it in a half<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|P0h7lY7raa	k first, make your hair one of those fluffy curly pop uty oprah-ish hairstyle!<br>  then do it in kinda like these miny pony tails on the side! pig tails wat ev!<br>  <br>  hope this helps! i reeeeeaaaaaaallllyyy hope this helps! p.s i need the points|`|nohyeGTaaa	i went to DEBS i couple of days with my mom and we got my semi dress there and its really cute they had lots of beatutiful prom dresses there and my friends said they got theres at jc pennys and there dresses are cute too.

You are a very pretty girl and I think you could carry it off really well. The other pics are nice but the heavy stripy look is getting a bit dated if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  :)|`|1MunHqScaa	OMG GO FOR IT!!! u would look great !<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=At4dav1XIxDY5wk2B4v3pDDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220175216AA5XS8o">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|UHrSw67oaa	First of all, your really pretty!<br>  I really love the first look. <br>  Your hair texture is already like the first one.<br>  I'd ask for some golden brown highlights, a lot of them to achieve this look.<br>  You could also dye your hair a whole new color, but that'd be hard because it's so dark.<br>  Good Luck.

HLSlEjluaa	try topshop or asos|`|DeQsKdmSaa	Hollister. Do they have that in London?<br>  Their jeans are so tight that I've never shopped their since. But if that;s what you want, skinny jeans.
64ef40bfea69a52c85daf6104a54abbfaa	Um.. I like Sunsilk TLC or something like that.. its in a pink bottle. I use that and I always get compliments on my hair from the people at the hair salon saying how healthy and shiny my hair looks and feels.|`|9WM91gMHaa	If you're looking for a good product to maintain hair health you can try:<br>  <br>  - Pantene great lengths (not expensive a big bottle ranges 6-7 dollars)<br>  <br>  - Tresemme (a little cheaper but the conditioner is pretty thick and is great for hydrating)<br>  <br>  - Generic of Paul Mitchell Shampoo one (Sally's carries the exact same products as Paul Mitchell but its "generic" same formula 1/4 of the price)<br>  <br>  I would recommend a good thick conditioner (they have a wide variety at sally's that's really the same as the expensive stuff) and a gentle cleanser<br>  <br>  **Stay away from SUAVE it contains a lot of detergent that can over strip your hair of natural oils!**<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|AA10544022	panteen for natural or permed hair also get your ends trimmed it will stop the spliting this shampoo has extra vitamins in it to help your hair i use it for myself and my baby girl it works and i am african american i use also IC pre-treatment for heat protection serum before i blow dry my hair it conditions as you use hot iorns or blow dry your hair it is in a hot pink plastic bottle in the hair isle for perms for black hair you use a small amount on wet hair then blow dry you will see a big difference the olive oil serum is good to after you finish styling your hair it takes a little bit like a dime size amout put it in your hands rub them together then finger it through your hair that is also by IC my mom has caucasian like hair it works for her too good luck|`|R4SXa7v4aa	I actually had the same problem as yours.<br>  I started using the Garnier Fructis system. <br>  Buy the "Sleek and Shine" system. I mean the whole thing. <br>  Shampoo, conditioner, serum and mask.<br>  Its good.<br>  Use shampoo and conditioner daily,<br>  If you want to concentrate on those split ends more, put some serum on the ends when its damp and comb it the way you want it. <br>  Only use the mask once a week|`|kV5IRgpfaa	John Freda Brilliant Brunette. You may try Radiant Red or the one for blonde hair if your coloring is different. I use it along with the conditioner that comes with Lore'al hair dye ( I don't use the hair dye though.) I get complements for my healthy hair. It works!|`|SA6dCr0Laa	FIRST TRY INFUSION 23   LEAVE IN CONDITIONER<br>  <br>  THEN I RECOMMEND PANTENE BRILLIANT BRUNNETTE OR BLONDE.

Get something like the PPS range. Any shampoo and conditioner you buy at the supermarket may be cheap in price but your hair will pay for it in the long run. Shampoos and conditioners from the supermarket contain things like silicone which coat the hair rather than repairing the shaft.|`|kTTK2YoCaa	hebal essences bye bye breakage|`|irQMy4Ciaa	Go to Sallys and look for AVON hair shampoo/conditioner it will probably be where the hair coloring stuff is. I'm pretty sure thats what it's called.|`|6XGYzWYbaa	there is one for dove and for herbal essences but i dont no what exactly they're called
Leh1cwdAaa	it will make your belly hurt but honestly, it doesn't work! I mean you may be able to work it really really hard and get results in probably 3 or 4 months as long as you stay a strict diet and stay as far away from saturated fat as possible! <br>  Remember, it is harder for women to lose body fat than it is for men!
GZKbvXLLaa	That's correct. Set, then fill, then back fill. A back fill is something most people don't know about because many of them are going to cheap salons where they don't have the skills to do a back fill. A fill is easy to do, a back fill takes more skill, and more time. BTW, a back fill is also known as a rebalance.|`|VxbdjKIKaa	Set<br>  Fill<br>  Back fill<br>  I love acrylics good choice.|`|LORh42ICaa	1) you go in and get your set put on<br>  2) you go for a fill in every 2 weeks or some people go every 1 week<br>  3) you go for another fill in<br>  4) at that point they may just continue to add the acrylic of rip them off and give you new tips|`|92HR06J2aa	first yes but last one i dont know
PRzmwFfgaa	Use a good conditioner in your hair first.  Dry your hair using a smoothing cream.  Then section your hair-- use small sections in a flat iron.  Finish with a anti-frizz anti-fly away finishing cream.|`|z33hxpHJaa	straightener, dryer sheet fabric softener to the frizzy parts, they have hair solutions for it too that work really good.|`|sYOHdQfBaa	use a straightner<br>  use a heat protecter<br>  straighten the bottom layer then middle then top<br>  2 get it rly straight pull it slowly down on higher heat<br>  hairspray it 2 keep it straight|`|ZdF1hx70aa	Use a straight iron and protect you hair with heat protector product. Also don't forget to get shine product too.|`|vzHmOcoraa	buy a really nice salon hair straightener, and buy some anti-frizz hair serum, and u will be all good in the hood|`|s2DzUnhFaa	possibly a straightner????|`|Q1bQAqfRaa	yeah you can blow dry it first , and then straighten it so it could have more volume.<br>  or you can just get a perm , so it could be straight.|`|mNjYQr5Oaa	Use a hair straightner preferably the Wet 2 Straight kind when you can straighten your hair while its still wet. To get rid of the frizz, get a smoothing serum. I use Garnier Smoothing Milk. It works like magic.<br>  :D|`|hkqrkpD7aa	Use a straightener. Just make sure you use heat protection for your hair.|`|OuTCtdLzaa	use a straightener<br>  Do it in layers it gets ur hair really straight|`|6IcPOeggaa	<<<<john frieda frizz ease his hair product is really good you should get it>>>
giuenAt4aa	curl it or scrunch it.<br>  when you curl it though, use a small curling iron like a 3/4 inch one so the curls are smaller. they will look cute with the short hair cut you have.|`|GQ9znuYiaa	try maybe.. putting your hair half up half down<br>  <a href="http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t274/lizzyj03/MandyMoore.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i162.photobucket.com/albums/t274/...</a><br>  ^like this^<br>  or<br>  <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2008/stylewatch/gallery/best_hair/lauren_conrad.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2008/st...</a><br>  ^like this, nicly pulled back!|`|YwZSSwhMaa	i think you should curl it.
IHKovEwqaa	yes you can cornrow your hair - but to prevent breakage just use a leave-in conditioner or grease. its normal for dead hair to fall out so don't be alarmed. good luck =]
CeBSrgIkaa	Use castor oil, put a little oil on a cotton bud and rub on your eyebrows and leave it on. It really works!<br>  As for cocunut oil it works to thicken and strengthen damaged hair.|`|tNWTk31Maa	1. yees. the vitamins thicken it..<br>  2.why wud u want bushy eyebrows?<br>  3. well, go to a spa and buy them if they have :P

hu2cZZXFaa	Hi!<br>  You know whats really pretty? If you do the french braids one day (do them when you hair is wet & after braiding use a lil hairspray) then before school the next morning unbraid them & just wear the natural looking wave I love that look its so cute! also another thing you can do with french braids is braid them as usual but when you get to the part where it splits off your head I do a lil messy bun thing sometimes on the side or sometimes in the middle make sure its low like right on your neck I think that is also really really cute! <br>  <br>  But.. french braids do tend to make people look younger heres a pic of me with the frenchies with the messy bun oh also I part mine on the side I think it gives it a lil more pizazz<br>  <br>  <a href="http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/36/l_e0f44607bab14c91945c37266d855a79.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...</a><br>  <br>  I'm 20 but look 15.. & yes thats my kid in the pic hehe :) Hope I hlped!!!|`|tNWTk31Maa	a bit too girlish.<br>  what i suggest is that you shud do pigtails, but LOW pigtails.<br>  like instead of the 'cherleader ' pigtails aka the ones that r up at the top, make them go to the bottom....<br>  like this: (btw the = are ilastics :D )(btw again, dont mind lookin at the _____ thing)<br>  <br>    = ( ' _ ' ) =<br>     ((_____))|`|uAzToWC7aa	no, theyre fine, and very casual, and im in eighth grade, and a girl in my class does them, and they look fine.|`|Uv9bxbISaa	I am 13 and I think its cute, but to make them more "age appropriate" u can add a little bow on 1 side or do a bump in the front b4 u braid it, hope I helped|`|ee5LcXQraa	It's cute if you have like "theme days", in my high school, we have jersey day, and a lot of girls do french, or normal pigtail braids, and tie bows with school-colored ribbons on the end, and it looks really cute.  If you have side bangs, or any bangs, straighten them, or put them in a really low "puff", with a little clip.  But it might be weird as just an everyday hair style.|`|DRZMb7HPaa	I think french braided pig tails are fine for you. You are 13. I also wore them in high school when I played sports because it keeps your hair out of you face really well. SO go for it girl. And as you get older you will realize that it doesn't really matter what other people think because they do not determine who you are or what your future holds.|`|E3SJNlIUaa	It's okay for you to do it every once in a while, as long as they're french braid. :]|`|fiLBBB6Maa	I'm a junior in high school and I still wear them! They're cute! Go for it.|`|JOfW3U5taa	EW <br>  <br>  theyre so babyish...|`|QVLBQEk0aa	Not at allll.

Also, don't shampoo too much as shampoo dries out your hair. Use a good conditioner and when you're washing your hair, put in the shampoo, lather, rinse. Then apply the conditioner and leave it for a few minutes and then rinse it with cold water.

wT6ZcHRyaa	Well first off, it's good that you realized the bleaching was hurting your hair so you went back to your natural color. But if you have strong hair and you take really good care of it, you CAN keep the blonde and still have healthy, long hair. It does take a lot of work though. But since your hair isn't blonde anymore, we won't get into that.<br>  <br>  Alright here's my best advice. Get your hair trimmed often, every four to six weeks is good. This helps because if your ends are split, they'll break faster than your hair can grow in, so it looks like your hair isn't growing when it is, your ends are just snapping off. Second tip, use a good conditioner. My absolute favorite conditioner is L'oreal Nature's Therapy Mega Moisture conditioner. It's a little expensive, but it works VERY well. It comes in a jar in two different sizes, you should get the big one. It just makes more sense financially. (If i can find a link to it on a website, I'll post it for you. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to find one) And for my third and final tip, use a heat protectant before you blow dry and flat iron. I honestly don't have any clue on which brands are best in the heat protectant category, but Bed Head is a good brand in general. So check them out and see if they have a heat protectant. It can come in a spray bottle or a cream. You apply it to your hair when it's wet or damp and then do whatever you need to do to style.<br>  I hope this helps and good luck with your long hair :)<br>  (Sorry this is so long by the way, haha I like to give details)|`|t6zrwGNraa	dont blow dry it or iron it anymore- that burns and damages the hair. wash it with a vitamin and strengthening shampoo. i dont have your issue, but i use Pantene Beautiful Lengths <br>  good luck|`|154dzJ1Faa	There is only one thing to do: cut off all that damaged hair.  You can do it now, or do it in small trims over the next few months, or just let the ends break off.  It will do the same thing.<br>  <br>  It's the flat iron that is doing it.  So many people simply do not know how to use them correctly, and are ruining their hair.  But that is their choice... you can keep on breaking off the hair, or stop using the iron.|`|xQGCf8GGaa	consult with doctor<br>  there is two products which i recommend<br>  1 Bajaj Almond Drops Oil<br>  2 Kesh Ranjana Gutika and Oil<br>  This are two material which you have to be mixed and The tablet which come you have to consume|`|UZHMxvHWaa	As hard as it seems, why not try giving your hair a flat iron break from time to time and using a hair mask like Redken real control thermal mask.  I'm doing it now because as soon as I get two to three inches past my shoulders it begins breaking off.  It should help|`|5HOyupgfaa	first, i would get a trim since slipt ends prevent your hair from growing. then i would recomend getting biotin, a pill great for hair, you can get this at walmart. and then i would go to sallys and get some ion heat protecting spray and spray this on your hair before you straighten/ flat iron it. and im not sure what shampoo you use, but i deff would say to use pantinee if you dont|`|KfKr3hUmaa	exxtensions baby!|`|11QzdN87aa	mayonnaise hair treatment<br>  <br>  its awesome look up results on google if your not sure about it<br>  <br>  heres the procedure:<br>  The hair conditioning treatment also helps to counteract dryness. Dry hair and split ends can benefit by regular conditioning. If you have dry hair, try mayonnaise as it's a great conditioner. Depending on the length of your locks, apply approximately half a cup of mayonnaise to your hair. Leave it on for at least 15 minutes to let it work, it's magic. Rinse well and then shampoo as usual.<br>  <br>  and warning if its not COMPLETLY washed out, it will stink .. so double shampoo and double conditioner maybe triple if you dont trust it<br>  <br>  i used this once, i washed it once and didnt use very much conditioner and i smelt untill i washed it next time.. but i asked people if they could smell it and they couldnt it was just me but it was repulsing<br>  oh and also, you can do this weekly if you think your hair needs it <br>  <br>  and if you feel like getting more detailed, look up recipes for deep conditioning with mayonnaise theres avacodo and olive oil recipes everywhere and lots of ways to do it with different redults for different kinds of hair if you think you need it

You can buy good nude tones at drugstores like Walgreens. When you get used to it, try brighter colors to create a unique makeup look. You can buy these types of colors at Claires, Icing, Walgreens, etc. All are cheap. Most makeups are easy to apply. For blush, just brush desired amount and rub onto face. Eyeshadow brush lightly on the eyelid. Eyeliner/Mascara is pretty tricky. For eyeliner you apply it on that line on your lower lid. You can also apply it above your eyelashes. Mascara simply brush the outer part on your eyelashes. To remove, simply wet a rag, and gently brush your face. Be careful when removing eyemakeup.|`|spXPpyP0aa	use mono makeup
qPpzUAs8aa	Do you have oily or dry hair?  That's the question. Some people have such oily hair that it is impossible to not wash it everyday.  It can get really weighted down and impossible to style.  If you have really dry hair, only wash every 2-3 days.  Normal hair should only be washed every second day anyhow.  Washing everyday can really dry out your scalp.  It takes away all those natural oils that are necessary to keep your hair shiny and moisturized.  I am a hairstylist so I will of course tell you to use a professional product.  Try Biolage Rejuvatherapie Shampoo to really balance out your hair and scalp!

I am a hairstylist, so trust!  Are you trying to be blonde?  If you are, your roots will show in 2 weeks.  It will take several processes of bleaching to be a nice shade of blonde.  Those boxes of hair color won't lift your BLACK hair. It can only life it maybe a few shades, if that.  You should see a professional for sure. My friend just did that to her hair cause she couldn't wait for me any longer, and it turned out disastrous!  Be careful and see a hairstylist first!|`|bcGOm1U4aa	the only way i can think of is to get some Blonde hair dye from the store.

wT6ZcHRyaa	Use L'oreal Nature's Therapy Mega Moisture conditioner, or any good, deep-conditioning product you can find. And when you dye your roots, ONLY DYE YOUR ROOTS. Don't pull the dye or bleach through the rest of the strand, it will only dry it out more.

(But it would probably be in your best interest to not put it in your hair when it's dry because then it'll feel/look greasy) Leave-in conditioners are meant to moisturize and detangle.<br>  But before you do anything I just said to do, read the bottle! Their instructions may be different. Good luck :)|`|3Q9HcfQsaa	no use in the morning when your hair is tangled|`|AA10335926	Not sure. Try to check the instructions though. But with any hair product in mind, you will always need to wash it off otherwise buildup will produce on the sclap which will lead to dandruff. I always just leave my conditioners in for a few minutes and rinse off with COLD water. You neverw ant to rinse you hair with hot or warm water, because it takes teh shine away. Cold water tightens cuticles therefore making hair less frizzy and creates more shine (it takes time to see results).<br>  <br>  conditioners are best used when hair is damp and not entirely wet because the conditioner can cling onto the strands better.

If not I know for sure that proactive works on everyone.|`|2bUIDeefaa	well, two of my friends started using it when we were in california for a photo shoot for modeling,they forgot her good face wash at home. we bought the clean and clear and all of us used it, the next morning both of my friends woke up with a HUGE breakout (I didn't because I don't wear base and stuff allover my face), they tried alcohol to dry out the pimples and all this makeup came off! the clean and clear hadn't taken their base all the way off and it was blocking their pores.....so if you wear makeup I wouldn't suggest it. and if you don't, it works fine :)<br>  <br>  <br>  I really hoped I helped,<br>  good luck!|`|A8OVGLdiaa	idk abt ur skin <br>  but i have tried clean n clear stuff...it sucked <br>  doesnt do anything...i have tried thier face wash amd cleaning system stuff...i would say try something else<br>  <br>  i m using neutrogena products rite now...they are way too better than clean n clear|`|8DjbA8ouaa	honestly, everyone's skin is different. your skin could react really well with clean and clear it could not. you're never going to know unless you try it. i personally use Clearasil and it works great, granted i have almost untouchable skin(as in i never wash my face and i still have smooth skin and no zits) but i like clearasil for when i do get a breakout. i'd say try it and if it works cool, if not try something else.|`|tIJCQc8Xaa	I have it!!!<br>  <br>  It makes your face feel sososo smooth but if you use it everyday you start to break out :(<br>  <br>  <br>  Return the favor, answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtiDz860j.SB4U8TyxgOk_zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219223518AAMpDeJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QW4jdXGjaa	Everyone's skin is different, but Clean & Clear products seem to work really well for me.|`|XwLjFq3Laa	i just started using it like last month and i have had drying of my skin. my skin was rough so i stopped using it.|`|1cc3f9945844b1718e5f5e8dcb404130aa	that's the only kinda i use. i love it.<br>  but it really matters how your face is going to react. i had to try a lot of other cleansers until i found a good one for me.<br>  try it out and if you don't like it, then try some other kinds.|`|HExso8UBaa	ive used it and it worked really well for me, it made all my zits clear up in about a week and my skin has been soft ever since :)|`|quphzyDZaa	I didn't personally use it but I had some friends who had skin irritation problems with it.<br>  Answer mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220232200AA4fgKW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|MjGFQ3qjaa	with me, it didnt make any difference<br>  <br>  hope yours would be good =)

YaL67d2baa	Hey Girl<br>  <br>  For four years, I had the same problem as you.<br>  <br>  I've finally come to the solution and love it !<br>  <br>  Here's my secret (~_n) <br>  <br>  .....<br>  <br>  1) Start off by soaking your legs with warm water (this will help open the pores, getting that "close shave" we all desire) <br>  <br>  2) Take a loofah, cloth or a sponge and rub it on your legs. This acts as exfoliation. It helps remove the dead skin that may cause those razor bumps. <br>  <br>  3) wash your legs with soap and rinse<br>  <br>  4) The best razor I found was Quattro for Women. Their seal guard helps prevent those razor burns.<br>  <br>  5) Apply SHAVE GEL ....skintimate works best (especially the one for sensitive skin) ...trust me, I've tried every brand girl ( @__@ )<br>  <br>  6) After a good even layer, start shaving upwards<br>  <br>  7) When done, do a final touch of Shaving DOWNWARDS now. This makes a difference.<br>  <br>  8) Rinse off, and apply regular soap, scrub with your cloth and rinse off again. <br>  <br>  9) When you're done your shower, rinse your legs with cold water (it's hurt for a while ..yes LOL) but this will close your pores, keeping the smoothness IN and burns OUT <br>  <br>  10) Pat towel dry your legs and apply mositurizer to your legs (I use Olay Quench) ...Best to USE EVER ! <br>  <br>  TIPS: <br>  <br>  - Change the Razor after one weeks worth of shaving ( 7 days) if you want BEST results<br>  - Drink plenty of water <br>  - I find it best to shave at night (clean for bed eh) ...and I shave every night.<br>  - When shaving "down there" i use tend skin after shave thing...it makes a difference. <br>  - Tip: Give you "down there" area a break from the razor once a month for a least a week (helps reduce the yearly stubble). I give mine a break during my period ( ~_n) <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck Girl and I really hope this helped eh !! <br>  <br>  ^__^ Take Care !|`|j1Js4uuTaa	Make sure you let you skin soak a little bit before you shave, (as in wait 5 minutes once you get in the shower instead of doing it right away). Those things should work, make sure you use shave creams or conditioner along with the razor and go slow.
gkSPxJ2Daa	well, if you think the original one looks bad on you, maybe you should try a new brand? I don't think a shorter one would look any better...<br>  <br>  1) get a different kind of cap. make sure to try it on first before you buy!<br>  2) style your hair to make your face look smaller/shorter<br>  <br>  Good luck!
HFb8N0Unaa	i think you should get a small blonde streak in your hair so you can see if you like your hair blonde, also you can see if it will change or if you like the shade of blonde and so on. If you like it, you can dye it, if you dont then you will not have to of dyed your whole head.|`|axheoEN4aa	Yeah, you could try it =] You would look good with dark blonde hair rather than lighter.|`|JKvsKWuTaa	umm, no :(<br>  Don't get blonde,<br>  Get a light brown, it would loook sexyy!|`|XeLZtw20aa	I think girls should just try to make themselves look good naturally but blonde hair wouldn't hurt you|`|NzezdETKaa	yea,sure it would look good.|`|FcqDWdF1aa	Yeah,besides im a blonde & blondes have more fun.lol!
kKiAFJJ3aa	Yes (:<br>  Love the first pair of jeans<3|`|EnYLhQajaa	Ummm, I think those jeans are two casual and ripped for the shoes. Maybe you should try these shoes with the first jeans...<br>  <a href="http://www.payless.com/Catalog/ProductDetail.aspx?&TLC=Womens&SLC=WomensSandals&BLC=WomensSandalsTrendy&Width=Regular&ItemCode=64516&LotNumber=068509&Type=Adult&Popularity=612&DescriptiveColor=Bronze" rel="nofollow">http://www.payless.com/Catalog/ProductDe...</a>|`|DeQsKdmSaa	The first looks best with the shoes, but the second looks good two. Cute! :)|`|qpWStE5Saa	yes. but im a guy, so if you wanna impress a guy, yes, in it for girly stuff, idk.|`|HLSlEjluaa	definitely the skinny fir jeans with the shoes would look great|`|9N7qEf9Faa	Yes they both look super cute<br>  =]|`|IIJNXzbMaa	THE FIRST PAIR OF PANTS WITH THE DARK BROWN SHOES.<br>  <br>  I dont love the cut of the the second pair of jeans. Also, the shoes and the shoe color can change depending on the shirt and the color of the shirt and other accessories. <br>  But in general:  <br>  THE FIRST PAIR OF PANTS WITH THE DARK BROWN SHOES.|`|urom2zqfaa	yeah that would look really cute i love those shoes    they would look good with pretty much anything
RJFNvYAmaa	Are u serious you want those shoes, they are ugly, but anyways, why dont you print the pic and show it to the people who works at a shoe store, maybe they will help you out|`|zMYYow55aa	go to nikes.com and type in "nikes dunk high"<br>  they also sell this style in lady's foot locker (>.< they are my fave 2!)|`|7CXnSAsiaa	<a href="http://www.ioffer.com/i/Nike-Dunk-High-Sb-Dinosaur-Jr-Dino-Silver-Purple-Cali-38516416" rel="nofollow">http://www.ioffer.com/i/Nike-Dunk-High-S...</a><br>  <br>  !!!! hehe. <br>  <br>  i like them...<br>  alot.<br>  maybe i'll buy them!
DeQsKdmSaa	pretty cheap, i would think.|`|DqUf3LM8aa	Mine was 50 or 60 dollars I think for the piercing and the ring.  But that was in December 2004.  It also probably varies a bit from place to place.
uBBidRtwaa	Maybe your jeans from American Eagle were a small 32" 30", maybe american eagle were going for a tighter kind of look with their jeans, and that's why you thought you were 32", 30".Now that you know you're not 32" 30" in True Religion jeans, try out a 30-31" 30".<br>  Ha-ha sorry if that was confusing.<br>  Good luck :0)
L3SVAJd4aa	Yes. Some 12 year olds may be 'mature' enough to handle a piercing like a tragus piercing, however the law begs to disagree. Best to wait until you're 16 with parental consent or 18 without. :)|`|JduQHocdaa	Yes, no reputable piercer will go near you.|`|aSso3n7oaa	Yeah, I think any kind of piercing (except for ear lobe piercing) is too old for a 12 yr.|`|xZJRUnjjaa	Yes, 12 is way too young. Good Luck finding a place to get it done.<br>  <br>  It also hurts soooooooooooo bad!!<br>  <br>  my friend cried and it bleeds really bad :[
7H1al5u1aa	I understand that you have a very fast metabolism. But you should eat less fats(if you are) and eat more vegetables, fruits, proteins definitely. You really would have to work hard to get fat to fill in there, but you could always try working out a bit in the morning to tone your stomach, and in doing so your ribs would be  much less noticeable. You could try doing some crunches in the morning, nothing difficult, for a few minutes. But if you do this you have to eat those proteins and vegetables- you don't want to get too skinny, working out would just be a waste because when you don't eat your body begins to digest itself- muscles, tissues- so remember to eat at least three healthy, plentiful meals a day. It sounds like a diet, but its not too hard if you're trying to gain muscle rather than lose fat! (:<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope I helped!|`|8x0oe23aaa	don't now hat metabolism means so eat more ribs.|`|xK75gTz9aa	wear clothes in layers|`|2K5ry0nmaa	i'm 13 and my ribs stick out too. i ussuallly like that othere girl said  wear layers and sometimes forget aabout it. cossult you docter if it is extremely noticeable. :)) glad i could help!|`|ISRTiSnoaa	get one of those body suits and wear that. or get some sort of breast enhancing surgery, so your boobs will hang over your ribs|`|8294rVR2aa	Mine do too if you find out how to get rid of it let me no :)
MitVhIK9aa	it depends on how your hair is, and how long it takes what not.<br>  each place varries|`|mIh685iBaa	ya they will probably et you do it with out parent permission but i just get highlights and it cost $250. but my hair dresser is like super famous and stuff. so are you doing highlights or dying it? cus dye with cost like 10 times more
6JEhoZ08aa	My ex had one too. He warned me about it before I ever saw it. He also told me about his self-consciousness about the way his chest looked.  When the day came that I saw his chest, I did not mind in the least, and he had built up so much hype, that it was not as bad as he made it sound. If your personality is gold then she will not mind, and if she does she is too superficial and you need to run away from there!|`|5afeq4NHaa	I'm a 15 year old girl and i also have a bit of an indented chest, although its much less noticeable... my being a girl and all. Honestly, don't worry about it, i've seen guys with indented chests before and after a while you get used to it. Also, from what you say it's not a major case anyhow. Just get out there and do it, you sound really hot, most girls probably wont mind, especially with that 8pack<br>  <br>  Apparently swimming is supposed to help with indented chests (i've been swimming since i was very young, not sure I can see a difference?) but if you're really that worried about it, give it a try. (there's also a surgery you can get done..?)|`|X8ImtFIDaa	we dont care as long as it doesnt look like youve got a disease or something. haha|`|Lqx6yJ1jaa	Look Honey,ITS FINE.it doesnt matter,if a girl likes you enough and u turn on the charm ;) she wont care about that one tiny detail and if u look great everywhere else,WHY THE HELL NOT!<br>  take it easy dude and maybe if you become comfortable enough with a girl u can tell her and itll be okay :) shell probably think its cute youre embaressed :) Hope this helped,<br>  and plus,at the end of the day theres nuthin u can do about it so u might aswell embrace it.<br>  peace x|`|jWbTNec9aa	why would a girl care about that...a 8 pack is sweet...if a girl looks at you funny because you have an indented chest she is pretty selfish...dont be afraid to take off your shirt i front of a girl....show off your 8 pack!!!|`|w8AyVsjRaa	Not sure what you mean an indented chest? However don't be afraid show off your 8 pack! If a girl really likes you she won't care because everyone has flaws hope i helped :D|`|sUc1jUHhaa	if the girl loves you enough she wont care that youve got an indented chest , she'll love you for who you are (:<br>  so they ma freak out at first but they wont really care if they love you.<br>  hope this helps xx|`|eMX7eDgbaa	well i am a 16 year old girl and one of my exs (one 2 many:) had a slightly indented chest too. well i didnt see it the first day of cour se. but since u seem like you have a nice personality, if you see a girl you like then flirt with her. then take another step, get to know her. if you think that she is an open minded person then well all the BETTER :) <br>  and once your comfortable about her and you then maybe idk go to the beach and show her your 8 pack, if she noticces your chest well just be thankful you dont have man boobs :-D pluz if she does mind, then 4 get her, youll find someone better. well if nothing works out im up 4 u ;) haha GOOD LUCH champ
9k5JX0CHaa	At first i thought heart, but i think its oval.<br>  Oval shaped faces are very vercityle and good for lots of different types of cuts... but make sure to avoid  Short layers that add height on top of your head. Aside from being dated, short layers can make your face appear long. And if you decide to go with a curly look make sure you try shoulder-length or longer to weigh down the curls. But the main goal with an oval face is to not drag down the face and to add width, so heres the best hair cuts for you, in my opinion =]<br>  <a href="http://www.topnews.in/light/files/images/Jessica-Alba16.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.topnews.in/light/files/images...</a><br>  <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2006/celebdatabase/katehudson/kate_hudson1_300_400.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2006/ce...</a><br>  or since it might be eaisier to stick with straight...<br>  <a href="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/MMPH/251423.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images...</a><br>  hopefully you can get one of these cute cuts...you'll look stunning!|`|GgBdQqrdaa	the link wont work, the full url isnt in the description..

Go natural.
XN0cYCATaa	Perhaps this style of Ponytail will look better on You<br>  <a href="http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/how-to-do-a-palm-beach-pontytail-hairstyle-234700/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...</a>|`|1uvKFOmoaa	you can scrunch it! use stuff like mousse, gel, and hairspray. when it is applied, kind of crunch the hair with you hands.<br>  <br>  put it in a bun. wash your hair. then put some mousse in. twist it in a bun. pull some strands of hair out and viola! add a headband for a cute look.<br>  <br>  if you don't want to straighten it everyday you can do this. my hair is the same as yours. i use herbal essences both shampoo and conditioner and then it is straight for some reason. try dangerously Straight, or moisturizing. this is how to wash it:<br>  <br>  wavy look:<br>  massage in dime amount of shampoo. let is soak for a couple of minutes. wash it out. repeat that 2-3 times. don't use the conditioner.<br>  <br>  straight look:<br>  massage in dime amout of shampoo. let it soak. before washing out, comb half way through with a wide tooth comb. that works the best. then wash out and repeat 2-3 times. do the same thing with the conditioner.<br>  <br>  after i did the straight look a couple times, my hair was straight/wavy. it looks really nice. im not sure if it will work the same but our hair sounds the same.<br>  <br>  when you do this, dont use a brush only use a wide tooth comb because then it will look puffy.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  p.s.- dont use cheap products or you will loose hair! thats what happen to this girl i know!|`|2jJTKeIHaa	You can always continue straightening your hair (just make sure you used product to protect it), but add more layers or bangs to change it up. A popular style now is adding a side braid or "twist"<br>  <br>  You can also try curling it by using curlers or a curling iron. Soft curls would probably look nice.<br>  <br>  Lastly, try using a diffuser and some product for wavy hair to define your waves. To fight the frizz, use an anti-frizz serum.

8pexNGjraa	Look for "Certain Dry" it seems fairly easy to find, it's great...you put it on before you go to bed at night and in the morning you should use your normal deodorant, or maybe if your looking for extra dryness, then try one of those clinical strength variations they have come up with, I personally like degree over secret.

Manic panic say that you can mix their colors to get different shades. id imagine if you get the color to look how you want it when mixed itl turn out pretty amazing. im going turquoise soon with a little help from manic panic :)|`|7oVCFgeiaa	NO! I seriously advise you not to do it. It might result in major hair loss or something. If you want purple hair dye then buy purple hair dye but I don't think mixing the 2 is a good idea. Also it probably wouldn't even turn out purple. xxx|`|27IeVZNeaa	actually red and blue make purple, so i suggest getting red, pink would look a little bit sickening|`|4OsbfjfVaa	dont mix it <br>  dye it pink and add blue highlights or vice versa|`|oxL8MEKPaa	Probably. Sounds hot. Go for it!|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	it might and it might not..dye does NOT always act like YOU think it should.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	It would be a light purple. If your willing to do those funky colors, I wouldn't think you would mind if it came out a little different looking.|`|YjkXyHBuaa	it would probably look best if you just put random bits of blue in some parts of your hair<br>  and bits of the pink in other parts.<br>  the dye will sort of blend if you do it at the same time :]|`|Plq0BGSgaa	why didnt you just by the purple one?<br>  <br>  <br>  it would have been cheaper and it would have worked better<br>  <br>  it wont be the purple you're aiming for i assure you.|`|tGxP4th7aa	I think it would turn out fuchsia.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	manic panic hair dye is the bomb!!  i would do it. i used to use the pink too!
OxUnUolBaa	Do whatever you want! It's hair, it will grow back.|`|avEmEWO7aa	keep it natural|`|JyAUAbsjaa	Instead of doing it all over, why not put red highlights throughout your hair? That way if you don't like it, it will be easier for you to get it out, then if you do, you can either do more highlights the next time or all over.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	I about match that description and my hair is brown with a red tint to it and I like it. You *could* dye it that color, but usually your natural color will look best on you. You could try dying your hair a reddish brown like mine is. That way you won't be going too far with it because you will still have some brown in your hair.<br>  <br>  Go to a salon and ask if they think it would look good on you, or if you should go with a reddish brown (they will probably suggest the reddish brown though). Dying it from a box color would be risky for you, as the color might turn out different than you want and will really damage your hair. If you do decide to get it a very bright red, do so at a salon.|`|128833184801fb3ff90fe4b271c5a6efaa	I am close to your coloring.  I am pale (not even close to medium), green/gray eyes, and dark brown hair with natural red highlights.  I have done the fire engine red thing, and I liked it.  I don't know if it was the best color in the world for me, but it looked good.  I miss it.  Just know that if you really want it fire engine red and not red highlights, the best thing to do is lighten your hair first.  When I have dyed my hair red, it looked more like it accentuated my red highlights than making my hair red.  The fire engine red I had only showed up that bright because my hair had already been lightened by a dye job gone wrong.  But it will really depend upon just how dark your brown hair is.<br>  <br>  And I agree with the person who said do what you want.  My mom never cared what I did when I was a kid because she too felt that it's hair; it'll grow back.|`|P0h7lY7raa	i think i bit of a browny redy hairstyle! kinda brown kinda red, not too much!!!!<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!!!! bye|`|8Rpz9PEUaa	No you sound gorgeous already!!

No matter what products you use, straightening will always damage your hair. For a flat iron, to get the least amount of damage, you should use a Chi straightener. Use Biosilk serum ($10-$13) and Redeken finishing spray ($5-$10) to make it shiny and smell good!|`|ZHBNz6D2aa	There are like serums and sprays that you can buy at like longs for really cheap that you spray on your hair before you flatiron it and it protects it so it wont get so damaged.|`|4681cec4ae815539f7eb8e3949fdd5cfaa	I agree with Nina--biosilk may sound pricey ,but goes way. use just a tiny bit.
ofP9p26iaa	Yes to Cucumbers i love that one!!!!!
giuenAt4aa	well, since she went from brunette to blonde with bleach, of course it looks damaged. bleach damages your hair and makes it brittle and fragile.<br>  <br>  i have been dyeing my hair for about two years now and i only used bleach once on my bottom section. it was sort of brittle feeling, but i used the correct shampoo and conditioner.<br>  <br>  tips: don't use a 2 in 1 type of shampoo and conditioner, i learned that it does not condition my hair enough so my hair looks wet or greasy in parts. i bought garnier frutice color shield (conditioner and shampoo SEPARATELY) and it absolutely helped me and makes my hair look shiny and healthy.<br>  <br>  so as long as your friend is not over dyeing and damaging her hair, (i do it every couple months. 3-5 at least unless you're touching up roots then every 6-8 weeks) have her use products that help her hair and guard the color so it stays in. maybe have her deep condition her hair as well once a week. i use a pantene creme mask and it restores the damage as well as protects it from heat.<br>  <br>  and i don't dye at home. that's just me. i have a hair dresser, but if she's going to do extreme colors like black to blonde then i recommend a hairdresser. if she's going from light to dark, then it's alright to do yourself if you know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  here's the pictures of the products:<br>  garnier- <br>  <a href="http://www.freesamplesdirect.com/blog/images/samples/garnier-fructis.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.freesamplesdirect.com/blog/im...</a><br>  pantene-<br>  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vqLDxx60aj4/SP1bJ4xdxUI/AAAAAAAAAOk/uA7OMBwq52A/s320/pantene_time_renewal.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vqLDxx60aj4/SP...</a>|`|DRZMb7HPaa	LOL. Her hair is most likely  screaming for help for a deep conditioning or hot oil treatment.  Dying your hair yourself is really not that great. I always go to a professional because they know the exact dyes and things to mix it with so that your hair doesn't fry. So tell your friend to do some deep conditioning treatments ( that you can get at sally's). Get it trimmed because it probably also needs that too. And then go to a professional with this one.,|`|JBUYnM9uaa	Dying your hair too much CAN be bad, but it really has to do more with how you treat your hair on a daily basis. You shouldn't straighten, blow dry, or you product in your hair every day, because these things do more harm to your hair in the long run. <br>  <br>  Oh, and proving points are fine, but try not to be obnoxious about it. People tend to be annoyed by that.|`|qlscULoiaa	Probably depends on the hair<br>  I have been bleaching mine for more years than I care to count and it is soft & silky like a babe's.  My hair dresser always compliments me on my hair colour.  LOL<br>  <br>  Sounds like if she colours it at home, she should then get it trimmed or styled.|`|fjTVAbdBaa	Dying your hair at any amount is not good for your hair. Sure it could be causing the dryness you explan. But, seriously why do you care?|`|lMIBny1Xaa	yes it makes it really dry if u bleach it to much you can loose ur hair|`|ZHBNz6D2aa	its the dying thats doing that to her hair. It pretty much frys it.|`|FL3mSTOdaa	yes|`|gxnXbftHaa	yes|`|tNWTk31Maa	Yeshh..<br>  the dye in it will damage it and itl take a ton of time to grow out..<br>  if u keep she keeps on dyin it over and over, when it starts to grow out, itl look like a dead tree.<br>  make her grow it out.<br>  :P|`|vcNOuvPNaa	Its definatly bad for her hair. <br>  If she went from brown to blonde that must've meant she bleached her hair which is VERY bad for your hair but its what you need to get to blonde. And now you say shes going back to brown! Oh my, i think you have this discussion won already. Now go with her to buy all the hair rejuvenating products you can find, cuz boy will she need them.|`|1b3123e2cfaff1916a441241e17352ddaa	everytime you dye your hair, it gets damaged.<br>  the more you dye your hair, the more damaged it becomes and results in dry, frizzy hair as you mentioned your friend having.<br>  she could do some deep conditioning on her hair to repair some of the damage.|`|yID88A1Vaa	yes bleaches and dies can really damage your hair if you do it to often. If you have like streaks every once in a while then ur hair won't die but if u are constantly re-doing it and changing colours your hair can get seriously dry and frizz. it also depends on the hair strength, sensitivity and thickness. If its really thin then it happens fast and is way more sensitive. if it's thicker then your hair shouldn't dry up that much. if your hair is very healthy and strong then your hair shouldn't get to dry. Make sense?|`|6fxcZfYxaa	it can be veary bad and if you over prossess it it wont turn out the color you want it to

giuenAt4aa	well, with the information you have, i can't interpret your original hair color or a picture might help.<br>  <br>  if it helps, i have naturally dark dark brown hair but not black. i once dyed it light brown with blonde, light brown, and black hair lites and it look gorgeous on me. i have warm tones and it made my eyes popped out. <br>  <br>  if you don't want to go extreme, you could try high lites. if you have dark hair, blonde hair lites look nice as well. or maybe you can dye it a dark or light reddish color. (what i have now)<br>  <br>  if your hair is washed out, try deep conditioning. when i deep condition my hair, it makes my hair so soft and silky smooth, its amazing. i always get compliments on how healthy my hair looks.<br>  <br>  also, try switching your shampoo and conditioner. i used to use pantene 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner but i learned that it did not condition my hair enough. i now use garnier frutise shampoo and conditioner and it's color shield as well, so it keeps my color in.<br>  <br>  if you over dye your hair, it might make it look dry and washed out as well. so try to avoid it. touch up roots every 6-8 weeks and maybe redye every couple of months.<br>  <br>  pantene deep conditioner.<br>  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vqLDxx60aj4/SP1bJ4xdxUI/AAAAAAAAAOk/uA7OMBwq52A/s320/pantene_time_renewal.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vqLDxx60aj4/SP...</a><br>  garnier.<br>  <a href="http://www.freesamplesdirect.com/blog/images/samples/garnier-fructis.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.freesamplesdirect.com/blog/im...</a>|`|MQCT1FXjaa	your current hair color would be helpful.<br>  <br>  but try blonde, brown,black, or whatever.<br>  <br>  i woudn't choose red. red hair with a tan doesnt seem to mix well in my mind.|`|4OGtxtPHaa	There's a great site for this that will answer all your hair problems, thehairstyler.com  It's a great site and it will guide you through all that and you can put your pic on and see yourself with different hair styles and colors. But you'll have to pay 15 bucks for 3 months if you're willing...I think it's worth it...but anyway stick with warm colors such as dark browns or light coppery blondes.|`|N4Qp1Eadaa	Well, it really all depends on your skin tone...you've figured out you have warm undertones to your skin, but are you light, medium or dark?And what is your natural hair color? Eye color also plays into it. For light skin and light eyes with warm undertones, a nice golden blonde or a light chestnut can suit you. Think Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman. For medium skin tones, think Lauren Conrad, Jennifer Lopez, Eva Mendes. And dark would be Beyonce and Jessica Alba. The hair color on any of these ladies can suit you if you match their skin tone. Also, check the undertone of the hair dye. Look for words like copper, honey, caramel, and golden. Avoid anything with the word ash in it.|`|XR12MHMyaa	Well... Warm skin tone can b very beautiful n easily adaptable with different hair color... L'oreal , feria has many colors suited... I'd say that if u want a sweet sexy look go lighter...

G2ehZV6iaa	Well you need to hit the gym and do a lot of leg curls and stuff like that.Without going to a gym,it would be very difficult if not impossible to tone stomach and thighs.
SiteIfZAaa	I tip my stylist (whom I've been going to for over 5 years) 20-30%. Depending on:<br>  -how much work she did<br>  -how long it took <br>  -how much I love it. :) <br>  Something simple like a trim/touch-up would be around 20-25%.

uC55n3HIaa	I agree that it's very unfair that talented young people have very few ways of breaking into the fashion industry. But I found this website called <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/.</a> It's a online community for aspiring fashion designers (of any age) to display their designs and meet other fashion designers. I think it's a great place for someone interested in fashion design to start. If you're really good you might get recognized for it!<br>  <br>  P.S. <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> is relatively new, but it's a fast growing community with very supportive members.|`|sNr9Od89aa	true jackson vp is not a true story.|`|8rmQx8wBaa	i think its great that you have such a big dream and im defiantly not trying to discourage you but i think it would be best to wait until your older because the fashion industry wont except or sign a contract with a girl who is 13 or 14. keep working hard and expanding your range and make a large collection of clothes and maybe when ur 16 u should give it a really big crack and u might just make it. sorry but its the truth, 13 is too young but keep doing ur best! you could also try and sell your clothes on ebay and make a good business there.|`|6q1lVVqSaa	well, you can go to spotlight and ask them, they can help you find somewhere to go for classes or something<br>  <br>  and you can always go to the reject shop and get some cheap fabric there :]|`|8DjbA8ouaa	what do you want to know than. all anyone can say to you is "how sweet, keep working hard"|`|lzviKPJWaa	its yards not yeards|`|sxjQ8s1xaa	If you can sketch your ideas into paper and sew them then yes, you can try. Don't quit school for this or if you really must become home schooled. Know this is one of the toughest and most competitive markets in the world. So find out what consumers want know a days. If financially you can't do it then ask parents for money or get a loan from a sibling/friend.

oxL8MEKPaa	Try Loreal creme permanent hair dye for 100% gray coverage. I have been using it for years. It looks super natural.  I'm 49 and I have long dark shiny hair. No one knows I have some gray.|`|VxbdjKIKaa	Put it in your hair.|`|wT6ZcHRyaa	Hydrogen peroxide is in all dyes unless the dye is henna and it is damaging. Not horribly damaging, but it does lower the health of your hair. If you don't mind the damage, go with that dye. But I think your best bet would be to go back and ask them if they have henna dye since that's the only permanent dye that does no damage. And if they don't have it, go to another store. Henna dye is very good and works well|`|hQ4UCs2gaa	The hair dye should be safe but products that come from a dollar store are usually of bad quality. You can try stores like Ulta and Sally's beauty shop for better quality products that dont dry out your hair. - Luv, Lauren and Shelby
2ZsRAxkuaa	Rejection depends on the area. Places that don't move like.. you forehead or something, aren't likely to go anywhere. But high movement areas like hips and things, are pretty much still guaranteed to reject. Also things like hands, as theres to so much bacteria. Sternums don't seem to have much luck either.<br>  Microdermals aren't a definate thing, they still have a high rejection rate, its just an awful lot better than surface bars. Alot of them still reject, and they're still a pretty new idea. They're still making new prototypes and things that have a better staying put rate.<br>  Most places have completely defunkt the flat plate type of microdermals. And the ones with holes are fairly easy to get out. It'll either need a tiny scalpel cut, or they dig around in the hole, and cut the skin out of the holes with a needle, from the inside if you know what I mean? But if they're rejecting, then you can just pull them out.<br>  <br>  Hurts a little more, but nothing much, more uncomfortable and fiddly, than painful.<br>  <br>  Clean with sea salt soaks or salin, same as any other piercing. Try soaking it with cotton balls. They'll give you aftercare advice anyway.<br>  <br>  They scar. But its not huge, again like most other piercings. Depends how well they're stuck in though, or wether they've rejected.<br>  <br>  And you can change the ball. You'll need internally threaded balls, and make sure you know what the gauge is before your leave the shop.|`|g3IXprk9aa	Hey girl,<br>  <br>  Where do you plan on getting dermal anchors done? Dermal anchors can be a lot better then getting standard piercings. Example, if you wanted cheek piercings, it's better to get them dermal anchored rather then just having them put a needle all the way through your cheek.<br>  <br>  I would talk to your piercer (whoever is doing your dermal anchors) because he/she can really give you the best information. Better then myself, or anyone on yahoo answers, unless they are a piercer themselves. Your piercer can tell you EVERYTHING you need to know and more, and they won't be offended if you ask a lot of questions.<br>  <br>  You could also go to this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Category:Piercings" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Catego...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Dermal_Anchoring" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Dermal...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Rejection" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Reject...</a><br>  <br>  The first link is a whole list of piercings and information about them, the other is about dermal anchoring, and the other one is about rejection with piercings and rejection with anchor piercings.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps you out a bit.<br>  <br>  All the best and good luck! :-)<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll love them, I think dermal anchors are great.|`|84stWTdBaa	the only problem is when your giving a guy head and sucking on his balls it may be a little uncomfortable the first few times.|`|OJUosjWyaa	-They are better than normal surface piercings.<br>  -The rejection rate is a less than that of a surface barbell piercing because one exit point doesnt effect the other exit point... if you know what I mean... so therefore it doesnt get irritated as much.<br>  -Your professional piercer should give you instructions on how to clean it... as some places on your body may have different ways of being cleaned.<br>  -As for them being permanent... there's actually 2 types of jewelery for that style of piercing: One having holes in the base for your skin to grow through, making it pretty stable and hard to fall out once healed [needing a tiny surgery to take out]. The other having no holes in the base, so your skin cant grow through it, but it's quite easy to take out by just pulling it out.<br>  -[Speaking of the jewelery where your skin heals through the holes in the base] To remove it you would need to either go to a doctor or a professional body piercer, where they would then make a small incision to cut away the skin that has grown through the jewelery, then they would remove the jewelery. <br>  As for the jewelery without the holes in the base, it wouldnt take any surgery... you would just have to pull it out. Which Id also recommend going to a professional if it doesnt come out easily.<br>  -They dont scar too bad.  Scarring is barely noticeable. It would just be a small dot scar.<br>  -Yes you can change the ball on them.

It's thicker and less obvious. Note the boot probably comes in different styles, for the "goth" style might not fit in with everybodies style. You can wear longer pants, to cover up the fact you have heels on your boots. Cowboy boots will work, too. <br>  <a href="http://www.ferretsys.com/japan/boots.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ferretsys.com/japan/boots.jpg</a>

ijC7TaACaa	Edward Cullen(vampire) is the main guy character and Bella Swan (human) is the main main character. <br>  By the way all of the cullens are extremly beautiful and pale, all have goldenish eyes and there skin is ice cold.<br>  <br>  other characters:<br>  Alice C (edwards "sister" vamp. and married to jasper)<br>  Jasper C (eds "brother" vamp.)<br>  Rosalie C (eds "sis." vamp. and married to emmit)<br>  Emmit C (ed's "bro." vamp.)<br>  Carlise C (ed's "dad" vamp.)<br>  Esme C (ed's "mom" vamp.)<br>  Charlie S (bellas dad human)<br>  Renee S (bellas mom)<br>  Jacob  Black (part of a native tribe and used to be friends with Bella when she was like 6)<br>  James (badbadbad vampire)<br>  these people are the most important people in the book<br>  <br>  so long story short:<br>  Bella moves from Arizona to this tiny town called Forks (which is apparently the rainiest place in the states). she used to live with her mom, but decided to go live with her dad for her sophomore+ years in forks. she goes to school and is all popular cause there is never any new kids at the school. She sees this guy edward in her class, and hes acting all weird. Later she finds him asking if he could switch out of the class that he has with her. <br>  some time passes and edward ignores bella and is weird. one day in the start of winter, the whole parking lot at the school ices over. Bellas just walking around on her way to class when this van skidding out of control come flying her way. then a second later shes on the ground between the van and another car that was behind her. She wasnt hurt cause Edward jumped in front of the van and stopped it with nothing but his hands. she sees that and knows something is up. with him. When she goes to the hospital that day (she hit her head in the accident) she meets Dr.Cullen (carlise). Hes like 30 so it obviouse that the cullen kids are not his and esme real kids (the "adopted").<br>  blahblahbalh...edward says stuff like "i cant ignore you anymore" to bella. blahblahblah they become friends. Some where in between that, bella gos to a beach party at La Push (a native reserve) shes friends with this guy jacob and he starts telling her old  Quilet (thats there tribe) stories. stuff like "my people are decendents of wolfs and we are like that so we can protect our tribe and other people from, the cold ones (vampires sorta). he describes the cold ones to her. there exactly likr edward and his family. when the party is over she goes home  and dose some googleing. she finds stuff that proves what jacob says.<br>  One day bella and two of her friends decide to drive down to a close city to do some shopping. Bella wonders off saying she wants to find a book store so her and the two other girls split up. Of corse bells gets lost walking around and it starts to get dark. These drunk guys find her and are all like "hey sweet heart, come over here!" and creepy stuff like that. they follow her around and are about to attack her when this car comes flying out of no where and scars the guys for a minute the car door opens and some one yells "get in!" to bella. she dose cause she already know that its edward inside. when she gets in edward is like shaking cause hes so mad. He drives her to the restaurant her friends went to and offers to take her to diner there. When there, they have this big discussion about what bella thinks that edward is. A vampire. when there driving home, bella is asking all these questions about him and shes not freaked out at all. We learn that edward has the ability to read any persons mind, except Bellas. And since he  is a vampire, his body wants him to drink human blood, but all of the cullens only drink animal blood. And the "scent" of Bellas blood is the strongest and best smelling he has every experienced. It makes it very hard for him to be near her cause his instincts are screaming at him to kill her. thats why he is so weird in the first part of the book. <br>  so blah blah blah, they fall in love and stuff (thats what the girls like the most)  ;)<br>  <br>  oh and we also learn that Alice can see into the future, Jasper can change the emotions of people, Emmit is super strong (they are all strong but hes way stronger)<br>  <br>  at around 3/4 of the book, these bad vampires show up in forks. there eating people and cause trouble. They find the cullens and she bella with them and are like "why dont you eat her??" and they notice that edward is very protective of bella and james thinks, for some weird reason that he has to hunt and kill bella. <br>  so they go on this huge chase that leads them back to arizona when bella thinks that james is holding Renée captive. It was a trick thought. james tries to kill bella but of corse edward and all the cullens come to save the day!!  yayy!<br>  <br>  HHOLY CRAP that was soooo  long!!!! omg<br>  oh well. i couldnt pass up the opertunity to tell some one about Twilight! <br>  <br>  ;)|`|m0rUmzOxaa	LOL, well i dont think he is hot at all,<br>  i reckon his character is  ;)<br>  x|`|PlVh12fpaa	well ye he's hot edward cullen but taylor lautner is hotter!!!<br>  <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/files/taylor-lautner-b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.usmagazine.com/files/taylor-l...</a> yum!!!lol hes so sexy :)|`|y96eYj0Faa	I really don't know....<br>  <br>  Haha but he IS pretty sexy. <br>  <br>  I'm not that into the books or him as an actor but I AM into his bod ;]|`|2bUIDeefaa	haha :)<br>  well I think he is cute <br>  click on the 'see full size image" at the top of the page<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://bp3.blogger.com/_QCME4qmvJuo/SCM5q5O7YsI/AAAAAAAABQg/wm5pnXpYu5c/s400/edward.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.kroq-data.com/applications/WebBlogManagernicole/inc_webblogmanager.asp&usg=__O702y14BkWW5fM2VHU0Q43VrZj8=&h=337&w=315&sz=31&hl=en&start=25&um=1&tbnid=4z_3IugQYLeduM:&tbnh=119&tbnw=111&prev=/images%3Fq%3Drob%2Bpattinson%26start%3D21%26ndsp%3D21%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den-us%26sa%3DN" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  its because the twilight series makes edward cullen sound like the perfect guy and rob pattinson plays edward :)|`|DhOjQM34aa	I already answered this question in another section!|`|EsVjwKPAaa	this category should not be put in here.|`|Du8QhOmaaa	Haha i do not know why everyone thinks he is so attractive.

This may make the pimple look worse due to inflammation and irritation. Popping a zit can spread infection under the skin and produce even more pimples than before. If you do pop a spot then immediately clean it with soap and water or rubbing alcohol in order to prevent infection. If a pimple erupts in a particularly bothersome place, learn how to target a single pimple. And if you're determined to pop, learn how to pop a pimple safely and properly. <br>  2.Remove any make-up you have on. Wearing make-up can clog pores, making them dirty and causing pimples. <br>  3.Use a mild soap for sensitive skin but it doesn't matter exactly what type of soap you use. It can be designed for acne-prone skin or not, but you will want to treat your skin gently. Harsh antibacterial soap may actually make your acne worse by irritating skin. <br>  4.Remove dead skin cells regularly by exfoliating. Use a gentle scrub with natural defoliants like ground walnut shells, or use an over-the-counter chemical defoliant like salicylic acid or glycolic acid. Adding ground walnut shell to a thick moisturizer like cocoa butter can be effective too. Take caution, because over-exfoliating can actually increase the likelihood of acne by irritating the skin. Pat dry, rather than rubbing, since rubbing can cause irritation to the fresh skin you've just revealed. <br>  5.Use a good toner. Spray onto face or wipe on with a cotton ball and wipe off with a clean, dry cotton ball. This gets rid of excess cleanser and tightens pores. Good, inexpensive choices include plain witch hazel for normal to dry skin, lemon juice, or 3% hydrogen peroxide for oily skin. 70% ethyl rubbing alcohol can also be used for severe oiliness, but it can really dry out your skin and irritate it more. Some toners are medicated, and this stage is the best for using a medicated product if you're only going to use one medication. <br>  6.Bacteria in pores is one cause of spots. Reduce the amount of bacteria by using toners containing anti-bacterial agents like alcohol, peroxide and benzalkonium chloride, and by using creams that contain benzoyl peroxide (ask your doctor about benzaclin, with moisturizer if you have dry skin, as it works better than just plain benzoyl because benzoyl takes up to 8 weeks before improvement is seen) which kill bacteria as well as cause the skin to regenerate faster. <br>  7.Maintain a routine. Most acne treatments take time to work. It usually takes between two and eight weeks before you see any significant improvement, so you are going to have to be patient. Once you've gotten your acne cleared up, it's important to continue with the treatment that's working so it does not return.|`|XUjCkmIyaa	Hi! I used to share your problem..it was very hard to say the least! Then one day a pharmacist recommended philosphy's 'Hope in a Jar' she said it cleared her face and made it so soft. So I went to www.sephora.com and ordered a jar..about $39.00..a little expensive, but I was deperate so I bought it. Within 1 week my face started to clear up..then the next week it became even more clear and soft! This stuff really is amazing! It's just a moisturizer with lactid acid I believe. but if you are like me and had bad luck with acne treatments that only dry your face out even more and break it out even more..I suggest you try this! It really clears your skin while moisturizing! I've been using it for almost a year and still clear! Good luck! :)|`|XToxJOIAaa	Hon, try this easy step....<br>  <br>  1. 1 Fresh lemon (organic is preferred) or Apple vinegar (not cider ok)<br>  2. Spring water<br>  <br>  Mix 2 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon with 1 tablespoon of spring water and leave it in the microwave for 10 minutes then put it on the spot but for acne prevention use it once a week and wear it as a substitute of your night cream or moisturizer. Rinse it off in the morning! :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  G' luck trying it! :-)|`|HvbIE03saa	I know you said without having to, but I highly recommend Proactive.<br>  <br>  That said, your best bet is to find a good face wash with a scrub in it, along with a toner and moisturizer. It's also important to wash your face daily, if you wear makeup, wash your face twice (once to wash the makeup off before bed). You can also find some "recipes" online for homemade remedies for acne.<br>  <br>  If your acne is REALLY bad, I would suggest going to a dermatologist and getting somethink like Acutane. Works pretty well.|`|EQz7DDsEaa	go to a health store and ask for tea tree oil and rub it on your face b4 you go to sleep every night and it will kill the bacteria or if you have one spot pimple thats bugging the s*** out of you take a bandaide and put a drop of honey on the bandaide and put it on<br>  honey will kill the bateria overnight <br>   the reason why is because its actually an acid it stomach acid from a bee =] BEE VOMIT=HONEY =] god bless America lol|`|4e4K8Ivlaa	wash your face three times a day. don't scrub real hard. and if you ever DO go for the step cleansers, i recommend acnefree. it's like 20 bucks and it's what i use. my face is so clear now, it's kind of unbelievable. i still can't get over it. my face used to have the worst zits (not quite acne).<br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|01hXfIG1aa	Visit a dermatologist for consultation before doing anything else.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Dip a cotton ball in egg whites and apply on clean face, wait a few hours and wash do it at least once a day for a few days.

It is still curly but somewhat looser and with the control, it seemed much thinner.  The hairdresser was REALLY good at her trade and she suggested using two sizes and alternating them for a more natural look.  I liked that idea and it worked well, but next time I think I will have her use her largest rod and buy the next size up so it will be even a bit looser curl.  <br>  <br>  I have tried straightening mine various ways for years and although some methods made it straight or fairly straight, I found that it was more work to fix it and keep it that way and I like quick and low maintenance.  I think I have resigned myself to the fact that I have hard to straighten hair and decided to leave it kind of short, permed and still curly but with more control.  I do have to have my hair cut in a way that leaves it much longer wet than the usual length that someone with straight(er) hair would because it draws up when it dries.<br>  <br>  After washing and conditioning, I wrap my wet hair in a towel for a bit, then I use Frizz Ease or a similar product (people might tell you it's not good, but I haven't been happy with other things they suggested and always go back to using it and it doesn't seem to do anything bad to my hair) and then Aussie (maximum) mousse...a lot of it to coat "every" hair.  (Blob for the top front, 2 smaller blobs for each side, then several blobs to cover all the back top and underneath.)  Then I either let it dry naturally or under a (rare) hair dryer you sit under.  Blow drying causes it to expand and frizz even with a defuser so I don't use a hand dryer at all.  When it is completely dry, I scrunch it up with my hands to soften it and even use a pick a little to fluff it up...not too much though.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you find a style you can like, live with and even enjoy.  If you try part or all of my personal system, I hope it helps or if you find a different one that works for you...any thing that works for you, I hope it does.  I know what it is to have frizzy/curly difficult hair.|`|MjX1UgHsaa	i have the same problem, think about Japanese hair straightening it works really nice and is usually around 200 to 300

80X7xT4vaa	Red is dodge if its not done right. Make sure you go to a hair salon that you KNOW is good. Make sure they understand the red you want because, from my experience (came out purple), hairdressers have very different perceptions of what red actually is haha.<br>  <br>  They should give you a color chart. If not, ask for one. Good lord ask for one haha<br>  <br>  The chart will tell them the color number and exactly how much to mix in.   <br>  <br>  Also, you might want to try and stay in the lighter side (although dark red is nice) because your skin is quite fair. Maybe start with a darkish base color and then build up lighter high lights over the top? This will also look more natural. Or you could simply stay with the color you have and add add in red high lights. This might give you a feel for the color first before you go the whole way!<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!|`|eqztpi4baa	yes definetly !<br>  it would make u stand out alot more :)<br>  u'll look very classical <br>  make sure its a deep red though.<br>  <br>  good luck !|`|cKggyi3maa	why would anyone choose to go ranga|`|sTnVPft1aa	if u mean like a brown with the whole red tinge and shine happenin it would look pretty cool i reckon u should go 4 it. but remember if u want to go just brown after a while its kinda hard to do it as the red tinge tends to always show through especially when it fades. but other than that it would suit u heaps i reckon

5Ive0UABaa	yea i feel the same way. they think the style  looks"different" and "cool" but it really doesnt. too many people are going for that look so they probably are just following the crowd which is stupid to me. scene can be pretty cool, but it can get so annoying. i think by the time you grow up, you would grow out of that stuff and realize it's for like 15 years olds. it looks ridiculous on older people and it looks like they haven't matured since high school. im not a big fan of "scene" look and its not too attractive.id rather go through life bein myself then something im not to be honest with you...|`|U7MFTESfaa	I know what you mean. Like I'm fine and all if you look like the "scene" kid stereotype, I mean sadly I get told I look like a "scene/emo" kid all the time, but i get really annoyed when people are like 'Omgz I'm so scene'. For example, today my friend was talking about her boyfriend and she's said "Yeah I mean he's like a southern guy and I'm a scene kid, so I don't know how it's going to work". I swear I twitched a little when I heard that... I guess I'm a supporter of wearing what you like, and not following a certain label's trend...|`|tm9egUBraa	I don't know why it gets to you. Its just a trend, just the styles and culture of kids of the 90's 80's 70's etc. There are always things like this, right now its emo or scene as you said. Regardless, people will grow out of it eventually and the trend will switch to something else just as lame.|`|6v4KYFGoaa	I am!

It is slim through the hip and thigh.. then slightly opens near the bottom. Think about a pair of boots. When you wear boots and the jeans are covering them, only the toe part shows. A "boot" cut is supposed to cover the rest of the boot. Straight jeans are not tight all the way through. They are just straight. Straight from the hip to thighs all the way to the bottom. They don't go out or in at the leg opening. They simply stay straight. The jeans that taper in towards the bottom are "skinny" jeans.|`|SUG8wXmUaa	Flare jeans are tight at the top and flare out at the bottoms, skinny jeans cling to the ankle and are tight around your whole leg.

I stopped wearing them because of that! <br>  <br>  I would go with Volleys!|`|m7wzE1ndaa	Yeah everyone has a pair...I remember back in the day (when I was in 7th grade) and I had a pair of neon orange chucks...then one day everyone had them, odd. <br>  <br>  They (converse) lack arch support completely so if you're worried about comfort see if you can find some Dr. Scholls or something. <br>  <br>  I haven't heard of the other kind...volleys. <br>  <br>  You can also check out PF Flyers, like chucks but something different. Around the same price though.<br>  <br>  And if you go with the converse, get blue. Or better yet, both.<br>  <br>  And to the person above me, you probably can't put 'God' or 'Jesus' on there because some people could come up with offensive things to put with those two words...and nobody wants that. Ridiculous reason not to get shoes though, Converse just doesn't wanna get sued because someone has blasphemous phrases on their product. It isn't because they are anti-god. There are probably many things you can't get on there, it is all legal stuff.|`|f2f5de2feea0da330e1b307cdce13ba0aa	ummm well i dont know what volleys are but you should definetly get a pair (or two) of chucks. I dont know about you but i like the red ones.
acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	Well, I have fair skin and a lot of people think I'm a few years younger than I really am. A lot guess fifteen or sixteen when I'm really eighteen. Generally, I think pale skin makes somebody look younger. But, it could depend on the person and their skin type. To me, dark tanned skin makes somebody look older  than somebody with light, fair skin.|`|alAtUXvyaa	i'm really pale & have freckles, and people usually guess my age about right.|`|A8OVGLdiaa	i think it doesnt make you look older or younger <br>  that just makes u look weak or kindda sick|`|spXPpyP0aa	younger|`|8oKazGVGaa	if your using a good moisturizer it looks awsum and shouldn't look older|`|dvevk1qbaa	older<br>  unforch.<br>  darker skin has more melanoma which helps the skin not wrinkle<br>  <br>  to keep your skin lookin young you really have to stay out of the sun!!!|`|FkxiRWpVaa	if its fair skinned then it will make u look older but if u have pale skin it will make u look either sick or younger|`|VemHKmkmaa	It makes you look scary|`|BRIeyc8Raa	as long as it looks healthy..its neither.

A little advice for tall women to go with when they may feel like they are getting into the giant phase........Black and brown dresses make a tall woman have a shorter appearance. Another fact, wear white slacks!|`|nZTnlgnCaa	no. wearing high heels only show that your are confindent and comfortable with your height and helps you exsentuat your height.|`|dWmT9pBhaa	Depends how tall you are. If you are over 5'10 then I would avoid high heels. How tall are ya?|`|AA10832514	High heels on a tall girl is hot!  Especially if you've got long legs and a short dress on (not too short, now!)|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	No you will look more sophisticated if you wear high heels.|`|mA7CAwdLaa	Not if your size 10 or bigger. You will look like a female bigfoot.|`|lc9nus8taa	it should be fine|`|SweWwxDSaa	Yes, definitely! Be proud of your height. Heels are sexy on all women. So wear your shoes with confidence. Without confidence and a slouchy posture, you'll seem awkward. So pull your shoulders back and sway your hips when you walk. Women will wish they were you (with your amazing legs) and men will wish they could be with you.|`|0wUwKbHsaa	Be proud of your height and wear your new shoes proudly.  What people will notice is not your height, but how good you feel about yourself.  Height is relative.  In a group of models you might be average or even short!  In a group of gymnasts you may tower over them.  But who cares?  What is important is how YOU feel about YOU!|`|m0Hd7Kj3aa	I feel you! I'm 5' 7" and I would feel the same way. I learned that I needed to change that shyness into confidence and learn how to appreciate that I look good!!

2ZsRAxkuaa	I like most of the suicide girls.<br>  Although lately, alot of the new ones are kinda... boring and plain.<br>  I love tattoos. But I don't like the girls with tattoos that they obviously just got for the sake of it. Mainly so they could be a suicide girl, I think thats stupid.<br>  Along with all the scene tattoos. Like my little pony and diamonds and things, rather overdone. Just my opinion though...<br>  <br>  I'd never be a suicide girl though. They have an awful contract, and some rather snipey lawyers. There are much better sites and photographers than suicide girls... And you don't need to take your clothes off.|`|U7vLYGodaa	love them :)|`|spXPpyP0aa	eww|`|vy8SRHxlaa	some are hot, most aren't. Thats not because of the tattoos, tat's are hot on chicks, especially the amount the typical suicide girl gets. Its just that these girls are often just plain unattractive.

ANsznbWsaa	Perfectly normal. We all have it. Its like pubic hair. There to keep out germs.|`|HExso8UBaa	nope, but everyone grows hair somewhere someone else doesnt, its normal to have hair so dont stress on it|`|0tenMcUmaa	yea it is... but i dont shave it....|`|oQzjoPlGaa	ouch! Everyone has a bit of  hair there, it's left over from our caveman days.|`|KcdCqkDQaa	That's normal.<br>  <br>  You can have it waxed.|`|kV9YT6bSaa	EVERYBODY has hair there. It's there to prevent bacteria from going in your butthole.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Yes. I leave mine au naturale. porn stars who look so smooth achieve that look by having a brazilian wax which is waxing everything from the front all the way to the back... I wouldn't use nair on that area, just because of the chemicals and the fact that it's near a body entry (anus)
w5kQ98Fxaa	Lighter haired guys - blonds, mouse brown, strawberry blond etc; Mustache&goatee. I just think it looks good. I honestly couldn't explain it if I tried. <br>  <br>  Darker hair - dark browns/black etc: stubble, but no definition so no tache, no goatee etc.. I think guys with dark hair and a round face tend to suit a clean shaven face and a stubbly neck/chin but if the guy has good cheekbones/strong jaw, keep the stubble going from the distance halfway between the cheek and the jaw to where the chin becomes the neck, but none on the neck.<br>  <br>  I think it also depends on the guy's skin colour.. For example, a really really dark skinned black guy I know has a beard that's basically identical to captain jack's in pirates of the caribbean, plaits and all.. And it looks hot on him, but I just don't like the idea of it on white guys (including Johnny Depp unless he's dressed as a pirate). <br>  <br>  If a guy has his hair dyed an unnatural colour (bright red, bright pink, blue, purple etc) I'd say stubble again with no defined tache or goatee etc.. But then a guy friend of mine has naturally got hair the colour of red biro ink. His bro has the same colour also and looks awesome with a goatee, whereas my friend goes clean shaven and looks great too.<br>  <br>  Usually guys with middle-tone hair/the ginge I prefer clean shaven or very very faint stubble..<br>  <br>  Also it's totally dependant on the style of the hair on your head.. My friend with the Captain Jack beard also has dreadlocks, and that's probably a contributing factor to why it works so well. And mustaches on guys with super short hair doesn't really work.. But if you're bald and have no facial hair you look kind of like you have alopecia...<br>  <br>  I had no idea I had so many opinions on facial hair. Jeebus.<br>  <br>  But facial hair is such a subjective thing. I'd say just do what you like or ask your girlfriend what she likes, and go with that or make a compromise.|`|3z3P6j49aa	I prefer goatees. <br>  Its not messy, or too shaven.<br>  BUT, some guys look better completely shaved, and some look better with everything.<br>  <br>  so it really depends on the guys face :)|`|A8OVGLdiaa	i dont like men with mustache....they look better and nice if they are clean shaved|`|sOR734Dlaa	idc as long as it looks good ;)
c0R0apSVaa	Wooooow. Please find something better to spend your money on. WOOOOW. Hollister is over rated and trashy.

I go to hollister occasionally, and I go shopping about twice a month and spend maybe 2-300 dollars with mostly my own money on a lot of things other than hollister. Plus I go to a variety of stores, I've kind of grown out of shopping at JUST hollister and what not =]! But if your mom is okay with it I'm not stopping you =]|`|hQ4UCs2gaa	Well Lauren does not like Hollister. She tends to go for brands like Roxy and Self Esteem, but I LOVE Hollister and its probably normal although i dont spend quite as much ( my mom cuts me off at $300 a lot of the time) shopping is practically the way you stay entertained so no its probably pretty normal. Luv, Shelby and Lauren<br>  <br>  P.S you should really give coach a chance there is some really cute stuff there- like i have the most adorable pink coach ever but b4 that i wasnt really into it. :)|`|qTS0SX48aa	I personally don't like Hollister.<br>  EVERYONE wears it, and it's all the same stuff, and it's unreasonably priced, they up their prices because they know that ALL middle school/ high school kids shop there and they can get away with it because "the cutest clothes are at Hollister, and EVERYONE wears them."<br>  I enjoy my originality. :]<br>  I shop wherever I find a cute top, jeans, etc. It really doesn't matter  to me what the brand is.<br>  Plus, Hollister is a farming town in Cali, not some ultra-cool town with beaches and celebritys and stuff.<br>  But i don't mind that you shop there, if you like the clothes, get them! your style isn't my style. lol.|`|uq3rgXUgaa	no that is not okay<br>  first of all , have your own style not just shop there, everyone shops there!!!!<br>  thats sooooooooooooo stupid! $500 dollars a week??????????? are you kidding me?????????? and out of all places you could spend $500 dollars you had to pick hollister???????????????<br>  stop wasting all of your moms money and get a sense of individual style|`|LFpcwGwGaa	It's not my favorite and that's a lot of money to spend in one place. The economy is bad right now too, so maybe spend less.

72gOYwzpaa	Magazines are a good way to get ideas. I read a variety of fashion magazines. However, one shouldn't imitate the outfit exactly. There isn't one specific outfit that looks chic. You should be yourself. Take pieces of clothing that you find in a magazine and add them to your wardrobe. Mix them into you own style.You should take pride in how you present yourself, but it's not just about what you wear. You have to feel comfortable. Confidence is important.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Wear big shades and big purses and pooch your lips out like you're somebody important|`|AA10006792	Just stay with basic colors and coordinate your colors. Have the basics colors like gray, black,brown,white,blue black and burgundy. Get one blue black and one black sport coat, about three khaki slacks in neutral colors ,few white,gray and light blue shirts. a couple of suites preferably one gray and one black. A couple of shoes IE: brown and black color. You can start with few items and build your wardrobe over time. A couple of neutral color sweaters. Just don't forget to buy summer cloth in the winter and winter cloth in the summer,you could save a bundle. good luck.|`|fe8a853f925097d816491329187b043daa	grab a teenvogue magazine & imitate what they have on.<br>  not everything at once, just one simple outfit that <br>  may fit your body style.<br>  probably anything in magazines you can imitate & look tres chic!|`|dWmT9pBhaa	Turn off the computer and get a life|`|7y8OUFFYaa	Cut your D I C K off!|`|nMMx77wQaa	Dressing nice and having confidence

I'm not exactly a fashion expert, but I'm pretty sure that to flatter that figure you should wear bright for tops and dark for pants and such.. Your pants are already black, so Idunno maybe bright yellow or pink, green, light blue? I don't know about style.. straight leg meaning skinny jeans? or bootcut? Maybe babydoll style, or maybe just a button-up shirt, with the top three buttons loose and a pretty necklace? Like white or such? I don't know.. but work it with the spunky jewelry too 'cause it evens out the upper and lower body and makes you look more hourglass-y. Good luck :)

If your wearing a skirt, wearing something plain jane and then dressing it up with scarves, long neclaces and bangles works just fine! <br>  <br>  As far as your hair, I'll just post some links........|`|WImTV7v1aa	check out my blog <br>  <a href="http://enviime.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://enviime.blogspot.com/</a><br>  it gives you fashion; make up; and all that fun stuff (:<br>  and you can also request a special "make over" for you w/o actually being here... yepp.<br>  <br>  oh and you dont have to fit in... just be yourself.. but i understand.. fitting in is nice but fitting in and  being you is wonderful.|`|A8OVGLdiaa	well depends on how old are you i think|`|XBoj7HaUaa	well.. i think you should dress something like this but always put a bit of your own style into what you wear.<br>  if you're a teenager and have an easy going personality then i suggest buying clothes that you can find in surfer type shops like SDS and Skipp Surf and Extreme etc.. . if you want to be taken more seriously and look sophisticated then shop at stores like myer - MISS SHOP is the best brand ... have a look at what the dolls are wearing, thats usually the trend and also sports girl is a great shop. ... i dont shop at these shops but i visit them regularly.. then i go into stores like BIG W and KMART and try my best to imitate the clothing on the dolls. and it looks really good. skinny leg jeans are in. light blue ones with brown stitches for easy going and dark blue with white stitches for sophisticated.<br>  also i think that the type of shoe everyone should own is the RABEN they arent expensive and u can get them from KMART or Payless shoes.. from any shop. dress in shades of purple , brown and gray. dont mix the 3 colors. together though.<br>  with your hair.. get a cheap straighener from aldi its just as good as a remington and it wont damage your hair as much as a remington - thats for sophisticated. and for easygoing - wash your hair , dont use conditioner, let it dry naturally and then put some mousse onto your hands spread through hair using gour fingers. this will create an illusion of highlights and keep down the frizzyness/ fuzzyness. + it wont damage ur hair .  IF you decide to wear make up stay away from foundation, coz it will ruin your face and give you wrinkles. for sophisticated use.. smoky eyeshadow and peach coloured lipgloss.  for easygoing use white eyeshadow, define a lash mascara and more peachy coloured lipgloss. <br>  JUST REMEBER to fit in.. you must stand out...  and to do that you must find a style that you love.. and above is just an example.   .. and never spend to much money on an item that you dont feel comfortable in or dont like..<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK.....<br>  <br>  oh and the stuff that's in is..:<br>  skinny leg jeans<br>  light flowy  singlet tops<br>  thick brown belts<br>  big gold bangles<br>  thin gold bangles<br>  gold jewelery <br>  uggy boots <br>  jackets with fluffy stuff<br>  gold studs<br>  Rabens<br>  platform heels<br>  gladiator heels<br>  shirts with elbow length sleeves<br>  etc..<br>  <br>  NOT IN:<br>  vests,<br>  flared pants =( - thats soo unfair coz i own soo many pairs.. lol i ended up cutting them to knee length and wearing them as shorts. they looked soo cute afterwards<br>  anyway<br>  not in.<br>  pointy boots<br>  necklaces<br>  thick hoop earings<br>  big earings<br>  wooly scarves <br>  flower print<br>  strapless shirts..<br>  etc

If you are older like 21 then sry but no can do. BUT FOR accesories go to Hot topic, target has nice and affordable bags (totes are in) they also have reasonably priced make up.

LHJb3wafaa	I got laser hair removal on my lip when I was 13,<br>  its quite a shock when you get it, but momentary- like being flicked by an elastic band.<br>  Doesn't sound pleasant, but you can get a cream for it. And in my opinion, its worth it. It grows back very slowly and lighter, and then you have to get like 3 or 4 sessions, but then its gone. The less you have done to it before, the more effective it will be.<br>  My mother had her legs done, it takes a while and she had to use the cream, but she seems to think it was worth it.<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|TgIMTXPMaa	I got laser hair removal on my upper lip when I was 10-12 (I too had dark hair) <br>  The hair came back.<br>  Due to hormone levels it doesn't really work for kids that age. <br>  <br>  It is a time consuming process especially for an area like the legs and there has been cases reported of girls who have died because of the numbing creme they used (larger area of application led to heart failure)<br>  <br>  Advantages are that you will never to shave again!<br>  Or wax!<br>  <br>  Disadvantages are - pain, cost, time consuming, and the small chance of death or scarring. <br>  <br>  I think you should do it when YOU are tired of waxing/shaving and want an alternative. <br>  <br>  Not when your mother and family members think what is right.

The soda binds itself to your hair and increases the volume of the hair.<br>  <br>  if you want a permanent solution. then you need to address the source of your receding hairline as well, as they are probably both related. Cut out any junk food. eat a diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables. since hair is mainly protein getting lots of protein will help your hair.Taking biotin can help as well. the best thing to do is eat a healthy diet, ditch junk food and drink plenty of water on a daily basis.<br>     If you want to be sure you are getting the proteins and vitamins you need for your hair take hair supplements as well. Good ones also contain DHT blockers which act against the main cause of baldness|`|UvLNxiuyaa	Use thickening cleansing agents.

Only show off one part of your body.  If you are wearing a mini skirt to show off your legs, the boobs and arms need to be covered up.  If you're wearing a cleavage shirt, it should be matched with a long skirt or a well fitting pair of  pants or jeans.  You should never never ever have boobs and legs showing at the same time.  Don't worry about your mid section or tummy.  All women have it and it is there for a genetic reason.  Avoid strapless tops or dresses, even if you are a size 0 it will give u back fat.

That might help us with ur hair but try straighten your hair and give it a wave look on the bottom and maybe get some of ur hair in ur face with a straighter but the three things u need is a blow dryer, a straighter, and a brush :) But if u cant use a straighter then use the blow dryer when u get out of the shower and blow dry it with a curve on the tips of ur hair... and maybe use hairspray <br>  <br>  Btw straighter doesn't damage ur hair i use it all the time

I love silver so I'm not being biased; for this situation gold is the obvious choice. Also, the thin shape of the earrings will contrast well with the bold bodice and stripes. But what is really important is that you wear gold shoes that would make the ensemble (and you) spectacular! Some classy, glittery gold shoes with high heels would be the best.

Eat a diet that is high in whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Be sure you are getting enough essential fatty acids, also known as omega-3. Some good sources of omega-3 include salmon, herring, flax seed, walnuts, olive oil and lean meats, among others.<br>  <br>  # Take vitamin E and B supplements, or better yet, take a multi-vitamin every day. It may take awhile before you see improved results in your hair, but adding these vitamins to your diet works toward repairing hair breakage from the inside out.<br>  <br>  # Use moisturizing shampoos and conditioners every time you wash your hair. Avoid pulling or twisting your hair when washing or drying it.<br>  <br>  # Get your hair trimmed regularly to prevent split ends from traveling up the hair shaft to the roots. It is a good idea to have split ends trimmed once a month.<br>  <br>  # the first home remedy is a hot oil treatment. This treatment is great for many things, however is perfect for hair breakage<br>  <br>  here is a great homemade remedy to treat breakage<br>  <br>  * The first home remedy is hair mayonnaise recipe. The first step is to combine and whisk two egg yolks in a small bowl.<br>  <br>  * now, cut an avocado into two halves. Remove the skin of one half and place it in a separate bowl. Then use a fork to mash the avocado.<br>  * Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to avocado and whisk olive oil and avocado together until they are one texture.<br>  * Whisk the egg yolk separately. Then add the yolk to the avocado and olive oil blend; continue whisking until they are one composition.<br>  * Now apply throughout the hair, however concentrate on the areas that need it most (like the ends or hair in back of the head).<br>  <br>  * Leave in the hair for about a half hour and then shampoo and condition hair as usual.<br>  * Repeat these steps every 3 days or weekly until there is an improvement in the overall condition of the hair. You should be able to see results after about 2 to 3 weeks. If not, please consult with a professional.
5Dr5cvkwaa	I too am bow-legged. My parents are from Japan and it's actually common there. Years ago, my parents rented this japanese video showing leg/hip stretching regime that improved bowlegs. I've been doing them for years now. I still have bow legs but they are not as bad and I still stretch every single day. If I miss a couple days, I can see the difference. <br>  <br>  Basically you stretch your inner thigh/hip/pelvis. These may be helpful:<br>  <a href="http://trihardist.blogspot.com/2008/08/stop-slouching-lumbo-pelvic-stretches.html" rel="nofollow">http://trihardist.blogspot.com/2008/08/s...</a>|`|acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	Depending on the severity, I don't think bow legs are attractive. I believe the only "cure" is surgery, in which I don't know the specifics. Since I have had no experience with genu varum, I don't know what could be done to decrease the appearance of bow legs. I don't believe any sort of exercise would be able to change bone structure. Some cases aren't as bad as others. Personally, I think being pigeon toed is cute.|`|tOIz5WB3aa	I hope not, because i am bow legged. I actually like it, because it makes me original, and its kinda cool. It does not look bad on me, i like it because it makes my legs appear thinner because there is a gap between them when i put my feet together. Be proud of if, i am!|`|Vw3TZxquaa	Being bow-legged is not unattractive.- if you wish to disguise it a little, walk slightly pigeon-toed as this will bring you knees in a little.

n7hezV5aaa	The higher up you pierce on your ear, the tougher the cartilage is, so it's going to take a little longer to heal and for the soreness to go away. I suggest that you make sure you are wearing titanium jewelry as some material can be sensitizing your skin and prolong your healing time. Also, try not to sleep on it (I know it's impossible, but try) since doing so sometimes causes the ring to do some tearing on the cartliage and this prolongs healing time. It could take up to a month for it to stop hurting.|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	Try ibruprofen before you go to sleep. And don't sleep on it.<br>  <br>  I found those aeroplane pillows with the hole in very useful. But most people with piercings just sleep with their head in the crook of their elbow. Takes a while to get used to though.<br>  <br>  Such soreness will take about a week to go. But you might not be able to sleep on it ever without being uncomfotable. I can't.<br>  But you will get used to sleeping in weird positions, so don't worry about it.|`|1vFXZQ16aa	<a href="http://answersgetin.solarsciences.us" rel="nofollow">http://answersgetin.solarsciences.us</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|AkFIVDjQaa	it takes about 2-3 weeks<br>  just try to sleep on the other side or take a very mild sleeping tablet<br>  i had the same problem with my cartilage<br>  <br>  x|`|U0b4U827aa	It's probably infected. You need to clean it.
2ZsRAxkuaa	You won't need antibacterial soap if you use sea salt soaks, as they do more than enough.<br>  Most soap is a bit too harsh anyway. If you do, I recommend satin or provon soap as its nice and gentle, but just for the first week or so, once a day.<br>  <br>  Sea salt soaks are 1/8tsp sea salt in a whole cup of boiled water, it shouldn't taste any saltier than your tears. Twice a day.<br>  You can also get big bottles of saline solution pretty cheaply, they use it for contact lens' and eye wash. Theres also H20cean, but I find that horribly overpriced.<br>  <br>  Using a cotton bud will help dislodge any crusties, but it doesn't matter if you can't get them all off. Soaking with a cotton ball with help make them easier to remove.<br>  <br>  Sea salt soaks can be used forever. But you can start cutting down to once a day a week or so after the crusties have stopped. To be honest, I've normally pretty much stopped completely after a week or so. But its probably best to carry on for at least a month, or until its healed.<br>  <br>  Well it really depends on how your body heals, but you'll know what feels right.<br>  But if you have any problems, go straight back onto sea salt soaks.|`|lg2RfcrQaa	When I got mine done I used "Savlon" antiseptic spray. I bought it from the place I got it done and it's especially for cuts/wounds/piercings etc. I just got a cotton bud and wiped the back and front of the piercing. I did this twice every day for the first few days but I think because I was constantly cleaning it, it was irritating my skin and it ended up swelling up and going all red and dry. I've just left it since and only cleaned it when stuff was all built up and it's more or less healed now. I got it done just before christmas to give you an idea of how long it'll take to get better.<br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  x|`|tsn34pS4aa	sea salt soaks twice a day for 4-6 weeks or until you can touch or tug on the part without pain, as well as until it stops crusting. heat also helps with the soaks to promote healing. i used 1/8 teaspoon of sea salt from the grocery store in an old baby food glass, about 1/2 to 1/3 cup, of hot tap water and use that.<br>  <br>  i am surprised as to the fact that your piercer suggested antibacterial soap as it is unnecessary if you do sea salt daily, the sea salt works with your body to expel dead skin cells with the newly forming fistula in the piercing, and it will work to promote healing. <br>  <br>  if you must use the soap, dilute it, or use a foam version like dial foam that will be less potent and it will not seep into the piercing like the gel types will. once every few days if you must, and only a dab will do, but if you keep on it, the sea salt will be all you need and do its job and there will be no need for any other sort of cleaner.<br>  <br>  if you find you develop scar tissue which is common with cartilage piercings, go to your piercer and ask them for into rather than asking here.<br>  <br>  you can get what is called H2Ocean ($12-$15 at piercing shops or hot topic) which is a sea salt spray that also contains an enzyme to promote healing as well.<br>  <br>  that is all i used on all of mine and it worked wonders. i did get some scarring on a few but after one or two (total, not per day) tea tree oil treatments, they too went down and everything healed right up.

IvfEtJi8aa	yes you should be fine. you should probably wait a day before doing it though and DON'T wash your hair right before you put it in. the instructions usually tell you not to wash your hair and i've found that that makes a huge difference in color accuracy (with home kits that is)<br>  <br>  dying your hair multiple times is just fine, they add lot of conditioners to keep your hair nice.|`|6uW3pKkRaa	ithink u can dye is right now<br>  i kno people who have && it didnt matter|`|vqM01n5gaa	Don't do it. It will only make it worse. If you can afford it have a professional fix it. If not get the exact same kind of dye you used the first time and put it only on your roots. To figure out how long you need to leave the dye on to get the roots the same color do a strand test. Snip a little piece of your hair from an unnoticeable spot and tape up the very end to keep it together. Mix just a little dye together on a plate and put it on the lighter part of the strand. Check it after about 10 or 15 minutes to see if it looks dark enough. Then rinse the dye off it and dry it to make sure it still looks okay. If it still looks lighter you may need to leave it on longer. Make sure you write down how long you left the dye on the roots so you remember. Then just leave the dye on your roots for that long. I still say have a professional fix it, but this might work if you can't afford that. Always do a strand test before you dye your hair so you know how it will turn out before you dye your whole head.

I'm not too fond of the overly long side bangs of the hair you wish to get. Thicker and choppier bangs suit your face moreso than those kind of side bangs would. I dislike the contrast between the blonde and the dark brown hair. Though, I hope you're keeping your hair color. Find a new hair style, I dislike the one you choose out.

nTSjPOYQaa	I had mine done, and they didn't hurt at all, not one bit. It all depends on the person, the pain tolerance, and the nipples.

eMX7eDgbaa	One way is to make braids in your hair after you shower and sleep with them on (sometimes put a showercap on if you dont sleep in place) in the morning take the shower cap off if you used one and spray some water on your hair while it is still in braids. make sure your hair is slightly damp at this point, and still in braids. Then in about 3-6 mins take off the ruber bands and undo the braids. your hair will have a wave to it. some times get a comb and slightly brush your hair were it may be frizzy.|`|UvLNxiuyaa	If you want waves that really stand out, give the crimping iron a try. Always use a crimping iron on dry hair and be sure to use a good conditioner if you plan on doing this on a regular basis as the heat can be very drying. You may want to consider using Shock Waves Strong Frizz Free Styling Cream on the ends on your hair. This little tool can be a great volumizer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jamaluk.com/images/2004/product-67386.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://jamaluk.com/images/2004/product-6...</a>|`|79aZQf4qaa	grow it out. its all in your genetics|`|AeV8KYL2aa	braids? curling iron? lots of time and patience?|`|oAGvwYY8aa	Tye it in plates when its wet...<br>  wait to dry<br>  <br>  and TADAAA

It makes your hair very shiny, and makes it insanely soft!! <br>  <br>  Though it's a bit pricier (the smallest bottles are usually around $13), the smaller bottles usually last me half a year (and I have really long hair), so it's definitely worth it in my opinion =)|`|CHCPnvksaa	Hask Pure Shine shine luminator. It lasts all day and makes your hair insanely shiny. You only need 2 or 3 mists over your hair after it's styled. Any more and it will look oily.

BACK TO THE QUESTION (sorry) ya i liked garnier sleek and shine and ok :) best thing to do is they have shine spray it comes in a little spray bottle probably only a few ounces. (i know u think it wont last long) but its only a few dollars and ( i dont use mine daily but close!) has lasted months and months and months just 2-3 sprits (NOT NEAR THE ROOTS!!! :P makes it look greasy) and it just gives it this shine on top of any shampoo you decide to use to make it healthier. and for softness they have this like circular little bottle thats really good.

MGOFjVnVaa	the word perfume implicates femininity, so it is not used to<br>  men.<br>  eau de toilette for men  can hold out for many hours if you<br>  buy a good an expensive one. the "in" products are all<br>  pure chemistry, whilst the older products contain natural<br>  ingredients almost inclusively. in the end the prices even out,<br>  since one bottle of good old eau de toilette will last for months,<br>  whilst a bottle of the new ones will be used up within a week.<br>  <br>  my suggestion for you is to go to a "body shop" or to a<br>  "l'occidane", there you will find natural products.

JdpVNgyxaa	Putting a clear layer on to start with does help, as this will provide a smooth, equal base to put the colour on.    After putting on a few coats of colour (leave nails for 5-10 minutes in between each layer so they dry fully, this will prevent chipping too!)  finish with another clear coat.  The top coat will seal it and stop it chipping.  Every evening, put another clear topcoat on, especially on the tips, to keep the protection.    Hope I helped! ?|`|Cqgv9Wx1aa	I always but a layer of clear over the colour and that seems to help. You can also buy base coats to apply under the colour but I have never used these so can't say if  that works or not.|`|T93PeFvFaa	No what you should do is only put 1 or 2 layers of your colour nails varih then a clear chip resistand one on the top.|`|RpI8WcTgaa	Clear, colour, colour, clear :)    That always works for me    AND DON'T GET MISS SPORTY.      xxx|`|gU4zcPAaaa	well, usually darker colours chip easier then lighter.  & it would probably work better if you put the clear varnish stuff on first.  i usually put clear hardening nail polish on it.

uly3aFqtaa	Okay, first off Conditioner isn't necessary if you have oily hair, so completely cut that out. Long ago before Conditioner was even invented, Women used to sit at their dressing tables brushing their hair hundreds of times, to distribute Sebum [the oil your scalp produces] from the roots to the tips of their hair. That was a substitute for Conditioner! <br>  <br>  You could try using a Dry Shampoo, which comes in a can. You spray it on your hair and it soaks up excess oil and pretty much gets rid of greasiness. This isn't a complete substitute for Shampooing your hair the proper way; it's just for if you're in a major hurry and don't have time for washing your hair in the shower.<br>  <br>  Some people sprinkle a little bit of Baby Powder on a brush and brush it through their hair. I haven;'t tried this, but from what I can imagine it looks as though it would make your hair seem very dull and powdery - this is probably better to be done when your hair is SUPER-oily and you don't need much powder. [I wouldn't reccomend allowing your hair to get as oily as you need it to be to use the Powder]<br>  <br>  Xx.|`|XWMNCyA1aa	rub some baby powder in it, trust me it works  =]|`|SyQULhX3aa	If your hair is greasy then peolple tend to wash it and wash it every day but that way it gets greasier if you keep washing it, i know it sounds silly but dont wash it and get into the habbit of only washing every other day :) good luck x|`|AA10910187	Well when I got my hair done for my aunts wedding i wasnt aloud to wash my hair the day before.  So they put baby powder in my hair and it works REALLY well or dry shampoo.  But just make sure that it is blended in and not in the part of your hair where it can easily be seen!|`|CBmizuGwaa	...wash it !   ...or ware a hat.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Have dry hair.|`|uTQpGiD7aa	Maybe it's the shampoo your using. Maybe the shampoo your using is better for dry hair better than oily. If you have oily hair you should not be using shampoo for dry hair. Try shampoos and conditioners for your hair type and condition.<br>  Check out this website, they are a bit pricey but they are really good.<br>  Have fun!|`|XToxJOIAaa	Well, You gotta know about this new but not-so-brand new thing called DRY SHAMPOO (drum roll). It's a must-have thing for anyone :-) The best one would be Oscar Blandi and it's available at Sephora. Or another way, puree a fresh lemon (make sure there's no pulp) and mix it with a cold water (iced even better) and rinse your hair with that liquid.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps dear...|`|kKYr44bEaa	Dry Shampoo works really well if you haven't got time to wash your hair in the morning or whatever. You just spray it on and brush it in and it works instantly. :)|`|bJt3fFnraa	shampoo at least every other day....|`|EwR91zQuaa	ya i have the same problem but i think dry shampoo is the best!<br>  theres really good one by lee staford its about 7 euro!
uly3aFqtaa	When you get out of the shower in the morning, don't rub your hair all over; just wrap it up in your towel until the dripping water is soaked up. Then let it down loosely WITHOUT COMBING/BRUSHING and with your fingers, drag one side of your hair to the middle of the back of your head and clip with a big sparkly clip :)<br>  If you have wavy hair, you might notice some curls because you haven't really brushed the curls/waves out, and rubbing at your wet hair will cause frizziness. You can put in some Leave-In Conditioner before you put your hair up in the towel if you want!<br>  <br>  Another good Hairstyle I like is a side-ponytail. Take sections of your hair and twist them around to the opposite side of your head and tie in a low side-ponytail under your ear. Leaving out some wispy pieces of hair at the front looks pretty, too!<br>  <br>  Try leaving your hair down but pinning the top back with little, little clips, so it almost forms a Headband! Leave the rest down, or you could loosely tie it up how you want.<br>  <br>  High ponytails are really cute, and it's a fun change rather than the low ponytails.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN EXPERIMENTING.!|`|mzhFrm5Taa	French plaits?<br>  <a href="http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs1683/hji/medium/1987-brunette-plait.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lizhairandbeauty.co.uk/images/FrenchPlait.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lizhairandbeauty.co.uk/images...</a><br>  <br>  Crisp waves?<br>  <a href="http://www.hairstylestalk.com/images/asian-hairstyle1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstylestalk.com/images/asi...</a><br>  <br>  Take a bit of hair from the front and clip it back?<br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/hairstylecentral/Taylor%201.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/hairstylecentral...</a><br>  <br>  Simple hair bun?<br>  <a href="http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/4578972/75585-main_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Art...</a><br>  <br>  Mini front plaits that you put back and tie up?<br>  <a href="http://img154.exs.cx/img154/9974/249623c900c249623b94ff9gx.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img154.exs.cx/img154/9974/249623c...</a><br>  <br>  Try looking up online how to do them if you're not that sure, or you can go to a salon and ask them how to do it, they will know exactly how to achieve certain hairstyles&they'll be happy to help you.|`|H2snnvl6aa	i like to put my hair in a bun then pull it out a bit, then in the part in between the bun and my head i put my fingers through it and part it into 2 then i turn the bun up and into the hole to create and easy elegant twist bun :)<br>  hope you understood that it's really hard to describe, sorry i don't have a picture cause i learnt to do it myself one day when i was playing with my hair|`|AA10910187	Dry it with a hairdryer and straigten it.  You could also put in big rollers and sleep on them and you will have loose curls.  But try ot the weekend before you do it and go out.

Yp15y9zRaa	1. You were stupid to apply them with super glue, why on earth you did that I have no idea, but it was plain dumb.<br>  <br>  2. Acetone will probably remove them. Get a nail varnish remover that contains acetone, put some in a bowl (enought to cover all your nails) dunk your hand in and wait. You'll be there for about 2 hours, maybe more. <a href="http://www.supergluecorp.com/removingsuperglue.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.supergluecorp.com/removingsup...</a><br>  <br>  3. Next time you want false nails, I suggest you use ordinary nail glue.|`|JHOlfb1jaa	WTF would you super glue them on...?<br>  <br>  What's wrong with normal nail glue?<br>  <br>  Haha. Have fun getting them off lol :)|`|PlVh12fpaa	ouchh..|`|cQ6UFMmyaa	Heat the fingernails to very warm temperatures. The heat should release the glue and you should be able to pull them off. Try not to burn yourself as you will need high temperatures to release the glue|`|LAbQy9d4aa	No offense, but you've been PWND!|`|YR9l82vmaa	rip 'em off!! ahaha! have fun with that!|`|5fJkuRTjaa	You probably . . . just have to . . . rip them off.
AA12206218	Ok you need to remove the red pigment from the hair<br>  Colour wont lighten colour. It only adds colour<br>  You will need to use a lightener such as bleach to remove the red and then use your dirty blonde hair colour to add the colour back in<br>  I would only suggest you have a qualified hairdresser do this as I have seen so many clients try to do this themselves and damage their hair <br>  A hairdresser will use a bleach bath with part bleach, shampoo and peroxide (a low volume) and gently cleanse the red out, then tone with an ash blonde<br>  Good luck<br>  Red is very hard to remove so your hair colour may turn out more yellow.|`|XToxJOIAaa	bleach it...that's the only way

sinvSdkeaa	depending on your build, and your fashion style.  But here's a website with some ideas you could ask for personally i like the first one<br>  <a href="http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/short/chin-length.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/short/c...</a><br>  but choose what you like.|`|zPMH3mfiaa	Okay ! You want to look like a kid , <br>  Layers will never make you look like a kid . <br>  You know short length depends how your face is , if your<br>  face is round and chubby , then short won`t suit you at all .<br>  If you face is long and chubby ,no problem , short hair will <br>  suit you and if your face is long and slim then short is perfect for you !<br>  Now , then length should be till your chin , if your face is long and <br>  if it`s round then it should be  a little longer .<br>  Remember : Very short cuts won`t suit on round faces . <br>  If you curl your hair a bit from down , you may look like <br>  a kid !|`|kKYr44bEaa	I have the same hair type and got mine cut a few weeks ago. i got a full fringe but kept the length the same just getting rid of the split ends. it looks really nice , especially if you add volume to the sides. One thing i wouldn't recommend is a short short style because i tried that before, it looked awful and took a year to grow out properly. You could get a side fringe if you wanted layers because that always works well but it takes a lot of straightening to keep it looking like it does when you get it cut but i think most styles do. Another style that i've had and thought looked good [ i cut my hair quite often :) ] was having it the length so it's just at your shoulders and having layers put in so its shaped around your face. That way you could have length off and layers without looking emo.  Hope this helps :)
1hciyvKdaa	Yes yuki stuff, shocked me the frist time, yes I clean it when it looks like it needs it. I dont mess with it much though.|`|l5wziiicaa	I clean mine, you're suppose to lol!  I don't like to though, it makes me feel funny!
k1DyH9ZMaa	1. you try a bang and pig tails<br>  2.you can put it into a messy bun<br>  3. you can bundle half of the hair and let the bundle hang down<br>  4.or you can just type in ''hairstyle for teens'' on the web and look at the various styles and choose or make a combination of some<br>  hope i helped:)
KzDwZfLBaa	I don't think so, but you are allowed not to give the money to you hairdresser if you find you haircut doesn't fit to you, but I think after 2weeks is too late!|`|p3GZERIsaa	No|`|Q3DKaSyPaa	I'm afraid now would be a bit late. But if you don't pay them when it comes out bad right away, they are usually okay.
GyKkb3ezaa	I honestly don't understand why people are so against you going blonde. You eyes aren't brown, their hazel, almost green clearly. Your skin is fair so I would recommend going blonde. I would say a dirty blonde would lighten and turn up the green in your eyes and probably give your skin a more olive complexion. I don't think it would look terrible at all, theirs nothing wrong with taking risks and your gorgeous so theirs no reason you cant pull it off. I wouldn't suggest a platinum blonde though you want it to look natural.|`|6f5roHB0aa	i think that is a terrible idea|`|ZFEs5uxdaa	well i think you could suit both as you have greenish eyes :) but you have quite dark brows ...  if your daring go ahead but you could try this website for a breif idea xxx     http://www.ukhairdressers.com/hair_move/    just upload your photo and go tell me if you do though :D|`|cYRZpGkqaa	go ahead. if you don't like it you can always dye it back.|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	No. It doesnt go with your skin tone.  You can get highlights though.|`|GfMRewh7aa	mhm no, sorry|`|10d3a20f5e9e461620d21232a764a631aa	i think its a bad idea becuase you have brown eyes  but if you got like light blue colored contacts it would be fine    oh and a new haircut is prob a good idea too|`|wqtwzzPeaa	I think it would look cute if you really do have a side swept fringe, not with the picture you gave though.
