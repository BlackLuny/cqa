a41d8732c7b39815a399ed283ef4d4d5aa	You can do exercises to increase your vertical. Remember, it isn't getting the rim, it is getting ball through the rim (just a little higher).  I recommend  Plylometrics are great... I have a few suggestions... you can even do some of them at a court.  Remember, you are training explosive strength here!  1) Jump straight up and touch the backboard as many times as you can. Rest and repeat. This helps explosive speed. Try to jump higher as you go. Add a ball if you want. If you can, mark your progress. Do this double legged, and then try one step and up. If you are too short, just jump up till you can hit the board or something low to hit.  2) Skip across the length of the basketball court. Do it once trying to skip as high as you can. Do it again trying to skip as long as you can and repeat. This should be done fast. Once again you are building explosive strength.  3) Do calf raise with weights or at the very least on the steps. After you are strong enough do calf raises with one leg and switch.  4) Do squats... add weight with fewer reps and more weight, etc. You are building explosive strength... something you need. Do not let your knees go over your toes or you may develop some issues (many).  5) Don't just jog for basketball... It is an explosive sport. If you want to jog try this instead. Go to a track. Sprint (fast as you can) 100 meters then jog at a 7-8 minute mile pace 100 meters then sprint 100 meters, jog 100 meters, repeat... Increase your 800 sets as you get stronger. If you can't go to a track, do this at the court or outside or someplace.  6) Do other leg exercises... curls, extensions, farmer's walk, lunges, dead lifts.  7) Remember to run backwards! This way your quads get work too!  8) Oh, yea do some leg curls... while squats do work the whole leg, you don't want to blow a hamstring...Quads and Hams should be within 20% of strength of each other. Typically the quads are 20% stronger. Your quads (front leg muscles) should not be stronger than that as you can tear your hamstrings. Careful.  6) Jump rope... well that just really helps your cardio... but you can get fancy by doing double swings (requiring a bigger jump)and crossover, requiring a change and such. Mix it up. Watch Rocky IV for inspiration if you like (the library should have a free copy available on VHS or DVD).  Best of luck.|`|316206c8643518b5dd59d30180527d4daa	You can not!!!!|`|918295a4b1b66e21f58dd5fa478603dbaa	It's possible to dunk at 5'9". Keep working out, doing squats and other explosive exercises. Your muscles are coming to the point where they are getting fully developed, so stay in the gym and get more explosive. And dont forget to play football before basketball season.|`|e811d3bebe24dd291ffc8fb230924010aa	It all will depend on your build, athleticism, and commitment.    Assuming you have stopped growing (which is unlikely), there are many exercises and training routines that can increase your veritcal jumping ability.  Many individuals under 5'9" can dunk.    Remember, if you set your mind to it, you can do almost anything.  It just takes time and effort.    Keep taking small steps and before you know it you've crossed the desert.|`|AA10599549	If you have enough leg strenght and good jumping ability you probally can.|`|ec98d07bfe5bfe255a0b28efc34464ccaa	jump off of 1 foot like i do cuz im 16 and like 5'9 5'10 and i can almost dunk 10 foot,i got 9 1/2|`|AA10503331	dunk on what?    the regular nba courts?    or...    just some reglar home court?|`|32d7d767f963e789c15196748bd31845aa	Someone just asked this question a few days ago.

I would also like to say something in regard to your bio. You say that you are sometimes a face and sometimes a heel depending on the question you answer. An easier way to go about it is to refer to yourself as a tweener. A tweener is a wrestling term meaning someone is neither good nor bad. So, you are a tweener. I have nothing against that. However, I would like to see that match. I think that Test will win the ECW Title sometime this year. He hasn't been given a big push since he won the Intercontinental Title in 2001. He also spent a long time on the shelf. This could be a make or break year for Test. He is long overdue for a push since he hasn't had one in nearly 6 years.
f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	I don't think that this will even be close to the card.    first match:brian kendrick and paul london vs mnm(tag titles)london and kendrick wins   Highly unlikley, besides, Murcury is injured and is feuding with Matt Hardy.    second match:mickie james vs victoria(rematch,womens title)victoria wins  This one is a maybe, but I have a feeling that Malena will join to make it a triple threat.    third match:bobby lashlie vs test(ecw title)bobby wins  They will save this match in the future, still another triple threat, but I see Test in the rumble.    forth match:john cena vs either great khali or umaga(wwe title)cena wins  I see another Cena Umaga match, Khali will be in the rumble so like 7 guys can team up and eliminate the guy.    fifth match:batista vs ken kennedy(world heavyweight championship)batista wins  Okay I agree with ya on this one.    royal rumble match:undertaker or randy orton wins  Will most likley be Taker.|`|9dae3cbf3126a0b81ac0eae66b49467baa	i like it but i what dx come in the match and kick some *** if u know what i mean there|`|7d4414bc20ce9a4da7b8f7983a75f528aa	wow it sounds like a possible match card but like  Matt; Aka: Rated RKO said they wouldnt have tht many title matches for royal rumble... maybe victoria would win and cena but anyone else idk.....and fo sure i heard orton will win...cant wait almost|`|889c495a3ff1bad96004885ba1284ff1aa	thats pretty stupid|`|af8a53d818d9eccc44276375b03f40c0aa	The wwe will never have 5 title matches at a ppv.

Without an NFL team in the state, we tend to root for Iowa players that have move on to the pro ranks. Hence, Iowa residents rooting for California teams like the Chargers (Kaeding,Goff,Robinson) and the Raiders (Robert Gallery).|`|0b893a614efb4ef1584c6a3de77efae5aa	No, I haven't noticed that trend before, but I can understand their interest in Big Ten players. Indianapolis is in the Midwest, and the Big Ten conference is strictly a conference located in the Midwest. Big Ten players come out of college battle-tested, by playing a lot of tough and crucial games. The Colts will take players who go to the big schools where players have the big-game experience. Manning and Addai went to SEC schools, and you have already noted how many players went to Big Ten schools. The Big Ten is definitely one of the best conferences in the NCAA, no matter what you think about Ohio State's loss to Florida in the NCAA Championship Game.    --The Sports Guru|`|f2d8ccfb6bc46679a3c86c756a03d587aa	No...not really...but it would make sense if scouts in the area go to schools nearby first, right?

(They claim to have read the script for the movie.) The Rock would indeed be playing Agent 23. Maxwell Smart, an analyst for CONTROL, idolizes 23 because he's their James Bond. The agent who always comes out on top. Once Max heads into the field, he teams up with 23 and 99 (Anne Hathaway) to clear his name against the evil KAOS.

Mickie James Beat Victoria.Hardy beat Nitro.|`|81ed67512b505532e93e2634fccd8b7faa	Jeff Hardy (champion) vs. Johnny Nitro w/ Melina (challenger) - Intercontinental Title Match - Steel Cage     Hardy takes control in the early going, raining punches in the corner and using a swinging kick to the chest to get a near fall. Nitro gets in some offense before Hardy makes the first attempt for the door, though he is soundly thwarted. The champ soon finds himself trapped between the cage and the ropes, but he recovers to dropkick Nitro into the steel, leaving both men down. Nitro delivers a pair of big spots with a superplex and a Russian leg sweep off the top rope. Both men scale the same corner, where the challenger hits a sunset flip power bomb. Melina interferes from the outside, whipping her belt in Hardy's face, and her man scores with a springboard dropkick. A few moments later, Melina gets involved again, barring Hardy from going out the door while Nitro goes up and over the top of the cage. But the champ uses his head to prevail, dropkicking the door open and crotching Nitro on it in the process. All he has to do is roll out the door to retain his championship.    Winner ... and still Intercontinental Champion ... Jeff Hardy at 14 minutes and 49 seconds     Match Rating: 7/10     Todd Grisham interviews Rated RKO. Todd wants to know why things are so personal with DX. Edge says they formed just to take out DX, and tonight they are going to show them their run is over. Orton rambles on about what they did to DX, and that they are fighting for their livelihoods.     The Highlanders vs. World's Greatest Tag Team - Tag Team Turmoil Match - Number One Contender Match     Haas and Rory start things off. The Highlanders tag team Haas with a drop toehold and an elbow drop. The WGTT get back by double teaming Rory with the leap frog drop. Robbie gets the hot tag, hitting drop kicks on Haas and Benjamin. Robbie climbs the turnbuckle, but Haas rolls away. Benjamin jumps on the apron and nails Robbie with a superplex. Benjamin covers for the pin. The unusual team of Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Super Crazy comes out next.     If you would have told me three years ago that Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Super Crazy would be tag team partners in a WWE match in 2007, I would have laughed until Red Bull came out of my nose.     Super Crazy nails a drop kick on Haas. Crazy is whipped into the corner, and Benjamin nails him with a cheap shot. Haas combos a back suplex into a bridge and gets the pin. Cade and Murdoch are in next.     Benjamin is nailed with the atomic drop/big boot combo from Cade and Murdoch. Cade drops his partner on Benjamin. Haas gets a hot tag and takes outs Cade and Murdoch. Haas climbs the turnbuckle and nails Cade with a drop kick. Haas locks in a submission hold on Murdoch, but Cade makes the save off the turnbuckle, as the ref is distracted. Murdoch drapes an arm over Haas to get the win. Cryme Tyme is next.     JTG is choked in the corner; he fights out and rolls up Murdoch, but once again the ref is distracted (and the crowd is flat lining). Cade knocks Shad off the apron, then double teams JTG with a suplex. Shad still gets the tag, though, but a reverse elbow slows him down. JTG trips up Murdoch on the High-Low, and JTG jumps in and to help on the finisher. Shad covers Cade for the pin.     Winner ... Cryme Tyme at 19 minutes and 3 seconds.    Match Rating: 5/10     The Coach never misses a chance to kiss up to Vince McMahon, and he loves the chairman's idea to have Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell settle their differences with a match on Raw tomorrow night. Vince says he'll make it happen, but he's joking, right? Right? Coach continues to brown nose until Ron Simmons drops by to stop him with a single word: "Damn!"     Kenny Dykstra vs. Ric Flair     Dale's still under the impression that Lenny Dykstra spit his tobacco juice all over the screen the first time Kenny was introduced with his new last name. I'm thinking that's quite possible. Dykstra connects with a dropkick to open the festivities, but Flair takes charge with his trademark chops. The youngster responds by suplexing Flair on the floor, then returns to the ring to lock on a Boston Crab. Flair's rally is cut short when he's thrown off the top rope for the 103,725,248th time. A missile dropkick has Dykstra looking good, but Flair has enough left to use two chop blocks to set up the Figure Four.

During this match, Dale mentions yet again that he dislikes Candice Michelle because she is still living off her infamy from the GoDaddy.com Super Bowl ads.

3a2355dfd94fd7e2ce3ee072caec36b1aa	Most people who get selected to wrestle for OVW will get called up to the main WWE roster at some point, as OVW is like minor leagues for the WWE.  However, this is not guarantee of success or prolonged exposure.  Kevin Fertig, who once wrestled as Mordecai is perfect example of this.  Many promos aired on WWE television hyping his arrival, but McMahon felt he didn't get over with the crowd enough and he was sent back to OVW.  He debuted again last fall as Kevin Thorn on the ECW brand.  TNA does not have a minor leauge system like WWE but will evaluate independent talents from other promotions for work in their organization.  Statistically speaking, I could make up a number, but if you think in comparative terms, more people make it into the NFL than make it into WWE.|`|18b2e7525fe8502cc1a4f171e1db4506aa	100% chance of going to WWE.

58d6b4483a329162e1f9eeafcf972793aa	He definetly deserves a 9 plus rating, to think he was unstoppable and the whole and only reason they brought in Angle was to face Samoa Joe and give him some well deserved competition.  By far the   1 or   2  wrestler TNA has to offer.  He lacks a little enthuasim in ring, meaning at times he seems bored, I guess the lack of wrestling competiton he has, But the fueds with Kurt is really bringing out some of his best wrestling i've seen within the last 2 years or so.|`|35e05891dcc2b81d730923a4a3cd8210aa	10. He has everything a wrestler should have and is definitely championship material. This is a guy who brought the ROH World Title to world heavyweight championship status by repeatedly defending it and holding the honor to that belt. Like you said, he has brawling skills, technical ability, amazing mic skills, big, tough, and quick. I think the world is waiting for an NWA World Heavyweight Title run out of Samoa Joe and how he'll bring that belt up to (if not beyond) par with all the other heavyweight championships. When that day comes it will not only be a victory for Samoa Joe but a victory to TNA and all of its fans.|`|78d46de82dc8976af0d65d2e281b1206aa	i rate samoa joe a 10 plus hes been undefeated but angle ended samoa joes undefeated streak. but i still like samoa joe. hes a better champion then cena.|`|6defc03801c63f04501f702f6e9260c6aa	6.25|`|07d9e9d7d02df94b4fcf9417093272e6aa	7.0|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	Both are good but TNA is worse and I give Joe a 9|`|eeebe4ce6aa910843fbc64c45cbb4c89aa	I will give him a 8.9|`|AA12320371	9.8........size/agility/speed/power...he has it all!!!

But the actual roster is 40 men, they all are not in the majors at the same time though 40 x 30 = 1200.  In September the rosters expand, but few teams max it out to the full 40 men.    The simple answer is 750, but then it gets more complicated in Sept.   Hope this helps!|`|065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	A major league roster has 40 players, but only 25 of them are on the active roster at any given time from the start of the season through Agust 31.  After that, anyone of the 40-man roster can be on the active roster.  There are 30 MLB teams.|`|9fc411116ecd0e2d80639aca19649dccaa	This answer isn't as simple as it seems.    Major league teams are permitted to carry 25 players on their roster for most of the season, tho obviously the faces change based upon performance & injuries.    September 1st the rules permit the teams to expand that number to 40. The primary reason is that minor league schedules end around that date (play offs begin), & it permits teams to bring prospects up for a look see without sacrificing team strength.|`|AA12303782	not really really really big|`|AA10034425	about 600-700 players

Bob Backlund was the longest reigning WWE Champion in history (7 years undefeated) and was very effective when he ditched this hero angle (his real-life persona) in exhange for the deranged intellectual. He also won the  WWE title for a 2nd time in 1994 from Bret Hart, as result of extensive interference from Owen Hart who had only months before turned heel. But Backlund is an all-time great and the only men who can claim to be as good a wrestlers as him would be Bret Har, Owen Hart, Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, Curt Henning (Mr. Perfect), and Sting. The people who insult the greats have a right to do so, but they should realize that they are only making themselves appear foolish.    By the way, the Steiner Brothers would tie with The Road Warriors (Legion of Doom) as the greatest tag-team ever. And if you watch Big Poppa Pump Scott Steiner today (he is physically impressive, but with little mobility) you would be shocked to see this All-American wrestle as good as anyone (with the awe-inspiring Frankensteiner).    You can find DVD's at wwe shopzone that feature these men as almost every PPV is available. If you are a wrestling fan, you should watch WWE (1984-1993 and 1995-2002) and WCW (1995-2000). Those were the most highly rated and best periods in wrestling history.|`|AA12302661	That is true.. I agree with you.. I have to say that i was like that way but i turned out to be right.

Backlund has more talent in his little toe than Cena will ever have not to mention like a 3 or 4 year straight run with the Championship. There is some DVD stuff out there, but you are right. Also remember at that age they are still marks with no knowledge of what happens behind the scenes.

Im your friend I think kickboxing is good for WWE development. Words of wisdom from your LOVER LEE!~|`|AA12239433	Sugar - never in my life did I think I would EVER watch WWE, but last year my husband got me hooked.  I enjoy watching it every Monday and also like Mickie James.  It is just what you said - a form of entertainment - and most people knock it before they watch it a few times (like I used to)  You either love it or hate it, so it's your choice to watch or change the channel.      Now - to your question - I think there is no reason why you should not follow your dreams.  Dreams are what gives us our reason to get out of bed each day.  If I were you I would explain to your friends that if you wanted their opinion about your choices then you would ask for it.  Tell them again that this is your dream and you are going to follow it, and that they have a choice:  support you or not.  If they choose not to, then you are much better off without them in your life pulling you down.    Now - reality check.  I do know that there are places where the WWE folks train - check out their website for advice on that as I am not sure about where they are or how you get into them.  Get into some real WWE type training to see if you are really cut out for this choice or not.  Also, keep up the boxing - from what I see women's boxing is really coming a long way!    Like I said, I watch WWE and find it amusing and entertaining after working myself crazy at my job.  I do think that some of the fighting is "fake" but those people really are athletes who have to train to do the moves on that show.  It is very athletic and anyone who thinks otherwise should get in the ring and give it a try like you have - doesn't look so easy to me!    Good luck sugar and always follow your heart.  You'll have a life with no regrets.|`|af8a53d818d9eccc44276375b03f40c0aa	Hey girl, You do what you want and dont listen to them other kids. I know it's hard to actually get into the wwe but you DO have a chance. And yeah i like to fight too. Hey, Maybe I'll see you in the wwe some day :)

Goldberg.|`|YU98feruaa	First of all Sting would not come back.  Sting hates the MacMahons.  That's the reason he signed with TNA rather than WWE.  Second WCW wasn't all fighting.  They had just as much talking.  That's where all of the wrestling "gangs" started, NWO, Wolfpac, Raven's Flock, etc.  They also did have girls, they didn't wrestle and they weren't divas, they were the Nitro Girls.

I like the dudley boyz better.|`|d71392a8d7aafb5823c7f35357002dd0aa	If you say LAX is offensive to hispanics, than---    Is Cryme Tyme offensive to african americans?    Is Cade & Murdoch offensive to people from the south?    Was the Hart Foundation offensive to Canadians?    Dude, just draw the line-it's all pro wrestling.

Lovie Smith's a genius to win 14 regular season games and get his team to the superbowl with Gross man leading the offense.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	It even happens to really good QB's .. ask Tony Romo.    I think people are awfully hard on GRossman. I dont think he good compared to the Quality Qb's of the NFL, but with some grooming he will one day be a steady QB.|`|379adf8ec6ff418678fc28b78cee178baa	YES! When you are a "professional" QB playing, not only in the NFL, but the SUPER BOWL, you should be able to take a snap successfully! I dont care if the ball is covered i green jello!!! This is what you are getting paid to do! For all of you saying, "why dont you try it," blah blah blah....We dont have to try it!!! Im not saying its easy, but wen its your freakin JOB and you are getting paid a shitload of money to do your JOB, I think mistakes like dropping snapS is unacceptable! ESPECIALLY when you cannot even recover from the mistake and/or make up for it. Now, since i am a huge Colts fan, I was really enjoying Rex's performance last night, however, if i was a bears fan, id be livid. I wouldnt ban him from football completely...Id just send him to the Raiders with all the other reject players. He actually made Aarron Brooks look good last night!|`|3de2399999c4d98b0393e8255a669d92aa	Let's see you do it.  Go on - we'll watch.    Yeah, Rex had a bad game last night.  Yeah, I wish that the Bears would find a solid QB, since that has been our weak spot since Jim Miller.  I keep hoping that somewhere along the line we'll come up with a QB that can stand up under pressure and make the good choices, now that it seems like the O-Line is getting a little more solid and providing a little more protection.|`|aacbd878822577abf5c1d2cc198cd1c5aa	Those small hands plus rain spelled disaster for Rex.    Don't blame it all on him though.  His defense let him down, and their running game was not up to par.|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	He was not the only one who dropped the ball yesterday. Maybe you forgot the extra point attempt by Indy, the numerous fumbles in the game, I think that was a new Super Bowl record. Besides, the wet ball did not help any matters. This will be remembered as the most wet Super Bowl.|`|qJMPJdQzaa	He also had a receiver open that would've given the Bears a Touchdown, but he underthrew the ball for an interception.|`|AA10536687	Well, I guess that's why we're all in pro football, because it's so easy.
AA11916591	iam also confused by him visiting ecw. raw, and going to the ring and looking at batista but who knows he won and he will decide when he is ready, but think honestly he wants to go after batista i think or Cena|`|27085251982ecce59c76f2fd293ea37faa	i think it's world havyweight championship.  because if undertaker won the wwe championship he has to go to wwe raw. smack down dan't want to lose another best wrestler.|`|cebc4f439c31c00955a0cb6b01504304aa	hopefully he will stay on smackdown but all i know is that tomorrow on RAW the first things that happens is the Deadman's decision|`|5ab29bc1d518719aaa96bb570e6334a6aa	probably batista, because smackdown can't afford to lose any star power.|`|hRmCQFVqaa	Good dang, there has been 60 questions about that... why dont u just go to those instead of creating a 61st one?|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	On PW wrestling it mentioned Taker VS Cena, and HBK VS Batista. But my gut says that it will still be Batista, but for sure it will not be the ECW title. But he will say who on Raw tomorrow.|`|f8NmtfMzaa	I think the dead man should stay on smackdown and face Batista because he would look the best in that title and they never versed.|`|c8fa58c771da5b660289fc454b57efc6aa	as well as everyone else on here i also feel that the undertaker will be facing batista for the world heavyweight championship at wrestlemania 23  i can hear it now the referee in the ring the bell ringing and lillian garcia announcing the following match is schedueled for one fall and it is for the world heavyweight championship then the undertakers music hits and everyone goes crazy and she announces his name and weight and where hes from then batista comes out and she announces his info it wud be great but i think that batista will retain his title stay champ and i think that batista will be the one to finally end the undertakers undefeated streak at wrestlemania anyway i cant see undertaker champion again  wat wud also be weird is having 2 heels facing each other 4 the championship so i think whoever undertaker chooses to face at wrestlemania will turn heel  cuz its very weird to have 2 faces fight each other|`|smk7OIuwaa	I'm hopin' for a Triple Threat!

26f2c9ddac92ec59c1de3ba77b37465baa	The top three are as follows, in this order...    1. ROH Wrestling School - Philadelphia, PA  head trainer is Bryan Danielson  BY FAR the best pro wrestling school in the USA.  http://www.rohwrestling.com/wrestlingsch...      2. CZW/Chikara Wrestle Factory - Philadelphia, PA  head trainers are Chris Hero and Mike Quackenbush  Very good school. You can learn a lot from Quackenbush.  http://www.czwrestling.com/wrestlefactor...    3. Wild Samoan Training Center - Allentown, PA  head trainers are Afa The Wild Samoan and Headshrinker Samu  Probably the best school for a direct line into the WWE. They are endorsed by the WWE and may soon become a WWE developmental territory, but you will learn a lot more as far as technical wrestling from the two schools above.  http://www.wildsamoan.com/index2.htm...    If you are a large person who is more geared towards the entertainment aspect of the business, I would go to the Wild Samoan school. If you are smaller, and want to learn to wrestle the style of a guy like Bret Hart and tour Japan, go with the ROH school or the Wrestle Factory.    If you choose any school in PA other than those three, be VERY careful and do as much research as you possibly can. There are a lot of places out there that will take your money and not teach you a thing. The three schools above are not only the best in PA, but among the best in the United States (I would say all three are in the top ten in the USA)|`|af8a53d818d9eccc44276375b03f40c0aa	http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Wre...

I mean Mickie James is a great wrestler and can accomplish many great things in the near future, but I think that Trish has done a lot for wrestling in the Women's division, so ill agree in that she is better than melina and victoria, but wen it comes to trish they could be considered equal.    and to answer ur question, YES she will beat the crap out of Melina, and melina's scream pisses me off|`|ee68ecc14349fb13bd9ad74f0b50d281aa	Go Mickie!!  Yea! Melina will pay, but you still cant forget about trish, she started a legacy, btu move her outta the way and Mickie is the best!|`|TUlK9igTaa	I feel as though this is a wasted post because you won't listen to me anyway but...    Is there an actual question in here? Or are you just posting random s*** to get on everybody's nerves?  EVERYONE GETS IT! You love Mickie James, you're a fan, good for you. How many questions (I use that term VERY loosely) have you posted about how much you love Mickie James? I'm suprised Yahoo hasn't done something about you.    What the hell is the point of you posting the same thing 5 times a day? Get off the computer and unglue your eyes from Mickie James, grow up and get a life. There are better things to talk about than how much you love Mickie James.|`|a87cc31446c69b19d35d73a77f2133eeaa	You see that littttttle button on the side that says caps lock?

c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	A WCW match in where there are 3 rings and a steel cage around them all. Two men are placed n each, and the round begins and each clock starts. It is for a title when there are more than 6 or more contenders for it. The one who wins their match in the fastest time gets the title. There are also Tag Team matches but i think there is only one.|`|57d81f5f161fc5ed963bd9eecdb36239aa	the one i was talking about was with the 3 cage on top of each other like in the movie ready to rumble|`|YgILVUEuaa	Its three levels of hell on top of each other! the first level is like a regular steel cage. the second level is a hardcore cage. and the third level is a guitar cage filled with guitars. and on top of the guitar room there is something hanging from the ceiling like a ladder match!its my favorite match of all time!!!!!!!

Heck I'll even be surprised if Rex's qb rating will surpass Trent Dilfer's, the year he and the Ravens somehow beat the Giants. Don't be surprised if Indy's backup qb Jim Sorgi ends up with a higher qb rating than him.|`|8e75c8be41109014e58b13f1d8386886aa	Hate to say it but it will be Grossman!!!!!!    Manning will be on his back all game!|`|cd0a9abbadc7176f9fd561ad56749274aa	Rex grossman.  He did not take the bear to the superbowl.  Their defense did.  So what ever he does is icing on the cake.  Payton did take the colts so he can bring his a game and still lose.  The Bears will try to stop Payton. The colt will try to stop everyone one but Rex Grossman.  They want him to throw the ball.  Which is easier stopping Payton Manning or stopping the Bear from running the ball.    Payton will have to throw every down Rex will throw when he wants to.|`|f5f3dcd4ca157b23460500fc6d1c0418aa	Manning.  He's a better quaterback.  He'll hold the Lombardi trophy after the game is over.  Grossman sucks, and the only people who don't seem to know that are the stupid Bears fans!|`|7cce0da50da5c3d723a85f70e668a115aa	Neither will have a high rating. Peyton will be sacked once, and Rex will take two sacks. Both teams will play the cover 2 instead of blitzing very often, and most of the passes will fall harmlessly to the ground. Peyton's will be deflected, Rex's just incomplete. The Bears will do their best to gameplan avoiding giving up an (aerial) TD, and if the Colts give up a TD, it will be because of the combined efforts of TJ and Benson.|`|gxIVpuApaa	rex grossman    and he will also be super bowl MVP

8d56eae75c48bc54632aee45b92b17e2aa	First off, you should have your info straight before you ask a question like this one. Otherwise you'll look silly for not having the correct info. WWE is airing RAW on a Thursday b/c USA is airing a dog show. This happens each year and the WWE moves RAW each year. TNA did not want Monday night to be w/o wrestling so they have decided to air a 2 hour special. So the Thursday night RAW has nothing to do with TNA.|`|af8a53d818d9eccc44276375b03f40c0aa	In my question saying i will be the next best wrestling answerer, I am talking about yahoo answers. Not a real wrestling program. Look at the top of the page|`|5c92867f93bb9d51700f2eca3b0e2f9faa	as usual, WHEELJACK is right.  Once a year, wwe moves raw to a different night because of an annual dog show that the Channel USA has a contract with.  It has nothing to do with TNA, it has been done every year that wwe has been with USA (minus the Spike fling).|`|eeebe4ce6aa910843fbc64c45cbb4c89aa	raw is coming on thursday night because usa is carrying that dog show that they carry every year and because of this tna is going to be coming on this monday night.|`|15e56f74ef645900e6a33e3901429114aa	wwe know tna are bigging up on them so they are experimenting to show them who the big dogs are. hopefully i want tna to get more viewers then vince will go mad and start making better storylines to get the fans back.  this is the start of a war...|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	Well you see TNA and WWE are interacting with each other. VKM is dissing our Chairman and fave stable DX. Since USA will have that Kennel Club Dog Show, Tuesday is ECW, Weds. is WSX, and SD is Friday, then TNA and RAW dates have to switch so people won't have to decide between who to watch.|`|YdCPmxivaa	By not having competing programs, both companies get better ratings and hence more money.|`|9696a19975eaf29e0a2ce054d8ebc8cdaa	I think its great, honestly wrestling has been kind of stagnant without an outside form of competition to the WWE.  I like the ideal its going to build a fan base for TNA, and create competition which has been lacking for quite some time now.  I say kudos.|`|02d5b4be6d648eb1a102eb5570d140e8aa	Well, because TNA is dumb and has only like 4 superstars and its going to go out of business soon. So the creators are hoping to switch it to monday. This is because when people that arnt aware turn it on thinking its raw, TNA will get more views.|`|AA12110630	Raw isn't coming on Thursday because of TNA, it's coming on Thursday because it's pre-empted for a DOG SHOW. lol..    TNA is having their special on Monday Night because of Raw coming on thursday night, they are trying to increase their ratings by doing this.     TNA doesn't have enough ratings to hold a show up against WWE and if they are smart they wont try. WWE wouldn't change Raw's night for TNA, Raw would still destroy them.|`|27f37036c3c0544b6a5b53f75a1a66c1aa	it's perfect cause i love tna and wwe equaly and it will bother me if i watch one but not the other.|`|65ebe4f23a56ab982f7d9d0d4ed4e745aa	I LOVE DOUBLE DOUBLE EEEEEE!!!!  just joking!!!  that is STUPID TNA is BORING!!!!!!!!

I don't think WWE wants to lose ratings because of TNA. I still think the WWE shouldn't have done it on Thursday. Either do it later on Monday or on Tuesday.|`|dd5712cabea7f6f8add7c67277650388aa	hey
YdCPmxivaa	Most likely it will be two wrestlers from each brand    RAW: Johnny Nitro and Super Crazy  SMACKDOWN: Ken Kennedy and Montel Vontavious Porter  ECW: C.M. Punk and Sabu    I put my money on C.M. Punk.  He is really over with the crowd, he's an great worker, his matches are entertaining.  He deserves a title shot and this is probably the best way for him to get it.|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	Ric Flair, Edge, Test, RVD, King Booker, and either Chris Benoit or Finlay. RVD, EDGE or Benoit will win.|`|d69dcf662229e953373a321e003ca3b6aa	ya havnt heard anything about it they generally give it to a superstar whos gettin a push in the upcoming months...maybe some1 like matt hardy r kennedy|`|668381621f1c3e6cae920248dd38b977aa	cm punk, kennedy, jeff hardy, finlay, sabu,shelton benjamin, rvd, johnny nitro, carlito.   i predict either kennedy would win or jeff hardy.|`|4ABuD62waa	there is going to be shane mcmahon vs. carlito vs. benjamin vs. mysterio  vs. chavo vs. beniot i searched it up on  youtube on search type in wrestlemania 23 and there will be all the matches on the icon that shows Kane and Booker T.|`|363e3de25c44fca1821ed0620bdcccdbaa	wel i think it will be.........Finlay, Shelton, Carlito, sabu, Test, and benoit...............and I think Shelton will win because he's a great wrestler and he's been in every MITB match but he's never won one so I guess it's between him and Finlay|`|604eb2b9a273da80adcb45154c30260eaa	Yeh, the previous answer made me realise it will probably be two from each brand. Id like to see some ladder 'specialists' in the match. RVD and CM Punk from ECW, Jeff Hardy and Edge from Raw and Benoit and maybe even Matt Hardy from Smackdown.|`|8oHLvgZ4aa	I think: King Booker, Findlay, Mr.Kennedy, Great Khali, Ric Flair, Edge. I will Predict Great Khali!

X-division is not lightweight. I dont think anyone considers Samoa Joe lightweight. It's like the TV/US/Intercontinental/European belt. It's anything that isnt heavyweight. And can be heavyweight two, tna has had two wrestlers to hold both x-division and world title.    2. If you consider one of the 10 best wrestlers on the planet as "isn't much" then yes i gues then he "isn't much"|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	The Fallen Angel Christopher Daniels is a cruiserweight (220 lb. or less).

5662062552f2e2632d711ca7960440a6aa	It really does depend on who is executing the move.  The Pounce is a very clean, simple, but powerful-looking manuever.  Alpha Male executes it very well.  However, put the Pounce against a spear from a guy like Goldberg or the Gore by Rhino, and I'd have to say that the spear is a more effective move.  When delivered by Edge, the spear is overrated.  He's simply not strong enough to make it have any significant impact in my opinion.  Alpha Male sells the Pounce every time.|`|8a9b18cfda4155409a011be661d9062eaa	depends on who is using it.|`|eeebe4ce6aa910843fbc64c45cbb4c89aa	the pounce is better|`|8d56eae75c48bc54632aee45b92b17e2aa	I'm with you. The pounce looks a lot more forceful upon contact. Besides there are 3 WWE superstars right now using the spear. Edge, Lashley, and Batista. The Alpah Male has his own thing. The Poooouuunce!|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	I think the spear is better. The Pounce is basically a spear to the side, and very effective on the rib cage, but the spear targets the more important limbs, the lower body/stomach area.|`|10586f10f0bb2dcb8516c0db66cdc987aa	ya know they are gonna re name the pounce to sumthin else because thats the name he gav it in TNA|`|e4a65f19fece2e0b7ccfe9d02cba39afaa	The spear is good only when done by goldberg or rhyno   The pounce is pretty brutal too though   so its a tie

c8c1287bbff2ae084661d7a7b19e559daa	Tightend is one of the most versatile positions on offense in football...you first want to build your strength and size....most teams in the NFL use the tightend alot more than you think in the run game.  The ability to catch and run are things that will come with practice but you have to have the strength and size before a team will consider you as a legitimate prospect.|`|ec43934173ad5427d59f2e37d17eaff9aa	Size, speed, blocking, pass catching and route running are all huge. But if you cant get the play book down forget about it. As some one else mentioned TE is one of the most versatile positions on the Field and I would say second to QB as far as play book knowledge. So my point is your brain must be bigger then your butt.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	blocking and catching.|`|b1ee20f04b2a4c909adbd4ac3cd9701aaa	a big butt|`|7ab1c2a579a41278f79980e838cf7605aa	Blocking.|`|bb9eb9087788ed850a7431b6a0adbdb4aa	Catching the ball??|`|06ad192fa18060bac99bc24fff72176daa	get bigger and stronger, but don't ever lose your speed. TE's are suppose to be an extra lineman or a reciever. If you want to be a good TE you would need to learn how to block a linebacker, but also be fast enough to outrun a LB.|`|e95bb802d4152f43b5c0b6ce6ac88b83aa	Blocking is a huge part but not in all offenses.  Look at the Colts for example, Dallas Clark great hands and runs his routes to perfection.  So make sure to work on your blocks but especially your hands and route running skills and since tight ends dont usually go for the long ball make sure you work on finding the soft spots against defenses.|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	You might want to worry about making the College team first, mostly blocking and catching, you don't need to be very quick, but if you are short, you might want to try a different position.|`|3CJZRmElaa	Blocking, especially watching for the blitz.  Most NFL teams use the TE mainly for blocking and occasionally receiving, but some teams do use TE's as big receivers over the middle, especially in relatively short yardage situtations looking to just get a 1st down.

Are you jealous of every wrestler that you don't like. Get a clue. The dude just sucks. Cena just sucks. It's just that simple, but these little hormone driven "pop princesses" have no idea what wrestling is about. Go play with an Easy Bake oven or something.

Yall need to see that the points these guys prove should just make you all denyers shut up. And all you teeny boppers need to recognize that we ain't jealous. You must be jealous of Edge if you don't like him, am I correct?    Cena tries to act like he is some OG Thug, and that is rule number uno that I don't like him. He was raised on a damn ranch, and all his boys he chills with are just white rednecks. Sure the guy is Italian, is that supposed to make me think he is some mobster?    Cena is too commercialized, and you girls just help it happen. Forget it, you are never gonna get Cena so why fall in awe for the muthafucca. Cena can't rap either dammit, the guy has no lyrical skill, all he has is what you hear in rap today, and that is the plain out same bullshit. Go back to the 90's and listen to real rap. lol.    And Cena couldn't hold a flame to The Rock's crediblity. The guy was a real fan favorite. Cena is just some guy that comes out onto the entrance ramp, rumblin and stumblin around like a crack addict with parkinsans disease going into a seizure for the sakes of Jesus!    He CANT Wrestle for ****. His movelist consists of like only 7 moves! A fireman's carry can't even hurt me! That STF? Wow Heels use that in the middle of matches to hype up the face to break loose.    When are you people going to realize it? People think I should be forced to like John Cena because he is big, and he can "kick my ***"?

Basically, Vince McMahon didn't care that Goldberg's ego got overinflated in the other company, he didn't have to keep Goldberg unbeatable if he didn't want to. Bill Goldberg took his ball and went home, because he refused to accept that while he was a huge deal in WCW, in the WWE, where they already had Stone Cold, the Rock, Taker, Mankind, HHH, HBK, Kurt Angle, etc...they didn't need Goldberg.

aebd3a5bb81dfbb11b8e23fde7e578b6aa	severe injury to the neck due to a fan spilling a drink.     (wikipedia)    Droz's active wrestling career in WWF ended suddenly when he suffered a severe neck injury during a match with D'Lo Brown during a WWF SmackDown! taping on October 5 , 1999 at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island. A fan had thrown a drink into the ring, spilling its contents over one section, a fact of which both wrestlers and the referee were unaware. Brown went for his trademark running powerbomb and subsequently slipped on the wet patch of the ring while holding Droz in his arms, resulting in the botching of the move. Droz landed improperly, on his head, and fractured two disks in his neck. [2] He was immediately rushed to Nassau County Medical Center where he underwent hours of surgery to reduce and stabilize the pressure on his injured neck. Even with intensive medical care, his injury left him a quadriplegic. Before this injury it was expected that Droz had a very bright future within the WWF, as Vince McMahon was a big fan of his.|`|e4a65f19fece2e0b7ccfe9d02cba39afaa	he was paralyzed|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	Got released.|`|cf9c5d3af4b282c2d3c8b4c1904ec5f4aa	he retired in 1999  due to a neck injury against d-lo brown during a taping of smack down on 10/05/99  a fan threw a drink into the ring and no one knew. when d-lo went to do his move,because of the wetness it made him botch his move resulting in a droz landing improperly on his head|`|be942df757e0dae6bc559d4f38762a19aa	He broke his neck in a match years ago; Vince has kept him on the payroll.

cd023b628db4ffd97e9837ab845e37f8aa	Yeah, that Batista showdown seems to be the way they want to go... only potential thing they could do to make that matchup interesting is to turn Batista heel before then.     If they don't, I think it'll be wrong to have UT lose and ruin the streak. He's been a company man and a staple of WWF all these years, and is probably closing in on retirement soon. Why on earth would you have him lose to Batista? Batista is Vince's boy on SD and keeps being pushed... he doesn't need a rub from a loss to UT to build him up, Vince has already established him as the main guy on SD. Plus, Batista is old as well and might not be around in a couple of years... why ruin a huge streak like that to give Batista a win at WM when Batista's career and legacy will be nowhere NEAR UTs.    If they do go the route of turning Batista heel, then UT can win and have the streak intact.     Of course, creative can come up with something else within the time til WM, but since they are scrambling to come up with storylines on the fly because of HHHs injury, they might not come up with anything decent no matter what.|`|d586d8f84dc2516cefa5fbde0ee84a02aa	OMG u still have not heard?

That is a mistake waiting to happen. His WM streak is a real gem and it would be a crying shame to see him lose b/c at this point people want to see the Undertaker keep his streak going. It sets him apart from everyone else and makes him even more of a legend. My opinion is this: have him win the belt as the perfect send off and at the next Smackdown PPV have him put over Ken Kennedy. Kennedy is ready and beating someone like Taker will only make him a more believable/legit champion. That is what should happen. Will it happen? No. I have a question. What good would it do for Batista to win? People are sick of Batista being champ. Go to his IMDB forum if you don't believe me.|`|4875dc81ba708bcdfb6e1e220f8f4ff3aa	i hope he leaves i hate him

ba17ef8658568a16c93852400d7c2a52aa	Taker will go for the Heavyweight title.  My reasons for this are below.    Taker vs. Lashley: Isn't worth watching, Lashley isn't in the same league as the Taker.    Taker vs. Cena: It's been done to many times.  For those who don't remember, they use to go at it back when Cena first started out in the WWE.  Even though Cena lost going up against the Taker it made Cena better wrestler and caused him to step up his game.  By the time Cena became United States champ, Taker hasn't been able to beat him.  Cena would've beaten Taker if not for outside interference.  The only way Taker could beat Cena would be at a Wrestlemania.    Taker vs. Batista: For one its never been seen before.  Second the two are starting to build a feud.  Batista screwed Taker out of his title shot against Kennedy, he's calling Taker out on Smackdown.  In No Way Out they will lose to Cena and Shawn Michaels, due to their fueding and bickering.  This makes this the best Championship match in a long time.  It also keeps the fans guessing.|`|21ae604731b9eb8ea264cc40f292a9ccaa	world title|`|AA12203714	i think heavy weight smackdown|`|9yUyra5zaa	world heavy weight championchimp|`|3fff324b35960ff45afee0efc9467e71aa	The World Heavyweight Championship|`|aefe3bde5be0a280e11394ae5d28fbe3aa	heavyweight|`|5ab29bc1d518719aaa96bb570e6334a6aa	he is going after batista, hopefully. i want to see john cena vs. shawn michaels at wrestlemania 23.|`|1fb91005bcc4b74df6c2d59e940a1ef3aa	He is going for the SD title, Raw already has their potential main event with Cena, HBK, Edge, and Randy Orton.

Chris Benoit d Fit Finlay: Both men received great reactions. I'm not sure how much of this will be edited or not, but it wasn't due to mistakes. If anything, it would be due to length, as the match went 14:30. Benoit had the early advantage only to see Finlay take over working on the knee. Benoit fails in a suplex attempt due to selling the knee. Although Benoit finally capped off three back suplexes in a row, he still sold the knee. Benoit misses a top rope headbutt, which Finlay used to take a top turnbuckle pad off. With the referee distracted, Finlay went under the ring to grab Little Bastard, who for some reason was not coming out. Finlay nearly got counted out in the process. Out of nowhere, Boogeyman's music plays, and he emerges from under the ring with Little Bastard and begins to carry him off to the back. This distraction led to Benoit rolling up Finlay for the pinfall win.     Winner: Chris Benoit in 14:30     Post-match saw Finlay chase LB on the announce table and the two get into an argument. LB tries to run away, but Boogeyman is at the entrance, and LB gets caught between the two men. It seems as if they are going with a Finlay-Boogeyman program.     A graphic is seen with King Booker getting a Key to the City tonight, followed by a commercial plays for the Marine unrated DVD. (this would play four times during the night at different points)     They show Billy Gibbons from ZZ Top in the crowd.     Kristal interviews Vicki Guerrero, who states that she is returning to Smackdown soon despite the unsafe working conditions that GM Teddy Long allows. She states that there is an opportunity that has caught her eye that would lead to much success. She wishes Kristal luck for later tonight.     2. Deuce-Domino w/Cherry d Paul London-Brian Kendrick w/Ashley Massaro: Again, both teams received decent reactions from the crowd. This was not announced as a title match. London plays your face in peril, who hot tags to Kendrick. While Deuce and Domino didn't embarass themselves, they were a bit out of place at times during Kendrick's offense. London is hip-tossed over the top rope in a highspot, while Kendrick misses sliced bread. Deuce and Domino double team Kendrick, with one holding his face in place while the other rebounds off the ropes with a shining wizard for the win in 7:42.     Winners: Deuce and Domino in 7:42     Teddy Long and Batista are backstage. Batista demands an answer from the Undertaker tonight as to who he is challenging at Wrestlemania 23. Batista was cheered heavily.     King Booker's "Key to the City" ceremony is next. The "Ancient Order of Houstonians," whomever they are have given King Booker a key to the city. Booker receives very good heel heat from his hometown, and Queen Sharmell was very effective in her role, repeating the "All Hail King Booker" line many times. Booker reads from a sheet of paper in what looks like a prepared speech. He references famous Houstonians like Walter Cronkite, Roger Clemens, Patrick Swayze and the Houston Rockets, stating that their accomplishments didn't touch his. At times, Booker lost the fake accent and morphed into his normal voice, and even brought the "Five time-Five time WCW Champion" line out. He then tells the dignitaries to bow and kiss his ring. Some of them do. Booker then turns his attention to Billy Gibbons in the crowd. He goes out of the ring to address Gibbons, telling the legendary rocker to kiss Booker's ring. Gibbons, clearly having fun, motions with body language a "no." Booker then tells Gibbons to kiss his royal feet, again met with a non-verbal "no." At this point, Kane interrupts, chokeslams one dignitary while pushing aside the other two, and begins to punch Booker. After a big boot knocks Booker over the top rope, King Booker and Queen Sharmell escape via the arena floor. It seems that they are continuing a Kane-Booker program from Sunday.     3. Mr. Kennedy d Vito: There was no pre-match mic work for Kennedy. He pulls Vito's dress off, and finishes Vito off with a fireman's carry type somersault move standing on the second rope. (Finlay did the same move in WCW a few times but was always standing in the ring, not on the second rope) The post-match sees Kennedy choke Vito with his dress, and call for the microphone, which slips out of his hands at first. Kennedy then states his name once, but with more seriousness than usual.     Winner: Mr. Kennedy in 2:41     JBL then judges the Diva Bikini Contest with Kristal, Jillian (no more Hall seemingly) and Ashley. Ashley received the biggest ovation from the live crowd. JBL plugged Ashley as the future Playboy cover girl. The most audience applause wins. Kristal went first, followed by Ashley. Jillian then revealed a t-shirt and shorts, and cuts an anti-bikini promo, insisting on singing instead. JBL agrees, and Jillian launches into the Britney Spears song "Hit Me Baby One More Time" to a chorus of boos. JBL gets off two lines; "that sounds like Barbaro being euthanized," and "Michael Hayes did better on Badstreet USA." The second line was lost to the audience at large, although I heard a few people laughing in my section. Ashley then strips Jillian down to her bra and panties.     Teddy Long is backstage with Mr. Kennedy, who demands a rematch against Batista, bringing up the visionary fall from the Royal Rumble. Long grants Kennedy a rematch next week on Smackdown to a small pop from the live crowd.     They aired a promo for Vengeance on June 24. Tickets go on sale Saturday, February 3. Many arena ushers were passing out small Vengeance promo papers all night as well.     4. Miz d. Matt Hardy: As usual, Matt Hardy received a nice pop.

AA10580414	I think it depends on which way Gruden decides he wants to go.  The defense is getting a little old, and depending on what happens with Simion Rice, I could see them going after a DE like Jamaal Anderson.

5981536910b10187bd7f11cb716c6f18aa	yes    originated with a peach basket and a soccer ball I believe from a guy named Naismith who needed another game to play in PE class that could be played indoors    they didn't have a hole in the basket so you had to get the ball out by hand but there where very few baskets made in the early stages and there was no dribbling in the early rules and you only had a few selected shooters|`|HFgyL7Hmaa	History of Basketball  In early December 1891, Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physician from McGill University and minister on the faculty of a college for YMCA professionals (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA, sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an 10-foot (3.05 m) elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, so balls scored into the basket had to be poked out with a long dowel each time. A soccer ball was used to shoot goals. His handwritten diaries of the time indicate that he was nervous about this invention, which incorporated rules from a Canadian children's game called "Duck on a Rock", as many had failed before it.    Naismith's new game is quite similar to the game of team handball, which had already been invented in the early 1890s.    The first official basketball game was played in the YMCA gymnasium on January 20, 1892 with nine players, on a court just half the size of a present-day National Basketball Association (NBA) court. "Basket ball", the name suggested by one of Naismith's students, was popular from the beginning.    Women's basketball began in 1892 at Smith College when Senda Berenson, a physical education teacher, modified Naismith's rules for women.    Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the USA and Canada. By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools. While the YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from the YMCA's primary mission. However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void. In the years before World War I, the Amateur Athletic Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association (forerunner of the NCAA) vied for control over the rules for the game.    Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball. The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use.    Dribbling, the bouncing of the ball up and down while moving, was not part of the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls. Dribbling only became a major part of the game around the 1950s as manufacturing improved the ball shape.    Basketball, netball, volleyball, and lacrosse are the only ball games which have been identified as being invented by North Americans. Other ball games, such as baseball and Canadian football, have Commonwealth of Nations, European, Asian or African connections.|`|33891b158fb4f3101d3f97ed08180e1eaa	A basket full of peaches!|`|4909f6c47584b258424324ed86d8da55aa	it was started by a dude at the YMCA and he was asked to create a game that would keep football players in shape in the winter, so he had i think it was peach baskets that he put up on the walls and then i believe it started with 9 players actually, but a few years later was turned down to 5|`|bd82ce362621123b5b27d14370353449aa	It all started with the most brilliant mind ever of Dr. Naismith, and a ball in a peach basket.

HvXGG3oOaa	i do! i always said this myself. if cena turned face it would be better on his part because look at the rock for example. he came out and was supposed to be face and the fans HATED him...what did vince do? turned him heel for a while and for some reason the fans liked him better when he was cocky, && arogant. only problem is ppl say "john cena sells more merchandise as a face" but how do people know that? the rock sold MILLIONS as a heel so nobody knows that yet. and randy turning face would be a great twist of things to...just to see how the crowd would react. im thinking if randy and edge feud against eachother randy would deff get more cheers so it shouldnt be a problem :o)|`|289e5c6fc572ccc4dbd7e03a68af8700aa	that would be cool...i think it would be better if both of them were heel|`|PXbfGo16aa	I do Orton should turn face and I do believe he can get the fans behind him. and send john cena's sorry *** to smackdown as a heel Orton should be the next big baby face on raw it would be a new era|`|07d9e9d7d02df94b4fcf9417093272e6aa	ME!!!    CENA RULES|`|AA11892521	yes, it is time for new story lines. I think they have made Cena so popular and exposed to the public that it will have the same result as Steve Austin's heel turn, when it did not go over so within a few months he was a face again. If the writing team comes up with a good line it will work.|`|SiCQ8ZEKaa	keep em both heels|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	Orton has had two face runs already, neither of them were very good, if he wants to stay on a roll and keep momentum, he has to stay heel. As for Cena, he will, but not any time soon as Vince wants him to be the next big superstar, I guess you could call him neutral right now.|`|a9f990a8f2b66b48383cee118ce59c62aa	It would be exciting to see Cena turn heel but trust me Orton doesn't suit as a face.

His neck is bad, both his knees are hyperextended and he can hardly walk on them without the braces, and he's pretty much going down the same road as his buddy Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Steve is under contract with WWE Films, I believe, and is making movies, like The Condemned! However, he most likely will be making spot appearances like Hogan has been doing!

abcd489b8cea1f51d66f005dcf790335aa	Being an ex-wrestler ! Trust me i can prove it!   In the indie ranks you know who is going to go over.    What you do in the ring is up to you and your partner.   If you need to reverse a hold you simply squeeze that body part a little to let them know to reverse. Usually before hand i would send a message to the other guy that there were some moves or " spots "  that i would not do. You talk out your spots during what is called  rest spots. Like  a rear Chin lock. During a rear chin i would say   something like " duck, drop, clothes, clothes, drop., powder "  Then  I would whip them in , they would come off duck clothes line, I would drop down to belly, come back up to clothes line them, then drop kick and they would powder or roll out of the ring.

( and no, I don't work for them)|`|4102396a366b3f9a8fb14e8974a3532aaa	Do jump ropes, about 5 sets of 100 everyday.      Before you go to sleep and when you wake up, jump high as you can 10 times on both feet, then jump 10 times on left foot and 10 times on right foot.     Do leg workouts such as Leg extension,calf raises,  wall sits, and squats.    In a basketball gym, On each basketball hoop, try to jump and slap the backboard 12 times on each hoop. Do it everyday and increase your number by 2 every week.     Also the reason why "bad days" happen cause it sometimes depends on what you eat. You need to eat right and should always warm-up and stretch before you start your training. Make sure you don't overtrain. Take rest between days if you get tired and feel sore the next day. Good Luck|`|25c84b1db55682a84e81783cbb8e7af0aa	Do calf raises, but stand with the balls of your feet near the edge of a surface that is elevated at least 6 inches.  Let your heel almost touch the floor before raising up.  Calf raises on a level surface never were much benefit to me.|`|1FJSbtGsaa	Now I will give you some tips on How To Jump Higher:  Tip How To Jump Higher  1    Focus on building your calf muscles and quad muscles in your legs. These are the primary jumping muscles.     Tip How To Jump Higher  2    Nutrition To Fuel Your Body:  Eat 5 to7 times small meals throughout the day in order for your body and mind to perform at peak levels; as well as giving your body and mind nutrition to heal and repair itself through recovery. The foundation to your diet should consist of wet carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables, not dry carbohydrates like pasta, or white breads. Next you need your protein such as chicken, tuna, salmon, lean beef, and protein shakes.    Tip How To Jump Higher  3    Toe Raises - Stand as normal and slowly raise up on your toes, hold for a few seconds and lower back down steadily.    Do this 30 times, increase it overtime.    Tip How To Jump Higher  4    Make sure you get plenty of rest and sleep, this is essential to recovery, if you miss this you will not make gains, and you can cause injury or illness from lack of recovery.    http://www.squidoo.com/how-to-jump-highe...

She's a better wrestler and she's way hotter.|`|AA12074066	neither but if I've got 2 choose it would be Mickie James cause she is a way better champion than Melina. Melina acts like a dumba** so much that I'm getting tired of her and the paparazzi and her stuff. Mickie was a better champion than that and she didn't care one bit about Ashley M's playboy photo shoot.  I hope Mickie James wins tonight.

IcA635dnaa	The author of the book said that the RB from the team that beat them in the state final was the true Division 1 prospect.  He was going to Tennessee to play RB for the Vols.  He was in a car graduation night with some friends, his friends robbed a Convenience Store, and killed the clerk.  He was sentenced to prison for murder, and he never played a down.  So according to the author, Boobie was at best the 2nd best RB in Texas that year.|`|19c674502e9951f22ed06bcb59c43fbeaa	OK what does that have to do with football?|`|XP0a4cYQaa	basically the movie is what happened to him. he played 1 year of college before ruining his leg more, and had to stop playing for good.

Actually I think the hold was broken at least once. I forgot who the wrestler was but during the challenge, you saw Masters fingers separate and his hands come apart. No one mentioned it and Masters got his hands back right away.|`|rknbEJkzaa	No, the Masterlock will break him.|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	I think while he's in the hold it will be a sabatoge. While Masters locks it in Umaga will come out, and while Lashley's hands are swinging around in the air with nothing to protect himself, Umaga will land a Samoan Spike on him, and then Masters will keep the hold on him.|`|xjkvV1g9aa	No way.  The Masterlock is unbeatable.|`|QBubMH5Iaa	that masterlock challenge crap finally needs to be put into check and the powerful ECW Champion, Bobby Lashley, is just the right person to be the1st to break Chris Master's hold, not that it hasn't been broken already, but i'm saying legally they say it hasn't been broken yet.|`|f887b67e58a41048df5c6c43746c2695aa	no noone breaks my boys masterlock|`|a4f8e76a73948fe3cfe2b33a31a61f75aa	he will,he's way too strong for masters.|`|60414569b15854af0fceb969745c1cecaa	no but i know who can          MR.Kennedy!!!

Y SI NO ESTAN CONFORMES CON UN COMENTARIO DE FUTBOL, EN VEZ DE RESPONDERTE DE FUTBOL TE RESPONDEN COMO LO HACEN SOLO LOS INTOLERANTES E IGNORANTES DE TODO EL MUNDO, AGARRANDOSE DE LO QUE TIENEN A MANO.    ES ASI QUE PARA RESPONDERTE POR UNA CARGADA FUTBOLERA TE DICEN " SUDACA", "MUERTO DE HAMBRE", "DROGADICTO", Y TODAS LAS OFENSAS QUE TE PUEDAS IMAGINAR.  YO ESTOY EN CONTRA DE LAS PELEAS ENTRE PAISES, Y ME ALEGRA QUE PIENSES ASI, Y CUANDO HE TENIDO QUE HABLAR DE MI CLUB O DE MI SELECCION DE MANERA OBJETIVA, LO HE HECHO.  NINGUNA SELECCION Y NINGUN PAIS ES PERFECTO, Y EN TODOS LOS PAISES HAY GENTE POBRE Y GENTE RICA, Y NO POR ESO VOY A ANDAR BURLANDOME DE ELLA.

No soy idiota y puedo ver los resultados y las campa?as en las copas sudamericanas.  Ahora que tu planteo me parece medio mariconazo; ?que, vas a elegir seguir al  equipo que le vaya mejor, de acuerdo a tus "numerosas" ciudadanas..?...No se donde resids, pero tu nacin tendra que ser el lugar donde coms, si vivs en Mxico, tendran que sacarte a patadas en el orto por falso, vendido y traidor.

You'd be perfect for it actually, especially with standing aerial moves like a moonsault press, a flying hurricanrana, and a 180 seated senton (Molly Go Round). Why even limit yourself to one type of style?  Go for the triple threat, you could be the next Gail Kim or Molly Holly.

6507ff9957bc514453137ec3213d56e7aa	1st... of course we like skatergirls. 2nd it is hard, probably one of the hardest things you're going to learn in your life..that right YOUR LIFE...lol okay heres the low down.    Skating basics, place front foot behind the front bolts of the skatebaord and back foot on the tail or close to it whereever its comfortable. Keep the feet a little turned and your knees always bent..nobody skates standing straight up thats an easy way to munch pavement all the time. You push or kick with your back foot, always good to find a nice striaght area to practice...not a skatepark to busy, but a parking lot or something like that is great, something by some grass in case you need to bail off. If you want to stop you can drag your back foot, or drag the tail on the ground or just bail off. Once you get the hang of it you can move onto doing the ollie. Alway skeep practicing the more board time you put in the better you will be. Good luck and have fun.    http://skateboard.about.com/od/tricktips...  http://www.wikihow.com/Ride-a-Skateboard|`|1ffd5fdca622414f5c2eca5f074b5c54aa	get a skate board and learn.  hahahha|`|57e15c069d986e24d6e2841b5ea078abaa	I am a newbie too. And I quit because most skateboarders wherever I go do skating so they could get dates. It's like a dating service but the only thing you need is a skateboard and a few tricks up your sleeve (or should I say in your feet). If you are doing this to get close to a guy then I don't know what to do because it is not my specialty... But the first tip I will tell you is that your skateboard's primary trick hint is to kick down on the feet on the back of the board. then jumping while kicking the board and sliding your front feet to the nose of the board.|`|Tim6TiVtaa	Ok like limewire_usa said u have to put ur front foot ( right or left wichever fells best) on the front bolts. Then you have to push off slowly with ur back foot. Then put on about an inch behind the back bolts. Turn ur feet horizontaly. Push off as much as u need till u get at a speed u like. To turn just lean and lean ur feet the way u want to turn. And yea skaters like skater girls. Hope this helps and have fun..|`|7HF8sYoNaa	Find some guys who skateboard... Most skateboarder guys rarely talk to girls, so they will just love to have a chance to show you the tricks of the trade...

AA10785898	Go with easily digestible food at least two hours before the meet.  Things like bananas, bagels, and the like.  I usually do a banana, bagel with peanut butter, and some juice.      Don't overdue the hydration before the meet.  Sip some water.  Lay off any carbonated or caffeinated beverages.    But, you should experiment with this yourself to see what works best.  I don't have your digestive system or metabolism.    After a workout, I like recovery drinks like Endurox R4 or Cytomax, but plain water is just fine too.|`|28eec93453830c717339185d83d50205aa	Water before and during the meet  NO ENERGY DRINKS!!!  gatorade or powerade after the meet|`|c951078dd3604bae22ca31044fcf0dcaaa	I drink an energy drink that is totally awesome! It works really well especially if I'm going to work out. It works in 10-15 minutes after I drink it, lasts for several hours and it is HEALTHY unlike most popular energy drinks that contain high amounts of sugar and caffeine.

AA10031289	On October 13, 1997, the group officially referred to themselves as D-Generation X for the first time and debuted their signature slogan, "Suck it!"      D-Generation X (commonly known as DX) is an active professional wrestling tag team (formerly a stable) currently wrestling on the RAW brand of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Their gimmick is that of a group of rebels who do and say what they want, no matter how provocative. DX is generally considered one of the most popular stables in pro wrestling history. The group's original run was from 1997 to 2000, undergoing several roster changes during that time. After one-off returns in 2000 and 2002, DX reformed in June 2006 as the duo of Triple H and Shawn Michaels.    D-Generation X was formed during the genesis of what would become the WWF's highly successful "attitude era" in the latter half of 1997. Real-life friends and reported Clique members Shawn Michaels and Hunter Hearst Helmsley (who began being known simply as Triple H) were the original two members, along with Helmsley's bodyguard, Chyna and Michaels' "insurance policy", Rick Rude. On October 13, 1997, the group officially referred to themselves as D-Generation X for the first time and debuted their signature slogan, "Suck it!" They were often shown on television practicing sophomoric humor and rebelling against authority figures in the company. Their trademark "crotch chops" became one of the most popular gestures in pro wrestling while their "D-Generation X" T-shirts enjoyed considerable sales.    The name D-Generation X was possibly taken from an opinion column by Phil Mushnick which appeared in TV Guide, in which Mushnick lambasted wrestling's primarily Generation X fanbase as degenerates, dubbing them "Degeneration X". On the other hand, Michaels' autobiography would suggest that it was in fact then-WWF head writer Vince Russo who first conceived the moniker for the popular faction.    On-screen, however, the name was taken from Bret Hart who claimed that Shawn Michaels and Triple H were nothing more than degenerates. D-Generation X's first feud came against Bret Hart and his Hart Foundation. This feud ended at Survivor Series 1997 in the infamous Montreal Screwjob which led to Bret leaving the company along with two of the remaining three members of the Foundation. The only member that remained in the WWF, Owen Hart, continued to feud with DX, specifically Triple H.    "D-Generation X" was later used as the title for a WWF In Your House pay-per-view telecast on December 7, 1997.|`|AA11738321	I'd say August 11, 1997.|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	September 20, 1997: DeGeneration X is formed with Shawn Michaels, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and Chyna at the "One Night Only" PPV in Birmingham, England although they did not refer themselves as DX until October 13, 1997 on Raw in Topeka, Kansas|`|6mucnD27aa	1997.

A real warrior that will go into battle for you without asking questions.  Has never held anyone down, is more believable as he's not overly big, literally fought his way to get to the top before he was robbed of it.

Deserves more then he's gotten.|`|ucOO4qvXaa	You cant really choose between them as they have different styles of wrestling. Benoit is technical while HHH uses strength.

ZLN8HDYCaa	It makes all the sense in the world to bat Kinsler  2. Teixeira is struggling mightily right now, so why not give your hottest hitter more at-bats? It's almost as if manager Ron Washington is betting on the the other team. I can't see how batting Kinsler in the bottom third of the order would help the team. With 7 homers and 13 RBIs, Blalock, Sosa, and Wilkerson aren't getting on base much in front of him. Gotta move the guy up.|`|nbGkOL41aa	I think you leave him right where he is in the lineup, maybe move to  2 after (or if)Tex get's going.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Why mess with a good thing.  Hitting last in the order (I'm pretty sure he bats ninth) takes a lot of the pressure off.  Hes not expected to be putting up those numbers from that spot so its all gravy for him and the team.  They're winning games aren't they??|`|oWwKAFtmaa	becuz the rangers r not xactly loaded with offensive players. having kinsler in the bottom of the rotation gives them more balance. if they had all their best players in the top 5 of the rotation, they wouldnt have a chance 2 score runs in every inning. hes basically going 2 clean up the batters in front of him just like  4 cleans up  1-3|`|Kh1op5wraa	I know  He is on my fantasy team and doing amazing, I agree|`|WCHeU1Zlaa	forget A-Rod! the media should be talking about this guy's start. ive never even heard of him until i read this and yes, he should be placed as more of a 3-4 hitter with those numbers
mBIC75Ojaa	He is not a first round and probably not a first day QB...relax a little bit, he will play in the NFL but probably will be a back up.    Here is part of his scouting report from nfl.com    "Lacks the ideal height you look for in a pocket quarterback  Better suited for a spread offense  Will sometimes revert to a wind-up delivery, but still has the ability to get the ball off quickly  Best in the short-to-intermediate area, as some of his deep throws will sail even though he has the arm strength needed to fire up field  Seems to be more accurate throwing on the run than in his drops from center  Had character problems in high school and earlier in his Ohio State career, but has matured and joined the program his last two seasons (no further off-field issues and embraced his leadership role)  Is more quick than fast and. while he can buy time in the backfield with his scrambling ability, he doesn't have the burst or second gear to be a big running threat past the line of scrimmage  Has shown good maturity off the field, but is still sensitive to issues about his height and timed speed  Needs to tighten his throwing mechanics, as he will get sloppy with his delivery at times  Lack of height is sometimes an issue when he can't locate the receiver to make progression reads, being late getting the ball out  Needs to set his feet better, as he tends to throw off his wrong foot at times, especially when on the move  Tough to judge his pass set-up quickness, as he appeared more effective in the shotgun than when lining up under center."    His size is a problem and he needs a lot of work with his mechanics...scouts don't look at one game and decide if your a first rounder or a second day guy, they look and pick at every single little detail of your game.|`|GnCb89Fsaa	Troy was never going to be a 1st rounder. He isn't a good enough QB for the NFL although he will be drafted around 4th or 5th round|`|AA11078792	he aint goin in the 1st even b4 the bcs championship|`|tl7fd34yaa	i know is isn't going to get picked it the first round i know he is only 6 foot tall but look at Drew Brees, his height doesn't seem to be hurting his game|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	He is in the draft, but don't look for him to be drafted until tomorrow.

I believe his main reason for being there in the first place is because of who his father is.|`|d219f398667ad499e519d00810b31d7faa	I have no clue but its quite possible that Vince just wouldn't want some one like that on the roster|`|nCWwtG26aa	Idk, but i hope they don't fire him|`|lARHYGxTaa	I hope not, Randy Orton is kool|`|jOB0q41Raa	no. i think they will just make him a jobber for a while.     no title shots are championship reign for him.|`|7HUGlR5Oaa	I didn't know that Randy Orton was suspended because of THAT! I thought maybe he offended some divas like he did last time he got suspended! BUT WOW! How could one man cause $30,000 in hotel damages? What did he like bring in a bulldozer and tear down his whole room or something? THAT MUCH MONEY? Randy needs to grow up, he can't keep on getting in trouble and because of that he lost his privelege at the WWE championship contenders' race. The WWE needs to fire him if he gets suspended after this ONE MORE time.|`|QphfuVNraa	U GOT TO BE KIDDING!!

A miracle on 34th street would happen before he connects.    The ECW tag team title division would be okay. I would believe the FBI would dominate =D Tony marmaluke, Little Guido and Vito? Sick.

The one with the worst results would have to be when Owen broke Austins neck, when Lesnar brok Hardcore Holly's neck with a botched powerbomb, or when Chris Benoit was suplexing Sabu back in ECW and Sabu landed right on his neck and broke it.

Just because he excludes certian moves from his regular matches doesn't mean he's gotten worse.  I do miss the Downward Spiral and the Edgecator though, and he still does the Edgecution.  I wouldn't say he's entirely quit using anything though.  He's just holding off on using them so much, so when he does use it people will mark and enjoy it.|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	well the answer 2 ur question is obvious edge sux|`|efe43ee803a12447c48e218dafc98504aa	Yeah I guess so but I still love him.|`|1caeb00c2a9237bc7000403de8a3fed9aa	Edge has more skills than cena any day but yes to agree with you he is not using his main moves any more. but i do love the spear.|`|baf9e2ade94a5d2dda9ec0e484b0107daa	Yeah, I was going to say Edgecution|`|dbd321fb08640ea557f8ffb4b79535efaa	It's funny..that happens to a lot of people once they hit the main event. The wrestling moves/matches become a bit more cookie-cutter if you know what I mean. It's the same thing that EVERYBODY says about John Cena matches. And if you look close enough, all the best wrestlers have their set moves. Nevertheless, Edge reeks of awesomeness.|`|15eaddd8b8b69fba6f07c8adb9eb49f8aa	They toned it down a bit i guess. And unlike Cena, he has a better vocabulary of moves.    (BTW, how crazy, that the next song on my ipod, that plays, on shuffle, out of 859 songs, is Metalingus? Sickening.)    He used to do the Edge-o-matic, which kills. and the Edgecution, that definitely hurts like anything.|`|4c306af445ffb9071eb9dbca029d0b2faa	He was better in the old days

Smackdown should push Matt Hardy, London and Kendrick (they lost to Regal and Taylor too many times, and now Duece and Domino) the whole Cruiserweight Division and Chris Benoit. ECW... well where do I start? CM Punk, Sabu, Sandman, Marcus Cor Von, Dreamer, RVD and Snitsky.     Ric Flair, Balls Mahoney and Finlay are just done. Flair is 58, Finlay 49 (still a good wrestler but please) and Balls can't do ****.

Where are all the Extreme Rules Matches and the barb wire?|`|Yc64YEmIaa	here is who i feel needs a push:    RAW:  Carlito  why?: Carlito is a good competitor, and really needs to be more upscaled on raw than what he gets! he could be IC Champion material!    SmackDown!: Kane  why?: Kane is dominant and a fierce competitior, instead of his small pushes they could give him a title shot because he is World Heavyweight material!    ECW: CM Punk  why? CM Punk would be somewhat of an unorthidox champion, people wouldn't really see him being ECW Champion but it would be a major surprise!|`|fbea0241103b79de342ab096198837b6aa	lashley|`|cd5c48e1c20d9fe24006eb1ac7430a8caa	Raw: Carlito.

rH6A9N2raa	Sean Waltman? Why get rid of him, lets face it on the Kliq, Waltman was the low man on the totem pole (unless you consider Justin Credible a full fledged member). There is no way you can make a plan with out Kevin Nash going along with it "unknowingly". He's a mater manipulator, hanging onto his spot for years without any real kind of wrestling talent, just look at him now. As far as the last 3 points, I think Shawn was every bit as popular with the fans as Razor, maybe more so, it was Shawn in the main event of Wrestlemania, not Razor. As far as Shawn and Hunter not being able to compete physically with Razor, I think both of them have been in much more brutal and better matches then Razor (See Shawn-Undertaker series from the late 90s & Hunter-Foley 2000). Razor was fundamentally sound in the ring yes, but Shawn is easily better and Hunter is just as good. As far as charisma, its arguable that Razor is just as good as Shawn and probably better then Hunter. And I say all this a much bigger fan of Razor than any of the others that I mentioned.|`|d74df8708ab5e745bb04019bc61888acaa	How many know that hes asked this question before me two thumps up!!!!!!!!!!|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	I respect you for your theory. But believe me, these guys are all real good friends in real life. They would never do that to one another.|`|DfPOTCQQaa	What!why would anyone wanna read a paragraph that long.|`|D5xuT7bbaa	Nice conspiracy theory ... Utter crap but nice theory.  The 6 guys who made up the Kliq were backstage friends and drinking buddies and thats it.  Nash and Hall jumped to WCW for a whole truckload of cash.  Hall's later problems are sadly of his own making as he has an addictive personality.  Waltman is a big kid who refuses to grow up and Credible just was never able to get over.  HHH and Nash are the political ones who try to work things backstage whilst HBK became born-again sometime after meeting his wife (ex WCW Nitro Girl Whisper) and stopped the whole drinking partying thing.  You'll notice that a lot of the time he goes off camera when anything particurlarly risque happens in DX skits, its because of his religous beliefs.  Like any group of young 20 something males some of the group are drifting apart as they get older.  HHH is heavily in the McMahon family now.  Nash is trying acting more and more.  HBK is still wrestling but looking at exit stategies.  Hall is older fatter and sadly still suffering from his Demons.  Waltman is trying to get back through WSX and Credible ... I think he still works the minors.  Some still are in contact with the others some aren't.  None of them set out to make any of the others lives less pleasant.  Oh and one thing I have to call you on is HBK and racism - thats definitly not the case.

dbd321fb08640ea557f8ffb4b79535efaa	As a fan of wrestling, I feel for you, especially since it's WrestleMania and your first big PPV. If I missed out on seeing my favorite wrestler, I'd be just as ticked off.    But Hogan was not worth the amount he was going to be paid. And there's no way he would main event this show, not with UT vs. Batista and Cena vs. Michaels as the championship matches. I'm also not a fan of his; he's the most shameless self-promoter I've ever seen.|`|a17b35e9967bc374d22cc71313ffd671aa	probably because hulk hogan is old as hell,and also he was never involved in the attitude era of the wwe,he was in wcw at the time ,part of the NWO.Only thing i liked hogan in was when jeff jarrett hit him with a guitar in TNA.|`|ebe0fafc5ca650a372d9e8db799e89d8aa	Hope isnt dead yet, because there's still the plan of Hulk Hogan making an appearance at WrestleMania 23. Better still, there still is a slight chance of Hogan being in a match against Big Show at the event. Something like a repitition of history, like when Hogan bodyslammed Andre in Detroit at WrestleMania 3 20 years ago.   So keep your fingers crossed cause' when you least expect it, his music will hit and then....then WHAT YOU GONNA DO BROTHER WHEN HULKAMANIA RUNS WILD ON YOU??     PS: I agree that Hogan (despite all his personal problems) deserves to be at WrestleMania 23.|`|5042b6858e0898d3e34dcb998d2363f4aa	it sucks that he's not gona be in it he's like a legend but he's old and i dont think he can do it anymore  i love it when he says   WHATCHA GONA DOO BROTHA!!!!!|`|cG5uI8i4aa	Hogan is not going to be there for 2 reasons. 1. He demands all storyline and finish of the match approval before he will perform.  Secondly He demanded to make equal to whatever the top star booked is making in whatever match he wrestles in. So as an example Shawn Michaels who has busted his *** day in and out for 20 years and who has to leave his family to stay on the road constantly might make less than Hogan when Hogan will come in for just 1 match and then leave. Is that fair? hogan doesnt lose because he refuses to and wont wrestle if he's asked too lose . He has always been only out for himself. And always will be.He  should be putting younger guys over(letting hem win) in order to build them up.at his age but wont.You honestly think he cares about the people? He really only cares about his position and his money.|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	I agree and am not feeling good about it. Just let the guy come in and take Khali out. But I guess they are letting Kane take his place now. I mean they are in Detroit, where Hogan slammed Andre and the torch was passed to him. Don't critisize Hogan for his age, Flair is even older and still kicking.|`|44ad96283e79356923d3436a60b0ebdfaa	Hulk Hogan is nothing but a self centered pig.|`|XYUwFmvbaa	I understand ur concerns but times have changed, its not like in 80s when hogan was the best thing in pro wrestling  Hogan is too old now and way out of his prime and plus what would hogan do at mania ( not even wrestle) so y should vince waste his money on someone who refuses to wrestle|`|63c0ae0160be83f8dda5f3b0e669f342aa	he was supposed to be at WM as Trump's REP but hogan and vince had a falling out and they decided it would be Lashley instead of Hogan|`|AA12115495	I'm sorry, our time is up.

AA11140798	You did well for a first draft.  Don't really like Lopez at C, and I'd cut a backup OF for another P.  Your pitching is solid.  Three closers is a good idea in h2h, I've been known to draft four or five.  As for SP, you're decent there.  I like Young, Schmidt and the vastly underrated Bush.  Zito isn't bad, but I think I might look at trades with him Garcia and Glavine.  Look for pitchers with higher K rates.  Maybe you could get a Kazmir or Bedard or Olsen.  If you like to gamble Glavine for John Patterson is a trade that might be accepted.|`|1sDi7lA2aa	It's not bad at all, especially for your first draft. I'd fish around for a back-up catcher though, Javy is not what he used to be. You need Drew to become a star, Atkins to build or maintain last years breakout season and Lee to stay healthy.

c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	Start GM mode with 2 players. Turn money and Injuries off. Get a good roster, and make the second player have a crappy one. Set a good match card, and set no matches at all for the other roster. Then go to Options and set rerun. Keep doing reruns and the other show will have no fans, you wdont ned money and superstars can keep doing matches because there are no injuries. Trust me it is foolproof.|`|kFlfvrDqaa	Sim the boring matches and play the important matches.

He's the kind of guy who ruins the team chemistry. With the way this is going, he should stick to his pathetic rap career.|`|cuYYNA6naa	It effects the reputation of the NBA and players. he is hearing alot of boos in Sacremento, so it is effecting the city.|`|uT0y2Agwaa	i dont think it changes anything, maybe another suspension, but kings are done this year, and are on a downfall, they should consider doing some major trades this offseason|`|edd7d808c3f788194c458417efa3d691aa	it will effect his team because he is one of the best players on his team and he is one of the best defenders in the league. it effects the nba because it's bringing the program down. ron artest might face jail time and that is making david stern look bad because he is the face of the nba. i personally think ron artest needs counseling because this isn't the first time he has done something stupid. im not saying he's stupid but what he did is stupid and he has had too many chances so i think he needs be punished for real now

The PG is the floor general or a coach on the floor. He has to know the offense as well as the coach does. there's all different kinds of PG but you wanna be the leader. You need to create shot's for your teammate and think to pass before shoot. PG are almost always the smallest players but the fastest players. It a great honor to be the PG it's best because you'll always be touching to ball. Good luck with that.|`|HZiovynxaa	He  is usually the guy who gets the ball after it is passed and creates diversions so that his team can score, somthing like faking a pass to the left which causes the other team to go left, or pretending to shoot the ball when you're actually passing it...|`|8s9q4V03aa	point guard, thats the person than handles "the rock"|`|Tkq5ii6haa	Point Guard (PG), also known as "the ball-handler," is one of the five traditional positions of a basketball team. Typically, being quicker and shorter than even a shooting guard, the more speed a point guard has, the more likely he/she will be able to create separation and space off the dribble, which allows the guard room to work. While a shooting guard's primary responsiblity is to score points through perimeter shooting, a true point guard's job is to create scoring opportunities for his team. He does this by passing, setting up plays on the court, getting the ball to the teammate that he feels is in the best position to score, and dictating the tempo of the game. A truly great point guard will more or less control the game by how effectively he runs the offense.    They are often vocal floor leaders, at times discussing rule interpretations with officials. He must always know the time on both the shot clock and the game clock, the score, the number of time outs for both teams, and whom to foul late in the game. If a point guard has more size (height, muscle) compared to the prototypical point guard, it is considered a plus, but size is only secondary to knowledge of the game and skill. They usually exert a leadership role on the floor similar to that of a quarterback in American football.    After an opponent scores, it is typically the point guard who brings the ball down court to begin an offensive play. For this reason, passing skills, ball handling, and court vision are pivotal. Point guards are often evaluated more on their assist totals than on their scoring. Still, a first-rate point guard should also have a reasonably effective jump shot.  Many times, the point guard is referred to by announcers as a "coach on the floor" or a "floor general". In the past, this was particularly true, as several point guards such as Lenny Wilkens served their team as a player-coach. This is not as common anymore, as most coaches choose to call out the plays they wish to have run before each possession. Some point guards are still given a great deal of leeway in the offense, such as Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns and Allen Iverson of the Denver Nuggets. Both players have been given leeway to create their own plays on the court. But even point guards who are not given this much freedom are still extensions of their coach on the floor, and must display good leadership skills.    The styles with which point guards do their job vary widely from player to player. Speed is often cited as a necessity for the position, but this is not necessarily true. While players like T. J. Ford and Tony Parker thrive on being quick, many other point guards, like Mike Bibby and Kirk Hinrich, rely on savvy to lead their team. Likewise, many effective point guards help their team by being fantastic shooters such as Gilbert Arenas and Jason Terry of the Dallas Mavericks. There are many high profile point guards currently playing professionally, some examples include: Steve Nash, Deron Williams, Gary Payton, Chris Paul, Smush Parker, Tony Parker, Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, Mike Bibby, Baron Davis, Chauncey Billups, Sue Bird (of the WNBA), Stephon Marbury, Steve Francis, T.J. Ford, Allen Iverson and Kirk Hinrich.    Great point guards of the past include Bob Cousy, Lenny Wilkens, Walt Frazier, Nate Archibald, Magic Johnson (who was an unusually tall point guard, standing at 6'9"/2.06 m), Isiah Thomas, and John Stockton. Another great guard of the past, Oscar Robertson, combined the skills of a point guard with those of a small forward, becoming one of the first point forwards which eventually became popularized by Scottie Pippen.|`|fyF8qA8Jaa	Point Guard (PG), also known as "the ball-handler," is one of the five traditional positions of a basketball team. Typically, being quicker and shorter than even a shooting guard, the more speed a point guard has, the more likely he/she will be able to create separation and space off the dribble, which allows the guard room to work. While a shooting guard's primary responisiblity is to score points through perimeter shooting, a true point guard's job is to create scoring opportunities for his team. He does this by passing, setting up plays on the court, getting the ball to the teammate that he feels is in the best position to score, and dictating the tempo of the game. A truly great point guard will more or less control the game by how effectively he runs the offense.    They are often vocal floor leaders, at times discussing rule interpretations with officials.

I think they are going to have one of the easier roads to the finals, also AP, CB4, and TJ are going to play their best ball of the year.      I posted the question "Anybody else think the raptors are going to go somewhere?" before the all star break, and everybody said no.  Now that their is some hype around the raps, I feel like we can build off that and do some damage.    GO RAPS!!!
CR6sYBzgaa	What are you talking about SKY?!?! A&M won't have to pay that much to get Turgeon to go to College Station. It's a decent basketball  program in a power conference asking a coach with an above average program for a mid-major (makes tourny every 2-3 years).     If it was Chris Lowry from Southern Illinois, then I could see them having to pay something to lure him away, but that's just because he has the potential to turn the Salukis into a mid-major dynasty (like Gonzaga in the early 00's).     From a career standpoint there is no reason why he shouldn't take this offer. Now we don't know about personal issues (for example maybe he likes living in Wichita better than College Station). But if he turns it down it certanly will not be for the money.|`|ec98d07bfe5bfe255a0b28efc34464ccaa	i have no clue|`|UQvkioQKaa	Mark Turgeon, Witchita State

Carmelo and Iverson are great hoopers and I love watching their games. They are a true  inspiration on the court not to mention a source of endless entertainment. Unfourtanately the reality of sports is that many of the players are self consumed, egomaniacs who do not care about the fans. Sadly, I think this is the case with both Iverson and Anthony. I would not get my hopes up on meeting them and if you do you sadly you will probably be dissapointed. If I were you I would just watch the games, worship them for what they do on the court and not worry about meeting tham and their personal lives. I know this is probably not what you wanted to hear but sadly this is the truth.

J32e6Temaa	They will trade down and they likely take a defensive player. They have signed 3 O-linemen this offseason and traded for another and no way they pay 2nd overall pick money to any O-lineman. Best bet, trade down to TB 4th pick and they grab Gaines Adams, he fits the style of play Marinelli favors. If the Raiders pick Johnson then TB wont move up but now the Vikings and Dolphins suddenly come into play. They could have their pick between Quinn or Russell (both have serious QB issues) and the Lions decide between Jamaal Anderson, Omobi Okoye or Patrick Willis.  A big clue the Lions wont pick Thomas....Millens history is to never mention the guy he really likes and he has spent a lot of time talking up Thomas. Plus they are already paying Backus top 5 money and they traded for Foster (a former 1st rounder still making 1st round cash). They cant afford to pay a 3rd tackle big money with so many other needs. Marinelli wants to improve the defense, that is supposed to be why they hired him in the 1st place so why not pick guys he wants? They wont pick Quinn, they like Trent Edwards (Stanford QB) and he can be had at the top of the 2nd round, saves them a ton of bonus money. Plus if they deal out of the 2nd overall pick they will have more draft choices and in the long run it would cost them less money (we all know how cheap Ford is) for more players (and Lord knows they need as many new faces as they can get, the ones they have now arent cutting it).|`|MHRYLWZzaa	They will trade with the Cardinals and then take Gaines Adams with the  5 pick|`|dlgjPXD6aa	they will take joe for sure.    that isn't helping them this season though    im still a lions fan, (its hard to admit)|`|AA12288175	Brady Quinn. Lets be honest, Kitna is not the guy. The only way they trade down is if they get the word of the few teams behind them saying that they wont draft Brady. They can not draft another receiver because they have no one to throw it to them.|`|3823d01aa0a1b3df6709ae71a987ea49aa	I think they should draft Brady Quinn. A franchise QB that can start immediately and make an impact. However, the Lions think that Quinn, Peterson, and Thomas are not worth the number 2 overall pick and I dont think they could possibly take ANOTHER WR in the first round. They will probably trade down a few spots and possibly pick Gaines Adams.|`|mcSiBz1taa	if they aren't sold on brady quinn then going with joe thomas is the good choice. thomas should be able to anchor their offensive line for years to come. however, if they are sold on brady quinn he could finally be the qb that comes in and succeeds. he could even sit behind kitna for a year, much like carson palmer did with the bengals. the only reason they should trade down is if they are interested in quinn but think they can get him at a later pick. other than that trading down would be stupid with thomas and quinn to choose from at pick  2
5f72456c41b82b255f56533a0a73200eaa	Word, I feel the same way and I'm also from New York.    It's difficult comparing both of them because of their different strengths.

Even now, Alonzo has a dimension in his game that Curry will never have. Defense. 'Zo also has the experience and the defensive prowess to lead a team. He also has nice offensive numbers when playing a 30+ minute game. If I had a choice now, I would choose 'Zo over Curry despite age differences. Yes, I am a Knicks fan too.    Oh, yeah. If you have seen Eddy in Knicks game, his offensive powers aren't all that great. Sure, he is unstoppable at times, but missing a 5 footer 3 times in a row is unforgivable with his 'potentials'. You must also give credit to 'Zo for his filling-in when Shaq was out. He was great!|`|Tac70DHbaa	Well apparently you guys havnt heard of the curry line.  He hasnt been the player he was called upon to be.  he needs to be a big man more, he doesnt change the game as much as he can. now im not sayin he isnt a good player, he needs to be coached better, hes been in the league long enough to step it up and help the knicks win games.  Id take the 90's alonzo, like everyone has said you cant compare the 2 as of now.|`|UuIUxbZyaa	This is a ridiculous question. It's ALONZO alll DAY. Curry is nothing compared to Zo.

UIPfXH2Faa	Well aChoke Slam is:  A type of body slam in professional wrestling in which the wrestler grasps their opponent's neck, lifts them up, and slams them to the mat. It is very common in televised wrestling because it is simple and relatively safe yet looks powerful on camera. The chokeslam is typically used as a finisher by very large wrestlers, further enhancing its perception as a powerful maneuver. Though, this manouver can be more damaging if the victim is slammed into an object, such as a table or a steel chair.    The most common variety of chokeslam is performed with a single-handed choke. The wrestler places their free hand behind the opponent's back to help turn them horizontally for the throw. This is often used by big wrestlers because it emphasizes their strength.    Although a chokeslam begins with a "choke", it is not usually considered to be an illegal move. The single arm choke that normally precedes a chokeslam is known as a goozle      And a choke bomb is:  A wrestler lifts an opponent in a standard (one-handed) chokeslam but then while slamming the opponent down the wrestler would drop to a seated position, slamming the opponent between the wrestlers legs.  The move is also known as a Seated/Sitdown/Sitout Chokeslam, or a Choke Driver    The name chokebomb can also refer to a sit-out two-handed chokeslam.    id have to say a choke bomb is more powerful and looks cooler|`|AOqioGNaaa	ChokeBomb is 2 hands.Chokeslam is just 1 hand|`|61a4f62e04ab4f76dcc344cb6d70f656aa	chokesalm is with one hand(usually done by kane,undertaker)  choke bomb is with the two hands(done by the great khali)    i think that the choke bomb is more powerful as the two hands are used to apply more energy...but the chokeslam is for the good ones as only one hand is used|`|63c0ae0160be83f8dda5f3b0e669f342aa	bomb is w/ two hands and way over ur hand  chokeslam is better|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	chokeslam is one handed, choke bomb is two handed chokeslam is more powerful, you must grasp their throat harder to slam them down

DbB2yCJ7aa	This isnt the pros. This is highschool football the only risk you have of getting damage in the long run is the same risk you have with any other sport (except maybe tennis) you shouldnt be worried about it at all. Even if you look at the AFL and CFL those guys dont have long term effects that are very bad at all. The only guys who have these problems are the 10-15 year veterans of the NFL. Yes you will have soreness and fatigue but that is with any physical sport. Its not going to have the type of long term effect that you will get on a professional level though by any means. You being worried about this on the highschool level is misguided and stupid. Dont be worried and scared of the sport, because when you play scared you do get hurt.      i like T Bagginz answer.|`|a3a49e421f116d5f0745e5947d9d7084aa	What sort of damage?  The idea is to play, enjoy the sport because it is what you love to do. If you worry about getting hurt, when that's when injuries occur.|`|fZiYawrxaa	if your good enough then it wont damage you|`|nHAz7OzIaa	that's the risk yuo take to have fun.

Just make sure you strength train which helps limit little nagging injuries. Don't be timid when you are playing go all out and trust your equipment and you should be just fine.|`|KjNu0XD4aa	oh it will|`|219328603224376ed4f2fddbe0232acbaa	Football is a rough sport, but you don't see too too many people being killed or ending up with a career ending injury now do you?    No you don't.    There's a chance you can get hurt, but if you build up correctly and know how to play and not make too many mistakes, you'll be fine most likely.    Now go grow a pair then go play some football.|`|DU2220xsaa	Of all of those positions, RB is most likely to cause problems since you'll probably have more touches than the other two positions combined (assuming you start). Plus, you'll be running into defensive lineman and linebackers who pack a mighty punch. CB's probably have the least injuries.     Still, it's very doubtful that you'd actually sustain long-term damage. A few years ago, a torn knee ligament would be a career-ending injury, but nowadays they're commonly fixed.     Bottom line, you can't play at a high level if you're afraid of getting injured. So you either need to get over it by getting tackled a few times, or you need to find a new sport. Playing cautiously will probably create more injuries than if you were going full-speed.|`|aycZKIiFaa	life is about chance and playing football is freakin awsome and many people who wanted to play and didn't ended up regreting it, so if you want to play do it|`|AA11224700	then don't play.......|`|NaI2wAHzaa	Cross country and soccer actually have a higher incident of injuries than football (and girls cross country has the worst level of injuries).  Of course, football injuries are usually more dramatic than the shin splints and rolled ankles which make up the majority of cross country and soccer injuries.    No matter what sport you play, you are likely to incur some sort of injury.  Play what you want to play.  Worrying about an injury will only make it more likely that you will be hurt.|`|YYvE9b9Yaa	dont puss out. lol u should try out 4 cheerleading then instead.
h0jDSxL2aa	Chuck Norris vs Chewbacca and Han Solo    Round 1:    Chewbacca begins the round by attempting to fire his Bowcaster rifle at Chuck Norris, but unfortunately Chuck Norris is way too fast and before getting the shot off the Bowcaster is flying off into the stands via roundhouse kick.  Han Solo whips out his blaster pistol but the pistol follows the same fate as the Bowcaster.  Round 1 belongs to Norris.    Round 2:    Chewie and Han, both now unarmed, foolishly attempt to double team Chuck Norris in a brawl, but are taken down by a single roundhouse kick.  Round 2 also goes to Chuck.    Round 3:    Chuck Norris attempts to finish the match by preemptively striking Chewbacca in the face.  Spider-Man, who is refereeing the match, calls a foul on Chuck Norris, which subsequently earns the wall crawler a roundhouse kick to the sternum.  Round 3 goes to Han and Chewie.    Round 4:    Invigorated by their recent round victory, Han and Chewie attempt to win the hearts of the judges:  Fozzy Bear, Princess Leia, and Dick Cheney.  Fozzy Bear, feeling a sort of kinship with Chewbacca, awards the round to Han and Chewie.  Dick Cheney, being an all around American, awards the round to Chuck Norris in honor of his valiant defense of the constitution in Invasion USA.  It comes down to Princess Leia, who gives the deciding vote to Han and Chewie.  Chuck Norris is disgusted by this obvious bias and puts the Princess on his death list.    Final Round:    Pulling out his most brilliant move yet, Chuck Norris wows the crowd by counting to infinity twice in the span of 6.3 seconds.    Everybody is amazed and Han Solo's mind explodes.  Chewbacca, left alone in the ring with Chuck Norris, attempts to flee but is no match for Chuck Norris' blindingly quick roundhouse kicks.    Chuck Norris wins!|`|efc61530e06da2393cbd78b8787fb990aa	Chuck Norris !|`|c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	Chuck Norris|`|2add90f7d2ea385d6260d958dc907d43aa	Chuck.

7ab1c2a579a41278f79980e838cf7605aa	Not really. I've seen some "expert" mocks having him go in the top 10. That's not happening either but I say he's an 11-18 guy. I can see the Chiefs moving up, with the loss of Hall and the addition of a few more picks, to get him. I think that's part of the reason why they traded him. They needed more picks to package together to move up. Who knows what they'll do though. They only held a workout for Robert Meachum so it doesn't seem like they will take a WR at all. I still think they will though.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Its possible, I think part of the reason they made that deal getting rid of Hall was because the Rams were looking really hard at picking up Ginn.  Thats one less team to worry about now, they wanted him because he could be a return man and reciever - they just filled the return man part.  Personally I would rather have Dwayne Bowe or Robert Meacham than Ginn, though.  Both those guys are fast, but they're also bigger and can go up high and bring the ball back Chad Johnson style.  Any of those 3 are going to vastly improve the recieving corps, assuming they don't turn out to be another Snoop Minnis.    GO CHIEFS!!!!!!!|`|DbB2yCJ7aa	I am a diehard OSU fan and your right he has great open field speed, but the thing that gets people is his amazing acceleration. This years draft he is a real toughy to put somewhere. It basically depends on which team loses the player that they originally wanted and then decide that Ted Ginn Jr. is the best one out there for them. I think it is possible for him to go anywhere from  7 all the way down to as you said, the Chiefs.|`|AA11308937	I think there is a slight possibility of Ted Ginn Jr. dropping to the  23 spot. It's also possible that he may be taken as high as  13 to the Rams. I think the Rams may be interested in Ginn because Isaac Bruce is getting old. They need a young playmaker at the receiver position who can fine-tune his game in the last few years that Isaac Bruce has with the Rams. But if the Rams don't take Ted Ginn Jr, then there is a high possibility that he'll drop down to  22 to the Cowboys or  23 to the Chiefs because not many teams have WR needs.    Just for you and everyone else to know, Ginn has been timed at as fast as a 4.28 in the 40-yard dash so there's no reason anyone should say he isn't fast.|`|fZiYawrxaa	we need him but we also need help in a lot of pos to|`|44KDa3v4aa	he mite be there, he could run back some punts for us and he's a deep threat too, we could definitely use his speed    GO CHIEFS!|`|wOnOuwDkaa	i say the titans will get him.|`|DE9CQLxSaa	O Ya the chiefs will steal them hell b there for the chiefs|`|Va3E6Mokaa	From what I have heard, there are some concerns as to Ginn's durability and the lack of precision in his route-running.  Falling as far as 23rd overall is realistic, suggesting that he may fall out of the first round is not.|`|NEFwWnQLaa	I guess it can happen.  I, honestly, don't think that it will happen, but the draft is nearly unpredictable, so you never know!|`|GVgVZtaVaa	I don't see Ginn slipping all the way to 23rd, too many teams see a lot of potential in him.   I think he may be overrated as a first round pick.  He is too small to be an effective as an everyday wide receiver and that makes him strictly a return man and I think the value of returnmen is exagerrated in the NFL.

i0O0DAieaa	It might do with your jump. When you take a regular jumpshot, you probably release your shot at the wrong time but when you fadeaway you release at the right time. There are a lot of people who are accustomed to it. LeBron fades away with his jump shot and hits a decent percentage but you'd probably be more effective when you can shoot regularly.|`|V18wAz0Laa	maybe u follow threw on ur fade away and some how dont do it with ur other shot|`|aKxXAnjKaa	maybe you perform better when guys are all up on you??    less basketball, more english class.|`|x15BSC3yaa	well, maybe you should try shoot a fadaway when you are wide open...and then shout, 'kobe!'|`|8cc30f1029cd73207f290e48b2383af3aa	You probably have a better form and follow through more off the fade.

This move is usually used against a moving opponent for effect.|`|b94091a164d2556c86cb5b0f1c529062aa	It's a clothesline, its just running with your arm stretched sideways and your arm must hit the opponent's head.|`|9PWQ4YJKaa	It's a running hit with the arm, hitting the opponent either on the head or upper body, taking the opponent down.|`|JKfOgkPZaa	First of all it's spelled clothesline not closeline.    The basic principal behind it is to extend your arm to either side of your body.  You'll generally connect with this chin to neck area of the other person's body.  During this move you want to be to the side of the other person, and not head on.    Depending on your size will determine where exactly you strike.  One of the most notable examples is the Clothesline from Hell in which the momentum is so fast that the other person literally flips after contact.
ReBRC1Dxaa	what the judges look for really depends on what area yooh are in..in kentucky they look for sharp motions,good tumbling.spirit,flexibility,how well yooh work in different areas of a stunt group [flyer,base,or backspot]. doing tumbling can really help with your tryout score and it will help later on b/c all of the girls who dont know how to tumble very well will hold back the team...|`|pZVASgzSaa	some chearleaders are hot|`|q6H4VMPoaa	Besides what you describe, I think they grade your body.

zxD6U5i3aa	They are one good draft away from the Super Bowl.  First things first, those guys don't know anything about anything.  They are picking so late......who are they going to get anyway that late who will make that sort of impact.  I'm sorry, but no second rounder is going to do that unless they draft a Marcus Colston, or a Terrell Davis type player.  What they fail to realize, is that if they make a couple more plays against Indy last year we might be talking about the Super Bowl Champion Patriots.    Also, they say all that and then forget that the Pats had been in talks with the Raiders for Randy Moss (whom they landed Sunday Morning).  So in essence they are right when they say that they are one good draft away from the Bowl......right one great move on Draft Sunday morning to acquire the guy that pretty much locks up their division and gives them a couple extra plays which might take them to the big game.    Also, these are the same ESPN draft experts who had Brady Quinn going in the top 3, lol.  They are so ful of shhhhhhhhhhh.    Wish I was talking this way about my Cowboys.|`|so5F4sixaa	they could be building up 1st and 3rd round picks so they can trade for...........

The reason is because they only had thier eye on one guy. They got him and could care less. Now they want more picks because thier team is beginning to age.|`|p7f5SEIwaa	they preety got a lil backup for that well oiled defense that they put together and they got a couple more draft picks to maybe get randy moss.|`|GnCb89Fsaa	How dare a couch potato like you sits there and questions the Patriots. If all of the commentators are so knowledgable about how to build a team, my question to you is, "why are they commentators and not NFL GM's?|`|AA11926496	they are planning on having a good team already this year and dont need anybody right now...so they decided to wait til next year..and w/ myb getting moss its looking even better|`|AA11589899	because the patriots suck.  their reign is over and has been over.  They are not one good draft away from the superbowl, they are a decade and a half away from the superbowl.  So saddle up man, you are in for a long ride, and it is only going to get worse from here on out.  In two years they will be at the bottom of the division.  Dolphins, Jets, and Bills are all improving and the Pats are getting worse.  But you probably are just one of those bandwagon fans that started liking the Pats after they cheated the raiders.  so you won't care when they start losing, you'll just jump on the next AFC championship team.  loser.
33IL5mPkaa	Las artes marciales consisten en prcticas codificadas que tienen como objetivo el someter o defenderse mediante diversas tcnicas que colocan a un oponente o varios en situacin de inferioridad. Existen varios estilos y escuelas de artes marciales que excluyen el empleo de armas de fuego y otro armamento moderno. Lo que diferencia a las artes marciales de la mera belicosidad con violencia fsica (peleas callejeras) es la organizacin de sus tcnicas en un sistema coherente y la codificacin de mtodos efectivos. En la actualidad las artes marciales se practican por diferentes razones que incluyen el deporte, la salud, la proteccin personal, el desarrollo personal, la disciplina mental, la forja del carcter y la autoconfianza; adems, puesto que el significado estricto es el de "artes militares" por extensin se aplica a todo tipo de forma de lucha cuerpo a cuerpo y a las artes militares histricas; por esta asociacin con la lucha y con las armas, incluye conocimientos relativos a sistemas que tradicionalmente se han considerado modalidades deportivas (ej. el boxeo, la esgrima, la arquera y la lucha libre). En palabras simples, las artes marciales son estilos de combate con armas antiguas (tradicionales) o sin ellas, que, como todas las artes, tambin son una expresin del ser humano y no son necesariamente concebidas de manera sistemtica o cientfica.    El origen remoto de las artes marciales se remonta a la pre-historia; un ejemplo de ello lo tenemos en las artes aplicadas durante la guerra de Troya. Al contrario de la creencia popular, las artes marciales no nacieron como un metodo de defensa, sino como un complemento de la meditacin (lo que es bastante factible tomando en cuenta que el arte marcial ms antigua, prevaleciente hoy en da, es el Kalaripayatu, un arte marcial hind, ms antigua que el Kung Fu, siendo, el abuelo de las artes marciales) No todas las artes marciales nacieron en Asia. El Savate, por ejemplo, surgi en Francia y los movimientos atlticos de la Capoeira vienen de Brasil. Aunque el origen autentico de la Capoeira se encuentra en frica, pues la prctica por parte de los esclavos de origen africano (******, mulatos y zambos) la disimulaban ante los amos (negreros) alegando ser danzas tradicionales. y chan chucxib da sus centones en la actualidad|`|22edda633fcc2e8b808fb7feed4e77e9aa	A mi me encanta el kung fu, es lo maximo para mi, quizs habras sido por ver tantos Power Ranges|`|fKjXTEB6aa	para mi sin lo mejor q puede existi     como tu lo dices fueron dise?adas para la guerra para q los guerreros de tiempos atras se defendieran ya q antes no existian tantas armas y las batallas eran a mano limpia y como la tecnologia y ano permite ese tipo de guerras se fueron enfocando mas en un deporte y defensa personal|`|cde69ce736eb308fdb6c14cfa41eb015aa	asi es estoy deacuerdo contigo     aparte que hoy en dia nos sirve como dijeron arriba para el dasarrollo fisico y mental     de hecho de eso habla mi tesis de cinta negra|`|qCHIoxQmaa	te lo hago corto, creo que ya respondieron bastante igual, es completamente al reves, primero fue algo mas filosofico o espiritual como quieras llamarlo, y luego se transformo mas en artes de guerrra. pero no te preocupes antes pensaba lo mismo que vos, lo que pasa es que es demasiado extenso como para explayarlo aqui|`|2bElsKWwaa	Las artes marciales, sobretodo las mas antiguas nacieron de la mano de la medicina china, como el taichi y las artes marciales que se denominan "internas"...

Segn lo aprendido en mi recorrido por las Artes Marciales, los orgenes de las mismas se pierden el  tiempo y su procedencia es dismil, no todas las Artes Marciales provienen de Asia.     Si nos guiamos por orden cronolgico, si, primero fueron las Artes Marciales y despus la filosofa que es inherente de ellas,  pero si tomamos como referencia el Templo de Shaolin, que es donde surgi la madre de la mayora de las Artes Marciales, no es as, primero fue la filosofa y luego el Arte Marcial, ya que esta se introdujo en el templo como una forma de entrenamiento corporal y mental para los monjes, dado sus precarias condiciones fsicas.|`|442bd0dfa3befaece190b0b05274769daa	son deporte, fisico y mental.

H1bkZXw7aa	It's tough to help without seeing you swing.  I'd suggest going to the local batting cage and just start hitting.  Adjust your stance every round or so and see what helps.  If you have a friend with you, then they may be able to help by spotting problems with your mechanics.    When I was struggling with my swing, I'd try to go to the cages every Saturday morning and rent a cage for thirty minutes.  It made a huge difference.|`|8531ad23f07efdb2af658b8bf062727faa	step back about 1 to 1/2 inch from the plate....then just hit it as hard as you can....I batted .650 last year|`|yCL1Jdlqaa	Hi Chad it's me Samantha and I found this article and thougfht it might be helpful to you good luck in your practices and if you need me I am always here ....     :)         Cal Ripken, Sr: The Ideal Hitter  The ideal hitter would probably have a combination of these qualities: strength, determination, coordination, confidence, vision, rhythm, style, body control, quick hands, and the will to learn and to take advice. The following is a list of batting tips that can help anyone become a better hitter.   Select a bat you can handle.   Learn the strike zone - don't swing at bad pitches.   Keep your front shoulder and chin tucked in, and your hands back. Turn your head so that both eyes are on the pitcher - don't look around your nose. Stay on the balls of your feet - keep off your heels. Keep your head still.   In order to get the bat started, move your hands back slightly as the pitcher is getting ready to release the ball. If you like the pitch, go ahead and hit it. If you don't like the pitch, then hold up your swing.   Take a short step and stride - a long stride will only throw you off balance.   Stay on top of the ball. A slight downward swing allows this and is a good way to keep from upper-cutting. Keeping the front shoulder in and down also allows a hitter to get the bat head out in front and prevents dropping the back shoulder.   Learn to hit your strength. Every hitter has a strength just as every hitter has a weakness. Hit your pitch. When you get it, don't let it get away. Concentrate on solid, hard contact.                Mike Piazza: Fundamentals of Batting   In 1997, Mike hit .362, the highest batting average for a catcher in more than 50 years, and racked up a slugging percentage of .638. With 40 homers, 124 RBIs, 104 runs, and 201 hits, Piazza had the greatest offensive season of any catcher in the more than 100 years. Here are some of Mike's baseball batting tips:   Look for a good pitch to hit.   Have a quick bat.   Stay inside of the ball so you can hit the ball to all fields.   Try to spread your feet a little wider than shoulder width for balance.   Hold your bat at a 45-degree angle to alleviate unnecessary movement in your swing.   Keep your back elbow close to your body to help your hands and the barrel of the bat swing through the ball.   Have someone watch you while you swing and check your mechanics.                Tony Gwynn: Tee for One  For me the most effective way to practice hitting is to use a batting tee and a bag of wiffle balls. Tee it up and start hacking. The sooner you can hit a wiffle ball cleanly off a tee, the sooner you will become a better hitter. When you hit a wiffle ball off a tee correctly, it acts like a knuckleball. You can hear the air going through the ball. When you don't hit it correctly, you create spin on the ball and it goes all over the place. When the ball spins alot, I make adjustments to correct my swing. Even after 18 years in the big leagues, every winter I go home and break out the tee and wiffle balls. It's not the most exciting thing, so you have to be creative. I put my headphones on and listen to my favorite music while I concentrate on my hitting technique.             Andre Dawson: Hitting Philosophy  "I never considered myself a home run hitter," says Andre Dawson. "I had quick hands, a quick bat, and the ball would jump off my bat. But I always liked to focus on hitting for average."   Be patient and selective.   Try to avoid the temptation to be overly aggressive and simply focus on putting the ball in play.   Try to use the entire playing field.   Do not be afraid to wait on the ball.   Approach the plate with a plan in mind. Think thoroughly about what you are trying to do, but try not to force anything.                Manny Mota: Approaching the Plate  Concentration, rhythm, and purpose are some of the most important aspects to hitting, according to legendary Dodgers outfielder Manny Mota. "Hitters should take short strides and use quick hands," he said. "Taking a short stride actually helps your hands be quicker. It keeps your swing compact and under control."   The most valuable advice that I can give a young hitter is to think about hitting the ball up the middle. If you think about hitting up the middle, you can adjust to hit the ball wherever it is pitched. If you go to the plate hoping to pull the ball and hit a home run, you will have trouble hitting an outside pitch. Your front side will have already opened up and you will not be able to drive an outside pitch.   Concentration at the plate is critical, and positive thinking helps. You have to walk up to the plate saying to yourself, "I'm going to hit the ball".   You have to have balance in everything that you do in baseball, especially in hitting. Your body is going to move, but you must keep your head still. The only way to do that is to have good balance.   A hitter needs rhythm. Try to watch the pitcher's hand and keep your eye on the ball.   Be aggressive at the plate, but also remain loose and relaxed. If you let your arms get too tight, you will lose the advantage of having good wrist action, as well as your power.   If you find yourself in a slump, try to concentrate on defense and possibly save the game with a good play. Slumping hitters should remember that it does not always take a home run to help the team.   You should have a purpose to each swing in batting practice. In your first round of batting practice you might concentrate on hitting every pitch to the opposite field. In the next round, try to make sure that you are swinging down on the ball. Prepare yourself for game situations, or the practice will not be as helpful as it could be.|`|3oHTV9Mtaa	it doesnt really matter what your stance is.  I am an 8 time asa state champion A class softball player and i will use 3 or 4 different stances my self.   How is your bat speed??  Only 2 reasons for hitting grounders and pop ups.............Weak wrists with no bat speed and swinging at bad pitches or way out in front.  You ever play baseball??  Maybe out in front and slowing your swing down as you get to ball to make contact??  Dont know what your problem is but i can tell you it has nothing to do with stance.|`|9EWV0YJNaa	I had a similar problem last year which was my first year playing in over 10 years.  I'm the same height as you and I was standing with my feet too far apart and my stride was WAAYY too long.  So, I stood with my feet a little closer and took a much shorter stride relying more on arm strength and then by the middle of the season, it all came together.    As for hitting to the opposite field, try turning your hips toward that field and wait a split second longer to begin your swing.|`|V7hKcQi4aa	Got some pointers for you. Someone talked about stance, it really doesn't matter what kind of stance you have but you should get to the same point as someone who does drive the ball. When you say you are hitting grounders and pop flys that is a bit confusing. Grounders meaning, weak grounders to the short stop? and Fly balls where?   Disregard, If you are not hittng the ball hard, you need to start thinking the center of the ball. In slo pitch you have to wait. Start practicing on letting the ball come to you and not getting out front. I can bet that most of the time you are out in front on the front foot instead of waiting and using your back leg.  As far as hitting the other way--wait for a pitcher on the outside corner and hit the ball back in your stance, but again center the ball.    Most importantly, to create more ba speed and strength in your swing think about these key points in creating your swing.  Hitting    1. Stride and Separation- a short step forward with weight going slightly back on back leg. 40-60 split. Also hands separating back as you take the short stride. Make sure hands go back about 3-6 inches, keeping a flex in your front elbow, dont lock it out. Hands should go straight back not up or down. Head doesnt move forward, key to stay still! (Practice by dry work, soft toss and T-Work.)    2. Backside turn- the swing starts from the ground up, and back foot must lead before anything else. Term: squashing the bug. Get on the toe. Hands do not move forward stay going back. Make sure front hip, shoulders do not move as well. (Practice by dry work and soft toss or also t-work.)    3. Front Leg Straight, Knob of Bat inside Ball- wherever the pitch is, think inside. First starts with front hips rotational turn clearing way from back leg and hands. Take knob of bat, shoulder and head inside the baseball ball. Shoulders rotate across no dipping.  At impact, front knee is straight, front elbow is straight and you are finishing behind ball.     4. Finishing the swing and balanced- Full turn with back foot, and weight should be back and finish balanced  behind the ball.

AA11480859	after he punted vince's head i would say orton, only if he keeps it up|`|KwQlQJZ3aa	Stone Cold wasn't tough he was crippled.  He was a rebel and the fans loved that.  Well the women, and the men liked that he was a redneck.  So those 2 combined made him an icon for the WWF for years.  But this is a new generation of people getting spotlight they dont athletically deserve.  IE, John Cena.  He's a baby face for the kiddies to pick up on and as long as the children love him he'll be on top and. essentially unbeatable just like stonecold.    Note:  The only people able to beat John Cena or Stone Cold have been as follows:  HHH (Stephanie)  The Undertaker (The Real GM of the WWE)  And The Rock (Never fought Cena but its assumed he'd win because he truely is athletic and probably more deserving of a title then any of the men mentioned.  And I'm not even a fan.)    Aside from John Cena the only person thats considered unbeatable like Stone Cold was is Triple H, and we're seeing that more and more, I mean come on, beating the great kahli in an arm wrestling match, thats just dumb.  Having him beat Kahli?  Pointless.  You get the point.|`|zzIj5bN5aa	as a arapper it was john cena but now it would be triple h (the next best thing)|`|3nN1vTTuaa	i think it would be triple H, because of the disrespect shown to Vickie Guerrero over the past 2 months.

In effetti i soli sostituti sarebbero stati Iaquinta e Inzaghi, e per me sono entrambi in forma.

He wants too much $|`|41a325ac3c7e9a44f30b472dfc86b4beaa	yes....obviously        ...it's like people have never seen a holdout/contract dispute before....|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	He will be on the roster this year. We lookin at Kitna, Culpepper, and Russell. A good trio of QB's. Though not as good as Randall Cunningham, Jeff George, and Dante Culpepper who had the better offense.|`|2rqtYBEHaa	i think that the raiders will offer him a contract soon|`|RrQBIaF9aa	Of course,He was not projected to be a instant starter anyway.If he allows Culpepper to get "HOT" with this team his value will even further diminsh.I don't expect it to be too long either and RAIDERS FANS should pray he isnt a first round BUST! to the likes of RYAN LEAF.|`|f195701a7ce0bf203ba2947057d0e608aa	yes he will, now that the raiders have culpepper they dont need him as much as he need them he needs to get into camp soon or he wont even start this season|`|yLPvFFnGaa	most likely yea, unless he holdouts for whole year, but he will make the team if he gets signed. I believe a deal is going to come soon because the 2nd pick overall has signed. This is bad for him because he is a rookie and he needs to learn the system and develop chemistry with recievers|`|pq8MUIckaa	If you can pry the wallet out of Al Davis' cold (almost dead) hands.    They would be insane not to sign him. I mean come on, McCown or Culpepper? They know they do not have any serious QB's in contention for the starting position.     Go Broncos!
f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	The WWE is smarter than that from the last Bart Gunn VS Butterbean fight. Hardy has 2 cornermen with him. MVP comes out with an entourage. Evander has his own Titantron video. MVP makes Buffer introduce him first, right down to "straight up ballin'" The crowd did the "What" chant during the referee's instructions!    Hardy is wearing a boxing helmet.. Holyield isn't. MVP keeps getting on the apron to give him instructions. Holyfield knocks Hardy down in round one. End of round    MVP argues with Holyfield's trainer between rounds. Round two starts and Hardy's acting half out of it. Holyfield tells the ref to check him. MVP gets in the ring and tells him to keep beating up Hardy. Holyfield turns his back and MVP grabs him. Holyfield knocks out MVP. The ref rings the bell. Holyfield left immediately. Hardy left. MVP was left on the mat being checked on by his entourage. No announced decision.|`|iAK5jbbpaa	JaMmErS,you right Hardy's rules !!!!!!!|`|Umz0QAGraa	The Chief says, i dont think so Holyfield is pretty old, but will still probobly beat him.

He is celebrating when suddenly he trips over the translater and gets a concussion. The translater moves on to Mark Henry (like davari moved from Henry to Khali) and then he'll get fired. Then everyone is happy and we throw parties.

And maybe aslo for telling them how much extra time.|`|AA11099903	Yes they are wearing headsets.

It is basic communication b/w them.|`|ba1cdb19be896129a482a5f62fbd7ce2aa	They are communication gadgets meant to liaison with all the match officials that handling that particular game.

Se parliamo di calcio italiano vorrei ricordarti che tutti i giocatori pi forti delle nazionali straniere che giocano ai mondiali, praticano il "calcio italiano" dato che (non so se lo sai) fanno parte di squadre tipo il Milan, l'Inter, la Roma,ecc. Quindi dicendo che il calcio italiano  orribile, affermi che tutte le Nazionali (Francia compresa!) giocano male. Infatti la sfortuna di noi italiani  che alleniamo gli stranieri e poi ce li troviamo contro ai Mondiali!  Quindi anche se non parli bene italiano, ragiona bene prima di parlare!

hbk3u47Jaa	In 2005 - my typical $38.00 White Sox tickets went for   Round 1 - $45.00  Round 2 - $78.0  World Series - $175.00    So My guess is that they are probably close to that. I doubt that they would be on sale anytime before mid September for the 1st round. The other rounds will not go on sale until they would win the first round series.|`|AA10153285	Absolutely nothing!|`|0uHsSG7daa	i wouldnt worry about it this year.  also in response to the above, post season ticket prices do change.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Your question is confusing.. are you asking how much is the face value for yankees playoff games? Genrally the face value doesnt change. They are just much harder to get.    Now, if you are asking what do they actually sell for? Probably anywhere from 3 to 5 times the face value.

ik8I8lUhaa	SNME opens with Vince backstage with Coach. Coach says with all the info he was given he will match up the dates and locations of Vince's trysts to the Superstars. Vince says he forgot about one with a black woman in Kansas City in the 70's. Coachman says he's adopted and from Kansas City. Vince stares at him and says it's going to be a long night.     It's announced that MVP has pulled out of his boxing match. It's Matt Hardy vs. Evander Holyfield.     Batista and Kane vs. Finlay and Great Khali. The announcers are JBL, Michael Cole and Jim Ross. Kane's ribs are taped Batista hits the Batista bomb on Finlay for pin.     Cena vs. Carlito later, billed as the Big Apple Showdown.     Backstage, MVP says the doctor won't let him box so he got the next best thing. Evander Holyfield asks him how his ticker is. MVP says he was scared for a minute but he's better than anyone else so he's already bounced back. He pals around with Holyfield.     John Cena vs. Carlito. The crowd chanted "Let's go Mets/Let's go Yankees". Cena wins via submission with the STFU. Randy Orton attacked him immediately and threw him outside, then into the stairs. Crowd chanted "Randy." Orton got a chair from under the ring. He hit an RKO on the floor into the chair on Cena. Cena sold it like he was dead. Crowd chanted for Orton while women chanted "sucks" in response. Match was whatever. Angle was very good. They showed a young boy looking sad over Cena but once he realized the camera was on him, he started mugging for it. Cena took a long time leaving, holding his jaw.     Michael Buffer comes out for the boxing match. Divas are the ring girls.     Backstage, Todd Grisham asks Orton what he was doing. Orton said he sent a loud and clear message to Cena as to what he's going to get at Summerslam. He promises to win the title.     Hardy has 2 cornermen with him. MVP comes out with an entourage. Evander has his own Titantron video. MVP makes Buffer introduce him first, right down to "straight up ballin'" The crowd did the "What" chant during the referee's instructions!     Hardy is wearing a boxing helmet.. Holyield isn't. MVP keeps getting on the apron to give him instructions. Holyfield knocks Hardy down in round one. End of round     MVP argues with Holyfield's trainer between rounds. Round two starts and Hardy acting half out of it. Holyfield tells the ref to check him. MVP gets in the ring and tells him to keep beating up Hardy. Holyfield turns his back and MVP grabs him. Holyfield knocks out MVP. The ref rings the bell. Holyfield left immediately. Hardy left. MVP was left on the mat being checked on by his entourage. No announced decision.     CM Punk & Boogeyman vs. John Morrison & Big Daddy V next. Tazz joined the announcers for the match. Punk got a big reaction. Good when Punk and Morrison were in. Punk surprised Morrison with a small package for another clean win.     Vince McMahon comes to the ring with Jonathan Coachman. Coach gives a long monologue about Vince who cuts him off and tells him to get on with it. Coachman says he's going to help Vince with the child. He says Vince once had a tryst in Kentucky so he is certain this could be his child...and out comes Eugene.     Eugene says that he became a wrestling fan because his Mom told him she met Vince. He says his Uncle Eric told him he nailed his Mom and that's why he tried to put Vince out of business. He tells Vince, "I love you Dad". Vince said he used protection and tells Eugene to get out of the ring.     Coachman then tells of a story of Vince in a Port Authority bathroom so his son could be...Balls Mahoney. Vince says Balls is not his son. Mahoney tells him to think about it and to embrace it. He says Vince has balls. Vince says "I have no balls". The crowd chants "Vince has no balls". He yells at Balls to leave.     Coachman tells Vince of the Wrestlemania 2 afterparty in LA and that this person could be his daughter. Out comes Melina. Vince says that Melina isn't her daughter and cannot be. Coachman asks why not and Vince whispers something. Coach says that's disgusting. Vince tells Melina that the meeting that they had on July 4th was totally harmless. She says that Vince better hope so because if she's his daughter, she will take him for everything she owns. She walks out.     Vince demands to know who his child is. Long dramatic pause. Glass breaks and out comes Steve Austin.     Austin says Vince could be his dad and Vince says there's no chance in hell. Austin says they missed out on so many good things in life...playing catch, water skiing, building a go-cart, the birds and the bees, drinking beer. Crowd is going "what, what, what".     Austin says it would be easy to stun Vince but the big problem is Vince's "overactive grapefruits" so he wants to help him out. He kicks Vince low and low blows him. Austin stuns Coachman and has a beer bash.     After they go off the air, Austin asks the crowd if they want to see him drink a beer with Vince. He says it is his first time in the Garden in years. Vince takes it and Austin hits the stunner. Austin does a long celebration. He gives Jim Ross a beer and takes his cowboy hat.     Vince and Coach get up. Austin says the only way he's not going to kick their *** is if they sing. Vince asks Coach if he can sing harmony. They badly sing "I Left My Heart in San Francisco". Austin knocked their heads together. He helps Coach up then hits another stunner.

You're just a racist pig!!! I've been reading your answers so far and.... many of them are about the U.S.A. Your prejudices are a fair outcome of your sound ignorance. People like you make people of the U.S. even angrier. People like you make many people of the U.S. support anti-immigration bills (among them, the wall in the Mexican-American border). People like you support your DRUNK Mexican friends in the U.S. People like you agree with Mexicans who don't want to do anything at all!!! Those Mexicans who are living on Welfare!!!  Saying that ALL AMERICANS ARE RACIST, it's equivalent to ALL MEXICANS ARE A BUNCH OF DRUNK AND MEDIOCRE PEOPLE. Neither of both are true.   In Spanish: me parece INCREIBLE que, nosotros los Latinos, pensemos que jugando futbol estemos pensando en grandeza. No les parece eso ridiculo????   Translation (in a few words): Hace ud el ridiculo como muchos de sus compatriotas mexicanos. No dan sino lastima. Me refiero exclusivamente a los que siguen esa clase de conducta. No te voy a decir frijolero ni muerto de hambre porque no me parece chistoso burlarme de las dificultades y las desgracias por las que pasa tu pais (como las de muchos paises en nuestra region). Por el otro lado, gente como tu es la que genera en los estadounidenses ese temor y sentimientos de rabia hacia los mexicanos. No combines futbol con politica: no vale la pena. La vida es real, no esta limitada por un partido de futbol. Si los EEUU pierden o le ganan a los mexicanos, eso no va pasar a mayores. Sin embargo, con comentarios como los tuyos, eso si puede pasar a mayores, ya que se estan sumando a los comentarios de muchos mexicanos racistas e ignorantes que pretenden sacar de un partido futbol, un monton de sentimientos corrosivos hacia otros paises.   Y no uses la palabra GRINGO, sabes cual es la conotacion de esa palabra.....como te sientes cuando te dicen FRIJOLERO?? Ahhh bueno.   Saludos.

Por ej. Un gramo de mantequilla tiene muchas ms caloras que un gramo de pan, y un gramo de este, ms que un gramo de lechuga.

Espero haya sabido expresarme suficientemente bien para que lo entiendas. Saludos.|`|BNxRNJp1aa	es cierto lo que dice pelisko pero yo te voy a dar un ejemplo de la masa que se concentra en el hombre... un gramo de grasa equivaldria a 6,5 calorias|`|QaHHD3d8aa	lo q yo se es q es relativo ya que cada gramo de difenretes comidas o diferentes insumos... tienen su equivalente en kcal. si quieres te paso una tabla de insumos y equivalencias... pero no hay una respuesta exacta a tu pregunta.    ahhhh mira lo q encontre si quieres saber en peso es esto...  3500 kilocaloras equivalen a medio kilo de peso, osea hay que hacer ejercicio y quemar 3500 caloras para perder una libra o medio kilo.|`|Fi9emwsOaa	1 calria es equivalente a: 10 donas, 2 docenas de empanadas, 25 kilos de dulce de leche, 2 toneladas de chocolate, ...

Depende de qu alimento sea para saber cuantas caloras tiene. Las frutas y verduras son los alimentos que tienen menos caloras, ademas de muchos nutrientes,  y las cosas grasosas y dulces tienen mas caloras y no tantos nutrientes, asi que se las consideran caloras huecas ya que no aportan casi nada...|`|R5rqNLZuaa	Bueno para comenzar una caloria es una unidad de energia... y hasta donde yo s... la energia no pesa. (imaginense... un gramito de uranio no liberaria tanta energia).  Por tanto las calorias se miden  dependiendo de la canditad de calor que generen... la grasa genera mucho calor (por lo tanto muchas calorias..) y nuestros cuerpos no estan capacitados para generar tanto calor en periodos cortos de tiempo. Por lo tanto, las calorias que no consumimos se acumulan EN GRASA... Por eso que deberiamos hacer muchisimo ejercicio para contrarestar la acumulacion de grasa en nuestros cuerpos... Mientras mas productos grasosos que comamos nos faltara tiempo para que nuestos cuerpos consuman esas calorias..  y lo notaremos en los conocidos rollitos de los que tanto nos quejamos...     Para terminar, les aconsejo que no solo basta comer poco... sino tambien estar siempre en actividad .  Nos vemos
f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	A number of men have used the Doink gimmick in the WWF. The first (and best-known) Doink was Matt Borne. He was succeeded by Dusty Wolfe and Steve Lombardi, who played the character temporarily after Borne left the company until Ray Apollo was brought in as the permanent replacement.    Steve Keirn donned the Doink gimmick as part of a storyline that involved multiple Doinks, the character's first feud, with Crush, which culminated in a WrestleMania IX match where a second Doink (Keirn) crawled from underneath the ring during the match to incapacitate Crush with a cast. The 'real' Doink was at this point still played by Borne.   Jeff Jarrett disguised himself as Doink to play practical jokes on Dink.   Men on a Mission and The Bushwhackers dressed as "The Four Doinks" for the Survivor Series 1993.   After the first run of Doinks, the character was not used for a number of years.    Chris Jericho donned the Doink costume shortly before WrestleMania X-Seven in order to ambush William Regal   Ray Apollo competed as Doink in a "gimmick battle royal" at WrestleMania X-Seven (the timing of the event led several commentators to speculate that the advertised "battle royal" was an April Fool's Day joke, but the event did in fact take place, and was won by The Iron Sheik).   Nick Dinsmore portrayed Doink in a bar room brawl at Vengeance 2003 and again in a singles loss to Chris Benoit on the July 31 episode of SmackDown!.   Steve Lombardi as Doink made yet another return on the October 10, 2005 edition of RAW, in a match against Rob Conway.[1] He once again donned the Doink the Clown gear in 2006, while in the corner of Eugene during a match against Umaga at Vengeance 2006. Doink sprayed Umaga with a water pistol after he won the match, prompting Umaga to attack him.   Dwaine Henderson portrayed Doink at Saturday Night's Main Event 2007 in a 6 man tag match.   The Doink character is easily portrayed by just about anybody on the independent wrestling scene by purchasing the Doink gimmicks (wig and tights) from one of many wrestling gear makers such as the one in RMCW.|`|3a6108e2eaeb4ff26cebb120b848e6c2aa	Steve Lombardi on many occasions.|`|5b09f1eeb355a7dd0ff8b23e44f61062aa	dink the clown.....his little look a like....he looks just like him actually|`|955b96cb364d25485888be9b96e26e98aa	Steve Lombardi(Brooklyn Brawler)|`|pfQ6EZ8haa	Nick Dinsmore also (Eugene)  and me, i'm not a wrestler but i'm cool enough to be, dressing like doink an all that|`|ae11c043333e6efca81bbd77329dfb37aa	Matt Borne was the 1st Doink|`|QHNmTbFnaa	one time chris jerhico did to get back at someone, cant remeber who, but you could tell it was him once he applied the walls of jerhico.|`|BQqI0REEaa	I jst know of one and he is the Brooklyn Brawler

786708c0361ba8d6dc6c673624394659aa	I think they should trade   its miserable right now|`|i0O0DAieaa	Yes they should. The Clippers aren't even using Maggette. Maggette is a great player and is an all-star if given time to play. He led the league in free throw attempts one year showing his aggressive nature and that he attacks the basket. He's also tough and one of the strongest players in the league.|`|wvC9styWaa	I think the Clippers should be traded from L.A.|`|Nd0emY3aaa	I think the Clippers should retain Magette(he makes less than Mobley, who is less productive), trade Chris Kaman(let's face it, after his career year his stats are down across the board, and he doesn't play with gusto anymore), and fire Mike Dunleavy. Corey was an All-star talent who rode bench for no particular reason. The only reason the Clippers nearly made the playoffs was that he was given his starter role back. He gets to the line better than almost anyone, that's good because he puts the opposition in foul trouble. The only knocks against him is he turns the ballover a bit, and he's inconsistent from long range. I believe the roster is in need of a shakeup, it lacks chemistry. I read in ESPN, that Kaman dislikes a certain veteran(Sam) because of the teasing. I think they should play the free market, first get a backup pg for Sam, like Steve Blake(pass-first pg), or go for Telfair(he's available, cheap, and young so he may improve. For their 2 and 3 guards like Eric Williams for his D, and as for PF or Centers, I think a look at Darko wouldn't hurt. He has shotblocking and a good mid-range shot for a big man. Overall, Corey is a good building block for the Clippers, and they imo need more help in regards to coaching.|`|qn3mvR6saa	I'm a huge Clippers fan, and this question boggles my mind a bit. If you asked me this question during the first half of the nba season, I would have said yes to trading Maggette. Yet ever since the all star break Dunleavy started to put him in the starting lineup, and he flourished. He began to go to the line more, his mid range shots went to 55 percent, he drew charges. If he continues this performace, no don't trade Maggette, Clippers and Clippers fans alike need him.

Zgudj70Laa	All the guys I knew in high school who were under 6'2" and could dunk did a lot of leg press in the weight room.  Standing squats can be hard on your knees and back but inverted leg press where you are sitting down and pushing the weight up into the air with your feet is a great exercise for jumping ability.  You can isolate work your calves on that exercise too.  It sounds obvious, but you'll get better at jumping by jumping.  Practice jumping quickly and exploding up with each jump to build your jumping strength.  Put all the work in now so you can be dunking in games next season.  My big regret in high school was that I didn't put the work in on the leg press to get to "dunking status".|`|0JWkg0ptaa	Put weights on your legs to give them restistance for a few weeks every time you practice dunking. Then take them off and see how you do.|`|4d4ebfeed4ab5f6aeea779f4b32627afaa	Jump a LOT.

f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	The words "Edge" and "Christian" are often associated with one another through their use in Christianity. Adam  Copeland stated the following in an interview with Silvervision.co.uk when he was asked about any plans for a tag team name before they had settled with Edge & Christian:    "Well when I first came out they created Edge and Christian around the same time, Sexton Hardcastle went out of the window because it didn't fit. Vince Russo words were the modern day Jim Morrison you can understand why I didn't know I had no clue what that was but I came up with the name Edge and some other names like Rage and Riot, but I didn't really like them so I pitched Edge. So going with that Edge and Suicide Blonds doesn't really go together that well, so Christian wrestled as Christian Cage, so when they brought him in as my brother they just dropped the Cage off, so we became Edge and Christian. I would have liked a tag team name but Edge and Christian started rolling of everyone's tongue."    As for the rated R superstar nickname:  Edge was paired with Lita in an angle where she turned on her storyline husband Kane. On the July 11 edition of RAW, Edge's match with Kane was interrupted when Matt Hardy made a surprising appearance. The situation was a worked shoot, with Hardy referring to Edge as "Adam" and issuing a threat to Lita as well. When Hardy was officially brought back to RAW, he and Edge continued their feud, including a match at SummerSlam 2005 where Edge defeated Hardy in a match by causing Hardy to have "excessive blood loss." They also competed in a Street Fight, which resulted in a no-contest when Hardy performed a Side Effect on Edge off the entrance ramp into the sound speakers and other electrical equipment. They also fought in a Steel cage match at Unforgiven 2005 that Matt won after a leg drop on Edge from the top of the cage. The feud culminated in a "Loser Leaves RAW Ladder Match" at WWE Homecoming which Edge won, causing Hardy to move to SmackDown!.    Shortly after the Homecoming victory over Matt Hardy, Edge suffered a torn pectoral muscle that kept him shelved for several weeks. During his time off, he starred in his own talk show segment on RAW entitled The Cutting Edge and dubbed himself the "Rated-R Superstar".|`|6defc03801c63f04501f702f6e9260c6aa	Because he was litterally rated R...it was cause of how gross he was with Lita..so if him and her were a movie, it'd be Rated R|`|401a2ebd16b3e29ffc24f3f73ee18090aa	he just made it up!|`|RSgd7PBtaa	he wanted it and thought it was cool|`|cE466KzLaa	i dont know where he got the idea, but he called himself "The Rated-R Superstar" after his feud with matt ended, cause he was having a REAL LIFE affair with Lita, while edge was married and lita was dating matt at the same time, heres the entire story i found of wikipedia...    It was around this time that Edge came under heavy criticism, especially from the Internet wrestling community, due to the affair he had with Lita, the girlfriend of his close real life friend, Matt Hardy, who Matt had been dating for six years. Hardy had been out of action for several months with a torn anterior cruciate ligament and shortly after he recovered, Lita suffered the same injury and was put out of action. It was during this time that Edge, despite being married, began an affair with Dumas while she was still in a relationship with Matt Hardy. Shortly after the incident became public knowledge, WWE released Hardy. After Hardy returned, the real-life situation was translated into a storyline [7].    Nevertheless, or perhaps because of this, Edge was paired with Lita in an angle where she turned on her storyline husband Kane. On the July 11 edition of RAW, Edge's match with Kane was interrupted when Matt Hardy made a surprising appearance. The situation was a worked shoot, with Hardy referring to Edge as "Adam" and issuing a threat to Lita as well. When Hardy was officially brought back to RAW, he and Edge continued their feud, including a match at SummerSlam 2005 where Edge defeated Hardy in a match by causing Hardy to have "excessive blood loss."

The feud culminated in a "Loser Leaves RAW Ladder Match" at WWE Homecoming which Edge won, causing Hardy to move to SmackDown!.    Shortly after the Homecoming victory, Edge suffered a (legit) torn pectoral muscle that kept him shelved for several weeks [8]. During his time off, he starred in his own talk show segment on RAW entitled The Cutting Edge and dubbed himself the "Rated-R Superstar". Edge used his talk show to start a feud with Ric Flair following Flair's well-publicized arrest in connection with a road rage incident. Edge began using "The Cutting Edge" as a soapbox to run down Flair until, after weeks of public mockery, Flair eventually showed up and attacked Edge.    i guess, he called himself "The Rated-R Superstar'' because hes oversexed|`|0UhRnipPaa	Usually the Wrestler makes it up or Vince or a writer gets involved.  Egde has been around for a LOOOOOONG time so 2006/2005 when you were old enough to watch, doesn't mean that's when wrestling "began".      Do you know who Hulk Hogan is?  Jimmy Fly Snuka?

28b7ce28cd693720dd246ed22bad5e77aa	It was pretty much like Vince Carter's dunk on Alonzo Mourning, except it came from the other  side of the court, and Baron's angle of entry was closer to the baseline. It looked like he was going to draw the foul and flip it up on the way down, but he had incredible hangtime, reared back, got contact, threw it down, drew the foul, landed on the ground and started popping the jersey. Exclamation point.|`|ec98d07bfe5bfe255a0b28efc34464ccaa	he made kirilenko look like a short man,baron davis dunked on him bad|`|c33e2c78895fbc0b997737cc0a09c0d8aa	QWERTY is right.  The only difference is that it came from the left hand side and Baron Davis is shorter.    No, it was nowhere near as good as V. Carter's Olympic dunk.  I hope people aren't serious.  Vince Carter and Baron Davis are both quality players.  I hope no one is mental enough to say that Davis is a better dunker.      Vince Carter is the only guy I ever saw jump OVER a seven footer to dunk on him.  It happened in the 2000 Olympics and it was by far the ILLEST dunk I have ever seen.  I would give up all the dunks in which I dunked over someone just to have that one to my credit.|`|X9xPAkdgaa	go Baron!!!!|`|022f1c3b90d1d4ff6e3967675d1ff3b1aa	It was good, but not as good as Sacramento's Ronnie Price over Boozer earlier in the year.

Offensive Player of the Year will be Donald Driver. Favre lost Ahman Green and the rest of his targets are too young.    Defensive Player of the Year will be Brian Urlacher because he will be leading another defensive juggernaut.    Rookie of the Year is tough but i'd say between LaRon Landry who could legitimately finish with 3 or 4 picks starting for the Redskins. The other is Adrian Peterson because he will probably take over the lead role from Chester Taylor and give his young qb more breathing room.    Superbowl MVP is the toughest.

AA11674745	Ridiculous. The Eagles would never trade for a player as old as Mr. Favre. However, all things considered, D-Mac would be a great fit in Green Bay. I think the relationship with the Eagles is turning sour at both ends and it would be best for both sides if he moved on. Many folks here in Philly are really against him for the Super Bowl loss to the Pats. I like him, he's a real stand up guy. And Brett Favre is in my Top Five QB's. I got both their jerseys.|`|mcSiBz1taa	It won't happen. The Eagles try to stay away from older players. I will be furious of the Eagles get rid of McNabb as long as he is still physically able to play.

Very close.|`|G8F2zkn2aa	Is there a National Inquirer "Sports Edition"? Because it seems to me that would be the ONLY source stupid enough to suggest such a thing.  The answer to your question is, no, both teams would not want to swap QBs.   Favre is the face of the Packers and trading him would be marketing suicide.   McNabb is the face of the Eagles and 6 years younger than Favre. Even if the Eagles do at some point want to part ways with McNabb, it won't be for an even older, less effective QB.|`|ICUJmWxpaa	WHAT!!!!! thats so stupid.  Y would anyone do dat.  Brett Favre os become a nuisance..  He should juss retire becuz hes not gonna win another superbowl with that team anywayz.. and it doesnt matter wat team he goes to hes still not gonna win a superbowl. Plus McNabb is way better than Favre at this point.|`|efrbvUlaaa	The talk about trading for Farve or Farve demanding a trade are all ludicrous. Farve never demanded a trade and has openly said recently he will not play for anyone but the Packers.  What happened is Farve had one of his press confernces where he spoke with his emotion which he has done in the past (remember the whole Javon Walker incident) .   In response that Farve is a bad influence in the locker room that's just stupid.  Players just gravitate to Farve and he has excellent leadership skills, just look at his past.  If you talk to the coaches they will tell new QB's to pay attention to Farve cause you can learn a lot from him. The coaches will just tell the new QB's don't pay attention to his mechanics.  They are referring his leadership skills, how we goes about his business and how he interacts with his teammates.  Let's face it, Farve was the only reason the Packers had any chance to land Moss to begin with.  This isn't the makings of a player who is a bad influence in the locker room.    Now if a trade were possible it still would be stupid.  Farve is by no means the QB he used to be and he can't carry a team by himself like he used to.  Farve also won't be playing past this year so unless you think you are going to win the Super Bowl you don't want Farve.  Mc nabb can do  just as much as Farve can if he can stay healthy and he has more years left in him.

KzKrXQ1Vaa	moi j'aimerais peler madonna ...|`|c98564e3e276027430df43b1d46a96fcaa	Pour moi, c'est clairement Maradona.  Sa qualit technique et son leadership taient uniques dans le football. Il avait une manire d'craser psychologiquement les adversaires avant mme de toucher le premier ballon, c'tait assez exceptionnel  voir. C'tait le Michael Jordan du foot. Il a gagn une coupe du monde  lui tout seul, alors que Pel tait accompagn de trs grands joueurs qui auraient gagn la coupe du monde mme sans lui (la preuve de cela c'est le mondial 62 gagn par le Brsil alors que Pel n'a jou que le premier match). En plus Maradona a triomph dans le championnat le plus dur du monde  l'poque (Italie) avec un club sans aucune tradition de titres (SSC Napoli). Pel, lui, n'a jamais jou en Europe mais uniquement dans un championnat brsilien becaucoup plus facile, o les dfenses sont trs laxistes et mettent beaucoup moins de coups. En plus il tait chez lui, dans son lment. On ne peut pas comparer ce que Maradona a russi  faire  Naples juqu'en 91 ( une poque o le foot tait plus dur) avec ce que Pel a fait  Santos dans les annes 50-60,  une poque o la rigueur tactique tait faible et les dfenses beaucoup plus facile  percer. C'est quand mme plus dur de devoir affronter des dfenseurs comme Maldini, Baresi ou Rijkaard tout les week ends, que des illustres inconnus comme taient les dfenseurs du championnat brsilien dans les annes 60!    Pour moi, la qualit technique de Maradona reste ingale dans le football moderne.

Para el Mundial pasado, Ecuador se alz incluso sobre Brasil en las eliminatorias, aunque su papel durante la cita asitica pas sin pena ni gloria.  En las pasadas eliminatorias, el podero ecuatoriano le permiti alzarse en el tercer puesto. Ahora, las esperanzas estn cifradas en lo que el elenco del colombiano Luis Surez pueda hacer en Alemania.  Y las expectativas no son bajas. "Quiero ser campen del mundo", dijo un ambicioso Surez. Para lograrlo, el DT se apoya en figuras como Ulises de la Cruz, Nicer Reasco, Edison Mndez, y el veterano Agustn Delgado.  Sern ellos los encargados de dar el paso definitivo de un largo proceso que ya recibi los aplausos en Sudamrica.

eSbpYufaaa	try it get your speed way up you will have to be faster than all the other tight ends on your team. so train train train work at it real hard all summer.|`|4kdlE54Paa	Being 14 with your stats means you might be a force to reckon with when you mature.  Your still growing my friend. You will continue to get big (not in a bad way). Unless you can be every bit as good as the freakish Vernon Davis (big, tall, and with wheels).  There is a huge demand for great defensive players. You can have all the best offensive weapons, but without a great defense to go along with it, its hard to win. You could be the next Shawn Merriman (minus Steroids). Its fun to literally intimidate and screw up the thought process of key offensive weapons. A good defense that can mess with a QB's mind is awesome. QB's dont like getting hit.  They usually get hit the hardest. He's your target. have fun destroying him on the field.    Listen to your coach. He obviously sees your potential.|`|eec8931a40932c706d901901b3e77ad0aa	Do whatever your coach tells you to do. Stop asking sh!t here. Thats why you have a coach.|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	To tell you the truth, 6'1" is really short for a TE. You could try out for it, but you need to prove that you are better than the other guy. Coaches usually know what position that will suit you best. However, Steve Young, HOF QB use to be a DB so anything is possible. But as a TE you are going to need some speed, so you better hope that you can run faster than the other TE on the team.|`|9ff7330bd704621f95f02304ddb292a2aa	play d line|`|D730myDqaa	Concentrate on your LT game.  Thats where you need to be.  Forget tight end, they are a dime a dozen.  You are going to continue to grow and if you do it right a dominant LT is much more appealing to big time colleges than a TE.    Good Luck Man    Stay off the Juice.|`|dRSkTVN5aa	Feel free to discuss this wish to your coach.  In the end, you may need to just accept the position you are assigned to.  Simply being able to play the game of football at a high level and letting it get you into college is a lot more important than which position you get to play.  Good luck to you.  :)|`|Mt7zyal0aa	14 and 6'1 already?  You've got the height to be tight end.  You will have to work on speed and pass catching.  If you have good hands, you should be able to make a good transition to tight end.  Also, does your high school run a lot or have a good mix in passing and running?  On a team that runs a lot, it won't matter too much whether you are a tight end or a tackle, only that you hit the end or the linebacker.  But if your team passes a lot, then you will have much more fun at tight end.  And it does matter whether you have fun or not.  I played with a guy who hated playing O-line, and he did get a scholarship to Texas, but never panned out because he did not like playing it.  He was big enough to play pro, but just hated his position.  However, another guy who played for a rival team liked to play O-line, and went to Texas and then played pro, Blake Brockermire, maybe you remember him, but you can do your research on him online.  It does matter how much you like your position because you will work harder in the offseason if you enjoy the game.  And that is where you get better, by building up your strength (increase your weight to around 260 or so with muscle - tight ends need to be bigger - you are linebacker size right now), conditioning, hand eye dexterity (catching passes), improving speed and quickness.  As far as colleges, if you have the size, whether you played tight end or O-line isn't going to matter much.  They'll still pick you up, but it is easier to switch from tight end to O-line than O-line to tight end.   I also played against a big guy who really sucked as a right tackle in high school, and in scouting him, he couldn't do anything, but because he had size, 6'4" 320, he got a scholarship to Texas A&M.|`|d5rEe1sNaa	Everyone wants a fast left tackle and if I was you I would stay as a left tackle but if you want to follow your dream eat right, work out and go running for 20 minutes a day.|`|d6bbbbdf5254e9de70afaee5b0f32edcaa	Hi Xtreme,    How fast are you? That's going to be a big factor. Plus, you're still growing; who knows how big you will get. How are your hands for catching?     Honestly, Tight End is more glamorous, but a great O-Tackle is money in the bank, and may well be your ticket to college. And if you're good enough when you get to college, THEN show your coach how fast you are and how well you can catch. They may be more apt to change your position.    And don't forget to STUDY!! :) A student-athlete is pure gold in a college recruiter's eye.|`|JAqMxJVBaa	sorry dude. but tight end isnt really a choice with ur weight, no offense. but if ur coach says ur good at d- line and u like it, keep at it.|`|Dhbovlw2aa	Try out Tight End, if you get your speed up, youre tall enough for it and could be very dangerous in the red zone, ask your coach about letting you try out the Tight End spot. Good Luck!

AA12170560	You're a big guy.  It's a safe bet you'll be put on the line to develope.    You won't have to worry about sprinting 100 yards.  In fact, a 40 yard sprint will be the longest.  As a lineman; exploding off the line for 5 - 10 yards is the goal.    I think you'll be just fine. Do your best while running and conditioning, pace yourself, and drink lots of water throughout the day.    The physical condition goal is NOT designed to hurt you.  It's designed to get you in shape.    "Hell Week" scares everyone...it's supposed to weed out those kids that aren't commited to playing football. They quit before it ever comes about.  Hell week is about 3-a-day practices...sometime 4.  You'll do a lot of exercising and you'll get a lot of information.    Showing up on the first day is half the battle...sticking out out until the end of the week is the other half. You can do it.  After Hell Week, the rest is easy.    Good luck and have a great time.|`|78c2d49d83703707692272125e4506f7aa	1st off, if you can grow about another 5 inches or so, and hit the weights hard, you can build up to a great size for a lineman.      the key thing is that you have to stick with it.      if you want to be truly great in football then go to all the summer weight training sessions, study your playbook, find a mentor from the varsity.  put your whole heart and soul into it, and you can accomplish great things in all aspects of life.      realize that conditioning and hell week will be tough, but it gets better.  also, i'd tell you to go out for the wrestling team.  it will help you stay in great shape and help with the physicality that's involved in both football and wrestling.  Also, try to do shot and disc for track.  again, lots of strength training and year round exercise.      best of luck to you.|`|HsC7unRmaa	Pick a position where you don't have to run.  I recommend offensive or defensive line.  Rarely will a lineman have to run 4 yards, much less 40 yards.  Work on your footwork, football intelligence, and strength--especially your strength--and the coaches won't sweat your slow 40 (at least they won't sweat it this year).      Conditioning or hell week all depends on your coach and your location.  Hell week in TX or FL is gonna be a lot worse than in MA or CT.  Either way, start preparing now--like yesterday--start lifting, running, swimming, biking, etc. these will get you physically and mentally ready.  Do it at least 4 days a week every week until camp starts.  Don't forget to eat well and drink lots of water.|`|66f0b01943d663c2c351e74cf834f405aa	Your a big dude for a freshmen.   But don't worry it's freshmen football. You won't be with alot of the big boys till next year.    Also, since your just starting you'll find out how much you have in you. Hell Week will either make you or break you.|`|Dhbovlw2aa	you will do fine in football, and the conditioning is nothing to worry about, its bad for like 2 days and then you get used to it and it seems like nothing|`|PJco9xpOaa	I don't play football, obviously. But my ex was the quaterback of his team and the top in the state...so... You will really have to work at it dude. I can run way faster then you, and I hate running. But besides that fact you just really need to work on your running, and practice, pratice, practice. Not much else you can do.|`|T4reEItiaa	Your a big boy so dont be scared. Your going to be playing line. I think your speed is fine and there isnt a problem with that. The first week of practice is hell. You will feel like you cant breath, but after you just get used to it all. Your going to be really tired but you'll catch a hold after 1 week. Enjoy the practice. There soo much fun.|`|ed5ab56655d3bbdc69fef2077fe983b5aa	you'll probally be on defense unless you can catch. your short distance sprint is ok, id condition over the summer. the first week is tough as hell. the first day of practice you can't breathe and then someone does something stupid and you have to run the whole time. just done give up and put your head in it and you'll be good

M65Lu1GFaa	One on One  Set up cones and do tricks around them  CAMP|`|ec98d07bfe5bfe255a0b28efc34464ccaa	dribble around cones with different moves like behind the back,between the legs and also dribble 2 balls at the same time up and down the court|`|ddJ3dHitaa	Yeah, you could try dribbling two basketballs at the same time without looking down for a certain amount of time, you could do "figure 8 drills" by moving the ball through your legs as quick as possible without looking down.  you could dribble the ball around one leg with one hand and alternate.  for quickness in ball handling, you could hold the ball between your legs then drop it and switch your hands as fast as you can trying not to let it fall.  Even just running up and down a court or driveway with good form without looking down at the ball helps. because eventually, you'll have to learn how to not look at the ball because you'll have to be looking at the defense.  It won't just make you better all of the sudden, but if you work at it consistently for a week or so, then I'm sure you'll see a significant change in your skills.  Also, might I suggest buying a pair of dribbling goggles that don't let you look at the ball unless you totally turn your head down.  Good Luck.      Don't give up on Basketball.  It's the best sport!|`|Kjj6PDFbaa	Try bouncing two bballs at the same time.|`|UqsBw0Kvaa	You need strength in your fingers and forearm to be able to handle the ball well. You can work on it by dribbling with one finger and rotating to the next. Forearm can be strengthen by squeezing anything, including the air repeatedly. To improve your dribble you need to realize that any dribbling FEEL can go away somewhat if you do not dribble for a period of time. You have to maintain your dribble everyday like you would shooting. The best way to improve your dribble is simply to use it; do crossover dribbles against a defender, backspin around a number of people, push the ball up and down the court, behind the back dribble, etc. I find it more effective if you practice the dribbles that you will actually be using instead of doing something like Figure 8.

Si los tres lados son de distinta longitud, es un tringulo escaleno; si dos lados son iguales es un tringulo issceles, si los tres lados son iguales es un tringulo equiltero y, finalmente, si uno de sus ngulos es de 90, entonces, recibe la denominacin de tringulo rectngulo, si sus todos sus ngulos es menor de 90o, se denomina tringulo agudo ; por el contrario, si unos de sus ngulos es mayor de 90, entonces es un tringulo obtuso.   Si se multiplica un nmero por tres se obtiene el triple de ese nmero; mientras que si se divide por tres se obtiene un tercio. El cubo de un nmero (dicho nmero multiplicado 3 veces por s mismo) se representa con el 3 como exponente, como en n3.   En muchas culturas el 3 se representa mediante tres puntos, como en el caso de la numeracin maya, o mediante tres trazos (horizontales o verticales). Por ejemplo, en la numeracin romana (III) y en la numeracin china ().   Tres son los ideales de la Revolucin Francesa, Libertad, Igualdad y Fraternidad   Existen famosas trilogas literarias, entre ellas las de Paul Auster y William Burroughs, El se?or de los anillos fue publicada como triloga aunque no era esa la intencin de su autor.   Son trilogas famosas en el cine Indiana Jones, Regreso al Futuro, El Padrino y Duro de matar.   La Regla de Tres es un principio fundamental de la Wicca.   En Vietnam se cree que dan mala suerte las fotografas de tres personas.   La banda de rock Blind Melon titul una de sus canciones Three is a magic Number   Segn la doctrina cristiana Jess fue crucificado entre dos ladrones y resucit al tercer da.   Los Nazis llamaron Tercer Reich a Alemania. Los dos primeros haban sido el Imperio Romano y el Imperio de Prusia.   Los zares llamaron a Mosc la tercera Roma despus de Constantinopla.

q4hnPT7Caa	Es la misma pelicula de otros paises, incluyendo Inglaterra, Italia y Espa?a lo que sucede es que al ellos tener ms capital de inversin en estos peque?os equipos a veces sorprenden al Madrid o Chelsea pero igual son una basura, en el caso Venezolano te aseguro que ser bastante divertido ver a estos equipos nuevos peleando para no descender a segunda divisin, ya que a mi parecer sera la peor humillacin de todas  jajajaja   La calidad de juego no bajar la diferencia estar en ver jugar la primera divisin y a la segunda juntas por primera vez....  En tanto los equipos tendrn mas exigencias fisicas, lo cual es bueno para nuestros jugadores, bien sea para que desarrollen ms sus condiciones para los partidos con la Vinotinto o con algn club del exterior que se fije en ellos.    Y Ojo no sorprenden al Caracas, ya que lo desmantelaron al llevarse a jugar 10 de sus mejores jugadores al exterior y ahora su plantilla est compuesta por 50% de jugadores de segunda divisin....

Pero para mi pesa mas los pros, porque as se incentiva el futbol para que sea mas competitivo.  Saludos|`|SVeVdunYaa	Venezuela no es una gran potencia del ftbol, necesita desarrollarse. si quieres lee una novela llamada "un sue?o color  vinotinto" (por Norman ettedgui) me mandaron a leer esta peque?a novela en primer a?o de bachillerato y me pareci interesante. Vivo en Venezuela.|`|u8XXMtAzaa	Me parece que era "el deber ser" desde hace algunos a?os. Una liga de solo diez equipo no es capaz de inundar de ftbol a un pas como Venezuela. Claro que se corre el riesgo de caer en la mediocridad de los partidos pero ojala que no sea as. Yo creo que los equipos estn motivados a mejorar sus plantillas y por eso se han visto equipos de muy poca trayectoria como el Deportivo Anzoategui apostando a estar entre los mejores del torneo, apoyado en un buen tcnico y buenos jugadores, eso es motivacion y es importante, sobre todo para el oriente del pas que es poco aficionado al ftbol. Adems, ya ves que estn reapareciendo equipos que en otros tiempo fueron grandes y luego se sumergieron en el olvido, como el caso del Minerven que de seguro va dar la pelea para alcanzar la primera division el prximo a?o. Esperemos que ruede el baln y que los intereses politiqueros que tanto da?o le han hecho a Venezuela no prevalezcan sobre los intereses deportivos y futbolisticos.

nwi5ZHk0aa	No. I don't think it was right to cheat on Matt with a married man while they were in a relationship but hey, it was her decision. And it's not like she resorted to prostitution or anything. She was in a steady relationship for six years. Not much people can say that. People cheat on their significant others all the time. However, that doesn't make it right. So like I said, I don't agree with what she did but I don't think she should be judged or called any names because of it.

AnEccEHBaa	ofcourse he cannot win everything i mean this isn't Fifa 07 or 08 where someone (me) can win every cup for all the seasons straight     i expect Chelsea will play very well they have good players and i also hope they allow the coach to construct his type of team since that team is really Jose's players still    anyways i think he can definately motivate the team and that's all Chelsea needs motivation and they should be just fine|`|RNr2xeDHaa	yeah sure! lol!    didnt Jose Mourinho AND Avram Grant say that as well?? We shall see....!|`|VIo0Xv0Haa	Of course it will be stronger, last year Chelsea managed to finish second in 3 competitions, and very close to win it, with Avram Grant as coach, with a lot of players injured, Mourinho been sacked in middle of the season...  This season with Scolari starting to coach from the beginning of the season, and letting him buy the players for his system, Chelsea are going to win at least 1 important trophy (EPL or UCL)|`|eVbKHtY5aa	who's chelsea?|`|Cc9Sd6RPaa	http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    oh and for the question NO|`|Exbqy1N2aa	No, Scolari is not proven at the top level for club football. Sure he's won a World Cup, which is very impressive but let's remember that was with a hugely talented Brazil side and international football is different.     Chelsea always say that they're going to win everything (in the past few years)   Mourinho said it, hell even Avram Grant did. Scolari can talk but he has a lot to prove|`|DYCenwIfaa	He's a great manager and I hope he'll kick some discipline and sense into our team, I can't wait for the new season, gonna be wicked....|`|09T6RXVYaa	Stronger? No.  More efficient and production? Absolutely.  They'll be in the hunt for all competitions, but it's all a matter of whether Scolari can manage all of those big names and get them to gel together.  If not, maybe the FA Cup or the Carling Cup.  If so, maybe a cup and the EPL Championship, but no way for all four (carling, FA, EPL and Champs League). There's just way too much competition, and one game can ruin it for any team.    There's a lot of egos at the Bridge, and none bigger than Ambromovich himself, so its all a matter of will they all know their roles and get on with playing.  They have the talent, but I don't think Scolari can instill the heart that the team needs to win.|`|qO7nbSQVaa	Stronger but not strong enough.|`|SXHOvODRaa	He will probably wins the Coca Cola Cup and the FA Cup but as far as the League and Champions League are concerned, Scolari can keep on dreaming! Only big clubs like Manchester United and Liverpool can challenge for these cups respectively. . .|`|lAVOZoPkaa	Yes man , Scolari is gr8.|`|aA8SqHkcaa	a|`|ceTWfaRAaa	Yes.|`|i0oJqPffaa	No way JOSE!|`|f7tG4XCQaa	what are you talking bout extend your question|`|yZ2PjmJoaa	yeh  i think he might|`|gnNbA5zKaa	yes|`|9Y46liQWaa	A clean sweep???????

c06fd19652b9590ea219e8f4fb56d58caa	Para que uno de ellos quede como Pichichi la veo complicada porque hay muy buenos goleadores en los dems equipos.   No creo que le sea fcil a Capello elegir.   Creo que el que le puede resultar ms efectivo para lo que pretende Capello en su juego es Van Nistelrooy, tiene ms potencia y juego areo, y esto ltimo Ronaldo no lo tiene. Adems hace tiempo que el gordo est entre algodones.   Ya es tiempo que le den la oportunidad a otros, porque sino van a seguir viendo a los otros ser campeones.|`|19e9646c65fa40f7487af5f557942825aa	Van Nistelrooy ?? el gordo q se pire|`|2c665e0af2d0f133176c70d42ddbe4bbaa	Mucho Van Nistelroy pero como Ronnie este en forma ya veremos.

Dicho esto, deberia ser Van the Grandfather porque tiene 34 a?os (el a?o pasado en la web del United decian 33 asi que no creo que porque lo diga Marca ahora haya rejuvenecido 4 a?os), Ahora seguro sera titular Van Nistelrooy porque Capello lo puede decir mas alto pero no mas claro El Gordo, Guti,Beckahm y Pavon a la calle. Y se iran gratis, Jugar jugar no jugara ni el gordo (lleva 3 a?os sin hacerlo) ni el anciano (lleva 2 a?os de reserva). Pero salir al campo saldra Van Nistelrooy.

WAGAcLPMaa	How did he throw a fit? He basically just didn't wanted to serve a two month suspension, and wanted to retire for a long time now anyway. Not only that, but a lot of him quitting was based on the fact that the WWE didn't want Booker's own promotion as its development company. And heck, he doesn't want to be know as the first guy to fail the drug policy, and seeing that he has the money and the ability to retire, he did.    This is actually a fairly dignified way to retire, IMO.|`|nqmGblKlaa	very true|`|f20f99a86df1fe47566080e7fc542816aa	He quit not because of the suspension, but because Vince added Marijuana to the list of drugs to be tested on.|`|0ws6rQP6aa	Amen to that.

Es muy dificil saberlo, creo que hay dos opciones, Ferrari o Renault.  Renault puede llevarselo, por que el sueldo de Alonso no lo pagaran ellos, lo pagaran los patrocinadores, como esta ocurriendo en este momento con McLaren, solo es cuestion de que Alonso encuentre nuevos patrocinadores poderosos.  Ferrari, tiene los patrocinadores y el dinero para contratarlo, pero el problema es McLaren, Alonso an tiene contrato con ellos, y yo no veo viable que lo deje en libertad para irse con el archi-rival, si McLaren lo deja ir, ser con la condicin de que no vaya a Ferrari, as de simple.

Sin embargo Hamilton tambin est motivado y ahora mas.  Creo que el que menos tiene que perder y mucho que ganar es Raikonnen, quien seguramente estar peleando la punta con Massa.

Adems es un gran piloto que se concentra en las carreras, no como Hamilton y Alonso que se la pasan peleando.

a29FFlo6aa	Ok, ASGI is a great airsoft site for you to look-  http://www.airsoftgi.com/    Alright, if you have springer games, then a sniper would be good, but you should know that a spring-sniper does not have any range advantage against a AEG, and will be out-gunned by a AEG.     But like I said, if you have springer wars, then yes, you could have a spring sniper.     My advice-   Don't buy a spring sniper, and put the extra money into a decent AEG.     One thing you have to understand, there is no such thing as the "best airsoft gun". The clostest thing is this-  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...    I would never buy a gun that expensive, but that is probably the best.     Ok, there are really good guns out there, the thing is you have to put into consideration is its price. For $210, the TSD tactical M16 is probably the best gun for its price. For $120, the JG G36 is probably the best gun for its price.     For $250, you can a more than decent AEG. I like TSD SRC guns, I have their M16 and I love it. And you can get a more-than decent gun for the price you are paying.      http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...    G36- $210  foregrip- $20  spare magaine if needed- $20    There you go. Thats a lot for the price. Here are some other options-   http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...    http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...    And there are plenty of others. Good luck. Email me if you have any questions.       happy airsofting.    Ps if you really want a sniper for springer wars, this is a good choice-   http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...|`|7QhG9pYUaa	The M-16 Airsoflt is a good assault rifle even the Pulse R71 i don't know about the Sniper Try the M82 Airsoft Sniper|`|HVGGUAShaa	i have to say daisy look for it a daisy those are the best guns you will find with the best durabilty... and well there a good price|`|EmhumxIRaa	man i got a collection  but an sniper or assualt rifle are very good i use some guns for robers but i dont shoot them well if they have a gun ill shoot it the foot|`|b10e0a3b576ad1f0e72969b7e8d766e0aa	The M-16 Airsoflt

Les JO en foot sont reservs aux jeunes.    Nous ne sommes pas qualifis.  Il faut quand mme relativiser. Il ne s'agit pas des bleus que l'on connais.   Les jeux olympiques ne sont pas une comptition intressante au football. Ils sont reservs aux jeunes :    "Les professionnels sont admis dans le tournoi masculin, mais les quipes doivent tre composes de joueurs ags de moins de 23 ans,  l'exception de trois d'entre eux. Aucune limite d'age ne s'applique pour le tournoi fminin."    L'quipe de France olympique ne concerne donc que les jeunes ... et encore si leurs clubs les laissent aller aux JO puisque le championnat recommence.    Traditionnellement ce sont des amateurs ou des espoirs...  Moi mme fan de football je ne regarde pas le foot aux JO...    ---  @Spirit : Tu connais l'entraineur ? c'est pas Domenech !!!   Les JO sont pour les ESPOIRS    ---  Les qualifis sont les jeunes qui ont t demi-finalistes de l'euro ESPOIR 2007 (et pas de l'euro 2008 !!!)    http://www.sportvox.fr/article.php3?id_a...

aTkPvZQuaa	grossly overpaid..........................|`|nJ5kceMBaa	I just accept it for what it is. Footballers are payed large amounts of money to entertain, just like in the acting, singing & television industries. That's the way the world is.|`|Maja0Gzdaa	they should get paid about 10,000 a week in my opinion|`|be07e2fee48477531cecc4228cb1dfa9aa	Footballers are indeed grossly overpaid.    This ten-year-career stuff is bollocks.    As if it somehow disenables them from being able to do anything else for the rest of their lives!    It's like me taking a job with a twelve-month contract, and demanding 10,000 an hour, since it's only a one-year career.|`|atkBDVO0aa	Footballers wages should be capped. End of story. 10,000 a week is enough for any sportsman. Gerrard is on 120,000 a week, A WEEK. A nurse gets 24,000 a year. A teacher gets about the same.    Still seem ok to you? Gerrard still that important?    I support Liverpool also and i see no sense in those figures .      edit - the point made below about there being only one gerrard in the world and lots of people can be doctors, yes i accept that and still 10,000 a week is enough.|`|swnQwp5Jaa	True. Football stars are much more important than ceo,s or celebrities because they posses "true talent". Their in great shape, train very hard, and make this game we call football immensely entertaining. We are willing to empty our pockets for football tickets and so footballers deserve every penny they get.(Except beckham of course).    Okay nurses and docters dont get paid nearly as much as football players. TRUE    Who can become a docter, or a nurse? Anyone who is moderately smart, that make at least hundreds of thousands of people on this earth    Who can play and entertain at the level Gerrard and Torres can? 20, 30 people on this earth?    A world class football player is more inportant than a single docter, lawyer, whatever you can think of.|`|729c795f8c72a4afc32bcdb5d9eca7a6aa	Ok|`|1aXN37E5aa	Why only English fans?

c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	Put you foot somewhere in the middle of the board with a little bit of toe hanging off. Your back foot should be square on the tail. Pop the board down not too hard, and give it a little push back. Your front foot does NOTHING. After the pop, hop forward a little bit. Make sure you do the spinning push with your toe and don't kick back the board with all your leg power.|`|gkmtLBokaa	when i was learning the pop shuvit it was extremely hard i couldn't understand how people could do it then my friend lee told me tojump forward a little while i push with my back foot and after a couple of tries i could do it   1. position your front foot in the middle of the board  2. take your back foot and put it on the front edge of the tail   3. jump forward a little and push with your back foot     hope this helps you with your pop shuv-it|`|hUfWup5kaa	Your best bet is to keep your front foot somewhat centered on the board towards the front truck.    And then your back foot be hanging off with the toes on only.    REMEMBER ONLY LET YOUR BACK FOOT DO THE WORK IN THE AIR!

c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	DC's last the longest and are very comfortable, light, and strong. You don't have a good feel of the board however so you don't have such good board control. Fallen's are the best and pretty cheap. Stylish, are really durable and give you really good board control but may be a bit tight.|`|AA11738942	you can find a good pare of suede DC shoes for about 40 - 120 bucks  nike 6.0 is good and cheap   go to s.v.p. sports (si vous play) and they have skate shoes  or go to playless shoe source and u can find airwalks which don't last long at all before they rip, but are good|`|mfI3ftjvaa	Dc's...

c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	Stevie Williams with DGK. His Pop-Shuvit late front 180 catches are amazing. Not my favorite, probably Chris Cole and his non-stop 360 double flips.

c8a1e3ddaeef6227b38d9b9dada41334aa	Good luck with that. You basically have to be at a skatepark or in a tournament at the right time when a Zero rep is there. If he likes you, he'll go up to you and offer you a deal. But really, when will that happen?|`|TMnJJgS8aa	I think Jamie thomas will let you in if you are really good, like a pro skater for an example.|`|kJH3KTP7aa	It doesn't really work that way. Maybe you can get lucky, and get coverage in a local skateshop, but i doubt that that will get you sponsored. All you need to do, is make a few youtube videos, and win some contests. Sometimes, people will go to skateparks, and see if they find anyone they like, but it rarely happens.

ThKao2mTaa	1st pick - Larry Bird - Won the USBWA College Player of the Year, Naismith and Wooden Awards, given to the year's top male college basketball player. After his three seasons at Indiana State, he left as the fifth-highest scorer in NCAA history. Bird finished his collegiate career with an average of 30.3 points per game. He is also on the Missouri Valley Conference All-Century Team.    2nd pick - Magic Johnson - Led Michigan State University and beat Indiana State University in 1978-79 season, which was led by then senior Larry Bird.In what is still the highest-rated college basketball game ever. He was voted Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four on that season.    3rd pick - Michael Jordan - Had a stand-out career at the University of North Carolina winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984.    4th pick - LeBron James - Arguably the best High school Basketball player drafted in the NBA.    5th pick - Kobe Bryant - one of the Better High school players drafted in the NBA.    G0t it? Go0d!!!!|`|Ma0bxhdeaa	ask ne NBA gm & they'll tell u coming out of high skool/college that LeBron is the best talent of all of these guys.. he's NOT better than all of them, but as far as only knowing wut these players did in high skool/college.. this is the list    1. LeBron James  2. Michael Jordan  3. Magic Johnson  4. Kobe Bryant  5. Larry Bird|`|83ebpB19aa	1)Michael Jordan - This guy could do everything and had SO much passion for the game. Maybe the fiercest competitor ever.    2)Larry Bird - Bird is probably the best shooter in history, and is no doubt the best shooting big man. He could also pass very well, and was a great defender.    3)LeBron James - LeBron was already a beast when he entered the draft. He's also a lot like Michael, he can do everything, he's just not nearly as fierce as a competitor as MJ was.     4)Magic Johnson - Magic had a lot of size: he was the biggest PG in NBA history, and also one of the greatest. Great shooter, great passer, and decent defender.    5)Kobe Bryant - Look, if we were talking about Kobe now he would be higher on this list, but for about three years Kobe was nothing special. When Shaq arrived though, that's where his greatness began. But since we're talking about drafting them as a rookie, Kobe was nowhere near the other players on this list.|`|tPVkEVNiaa	Based on i dont know what they will do in advance  Larry  Magick  Kobe   Jordon  Lebron    Based on if iknow wha they will do  Jordon  Lebron  Larry  Kobe  Magick|`|rFrRxj8xaa	1st:Michael Jordan  2nd:Larry Bird  3rd:Magic Johnson  4th:Lebron James  5th:Kobe Bryant|`|Ph3mcuPeaa	jordan     kobe     larry     magic    lebron|`|yWzSiwFtaa	magic becuz he is the greatest PG ever  MJ cuz he is the greatest SG ever  Kobe cuz he is a great scorer and defender  Larry cuz he is one of the shapest shooters ever  Lebron becuz he can get to the rim at ease anytime he wants|`|oMSTg5rQaa	There's 2 answers to this question.      If you know what you know now, of course you'd pick;    1. Michael Jordan - 6 NBA title, 5 MVP's, 10 scoring titles Defensive Player of the Year. Many consider him the great player ever.    2. Magic Johnson - 3 MVP's, 5 NBA titles, and probably the most versitle player of the modern era.    3. Larry Bird - Considered the greatest small forward ever. 3 NBA titles, 3 MVP's.    4. Kobe Bryant - Huge contributer to 3 straight NBA titles, 2008 MVP, and one of the games best scorers.    5. Lebron James - The most versitle and physically gifted player of our time. He has a chance at multiple MVP's and NBA titles.      But if you based it on their college/highschool careers it would be a bit different.    1. Magic Johnson - No one had ever seen a player like Magic at 6'8" doing the things he was doing; he had also just led his team to an NCAA title.    2. Larry Bird - Like Magic Bird was the one of the most versitle 6'9" players anyone had ever seen. He was National Player of the Year and led his tam to the title game.    3. Michael Jordan - Player of the Year, 1 NCAA title, thought of as just another really good SG.    4. Lebron James - Lebron James never played college ball but he had a great skill set with unreal athleticism. Plus he had an NBA body at 6'8" 240 at the time.    5. Kobe Bryant - High school players were still a bit of mystery and while Kobe was good, he only went 13 in the draft that year.

b4217db1a0738944f882265d99ccf831aa	A good routine  for strength is to alternate sit-ups and push-ups.    Day 1-5: Start with 5 sit-ups, then do 5 push-ups.  Alternate as many times as you can for 10 minutes.  Day 6 an on:  add one more sit-up and push-up to the first set per day.  Gradually go down to 3 of each from your starting number.  (i.e. on day 15, you start with 15 sit-ups and then do 15 push-ups, then do 14 sit-ups and 14 push-ups, then do 13 sit-ups and 13 push-ups and so on.  On day 16 you would start with 16 of each and go down again.)    It's a hard exercise that will help build muscle quickly.  The benefit of alternation is that you will give that muscle group a chance to rest, which is important.  Since the first few days are just timed, is a really easy thing to start off with as well.|`|a0d221d67afd0afe6a87c54c3f1d59f1aa	steroids

AA11228318	The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) was created in 1997 out of the ashes of the Bowl Coalition (1992) & Bowl Alliance (1995) arrangements that were puit in place to avoid a playoff system for college football and to help the existing bowl system remain relatively intact. It has only worked sporadically and has only provide a true  1 vs.  2 matchup once to my recollection. For that reason alone itneeds to be scrapped in favor of a true playoff system. that could still use he existing bowls. The problem is that would mean a lot of lower-echelon & borederline teams that currently go to bowls would be eliminiated & because of that the schools will never go for it (too much money at stake).|`|AA12037424	It stands for Bowl Championship Series and it allows the five major bowls the opportunity to host the national Championship game once every five years.

How athletic are you?  You should figure on at least 3 months of practicing two hours a day and two hours of physical conditioning (strength, flexibility, and endurance) each day to get ready for a team.  Most students that want to make a team start over summer vacation.    If you truly have no skills, why do you want to be on the team?      If your skills just need polishing up, get a private coach to set up a supervised training program and tell him your goal and ask him to help you.  There will be a significant cost associated with this route (probably $50 per hour) so you must be dedicated for this to work.

But he will never have a career as a DE at those numbers.  Most DE's are 6'2" and above and weigh 245 lbs +.    His 40 time is also very slow considering his size. I am 6'2" 250lbs and run a 4.7 40 yard dash.    Tell him he should look to play wide receiver on offense or if he is set on playing defense he needs to hit the weights and run, run, run to get faster and he would probably do better as a DB.

El Mal Karma puede ser arrastrasdo, es decir que si en 2 vidas anteriores fuiste un asecino en serie y lo hiciste por dirversion arrastras ese mal Karma hasta que lo limpies (tambien tiene un limite y es que vas directo al infierno xD), aunque tambien las almas buenas deben purificarse...

En el centro del campo,Diarra es el pivote defensivo.Guti tiene como principal misin crear,tendra un papel similar al de Xavi en el Bar?a (canalizar el juego) aunque no tendra un escudero de lujo como Deco.No creo que Beckham aporte mucho en esa posicin,por lo que reubicara ah a Ral (siempre que mejore prestaciones) para que estuviera en contacto con el baln.  Arriba,Robinho pondra el desborde,Cassano (si recupera su forma) su talento y picarda y Van The Man sera el encargado de rematar todo lo que le sirvan.

No puedo soportar tama?a arrogancia y antipata en un chico tan joven. Cuando gan el primer campeonato no me desagradaba, pero ahora... Es un expositor de marcas andante, odioso con la prensa (que s, que son pesados, pero hay quien sabe guardar su privacidad sin necesidad de responder mal a nadie ni irse a vivir a la quinta leche) y con una ambicin desmedida, aunque en este aspecto siempre le superar Schumacher, que juega ms sucio que ninguno.

Pero Alonso me cae bien, es un chico con mucho futuro y con las ideas muy claras, sabe muy bien lo que hace y porqu lo hace; y cuando dice algo, aunque muchos digan que es un llorn, casi siempre tiene razn, y lo que es mejor an, no se calla la boca ante nadie, si tiene algo para decir lo dice guste o no guste, por eso a mucha gente le cae mal. Vean sino a Fisichella, jams habla, no dice nada, y ?quin es? Claramente es el segundo de Alonso, con mucha mayor trayectoria, pero como piloto no va, ni siquiera ayuda a Alonso, como haca Massa con Schumacher. Entonces hay que entender que Alonsito se enoje a veces, slo hay que analizar porqu. Espero que mi respuesta te sirva para algo.  Saludos.

Tambien espero que la prxima temporada Kimmi pueda ser campen.. Se lo merece pues es un excelente piloto. Quizs con Ferrari le vaya mejor.    SCHUMACHER Y RAIKONNEN SON LOS MEJORES!!

fcb4cfcafe0e060ea9d6854b6e75697aaa	Nice list. Until the Big East can prove it's a football conference and Rutgers can prove it's a football school, it's not going to happen.
