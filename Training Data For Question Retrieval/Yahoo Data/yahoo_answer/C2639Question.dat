It pushes 1300w RMSx1 at 2 ohms. The second one is the Hifonics BXi1608D amplifier and it pushes 1100w RMSx1 at 2 ohms. Why does the first amplifier cost a whole $60 more than the second one? I'm just wondering if it's the quality because they are the same brand, and same model. I'm wondering if I should spend another $60 for just 200w extra. What do you think?

20090131144811AAlvYJj	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Any recommendations for a good moving company?	I'm planning a move out of Los Angeles once I find a job.  Looking into moving companies and truck rentals, I notice that most companies will not allow you to rent a small van or pick-up for a state-to-state move (pick up the vehicle in one city, drop it off in another).  Another option would be self-pack container boxes that a moving company would load onto a truck and move to my new city.    I have little furniture, but many large boxes.    Any recommendations for companies that have reasonable rates?  Or if you know any companies to avoid, that would be helpful, too!  Thanks!

However, if I make only a short trip (i.e., 5 or so minutes in length) and then turn off the truck, I am not able to not start it again for a couple of hours. The engine turns over just fine (i.e., the lights come on, the truck starts to idle, etc.) but unless I keep my foot constantly on the gas, it just keeps stalling and I can't get it going for two or more hours. Does anyone have any idea what is causing this? (Note: it runs fine in warmer weather - i.e., above 5 Celsius - and I can "stop and go" as many times as I'd like; it's just that once it hits below that temperature, I cannot turn off my truck unless I know that I won't be needing to use it again for a couple of hours)

Just to mention a few things that have been done, all new anti roll bar links and bushins, changed a hub cause thought it was a bearin, got wheels balanced and when that made no difference swapped wheels with wheels on back in case it was the tyres. Boot rubbers and drives also seem ok. ???   It doesnt seem to be affecting the way it drives.

Just trying to gather as many ideas to try later, thanks.

Hey, id like to know from Opel Corsa or any Opel diesel drivers if this is the truth or not. I recently bought a 2009 Opel Corsa 1.3 CDTI an payed a lotta money for it. A few days ago I asked a friend of mine that tunes cars what I can do to my car when its warranty expires, inother words to give it some more power. After opening the hood and looking around a bit he told me you could put on a turbo, I was like dumbstruck as he said that it didnt have a turbo, this was then supposed to be a turbo, it does say CDTI (Common Rail Diesel TURBO INTERCOOLED) and I asked him why he said this. Then he told me that it was a COMPENSATOR and not a turbo and that it only boosted something like 0.3 bar which I couldnt believe. It apparently just lets a bit to more air into the combustion chamber. My car develops 66 KW and 200 NM from the 1.3 diesel engine, so he told me it would develope up to 80 KW or more if you put in a conventional turbo and boosted it to 1.6 bar or higher. OK, I dont really know a lot about engines (more about the car itself) so I couldnt argue. So diesel Opel drivers out there. Does this car have a COMPENSATOR or a TURBO and can you make it develop more KW and whats a COMPENSATOR and its job ? Whats the difference between a compensator and a turbo ? Please please reply to my question. Thanx in advance.

Then he told me that it was a COMPENSATOR and not a turbo and that it only boosted something like 0.3 bar which I couldnt believe. It apparently just lets a bit to more air into the combustion chamber. My car develops 66 KW and 200 NM from the 1.3 diesel engine, so he told me it would develope up to 80 KW or more if you put in a conventional turbo and boosted it to 1.6 bar or higher. OK, I dont really know a lot about engines (more about the car itself) so I couldnt argue. So diesel Opel drivers out there. Does this car have a COMPENSATOR or a TURBO and can you make it develop more KW and whats a COMPENSATOR and its job ? Whats the difference between a compensator and a turbo ? Please please reply to my question. Thanx in advance.

20090131165352AAurJme	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	How does the US driving system work?	I'm from Canada, so I'm just curious as to how the driving system works in the US.      here, (well in my province), we have three levels, and then we're fully licensed.       First level: G1--basically a written test. Minimum age 16. After passing it, we get a "driver's license" card, but we're only allowed to drive a car with someone who has 5 years of road experience.       Second level: G2--- After 8-10 months of getting the G1, you do a road test (not including highway). After passing the G2, you can drive on your own (including the highway). But there are limitations (like you can't drive pass X o'clock etc.)      Third (and last) level: G--after a year of getting the G2, you do a final road test (which includes the highway test). Once you pass it, you're fully licensed.       I think it's pretty much the same across Canada. so how is it in the states? does it differ very much between states?

20090131165205AAoupGi	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Help! This is the estimate that I was given to fix my car...what do I do now?	Hi everyone, about a week or so ago, I was involved in an accident, and the fender was badly damaged on the passenger side, the headlight is popped out of the socket, and the fog light completely fell out.  When I took the car to a body shop today, not a dealership body shop, just a regular neighborhood body shop, the estimate that the shop manager printed out for me was $4300 bucks!  My car is an 02 Impala, with 100,500 miles on it, so the amount it would cost to fix it truly startled me. I'm so worried about this!  I am in school so I have to have a car; however, the other drivers insurance company is dragging their feet on my claim, and i'm worried that they will find me at fault and not pay for the damages.  What do I do?  I can't imagine an 02 Impala being worth that much money to fix anymore.  So if her insurance refuses to pay, what else can be done?  I have insurance, but would they still pay if the other driver was found to not be at fault?  Also, the shop manager freaked me out because he said the radiator wasn't damaged, but that it could start leaking anytime and might burn the motor and then both insurances will refuse to pay, so I should leave it to be fixed asap.  He also told me he was an ex insurance adjuster and could really stay on them about my claim...but i'm just worried that i'm going to end up paying way more than my car is worth.  Any advice on how to deal with this?

20090226090301AAY72SO	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Hyundai	What is wrong with my Hyundai Coupe steering?	Over the last week or so I have noticed that there is a problem with the steering on my car.  When I turn the wheel, it does not recentre itself when I stop turning, meaning that the car will continue to turn.  Sometimes this seems to be worse than others.  Any suggestions what this could be?   Thanks

20090131203719AAyabHj	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Buying a Used Van - Quickly?	We are moving interstate and after seeing the price of renting a van ($700 AUD plus), wondered if we might be better off to buy a used one and re-sell it after the move.  We have only 11 days before the move, so we don't have much time to research our options. Presuming we buy a Toyota Hiace, 10-15 years old, reasonable condition, for an average price for that type of van, private sale, our questions are:      Will it be hard to re-sell (in Melbourne)?      What is the quickest and cheapest way to get the van professionally checked (so we know we're not buying a lemon)?
20090131204347AANwxZ2	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Why I am like this(driving Q)?	Alright, I turn 16 on monday and go for my learners permit on tuesday.  I am confident I can past the knowledge test but I really am not sure Im going to be good at driving.  I honestly aren't even looking forward to driving even though I know I should be.  I've never been this unself confident, ever.  I think it could be that my gf has been driving for like 4 months and I've gotten so jealous that I just don't even want to, but I dont think.  Is this normal or what?
20090131204635AA7lLM3	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Inside panel of car door fell off...?	While I was shoveling out my car from a recent snowstorm, I kind of broke my door...   I had to open the door from the inside, since it was frozen shut. When I pushed my front driver's side door open, the inside panel fell off. I would normally just take it off, but there are a ton of wires attached to various things on the door which prevent that.   Is there anything I can easily do to reattach the panel? I can't open my door right now, since the panel won't stay on by itself.   Thanks! 10 points to whoever provides a solution. :)

20090226091019AAgybMl	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How can I get the most out of my car's warranty (about to expire)?	I have a 2005 Scion XB, and it's been a great car since I bought it brand new. I have a warranty from toyota that expires at 75,000, and I am currently at 65,000  now. I blow through miles fairly quickly, and I'm due for an oil change right now. Is there a way to schedule a service appointment without a major complaint? Is there anything like a "wellness checkup" for a car, that might catch something that needs to be fixed while it's still under warranty? I just know that as soon as it expires, something's going to go wrong! Thanks for any advice!
