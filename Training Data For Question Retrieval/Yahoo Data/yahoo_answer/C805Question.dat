20090227103254AApqlEL	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Isn't vegetarianism bad for the environment?	Now go with me here, I hate even killing bugs or animals, but I do love meat (messed up conundrum sorry) isn't vegetarianism bad because it allow more animals to consume more resources from humans and according to the (liberal) State or California causes more pollution then cars do  http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/08/0...  I need help with this question then for a school paper.      1 do we kill all animals down to manageable number and be come vegetarians?    2 do we continue on the same route that we are going?   3 Do we control species and teach more of a mod oration stance(teaching people to eat more fruits and vegetables), allowing people to still choose, decreasing the desire for huge ranches that produce steroid induced pollution.

20090227104458AAlEAEd	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Isn't it time for a new beer industry category?	It is time for a Craft-Mega segment of the beer industry. Many of the smaller brewers have really grown so much that they now produce well over a million barrels a year, use television and other forms of advertisement, and no longer represent the small guy-brewer. Brewers such as Boston Brewing Co, Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, and others have just grown too big to be called craft or microbrewery and this especially is true because of the continued up start operations of very small (less than 5,000 barrels/yr) brewers every year. It is now time to call them Craft-Mega brewers.

Well, I've been keeping a close eye on her, making sure she doesn't commit any vegan infractions. And what do you know, she was trying to sneak her heart pills. I could not believe it. I mean innocent animals died to create those pills and she knew that! I grabbed them up and flushed them down the toilet. I was tellin grandma how awful she was when I realized she had her teeth in! I had already gone over this with her, so I grabbed them and ran until I got to my apartment. Now my mom says I need to give back her teeth and not take her pills anymore, but she agreed to this lifestyle. What should I do?

I'm throwing my best friend a party for her 14th birthday... well, actually, we're planning each other's parties! So... I've come up with a few ideas after looking at birthdaypartyideas.com, but I still need a few more! I haven't looked at all of the parties, but I have seen a couple. Here are her requirements:      She wants to have a boy-girl party   She doesn't want a dance party, because everyone is having them   She wants it to be the party of the year   She doesn't care whether it's at her house or away from the house   She wants a big group to be invited   She needs it to top everyone elses   She doesn't really have a budget.   She has no theme preference      So, with that in mind, remember, she is turning 14, so please keep it appropriate. It would be in May or June, so I have plently of time to plan. Also, I need the entire game plan (invitation ideas, activities, snacks, decorations, cake/party favor ideas, etc.) because we have to make a power point for her parents or she can't have a party. Some ideas I've come up with are:      Roxy in Wonderland (cuz her names Roxy)   A Hotel Party (her parents rent out the ballroom at a hotel)   A Limo/Party Bus party   and some party where we play Bigger or Better      Please help!! I need to let her know my ideas by tomorrow!      Thanks so much!!      ~huggs and kissies!!

20090310021920AAjs1Tu	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	What's your usual breakfast?	It's so weird that at home we don't eat breakfast. I grew up thinking it was normal and when my friends and I talked about what we eat in the morning, I was like,"I only drink hot chocolate then that's it." Then they would be shock. Maybe we don't eat breakfast because of our busy lifestyle, no one cooks. My mom and dad goes to work and I would go to school everyday and we don't have a helper and we also don't know what to cook in the morning. Enough of eggs and hotdogs, we don't eat those.
