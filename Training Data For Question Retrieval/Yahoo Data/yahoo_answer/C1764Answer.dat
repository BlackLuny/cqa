Simpson, he'd have been in prison YEARS AGO !<br>  <br>  Double life sentences, or the chair.<br>  <br>  Only in America.|`|VG7k5QRFaa	No because:<br>  <br>  1. He would've been framed by Mark Furhman who was a proven racist, as case investigators discovered and took a walk with OJ's blood samples and spread it all over the place...and yet OJ didn't have enough cuts on his body to allow for that much blood loss.  There was no outcry about Mark's mistreatment of blacks from whites or from Mark's black wife.  <br>  <br>  2. He might not have been able to afford a high-priced attorney like Johnny Cochran and would've been sent to jail for a crime he didn't commit.<br>  <br>  OJ isn't guilty of the crime of murder...he's guilty of the crime of stupidity for chasing down white girls who were obviously gunning for his money with lines like he dreamed she was Nicole or that she looked like Nicole or he confessed to her.  His stupidity also led him to continue to provoke those who wanted him in jail because he dared to marry the white woman that society tricks every race into believing is the best.  He was caught stealing and all of his friends turned against him to testify against him...if that doesn't scream "setup" I don't know what does.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, OJ, despite being supported by blacks and who had his life saved by a black lawyer continued to either provoke his ex-wife's white family, tease whites in general and was obsessed with white women.  He has plenty of time to think about that where he's going.  The only reason I supported him was because whites were trying to protect a white woman who was far from innocent and frame a black person who wasn't a nice guy but didn't kill her or her lover.  The proof wasn't there.  Just like the whites mainly protect the cops who shoot blacks and support the jury's decision in THOSE cases, they should support the jury's decision when OJ was set free.  <br>  <br>  Obviously his last trial was a mockery as the judge sentenced him as revenge for his escape from the first case.  How is that justice?  Also,<br>  her family (who cared nothing for her when she was alive but wanted to profit from his money and her death) sued him for endangerment or something stupid like that.  But if he didn't kill her, how could he be held responsible for her death?<br>  <br>  I don't like OJ.  I never have and I never will.  But that doesn't make him a murderer and the fact that whites continue to be obsessed about it when there was no proof, the cops didn't look for anyone else (why would HE look for anyone else, she didn't love him) and the jury cleared him makes me realize that just like Micheal Jackson who owns the records by the Beatles (makes whites angry because he won't give up control or let them use it when they want to) or Kobe who's so skilled that the media has been looking for reasons to bring  him, Wade and LeBron down so that Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki and other white stars can be elevated in American's eyes while supporting that white girl who lied that he raped her when no one heard her scream or heard any sounds of fighting in a huge hotel and she had no marks and she went out and slept with other guys after an event so traumatic that most women want to kill themselves afterwards...?<br>  <br>  Really...I think if OJ wasn't famous he would've ended up destroyed or--maybe I was wrong at the start---he would get a WORSE sentence being an ordinary citizen who might not have gotten as much media coverage or support from blacks or officials who feared that those who love celebrities would make their lives miserable.|`|AA11919719	Probably not because he would have already been in prison for killing his wife and her friend.

Some groups of users have banned together to help each other out, but often sadly their questions & answers are obscene, ridiculous, or mundane.<br>  <br>  The idea of 'Yahoo Answers' was a good one at the beginning, but too many individuals have abused this site, esp. now that they can ask questions, based on the trivial answers they've given & receive the 'Best Answer', by using a collective group of people.<br>  <br>  However, after saying all that, there still is a large number of interested, curious & deep thinking individuals using Y/A.

But when there is just a normal average question, that genuinely needs answering, people seem to ignore it because it isn't anything 'exciting'.|`|7YHKNvjNaa	If you go to sections like polls&surveys you'll get loads of answers, because everybody there is fun and doesnt mind answering.|`|CHPuw61Uaa	Ask questions that will tempt people to express their opinions forcefully.

Anyone with an addictive personality will continue to chase a high, no matter what the drug. Weed won't kill you though.<br>  <br>  No matter if it's heroine, X, or weed that gets legalized, gangs will still be in the drug business. You'd be taking away their biggest money maker though. During this crucial time for our country we can not over look financial gain this would provide. Both in taxing and the release of nonviolent drug offenders from prisons around the US. <br>  <br>  I believe during the near future rights will be given to the states to decide their own marijuana laws.

I've seen both my cousins change from decent blokes to absolute monsters who only cared about scoping more weed and prepared to do anything to get the funds to buy it. <br>  <br>  Responsible consumption of alcohol does not result in the effects you described.  I don't know of any benefits to the human body that marijuana provides. Inebriation doesn't count. I've heard ludicrous claims that it promotes 'creativity'.<br>  <br>  But the main reason is criminals. Most gang crime and the resulting gun murders are related to the illegal distribution of cannabis and the territorial mindset of drug dealers.  If you legalise marijuana, the criminals will move onto cocaine, which hurts more people worldwide and has more telling effects on the human body.<br>  <br>  Nobody so far has managed to convince me of the benefits of legalising marijuana.  By constanty using the 'but alcohol is legal' excuse, it avoids the main issue.  In that case, do marijuana smokers want alcohol made illegal?   Is that their main objective?  As shown, when something is legalised, the public abuse it, they have been doing with alcohol and binge drinking, it's safe to assume that in time, they will with Mary J, that is unless they haven't moved on to Charlie, for an even better 'hit'.|`|T2JlDJD7aa	California will more than likely legalize it.

My guess is Obama has his reasons for doing so.  He might be trying to send a message to Brown with his gift selection, probably a personal message more than one that will be scrutinized by the media.  And who knows what "gifts" may have been given that aren't known to the public.  The British media loves to blast on American "tackiness" or lack of tact, culturally the British value etiquette much more than Americans.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps Obama sees the exchange of elaborate gifts as a bit deceitful given the ever evolving (but always 'friendly') relationship the U.S. has with Britain.  Obama could argue that "frivolous" spending, even from his own fortune, would be distasteful at a time of such economic crisis?  I don't think that's the best excuse though.  I think Obama has his reasons  and this shows how important personal relationships are between heads of state.  This "slap in the face" as the British media is sure to make it out to be, could be a deliberate message Obama is sending to Brown.  I think it's kind of neat, shows that Obama is really playing ball and supporting America's interests.  Even those against Obama who argue that he's inexperienced or a pushover for diplomacy should see that Obama's not afraid to tell the Brits "Hey, we're playing for real here.  Stop kissing our ***, because we're not gonna keep kissing yours.  We got business to get done, so lets cut the bullsh*t and get to it".<br>  <br>  Sure, the liberal media probably would call out Bush for a "faux pas" like this.  But Obama is clearly not Bush.  I'm interested to see how they explain it.  But let's be real - the gifts our heads of state are giving to each other shouldn't be the focus of the media.

9SB2Y5r8aa	Here is a summary of the Palestinians crises caused by *** :  <br>  <br>  Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are begging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people. <br>  Now after Israeli ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>       Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2   Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1- Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2- Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3- Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4- Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5- Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6- The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7- Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1- International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2- Free all prisoners.<br>  3- Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4-  Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5- Remove all the settlements. <br>  6- Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7- Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace will be so far.  <br>  <br>  Despite these facts Palestinians are going for - senseless negotiations if any are there.  !!!.<br>  <br>  Map of Palestine<br>  <br>  www.countryseek.com<br>  <a href="http://www.annainthemiddleeast.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.annainthemiddleeast.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4...</a>|`|fFq68dJYaa	Actually, the initial payment came from Europe, namely Britain.

There is genetic evidence to suggest that the Palestinians do indeed have lineage roots tracing back to the Canaanites, the Philistinnes, etc. and the overall Semitic peoples and cultures that existed there.<br>  <br>  It is absurd to ask the Palestinians to move out of their homes to make way for a 1900 year old Biblical claim.<br>  <br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  "We must expel Arabs and take their places." <br>  -- David Ben Gurion, 1937, Ben Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, 1985.<br>  <br>  "Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist. Not only do the books not exist, the Arab villages are not there either. Nahlal arose in the place of Mahlul; Kibbutz Gvat in the place of Jibta; Kibbutz Sarid in the place of Huneifis; and Kefar Yehushua in the place of Tal al-Shuman. There is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population."<br>  -- David Ben Gurion, quoted in The Jewish Paradox, by Nahum Goldmann, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1978, p. 99.<br>  <br>  " If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been Anti-Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?" <br>  -- David Ben Gurion (the first Israeli Prime Minister), quote by Nahum Goldmann in Le Paraddoxe Juif (The Jewish Paradox), pp. 121-122.<br>  <br>  "If I knew that it was possible to save all the children of Germany by transporting them to England, and only half by transferring them to the Land of Israel, I would choose the latter, for before us lies not only the numbers of these children but the historical reckoning of the people of Israel."<br>  -- David Ben-Gurion (Quoted on pp 855-56 in Shabtai Teveth's Ben-Gurion in a slightly different translation).<br>  <br>  <br>  However, keep in mind that not all Jews support Zionism.

In the meantime,  the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem,  the uncle of Arafat,  was in Berlin making a deal with Hitler that if the Germans got to the holy land,  the Muslims would help round up the Jews.   <br>  <br>  That of course was an act in support of the Germans and a direct act against the British.   Giving aid to the enemy so to speak.   So the British,  as punishment for the Palestinians supporting Hitler and Germany,  decided to give the land to the Jews.   <br>  <br>  So the Palestinians are being punished for their own war crimes.    <br>  <br>  Which they still seem to be committing.|`|tod8jy9Paa	Joe J Have you ever stopped to think why Hamas are firing these rockets ?

AA10841629	Ah, I think it's a pipe dream. Not only would the government collect trillions in revenue - they would save trillions on prisons, courts, police, sheriffs, etc.  It would instantly create more jobs than ever - combined with the science that Obama is legalizing - hemp - the plant, could save the world - providing food, oil, plastic, and get us off imported oil. Henry Ford made a car to run on hemp, out of hemp.  No more cutting of trees for paper, etc.  So good to clean the air, so good for medicine.<br>  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson would be proud.|`|uK4hyhe3aa	I wish.  There's a lot of money to be made in the decriminalization of marijuana and it's possible regulation (though that's a bit of a stretch for now).  Not only are hundreds of thousands of people in jail for non-violent marijuana related 'crimes' (sucking up our valuable tax money in an already overcrowded and inefficient prison system, and leaving their single wives dependent on social support to take care of their families), but the overall focus on marijuana as a dangerous drug is just taking away resources from more important issues.  Most of the crime associated with marijuana is with it's dealing and transport, if it was decriminalized a lot of that fear and violence associated with it would probably decrease.<br>  <br>  Most of the folks who are weary of marijuana decriminalization are the same people who don't like the government in their "business".  Make a choice, folks and face the reality of the society we live in.  We're grown ups, and we can be good parents and instill in our children the values we would like them to have.  But I don't think legalizing pot is going to end up in the entire U.S. population being stoned and lazy.  It's called personal responsibility, right?<br>  <br>  And the taboo with pot is a bit extreme.  I would rather hear about a politican smoking a doobie (and you gotta believe plenty of them are doing so in the privacy of their own homes) than picking up a hooker or sending "illicit" emails to male pages.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Good.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, we can start taxing the crap out of it like we do alcohol and cigarettes and maybe make some real money.<br>  <br>  Plus, think of all the money we'll save in court fees in not chasing and trying to convict pot-heads.<br>  <br>  Sounds great to me.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I had to explain to my neighbor why someone spray painted 4:20 on his garage door.|`|0JL3Mg78aa	He can't speak for the states--he can lift the federal ban on any use of marijuana.

It's a terrible tragedy.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Such a sad thing..a pastor dead..gunman has mental illness..church members in shock..and dismayed..violence has been affecting churches for some time now.<br>  God bless everyone who has been directly affected by this shooting//crime..|`|emJ79qagaa	Calm down shirlock! I heard this on CNN, its all over the news<br>  <br>  Yes terrible<br>  <br>  I think there was something personal going on between the gunman and priest.<br>  <br>  Enough motive to wan't to kill him<br>  <br>  I used to live near there<br>  <br>  sh*t happens
GOifC7i3aa	it would seem so<br>  <br>  and some of the religious monsters come to britain to spread their own particular brand of islam to influence the weak of mind and those ready to hate<br>  <br>  i find it incredible that the apologists say bad things happen in other places too.....well that's alright then...lol|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	Yes, unfortunately their strict adherence to the unchangeable ancient texts of the koran have kept them and many fellow muslims in a state of suspended animation.<br>  Frozen in time and unable to adapt and keeping their women down.<br>  Primitive indeed and sad and frightening considering that a 1000 years ago they were leaders in thought and philosophy.<br>  Now it is just one way koranic traffic.|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	And God said honor your father and mother so that your days would be long.  This is someone's grandmother that took those 40 lashes.  <br>  <br>  Yes and the Islamic muslims in America want Sharia Law here and they want the government to give them a state so that can practice their law in their state in our America.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Yes we have horrible things happen in America, but our government and our laws do not condone it.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Our laws and our government in America condones the sexual garbage and drugs of Hollywood and other cities, they condone the killing of innocent blood by abortion  and they condone the killing of Terry Sciavo so we may be beating 75 year old women next.  The world is becoming more primitive<br>  all the time, but then the world is sinning more and more against God all of the time.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	The legal system in Saudi Arabia is based on Sharia law.<br>  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications...</a><br>  <br>  Primitive? No.<br>  Savages? No.<br>  A sensible response to a 75 year old woman? Absolutely not! Their law is crazy and so are they.|`|My65doewaa	That's typical Islam.. which, of course, is primative savages.|`|j7rBM2yTaa	No. I've been there and there's still lots of open space.|`|uK4hyhe3aa	Yes that's unfortunate but the American government, and I would say most governments, do some regrettable, terrible things to their people sometimes.  That is the state, not the people, and the anger you have should be directed towards that state, and not the people who live there.  I think it's terrible to call them primative savages, if you knew anything about Saudi Arabia you would know that it is far from a "garbage civilization".|`|YfUuV87kaa	DISGRACEFUL.<br>  <br>  However, I do hope you realise crazy awful things happen all over the world. The whole world is filled with many primitive savages including large numbers of mothers who kill their own children!|`|b693a4e41cb15318c6d87649be23999daa	The most oppressive, tyrannical government on the planet that buys goodwill and silence with oil.  For the most part yes to your question.|`|CDymqY65aa	No, the news only focuses on the bad things that happen.|`|olopisx7aa	Yes, it sure seems that way. One of the most backward countries in the world.

GOifC7i3aa	arab militias murdering and raping anyone who is not an arab|`|eRVRWwkBaa	The war began in 2003 and resulted from a combination of drought,over population and destruction of the land;it no longer could produce.<br>  The war is considered by some to be ethic and tribal based and not religious. But it doesn't matter;people are being killed,tortured,women and even girls raped and it is ugly and bloody.|`|krqfJViEaa	They're having problems because Arabs are getting rid of non-arabs.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	who cares?
4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	Because it's a downright lie. You shouldn't believe anything you hear on al Jazeera - all they broadcast are Arabian fairytales.|`|GOifC7i3aa	there is little difference between the islamic terrorists in gaza, lebanon and darfur.....the big difference is the people they target with their hatred<br>  <br>  hamas and hezbollah target israelis and jews,,,primarily<br>  <br>  those arab terrorists in darfur target anyone who is not a muslim ....<br>  <br>  and of course they aren't reporting the attacks by hamas .....it would make the islamic thugs look like aggressors and not the victims they pretend to be....|`|4eLzY2hfaa	do you really expect that you will get the truth from al-jazeera?|`|tod8jy9Paa	Are you saying that Israel have never broken this latest ceasefire ? What about the near daily air strikes from Israel "brave" pilots who can bomb at will without fear from anti aircraft guns.? these rockets killed 13 some of who were military personnel. Israel killed 1300 civilians (350 babies and young children) in just 22 days.   Now who are the real terrorists ?|`|coORprxGaa	im just surprised by idiotic is in the top his name (Avon of Blake's 7)<br>  the poor man think that what (AL-JAZEERA) says isn't true <br>  if we don't believe what we watch and hear by the audio-visual what can we believe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|4GBJBsLDaa	Al-Jezzera is a propaganda machine and nothing else. Nothing they say is the truth.
KS2sfVBcaa	No I can't place what it means but I'm sure you'll get it :^)
a202c9cfdcfda8338fc4de9906f5f965aa	yes.<br>  <br>  voluptuous? lol I wish|`|P1XfUB9Haa	Yes, he killed Commodus.|`|4GBJBsLDaa	No. Neither did Boudica.|`|OPvQRKamaa	Should this be in 'CURRENT events'..? Me thinks not...|`|GOifC7i3aa	in this life and the next...me thinks
4eLzY2hfaa	i would say 6 flags in gurnee, illinois.|`|tguEmxVyaa	Long Beach Ca.
cIttXzrwaa	It is a bogus war that never should have happened.  Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.  It's over oil and money and we bought the Bush lies.  That's all there is to it.|`|GOifC7i3aa	sad that so many lives have been lost<br>  <br>  saddam had already had wars with iran and had invaded kuwait...and murdered thousands of kurds with weapons of mass destruction<br>  <br>  if he had managed to get nuclear weapons i think he might have used them ......he boasted he had weapons capable of doing big damage........if he did he shipped them out....but it was just  matter of time before he created another war in the middle east.....he tried to involve israel in 1991 to escalate the gulf war.....|`|4eLzY2hfaa	old news, it's winding down.|`|EdnKfGdjaa	I think that we should still be fighting in Iraq because when Obama takes the troops out of Iraq WHATS GONNA HAPPEN? I think that they will try to attack us again because if we back down now we will be revealed to the world that we are the "weak" country so more and more people will want to attack us. If people attacked us it would probably be about now because when they knock down a big building they probably will not rebuild it because of the sucky economy so then and on|`|muvaqkaHaa	The war in Iraq was inevitable. It was going to happen sometime, and everyone knew it. We went to Iraq to find the terrorists. "War on Terror."<br>  Bush didn't do anything wrong! If I was the president, and a group of terrorists took out the trade centers and tried the Pentagon, I'd hit them with nucs. He could have done a lot worse. He was just showing them what's up.|`|a292abef1a0f2e960a3aeec079ea9c8baa	Available evidence strongly suggest that WMD'S did not exist,the Secretary of State ahem over-stated the case to the UN the failure<br>  to locate,identify and show such gives lie to the existence of same.<br>  The Iraqi's did not inniate,support  nor were their nationals involved<br>  in the 911 attack whereass our ETERNAL FRIENDS theSAUDISS were<br>  up to their eyeballs.
821247dc614c8fbec4560efe894fb510aa	Yes|`|VgPG5WMsaa	In the socialist mind only.
43f9Ctozaa	It's Black. Not only are Black against other people who don't look like them but being black isn't always enough. You have to be Black enough|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	Humans.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	In my own experience...Blacks. It keep them going. They feed on it. Why do better and do good when you have Whites to blame everything on?<br>  <br>  p.s. Most Blacks work hard, pay their bills and are trying to raise decent children. It's the lowlifes that are racist.
dCewrtXaaa	Laugh? Only with joy that we finally have a leader who has got his priorities straight and has the courage to take bold action.<br>  <br>  The rich won't leave, except for vacations. The US is still their cash cow. And the economic crisis is worldwide. No, they will just wait until Obama's drastic policies start to work and turn the situation around, and then the profits will start rolling in again. Don't cry for them.|`|S8RL9lieaa	You hit it on the nail when you say they might just leave. Let me assure you the moment he got got close to being elected was when the money left the US. Nobody has made the link between his rise to fame and the collapse of the economy. Take a look at the the dates and you'll see a trend that the more he looked likely the worse the economy got, until  bingo he is a racing certainty and you know the rest.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	What would you do if you were in his shoes?  Tax the poor and unemployed?  They don't have any money.|`|JLayHNZCaa	No they don't make me laugh.   The rich aren't going anywhere, they have it made here and no where else would they get the a***s kissed like here and it is much safer here than anywhere else.|`|AA11898755	The rich "might just leave"??? <br>   ...this is not something thats happened since Nov.....This is a do-do ball years in the making. Brace yourself for worse to come.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	wow the rich have so much money they dont lnow what to do with i mean there buying 20,000 dollar toilets <br>  why do they mind so much being taxed|`|qR0eiqnYaa	No they don't make me laugh, they make me think this is the end of America as we know it and  as it has been for over 200 years.  Its now becoming one big socialistic, welfare laden, economic disaster.  Very sad that foolhardy people can't see that.  The economies of the socialistic governments in Europe are crashing too.  The problem is, socialism only works till the money runs out, well guess what, the money ran out.  One of the founding fathers once said, "those who give up freedom for a little security deserve neither".  VERY TRUE!|`|oMF6bXCZaa	No Obama's economic policies do not make me laugh.<br>  <br>  But I thank you.  Your question gave me my first good laugh of the day.  You are so very frustrated and upset that President Obama is doing so much in the few weeks he has been in, and that makes you an unhappy camper, doesn't it.  One can tell the people that did not vote for President Obama.  They keep coming out of the wood work, trying to find something, anything to bring him down.<br>  <br>  Keep trying. you have a long road ahead of you.<br>  <br>  Thanks again for the laugh.|`|i4QYyUsRaa	I might laugh if Obama's election hadn't cost me 2/3rds of my lifetime of savings so far and everyday the stock market plunges lower whenever he flaps those lying lips. Can't see much humor in destroying America's economy and bringing all civilized nations down with it.|`|XHCoIo3zaa	Actually Obama's economic policies make me angry and sad.  I am not laughing.  It's grotesque to see the worshipful treatment Obama is getting.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Actually, they make me wonder if at the end of the year I'll receive a tax refund, or will paying hundreds of dollars to support his tax policies.|`|mno4Qd5paa	It makes me angry because all it is, is one big welfare package.|`|88vcImqiaa	No, actually they make me want to throw up.|`|fyKydb6Iaa	OK so let the rich ceo's keep taking your money ...
VgPG5WMsaa	Why would you want to.
