I was in an accident last August and the insurance company declared the car I was still financing from a small dealership a "total loss".  I was able to keep my car, but since being laid off I fell behind on my payments. I'm scared the dealer is going to repo my can, but can they?

I applied for a new tax disc on the 26th of February, two days before it ran out. I would have done it earlier but forgot. I know I've got five days from when it runs out before I have to display the new disc. The problem is, the DVLA did not send a new disc because "they couldn't recognise my postcode". It used to be GE4, but has now changed to GE24, so they didn't send it.    I called today and they're going to send me a new one. Question is, can I still drive until it gets here, especially as it's not my fault?      Thanks,       Riley.

20090306161957AA8aYyQ	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	What Does This World Lead To?	Ever thought of an idea that can change the Economy? Protection? Deaths? Less Law Breaking? Well i have!      I Recently thought that if we have so many accidents, deaths, street racing, and low economy, That i should or We all should, Create a device that the car controls it self, instead of you controling the car. In to do that, i thought if we take a example of NEON lights that go under the car to light the below the surface of the car to have a memory software to let the Neon control the movement. There would be questions on how would it turn? How does it go or stop? Well let me explain, If the Neon hits the ground, there would have to be no lines (lanes), The meaning of that is if there is lanes beneath the car, then it will malfunction, if there wasn't then it would have no problems. Although that i said there cant be lanes, Heres the correction, There are Lanes but 10 inches away from the car, So it can stay on the road and not go crazy if the Neon lights hit the lane. If the Neon lights Do hit the lane Then it will automaticly correct the coordinates of the car to be moved inside the lanes. There would be no steering wheels, But then how would it turn you say? As i was saying about if the Neon lights touch the lanes that it will correct its coordinates to move it back in between the lanes, For that matter of fact if you need to turn then it will keep on touching the lanes till the lanes get straight again. Now you must be thinking how would the car be able to cause NO car accidents or crashing into any kind of object, Well to fix that, The cars will have on its Frontside, Backside, And Sides a Simulated Shield System That if it gets near anything By 10 Inches or 15 Or 20 Inches that it will automaticly Stop the car so it does not hit the object (Stopping the Car like Brakes) And thats how it wouldnt touch anything at all. Now, you must be thinking how would it go the way that we want it to? You would have a Computer Device that will come in the car or be implemented For you, And the Computer Device will have The Following:   -Map   -Coordinates (For Someone to track your car and having the person to be able to drive to you)   -The Car Gages (As a Tab)   -Radio System (As a Tab)   -Heating Or Cooling (As a Tab)   -MemoPad And Address Book With Number/Place (As a Tab)   -Internet (As a Tab)      For this type of System for cars to make it work, The roads would have to be Redone in order to function properly.      Now its time to get to the economy problem. If this is going to be released, It will cost money, And If they dont buy it By One month when its released, Then the Police will start giving a $200 Fine if they Do NOT have it. If there will be new technology your probably most likely thinking that, what if the system breaks? There would be a Shop to fix the System Problem Or Problems. It would cost $50 To get the System fixed.      If there is anything more that can be implemented of your recommendations please reply and I will think about it and see if it can be functionable, Reason why? Because Soon i want to confirm this with the Government and See if they will approve to this kind of situation.      If you guys/ladies want to know how old i am, I Am 14 Years old and I Am a Boy looking into My Mechanic Electronical Dream That i have shared.      Have a nice day and tell me what you think about this idea to help out the citizens of U.S.A, And Please do not share disrespectable comments about My Thought Or About Me.      Thank you for your time for reading :]

Yesterday I got my first ticket ever...and it just happened to end up being a reckless driving ticket (76 in a 55.) I was attempting to pass someone going about 43 in a 55 and when I started to pass them, they sped up. I couldn't fall back into the spot I was previously in because the car that was behind me pulled up to where I had been, so I had to speed up even more to get around the car I was passing in the first place. I got in front of the car and was slowing down when the cop got me.   I was wondering a few things about what may happen... I'm 18 (be 19 by the time my court date is) and I have a spotless driving record (till now dang it.) What are some of the things in court I could get for this (ie. driving school, suspension of license, fine, etc.) How much of a rise will this put on my insurance? Also, should I hire a lawyer? My cousin (who is about my dad's age) is a lawyer who I think I could get to do it for free (or a small fee at least.) Should I volunteer to go to driving school BEFORE my court date (which is in May) or should I just wait for the judge to decide?      This happened in a rural county in Virginia...out in the Northern Neck (if anyone knows where that is.)

20090307094728AA50Uxs	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car was running without oil, and I dont know for how long. Help!?	I have a 2004 Mazda 6      I know I was dumb not to get my oil changed...please dont tell me that.      My car started making rattling/rubbing noises when I was accelerating. The noise would go away once the car warmed up. It is also idling funny...revving when stopped.      I brought it to the mechanics and they said there is NO oil..      How much damage could this have done? Is it reversable?? Help Im so worried now.

20090307091544AAQCpHE	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Can I repair this crack in my radiator?	Ok I have a 99 Nissan Maxima, and just this morning noticed when i had gone to the store i had some smoke coming out from under my hood. I got home and had my boyfriend check it out, and he cleaned up all the antifreeze which wasn't to much. And we started the car up and let it sit a while running with the hood open so we could see where the leak was. Well needless to say we couldn't seem to see it leaking anywheres. SO we took it out for another quick drive, got it home looked again and see that there is a hairline crack about and inch and a half long on the very top of the radiator on the plastic part. Is this repairable? My boyfriend was wondering if he could heat upo some plastic with a soldering iron and melt it on there? or possibly just drain the radiator and try and heat the plastic back together its self without adding more? My boyfriend does have quiet a bit of automotive knowledge but this he has never attempted, and I would like others opinions before we go any further. I just really can't afford a new radiator right now. Thanks

20090307091358AAdFkCt	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why are my rocker arm studs pushing up out of the bore and causing my rocker arms to be loose?	I have a 1970 Chevy Monte Carlo that has a 5.7L/350 motor 4 barrel. Every thing in the motor is all stock. I replaced the cam shaft and lifters (Part # EDL 2102), so I could have a little more Performance.I also put in a new timing chain and gear set (Part # EDL-7800). When I placed everything back together to get the car started my rocker arm studs would push up a little bit out of the bore causing my rocker arms to get loose. So I would tighten them back up and still the same thing would happen. So I took it to a mechanic shop to see if they knew what the problem could be and the guy there said that "the new cam that you bought is to big which is causing the rocker arm studs to lift out of the bore and causing the rocker arms to be loose" Then he tried to persuade me on how I should buy some used motor that he had in the back for $5000 :/ (kinda fishy to me) any how I want a second opinion to see what the case could be. If you know what the problem could be or if you know of any possible solutions please let me know.
