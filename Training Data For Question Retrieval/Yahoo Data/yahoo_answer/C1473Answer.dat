Maybe in the far future, we can develop a political/economic way of life that is equitable to everyone, but that it won't be any time soon<br>  <br>  Through my education in psychology, I have ironically became more anti-psychology because I think it's rushed into being a helping profession before becoming philsophically unified or scientifically useful.  I've also been a patient of the profession and experienced first hand how ineffective and potentially harmful psychotherapy and mind drugs can be. <br>  <br>  I'm anti-spanking of children because hitting children is abusive and teaches kids nothing except to fear pain and handle their conflict in a violent, might makes right sort of way.<br>  <br>  I'm laragely but not entirely anti-punitive in regards to criminal justice because I think basing criminal justice on a punishment model bites society in the *** by increasing recidivism and failing to make offenders into more ethical or productive citizens.<br>  <br>  I'm anti-illegalization of marijuana because it's safer than legal drugs and was only made illegal in the first place because of racist propoganda.<br>  <br>  I'm anti-free breeding because I think it's backwards and irrational for things like driving and liquor selling to require a lisence but custody over a new life to be a birthright.

KBBonf97aa	A lot of straight men have an exaggerated aversion to gays because they're terrified that they'll be perceived as gay if they're indifferent.  It's a strange thing, to be sure, but the negative stigma of male homosexuality frightens the hell out of them.<br>  <br>  Have you ever noticed that straight guys will leave a room if they're exposed to gay porn?  I discovered that during college.  When two men engaged in any sexual acts appeared on the screen, all the straight guys would start hollering about how grossed out they were and actually leave the room.  I think that's because any human being can be aroused by visual depictions of sex, whether they're gay or straight.  It's a biological impulse, rather than a declaration of sexual orientation.  I'm 100% lesbian, but I've seen some amazing hetero sex scenes in movies.  Since straight guys are terrified someone will see them "respond" to the images of men having sex, they'll leave the room rather than risk being labeled gay for a biological response that's completely normal.|`|edJtHlDiaa	I know what you mean and it's annoying.Not every guy i see i like and most straight guys are just full of themselves besides i got a b/f that i'm happy with so i don't need no straight man..lol.|`|SaQ5d420aa	You know what: the whys and wherefores of the Straight world really don't have to be our concern.<br>  As already stated, some straight guys are so horny it is projected on all men, it is just safer to complain about the oversexed gays.<br>  Also: a straight guy who is unsure  of himself may have to speak up whenever his 'straightness' is brought into question.  Obviously a straight, mature guy can take a compliment and maybe even an overture from a gay guy and have no need to over react.<br>  <br>  Maybe some gays have been too pushy and the poor gay guy was uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  In the complaint by C.G. let's just leave the guys who turn you down alone and move on to flattering a straight/gay guy who will appreciate your attention.|`|6KsIsFbaaa	Yeah most Straight Men Think<br>  because were gay we Find every man attractive<br>  <br>  Like they Do with women<br>  They sometimes think every girl wants to ride there junk<br>  But Its Not true<br>  <br>  so eh What can you Do,<br>  Good thing some straight men are like this|`|WoFkYJOnaa	Some of them are really ignorant.|`|aW5uShwtaa	I know exactly how you feel.|`|eo8ZdB4uaa	I know exactly what you mean, boys will hang out with me but most girls try to avoid me, they fear they will be "guilty by association". Also I think it also has to do with being uncomfortable with their own sexual identity, if they question themselves they probably will try to avoid any situations where someone could call them out. It's all fairly sad, I mean it is so offensive when you tell someone and they jump away like you have some sort of contagious disease. It kind of makes them appear to be egotistical, do they really think just because I like girls I want to be with them? How self centered.|`|Fit17SnVaa	i dont think thats the problem. The problem is more like they dont understand gay men so rather than getting to know you for who you are they say things that make them feel more like a man. Im straight myself but have gay friends, nephews and cousins. I take them at face value like I do with everybody else. There are good people straight and gay just the same as there are jerks both straight and gay, it is what it is. I guess I dont see it as much as you do but where I live I think guys in general are acting less like jerks around gay guys and thats at least a step in the right direction|`|nkpj18xjaa	hahaha seriously!<br>  i go through that same BS everyday|`|rh2cRpMHaa	I have had a straight friend or two stop talking to me since I came out, for this same reason.<br>  <br>  They just don't seem to comprehend that gay =/= whore.<br>  <br>  lol|`|11TYEOI1aa	well thats what you have deal with since ur gay....now i have a question for u why r all gay guys voices so gayyy????? hahahaha

Granted they may not like blacks and have a lot of negative opinions of us that I don't see. I see that most causasians are very willing to treat other races  as equals. Most of the problems with race in this country are based on the history of white america which we all know was f**ked  up. However a lot of White people are just like every other race. Although you are welcome to join them, they would much rather be amongst their own. And personally I have come to realize that Latinos are bigger racist than caucasians.

Anyone I ever have known who was racist, were not that way because they were LOW CLASS, it was just Stubborn SOUTHERN PRIDE, and the beliefs they were raised on, and the sad thing about those beliefs, is that they actually had laws backing them at one time.

For example if you know there's a guy who killed an innocent person and you believe that guy should go to jail, then you're not a hater but if you believe this guy deserves an eternal punishment, then I think you are a hater.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Depends. An evil is something that causes harm to someone. Such things would include murder, adultery, torture, etc.<br>  <br>  Being against those things is standing up for the rights of all people not to be hurt.<br>  <br>  But if you're talking about something that does not hurt anyone, that involves no one other than two consenting adults, such as same-sex marriage, then that is not the same thing. Just because you view it as evil doesn't make it so. And fighting against that does make a person a hater.<br>  <br>  Objectively, one can call murder evil. One cannot do the same with things like homosexuality.|`|6jAVElX7aa	I guess if someone commits murder, the parents of the victim may hate the murderer, its a normal reaction. This is something the murderer has to face also.  If they make the laws, that evil is good and good is evil, it is becoming more and more difficult to tell the good guys from the bad ones.|`|2C8U7Itqaa	No, depends on the judgment. <br>  <br>  Kill someone?

Its like someone who prays 5 times a day and also smokes or drink alcohol. Smoking or drinking alcohol would be a sin on his part.<br>  <br>  If he says he's a Muslim then he is, its not up to us to say he's not.|`|h6NUE6VTaa	im just gonna copy paste my previous answer to this question:<br>  <br>  Islamic views on homosexuality have always been influenced by the rulings prescribed by the Qur'an and the teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammed. Traditionally, Qur'anic verses and hadith have condemned sexual acts between members of the same sex. Islam, as one of the Abrahamic religion, along with Judaism and Christianity, rejected homosexuality from the religion's beginning.<br>  Homosexuality is traditionally deemed forbidden by Islamic law.The Qur'an, the central text of Islam believed by Muslims to be the revelation of God,[5] is explicit in its condemnation of homosexuality.[6][7] The Qur'an proclaims Islam as the "religion of nature," and sanctifies and encourages sexual intercourse within marriages only<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuali..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuali...</a><br>  In traditional Christianity, most Christians have regarded homosexuality as immoral. Denominations that hold this position include the Roman Catholic Church[1], conservative synods of the Lutheran Church,[dubious – discuss] the Orthodox Churches, most Evangelical Protestant churches, the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Christian & Missionary Alliance.<br>  Recently, however, some Christians have come to believe that homosexuality is not inherently sinful. Denominations holding this position include the United Church of Canada, liberal congregations within the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Moravian Church[citation needed], the Anglican Church of Canada, the Methodist Church of Great Britain[citation needed], and the Friends General Conference.<br>  The Bible, both in the Old and New Testament, includes several passages that have frequently been interpreted to deem homosexuality sinful;<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuali..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuali...</a><br>  The subject of homosexuality in Judaism dates back to the Biblical book of Leviticus. This describes sexual intercourse between males as an "abomination" that may be subject to capital punishment,<br>  The prevalent view among Jews had been to regard homosexual intercourse as sinful, arguing that it is categorically forbidden by the Torah.<br>  The Torah, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, reflects the Judaism of ancient Israel and serves as the primary source for traditional Jewish views on homosexuality.<br>  The Torah prohibits men from having sex with other men.

Allah knows best and Allah is not cruel.Allah has given warning about that.If someone does the homo,he has great sins and its consequences he make cruelty to himself.We can not blame Allah. Allah loves all humans  especially who want to obey  Allah's warning.Besides that in the hadith,Muhammad pbuh prohibited muslim men to wear clothes just like women and women to wear clothes just like men.A gay is an abnormal person because Allah created him as a man.He has a psychological disease which should be cured..He  will be accepted as muslim and he can be a good muslim if he tried hard to change his bad behaviour.|`|TXyFtQ9uaa	Such an act goes against what Allah has decreed for mankind, Man and woman were created to populate the earth and to worship him.

Allah loves Muslims because they through their acts of worship have surrendered to him, non Muslims have yet to surrender to Allah to earn his love and respect, If you don't love what God loves how can he possibly love you?.

Some argue that the family unit will disintegrate, yet this too has not happened; and in fact there are many same-gender families who are doing quite well at rearing their children.  There is not a scintilla of truth to the notions that gay parents make their children gay or that gay people recruit children.  This is a fear tactic used by the ignorant.

9UNsd4Vtaa	Wicca is the revival of pagan tradition, based on mostly Gardenian traditions.  You can be Wiccan and not call your self a witch.  Wicca is a religion, based on worship of Deity, and nature, magic is the practice of natural and energy based intention.  <br>  <br>  The Devil is a Jewish, Christian, Islamic ideal.  <br>  <br>  The old ways, or pagan ways have no devil.  Each Deity is both because nature is both, each person is both because nature is both kind and giving, cruel and harsh all at the same time.  Every person holds within them the ability to be good and the ability to be bad - your intent is what creates the outcome.  <br>  <br>  If you are young, as in a minor, I would suggest that you respect your parents and their choices now and in the future.  You can investigate other paths but don't jump to rebel.  <br>  <br>  I have a theory that if a person has a true love of spirit, and kindness towards mankind no path is wrong!

Wicca is a polytheistic religion.  The core beliefs of Wicca and Christianity conflict.<br>  <br>  Magical practice, such as witchcraft, is completely different.  Historically, "witchcraft" has generally meant malevolent magic.  However, in the last 100 years, the word has taken on a more general meaning that doesn't make ethical judgments.  Those who speak of witchcraft being evil are often simply applying the older definition.<br>  <br>  There are thousands and thousands of self-described witches who have nothing to do with devils and who do not do any workings you would likely call evil.<br>  <br>  Some Christians think magic in and of itself is evil, but that's an opinion rather than a fact.  Bibles that mention "witchcraft" are using the old definition: the newer definition simply didn't exist when it was written.  Many translations don't even use the word, but instead use "sorcerer."|`|mOMCymHnaa	Wicca is NOT evil.<br>  <br>  Wiccans do not in any way worship or believe in "Satan", "the Devil", or any similar entities.

The type of religion is called polytheistic Paganism, or a nature based religion with many gods and goddesses. <br>  <br>  Wicca sees that the cultures all have something in common, Nature based, and feminine and masculine divinity. <br>  <br>  Gods usually are of wild things like fire, destruction, animals, etc. Goddesses are usually of creation, sustaining, birth, etc. <br>  <br>  Wicca collects them and puts them into 2 gods, One God and one Goddess. It could be called a Unitarian Pagan religion. <br>  <br>  Now devil worship? Please don't mash up my beloved Goddess Isis up with Christian filth. <br>  <br>  The "Witchcraft" comes from our prayers to the Gods or Goddesses of our choice. <br>  <br>  They are rituals that are very symbolic, and usually take a while, and they lead you to develop intimacy with the divine as well as get help or guidance. <br>  <br>  Curses are not allowed.

J4lfOSPiaa	No doubt in my mind, plus they will flood the white house and congress with enough malicious and righteous indignation that our government will go blind from the white - out of paper sent their way!  Next will be the buses  of people with signs and tents to pitch in front of the white house proclaiming the imminent death and destruction of the USA if 2 people of the same gender profess love and wed ergo robbing the gov. of millions of extra tax dollars by not recognizing what is happening anyway, but keeping them single helps the economy a great deal.  Then when darkness falls out comes the jack boots so thousands can goose step loudly so everyone in DC can hear the thunder of thousands of people march in the cover of darkness,  I mean after all it has to be an all out assault  or God forbid they will not have carried out their special duty to force gays to remain in the closet by damning the decision to give them the same rights as Christian heterosexuals. Christians will site a couple of passages of the Bible with condemnation of homosexuals and state they cannot procreate.  They will remain the great ill-informed bigots that they always were and the goose stepping will just grow louder!  I am married with 9 children, 6 of them adopted - how many more people must we add to our ranks with over-crowding and land rape before gays seem like a possible solution to adopt those in need of homes and diminish the total population?  I hear the goose stepping already!!!|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	No, the world will end because they'll be so mad that they'll make it end.

It was perfectly legal in Grecian times.|`|J80LPVLWaa	I don't think so ... see we are right next to Canada which is considered one of the most liberal states out there ... and according to the results from Prop 8 in California the amount of people supporting Gay Marriage has gone up about 8 - 10 % in the last year. Now there is almost an equal amount of people who support gay marriage as there are those who do not support gay marriage. Since the younger generations have been shown text that is supportive of the idea that homosexuality is an caused by genetics, the idea that homosexuality is immoral is going out of the window. Therefore, I think give it a few years and vote on it again and Gay Marriage will be allowed ... <br>  <br>  When that time comes the "Christians Goose" will be even voider than it is now - if anything the recent election of such a liberal leader as Obama fortells that there really has been a change of attitudes considering "traditional moral values" in our government.|`|ytqvP3Tbaa	If it becomes legal across the whole country you will see the downfall of this nation.We are heading towards a socialist nation as is  so its possible in a few more years .

"you are an ugly girl with chinky eyes and you will never can compare to white girl. asian are the most ugly people" and a lot of nasty stuffs I wanted to post on here but I did delet them all. I just curious how can someone very hate me when I never do anything to them and they have never seen me in reality?  just hate me because of my ethnicity? ..........sometime it made me hate myself or my half asian and when I asking a question about my confussing mind. those pppl kept coming and make me more upset.  I know that I'm not chinky, I got beautiful eyes like winona ryders. many ppl in where I living say that my eyes are deep and larger than most caucasian in northern europe, I think my eyes look like ppl from southern europe. anoshorahim ( the guy above my answer has seen many of my pictures because he is my friend.)|`|hHjPFxEdaa	Omg yes!! I finally blocked Jack yesterday because he kept sending me vile emails. He sent me 2 yesterday railing about black men and calling me names.

ncdTxID9aa	Even if I didn't see these pictures, he had no right to fight a female.  And people can disagree claiming he had to defend himself, but this is not defense, nor is hitting a girl defense. These could be fake but still, YOU DON'T FIGHT A FEMALE.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  David -  A woman couldn't knock a guy out with one blow opposed to a man.  Guys who fight women back usually do it for their pride, and in most cases a small fragile guy is not the one fighting a brute female. If men can restrain each other, than they can restrain a female.<br>  <br>  <br>  I know how tough some women are but they find themselves in the worst situations dealing with men physically.

7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	I am very pleased that Pope Benedict provided the moral instruction that Ms. Pelosi obviously and so desperately needs. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, Pelosi remains an open advocate for death, at the risk of her own immortal soul.<br>  <br>  The Pope has made that perfectly clear to her. There is no higher authority but God, and God is not likely to be at odds with the Pope, on the matter of abortion.<br>  <br>  According to Catholic principles, the conditions necessary in order to commit a mortal (deadly) sin are:<br>  <br>  1) The offense must be grave.<br>  2) The person committing the offense must understand that the sin is indeed grave.<br>  3) The sinner must fully intend to commit the sin.<br>  <br>  Nobody but God can judge, but an objective appraisal of the situation seems to indicate that, absent a miraculous conversion, Pelosi (and all those who emulate her sordid behavior) will likely be spending a lot of quality time with Satan, throughout eternity.|`|f5e4d3faddb643c6738d476c71318cb2aa	I think the Pope was right in every way to scold her. Catholics believe that every life has a purpose and meaning and should not be wasted. You can't say your Catholic, but then disagree with the church. You can't have your own little form of Catholicism. It does upset me that the politicians do such things. From the point of view of a minor, it does not feel like a good example to me for the next generation of people.|`|5MVQrmMfaa	Where would Catholicism be today if there were no debate inside the church?

As a Catholic, or so she claims to be, she needs to wake up.|`|wVet0QXVaa	I think many of us (including me) go through stages where we are really cafeteria Catholics, so I'm pretty forgiving of that.  Glass houses, and all.  <br>  <br>  I don't like politicians who really play up that they are Christian and then are pro-abortion, I think it's particularly bad when Catholic politicians do this since our Church is sooooo explicit on when life begins.  It feels like they are using the faith to get votes, which can not be a good thing.  I think this is a little bit different than being a cafeteria Catholic because it seems like intentionally misrepresenting the faith.  And I am offended by them saying that they are seperating their religion from politics on this issue.  I think that there are some issues where that might be possible, but if you actually believe that abortion is murder, how can you possibly seperate that from your political actions?  It blows my mind.  <br>  <br>  I tend not to be a real fan of most Catholic politicians lately because I feel that they are simply trying to manipulate us.  I would be interested in a Catholic politician who actually ran on a platform which was consistant with the main moral teachings of the Church (ie pro-life, pro-family, pro-helping the poor, for peace, for social justice ect...)
bgA9wLD0aa	the reward of paganism is deeper than a ticket to paradise, it's knowing yourself, and discovering your unique role in the big picture.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't trade that for any golden mansion.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	You assume quite a lot about the Abrahamaic faiths. The bulk of people follow them because they were either born into them or because someone convinced them they were the truth.<br>  <br>  Pagans have such a broad range of beliefs there is no one answer to this question. They are not organized nor do they have a unified doctrine. Many pagans have a deep connection to nature and the earth. They sense the immanence of the Divine. Therefore they honor Her in ritual and service. Others follow what makes sense to them carving their own path to enlightenment. Some are exoteric in their interpretations of deity and others are esoteric.<br>  <br>  If you asked a pagan, "Why should I follow your faith?" They would probably answer, "Because you want to." They do not try to convert others. They allow everyone to find his or her own truth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Conversion is implied in the question, "Why should I follow your faith?" While some pagans may believe in a reward system such as Valhalla others don't. Many believe in reincarnation and creating good karma.|`|SXmlCXs4aa	It's not about a reward for me...well, I guess that's not exactly true...the reward would be to live as I believe is right, for me, and not have to kowtow to the belief system that I am 'supposed' to be in line with.

A person follows a Pagan path because that is what she is drawn to, no more and no less. The Wiccan Rede is "If it harm none, do what thou wilt". That's all. <br>  <br>  I will also give you the Wiccan Charge of the Goddess, maybe it will help answer your question. This is just one version of it, but it's the one I use.<br>  =  =  =<br>  Once in the month, and better it be when the moon is full, there shall ye assemble in some secret place, and adore She who is the queen of all witcheries. There shall ye assemble, ye who are fain to learn all sorceries, but have not yet won its deepest mysteries, to these shall She teach all things. And ye shall be free from all slavery as ye shall be free in all things, and as a sign that ye be truly free ye shall be naked in your rites, both men and women also. And ye shall sing, and dance, and feast, and make music and love, all in Her presence and all in Her praise, for all acts of love and pleasure are Her worship. For Hers is the ecstasy of the spirit, and Hers also is joy on earth, nor does She demand aught in sacrifice, for all are Her children. And if you find not that which you seek within yourself ye shall never find it without, for behold, She has been with you and within you from the beginning.|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	Why follow my faith? I do see what you're getting to here, and I'm sorry this answer is so late.<br>  <br>    I follow my faith because I believe in it, I believe that multiple gods and goddesses exist, and that mine have helped me through many things that were supposed to be medically impossible, like getting out of wheelchairs and attending college when I wasn't supposed to be able to pass eighth grade. <br>  <br>  I've experienced the love and care that my deities have for me, and I've felt the the joy that they offer. The reason I follow the pagan faith is my gods. If I didn't believe in them, there would be no point. <br>  <br>  Not only that, but polytheism makes more sense than monotheism from a scientific view, and my faith agrees with modern science.|`|cdpBdzZtaa	Other faiths(other than christianity and islam) are not really into projecting their faith as number one around the world and only their god is true god and they are not really interested in bragging or forcing conversions ,thats the only difference and also you will notice and they will never say follow my faith ,they are open minded.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  I don't know about judaism|`|cECRv4NMaa	Since there is more than one path for Pagans so they all have different beliefs. Same with Wicca. There are many beliefs here too. I do know that for me, I believe in both Goddess and God. I believe that I am here to protect those weaker than myself, to care for the world. I believe there are other ways to solve problems than fighting, or the like. I believe that what you do will come back three fold either good or bad. I believe that you also should never try to force anyone to do what they don't want to do, nor to believe things that they normally wouldn't believe. I believe we should take responsibility for our actions and not to blame it on others. There is more, but these are my beliefs.|`|ZcVkqwkcaa	I follow it because it is right for me, after years of studying, researching, and thinking I've come to this path.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's right for everyone, I think everyone has to figure that out for themselves.|`|SPNHhFXoaa	As far as I know, pagans do not believe in any kind of afterlife torment and only teach of their religion when asked.<br>  <br>  Oh, and most Jews don't believe in hell either.|`|ExCAedp4aa	If I went up and asked a Pagan that, they'd probably answer: "Hey!

Closest universal description might be a "life affirming" nature worshipping - but there are flaws even in this.<br>  <br>  I chose it for many reasons, but a main one was because I liked the concept of personal responsibility.

QdwMhvpCaa	Kids at school rubbed off on me and I used to say it because I didn't really think about it, but when it was brought to my attention, I realized it and I started using lame instead. I still slip up occasionally, but I always correct myself.|`|wnSvjwWuaa	Exactly, that is why we need to combat how the word "gay" is currently used. I did see (in passing) a commercial done by a gay rights group, and substituting the word "straight" in the expression, to also convey a sentiment to mean "stupid", and the people around looked so weirded out...so that's what I do when I hear "gay" being used so derogatorily, I say "did you see those morons on (whatever show)? Isn't that the straightest thing you ever saw?!?"<br>  <br>  It always stops the perpetrators cold.|`|QAV3qrPiaa	It is definately not but a lot of people use it that way.

My daughter, when she was struggling with her sexuality, used to use that word ALL the time. I don't know if it was because she was really struggling with it and she figured if she used it, that people wouldn't think she was or what. Anyway, it rubbed off on me. Now that she is out, we are working on removing it from our vocabulary (in that way). I did use it the other day in front of a gay teenager and I felt bad after because he gave me a dirty look. He knows my daughter is gay and I just hope that he realized it was just a slip and not anything against him because he knows I am very accepting of my daughter and other gay people.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm sorry! I didn't do it to be mean... I did it not thinking about gay being in that context. lots of words have two meanings and that does not mean that we think about the alternate meaning when we use it.  When someone says "that's a wash" meaning it is ruined.... do they think about taking a bath? I know I don't!|`|DIj072Sqaa	Calling gay stupid is so gay!<br>  <br>  It's difficult to stop the evolution of language and 'gay' itself is a borrowed word originally meaning colourful. <br>  <br>  Gay as an insult started in the 80s and has continued since then. It's not really homophobia, just a very irritating misuse of language that has now been used to the extent that it's generally accepted as an alternative meaning of the word.|`|kclpa0Abaa	I personally hate that it's used that way, but the word didn't originally mean homosexual as it didn't mean stupid.<br>  <br>  The popular meaning of words change. Eventually, it'll mean tired. Or wasted.|`|ocy7FEcaaa	I yell at people all the time for saying things like that's so gay. It really pisses me off.

Here's one passage of many from Colossians 3<br>  <br>  15Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. 16Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. 17And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	i think jesus did say we will have life and more "abundantly". <br>  but at the same time Paul writes that WE of all men are most miserable. <br>  <br>  he wrote that not because of his exaltation or his EGO but because whereever he went he was persecuted by those that practiced secret combinations and conspiracy.

I think that people are born gay, but I also believe that life influences decisions. So maybe if someone had god knocked into them a lot as a child and was forced to date boys/girls or whatever that maybe they could somehow suppress these genes. There is defiantly some predisposition for being gay. I know that I was gay from a very young age...so I was born that way.|`|rh2cRpMHaa	I tried for a while to be straight. It didn't happen.

This is no decision, I did not CHOOSE to be a homosexual, I simply AM. It is certainly not easy and no matter what people say about being "born again" and/or "choosing/turning straight" it's untrue. No matter who you sleep with, or who you marry, you are who you are. You can delude the world but deep down you always know the truth. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also as for "turning" girls gay this is a myth, even if they didn't show an intrest in women prior to meeting your friend everyone is curious at some point of time or another. There are also people who go through homosexual "phases" due to this curiostiy, in the lesbian community we call them "hasbians".

c48266c8f34bb8cf1a945602db2ffb33aa	That's a brave question to ask.... and although I'm not condoning incest, I think, there may be others out there like you that might be interested in knowing what other people think.<br>  <br>  Now having said that....  first know that you are not gonna find too many people that think it's ok to do you brother... incest is bad enough, but add homosexual to that and that's like adding a match to dynamite.  So, if I were you, I wouldn't talk to anybody about it... especially your brother.  If he's not receptive to the idea, he might tell your parents, and they may think you really have some deep seated problem and stick you in counseling.<br>  But, if you must.....  I would tell him that you had a dream about him,  and he was making you suck him (or whatever activity) and he was really enjoying it.  Now you really need to watch his reaction.  If he's into it... keep talking and see where it goes.  If he is like totally grossed out, then say something like that in the dream you were so pizzed off that you bit it off, or something like that... and change the subject.  He may think you are a liitle freaky, but you can always fall back on the excuse that it was just a dream.  And... if anyone tries to analyze it.... it'll just look like your brother is trying to control you, or force himself on you, and at least it'll take the pressure off of you....<br>  <br>  Good Luck with that one...... ;~p|`|P0wMTzDFaa	ummm..no,don't do it.<br>  He'll probably tell your parents or something.<br>  <br>  You don't want that,do you?!<br>  <br>  Btw,does you friend know you're on her account?<br>  Maybe,delete it afterwards.<br>  She might find it.|`|DIj072Sqaa	There's a big difference between fantasy and reality. This is most certainly a fantasy that could be extremely damaging if it became a reality. There are some horrific potential consequences if you let this happen not least that it would be in both of your memories when you're much older and that could damage future family relations. In the short term what if he gets freaked out by it or if he tells someone - the consequences would be awful. <br>  <br>  Keep this a fantasy. As a fantasy it's not (that) unhealthy but crossing the line of taking it further certainly is. After all he's someone you respect, someone you look up to, someone who is similar to yourself and someone with some common interests yet a bit older and possibly a bit more mature. All aspects most people look for in a partner. Perhaps it would be better to look at people who are similar to him? If you're close to him are you close to his friends? Maybe through them you can meet someone you connect with.|`|EQydFhzmaa	INCEST! Look, if you want to be with your brother, do the right thing and have your (and his) tubes tied.

Since young people in their very early teens are just starting to deal with sexual thoughts, they're stuck in this transition mode from being a kid to being an adult. <br>  <br>  Since you're still sort of in the "kid" mode, you're thinking of someone who is close to your age (your brother) and who you are emotionally close to (again, your brother). These characteristics are things everyone looks for in sexual relationships. You're just sort of misguiding them into thoughts for your brother because you don't have anyone else who meets those criteria the same way he does. <br>  <br>  Once you get older and you're comfort switches away from your family and toward your friends (happens to everyone), your sexual thoughts will follow. <br>  <br>  Sexuality is a larger issue than we usually get into in this country. In reality, sex is only something that you will like or feel comfortable with when you trust and love the other person 100%. If you find yourself lying awake in bed next to your lover and wonder to yourself, "Hey, what if this is a crazy person who is going to kill me or something?", then you are no where near ready to have sex with them. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately in America, people often think of sex as something that people have to have just for the sake of having it. There is no point in having sex -- or a partner for that matter -- if you don't believe in the relationship totally and trust that person effortlessly. In other words, don't worry about sex so much!|`|P8kzKpOyaa	just make sure you think it through and don't do anything you regret...I would really be cautious since it is after all your brother.|`|BLtN3ZDHaa	Are you kidding me!?!?!?

Later Apollo is thought to have taught there and finally Paul himself visited, towards the end of his life.<br>  <br>  One of Paul's epistles, the letter to the Roman Church is, still today, considered one of the few pieces of systematic theology that can be found in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Christians in those days were persecuted by the Romans. It became much worse after Nero accidentaly set Rome on fire and gave the blame on the Christians, around 64AD.<br>  It wasn't until the emperor Costantine converted to Christianity that their situation improved.<br>  So, you see, the early Christian church in Rome had nothing to do with the modern Roman Catholic Church.|`|wVet0QXVaa	The Roman Catholic Church began with the apostles, Peter and Paul died in Rome where they made many converts.  One of the great things about Christianity is that it is able to reach people as individuals.  Not all Romans persecuted Jews and Jesus and not all Jews like Jesus and not all Jews hated Him.  People are more than their nationality and to be honest, most Roman Catholics aren't Roman.  I'm not at all.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Any Christian who is a serious student of history is, or will become, a Catholic.   The affiliation with Rome was initially not by choice.  Followers of Jesus were hauled there under arrest.  Many were tortured or crucified there.The Roman Empire controlled the entire Mediterranean region.  As Christianity grew,  it grew where people were concentrated - that was largely within the Roman Empire.   Once the Roman government accepted the Truth of Christianity, it was the natural center for The One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.<br>  <br>  In this forum, many answers assert that Roman Catholicism is not even Christian.    That is plainly false.  We are the original Church that was established by Jesus when He selected Peter to be our first Pope.  Some people are merely mistaken about this,  but I fear that many lie.   <br>  <br>  Try reading the Catechism of The Catholic Church.  Study Christian history and the history of the seven sacraments recognized by the Catholic Church since the earliest days of Christianity.  Christianity and the Catholic Church are both almost 2000 years old.   They are the same age because the Catholic Church is the Church that was the beginning of Christianity.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	The Emperor Constantine converted and made Christianity legal to practice.<br>  <br>  Eventually the Christian religion became the established Church of Rome.<br>  <br>  When the Empire fell, all that remained was the Church.|`|1cGlucXyaa	The early Christian Church was not Catholic.

d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	Christianity is the lie. Reincarnation is true. Jesus as an Essene Jew apparently taught the truth, but Christianity has very little to do with anything he taught. He spent three years teaching his truth, but all of it was edited down to a few short pages, a few moments of his ministry. And even those were distorted to fit with Roman and Greek mythology.<br>  <br>  It is possible to inherit tendencies and who knows what else from ancestors, however, if you attribute past-life memories to ancestral memories, logically such memories would be more vivid from recent ancestors, like your parents. In that case you should be born with memories of your parents' childhoods. That doesn't happen. So there might be inclinations and a smidgen of other intangibles we inherit from Mom and Dad, but reincarnation has the real answers.|`|AA11124121	genetic memory is not proven to exist ..|`|vTzxxSTLaa	Reincarnation  seems To make Sense but when i follow it through from generation to generation it looks like stagnation to me you are not going anywhere..|`|UqgCazhGaa	Changing Bodies<br>  Dr. Singh. People want more proof.<br>  Srila Prabhupada. What more is required? The eternality of the soul is a simple fact. I am an eternal soul. My body is changing, but I am not changing. For example, I am now an old man. Sometimes I think, "Oh, I used to jump and play, but now I cannot jump because my body has changed." I want to jump, but I cannot do it. That jumping propensity is eternal, but because of my old body I cannot do it.<br>  Dr. Singh. Opponents will say that according to their observation, the nature of consciousness is that it lasts for only one body.<br>  Srila Prabhupada. That is foolishness. In Bhagavad-gita (2.13) Krsna explains:<br>  <br>                       dehino 'smin yatha dehe<br>                        kaumaram yauvanam jara<br>                       tatha dehantara-praptir<br>                       dhiras tatra na muhyati<br>  <br>     "As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change." Just as this body is always changing (as I can see in my daily experience), there is a similar change at the time of death.<br>  Dr. Singh. But according to the scientists, we cannot actually observe this last change.<br>  Srila Prabhupada. Their eyes are so imperfect that they cannot observe many, many things. Their ignorance does not make the Bhagavad-gita unscientific. Why don't the scientists admit the imperfection of their senses? They must first admit the imperfection of their senses. Their seeing power does not determine what is and what is not science. Dogs cannot understand the laws of nature. Does that mean the laws of nature don't exist?<br>  Dr. Singh. Well, the scientists admit that argument, but they say the way to become perfect is through objective information and experience.<br>  Srila Prabhupada. No. That is not the way to become perfect. No one can become perfect through imperfect thinking, and our thinking must be imperfect because our senses and minds are imperfect.<br>  Dr. Singh. Srila Prabhupada, another question can be raised. is it not possible that the soul may accept three, four or five bodies and then die?<br>  Srila Prabhupada. You are accepting millions of bodies. I say that your body of yesterday is not your body of today. So, if you live for one hundred years, how many times have you changed bodies? Just calculate.<br>  Dr. Singh. Thirteen.<br>  Srila Prabhupada. Why thirteen?<br>  Dr. Singh. Medical science says that all the bodily cells are replaced every seven years.<br>  Srila Prabhupada. No, not every seven years--every second. Every second, the blood corpuscles are changing. Is it not so?<br>  Dr. Singh. Yes.<br>  Srila Prabhupada. And as soon as the blood corpuscles change, you change your body.<br>  Dr. Singh. In scientific terminology, can the eternality of the soul be compared to conservation of energy?<br>  Srila Prabhupada. There is no question of the conservation of energy, because energy is always existing.<br>  Dr. Singh. But according to scientific terminology, the law of conservation of energy is that energy cannot be created or destroyed, which means, I think, that it is eternal.<br>  Srila Prabhupada. Oh, yes, that we admit. Krsna is eternal; therefore all His energies are eternal.<br>  Dr. Singh. Is that why the living entity is also eternal?<br>  Srila Prabhupada. Yes. If the sun is eternal, its energies--heat and light--are also eternal.<br>  Dr. Singh. Does it follow from this, then, that life cannot be created or destroyed?<br>  Srila Prabhupada. Yes. Life is eternal. It is not created or destroyed. It is only temporarily covered. I am eternal, but last night I was covered by sleep, so I think in terms of yesterday and today. This is the condition of the material world.<br>  <br>  Bg 15.8 P         The Yoga of the Supreme Person<br>      At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat's or dog's body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly consciousness, he will be transferred to Krsnaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Krsna. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karsati or struggle for existence.<br>  <br>  SB 4.29.64 P Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi<br>     In dreams we sometimes see things that we have never experienced in the present body. Sometimes in dreams we think that we are flying in the sky, although we have no experience of flying. This means that once in a previous life, either as a demigod or astronaut, we flew in the sky. The impression is there in the stockpile of the mind, and it suddenly expresses itself. It is like fermentation taking place in the depths of water, which sometimes manifests itself in bubbles on the water's surface. Sometimes we dream of coming to a place we have never known or experienced in this lifetime, but this is proof that in a past life we experienced this. The impression is kept within the mind and sometimes becomes manifest either in dream or in thought. The conclusion is that the mind is the storehouse of various thoughts and experiences undergone during our past lives. Thus there is a chain of continuation from one life to another, from previous lives to this life, and from this life to future lives. This is also sometimes proved by saying that a man is a born poet, a born scientist or a born devotee.|`|1MGXHYq9aa	No it definitely does exist. I was once a Rockefeller.

gHSarVD1aa	This is a great question.<br>  <br>  Catholics are the original Christian fellowship. There were some things the Catholics were doing that many people disagreed with and still do today. So they split off from the Catholic church. These are your protestants. The Catholics see the world as Catholic / Protestant. <br>  They both believe the same fundamental things like 1. Jesus is GOD in the flesh. 2. Jesus is the way of salvation. The conflicts are over doctrines or rules that are specific to the Catholic church.<br>  <br>  Your Jewish Christians or "Completed Jews" also known as Messianic Christians are usually Jews who have accepted Jesus as the Messiah. There are also Christians who are drawn to the Jews because they are the elect or chosen of GOD. These Christians have never ceased to blow me away with their knowledge of the big picture and details about Jesus and his place in eternity. We all follow Jesus the best way we know how and rely on the Holy Spirit to guide us in our every day lives.<br>  <br>  There are however several fringe groups or "cults" as we Christians like to call them. There are quite a few of them.<br>  They are very easy to spot. They will have one of two traits or both.<br>  1. They say Jesus is not GOD in the flesh.<br>  2. Salvation involves the cross *AND* something else.<br>  <br>  I know this is kind of confusing, but it is the best I can do without writing a novel sized post.<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking.|`|7cLYgf2raa	Protestants mainly have the bible as their authority. Catholics have rituals and traditions as their authority. Jewish Cristians Have the added advantage of being in the vine, not grafted in.The Jewish Christian and the evangelical are the ones most related to each other. We both take the promises in both covenants to heart.|`|oH0u3RxJaa	Jews arent even christians....atleast the other groups dont htink so...<br>  <br>   Anyways...imagine a single book is rewritten using a person's memory over and over again with different people with each rewrite...eventually there are TONS of vastly different interpretations of that book...and fans of said books will only stand up for the one they read....and replace the word book with "bible", and fans with..."religious people who bothered reading the bible"|`|tPoZasqOaa	Jewish-Christianity tends to believe God is the controlling force behind everything and associate him with life and existence.  Rather then believing in a "duality".

Ask if all the proceeds could be donated to the charity.  That's a great way to maximize profits especially if they loose.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, ask a "local"  band to donate their time for the cause.  You could provide soda or desserts and charge again with all proceeds going to the cause.<br>  Good Luck!!!
rHqe7oMoaa	The Catholic church in Africa is actively opposing the use of condoms and other forms of contraception...hence MORE starving children for us to worry about. <br>  <br>  The genocide in Darfur is Muslim's killing Muslims over religious difference of opinion.|`|6jAVElX7aa	instead of throwing money after bad, someone could teach them how to grow food for their families, instead of jumping into bed with this one or that one, so less diseases and more having love of their families.|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Why aren't you in Darfur doing your part?|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	The truth matters too. That's great that people want to help starving people. What we do to give is done in secret.But we also want to share the word, because there always will be starving people, but eternity goes on for ever and ever. So giving the good news of Jesus to people can save them from eternal hell. Giving to the poor is better, but both are valid, and obviously there are those that use this argument as a tool to try to silence the truth. So are you suppressing the truth?|`|MiulNPYNaa	Because everyone is in it for themselves.|`|JqfIJtvYaa	Right on!|`|0PvpGjSqaa	i bet you could do it too if you just stopped posting stupid rants like this.|`|4apYtDp7aa	cant, since no one is willing to begin, then no one is willing to do it. The trick is, since we(the world) dont trust each other and to say something like "stop, get over it! let's work together!" is the same thing as saying "ok i give up, now stop playing games with me!" none of us (i mean the world) will be willing to start, and since no one starts...then it's not going to end (haha irony lol)<br>  <br>  i thought of that too when i was like 6th - 7th grade but unfortunately that belief doesnt work in the real world, sorry :(|`|BbK0fA4Laa	African kids?

I certainly have enough time in the day to give attention to a lot of things: my work, my family, my blog, my reading, my hobbies...what makes you think that this is all people do all day?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should focus on the religious people in this regard, since they are the ones prone to tithing, so part of their income goes to support clergy, when they could just as easily read their holy books for themselves and follow their own interpretations of their scriptures.  They could even keep the clergy and get rid of all of the buildings, using each other's property to fellowship, then send all of the money to aid organizations in Africa.  Fifty-five billion dollars goes to churches every year in the United States alone.<br>  <br>  I have known Atheists who have been involved in Doctors Without Borders; who have researched the diseases that kill African children every day; who go out in the middle of winter, handing out twenty dollar bills to homeless people--just because it's not organized doesn't mean it's not happening.  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that Christians don't give money to charitable causes, but I am saying that there are is a whole lot of waste on that side of the debate.  Reference the billboards, the proselytization literature, the megachurches...the list goes on.|`|IgHUhZs8aa	People are already doing **** about those starving kids in Africa, and instead of offering to help out with charities like the Heifer Project you chose to focus on retarded ****  like people who argue over **** with no specific point in mind.|`|iJdp9HDDaa	If everyone in the world became Atheist, you would see MANY problems of the world would be erased.

qEdhPD8Laa	1. I've had experiences that could be signs of being a psi-vampire since I was a teenager (1980), but I didn't accept that I'm vampiric until 2 years ago.<br>  <br>  2. I had dreams telling me I was one, reactions consistent with being one, a couple psychics and a couple vampires told me I was one too.<br>  <br>  3. I don't have a routine. I usually psi-feed unconsciously or subconsciously. When I feel like my energy level is low, I go out where I can be around other people.<br>  <br>  4. I had many signs over many years, too many to list here. Email me if you want more details.<br>  <br>  5. I saw a little of the original Dark Shadows when I was a pre-schooler. In grade school I read Camella, Hotel Transylvania, and Interview with the Vampire. In high school I read Dracula, The Dracula Tapes, and a bunch of other vampire fiction. I watched Dracula (with Frank Langella), The Hunger, Lost Boys, and most vampire movies that weren't too grusome. I read Vampires Among Us, American Vampires, some non-fiction book based largely on Montague Summers' folklore research. After dreaming about vampires when I was a teenager, I read and watched alot of vampire fiction and what little non-fiction I could find.<br>  <br>  I loved Buffy and Angel, but when I first saw Buffy, I was an adult and was a little hesitant to get hooked on it. I first watched Buffy at my BF's house and told him later that when I watch or read too much vampire fiction I can get weird "psychosomatic reactions" that make me feel like I'm a vampire. When this had happened previously, I'd been working nights and watching Forever Knight like an addict. I worried that if I got hooked on Buffy, I'd do that again, but I didn't.<br>  <br>  "The Gentlemen" was one of the best episodes. I think it got an Emmy nomination. It didn't creep  me out too much, because I was in my 30's when I saw it.<br>  <br>  - P.|`|yCTxg4t5aa	1: About a year ago<br>  2: I came to my own conclusions after discovering that my, (i don't want to say 'Symptoms' but i don't know what else would do) matched those described by other members of the community.<br>  3: I'm a psi vampire, so i feed on peoples subtle body (aura) energy. I make it a point to feed ambiently from large groups of people so i don't cause any damage, and i don't like feeding directly from someone unless i have their permission.<br>  4: See answer 2.<br>  5: I enjoyed watching Buffy very much, awsome show. I was home alone when The Gentlemen episode first aired, scared the Absolute bajeezas out of me, i purposely pushed my bed well away from the window that night lol. I enjoy reading werewolf books better than vampire ones, like Moon Called. I've read Twilight, and the best character out of that was Jacob, the whole Edward Bella thing annoyed the hell out of me. I only started reading things like "The Psychic Vampire Codex" and "Vampires in their own words" by Michelle Belanger early last year, and i found that i already instinctively knew most of it.|`|jLL7sDILaa	1: About 2 or three years ago.<br>  2: It was slow. I worked with energy as a child without knowing what it was. When I got older, I studied energy more and realized that I'd been taking it from others. Tried not to and got freezing and jittery and anxious.<br>  3: I don't need much energy, but I need it every day or so. I just skim some off of ambient energy at uni.<br>  4: See number 2.<br>  5: I watched Buffy, yes. But I was old enough when I saw "The Gentlemen" to not be totally freaked out; it was very weird, though. Since then, I've read numerous vampire fiction books (no Anne Rice, though) and a couple books by Michelle Belanger.|`|anfhcnWeaa	1.about a year and a half ago.<br>  2.all my symptoms matched up with those of the others out there.<br>  3.I'm a psi vamp but i don't like feeding on other people so i guess you might be able to call me a vegan vamp i feed on plants/trees and other forms of nature such as Storms.of course i'm joking about the vegan thing but not about the feeding on nature.<br>  4.isn't this question pretty much the same as the 2nd one.<br>  5.i did see the night flier once when i was younger but i never really watched buffy i do watch angel reruns if i can stay awake till after they come on.|`|WjSJBWl7aa	If vampires did in fact exist, why would they be on yahoo answers? Seriously..<br>  <br>  I do have a friend who says he's a vampire. He's even bitten me. But I don't run around nibbling on people so Im'a assume it aint true :P<br>  <br>  I never watched Buffy.. I feel like I missed out of an important childhood experience.. :(|`|UyDkYaXuaa	*Karate chops all the other answerers* <br>  <br>  FAIL! Now, here's a REAL answer. <br>  <br>  1: When did you find out you were a vampire? I had symtoms since like forever ago, (a few years) but didn't really consider it vampirism until I looked more into it. <br>  2: How did you find out? I confirmed (or rather accepted it) it when I realized my symptoms were the same and that the reason I have a spiritual connection to other's pranic energy was due to it.  <br>  3: What is your feeding routine? Psychic, though I suck at it. (NO pun intended) I do better feeding through blood, but I can't get normal donors. Most are either creepy, obsessive, or have a disease. <br>  4: How did you know that you were a vampire? (Didn't you ask this? O_o) Uhm, confirmed it by not "leeching" (Feeding psychically when unsure) off others for a while. Not the best idea. I felt like my organs were digesting themselves <br>  5: Did you ever see/read/watch vampiric texts prior to your awakening? Which ones? You did watch Buffy, right? I loved Buffy. Did you see the episode with "The Gentlemen"? How much did that creep you out as a kid? I couldn't sleep for a week and I kept whispering to myself just to make sure my voice hadn't been stolen. <br>  <br>  Okay first of all, Buffy bored me. Sorry. Interview with a Vampire (Or any Vampire Movie) is not realistic but I loved it because of the intense emotion and passion. I cried so hard, though most people saw it as child molestation (Louis and Claudia) <br>  <br>  You may want to read up on vampirism. It mostly has to do with a pranic energy disorder.|`|sKwQiAK6aa	I found out I was a vampire about two and a half years ago.  I just kind of found out, there wasn't any thing that happened, it just happened over time, it's hard to explain.  I don't really have any feeding routine, I don't really 'feed' at all, which sucks.  The fourth question kind of ties into the second one.  I watched a few vampire shows or movies, but parts of them and I knew they were crap.  If you have any other questions just e-mail me.|`|nP78rt6Saa	1. There is no such thing as vampires.<br>  2.People make that stuff up to feel special and because they are confusing fiction with reality.<br>  3. just... no.<br>  4. They don't exist. <br>  5. Of course you do. And that's why you're asking this question. "I couldn't sleep for a week and I kept whispering to myself just to make sure my voice hadn't been stolen." Which shows that you already have a problem confusing fantasy with reality, so it's understandable.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to sound mean, especially because you're probably twelve [as are most Buffy fans]. But vampires aren't real and anyone who claims they are either have mental illnesses or are just stupid.|`|GrsBTetbaa	Yes, I am a Vampire.<br>  1. I found out when I looked in the mirror and saw fangs.<br>  2. My "Father" Raphael told me what had happened.<br>  3. I feed 2-3 times a week, just small children, maybe a teen or two.<br>  4. Bloodlust.<br>  5. I read the twilight books, but didn't believe them. They are eerily similar to the life of a real vampire.|`|AdQfM1yvaa	1: i found out when my unicorn tried to kill me<br>  2: when my unicorn also tried to trample me<br>  3: when my unicorn tries to rip my hair out with its teeth<br>  4: i knew when my unicorn tried to once again kill me<br>  5: yes--yes i have i couldnt sleep and then my unicorn went crazy|`|BQAP3LM5aa	1.3 months ago<br>  2.my buddy 'came out' and I looked into it<br>  3.I feed every morning on my morning walk.<br>  4.once my buddy came out I looked to vampire sites I thought he was joking. I noticed I had almost all the same symptoms other psi vamps had.<br>  5. Twilight, I must admit. This led me to believe he must be kidding! And I also saw van helsing, I am legend and, interview with a vampire. Dracula, and as a little kiddie, the little vampire(Disney)(I know)|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	I am not a vampire but my horse is, but he can not type,( Its a hoof thing) so he can not answer your questions. But it is a real pain for me because now I can only go riding at night.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	I like vampire movies.  Just rewatched the lost boys excellent 80s vamp movie.|`|FHdF0ZJLaa	As a Y!A vampire, I can answer your questions.<br>  <br>  1: When did you find out you were a vampire?<br>  ~ After my friend introduced me to Y!A about a year ago.<br>  <br>  2: How did you find out?<br>  ~ I sort of gradually accepted it when my vampiric habits began to be evident. The sleeping schedule was a dead givaway (forgive the pun). Late night browsing sessions began to interfere with my normal daily life and I saw less and less daylight. And liked it that way.<br>  <br>  3: What is your feeding routine?<br>  ~ I feed just about every night on questions from the B&A section, the W&W section and sometimes even the Polls section. I occasionally supplement my diet with lighter fare, by dipping into the D&R section, but that makes me sick rather quickly if I have too much.<br>  <br>  4: How did you know that you were a vampire?<br>  ~ Well, all the symptoms fit. Preferring night to day, feeding off the lives of others, burning quickly in the sun, and I have no reflection in my computer monitor (though that could have something to do with it needing to be cleaned...).<br>  <br>  <br>  5: Did you ever see/read/watch vampiric texts prior to your awakening? Which ones? You did watch Buffy, right? I loved Buffy. Did you see the episode with "The Gentlemen"? How much did that creep you out as a kid? I couldn't sleep for a week and I kept whispering to myself just to make sure my voice hadn't been stolen.<br>  ~ Oh yes, Buffy is a guilty pleasure as is Angel. I'm not scared of The Gentlemen.... they're far too quiet to be here on Y!A.
T3Tpgz5Vaa	Obviously you aren't Polish, otherwise the answer would be common knowledge, you are slavic (polish ancestry) and from another country,<br>  <br>   (sorry I just have to clarify) and no kissing isn't taboo in the polish bible, some polish greetings involve kissing each other on the cheek (reserved for close friends and family), and old fashion gentlemen are suppose to kiss the hand of ladies as a greeting (not done all that much anymore).<br>  <br>  Open discussions of sex and relationships are not always welcomed for common talk, and over sensational kissing might cause a stir, and sex before marrige is definately a taboo.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	Book/chapter/verse?  POLISH BIBLIA? You mean the Bible that is written in POLISH?  If so, then there's nothing in ANY language the Bible is published in saying kissing is a sin.  ?mieszne.<br>  HAHAHAHAHOHOHOHOHOHAHAHA<br>  Ty g?upca !
JWjq5iaXaa	You know what would be cooler? You shutting your mouth! <br>  <br>  nah, totally kidding. <br>  <br>  What I meant to say, was a virtual reality where you were thrown into a zombie apocalypse, and you had to try to survive. If you got bit, it wouldn't hurt, but the area would start to vibrate, almost like a stinging sensation without the pain... eventually, the vibration would get stronger and stronger, and you'd get sick of it and start over again.... <br>  <br>  Or, once the zombies pinned you down for 20 seconds, the virtual reality stopped and you had to start over again.<br>  <br>  Does anybody else agree this is a kickass idea?|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Nothing better than slaying some Nazi Zombies......COD5|`|HbQmDGb6aa	nah... i don't really think so
zmpk29BLaa	I understand what you mean, as someone who used to work in customer service.<br>  <br>  Yes, it was inconsiderate of her to do that during a busy time in an upsale store.. it's cute that she's trying to teach her children, but she could have found an empty Walgreens or something, you know? At least that's how I feel.<br>  <br>  It's not polite to the irritated customers waiting (espchally since YOU are the one who will have to deal with them!) so that woman really should've thought more about others.|`|M627my7Baa	You're being too critical. You're at work, and your job is to be a cashier, working the register for everyone, kids included. You sell everything in the store, candy included.  It doesn't matter if you felt you looked slow and inefficient, when you're at work it's not about YOU, it's about the customers who keep the place open and keep you employed. Thirty seconds times 4 is 2 minutes of your time, and you probably have an 8 hr shift so the woman was fine.|`|loqsl5xXaa	no.. she is a customer. If her kids were running around making noise and going crazy i would say something and the other people would have a right to say something. <br>  <br>  She was trying to teach her kids responsibility and money. I think that is a good thing and she shouldn't be looked at as being a rude inconsiderate customer. I mean yes, she may have picked a bad time, but it may only be the time she had. Every one has a reason to do whatever. Besides with every one out of work it's not like they really had some where to go, lol (don't take that to serious).|`|0d4X54rMaa	i'm happy when parents are teaching the children <br>  it would have taken alot longer if they would have stollen something in your line instead<br>  it's always Morphy's law that i stand in the shortest line and wait the longest lol|`|lKsgF8bOaa	She has every right to make to let each and every daughter of hers to purchase on their own. Your job is to ring up the bill and that's all. I don't think it's rude. I think you're just lazy or not happy with your job.|`|vxeMZXrgaa	~she could have taught her children somewhere else besides a store like the one you work in. However, maybe she did not understand she was being a bother. Probably never worked in a store and had to deal with people waiting in line~|`|18RphOP6aa	It wasn't rude at all...she was teaching her daughters how to deal in real life.|`|I81cNyaKaa	Meep?|`|79632f5cafa59cc02272fe8777999b37aa	you are completely in the right. Thats fine she wants to educate her children but why should all those people have to wait while she does. And is it your job to educate her kids? I don't think so.<br>  I agree with you she could have taken the kids to a grocery store when it was quiet and it would have been more considerate and probably a better experience for the kids too. I wonder if they noticed all the people in line behind them. Sure teach your kids but teach them about consideration too.<br>  have a groovy day! :]|`|oEye7w8Maa	I totally agree with you. A mother knows what it is like to get her young child to make a decision ...it is never quick...its sounds like that women thought she was entitled to that and didn't give a dam about anyone else or you for that fact...you are not being critical at all ...that woman is oblivious to the running of a business. YES IT IS VERY RUDE|`|JUR1Wvzvaa	honestly,u're just too critical. customer service should be handle in a manners of no matter how upset you are with the customer, u should just smile.people will respect you more,i mean other customers after seeing u smile,they wont feel bad as u know smile is infectious and smiling makes u feel good.|`|AA11452160	Maybe she was teaching them patience too.|`|NpaXahtraa	She want to teach her children, so let her.<br>  It's America!|`|HAmtRpGJaa	Lighten up. Its not really a big deal.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	1) Relax<br>  <br>  2) The other irritated customers are the problem. Not the mother that took the time to try to do something interesting for her daughters. Maybe there was another lesson involved, such as the value of money.<br>  <br>  If anything, the other irritated customers were acting like children that don't get their way. <br>  <br>  Why let their immature attitude get to you?<br>  <br>  I admit that there times I get like that, but when I think back, I realize how stupid it was for me to get that way. <br>  <br>  That's why I have a book with me no matter where I go. Especially when I go the bank. <br>  <br>  I can see the irritation on the other people's faces and I just quietly laugh.<br>  <br>  These people know the routine but still get upset and do nothing to change it and instead expect and/or demand that everything be done for their convenience.|`|OAlw9RjVaa	Do you work at Sams/Cosco? lol|`|rJJhMQ37aa	The mother just wasn't thinking about the extra time you needed.<br>  <br>  Why on earth do you need to look up the name times 4, for a simple candy purchase?  That makes absolutely no sense at all.  Even so, it was 30 seconds, times 4.  That means it was only 2 minutes.  How much of a backup in the line could there possibly be in 2 minutes time?<br>  <br>  Lighten up.  I am sure the other customers got over it.|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	3 kids under 5 and you are the one to be considered.  i can't believe it.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	The answer is - yes this mother was rude, AND you are being too critical.<br>  <br>  This particular customer should have the courtesy and the common sense to realize that when there is a long, impatient line behind her, it is not the time to let each of her preschoolers buy a piece of candy for learning-time.<br>  <br>  However, as the cashier, you have little choice but to just go along with it and stay happy.<br>  <br>  There is something I've noticed about customer service jobs. When you have a negative 'vibe' between you and your customer, other customers who are watching will pick up on that and they will become bristly. If you are happy to take care of this customer's needs, without becoming irritated because she's wasting your time, the other customers will pick up the vibe that you are here with them, not against them. They will all be happier.<br>  <br>  so, don't focus on how you would like each transaction to go. Let each transaction be an opportunity to impress your customer with your superior service.|`|pvabglXhaa	I totally agree with you.  She shouldn't have come in at a busy time to teach her kids how to shop.<br>  <br>  But....how often do you get considerate customers through your register?  <br>  <br>  Even though you have a very valid point and if I was you I would be totally cheesed off too, you have to remember one thing......<br>  <br>  The customer is always right!<br>  <br>  Isn't that the very first thing they taught you there?<br>  <br>  So, no matter how much we loathe them, we can't do anything about them.<br>  <br>  Keep a smile on your face and don't let rude people like this spoil your day.  She ain't worth it.
muHctmaGaa	Well, most bisexual characters on television are mislabeled as gay or straight. Jenny on the L Word was intended to be bi but hasn't dated another man. Marissa on the O.C. had a fling with a girl but never looked at the same sex again. It's a subjective thing. Often shows will have the newly out lesbian panic and kiss or sleep with a man before settling with her girlfriend, like what happens on a lot of soap operas, but I don't know about the after-experiment. I have heard that the lesbian (not the "bi" blonde from the Portia di Rossi fling) on Nip/Tuck slept with one of the main characters and is questioning herself. Don't know if the writers intend to make her bi or not.|`|Bulnsvptaa	i donno but thak you sooo much for the butch porn ;)|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	"a different story" an old movie|`|VYd5TVpqaa	You should be asking your little friend for examples.
QyAyQf3Laa	This should sum it up:<br>  <br>  ATHEISTS, BULLIES, NON-BELIEVERS and RIDICULERS<br>  ------------------------<br>  Never be bullied nor ever feel inferior to an atheist. Try to always put Jehovah God first in whatever you do in life and that includes being in the face of those who hate him and his son. <br>  <br>  They should not scare you and you do not have to go down to their level. You can smile when they behave this way because you know what God's word, the Bible says about ridiculers:<br>  <br>  Ridiculers are, in general, detestable to others. (Proverbs 24:9) If such do not accept reproof, they will experience disaster. (Proverbs 1:22-27) And how despicable are those who deride the poor, or their own parents. (Proverbs 17:5; 30:17) Ridiculers often refuse to listen to rebuke (Proverbs 13:1) and do not love those reproving them. (Proverbs 9:7, 8; 15:12) Nevertheless, they should be disciplined for the benefit of others. (Proverbs 9:12; 19:25, 29; 21:11) Instead of keeping company with such unholy ones, it is better to drive them away; much happier are those who refuse to sit with ungodly ridiculers. (Psalms 1:1; Proverbs 22:10)<br>  <br>  “For you know this first, that in the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires.” (2 Peter 3:3) Jude says that the desires of these ridiculers are “for ungodly things.” He calls them “animalistic men, not having spirituality.” (Jude 17-19)<br>  <br>  You can and should rejoice in the face of ridiculers because you know you are doing God's will and it was prophecied that these lowly ones would come out of the smallest of rocks to try to offend Jehovah and you, yet you stand strong. Rejoice in the face of ridiculers, and leave them alone.<br>  <br>  They are not worth your time. <br>  <br>  Find the lost sheep who want to be found and draw close to Jehovah God. Share the good news of the kingdom with the good and righteous-hearted ones. Don't waste time on hatemongers and wicked ones who do not want to be helped.<br>  -------------------|`|iyweojLoaa	arrogance<br>  <br>  why can't people just believe or not believe what they believe or choose not to believe in privacy..not worry about other people's faiths..and not get so offended just because what they think is 'threatened'..oh but that's just the way humans are i guess..<br>  <br>  also, the people who automatically say that you think they're being rude because your beliefs are being questioned don't know for sure what the person said to you, so they're assuming..and also, a lot of them do talk with this sort of non making sense, rude sarcasm|`|rGEZup0Zaa	They only sound rude because you aren't used to having your beliefs questioned.<br>  <br>  Those Christians who are know the difference between personal attacks and criticizing the beliefs they hold.|`|Johiu2cwaa	Probably because you do not like hearing the truth,|`|AA11466759	Some people have no manners, and the anonymity afforded by this means of communication allows it.<br>  <br>  *note also that typing words does not often convey a true connotation, since very often facial expression or voice tone gives us a clue as to how the person is conveying their idea.<br>  <br>  However, many people here who have insulted you (or anyone else for that matter) would not do this in RL if they were posed these questions.|`|phH2dVYZaa	They are rude.

Therefore, you will run into all types. But you may run into some that are angry.

43s63XTEaa	I know I'm going to be given a thumbs-down for this, but it's worth it...<br>  (warning: kind of long)<br>  <br>  The "little red man" was an Angel of God's in Heaven. One day, Lucifer decided he wanted to be God, so he tried to take over Heaven. God got angry, and made a place called Hell and summoned Lucifer there for all eternity.<br>  <br>  Then, after the earth was created blah blah blah, Adam was created from the dirt. God then put Adam to sleep and took one of his ribs and created Eve. A female companion for Adam so they could breed.<br>  <br>  Well, Lucifer disguised himself as a snake, and convinced Eve to eat from the tree God told them not to eat from. Eve ate from the tree, and convinced Adam too as well.<br>  <br>  Now, if just Eve ate the apple, mankind wouldn't be born in sin. But nooo, she just HAD to have Adam try some too. Then, his sin was now in his, ahem, "love nectar".<br>  <br>  Think about it: When you bake a cake and the cake pan has a dent in it; the cake will have a dent as well. Basically...<br>  <br>  Eve = oven<br>  Adam = Cake Pan<br>  Cake = Us.<br>  <br>  So now, we are all born in sin. <br>  <br>  Cue Jesus, who was God's only begotten son, who died for our sins on the cross. This, was necessary for salvation. A perfect man died for our sins. <br>  <br>  The world is a place where you're either following Lucifer or God. It's like teams. Your entire life, you're on one side or the other. Kind of like envisioning you're on one road or the other. One road will lead you one place (Heaven), and the other road will lead you another place (Hell); where you wind up is not up to anyone on this earth; it's up to God.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Everyone screws up at some point. That's human nature. We always do something we know (or don't know) we're not supposed to do. I know how cheesy this sounds, but if you ask for forgiveness, your slate will be wiped clean. There's just one catch; you've got to mean it with all your heart.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would also like to thank you for being open-minded. Not everyone is as open as you (Christians and Atheists alike!)|`|k7973dtIaa	To answer the question with a question:<br>  <br>  A murderer was caught in the act of murdering a person and was arrested and thrown in jail. There is no question of his guilt, he was caught in the act.

For any who say to another that you will go to hell will be judge of that him self. For the lord teaches us to not judge for what ye judge ye to shell be judge of .funny that people do not learn this lesion. It is because of there pride and there pride will have them cast into the pit of hell. Hell is a place that people go who hurt others. The pain they cause to another will be the pain that they will feel for all eternity. This is what hell is and there is no end . For there shell be gnashing of teeth and wailing and no end to there torment this is what hell is (fire and brimstone ) means . God is an all loving God but he gets angered with the wicked that destroys the heart of his children God love those that love him and keep his commandments more then they that choose to do evil. But thru repentance he fore gives them if they ask with real intent for forgiveness and do it no more meaning doing evil.. Do you truly think that god does not work . What do you think he does in heaven sit around and do nothing. He created a whole universe that he must take care of including our world .He answer prayers he appoints angles to watch over us etc…God is a very busy being making sure all is done right. The lord is my life and I am grateful to know him and love him with all of my heart might and mind. For how is some one to know some one unless they build up a relationship with him. It is the same with God and Jesus Christ. Get to know them and ye will see what they will do for you it will amaze you .for I have been so blessed in my life that It is impossible for me to deny him and his love .For his love for me is so great. God lives and love you pray unto him get to know him read scriptures and learn of him and follow the example of Jesus Christ and keep his commandments and you will see for your self that these words are true.Amen|`|ZKQgAtBsaa	God does not put you in Hell to punish you.  I will explain:<br>  <br>  Well, when God created the Garden of Eden, he put the tree of knowledge there.  'Why did he put that tree there?', you may ask, probably wondering why he would even create the opportunity to allow us to sin.  Well, that tree was put there, because when he created us, he didn't want to create a bunch of robots to do whatever he wanted... God gave us a choice.  We were given the option of going against Him or following Him.  He didn't want to force us to love Him.  He wanted to us to love Him because we really felt love for Him.  <br>  <br>  Well, God won't force you to be with Him.  If you chose not to follow Him, he won't make you be in His presence.  At death, when you chose not to follow Him, you will be completley separated from him.  Which puts you in Hell.|`|hms0bSiaaa	Yes, punishment in hell is real and God is not using this to blackmail, to sow terror or fear among unbelievers.  He cannot lie and that is one thing He cannot do.  Yes,  He is a loving God, in fact, He is called the perfect Love.  He is also a God of perfect justice, in fact, He is the righteous holy Judge. He is so Holy that He would not compromise with sin.  We all are sinners from the beginning and we are all qualifiers for hell. That means, that because of our "unpardonable state" we are all bound for punishment in hell.  But because God is a loving God, He is not willing that human be separated with Him. He made a provision for this sin debt problem of ours.  Lord Jesus chose to die on the Cross to pay for our sins so that we may escape the condemnation.<br>  <br>  John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only begotten Son and whosoever believes on Him shall not perish but have everlasting and eternal life."<br>  <br>  Would you like to have eternal life?  Have you accepted Jesus?<br>  <br>  John 1:12 says, "Yet to all who received him, to those who believe in his name, he gave the right to become children of God."<br>  <br>  Then pray this prayer: "Lord I know I am a sinner. I believe Your Son, Jesus Christ, died on the Cross for my sins.  Please forgive me of my sins and make me a new person. I commit my life to You today. Amen"|`|jcZnIR1Zaa	Please allow me to correct a few misconceptions.   <br>  <br>  God created humans in perfection, and gave us a mind of our own.   For a while, humans coexisted with God in harmony.    <br>  <br>  Satan, who is actually a deposed angel, interfered with the harmony between God and humans.   Due to this deception, humans chose to disobey God, and do what they thought rather than what God said.   <br>  <br>  Now, we humans are working to reconcile with God.   <br>  <br>  Of course, this was the plan from the beginning.   God wanted us to CHOOSE to be with Him, not to be forced to do so, or led in ignorance to do so.  In order for us to be able to choose, we had to suffer this current separation from God first. <br>  <br>  You are correct when you say that God is all loving.    <br>  <br>  "Hell" is a concept, not a place.  In reality, we humans get to choose our fate.   God has extended an invitation or all of us.   That invitation is to once again coexist with God in a place we refer to as Heaven.  We are free to accept or deny that inviation.     <br>  <br>  To accept, we must show God that we are serious.  God has already stated that He will not tolerate sin, which is anything that God finds annoying.   Heaven is God's home, and He can set whatever rules He wants.   <br>  <br>  So, we must be free of sin to live in God's home.   But, we are sinful creatures, and being sin-free is just not something we can really do.   But, knowing this, God set up a plan so anyone who seriously wants to can be welcome.   <br>  <br>  Jesus, God's Son, was granted a human body so He could experience what we experience.   Being part of God, Jesus was actually able to live a sin-free life in a human form.   Jesus becomes our example of how to overcome sin.  Then, Jesus, the first and only sin-free human, offered Himself as the final sacrifice to cover all sin, past, present, and future.   <br>  <br>  With that, God said that anyone who pledges himself to Jesus will be welcome in Heaven.   God will ignore any past sins of thosefolks, and see them as they would be if they had never sinned.    That is calle Grace.   <br>  <br>  There is a prescribed series of things one must do to pledge oneself to Jesus, but by accomplishing them, you are found to be acceptable to God, or "saved".   Once saved, your goal is to live your life as sin-free as possible.   Of course, we will sin again, but the state of being saved gives us the right to redeem ourselves by apologizing to God, and starting again to live sin-free.    <br>  <br>  Some sins irritate not only God, but humans as well.   Humans may issue punishments, up to and including bodily death.   God did not say that humans would be nearly as forgiving as He is.   <br>  <br>  Now, as you live your life, saved or not, eventually your body will fail, and your living soul will separate from the physical body that has died.  At that point, that soul must appear before God.   <br>  <br>  You and God then pretty much review the life you led on this Earth.  This review will show you the whole truth of every decision you made.   All the consequences, good and bad, will be revealed to you, and you will feel what you caused others to feel.   (I already know that there will be a few things in my own life that I will not enjoy reviewing.) <br>  <br>  At the end of the review, I imagine God asking you, "So, what do you have to say for yourself?" And what can you say?   You have just been shown the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth of your life.   And all the sin in your life will be right there for everyone to see.    <br>  <br>  But, if you were saved, Jesus will step up and remind God, "This is one of mine....."   Then God will erase the sins, and welcome you into his home.   <br>  <br>  If you are not saved, however, you will be shown the exit door.  Exit to where, you might ask.   Well, we don't really know, but whereever it is, God will not be there.   When the time comes, and all who have lived have been sorted out, God will close that door one final time, and even His influence will be shut off from that other place.    <br>  <br>  Without the loving influence of God, that other place can only be imagined as rather uncomfortable.   Hell, in fact.     A place where the residents do not subscribe to God or His rules.   A place where folks do as they please, regardless of who is hurt in the process, with no repercussions.   A place of complete selfcenteredness and greed running rampant.    <br>  <br>  I don't want to be in a place like that.   I would much rather do as God asks me to do, and then live with Him for my eternity.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	First of all, Utah is the wrong place to learn about God. Mormons are not Christians by definitions of their doctrines. We do not accept them as such because of heresies within the Church and the Church's denial of the Essential Doctrines of Christianity. (I am not being mean, or judging anyone. They are great people with good morals, I am simply stating a fact).<br>  <br>  One of the most overstated questions in the world is, IF there is a loving God why does he send people to hell? <br>  The deal with Hell, (as it IS mentioned in the Bible, and Jesus himself spoke about it ... so for any Christian to claim that he did not is calling Christ a liar, and if he is a liar then he saved no one) is that it a punishment for sin. Hell is a place that, according to Scripture (the Bible) was originally designed for the Devil and his angels. It is a place of outer darkness, of exile and torment away from the presence of God. It is the penalty for transgression against the Laws of God. Mankind, through his own willful act of disobedience came under the same penalty as Satan (the devil) because he transgressed against the Laws of God. (The whole "Adam & Eve & the Garden of Eden" Story). Therefore Satan’s punishment (of “eternal torment”) became mans punishment also. “Sin” is disobedience. It is a transgression of the Law. When the Law is broken a penalty or punishment must be enforced in order that the integrity of the Law be maintained, and order restored.  If there was never any consequence for wrongdoing, the Law would not be taken seriously, Justice not upheld and all would be chaos.<br>  If your parents say “Don’t do that” and you do it, you have disobeyed their Law (or Rule) therefore they administer a punishment as a consequence for your disobedience. In doing so they exercise authority over you (which you learn to respect insofar as to state, you recognize their position governing over you.) It is also how they maintain order. If you do not respect their authority all in the home will be chaos. It is also how you learn values, good from evil. The next time your parents say “Don’t do that” you will think twice as you remember that there was a consequence when you last disobeyed. They discipline because they love you. (Discipline is not Abuse however. I want to state that because some people have lousy parents lol). <br>  In any case, Our Penal and Judicial System works this way also. There are Set Laws that govern the land. These Laws are for our benefit not our harm. In obeying the Law we are free to live in a peaceable society. IF the Laws are broken, then consequence comes into effect. There is punishment for a transgression of the Law. As the Law must be upheld. Violate the Law and Go to Jail. It is no different in Eternity.<br>  <br>  The penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23). When Man sinned and willfully violated God’s Law he brought upon himself a consequence. That consequence was death (and eternal separation from God). Remember “Hell” was not originally created for man, but for the devil and his angels. God is Holy and cannot look upon sin. Therefore he Judges it demanding that a satisfaction of the Law be expiated in order to uphold it. If God did not judge sin, and assign a penalty for that he could not be called “Just” And no one would take him seriously. <br>  Before Mankind sinned, God said “Don’t do this OR…” (Gen 2:17). Therefore he stated the rule, and the punishment (“you shall surely die”) and let it alone. He left the choice up to man. Through Pride, man chose to willfully disobey the rule, therefore God pronounced the judgment – He kept his word, and mankind fell into a state of sin. <br>  Since God is Holy and He can not look upon sin, there had to be an atonement made for those sins.Since man sinned in a mortal body, the atonement had to be FROM and OF a mortal body. The Hebrews used to sacrifice animals as a means of providing personal and corporate attrition for one year. God’s Law states, Eye for an Eye, Life for a Life. This is how the Law was upheld and how man was restored into a right standing with God. The Law also required that everything be cleansed with blood because the life of every creature is in the blood. (Lev 17:11) And without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. (Hebrews 9:22) So to make atonement for ones sins he had to exchange an innocent life for his own. (Understand?).?<br>  <br>  I do not have the space to get into this fully, BUT basically Christ was God’s pronouncement of Grace against the spoken judgment (of death and hell) though it still stood.  Jesus was the Eternal God incarnate. (i.e, God in bodily form). That is what Messiah (Christ) Is and was to be.<br>  Only God can forgive sins because only God is Holy. Because of the stipulations of His Laws which required the shedding of blood and a life for a life in order to provide atonement for sins, On Calvary God Himself exchanged a “Life for a Life” and “Shed blood” to appease the requirements of His own Law that demanded it. It was an act of Grace because no longer was there condemnation and judgment that came with the Law. Man was then freed of the pronouncement of the death sentence (of Hell) because Christ provided the permanent atonement.  Christ’s death was what provided atonement. His Resurrection is what provided Eternal Life (Heaven). <br>  God’s Laws still stand, but unless a person has made atonement for his own sins, the pronouncement of death (and Hell) is still standing, because no one who is sinful can stand in the presence of a Holy God. Death and Hell are the consequence for disobedience. This is His Rule. Therefore, those who reject Christ are rejecting the Grace of God and do not have their sins expiated therefore they are still under the Death Penalty pronounced against them for their sins. (Understand?)<br>  It isn’t that a loving God would not send people to such a place, as He surely provided a way out; It’s that the Rules Stand in order to Uphold God’s sense of Justice. God says, Obey = Reward, Disobey = Consequence. Obey = Life (Heaven) Disobey = Death (Hell). He does not force anyone to do anything, just like in Eden He States the Rules and the Consequences plainly, and allows us to choose what we want to do.  God is Loving, (John 3:16) that is why took upon himself our punishment, so that we could be restored to proper standing with Him and would not have to go to such a horrible place that was never created for us to start off with.<br>  Hope this helps. I’m out of space or I would write more! xoxo ? Christian A/G.<br>  <br>  *EDIT* The 1st answerer (Stax) is a Jehovah's Witness, not a Christian. I can tell by his improper usage of the Greek term Gehenna. (and Sheol, which is Hebrew).<br>  "Hades" is the Greek word for Hell. Hades is also the name of the god of the Underworld and the Dead in Greek Mythology. Certain verses about Hades were paralleled intentionally to the Greeks concepts of the afterlife. Therefore symbolism was used to convey the message of eternal seperation from God. (i.e, Hell).<br>  "Hell" as a place is not like the Inferno describe by Dante. Neither is it like any mythological place descriptive of the afterlife in early cultures. It is called a place of outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. (Matt 8:12, 22:13,25:30). This too was symbolic, intentionally.<br>   Jesus said, "Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell." (Mat 10:28) Jesus spoke more on hell than he did on heaven. Stax: is Christ confused then? Or is He a liar? If He is either, than He is not Messiah and has saved no one. So which is it?<br>  <br>  *EDIT*  no sweets, you're not a murderer, and i hope to God no one ever makes you feel like one. A good deal of these answers are correct, (and way shorter than mine ~ kudos!) the point is we all make mistakes hence disobey and "sin" IF everyone was perfect and no one ever messed up, we wouldn't need Christ to have come at all, because we would not need to be atoned for.  You'll figure it out. Best of luck to you.

No one can keep Gods Law Rom.3. We all deserve hell, we all do. God wants us to go to heaven, but no imperfect thing can get in. God loved us sooo much that even though we are sinners Christ died for us. He came from heaven, remember He didn't have to, and was born into a humble life. He lived a sinless life and gave his own life on the cross for our sins. He took our place on the cross. He took our punishment. He paid our debt so that we don't have to pay it. Jesus resurrected on the third day conquering death. If we repent and place our faith in Jesus He will forgive us. Jesus said that He was the only way to get to heaven. If you died without repenting and placing your faith in Jesus then there is only one place we would go (and Hell is mentioned in the new Testament even if people will tell you it doesn't.). Jesus loved you soooo much that He took your place. Know let me ask you a question. Do you think you should be allowed into heaven?

And He isn't sitting up there saying "O, too bad for youm, you're going to hell."  <br>  He has provided a way for pretty much everyone, except for maybe a handful, to inherit a certain degree of glory.  There are actually three "levels" or degrees of glory - Celestial, Terrestrial and Telestial, and there are three levels inside the Celestial, which is the highest.<br>  To give a brief description of "who goes where":<br>  Celestial - Where God and Christ dwell, where those who have made and kept certain covenants - such as baptism and eternal marriage - will be.<br>  Terrestrial - those who believe in the gospel, but were not valiant in it.  Those who didn't accept the fullness of the gospel, but accepted Christ as their Savior and those who were honorable people.<br>  Telestial - those who were unrepentant, never accepted the gospel nor Christ (most likely the murderers, liars, fornicators)<br>  Joseph Smith said even the Telestial Kingdom was beautiful beyond all understanding.  How much more wonderful, then, will be the Celestial?!  <br>  If you stay the way you are, never accept the gospel, you would most likely be in the Terrestrial.  Of course, I am not the judge, I'm just speculating here.  We are all God's children, He loves us WAY more than to torment us for all eternity.  Even the "torment" of suffering for sin will end, it will not be eternal.<br>  <br>  God forgives all *IF* you repent, and truly forsake your sins (except of course the unpardonable sins - murder, reject the Holy Ghost).  Repentance is a continual thing, since we sin practically everyday.  It is not a "say the sinners prayer" and you're done.  There is SO much more to salvation and exaltation than that.  Christ did suffer and die for our sins - BUT they can only be forgiven IF we take advantage of the Atonement.  He expects us to try to be perfect, He knows we will never be during this life, but He wants us to TRY.  If you live a good life, are a good person, but never know of the gospel... you think God is going to throw you into hell for that?  Absolutely not.  You will get the reward you deserve, as we all will.  Some will be worthy of higher or bigger rewards (we call that Exaltation), but He isn't going to cast you into "hell" just because.  God is perfect in all things - including justice and love.  You will get what you deserve and what is just.|`|AA11935435	Is Hellfire  Part of Divine Justice?<br>  Have you ever seen someone tortured? I hope not. Deliberate torture is sickening and abhorrent. What, though, of torture inflicted by God? Can you imagine such a thing? Yet, this is exactly what is implied by the teaching of hellfire, an official doctrine in many religions.<br>  Imagine, for a moment, the following horrific scene: A person is being roasted on a hot iron plate. In his agony he screams for mercy, but nobody listens. The torture goes on and on, hour after hour, day after day—without pause!<br>  Whatever crime the victim may have committed, would not your heart go out to him? What of the one who ordered the torture? Could he be a loving person? In no way! Love is merciful and shows pity. A loving father may punish his children, but he would never torture them!<br>  Nevertheless, many religions teach that God tortures sinners in an eternal hellfire. This, it is claimed, is divine justice. If that is true, who created that terrible place of eternal torment? And who is responsible for the excruciating agonies inflicted there? The answers would seem obvious. If such a place really exists, then God would have to be the creator of it, and he would be responsible for what happens there.<br>  Can you accept that? The Bible says: “God is love.” (1 John 4:8) Would a God of love inflict torture that even humans with any measure of decency find revolting? Surely not!<br>  An Unreasonable Teaching<br>  Still, many believe that the wicked will go to a fiery hell and be tormented forever. Is this teaching logical? The human life span is limited to 70 or 80 years. Even if someone perpetrated extreme wickedness for his whole lifetime, would everlasting torment be a just punishment? No. It would be grossly unjust to torment a man forever for the limited number of sins that he can commit in a lifetime.<br>  Who knows the truth about what happens after we die? Only God can reveal this information, and he has done so in his written Word, the Bible, referred to above. Here is what the Bible says: “As the [beast] dies, so the [man] dies; and they all have but one spirit . . . All are going to one place. They have all come to be from the dust, and they are all returning to the dust.” (Ecclesiastes 3:19, 20) There is no mention here of a fiery hell. Humans return to dust—to nonexistence—when they die.<br>  In order to be tormented, an individual has to be conscious. Are the dead conscious? No. “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) It is impossible for the dead, “conscious of nothing at all,” to experience the agonies of hellfire.<br>  This doctrine is A Harmful Doctrine<br>  Some maintain that the teaching of hellfire is useful, true or not. Why? They say it serves as a deterrent to wrongdoing. Is that true? Well, is the crime rate in regions where people believe in hellfire lower than in other places? Hardly! In fact, the doctrine of hellfire is very harmful. Will a person who believes that God torments people view torture as something abhorrent? Why should he? Those believing in a cruel god often become cruel like their god.<br>  In whatever way a reasonable person may look at the matter, he cannot accept the existence of a hell of torment. Logic rebels against it. Human nature is repelled by it. More important, God’s Word does not say that such a place exists. When a person dies, “he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish.”—Psalm 146:4.<br>  What Punishment for Sin?<br>  Does that mean that we are not punished for our sins? No, that is not the case. Our holy God punishes sinners, but he does not torture them. And when sinners repent, he forgives them. What is the punishment for sin? The Bible gives a forthright answer: “The wages sin pays is death.” (Romans 6:23) Life is a gift from God. When we sin we no longer deserve that gift, and we die.<br>  You may ask: ‘How is that just? Why, everyone dies!’ That is true because we are all sinners. In effect, no one deserves life. “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.”—Romans 5:12.<br>  At this point you may be thinking: ‘If we all sin and so we all die, why should we try to be virtuous? It seems that the wicked man is treated exactly the same as the man who tries to serve God.’ But that is not the case. Although we are all sinners, God forgives those who sincerely repent and try to change their ways. He rewards our efforts to ‘make our minds over’ and to do good. (Romans 12:2) These truths are the basis of a marvelous hope.<br>  A Reward for the Good<br>  We cease to exist when we die. But that does not mean that everything is finished. The faithful man Job knew that he would go to the grave (Sheol) when he died. But listen to his prayer to God: “O that in Sheol you would conceal me, that you would keep me secret until your anger turns back, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me! If an able-bodied man dies can he live again? . . . You will call, and I myself shall answer you.”(Job 14:13-15).<br>  Job believed that if he was faithful until death, he would be remembered by God and resurrected. This was the belief of all of God’s servants in ancient times. Jesus himself confirmed this hope when he said: “The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.”—John 5:28, 29.<br>  When will the resurrection begin? According to the Bible, very soon. Bible prophecy indicates that in 1914 this world entered into its “last days.” (2 Timothy 3:1) In what many call ‘the end of the world,’ God will very shortly remove wickedness and establish a new world under heavenly rulership.—Matthew, chapter 24; Mark, chapter 13; Luke, chapter 21; Revelation 16:14.<br>  The result will be a paradise covering the whole earth and inhabited by those who have sincerely tried to serve God. Wicked people will not burn in hellfire, but they will have no place in the coming Paradise. At Psalm 37:10, 11, we read: “The wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”<br>  Is all of this just a dream? No, it is God’s promise. In the Bible we read: “I heard a loud voice from the throne say: ‘Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.’(Revelation 21:3, 4).<br>  Do you believe these words? You should. God’s word always comes true. (Isaiah 55:11) I urge you to learn more about God’s purposes for mankind.Then you will truly know that God is Love(1John4:8) and therefore he would never torture anyone forever, or even at all!|`|E7fguoVBaa	As a Christian who reads and studies the Bible, I can tell you that there is NO Burning Hell.  Hell is just the common grave of mankind.<br>  <br>  Does the Bible indicate whether the dead experience pain?<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 9:5,?10: “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all .?.?. All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol,* the place to which you are going.” (If they are conscious of nothing, they obviously feel no pain.) (*“Sheol,” AS, RS, NE, JB; “the grave,” KJ, Kx; “hell,” Dy; “the world of the dead,” TEV.)<br>  <br>  Psalms 146:4: “His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts* do perish.”<br>  <br>  What is the ‘fiery Gehenna’ to which Jesus referred?<br>  <br>  Reference to Gehenna appears 12 times in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Five times it is directly associated with fire. Translators have rendered the Greek expression ge′en?nan tou py?ros′ as “hell fire” (KJ, Dy), “fires of hell” (NE), “fiery pit” (AT), and “fires of Gehenna” (NAB).<br>  <br>  Historical background: The Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna) was outside the walls of Jerusalem. For a time it was the site of idolatrous worship, including child sacrifice. In the first century Gehenna was being used as the incinerator for the filth of Jerusalem. Bodies of dead animals were thrown into the valley to be consumed in the fires, to which sulfur, or brimstone, was added to assist the burning. Also bodies of executed criminals, who were considered undeserving of burial in a memorial tomb, were thrown into Gehenna. Thus, at Matthew 5:29,?30, Jesus spoke of the casting of one’s “whole body” into Gehenna. If the body fell into the constantly burning fire it was consumed, but if it landed on a ledge of the deep ravine its putrefying flesh became infested with the ever-present worms, or maggots. (Mark 9:47,?48) Living humans were not pitched into Gehenna; so it was not a place of conscious torment.<br>  <br>  At Matthew 10:28, Jesus warned his hearers to “be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” What does it mean? Notice that there is no mention here of torment in the fires of Gehenna; rather, he says to ‘fear him that can destroy in Gehenna.’ By referring to the “soul” separately, Jesus here emphasizes that God can destroy all of a person’s life prospects; thus there is no hope of resurrection for him. So, the references to the ‘fiery Gehenna’ have the same meaning as ‘the lake of fire’ of Revelation 21:8, namely, destruction, “second death.”<br>  <br>  What does the Bible say the penalty for sin is?<br>  <br>  Romans 6:23: “The wages sin pays is death.”<br>  <br>  After one’s death, is he still subject to further punishment for his sins?<br>  <br>  Romans 6:7: “He who has died has been acquitted from his sin.”|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	I respect these questions and this has crossed my mind very much.<br>  There are two main aspects of God. One is love, and the other which is part of God's love, is justice. So god acts in love by giving his only son Jesus to die on your sins, to prove his love for us. On the other hand, God does not want evil, pain and suffering to continue. Do you? So God loves us, and did everything he could to make it so that we don't have to go to hell. But he sends evil souls to hell, because he will eventually on a terrible day put an end to evil altogether and they will be remembered no more.  So God is complete in his plan of salvation and judgement. God is holy, so only through trusting in teh blood of Jesus for your salvation can you stand in the prescence of God.<br>  I can't think of anything more wonderful than a God that will die for us, and I really want God to end all the suffering in the world.<br>  So this is a win win situation for those that believe, and a terrible situation for those that reject God's love for us.<br>  Rev 20:10  Then the Devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.|`|j4GjtuVQaa	Here's the deal: In addition to being loving, God is also just. He has to punish sin. So if we sin (and we all do) then we're bound for hell. That's everybody. No exceptions. That's necessary in order for God to be infinitely just.<br>  <br>  But God is also infinitely loving. So in his love and grace he provides a way out at his own expense. We just have to accept his free gift of salvation through faith in Christ's death as being sufficient to pay the penalty for our sins. If we do that, then God's justice can be satisfied (because he took it out on Jesus) and so can his love.

Catholic is a whole other story. Protestants believe in Christ and read the Bible. They want to tell everyone about their belief, that's just how it is. Catholics are more secluded. <br>  <br>  Baptists use water as a huge blessing thing.<br>  <br>  Methodists are more instrumental or musical about their faith.<br>  <br>  Presbyterians are a bit longer so here is a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.allexperts.com/q/Presbyterians-959/curious-presbyterian-religion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://en.allexperts.com/q/Presbyterians...</a>|`|yKZQoLDoaa	Methodist = In practice, we are similar to other Protestant denominations, affirming our beliefs through the sacred symbols of baptism and communion. <br>  <br>  Through baptism, we accept God's gifts through Jesus. There is no strict rule among United Methodists about how baptism must be performed, although sprinkling water on the head of the person being baptized is most common. Everyone is accepted and welcome at the communion table, whether members of the Church or not, kids or adults.<br>  <br>  Presbyterian = Presbyterians trace our history to the 16th century and the Protestant Reformation. Our heritage, and much of what we believe, began with the French lawyer John Calvin (1509-1564), whose writings crystallized much of the Reformed thinking that came before him. <br>  <br>  Some of the principles articulated by John Calvin remain at the core of Presbyterian beliefs. Among these are the sovereignty of God, the authority of the scripture, justification by grace through faith and the priesthood of all believers. What they mean is that God is the supreme authority throughout the universe. Our knowledge of God and God's purpose for humanity comes from the Bible, particularly what is revealed in the New Testament through the life of Jesus Christ. Our salvation (justification) through Jesus is God's generous gift to us and not the result of our own accomplishments. It is everyone's job - ministers and lay people alike - to share this Good News with the whole world. That is also why the Presbyterian church is governed at all levels by a combination of clergy and laity, men and women alike. <br>  <br>  Baptists = B- Bible is the only rule for faith and practice. The Bible is the revelation given by God to man and is infallible in every sense.<br>  <br>  A- Autonomy of the local church. Baptists affirm that every local church is to be self-governing and independent of all other churches. Godly leaders in the church are to seek God directly for wisdom in guiding the affairs of the church.<br>  <br>  P- Priesthood of the believer. Every believer today is a Priest of God and may enter into His presence in prayer by our great High Priest, Jesus Christ. As priests we can study God's Word, pray for others, and participate in spiritual worship.<br>  <br>  T- Two ordinances. Baptists believe in two ordinances that are to be carried out in the local church. These ordinances are baptism by immersion, and the Lord's Supper.<br>  <br>  I- Immersed, regenerate church membership. One may not be a member of a Baptist church until he has both made a profession of faith in Christ (necessary for salvation) and been immersed in obedience to Christ (not necessary for salvation). Baptists do not baptize babies.<br>  <br>  S- Soul liberty. All believers have the ability and responsibility to privately study and interpret the scriptures. The guidance of the Holy Spirit in his life is all that is necessary for private study. He is responsible to God alone, not to any person, church or writings (aside from the Bible).<br>  <br>  T- Two offices: Pastor and Deacon. The offices of Pastor (the Shepherd of the church) and Deacon (the servant leaders of the church) are the only two offices established in Scripture.<br>  <br>  Catholics = Catholics believe in one God.  We believe that God has always existed and will always exist.  We believe that God does not change.  Since time is a measurement of change, it stands to reason that God exists outside of time.<br>  <br>  God created the world from nothing.  He made angels (spiritual beings), animals (physical beings) and men (spiritual and physical beings.)   <br>  <br>  Our vision of God encompasses and greatly expands upon the God of the philosophers.  With them we proclaim that God is the First Cause, the Supreme Good, and the only Being that exists which MUST exist (I Am That Which Is, God said to Moses), and that God is Truth.<br>  <br>  We believe further that God is Love, and that "God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son" to die for a world that had died to God.<br>  <br>  Catholics are Trinitarian Christians.   This does not mean that we believe in three Gods.  Rather, it means that we believe in one God in three Divine Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This relationship was revealed in the New Testament.  See, for instance, the poem which begins the Gospel of John.<br>    <br>   <br>   II. MAN: THE SLOW LEARNER<br>    <br>   <br>   God made men with free will.  The first men excercised this free will and chose to disobey God.  This was stupid, but not the stupidest thing in the history of the universe.  We'll get to that in a moment.<br>  <br>  Man's first disobedience is "the fall."  The effects of the Fall are death, corruption, and the desire to sin, which we Catholics call concupiscence.  At this point I'd like to remark that some Christians do not distinguish between sin and the corruption of nature, caused by the fall, which can lead to sin, as James illustrates: "God is not subject to temptation to evil, and he himself tempts no one. Rather, each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his ow|`|ZAT8yqaGaa	Don't forget Orthodox.

I'm not sure if you left it out when you submitted the question or if that was how it was originally written and that's the cause of the confusion, but either way -- there should be a comma there.<br>  <br>  Basically, it means that while they were getting settled in -- meaning something like getting comfortable or established -- the cleaning lady walked into the room.

AA10221696	This is kinda a complicated answer. <br>  You should care a lot about yourself, that is where you find out what values are important to you, how to take care of yourself, what the meaning of success is to you. Do not think this is selfish, this is called taking care of yourself and being true to yourself. <br>  <br>  When you take care of yourself, listen to yourself, know that you are ok, and loved by yourself, You can slowly think about how you want to extend charity to others. <br>  <br>  The world is very hard, but also very beautiful. There will be many people lined up at your door for help if you are giving it out, most of these people have not found the love within themselves and are seeking the love of others. And you being a loving soul can help them, but help them in a way that you help yourself or rather protect themselves. But think about what happiness and help means, I believe its helping people find a way to help themselves. <br>  <br>  Loaning money - A person that needs money usually cannot pay you back, you can expect to lose this person, you never lend money, you give it and forget about it. <br>  <br>  Other help - Sometimes help can be in the form of helping people find the resources they need, for instance if someone cant find a job, help them find a place where they can get some additional skills to improve their life..don't give them money. <br>  <br>  Think about  it like this...find out what is important to you, know that there are a lot of takers....channel your giving into something that you can see results, as in volunteering your time to a nursing home to read to people, etc. <br>  <br>  I am sorry that your friend has a pessimistic view, but it is his view...and you have to let him figure it out, people like this can bring you down or hold you back from doing what you were meant to do. <br>  <br>  There are so so many kind people in this world. Go online and read about Search for Common Ground, Ashoka Changemakers, Social Edge, The Skoll Foundation. And there are a lot of people who are lost who only learned how to take, and you pray that they find their way. <br>  <br>  Remember too, what Gandhi said. That you must BE the change, that you want to see, You must be the example rather than talk about it. those around you learn by watching what you do, those that understand you will respect you those that do not, you must leave behind. Kindness, is worth fighting for. Some say being nice is naive, I say to be nice is a sign of intelligence, you must be able to fight to stay kind, and its not easy and a life lesson. Stay bright, stay kind, be good to yourself and be pass it on, the world is full of kind people.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Yes.

Think about if there was an atheism section here (and there should be!)  Some atheist asks a question that you think you can answer, something about Christianity, say.  And suppose you answer it to the best of your ability, not being snotty or superior, just in your own words, trying to help.  And then suppose a bunch of atheists came by, and they read the question and then your answer.  You'd get a lot of thumbs down just because they disagreed with you. <br>  <br>  But that wasn't why you answered the question, because you wanted everyone to agree with you.  You answered it because you thought you had something useful to contribute.  You might even get Best Answer because your answer was the most HELPFUL.  Thumbs-downs are not helpful.<br>  <br>  So I don't care what people think.

Talking about a dinner plate you could have people spelling it plate or plait. That is just one example there are many others as well.<br>  <br>  The process of getting a book printed up, called typesetting, when the Book of Mormon was first published was an extremely long and manual process, which frequently resulted in errors. We still have problems, even today with all our fancy computer technology, with errors creeping into books as result of the typesetting process. And that being the case then how bad do you think it would have been in 1830?<br>  <br>  Due to the speed of the translation process and their excitement to get it published, when the Book of Mormon manuscript was first given to the printer to publish it there was no punctuation in the whole manuscript. <br>  <br>  So what does all of this mean?<br>  All of those different sources creating the possibility of various forms of errors in the book from what it was originally translated created different errors that needed to be addressed. And as it is very well stated in the Book of Mormon itself "About this edition: Some minor errors in the text have been perpetuated in past editions of the Book of Mormon. This edition contains corrections that seem appropriate to bring the material into conformity with prepublication manuscripts and early editions edited by the Prophet Joseph Smith."|`|6DmsiLGbaa	People always make a big deal out of this, but most of those changes were grammatical.  When Joseph Smith was translating the Book of Mormon, he was literally just reading off the words.  He didn't stop for periods or commas, though I don't think they would have meant anything to him anyway.  After all, the man only had a sixth grade education, and what sixth grader ever thinks about commas?  It was only later, after the translation was finished, that the necessary grammar was added.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I'm glad the grammar was fixed, because it still irritates me when I come across places where English speakers would have put a comma but the writers of the Book of Mormon, who came from a different culture, didn't.  It'd drive me batty to try and read the entire Book that way.<br>  <br>  In any case, none of the other changes were any more significant.  The Book of Mormon was also broken up into verses (it was originally published in paragraph form, which can be very fun to read but makes locating things more than difficult), and changes were made to the introductory pages or index.  The actual words in the Book of Mormon were never changed, and neither was the message, and since that's the case, who cared if the Book of Mormon was edited to make it easier to read?  As long as the message stays the same and the scriptures themselves were left alone, who could possibly object to better grammar?|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	"We heard a voice from out of the bright light above us, saying, 'These plates ... have been translated by the power of God. The translation of them which you have seen is correct ..." (History of the Church, vol. 1, pp.54-55). On another occasion Joseph Smith stated that he "told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth ..." (vol. 4, p.461).<br>  <br>  These claims would lead one to believe that there should never have been a need to make any changes to ‘the most correct of any book’. However, there have been nearly 4000 changes in the text since it’s original publication. While most of these changes are corrections to grammar or spelling (guess God wasn’t too good at English?), many are significant as they deal with basic theology and the nature of God. None of the nearly 4000 changes are noted or explained in the text and so a reader today is misled into assuming that the modern edition is the same as the original.<br>  <br>  Even changes in spelling and grammar are important when we consider the claims concerning the translation which were made by Joseph Smith and the witnesses to the book. Martin Harris said that the words which appeared on the seer stone would not disappear until they were correctly written. Oliver B. Huntington recorded in his journal that in 1881 Joseph F. Smith, who later became the sixth president of the Mormon church, taught that the Lord gave Joseph Smith the exact English wording and spelling that he should use in the Book of Mormon:<br>  <br>  “Saturday Feb.25, 1881, I went to Provo to a quarterly Stake Conference. Heard Joseph F. Smith describe the manner of translating the Book of Mormon ... Joseph did not render the writing on the gold plates into the English language in his own style of language as many people believe, but every word and every letter was given to him by the gift and power of God.... The Lord caused each word spelled as it is in the book to appear on the stones in short sentences or words, and when Joseph had uttered the sentence or word before him and the scribe had written it properly, that sentence would disappear and another appear. And if there was a word wrongly written or even a letter incorrect the writing on the stones would remain there.... and when corrected the sentence would disappear as usual” ("Journal of Oliver B. Huntington," p.168 of typed copy at Utah State Historical Society).<br>  <br>  Yes, Smith really did 'translate' the Book of Mormon by putting rocks in a hat. Church Apostle Russell Nelson admitted it:<br>  <br>  “The details of this miraculous method of translation are still not fully known. Yet we do have a few precious insights. [Oliver Cowdery's brother-in-law] David Whitmer wrote:”<br>  <br>  ‘Joseph Smith would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man." (David Whitmer, An Address to All Believers in Christ, 1887, p. 12.)  Elder Russell M. Nelson, A Treasured Testament, Ensign, July 1993, 61|`|AA10637643	Most correct doesn't mean perfect.  AND no DOCTRINE has ever changed.

You'd think they'd get the identity of God right the first time around. Of course Brigham Young told my great grandparents that Adam was God, so I guess not.<br>  <br>  Most changes were grammar. People didn't want it to sound like the thing was written by some backwoods guy with no education - but the first version sure does.|`|dLKTEhnyaa	hahahah lol lol<br>  <br>  the mormons won't answer this.  watch. lol<br>  <br>  I believe the number of alterterations to the book is around 3000, not 2000.<br>  <br>  the mormons will him hum stumble and make excuses, but they can't logically answer this without looking like they are lying.|`|lk03YYPEaa	You won't get any correct answers from Mormons. They've been told that they've been edited to correct "grammatical errors".

erGOrzEiaa	LGBT people tend to be much more open on average than the average straight person since you have to be to some degree to have come out to yourself and being part of that community sort of brings it out too.

Give it time and your true sexuality will emerge.|`|EZ1cPPvkaa	I agree that it is not a good indication of your sexual orientation, but I also wouldn't say that it has absolutely no bearing.  People who are curious about their own sexual orientation probably tend to lean towards other people of a homosexual or bisexual orientation out of curiosity, comfort, etc.  <br>  But it is entirely possible that you simply get along better with people of different sexual orientations without actually identifying with those orientations at all.|`|lpDXCQwoaa	Nope.

Freedom from external threats and solving disputes between states created a culture of being prepared to fight for what you believe in. <br>  America stands for the individual's rights and freedoms and his ability to defend them. The amount of people who've come from different cultures that don't respect the struggles of the first generations has created a divided society with neighbor unwilling to defend neighbor.<br>  It's sad that billions have to be spent on sending young men and women overseas when there's so many problems in their back yards.|`|48c286b828494072a0a06f4f8f0b74bcaa	It could be.  Equality is taught over here too, but it seems that people tend to gravitate towards specific groups.  For example, there are Republicans, Democrats, city people, country people, etc., and many seem to socialize with others that they can relate to within these groups.  So I guess there is a kind of unity there, but not so much with the nation as a whole, except for (perhaps) in times of crisis (i.e., September 11th).|`|g1oYoNwOaa	I've lived in Canada since i was little, i dont have any of that your talking about.

"Abyss" does not occur in the King James Version but the Revised Version (British and American) so transliterates abussos in each case. The the King James Version renders the Greek by "the deep" in two passages (Lk 8:31; Rom 10:7). In Revelation the King James Version renders by "the bottomless pit" (Rev 9:1,2,11; 11:7; 17:8; 20:1,3). In the Septuagint abussos is the rendering of the Hebrew word tehom. According to primitive Semitic cosmogony the earth was supposed to rest on a vast body of water which was the source of all springs of water and rivers (Gen 1:2; Dt 8:7; Ps 24:2; 136:6). This subterranean ocean is sometimes described as "the water under the earth" (Ex 20:4; Dt 5:8). According to Job 41:32 tehom is the home of the leviathan in which he plows his hoary path of foam. The Septuagint never uses abussos as a rendering of sheol (= Sheol = Hades) and probably tehom never meant the "abode of the dead" which was the ordinary meaning of Sheol. In Ps 71:20 tehom is used figuratively, and denotes "many and sore troubles" through which the psalmist has passed (compare Jon 2:5). But in the New Testament the word abussos means the "abode of demons." In Lk 8:31 the King James Version renders "into the deep" (Weymouth and The Twentieth Century New Testament = "into the bottomless pit"). The demons do not wish to be sent to their place of punishment before their destined time. Mark simply says "out of the country" (5:10). In Rom 10:7 the word is equivalent to Hades, the abode of the dead. In Revelation (where the King James Version renders invariably "the bottomless pit") abussos denotes the abode of evil spirits, but not the place of final punishment; it is therefore to be distinguished from the "lake of fire and brimstone" where the beast and the false prophet are, and into which the Devil is to be finally cast (Rev 19:20; 20:10).|`|ixFbNr4taa	Perhaps you mean ......the Abyss. <br>  <br>  Usually if one was speaking in religious terms -- you would be sending demons or evil spirits back there they came from (Hell, a bottomless pit, utter darkness) -- which is what the word Abyss means -- a bottomless depth. <br>  <br>  Here is an online definition:<br>    <br>  1.

Begone, + now! Begone, + seducer! Your place is in solitude; your abode is in the nest of serpents; get down and crawl with them. This matter brooks no delay; for see, the Lord, the ruler comes quickly, kindling fire before Him, and it will run on ahead of Him and encompass His enemies in flames. You might delude man, but God you cannot mock. It is He who casts you out, from whose sight nothing is hidden. It is He who repels you, to whose might all things are subject.

XEbrGfZuaa	I grew up from the mid 40's through the 50's. And I remember what I<br>  thought of as a black and white world. I remember darker colors and<br>  not bright vibrant ones, when I'd go downtown with my mother to shop,<br>  have lunch with my dad, or just take me to lunch after shopping.<br>  Coats were tan raincoats, and drab clothes. Or so it seems to me in<br>  remembering.<br>     People were not as heavy on the street. You could cross at a light,<br>  and not fear being run over. Drivers were courteous, and weren't in a<br>  big hurry. People smiled at you, rather than look away to avoid your<br>  looking at them. Stores were never congested. And clerks took their<br>  time to serve you. Not stand around talking with another clerk.<br>       Food served at lunch counter type restaurants in dept. stores,<br>  had genuine flavor. They didn't have the preservatives back then, and<br>  everything tasted like it was supposed to taste. A thick shake, <br>  was rich with ice cream and syrup, and you couldn't suck it through<br>  a straw right away, til it melted a bit.<br>      Everyone seemed to leave their cars at home,and took the bus<br>  downtown to work. Neighborhoods had fewer businesses, and<br>  what there were, were small and owned locally. And people walked<br>  to work.<br>      A big deal, was going to a place that sold ice cream and order <br>  it and sit at a drug store bar on a swivel stool. These were our fast<br>  food places when I was little. People who worked nearby would go<br>  there for a sandwich for lunch with a bowl of soup. And it was cheap.<br>  We had one, with two pin ball machines. Later they were not<br>  allowed due to their gambling connections.<br>     Neighborhoods had friendly people. Even those you didn't know,<br>  if you drove by, people might wave anyway. Just to show they were<br>  friendly. Neighbors talked over back or side yard fences. Often <br>  catching up on neighborhood info. Women hung their clothes out to<br>  dry in their back yards. And woe to the woman who had dingy laund-<br>  ry hanging out. You had to have sparkling white undies or t shirts and<br>  socks, or you weren't a good wife and mother. As the clothes your<br>  family wore, attested to the type of home maker you were.<br>     Most every mom put up canned fruit and vegitables in the summer.<br>  Partly due to their not working outside the home, and they were<br>  following the routines' their mothers had practiced. And canning your<br>  own food, was cheaper than buying it at the store when or if you<br>  had to.<br>    Women started buying their bread from local bakeries, and the art<br>  of baking the family bread, began to diminish in popularity. Beauty<br>  shops began to appear in local neighborhoods, so it saved from<br>  having to go downtown to a shop, or a dept. store which had their own<br>  salons.<br>     People felt safe to leave their doors open. Even their cars unlocked.<br>  No one feared stealing of things left out in their front yards. People<br>  even ran to local stores, and left their homes unlocked. If they knew<br>  they were only going to be gone, a short time.<br>    We all bought milk and butter and often eggs, from the local<br>  dairy man who delivered early in the morning, before the rooster<br>  crowed. If anyone had a rooster. And sometimes, he'd leave a quart<br>  of ice cream. farm fresh, if it was ordered by your mom on a rare<br>  occasion. <br>     Kids rode their bikes, or they walked where they wanted to go.<br>  No one thought it hard to walk several blocks to a local park, if they<br>  wanted to swim in the summer, or play tennis.  <br>     People sat out on porches during summer, when it was too warm<br>  to sit inside. No one had coolers, or air conditioning. So everyone<br>  was miserable, when it was hot. So we sucked on ice cubes or<br>  we sipped Kool Aid for refreshment. And we even welcomed Jello<br>  on a summer day along with watermelon slices, or other cold fruit.<br>      Neighbors were helpful, if you needed it. They loaned you things<br>  and you loaned back. Neighborhoods, were often like an extended<br>  family. You could always bet another mom would see you and<br>  report you for doing something, you didn't think your mom would<br>  see further down the street. Moms' were not afraid of telling on you<br>  to your mom, if she thought it important.<br>     Visiting nature was free in those days. Watching airplanes take off<br>  and land, was a past time, so many families enjoyed. Usually a<br>  popcorn truck would be right there at the side of the road, near the<br>  airport. Waiting to sell your dad something you'd all enjoy. <br>     Paths were free to hike in the woods, also picnic areas as well.<br>  There was no need for a day pass to hike or camp. Nature was<br>  available to us all for free. And we soaked it up and yet took it for<br>  granted. The lakes, and the rivers were all free to enjoy. People<br>  never put up private propertysigns to stay off when there was a free<br>  flowing river or creek, for kids to explore and wade in. There were<br>  just no restrictions as there are today. And I am so glad, that I<br>  was not only growing up back then, but that during the 60's and<br>  much of the 70's, there still was the ability to get out an|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	We had a great deal of respect for one another - we as kid's were taught to mind our manners.<br>  <br>  I do believe that there were more people who were honest and had integrity.<br>  <br>  We did not live the life of anything goes.<br>  <br>  People were frugal and made plans for their future.<br>  <br>  The school system was allowed to demand that all the class room paid attention to the school work at hand.

Safety and comfort in our own community was taken as normal. Happy days.|`|agwxFmITaa	I am a Baby Boomer.  My first memory is walking hand in hand with my twin sister down from our newly built Council house to where my father, a plasterer, was working on the other new houses.  I had a small oval tin in my hand.  In one side there were tea leaves and in the other side sugar.  When we got there my Dad threw the tea and sugar in a pot of boiling water.  The smell was wonderful and to this day I like tea you can stand up on!     <br>  <br>  There were lots of children in our village the same age as us because men had come back from War in 1945.  We played in the street.  We sat beside the MAIN road to choose cars we liked - sometimes it would be an hour before one came past!  We popped tar bubbles for the lovely smell.  There was a big hill behind our house.  We considered it ours.  It was for rolling down in the summer and sledging on in the winter.  There were rabbits everywhere.  <br>  <br>  We walked for miles.  We stayed out from breakfast time until tea time.  Mothers and Grandmothers were universal - they didn't think twice about checking another person's child - and the child would not tell it's parents, fearing another row.  This was not done unjustly.  There was very little bullying at school.  We didn't know what brand names were so had no reason to envy others.  We were not wealthy but had food on the table - much of it grown by my father.  He was also the source of stilts, sledges, go-carts, kites and the like.  He was a soft-hearted man and would not see any child without stilts if it was 'stilt season'.  We had these 'seasons' for games.   We also had a little river which ran right through the village.  We swam in it.  We crossed rocks taking us far up into the country.  <br>  <br>  I felt like jelly just before i went to sleep - I recognise this now as complete relaxation.<br>  <br>  We had a window on the landing about the front door.  Honeysuckle grew around the door and I have an abiding memory of leaning out of the window, looking at the sky, alive with stars, whilst the scent of honeysuckle filled the air.  Little birds roosted in the honeysuckle and I could hear them shift and settle.<br>  <br>  I could go on forever - but I won't!|`|8yE2sYGeaa	People treated others with more courtesy and respect and sassing was handled immediately by whomsoever was the parent, regardless of whether it was YOUR parent|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	We had to beg to drive the family car on a Saturday night and today the kids have their own cars and come and go as they please!!|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	I really think when most people look back on their youth, they tend to remember the positive things...childhood is such an innocent time.  My grandmother commented on society changing in her lifetime (for the worse)  much the way people now make these same comments...The truth is that people just have different lifestyles now, but are still capable of caring for others, and raising children to be productive members of society. I am happy to say that I live in a neighborhood that looks like Mayberry, and that's how many here describe it.  We don't worry about the kids playing outside, because there are adults watching them all up and down the street.  We all know each other and watch out for our neighbors and their property. We don't worry about locking the doors, and wave when a car passes, we all feel safe here.  Years ago people who lived in the city did lock their doors, that is where most crime has always happened.  We chose the area we live in now for it's comfortable, family friendly surroundings, low crime rate, and that feeling of security.  We lived in Chicago in the early 1960's, and they taught the kids not to talk to strangers. We had to lock the doors, and be very careful not to go to certain neighborhoods because of crime.  Experience has taught me that the people really haven't changed very much, and we don't always remember the past in it's true light.  It's just a matter of perspective.|`|XAAF7R23aa	There was very little vandalism the local bobby would give a lad caught doing something he shouldn't a clip round the ear. If he told his parents they would give him another one for doing something naughty. When I went to the shop for my mum, i would buy two eggs for mine and my sisters tea. You  did not buy large quantities, you bought what you needed as you needed it. People gave discarded clothes to jumble sales to support the boy scouts, or guides or the local church, or you passed children's clothes on to Friends who had younger children. Children were still children at 13, how many 13 year old girls have you seen playing hopscotch or skipping or ball and jacks nowadays. You went to holiday camps if you were lucky enough to be able to afford a holiday, it was fun if you were a child..If you saw the doctor going to someones house, you would call and ask if they needed anything. People were more involved with one another, friendlier somehow. if you did not see someone or the milk was left on the door step, you called to check they were okay. The elderly were treated with respect. I remember running errands for elderly neighbours who had trouble getting out. It was a nicer happier friendlier environment that it is now. People had less material possessions, but were less aware they needed them, and in general they did not need them, The current barrage of things you must have, etc did not exist|`|mQZDizMVaa	Good question and good answers, some of which I would have said.<br>  <br>  I'll just add - <br>  <br>  Things were, i.e. in the workplace - <br>  You proved yourself, gained experience and were promoted at work. Now people with years of experience on the job are being passed over for someone who "knows someone in HR" with much less experience, if any. No longer is it What You Know - it's Who You Know. <br>  <br>  Professionalism and job ethics were the rules of the day. Supervisors practiced the rule of confidentiality. No more. Things that should be confidential aren't, i.e. if someone's going to be fired, or transferred, they should be the first to know. In many cases, everyone else knows, except them.<br>  <br>  You worked for a company forever because jobs were stable and companies didn't merge or close. Companies looked out for you, held pension plans, and you were loyal to the company. No more. Now companies are closing/merging, pension plans are diminishing so there's no such thing as "job loyalty" or "job security." Now  consider yourself working minute-to-minute, nor year-to-year, because you could be fired without reason, aka "at-will." Look what happened to Lehman Brothers.<br>  <br>  People were generally friendlier, helpful, more compassionate and diplomatic. Manners were the rule of the day and parents enforced that rule. Respect for parents and anyone in authority was mandatory and anything less was not tolerated.<br>  <br>  Some of the things I liked back then, that doesn't exist now:<br>  <br>  Manners. Seems as though it went the way of Selectric typewriters. Now rudeness is the norm-and tolerated (more often than not).<br>  <br>  Respect for authority. Teachers and parents were feared. Misbehave  in school and your parents knew about it before you got home, and you were disciplined via the strap. Now kids have more rights than teachers and parents. Hit a kid today and in seconds Child Protective Services is at your door. A kid can falsely claim a teacher sexually harrassed him/her and that teacher's in cuffs-until or unless he's/she's proven innocent.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	People were more respectful of each other and their property. In many towns, you didn't have to worry about leaving your house unlocked, even when you weren't home, you knew your neighbors would look after it for you. <br>  <br>  Kids didn't have all the fancy toys they do now. We made up our own games with what we had on hand and our imaginations. <br>  <br>  Kids were taught to respect their teachers and obey them. Parents made sure that they did just that and that they did their homework after school. And the kids obeyed their parents as well. <br>  <br>  There was very little shoplifting. Parents would make their kids return to the store and either pay out of their allowance or work to pay of the item.<br>  <br>  Plus, if a child brought a weapon to school, it was for show and tell, nothing more.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Come on, we are going back to 1950. . . I am 6 yrs old. . I love to play with my paper dolls.  The dolls themselves were heavy thick cardboard, and their cloths were all paper with tabs you bent a the shoulders to hold them on the doll. . some I even drew and colored myself !  I play house ball, and jacks an ride my bike in the street !  Way fewer cars back then. . I play outside till the street lights come on, we are not afraid of danger stranger because there are several adults sitting on their porches watching out for us, they even scold us when we are bad !  . . We listen to the Shadow on the radio at night but we are going to get a TV in another month, just like Nancy, my friends. .. How do they get the people in that box ? ? ? Today at school, the teacher was walking around the room with her ruler in her hand, and we were practicing our penmanship.  She says it is important to get every word just right.  If you don't she smacks you with the ruler and it hurts !  I always try real hard to be good !  If we are sitting, we have to stand up when an adult comes in our room. . It is called respect or something like that !  I brought a comic book to school today. Teacher lets us read them because it is the most important thing in the word to learn to read.  Jimmy brought in a jar of Ovaltine and read the label to us . . it was funny because no one else likes Ovaltine !  My favorite subject is Geography. . . do you like it ?  Oops, gotta go it is 8:00 and my bedtime !!  See you tomorrow !!!

It was made up in competition with Christmas's Santa.<br>  <br>  As was said, it was probably made up by an unaffiliated Jew to keep the children interested (im not sure it it worked well or not)<br>  <br>  Chanukah is about finding a small jar of PURE oil in the temple after it was defamed by the Greeks.  This jar lasted 8 days and nights and thats why Jews celebrate for 8 days...<br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday7.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday7.htm</a>|`|bdObfk4Raa	There is no mainstream Hanukkah version of Santa Claus. It's possible that your friend's family does something out of the ordinary. It's possible you misinterpreted what he said. The only equivalent I've heard of is Hanukkah Harry (but I don't no anyone who actually believes in this Harry guy).
4wkIOVDoaa	Practice at home maybe even in front of a mirror. Oh this may help you...get an elastic band and everytime you say the word like snap the elastic...the pain will remind ur brain not to use that word. <br>  <br>  Other than that just practice. Read a book out loud and get the right pronounciation down. Slowly speak like these actresses you like so much. Find them being interviewed on youtube and then pause it each time they say something and repeat after them until you get it sounding right.

Listen to a priest at church, to a talk show host, or even to the news.  Try to notice how a long pause actually sounds great in a speach.  Instead of saying "like" or "um", try a pause, think before you speak, and continue.  A pause also adds an air of sophistication to what you're saying.  <br>  <br>  Also, try having a friend interrupt you everytime you say those words.  This will help reduce their usage.

Now, personally I believe that my religious theories held up to the tests I put them against.  I believe that there have been experiences in my life that I can't ignore, things that make me believe that there is a God, basically positives.  There have been a lot of times when I didn't have the answer, I had to study, do tests, try things out, see what happened.  But, I feel pretty solid where I am now.<br>  <br>  My hubby is one of those people who is far more faithful and at times I envy him.

But they all refused to come!<br>  4 “So he sent other servants to tell them, ‘The feast has been prepared. The bulls and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the banquet!’5 But the guests he had invited ignored them and went their own way, one to his farm, another to his business.6 Others seized his messengers and insulted them and killed them.<br>  7 “The king was furious, and he sent out his army to destroy the murderers and burn their town.8 And he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, and the guests I invited aren’t worthy of the honor.9 Now go out to the street corners and invite everyone you see.’10 So the servants brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike, and the banquet hall was filled with guests.<br>  11 “But when the king came in to meet the guests, he noticed a man who wasn’t wearing the proper clothes for a wedding.12 ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how is it that you are here without wedding clothes?’ But the man had no reply.13 Then the king said to his aides, ‘Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’<br>  14 “For many are called, but few are chosen.”<br>  Matt 22:2-14 (NLT)<br>  <br>  When you stand before God will you be invited to stay ?

Then, they decide to test God by praying for something foolish like a big car.   God does not mess around with foolishness, so those folks just assume that God must not exist because their prayer was not answered.    <br>  <br>  Folks who really understand the power God controls and have some real faith don't waste time with nonsense.  Some do ask for some material object, but mostly the request is for help, for peace, for understanding, and things like that.    <br>  <br>  Early in my Christian walk, I asked God for a way out of a predicament I found myself in.   Due to acts of another person, I was about to lose everything.  I had to pay a large bill (that was really not mine) or the court would have their way with me.       <br>  <br>  In desperation, I asked God for a way out of that mess.    I had about a month to come up with $2,700.00.   <br>  <br>  About a week before the deadline (I was still hoping that God would do something, but I had managed to gather up almost half of the money myself) I came home very late from working overtime.   As I opened my door, I glanced down in the bushes and saw a large envelope.  It was like an express mail thing, and it was addressed to me.   <br>  <br>  Great!   Probably another collection letter.....<br>  <br>  I tossed it on the couch and made a little food for dinner.   As I ate, I opened the envelope and to my surprise there was a letter from an agency congratulating me on winning their contest.   Oh, and there was a check for $3,000.00.   A real check!   <br>  <br>  I don't remember entering any contest, but the check was real.   I had enough to pay the bill, and had $300.00 left over!   I was fixing to spend it, when I rememberd my prayer.   I also remembered that God had asked the Jews to return 10% of their profit to Him.    Isn't it interesting that I had exactly 10% left over?   <br>  <br>  I got the clue, and found a nice little church to donate the money to.  <br>  <br>  I kept studying God's word, and eventually was baptized a Christian.  I know that God did not have to answer that prayer, but I realized that He did to show me that I was on the right track, and to show that what little faith I had was enough for then.    <br>  <br>  Faith is expecting the word of God to do what it says it will do, and depending on the word of God to do what is says it will do.|`|0sOnf2YQaa	You are learning yes, but your search has ended in Jesus Christ.<br>  Now you are to seek after him hourly.<br>  Is your earthly life through yet? No. Keep pressing after the Lord.<br>  <br>  Without faith it is impossible to please God.<br>  Faith secures for man the approval of God.<br>  <br>  One of my favourite quotes is most applicable here<br>  <br>  "Faith rests on the character of God"<br>  A.W. Tozer<br>  <br>  My faith in God can be no stronger than my understanding of God's character. His character is revealed in the Bible.<br>  When God seeks a man out - and it is always God that does the seeking - man must step out to Him in faith.|`|AA10945101	I would say that Christions who tell you that you have to trust him 100% or your prayer doesn't count fall into that "ignore them" category I mentioned in my answer to your previous question.  <br>  <br>  I've always liked the mustard seed illustration.  If you think about it, a mustard seed is 100% complete...it contains everything it needs to grow into a tree that can support a bird's nest and provide shade!  It may be a REALLY small seed, but as long as it is complete in an of itself, it has the ability to grow.<br>  <br>  Now I believe that if your mustard seed is 100% complete, then it is as powerful and as valid as a person with faith like a mustard tree!  The question is, is your seed complete or incomplete?  Of course, only you can answer this question.  <br>  <br>  I think faith is 100% or it isn't faith, it is hope.  Now if you truly have faith that (1) you are a sinner who can't live up to God's standards and (2) that Jesus is your savior, then it doesn't matter if you still have a lot of questions.  Ask yourself this, what would have to happen for you to turn away from either of those beliefs...if the answer is that nothing would cause you to doubt either then you have a complete mustard seed of faith.  Now if Jesus said a mustard seed was enough to move a mountain, what more could you possibly want to do that you can't do with that faith?<br>  <br>  It is normal and healthy for you to have questions and even for you to have doubts about what you think (or someone else tells you) about what Jesus meant by "savior".  I'd go so far as to say that your "searchng big time" approach is exactly what Jesus said a person needed to learn the truth.  I think it would help if you could accept one more thing on faith alone...you will NEVER know the whole truth this side of the grave!  If you ever find yourself thinking that you've found the whole truth (or worse, another person that knows the whole truth you can follow), you're wrong and you need to start "searching big time" again!|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	it takes a vulnerable childhood to condition a person to faith but less than a mustard seed to change that person to a doubter.|`|Jt565VJxaa	yes but mustard tastes better on ham than faith.|`|euBPdaeQaa	I'm still in that shell.|`|AA10334348	I'm so  lost.|`|XxDQGEalaa	Because it's a good way to ensure loyalty and obedience.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	It sounds to me that someone has told you that only perfect people can be Christians.  That is not true.   Nothing we do is perfect in the eyes of God.  We all sin, even in the failure of our prayers to be perfect.  If you have 100% trust in God, that sounds like perfection to me.  I'm sure you are not perfect, since no mere human is,  so I'm sure you do not have 100% trust in God.    Neither does any other mere human on Earth.   We all fall short,  and that is why we need salvation.<br>  <br>  I think you should pray to be more faithful.  I also think you should avoid willingly limiting your trust in God.  Trust Him to the very best of your ability to trust.  Pray to Him to help you to be more trusting of Him and more faithful to the teachings of The Church.<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.  One of the reasons Catholics often pray to Saints is to ask the Saints to pray for us in a way that is more perfect that we can pray ourselves.  You must worship only God,  but it is good to ask other Christians to pray for you.  That includes Christians who are in Heaven.  I recommend you ask the Mother of Our Lord to help you.  He gave us Mary to be our mother in spirit.   Ask Mary to pray to Her son to guide you. <br>  <br>  There is a very old prayer, in English it is called the "Hail Mary."<br>  <br>  Here it is:    Hail Mary, full of Grace, The Lord is with thee.  Blessed are thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,  Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.  Amen.  <br>  <br>  Chapter 7,  verses 7-15 of the Gospel of Matthew include the Lord's prayer.  Jesus taught us how to pray.  Try His words.   How could you get a better prayer instructor?<br>  <br>  I'm praying for you as I write this.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|6jAVElX7aa	Paul tells us to make our requests known to God in the name of Christ our Lord and Saviour, and to thank the Lord for hearing us.

ljzb6fZBaa	Adam was a son of God only by natural birth, not supernatural birth. By "birth", I mean God breathed into his nostrils "the breath of life" and he became a living being. (Genesis 2:7) However, Adam had not partaken from the tree of life. As a result, Adam did not actually have the same life that God has. God was not one spirit with Adam, nor was Adam an heir of God. God fellowshipped with Adam in the cool of the day in the garden of Eden, but Adam did not have a revelation of God's heart of love, or else he would not have given in to the temptations from the devil to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and he would have warned his wife Eve not to partake from that tree too. Adam was also only in charge of the earth, not the heavenly places or the universe.<br>  <br>  As for us believers in Christ who have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit through faith in Christ, we are much better off than Adam, for we have a supernatural birth - we have been born again with the life of God given by the Holy Spirit who indwells us. "And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you." (Romans 8:10-11) Therefore, we have partaken from the tree of life - Jesus Himself - who is the way, the truth and the life, and He has given us life, that we may have life more abundantly. As children of God, we are heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ. (Romans 8:16-17) We enjoy His inheritance not just on earth but also in the ages to come in the heavenly places, when we become the New Jerusalem. Even now, we are one spirit with Christ, so we can enjoy intimacy with God that Adam could not enjoy since God did not dwell in him. As for us, the Holy Spirit has poured out the agape love of God into our hearts. (Romans 5:5) Hence, we are able to know ("ginosko" - experientially know) the love of Christ more and more, so that we will be filled with all the fullness of God. (Ephesians 3:19)<br>  <br>  In addition, Adam was innocent (before he disobeyed God by eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil) whereas we are justified or made righteous by faith in Christ. Adam did not know God as a Redeemer; he only knew God as a Creator. But God's love is fully demonstrated in redeeming us - for God to create, He only had to speak, but for God to redeem, He had to bleed. "God demonstrates His own love toward us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8) Adam was not seated with Christ in the heavenly places; we are. Adam did not have dominion over the spiritual forces of darkness, only "over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth." (Genesis 1:28) But we have authority in the name of Jesus over not just living things on the earth but also principalities and powers, and we shall one day judge angels, for God has raised us up with Christ "far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all." (Ephesians 1:20-23)<br>  <br>  As regenerated children of God, we have power over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ. We have the full armour of God. We have the wisdom of God revealed to us by His Spirit who indwells us, the wisdom that Adam did not have. "Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God." (1 Corinthians 2:12) The wisdom from the Holy Spirit not only enables us to resist the devil, but also to govern and manage every area of our lives, to build up one another in the Lord, to reach out to those who are still outside the kingdom of God. For we have the mind of Christ, and Christ is our wisdom, righteousness, holiness and redemption. It is all because of His grace - His undeserved favour - that we have such a rich inheritance and glorious identity in Christ through His finished work at the cross, therefore "he who glories, let him glory in the Lord". (1 Corinthians 1:30-31) Hallelujah! :)<br>  <br>  Grace be with you, sister Sandy.|`|e4tvh1d2aa	well simply scholarly, i would say the difference is a basis of symbolism<br>  vs literalism.<br>  assumed the accuracy of biblical text(cough*laugh*cough)we can notice that father and son are not eternaly literal.<br>  as a siritual teacher is also father and subordinate is considered son.<br>  thus all christians are sons of god being subordinate while adam would be a literal son of god and we would be literal sons of adam.<br>  which is one of the most interesting stories is of Jesus.<br>  being both a father and a son both literally and figuratively.<br>  he is son to the father and father to the masses.<br>  while he is also god in flesh thus father and is sacrificed for the masses thus being subordinate.<br>  <br>  hmmm...<br>  food for thought.|`|VHwM54iUaa	Adam was created spiritually alive and through his disobedience died spiritually.

94aa7b5af1e3c386f126e6a3bc1c8a4aaa	Yes, thanks for asking, we are celebrating Eid-Ul-Adha<br>  <br>  This festival is about Abraham and his willingness to follow God's command even though it was to sacrifice his own son, but since he was a true submitter to God (ie Muslim) he did.<br>  <br>  Eid ul-Adha (Arabic: ??? ??????), or Eid-e Qurban (Persian: ??? ?????) occurs on the tenth day of the Islamic month of Dhul Hijja. It is one of two Eid festivals that Muslims celebrate. Eid ul-Adha is celebrated by Muslims worldwide as a commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son (Ishmael) for Allah. Depending on the individual and area of the Muslim world the son of Abraham will be named or go unnamed. Others celebrate Eid-ul Adha as it marks the end of the Pilgrimage or Hajj for the millions of Muslims who make the trip to Mecca each year. Like Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha also begins with a short prayer followed by a khutba. In Mecca, the Khutba is delivered from Mount Arafat.<br>  <br>  It is celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Dhul Hijja (?? ?????) of the lunar Islamic calendar, after Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. This happens to be approximately 70 days after the end of the month of Ramadan.<br>  <br>  Eid ul-Fitr is one day while Eid ul-Adha is four days long. Men, women, and children are expected to dress in their finest clothing and perform prayer (Salaa) in a large congregation. Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice domestic animals, usually sheep, as a symbol of Ibrahim's sacrifice; this sacrifice is called "Qurban." The meat is equally distributed amongst themselves, their neighbours and relatives, and the poor and hungry. The regular charitable practices of the Muslim community are demonstrated during Eid ul-Adha by the concerted effort to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during this day. Coming immediately after the Day of Mount Arafat when Muhammad (PBUH) pronounced the final seal on the religion of Islam, Eid ul-Adha gives concrete realization to what the Muslim community ethic means in practice. People in these days are expected to visit their relations, starting from their parents, then their families and friends.<br>  <br>  Merry Christmas to you|`|ee8b3e499d90ae0c3e99450434e37ae1aa	Eid ul-Fitr is the end of Ramadan, the month of fasting.  Typically the family is awake very early and then after praying the first normal everyday prayer, is required to eat in a small quantity, symbolizing the end of Ramadan. They then attend special congregational prayers held only for this occasion in mosques.  The prayer is generally short, and is followed by a khutba. Worshipers greet and embrace each other in a spirit of peace and love after the congregational prayer. After the special prayers festivities and merriment will be commonly observed with visits to the homes of relatives and friends in thanking God for all blessings. Eid ul-Fitr is a time to come together as a community and to renew friendship and family ties. This is a time for peace for all Muslims in the world to devote to prayers and mutual well-being.|`|1d363f03d60fb308080ce24ce83cc10baa	The Muslims celebrate Eid twice a year, Eid-ul-Fitr and the other, which comes about 10 weeks later, is called Eid-ul-Adha. <br>  <br>  Eid-ul-Fitr is a festival that marks the end of the Holy month of Ramadhan. This joyous day is celebrated to give thanks for the blessings of Ramadhan. Muslims attend the congregational Eid prayer service which is held in the morning. They wear new clothing, cook delicious food and invite friends and neighbors to celebrate with them. Fasting during Ramadhan inspires sympathy for the hungry and needy, and encourages Muslims to donate generously to the poor.<br>  <br>  Eid-ul-Adha (Festival of Sacrifice) is a festival comes about ten weeks after Eid-ul-Fitr, and marks the completion of Hajj (Holy pilgrimage to Mecca). It is the festival of Sacrifice that commemorate the obedience of prophet Abraham (pbuh) and his son Hadhrat Ismail  to the commandment of Allah. prophet Abraham (pbuh)  had a series of dreams in which he saw himself sacrificing his eldest son Ismail. He inferred that it was perhaps the will of God that he should sacrifice the life of his son. prophet Abraham (pbuh) , being most obedient to God, was about to sacrifice the life of his son Ismail, when God commanded him to stop and gave him the good news that he had indeed fulfilled His command. God was so pleased with prophet Abraham (pbuh)  because of his obedience that He multiplied his progeny into billions.

During these two festivals, we offer felicitations, spread joy, and entertain children. But more importantly, we offer remembrance of Allaah's blessings, celebrate His name and offer the ‘eid salaat (prayer). Other than these two occasions, we do not recognize or celebrate any other days in the year. <br>  <br>  Of course, there are other joyous occasions for which the Islamic shari’ah dictates appropriate celebration, such as gathering for special meals during weddings or on the occasion of the birth of a child (aqeeqah). However, these days are not specified as particular days in the year; rather, they are celebrated as they happen in the course of a Muslim’s life.

He will have to accept them as a friend, then add them to his Mafia list. He can also click on other member and do the same thing but vise versa, meaning they would have to accept his friend request then add him to their Mob. Tell him he can add me too.

Furthermore,  the Catholic Church considers it a sin to make such a declaration of condemnation because to do so is a sin against Hope.  The salvation of all human persons should be prayed for - including after they have died.<br>  <br>  I believe that it is sinful to engage in homosexual acts.   I also believe that all sins can be repented from.   All sins can be forgiven if a person's repents and accepts God's Mercy.  Although we should never presume to be saved, and we should most certainly never willingly postpone our confession and repentance to the time of our death,  we should always have hope for and pray for our own and other people's eternal salvation.   There is reason to have hope in "death-bed" or last minute conversions that we who are still alive could never know have occurred.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most people who choose to be celibate are heterosexual,  but if you truly have a purely homosexual attraction,  then you also are called to a life of celibacy.

Il ne se contentait pas de lire le Coran sans l'expliquer à ses compagnons. Il expliquait la révélation aux autres et leur montrait comment mettre en pratique leur foi. Par exemple, dans le Coran, le croyant est exhorté de prier. Toutefois, rien ne précise le nombre de prosternations qu'il doit accomplir ni les mots qu'il doit employer. Le prophète nous a légué la manière de prier. On ne peut la retrouver que dans sa Sounna.  <br>  <br>  L'obéissance au prophète Muhammad (paix soit sur lui), comme aux autres prophètes, est obligatoire. Le Coran est très explicite à ce sujet : <br>  <br>  Le Coran [59:7]<br>  Prenez ce que le Messager vous donne; et ce qu'il vous interdit, abstenez-vous en; et craignez Dieu car Dieu est dur en punition. <br>  <br>  Le Coran [33:36]<br>  Il n'appartient pas à un croyant ou à une croyante, une fois que Dieu et Son messager ont décidé d'une chose d'avoir encore le choix dans leur fa?on d'agir. Et quiconque désobéit à Dieu et à Son messager, s'est égaré certes, d'un égarement évident. <br>  <br>  Le Coran [4:80]<br>  Quiconque obéit au Messager obéit certainement à Dieu.

b6078ba6f0b709ecba50385ae93287b2aa	You won't need to be re-baptized, but if you're going back to a confessional Lutheran church (LCMS, WELS, LCC, etc), you'll need to take adult confirmation classes before you can partake in the Eucharist. Some people consider this ''elitist,'' but we believe that St. Paul warns us in Scripture that we need to be prepared before we partake, and we consider confirmation to be a part of that preparation. For me, this took six or eight weeks... I don't remember exactly. But if I could do it again, I would, simply because I enjoy learning. God bless you, and welcome back.|`|7rR1ggelaa	Beloved,<br>  <br>  Just as Christ only underwent one baptism (Matt 3:15,16) so too do you only require one baptism for the remission of sins.<br>  <br>  While whatever congregation you choose should accept you back with great joy and celebration, I would be quite surprised if they did not also wish for you to attend an adult instruction class.<br>  <br>  Simply contact your local Lutheran parish and inform them of your situation.  They will probably ask you why you want to come back and instruct you as they would any person whom Christ has called to His church.  Just as Christ commanded His apostles to "go forth and make disciples of all nations...teaching them to obey all the things which I have commanded you" (Matt 28:18-20), so to does your pastor have an obligation, in service to you, to make sure that you are brought up in the Word of God as it comes to us in the Holy Scriptures.  After completing such an adult instruction class you will most likely stand before the congregation and confess with your mouth (Rom 10:9) the words of the Early Church creed.  (see Nicene Creed/Apostle's Creed)  One of which will clearly state that you only need to be baptized once.<br>  <br>  As far as questions of baptism and it's relation to salvation, and the appropriateness of one's reasons for membership in a religious community, those are other questions that can be addressed later and are not explicitly asked. <br>  <br>  Peace be with you,<br>  <br>  ~ME~|`|bfmOkE7raa	Talk to a pastor, not this crowd.

Good luck and God bless.|`|7sDoEeZvaa	No. That's a problem many people face. There is no "process" to Christianity and you don't have to be baptized to go to heaven. It's between you and God. That's it. Baptism is simply a symbol. You talk to God, ask his forgiveness for any and all transgressions, and make the commitment to follow Jesus for the rest of your life. That's all you have to do. Just because you were a Lutheran doesn't mean you have to follow them and do as they say. Follow your heart (I know that sounds corny...) and the Bible. John 14:6.

c9efb9774c2c4a0a3e5040b9d214c4d7aa	In some sense, an anarchist society might just be libraries everywhere.<br>  <br>  In the anarchist society described in The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin, they basically had buildings where they put all the stuff that was produced (kind of like a shop).  However, instead of like a shop, you don't go there to buy anything - you just go there and pick up stuff that you want to use - no payment necessary.<br>  <br>  In that sense, it's like having a "library" for everything.

43s63XTEaa	You have very good points. I wondered that for YEARS!<br>  <br>  I'm what you will call an "independent" Christian- I follow none other than the Bible. I also dislike churches.<br>  <br>  Think about it- what makes a Presbyterian church differ from a Penecostal church? Man-made laws that aren't in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Like, with Penecostals and their "girls wear skirts-only" policy.<br>  The Old Testament says that women shouldn't wear men's clothing, and vice versa. Well, guess what man and woman wore back then? Robes! So is it a sin for a woman to wear pants? No!<br>  <br>  Being a Christian is all about being Christ-like. A lot of Christians (about 50%) are hypocritical in this sense because they do alot of things the Bible says not to do or speaks against. "Christians" will openly say they hate gays. Hah! These "Christians" don't realize that God says not to hate one another and to love thy neighbor! Are they loving thy neighbor! No! Contradiction #1.<br>  <br>  So you are indeed right, my friend. Many people claim to be Christian. They are afraid of being disowned and ridiculed by society if they say otherwise.<br>  <br>  Such a shame.<br>  <br>  We do sin on a daily basis, and to correct my answer for those who might find it offensive, what I am trying to say, is that in front of religious authorities (aka Popes, preachers, etc.) they will lie through their teeth and say the worship God, but get them alone and they'll admit they no nothing of God/they don't believe in him.|`|NSXChygtaa	I think some Christians do because we do live in a fallen world where God is letting Satan rule it.  If we're not on our guard he will sneak in and cause us to stumble.  Christians are human, so I wouldn't focus on the mistakes as people make them, but more so on whether they continue to.  That then tells us if they are truly Christian.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	You read the words, my friend, but you are far from understanding their meaning.

Jesus never declared premarital sex to be adultery...that's just an academic theory.  Lust is adultery, but lust is very, very serious...on the level of stalking.  Lust is not a simple fantasy.  I send my Christian friends to the site below because it debunks a lot of the stuff that the 'Christian' Right claims about the Bible.|`|phH2dVYZaa	This is a ridiculous question, and you know the atheists on here are gonna jump all over it.<br>  <br>  Not practise christianity? Meaning, you don't do ANYTHING? Because they are stupid.<br>  <br>  If you sin, it does not make you any less of a christian. God is all forgiving.|`|1bd7361886f753dc29575d47b7fb14d0aa	Because many don't know what is required to be a Christian.|`|r8rykCkGaa	We should be in church to pay our tithes though.  Not paying your tithes is robbing God.|`|g2JqGIOCaa	Because they have been brainwashed into thinking they must believe in an imaginary guy in the sky.  They don't really believe, they just go through the motions that are the most comfortable and convenient for them.<br>  <br>  A retarded response?  I'm not retarded, I don't believe in that silly stuff.|`|vV4svNCkaa	yeah i know what you mean...people think they are christians...maybe they are but they never apply anything they learned or they do things that they know are wrong, but we are sinners and jesus loves us no matter what.<br>  <br>  i can look back at all the bad things that i have done...but i know that jesus forgives me so the least that we can do is pray and repent then try to be less "fake"|`|VcD1Q6cUaa	A Christian is a Christian if he says he is, despite all his faults and sins. He is probably a sinning Christian, and so his sins are between him and his God.   We are not to judge.|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	they claim to be because they think they are.  Even Christians sin every day no matter how hard we try.  We realize we need God's grace and forgiveness.  We all break commandments.|`|Jt565VJxaa	because people can think they are what ever they want and you don't have to have your consent.|`|HQrqA2I1aa	Because Christians are brainwashed tools and will die that way.|`|pn1NXuIbaa	Is this a "come to jesus" moment?|`|3ioUdPuZaa	You seem to be angry...rightfully so, although anger blocks us from being able to move forward and be the best "we" can be. Some of the things you say, I have heard OR THOUGHT a thousand times!<br>  I use to tell my children that I MAY HATE WHAT THEY DO BUT I WILL NEVER, EVER HATE THEM.<br>  I think God makes the same distinction. So it is our place to speak what we FEEL we are enlightened about, to HELP others...but from God's persective, WE HAVE ALL SINNED AND FALLEN SHORT. People (a lot of them anyway) want to be Christians by word of mouth. Just, I suppose, like someone might WANT to be able to say they are a race car driver or other excitingly enticing or "in" thing. <br>  But you seem to know, as I do, that the actions are falling short of the words...and it KEEPS getting WORSE. <br>  Here's the basics...If you believe in God, then you HAVE to believe in Satan. Its the BIBLE...you cannot pick and choose what you believe or don't. So if you were Satan...and you wanted to TRY to deceive and cause God as much trouble as possible, as well as those of us who TRY to live the life of a believer...where would you hit HARD?<br>  Of course the answer is...IN CHURCH and in the lives of professing Christians!<br>  Satan is a spirit being and God has ALREADY defeated him, but we, on the other hand, are STILL MORTAL. <br>  The walls can come crashing down...and they often do on believers, and SOMETIMES, we just don't find the faith to do the right thing. <br>  The key is really between the believer and God, for ONLY GOD knows they heart of a person and ONLY GOD will be the ultimate judge. <br>  If we stay CLOSE to Biblical teaching and IF we aren't stupid enough to be led astray by some really "out there" interpretations of the words of the Bible, we gain wisdom, faith and the favor of God. <br>  There is this whole battle about the "law" (ten commandments) and grace...and whether we are saved by one or the other. The TRUTH is BOTH. We don't deserve a darn thing! Not one good thing do we deserve as corrupt as we ALL are, to some degree. So God's grace is the only thing that CAN save us...based on our acceptance that he gave his only begotten son to MAKE IT POSSIBLE for us to be accepted into his kingdom. But God judges our hearts and soul by how well we heed his "law" which is the second part of the equation. If we are truly a believer, we will KNOW THE LAW, FEAR GOD, and FOLLOW IT. <br>  We aren't expected to be perfect instantly...we are like babies learning as we go. But we MUST CONTINUE TO LIVE AND LEARN...and we must CONTINUE TO WANT TO AND TRY TO LIVE BY GOD'S LAWS.<br>  Too many people look at the ten commandments like we looked at the "rules" our parents gave us about....taking out the trash, making it home by midnight, etc...BUT WE THINK A LITTLE BACKWARDS IN THIS TYPE OF THOUGHT PROCESS. <br>  GODS LAWS WERE MADE FOR US.......NOT TO GIVE HIM ANY TYPE OF POWERFUL FEELINGS OF DOMINION. GOD KNEW THAT THESE LAWS IN THEIR ENTIRETY, AND IN ALL THEIR DIFFERING DEMENSIONS WOULD BE WHAT IT TOOK TO HAVE US HAVE A HEALTHY, HAPPY AND FULLFILLING LIFE. <br>  WHO DOESN'T WANT THAT?<br>  SO, I GUESS THAT'S WHY SO MANY PROFESS CHRISTIANITY...PERHAPS THEY REALLY WANT TO BE A CHRISTIAN BUT HAVEN'T FOUND THE PATH YET. <br>  GOD WILL LEAD AND MOST WILL FIND THAT PATH IN GODS DUE TIME.<br>  Peace to you,<br>  Bunny7

erGOrzEiaa	In response to only the bold, primary part of the question, "Awesome".<br>  In response to the rest, why on earth are you shocked or don't like it. It just means your friend has a broader potential dating pool lol.|`|x4LYGAIkaa	If you're really his friend, you'd accept him. He trusted you and gave himself to you, and you question your friendship over one of his preferences. Well, you need some time to get use to this info, but it shouldn't be much of a big deal, unless you have something against bisexuals.<br>  <br>  Do you really care for your friend? That is all that should matter. If you do care, try. Take the time, be open-minded, and just get use to it. He's still the same person you know.|`|uPRYwa3zaa	who cares, if he's your friend you should be cool with it. i don't understand how a little thing like that can change your thoughts of him|`|pqsBjUbnaa	Wow, I don't understand why you wouldn't be ok with it. I can see if he was your boyfriend or something and he sprung this on you, but if my best friend were to say that she was Bi, I don't think that I would think of her differently. I would tell her that I'm glad that she has come to terms with it (because I think people are born with their sexualities unless something happened to them in their lives) and not to let her sexuality define her. That's what you should tell him and if you are truly BFF's his sexuality won't matter, might takes some getting used to, but that should be all!|`|lpDXCQwoaa	Aww, don't worry about it. A lot of people are shocked when someone confides in them, it's totally normal. I'm gay and if one of my friends told me they were gay I would be shocked too! But overtime things will start to feel normal again. He's still your BFF right? Keep it that way. I mean he still acts the same doesn't he? You two can talk about which guy you think is cuter! But try not to fight over the same guy hahaha.|`|EQJpV9S3aa	Give your mind some time to process this, just because you want to be cool with it, doesn't mean you instantly are. He has just made you not trust everything you thought you knew about him. It's not that he's changed, but telling you has created a mental and emotional challenge to the image of him you carry in your psyche. Just wait it out, feel whatever you feel, it's a process, give yourself some time, if you need some space from him, just tell him you need some time to get used to the idea. First, give yourself permission to NOT be ok with this, you can't force this. It's easy to watch tv and say "Yeah, I'm cool about people being gay" It's different when it's someone you care about. It takes time.<br>  Let him know that you care, that you want to be ok with it, but that it's taking you a while to process this. That you need to let it soak in a little.
yE2vM76naa	Assume you like chocolate ice cream...<br>  We can put you in a real fancy imaging machine and find the neurons that fire when you say you like chocolate ice cream, but we can't find the reason - like Uncle Charlie used to bring it to you when you were sick, or that it always reminded you of a best friends 7th birthday party. Those things are you, but not your body....<br>  <br>  Start thinking about that....we might be in part defined by our body, but we are also very much more|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Because the soul is what goes on.  Not the body...the soul travels in different vessels, just as YOU travel in different vehicles.  <br>  <br>  You get out of your car, then go to a party, and come home in a friend's car.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	Because many people believe who you are is not your body and that your body is a place for you to reside for a time. <br>  Many people believe the body has a measurement of time allotted but the soul or who you really are is eternal...therefore the body is a vessel or a temple to house your true being.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, our bodies are just vessels.  We will get new bodies and live forever.  The world's point of view is the outward appearance.  God looks at the heart.  What matters to ungodly people and what matters to God are entirely two different things.  Read Isaiah 55:6-9|`|JmMrgtGqaa	because your inner person isnt always the same as outer. your soul is what really matters, not your body. you are your soul not your physical body.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	In reincarnation, your soul transfers body to body, therefore it's the vessel|`|4jW455dgaa	The idea of the body being a vessel refers to and only to reincarnation.  The fact that the vessel description of your body is for reincarnation then the description of your body must be taken from the view point of people who believe in reincarnation.  For example, because we are talking about reincarnation then we must accept their beliefs that the soul of a human being is an independent thing from the body which holds it.  Thus giving the term vessel to a body is perfectly alright as long as you are temporarily accepting the beliefs of reincarnationists.|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	I would not be the same personality as Paris Hilton just because I might lool like her. I believe that I might be exposed to more similar experiences as her based on my looks. But my personality and how I choose to deal with those similar experiences are based partly on my genetic heritage, partly on how I was nurtured, and partly on the type of experiences I have had. Therefore, because I do not believe that my genetics alone makes up my personality then there are two other parts of me that are non-corporal (not of the body). And since those parts seem to be as much in me as my genetics, it is easier for me to say that my body is a container for the other two parts. A container for ones consciousness. And in reincarnation, it is believed that the consciousness of the person would be inherited into another living thing. So that makes me think, when the consciousness is transferred to another living thing, say a deer, then it in part takes on the behaviours and experiences of a deer.|`|Wb7n512Waa	The physical body is just a platform for the experience of our ego, its development and ultimately its nullification in spirituality as we rise above it. The spiritual definition of "body" refers to the space of desire in a person and it is also called a vessel. It defines what is lacking and this is what makes up a person. “The body” is the lowest desire, and it goes through life cycles in order to reach the state when it will be possible for a person to start developing the one desire out of all the others, which can be corrected and raised up to its root in similitude with the Creator. This one desire is called the "point in the heart" or "seed of the soul" and it defines the first appearance of a desire for the spiritual which is greater than all the corporeal desires. This point is like the seed of the soul because this where we begin to developer and enlarge our spiritual soul. The purpose of the spiritual vessel is to receive the Light of the Creator into itself.<br>  <br>  To help you understand better, here is a video which explains more in depth the concept of soul development over many generations:<br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah-video-clips/do-we-reincarnate" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...</a>|`|K5F9T4vNaa	i believe the body is referred to a vessel becase in reincarnation its really about your soul continuing to live, just in another body or "vessel" .  A vessel is just the temporary form your soul fills  until it is time to move to the next.|`|nwRG3N8Maa	Many people have inner confidence. A person who is overweight is protected by the lipids around him/her. Thus this person is confident. People who starve themselves are not self confidence. They're just told they are but really... they're weak ;)|`|k7973dtIaa	The body holds the soul. When you die the body remains. The soul will have been regenerated in this life with the Spirit of God within it. Reborn is what its called..one chance in this life, not multiple.|`|emBkgSnmaa	the vessel is just what carries the soul.

CsJl15U7aa	To be a better christian there is no such animal.  You can't be a follower of Yashua (Jesus) if you are a practicing homosexual.  Masturbating is the least of your concerns.  You don't have to hurt  yourself, just ask GOD to forgive your sins and stop doing those which you have asked repentance for.   Remember though, daydreaming and fantasizing about doing the deed is just as sinful as doing the actual deed.  You can't just stop being homosexual, but you can stop doing the act.  Ask HIM for strength and guidance and if you are truly wanting to please HIM then HE will change you.  HE sees into your soul and heart.  HE has known you since before you were born.  HE knows how to make you whole.  <br>  <br>  HE wants you to kneel and pray for three days with fasting.  HE wants to cleanse you, to make you whole.  You are important to HIM.  HE will hear you.  Start next Thursday at midnight.  That is the new moon.  After the three days, it will be Sunday morning take a shower, eat a lite breakfast then read  your Bible.  Your mind will be clear for the first time in your life.  You will hear what the LORD has to say.  Start with Jeremiah 10 the whole chapter.  From there listen to what HE tells you.  HE will guide you if you are obedient and don't waiver in you new life.  You will be free from the bondage of this world.  The TRUTH will set you free.  GOD Bless you.  For the LORD wants to make a change in your life!!|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Somewhere it is said  that repentance is a sort of punishment. Repentance absolves all sins. I do not know what will happen, if we go on repeating the known mistakes.|`|ZoPln7vaaa	you don't have to punish you're self... just ask GOD to help you to get rid of those feelings and HE will surely help you as HE loves everyone|`|JmMrgtGqaa	how about you go to church and not respond to being gay and try to stop masturbating if you feel so bad about it? In the Catholic Church, it says that your not bad for being gay, and God love you just as mush as anyone. but you should just choose not to practice sexuality as a homosexual. If your having problems controlling yourself, see a priest or trusted clergy member for help. And either way, don't punish yourself. If God sees fit to punish u, he will do it himself, hes the one to judge you.|`|1bd7361886f753dc29575d47b7fb14d0aa	a) You are not a Christian<br>  b) God does not call us to punish ourselves.<br>  c) Common sense tells you to clean up your life.|`|iyweojLoaa	stop being gay<br>  <br>  stop masturbating<br>  <br>  ?|`|aHEwm3QLaa	whip yourself the Opus Dei style|`|355JLlcLaa	Masturbation is normal. And being gay is natural and nothing to be ashamed of. Minorities should have the same or equivalent rights as those in majorities, and might need special legal protection as defence against those who would persecute them.  <br>  <br>  The Bible considers "spilled seed" as unclean, not as deserving of execution, as is prescribed for most of the extreme sexual taboos in the Pentateuch, including gay sex. But much of the Bible would be considered highly immoral, and even criminal, in most democratic western countries.<br>  <br>  I think it's more important to be a good person rather than a good Christian or good in any other religion. Religions and religious sects can be divisive; having respect and compassion for each other is the important thing.|`|SZTm6mwmaa	I'm sorry but the good news is Jesus already paid the price for the sin of the whole world. God laid it all on Him on the cross. You need to accept His free gift by faith in Jesus and live for Him.

But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God’s one and only Son.19 And the judgment is based on this fact: God’s light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil.20 All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed.<br>  John 3:16-20 (NLT)|`|F5WwtQaEaa	I'm not a Christian, but I don't think it makes sense to punish yourself.

However, your love on males and your sexual desire (and dreams at nights) has become your nature; basically, you could hardly do anything about it. Ask God to remove these "nature" in you if you will.<br>  <br>  Not to masturbate not only mean the physical action, but the life style. Not to engage in porn and to self provoke sexual fantasies about both males and/or females. The physical pressure is not the issue, but the media that involved during masturbation.  <br>  <br>  Do please God by doing what He sees as righteous and He is the one responsible in making you holy and is able to do the right things.|`|fjWSayzuaa	no need to punish yourself, God is love.  seek Him with your whole heart, repent and ask for forgiveness.<br>  <br>  "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"- I John 1:9|`|Dw1JqqXEaa	Dude, he doesn't exist. <br>  <br>  According to the bible, your damned anyway, just become an atheist!|`|HAmtRpGJaa	your a complete tosser.|`|pDAapTvDaa	beat yourself with a bible :)|`|Jt565VJxaa	you can whip your self for God ;)

If you want to be a pothead go be a pothead in a country where marijuana is legal. Furtheremore, it kills brain cells, which you seem to be in short supply of so I would stay away from it if I were you <br>  <br>  Alcohol kills brain cells as well and, again,  since you don't exactly seem to have an abundant ammount spare so I'd stay away from it as well if I were you.|`|NSXChygtaa	The body is his temple and we are not to do anything that would harm.  While eating at a buffet is bad for you, he also said don't do anything that will cause us to not be on our guard (as in making sure you don't make your brother stumble) and drinking and smoking does just that.  It alters our mind and mood and therefore cannot make correct judgment.|`|ZAT8yqaGaa	Though out most of our history Christians have said the occasional drink is good. It is only modern protestants that say drinking is a sin- Christ turned water into wine and gave wine to the apostles. Over eating is a sin it is called gluttony.<br>  We are to enjoy things in moderation. We are also suppsoed to see our sins first and be blind to those of other people.|`|dF5clN4daa	I've probably smoked as much and drank as much as the next addict and by the grace of God I am clean.... for 25 years.

For a drunkard and a glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe one with mere rags.” <br>  The use of alcohol in moderation is permitted according to God's word, just like food. Alcohol is a food and is metabolized by the body to provide energy; the end products are disposed of by the body. <br>  "And wine that makes the heart of mortal man rejoice,<br>  To make the face shine with oil,<br>  And bread that sustains the very heart of mortal man."

ToZ9ar8Oaa	to put it simply... there is no literal translation for "are".<br>  To say "we are engaged" you would say "watashitachi wa yoyakuzumi desu".<br>  "watashitachi" means we/us, "wa" is a subject marker, "yoyakuzumi" means engaged, and "desu" is a copula placed at the end of sentences as a predicate.<br>  "wa" and "desu" are what form up the "are" in this sentence, but you couldn't use those in the same place in the sentence as you could in english, because the sentce structure are quite different between these languages.<br>  by the way, I belive the translation of your sentence is this:<br>  "私たちは秘密裏に従事 信じるしない"<br>  but It may be a bit off. My japanese knowledge is a little rusty|`|UDl8Ac76aa	There's no specific 'are' here.

6DmsiLGbaa	In all honesty, I think you should go see your bishop.  It's not so much about how much or how little coffee you've consumed, but it is about the way you view this.  You said yourself that you "felt it was going to happen one way or another," and that raises a few red flags for me.  For one thing, you're treating this sin--and sin it is, because while of course it doesn't compare to adultery or murder or anything like that, you've still broken a commandment from God--as though it's inevitable, and I strongly disagree with that.  Sin is never inevitable.  It's never something we're forced into, and it's never something we can't avoid.  Remember, God doesn't give us anything we can't handle, and why would He place us in a situation in which we HAVE to commit a sin?  To commit a sin, we have to make a choice.  And if that choice is available to us in the first place, why not choose to obey God instead?<br>  <br>  I recognize that it's not easy to avoid sin, especially if it's all around us.  You see people drinking coffee all the time, and it seems normal to you.  That makes it harder to resist, but you need to remember that this is one of Satan's greatest tricks.  When a sin seems normal and acceptable to us, we're that much closer to committing it ourselves.  You need to step back and remember that God gives us the commandments for a reason.  They're for our protection and good, and even if it doesn't seem like such a big deal to you, even if the rest of the world doesn't even know that it's a commandment, there's a reason the Word of Wisdom was given. Do you really want to risk driving away the spirit and disobeying God for something as minor as a beverage?  In the eternal scheme of things, that cup of coffee means nothing...but disobedience means a great deal, and I would hate for you to lose blessings over something like this.  <br>  <br>  Besides, I think it's significant that those who aren't keeping the Word of Wisdom aren't permitted inside the temple.  Though those two cups of coffee would normally not seem like a big deal, they'll be enough to keep you from having some of the greatest blessings God has offered.  Is coffee worth that to you?  <br>  <br>  In any case, if a sin can keep you out of the temple, then it's one you should bring to your bishop.  If nothing else, he can help you work through this and give you the advice you probably need.  <br>  <br>  I wish you luck with this.|`|TzY9vkinaa	I don't know if you'd need to see your bishop or not, but you could always see him just in case. He could also help give you ideas to avoid drinking coffee.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	I agree 100% with what cadisneygirl has stated. I once was in the same postion that you were in. Except it wasn't coffee it was tea. I can't stand coffee I find it too strong. But tea has always been a hard one for me. I love it iced or hot, or chai tea. I knew I was addicted, as cadisneygirl has mention that many non-members are. <br>  <br>  But one day I was in church and a member of the bishopric spoke to me and told me that I should consider going to the temple as my birthday was soon and I was turning twenty-seven. <br>  <br>  I told him I'd have to think about it as I knew my life wasn't perfect and I wasn't living up to the standards of the gospel. I decided to drop tea cold and never to touch it again. If my eternal salvation rested on a cup of tea and denying the covenents between me and God, I knew that was a flimsy thing and could seriously kick me out of the kingdom of heaven. <br>  <br>  So it's been almost a month and I haven't touched a drop....well not exactly I've turn to herbal no caffine chai Latte tea and I love it. Haven't missed tea at all. In this instance the matter between me and tea was between me and the Lord. I know I am not perfect but I am striving towards what the Lord wishes me to do. <br>  <br>   There are other things out there that have the same taste as tea or coffee if you still like the taste of it. Pero is one of them, it tastes like coffee but isn't. (See <a href="http://perous.com/" rel="nofollow">http://perous.com/</a> )<br>  <br>  As for staying true and clean, my advice to you is as I considered, would you stake your eternal progress on a cup of coffee?|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	You do not need to see the Bishop to repent of minor transgressions.  If you plan on getting a temple recommend, the question is part of the interview.  <br>  <br>  If you are going to medical school, you should have enough education to know there are many substances that are popular, addictive and unhealthy.  You should analyze this both scientifically and religously before you consider abusing your body.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	Look at it this way, the elders (missionaries) came to our church that has a coffee shop in it, and if they can come ten feet within a coffee shop and smell the coffee, I don;t see why you can;t just ask the lord for forgiveness and move on, if you feel the need to need the caffieene to wake up , the that is something you may need to talk to your visiting teachers with, after all what are they there for, but to help you.|`|mxAraZlsaa	your seeing the bishop is the wrong light if your afraid of him in any way. The bishop is only there to help you not to see if he can get confessions from you. Some sins can be embarrassing to admit if you got a personal relationship with him but honestly hes just there to help you strengthen your relationship with your heavenly father whatever level you may be. I'vee told my bishop A LOT more worse things than coffee and never once did I regret it.

It's just coffee. Dont worry about it. It's not a sin.|`|AA12383652	I find it hilarious that people are criticizing the concept that we should stay away from coffee.<br>  Given how addicted most non mormons I know are to coffee its pretty idiotic to criticize mormons for staying away from it!<br>  Having been taught to stay away from coffee, alcohol and tobacco has been a great blessing in my life because none of them are temptations or problems I have to deal with in my life and I have seen the problems they have caused in other peoples lives.<br>  <br>  <br>  You probably dont have any reason to feel guilty or confess to the Bishop but if its weighing on your mind then maybe you should have a little chat with the Bishop.<br>  <br>  You dont want to get addicted to coffee (or anything else) and its a lot easier not to get addicted if you just stay away from it altogether.

0a0df8302296db03c2c6cf8fadc13928aa	Hola Anele!<br>  Soy musulmana. Ya Ranitaferoz te ha dado una respuesta mas que acertada. Mabrouk Ramadán significa "Feliz Ramadán". Aunque es mas usual que se diga Ramadán Karim (Ramadán generoso) o Ramadán Mubarak (Bendecido Ramadán).<br>  Todo musulmán debe cumplir al a?o el mes del Ramadán, que es el noveno mes del a?o lunar. Tanto los hombres como las mujeres debemos dejar de comer (ayunar), de fumar, perfumarnos o tener relaciones sexuales desde la salida del sol hasta su ocaso. Todas estas restricciones desaparecen al caer al noche. <br>  Las únicas excepciones en el ayuno son los enfermos, los viajeros, los ni?os y las mujeres embarazadas. El Ramadán dura 28 días aproximadamente.<br>  Solo agregar que el Eid, es la celebración con la que cerramos este bello tiempo de ayuno y contemplación.<br>  Este día nos reunimos en familia, nos ofrecemos obsequios, compartimos la alegría de nuestra fe, damos gracias a Dios -Allah- por todo lo que nos ha regalado durante el a?o, rezamos y leemos el Corán, nuestro libro Sagrado.<br>  Este 2007, Ramadán inicia el 13 de septiembre y finaliza el 11 de octubre -inshallah (si Allah quiere)-. Como detalle adicional comentarte que actualmente nos encontramos en el a?o 1428 de la Hégira, que indica el traslado del Profeta Mohammad y la primera comunidad de musulmanes de La Meca a Medina, ocurrida en el a?o 622 de la era cristiana.<br>  Saludos, ??????? ?????? assalamu alaikum (que la paz esté contigo) =D|`|55eadbe29aba8d6ca3eae7a90e7f7392aa	Hola!<br>  <br>  Es una expresión que significa algo así como "Feliz Ramadán" . El Ramadán es un mes muy importante del Islam, como dijeron aquí y efectivamente corresponde al noveno mes del calendaríio musulmán, sin embargo, cabe decir que dicho calendario es lunar y por lo mismo, no hay correspondencia con los meses del calendario gregoriano. En este a?o, el Ramadán empieza por ahíi del 26 de septiembre si mi memoria no me falla. Lo que los musulmanes hacen en Ramadán es ayunar desde que empiezan los primeros rayos del sol hasta que se oculta, no pueden comer , beber, tener relaciones y su comportamiento debe de ser ejemplar. Luego en la noche, todos se reunen en las mezquitas, y rompen el ayuno juntos, primero comen dátiles, luego rezan y luego hacen unas comidas enoooooooormes, porque todo el mundo lleva cosas. Luego de que terminaron de comer vuelven a rezar y empieza la recitación del Corán. Llegan de muchos lugares, personas qeu se saben el Coran de memoria y van recitando 1 / 40 parte hasta que pasan las 40 noches. Asi se repite cada día, y cuando es la última noche, se hace una celebración que se llama "Layla Tulkadr" o la noche del destino, disculpa pero mi árabe no es tan bueno, y ahí rezan durante toda la noche. Unos días después , hacen una celebración llamada "Eid" que consiste en rezar y nuevamente hacer otra comidota y luego dan muchos dulces a los ni?os...realmente no sé por qué hacen la Eid, luego si quieres, pregunto. Así que cuando alguien te diga Mabrouk Ramadan procura devolverles el mabrouk , no tiene nada de malo y los harás sentir muy bien.|`|QmbEp1rfaa	Se celebra Ramadan haciendo honor a la revelación del Santo Corán a Mahoma<br>  <br>  Es el noveno mes del calendario musulmán, (su festejo es más o menos el día nueve de Diciembre).<br>  <br>  Desde el alba hasta que se pone el sol hacen el fariseo, osea ayuno: no se puede comer, beber ni mantener relaciones sexuales y tampoco mantener malos pensamientos (ayuno de cuerpo y espiritu).<br>  <br>  La última noche se celebra "La Noche del Destino",se evoca la iluminación de Mahoma al recibir el Corán. Se dice que cualquier petición del creyente puede ser cumplido cuando se hace en esa noche.|`|tOiWQ6GZaa	Mabrouk quiere decir felicitaciones o felicidades en Arabe y Ramadan es una festividad musulmana que se celabra e;l noveno mes del calendario lunar y en la que se esta obligado a ayunar desde ke sale el sol hasta ke oscurece durante este mes se debe tener en cuenta una vestimenta sencilla .<br>  <br>  Ramadan es una fiesta que cambia su fecha todos los a?os y se localiza en el noveno mes del calendario musulmán. El mes del Ramadan también es cuando se cree que el Corán Sagrado fue "enviado del cielo, como una guía y medios de Salvación para los hombres". Es durante este mes que los musulmanes ayunan. Esta fiesta se llama el ayuno del Ramadan y dura un mes entero. El Ramadan es un tiempo que los musulmanes se concentran en su fe y gastan menos tiempo con las preocupaciones cotidianas. Es un tiempo de culto y contemplación.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  en pocas palabras MABROUK RAMADAN kiere decir feliz Ramadan.|`|D8xyWJKgaa	Ni idea
k9RhB23laa	Yes, it is OK for you to want to spend time alone. There is nothing wrong with this desire to be alone, more so since you live practically in a crowd! <br>  It is also normal for your family to expect you to be "normal" and mingle with family members and friends when you go home. Hence, you will have to talk and mingle with them too. Thats what families are for!<br>  <br>  The only solution which comes to my mind is that you must give your family some time, and ensure that you get some time alone as well. Life is all about balance. I agree with you that when surrounded by too many people, one NEEDS moments of solitude in order to calm down and to enjoy peace! So do get on with your " time-out" with yourself. Its good for your health.|`|a065c4f71c097eea61604da9fe663d6caa	"Solitude is different from loneliness, and it doesn't have to be a lonely kind of thing."<br>  --Mister Rogers

When I was tutoring children 5-15yrs of age, I was also kinda like a mentor.  These kids didn't have parents to talk to about how school was, and who mistreated them, or how hard something was.. etc.  I think it's sad that these kids can't even feel comfortable enough to talk with their parents,  <br>  <br>  ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THEIR STRESS IS COMMUNICATION WITH SOMEONE WHO IS A CARING PERSON, no matter who you are, but preferably parents.|`|tdCqjRkFaa	I didn't think young people really knew what stress or tension was.  It gets worse as you get older.  But there parents could allow them a little room 2 make there own mistakes.  Also I think there's alot more 2 be expected from youths these days.  Homework is harder.  Although u have alot more tools at your feet.  Mabey some kids stress about the competition 2 keep  up with the jones's and alot of parents can't afford every new gadget that comes out like cell phones and laptops.  and the youths don't understand there's no money they just want 2 be like every other kid.  mabey we should keep high dollar gadgets like these out of schools and only allow the youths 2 use them after school.  unless there in college.  Or get special permission first.  Because It's not fair 2 the ones who r less fortunate and nobody wants 2 feel inferior 2 others especially when your young and u need some kind of status symbol or a place 2 belong.

u0WGKfViaa	in fact, there are a few mistakes in the sentences you gave...<br>  <br>  1) Pascal habite Paris... this is the correct form... in french, with the verb "habiter" you should not put the preposition "à" with the name of a city... although many native-french people tend to use the preposition "à" with the name of a city...<br>  <br>  2) Il habite au Hebe or Il habite dans la province du Hebe... the first example "au Hebe" would not be recommended for very few people would understand that Hebe is the province of a certain country... unless you speak to people from your country... although I would recommend you to use the second form no matter what... the reason you would say "dans la province..." is the following: "il habite (une ville) dans la province du Hebe"... in Canada, when referring to a province, we usually determine if the name is masculine/feminine: ontario is feminine, therefore: j'habite en Ontario, like one would says j'habite en france, en angleterre, en espagne... on the other hand, you may here: j'habite québec (city) or j'habite au québec (province)...<br>  <br>  3) J'habite la chambre 450... is correct... and the same would apply if you gave a full address: j'habite le 450 de la rue Jean-Drapeau à Montréal... here, you need to have the preposition "à" in front of Montréal (name of a city) because you are referring to the street that is in montréal... for there may be other "jean-drapeau streets" elsewhere...<br>  <br>  4) il habite shanghai... the correct form when referring to a city...<br>  <br>  by the way, if you were saying that you lived in Cuba... being that Cuba is an island, you would have to say: j'habite Cuba... j'habite l'?le de Cuba... the same would apply to Ha?ti and Dominican Republic, although these two countries each represent half of the same island... if the name represents many islands (philippines, indonesia) you would then say: j'habite au philippines, en indonésie, but j'habite sumatra (for it refers to a specific island)...<br>  <br>  by the way, one interesting fact is the following... being from canada, the use of prepositions has not always been the same as it is today... in the days of colonisation (under french ruling), le french would refer to canada as a province and therefor would say: habiter en canada (habiter en province, provence, bretagne, normandie...) ... nowadays, it is appropriate to say: habiter au canada, for canada is considered a country with a masculine name...|`|Hfl0ujaGaa	"a" est une preposition.

Quand le Prophète conquit la mecque , il pardonna à tout le monde y compris les polytheistes, sauf deux categories: ceux qui ont gardé leurs armes pour intention de combats ou les fuyards. Ces deux catégories, le Prophète a recommandé qu'ils soient combattu par les armes à moins qu'ils viennent vers lui et déclarent la paix, et non se convertir de force comme tu dis. Ikrima Ibn Abi Jahl était parmi eux, c'est sa femme qui intercéda pour lui en lui faisant comprendre que le Prophète pardonne à celui qui vient vers lui. Ikrima est revenu vers le Prophète qui lui a effectivement pardonné. Il n'est devenu musulman que plut tard, le Prophète ne l'a pas forcé. <br>  <br>  Le Prophète est entré à la mecque et la majorité des Omeyades n'etait pas convertis. Pour adoucir leurs coeurs, le Prophète a fait une distinction à leur notable en disant "Celui qui entre dans la demeure de Abou Sofiane sera dans la paix" alors que Abou sofiane n'etait pas encore convertit. Si le Prophète imposait l'Islam avec la force, il aurait obligé de force ce qui restait des omeyades non convertis. Chose qu'il n'a jamais fait.<br>  <br>  Je te rappelle que les juifs de Khaibar sont restés longtemps après le Prophète dans leur ville, tout en étant 100% juifs. Il ne les a ni forcé à se convertir ni exterminé. Ils n'ont quité la ville que lors du Califat de Omar.<br>  <br>  @Scorpion: Apostasie !! Comment le Prophète aurait connu quelqu'un qui est sortit de lislam ?. Il ne peut le savoir, les gens pouvaient etre hypocrites, d'ailleurs ils le faiseint à Medine, et le Prophète savait que c'etait des hypocrites et n'a rien fait. Pire encore, il est allé prié sur leurs ames (tombes)  jusqu'à ce que Dieu l'en empecha.  Les gens qui sont sortis de l'Islam ont affiché l'animosité et ont brandit l'arme de combat contre la nation musulmane. Ils ont voulu revenir à la royauté que leur donné l'empire romain et perse dans la region. Ce n'est pas comme maintenant, devenir athée et vivre pacifiquement dans son etat musulman. Au temps du Prophete, la conjoncture etait differente, celui qui sort de l'Islam rejoint le clan ennemi agressif.

AA11324125	batmans hometown|`|RQtYkwXgaa	First off FroGgy an eArl, you are reffering to gothic... not goth.  They are seperate words.  Gothic is a descriptive term that came from the original term goth.  (Oh and the actual term for the original clothing style worn by the goths in the 70's to 80's was new romantic... it was taken from imitating the fashion style of the bands of the era.  Current fashion in goth clubs is actually quite varied.)<br>  <br>  Well lets see... goth was originally a term for several groups of people in europe (the ostrogoths and visigoths) that were conquered, and in turn sacked at various times the Roman empire...<br>  <br>  Due to this the term came to mean barbaric in germanic languages.<br>  <br>  Then a derivitive of the term started being applied to types of architecture and literature (gothic churchs and such) again in refference to being barbaric. <br>  <br>  Then in the late 70's a new form of post punk music came out, called positive punk, that some of the journalists called "goth" to be insulting to the music... and thus goth rock was born. (and the music subculture around it) And the word goth gained the defnition of being an avid fan/musician of goth rock who participates in the subculture.<br>  <br>  Goth rock bands would be:  Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, the Sisters of Mercy, The Mission (UK), London after Midnight, Fields of the Nephilim, Christian Death (the old band by that name), Joy Division, the Cult (Southern Death Cult), Xmal Deutschland, the Birthday Party, the Cruxshadows, Blutengel, Voltaire, the Last Dance, etc...<br>  <br>  The specific dictionary definitions for Goth are as follows:<br>  1. one of a Teutonic people who in the 3rd to 5th centuries invaded and settled in parts of the Roman Empire.  <br>  2. a person of no refinement; barbarian. <br>  3. a style of rock music, noted especially for somber or ethereal tones and lugubrious lyrics. <br>  4. a performer or follower of this style of music.|`|rvMxaNAraa	Goth refers to characteristics of a civilization of people that had of a style of architecture developed in northern France and spreading through western Europe from the middle of the 12th century to the early 16th century that is characterized by the converging of weights and strains at isolated points upon slender vertical piers and counterbalancing buttresses and by pointed arches and vaulting. <br>  The word Goth or Gothic today refers broadly to the mid-evil era. Dressing in away that is characterized today as Goth is just a word that was used to label it. The modern cloth style labeled Goth doesn't accurately represent the style of cloths the the Goth people wore in the mid-evil era but is just a modern label that was used to identify it. |`|AA10717870	Refusal to adhere to the status quo?

It's just a style of clothing just like prep or punk or tomboy. <br>  <br>  most goths wear a lot of black, but don't let that cloud your judgment. some goths wear colors that are bright, cybergoths. some wear victorian suits or dresses... I'm not sure what they are called. goth isn't all black, but it can be. it's like a cross between punk and emo... I could give you a list of outfits... for example:<br>  <br>  a white shirt with a black and green plaid shirt and a black+green plaid skirt w/ stud buckle... <br>  It's all about the eyeliner btw.<br>  Or bondage pants with a t-shirt of a heavy metal/ rock band.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just make sure that you know that GOTH IS NOT A WAY OF LIFE!!! It's simply a style of clothing and it is NOT a bad thing... If you see goths on the street, even if they look at you like they need a straightjacket, they won't hurt you or beat you up like a thug. they may insult you, but anyone could do that... preps insult others all the time. I am a goth, so I have a pretty good idea about them.<br>   |`|d1w8V4fgaa	Its a lot of things!

JXMpZiwxaa	I think some believers perceive atheists as arrogant because many atheists refuse to believe in God without proof.

It was however written by men who were living in a brutal time and this was there benchmark of society and then they were trying to explain the universe without the benefit of science so it is not surprising that certain things like creation have been disproved.  <br>  <br>  There seems to be a contradiction of everything "an eye for an eye" "though shalt not kill" or "a loving God" "a vengeful God"  etc. etc. so it is easy to justify anything if you ignore the contradiction.  <br>  <br>  Though this is also not surprising as it was written by so many different people often long after the events they described.  Then the catholic church chose from many more scriptures which to use according to the needs of the church at the time.<br>  <br>  No doubt there is some truth in the stories, it seems there was a great flood at one time, and it is probable Jesus did live but it is impossible to know what and how much of it is base on fact, when there is so little other writing that has survived or the church make available from the time. <br>  <br>  Even most Christians do now not take it all literally.|`|AA11225089	You need to have an extensive answer to a good question.

What you ask is a very complex question.  To dismiss the bible or the koran or any other of the ancient texts as 'crap' is to lose any value they hold.  They wouldn't inspire billions of people if that were true.  On the other hand, it is almost silly at some level that people argue these books have any divine component.  The bible is seriously flawed in its records and predictions.  Consider only Ezekiel 29-32 in which God predicts the future.  This is one of the few prophecies recorded ex ante.  Most prophecies in the bible were not recorded until decades after the even was over, making prediction very easy.  In Ezekiel, in a dated prophecy, he predicts Nebuchadnezzar would defeat Ahmose II and drive all Egyptian men from the land.  Instead Ahmose defeated Nebuchadnezzar and the defeat was so total that it haunted his reign as king for the rest of his life.<br>  <br>  The bible has literally hundreds of factual errors and tons of inconsistencies.  In a bible class I had once I was required to find the 46 irreconcilable differences in the resurrection accounts.  The issues are huge for it and all the ancient scriptures.  The danger of the bible is that the religious people really don't learn the lessons from it because it is necessary to dance around them to remain religious.|`|t3hlNh3paa	Inconsistent<br>  <br>  But that being said, one who doesn't read it literally can take out some lessons in life that can give them good rules to live by.

The remaining OT books were a product of tradition, and were not set down in writing until around 400 BC.<br>  <br>  Recent archaeological discoveries of ancient documents and sites have proved the biblical accounts to be highly reliable, even down to some very precise and minute details.<br>  <br>  The one thing that sets the Bible apart from all other writings is the prophecies that are contained within. <br>  <br>  And since the OT was written some 1500 to 400 years before Christ, one has to respect the accuracy of a book that found its' prophetic fulfillment in one obscure but obviously very special, itinerant Jewish carpenter from the town of Nazareth, with literally hundreds of ancient biblical prophecies being perfectly fulfilled during his 34 years.<br>  <br>  Most significant are those that came to pass during the last three days of his human life on earth.<br>  <br>  The New Testament of the Bible points out many of these prophetic fulfillments, explains their eternal significance and their practical application, using several different languages and precise detail that has been painstakingly set to writing, confirmed through authentic world history, and faithfully handed down by means of authentic Catholic Church tradition. <br>  <br>  The fact that today, we can go back and verify the authenticity of all those fulfilled prophecies also bolsters the Bible's claim to being divinely inspired.<br>  <br>  And since about a third of all Bible prophecies have yet to be fulfilled, dealing with future, end times events and personalities, the "best" is probably yet to come. <br>  <br>  I'm not merely cutting and pasting here.

It is fascinating to find how in the New Testament Jesus in particular refers frequently to the things that happened in the Old Testament writings. Jesus believed them.<br>  <br>  It is really worth reading as much as you can of the Bible and reading it more than once. At first you don't take it all in but it really is worth persisting with as it shows God's relationship with mankind and the offer of salvation to faithful believers. It really is a wonderful book of books.

mOWyzwubaa	see the difference,present day islam is divided into many sects each labeling other sect as Kafir (pagan) due to polytheistic teachings,of their respective retard scholars,had they adhered to Glorious Quran alone and Followed Quran Alone,they wouldnt have been divided|`|zBqt99avaa	Well....this is my take.<br>  <br>  In a polytheism, the gods had various traits, few of them good, ethical or altruistic.  It is only after Abraham that we find a religion, tied to one God, that encourages ethical behaviour in its adherents.<br>  <br>  One might argue that we have failed to act ethically, but that's another discussion.<br>  <br>  If you look at roman, greek or hindu gods, some of them might have good points, but by and large, they have serious human failings, and to a greater degree than humans.  Moreover, worshipping these gods was a requirement but not a path to salvation.  No one prayed to Hera for salvation.  You made your sacrifices, you observed the feasts, and that was that.  It was unimportant how you lived your life.<br>  <br>  We take such ideas as "Don't steal" and "Don't kill" for granted today but it wasn't always the case.  So, in that sense, we could say that by imposing a moral and ethical standard on those who accept it, monotheism has been a force for the good.  Again, I'm not saying monotheism was as successful as we might have liked in this regard, but it made some headway.<br>  <br>  That's the best I've got, based on the context you asked and the restrictions imposed.|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	Quran 109:6] To you be your Way, and to me mine.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Monotheism provides much better systems for becoming rigid and boneheaded, ploytheism is more conducive to pluralism and flexibility.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Monotheism is only superior if one is following the one true God...the great "I AM"....YHWH.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, one could simply form a monotheistic religion like Atenism (which has long gone extinct.)|`|VN30ib8eaa	People dont worship God for the 'benifit' of the society.|`|toSMrGviaa	Polytheism may have been better to follow, considering One God seems unable to handle the problems of the world.<br>  If there was more than one God worshipped, they could hand out the different tasks to each other and not be overburdened. <br>  Since Monotheism in Arab lands it's created more problems than solutions, when Polytheism was prevalent, the Jews and christians and arabs lived together, I guess that was because they had more Gods to help them out.|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam for you.Monotheism is seen as superior to P0lytheism because Monotheism is logic and it be practised since Adam and Eve who knew<br>  well the existence of Allah just only one in paradise (heaven).<br>  Polytheism is unlogic because if there are so many idols who govern this universe they will act their own superiority and  it will create the unharmonius and unsynchronized situation among them.  If this situation exist this universe will be collapsed.or destructed.or qiyamah.|`|sONOvYeTaa	That depends on the belief system you have been brought in.<br>  <br>  A person brought with Polytheism will like his and one brought up in Monotheism will like his.<br>  <br>  And I have to agree with OMAR X, Polytheists are more tolerant towards others belief system. They already have so many Gods that adding an extra one will not make any difference.|`|CTM29j3Aaa	I asked a similar question.

"Do as you will but harm no one" - essentially it's a relationship with Satan and wherever that leads.  Worship, ritual and black magick are all involved, and it is a path of great freedom as opposed to the ways of conventional religion which are so full of rules.

Probably that we worship Mary and the saints (we DON'T!). Or that we believe unbaptized babies that die end up in hell, or that all non-Catholics go to Hell. (Both completely incorrect.) Oh, and then there's the very laughable idea that Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works, or that we're a half-Pagan abomination to God. <br>  <br>  Here's what we Catholics believe, as briefly as I can state it. <br>  <br>  God is God. God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, three in one, just like the shamrock which is three leaves with one stem. <br>  <br>  Jesus Christ is the only Son of God. He is fully man and fully divine at the same time. His mother was the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was born full of grace (hence Gabriel greeting her with "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.") and that she deserves the title Mother of God, for to deny Mary her title is to deny Jesus His (hence why Elizabeth greeted her thusly: "Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of  thy womb! But who am I, that the mother of my Lord should come to visit me? For from the moment that your greeting reached my ears, the babe within my womb leaped with joy.")<br>  <br>  We believe that Mary and the saints should be honored for their righteous lives, and that, upon their entry into Heaven, God gave them the ability to hear the petitions of those of us on earth, and the ability to pray for us. <br>  <br>  We believe that faith, grace, and works are needed, all together, for salvation, for this is what Christ taught us. <br>  <br>  We believe that Christ MEANT it when He said "This is my body" and "This is my blood." Had He meant Communion to be purely symbolic, He would have said so. To say that Christ meant other than what He said is to call him a liar, and blasphemous. <br>  <br>  We believe that when Christ said, in Matthew 16:17-19, "Amen, I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I shall build my Church. I shall give to you the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. Whatsoever you hold true on earth, I shall hold true in Heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven," He meant that, too. And that means that Christ established Peter as head of the Apostles, as the first Pope, and that, yes, the Church that He founded right there is the one that can trace its leadership back to Peter and, therefore, to Christ. That Church is the Roman Catholic Church. <br>  <br>  We believe in the dignity of human life, from conception until NATURAL death, and so we are against abortion and the death penalty, as well as euthanasia, also known as assisted suicide. <br>  <br>  We believe that we should pray often and worship God without ceasing. This is most easily done by simply offering everything you do up to God and by praising Him with your words and your actions. Worship belongs ONLY to God in all three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but that honor belongs not only to God, but to Mary and the saints for their roles in the history of Christianity. There IS a difference!|`|oE0ApHqPaa	I like this question!<br>  <br>  I'm an atheist.  I believe in nothing.  Occasionally it makes me sad that I don't have faith and all the things that come with it, like an instant family in church members and a comforting expectation of an afterlife, but I know exactly what I do and do not believe.<br>  <br>  It bothers me when people think that I have no morals.

And again,  “The LORD will judge His people.” 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.<br>  32 But recall the former days in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great struggle with sufferings: 33 partly while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations, and partly while you became companions of those who were so treated; 34 for you had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods, knowing that you have a better and an enduring possession for yourselves in heaven. 35 Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. 36 For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise:<br>         37 “ For yet a little while,<br>        And He who is coming will come and will not tarry.<br>         38 Now the just shall live by faith;<br>        But if anyone draws back,<br>        My soul has no pleasure in him.”<br>  <br>   39 But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.|`|DiIAaFgzaa	1  Love God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.<br>  <br>  2  Love your neighbor as yourself.<br>  <br>  If you do those 2 things completely, you will be completely obedient to God's 10 Commandments|`|JXfGHsF6aa	Mat 22:37-40 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

Live as children of light  9  (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)  10  and find out what pleases the Lord.  11  Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.<br>  <br>  Temptation always starts in your thought life even if it is actuated by something that you see or hear.<br>  <br>  James 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. 14 But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. 15 Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.<br>  <br>  James gives the progression of temptation in a person. It starts out when you have a desire and are enticed to have that desire met in an ungodly manner. Your mind starts to conceive a plan on how to get that desire satisfied. You have to stop temptation at one of those two points, 1) recognizing that you are tempted to sin, or 2) recognizing that somewhere in your mind you are fantasizing about a way to indulge that temptation.<br>  <br>  When Paul wrote about overcoming temptation he didn't say that we should think about the crucifixtion. Instead he had these tactics to recommend.<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 10:4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ,<br>  <br>  Romans 13:13 Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in strife and envy. 14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.<br>  <br>  You take those tempting thoughts captive and remind your self about what God has to say about the temptation and accept God's Word as truth that you are going to live by. You don't put your self in danger of not being able to resist temptation by going into temptation's neighborhood like to a drinking party or some other place where you know that temptation lies in wait for you. You don't make "provision for the flesh". That is, you don't try to justify why something God says is wrong isn't really all that bad and think ahead to how you can arrange circumstances so that in your own mind giving in to the temptation is reasonable to do.<br>  <br>  Paul told us to put on the whole armor of God and don't forget to call on the Lord in prayer so that you can be strong in Him against temptation.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. <br>  <br>  12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. <br>  <br>  13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. <br>  <br>  14 Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; <br>  <br>  16 above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. <br>  <br>  17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.<br>  <br>  Jesus demonstrated how to use the sword of the Spirit to overcome temptation when He was tempted by the Devil.|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	I trust that what the Holy Spirit has begun in me that He is more than able to finish.

So, if you're gonna take away the deed/thing/etc that's sinful, replace it with something that will strengthen the person.

If they turned the lights up and pumped out some of the smoke, you could see her a lot better and realize that you probably shouldn't be as tempted as you are.<br>  <br>  So I agree... turn up the light to help reduce the chance of being tempted by a wolverine.|`|c819af3af49d8b8d19675e0d6c66de9daa	Same way everyone else overcomes it.

It's the way men were saved, so there's no point in opposing cross and light. This "gospel of light" takes all its strength and validity from the cross, and the cross is more than a horrible and disgusting death because there is light in it and in its goal. |`|bd1146a8eabf807f844df323db88aad2aa	Christians have a problem with "temptation" because they are taught to fear their god.

2509779805db68e9ed8f286e83d10b4eaa	The term "to be with Jesus" is more of a religious term to many than a reality to them. Because they do not think on these terms much in their day 2 day lives. <br>  <br>  But to answer your Q,  Christianity has only been around 2000 years. And yes He does have a large crowd around Himself. Yes we get to spend our own time with Him alone, (We have forever to do that) so if each person has to with 10,000 years it would not matter because in heaven there is no time. No there is only one Jesus, just as there is only one you.  And as far as the stage thing, i do not know. But it does not matter in the light of the rest of the eternity <br>  <br>  So, "to be with Jesus" means more like this, "to be free of earths bounds (sickness, tiredness, aging, worries) then it does to be the man Jesus. But He WILL be there and we will get to meet the most famus man to ever live and be able to see Him face to face. and ask Him all the things we wonder about. You know, things like; where do ink pens go?

As with the mouth we confess that Christ is Lord and Saviour and with  our heart we believe that God raised Him from the dead.|`|UTf0EBF4aa	He is real to me.|`|rUjQM1biaa	Yes he is real but not a god He is <br>  <br>  <br>  MUCH OF THE Old Testament is devoted to describing the origins and early history of the Hebrew people. According to the Bible, the Hebrews descended from a clan which lived in the Sumerian city of Ur around 2000 to 1500 B.C. The clan was befriended and ruled by a personality named Jehovah. The Bible claims that Jehovah was God. <br>  <br>  According to the Biblical narrative, Jehovah encouraged the clan to leave Ur and settle in Haran—a caravan center in northeastern Mesopotamia. There, Jehovah later told the clan’s new patriarch, Abraham, to lead his tribe on a migration towards Egypt. The tribe complied, and over the ensuing generations it slowly made its way through Canaan towards the Nile River. Starvation finally forced the tribe to enter the Egyptian region of Goshen where the Hebrew sat first lived well under the pharaoh, but upon the coming of a new king to the Egyptian throne, the Hebrews were forced into slavery. <br>  <br>  The Bible states that after four hundred years of servitude in Egypt, the Hebrews were led on an exodus out of Egypt by Moses under the watchful eye of Jehovah. By that time, the Hebrews numbered in the hundreds of thousands. After a long trek and many bloody battles, the Hebrew tribes returned to and conquered Canaan, which was the “Promised Land” pledged to them centuries earlier by Jehovah. <br>  <br>  And so, according to the Bible, was born the Jewish religion.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jehovah was clearly an important character in this Biblical story. Who was he? Was Jehovah God, as the Bible alleges? Was he a myth, as skeptics with a secular orientation would have us believe? Jehovah appears to have been neither. <br>  <br>  The name Jehovah comes from the Hebrew word “Yahweh,” meaning “he that is” or “the self-evident.” This appellation conveys the idea that the Biblical Jehovah was a pure spiritual being; a true Supreme Being, if you will. But was he? <br>  Old Testament descriptions of Jehovah have provided afield day for UFO writers, and for good reason. Jehovah travelled through the sky in what appears to have been a noisy, smoking aircraft. <br>   <br>  Early human writers often portrayed mankind’s Custodial “Gods” as bloodthirsty creatures prone to excessive violence. Sadly, those lamentable qualities did not improve with Jehovah. During the trek from Egypt to the Promised Land, Jehovah demanded unflagging obedience from the Hebrews. Many humans rebelled and Jehovah reacted with extreme cruelty. Jehovah reportedly killed up to 14,000 Hebrews at a time for disobedience. He used a variety of killing methods, such as spreading diseases, just as other Custodial “Gods” had done earlier in Sumeria. <br>  <br>  A Biblical description of Jehovah landing on a mountaintop describes him this way: <br>  . .. there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the sound of the trumpet was exceedingly loud;* and all of the people that were in the camp trembled.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible points out that no one was permitted to approach Jehovah’s mountaintop landing sites except Moses and a few select leaders. Jehovah had threatened to kill anyone else who tried. The early Bible therefore contains only descriptions of Jehovah as eyewitnesses saw him from a distance. It was not until much later that one of the Bible’s most famous prophets, Ezekiel, was able to get a closer look and describe Jehovah in greater detail. <br>  Now it occurred in my thirtieth year, in the fourth month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. <br>  And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire flashed, causing a brightness about it, and out of the midst of it gleamed something like a pale yellow metal. <br>  Also out of the midst of it appeared four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of men. <br>  And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was shaped like the sole of a calf s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass. <br>  And they had human hands under their four-sided wings. Their wings were joined together; and they did not turn when they went, they all went straightforward.<br>  As for the appearance of their faces, they had the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side: and they had the face of an ox on the left side: they also had the face of an eagle. <br>  In amongst the living creatures glowed something like coals of fire or lamps, which moved up and down between the creatures: and the fire was bright, and from out of the fire flashed lightning. <br>  And the living creatures ran and returned by flashes of lightning. <br>  Now as I looked upon the living creatures, I saw four wheels upon the ground, one by each of the living creatures, with their four faces. <br>  The appearance of the wheels and their composition was like the color of shiny amber: and all four wheels had one likeness: and their appearance and their composition was like a wheel in the middle of a wheel. <br>  And wh|`|iQZpv42raa	Fake as any god|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	He is real.

I mean honestly he DID pray...."Father remove this from me".  She is also the one that said...this is it darlin', you've made the choice to serve Jesus and when you take a bite out of Him you can't let go!  Lock those jaws and have BULL DOG faith.  Faith that just won't let loose.  No matter what the circumstances, or how you "feel".  Serve HIM....when it dosen't make sense.....serve HIM......when your heart is broken.....serve HIM.  <br>  <br>  Years later, I have hung on those words more times than I can count.    <br>  <br>  There are just times its NOT about how we feel, its abou the calm assurance that GOD IS GOD and We DESPERATLY NEED Him.<br>  <br>  I actually get a bit peeved when I hear stories about the earth shaking and angels appearing and someones heart just exploding in joyious song - he he  he maybe Im jealous.  It just didnt happen that way for me......but it did for my hubby! lol<br>  <br>  I will say this you MUST know that SALVATION is immediate....its just this miracle that occurs immediatly.  BUT!!!  Sanctification is a process.  Sort of like taking a bath.  You jump in the tub and thats it your IN...but the process of getting clean takes some time.   Sanctification is slower and is step by step.  As you get closer to God, HE draws closer to you.  (thats one of His promises)  The more time you invest in Him, the more those "feelings" will change.  (Thats why your minister says "READ THE BIBLE" - He knows that not everyone has those WOW salvation expierences.)  <br>  <br>  Now, thats not to say that all times are perfect....but in the imperfect times you have a Peace that Passes all of Mans Understanding!<br>  <br>  And even though you didnt "feel" it....All of Heaven was rejoicing - that you.

Jesus is God :) When you believe, then you ARE going to heaven, guaranteed! Salvation is a FREE GIFT! <br>  <br>  The only way to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to hell, is by believing that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.

The first time when I was approximately 5 years old. With all the wonder of a young child, the moment felt very holy. I grew up without having any learning or Christian education and my life showed it. It wasn't until I was in my 20's that I prayed the prayer of salvation. I remember not feeling anything at all. But as Christian's we don't walk by our feelings, we walk by faith in God and if God said we became a new creature in Christ - that's exactly what happened. Our spiritual essence was transformed and continues to be transformed daily. Today I not only feel different but am different thanks to the power of God that lives inside of me. <br>  <br>  Some people do feel something when they pray the prayer of salvation, and some don't. Remember, that God created us all differently, and it's very possibly that the one's that "feel" something may be people who are very sensitive to their emotions or to spiritual things. Or possibly, they need to see the evidence of change more than others. Faith, the Bible tells us is the evidence of things not seen. (Read Hebrews 11:1) And in Hebrews 10:38 it states the the righteous man lives by faith. When Jesus went to the cross, He wasn't feeling it. He prayed in the garden of Gethsemanee that if it was the Father's will, to take the mission away from him. We know the rest of the story. He exchanged His life for our sins so that we could experience newness of life. Your have taken the first step of faith and God will reward you. (He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. - Hebrews 11:6) As you yield your life to God, He will lead you and guide you AND the BEST part is that He promises never to leave you. Thanks for putting your question out there into the forum. I'm sure that your question has helped to strengthen many in the community

l2qtG4yfaa	I find it a little annoying, not the actual word but mainly the people who use the word are already annoying. Mainly 12-13 yr. old girls and guys trying to seem cool.<br>  Hecka seems 10 times more annoying<br>  I'm glad it is (hella) not popular in my area, I only see it on the internet and very rarely on tv shows.|`|qkmsixWXaa	Maybe it sounds a little uneducated. I personally don't like it, it just doesn't sound right to me.|`|GQo7Uqndaa	I mainly hear people from Florida or California saying that word. Where I live in MA, nobody that I know says that.

D4jZM26Paa	What the above 2 said is correct, but 'Kosher' is a Jewish concept, the Islamic equivalent is 'Halal' the opposite being 'Haraam'.|`|khdFNlJ7aa	I don't think the proper word is Kosher. It is Halal, that you mean. I am a big Fan of Cat Stevens and now most of his songs are mainly worship songs.

They take care of us and teach us right from wrong.  This is true even if we don't always care for the methods.<br>  <br>  As we get older, the threats and risks we face grow to massive proportions and we realize that our fathers are just men like us.  Rather than face reality on our own, some of us choose to invent a "Father" who is capable of assisting us through means we aren't advanced enough to understand.  God is a way of hiding from reality.|`|waz8ONEEaa	my invisible pink dragon exists. can you see it? then why don't you believe in it?<br>  <br>  what is only in your mind, cannot be proven.<br>  <br>  the government locks up people who talk to invisible friends, or hear voices from invisible friends.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	He doesn't.

iHDYncuXaa	Yes, Jesus loves you! The bible tells you so.|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	The beginning with Autumn and Eve and yes I'm pretty sure Jesus loves you.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Yes.  .Find a Bible-believing church to attend.  Singing songs of  praise is a good way to worship.  And talk to Him about whatever is on your mind, but be respectful.  As a new Christian almost 30 years ago, I read the Gospel of Matthew first and it has always been my favorite.  I recommend staying in the New Testament,  Psalms, Proverbs and Genesis for a while.  Welcome to God's family. <br>  John 3:16|`|L0R92wWeaa	The best way of worship, is letting him live through you. Letting him control your desires, and guide your life. It is accepting him as a savior, and confessing your sins. Jesus loves you, and def. has an awesome plan for your life, if you just accept him. By letting him live through you, you become more joyful, patient, and kind, its like having a small piece of god.I would start in the gospels..it doesn't really matter (matthew, mark, luke, john). All four tell about Jesus life, just from different authors.  Mark is the shortest, but its really good!|`|ojwRgCLqaa	Jesus loves you. He loves everyone. <br>  You can just pray at home. or maybe join a specific religion. All you probably have to do is take a few classes about them.|`|lDbNf3h9aa	Try the sites below.|`|Xl7UHNB1aa	Jesus loves all, and worship can be done in any form, place, etc... Start with Genesis the beginning.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	Absolutely!  <br>  <br>  Can you just talk to him (in your mind if you prefer), telling him about the things that concern you?  Then when things are too hard to put into words, you can just mentally say the Jesus Prayer: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son oF God, have mercy on us."<br>  <br>  As for where to start reading the Bible, there are many plans available for reading it.  If you have a daily devotional book or magazine, you can simply read the passages listed in it for each day.   You might want to check off (probably in pencil) the passages you read,  and fill in any gaps in the schedule of readings (known as the lectionary).  <br>  The site  listed below may help, or your own denomination may have a schedule of readings that it recommends.<br>  <br>  Finally, just ignore any "scoffomoric'" answers you may receive from non-believers.  (But pray for those people. :) )|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Yes, and read the 4 gospels first... and if time is short, read the Sermon on the Mount.. since that is the heart of the whole thing. And in that sermon on the Mount is the secret of how to pray properly (how to worship in Spirit)<br>  <br>  If you need a way to sort through all the confusing church theology you hear these days, this is a great help: <a href="http://gospelenigma.com" rel="nofollow">http://gospelenigma.com</a> That free resource focuses on what Christ himself was teaching... and that is why I recommend it.|`|YQM3evnsaa	Praying isnt just talking. When you pray you should feel it from within. Talk issues that your dealing with in life, and really spill your heart out to god. When it comes to reading the bible read what part you want too.|`|UTf0EBF4aa	Walk like Jesus walked. Id start with the book of John in the new testement since it talks about the life of jesus.<br>  <br>  Ill see you in heaven new believer.|`|jGpbOtzSaa	Yes of couse he does.<br>  Go to church every Sunday.<br>  Start at any part of the Bible. It dosen't matter.<br>  All of it is good.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	He might have but unfortunately he died two thousand years ago.|`|67EaIAvbaa	yes..just ask him and he will.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	no<br>  <br>  you don't<br>  <br>  don't read the bible|`|RvddYKqjaa	Yes, he does indeed. <br>  You can pray by talking to him like you would a friend. The Lord's Prayer is a good daily prayer. <br>  Read through the second half of the Bible, or the New Testament. This is where you will learn more about Jesus, especially in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. And I agree with Hmmm..The Psalms are good to read too.|`|fspkWzttaa	jesus isnt real. according to the bible, mary didnt know how she got pregnant so he doesnt have a father. hes not a real person without a father. if not, his mom is a crazy alcoholic with alzheimers so dont worry about "jesus". worry about yourself|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Yes.  And so does His mother, Mary. I'd recommend praying through Mary.  She is our most powerful intercessor and can pray to God more effectively than we can ourselves.<br>  <br>  The rosary is explained here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/rosary/how_to.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13.

Try being accepting of those who are different than you.|`|dF5clN4daa	Humble yourself before God (in a nutshell)<br>  <br>  Pride is the thorn in everybody's flesh... We all see ourselves better than we really are.  Do you think about your sin nature?  How sin permeates every aspect of your being?  The first spark that fires off every thought in your mind is exceedingly sinful.  Man's heart is desperately wicked.  And just when you start to think "Hmm.. I'm not so bad" and ignore your sin nature for just one moment then pride will take hold of you like a slavemaster, dragging you back into rebellion against God.  God hates sin and so we must hate sin as well.  It's a difficult battle though.  Sin will seek to reign in our mortal bodies all the days of our life.  It's like the Apostle Paul said in Romans Chapter 7 "O wretched man that I am".  A true repentant christian will see his sin for what it really is.|`|fz8PCFRgaa	Well Kati Beth, it is very simple.

Great men of God committed their life to the Lord at an early age too, God will continue to bless you and the Holy Spirit will also guide and teach you.  God Bless<br>  <br>  The problem is that we can not train the flesh to live the Christian life. Why? The Flesh can not please God. "For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God" (Romans 8:5-8).<br>  <br>  So what are some of the things Christians can do to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord?  Here are some verses below that I hope help you to overcome the flesh. <br>  <br>  First,we are to make no provision for the flesh."But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof" (Romans 13:14).<br>  <br>  Second, we are to bring the flesh under subjection. This means that we are to make the flesh a slave to God. Paul wrote to the carnal church of Corinth, "But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway" (I Corinthians 9:27). We should see that we are either serving God or we are serving the flesh (self). Jesus therefore said, "No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.<br>  <br>  Third, we are to take off the old man and put on the new. Paul wrote to the Ephesian church, <br>  "That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness" (Ephesians 4:22-24).<br>  <br>  Fourth, we are to deny the flesh. Listen to the words of Jesus. "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Matthew 16:24-26).<br>  <br>  Fifth, we are to mortify the members of the flesh. "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry" (Colossians 3:1-5). We are to focus our attention on what God would have us do, and we are to put to death those things that lead to death.<br>  <br>  Sixth, we are to reckon the flesh crucified. Paul wrote to the performance oriented, Corinthian church, "And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit" (Galatians 5:24-25). We are to consider it a past experience. When we, as Believers, committed our lives to Jesus, we were spiritually united with Jesus. Therefore, when Jesus died, we died. When Jesus was raised from the dead, we were also raised from the dead. Paul explains, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:6-11). We should know that we have been crucified! We should understand this, acknowledge this, believe this, and confess this truth.<br>  <br>  Seventh, we are to live an exchanged life. We are not to prop up the old man and try to fix the flesh, but we are to exchange our old life for the new life in Christ. "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me" (Galatians 2:20).

In fact, it has saved my life on more than one occasion. They say that to have a pure heart gives you the strength of ten... I say the only way to have this strength is to have and use righteous anger or the power of unconditional LOVE!

I do not understand righteous anger or unrighteous anger and see no benefit in labeling it one way or another.  The important thing for me is not to deny it or judge it but to feel it.  Anger is an opportunity to examine the thoughts that travel with it and to see whether there is a way to see things differently.  It is important for me to see that anger happens rather than to identify with "I am angry"  Seen for what it is anger simply arises and subsides as part of our existence and being,  It is my choice whether I use it as tool to effect change or as another thing to blame and add fuel to whatever dysfunctional story I may like to be attached.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	You ask, ". . . is there such a thing as real self righteous anger?"  I would say that anger is always "self righteous", it is a response to feeling our will has been transgressed.  I think you are asking if there is such a thing as "righteous anger".  In this case, I don't think it makes sense to label qualities of anger.  Anger is anger, it is an emotional faculty.  How we should react to it is dependent of context.  For instance, if there is a bad smell, most people won't run outside screaming.  You will most likely think, "Hmm, there is an unpleasant smell.  Is something rotten?  Did the dog fart?"  Likewise, if you are angry, you should think, "Hmm, I'm angry.  Why am I angry?  Bill ate my bacon?  I must really like bacon . . ."  It doesn't necessarily mean you should attack someone.  Conversely, if what you smell is the house burning down, then you SHOULD run out of the house, and if you're angy because someone's life is in danger then you should probably do something about that too.  My point is that anger is an emotional sense, there is no need to identify with it or assign it greater attributes.  So to answer your last question, anger is certainly often a motivation for change, but to know whether or not that change is appropriate requires judgement, not anger alone.|`|AA12391873	Felt anger is an opportunity to awaken.<br>  <br>  Anger always tells us about ourselves. It is neither negative nor positive, It is an energy movement usually experienced as a deep "no" to what is. The most beneficial choice to make when anger arises is to stay calm and just observe it within. Expressing anger towards others is the egos first reaction, this only strengthens the illusion of separation. <br>  <br>  Only once one is skilled at observing the anger within will one begin to realize the true cause of it. Once the message is received the anger will dissipate leaving realization in it's wake.<br>  <br>  When one is confronted with an unacceptable situation in life what one feels may be anger that feels self righteous.

Like, "Come on everyone, i'm tired of all the shenanigans, let's just relax, kick up our feet, and chill out!"<br>  <br>  The truth, though, is that... while most want to look out at the world and blame it for our "anger" and/or "exhaustion," the real culprit is... (take a wild guess!)  ;-)<br>  <br>  Just my two pence worth! ;-)<br>  <br>  BELOW is an excerpt is from a Seth book called "Seth Speaks." And it is from within an ESP Class where Seth was speaking to students in the class.<br>  <br>  This section of the session is about agner. (Sorry it is long.....)<br>  <br>  ""<br>  (Bert C. spoke of relating to oneself and to others.)<br>  Seth:: Until you are honest with yourself and become consciously aware of yourself, you cannot honestly relate with others; you will project upon them your own fears and prejudices. You cannot afford to help them because you have too many insecurities within yourself. Now, you form the physical reality that you know, individually and en masse. To change your world you must change your thoughts. You must become consciously aware of what you tell yourself is true every moment of the day, for that is the reality that you project outward.<br>  <br>  (Bert C.: "It sounds like a life-long task just to work out the first half of that, before you can begin to relate to others.")<br>  Seth:: It is, indeed. However, telepathy does exist. Others are aware, then, to a large extent of what you are thinking and feeling.<br>  <br>  (Bert C.: "My true feelings, despite what I might project consciously?")<br>  Seth:: The true feelings do not necessarily imply the violent or aggressive feelings. They also imply the feelings of love and acceptance that are buried beneath your own fears, and those that you are terrified of expressing in physical reality.<br>  <br>  (Bert C.: "I think I understand then, that all of the different levels of my consciousness are being communicated -- not only by me consciously, but also telepathically.")<br>  Seth:: That is true. When you project your ideas outward, you often behave as if they were not yours but belonged to another Therefore it behooves you to understand what your ideas and feelings are, and not to be frightened of them.<br>  <br>  (Jim H. told of finding a man asleep at his work. Jim explained his ideas and emotions concerning the incident, and wanted to know how he could change them.)<br>  Seth:: You can indeed change them, but do not deny the part of you that wanted to wring the other man's neck. You were so frightened of the thought that you immediately inhibited it. Let us consider. You are terrified of the idea that evil is more powerful than good, that one stray violent thought of yours was more important and powerful than the vitality of good. At least you were aware of the thought. Now say the following happened, that in your terms you progressed to the point where you were no longer aware of the feeling--<br>  <br>  (Jim H.: "You don't just automatically think good things about this fellow, and repress the negative thoughts without becoming aware of what you felt.")\<br>  Seth:: Of course, so your muscles tensed, your adrenalin production increased. You wanted to wring his neck but you said, "God bless you, my fine young fellow. May you live a long merry life."<br>  <br>  Telepathically, our fine young fellow knew exactly what you were feeling. You were out of contact with your feelings. At this point of your spiritual progression, you only imagined that you wished him good. The muscles were already contracted in your body because you did not admit your true feelings.<br>  <br>  Now three weeks later we have another encounter. Our poor ignorant workman again falls asleep at his chores. Our good minister comes by. He sees the idle one upon the floor snoozing, and he thinks, "I would like to kick you in the you-know-where." But then, "Oh no, I cannot think such an unchristian thought. Violence is wrong." So before he even admits to himself what he feels, hiding any acknowledgment of aggression, he bends down and says, "My good man, may you live long and heartily. God bless your life." He pats himself upon the back and thinks, "I am growing more spiritual day by day."<br>  <br>  In the meantime, his muscles have contracted ten times because they could not be put into activity, as the thought behind them was denied. Our poor man is again aware of the intent, but only to some degree.<br>  <br>  Three months later you have had a really bad day. You are mad at life in general, and now you find our friend upon the floor again; this time, perhaps, he is asleep at a somewhat more important chore that you wanted done. (humorously): Now far be it from me to accuse you of such an act, even in a fantasy, but this time you are out of your mind. Again, it behooves you to deny your true feelings in order to be spiritual -- which is not true spirituality -- and you say again, "God bless you, may you go in peace."<br>  <br>  This time the psychic safety net valve has had too much. The nicest thing that could happen would be that you suddenly blew your stack and kicked him. The worst thing that could happen would be that once again you restrain the acknowledgment of the pent up, perfectly natural aggression that is now ready to explode -- so you send out a thought-form out of all proportion to any of the events that have transpired. The thought-form causes your friend severe harm; and all of this because you were afraid that one stray aggressive thought of yours was more powerful than the vitality that resides in each of you.<br>  <br>  (Jim H.:" "In the beginning, before we compounded the frustration and the emotional charges, would you have recommended an action like saying. 'Come on, this is wrong. I've probably done this sort of thing myself, but it really bugs me. We have to get up and get back to work here.' Would being honest with him at that level have prevented these charges?")<br>  Seth:: Yes. The most important thing, however, is to acknowledge the feeling as legitimate, with its own realm of existence, to admit it as a part of yourself. Then choose how you want to deal with it. You do not make others the brunt of your anger; anger is merely a method of communication.<br>  <br>  (Jim H.: "I don't want to direct the brunt of my anger at either of us. One, I don't want to kick him. Two, I don't want to hurt myself in some way.")<br>  Seth:: Originally you were not angry enough to kick him. The thought existed, but it wasn't strong enough to bring about the physical reaction even if you had fully admitted it. Do you follow me?<br>  <br>  (Jim H.: "Yes. I want to learn how to handle such feelings, without trying to repress them.")<br>  Seth:: You should first of all admit that the feelings exist as a part of yourself, at the ego level. Whenever you close your feelings off from yourself you are, in your terms, less alive. Then, as far as is possible, communicate those feelings verbally in whatever way you choose. Use anger as a method of communication. Often it will lead to results that you do not think of, and beneficial ones.<br>  <br>  You certainly understand that I am doing with your case the same thing that I have done with others, so please do not be offended. I do not want any of you, you see, to use ideas as superficial bandages for your bleeding psyches...So you are not as bad as I pegged you. You might be inclined in the direction I have indicated, but then so is everyone else...<br>  <br>  (Jim H.: "Now would you define bad in that context?")<br>  Seth:: I do not define bad. When I use the term it is according to your own definition. You have an idea that good is gentle and bad is violent . This is because in your mind violence and destruction are the same thing. By this analogy, you see, the soft voice is the holy voice and the loud voice is the wicked one, and a strong desire is the bad desire and a weak desire the good one. You become afraid of projecting ideas or desires outward, for in the back of your mind you think that what is powerful is evil.<br>  <br>  Instead, I am telling you that the universe is a good universe. It knows its own vitality and that vitality is within you. You can encourage it freely. Your own nature is a good nature and you can trust it...|`|AnRTn8yAaa	Being angry is human, like being sad or happy. Jesus also got mad when He saw the sellers in front of His father house....so it's all right to be angry- as long as in control.<br>  <br>  God bless us all!|`|EZyHOht7aa	Anger is a normal human emotion. What kind of God would judge you for that?|`|24H5tznkaa	I think that anger is a very important emotion. I just now answered a question about depression and said how anger can help one to come out of it.<br>  <br>  When someone is depressed, they can't get angry, they don't have it in them. True depression is apathy. If one can rise up to sadness, they can then rise up to anger. Anger is a powerful emotion. It can be the catalyst for positive change because it makes you feel, it gets your blood going, it wakes up your primal survival instincts...it can wake you up in general.<br>  <br>  Lashing out at someone in anger, I don't think is right. When I am mad at someone, I let myself be angry but I go away from them. I sit with my anger and let it do it's thing and eventually, that anger dissipates and other emotions take it's place. But I recognize that it's a process....I just think that the 'anger' part of the process should be a personal one. <br>  <br>  I don't think anyone should feel our anger if we can help it. Of course that is the ideal but anger is so powerful and primal, you have to keep an eye on it because it can so easily hurt others. <br>  <br>  The book Ask and It Is Given by Jerry and Esther Hicks talks about this a little. They have this concept of an emotional ladder that you can climb up, so to speak and anger is on the way up the ladder because it is so full of power, it can propel you to better emotions. <br>  <br>  I don't think that anger is good or bad. I think that if one starts to feel angry, there is always a valid reason. It is often times misplaced and we find ourselves getting angry about little things but the true source of anger is always important. I think our body is signaling something to us when we get angry, we just have to pinpoint where the anger is really coming from and then let the process take over from there. <br>  <br>  And spiritually speaking :) I think it does something for the chakras, I think that it gets rid of blockages...maybe that's really where anger comes from, a blocked root chakra. ;)|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Sorry, didn't hear the song.  Just my Spiritual perspective on "anger."  It is so very wrong to have it listed as 1 of the 7 deadly sins.  We are created in the image of our Creator.  Thus our emotions are a reflection of the Creator too.  Scripture is full of when "God" was angered.  Why?  B/C anger is there to tell us a violation has occurred.   Now it's up to us to respond appropriately to that violation.  Anger is the feeling.  Yelling, fighting, abusing, etc. is the over reaction to the feeling. But yes, the proper response can propel on our correct course. / Example:  In my employment years I had made a name of honesty for myself in a rather corrupt industry.  The only reason I received promotions is b/c my clients demanded it from my bosses b/c they weren't going to have a low level employee manage their account.  My boss had basically asked me to falsify data that was due in court the next day.  I played dumb & asked why the different format?  I kept asking questions w/o calling him out. Finally, in frustration, he told me to go back to my office & give him the work he needed or he could find someone else, within 5 min. to produce the work he needed from my office.  I was outraged!  (Inside)  Out side, I said, "Your right.  I only need 5 min. to clear out."  I went to my office grabbed a box & began filling my belongings.  He even taunted me over the cubicles shouting down each min.  I stopped him at 3 min.warning & told him I was ready to leave.  He ran from his office, saw mine clear, stuttered & said, "Oh!  I thought we were just playing.  No put your stuff back.  Your busy.  I'll give the report to someone else."  /  He was a tyrant, but from that day forward, he never bothered me AND asked me to do stuff instead of ordering me around like others. / I felt that God had helped me b/c I was willing to trust Him w/ my integrity (an aspect of my life that I was working on at the time).|`|sWLRSa6Caa	Seems to me that "self-righteous" anger (which is pious and moralistic) is an extreme form of identification with something or something and, therefore, ego-driven...a case of judgment or reaction based on self-identification when an "other" is deemed to have wronged oneself or another...for instance someone smudges the fresh nail polish just given by your manicurist, or your best friend flirts with your significant other, or someone doesn't keep a promise that you were counting on, or another driver dangerously cuts you off in traffic.  In these instances it is the ego that pushes you to feel personally attacked and to react in an extreme manner.<br>  <br>  Then there is "righteous" anger in which we are being guided by discernment...the ability to know when something is not right, with the emotion (anger) being the tip off.  For instance, perhaps a favorite relative is killed by a drunken driver, or your life savings are stolen by a trusted friend, or you see a child being abused, or your spouse has an ongoing affair, or you see, while watching the news, horrifying atrocities being committed with masses of people being starved or killed.  These are matters of discernment, and anger seems justified. <br>  <br>  Yet, ego identification can still take place in the "discerned" scenarios if taken personally, or if the anger is carried to an extreme and revenge is sought, rather than forgiveness and right action, if action is required.  If you were to encounter an old man being robbed and beaten, anger would impel you to intervene...discernment has shown you that the situation is unacceptable.  But, if anger arises based on your own past (someone you knew was also badly beaten during a robbery), and out of that experience, even though it was second-hand, you carry resentment toward those who prey on others, then the anger is certainly self-identifying with the situation and, thus, bringing up "revenge" feelings so that you attack the attacker with rage and vehemence, then the ego is in charge.<br>  <br>  A better way, of course, is to remain detached from the people and the situation, feel compassion, and act righteously to prevent harm to another (physical, emotional, or mental harm). while at the same time being fully aware that what you see is the playing out of their own cause and effect (karma), and then you compassionately intervene on behalf of both parties, knowing that each is yourself in another body...and you are in full forgiveness mode even as you are in the midst of helping.  This higher consciousness is our inner knowing that we are all one...that no one is more special than another.<br>  <br>  i have had two experiences of extreme anger in myself within the past year, and the interesting thing to me is that i was fully aware that i was "choosing" to feel and act on the anger and carry it as far as i could make it go. i was looking for an impact and effect on a young woman who was living in my home...coaching, encouraging, supporting, and guiding her, while it had been beneficial for awhile, was no longer working.  i deemed it necessary to get her attention and deliberately sailed into an angry tirade on two different occasions, knowing exactly what i was doing...it definitely got her attention, because she knew that it was not my norm, and her behavior changed accordingly.  This is not something i recommend, but for us it was effective since it came on without ego identification (well, maybe just a little bit...out of frustration, perhaps, and deep love and concern for her), and it  illustrated to her the direction she had taken away from some good inner work she'd been doing.  The moment was organic each time, and came on with full force after the initial moment of recognition of what i was about to do and for what reason. i don't necessarily claim "righteous" anger here, yet it did do the trick...after my verbal tirade about the mistakes she was making in her choices, she realized not only that she'd been in error, but that i deeply cared for her and wanted only the best...a sort of tough love, i suppose.<br>  <br>  In the ideal, there is no place for anger...rather, whatever might stir one to action in any of the above scenarios would be compassion and love rather than anger, because the ego has no part in higher consciousness.  An enlightened being is not self-identified with anything, but will be guided to right action without personal attachment to situations, persons, or outcomes.  <br>  <br>  i am Sirius|`|RcBPRQQJaa	anger is in the right place when your husband/wife has cheated on you!

But this is a different question from whether it is good or not.  In my opinion there is no situation that is improved by being angry with it.  The result is that the situation remains the same, and is complicated by being seen through an angry mind.  Anger might sometimes give the impetus to make a change that is good.  But if we know that it is good, we know that it is good dispassionately, without anger.  It would be better therefore to make the necessary change without the anger.  This is not to say that anger is wrong.

And yes I do believe it can be productive-- it is just one of many emotional motivators that gear us up to do something about a situation we don't like.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think the key is balance-- how we handle anger is the important thing. We can either use that inspiration and energy productively to make positive changes, or we can use it as an excuse to hold us back or to make a bad situation worse. Like any other emotion, we have to learn how to control it and keep our perspective through it. <br>  <br>  <br>  I guess we tell the difference by examining our actions. If we break things, scream, withdraw, or sit around burning up with negativity, we are not using anger productively. If we are becoming pro-active to make changes that are beneficial, like starting a political letter-writing campaign or breaking up with a guy that keeps cheating on us, then we're using it productively.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Anger is attack. It's an invalidation of the Christhood of others and an act of ego control out of fear.<br>  <br>  However, you can put on a mantle that might appear as anger to someone who sees himself in you as anger but it's really love to teach them of their own judgment.<br>  <br>  This is a role of the coyote, the shapeshifter of purity..<br>  The tar baby is one example of this.<br>  <br>  EDIT  In reference to the money changers in the temple.

It is the wrong use of passion, there are other more enjoyable ways to the source.|`|7aK81hsbaa	Phae, anger is always an attempt to make someone feel guilty. *hugs*|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I wasn't able to look at your link cause my computer is broke & I am at the library in an area of crazy reps. who hate the Dixie Chicks. So anger is in the republicans minds. Anger is what I feel when I think about my computer having a virus. I see anger as a teacher. When I am anger I ask myself what I need to change. When I first started living this way I was going to a local pizza parlor that sold delicious string beans. They were doing so many things there that made me mad like charging too much, etc. One day I asked to try a little bit of there tuna cause I always got that at Subway & thought I could buy it from them cause Pizza was not the right thing for me to eat. They refused to let me have a little taste. I loved there string beans though. I ended up learned how to make delicisious string beans at home. My husband & I used to go out to eat all the time. This was years ago & now we much prefer to make our own food at home. So this pizza place has helped me improve my diet, learn how to cook & probably save thousands of dollars a year. Anger is good if you read it the right way. What is is telling you to change? Do you need to improve your communication skills? Do you need to find another cable company? Whatever the anger is about it is really a gift?|`|VPlKbDplaa	I think that every human emotion that we are capable of feeling has its place and thus its merits under the right circumstances....even [restrained] anger. I think life has to be about balance with respect of our emotions and desires too.  And I think that every human emotion needs to be under some kind of self-control so that it does not become like a wild independent entity that knows no limits...even love as even love can be 'smothering'. <br>  <br>  Anger can certainly be born out of love. It wouldn't be normal to not get angry at our loved ones under given circumstances and to appropriately chastise them in a way that is to remind them and guide them towards what is wholesome for them and the family well-being. <br>  <br>  Anger could be the driving force for justice,  and also the driving force for seeking to make amends for our wrongs. For example anger would often be part of the driving force to bring a perpetrator of a criminal offense to a person or their property to justice through the judicial system. Regarding making amends for our wrongs....to be angry with oneself for causing some unhappiness to another, as prompted by the guiding conscience,  is what would perhaps propel one towards making amends with the one wronged as a means of seeking forgiveness. Just small ways out of a myriad of many possibilities of how anger born out of good intent could perhaps work towards the maintenance of a stable and harmonious family and society.<br>  <br>  Anything self-righteous has to be wrong. I believe self-righteousness is a trap of the ego-self. For instance, spiritually speaking, if we consider our way the best or only way and grow in self-pride because of that, then that would surely be wrong. And this self-righteousness could manifest itself as a form of anger that is intolerance of others, which is wrong. All great Prophets of God (on them be peace) spoke against this self-righteousness and intolerance. They also showed us ways that anger would be allowed.. And our getting upset and angry at the injustices seen in the world at the hand of our fellow human beings is often what propels us to acts of charity and benevolence towards others suffering.<br>  <br>  So yes I agree with you that it could be a motivation for change, if used appropriately and controlled. This is where the heart comes in really. Anger from the mind without heart restraint or guidance is surely folly. But anger that is guided by empathy for instance that seeks ultimate good is surely anger that is under guidance from the heart...God willing.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the interesting question :)<br>  Peace.
TYstsM7Yaa	All christians are weak. In the head that is.  Open your eyes and let the reason and logic flow in.<br>  <br>  "I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours." <br>  -- Stephen Roberts|`|vQWZx5Yuaa	my parents are christians ..and think i am..but i really could care less about that ****|`|8f2e6b2b77e98982ec1a14639f6d0a1baa	I'm atheist, so I couldn't say what people who are weakly Christian believe in. I think it is definitely possible to be "spiritual" and believe there is a higher power without following every word in the Bible. The Bible was written by man, and some people believe that maybe the Bible isn't really "perfect." It's not. No one who has read the bible from front to back is going to tell you that the Bible never contradicts itself because it does. Many. Different. Times. <br>  <br>  Anyway--<br>  <br>  I think that one can only say they're atheist if they truly believe there is no god and that Jesus wasn't a savior for the Christian people. Religion is purely an opinion on an afterlife. Some people think that it's definitely true and I am perfectly happy for their passion in their beliefs. I think it's perfectly acceptable to just let other people live the way they want to live and not be so judgemental about how other people want to approach their lives.<br>  <br>  I am approached everyday by Christians who want to convert me to some form of Christianity, but I've never gone out to turn Christians away from their beliefs. Mostly because I kind of accept that Christians believe in something I don't and I think I'm mature enough to say that I'm okay with that. I think it would be perfectly acceptable for people to believe in God and Jesus and not go through the everyday routines. I don't think it's okay for someone to rant about how sex before marriage is wrong and then have sex before marriage. Consistancy is key ;)|`|IrQRizoVaa	i agree with you - just word it diffferently - i think that some people that CLAIM to be christians (or as you say, weaker christians) but dont pay attention to God and just go to church for the sake of it are not exactly atheists, but havent decided what they belive yet or just ignore it because they dont want to realise they got stuff wrong in their lives that they need to change<br>  <br>  saying that ur a christian doesnt mean you are - if ur a real christian you believe in God and Jesus and give full control of your life and strive to be conformed to the image of Christ|`|06Z3fh4laa	If a Christian really believe "Hell" and "Haven" were real, you would assume that would do all that's possible in getting there.

Why not just copy the 10 commandments or other parts of the Bible onto parchment and sign it?  Obviously, the framers of the Constitution felt some need to create a separate, independent document for governing our country.<br>  <br>  Also, within this document, it clearly states that the government cannot make laws for or against religion.  The goal being to prevent a government established religion.  If we were to be a "Christian" nation, why would they put in this separation clause and why would they allow complete freedom of religion (which means any religion or no religion)?<br>  <br>  The goal of conserva-fascists is to create a theocracy in the US and force everyone to live under fundamentalist Christian interpretations.  To them, the end justifies the means.

AA11849917	He was / is our healer because "by His stripes we are healed."<br>  <br>  "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. "  (Isa 53:4-5)<br>  <br>  But if He had to deal with His OWN sin (if He had NOT been sinless), then He couldn't carry OURS.  Likewise, if He had to deal with His OWN sicknesses and diseases, He couldn't carry OURS.<br>  <br>  So, no.  Jesus never fell ill or had headaches, or any other such physical ailments.|`|zUUxn1Rbaa	why wouldn't he? He was in human form and having a headache or falling ill wasn't a sin.

I'm sure He had headaches, common colds, and all the other yucky things we suffer as human beings in His 33 years. We know for instance that He got angry, frustrated, and that He wept. To me that is one of the most amazing things about Jesus- He was and is God but while He was here He became human . He endured all of the same things we do. How much does that tell you He loves us, to become like us? It is absolutely mind blowing to me! We truly could never fully understand the extent of His love for us!! That is one of the reasons i find it so incredible that people can and do reject Him!
u2BVwAKNaa	I'm a Atheist and I think its appalling..<br>  <br>  Taking baths and hanging out with animals like that is just plain insane|`|TYstsM7Yaa	I guess not everyone can see the humor. People should understand that animals are wild and this is what an animal does.<br>  If a rodeo clown gets a horn in the butt, i laugh. But yeah it does make you feel kinda sorry.|`|7kR5dBTlaa	Not exactly. It was awful of course. But that's what happens when you keep wild animals as pets.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	Never own an animal that is stronger than you.|`|5y38Pdtiaa	yes, humans get what they deserve. <br>  you should not keep wild animals in captivity|`|UbYl29xYaa	yup|`|346e6e2923d4e46195fcf8100cba96beaa	Yes<br>  There are reasons why the OT used the death penalty if you had a bull known to be dangerous, and it was not restrained and killed someone.<br>  <br>  That should apply in the case of that dangerous chimp.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Yes, how can you not get disgusted at a woman getting her face torn off?!<br>  <br>  Wild animals are not pets.

All that shows to me is that she did not see it as a Chimpanzee. In the wild,m they rape, kill, and eat each other!! This animal was 200 lbs and powerful. Now a woman is horribly injured. Very few people can handle these animals.<br>  <br>  My fiance told me some paper ran the story with the headline "Furious George"- I couldn't find if that was true but that would be in very poor taste.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say the injured woman deserved it though.

jV99kgWbaa	Well... after reading your post, I wish I had been in your family. They sound wonderful!<br>  <br>  I have dreams about my father too. And he passed on around the same time as yours, two and half years ago now. He was the best ever, and I miss him a lot. I miss him much more than I ever thought I could, and I'm so grateful for dreams that remind me of him.<br>  <br>  I had a strange dream once, not about a family member, but about my Sunday School teacher who had died of a heart attack. I dreamed he left me a note in a Bible. The end of it read, "You might never have [something I was worrying about at the time], but you've got to have peace of mind." I remember waking up thinking what's peace of mind!<br>  <br>  Another time, I had a dream about a teacher I had when I was little. I dreamed she had a heart attack. Next day, I got into the bus for work, and at the next stop my friend got in. She came over to my seat, leaned across it and said, "Did you hear about Miss Moore? She died of a heart attack last night." <br>  <br>  So... I don't know. There are more things in heaven and earth than we know about. God is a big God. He speaks to us in many ways, and just maybe He speaks in our grief by reminding us what love really is.|`|iHDYncuXaa	No. They have moved on to another dimension. They no longer can be contacted nor can they contact you.|`|80A6iHoGaa	YES I do...I get messages and that type of thing..it all started 3 years ago when my father past away...just sux having to wait for the next piece to the puzzle|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Who knows?|`|biKMQ2I1aa	yes, and cats suck your soul while you sleep|`|JXMpZiwxaa	I believe they do, because they need our prayers.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	No i don't  .

I think it is a preferred medium for them to visit you than showing themselves to you while you are conscious and wide awake. I'm sure you'll get freaked out.<br>  <br>  My grandmother had a very close friend who loves everyone in our family. When her friend passed away, my dad and his 3 siblings dreamt the same dream that their aunt was saying goodbye to them. My grandmother has a totally different dream but it happened almost at the same time, and 2 of my father's siblings were abroad. They talked about it after a few days, and were really awed about it. They all knew that their aunt is in a good place.|`|a89fc7a7a74ee78fea9b92e9a6a9492daa	ABSOLUTELY!   My mother called me on the phone in a dream.  I asked her if she missed me and she couldn't answer because she no longer feels pain. I asked her if she wanted to talk to my husband and she said yes.  I passed the phone to him, but he couldn't hear her, only me.  AWESOME!   I would've loved your grandma.|`|FAL5foHuaa	Yes i do. My father had passed away when i was 3 years old and ive occasionally had dreams about him and my grandfather, who had died last year, and they all have been happy dreams, touching dreams that i wish could last forever. I always hated to wake up from a dream about my dad or my grandfather, or both. I laways seem to cry even when my dream wasnt sad. i guess i just miss them.|`|zw7N64cqaa	I don't know but I had a dream about my uncle who passed away a while ago, and it made me wonder. There are some things no one knows, and can't explain, and you have yo accept it.|`|1lfgh3KPaa	well I always have dreams about my grandmother who passed away year before last so it's definitely worth thinking about|`|kvRhnn7daa	It's never happened to me, but I believe that it does happen for people time to time. Like when Jesus visits people in their dreams, I think. I think that was lovely.|`|KWzqG1yaaa	No, I believe that God speaks to us through dreams.<br>  you can go to Streamsministries to get someone to interpret your dream if you would like. :)|`|SwoRqEZvaa	I have a friend who believes this very strongly. I hope...I also have dreams about my dad who has passed on|`|cbNPsb1Naa	Yes, I do.  ESPECIALLY if you were in a close relationship with that person before they passed.|`|umYDIWLnaa	I believe so. Dreams are very capable of bringing back the good times.|`|ANNeg6Voaa	I believe my grandmother would tell me stuff and it would happen but then people don't believe you|`|t4u4XERBaa	no there is no after life when you die it is just what it was like before you were born...nothing...:'''( sorry|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	This happens to me all the time almost nightly. <br>  I carry on long conversations with them. <br>  Do they come back to visit? No only in my mind. Memories of them still remain after they are long gone. <br>  As long as someone remembers you, you are not dead. This is the only after life I believe in. <br>  I dream about my father and in my dreams he tells me what I wanted to hear when he was alive but never did. I love you son.|`|2WZGclIwaa	Your dream sounds amazing! I am so happy for you that you had that dream. <br>  Absolutley they visit us. My boyfriend passed away in 05 and he always comes to visit me in dreams. And I love it. They are so real and awesome, I often cry too, and when I wake up I am crying. They are so real, and I wish they were!<br>  When they come to visit us in our dreams that's their way of communicating. My grandpa also passed away in 04, and I still am waiting for him to come visit me, he hasnt yet :(. We were really close and  I miss him a lot.<br>  After my boyfriend passed, it was really hard on me, and I went and bought a couple Sylvia Brown books, because I needed to know I would see him again, and I needed something to believe in. Whether or not they are real or whatever, I know lots of people have opinions on her! But her books are really interesting actually. And it made me feel so much better to know that they are in a good place, and waiting for us. They actually helped me in the greiving and healing process....I enjoyed reading her books. One of them tells what it's like in heaven and what they do there, and all about it. It's really cool, I'm not sure if I totally believe it all, but it made me feel a whole lot better!|`|YSmzoEqKaa	i think they do because ok  one time my mom had a dream about her father my grandfather  in a dream  and she had that dream a few weeks after he died...and me as strange or stupid some ppl may think it seems i had 2 dogs and one dog dies and a few years later the daughter dies of that one they both lived very fruitful live and were two beautiful chocolate shar pei's and the night after the daughter died i had a dream that both of them walked in through the screen door and were licking me and it was just absolutely beautiful..i still tear up hear typing  it and when i told my mother the next day crying as you would say tears filled with joyful memories she said it was them coming to say good bye...and anyone like "scientists"  who will say ohhh its all in your mind u were just thinking about them in ur subconscious ...well forget them and believe it was them coming from beyond having a nice get together with you the only way they can thru your mind...and ignore any negative comments that come from others :)|`|chpMevdkaa	i believe it, it has happened to me, i have had many people that i love pass on, im not ready to share it just yet, but sometimes i can sense them, their warmth and love around me. your loved ones, are watching over you. if you have anything left to say to them, just say it , they will hear, i am deeply sorry for your losses|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	I most definitely believe. My aunt (thru marriage) had a dream that her departed mother kept telling her that there was water around her. Long story short. She had her mom disinterred only to discover that the vault (the one that the casket is placed in before burial) was leaking and filling with water. She purchased a new one and never had the dream again.|`|4BoteYDwaa	absolutely, yes|`|AA10481071	dead can't talk to you once they die<br>  <br>  it was just a dream or a demon pretending to be a dead person.|`|ixOE0onnaa	i do|`|AA11773731	I do believe they contact us. My mom passed from cancer last year and a week after she died I had a dream that I was sitting on the porch and she pulled up in a car. When she got out she looked just as she did before the cancer. She had all her hair and was dressed nice. I stop and said "Mom, but I thought you were dead." And she said, God let her come down for the day because there was too much traffic in Heaven. Needless to say, I didn't want to wake up.|`|xHcQSLiVaa	They break thru in our dreams and if you are sensitive enough you may even see or hear them when you are awake.  I have so many stories.  I was not always able to do it, but about four years ago it started.  One day I went for a walk and when I sat down to relax after the walk, I started hearing and seeing a relative of a person that I work with.  Since then, I have been able to relay messages for other people.  We have taken actual photos of people who aren't here and recorded EVPs.  I have found someone who I hope can help me improve my ability to mediate these messages.

I haven't talked to them but I do know that one of them saw me. I was sleeping though and I woke up and saw him but it was very peaceful that I wasn't afraid and didn't bother to get scared or run out of my room. lol.<br>  <br>  If you do see her, try talking to her.

I would do some research on the building, you may be able to do that though your local library, most ghosts just dont know they are dead or are affraid to move on if you see her again tell her it is ok to move on, go towards the light.|`|ZYCRkgawaa	Sounds like you saw a ghost who is trapped on this side. Possibly someone who died there or as a result of work there. If it was a murder, you may be able to check old newspaper records or find someone who knows the history of the area. Not likely anyone is still alive from that period. Someone at a local church may remember. Sounds like it could be a baby or something important in her lap. If you see her again, tell her not to be afraid. A priest may be able to bless the building and send her on. She has unfinished business and does not know she needs to go on. <br>  <br>  You may be sensitive to these things or it could just be a coincidence and have nothing to do with you. <br>  <br>  Early workhouses often had employees die in childbirth, from desease, or overwork. <br>  <br>  Find out how old the building is, who owned it, what went on there, and any crimes that may have been committed there. There may also be an historical society, library history expert, etc. that will know something.|`|yCTxg4t5aa	To find out who she was checking into the history of the building/area would be a good idea. Ghosts aren't good or bad, they just are, you can get mean nasty ones but they don't really cause any lasting damage, and if shes that young and just sitting there then i doubt shes a mean one. I suggest if you see her again try speaking to her, if she doesn't reply its more than likely that shes just an echo. Everyone has the potential to see spirits, it's just that when people make up their minds that ghosts don't exist then they'll never see them, unless its particularity strong which is rare.|`|AA10691319	sounds like you experianced a residual spirit.  They dont mean any harm, in short its a spirit that doesnt accept that its body is dead.  To conferm this you would need to check your local hall of records to see if there were any deaths at the property.  If you see her again, dont worry, she doesnt know youre there, and she'll be there regardless if you are.  if she does try to reach out to her just inform her that her body has moved on and it is okay for her to leave this earth, that her family is okay and she can go on.

You'll vanish, and you won't even realize it.<br>  <br>  Think about it, you were dead for 13.7 billion years before you were born. Did you even notice?<br>  <br>  However, let me share some statistics with you.<br>  <br>  Not counting the odds of the Earth forming the way it did, evolution taking the path it took, etc.<br>  <br>  During your conception, the sperm cell that would later form you was competing against 250 MILLION others. The sheer odds that you, you alone, would be formed is therefore 1/250 million.<br>  <br>  That's the equivalent of winning the lottery 8 times.<br>  <br>  So instead of worrying about what you stand to lose, consider how lucky you are that you even exist to begin with.

Every second spent worrying about death is time that you're wasting by not pursuing the joys of life.|`|AA11232725	Philippians 4:6  Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;  7  and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  8  Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy--meditate on these things.<br>  <br>  Romans 8:35  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

Maybe you could set up specific grieving times and places in your day.  You could say to yourself, no matter what happens at work, I will not cry at work.  Instead, I will save those feelings and when I get out to the parking lot when I'm leaving for home, I can cry then.  Then remember to cry at the appointed time and place.  You are not avoiding your grieving, just rescheduling it.  This worked well for me, especially after losing my husband within the first six months we were married.

I'm a tear jerker too. All someone else has to do is tear up and I'm a gusher right along with them. Are you a Leo? I've always heard us Leo's have tender hearts.But to try to answer your question.<br>  First ...Your crying for your loss...the one you loved is no longer there for you to call, hug, and say...I love you. But the crying heals your heart, your soul. If you didn't cry your emotions get bottled up, this affects your blood pressure, heart, and all of the insides that we have. It's a huge effect on our entire system. Some people scream or throw things to release their pain or frustration. Some go into severe depression, some cry, some go into their inner self. Mentally and Physically our emotions effect us. Grieving is what our bodies and minds are made for. We Grieve for our loss, what we had but we lost. Never to recieve back. When some of us talk about the one who has passed, it helps them keep the memorys alive, or relieves their stress by verbally saying to anyone, or the four walls...saying...It's not fair and letting their anger and fear be heard...even if no one is listening..they feel they have been heard. What I think a lot of people forget to do in the event of the death of the loved one...is to cry. They do not let their emotions heal them. Then they  go back to buisness to hide the pain and act like it didn't happen to cope. What most don't realize is that  everyone needs to talk about the fun times, the bad times, I miss her, I miss him....Talking again is good for keeping the memory of your loved one alive.....Pictures need to stay out, once or twice a year, the loved one needs renewed flowers at the gravesite. God Bless

gkffZHF2aa	You use common sense.<br>  <br>  If the person wishing to be baptized is in a hospital bed, you don't go looking for the physical therapy whirlpool bath.  There's a reason they're in that bed.  And if the wheelchair-bound person doesn't wish to put well-meaning robust men at possible risk of hurting themselves (or the person!) from the effort of lifting him/her into and out of the water -- something that only health care workers are trained to do correctly -- then you go with the intent of the person to follow the Lord in baptism, rather than insisting that the only "valid" baptism is complete and total immersion.  And you certainly don't make the person feel that their baptism by whatever means are safely possible isn't as good as that of an able-bodied person who hops into the baptistry or river and "gets dunked".  Narrow-minded legalism wasn't something the Lord looked upon with fondness, and it certainly applies here.|`|c3zUqmdXaa	If they can not be baptized, it's okay. The thief on the cross was saved without being baptized, but the disciples did not "baptize" him with "a glass of water" on his head because the true baptism in by immersion only. The own greek word "baptdzo" means "immersion". John, the baptism used to walk many kilommeters to baptize in in the part of the river where "there was much water". Why? Cause in there he could really baptize (immersion). The baptism of Jesus was also by immersion cause it's written that he "went out of the water", (according to the original greek). Paul says the baptism is a burial (the symbol of our death and ressurrection with Christ). So I ask: Is a dead buried with a little of earth on the head or is he his body completely buried?|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	There are exceptions..............<br>  <br>  Baptism doesn't save a person..............faith in Christ does.<br>  <br>  A person who wants to make a genuine, public mention of their salvation by the symbol of baptism who is handicapped can do it by water being spilled over the head.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Carry them into the water.

It is possible to be baptized in a hospital bed with sprinkling, and if, for instance, you happen to be with the same affliction as that physicist guy and need to stay in the chair then this can be done for you as well.  Of course, any priest you go to should have the insight to act according to your situation.<br>  <br>  In the written history of the Church there is a case of someone being baptized with sand, and there is also a case of a mother baptizing her child with her mother's milk, in both instances out of fear of not being alive to get a standard baptism.  Both of these were deemed to be the real deal and no other baptism was allowed after they made it to safety.|`|ds3eJjUNaa	After his resurrection Christ gives this mission to his apostles: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  From the very day of Pentecost the Church has celebrated and administered holy Baptism. Indeed St. Peter declares to the crowd astounded by his preaching: "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The apostles and their collaborators offer Baptism to anyone who believed in Jesus: Jews, the God-fearing, pagans.[27] Always, Baptism is seen as connected with faith: "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household," St. Paul declared to his jailer in Philippi. And the narrative continues, the jailer "was baptized at once, with all his family<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  According to the Apostle Paul, the believer enters through Baptism into communion with Christ's death, is buried with him, and rises with him: <br>  Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.[29] <br>  The baptized have "put on Christ."[30] Through the Holy Spirit, Baptism is a bath that purifies, justifies, and sanctifies.[31] <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The essential rite of the sacrament follows: Baptism properly speaking. It signifies and actually brings about death to sin and entry into the life of the Most Holy Trinity through configuration to the Paschal mystery of Christ. Baptism is performed in the most expressive way by triple immersion in the baptismal water. However, from ancient times it has also been able to be conferred by pouring the water three times over the candidate's head. <br>  <br>  The practice of infant Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the Church. There is explicit testimony to this practice from the second century on, and it is quite possible that, from the beginning of the apostolic preaching, when whole "households" received baptism, infants may also have been baptized<br>  <br>  <br>  Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38). <br>  <br>  Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?" (Acts 10:47). <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Humm Jesus said <br>  Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  After Peter’s first sermon, three thousand people were baptized in Jerusalem (Acts 2:41). Archaeologists have demonstrated there was no sufficient water supply for so many to have been immersed. Even if there had been, the natives of Jerusalem would scarcely have let their city’s water supply be polluted by three thousand unwashed bodies plunging into it. These people must have been baptized by pouring or sprinkling. <br>  <br>  Even today practical difficulties can render immersion nearly or entirely impossible for some individuals: for example, people with certain medical conditions—the bedridden; quadriplegics; individuals with tracheotomies (an opening into the airway in the throat) or in negative pressure ventilators (iron lungs). Again, those who have recently undergone certain procedures (such as open-heart surgery) cannot be immersed, and may not wish to defer baptism until their recovery (for example, if they are to undergo further procedures). <br>  <br>  Other difficulties arise in certain environments. For example, immersion may be nearly or entirely impossible for desert nomads or Eskimos. Or consider those in prison—not in America, where religious freedom gives prisoners the right to be immersed if they desire—but in a more hostile setting, such as a Muslim regime, where baptisms must be done in secret, without adequate water for immersion. <br>  <br>  What are we to do in these and similar cases? Shall we deny people the sacrament because immersion is impractical or impossible for them? Ironically, the Fundamentalist, who acknowledges that baptism is commanded but thinks it isn’t essential for salvation, may make it impossible for many people to be baptized at all in obedience to God’s command. The Catholic, who believes baptism confers grace and is normatively necessary for salvation, maintains that God wouldn’t require a form of baptism that, for some people, is impossible. <br>  <br>  <br>  Baptism in the Early Church<br>  <br>  <br>  That the early Church permitted pouring instead of immersion is demonstrated by the Didache, a Syrian liturgical manual that was widely circulated among the churches in the first few centuries of Christianity, perhaps the earliest Christian writing outside the New Testament. <br>  <br>  The Didache was written around A.D. 70 and, though not inspired, is a strong witness to the sacramental practice of Christians in the apostolic age. In its seventh chapter, the Didache reads, "Concerning baptism, baptize in this manner: Having said all these things beforehand, baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit in living water [that is, in running water, as in a river]. If there is no living water, baptize in other water; and, if you are not able to use cold water, use warm. If you have neither, pour water three times upon the head in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." These instructions were composed either while some of the apostles and disciples were still alive or during the next generation of Christians, and they represent an already established custom. <br>  <br>  The testimony of the Didache is seconded by other early Christian writings. Hippolytus of Rome said, "If water is scarce, whether as a constant condition or on occasion, then use whatever water is available" (The Apostolic Tradition, 21 [A.D. 215]). Pope Cornelius I wrote that as Novatian was about to die, "he received baptism in the bed where he lay, by pouring" (Letter to Fabius of Antioch [A.D. 251]; cited in Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, 6:4311). <br>  <br>  Cyprian advised that no one should be "disturbed because the sick are poured upon or sprinkled when they receive the Lord’s grace" (Letter to a Certain Magnus 69:12 [A.D. 255]). Tertullian described baptism by saying that it is done "with so great simplicity, without pomp, without any considerable novelty of preparation, and finally, without cost, a man is baptized in water, and amid the utterance of some few words, is sprinkled, and then rises again, not much (or not at all) the cleaner" (On Baptism, 2 [A.D. 203]). Obviously, Tertullian did not consider baptism by immersion the only valid form, since he says one is only sprinkled and thus comes up from the water "not much (or not at all) the cleaner." <br>  <br>  Ancient Christian Mosaics Show Pouring<br>  <br>  <br>  Then there is the artistic evidence. Much of the earliest Christian artwork depicts baptism—but not baptism by immersion! If the recipient of the sacrament is in a river, he is shown standing in the river while water is poured over his head from a cup or shell. Tile mosaics in ancient churches and paintings in the catacombs depict baptism by pouring. Baptisteries in early cemeteries are clear witnesses to baptisms by infusion. The entire record of the early Church—as shown in the New Testament, in other writings, and in monumental evidence—indicates the mode of baptism was not restricted to immersion. <br>  <br>  Other archaeological evidence confirms the same thing. An early Christian baptistery was found in a church in Jesus’ hometown of Nazareth, yet this baptistery, which dates from the second century, was too small and narrow in which to immerse a person.|`|j74G3t51aa	Being Baptized isn't a "choice".  Jesus told us at the end of Matthew "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you..."  Being Christians, that means to be Christ Like.  Doing as he did.  He was Baptized, remember?  by his cousin, John.  Then, there's Acts 2:38.

VRl1jENHaa	Physical circumcision was the outward sign that God gave to the Jews to identify them as belonging to Him.  HOWEVER, this is only a symbol of what God truly wants from His people:  INWARD RIGHTEOUSNESS and LOVE for Him.  When a person has "circumcised their heart," it means that they've marked themselves inwardly as a means of identifying that they belong to Him.  Such a person has repented from sin, believed that God's message it true, and agrees to live a life of obedience to His will.|`|AA11139575	Circumcision was a sign of the covenant that God had made with Israel. He would make them his people and keep it so if they stayed faithful to him by obeying his laws. But the people began disobeying God, so Deuteronomy 10:16 shows that they were really obeying Jehovah on the surface. They had obeyed the law to become circumcised, but they were not obedient to all his laws.

That has stopped long ago, however. I never believed in God, but I was forced by my family to go to church and youth group classes every sunday from the age of 5 until I was in 8th grade -- no exceptions -- and take an active part in the discussion. Even after 8th grade I was still occasionally dragged into church. My family knew the entire time that I did not believe yet tried endlessly to change that, but until 7th grade nobody in my church knew; they thought I was Methodist, and then one day I just flipped out on the pastors when they were poking fun at non-believers. I spent the next two years attending church every sunday as always, but it became a debate: youth group and pastors vs. myself. I think it's probably why I can get very bitter towards Christians if they push the wrong buttons.|`|SrdIsAkTaa	No, but in some cases I have made a point of answering in a vague fashion with people I don't know or in situations that could impact me having a job or not considering a lot of Pagans tend to get fired/harassed after being outed IRL.|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	yes, im not proud of it, and would i do it different if i could, yes!<br>  You should be proud of your faith not be embarassed,  but our sinful nature makes us want to deny it.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Lie?

Well I am standing there, by myself (only person on the street) and I have about 90 min to kill before Mass starts. Well there are some statues there, so I go over to look at them. So there I stand  looking at some statues outside of the officer housing, and this nice older gentleman and his wife come out of one of the houses and say "Hi son, can I help you?" Well I tell them I came over from the ROTC camp to go to church and I'm early. He says "Well that's great son, I'm General So an so (I don't remember the name, but I do remember the word GENERAL) and the wife and I are just going to church, would you like to come with us?" <br>  <br>  So, I went with the General and his wife to Protestant service...first time I had been to one.

Once we  die it is too late. Of course by then our blinders are lifted and we see the truth completly revealed and behold God's holiness. Of course then we have no choice but to acknowledge Him and who and what He is.but then it will be too late. Jesus was  warning us not to wait too long. if we reject Him here in this life He will reject us.<br>  2- I believe He may also be refering to end times when ALL of the remaining world comes before Him for judgement. ( the sheep & goats)<br>  Matthew 25:41-46 (New International Version)<br>  <br>    41"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' <br>  <br>   44"They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' <br>  <br>   45"He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' <br>  <br>   46"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."<br>  <br>  As you see even then the unbelievers now will one day acknowledge his kingship.<br>  <br>  GLYASDI|`|ijyish4Baa	John 3:16 is talking about people that get saved and they get to have eternal life and Luke is talking about people that have not gotten saved or believed with there whole heart and truly got saved and so they won't get to go to heaven they seek to enter like alot of people but they haven't truly gotten saved so they shall not enter.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Many that claim to believe John 3:16, really actually don't believe it, because they add their works or they insist that they need works to "prove" that they believe (as ridiculous as that sounds, it's a false gospel that a lot say). <br>  <br>  So many will think they're getting in, but will find out that they didn't believe in Jesus alone, but were trusting in some false mix of faith and works.

E4mTHIcbaa	Efectivamente, no tienen un sistema de escritura que se base en la fonetica -sonidos- como el japones.<br>  <br>  No obstante, no es completamente cierto que siempre sean ideogramas. Ideogramas implica que el caracter indica una idea, pero en chino un gran porcentaje de caracteres se compone de un radical que indica el significado aproximado y de un componente fonetico, es decir, ese componente te dice mas o menos como se pronuncia. Solo que actualmente el chino ha cambiado mucho y no siempre es demasiado util.<br>  <br>  Por poner un ejemplo:<br>  <br>  马 se pronuncia "ma". Significa caballo -es la versión simplificada del 馬 del japones-. Parad ecir "mama", que se pronuncia mama (aunque condiferente tono), se escribe 妈妈 Como puedes ver, a la izquierda aparece el radical de "mujer", a la derecha 马 que inidica el sonido. Lo mismo pasa con la particula que transforma en preguntas oraciones (parecido al か japones), que se escribe 吗.<br>  <br>  Sobre los trazos complejos que viste, probablemetne era chino tradicional. El simplificado en realidad es mas simple que el japones. Compara la palabra telefono en japones y chino simplificado: 電話　电话<br>  <br>  En chino se suele necesitar conocer unos 5000 caracteres, mientras que en japones unos 2500. No obstante, es enga?oso. Como sabras si has estudiado japones, en japones cada kanji puede tener bastantes pronunciaciones, tanto nativas como basadas en chino. En cambio, en chino cada caracter suele tener, como regla general, una pronunciacion. Cuando hay dos, la mayoria de veces es simlpemente el cambio de tono dependiendo de alguna sutileza del significado.|`|4Ib9lVFnaa	no ellos tiene solo caracteres chinos ideogramas unicos creo son aun mas dificil q los de japon, los de japoneses son oriendu de china pero son japo en realidad .. son idiomas milenarios, para aprenderlos realmente realmente tienes que ser o bien chino o bien japo o tener alguna descendencia oriental sino no es lo mismo ... o irte al pais y quedarte al menon unos 10 a?os|`|7UmG0Mb6aa	noc

AA10613962	If Muslims were so very concerned about their image, why don't they condemn the radicals who are causing so much trouble? There should be a large unmistakable outcry of Muslims who would go to the media and condemn radicals for causing so much trouble. There should be a willingness to live peacefully in the countries they are settling in.. instead, there are plans to rule supreme by trying to institute their laws and religion on other cultures.<br>  <br>   In our own country, we have recently seen the case of a man who beheaded his own wife because she wanted to divorce him. This is not an isolated incident either. There have been other stories of how Muslim men murder their own daughters for wanting to live normal lives. It looks like the situation is even worse in their own land where it takes the eyewitness of 4 men to convict a man of rape, and where it is "ok"to murder a daughter for being raped! It seems to me that Muslims have no respect for women or anyone else who disagree with them. <br>  <br>  THEY are their own worst enemies when it comes to how the world sees them! I hate saying these things because I know that all Muslims should not be judged by what some do, but there comes a time to put a stop to all the violence!

There was a stump of a tree, and in the dark, a thief came that way and said, "That is a policeman." A young man waiting for his beloved saw it and thought that it was his sweetheart. A child who had been told ghost stories took it for a ghost and began to shriek. But all the time it was the stump of a tree. We see the world as we are. Suppose there is a baby in a room with a bag of gold on the table and a thief comes and steals the gold. Would the baby know it was stolen? That which we have inside, we see outside. The baby has no thief inside and sees no thief outside. So with all knowledge. Do not talk of the wickedness of the world and all its sins. Weep that you are bound to see wickedness yet. Weep that you are bound to see sin everywhere, and if you want to help the world, do not condemn it. Do not weaken it more. For what is sin and what is misery, and what are all these, but the results of weakness? The world is made weaker and weaker every day by such teachings. <br>  <br>  Men and women are taught from childhood that they are weak and sinners. Teach them that they are all glorious children of immortality, even those who are the weakest in manifestation. Let positive, strong, helpful thought enter into their brains from very childhood. Lay yourselves open to these thoughts, and not to weakening and paralyzing ones. Say to your own minds, "I am the Atman. I am the Infinite." Let it ring day and night in your minds like a song, and at the point of death declare, "I am the Atman." That is the Truth; the infinite strength of the world is yours. Drive out the superstition that has covered your minds. Let us be brave. Know the truth and practice the truth. The goal may be distant, but awake, arise, and stop not till the goal is reached.|`|j2VDYbeoaa	I think you should have used the word "conscience" rather than "morals", because the former is up to YOU while the latter is the product of society.

In either case, the decision for action is left to the individual, with no mention of societal mores.|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	it's more about acceptance, a lot of people realise how biology works but they can't accept the fact that they'll die one day so they have to believe that they'll live forever. once you accept the fact that once you die you die you can focus on this life more and accept it as a natural part of the life cycle.|`|KmULmT7Baa	True, Christians believe their "soul" will live forever in heaven.

Mostly because until a bit ago it was made completely from religion. Is killing bad? The average person would say yes. If asked why he would probably say because it takes another persons life, because it takes what god gave a person, or something along thoes lines. You could ask why is that bad? And they would probably say because. The truth is its bad because its in the bible, or possibly because people wouldn't want to die themselves so they don't want it to happen to other people. Generally societies morals are based on the bible and what you wouldn't want to experience yourself.<br>  <br>  My moral system is based on giving and taking an consentuality.

Seeing so many of the evils that flow from our sinful condition, some have grown weary and bitter and have criticized God and complained of His ways, or have even denied Him. Much of the human history is heavily marked with suffering and grief. Much of the Sacred Scripture itself is a record of human sorrow. Though the books of Scripture recall the vast mercies of God and are source of boundless hope and confidence in Him, they are also starkly realistic in noting the tragedies and afflictions the flesh is heir to. But the Scriptures remind us that God does not love human suffering. The person of faith knows that God is infinitely good, that He wills and causes endless blessings for us, and that He does not will any evil at all as inflict punishments, but this is always in the service of the greater good. Most of you say if God is all powerful and good he would remove all evil from the earth, If he does that he would take free will away and we be like Robots. God gave us a freedom to follow him or to do evil acts. We have forgotten about the freedom God gave us and chose evil. Evil is in the world because of Free Will, we choose to be evil or we choose to be good and follow God.   It's on there, All the storms and illnesses are punishments for sinning against God. Not all of us react to ills and sufferings the same way. More than a few persons have cited the presence of evil in the world as their reason for denying the very existence of God.   Perhaps some of the good things God wills to be in this world could not be here without a real risk of genuine evils. The God who gives men freedom "neither wills evil to be done nor wills evil to be done, but He wills to permit evil to be done, and this is a good." And when evils are brought into creation through abuses of the freedom God gives to us, He promises to turn everything toward good. "We know that in everything God works for good with those who love him." An illustration of this is the central event of salvation history: God forbade the malice of His enemies, the treachery of Judas, and the sins of all the world- and yet the bitter passion which resulted from all these was at the same time the greatest act of love and generosity ever known, and was the redemption of the world.  For those about the babies, they were with God; because they were too young to commit sin of this world.  This is called Divine Justice. God is Just. Scripture teaches that no one is to be punished because of the sins of his or her parents; it is for his or her sins that person incurs punishment. (Jer. 31.29-30). Original Sin weakens us and inclines us to sin, but it is not personal sin in the descendants of Adam. Those who die in original Sin, but without having committed any personal grave sins, will not suffer pain of damnation for that.  The losses that we incurred as a result of Original Sin are not losses of anything due to man by right. These losses, then, are not of unfair chastisement by God. the gift of intimate, grace-stirred friendship with the Lord is more than human nature could expect on its own. Freedom from death and from the sufferings that seem to flow from our creaturely state is no clear right of ours. That we have been created at all, and have been given hope, is God's great mercy, the Creator's own free gifts to us.  The many sorrows of human life are by no means of the fruit of original sin. In fact, the most severe and unbearable of human evils are the fruit of our continued deliberate sins. There is a special bitterness in the free and malicious hatreds, betrayals, and ingratitude of life.  The history of the world is a record of sorrows, of sorrows arising from evils that need not have been. Our Sins are not predetermined and inevitable. God gives us freedom, and it is we who choose to abuse that gift by sinning, "Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God; for God cannot be tempted with evil and He Himself tempts no one." (James 1.13) Rather, God offers the help that makes resistance to temptation possible. God "will not let you be tempted beyond your strength, but with temptation will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it" (1 Cor. 10.13). Trials may be too great for our strength, but not too great for His; and we can draw upon His strength if we invoke him. He remains present to us, a Father who cares, ready to fortify us, if we wish to respond to Him, against the terrible tragedy of doing evil, which is far worse than suffering it.<br>  <br>   <br>  |`|p1r2lUJnaa	You are not possessed. An exorcism is basically a mind trick, convincing yourself that you're "cured" of "whatever you had". Take a break, take a walk, read a book, relax, look at the finer points in life. <br>  In my opinion, if you're praying that much and nothing's happening, it's likely not going to help, so you don't have to worry about it. It sounds to me like you're very involved with your religion. Be aware that as nice as your preacher may seem, some of them are only in it to make it seem to you like you have a problem, when you actually don't. Of course not all are like this, but please move with caution.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	From what you say, I doubt if you are "possessed". Possession is a very serious business, and those around you would know there was something very wrong.  Often we have problems and temptations that the evil one can play on to lead us into trouble.  It combines with our own weakness to break down and continue in habits that we know are bad, but they satisfy something in us at the moment.  Find a trained and mature Christian person who can help you break this cycle, or at least direct you to someone who can.  Pray often, trust in God's help, and work to get out of this.  Remember that you are always in God's care, and focusing on a demon as the cause of your problem gives glory to Satan.  Claim the problem as your own, and do not let Satan take any credit.  But get help!  <*)))><|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Oh for crying out loud you are not possesed by a bloody demon, you are just human.<br>  <br>  What exactly is this temptation you are on about anyway?<br>  <br>  If you are referring to sex it is completely natural and nothing to be ashamed of, if you enjoy it then why beat yourself up about it.|`|MA5NqIuNaa	oh my goodness girl, you are not possessed.

If not, then you're not possessed. maybe the people around you are tempting you. maybe you should take some time to be alone with God and not with people who want you to do the things you find sinful. i will pray for you. ask others to pray for you, and keep praying. it's never too late to ask Jesus to represent you. just don't be scared, because we all go through phases of doubt and fear. but to answer your question directly: NO, you're not possessed by Satan! he's just trying to trick you! if you truly want to stop doing what you think is wrong, what tempts, you, then you will someday. until then, even though you're supposed to put your life in God's hands, maybe you should try to gather some of your own strength and just say no. yeah, that sounds corny. well, you'll get through it, i'm sure. if you TRULY want God to represent you and rid you of Satan's temptations, He will. just keep praying. don't give up! God won't let Satan have a hold of you forever! he has a hold of all of us sometimes, but God is always watching. remember that, and once again, just don't give up! hope i helped...|`|td6WXhv4aa	<br>  <br>  Pray to Jesus daily and invite him and the Lord into your heart accept him as your savior and repent of all your sins.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	You're not possessed - but if you'd like I can exorcise you.

iuoB7pf0aa	Here's the deal: <br>  <br>  If there's no sperm to fertilize the egg it's not a baby yet, it does not yet have a soul. <br>  <br>  I hate the argument "It's my body, I'll do what I want with it!!" what a crock! It's not your body, if it's your body then how can the baby have  a different blood type then you, how can the baby be the opposite sex than you if it's your body? YOU don't have two hearts, the baby has a heart, and you have a heart and you don't have two heartbeats until there's ANOTHER being in you. A human life. LIFE. Something that has a heartbeat is alive.<br>  <br>  Did you know that the baby feels pain? At seven weeks the baby has developed pain receptors, that means that the baby is ONE BIG NERVE and it can feel everything going on. It can feel being torn apart. If you've ever seen an abortion from the inside of a woman you know that the baby cries and tries to fight off the vacuum that is sucking apart it's body. If you've seen an abortion you know that the baby is suffering terribly. <br>  <br>  A baby and the mother are not one and the same. They are two different beings. <br>  <br>  If a woman doesn't want a baby then she shouldn't have been irresponsible enough to get pregnant. Why punish the baby because of YOUR mistake... YOUR MISTAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YOURS!<br>  Abortion isn't the answer to not being able to keep your legs closed. It's not the baby's fault just because you can't learn how to use some from of birth control. Why is abortion wrong? Because it's murder.... plain out MURDER. It's disgusting how you liberal woman think that it's ok to kill someone just because you don't want the hassle of taking care of a child when YOU are the one that didn't bother to use birth control. <br>  <br>   Why are people throwing such a fit about animals being killed for food but they won't say anything about a child? <br>  <br>  Did you know that almost 4000 people died in 9/11? 9/11 happens every day in the US but no one says anything about it because babies can't defend themselves, because babies can't speak up and say No. Thanks to people like you there will be millions of more abortions. <br>  <br>  I hope that you grow up and give a little thought to someone other than your selfish little self. What if you're mom would have aborted you? When a woman gets an abortion the baby doesn't get a choice, it doesn't have a say. Though it has a beating heart, it cries, it feels pain, it has it's own blood type, and can be a different sex than you.... Sorry, it's not your body. It's a whole separate body that you chose to create through your own irresponsibility. If you are woman enough to have sex, then you're woman enough to take care of a child and own up to the responsibilities.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  <br>  It IS a baby, and it IS alive otherwise it wouldn't have a heartbeat or a soul. At conception a child has a soul, that makes them human, that makes it a baby, that makes it life. <br>  <br>  As for making a mistake: Like I said, if you were responsible enough to be having sex then you're responsible enough to care for a baby. It's absolutely selfish to have an abortion just because you don't want the hassle of your own mistake and it shouldn't be taken out on an innocent life. It is the shedding of blood.

HN693GiNaa	I'm really glad you asked...I think blind faith (in religion, world leaders, what we see on television..etc) can bring about wonderful things like hope in people, but I also believe it has caused most of what is wrong with the world today.  The bible, like any important religious document (like the koran) was probably written based on some fact a long time ago in an ancient language.  It has been translated thousands of times and has been subject to the translators personal religious views and beliefs also...Anyone who bothers to do historic factual research will easily discover that much debate surrounds the translations, even such things as Jesus being the 'son' of God as opposed to being the 'sun' itself and the tweleve apostles being improperly translated as the 12 major star constellations etc. I'm not saying I believe one way or another- But enough evidence indicates the bible, at best, is a long mythological story made up of many metaphores and interpretations and anyone who takes it as gospel is very naive.  No one alive today was there when it was written so NOONE can say definitively whether it is a factual document or not.  Congratualtions on thinking for yourself and questioning the world around you.|`|sw08ARSZaa	Well I know the bible on my shelf is real because I've held it in my hand and felt it.<br>  <br>  As to its contents, no most of it is mythology. There are references to actual places and events, but there are no contemporaneous accounts of the story of Jesus. None of the gospels were written until some 3 or 4 decades after Jesus supposedly died. <br>  <br>  There are however dozens of savior myths that pre date the story of Jesus by up to 1000 years. Myths which contain very similar themes like being born of a virgin on December 25th, turning water into wine, walking on water, dying by crucifixion and rising from the dead 3 days later.<br>  <br>  There is strong evidence that the story of Jesus is merely an interpolation of earlier occurring myths which in turn were simply allegory for astrological observations.|`|5bd10edb4281ab3a9206fc74459227efaa	You either believe in it or you don't. Simple as that. It would be hard to say whether anyone saw it being written... hence, no one is alive from that era, but there is evidence of old biblical ruins and ancient biblical writings.  The proof is there it's just what you make of it.|`|kL9t9TQKaa	Whether you believe it or not does not change the fact that the Bible is real and that God has does and will exist. It is God breathed and was written by a diverse group of people over centuries of time. Yet its message is complete and whole. The Bible explains the creation of the world. The world we see and live in screams of a Creator. How absurd to think that all this happened just by chance. Consider the prophesies written in different times which have come and are coming true. Consider Jesus, Do you consider Him a good moral teacher? Jesus Christ claimed to be God! Either He told the truth or told a lie. If He told a lie His life and ministry ranks as among the most reckless and evil scandals mankind has ever known. If He told the truth and He did then all His teachings and the life He lived are upright and stand pure and just and testify to the holiness and righteousness of God. The Bible expains the sinful state of man. Just read the news friend, it is no doubt that mankind is plauged with a blight that it itself cannot fix. Best of all my own life. Friend, before Jesus lived in me i was a hopeless case, the worst amongs sinners. If a book containing everything i thought and did before i knew Christ was published for all to see i would have wished to find a hole to crawl into and never return. But praise God I came to the realization my lost condition and of my inability to justify myself. I was a miserable wretch. I cried out to Jesus and He came into my life justifying me through His death on the cross and taking upon Himself God's wrath for my own sins. And he continues to live in me and renew me day by day as I daily give up my own life and live for Him. I am dead to sin and things of evil for I am a new creation in Christ. Friend, it is not about who I am or what I have done, no, It is about who Christ is and what He has done. Praise be to Jesus Christ!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness<br>  Romans 1:19-21 (New International Version)<br>  19since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. <br>  <br>   21For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.<br>  <br>  Romans 3<br>   21But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 22This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, 23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement,[i] through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished— 26he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.|`|02eopur0aa	Look....it's like a puzzle...you can't just look at one piece..you have to look at the big picture...without any bias...read the entire bible...it tells of a story of the ONE HOLY GOD whom loves HIS creations and provides a way back to HIMSELF after they disobeyed HIM! The bible was written by over 30 people over 1500 years and is consistent within itself cause it was divinely inspired by the creator.There is a lot of outside information{not from any of JESUS' followers}that tell of the same stories and miracles.|`|6tYQEwxGaa	The fact that there are hundreds of contradictions in the bible proves it's not true. <br>  <br>  This is not opinion.

h5q89E3Haa	Read the following:<br>  <br>  Pope to Pelosi: Catholics cannot back abortion<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29256800/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29256800/</a>|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>Does the Pope really have that little real authority or influence over his supposed flock?<<<br>  <br>  Yes, which is why it is ridiculous to think Pius XII could have just told Hitler to knock it off.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) If the Pope is pro-life, why are a lot of catholics pro-choice ?<br>  <br>  Actually, it doesn't really matter what the pope "is" regarding political issues.  However, the official teachings of the Roman Catholic Church *are* supposed to be important to Roman Catholics.  Of course, there aren't a bunch of Roman Catholic goons visiting Roman Catholics and interrogating them on their beliefs to see if they agree on every point with official doctrine - and, because there aren't, there is no way for the Roman Catholic Church to *enforce* their doctrine on individual members, nor do they wish to do so.  Christianity is a free choice - if a nominal Christian chooses to live an unChristian life (I'm speaking generally, here, not pro-Abortion) then the onus is on that nominal Christian to follow Christian practices.  The onus is NOT on anyone else to force someone claiming to be a Christian to live as a Christian.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) so why then when the pope is against abortion, are so many catholics for abortion ? <br>  <br>  Again, it doesn't (officially) matter what the pope "is against".  What is supposed to matter to Roman Catholics is the official teachings of the church.  In this case, the teaching is that abortion is a sin, and performing an abortion or "conspiring" to perform an abortion is equal to murder.<br>  <br>  AS a comparative example, a Roman Catholic could hold the opinion, "all homosexuals should be executed".  As long as that person never executes a homosexual, he is not guilty of the sin of murdering a homosexual.  Similarly, as long as a pro-Abortion Roman Catholic does not actually aid in the implementation of an actual abortion, they are not guilty of murder.  However, a Roman Catholic being pro-Abortion is dangerous:  it's unlikely, but it's possible that a Roman Catholic voting for a pro-Abortion candidate could be responsible for the accomplishment of actual abortions.  This should make it more clear:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/abortio2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/abort...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  3) Does the Pope really have that little real authority or influence over his supposed flock ?<br>  <br>  Of course.  How many religious leaders control the every thought and every opinion of every member of their church?  How many even desire such control?  (OK , there's a few that probably do, but not most.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.</a> com/selector_rc.html|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Lets look at it this way it's illegal to steal but people still do it.

This says that if you follow a certain code--lots of praying, research, thought, etc.--and come to an honest conscientious decision that you disagree with the teachings of the Church, that it is OK. You aren't supposed to preach your dissent to others though.<br>  <br>  Personally I am against abortion, but I do think it's important to allow people to examine their beliefs without threatening that they won't be Catholic if they disagree.  Otherwise everybody might just force themselves to believe whatever the Church is saying without thinking for themselves, and this could perpetuate an incorrect belief. Rome is not infallible; well, unless the pope speaks infallibly, but that's only happened like once.|`|oaEqLAT7aa	If Catholics don't agree on issues of the Church, such as that, they are not true Catholics.

806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	The idea started in the Middle Ages.  During Lent, people would not eat meat at all, and on Fat Tuesday, they would eat all the meat in the household.  Then, during Lent, instead of eating meat, they would donate the money they would have spent on meat to the poor instead.<br>  <br>  Eventually that evolved to just abstaining from meat on Fridays.  This really only applies to Catholics.  If it's not Lent, Catholics can eat meat on Friday, and sometimes during Lent Catholics can eat meat on Fridays.  For example, Pope JPII gave a dispensation for Catholics to eat meat on March 17th, St. Patrick's day, because it fell on a Friday.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	It's just a tradition. You sacrifice something you like, to remember all the sacrifices Jesus made for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually, you're never supposed to eat meat on Fridays. However, I live in New Orleans, which is a town with VERY good seafood, so it isn't much of a sacrifice not to eat meat. So, instead, I just eat very plain and simple. After all, what's more of a sacrifice? A ham sandwich, or crawfish etouffee? Besides, the tradition of abstinence was supposedly started by a priest who owned a seafood store, so who knows?|`|1TYZDRUqaa	It is supposed to recall the sacrifices Jesus made for you.  By giving up something, you can feel Jesus's pain.  It used to be every Friday, not just during lent.  Many Orthodox churches still follow this principle.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The idea is to unite our own meager sacrifice with Jesus' perfect sacrifice.<br>  <br>  It's called mortification.

vMf7pL9Aaa	That is interesting from my understanding the Vatican II still upheld Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.  I do however know that anti-pope John Paul II was trying to change that with his ecumenical movement, but the Vatican II still upholds Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.  At any rate there are many errors within the Second Vatican Counsel, Pope John XXIII (who started the Vatican II) who was built up as a saintly and perfect pope, the good man of our time -- whether consciously or unconsciously, did more damage to the Church than possibly any other individual man had ever done in the whole of its history.... It seemed almost as though Pope John was operating on behalf of the devil without being in any way conscious of it.  Whatever Pope John's disposition was, however, before the second session of the council could open, he died. His last words on his deathbed, as reported by Jean Guitton, the only Catholic layman to serve as a peritus at the Council, were: "Stop the Council; stop the Council." In any case, it is a fact that Pope John signed not one document of the Second Vatican Council. <br>  <br>  We must also keep in mind that sedevacantism is heretical.  As for Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus it is not just cut and dry:<br>  <br>  Anyone unaware of Jesus or not having the proper witness to be Catholic but never the less doing what Jesus intended can enter Heaven.  This includes not only figures from the Old Testament but also those of other faiths or beliefs unintentionally believing falsely.  If one is open to truth and upon finding it puts it into practice and does the best he or she can to love their neighbor as themselves, they will now or eventually be in Heaven. <br>  <br>  If however a Catholic raised in the truth and then departs from it and fails to return confessing his sins then he or she comes under the concept of Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.  This applies to those of other faiths who know the truth of the Catholic Church but fail to accept the true faith.<br>  <br>  Mortal sin excludes entry into Purgatory, but what constitutes mortal sin for a particular individual is subject to God's judgement, justice, and mercy.<br>  <br>  Rom. 2:14 For when the Gentiles who do not have the law by nature observe the prescriptions of the law they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law.  [natural law]<br>  1 Cor. 5:12 For why should I be judging outsiders? Is it not your business to judge those within?  13 God will judge those outside. "Purge the evil person from your midst."<br>  <br>  Those who try to do right but do not have proper information regarding the Lord are judged upon their deeds.  Those who love right and truth enter Heaven along with those who have known the Lord and have acted from the same love.<br>  <br>  Jews, protestants, and pagans can get into Heaven if they love God, do what is right, and do not have satisfactory information regarding the fullness of truth as we know it.<br>  <br>  God is just.  He does not convict anyone because of their lack of knowledge.  He is concerned with the right they do.|`|AnRTn8yAaa	Catholic will follow the Pope as the Vicar of Christ..so Vatican II is valid...<br>  <br>  Jesus said, "Not everyone who calls me Lord will get in to the kingdom of heaven...only those who.."<br>  <br>  Please read Matthew 7:21-23 and 25:31-46...<br>  <br>  Didn't Jesus praise the Samaritans and the Roman soldiers who don't know the real God but still following what God wants?

You have to realize that even tho other Christians are not Catholic, they are not completely outside the Church, They baptize, they have the bible, and they follow it to salvation. These are Catholic Traditions. The Church modernized the liturgy, and made it more accessible in the local languages. The Church trusts the salvation of non Christians and pagans to the mercy of God. The Jews are still the chosen people, and they have a covenant relationship with Him. They have a place in the economy of salvation. We try to not be more Catholic than the Pope. Pax Christi|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>Is that true? Does that mean every single non-Catholic is going to hell, no matter what?<<<br>  <br>  Only the Catholic Church can authentically interpret her own documents.

There has been much discussion by a couple of groups who have been excommunicated by there anti Vatican2 stance.I'm in no position nor have enough knowledge to properly address that particular grievance.But i do know that the Church has never condemned people to Hell because they were Jew or Atheist on those grounds alone. It just was not well explained and Vatican2 attempted to clarify so that non Catholics would have a better understanding of church teaching. So basically as i now understand it the Church officially teaches that if a person lives a good clean and holy life with the understanding they have that GOD in his mercy will take them into Heaven. What the Church was doing at Vatican 2 was just trying to open the doors and let fresh air in so that there was better understanding and no infallible Church teachings were changed just better explained.

Only JESUS saves. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

E0lMycUeaa	ISLAM comes from the root "slm" or "salama". The word ISLAM in reference to the faith is understood in Arabic as the:<br>   <br>  ISLAM means<br>  <br>  Surrender "Give up evil and lusts - give in to the Creator"<br>  <br>  Submission"Agree to the terms and conditions of being a servant of Almighty God"<br>  <br>  Obedience "Comply with His Commandments to the best of your ability"<br>  <br>  Sincerity "Do it all whether or not anyone else notices or cares."<br>  <br>  Peace "Accept what Almighty God gives you in this life in serenity."<br>  <br>  <br>  All of which come about only by giving up the Free Will of the nafs (self or ego) in favor of the Will of the Creator and Sustainer of All That Exists (ALLAH).<br>  <br>  This would be similar to the teaching in the Lord's Prayer for the Christians, when Jesus, peace be upon him, taught his followers a prayer asking for "God's Will to be done on earth as it is in Heaven." (Matt. 6)<br>  <br>  ISLAM is mention in the Quran as a "deen" or way of life of an individual. A complete way of living in balance with everything else in the creation of Almighty Allah. ISLAM provides inclusive instructions for everything including eating, sleeping, dealing in relationships, economics, politics, health, worship and even death. The entire universe is "IN ISLAM" because it is all a part of what has been created and is being sustained by Almighty Allah.<br>  <br>  Now let us consider the next logical question; "What does the term "Muslim" actually mean?"<br>  <br>  Again, we must keep in mind that it is an Arabic word and is of course subject to the rules of the Arabic language. Actually, it is derived from the word ISLAM. Whereas, you might think of ISLAM as the verb or action and MUSLIM as the noun, or the one performing the action. In English whenever we have a noun performing a verb, we add the two suffix letters; ER. But in the Arabic language many times you will find that the prefix letters of MU are used for the same purpose.<br>  <br>  A few examples may help to better understand. We will compare the verb of each language to the one who is reforming the verb:<br>  <br>  Preforming the verbs in ENGLISH/Preforming the verbs in ARABIC<br>  <br>  Travel =  TravelER  /   Safar =  MUsafar<br>  Call =  CallER    / Adhan =  MUadhan<br>  Pray =  PrayER    / Salah =  MUsalah<br>  Submit =  Submit ER    / Islam =  MUslim<br>  A "MUSLIM" is one who follows or practices the action of "ISLAM"<br>  <br>  In English, when we understand the "ISLAM" is an action, we might say that anyone who "Islams" is an "Islam-ER." Right? in Arabic the "mu" preceding a verb indicates the same thing. Therefore, we would understand that the one who is actively doing the verb of "Islam" [submission to God] is a "Mu"-Islam or "Muslim."<br>  <br>  Make sense?<br>  <br>  Now, we should ask, "How does a person become a MUSLIM?"<br>  <br>  Only when a person is willing to submit to the Commandments of the Higher Authority from Above, meaning to obey Allah on His terms as much as possible does he/she become a " MUSLIM."|`|29X6EEsKaa	Ok, this is just baiting.

For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” And Jesus practiced what he preached, for although foxes have dens and birds have roosts, he had nowhere to lay his head.We must therefore, be content with sustenance and covering while “seeking first the kingdom.”|`|R49w1Dr7aa	Crystal is correct. Think of God first, in every situation. The Kingdom are the Godly principles that we have been taught from Scripture. Loving God first, then others and doing good not evil.

wY8jE8HEaa	“O Messenger of God,” he said, “Is it here that your Lord commanded you to bring us.”<br>  <br>  Moses replied.  “Yes.”[6]<br>  <br>  “The companions of Moses said, ‘We are sure to be overtaken.’<br>  <br>  Moses said, ‘Nay.  Verily, the Lord is with me, and He will guide me.’” (Quran 26:62)<br>  <br>  When the Pharaoh and his army were clearly visible to the people, Moses was commanded:<br>  <br>  “…Strike a dry path for them in the sea (with your staff), fearing neither to be overtaken (by the Pharaoh), nor afraid (of being drowned)!” (Quran 20:77)<br>  <br>  “…And it parted, each separate part becoming like a huge mountain.” (Quran 26:63)<br>  <br>  The people, seeing the dried sea bed as the way to safety, descended onto it, led by Moses, and fled across the sea.  Seeing the receding ranks of fugitives disappearing before his astonished eyes, the Pharaoh charged down to the shoreline.  Looking at the towering walls of water, in suspended stasis, he was assailed by awe, but suppressed it.  He paraded along the ranks of his troops, trying to turn around the events to his advantage:<br>  <br>  ‘Look how the sea has parted for me!’  He said, ‘so that I can catch these fleeing servants of mine.”[7]  Thus encouraged, the whole host plunged onto the dried out sea bed in hot pursuit.<br>  <br>  As Moses oversaw the last of his flock emerging from the sea on the other side, he raised his staff to close off the path behind them; but God commanded him to keep moving:<br>  <br>  “Leave the sea as it is; Verily, they are a host to be drowned.” (Quran 44:24)<br>  <br>  The End of the Pharaoh|`|AA11232725	Exodus 14:21  Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided.  <br>  <br>  22  So the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.  23  And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.  <br>  <br>  24  Now it came to pass, in the morning watch, that the LORD looked down upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He troubled the army of the Egyptians.  25  And He took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians."  <br>  <br>  26  Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen."  27  And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when the morning appeared, the sea returned to its full depth, while the Egyptians were fleeing into it. So the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.  <br>  <br>  28  Then the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. Not so much as one of them remained.  29  But the children of Israel had walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.  <br>  <br>  30  So the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.  31  Thus Israel saw the great work which the LORD had done in Egypt; so the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD and His servant Moses.|`|ZoPln7vaaa	Exodus 14|`|8IHfytEvaa	Exodus 14<br>  <br>  And God was the one to part the Rea Sea, not Moses.<br>  <br>  Michael Rood has found the spot and videotaped it along with the coralized left overs of the Egyptian Army.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.michaelroodministries.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaelroodministries.com/</a><br>  <br>  I've seen it on TV, its for real!|`|AA11622701	The second book of the Bible - Exodus, and in its 14th chapter.|`|AA11220299	Exodus 14|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Exodus|`|pCLC481qaa	The account begins @ Exodus 14:21|`|qpjorXRnaa	Um, Moses did not part the red sea, God did.

Look at the world and you can see that when we didn't know the answers to simple things like lightning and rain and things like that, we had separate gods for every small thing unexplained by the world as they knew it. As time went on, they started to see the answers to a lot of these problems and realized that it wasn't gods controlling them, but after that there was still things unexplained. To still answer these things, people came up with the idea of just one god who was the only god and all knowing and all powerful.

His reasoning?  "Sure as hell in fifty years, some son of a ***** is going to deny this ever happened, and I want documentary evidence that it did!"<br>  <br>  The Third Reich killed 12 million people in concentration camps in WWII.  Most of these deaths took place in Poland.  About half of these were Jews who had been removed from their homes in Nazi occupied Europe and shipped eastward.  This is an established fact.  I have encountered Holocaust deniers, and I have objectively examined the evidence they have presented.  I've learned that there were nuances to the Holocaust that are not addressed by the western media, but most of the claims of the Holocaust deniers are without merit.<br>  <br>  We know nothing about Muhammad except what is passed on in Islamic religious texts.  There was no contact worth recording on the part of non-Arabs with Islam until after muhammad was dead.  So if I choose to make fun of him, the only tools with which I have to do so are YOUR scriptures!  This isn't a problem for me, because at least your early Islamic biographers were intellectualy honest, and didn't editorialize.  There's plenty about Muhammad in your scripture to poke fun at, if you would quit treating him like a groupie treats a rock star and actually take an objective look at the man.<br>  <br>  I'm aware that in some countries like Germany it's illegal to deny the holocaust.  I think this is misguided.  I think the question should be raised, and examined, and looked at and effectively rebutted.  To make it illegal sounds little like someone's trying to hide something.  This is a tender subject for germans, and I think they went a little overboard on it.  Here in America, there is no such law, but good luck getting any traction with it, because we have had this debate before, and the deniers always get their butts kicked.<br>  <br>  If you don't allow anyone to criticize your beloved prophet, then how do you know you know the truth about him?  How do you know you're not just living in an Islaimic echo chamber, and that the truth has been denied to you because the powers that be are afriad you'll renounce Islam if you knew the truth?  Doesn't it bother you that Bibles are illegal in Saudi Arabia?  You always say there is no compulsion in religion under islam, but then they make it illegal to practice other religions, and you are not allowed to examine the evidence on your own and draw your own conclusions.  That is totalitarian mind control, not freedom.|`|AA11974194	They are both freedom of speech. Germany, might be the only exception to this.

UIJorsD7aa	Being Jewish (and orthodox), I can tell you for a fact that the concept of "chosenness" does not imply any sense of superiority.<br>  After all, Judaism is the ONLY religion which teaches that ALL moral people merit heaven, regardless of their religious beliefs, affiliations, or lack thereof.<br>  Chosenness does imply a special uniqueness.<br>  Historically, it goes back to Abraham. Abraham lived in a world steeped in idolatry, which he concluded was contradicted by the reality of design in nature.<br>  So Abraham came to a belief in God, and took upon himself the mission of teaching others of the monotheistic ideal. Abraham was even willing to suffer persecution for his beliefs. After years of enormous effort, dedication and a willingness to accept the responsibility to be God's representative in this world, God chose Abraham and his descendants to be the teachers of this monotheistic message.<br>  In other words it is not so much that God chose the Jews; it is more accurate that the Jews (through Abraham) chose God.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	To bring forth Messiah..thru the line of Judah.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	Sorry but you're never going to understand Judaism very well if you insist on using Christian definitions of terms.<br>  <br>  But then, from the rest of your question, I'm guessing that you have no interest in understanding Judaism at all.

The Jewish people have suffered many indignities in their lives, today people still want to drive them into the seas. They were chosen as a people that God would show His power through them, He gave them the ten commandments, He promised them a Messiah, He delivered them out of slavery (one good testimony God does not condone slavery)  God has blessed them as a nation and He kept all promises made to them. So that we by believing that Christ is the Messiah, we are also adopted into the House of Israel,and we also as Christians should be shining light among those who still persists in their unbelieve.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	If you are really interested to know why the Jews were chosen and what happened to the choice, you need to read Chapter Children of Israel in Holy Quran. Quran is a continuation of Bible. It vividly describes the causes for rise and fall of nations with particular reference to Jews.<br>  <br>  In fact Abraham was chosen to lead the nations, after he was tested by God three times. Then he prayed for his progeny and God curtly replied: ' My promise does not reach the arrogant !". But Jewish rabbis convently forget the condition of righteousness  and  waived it from the book thus  allowing Jews to charge interest, collect money by fraud and exploitation. Adultery and disrespect to sabbath became a routine. So they were punished twice, for which they were informed in advance. Last time they were punished for knowingly rejecting Jesus Christ and a Greek Army under th command of General Titus crushed them and killed them in hundreds of thousands. Their young women were taken prisioner and the young men were made slaves. A total of 600,000 slaves. And just as Jesus predicted, not one stone of temple of Solomon remained on the other. Their diaspora started for 2000 years.<br>  Then they came to know that the last prophet will rise in Medinah. So they went their in good numbers and waited for him. When the prophet did come, they found him exactly as specified in their books. But they rejected him knowingly as they had rejected Jesus. This time their plea was that he was not a descandent of Isac, even though he was a descandent of  Ishmael, the first born son of Abraham from another wife. God Almighty then promised that till end of time, He will keep rising kings and leaders who would punish them and they will have to seek refuge of God or the people.( Remember the American constitution starts thus " We the people" and it is USA  who is protecting the Israel ) That explains the masacres of Jews by Nabucaddnazer and Hitler etc.<br>  <br>  But if you still talk to a Jew he will take pride in being a Jew, claime to be a chosen one and brush aside the other nations as goyem.  <br>  <br>  <br>                                         Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|lh8Tn02Naa	I'll be very surprised if this one lasts the night, but let's see.<br>  <br>  The Jews believed themselves to be chosen.  Racial groups tend to give themselves airs in this way.  Once you realize that this is just a piece of mythology, the form of your question collapses.  What were they chosen to do?  They preserved their own identity as best they could, in the face of prejudice and discrimination which among other things forced them into "usury", and of which your question is an unpleasant example.

zjzfWaGXaa	well I would say it entirely depends on whether he is out or not. A straight guy might be acting like that and not realize it or an out gay guy might be flirting as you suspect but one thing I have noticed is that closet guys are usually very guarded so as not to give themselves away (which personally was just to damn much work for me) and I can't see a closeted guy behaving that way.

Although certain occultists--namely certain types of chaos magicians--like parodying and also seriously using the Necronomicon in spell work, Lovecraft was not into any kind of occult. He was a pulp science fiction writer who was trying to make a living by  exploring existential fear/horror.  In this way, he was something of an artist and a philosopher but he probably would not have thought of himself in this way. Other people have parodied the Necromonicon and like to "make believe" that it is "true," but this is really just fun and games, like going to a haunted house at an amusement park.  <br>  <br>  If Mom can't deal with that, then let a good friend keep the book for you or find an offsite place to store it and try to be patient with Mom until you're old enough to be in your own space with your own stuff.<br>  <br>  Edit: Actually ex-occultist/chaos mage Phil Hine has written thoughtful material about the Necronomicon material as a way to get in touch with your own fears and either overcome them (or go crazy for examining them). That is not merely occult, it is a mystical orientation to the work.
funeSrxUaa	The bulk of the current events discussing 2012 is the Mayan calendar and that the world will end in 2012. The main problem that I see is the Mayans were neither Greek nor Roman and the calendar that we use today is the Gregorian calendar which is based on the Greco-Roman calendar. They (the Mayans) didn't use the exact same date (the time of the birth of Christ) as the Romans did for the year 1. The Mayans were destroyed centuries before the Spanish came to the Americas.<br>  Different cultures have differing calendars. According to the Jewish calendar we are over the year 6000. (I'm not real sure the exact year) The Chinese calendar is also well above the year 2009. The problem is people are using an ancient calendar system and trying to convert it to the Gregorian calendar system and say, "See this proves the world will end at such and such time."<br>  It is not our job to figure out when the world will end, but to be prepared and to prepare others for the time that it will end.|`|TL6c0Ntcaa	Strangely enough I have a copy of the 3rd Letter of Fatima.

The bible does say tho', that IT is not, the foundation or the bulwark for truth, but that the CHURCH is. 1tim. 3-16.  That is why the bible is not a guide for the church, but rather the church is the guide for the bible.  remember, the apostles had to go out and teach the truth to the world, they had no bible to pass out, so we can say that the "church" is the foundation of truth, and pillar for truth, as the apostles have given testimony to by word of mouth and  teaching and the passing on of the fullness of the revelation of Jesus to us.  If someone does not hear what they say they do not hear what Jesus said. The bible simply reports this truth. "He who does not hear you, does not hear me, and he who rejects you, rejects me" that is Jesus speaking.   So do you understand alittle better now?|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	The Bible is a book that has the compilations of many writings, these writings are Divine Traditions that have been put in written form.

He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."<br>  <br>  Therefore, we know by this that it's not a mark that people will be tricked into taking -- it's something that's given as a result of a person's decision to bow down and worship the Antichrist.

funeSrxUaa	Yes he was and for those who want proof, as they say, the proof is in the pudding.<br>  This is an excerpt from this very book.  "At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the n-gro or the Australian and the gorilla.” (Descent of Man, Chapter Six: On the Affinities and Genealogy of Man, On the Birthplace and Antiquity of Man). Darwin taught the inferiority of certain humans, specifically the dark skinned humans of the Afrikaners and the Australian Aborigines. Why is this teaching overlooked by those who support evolution?<br>  <br>  Also the term race here in the title, and by looking at the context of the book, truly is about various types of humans, in the eyes of Darwin.  He called the Afrikaners and the Aborigines savages and that they would be exterminated.  This is a continuation of his theory of survival of the fittest.  He saw that they were "less than human" and would soon be wiped out.  He even uses another Professors analogy of the apes and compares them to humans.<br>  <br>  Hitler even credited Darwin with the idea to wipe out the Jewish race.  In his book Mein Kampf he often quotes from this work by Darwin.|`|fEkKuGlEaa	I am a devout Christian and Darwin was not a racist, nor did he recant his theory on his deathbed.

His family were involved in anti-slavery activities and one of his motivations in presenting the theory of evolution was to make clear (without stating it, until his later book on human evolution) that humans were all the same species ("race" in the parlance of the time).  Some justified slavery by making out that black people were not of the human species.  Darwin was quite clear that all humans are human, are one species.  Of course, at the time he was writing there were attitudes which pretty much everyone held which we might term racism, but for his time he was exceptionally enlightened on this issue.  "Favoured races" meant the species that survived because of their adaptation to their environment.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  try taking a look at <a href="http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_releases/darwins_sacred_cause_ending_racism_and_slavery" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_r...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16503-hatred-of-slavery-drove-darwin-to-emancipate-all-life.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16...</a><br>  That second link, from the New Scientist, has this: "Darwin's family was passionately abolitionist and he continually mixed with people devoted to the cause.

Jesus said that he was the Way, so it's possible that those who do not believe in Him will not go there.<br>  <br>  However, God's mercy is unbounded and cannot be limited by what we think.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you don't believe in God, why would you want to spend eternity with Him?  We really don't know what Hell is like except for separation from God.<br>  <br>  As a Catholic, we believe in much more than accepting Jesus as a personal savior.|`|EOQ03aAeaa	In all the world, he probably best embodies and emulates the teachings of Jesus.

7258da4c2329311982666e5727f6ae14aa	I've always seen those who live for tomorrow as people that don't take responsibility for what they do today. There is no need to save money today because there will be more money in the future. What happens in the future is so important to them that they fail to enjoy what they have here and now. To let their loved ones know that they are loved is not important today because in the future they have plans to tell it in a better way. They fail to find happiness in what they have, their happiness is tied to realizing their dreams one day in the future. <br>  <br>  I've also seen those who live as this day as it's the last as people that deal with life here and now and don't push things into the future. Saving money today makes sense since they don't know if they will have any in the future. They don't want to die regretting that they didn't do this or that, and they don't want to have unresolved issues. They let everyone they love know that, they don't wait until tomorrow to tell those important things. They find ways to be happy in this time and place and they enjoy the good things that they have in life since they can't be certain about what the future can bring. <br>  <br>  Per my definition I live for today, per your definition I live for tomorrow.

eokH64z0aa	Ignorance. <br>  <br>  The louder an ignorant person speaks, the more intelligent they seemingly are (well, at least to other ignorant people).<br>  <br>  We are supposedly the land of the free, but apparently that freedom only applies if you stick to the status quo.It is a sad sad world we live in when someones sexuality determines whether they meet the "criteria" to be considered worthy of human rights.<br>  <br>  There are also those who claim marriage is between a man and a woman - you get married so your able to continue to populate the earth. But in that thinking - if they ban gay couple mainly because of inability to have children, then why not ban a sterile couple from marriage? Or a woman who doean't want children?|`|KszocgnSaa	Nothings wrong with it.

People said it was gross, unnatural, a biblical abomination, and so forth. <br>   <br>  It's interesting how they parallel so well.<br>   <br>  Interracial marriage did not destroy society, and neither will gay marriage.|`|zIiiqNGBaa	Nothing is wrong about same sex marriage. People who use the bible and the word of God should go repent for braking the 2 commandment. Using the word of God for hate is wrong. God does not promote hatred, he promotes love and equality. You guys should help Gay people to encourage them that they have the same opportunity to go to heaven as much as any other person. |`|nT0w6VIKaa	Some (very sick) people just find it difficult to be happy unless they are able to, somehow, make others unhappy...it's sick!  They might well remember...what goes around, comes around...  Most people who voted 'for' Prop. 8 only proved their ignorance about religion and faith in God...if they knew 'the facts' they would have gladly voted 'against' Prop. 8.  It's unfortunate that, of all organizations, the churches had to stoop to lies and innuendo to push "their agenda" through.  Has it occured to anyone 'where' the churches got their money...AND how much 'really' good things could have been done for the poor with that money instead of spreading lies and hatred...makes one wonder, seriously, just 'who' leads such organizations...sounds Satanic to  me...|`|on4ThDkQaa	I guess it's more moral and religious problems.|`|bded02b532d2b717a49bde8dc9516d8eaa	Because being gay is wrong. It has never been right, and will never be right. Now, same sex marriage is wrong because marriage has always been between a man and a women, for centuries, to change that overnight, come-on. And not only that, it is a biblical institution ordained by God in the bible, now why would someone who obviously doesn't believe in God, want to be in an institution ordained by him in his word. Because of equality, right, well first of all even if a gay person gets married they will not be equal because what they are doing is unequal and still frowned upon. But also that right will cause a negative revolution in the way people think. If you support an action it becomes normal. People who believe in God don't want to give a foot, because then they are compromising their beliefs. It is a principle, these days there are less and less people who believe in principles. To me I guess it's really about my beliefs and because I was raised in a family of 7 children, two parents, a mom and dad, and I see the value in that arrangement. It is for the betterment of the family and the future. The other way is unnatural, dangerous, doesn't benefit the family, and will give a liscense for backward thinking society full of disease and a loss of morality.  Romans 1:28- And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient. <br>  |`|cbTGufC5aa	What's wrong is that same-sex marriage advocates are trying to change the definition of marriage, a prospect that the vast majority of Americans do not want, as we saw in the recent election. <br>  <br>  With civil unions, gays have all the rights that heterosexual couples have. No one is telling them they can't love each other, live together and form civil unions. <br>  <br>  But it's never really been about rights with them. They want the word "marriage" to apply to their unions. Why? Because they want government to validate their union as equal to traditional marriage. But we all know that it's not, just like everyone knows that polygamy is not equal to traditional marriage. Or should we change the definition of marriage to include polygamy? Don't they love each other? Don't they have rights?<br>  <br>  Why should the term "marriage" continue to be reserved for traditional marriage? For two main reasons: because only a man and a woman can produce children (something that is vital to society) and because it provides those children with a father and a mother (something that every child should have). Same-sex unions do neither. <br>  <br>  So "marriage" is a special designation that all societies and governments throughout time have reserved for one type of union--that of one man and one woman. <br>  <br>  Thus when we consider same-sex marriage, it's not right to think of opponents as wanted to ban anything. All they want to do is to continue to reserve the special designation of "marriage" for the one union that is vital to society.|`|af35qp5faa	The best way to answer this question is to not respond with some kind of message of gay or lesbian bashing but with this.  When you take a plug and socket(male and female ends respectively), you can plug the male end into the female end and produce something.  This something could be light, movement, etc. but two male ends(plugs) or two female ends(sockets) when joined together produces nothing.  It is not natural and read Romans 1.|`|RHeX63vKaa	>> I guess those people are more idiot than the real idiot..who else in this earth want to be gay or lesbian if they knew that they might discriminate by others??..where all created equal by God that means being gay or lesbian should have equal rights as what a so called normal people have..

Nor is stopping a gay couple from getting married gong to make a gay person become heterosexual.<br>  <br>  I think it would be better if ignorant and stupid people weren't allowed to get married or better yet reproduce then the world would be a better place

Fragments of it broke off and collided and collided until our planets came to be. Then, after a period of cooling down, water came down after the bonding of hydrogen and oxygen. When oceans covered the earth, it wasn't like today's oceans. It was a more like a soup, which is called primordial ooze. Nucleic acids rose from those, turned into proteins, turned into amino acids. These amino acids turned into single celled prokaryotes. These eventually evolved into multicelluar organisms, which lived in the ocean until one fish had a mutation which gave it limbs. It walked onto the ground. The mutation spread to other of it's race, and then other species since it helped survival. After a few billion years rose the dinosaurs, and the first mammals. After the dinosaurs died, the mammals became the rules of the planet. One species of the mammal, mutated into two different species. One turned into apes, monkeys... and the other turned into humans. These creatures, called humans, had huge brains and big frontal lobes, which is where the sub-conscious resides, as well as thoughts and emotion.<br>  <br>  That was just abiogenesis and evolution in a compact package.|`|dc6066786e5b11910efa599e46ed3de2aa	Big bang to molecules and particles and electromagnetic radiation and then to planets. Surges of electricity in the air striking the right combinations of gases created the first microbe (I think) that was "living" (the theory was actually carried out in an experiment a long time ago, I read it in a textbook somewhere--I wish I remembered, it was fascinating), and then the microbes would grow and split and reproduce, and then ages later a few microbes consumed others or merged together and formed a cell, and then ages later the cells joined together a few at a time so you get multicellular organisms, but at the time very very small. Sometime near(ish) then, a cell of a sort mutated and cells and cells later eventually developed into mitochondria which has its oen DNA, and then I think another cell or few consumed or latched on to the mitochondria and became a simple organism that was reproducing and mutating meanwhile, and then it eventually turned into something simple like a bug or a fish--cells probably joined and changed around to form in larger organisms the organs that were like itself, meaning that the nucleus was probably reflected in the developing of the brain (as an organ). Simple fish and bugs via evolution eventually turned into larger animals who, like cells and bacteria, would live and reproduce instinctively. Creatures would stick around with others of their kind (they were born there and had no reason to stray), and it probably over a long time happened that as their brains developed better survival instincts, awareness like "whoa, theres a scary something there, better stay away" (not with words, just the concept) developed, and then from awareness came communication like growling equals stay away and intense staring means "back off or I'ma hurtcha", and then growls and grunts developed communication into whines when you're sad, and then funny noises became words. (The emotion meanwhile was probably mostly adrenaline-like bodily reactions that were induced by survival instinct like fear, and liking and love was fro good things like "ooh this is a pretty place, I can sleep here and eat this because it's safe!") THEN, when words began to have implications, that's when awareness and words started developing into meaning and thinking and that -really- pushed the brain into having more highly developed neuron transmissions and signals, and that's how it makes sense to me.|`|AA11264399	Evolution.

Greek philosophers explained the origin of life in terms of atoms combining and re-combining in an infinite number of forms for all eternity.  If an event is remotely improbable, it will nonetheless happen if you have an infinite timespan to spare.  Of course, the Big Bang theory suggests a finite time span for the Universe, so the hypotheses of the Greek Atomists would not work today.  Natural selection (which was worked out in the 19th Century) is not a chance phenomenon, so the evolution of complex living things becomes more probable, and could happen within the finite time span since the time of the Big Bang.<br>  <br>  I'm not an Atheist by the way.

You are God's mind.|`|AA12203324	It's simply the natural inclinations in the universe, and time.  Positive and negative charges have been attracted to each other since the beginning of electromagnetism, so certain atoms and ions are more attracted to certain other atoms and ions.  Atoms with extra electrons in their outer orbitals are more likely to cling to atoms with fewer outer electrons, so certain simple chemical compounds are more likely to result and persist.  NH3 is more stable than NH2 or NH4.  O2 is more stable than O or O3.<br>  <br>  These simple molecules react more strongly with certain other molecules.  Acids and bases react violently.  Semiconductive molecules react more subtly.  So there are varying probabilities for more complex molecular structures.  This continues at various levels of complexity.  Some structures are more likely to form and persist than others.  So increasingly complex reactions will form specific kinds of compounds, all depending on the valences of their atomic components.<br>  <br>  At some point, the compounds became complex enough to automatically transform energy between chemically stored and kinetic forms, or to duplicate themselves, ultimately combining into a system that we would call "life".  From that point, it is just a matter of increasing complexity.  Undifferentiated cells learned to specialize their functions and work symbiotically, increasing overall efficiency and operating organically, as a complex system.  Every genetic variation that produced a result that improved survival tended to survive.  Those that didn't, didn't.  Things got really interesting when organic life forms developed nerves to communicate information between distant parts of the body.  When nerves started cooperating their way into a control system, brains developed.  Increasing complexity ultimately led to perhaps the greatest survival advantages, self-awareness, memory and abstract thought.  With that, learning from past experience could be preserved artificially, and communicated to other members of the species.  Threats and opportunities could be evaluated, and complex plans could be made.  All this because electrons like to fill holes in orbital shells and because consequently, certain structures are more durable than others.|`|AA11297267	Ignoring the false assumptions you make about the big bang...<br>  <br>  It's the result of evolution by natural selection over about 3.6 billion years.<br>  That's how.<br>  With the process of mutations, evolution, and natural selection all being well-documented, and with us able to *see* how natural selection promotes changes in organisms that enhance survival (like antibiotic-resistant bacteria), why is it that you seem to think evolution is more "miraculous" than a magic all-knowing-forever-existing sky father, for which there's no evidence at all, waving his hand and making it all happen magically?<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|cNniG2L0aa	Jeez, Sparkie; I dunno.<br>  That must mean GODDIDIT, aye?<br>  <br>  I dunno what holds the clouds in the air, either.<br>  GOD musta DUNNIT too.<br>  <br>  I dunno how a computer or combustion engine works.<br>  GODDIDIT, yeah?<br>  <br>  Scientific method: Make observation; develop or modify a hypothesis to explain observation; make predictions based on hypothesis; perform experiments to test predictions; analyse results; if FAIL, go back and develop another hypothesis; if PASS, submit results to be repeatedly tested in peer review.<br>  <br>  Creation ‘science’ method: Assume conclusion; affirm conclusion.<br>  ~|`|KgYIYXEtaa	You've completely got me there.

jDY8KsvTaa	There is no "right" or "wrong" answer to this question.  It's a moral dilemma that can be used to measure your capacity for critical thinking.<br>  <br>  A possible answer:<br>  As humans are effectively herd animals, the same biological and sociological rules can be applied to us as to other animals with similar grouping tendencies.  Often, animals benefit from congregating in large groups for several reasons:<br>  1)  Predators/threats are deterred by the possibility of a united defense.<br>  2)  Predators/threats are more easily identified when multiple individuals are watching for them.<br>  3) The chances of being targeted by a predator/threat are minimized when there are other viable targets in the immediate area.<br>  <br>  Each of these points illustrates that the group exists to provide for the "Common Good".  In order to minimize the suffering of a large group, it is sometimes necessary for an individual to be sacrificed.  Moral questions regarding the well-being of the individual are fruitless in comparison to the need to survive and overcome potential threats to the well-being of the herd/society.|`|a8IslxsQaa	I'd say that's probably a good thing if you are in "the many", but not so good if you are "the one" - especially when that one person is sacrificed and not given a choice.<br>  <br>  In other words, it depends on the level of involvement of the person making the sacrifice.|`|rAXkpuzIaa	Yes|`|Qc6MqcpWaa	If it's for a test, then you need to answer it with your own thoughts.|`|AA11232725	It all depends upon the circumstances. What manner of suffering compared to what benefit for others. If a soldier dives on a grenade to save the other soldiers around him then most people would think that was worth it. If an innocent person had to plead guilty to a crime in order to protect others who were guilty  then most people would not consider that to be worth it.|`|AA11974194	It is not black and white.  For example, if one person smoked, no one else should have to breath that crap so he should be suffering nicontine cravingss rather than frack everyone's respiratory systems.

lDEGaK7Laa	My thinking is that it would put them off. Would you buy Native American art from a non-Native American person? It's sort of the same thing. People are going to see your art as a co-opting of their own religious/artistic capital.<br>  <br>  But, then again, I could be totally wrong. I think you should continue because even if Muslims won't by your art, maybe other non-Muslim people will think it's cool and interesting and buy it for themselves.

If the sense that you want to convey is tha you are wondering what it would take for him/she to do something, then you should say in Spanish:  Que debo hacer (yo) para lograr que tu hagas esto?  (I hope you see the difference.  In the first example, you are asking about things the person may need if he/she wants to do something.  In the second one, you are wondering and letting the person that you are wondering what the hell is it necessary for you to do in order to move him/her to behave in a particular way or do to something.  Get it?),<br>  <br>  "What's it going to take for you to wake up and smell the coffee?" should be "Que es lo que hace falta para que al levantarte sientas el aroma (olor) del cafe?".  As you may notice, I'm using the verb "sientas" instead of "huelas".  It is that in Spanish you are expected to kind of "feel" the smell of fresh coffee, even though it is actually "sensing" or "smelling" the smell of fresh coffee.  But that is the way it is said in Spanish.  If it is that it is that you want her/him to have the coffee ready for when you wake up, the it is the other way around:  Dime que es lo que tengo que hacer para cuando despierte sentir el olor del cafe".  (Tell me, what is what I'm supposed to do so that when I wake up, I fell the smell of fresh coffee?).  I hope I am of some help.  Maybe I wasn't. . . but. . . it was in good faith.  Good luck.

xxEhpytpaa	I really don't like to go face to face confession, and they really should offer privacy or face to face, but Confess in general, the priest doesn't want to hear the sorted details, unless they ask. Which they probably won't. However after you are done with all the sins you can remember, say, I am sorry for these sins and any sins I may have forgotten. Always include this for we as human forget what we did one minute to the next. When examining your conscience go through the 10 commandments and confess only what applies to you in them. Like I'm sure you didn't kill anybody so this would not apply, unless of course you did, then you would have to confess it. God bless you.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Just relax.   You are not going to 'surprise him' with anything. Believe me, the priest has heard it all, and more than likely heard far worse that what you are going to tell him.<br>  <br>  You don't have to look right at him either.  Just look off to the side or down if that helps calm you down.  And if you forget to mention something that you meant to say because you were nervous, it's okay.  It doesn't mean you aren't forgiven.<br>  <br>  Just make an effort to talk about the things that are bothering your the most though.  It will make you feel a heck of a lot better when you leave the confessional...I know from experience.|`|93galWG1aa	Remember the priest has heard it all before and much worse.<br>  Remember it is Christ working through the priest.<br>  Remember the only way to get forgiveness is to repent.<br>  Remember that Jesus died for you and through his sacrament you are cleansed and made whole.<br>  Remember it is vanity and pride that makes you hold back both traits of the devil.<br>  Remember Christ left you his peace and repeatedly said do not fear.<br>  Remember you offend Christ when you do not trust him.<br>  Remember your place is in heaven and to get there you most be purified from sin.<br>  Remember his great love for you.<br>  Remember that you give glory to God when you ask him for mercy and forgiveness.<br>  Remember he is your Father and wants to heal you.<br>  Now what is there to fear? Go to the priest and thank God he has given you an opportunity to humble yourself before men.<br>  God bless.|`|bsHkZH1kaa	Did you do anything bad that is wrong and the ten commandments said not to do?  You should not be scared, you are going to your spiritual father and also your real father is speaking through him.  I go face to face every time and sometimes i'm nervous, but since the parish priest I go to is almost my boss; so to speak; I went from altar boy for him to working on entering the priesthood through him.  <br>  <br>  Do not be afraid, he won't do anything bad; unless you confess about having a abortion then he will tell the bishop.  But do not be afraid, he will not yell at you; it's kind of being face to face with Christ; just remember he loves you and won't reject you.|`|JDxpjT34aa	I understand your fear. I know that priests have heard it all and nothing is going to surprise them but I still just can't bring myself to do a face to face confession. I'm a big fan of the partition. Dave RC has a great idea about going to confession on Saturday so that you'll have much less to confess when you go face to face. If you don't have a chance to do that then the priest will understand if you are nervous. Taking a list is a good idea too. Just keep in mind how much better you will feel after you have confessed your sins. It always feel like a heavy weight has been taken off my shoulders.|`|rytl3lYiaa	basically when i used to go to confession i just thought about the things i felt bad about, such as mean to family members or not helping around the house etc basically things you want to apologise for. if it helps you could also ask what some of the people at your school are thinking of confessing to see if it matches up in your opinion.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Don't worry about it, you can close your eyes if you have to. You can also tell him you are uncomfortable with the face to face. Tell him you are embarrassed. In our Church, the priest will give reconciliation either way. Pax Christi|`|LKRXCFuWaa	Many people have made good point here, and I'd like to add one more:<br>  <br>  Going to confession and honestly speaking to the priest will never offend him. On the contrary, he will feel very happy and be grateful to you for sharing with him and allowing him to share in the celebration of the sacrament of reconciliation. Most priests I know are humbled and filled with joy when someone comes and allows God to heal them through their presence. <br>  <br>  Reconciliation is a tremendous grace, and is a shared experience, making it all the more powerful. :)|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	Tell the priest you are scared.  You can even make an  appointment outside of the confessional to see the priest and discuss confession. If you are still afraid you will chicken out, write down a list.  If you do chicken out during the confession, hand him the list.  <br>  <br>  Finally, I look forward to confession.  Scripture shows there is much rejoicing when a sinner repents.  Jesus likes to win victories over sin.  Think of confession (really, reconciliation) as a simple day surgery where a very nasty cancer is removed, then you can go out and have ice cream.  I always feel great and clean after a good confession.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats on your decision to come back to Confession!|`|HMteUyRdaa	Don't go face to face, you should have the option to go anonymously or face to face. I have only been to confession one time where it was face to face and I didn't feel right about it at all. I like going anonymously because I find it easier to remember I am talking to Christ and also the embarrassment of my sin is not something I deal with in confession, it is just me and my God. I am sorry you don't have the option. If you do then go anonymously. If not then maybe it would be easier to confess with your eyes trained on the floor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Love<br>  Kate<br>  <br>  pray the Rsoary|`|FjiRPKp2aa	I would start with one or two that most concern you and go from there. Oh do not forget to make a little card to help remind you of the prayer. I went in for reconciliation once and that was the first thing he asked for and I was tired I could not remember it for the life of me.The priest will guide you.It will be ok.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	If I will make it easier for you, you might wish to receive reconciliation this Saturday, behind a screen.  Then you'll have less to confess when you go to confession with your class (if it's next week, and not tomorrow).<br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave<br>  <br>  Edit: Before you confess, you might also wish to tell the priest your concern, and ask that he not yell at you.  You can also write your sins on a piece of paper, and read them to the priest when at confession.<br>  <br>  You might also wish to pray the devotion to the Seven Sorrows of Mary, and ask her for the grace to make a good confession.  See the promise #4 below:<br>  <br>  The Seven Sorrows of Mary are as follow:<br>  <br>  1. The Prophecy of Simeon<br>  2. The Flight into Egypt<br>  3. The Loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple<br>  4. Mary Meets Jesus as He Carries His Cross<br>  5. The Crucifixion and Death of Jesus<br>  6. The Body of Jesus is Taken Down from the Cross and Placed into Mary's Arms<br>  7. Jesus is Placed in the Tomb.<br>  <br>  Mary wishes for us to pray one Hail Mary while meditating on each of the Seven Sorrows, for a total of seven Hail Marys. She has made the following promises to those who do this on a daily basis:<br>  <br>  1. I will grant peace to their families.<br>  2.They will be enlightened about the Divine mysteries.<br>  3. I will console them in their pains and I will accompany them in their work.<br>  4. I will give them as much as they ask for as long as it does not oppose the adorable will of my Divine Son or the sanctification of their souls.<br>  5. I will defend them in their spiritual battles with the infernal enemy and I will protect them at every instant of their lives.<br>  6. I will visibly help them at the moment of their death, they will see the face of their Mother.<br>  7. I have obtained this Grace from my Divine Son, that those who propagate this devotion to my tears and dolors, will be taken directly from this earthly life to eternal happiness since all their sins will be forgiven and my Son and I will be their eternal consolation and joy.|`|4dVOE371aa	Don`t be afraid I`m shure you are going to do a wonderful reconciliation, we are all sinners, and nothing is new to God he`s waiting for you so don`t let him down. remember that  you are receiving a Sacrament and Sacraments help us find the way to Christ, your heart will be pure and you are going to feel happy about it. Bless you.|`|G8CLx1vgaa	Why don't you just not go in school and go to church instead?|`|ptSifCIqaa	I felt the same way my first time back After 17 years! The feeling after wards was so healing. Don't be scared! The priest is their to guide you. Their is nothing they haven't heard! If you are sensitive let them know, let them know it has been awhile since your last confession. Confess that you are scared. It's ok, it's completely natural and part of our human nature. Have courage and be not afraid!|`|4FWKG8KOaa	Don`t be scared Reconciliation is one of the Sacraments that cleans our soul of sin, the other one is Christening, that makes us  members of the body of Christ it`s a gift from God, no other Church gives us the opportunity to talk with Jesùs and ask him for forgiveness, the love of God cleans us of every sin, if you forget in your confesion of any of them it is forgiven all the same.Bless you.|`|RGiS7zcLaa	Why don't you go to confession outside of school, then you can go behind the screen.  Then when you go during school you won't have so much to confess.  They should let you go behind the screen anyway though.

AA12187979	Well, last time I checked nobody made up the words.<br>  <br>  So the bible is a true collection of stories, I believe that to be a truth.  Now if a human takes one of those stories and tries to inter pert a fossil record or substitute it for a cure for rabies.  They could find themselves being a bit week for the gene pool.  But that is not the books fault.  That is a human idiot at work.  <br>  <br>  Likewise if some takes one of those story and proves it's a fable, that doesn't change or diminish the meaning of the story.  That is not the books fault, that is a human idiot at work.|`|ae42c685a1c84f56bdffcb7bf2dc5965aa	Yes, it is real.<br>  Read the old original King James Version from 1611, the language is clearer and has it's true meaning from the Greek and Hebrew language.<br>  This is the best and most accurate to the original languages.|`|AA10181489	You should read "Misquoting Jesus," written by a translator, Bart Ehrmann.

Doesn't mean the whole thing is.|`|7oCpSkmxaa	There have actually been a bunch of things written in the Bible that were written ages ago, and in the past few hundred years, archeologists have found proof was real.  <br>  <br>  The most common is the cities, and lifestyles of people living there, and such.  The Bible talks about ancient cities, where they were, what life was like there in their heyday, and who rulers were.  When archeologists went to where the Bible said these cities were, and started digging, they found the ruins, and in many cases found writings - non-biblical writings - that backed up what was written in the Bible.<br>  <br>  One thing I thought was really cool - In the Bible, in genesis 11 it talks about the tower of babel being built, and God being upset about this, so he confused the languages of the people so that they could not communicate and had to scatter.  Cuneform tablets were actually found that told the story of the tower being built and "the gods" being angry and confusing the language.  And these tablets dated to the same time that the Bible says that this happened.<br>  <br>  There's some scientific things in there too - I mean, the Bible is not a book of science at all, but when it touches on it, it's correct.  For example - the Bible indentified rabbits as cud chewers thousands of years ago.  Biologists "discovered" that rabbits chew cud, like 150 years ago.  There was a time when the smartest people on earth thought the planet was flat - the Bible always called it a sphere (or circle, depending on what translation you have)<br>  <br>  The original greek scriptures said Christ was nailed not to a cross as many believe, but the greek word used meant simply a stake, like a pole or tree trunk.  It's recently been discovered that at the time of Christ's death, the "torture stake" didn't have a crossbeam.  The crossbeam was a modification that was added a few hundred years later.  (Can you imagine if that little piece of information was released mainstream?  So many religions would be like, OK what do we do with these crosses?)<br>  <br>  I could go on and on.  There are SO MANY things that were written in the Bible thousands of years ago that are proving to be true now, when for generations people challenged them.  I love researching this stuff, I am fascinated by what I find.  When people say that the Bible isn't real, I have to laugh inside.  It's like, "Dude, you based that statement on your personal thoughts, you didn't do any research to verify one way or the other, because if you did, you wouldn't have come to that conclusion."|`|hQDapmICaa	Anyone who approaches the Bible with an wicked mind, will never find the truth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Isa 29:10  For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. <br>  <br>  Isa 29:11  And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: <br>  <br>  Isa 29:12  And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. <br>  <br>  <br>  HalleluYAH!|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Depends on who you ask.

I doubt that Lewis actually believed that people from hell picnic in heaven, it was a literary device to advance the plot.<br>  <br>  When they get there, they meet people from heaven who offer them entrance to heaven, but from the reaction of each of the damned, Lewis reveals what it was that took them to hell in the first place, and usually it had its origin in something minor that the person never dealt with in their life.  Again, it appears to be a literary device for advancing the plot.<br>  <br>  If you study the doctrine of purgatory, it is a place in which a person who is not damned pays for any unrepented sins before they enter heaven.  But in the Great Divorce, the visitors are damned, and none of them are capable of repenting or being forgiven.  None of them enter heaven.  So Lewis is presenting something very different then the idea of purgatory in the Great Divorce.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	C.S. Lewis is not the Bible.

Believing in one religion (eg, Wicca) doesn't mean you have to completely negate belief in aspects of another, but if you want to participate in a religion, one or the other may force you to choose between them.  I've practiced a form of Hinduism (reformed Advaita Vedanta) for at least 30 years now--but it doesn't mean that I am not sympathetic to the beliefs of Christianity, Buddhism, or modern paganism. In fact, I've practiced as a Christian and Hindu simultatenously. I also was being mentored to be a Buddhist lama while continuing to practice Hinduism. I've studied with Jains and Sikhs and yogis as well. I currently study western occultism, folkcraft, and Wicca but I still consider myself a Vedantist. In the end, they are all different ways of understanding and expressing the same truth.

Your thoughts mold you into what you are and these will lead you to where you will be going.<br>  <br>  So, the answer to the question is it is up to you.|`|OugNf0x6aa	I hate copy paste questions.

R49w1Dr7aa	Now isn't the time for a book. the most important thing for you to do is just be there. the closer the grief the fewer the words. Just let her talk and you listen unless of course she asks you a question. Tell her that she will get thru this and that you will be there to support her.<br>  <br>  My neighbors husband was badly burned and when he went to the hospital I went over to sit with her. (She was ill and too frightened to go)All I did was sit with her and tell her that they would get thru this. that's all I did and yet for weeks and weeks after that she couldn't stop thanking me.<br>  <br>  Your presence will mean so much to her and she is fortunate to have you for a friend.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	I am sorry for her and for you as you must watch your friend suffer through this. I would say just be available to help her cry by listening and being by her side when she is lonely.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	read her a bible|`|AA11139575	I am sorry for your friend's loss. <br>  <br>  I recommend your getting the brochure called, When Someone You Love Dies. It is published by Jehovah's Witnesses. You may obtain it by asking one of Jehovah's Witnesses for it when they visit you, or you can call or visit the local Kingdom Hall in your area to get one. I do encourage you both to read it together. It will discuss the grieving process, how to live with your grief; how others can help and, most importantly, it discusses the wonderful hope the Bible holds out for dead loved ones.<br>  <br>  What to do:<br>  An important thing you can do is simply listen to her and let her know you don't mind her talking about her feelings. Make sure she knows you don't mind her talking about her husband. <br>  <br>  Be available-make sure she doesn't just sit around the house thinking about this situation. When certain dates come up that may cause pain, plan to be there for her to provide support. <br>  <br>  Take appropriate initiative: running errands, fixing things around the house, fixing meals and other such things.<br>  <br>  Pray with and for her. Hearing your heartfelt prayers on her behalf will assure her that God cares for her and will help her through this difficult time.<br>  <br>  Speak to her about the Bible's wonderful hope of the resurrection. I have found much comfort myself from reading the many accounts from the Bible of people being resurrected. The account of Lazarus will be especially helpful. It is found at John 11:1-44. Your friend will gain much comfort from verse 1, which states that death is likened to sleep. See also Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 which shows that the dead feel, know nothing. <br>  <br>   In time, your friend will feel better.|`|qpjorXRnaa	First, pray for her, God hears everything, second be there for her, listen to her, and comfort her. And last, let her remember that all things work together for good to them which love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Rom 8:18- For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us.<br>  <br>  GOD IS GOOD!!!|`|zQyslfHKaa	All you can do is be there when she needs you to listen.  People are all different when it comes to grieving and one of the worst things we unknowingly do to one another is assume that the person is in some 'stage' of loss, instead of just listening.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for her loss.
v4qLlGGhaa	They hate all women. They don't deserve to have women in the first place.<br>  <br>  Men are inferior, they can't give birth. I can't give birth either but I don't hate men. They need a wake up call from GOD.|`|DQFCtGSJaa	They are allowed to. but a woman ALWAYS reaches out her hand before the man. if she does, that means that its OK to shake her hand. if not, then dont. (its rude and insulting if you do)|`|Pjcc0Yexaa	correction.. they dont hate all women<br>  they just find women to be inferior to men.|`|urbo9yUqaa	Their culture and religion is strict.
NqfUPKiSaa	Mantras are mental recitation, sending vibrating energy during prayer or meditation. <br>  Bhajans are group singing- cosmic chants to bring concentration of mind & one pointed thought|`|nhGIZE71aa	A mantra is a line chanted that is usually fairly short and has a packed meaning.  Usually, an important component of the mantra is the effect of the sound itself, not just the language-based meaning.  It is meant to put one's mind into a certain state of consciousness through its repetition.<br>  <br>  A bhajan is a devotional song, usually meant to evoke devotion and love for the object of the song; a deity, for example.|`|AA11220299	I don't know but I know mantras and contemporary music in the church are the same thing.|`|hzMpdFFBaa	A mantra is a mystical sound or very short prayer (sometimes simply a mystical sound and the name of deity.) It is mentally or verbally recited over and over again to 1) help steady and concentrate the mind as a form on meditation 2) as a contemplation of the idea or deity of the mantra. 3)as a form of devotion to a deity.<br>  <br>  A bhajan is a devotional song or a gathering in which devotional songs are sung.|`|gB86RtjIaa	No.  Bhajans are songs with several verses.  Whereas Mantras and short phrases that are repeated over and over again.|`|oz1UeJHYaa	Yes, For the most part they are the same thing<br>  <br>  Bajans u basically pray sor someone or something<br>  <br>  and Mantras u can also pray for something or someone!!<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps =)
6Whz1p5Eaa	I spose, so long as you'll also accept a happy Easter card in a good natured manner|`|bgA9wLD0aa	i wanted to send lupercalia cards to all of my loved ones by feb. 14th, but i couldn't find any in the stores.  where did you find ostara cards???<br>  <br>  and please don't tell me to make them.  i'm a pagan, not a witch.  witches craft, pagans purchase.|`|5AaV7koHaa	Yes, I think it would pleasure them very much. It is always nice to get a card from a friend, no matter what they believe or don't believe.There is a certain "Fundie" ( a former ordained minister) in Mississippi that has been getting cards from me way before he went to jail.I send cards to him now and then, even though they tell me: "The man's Parole Officer hasn't be born yet." And I do not mean "born again".He'll be in his 90s when he is eligible for Parole. ?I often think about Frank Burns and Hawk-eye from M.A.S.H. when I know the right Reverend is in the "Clinck" and all us sinners are out in the "free world".Awww! Too bad, sooo sad.(note the sarcasm).|`|ExCAedp4aa	That sounds fun, way nicer than what I usually send: dog droppings in a manila envelope. Ah, but I guess you catch more flies with honey, don't you?|`|paRGbr7Xaa	I think it would be very nice.|`|gDksphD0aa	go for it.you know you can post date it don't you.

The mind works in such a peculiar state in circumstances like these -ie. questioning life. To find our answers we need to look at the physical properties of a hyperbolic paraboloid. In this we find nothing but specs of cheese and onion.  Oh wait that's my lost pringle from earlier :)  Score.|`|ybt605Qfaa	If you look at how the universe is likely to continue forever, it would be impossible for you to not eventually be born as everything when you are born again.|`|JlEucUVtaa	The clear answer would be yes! There is no doubt in my mind that this will happen exactly in the way you have described!|`|94PHAJw9aa	What's that, I didn't hear you?  Shut the **** up!  Come on a little louder  Shut the **** up!  Everybody N 2 Gether now  Shut the **** up!  What?  Shut the **** up!  Huh?   Shut the **** up!|`|u0160kdXaa	No. You will be a tapeworm inside a mangy dog.    Or is it a cockroach?

Good luck with the wig.|`|tZOdTblkaa	yes|`|LRvaTQ9Yaa	if you are will you make friends with god and then ask him to make it rain chocolate for a day
4c7UlVpPaa	Yes I think it is too much. Everything that has to do with being religious cost to much. Does every catholic church really need $200,000.00 worth of stained glass?     Just because he is religious does not give him the right to always ask for money and its the same thing as the lazy cousin that doesn't have a job and lives with his parents.    If he is going to do ask for money every year, tell him to setup a bank account that accepts anonymous donations. It is embarrassing to those being asked for money when being asked send a check to that person.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	You shouldn't feel pressured to give.  If you don't want to give to him, don't - it's that simple :)|`|dDMOJWxwaa	What sponsored trip in the Army (Flags going up)?|`|wZEGi1EHaa	Hey, I'm taking a little trip, and I'd like some sponsors too.  All donations would be very, very much appreciated.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Your question isn't really clear, what kind of trip is this? Mission trip?    I think that if you cannot or don't want to donate, don't. Really it is up to you. Every year I raise funds for charity, if that was what he is doing would you feel differently because he isn't going on a trip...or would you equate it to the same thing. When people raise funds for mission trips or charities they are usually trying hard to fulfill something inside that says they are helping out others. Sounds like that is all he wants to do (assuming that this is a mission trip).|`|tdNaZ9qAaa	Tell him to become a Jehovahs wittness instead , each congregation works locally so he doesnt have to take expensive trips :)    And how is it that he is a christian and works for the army? What would jesus think of that little factoid?|`|AA12194228	I think he is emotionally extorting his family and friends.|`|URO3gDXcaa	and?|`|ttTDiJWfaa	I told you religious people ask for money a lot!|`|5tMCDu8gaa	How old is he now? 23? Maybe 24? And he's still sending you letters begging for money so he can go on his god-walk?    I wouldn't - tell him to work for it like everyone else. He's an adult now, time to act like one.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	What is the trip for?  If you agree with what he's doing on the trip (i.e. service to some group of people?) then that's your deciding factor.  If he's just looking for a vacation, I'd say it's time he self-sponsored!    God bless you.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Don't feel pressured into sending money. If his only communication in the last two years has been letters asking for money, I would not feel guilty about not sending money. It isn't your job to fund his life.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	If you give money once, they are going to think you'll be happy to give again...if you don't want to donate, simply tell him no and offer no explanations...he won't ask for any unless he's strapped for cash for some other reason...|`|AA12203324	It is a little odd, but you should do what you feel.  In the current economy, you have plenty of excuse not to contribute to his fundraiser.  The commencement ride is over.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	It is not uncommon to ask for sponsors to offset the cost of these trips.   Those who feel moved to sponsor such things have the opportunity to with these letters. Those who do not feel moved to sponsor are not required to.  You stated he was very religious. If you do not feel comfortable donating money, then mail him a letter of support containing prayers.   A friend of mine gets quite a few letters like this. He mails them a journal so they may write of their journeys. He encourages his religious friends to write in their journals. Just a thought...|`|u6Wyxmuvaa	I don't believe in anything. For all I know, you're lying.|`|vlt8KoXRaa	tell him to go and **** himself, he is taking advantage of your good nature like all religious cults cut him out of your life, plant drugs on him or plant something incriminating on him to make your sister brake up with him hope this helps!|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	He seems to think that his family and friends should finance his life. Is a second donation a bit much? I think the FIRST donation was a bit much. Graduation presents usually come from parents if anyone. Usually people don't go around hitting up their friends and relatives to pay for their hobbies. If everyone keeps going along with this, he's going to keep mooching off the family for the rest of his life. Why shouldn't he when it works so well?|`|AA11328507	asking doesn't mean give|`|cLcQKGu3aa	Something is wrong with this picture.  A stranger sending a letter I can understand.  But a brother in law?  Come on!  He can't get on the phone or face you when he wants to bum money.    It sounds like he has some guilt about the question to begin with.  The first thing I would wonder is how he is really using the money and how necessary this trip is.|`|sGojEWOxaa	I think that if he going on some type of mission trip, that it should be paid for either by his church, or by himself. It is not your responsibility.  You could donate something if you'd like, but you shouldn't feel obligated.
2504f97ffac185e7967a871c085d92a0aa	I have had a smiling problem since I was 15, and I've always been hassled for it. Today some people called me 'smiley'. Smiling is my instinct whenever I meet strangers, and during awkward moments its a nervous smile and laugh. People always comment on my smiling, which I find unusual. Perhaps not many people smile out there usually, so they find my smiling unusual, or maybe they like it?|`|euClIlBfaa	I also get told the same thing...Whenever, someone asks me why I'm always smiling I just tell that I'm a happy person and that life is good.  <br>  There's nothing wrong with smiling

5E5gL9fVaa	"Are you lying to me" is the most difficult question to answer with a lie.|`|EZ1cPPvkaa	That question is almost always asked in desperation, more of a way to say "I think you're lying to me".  No, a person who is lying is not likely to answer that question truthfully, but the way they answer it can often give insight into whether or not they're telling the truth.|`|AA11234020	well when i ask someone that question that is last straw ..cause the person on the opposite side knows that i know that he/she is lying and its the last opportunity to come clean..and if the person says no i am not thn you gotta work with the info infront of u and any prior history|`|I9L0FUogaa	If someone tells you they're a pathological liar, would you believe them?|`|KJZol6Gpaa	To insult them.  It is another way of saying, "I don't trust you."|`|Bx7F9jscaa	If you do it to a person enough when he or she is young, they are more likely to break and tell the truth at that point, and probably more likely to tell the truth in the future.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	Because sometimes you can tell if they are lying by the way they react.|`|60484e1a567d1571767f63b8cb41172baa	I guess the same as asking, "Honest to God, is that the truth?"  A liar certainly is not going to admit to lying.  But, watch the way their head tilts.  Supposedly, if it tilts to the right when they answer you, they're telling the truth.  If they hesitate and it tilts to the left, they're lying.  Just something I read in YA once.  And so I questioned, but what if you're left-handed, do you reverse it?|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	This appeals to thier conscience. People can lie, and not really realise that they are lying. So if you say. "Are you lying?" You look into thier eyes, and see that they can't look you in the eye.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	You can tell by their reaction if they thought you've caught them out. Duhr.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	To see their reaction.It's the reaction that will give them in.
jgpYS0oEaa	I'm Asian, I use to seem to only like black guys...but recently I found this Indian guy from Heroes extremely good looking...so I guess I'm just into the guys with darker features. Anyways, about black guys...what do I like? The skin color...brown...it makes a guy look more built if he has muscles, I don't know why. They tend to look more masculine...have stronger features not so "soft"...I also like how most can pull off full lips. My bf is black, I didn't like him before cuz he was my friend and I didn't date him based off of his skin color though, funny huh? haha    I guess also more in common like the music I like, most black men listen to. Styles and whatever...    I also love curly hair, the poofy ones hahah, not so much an AFRO but curly hair on anyone.|`|R2sgWuqUaa	They smile a lot!!!|`|W6mRRCVNaa	questions like these are very ignorant. who cares.|`|uii7iBn4aa	because   they are strong,  unexpectedly cute,  generous to women,  have nice voice ^_^|`|hHjPFxEdaa	I like men, race is incidental. Black men can be very sexy and fun to be with but so can guys of other races. Right now the man I've got my eye on is Black but the reasons I like him have nothing to do with race, except maybe his fine looks.|`|nANyAvzgaa	I like their beautiful eyes. their voices, the way they move, and in some cases the most important in ALL men - their intelligence   - definitely not their *****!!  So, duh!|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	I do think some are curious but most just find them attractive they just happen to be black.

We can leave that to the Latin men.|`|faIaIvDiaa	the only thing i'm impressed with black men are the fact that they are able to stand up for themselves, unlike some other race. but their dirty, lazy and violent habits need to change.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	well im black but i will answer the question    curiosity  to be 'cool'  to rebel and make daddy angry  for a talking point with girlfriends  phase  oh yeah the d1ck thing      for non blacks that just happen to be with a black man then they could also just happen to really like them but that wasnt the question|`|aaRMPDIDaa	I think many black men are very good looking.  And they don't show age as much as white people do (my opinion).|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	I have 2 cousins that date black men...I honestly think that they just like the drama and something always going on 24/7...they are always involved in some kind of drama with those guys and their baby mamas, lol. They also act ghetto...so obviously no white guys want anything to do with them.

God can't give you every little thing you want and desire. it is easy to say how could a god do such things but look what humans have done people bring on there own problems if it weren't for people there wouldn't be war. God created us to be for him and live in love and happiness, but he also gave us a choice to do so, and look what peoples choices brought us to. Don't think he has stopped caring think if people have stopped caring, and i am not a downer on all people there are some good people you just have to be looking for them.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	It was easier when there were only a few million of us running around the planet.    But humans breed like rabbits and there are now billions and billions of us everywhere. God just shrugged his shoulders and gave up. Too many to be bothered with.    A bit like if you have a couple of pet mice, and then in a year's time, find you are now housing 50 of the little pests. You just don't have as much affection to spread around and want to get rid of a few.|`|s2GCKeouaa	They didn't.|`|mG6Pu12Paa	Because we choose not to see Him.  God has never stopped caring about us, we are the ones that turned our backs to him.  Since Jesus was crucified you are suppose to believe with your heart not with your eyes.  Remember doubting Thomas?  God has given us three chances to obey his will and we have chosen not to. (As the race of Humans.)  The Garden of Eden, Noah and the Great Flood and Jesus.  We as a race refuse him but he is still there waiting to greet us at the gates of Heaven.|`|uvKU4ol3aa	When people started to sin and rebel against God. You got it backwards. It's us who didn't want God intervening in our affairs. We rejected him a long time ago.    Also, everything was accomplished at the cross. There is no more left for him to do. We have salvation, we don't need anything else.|`|yzc2aWjsaa	*shrug* only God knows. He might be waiting for something to happen, like he does, and then will do something amazing. Miracles happen every day to everyday people...just because something big isn't happening, doesn't mean he doesn't care. Besides, what about all the other people in the world that weren't mentioned during Biblical times? I'm sure they have their own stories and dealings with God.|`|MYkIxRioaa	This was one of the considerations I went through that eventually made me an atheist from being a Roman Catholic.    The fact is, I don't believe that God is universally defined in the Bible. In the Old Testament, he's a vengeful, or perhaps righteous and outspoken being. In the New Testament he's changed drastically. No more murdering people, no more "an eye for an eye." In the NT he's a forgiving, generous being.    For me, this brings into question the validity of such claims. For if God is perfect, then there is no scope for change, because a perfect being would not need to change. To see such a drastic change in the behaviour of God could have been caused by the attitude of society at those times. In the Old Testament, perhaps people believed that such a powerful being could only act in ways that provoked fear, whereas the general idea of a supreme being changed by the New Testament into a forgiving, less involved being.    The only rational answer I can consider is that God didn't act in the Tower of Babel or Noah's Ark incidents, and that they were perhaps acts of nature only percieved as having been caused by a supreme power. In the specific example of the Tower of Babel, perhaps it was a fable predating Old Testament society and evolved to include God. A sort of mythological tale, if you will, similar to how Norse believers told about how the weather and the seasons came about.    Either that, or, in a more religious vein, the argument for free will could be played. Perhaps God decided that interfering only caused trouble and strife, things He didn't want. Perhaps he concluded that by acting he proved himself to exist, and that not acting meant that those who believed in Him have complete faith. Perhaps that is what He wants, to see who has complete faith in Him by remaining simply an observer. Those who continue to believe in spite of evil and terror have the kind of faith that is rewarded.|`|2bfbda31517a40fd64c290f16464ec40aa	I wouldn't say that he doesn't care.   It is kinda like parenting.  You tell your child so many times don't touch.  You do things to prevent them and teach them not to touch.  They still want to touch and don't realize the cost of getting burnt if they do touch.  They don't want to listen and you get tired of talking and putting out the effort to stop them from getting burnt.   You finally realize the best way for them to learn is to touch and to get burnt to learn the consquences of their actions and for not listening.   God is still there and listening.  He told us that things would be like the days of Noah , and we would be sinners and unruly and want your way over God's way.   God is getting tired of talking and arguing with man and He is going to let us have what we want and he is going to let us learn from our mistakes.  He will show that he is still there through all of it.  God predicted the end of times for man on earth.  He warned those who believed to be prepared to leave and those that didn't believe he would let them have what they wanted, which wasn't God.(book of Revelation) Just like a parent, he will show that we were wrong and we will reap the consequences of our ways and He will show that he was right in the first place.  Actions speak louder than words and I think God is getting tired of talking, and I would be worried about the actions that could befall man for not wanting to listen and getting ourselves burnt.   God will show that He is right and true and that we should've listened before it was took late. He is not intervening in human affairs because we are not listening to hear him.  He is there, He will never leave us, but He will stand back and watch and see if we are willing to listen yet.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	he was never there to begin with.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Because he came down here, taught us what we need to know, then left behind a Church, sent his Holy Spirit, and pretty much left it up to us now.  Why, do you need a baby sitter?|`|QsCPOHAraa	That's a very good question. Yes, indeed. Where is God? Where oh where? I don't see him anywhere. Probably because he's not there, nor was he ever, and all those things he supposedly did in the past are just stories.|`|WUjlEuTtaa	He didn't, He brought a new covenant...

In the garden of Eden Satan challenged,that God was keeping something good from humankind,that they would be better off without him.Geneses 3:1-4    This was not just a challenge with the 2 people as onlookers but God had created myriads of Angels in the heavens also.  Revelation 5:11  If a family had a loving father and one of their sons turned against him and lied on him,it would take time for him to prove otherwise.  And for the rest of his children to testify  to the fact he was a good father.  That is what we see in this case;  Why not just kill Satan,destroy Adam and Eve and start all over?The question would not have been solved.  If I had a race horse and you had a race horse,I said mine is best ,you said yours is best,but in the middle of the night I came and shot your horse,no one would know whose was the best.Because nothing had been proven.    All through the history of the Bible there have been ones who have kept their integrity,Stayed on the true God's side.Job proved his integrity,Job 2:3 James 5:11    Proverbs 27:11 Jesus proved his integrity until  death,and that is the issue that we face to this day.  The issue of who is ruler over the heavens and the earth.  God turned the rulership over to Satan for a little while.Luke 4 5:8 John 14:30  Revelation 12:12 Psalm 37:9,10    Very soon we will see Jesus stand up.  Daniel 12:1 Daniel 2:44 Then there will be great distress upon the earth.Matthew 24:21  Man has been given all this time to prove that he can rule the world,so far every type of Government has failed.  Socializm,Communizm.Democracys Etc.  Isaiah 2:2-4 Micah 4:4  He has neither forgotten us or forgotten his purpose for the earth in Eden he planned a paradise and soon that is what it will be.  Isaiah 55:10,11 Titus 1,2    Revelation 21:3,4 Look the tent of God is with mankind and he will reside with him and they will be his people.  And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes and death wil be no more,neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore,the former things have passed away.

One answer I came up with was: perhaps God stopped intervening at about the same time he stopped talking to people so clearly they could quote him verbatim.  Seems like he has withdrawn from us through the Biblical period; so that today anyone who claims that God said such and such to them would be thought crazy.    Sometime later the penny dropped.  God hasn't changed, but our metaphysics have and the Bible, unintentionally, charts part of the progression.  Away from a God who really did speak, intervene, kill one lot of people and miraculously deliver another, to a much more mysterious and elusive conception.  I believe that God sustains everything that exists in the universe, but that he is not an entity within it; which means among other things that we are completely free to do what we choose with the lives we have been given, and also that stuff happens - not just wars, which are clearly human acts - but also in nature, from mass epidemics to disasters like the 2006 tsunami.    Does he not then "care"?  To give an unqualified yes would again imply intervention; which has become incredible.  If he cares but doesn't intervene, it don't mean a thing.  So he cares indirectly, through people who do his work: which could include medical researchers, charity workers, peace campaigners, politicians, pastors, and a whole host of ordinary "good neighbors".|`|TsE5XhXoaa	g|`|zWj6HXHNaa	You assume there was a god, and that cared in the first place.

They then rape a city of 35 000 people......nice<br>  <br>  If this God of the bible did exist he is certainly a God I would not worship, rather despise.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh and the story of Job. Briefly....Job worships God and satan says to God that he only worship because he's been good to Job. In an attempt to prove satan wrong God allows satan to do his worst to Job. Job then loses his home, family is killed, becomes ill and loses everything. God wins! Job still worships God. In turn he is rewarded with more riches and family. But still he lost his family before and therefore would still suffer, not to mention his kids never got a full life. So is it ok to kill them all in order to prove satan wrong? Why is God so Vain?

So something is statistically more probable than nothing. I'm not talking about this universe but the multitude of other possible universes and what lays beyond them. Matter and energy do not have to take the form we are familiar with, you could have any amount of exotic phenomena in an unlimited number of universes all governed by their own physical laws.   And anyway nothingness does no exist in this universe, even the deepest most remote parts of space are permeated by vacuum energy and virtual particles are popping in and out of existence. And another thing is if outside this universe time does not exist cause and effect have no meaning, therefore the effect could come before any cause, if a cause is needed at all.|`|tW86bOMNaa	Ultimately, the 'gobs of matter' came from energy; rather a lot of energy released (balanced positive and negative) at the point of the big bang.    Famously, Einstein showed the identity between energy and matter (the E=mc^2 equation) and that the two can be interchanged. With a lot of energy, a lot of mass can be produced.    Initially, the first element was the simplest: hydrogen. It's still the case that this element is overwhelmingly the most common. But smash hydrogen together in exploding stars and you get increasingly complex atoms - and over a few billion years, you get the collection, distribution and variety of matter that we see around us.    Oh, and it collects into gobs because gravitation is an attractive force unlike, say, magnetism which is both an attractive and a repellent force. At the large scale, it is gravity that applies and works to collect the scattered mass together.|`|FhHklqkhaa	the materials for the stuff in your room probably came from a factory or nature  matter is a different explanation   jeff S have answered validly|`|Ve18FAnGaa	why is everyone asking this question to us today?  and please don't ask a question about the nilly nally of your god to atheists, its just a bad idea ("...as God is outside of time and space, yes?"). now moving on...    most of us do not profess to know or care where it came from (as you will probably be noticing).  there is no doctrine of beliefs for atheists so you may get different speculations on origins, but an atheist is merely someone who does not believe in a god for what ever reason.  usually that involves us feeling we have sufficiently reasoned that one does not exist and that we should move on to other things.  there isn't anything that appears to most of us as hard evidence (including existence itself) in support of a god so we have faithfully decided to believe there is not one.|`|rU3pioImaa	Start with a big bang, instant matter and heat,rapid inflation.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

45Mmu3SFaa	Picking apart the word of God to suit your lifestyle....|`|ctOge9SLaa	Hello there.. <br>  Awesome question.<br>  To rightly divide the word of the truth is to cut straight the word of the truth.<br>  We are encouraged in 2 Tim 2:15 to be diligent to present ourselves approved to God, as unashamed workers who rightly divide or cut straight the word of the truth.<br>  <br>  As in carpentry. It means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion.<br>  <br>  Our God desires that all men be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth. ( 1 Tim 2:4)<br>  <br>  This truth that we are rightly dividing and cutting straight is the reality, denoting all the real things revealed in God's Word. Every person who is saved should have a full knowledge and a complete realization of these things.  This truth concerns mainly Christ as the Embodiment of God, the Church as the Body of Christ.<br>  <br>  The epistles of Timothy is to deal with the church's decline. In the 1st Epistle the decline crept in through different teachings (1 Tim 1:3) and in the 2nd epistle, it had developed openly and was worsening through heresies ( 2 Tim 2:16-18)<br>  <br>  So to deal with the decline, the truth must be maintained. The first epistle of Timothy emphasized that God desired all men to be saved and to have a full knowledge of the truth and that the Church is the Pillar and Base of the truth (1 Tim 3:15)<br>  <br>  The Second Epistle stresses that the word of the truth should be rightly unfolded and that the ones who have deviated should return to the truth.<br>  <br>  2 Tim 2:25<br>  In meekness correcting those who oppose, if perhaps God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth"<br>  <br>  Grace be with all of us here as we seek the Lord in handling His Word, May we never be found in heresies or different teachings, but rightly divide and cut straight the word of the Truth.<br>  <br>  Thank you for this question.<br>  In Christ<br>  sandy|`|dF5clN4daa	The Word of God is addressed to different groups of people... primarily to Israel and the Church.  <br>  <br>  Also, the Word of God reveals different "economies" as His plan for creation unfolds throughout the human experience.  For instance, How was Adam saved?  Did He have to accept Jesus as His personal Saviour?  Or how about the Jews that died prior to the resurrection of Jesus... did they have to confess Him as their Lord and saviour in order to be saved?<br>  <br>  Salvation came down from God to man and men can only be justified by faith.  And please don't mis'read what I'm saying... Without the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus all of creation would be doomed to hell but just how much of the Gospel did God reveal to men in ancient generations?

In this case I think it relates to one or the other, where as many took this passage to incorporate both. (besides that...we are suppose to grow past blame and strengthen acceptance).<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's not in changing the words, sometimes it is the choice some make not to try to find a greater reason for some text whether written or spoken ... Though shall not convey ... convey has many meanings - would all of the defintions be included ... I don't think so, we were meant to communicate (sharing a message) so I took it as though shouldn't "steal", converting is conveying without free will.<br>  <br>  Not finding the "bigger picture" within context would also be dividing the word. <br>  <br>  Dividing the word could also pertain to only referrencing chapter and verse, from context  just to suit a specific purpose. The practice of using one chapter and verse to prove a point rather than grasping the whole concept from any given chapter. If you only read chapter/verse, you'd miss the whole point of the story. <br>  <br>  That's my perception from your question.|`|6weK7biNaa	The movement of truth?

This is a result of some gay men and it is then assumed that all gay men are like that.  Many gay men are just plain men, who like being men but prefer to have a male as a partner for sexual activity.  They then to be more understanding than straight men as they know what it is like to be judged unfairly by others.  It is all the perception of those who don't quite know what they are talking about.

VRl1jENHaa	Are you referring to "Shiggaion," at places such as the dedication lines before Psalm 7?<br>  <br>  The Hebrew word "shiggaion" has as its root word "shagah," which means "to wander," so "shiggaion" implies that it's a wandering song; in other words, Psalm 7 was composed by David while he wandered in the Judean desert, hiding from the wrath of Saul.  (BTW, scholars seem to think that King Saul and "Cush, the Benjamite" are one and the same.)

A "God" that makes sense, the non-punishing, non-judgmental, non-interfering, non-human laws of the Cosmos of which we are each a part, yes, that I believe in.<br>  <br>  4) Absolutely. No doubt about it.|`|qda3oneuaa	To start with, i believe in god. but i believe that he doesn't judge, i don't believe in the ten commandments or anything like that, i think that god wouldn't shun anyone from eternal happiness. Also i think the bible is kind of off, i mean the bible isn't written in gods point of you (yes i know how stupid i sound) but how can anyone really know? I don't believe in reincarnation but it is a interesting topic, i love studying other religions. and then with fate and destiny i believe that there are certain things that you will have to face regardless of past decisions but the decisions after you are faced with whatever it is, is what deals your next fate. i don't know if that makes sense or not and i don't necessarily believe in soul mates, i don't know why but i just think that if we all had soul mates you would find them, naturally, and my parents are stuck with each other, they aren't soul mates, i can tell you that ha ha but i mean if there were soul mates their purpose would be, to be with each other and live happily ever after and i have heard too many stories of hurt and pain to think we would be jipped of such a wonderful ending.|`|1e2a6fa5fb61da506030373affea1905aa	1.

I always joke that humanity was destined to have free will. I do not believe in fate, only in complex probabilities.<br>  2. No.<br>  3. Depends how you define 'god.'<br>  4. It's the most likely of any posited continuance of existence, but I do not believe concrete personas would likely continue intact (even beyond loss of memory).
u8CFwtyMaa	You sound just like me at 14. You have some time to go before you need to decide your sexuality, this could just be a phase in puberty, or you may be bisexual.  Make friends with people of both sexes, and if any turn into relationships, then see how you feel. Most of all, have fun finding out.  Hope this helps|`|SZGirUZkaa	I'm The Reverse Flip    Rather Date A Guy, Rather Sleep With A Girl    I'm Bi-sexual, And So Are You By The Sounds Of Things :)|`|Oi3GTByKaa	What is your question?   p.s. don't worry about sex or relationships at your age anyway..you have a lot to learn yet (and you will agree with me when you are older).|`|4dQjVb59aa	try dating a guy|`|tL5YbnWjaa	To thine own self be true.

Luckily, you're not old enough for a serious relationship anyway.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	At 14 many guys are still confused about things like this and quite often they have a crush on a mate and other guys but eventually realise that their preferences are for women . Don't put yourself in a box just yet , have a group of friends of both sexes and maximise your interests   At 14 I also fancied other guys , but to fit in I went out with girls . Back when I was that age the word gay had not come into being and other more hurtful words were used . None of my relationships with girls ever came to anything really serious and I never enjoyed sex with a female . By 16 I knew for definite that I was gay

KBxz1Wfyaa	Feel your pain Ginger.  Lived through those years and still living with their PMS.  It's a real lively household sometimes when my menopause kicks in.  No wonder my husband spends so much time in the basement working on scrollsawing.:-)|`|AAgX0SDcaa	My daughter had an additional hormone problem, thyroid disorder. She was extremely irritable, if I looked in her general direction she thought I was staring at her, and if anyone gave her a compliment she considered it criticism. She calmed down after a couple of weeks on thyroid medicine but still had her PMS moments. One time I warned her before we went shopping not be negative or we would leave.  So we went inside Walmart, wasn't about 10 minutes and she said something about what I was looking at and I put it down and went straight out the door to the car. She got a serious look and followed me. The next day she told me she didn't feel well the day before (she also had another chronic illness). I told that I understood but she had to learn to control her mouth despite that or I wouldn't take her in public.|`|SfGyzMSFaa	My heart goes out to you Ginger; and also to the 12 year old. One of the ways I made it through the teen years with my own girls (with my sanity intact) when they tested the limits and objected to decisions (with great histrionics) was to remind myself that this is a Developmental Milestone, which means one step closer to being on their own!|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Despite what many think, she's not too old for an old-fashioned<br>  spanking.

That was uncalled for. What an insulting person you are.<br>  ASKER- I raised 3 kids, and the oldest did what yours is doing now. She is now 37 and has 5 kids of her own. The oldest, a 13 year old boy, is going through that. THESE CHILDREN ARE BEING RAISED IN THE LOVE AND ADMONITION OF THE LORD. They are in church, Sunday school, Youth group, and are prayed with daily. They are punished when they get sassy, and lovingly told why they are corrected. So, mamaceda, it happens! Even when you are striving to raise them to show respect. It IS puberty and maybe you cannot remember, but you did go through it. I know I did!|`|cr7DZb7Caa	At 12, PMS is 24/7/365.

I was lucky I didnt go through puberty hell with my daughter, but she made up for it.<br>  <br>  First year in High School.<br>  <br>  My daughter did a Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde thing in grade 9, I lost my sweet lovely easy going responsible loving little girl and a b**ch on wheels moved in. <br>  <br>  The tantrums ! The accusations ! Everything I said or did was challenged. Everything was wrong. I was wrong. I was the worst mother on earth.  It was a very sad year. She kind of levelled out after that, until the fall of 2007  <br>  <br>  Last year she had some kind of relapse when she got pregnant, oh wait, thats hormonal too now that I think of it, I havent even see my 7 month old grandson. <br>  <br>  Dont even argue with her, you cant win and that just makes you "mean" and gives her more reason to rag on you.  Just nod and smile, and drink a lot (just kidding) Its tough, this too should pass and if it doesnt there is always boot camp.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	She is testing her wings and getting ready to fly from the nest.

Thank GOD my husband is giving up Family Guy for Lent! <br>  <br>  I mean, come on, not a single good role model in the bunch, especially for women. If I were going to pick a good female role model amongst all the women on the Adult Swim lineup, I would have to pick either Connie or Tilly (Hank's mom) from King of the Hill. Connie's intelligent, motivated, but down to earth and not overly ambitious and greedy for worldly wealth like her parents are, and Tilly? Well, she is obviously a loving mother and the reason Hank's such a good guy, not to mention of average intelligence.<br>  <br>  Family Guy is one of the dumbest shows out there.

9YMLsk7Taa	Who do you think gave the medical experts their capacity to learn and discover new things to help mankind? Yes Jesus heals today i am living proof of that but sometimes He does it through the medical field. He gave us the common sense to know when we are sick we need help. really your question makes me angry! It seems that you are saying if we have enough faith God will heal us and seeking medical help somehow shows a lack of faith.  If that is the case who are you to judge anyones level of faith?! That is between me and God! I have been in the fire where i have had to have faith to get me through, thankfully i also had enough God given sense to seek help! So are you saying because i have kidney disease now i do not have enough faith to be healed? Paul also had a thorn in the flesh, and Jesus told him that His strength was made perfect through it, who are you to intimate that you know the mind or plan of Almighty God?!! Now you have upset me cause i really thought you were more discerning than that...... Forgive me for taking this personal, but if God did not intend for human beings to be able to do great things in science and medicine He would not have given us the intellect to accomplish these things. God did not give us wings either but He gave us a mind to understand and accomplish aviation .|`|AA12152549	There exists the notion that physicians are God's agents for healing.

God does use doctors and medical science as a instrument. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, not everyone who is sick deserves to be healed. Sometimes people are sick because of their own wrong doings.<br>  <br>  If you smoke and then get some incurable/untreatable cancer as a result you can't blame God or say God should of healed you because God can heal. That one is on you and no one is to blame for that but you yourself. <br>  <br>  Lastly, in order to be healed you need faith. It's not reasonable to expect God to heal you when you have little or no faith. God does want us to  believe and belief is an essental part of being healed.|`|ZL6Y39lPaa	Just because a religious individual has faith, doesn't mean they're going to be negligent about their health.<br>  <br>  God doesn't help those who don't help themselves.<br>  <br>  He abhors idleness.|`|JFqcr5Ggaa	WHY BOTHER GOD WITH THE SMALL QUESTIONS.|`|cdFqekzZaa	He never said to hold a job either.I'm going on welfare.

zZxX5PXBaa	Climate, mainly.    If you exclude the 'new world' countries, you're left with a basic pattern of beer in the northern european countries, and wine in the southern. There are some overlaps, of course, but it's basically that in the modern era (it was different as recently as Roman times) you can't ripen grapes consistently enough in the north of Europe to be able to make good wine, or to be able to make a variety of styles of wine. What you can ripen in the north are wheat and barley and hops, so you can make various sorts of beers.    The new world countries you mention have basically followed the culture of the dominant ethnic or national groups that colonised those territories ... where it's been possible climatically to grow the appropriate plants.    The slightly weird thing is how this all correlates with predominantly Catholic countries in southern europe and south america, and predominantly Protestant countries in northern europe and north america. Theologians from both major traditions have been working on this one for centuries, and while they do all seem to build up a great appreciation of the other culture's preferred alcohol, they rarely remain sober long enough to write anthing very enlightening. In my view we need more theologians of this type.    Your language correlation, which is absolutely right, is I suspect more to do with the fact that the Romance languages have dominated southern Europe, while Germanic languages have dominated northern Europe. I really don't know why, apart from historical accident, that should be. The correlation with Catholic / Protestant still holds good though, and it's hard not to see that as a basic part of the big cultural divide.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	Das BOOOOT!!!|`|JIoZG0Mnaa	european countries believe wine is to life and vice versa and germany consumes beer as a tradition its part of their customs|`|GOk8dWAUaa	I don't know why, but it's true.

Most people grow up with and adopt the culture of the race that is predominant in their lives.  So it's to be expected that most people marry in their own race.  It's not really about race.  People can be attracted to any race.  It's about sharing culture.  You're more likely to share cultural values with people in your own race.

But you have to think of this differently. Why should it be socially acceptable for some people to purposely isolate themselves? Honestly, what people should realize is, for white people at least, especially in England, it's pure probability... When most of the population is white, that's who it's going to be most common for white's to marry... With blacks and Asians, there's less, so it's harder for them to isolate. Many are immigrants though, and got married in their prvious countries...<br>  <br>  Each person has their own level of physical attraction, I guess. Maybe some people just like dating people who look like themselves, but when you say it like that, it doesn't sound as attractive... Personally, even though I'm white, I love black women and nothing is going to change that. It's just a physical preference. But I'm open to all backgrounds... Better yet though, why not just be a single guy who can keep all my money I make to myself?

lh2H5oSOaa	Holy prophet Muhammad brought the last and final message from God Almighty which summarizes earlier revelations and improves upon them for the humanity. <br>  <br>  HE NEVER SAID HE WAS SUPERIOR TO JESUS OR MOSES. But most Muslims conclude this on their own, seeing his performance compared to the earlier prophets.<br>  <br>  Judaism was a outward looking religion, whereas Christianity is essentially inward looking religion. Islam draws a balance. It allows indulgence in agriculture, business and industry, but has set stringent rules of  business. Unlike Christianity, it encourages you to marry and has decided rights of both spouses.It has specifically emphasized on a happy and productive married life. Rights of parents have been defined and like Christian and Jews, Muslims do not throw them out in the old people's home to lead a hopeless life there.<br>  <br>  Only a blind can say that Islam did not bring any improvement in the rights and duties of  various sections of society and among families.It stopped lending on interest which is by far the most important reason for collapse of  financial system. It gave definite rights to workers.<br>  <br>  In order to know what Islam is, you have to observe it with an open mind.<br>  <br>                                              Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	Yes,<br>  Because Jesus came to loosen the tightness of the Law of Moses after the Jews have tightened upon themselves.<br>  This is why Jesus was making a mockery of the way the Jews were implementing and abusing the law. Jesus never intended to cancel the law it was a misunderstanding of later Christians.<br>  If what Jesus intended about the Law had happened we would have ended up with something close to Islam.<br>  I will give an example, when Jesus said let the one who did not sin cast the first stone, this is exactly the Islamic stand.|`|85c6832eec366f539d7b941dc3b61894aa	Islam has peaceful stuff?|`|45Mmu3SFaa	Disagree big time !!!|`|uJO0MbShaa	Did Moses decapitate people and chop their hands and feet off?|`|bfWcfCKXaa	No. Islam is a cross between 7th century Arabian superstition/cruelty and pre-scientific ancient Hebraic superstition/cruelty. Superstition X Cruelty + superstition X cruelty = LOTS OF BOTH!|`|UIJorsD7aa	Not at all!!!<br>  <br>  Basic Islamic theology teaches that since Allah sent Gabriel down with the Quran to Muhammad the messenger of Allah, Muhammad and the Quran fulfill and complete the mission of Christ and the New Testament. Muhammad seems to recognize the value of the Bible (Suras 4:47; 4:136; 4:163; 5:44—48; 5:82—83; 6:92, 154), but ultimately Christianity and the New Testament must yield to Islam and the Quran, the new and superior revelation. <br>  <br>  Since Muhammad lays down a serious challenge to Christ and Christianity, we Christians must answer him. What would Christ say? As it turns out, he has given us a clear teaching on how to evaluate a prophet who comes after him in history, especially if the later prophet asserts his superiority over Christ: call it fruit inspection.<br>  <br>  In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Christ spoke to the multitudes, few of whom or none of whom were theologians, but simple agrarians. In Matt. 7:15—20, Christ uses unambiguous language about discerning the truthfulness of prophets:<br>  <br>  7:15 Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. 16 By their fruit you shall know them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 17 Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is thrown into the fire. 20 Thus, by their fruit you shall know them.<br>  <br>  In today's western world in which millions would prefer to not rock the boat with Islam but to accommodate it, this passage may stand out as intolerant. But in these verses Christ understands the stakes. Religious truth—claims come into the world by the dozens, seemingly every second, and these claims are not abstract; the lives of people are at risk. So the price of accommodation, especially since 9/11, is too high. <br>  <br>  Besides, it is Muhammad who says that he is superior to Christ and that his new religion improves on Christianity. He is the one who issued the challenge in the first place. Therefore, 600+ years before Muhammad came on the world stage, Christ answers him and numerous self—described prophets who stalked the Mediterranean world with a fruit inspection.<br>  <br>  To illustrate, let us suppose that I claim that my way is better than yours. Then I should be able to back up my verbal assertion with my actions in obvious ways. My behavior should actually be better than yours, for my actions speak louder than my words. Specifically, if I as the founder of a religion say that husbands in my community are allowed to beat their wives (Sura 4:34), but you as the founder of a religion say that husbands in your community are not allowed to beat their wives, then how can my alleged superiority stand up in real life? I am promoting an empirically bad practice, but you are not.<br>  <br>  I simply do not pass fruit inspection. That is, my fruit or behavior or down—to—earth practices are rotten. Therefore, Christ is absolutely correct to use this simple test for his followers to examine the claims of later prophets. "By their fruit you shall know them" (Matt. 7:16)<br>  <br>  We can boil down Muhammad's challenge and Christ's fruit inspection in a simple if—then logical argument. This one is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent (the "then" clause). <br>  <br>  (1) If A, then B. If Islam improves on Christianity, then these improvements should show up in observable, down—to—earth ways.<br>  <br>  (2) Not—B. But these improvements do not show up in observable, down—to—earth ways.<br>  <br>  (3) Therefore, not—A. Therefore, Islam does not improve on Christianity.

Abraham was about 75 years old and living in Ur of the Chaldees when God one day spoke to him. God, through His amazing grace, wanted to make another covenant with man and chose Abraham as His partner. The covenant He made with him was again unconditional and contained many promises (Gen 12:1-3). The only hint of a condition appears to be that Abraham had to forsake his home and family and go to a land God would show him. When Abraham obeyed and entered the land the promises became fixed. God promised to: <br>  1. Make Abraham a great nation (vs. 2). This promise has been fulfilled both physically and spiritually. Physically through Isaac and Ishmael, spiritually through all those who have Abraham's faith (Gal. 3:7). <br>  <br>  2. To bless him (vs. 2), and He did this also both physically (13:14-18) and spiritually (15:6). <br>  <br>  3. To make his name great (vs. 2). Still today the name of Abraham is known and respected by millions. <br>  <br>  4. Make him a blessing to others (vs. 2). Abraham blessed people in his own time and blessed humanity by his seed Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  5. To bless those who bless him (vs. 3). <br>  <br>  6. And curse those who curse him (vs. 3). God has not only blessed those who blessed Abraham, but He also blessed those who blessed the nation that sprang from his loins, Israel. On the other hand, those who cursed Israel (Babylon, Assyria, Rome, Germany, etc.) must suffer. Some have suffered already, but these promises will not be completely fulfilled until the future. <br>  <br>  7. Bless all the families of the earth in him (vs. 3). The fulfillment of this is Christ himself, who blesses all those who believe on Him with salvation and who will also physically bless all who are in the millennium. <br>  <br>  Though this covenant is unconditional it does not apply universally to everyone. Doctrinally, it only applies to the Hebrew race through Isaac and Jacob (Israel). Gentiles can only get in on it by receiving Abraham's promised Seed—Jesus Christ. Those who refuse to receive Him, Jew or Gentile, will be judged by Him. <br>  <br>  Like the Noahic Covenant this covenant also has a sign, and it is circumcision (Gen. 17:9-14). Circumcision is a token of the promises God has made to Abraham and his seed, and anyone who refused or neglected to accept it was cut off from his people and the promises (excommunication). Circumcision was the only obligation Abraham and his people had under this covenant. If they performed it by faith, they had full access to all the promises. God again reconfirmed this covenant in Genenis chapter 15 after Abraham "believed in the Lord..." and asked for more details. After Abraham offered five offerings as God commanded, the Lord again affirmed the covenant and revealed how Abraham's seed would be a stranger in a land (Egypt) and afflicted for 400 years. God also revealed the boundaries of the land given to Abraham. Moreover, God promised all of this to Abraham while Abraham was asleep! This proves the covenant is unconditional. God reconfirmed the covenant again after Abraham passed his severe but revealing test of offering Isaac (Gen. 22:15-18). <br>  <br>  Another significant thing about this covenant is it apparently has no ending. It goes beyond the Millennium and renovation of the earth and even past the New Heaven and New Earth. Therefore, the nation of Israel, governed by its Messiah and King, will still be in existence at the gate of eternity. <br>  <br>  The dispensation that began with this covenant is called the Dispensation of Promise for obvious reasons. For the first time God has made promises to one group of people at the exclusion of all others. From the time of Abraham on in the Old Testament, the only way someone other than an Israelite could partake of the promises was to become an Israelite himself (Ruth, for example [Ruth 1:16]). Again, the only way now is to receive Jesus Christ. By some this dispensation is called the Dispensation of the Family because everything God had to say to man He said to this one family. The promises He made to Abraham He reconfirmed to his son Isaac, his grand-son Jacob, and then to Jacob's sons, the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel. The manner of behavior God expected in this dispensation is much like the previous except that He told Abraham to go to a certain land and stay there (Canaan). <br>  <br>  Abraham obeyed in going to the land, but when a famine came and times got hard he fled into Egypt for food. He could not yet trust God enough to stay. This again shows the weakness and failure of man to live up to God's requirements. In every dispensation man in some way fails to keep God's word and consequently brings judgment upon himself.|`|5e5c65a2cd3552e7b1ff218d6c990e26aa	The covenant reaches to all who commit their lives to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

What an embarrassment. <br>  <br>  The LDS church has purposely positioned itself to be in the forefront of the movement to stop Gays. It isn't because they hate them - it's because the church wants to appear to people as the Force for Good in an Evil World.<br>  <br>  It's all about instilling fear in people to make them more amenable to religion and control. How else can you get their tithing?<br>  <br>  The LDS church has become increasingly reactionary in the last 2-3 decades. It is telling everyone how to vote and harping on being the last bastion of goodness.<br>  <br>  It isn't playing well with everyone, but the hardcore members will become more and more right wing nut jobs if they keep listening.|`|l8z7OVqNaa	The religious right is more full of S H IT than those broken toilets at the public restrooms.  <br>  <br>  Gay people hate his values because his values stress homophobia.

That's not good for your cause my friend.  There are Mormons that would agree with you - and you don't want to offend them.

Most Pentacostals practice a modern form of Montanism, which was a second century gnostic cult that thought it received special revelation through "prophets."

It is narrated in a number of saheeh ahaadeeth that the words al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep) are to be said in the adhaan for Fajr. It is mentioned in some of them that this phrase is to be said in the first adhaan without stating what is meant by the phrase the first adhaan  is it the adhaan that is given before Fajr or is it the adhaan of Fajr itself?   These ahaadeeth include the following:   1  It was narrated that Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I used to give the adhaan for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and in the first adhaan of Fajr I used to say: Hayya ala al-falaah, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, Allaahu akbar Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (come to prosperity, prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, there is no god but Allaah).   Narrated by Abu Dawood, 500; al-Nasaai, 647; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.   2  It was narrated that Ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: In the first adhaan after the word al-falaah it said: Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep).   Shaykh al-Albaani said:   It was narrated by al-Tahhaawi (1/82) with a hasan isnaad as al-Haafiz said in al-Talkhees (3/169).   Al-Thamr al-Mustataab, p. 131   These ahaadeeth provide evidence for those who said that this should be said in the first adhaan which comes at the end of the night. But the correct view is that it should be in said the adhaan which comes after the time for prayer has begun. That is for a number of reasons:   (a)  The word awwal (first) is in relation to the iqaamah, and the iqaamah is the second call to prayer. In the saheeh Sunnah there are reports in which the iqaamah is called an adhaan, as in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Between each two calls (adhaanayn)... Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 598; Muslim, 838.   In Saheeh Muslim (739) the adhaan which comes after the time for prayer begins is called the first adhaan. This appears in the hadeeth narrated by Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) about the prayer of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She said: He used to sleep during the first part of the night and wake up during the latter part, then if he had any need for intimacy with his wife he would satisfy that need, then he would sleep. Then when it was the time of the first call, he would wake up and pour water over himself, and if he was not junub he would do wudoo as a man does for prayer, then he would pray two rakahs.   What is meant by two rak'ahs here is the regular Sunnah of Fajr, as stated by al-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim.   (b)   In some saheeh ahaadeeth it is clearly stated that the adhaan in which this phrase appears is called adhaan salaat al-subh, adhaan al-fajr, etc. These phrases indicate that this adhaan should come after the time for the prayer begins and the adhaan that is given at the end of the night comes before the time for prayer begins. These ahaadeeth include the following:   1  It was narrated that Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allaah, teach me the Sunnah of adhaan. He wiped the front of my head and said: Say Allaah akbar, Allaahu akbar, Allaah akbar, Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great) And if it is Fajr prayer, then say: Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep).   According to another, similar report, it says: Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep) in the first adhaan of dawn.   Narrated by Abu Dawood, 501; al-Nasaai, 633; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.   According to another report narrated by Abu Dawood (504) from Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him): He used to say in Fajr: al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep). Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.   2  It was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: It is Sunnah for the muezzin, after saying Hayya ala al-falaah (come to prosperity), to say: al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep) twice.   Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:   This was narrated by al-Daaraqutni (90), Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh and al-Bayhaqi in his Sunan (1/423), and he said: its isnaad is saheeh.   It was also narrated by al-Daraaqutni and al-Tahhaawi (1/82) via Hushaym from Ibn Awn with the wording: In the adhaan for Fajr prayer, when the muezzin said: Hayya ala al-falaah (come to prosperity), he said: al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep), twice. This version was narrated by Ibn al-Sakan who classed it as saheeh, as it says in al-Talkhees, 3/148   Al-Thamr al-Mustataab, p. 132   These ahaadeeth show that this phrase appears in the adhaan for Fajr prayer.   The adhaan which is the call to prayer is that which comes after the time for the prayer has begun, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When the time for prayer begins, then let one of you give the adhaan for you. Agreed upon.   As for the adhaan which comes at the end of the night, this is not an adhaan for Fajr prayer as such, rather it is done so that the one who is praying qiyaam may go back and the one who is asleep may wake up, as is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in al-Saheehayn.

VRl1jENHaa	Roman Catholics misunderstand this because they read Yeshua's statement "this is my body ... this is my blood" using Western methods of understanding.  HOWEVER, they forget that Yeshua was/is a Jew, speaking to Jews, in a completely Jewish setting.  It's a fact that, throughout the Scriptures, we see Jews speaking metaphorically over and over again; and even today, Jews have a love for metaphor.  At 1 Kings 22, we see an example:<br>  <br>  11 Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and he said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘With these you shall gore the Syrians until they are destroyed.’”<br>  <br>  Zedekiah was speaking METAPHORICALLY.<br>  <br>  At 1 Kings 11, we see another prophetic metaphor:<br>  <br>  30 Then Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces. 31 And he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you 32 (but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel), 33 because they have forsaken Me, and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the people of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways to do what is right in My eyes and keep My statutes and My judgments, as did his father David.<br>  <br>  Obviously, Ahijah was speaking metaphorically when he compared Israel and Judea to a torn garment.<br>  <br>  So back to my point:  to understand what Yeshua meant when He was talking about His body and blood, you MUST place it into a Jewish context, realizing that metaphor is a recurring prophetic tool.  While Yeshua was much more than a prophet, He was a prophet nonetheless.  And He prophesied in the manner of the Jews.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	It is whatever God says it is, and Jesus said it's his body and his blood, made truly present for us on the altar through the power of the Holy Spirit, and the by the authentic ministry of the Catholic priesthood.<br>  <br>  Not symbolic or ethereal.

Anyone who eats this bread will live for ever; and the bread that I shall give is my flesh, for the life of the world.'  <br>  52 Then the Jews started arguing among themselves, 'How can this man give us his flesh to eat?'  <br>  53 Jesus replied to them: In all truth I tell you, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.  <br>  54 Anyone who does eat my flesh and drink my blood has eternal life, and I shall raise that person up on the last day.  <br>  55 For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.  <br>  56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in that person.  <br>  57 As the living Father sent me and I draw life from the Father, so whoever eats me will also draw life from me.  <br>  58 This is the bread which has come down from heaven; it is not like the bread our ancestors ate: they are dead, but anyone who eats this bread will live for ever.

AjFA8qIxaa	It means cheers. I have to correct the answer that said you can also 'Zum Wohl' but that its more meant for wine.Thats not true. Zum Wohl is just another saying. You could say its a little more proper.  But its just different people prefering different ways of saying cheers. It also depends where in Germany you go.   You go to bavaria for example you will mostly hear prost!Or proesterchen! In thuringia it will be zum wohl.  Also really no one says prosit. There is just that one song drunk people like to sing: Ein prosit, ein prosit auf die gemuetlichkeit!|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Straight-- down the hatch|`|QYDYX9B7aa	prostate|`|wVJ1jAyJaa	Yes, you're right  it's "cheers"|`|MeeJWmGtaa	It's similar to "cheers", and it's short for "Prosit!", which comes from Latin "prodesse", meaning "may it be good for you".|`|NAFBX5mDaa	Prost is one way of saying cheers -- 'zum Wohl' is another way. Zum Wohl is used mostly with wine or champagne, while prost is best for beer =)    P.S. Skye is right that 'zum Wohl' is more formal -- and people do have different preferences in different parts of the country, it would seem, BUT it's still an open question of etiquette that not all German speakers agree on. I fall into the 'prost' with beer and 'zum Wohl' for 'das edle Nass' (wine and champagne) camp =)|`|gfHl31Hwaa	cheers|`|61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	Looked it up it means Cheers.|`|YzwuDRfYaa	"Cheers" or "your good health".

AA10945101	Interesting question.  I think you made a valid point about the impact of such "empty gestures" on God.  However, I think you're discounting the impact they might have on human beings.<br>  <br>  For one, putting "in God we trust" on our money allows believers to use the security offered by money as a surrogate for the security offered by God.  Without God's name on the money, then a believer would be forced to accept that they are putting their trust in the government alone when they put their trust in the money it creates.  <br>  <br>  For some believers, putting God's name on their money serves as a reminder that all the money they have is a gift from God.  That makes it a lot easier for them to give a lot more of that money back to him since his name is already on it!  <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't care if they remove "In God We Trust" from the money because I think it's pretty clear that as a nation, we stopped trusting God a long time ago.  It isn't an "empty gesture" as far as I'm concerned, it is instead a deliberate misrepresentation of the truth.<br>  <br>  As for prayer in school, there are some demonstrated benefits in terms of behavior and respect for authority associated with having prayers in school.  Of course, those prayers don't have to be "Christian" to have the same positive impact...it's just that something about acknowledging a higher authority that's watching your every move tends to have a positive impact on the behavior of children.  Prayers to Santa Claus would have the same type of positive impact.  <br>  <br>  However, as a Christian, I believe that praying to God can and does have additional positive benefits above and beyond the psychological benefits of acknowledging a "higher power" with the authority to reward or punish.  In that respect, it doesn't matter that it is an "empty gesture" for some or even many of the people participating in the event.  The prayers of the believers in the group can influence the way God involves himself in what happens at that school.  Yes, they can pray alone, but they are children and a reminder in the form of a "prayer time" in school may increase the number of children sincerely asking God to intervene in their school.<br>  <br>  I am in favor of returning prayer to public schools...not the forced recitation of some Christian prayer that some (perhaps many) schools used at one time (and some private schools still use today), but setting aside time for remind children to pray about their educational experiences.  We don't have to tell them what prayer to say...it could even be a cultural learning experience by allowing children of different faiths (and no faith) to share what they believe in a way that ties behavior and learning at school into their beliefs! <br>  <br>  It seems a shame that we don't find positive, productive ways to retain the practical benefits of prayer in school instead of avoiding conflict by eliminating it to satisfy a relatively small percentage of the population.  Seems a case of "throwing out the baby with the bath water".  It is difficult enough to "harness the energies" (to put it nicely) of a group of young children but by eliminating prayer in school, we lose the opportunity to benefit from the religious-related discipline and respect for authority that many of those children are learning at home.  <br>  <br>  It may not benefit all children but it doesn't harm them to take a minute or two each day to remind the children that do believe to ask God to be with them that day.  If nothing else, the act of publicly stating your beliefs and linking them to your behavior creates peer accountability that should reduce behavior problems.  A student that prays, "God help me to obey my teacher today" is gong to get "called out" by most of the class if he or she disobeys later in the day!|`|Xur5b9o3aa	Let me put it like this, I am white cherokee mix, since the landing of my white ancestors God was allready accepted as a part of my indian haritage and on both sides a staple.

mU2eMSi3aa	I don't think they get it; why belief itself is a requirement to receiving what has supposedly already been done for everyone.  I think it is because there are two types of belief.  The one being just what you yourself cognitively come up with independently through your own thought processes and the other being your values and such that you use to view the world through.  The first one comes mostly through personal experience.  For example; you get bit by a dog, you believe dogs are dangerous and so you avoid dogs or; your dad has a good job so you believe a degree will get you a better job so you go to college.  The other kind of belief comes from abstract ideas or values that you accept as fact and judge everything else by it.  If you believe that a religion is true or a person or concept is true you will accept everything else they tell you is true and you will judge every decision and event in your life by how it stands up to that mold.  It essence you surrender your thoughts and actions, your beliefs, to them.  So for example; you get bit by a dog but you believe through your religion that you are a sinner in need of punishment and so the dog is only doing the will of God or; your dad is a righteous man and has a good job so you must be a righteous man to have a good job and if you don't have a good job it is not because you didn't go to college, it is because you must have upset God in some way (probably you didn't believe in Him enough).  So it is very important for religions that you "believe" in them and make them your value system because once you do, you are their dominions and will submit yourself to whatever they tell you about God and everything else you should believe.|`|AA11124121	"magic?" there's no more "magic" to Christendom than electricity going through a light bulb.<br>  <br>  What are you talking about Gods "ego."<br>  <br>  God has no ego.

8G42oyydaa	I helped start a Fibromyalgia support group, what we did was go to the different places that provided medical services, medical clinics, the hospital, mental health, physio etc and put up a notice on bulletin boards, also grocery stores, laundromats, community facilities anywhere really. Word your bulletin as "Aspergers Support Group" dont say do you want to form a group, put on a contact phone #. Approach your community resource centre to see about a place to meet, dont have people coming into your home. Try the Y too, this is a good place to start.<br>  <br>  You dont need to pay for a newpaper ad or put out any of your own money, thats just dumb.  But first make sure you can arrange for a meeting place that is conveniently located. <br>  <br>  Good Luck !  You can contact national groups for free materials, and your local autism group should also be a good source for materials, they might even help you get it started !|`|Xkas9BG2aa	That's great you have a concern for your brother.  My neighbor has Asperger's, and prior to meeting him, I only had heard of one other person with Asperger's... and that was in the media.  She was Burt Bacharach and Angie Dickinson's daughter who was on the news for committing suicide....they said after many years of struggling with Asperger's.  My neighbor is estranged from his family in another state and seems depressed many times.  Because I associated Asperger's with suicide due to the media story, I think sometimes he wants to kill himself.  I have suggested to him NAMI and another Mental Health org., but he doesn't want to go.  <br>  <br>  I think the key is a Family that cares...like yours seems to do.  For your own family support group, do you have a branch of NAMI in your town because they have meetings for clients and family groups.  NAMI has chapters in every state and most large cities in America.  Also, if there's a mental health org. in your town, that would be a good place to hold meetings.  Good Luck.|`|dIxATqQoaa	Honestly, I believe it depends on what part of the country you live in.

f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Not such a big one anymore, but up until the mid 80's NZ had close ties with England & used to copy it all the time.  For instance alot of newsreaders here spoke with a British accent just like BBC ones!!  Even though the NZ accent was nothing like that.  NZ used to worship the Royal Family up until the mid 80's, people would get very excited & come out in their thousands to see the Queen when she came to NZ.  Then people lost respect & these days no one is particularly interested & I alot of NZers would be ok being a republic (no longer a member of the British Commonwealth).  <br>  <br>  Both NZ & Australia have the Union Jack in the corner of their flag, although both countries have been talking about altering the flag for many years now, where the Union Jack would no longer be in it.<br>  <br>  In NZ British TV & music & to a lesser extent, British movies, have always been popular (particularly Coronation Street & British comedies).<br>  <br>  Most European NZers are of UK descent, most of them English, followed by Scottish (especially in the South Island where there is a heavy Scottish influence), followed by Ireland.<br>  <br>  I am a 4th generation NZer & my ancestry is 3 quarters Irish & 1 quarter Bohemian (now the Czech Republic).  Because of this I've never felt particularly close to England, but I can see where certain Irish things are relevant in my upbringing like, humour & a certain outlook on things like the Irish, a love of music & a love of the English language & books/literature.  Personally I don't like the "stiff, upper lip" part of English culture & the way they can be very strict & have a way of looking down on certain people through class or race.  You get the impression the English look down on countries like NZ or Australia, as though we will never measure up to England.  The thing about that is, we don't care!!|`|AA11180647	england owned all that down under and used Australia as a penal colony and its close|`|9BeUbORtaa	A certain emotional constipation, homoerotic but anxious and potentially violent friendships between men, a drinking culture of excess, residual racism, a colonial inferiority complex seeking vent in aggressive anti-intellectualism and sport.

I therefore put all my trust and faith in Him, knowing that He will protect me, defend me and be there for me in times of trouble. So I dont have many worries, as Iknow He cares for me.

Thank you.  While I am not a religious person I do believe that religious people do indeed experience those moments of peace that you describe.  It's just that living in the hustle and bustle of this crazy and materialistic world is hard and dealing with a mind that goes on over-drive is enough to drive us all mad at times.  I guess what I'm saying is what you are positing is no easy feat but at least the religious try to understand that which lies beyond them and that is a step in the right direction, reaching beyond oneself and thereby breaking free from the prison if only for a moment.  Life can be hard and is surely mysterious.<br>  <br>  Thanks for sharing your perspective.  I really appreciated reading it.|`|WEM5n41Oaa	Your smart.  Satan is real and he is either in hell or roaming the world.  His disciples, which are demons, are warring against our minds everyday.  Everyday choose a time to sit and let go of all your problems.  Surrender them and your life to God.  You don't even need to mention God if you are sick of thinking about Him.  He doesn't want you to feel burdened like you mentioned in paragraph 2.  If you cast your burden on the cross Christ will bear it for you and you can chill out.  I mean you can have that peace.  Ask God for that peace, but don't ask God for anything once you start to relax with a quite peace of mind.  If you ask forgiveness to Christ He will give it to you.  God has books and He writes down every moment of our entire lives.  Just take a load off yourself.  He's a good God.  I worry about my sins because I don't want to go to hell.  It's good to try to please God but it shouldn't affect us in a negative way.  Sometimes Satan uses the things that we love against us.  Like loving God and wanting to obey Him.  I am an idiot and I am not repenting of some sins that I should.  I have just given up in some areas but I haven't given up on God.  Take a break from your regular rutien, don't be hard on yourself, and don't put so much pressure on yourself.
fYJGAXuFaa	When a person becomes a Christian the Holy Spirit indwells them. Baptism does not gives us the Holy Spirit, baptism only shows others that we are already a Christian.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Some Christian ideas are "doctrines in the church", they are the thoughts of philosophers and theologians in the past , sort of an.. if so facto. You are not going to find the exact word in the Bible but the presumption that  this particular idea is true due to inference.|`|e566c7b6d9b860034b1ffaf13f380ee7aa	It is not missing.  The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the same as being filled with the Holy Spirit.  This is clearly brought out in Acts chapters 10 and 11.
c316178951b8605e913804fde0cb6becaa	The idea of Satan in the water comes from an account in church history of a vision by Elder Phelps.<br>  <br>  D&C 61 (Preface) says: "Revelation given through JS the Prophet, on the bank of the Missouri River, McIlwaine's Bend, August 12, 1831. On their return trip to Kirtland the Prophet and ten elders had traveled down the Missouri River in canoes. On the third day of the journey many dangers were experienced. Elder W.W. Phelps, in daylight vision saw "the destroyer riding in power upon the face of the waters."<br>  <br>  Then later in verses 14-16: "Behold, I, the Lord, in the beginning blessed the waters; but in the last days, by the mouth of my servant John, I cursed the waters.<br>  <br>  "Wherefore, the days will come that no flesh shall be safe upon the waters.<br>  <br>  "And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the land of Zion upon the waters, but he that is upright in heart."<br>  <br>  It's not that we believe Satan controls the water so much as if you are not doing the Lord's will and cause yourself to lose His blessings through disobedience, Satan can have power over you.<br>  <br>  With missionaries, their hearts and minds are supposed to be focused on building the kingdom of God, they are about the Lord's errand, not their own.  So taking time for a swim is distracting from that, similar to dating, watching TV, etc.  Baths can also be considered leisurely, while a shower is quick and to the point (of cleansing the body).<br>  <br>  Many mission rules are not so much because the forbidden activity is bad, so much as they are about teaching the importance of obedience and to help the missionaries stay focused.|`|7VJcd5YLaa	They aren't allowed to swim because they are missionaries to WORK.  Swimming is recreational.<br>  <br>  They take showers/baths and baptize in a font - by immersion - so getting wet is part of the process.|`|TzY9vkinaa	I've never been on a mission or had family who went on a mission, so I'm not sure on why they can't swim. I do know that they take showers, they also go into water to baptize people.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	The devil doesn't "own the water".  There are lots of things missionaries can't generally do.  To name a few:<br>  <br>  -visit the beach<br>  -play football<br>  -play full court basketball<br>  -participate in extreme sports<br>  -read secular literature<br>  <br>  Swimming often involves playing around, diving boards, cliff jumping, water skiing, oceans, coral, jelly fish, sharks, rip ties, surf boards, beaches, bikini's, topless tanning, etc.  Not a great place for missionaries to be found.  If you have 60,000 missionaries at any given time, there will be accidents related to swimming.  <br>  <br>  I've heard of missionaries that needed to swim for physical therapy because of injuries.  If satan owned the water, members in general would be asked not to swim and we probably wouldn't use something the devil owned for the sacrament every week.  <br>  <br>  It's simply a safety measure and a precaution.  They can take baths.|`|OQ9SXUAMaa	They are not ALLOWED to drive motorcycles either, to leave the mission field or area, to go hunting, all these things are controlled by satan,:)<br>  jk|`|q5lreoiWaa	That's silly. Every time the missionaries baptize someone they are in the font.  Please give your questions more thought.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	my first reaction is "WHAT"????<br>  <br>  ok, now i remember the D&C quote. <br>  <br>  technically, i have never been swimming but Elders are not told to not take showers. <br>  <br>  hehe|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	If the reason missionaries couldn't go swimming was because of a belief that the devil "owned the water", then wouldn't all Mormons avoid the water, not just missionaries?  <br>  <br>  The main reason missionaries aren't allowed to go swimming because of what people at the pool or beach are wearing.  That's not what the missionaries are there for, or a distraction they need.  When they finish their mission, they can spend every day at the pool if they want, but while they're missionaries, they are told to avoid it.  Yes, they can take baths; and yes, they go into the water to baptize.  On my mission, we even did one baptism in the ocean itself, and that was perfectly fine (it was in the Fall and there were no people swimming there).|`|WSbtZMB3aa	LOL!<br>  <br>  That's a great joke, but who swims in their tub or bath?<br>  <br>  Whoever told you the devil owns the water, is pulling your leg.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah - they do baptize people IN water...don't you think it's a little odd Mormons would be "afraid of water," if they baptize people in it?|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	yea my dad on his mission trip saod that he went swimming on the beach in hawii, and he felt that satan was dragging him int he ocean, so he knew he should have never been in the water in the first place.

If it's osteoarthritis, glucosamine and chondroitin work well.  The store brands are cheaper than the name brands, and some stores like CVS and Walgreen's have sales several times a year where you can buy one and get one free.  I stock up on it when they do that.  Using the triple strength means taking fewer pills at a time.  I have tried it with MSM and didn't notice any improvement.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	The best thing you could do is go to a health store and talk to a salesman that knows the products. My friends swear by something they order online from Dr.Cherry in Houston Texas.   My mom used it too and said it is the best. Thank goodness I don't need it.They have arthritis and it is rather severe so it must be a good product however I don't think it is inexpensive. Maybe just check his price online.I have heard MSM works too.|`|mjKGbhNYaa	You post some of your questions in the senior section but as you know I get your questions.  Once again I am 44 and if you consider that a senior I wish that tommorow you wake up at my age.    I do not believe in all the crap that is out there.  Vitamins for instant weight loss, ones for your hair, anti-aging, heck even to grow a few more inches to make her happy.    Most of the folks here probably never experienced pain in the joints at   20 because they ate fresh vegetables and had a more laborious lifestyle than the younger generation enjoys.  "Remember had to walk a mile to school uphill both ways?".  Processed foods, MSGs, more pollution, more drug resistant infections are commonplace in your future.    Fresh or frozen vegetables, lean meats and proper exercise are your best bets for a healthier body.  Joint pain at this age is not normal.  If it is acute, it could be a low grade infection.  If it is chronic, it could be more serious.  I would start with the basics of diet and moderate exercise.    I look younger than most men my age by managing stress and moderately healthy living.  Ever noticed a heroin addict and how they look 20 years older than their age?

I have knee issues and it seems to help.  I have found a topical cream that works wonders! My acupuncturist recommends 'Topricin'. You can get it at some health/vitamin/natural stores or you can buy it on line. I've found that Amazon has the best prices. It's a product that works immediately, doesn't have an odor and isn't very expensive. I gave some to my mom and sister who both have arthritis and they are thrilled with the way it works. Good luck!

You are totally correct in saying it's wrong for an alcoholic to say getting high is bad for you.<br>  <br>  The best argument is to say that alcohol is THE ONLY and I mean THE ONLY drug you can die off of because of withdrawal.|`|LNwd9gXNaa	I think it is because of government regulation.  The federal government has thier hands into the billions that alcohol sales generates.  I agree with you that weed is less harmful than alcohol, and equally or less addictive.  Weed however is a natural plant, and can be grown by anybody... almost anywhere with minimal investment.  The federal government cant regulate its production, importation, or sale.  Because of this.. there are laws against posession, and use.  It isnt illegal in all countries.  There are even such things as "hash bars"..  Google Amsterdam.  Any way..  thats my thought.|`|15LN13IZaa	the government.<br>  the government says alcohol is OK.<br>  and drugs are absolutely illegal and very dangerous.<br>  <br>  when in reality. studies show marijuna is less dangerous than alcohol. <br>  you cant overdose. nor get chemically addicted.|`|RwHbF367aa	actually is not ok to get drunk or high.

Alcohol is addictive and can lead to lethal situations or just stupid ones.   Marijuana is not addictive and has no harmful side affects.  The difference in legality is due to the amount it would cost to switch from regular papers and cloth to hemp papers and cloth.  Even though the hemp papers and cloth would be healthier for the environment(less cut trees) and more efficient in manner with tougher consistency, it's the loss of money on companies investing in harvesting lumber already.  Switching from the steady basis to a hemp basis would slam the economy into the ground worse than it already is.  The excuse about marijuana being a harmful drug is false and convenient for the government.

Both are mind-altering drugs which affect judgment.  No doubt many babies have been conceived, many have sold their bodies, many have taken lives for the sake of alcohol and pot.  Yes 1 is legal and 1 is not.  Alcohol is recognized by the human body as a poison which the liver tries to filter out resulting in liver damage, brain damage, heart damage [enlarged and more],  fetal damage, stomach and esophageal problems even unto death.

yQNit56Qaa	Here's the official Roman Catholic teaching on "apostolic succession"<br>  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p123a9p3.htm#IV" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You wrote<br>  And in the above verse, wasnt he talking to his apostles-his TWELVE apostles? Where does it say "and all the future people of this world?"<br>  <br>  Who gives the priest the authority to be an APOSTLE? Where does it say this in the bible that just so long as you are a priest you are an apostle?<br>  <br>  <br>  Just some points:  first, he was speaking to his disciples (the author of John doesn't use the more specific term "apostle"), so we don't really know if it was only the 11 (Judas was dead), the 70 (Luke 10), or whatever.<br>  <br>  Second, and more importantly, there WAS no bible for the first 300 or so years of Christianity.  The teachings of Jesus were passed down orally (as we see in Scripture in the case of Paul and Barnabas and others), and the spirit received at Pentecost was transferred to other Christians by the laying on of hands (mentioned by Paul repeatedly, and by others in Scripture).  Personally, I agree that the simple accession to priesthood does not fill someone with the Holy Spirit and give them the authority to forgive sins.  However, that is most definitely an OPINION.  My point is that just because something is not stated plainly in the bible does not mean that it is a wrong doctrine.  The doctrine of "apostolic succession" is OLDER than the bible.<br>  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01641a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01641a.h...</a><br>  <br>  PERSONALLY, I feel that only an *authentic* transference of the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands (by another with the Holy Spirit) might validate "apostolic succession" - and how can we know when the Holy Spirit is actually transferred?  Still, you can't rationally invalidate a Christian doctrine that is older than the bible by saying, "it's not in the bible".  The bible is NOT the complete set of Christian doctrines.  However, I DO believe that the bible contains all of the NECESSARY Christian doctrines.  (I'm a Fundamentalist Christian.)<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.</a> com/selector_rc.html|`|AA11375099	It is what it is.  That simple.  They are told to do what they do and back it up by their bible.  If your bible said you had to find ten virgins over 30 years old with one blue eye and one green eye in order to go to heaven you would wouldn't you.<br>  <br>  If that is what the head of their church says they have to do, then they have to do it.  Or else.<br>  <br>  If you are in service, and the captain says march forward...you do because they are the authority.  That is what the priests are, authority and they back it up by their bible and religious teachings.  which are 100% real.  Just like yours is.<br>  <br>  And everyone else's from every religion in the world.  They are doing what is 100% right.  You are right, they are right, so what's the problem?|`|AA11796124	The Sacrament of Reconciliation is obviously Biblical:<br>  <br>  The Necessity and Practice of Orally Confessing Sins<br>  James 5:16 - James clearly teaches us that we must “confess our sins to one another,” not just privately to God. James 5:16 must be read in the context of James 5:14-15, which is referring to the healing power (both physical and spiritual) of the priests of the Church. Hence, when James says “therefore” in verse 16, he must be referring to the men he was writing about in verses 14 and 15 – these men are the ordained priests of the Church, to whom we must confess our sins.<br>  <br>  Acts 19:18 - many came to orally confess sins and divulge their sinful practices. Oral confession was the practice of the early Church just as it is today. <br>  <br>  Matt. 3:6; Mark 1:5 - again, this shows people confessing their sins before others as an historical practice (here to John the Baptist). <br>  <br>  1 Tim. 6:12 - this verse also refers to the historical practice of confessing both faith and sins in the presence of many witnesses. <br>  <br>  1 John 1:9 - if we confess are sins, God is faithful to us and forgives us and cleanse us. But we must confess our sins to one another. <br>  <br>  Num. 5:7 - this shows the historical practice of publicly confessing sins, and making public restitution. <br>  <br>  2 Sam. 12:14 - even though the sin is forgiven, there is punishment due for the forgiven sin. David is forgiven but his child was still taken (the consequence of his sin). <br>  <br>  Neh. 9:2-3 - the Israelites stood before the assembly and confessed sins publicly and interceded for each other. <br>  <br>  Sir. 4:26 - God tells us not to be ashamed to confess our sins, and not to try to stop the current of a river. Anyone who has experienced the sacrament of reconciliation understands the import of this verse. <br>  <br>  Baruch 1:14 - again, this shows that the people made confession in the house of the Lord, before the assembly. <br>  <br>  1 John 5:16-17; Luke 12:47-48 - there is a distinction between mortal and venial sins. This has been the teaching of the Catholic Church for 2,000 years, but, today, most Protestants no longer agree that there is such a distinction. Mortal sins lead to death and must be absolved in the sacrament of reconciliation. Venial sins do not have to be confessed to a priest, but the pious Catholic practice is to do so in order to advance in our journey to holiness. <br>  <br>  Matt. 5:19 - Jesus teaches that breaking the least of commandments is venial sin (the person is still saved but is least in the kingdom), versus mortal sin (the person is not saved).|`|yDJiiqcsaa	That premise is so feeble - that it was only meant for the 12 apostles. Then why was ANY of His message meant for beyond the lifetime of the apostles ?  That means Christ suffered, died and was raised for that single generation ? That means that all of His directives were simply for that generation ?|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	you really don't want the answers you just want to preach---I just love it when people say they don't want to offend right before they offend.|`|xbw8P3Rsaa	"Why does the Catholic Faith teach that you need to go to a Priest and make confession, the priest is not God, wouldn't it seem more proper to go right to God himself, why the middle man?"<br>  - Because this is what Jesus established.  Besides, the priest is not a middle man, but acts in the person of Christ.  The two becoming one flesh between Christ and his bride the Church is so tight that when the church forgives, it is Christ who is forgiving.  Protestants do not have this tight relationship between God and man anywhere except the bible.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Who gives the priest the authority to be an APOSTLE?"<br>  -His bishop.  The bishops are successors of the apostles and have their authority, which they share with their presbyters (priests).<br>  <br>  Where does it say the succession of the apostles ended?<br>  <br>  <br>  We share in the one mediatorship of christ when we dispense grace, love, preach, pray etc.|`|AA11466759	You do not believe in apostolic succession.<br>  I do.<br>  Simple, eh?<br>  <br>  The next verse you probably want to take a look at is Matt 18:18-20<br>  <br>  re:  1Tim:<br>   One mediator... Christ is the one and only mediator of redemption, who gave himself, as the apostle writes in the following verse. 6 Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times, A redemption for all... He is also the only mediator, who stands in need of no other to recommend his petitions to the Father. But this is not against our seeking the prayers and intercession, as well of the faithful upon earth, as of the saints and angels in heaven, for obtaining mercy, grace, and salvation, through Jesus Christ. As St. Paul himself often desired the help of the prayers of the faithful, without any injury to the mediatorship of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  further to, the very next verse, Paul (who was NOT one of the 12) says this:  7 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle (I say the truth, I lie not), a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth.<br>  <br>  How did Paul become an apostle?|`|mBNQrzVlaa	"What you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also" (2 Tim. 2:2). <br>  <br>  Those faithful men have been ordained by Bishops who were ordained by Bishops..etc until those who were ordained by the Apostles who were ordained by Christ. Why would Christ tell his Apostles something and not mean for them it carry it forth for all generations? Thats like him telling them to go baptize people in everynation then adding "Oh wait, but after you die, forget it, they can't be helped". Through Apostolic succession, the Catholic Church has that direct link to Christ. In Confession, the Priest does no forgive me, Christ does THROUGH the Priest. Only Christ forgives sins, but a Priest does have the power given to him in John.<br>  <br>   "As the Father has sent me, even so I send you. . . . Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained" (John 20:21–23). <br>  <br>  When a Priest is ordained, he receives that Holy Spirt.|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	Christ established One Church [Matth. 16:18; John 10:16] and that She shall never fall and He will be with Her and us until the consummation of the world[Matth. 16:18; 28:20].   We know that Our Lord Jesus gave HIS AUTHORITY to the Apostles [Matth 28: 18-20], The authority of the Apostles did not die with them either, and we know this when we look at: Beginning from the baptism of John, until the day wherein he was taken up from us, one of these must be made a witness with us of his resurrection.   And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. [Acts 1:22-23] ? And as they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Ghost said to them: Separate me Saul and Barnabas, for the work whereunto I have taken them. [Acts 13:2] ? And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.   And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a commandment from him to  Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed. [Acts 17:14-15] ? For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but, It is, was in him. [2 Corinthians 1:19] ? Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.   But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. [2 Timothy 4:11-12]<br>  <br>  A few questions that have been answered by Fr. William J. Cogan:<br>  Did Jesus Christ give anyone the power to forgive sin?<br>  <br>     Yes, to His Apostles on Easter Sunday night.<br>  <br>      "Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained."    (John 20:23)<br>  <br>  What do you have to do to have your sins forgiven?<br>  <br>     You have to be truly sorry for them and confess them to a Catholic priest.<br>  <br>      "He that hideth his sins, shall not prosper:  but he that shall confess, and forsake them, shall obtain mercy."    (Proverbs 28:13)<br>  Did Jesus want His Apostles to hand down this power to others?<br>  <br>     Yes, because He died to save all men from their sins.<br>  <br>      "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, Who will have all men to be saved."    (1 Timothy 2:3-4)<br>  <br>  Does the priests only pray that your sins will be forgiven?<br>  <br>     No, the priest, by the power given him, actually takes the sins off your soul (called "absolution").<br>  <br>      "For what I have pardoned...  I have done it in the person of Christ."    (2 Corinthians 2:10)<br>  Can you be sure that your sins are forgiven in Confession?<br>  <br>     Yes, if you have properly confessed them and are sorry for them.<br>  <br>      "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all iniquity."    (1 John 1:9)<br>  <br>  Take Care and God Bless.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	The Apostles had successors. The authority comes with the office.<br>  <br>  “For it is written in the book of Psalms, `Let his habitation become desolate, and let there be no one to live in it'; and `His office let another take.'” (Acts 1:20)<br>  <br>  >>1 Timothy 2:5<br>  For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men.<<<br>  <br>  And? If you think this contradicts Jesus authorizing the Apostles to forgive sin, then you're putting Paul above Jesus.

dJs8GN3Qaa	Being bisexual myself, I believe we are like normal people.  The only difference is being able to love a man and woman.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't mean loving both at the same time, it simply means we CAN love both.<br>  <br>  Yes, it's your own personal experience, but it might change.  If you're with a bisexual person, he/she can leave you for a guy/girl.  If you're with a lesbian, she can still leave you for a girl.<br>  <br>  It still hurts either way.  But not all bisexuals want to be with both a guy and girl.  We're perfectly capable of having a monogamous relationship.  <br>  I hope you can agree with this someday.|`|N73oZyY8aa	I have no problem with bisexuals unless they have a problem with me. Then I have a problem with the individual.|`|siGX7EWwaa	Being bisexual is not loving a man and a woman at the same time, it's the "ability" to love someone of either gender.

I just wanted to remind you all that NOT that long ago it was common for people to say that it is impossible or not right to be gay! (human nature, not natural or whatever).... so anyone out there who is gay I hope you think about that the next time you open ur mouth to discriminate! and if you do than you no better than those who discriminate gay's .....|`|QdwMhvpCaa	People always tell me that I can't be both.

TjrnVFVRaa	It could be that a restless spirit is trying to contact you for help. Often when a spirit is trying to move on to the next plane of existence they find they have some unfinished business in this world that needs to be taken care of before they can continue on their journey. <br>  <br>  Here is a link that provides a test fo see if your house is "haunted" and then some advice as to what to do if you think it is.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://haunted--houses.com/is-my-house-haunted.htm" rel="nofollow">http://haunted--houses.com/is-my-house-h...</a><br>  <br>  And you have to tell your hubby to cool it! When a spirit manifests, remain calm and banish any fears. Think calm soothing thoughts, the close your eyes. Then open them slowly in the direction of the spirit, and let your mind become blank and receptive to any message the spirit is trying to send. <br>  <br>  If you do get a message, you will know it, it usually is a simple action that the spirits knows you can accomplish easily with no harm to yourself or to others. And maybe you can help this spirit move on to the next step in a wonderful journey!|`|KGz62rW0aa	Sometimes, whenever you are already scared, your mind can play tricks on you.

You've never ever considered the claims of our church because you've been taught that our church is a lie and not to believe it. <br>  <br>  Gift, we have no gift except that of the Holy Ghost (Spirit). You won't listen because you have hardened your heart and your spirt so even if you could have the chance to understand our beliefs through the Holy Ghost, it has left you and in it's place you have invited a hate filled advisarial sprit into your heart instead.

oH0u3RxJaa	Im gonna say more christians turning atheist...I base that on the people I know....and logical thinking. <br>   Think about it like this...<br>  <br>   Are there more people who didnt belive in Santa Claus starting to believe in him?? Or are there more kids who stopped believing in Santa Claus as they mature? Replace Santa Claus with Christianity.<br>  <br>  <br>   BUT there are other factors of course...such as social status, levels of certain emotion, and of course, levels of enlightenment...<br>  <br>  1. Social Status- By this I usually mean that of a country's population. A low status, or "third world" country are full of POOR and DESPERATE people. They are poor and desperate because of their ill-advised choice to waste so much time on religious practices and other stuff, like paying too much taxes to their religious organizations. In the end, the citizens are too poor to do anything about their mediocre wealth and status. These people will look for an EASY (read:stupid) way to solve their problems. Such as...PRAY MORE!! Devote to their religion even more fanatically in hopes that their "god" will "bless" them with more wealth. And thus the cycle continues on...on the other hand...a more HIGHER STATUS country like Japan, is rife with ATHEISM. And they even more steps of progress then countries like America in terms of growth, such as legalizing many forms of pornograpgy originally banned due to RELIGIOUS MORALS, openness to all sexuality, spending less time praying and more time RESEARCHING and EDUCATING. And now look, their an even better country then the West (believe it or not, they have more atheists).<br>  <br>  2. Levels of emotions-read above. In times of ecnomic turmoil, less educated, aka religious people, are prone to finding the easy way out of their problems, such as praying to god for wealth rather then doing something about it.<br>  <br>  3. Levels of enlightenment- I mean this as in...the amount of people in a population who GOT A CLUE. As in they stopped living in a fantasy fairy tale world. And started looking at all aspects of their life more objectively, and start realizing they have been living a lie. Realizing there IS NO GOD, NO HEAVEN, NO WHATEVER. That praying and opposing other people's views because of your beliefs will get you no where but failure.|`|FmazIF6Maa	There are less Christians now than there were even 50 years ago. I think more Christians are turning not just to Atheism, but to other religions.|`|UWKF7x4faa	Yes, thankfully.

It seems foolish.

Even Christians could admit that most people in the country are raised in atleast a pseudo-Christian household. Therefore, a large portion of those who are atheist choose to be so later on.<br>  <br>  I've heard people claim atheist-to-christian conversion on the internet, but I've met many atheists and never seen one in real life.|`|lKBoTN7Vaa	Atheists to Christians ?

wY8jE8HEaa	The Message of Jesus<br>  <br>  “And in their (the prophets’) footsteps, We sent Jesus the son of Mary, affirming the Torah that had come before him.  And We gave him the Gospel, in it was guidance and light, affirming the Torah that had come before it, and a guidance and an admonition for the pious.” (Quran 5:46)<br>  <br>  “O people of the Scripture, do not go to extremes in your religion, and do not say about God except the truth.  The Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, is only a messenger from God and a word from Him (“Be” and it is), which He sent to Mary, and a soul from Him.[3]  So, believe in God and His messengers, and do not say, “Three.” Stop, it is better for you.  Indeed, God is one; exalted is He above having a son.  To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth.  And God is sufficient as a Determiner of all affairs.  Never would the Messiah look down upon being a worshipper of God, nor would the angels who are close (to God).[4]  And whoever looks down upon the worship of God and is arrogant, then He will gather them to Himself all together.” (Quran 4:171-172)<br>  <br>  “This is Jesus, the son of Mary.  And this is the statement of truth, which they doubt.  It is not possible for God to take a son.  Far is He above this! When He decides something, He just says to it, “Be,” and it is.[5]  (Jesus said), ‘And indeed God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him.

When my mom moved out of her house years ago, I came across a Wieboldt's box (do you remember that store?).  Inside were these S&H stamp books.    I used to love looking through the catalog.  Got my first pair of scissors, which I still have!  I think I also got a guitar that way.    Thanks for a great set of memories!|`|0NVy6sLkaa	I sure do! Loved those!

Since the early 2000s, S&H has offered S&H Greenpoints.

Yiou earn 20 Greenpoints for every $1 spent on the S&H's Web site.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	We got a lot of stuff, including furniture, from green stamps.

Everyone was collecting them and saving them and you got them in many stores when you made a purchase. S & H Green Stamps were everywhere. There was a lady who had an appointment to see her OBGYN.  Before leaving her office she made a quick stop by the ladies room and unfortunately there was no tissue available so she reached in her purse and got a Kleenex.  She proceeded to her Doctors appointment and when she got to see the Doctor and he prepared for her annual exam he busted out laughing. This poor lady had a S & H Green Stamp stuck in a very embarrassing spot. Later she figured that the Kleenex tissue that she had used earlier had a stamp on it from her purse and it got transferred to that most embarrassing spot. I bet that that lady still remembers S and H Green Stamps.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	Yes we used to save Gold Bond stamps and  S&H green stamps.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	I loved Green Stamps.  I got so much stuff from them.

Then one summer day I was taking some of my mom's books over to grandma's house.  I was riding my bike down the street and the wind was making them flop around in the basket on the front so I reached up to hold them down.  The next thing I remember was crawling out from under a pickup truck, putting my hand on my head and seeing blood and screaming.  A man came out with a dark green towel and put it on my head.  My brother who was with me rode his bike home to get dad.  We were only half a block from home so he was there quickly.  Then the man and dad took me down to doc's office and he shaved off my hair and put 15 stitches in the top of my head and dad almost passed out.  I went home after that.  The town cop came to visit me the next day as did the doc.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I helped my mother in a stamp redemption store in Phoenix, AZ.,  she managed in 1963.

If he makes the same comment a couple of days later, then pretty much he has no regard for your feeling and does not think that you are worth being taken seriously<br>  <br>  The rest is up to you!

Then there is a sudden flash of Light, an insight into the dark place within us. Now it can be seen. Some will react with depression or sorrow because they think it is something new or feel it is a set back. Yet actually it is a step forward.

By their own evil lives they hide the truth. God shows his anger because  knowledge of him has been made clear to all. Yes, God has shown himself to them all. There are things about him that people cannot see—his eternal power and all the things that make him God. But since the beginning of the world those things have been easy to understand by what God has made. So people have no excuse for the bad things they do. They know God, but they did not give glory to God or thank him. Their thinking is useless. Their foolish minds are filled with darkness. They say they are wise, but they are fools. They trade the glory of God who lives forever for the worship of idols made to look like earthly people, birds, animals, and snakes.<br>     Because they do these things, God left them and lets them go their sinful way, wanting only to do evil. As a result, they are full of sexual sin, using their bodies wrongly with each other. They traded the truth of God for a lie. They worship and serve what has been created instead of  God who created these things, and who should be praised forever. The truth is plain to see!<br>  <br>   26 Because people did those things, God left them and let them do the shameful things they wanted to do. Women stopped having natural sex and started having sex with other women.27 In the same way, men stopped having natural sex and began wanting each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and in their bodies they received the punishment for those wrongs.<br>  <br>   28 People did not think it was important to have a true knowledge of God. So God left them and allowed them to have their own worthless thinking and to do things they should not do.29 They are filled with every kind of sin, evil, selfishness, and hatred. They are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, lying, and thinking the worst about each other. They gossip and say evil things about each other. They hate God. They are rude and conceited and brag about themselves. They invent ways of doing evil. They do not obey their parents. They are foolish, they do not keep their promises, and they show no kindness or mercy to others. They know God's law says that those who live like this should die. But they themselves not only continue to do these evil things, they applaud others who do them.|`|AA10945101	If it is your right to have those beliefs, it is my right to condemn them.  That's the way it works.  We do live in a society where we are free to worship who we please and believe what we want under the constitution of the United States.  That freedom means that as long as we don't forcibly deny that freedom to someone else, then we are also free to disagree with and even condemn others for their beliefs if our beliefs demand it!<br>  <br>  I like the way they put it in the movie "the American President".  I'm paraphrasing here but it went something like this:<br>  <br>  "America isn't easy, America is advanced citizenship.  You have to want it bad because it's going to put up a fight.  You want free speech...then let's see you acknowledge a man whose standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs what you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours."  <br>  <br>  In other words, if you want to enjoy the freedom to believe what you want, you have to acknowledge the rights of others to do the same...if you want to enjoy the freedom to talk about your beliefs then you have to acknowledge the rights of other to do the same!  Deny the rights of even one person to believe or say what they want and you deny your own right to do the same!|`|d9tCS7BPaa	Well for one, most Christians I would call 'level-headed' aren't the ones who condemn others. It is not our place, nor our authority. <br>  <br>  I myself am not like some Christians because I find myself more tolerant of those who choose to explore different paths, only because I did the same myself. And through experience and study I discovered that Christianity was the path for me, and I believe it to be a righteous path.<br>  <br>  I say if you are going to explore other spiritual paths. Explore. But do so for the right reasons. Pursue a path because you feel it rings true to you, and not because it only seems interesting, convenient or trendy. Many people fall into this trap and practice a religion because it fits with their counter-mentality and want something for the sake of being different. And also question each religion as much as you would question Christianity. If you do this, you'll find every religion has it's fallacies. Some more than Christianity.<br>  <br>  So how is it you SEE Satan as an ancient god who was raped of his original name? Is this an idea that you decided to come up with or what? Because religion doesn't really work that way. And what exactly is it that draws you to ancient gods as opposed to the common belief among the major religions of the world that believe in one God?<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Why do you desire to have godlike powers or to become like a god? Ask yourself this deeply and if your intentions are truly just and divine.

Check it out and see if there's another center in your town.<br>  <a href="http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/</a><br>  <br>  Second, you might consider this introductory book. I recommend it because the author is a senior Buddhist teacher and her book captures the warmth, wit, and wisdom of this tradition. Plus it's short. And free of jargon or sectarian bias. <br>  "It's Easier Than You Think" by Sylvia Boorstein<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Its-Easier-Than-You-Think/dp/B000H2MEGY/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1199124299&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Its-Easier-Than-Yo...</a><br>  <br>  Finally, the best online resource for information on Buddhism is Buddhanet.

And for a philosophy that dislikes materialism, I can say that the Buddhist temple in your town is full of a bunch of fakes who don't understand the concept, or are just trying to rip people off. But you don't need to go to a bloody temple to meditate. Just put a mat in your living room and do it there or something. <br>  <br>  If you're young, read "Buddha In Your Backpack." It was great.

He is best known for his punishment of being forced to roll a boulder up a hill for all of eternity. Perhaps his greatest trick was tricking Thanatos, the personification of Death, to demonstrate a set of shackles on himself. Thanatos remained shackled under the care of Sisyphus for a period of time, during which no mortal could die. Ares, the god of war, became upset that his battles would not result in death, and finally rescued Thanatos. Before Sisyphus died, he asked his wife not to perform the sacrifice usually performed in such a situation. Once sent to the underworld, he then complained that his wife was neglecting this duty, and asked for permission to return to ask his wife to perform this duty. He received this permission, but once he came back, he would not return. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, brought Sisyphus back. As a punishment for his trickery, Sisyphus was sent to Tartarus, the worst part of Hades, and condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for all of eternity. The boulder would always roll back down the hill once Sisyphus brought it to the top. The myth of Sisyphus is used as a metaphor for repetitive and useless activities.<br>  <br>  Tantalus was the father of Pelops, whom he cut up and served to the Greek gods at a feast. In punishment, the gods sent him to Tartarus, where he was always up to his waist in water and just out of reach of some delicious-looking grapes. From this myth we get the word tantalizing, and also one of Aesop's Fables. <br>  <br>  <br>  D?mon~~?|`|oqiH3fCCaa	Pretty much any thing in Tartarus.

DfDss68haa	Here is how I see it. If a woman is really going for blood a man (trying to kill him or has a deadly weapon) he should be allowed to fight back to DEFEND himself only. If he goes further than that into retribution or payback he is in the wrong. PERIOD.<br>  He should first try to restrain her, if that doesn't work, knocking her out is allowed. <br>  <br>  But any male who tries to get a woman back by "knocking every tooth out of her mouth" isn't much of a man. Some of the guys answering this question need to reevaluate their life. Kicking someone in the balls isn't right by any means but he doesn't have to defend himself, she hasn't gone crazy and is hitting him over and over or going for the thoat. It WAS A KICK IN THE BALLS not a death threat! Call the cops on her and never see her crazy butt again. That's all there is to it.<br>  <br>  The woman who hit a man should be persecuted to the full extent of the law. But there is no need to escalate the violence or try to give as good as you got. For many reasons.<br>  <br>  1. Violence is never the answer.<br>  2. A man is physically stronger than a woman. Period. <br>  <br>  I can't believe that there are people who can justify the injuries Rihanna sustained. Sickos. I am very sensitive about this. I was playing around with my friends' boyfriend and kicked him in the butt (as a joke) and the dude went crazy and tried to go after me to kick me way harder than I kicked him. To me, that kind of vengeance is a serious sign of a violent personality. Not a surprise, not long into the relationship he started beating on my friend whenever he got drunk. In the end, the worst thing about it is that I am a 5'2'' slight girl and this guy was twice my size. That was really scary. Even if I had kicked him in anger, it's never okay to go after someone who has no way to defend themselves. He had the choice to walk away from a fight with a defenseless person and he didn't take it. That speaks volumes in my book. <br>  <br>  I agree with Dr. Phil. Life isn't fair, suck it up and be the bigger person becuase you ARE the bigger person. With great strength comes great responsibilty. It's never fair to be the person who knows better or has the advantage.  But an eye for an eye just makes the whole world blind. <br>  <br>  EDIT: Somehow you have things confused David. The man who puts his hands on a woman is the p.ussy. <br>  <br>  And to Matrix. I never said that a man has to take an attack from someone who is trying to come out them and do them serious harm. But the minimal amount of  harm required to DEFEND yourself is VASTLY different than what you are suggesting. Going after someone who has no defense against you who has managed to get in a good shot, when there is the choice of walking away (or hobbling away as it were). That is vengeance of the most disgusting kind. How is you knocking all her teeth out going to fix the "damage" she did to you? Is it going to make you feel better to beat up someone who can't fight back? You know what they call men who take out their frustration and anger on defenseless people for ANY reason? Wife beaters. You the big man. That'll teach her. <br>  <br>  I mean none of this matters, I don't hit people in anger or associate with "men" that do (there are always warning signs as I stated above) and I will pray for any woman who crosses their path. God forbid they kick you in the crotch so you can't make more misogynistic violent tendencies like yourself.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	No, but a woman should never lay a hand on her man either.It is a 2 way street.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	I have learned that angry women play for keeps. Meaning if a women is attacking you she is trying to do some damage. This is the only case where it is justified for a man to hit a woman. Other than self defense there is no reason for a man to hit a woman. It goes without saying that a man should never beat a woman up..There is no honor in beating up a woman.|`|283tO9j9aa	Nobody should be hitting anyone else, regardless of gender.<br>  <br>  However, if a woman attacks a man he has every right to defend himself.|`|S6MqrWdjaa	only if she acts up (fuq that) only if she is hitting him....|`|ncdTxID9aa	Bottom line, men are physically stronger, even if some big muscle bound chick or a random athletic girl could land a good punch on a guy, his defense should be restraint or having some one restrain her.  Most incidents where  a man hits a woman, it's over a verbal attack, in which the girl may hit the guy but he completely fights back carelessly and hurts her, instead of restraining(some guys just have these unnecessary egos). No matter how tough a girl thinks she is, if she isn't cautious she could get hurt by a guy.  I don't like these excuses for why a man can hit a woman. Because if women were stronger physically, the same argument would be held against us as well as the same consequences. People who condone men hitting women only care to disagree when the woman is someone they know like their mother, sister, girlfriend etc.|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	Only if she physically provoked him, or tried to pull a Lorena Bobbit on him  Other than that, I don't think guys should hit women for no apparent reason.|`|N6cCc9dOaa	Only to defend himself if she is a demon-she-witch trying to murder him or any one else.|`|FHzAahLOaa	nope, unless it's in defence.  It's not ok to hit anybody|`|48c286b828494072a0a06f4f8f0b74bcaa	I think men and women should be treated equally by the justice system, and yes, I think men should be able to defend themselves and fight back if they are being physically attacked.  <br>  <br>  I saw an episode one time of Dr. Phil in which he told the guests that they should never under any circumstances hit a woman.  It really made me mad because there are times when it may be necessary; I don't recall him saying that women shouldn't hit men, either.  It seems a lot of people don't realize that with gender equality comes responsibility.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	It is never okay for a man to hit a woman, the end. (It's also never okay for a woman to hit a man.) Violence is never an acceptable solution, no matter what the problem is. If a woman is being physically abusive, a man has the right to keep her from hitting him, but it isn't okay for him to hit back - what's that supposed to do, anyway? Either hurt the attacker or just make them angrier. Try to verbally diffuse the situation, and extract yourself and/or call law enforcement officials if she can't calm down.|`|HimBbU6caa	Here is my take on things, and I could care less who disagrees. You don't put your hands on another person if you want to keep your teeth...bottom line. If a woman kicks me in the balls for no reason whatsoever she better be on the other side of Queens by the time I recover. If not, I'm doing my damndest to knock out every tooth in her mouth. If a woman hits me with a pipe or a bat just because I made her angry you mean I have to stand there and take it? i have to hope she doesn't kill me and accept my whipping just because she is a woman? That's bullsh*t! If you want to act like an aggressive male full on testosterone I'm gonna treat you like one.<br>  <br>  I have never hit a woman and i don't plan on it. I never put myself in situations where I am dealing with that type of female.<br>  <br>  Edit: So I guess I have to just sit there and and accept the fact that a woman just tried to deal serious damage to my genital area without any provocation from me? I'm supposed to get up and say "Why did you do that?", not knowing the extent of the damage she may have caused. I'm supposed to just get the crap beat out of me with a foreign object if I can't somehow "restrain" the woman or wrestle it away from her. If that fails I just have to accept life with brain damage, or worse, accept death and the grave.<br>  <br>  Is it fair that a woman can get away with acting in this way? Is this not a double standard? If you kick me in the balls or attack me with a pipe my strength is trumped and you have the advantage. The people here who see my answers know that I love women, but I just do see why I'm supposed to take an accept unwarranted abuse from anyone...male or female.|`|QdwMhvpCaa	Only is self defense. If a woman wants to pick a fight with a guy, then she should be treated as an equal. If I picked a fight with a guy, if I hit him, I'd expect him to hit me back. I'd find it insulting if he didn't. I'd feel as if he though of me as being inferior because I'm a woman. We wanted equality, so we'd better get it, even in a fight.|`|pfke6Jieaa	ok imma give u my honest opinion. its not fair women always say a man isnt supposed to hit a woman while the woman can beat the crap out of a man and its ok. thats a no no in my book. BUT if a woman hits me i would restrain her and tell her to calm down. if she punches me in the face u better believe im gonna be in her face, and if she punches me again then yes i will slap her. im not gonna stand there jus cuz she is a woman. <br>  <br>  a person, no matter what gender they are, need to be put in their place if they act obnoxious. if my gf slaps me cuz i cheated on her i would not do anything, but if she tries to beat the crap out of me im gonna hold her and tell her to stop being an idiot, which i know she wouldnt act like that and im not gonna cheat on her anyway. <br>  <br>  bottom line is that if u want to be respected u need to act respectful towards others. i dont follow this bullcrap of never hit a woman if ur a real man thats not in my book. i wouldnt hit a woman just to be tough yeah i can understand that one. but standing there like a stone while a woman brutally assualts u is not acceptable. a classy woman would not hit a man either. so it goes both ways.<br>  <br>  EDIT: i have had that incident once where a woman was fighting and i broke up the fight and she punched me for no reason, and she is only 5'2 and im a lil more than a foot taller than her so she showed arrogance cuz she knows im bigger than her but yet she still punched me, and i hate ppl like that. <br>  <br>  she ended up pulling a knife on me so i YES i did become violent toward her and i slammed her on the ground and she cried. no one thought of me as a woman beater because they KNEW i was defending my self. unless u think that was wrong of me to do too......|`|Mq9GSSHhaa	Okay, there is never a situation where a man should hit a defenseless woman.

Now he makes people rebel against the Lord, So God has alloted a time for people to repent and return unto Him, He sent the prophets whom they killed, then He sent His Son Christ Jesus, surely He thought they will respect my Son, But The people knowing Christ is being the Son is the heir did away with Him also, But Christ retained certain of his followers who proclaimed the same message, so they killed them also, but each time, they killed the messengers, more people started to believe, until the gospel has gone out to the ends of the earth. So God raised Christ from the dead and He ascended into heaven to give all judgment into His end as He is worthy. Now when the alloted time is up, Christ will come again and take those who believed and believe in Him up with Him, Then God will pour out His wrath on all those who blasphemed His Name.|`|akwVAZcEaa	The term 'hell', in the Bible, simply means 'the grave'.

It may include using sacred names as stress expletives without intention to pray or speak of sacred matters; it is also sometimes defined as language expressing disapproved beliefs, or disbelief.<br>  <br>  Many cultures disapprove of speech or writing which defames the God or gods of their established religions, and these restrictions have the force of law in some countries.<br>  <br>  "Blasphemy" may be used by extension to describe any display of gross irreverence towards any person or thing deemed worthy of exalted esteem. In this broader sense the term is used by Sir Francis Bacon in the Advancement of Learning, when he speaks of "blasphemy against learning".<br>  <br>  Sometimes the word "blasphemy" is used loosely to mean any profane language, for example in "With much hammering and blasphemy, the locomotive's replacement spring was finally fitted.".<br>  <br>  The public domain 1913 Webster's Unabridged Dictionary defines blasphemy as:<br>  <br>  Blasphemy (Blas"phe*my) n. [L. blasphemia, Gr. : cf. OF. blasphemie.] <br>  An indignity offered to God in words, writing, or signs; impiously irreverent words or signs addressed to, or used in reference to, God; speaking evil of God; also, the act of claiming the attributes or prerogatives of deity. When used generally in statutes or at common law, blasphemy is the use of irreverent words or signs in reference to the Supreme Being in such a way as to produce scandal or provoke violence. <br>  Figuratively, of things held in high honor: Calumny; abuse; vilification. <br>  <br>  [edit] Etymology<br>  The word "blasphemy" came via Middle English blasfemen and Old French blasfemer and Late Latin blasphemare from Greek βλασφημ?ω, from βλ?πτω = "I injure" and φ?μη = "reputation". From blasphemare also came Old French blasmer, from which English "blame" came.<br>  <br>  Compare "euphemy", which is a little-used word meaning "describing something as better than it is", as in euphemism.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Blasphemy laws<br>  There has been a recent tendency in Western countries towards the repeal or reform of blasphemy laws, and these laws are only infrequently enforced where they exist.<br>  <br>  Other terms for blasphemy are blasphemous libel, defamation of religion, vilification of religion, and religious vilification.<br>  <br>  Blasphemy laws exist in these countries:<br>  <br>  This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.<br>  <br>  [edit] Australia<br>  <br>  [edit] The Commonwealth of Australia<br>  The Commonwealth does not recognize blasphemy as an offence. In 1991, the Australian Law Reform Commission proposed the removal of all references to blasphemy in federal legislation.[1] All that remains as a law against blasphemy is a prohibition against the registration of a ship which has a blasphemous name.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Tasmania<br>  The Tasmanian Criminal Code makes blasphemous libel a crime but leaves its definition to common law.<br>  <br>  A person who is aggrieved because aspersions are cast upon his religious belief or affiliation or religious activity does not need to file a complaint under the Criminal Code. He can seek redress under the Anti-Discrimination Act (1998).<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] New South Wales<br>  Criminal law in New South Wales is currently governed by the Crimes Act 1900. The Act names blasphemous libel as an offence, but leaves the definition of blasphemy to the common law. The Defamation Act 1974 makes reference to the offence.[2]<br>  <br>  The last successful prosecution for blasphemous libel in New South Wales took place in 1871. The case was R. v. William Lorando Jones (unreported, Parramatta Quarter Sessions, Simpson J., February 18, 1871). In that case, the elderly Mr. Jones was found guilty for saying that the Old Testament was immoral and unsuitable for a female readership. The Court sentenced Mr. Jones to a fine of ￡100 and two years in jail. A public outcry over the sentence resulted in the release of Mr. Jones four weeks later.[3]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Queensland<br>  Queensland's Criminal Code Act of 1899 abolished blasphemy by repealing the Blasphemy Act of 1697. The Objectionable Literature Act of 1954 allows the state to prevent the distribution of literature which is blasphemous.<br>  <br>  A person who is aggrieved because aspersions are cast upon his religious belief or affiliation or religious activity can seek redress under the Anti-Discrimination Act (1991).<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Western Australia<br>  The Criminal Code Compilation Act of 1913 abolished blasphemy by repealing the Blasphemy Act of 1697.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Victoria<br>  It is unknown whether blasphemy is a crime in Victoria where it might yet exist under common law.<br>  <br>  The Crown last laid a charge of blasphemous libel in 1919. The case concerned journalist Robert Ross, who had published a satirical piece in which Bolsheviks ransack heaven. The prosecutor dropped the charge, but proceeded on a charge of sending blasphemous materials through the mail. The Court convicted Ross, and sentenced him to six months of hard labour.[3]<br>  <br>  A person who is aggrieved because someone is|`|5Yh8WN1Oaa	If you look in the original Greek of the word "blasphemy", it means "to slander."<br>  <br>  So, in order to "blaspheme the Holy Spirit," we would slander Him, such as attributing the works of Satan to the work of the Holy Spirit.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	to reject salvation and ignore the calling of the holy spirit to repent and be saved|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Something religious people made up.|`|0fd6c9cd983b835b83ca7be549d67540aa	giving credit to satan the things that is of God.|`|lMmhkeZ0aa	an antiquated legal doctrine|`|82AAOxCfaa	to deny God

The measure corrupted our state constitution to take a civil right away from millions of law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Californians.

iWOjZcbLaa	lol there r a lot of ways, latin is an adj so u need to decline it, it's so complicated    i'd like to tell u "latinus-a-um" but i think i need to explain a little bit, if the noun that "latin" support come from the 2nd declination (-us) u want to use "latin-us" that u have to decline, same for the 1st declination (-a) for example    1st declination  the latin language: lingua latina  of the latin language: linguae latinae  at the latin language: linguae latinae  the latin language (obj): linguam latinam  o latin language: lingua latina  (all the others) latin language: linguae latinae    if it the noun is neuter (-um) so latin will follow the rules of the neuter noun    so singolar 1st     plural  -a                        -ae  -ae                      -arum  -ae                      -a   -am                     -as  -a                        -ae  -ae                      -abum    singolar 2nd                plural  -us                             -i  -i                                -orum   -e                               -i  -um                            -os  -e                               -i  -i                                -obum    singolar neuter (1st-nd)           plural  -um                                      -a  -a                                         -orum  -i                                          -i  -um                                      -os  -a                                         -i  -a                                         -obum      obviously they has masculine, feminine, and neuter on the adjective too, so the declination for -us is masculine -a is female and -um neutral  so sometimes u can c the noun masculine that follow the rules of the 1st declination (the vocabulary will tell u if it is masculine or feminine) and the adjective that follow the rules of the 2nd declination (bc the noun is masculine) hope to be as clear as possible...|`|yAvTxh47aa	Well, it depends on the case (and words around it), but Latina.

HOQp0gA7aa	This would be culturally dependent.  For example, in many middle eastern cultures and african cultures the left hand is used for "toilet" activities in societies with inadequate hand washing facilities.  Thus it is considered extremely rude to touch someone else or eat with your left hand since that is the same hand you use to remove excess waste from your posterior.      Otherwise some ancient Christian traditions hold that left handed people are being influenced by Satan as the right hand is Holy and Satan can not influence it as readily as the left.      I hope this helps.|`|rcCYssKYaa	They are evil and probably possessed by a demon.    Seriously, that's what they used to think.  Different=Evil/Bad.  Since most people are right handed, left handedness was considered a sign of the Devil.  In Catholic schools, "lefties" were forced to learn to write with their right hand.  If they were caught using their left, they got the ruler across the knuckles.  This was done more recently than you might think!|`|AA11513482	That they tend to be artist.|`|AA12131133	it has to do with the devil. the word for left in italian is "sinistra".  from this you can derive the word "sinister" which has to do with the devil. pure superstition, no basis in fact.  so if you were left-handed you were supposedly possessed by the devil, or at least the devil was influencing you.  pure bull.|`|QqOUVukfaa	that its evil
HFlytHlRaa	I think it depends on how friendly they are. Sometimes I get delivery men who don't even bother speaking when they deliver - they just shove the bag at me and leave.   They don't get a tip.    Someone who says "Hello" and is friendly will get a tip.    However, I will tip if the weather is bad as in Manhattan, almost all delivery men ride bikes or walk to the location. I'm sure it can be heckish making deliveries in a snowstorm, so despite their demeanor, I will tip generously in poor weather.     I usually give $2 - $5.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	I tip 15-20% just because someone had to cook my food and I know restaurant workers split their tips at the end of the night.  I worked as a waiter and know I could not have been able to live on just what I was paid, my tips made a huge difference to me.|`|JgTNtT9Uaa	I used to deliver take aways, not everyone tips, and that's their choice, but it does prop up very poor wages.  I personally tend to round it up to the next pound so they don't have to look for change.|`|qKY3GZEJaa	2|`|7JifOuGCaa	we normally round the money off so he keeps the loose change, our chinky normally comes to something like 13.90, we give him 15, he keeps the change lol|`|rThIVk2maa	Yes, 15-20% of the total bill goes as a tip to people whose income is dependent upon tipping.|`|GI27dKIkaa	It's entirely up to you whether you tip or not !    Personally - I don't usually bother - except around Xmas - as they usually appreciate the extra around that time.    I usually tip my local Chinese restaurant - as I LOVE chinese food !|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Definitely tip. They reimburse the delivery drivers for fuel and mileage and pay them a small hourly wage. Most of what they make comes from your tips. I give at least a five if they're delivering to me.    If I order take-out from a restaurant and pick it up myself, I tip one dollar per box. I used to be a waitress and trust me, the employee that's assigned to take-out is not getting a higher hourly wage than the employees waiting tables, but they're making much, much less in tips.    Wow, so many bad tippers on this site!! You've gotta give more than a dollar and some change. They've got bills to pay too!|`|9nymzoOXaa	like 3 or 4 bucks.|`|47FsMLlwaa	I tip 15% for take away, if it is delivered to my car. If I go into the restaurant to pick it up myself, I don't tip unless there is a tip jar. If there is a tip jar, then I'll put in $1-2 dollars depending on service.|`|QBnhsYs1aa	One needs to consider where in the world you are. There are many countries where tipping is the norm & expected. Whilst here in the UK it is not common place. In fact many Brits find the whole process quite scary. So please forgive us if we travel to your country and forget to tip. But to answer the question. On the rare occasions I order food to be delivered I usually round up the bill, even if I have been charged a delivery fee.|`|z2KlGvMEaa	......|`|GxV4jGKMaa	Always tip the driver.  This is how they make their money.  If you don't want to tip, then go pick it up yourself.|`|f787da25adf88f5c9415340618993e18aa	I normally tip a 1 plus any spare change.    i.e 18.50 i would give 20    unless it was a small amount, then...    4.60 i would give 5.|`|WXExyAlWaa	I very rarely get fastfood, but if I ordered delivery I would always tip. They are doing an extra service. I think 15% is probably a good amount, but anywhere from 10-20 would be fair.
kgUzdfqVaa	Ask her what she feels comfortable with!   She may even want to wear the dress - a wedding is a pretty crazy day for attire after all as no one really wears what they normally would.  And if not a dress, then maybe a nice tailored suit which matches the colour scheme (but doesn't look like the bloke's dress code).|`|N73oZyY8aa	A colored tux.|`|jFESUkWBaa	I think you should talk to her about it. Maybe she could just wear a nice pants suit, or a tux if she wants. I would also suggest she wear white gloves so the outfit pops out slightly.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Check directly with her, and see what she wants to do. It is your wedding, so you decide on details, but her input would be valuable in making sure she is comfortable.    And congratulations on your wedding!|`|L1dUGkuQaa	Talk to her about it.

AA11693263	First of all you need to contact the police and let them know what happened and what is going on. Give them any information about him. Get a restraining order on him if you have to. You need to change you phone numbers and any contact information he has of yours. Let your family and friends know what is going on and what he looks like so they can help watch out for you. It would just be a good idea to be aware of your surroundings and to be cautious for now. But be sure to contact the police as soon as possible and save any texts that you receive from him as evidence to get a restraining order if you or the police feel you need one.|`|zguucR8yaa	Change your phone number. Notify the police. Do you know where he lives? His name, where he works? The police may be able to track him by his phone #. You may need to file a restraining order.

If you see this guy near your place, or near you, don't be afraid to call the police. <br>  Remember, it was nice of him to return the purse, but that DOES NOT give him the right to keep bothering you. You should not have to deal with this kind of situation, and you DO NOT OWE him anything. <br>  Also, I would avoid being by yourself for at least a month.

They want equal pay but they want chivalry. All people are selfish and arrogant in some ways. More so in America is this the case than in other cultures.

And you could argue that in many ways, even in modern cultures women are not regarded as equals to men, but it is this thinking that sets us back even further. It's a futile argument that you can't and shouldn't try to win. You can try to explain it to people, but they've already made up their minds and have their own opinions. The best thing you can do is smile and nod and try to avoid women that think this way. They will end up old and lonely and wonder what it was that they did wrong.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	your generalizing....

There's a certain amount of hidden and deep belief of racial superiority among Caucasians -- a view incidentally also held by most Japanese.  I think this stems from a subconscious pride (not hecessarily the healthy kind) of 'racial purity'.<br>  <br>  I was unaware of this side of myself, and actually considered myself to be prejudice-free. That is, until some years ago I had a talk with a close woman friend of mine (also White) who always had African boyfriends.<br>  <br>  I asked her why she always chose men of another race.  Her reply: "If you were in a serious car accident and needed a transfusion.  Would you ask whether the person whose blood you were given was black?"<br>  <br>  That opened my eyes.  Still, I have to say, too, that there is a lot of tribalism here in the United States and elsewhere these days -- more even than in the racially segregated 50's Memphis,TN where I lived as a boy.  This tribalism expresses itself in so many ways in our modern society -- to be sure along many other lines as well as the racial one.  But the race card is often played, and very often it takes the form of reverse discrimination, and a feeling of entitlement among "minorities" -- particularly when they are in groups.  <br>  <br>  As Andy Rooney pointed out one night, I wonder if our "PC" pretentions would be so comfortable with, say a "White Entertainment Network", or a magazine called "Cloud"?  What would make me more comfortable -- and something that may well take place during the Obama Presidency, is a desire for young people of color to cast as their heroes something else than 'gangstas an' hos' (even among athletes!), and a return to the word "equal" actually meaning "equal" and not imply the expectation of special privileges.<br>  <br>  Got off on a tangent there, I guess.  So I'll just say I'm proud to be White, but try to act every day in a way that shows that pride doesn't let me go first, and I look for others to give me the same consideration.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Umm I am a nonhispanic white of all european heritage and I am happy the way I am.I wouldn't want to be anyone else.I am extremely proud to be German, Norweigan, French and Irish.Those are like the coolest ethnic groups IMO.<br>  <br>  Edit:Ppl do mistake me for latina or italian though.|`|ry2XcFm6aa	I'm Filipino...I don't really know if I'd consider myself mixed since I don't know much about my background only thing I know is my great granma is mixed chinese dunno if it counts..anyways I think it's cool being Fili since alot are mixed already & our looks can vary we're not just one ethnicity (180 ethnic groups plus mixed breeds - country in asia that has the highest eurasian population.). and yes I'm dam proud to be Fili...I don't think I would want to be something else....|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	I am proud to be bi-racial.

If we look at the history of democide (which includes genocide, politicide, and mass murder, but not war-dead) prior to the 20th century, we find that millions of people were killed by people groups who wanted the other people groups eliminated. <br>  <br>  Jesus Himself addressed the issue of "Christians," performing evil deeds in a rather chilling prophecy:<br>  <br>  "Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.'" (Matthew 7:22-23)|`|LQQAQDkIaa	The Jews say the word kill should have been murder. Big difference. War is not murder, regardless of current mindset. Christians have not been involved in religious warfare since the crusades. Those wars were a response to Islamic Jihad. They invaded Europe in 732AD. The world wars were not over religion, those don't count as Christian wars, just because Christians fought in them. The communists killing so many were anti God and anti religion. Those also don't count as Christian wars. Research some of the pre Christian conquests by some of the pagan empires. Pax Christi
3qqvFEsHaa	Muslims believe that the Quran is the final revelation from God<br>  What that Christian pastor told you is wrong<br>  <br>  Muslims very much believe the Quran is the word of the creator of the universe<br>  <br>  And the Quran wasnt written by one man I dont think, it was revealed to Muhammad, but he didnt write it.<br>  <br>  Christians dont know very much about Islam, I wouldnt trust their word on the subject|`|ZoPln7vaaa	We believe that JESUS is a GOD who came into this world as a Man but Muslims see JESUS just as a Prophet and they don't believe that HE died for us and in remission of sins.|`|8OeulLkmaa	Islam is totally different from judaism or christianity.  The differences are substantial and the quaran and the bible cannot be compared.  <br>  <br>  The quaran is relatively new, only about 200 years old.   The bible is 1000's of years old.  <br>  Muslims try to convert christians by saying we all have the same God but if you read the bible and then the quaran you will see that God does not have multiple personalities.  He means what he says and there is no variance or shadow of turning.  The quaran opposes the bible on every front.<br>  <br>  Christianity came from judaism.  Christianity does not change the old testament to make it back up the new testament.  Christians believe they are both true but God came through the law in the old testament and through mercy and truth in the new testament.  <br>  <br>  The BIG BIG BIG differences between a muslim and a christian is their stance on the jews.  Muhammed rewrote some of the bible and claimed it was given to him by Gabriel, a biblical angel.  But no one else recieved this "revelation" to confirm it was from God.  This is how a cult is born.<br>  <br>  The bible says out of the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established.  That's why there are 4 gospels.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	That Christian pastor is a liar. Islam is the last and final revelation of God Almighty. Quran was not written by Muhammad but it was revealed to him by God Almighty. Arch Angel Gabriel brought Quran to him from time to time as need arose.. It was completed in 23 years.<br>  It provided instructions for peace, war, family life, business, right of parents and spouses etc. It is book of life which gives you instructions for the whole life. And it is not a part time religion either. In Christianity all you do is go to church on Sundays. But Islam teaches you to pray 5 times a day. It has made it necessary for you to earmark a part of your income for the welfare of the destitute.<br>  <br>   Islam is a way of life and not the collection of some traditions.<br>  <br>                                    Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|FDaBYExwaa	Muhammad did not write it but an angel who was sent by Allah, to tell him he is the last prophet and he needs to spread/preach Islam to others.

And then I read the HADITH.... if that's what god wants? They can keep it.

So that was how the Koran was become a book after all.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|rHqe7oMoaa	Although the Quran wasn't written down by Muhammad, it was revealed by him over 23 years (via situational revelation). The Revelations only stopped because he died.  The Quran is mostly plageurised Bible and Jewish folklore with a bit of paganism thrown in and of course the fulfillment of Muhammad's wishes/desires. <br>  <br>  The bible has contradictions, although I wouldn't expect your pastor to admit this to you. <br>  <br>  Muhammad never admitted he wasn't inspired by God. There was that "Satanic verses" incident where Muhammad recieved a few verses of Revelation from Satan, but no, Muhammad did not say he was not inspired by God. <br>  <br>  Most of Muhammad's revelations came by way of a clanging bell in his head (from the ahadith) or from a being whom his cousin (Waraqa bin naful) told Muhammad was the angel Gabriel.<br>  <br>  Agreed though; don't get your information on Islam from Christians because they don't really know that much and their claims are easy to demolish.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	The difference is this: Christians belief that Jesus is the Word of God. In his life, death and ressurrection he is all that God has to say to the world . He is God's final message to humanity in his own person. The Christian Bible is but a witness to Christ who first and foremost is the Word of God.<br>  <br>  In Islam, the Qu'ran, the book is the word of God - it is the literal, eternal words of god forever. <br>  <br>  So in Christianity, it is Christ who is eternal. The book is historically conditioned. It is word of God in as much as it is witness to the saving power of God in human history which culminates in Christ. But the Word of God is Christ. Therefore the bible is subject to historical interpretation. But the eternal Word of Christ, he does not change.

It probably is responsible for more directly and indirectly affected deaths than most other issues.  It definitely affects all other aspects of life like quality of life, span of life, economic impact, and morality issues.  <br>      Now to answer the immediate question you have.  I think if morality alone was addressed and resolved, many of these types of issues would not exist.  A bigger problem is that "everyone" on top is being paid off.  If they are caught by border patrol, many of these guys are being paid off .  As well as Police enforcement and some areas in the Judicial system.  Problem is, by the time these people are caught, the damage is already done.  That's why I have chosen "morality" and "morals."

ljzb6fZBaa	This reminds me of 1 John 1:5 "This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all." <br>  <br>  So we know that God is light and in Him there is no darkness, and He is our Father in heaven! This tells us that we can only expect good things from Him - our heavenly Father does not give us bad things like sickness, accidents, addictions to harmful substances, etc - these are results of Adam's disobedience in the garden of Eden. Instead, our heavenly Father has given us Jesus His beloved Son. And if God has given up for us all His darling Son, heaven's best, how will He not with Him also freely give us all the rest? (Romans 8:32) :)<br>  <br>  So I believe James wanted us to know in a similar vein that "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning." (James 1:17)<br>  <br>  The preceding verses in James 1 told us that temptations is not from God - "God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone" (verse 13), and therefore sinful desires and harmful addictions are not from God. These are not the "good and perfect gifts" that came from above. :) Our Father in heaven is a good and perfect God, and He is more than willing to give us good gifts - things that pertain to life and godliness - if only we would ask Him, as Jesus said, "If you then being evil know how to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!" (Matthew 7:11)<br>  <br>  The good news is that in Christ, God has already blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places. (Ephesians 1:3) And His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue." (2 Peter 1:3) These things would be the good and perfect gifts from God, such as salvation - encompassing health, wholeness, peace, joy, deliverance, prosperity, protection, preservation, blessed relationships with people, as well as intimacy with God.<br>  <br>  God our Father is also described as the "Father of lights" because He is righteous and holy. "Righteousness" and "light" can be seen as synonymous in the Bible. For example, we know that Jesus, who is God in human flesh, identified Himself as the "Light of the world". He was transfigured on a high mountain, and His clothes became dazzling white. I believe it was a picture of His robe of righteousness displayed in full glory. <br>  <br>  In Psalm 27:1, we see that "the Lord is my light and my salvation". In Isaiah 61:10, we see that God has clothed us with "garments of salvation" and "robe of righteousness". Just as "righteousness and salvation" goes hand in hand in the new covenant of grace, we see that "light and salvation" also goes hand in hand, mentioned in other places in the Bible. So God's light is a symbol of God's righteousness. :)<br>  <br>  Hence, James 1 continued to say "So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God." (verses 19-20) <br>  <br>  God's word is also described as a lamp and a light. "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." (Psalm 119:105) So if we want to know God's will concerning what is good for us, we need to refer to His word in the Bible. We see in the synoptic gospels that Jesus is the will of God in action - what He approves of and what He doesn't approve of during His ministry on earth to minister grace and truth to the people, dispensing healing and help to the lost and needy, as well as correcting and rebuking the self-righteous religious leaders of His days. We behold Jesus' glory as we see His meekness and majesty, His righteousness and mercy, His beauty and excellencies, and we can't help but be transformed into His same image from glory to glory. (2 Corinthians 3:18)<br>  <br>  "Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures." James 1:18<br>  <br>  We are indeed blessed to receive every good and perfect gift from above, from the Father of lights, who has our best interests at heart. His word promises us that "if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him." (1 John 5:14-15) God is our Abba Father, whom the Holy Spirit testifies to our spirits, and we can come into His presence anytime just like little children, knowing we are accepted in the Beloved. (Romans 8:15-16, Ephesians 1:6)<br>  <br>  Thanks for the question. I am blessed sharing this, and may His grace be with you too, sister Sandy. :)|`|Nv3eQenUaa	Here is the full quote:   Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. (KJV)<br>  <br>  What it means is that is God's truth is an absolute truth.   It is not the relative truth of man.    You can count on this truth.  It has no shadow or gray areas.  There is no doubt or wavering.   It is always consistent and never varies no matter what angle it is viewed from.    And because it is the only true and absolute truth it is the father or one source of all lights.    The gift of his light comes and splashes us from above. For those who are awash in that light the gifts that God chooses to bestow on us are good and perfect ones.    Those are the only one he grants.  He bestows them only at the right time and when we are perfectly ready.   That is why we must never give up on expecting answers to prayers that are all according to God's will.   He is waiting for that perfect time, moment, opportunity and character development  when His instruction and His will combine to allow you both to receive and see this (light) good and perfect gift.|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	Jesus is the light of the world and we who are born again in Christ are also lights of the world for as He is so are we in this world (1 John 4:17).  We are lights.  God is our Father. Therefore God is the Father of lights.  God is eternally consistent and unchanging therefore there is no variation or shadow of turning from Him.  God bless you.|`|cetqJFuBaa	1. Look up Ian McCormack, A Glimpse of Eternity<br>    a. There are many NDE's that say that God is light<br>  2. There is a picture in Revelation that says that God gives light to the New Jerusalem.<br>  3. Jesus talked about darkness too, many times.  Darkness is said to be where people do things in secret.  He says to walk in the light.  Expose yourself.  Let your light shine so that they may see your good deed and praise your Father.<br>  <br>  It's an interesting thing to think about.|`|G2OdDlmjaa	father of lights as in holy people and he dosnt cast a shadow cause he is so bright he is so holy he is just light|`|OdovbvSYaa	maybe he did all his house up in christmas lights<br>  <br>  gods pure light all right...well it rhymes with light at any rate|`|ce26AOVzaa	it means his gifts bring joy to you.

Getting all upset because someone else has a slightly different view than you seems petty.<br>  <br>  If you look at the thing from the other direction, the answer will show itself.  I don't think the distinction is in the UK vs. USA, so I'll ignore it.<br>  <br>  We were created with a purpose.  That purpose is tied into relationship.  That relationship starts now and is eternal.  Dinner never tasted as good as when you were hungry for it.<br>  <br>  God could show Himself to everyone, but He doesn't.  I think the reason for that is twofold.  One is that He wants to give us a choice.  If He showed us Himself and everything He knows, we couldn't possibly have a choice.  He gives us just enough in every area so that it's not easy.  He wants to be chosen.  The other reason is tied into what I'm doing with you now.  I get to take part in the ceremony of conversion.  It's wonderful for me, even if it isn't so much for you.<br>  <br>  So the reason your friend wants to see you come to religion is partly because he's commissioned to (by Jesus, Mo, or whoever, or by others in his faith, or by his own convictions).  He may want you converted because he believes there's a consequence, and you're in danger.  If you know a house is about to fall off a cliff, and the person next to you isn't willing to place himself on firmer ground, you might become a little desperate.<br>  <br>  I understand that you don't understand why someone could be so stupid as to believe in the building on a cliff theory when the building is clearly safe.  There's empirical evidence!  The building has never fallen before.  The structure's underside cannot be examined.  It's clearly not enough evidence to form that conclusion!<br>  <br>  Fine.  At least now you know a few of the motivations behind those in the USA that take religion seriously.  You can pity the foo.

AA10221696	There are different types of men in every culture. I think the best way to any person is to look at understand the hierarchy of their family structure, how that person was raised and taught to see in a woman. A lot of times if they respect their mothers, respect their sisters and you know how the father in the family conducts himself is a good indicator as to how someone has learned how to treat a woman. It easy to fall in love with the culture, to be intrigued by the charm, but believe me there is nothing romantic about watching a lamb being sacrificed in front of you, and you crying and everyone saying whats the big deal-because they grew up with it and are used to it. Or dealing with family meddling which is very common in the middle east. Or living in an area where there is high chauvinism from others who are not so sensitive. Laws to protect women from the environment are still weak, cat calls are uncomfortable and common. There are other things to consider. In any relationship people say things they don't really mean, or they mean right then but then life gets in the way and their values come out. You should watch how they handle situations that mean a lot to you, like how they treat animals, children, other women. Are they secretive with their money etc.<br>  <br>  I believe that Lebanon, has its roots in Arab culture. But they had the opportunity to be very advanced in their business culture and enjoyed western influences. <br>  <br>  I don't think anyone should stereotype anyone from any culture. I grew up in the us but now live in Iran my birthplace. There are some really really great guys here, who really are open minded, but there are also some guys who say they are open minded then when they get married their wives go through a really hard time, it goes back to the way they were raised, how traditional their families, their income status, or how much their religion plays a part. If they are muslim I recommend you read a translated version of the Quran that is available in all bookstore and understand well the difference between Sunni and Shiia Muslims. <br>  <br>  One thing as well if you ever consider marriage with someone in the middle east, it is important to know that the marriage laws differ, I don't know about lebanon, but there are dowries involved, men get custody of children if there is a divorce, and you have to ask for the right to divorce and it be stamped on a legal document. In Iran women do not have the right to divorce unless they ask for it. Meaning you may want a divorce but your husband can say no. Usually you can find english translations of these laws online - "google" Lebanon and Marriage Laws. In Iran they also allow temporary marriages, seegheh. So you must understand all these as well.<br>  <br>  I might suggest that you ask other Lebanese women or organizations about this. You can go on Facebook and "friend" women who are in the lebanese network or there are organizations online for women who are lebanese. Google Lebanon and women. Read all you can.<br>  <br>  Please know that everyone is different in every culture. Even in the US, there are men who are kind and those who are not. The most important thing is that you be able to be who you want to be, and devote your life to those things that help you be that, its your promise to yourself. Romance can die out fast because of conflicts in culture, but it can work. Live life to the fullest. Its worth it.
Y0jKV0EUaa	It is saying God gives natural beauty, not artificial (Make-up).<br>  Make-up describes itself by the word.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	Why are you addressing this question to women of all faiths but then ask us to reconcile something in one religion's holy books?<br>  <br>  At a guess, I'm thinking all the comments about ignoring beauty are probably New Testament, while Job is Old Testament.  The two testaments have some pretty radically different views on a variety of issues.<br>  <br>  As far as personal issues, I don't see every idea of beauty going back to "vanity."  Vanity, to me, is an excess of attention on physical appearance.  If the body is a temple, why wouldn't you keep the temple in good condition?  Putting on a bit of makeup is no more vain, IMHO, than wearing well-fitting clothes.|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	the virtuous woman clothed her household in the very best clothes she could get.  She is clothed in fine linen and purple which was expensive, so she wanted to look attractive for her husband who had total trust in her.  She dressed appropriately not seeking vain attention.  Our bodies are God's temple so we look and present ourselves as such.  I really do see what you mean about scripture and the beautiful daughters.  Why couldn't they be beautiful just on the inside?  The Christian beauties in pageants bothers me, too.|`|cECRv4NMaa	make up enhances what you have, not necessarily done to be vain, but to look good so as not to embarrass your loved ones. You don't need to cake on the stuff, just apply a light coating. As for beauty, it is in the eyes of the beholder.... <br>  As for the bible, it was written in an age when women were forced to be subservient to men and so men didn't want the women looking better as to attract attention and find out they were more than just beautiful. It is a guideline taken to and beyond extremes!|`|tPoZasqOaa	I like chubby women and women without make-up.

Inside of all of us, even. <br>  <br>  Basically, you shouldn't put an emphasis on beauty. We all are beautiful. <br>  <br>  Some can see it, and others are too blind.|`|6Ao8Bskfaa	Urgh...see now here is one of the biggest problems with people believing in the big book of hoax, it always over complicates things.|`|SL69Pzt3aa	you remember that you are much more than your looks, and so is everyone else.|`|DKWN7VjGaa	I can only answer part of your question. I am a Christian woman and the way I look at make-up, facials, pageants...etc is that God gave me my body to serve as a temple, I am supposed to take care of it. I don't believe in tattoo's or plastic surgery for cosmetic purposes. I believe God made me just the way he wanted me. I think God was referring to doing things to your body that were not intended and being vain. Caring for your body is not vain but parading it around a stage is. I do however think there is absolutely nothing wrong with doing your hair or putting on make-up. To me it is like putting wax on a beautiful wood, you are protecting it and polishing it but you are not changing the wood itself, only caring for it.

We won't all get along ever, because it's just not in human nature, but hopefully the day will come when we stop arguing and belittling each other on the basis of our differences and embrace them as part of our identities instead.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	because when you see signs of progression someone ***** it up. youll know what i mean.|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	I think people sometimes pull the race card as an excuse to get their way. I personally don't even see a difference between whites and blacks...I always thought we were just people. The only time I ever see a difference is usually (I'm not trying to generalize, here) when an African-American says something like, "that white girl over there..." they tend to talk about whites as though we are completely different people. Also, I saw a difference during the election when they would call everyone racist if you weren't voting for Obama...that's not an excuse to act that way. If everyone wants peace and harmony, we should all just learn to live as people and love one another and not recognize differences like those.<br>  <br>  Edit: Lynn, I don't think you read my answer correctly. I stated that we are all human beings and color doesn't make us different. Obviously we are all different in our own ways and that's what makes us beautiful, but different skin colors have nothing to do with the person you are and, like I said, we are all the same-we are people. That has nothing to do with us being different in our own ways.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	I don't know man...but try looking at things with a different point of view. It is really easy to notice when people don't get along b/c it stands out more. But try to notice the little things...like when diff. races do get along. You'd be surprised, it happens more than you think.<br>  <br>  I can speak for myself as a white guy, I have no problem with black people whatsoever. I have a handful of black friends actually who I went to college with. I do have this stigma though, that I sometimes think that black people aren't as likely to like me as a person as much as other races would because I am white. I wish things weren't like that. But hey..you can't look at our president and not say that as a nation we haven't made progress.<br>  <br>  EDIT: @ DAVID, what are all of us 'white people' in denial about?? History? Yes, the black man has been oppressed. We all know this. But honestly it is nothing I feel like I personally should take a blame for. Maybe my father's father's father's father. But not me. So I refuse to live in a constant state of apology. I'm just trying to get along and get by like anyone else. I don't hate people. Why do you?|`|32RPfdSaaa	what kinda question is this, i have enough trouble loving other blacks let alone the race that enslaved and tortured my ancestors for over 400 years and still seem to act as if nothing ever happened like it doesnt still affect us today          and we should just get over it<br>  <br>  edit- observe 'jessica' see so many white people are in denial that its sickening, however im not racist at all,just highly annoyed by some people|`|hc89tLJcaa	I love people because of who they are, regardless of race.

rn7UAtYJaa	Nowhere does the Bible state that the universe was created to be perfect. God Himself called it "good" and "very good," but never "perfect." In fact, God Himself stated that part of the original creation was "not good." The Bible states that the current universe is not perfect, but was designed to be temporary and will be replaced with a perfect universe that will be permanent. Science also tells us that the universe was designed to be temporary.|`|0hQyClksaa	Amputees....no, a doctor cut off the limb, not God.<br>  <br>  Cancer...no, most cancers are due to materials in our environments that cause cell death within our tissues once they enter our bodies.

A cheap jab is what you're more likely after.|`|EYqTV2EYaa	I don't mean to offend you, but I don't think God exists, however, if he does, he doesn't contribute to anything for the present-day. For example, humans reproduce and create their own offspring without the aid of God, and plants reproduces and scatter spores. To reinforce what I said, try picking up an item. Ask yourself, did you need the power of God to do that? I doubt it. Therefore, the power of God is not needed for one to choose to reproduce and.or have sperm cells fertilize an egg cell. It's all in the natural process. Also, we're made of the same material of stars, and the most important star to us, the sun, is the fuel needed to stay alive. Plants feed via photosynthesis, which they use sunlight to make food. Without the sun, we'd all die, and if God is in Heaven, which is in the clouds, Heaven would be destroyed. For more info, visit my question, <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ap9gM5gDh0h0Ev6bvlynKLPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219103502AAspaFc">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> <br>  <br>  As for those illnesses, cancer is an illness characterized by when our own cells multiply too quickly, therefore creating a tumor that damages other parts around the infected area. The cancer cells can also spread to other parts. Therefore, God doesn't create that, it just happens. As for premature births, humans choose to have sex, and therefore, other humans choose when the baby is to be delivered. God doesn't involve that. As for amputations, people decide if they should be done due to another injury or illness, which is either caused by bacterial, your own cells, or viruses. Thus, no powerful being 'created' amputations.' As for the rest, they are all bacteria, which are lifeforms, and like humans, other lifeforms are responsible for creating their own offspring. I believe life originated from the sun and surrounding gases because we're all made from the same material. Therefore, I believe God, if real, has NOTHING to do with it, and Adam and Eve never existed.|`|k7973dtIaa	Did he create newborn babies, food that tastes delicious, summer breezes, laughter, sex, fire, hugs, immune systems to heal bodies that are ill, joy, water, mountains, snow, stars, smiles, and love ?<br>  <br>  My answer to your question is no.<br>  The answer to my question is yes.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	Nope, We can blame evolution... the Common cold is only about 15 genes away from Polio, a few mutations and we have a major epidemic on our hands...|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Yes...he created them.

k03dYskYaa	Bad things can happen if you use spiritism to try to contact an "angel"<br>  The use of divination as a means to “communicate” with angels is not uncommon. One source outrightly encourages its readers to employ rune stones, tarot cards, I?Ching coins, palmistry, and astrology. “Allow your inner knowing self to lead you to the right oracle,” the authors write, “and trust that an angel will meet you there.”<br>  <br>  According to the Bible, however, whatever ‘meets you there’ certainly is not one of God’s angels. Why? Because divination stands in open defiance of God, and true worshipers—in heaven and on earth—have nothing to do with it. Why, in Israel divination was a capital offense! “Everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah,” the Law stated.—Deuteronomy 13:1-5; 18:10-12.<br>  <br>  The Bible says that Satan “keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.” (2?Corinthians 11:14) He can even fabricate portents and then make them come true, deceiving onlookers into thinking that the omen is from God.|`|AA12203324	The word "angel" literally means "messenger".  Angels are first and foremost messengers from God.  They are much less efficient as mesengers TO God.  Attempting to communicate with angels in order to exrct information is not encouraged by the Bible.  It is akin to fortune-telling, and indicates a lack of trust in God's providence.<br>  <br>  As for an "angel oracle kit", the word "kit" should be a clue.  Angels aren't robots you can manipulate with a "kit".  If the one you are talking about is the kind that shows up on this page, <br>  <a href="http://www.carnivalia.com/pendulums.htmhttp://www.carnivalia.com/pendulums.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnivalia.com/pendulums.htmh...</a><br>  then you can see that it is listed just under the "Pentagram oracle kit".  Both are essentually pundulums.  You hold the pendulum over the card, as still as you can, thinking of a yes/no question.  Unconscious hand movements will eventually set the pendulum swinging in one particular direction.  Instead of spending 25 buck, you can do the same thing with string, a washer, paper and pencil.  It's as accurate as a "Magic Eight Ball".|`|nyylb6qUaa	Dear, angels were made by God to be his messangers. In the Old and New Testaments, they brought news, helped fight battles, and did whatever God told them to do. Angels do not communicate with humans unless God tells them to deliver a message to someone. That oracle kit is non sense. Talk to God, he hears you, and will talk back to you, you just have to be still, and know that he is God.

Angels will only bring you love, protection, hope, ect. Angel appear to us in photos, as orbs (or circles of light).

They are most often captured at weddings, family gatherings, and Christmas. Please, dont get into the oracle kits and Quiji boards for they can became a tool for our minds to obsess and worry over the 'messages' we recieve from them.

And frankly, more about sex and homosexuality than they were able to handle from the standpoint of maturity. <br>  <br>  After that, I hope they remember that the separation of church and state is for their benefit - as well as their theoretical tax breaks as a religious institution (if they're going to get involved with politics, they should pay taxes like any other politically active place).<br>  <br>  At the very least, hopefully no one will take Massachusetts law and write it off as how things are done in California.

It's too bad we had one teacher that had the kids go to a wedding as a volunteer trip in the state - it gave them fuel to act like we make kids learn about all types of marriage, and the truth is no school I've ever worked at so much as uttered a word about marriage beyond "So and so was married to so-and-so at the beginning of their presidency in YYYY."|`|AA10637643	We'll fight it to the end.

3BHPJweWaa	i'm not responding to give you any "reasonable explanation why" you "should believe in Christianity".  i seriously doubt that "Jesus Christ" himself believes a large percentage of what Christianity is teaching!  Nor does Mary Magdalene -- or God!  Or the Holy Spirit! <br>  <br>  i *used* to be a Christian (from about age 16 thru 27); but once i realized i no longer really *believed* a lot of that stuff (like much of what's in the Apostle's Creed)  i canceled my membership in the church & have never considered myself a Christian ever since (ie: since about 1969).  <br>  <br>  But hey! -- Jesus wasn't & isn't a Christian, either! <br>  <br>  (But that doesn't mean i don't genuinely *love* the entity many of us call "Jesus Christ" -- nor does it mean i don't have a genuine *relationship* with him! -- contrary to the way most Christians *and* atheists are going to judge me!  And i am *laughing* at this moment.)<br>  <br>  Christianity believes *lots* of things that aren't true -- easily demonstrated by the contradictory beliefs between the different Christian denominations; for how many of them fully believe the others are "going to Hell" for not believing as *their* denomination does?! <br>  <br>  However, there is *definitely* evidence that the person we call "Jesus Christ" actually *existed*.  My youngest son, at 3 years old, would have been able to understand the "proof" i will provide -- requiring *no* faith or belief in the Bible, whatsoever!<br>  <br>  The books Aesop's Fables & Huckleberry Finn & The Odyssey *exist*.<br>  <br>  How did they come into existence?<br>  <br>  A 3 year old child *can* understand that *some* human being had to have *written* them!  Therefore the human being who wrote them *existed*.  The existence of the book *proves* the existence of some writer thereof.  <br>  <br>  There are *parables* in the 4 gospels that are attributed to "Jesus".  There are further parables in the Gospel According to Thomas that are also attributed to "Jesus".  They have a unique style -- just as do the poems of e. e. cummings.  *Some* human being created those parables as a means of teaching, illustrating certain lessons.<br>  <br>  To the human being who created & taught thru those parables we give the name "Jesus".<br>  <br>  HOWEVER -- "Jesus" was, most certainly, *not* the Name he went by -- whenever those parables were created.  Afterall, the letter "J" didn't even *exist* (from what i've read by scholars upon this) until the 1500's!  <br>  <br>  We are told by scholars that the closest approximation to his Name, in the Aramaic that he spoke, was "Yeshua".  Islam says his Name was "Isa".  <br>  <br>  Yes... there is absolutely *no* real evidence than *any* individual actually named "Jesus" existed at that time; but the person we're referring to with the syllabic concatenation most definitely *did* exist -- as the creator of those parables.<br>  <br>  Beyond the simple fact of his *existence* there is nothing totally concrete that can *really* be proven.  It's *all* human testimony -- which may be true, and may *not* be true (or may be partially true).  There are testimonies attributed to people claimed to be contemporaries of Jesus unto testimonies, today, as to people's personal experiences of Jesus.  (i could give testimonies of that nature, myself.  You better *believe* that *i* believe the experiences that actually happened to me -- & i'll think anyone who denies they happened to me to be a presumptuously ignorant, unknowing *idiot*!) <br>  <br>  You believe 'em or *not*! -- just as you believe people's testimonies about experiencing ghosts, flying saucers, alien visitations, near death experiences & all manner of other things -- including ESP.<br>  <br>  There *is* Good Reason to doubt a lot of the stories told about Jesus.  Walking on water...  reanimating a corpse (necromancy!)... being the "only begotten Son of God" born of a "virgin" mother (with the connotations we mean with that word "virgin" now -- rather than simply a "young maiden") -- well, it could be seen as requiring the *gullibility* & naivete of a 3 year old (who sincerely believes in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny & the Tooth Fairy) for adults to *seriously* believe some of *that* stuff!  But "Jesus" *is* said to have taught, "You must become as a child again to enter the Kingdom of Heaven." <smile><br>  <br>  & the insane "blood atonement" theology & "Jesus" being the *only* way to God -- those things *should* be doubted.  Jesus, himself, doesn't believe *that* stuff.  As a result, *most* Christians will *reject* the real Jesus who tells them their theology & mythology about him is *false*!  The "blood atonement" & "only way to God" are Christian theological *delusions* -- created thru the misunderstandings of Paul and "John" -- & falsely apotheosized by mistaken men as being "the Word of God".|`|0hQyClksaa	True faith is based upon facts...it may begin as blind faith, but it eventually gives way to evidential faith.<br>  <br>  I don't know where you get this idea that there is no evidence for the historical Jesus...except by listening to Gnostic teachings, but there is plenty of evidence that He walked the earth and that everything written of Him in the Gospels is 100% true.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a reason to not believe...then just bite your lip and say you don't want to believe.

Those earliest Christians knew Jesus before and after He was crucified.  Many of them wrote down what they knew.  For telling what they knew, many were tortured and even crucified themselves.   They could have avoided such pain by just admitting it was all a hoax or a joke.   They accepted death rather than deny the Christian Truth.  To me, that is very substantial evidence that they were telling the Truth.   <br>  <br>  If you deny the Bible by saying it's all unreliable, you are again being unreasonable.  Scholars - some who were severe skeptics,  have shown very clearly that the Bible available to us today is a reliable record of what was originally written nearly 2000 years ago.  Read the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,  and the Acts of the Apostles.

I had no faith, and frankly didn't want to be fooled. I believed in God with all my heart, no lack of faith there, but couldn't quite make myself trust that man had not perverted the Bible to an unrecognizable degree through the centuries. Faith came when I realized that the will of God is an absolute and if the will of God was for the Bible to serve as an owners manual to life, then his will would not permit the altering of his word. having gained trust in the Bible I then had to simply read what God had to say about Jesus. I began to pray for faith as the bible instructed and found it little by little. On my journey to faith I found these two books invaluable.

Stanton writes, "Today nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically. There is general agreement that, with the possible exception of Paul, we know far more about Jesus of Nazareth than about any first- or second century Jewish or pagan religious teacher."[8] James Charlesworth writes "No reputable scholar today questions that a Jew named Jesus son of Joseph lived; most readily admit that we now know a considerable amount about his actions and basic teachings ..."[9] Michael Grant believes that the Christ myth theory fails to satisfy modern critical methodology, and is rejected by all but a few modern scholars.[10] And Mark Allan Powell from the Trinity Lutheran Seminary writes that anyone who says that Jesus never existed "today -in the academic world at least- is grouped with skinheads that deny the holocaust and scientific hold outs who want to believe that the Earth is flat."[103]|`|qcEzJDY6aa	That's the only good option when you know you're dying, and nothing seems to be valuable on the things you're doing, for it will all be gone forever.|`|Hf1UkrWXaa	Faith, of course.

But it does provide needed guidelines so that we can know what to do and what to avoid in order to please God. Similarly, the Bible does not say that it is wrong to use a gun to kill someone, but it does forbid murder.<br>  Luke 10:25-27: “‘By doing what shall I inherit everlasting life?’ .?.?. ‘“You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind,” and, “your neighbor as yourself.”’” (Is a person really loving God with his whole soul and his whole mind if he makes a practice of things that needlessly shorten his life and cause his mind to be blurred? Is he showing love for his neighbor if he steals from others to support his drug habit?)<br>  (2?Corinthians 7:1) “Since we have these promises [of having Jehovah as our God and our Father], beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God’s fear.” (But can we expect to have God’s approval if we deliberately do things that defile our bodies?)<br>  (Titus 2:11,?12) “The undeserved kindness of God which brings salvation to all sorts of men has been manifested, instructing us to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind [“be self-restrained,” JB; ‘to live self-controlled lives,’  and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things.” (Is the use of drugs that impair one’s judgment or that cause a person to lose self-control in harmony with that counsel?)<br>  Gal. 5:19-21: “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, and they are .?.?. practice of spiritism, .?.?. revelries, and things like these. .?.?. Those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom.” (The literal meaning of the Greek word phar·ma·ki′a, here rendered “practice of spiritism,” is “druggery.” An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words, by W. E. Vine, in commenting on this Greek word, says: “In sorcery, the use of drugs, whether simple or potent, was generally accompanied by incantations and appeals to occult powers, with the provision of various charms, amulets, etc., professedly designed to keep the applicant or patient from the attention and power of demons, but actually to impress the applicant with the mysterious resources and powers of the sorcerer.” [London, 1940, Vol. IV, pp. 51, 52] Similarly today, many who use drugs are involved in spiritistic practices or associate with those who are, because a blank mind or one that experiences hallucinations is easy prey to the demons. (Compare Luke 11:24-26.)<br>  Titus 3:1: “Be in subjection and be obedient to governments and authorities as rulers.” (In many locations, possession or use of certain drugs is a violation of the law.)<br>  Since some of the drugs may help a person to feel good, are they really so harmful?<br>  (2?Tim. 3:1-5) “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be .?.?. lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God .?.?. From these turn away.” (Clearly the Bible warns against craving pleasure to such an extent that we put it ahead of applying the righteous principles of God’s Word and having his approval.)<br>  Some NARCOTICS bring relief from pain and can produce a feeling of contentment, but they are also addictive and can result in death from overdose. Sniffing some SOLVENTS can produce a feeling of excitement, but it can also result in slurred speech, distortion of vision, loss of muscular control, in addition to irreversible damage to the brain, liver, and kidneys. HALLUCINOGENS cause a “high” feeling and seem to dispel fatigue, but they also cause distortions in perception of distance, impair logical thinking, can cause irreversible personality changes, and produce suicidal or homicidal inclinations.<br>  What about marijuana—is it harmless? Some doctors have said that it is<br>  David Powelson, M.D., formerly chief of psychiatry, Cowell Hospital, University of California, Berkeley, at one time advocated legalizing the use of marijuana. Later, after more evidence was available, he wrote: “I now believe that marijuana is the most dangerous drug we must contend with: 1.?Its early use is beguiling. The user is given an illusion of feeling good; he cannot sense the deterioration of his mental and physiological processes. 2. Its continued use leads to delusional thinking. After one to three years of continuous use, the pathological forms of thinking begin to take over the thought process.”(Executive Health Report, October 1977, p.?8).|`|NJpihlsHaa	Personally, I don't see smoking marijuana in conflict with the bible.

During the Prop. 8 campaign, the Mormon Church raised upwards of $30 million from their members, ran all the Yes on 8 advertising, and set up the biggest door-to-door statewide voter outreach effort that California may have ever seen.  They also ran phone banks in California and several other states, created an elaborate web site www.preservingmarriage.org with 13 very slick commercials and videos, bussed in thousands of people from Utah and sent out lots of direct mail.  It's important to remember that the Catholic Church also worked to legislate bigotry through the Knights of Columbus who contributed more than $1 million to this hateful measure.  Also involved were all the well-known large, pro-homophobia advocacy groups which commit daily acts of spiritual terrorism against the gay community.<br>  <br>  False prophets don't give up that easily and California is not the only state where they have worked to take away the civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans.  They will continue trying to redefine morality and convincing America that "treat others as you want to be treated" really means "take away the civil rights from gay Americans."|`|bi3XdkMEaa	Mickey, tell another story.

9umpVItqaa	It's always a very sad occasion when someone we love dies. When our loved ones die we naturally seek answers. World religions offer different answers. Some teach that if you live a good life, you will go to heaven but if you lived a bad life, you will burn in a place of torment. Other religions teach that at death, people pass on to the spirit realm to be with their ancestors. Still other religions teach that the dead go to an underworld to be judged & are then reincarnated, or reborn in another body. Such religious teachings all share one basic idea - that some part of us survives the death of the physical body. According to almost every religion, past & present, we somehow live on forever with the ability to see, hear & think. Yet, how can that be? Our senses along with our thoughts, are all linked to the workings of our brain. At death the brain stops working. Our memories, feelings, & senses do not continue to function independently in some mysterious way. They do not survive the destruction of our brain. So what happens when people die? Well, when a person dies, they cease to exist. They do not see, hear or think. Death is the opposite of life. Though we possess spirits, our spirits as humans are not immortal. (Ecclesiastes 9:5,6,&10)   We are mortal & do not survive the death of our bodies. There is also the misconception of Ecclesiastes 12: 7 where it says "The dust returns to the earth just as it happened to be and the spirit itself returns to the true God who gave it". The human spirit is a life giving force from God. Without it there is no life. When it's said that our spirit returns back to God, it's because it belongs to him. So when our spirit returns to God, we are still dead because neither the body nor the spirit can live with out the other. God gave us life, therefore when we lose it, he is the only one who can return it. Which means our life is literally in his hands.  The life we have is like the flame of a candle. When the flame is put out, it does not go anywhere. It is simply gone. Jesus described death as being asleep in death as in a deep sleep with out dreams. God's original purpose was not for people to die. If it were not for sin we would live forever. Death is the penalty we pay as humans for sin. As long as there is sin in this world, there will be death. But we can be optimistic that it won't always be this way. God will take sin away, as well as death. When God's kingdom takes over this current system, all this pain and suffering along with death will be gone. (Daniel 2:44).......We can also look forward to seeing our loved ones again. God will make it where people can live again & it will be much sooner than people realize.  (John 5:28 & 29)|`|Ztiy3jjwaa	Hazrat Usmam Bin Sauda (ra) narrated that his mother was a very pious woman.<br>  He used to go to her grave on Fridays.<br>  Once he saw her in his dream and she asked her son to visit her grave regularly because when he started from his house the neighbouring dead bodies gave the tiding of his visit and she and all other dead persons in her neighbourhood were glad to see him at their place.<br>  She said that his visit gave delight to her as well as the other dead persons.<br>  (Ibn Abidduniya, Baihiqi)|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Inna Lillahe wa Inna ilehe rajeoon.

Once question and answer session is over, the good Muslims are allowed to sleep.

But the soul goes to heavens and stay in a place called  'Illeen'.<br>  On firdays, the souls are brought to their graves, so if you visit grave of your father to say salam to him , he will listen to your voice and will respond, which you cannot listen. <br>  <br>  You need to do 3 things to prove your love for your father.<br>  <br>  1. Respect and help his relatives, like your mom, your father's sister, brother and other relatives. <br>  2. Recite Quran for sawab to his soul.<br>  3. Ask contineously for his maghfirat (salvation).<br>  You can also pray Allah to show him to you in a dream. I saw my father in a very happy state and he talked to me as he talked while he was alive.

You must believe that is his taqdir died in an accident, because we all will die and we do not know when,where and why. It is the secret of Allah.Let us make a du'a that your father will be accepted his good doings and will be forgiven by Allah  all of his bad doings <br>  .Ameen<br>  (1)In line with hadith after the corpse be burried,Allah will give back his soul into his body in the grave.The dead souls will be at alam barzah as the waiting room before qiyamah.He will be questioned about his namaz or salat,who is his God,what is his holy book,who is his prophet etc.In alam barzah he will get a preliminary rewards for his good doings  or a preliminary punishment for his bad doings if any.It is called qubur(grave) torturing. They will be in alam barzah not in the shape just like here on this earth. (2)They can see us if we visit their graves but we could not see  and talk with them.So we should say assalamu alaikum if we enter their graves  and we make du'a for them as instructed by Muhammad pbuh in his hadith.They could not help us because in line with hadith all their amalan (good doings) have been finished when they died.The souls of dead persons could hear us but they could  not talk when we are visiting them. We can send al fatihah at home for them and it will reach them.(3)Yes in line with hadith all people who died in fires and drunk in a river or occean/sea and died in giving birth will automatically go to heaven.They have the same rewards the value of martyrs.|`|dAcNaajsaa	If you want knowledge, you should be going to islamic resources. try islam-qa.com<br>  <br>  if you want answers from people who don't give proof or all sorts of opinions, ask here..<br>  <br>  these matters of belief should be researched properly, and thats not on yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  yahoo answers is good for surveying people and getting views etc... <br>  <br>  not for learning islam !!!!<br>  <br>  i really hope you and the others understand this. <br>  <br>  if u get misguided by what u 'learn' here, who do u have to blame ??<br>  <br>  if i wanted to learn medicine, i would go to a medical school, not yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  well, islamic knowledge is greater than medical knowledge and so u need to seek it from where it is provided with proof from the Qur'aan and sunnah !!!<br>  <br>  but some people just don't get it.. and then they shouldn't be suprised for ending in the fire for being so ignorant and foolish..|`|8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	1. no<br>  2. no<br>  3.no<br>  <br>  they are dead.  until the day of judgement. anything else is just a cultural or superstitious belief, but not islamic<br>  <br>  <br>  i am sorry for your loss.

When bad things happen, we ALWAYS look back to say, "What if..." But the fact is IT HAPPENED the way it happened and Only GOD sees the future...you cannot beat yourself up for not being able to foresee the pain you feel now, or foresee the death. If you do, you are giving yourself too much credit...you aren't God and you cannot expect to be anything other than "human" in nature and ability. <br>  Second, MANY people professing Christianity will tell you I am WRONG, but here is my belief as I feel God has opened my eyes to see it..........<br>  Do not obsess about the seconds of pain or horror your loved one may have suffered...the Bible says God will NEVER place more upon a person that they can take. (I am phrasing in my own way here.)<br>  Also, in speaking to many people who came close to horrible deaths and some who came back from their heart stopping beating and who literally "died" and came back.........most if not all say that the minutes or seconds of their pain or suffering THAT WE would have viewed as horrendous, ARE FORGOTTEN by them! WHY? Because at those moments, God (or his forces of help...the Angels) step in to BLOCK those last horrible moments...God has the power and he is a loving God that does not wish ANYONE to suffer. However, to answer the question many and even you might ask, about WHY God would allow such things to happen, my answer is this.<br>  God is NOT the God of THIS WORLD...SATAN IS. Man did not follow Gods instruction or guidance (old testament) when God actually spoke directly to humans, but yet he continued to try and to teach them. But our ancestors would not listen and continued to do what they wanted. They wouldn't follow the ten commmandments...they are God's law and in following them, this is the guideline for having a healthy, happy and GOOD life. God knew this, but our ancestors could not "trust" or obey. They sought a law of their own and Kings of their own. So God in his eternal wisdom finally saw that the ONLY WAY to teach our stubborn human minds was to LET US MAKE OUR OWN MISTAKES TO THE POINT WHERE WE WILL ULTIMATELY BEGIN TO DESTROY EACH OTHER...THEN, we will all have learned our lessons...some the hard way, some much easier. So God CERTAINLY does step in to HELP those people who are "his" and he CERTAINLY does hear and react to prayers dependent on the faith and sincerity of those praying...BUT HE CERTAINLY ISN'T THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY EVIL, SUFFERING OR PAIN IN THIS WORLD...WE HAVE ONLY OURSELVES TO THANK FOR THAT. <br>  Much of the Christian world will tell you that when a person dies they go immediately to Heaven or Hell. I am here to testify to you that this is not true.<br>  It never made sense to me when I was raised a Baptist and it STILL doesn't make sense. What about children? What about those who have died NEVER even knowing about Christianity?<br>  The main thing I should tell you is that the BIBLE (that should be your ultimate source for a guidebook for every phase of your life) DOES NOT say that people go to Heaven or Hell. Quite the contrary!<br>  Jesus said, "The dead are just sleeping."<br>  Every definition I will give you is in your Bible...look for it.<br>  No one needs to "interpret" the Bible...it interprets itself! <br>  The "Gospel" ALWAYS referred to in the Bible, is NOT the Gospel of Jesus Christ ABOUT Jesus Christ, but is a GOSPEL ABOUT THE COMING KINGDOM OF GOD HERE ON EARTH.<br>  Your loved one is "sleeping" until that kingdom comes. If that thought is harsh for you...think of this. When you fall asleep how much time do you feel has past when you wake up 8 hours later? While sleeping, our minds and bodies have no concept of time. Those who died hundreds of years ago, will wake up thinking they have just slept and woke up! The time, will be only a moment for them!<br>  The Bible indicates there will be TWO resurrections OF ALL PEOPLE!<br>  THAT'S RIGHT...EVERYONE ON EARTH WILL HAVE A "SECOND CHANCE."<br>  And the world they "awake" to will be so much different than our world today that it is probably IMPOSSIBLE to imagine all it will be! WHY?<br>  Because THIS COMING KINGDOM will be governed by Jesus! No pollution, disease, sorrow, etc... YOU EITHER BELIEVE ALL OF THE BIBLE OR NONE OF IT...These prophesies are as REAL as the ground we stand on today!<br>  The Bible also says that God knows every STRAND of your hair...think about that for a moment. If this is true, then God has complete knowledge of every part of us that makes us "unique" and special, he knows and will "store away" the part of us that makes us who we are. When resurrected, we will (The Bible says) be in full body form...only better than when we died. Children will be allowed to grow up...the old will be in prime condition. But we will ALL be in human physical form. This TRUTH has been lost over the ages......but in past times the "old folks" knew this TRUTH.

Then, they will sit within eye-shot of him. <br>  Then the angel of death (peace be upon him) will come and sit at his head and will say "O you virtuous soul; come out to a forgiveness and a pleasure from your Lord ". So it will come out as a drop comes out of the mouth of a jug (with ease), then he will take it, not leaving it in his hand for longer that a blink of an eye until they (he and the other angels) have placed it in that shroud and that embalmment. And there will emanate from it a smell like that of the most sweet smelling musk on the face of the earth. Then they shall ascend with it, and they shall not pass with it by any group of angels but they will say: What is this good and sweet-smelling soul?. Then they shall say to them (he is) "such" the son of "such" choosing the best of the names he used to be called in this life. Until they reach the lowest sky, then they shall ask permission to enter, and they shall be granted entry, until they end at the seventh heaven sky, then Allah, exalted and high, shall say: "write the book of my servant in `illiyeen (1) [And what will expalin to you what Illiyeen is `illiyeen, there is a register fully inscribed to which bear witness those nearest to Allah (see 83:18)], and his book will be written in `illiyeen, and the shall be said "return him to the earth, for [I promised them] I have created them from it, and into it I shall return them, and from it I shall extract (resurrect) them a second time (20:55)". So [he is returned to earth and] his soul is returned to his body [he said and he will hear the footsteps of his friends who buried him when they leave him]. <br>  Then two [severe] angels shall come and [terrify him and] sit him up next to them and shall ask him: "Who is your Lord?". He shall reply "My Lord is Allah". Then they shall ask him: "What is your religion?". He shall answer them: "My religion is Islam". Then they shall ask him "Who is this man who was sent among you?". He will reply "He is the Messenger of Allah (salla Allahu alaihi wa sallam) peace be upon him". Then they shall ask him "What have you done?". He shall reply: "I read the book of Allah, then I believed in it and accepted it". [The angel will terrify him and ask him "who is your Lord?", "what is your religion?" "who is your prophet?", and this will be the last trial on earth for the believer, it is then when Allah says : "Allah will establish in strength those who believe with the word that stands firm in this world", so he will answer my Lord is Allah, my religion is Islam and my Prophet is Mohammad salla Allahu alaihi wa sallam. Then a caller will call from the sky: "My slave has spoken the truth, so spread out for him from the heaven, and clothe him from the heaven, and open a door for him from the heaven (within his grave)", so it's goodness and its smell will come unto him, then his grave will be expanded for him as far as he can see. <br>  Then a man will come to him. His face will be handsome, and his clothes will be handsome, and his smell will be sweet. Then he shall say unto him: I bring you glade tidings of that which will make you happy [Rejoice with a pleasure of Allah and delights that endure]. This is the day that you were promised (46:16). Then he will say [and may Allah give you glad tiding] "who are you?, for your face is the face of someone who comes with good news". He shall reply: "I am your good deeds, [by Allah, I did not know of you but that you were quick to the obedience of Allah and slow to His desoobedience, so may Allah reward you good]". Then he shall say: "My Lord bring the hour so that I might return to my family and my wealth" [it will be said to him "be tranquil"]. <br>  He (Mohammed, salla Allahu alaihi wa sallam) said: { And the disbelieving [transgressor/wicked] servant}, if he is leaving this life and journeying to the hereafter then angels will descend upon him, their faces will be black, they have with them a coarse woolen fabric (sackcloth)[ made of fire]. Then they will sit within eye-shot of him. Then the angel of death will come and sit at his head and will say "O you wicked soul; come out to a anger from your Lord and a fury (from Him)". So it will be distributed (spread out) throughout his body, then it will be ripped away as a skewer/spit is ripped out of damp cotton [and in its way out it will tear and cut the nerves and blood vessels] [and then he will be cursed by all the angels between the earth and the sky and by all the angels in the sky, and the gates of heaven are closed.

It all depends on how you percieve it.. i am a believer ... but i believe in God.. <br>  However, you're the first person with whom i'll be sharing this - I've seen it in a lot of movies and have sometimes secretly hoped to be able to be with my family n loved ones even after i die.. you know..just the way u said...to see and hear them...<br>  <br>  but obviously such things dont happen...<br>  the concept of heaven and hell is highly debated...but the truth is -- there is no one to give a true account of whether there is any heaven or hell or not...<br>  <br>  If there is heaven or hell...its right here on earth itself.. we create our own heaven or hell by virtue of our good or bad deeds...<br>  <br>  the blessing we get from our elders prove to be out protective shield in bad times...that is heaven ...<br>  <br>  the curses we get from people whom we hurt / antagonize become the cause of our pains -- that is hell...<br>  <br>  so its all here -- we live THROUGH it and not reach it at the end of life...<br>  <br>  That you want your father to be with you forever is completely understandable and you can still connect to him...<br>  <br>  as i said...no one knows whether he can see you or not... but parents are like replicas of God on earth ... and now since your father has ceased his human existance - he IS like God above...<br>  <br>  So every time you are about to take some big decision in life...just give a thought to how ur dad would've felt about it ... maybe that way... you'll always keep him alive in ur heart by always respecting the love and values he taught you...<br>  <br>  you can always go to his grave and talk your heart out... even if he cannot reply in person... it'll give u a sense of relief and you'll find answers from within...<br>  <br>  dying in fire or in any other form is no means of deciding heaven or hell... your dad lived his life to the best he could... if he made mistakes... he did good deeds too... and we must always take inspiration from the good done by others...<br>  <br>  I'll pray for him and may Almighty grant him peace.<br>  <br>  And as for the guilt and questions that come in your mind - its very natural.. u r currently in a state of distress and shock ... i'm sure you must be remembering times when u offended your dad or hurt him and feeling guilty about it...dont... because blaming ur self will only hurt u and him, if at all.<br>  <br>  he always wanted you to be happy ...so do that much  for him...remember him as a good memory ... and not as a task u failed to achieve...<br>  <br>  GOd bless.<br>  take care
