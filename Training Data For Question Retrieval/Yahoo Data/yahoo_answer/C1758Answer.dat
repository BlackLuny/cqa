CjAaOsu2aa	I would like that. Good news is just as interesting as bad news. News is news and the world only looks so bad because the only stories they want to put on the air are scandal and murder. There are actually many good things that happen everyday, just it goes unnoticed. But some times the depressing news on the media is actually helpful. If we were only informed about the old ladies giving money to charity and the national heroes how will we be aware of the convicted killer prowling the streets killing little girls? We would be oblivious to the fact that crime is happening right under our noses. Then soon we will be victims and we would not have been warned. So I think they should broadcast good news as well as bad news, to stay safe and informed.|`|olopisx7aa	That does sound like a good idea.<br>  <br>  People would watch the mainstream news, get depressed, then watch the good news to cheer up.|`|t2tYfRnaaa	Yes that is a great idea!!!

It was pretty big for awhile, but people got bored. A news channel like this would likely serve the same fate. News serves a purpose. People can usually find good news in their own lives or locally. But when it comes to national or important local news, they need to know what is bad, so they can prepare for it. If there is a flood, crime spree, war, economic collapse... those things can impact your lives if you are unaware of them. That is one reason people watch the news in the first place. You don't really need advanced notice of good things. <br>  <br>  But don't take this the wrong way. I think you make a valid point. The News IS depressing! No doubt. But that is the reality of the world sometimes. Rather than being depressed by it, however, people should use it to motivate them to lead better lives, be good people, and to do something to make the world better.|`|1263731b76a5881b98bbd0aacec9a2cdaa	Yes, that's a great idea! I sense many people feel the same way you do and would tune in. Everyone loves a good human-interest story and, while it's important to keep up on the latest events, sometimes we do need a break to hear about some of the good things going on in the world. Bad news might spread faster because it snatches more publicity and, sometimes, sadly, hype; but good news appeals to a far more wide-ranging group of people.|`|Nngdk0izaa	That is an interesting idea and I'd flip the channel to good news every time. Sometimes, we need to know bad news to show us what it's like out there, but I think there should be good news also because that would give a message to us that we should be doing things like that. News reporters hardly ever inform us about some news about good events (I wouldn't say they never), only ocassionally. Good news equals good influence!|`|AA10199189	this has been tried several times already, in print, radio and possibly tv tho i cannot immediately recall who it was.<br>  <br>  these organizations always fold because they do not sustain enough readership.  the news is inherently negative as it is that which makes it news - the murder, the assault, the scandal etc.

Plus i think they probably get more flack because they are famous which means its probably easier for them to get in a fight.|`|Z9srxhioaa	More to put into their biography's when they retire from football and more media coverage which will bring in further income before retirement.If these people cannot be in the spotlight from their ability on the Field this is the road they take.The only certainty from this episode is that their bank balances will increase.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	It's always been the same. Years ago the upper classes and socialites were above the law now it's the footballers and 'celebrities'.|`|cKtyAmATaa	Yes, they should be made an example of, they get paid enough to be responsible in public, they are just well paid thugs!|`|cCfryfKWaa	they should bring back the birch,and national service.

But because he is in the limelight, it may have been better to save your reputation and pay off the scum of society, but you're right, he may have been guilty. People are assholes. Are you?|`|R49w1Dr7aa	Guilty Guilty Guilty|`|AHEFXgE7aa	People with money do things a lot of people will never know or find out about.|`|JUYTrzHyaa	Michael Jackson can do whatever he wants because he is so AWESOME!  Seriously, sometime just put on a little Billy Jean in a crowded room and watch everyone start dancing.  God I love that man, or thing, or whatever he is.|`|chlvKoXqaa	because he was guilty and thought he could recoup the money, never realizing that<br>  s one thing the public frowns upon, and he's been a hasbeen ever since, freakazoid.|`|wqchA8B7aa	He was still trying to hide his gay pedophilia at the time. He had numerous other cases, and always settled out of court before. Man, that guy sure does love little boys.|`|1H7Z3Pivaa	He was advised by his lawyers to.  I don't find it the wisest of advises but guilt is almost always easy to speculate rather proven.
olopisx7aa	I think Casey lives in a vivid fantasy world. She's either a pathological liar or she's so crazy she doesn't know truth from fiction. Casey killed her but maybe she's so crazy she thinks her imaginary friend Zanny did it, I dunno. Either way, it's sad.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	casey did it and her mother knows. but all they care about is how to get their sociopathic daughter out of this. its like casey is a spoiled child who just broke & threw away her doll. thats how the family acts. even at the poor kids memorial, the family just HAD to get up on stage and plead w/the public not to hate casey. it was suposed 2 be caylee's memorial, not a soapbox for killer casey. now the grandparents r trying 2 get out of being deposed saying they r too "ill" 2 answer questions. but their not 2 ill 2 go see casey &make sure she is protected & comfy in jail.|`|cPuicv06aa	The prosecution seems to have a tremendous amount of circumstantial evidence against this woman.  She is the most hated woman in America right now.  What she is accused of is truly despicable and it's shocking.  My heart broke when they found this precious child's remains, that was truly awful.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	1. I don't know for sure what happened... and neither does anyone else here. <br>  <br>  2. It is none of my business.<br>  <br>  3. If she were a poor, black kid, she wouldn't even be on the news. Further proof that the media and people who follow this kind of crap are sick. Children disappear and are murdered every single day. That doesn't make Caylee not tragic, but in the end there is really no reason for the national population to even be following this case. I'm sick of hearing about it.|`|vQmO3N6Raa	yeah a few months ago i was staying at my cousin's house and caylee's house was right down the block and they knew the mom personally. it's very creepy to think about.<br>  but it's very upsetting to think that she got buried in the mud with her blankie. =/<br>  poor baby didn't have a chance. her mom needs to go burn in hell.|`|nhZb43pIaa	Guilty and should receive the maximum.<br>  Just sick, really, really, sick.<br>  So sad.|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	I think the mom did it, and its so old|`|GZn5VNlSaa	I think it is horribly sad that such a beautiful baby girl was murdered by her own mother.  I've not been following the case recently.  Not sure what the motives were, but whatever they were, I cannot conceive a mother would do something like that in cold blood!!<br>  That woman (although she doesn't deserve to be called a woman) deserves a place in death row!!|`|5TjDdnZjaa	Her mom is guilty. Cause in some of them pictures i have seen her mom is sittin' in court and and smilin' bout it. That's just creepy and wrong. And for that poor man that found her, i feel sorry for him. Her mom is so mean and it was wrong of her to stick that heart sticker on the ducktape at her mouth. Who does that? This woman deserves to be killed and rot in heck.|`|pq3Dt5bdaa	I've thought she is guilty from the first time I seen her on television. I am the mother of a grown son, but if he had been missing when he was young I would cooperated with the police completely. She gave false info., didn't report it for a long time, not to mention the physical evidence. But the thing that got me was watching her emotionless facial expressions. She looked like she had no feelings at all. She's guilty alright. God will render her punishment. All children are blessings from God. Hope she enjoys prison like she did partying.|`|chlvKoXqaa	tot mom is the murderer, she even dumped the child's body where she used to bury her dogs.|`|USgWGqgAaa	I think her mom is guilty.
AA10199189	these people are also referred to as "the left" (liberal) and "the right" (conservative) from the seats they had to take in the french parliament after their revolution.<br>  <br>  liberals believe in government as the agency that will do what private business does not see as being profitable, for example,  that people are adults who can make up their own minds about any number of things, and that criminalizing various kinds of behaviour that have always been with us (prostitution, for example) is the wrong way to go about it.  <br>  conservatives believe government should get out of their pocket - the farther right you go the smaller the government they want - except when it is needed, i suppose -  that people's behaviour and morals must be legislated, that any number of things are not permitted  because of the "damage" they might inflict.<br>  <br>  one also gets into nationalism and internationalism - with nationalism being conservative and internationalism being liberal - in degrees. in the 1920s in europe, for example, the national socialists(right) in germany found a way to get into power by harping on the fact that the communists (left) were a threat to germany's national identity and this enabled them to get into power and install a dictatorship thru hitler.<br>  <br>  please keep in mind that there is a broad range of shading from the ultra left to the ultra right.  at both ends of ultra, the factions resemble one another in the means they would use.    and people probably have somewhat contradictory mixtures of ideas so that there is not one person who would be a pure ultra conservative
vN2PUynoaa	Please... it is nice to see someone else who feels the same way.<br>  <br>  It must be that Cow-U education.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	I don't like Keith O and am embarrassed for him. Every single time I have turned on MSNBC he is whining about Bill O'Reilly like a jealous junior high school student. The channel is a circus and Obermann is the ape riding the donkey or the other way around. What a disgrace!|`|3hAPLJ4Iaa	If you actually think that that today's modern journalism should be fair and balanced, then you should have your dad smack you in the head so that you can wake up and smart up.  Journalism, especially so called main stream journalism has not been impartial and balanced in years.<br>  <br>  Every journalism entity has some sort of political agenda, and it has been that way since the beginning of this country.  It is just gotten to be more subtle at it.  People like Olberman stick out more because they have more exposure than ever.  Cable is good for that.<br>  <br>  If there is a silver lining in all of this, it is that today you have access to all the raw information that you need to make up your own mind on any subject.  <br>  <br>  Here is a piece of advise.  Don't believe anything any of the journalists say.  Remember where the message is coming from.  Find out the source material on which any particular news report comes from, read it, and make up your own mind.  Do your own research.  Do your own leg work.  Use your head.|`|7Vka1VcOaa	MSNBC is a rathole without integrity, so it's only fitting that they employ the demented Olbermann. His schtick is an embarrassing one, complete with mock anger and paper tossing. It's like watching a B-movie spoof of an arrogant, clueless talking head. Absolutely painful.|`|3irrWRUWaa	just about everyone over at fox is the republican's cheerleaders. i think he's kinda funny, his show is a countdown show of the news of that day so i think it was designed <br>  to be part entertainment, part news.
dGiYVfw6aa	How do you even know Obama is competent yet? He's only been in office a little over a month. What happens if all of his plans make the problems much worse? And remember, it isn't the president alone who's making all the decisions. There are many powerful people in congress who have a big say in what happens. I don't think republicans actually want Obama to fail. Just because one guy on the radio said that, it's not the feelings of all republicans.
9SB2Y5r8aa	It's a place(of many places in the world- such as Iraq, Palestine , Lebanon and Egypt) where zionist lobby in America and European countries playing the role of innocent humanitarian Salvager to cover fabricated senseless struggle by creating two different parties in the same country... that leads the country to be unstable and available for interamericoeuropean control !!!|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	It is genocide!  I ran across this article the other day.  Now I understand what is happening,  the UN is part of the problem.|`|kKswtGMwaa	The Arab Muslims are trying to remove Africans from an African country and are murdering Christians by the thousands too. It is religious and ethnic cleansing on a massive scale. Of course it is a genocide.
JhC6BvPpaa	WOW, I cannot believe the Jade Goody bashers are STILL at it. Life goes on, whatever happens, but to consistently keep having a go at any dyeing person is beyond all comprehension.<br>  <br>  I say, "get a life and live and let live".... There are some very important things going on in the world. Now let this Woman alone to die in peace.|`|AA10077992	I am appalled  at the insensitivity of such people. She has had the bravery to let us all see what can happen if you miss a smear  test and has tried her best to get the age of the said tests reduced from 25.For her 25 was too late.<br>  She had a poor start to her life and wants to make sure that her boys don't have to want for anything. She employed Max Clifford to help her. Like most girls she wanted a white wedding, a house ,a car, a couple of kids and a dog and a holiday abroad.<br>  All she has left on her wish list is a Christening for herself and the boys  - this will happen today - then she will rest<br>  <br>  Please - if you don't like her or what she's doing - that's OK - just please don't be cruel and 'bash' her - be NICE - it won't be for long|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	Yes Bex I am for one - the poor girl is dying yet there are sad feckers who still give her a kick even when she is down.  Fear not though Bex as you and I know these people will get their come uppance - it's called karma.  Let's see them laughing on the other side of their faces then.|`|gPvOcB6oaa	I have no interest in her at all, it amazes me why she employs a publicist to sell stories to the press as I find it totally incredulous that she believes anyone is interested in anything she says or does|`|S8RL9lieaa	The reverse is true for me.|`|3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	The whole thing on here has disgusted me. I've never been a big fan of jade, but recently I've developed a new found respect for her in the way she has put her kids welfare first in all of this.<br>  <br>  Jade made remarks that were only said through ignorance and she openly admits that, but the comments that have been appearing on here are not through ignorance, they are through spite, malice, and hatred. However, these are the same people who would create merry hell if people reacted to them or their family in the same way.|`|4vGvabOUaa	I agree with KooKoo Molookoo... I can't say I hate the woman because I don't know her, and I certainly wouldn't wish death upon anybody. But come on... do people really want constant updates? It sickens me because I'm sure there are much more important things going on in the world, yet this is what's reported. Grr.|`|Zq3fkJmEaa	yes. i have seen some disgusting coments on forums about Jade and it makes me feel sad.  We have all made mistakes, its just that because she's famous more people get to know about hers. She has had a tough life right from the word go. How many of us could say we would be as strong if we had had her life?|`|428b3e1e03a004c698d576092d298219aa	Max Clifford is just after money! if he really was a good friend to her he would tell her to stop filming and spend her last days with her family in private!<br>  <br>  personally I think it should be private.<br>  <br>  people who take the mick are just sad!|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Im just sick of hearing about anything about her|`|HuOQ2B3oaa	I have no idea who the poor lass is.|`|v0LWgN33aa	Yep absolutely but I think the parents of these idiots should keep more of an eye on what their nice little kiddies are doing online!<br>  <br>  Kind regards and hope the Christening goes ok!<br>  <br>  Elric|`|XMTG2XlXaa	Yes, well said.|`|72t32mzKaa	People are entitled to their oppinions, unfortunatly just because she is very poorly it doesnt mean some people will not say out about her or be nice about her. If people maybe stopped asking about her and mentioning her they wouldnt be given the opportunity.|`|mags2ekzaa	the funny thing is when people bash her theyre behaving no better than when she behaved badly, so really theyre bashing themselves, so to speak|`|26t0dbQ5aa	yes, definetly.
81Iglngeaa	They were at war with us for a long time, bush finally took the fight to them|`|2p5VsmZhaa	The war is bad, but as Americans, we will not be pushed around. We have to show terrorists that we aren't going to take the Twin Towers being destroyed or any other crap. Clinton should have done that after 9/11. I'm not saying I like the war, but we can't sit here and do nothing about it. Obama's going to pull them out within some time.|`|OJShm63saa	they false-flagged it|`|dGiYVfw6aa	The terrorists hate more than just the US. They hate people all over the world. Here is a list of countries that have problems with the terrorists.<br>  India<br>  Sudan<br>  Pakistan<br>  Russia<br>  Chechnya<br>  the Philippines<br>  Indonesia<br>  Nigeria<br>  Thailand<br>  Spain<br>  Egypt<br>  Bangladesh<br>  Turkey<br>  Morocco <br>  Yemen<br>  Uzbekistan<br>  Tunisia<br>  Kosovo<br>  Bosnia<br>  Kenya<br>  Ethiopia <br>  Tanzania<br>  Scotland <br>  England <br>  <br>  But I guess we shouldn't fight it.|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	The philosophy of the people that attacked the United States on September 11, 2001 did so because they decided that the freedoms of western culture and that of the United States must end, and that ONLY those of the Islamic faith deserve to live. So, if we ALL convert to Islam and convert our law to that of Sheria, they will stop. Short of that, we will have to defend ourselves and our freedom.

2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	95% of all media is owned by 5 giant corporations, and as you pointed out, they are NOT pro-socialism.<br>  <br>  remember the only "liberal" on tv was Phil Donahue who was fired by NBC for not supporting the Iraq war, which directly benefited NBC=GE=Defense contractor|`|6B3ojD2Laa	I don't see it at all. In fact, only the Keith Olbermann and the Rachel Maddow shows are liberal.  That doesn't make MSNBC a liberal network.  Even though Fox News has Sean hannity and Bill O'Reilly, I can still see most Fox News is just trying to objectively report what's happening.  Just because a network has one or two shows that are biased, one can't jump to a generalization.  I mainly see most news in the USA to be rather superficial, very middle of the road.|`|yGf4eB6laa	I think the belief that the media is Liberal comes from the fact that most of the media was so in-the-tank for Obama. He never got the tough questions, and he got most of the air time. That's probably where it started.|`|a59796a93e9118b10a4496b3195421eaaa	Few things that are spouted by the conservative blowhards such as Rush Limbaugh or Ann Coulter make sense. Yet, people want to believe these things because then they do not have to take responsibility for their actions. It is easier to keep your head in the sand than to face up to the real problems that will not be solved with tax cuts for the rich or throwing the Bill of Rights out the window.
4uhyxMnmaa	I think Octo-Mom is a delusional narcissist whose offspring---all of them--need to be removed from her custody for the welfare of the children, who are the tragic victims in this outrage.<br>  <br>  And, if it were legal, the state would be well-advised to sterilize her to prevent future human tragedy.|`|dASHruataa	Completely disgusting and fitting right in with the state of the world today.  Absolutely nothing will surprise me.  How about you?|`|8GDd6lrnaa	she is to motherhood like Columbine is to high schools- a disaster|`|81Iglngeaa	i figured that out when the story first came up, i think she is crazy|`|75ff9a178399ba606e741dd70967b9ddaa	Right on!!  You nailed it. She didn't count on the fact that people would see through her plan.  There is so much hostility towards her I hope some crazy tv executive doesn't feed her ego and give her what she wants.  How does she think she is going to get people to volunteer to help her with those kids?  I can't help thinking she will end up giving up some of the kids to the state or having some of them taken away from her by the court.  The bottom line is that we will all end up paying for them.   Love the name of the show you thought up.|`|uuXKp2Ebaa	no duh!!!!!!!!!|`|TqP2bhu2aa	i dont get why people would be angry at this woman <br>  <br>  leave her and her kids in peace|`|lTlaNwtgaa	yeah a scammer
