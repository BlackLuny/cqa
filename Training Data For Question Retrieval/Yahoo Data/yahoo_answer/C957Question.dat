20090131121602AADBoZ0	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	If I forgot a number in my account number, what is the chance it was somebody else's account number?	So I was really stupid and didn't double check when I was putting in my direct deposit information for my tax returns.  Now I did put in the proper routing number but for the account number I forgot the very last number.  So technically I didn't put in a wrong number, just left one out.  The account number should have 17 digits, the one I gave only had 16.  I called customer service and she said that since the routing number is correct and I didn't give a 17 digit account number, the check will be sent back since no such account exists.  However their call center is some place in Latin America and I'm just not sure I can fully believe that.   So the basic question is, should all account numbers attached to that routing number have the same number of digits?
20090131125155AAOMIEv	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Shouldn't I still get a 1099 form?	I worked for a company in 2008 as an admin. When they hired me on, the told me for the first three months they would keep me as a 1099 employee and then if I was good enough to stay, I would be a w-2 employee. I know now this was not right of them-they were most likely trying to evade responsibility by keeping me as a 1099. Nothing I can do about that now. After three months they made me a w-2.  Anyway, I quit after working there 6 months. My question is, I got my w-2 form for taxes in the mail, but I've not recieved anything when I collected wages as a 1099-aren't they obligated to send something to me? I am thinking they knew what they did was not right and are trying to pretend my time as a 1099 worker never happened, but I don't know for sure. What is the next step I should take to ensure all the money I earned is reported on my taxes this year? I would really like to file, but I don't want to be accused of not reporting what I earned, and my old job is withholding information!

Regarding wash sales, is it true that if I've bought and sold numerous times during the year (some losses some gains) in a particular security...that to avoid all the calculations at the end of the year...I simply need to sell the stock and be out of it for 31 days (and include Dec. 31 in those 31 days) in order to avoid the wash sale rule?        For example, I trade in and out of qqqq during the year..some result in losses and some gains and some are wash sales...can I simply be out of qqqq from, say, Dec. 15 to Jan. 16th and avoid worrying about wash rule sales?      Oh, also, how likely is it that the IRS would ever bother trying to trace all this minutae in my personal account?      Thanks...

20070223074749AAaAwFP	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	I'll go against my own selfish personal interests out of fairness.  Why won't rightists?	The policies of the Bush Administrtation have been to reduce (eventually eliminate) the tax burden for UNEARNED income (dividends, capital gains, inheritances).  So people who sit on their a55es and colleck dividend checks pay less.  Or nothing!  This merely transfers the burden of taxation to those who actually work for a living.      Is this right?  If anything should be exempt from taxes, shouldn't it be what you WORK for?      I live on an Investment Portfolio.  My taxes have been reduced.  And when my parents die, I will become a millionaire.  Republicans would let me have it all tax-free, while Blue Collar Joe pays to keep America going.  Whenhe has a family to support and can barely make ends meet.      This is not fair.  Tax people like me!  ALL of us!      Why do right-wing Elitists favor a tax system that wages class warfare on working people to benefit the idle rich?

It's nothing urgent, so I may wait until I'm employed and have insurance again to get evaluated if that's the case.  How do most people handle situations like this?  I can't imagine it's that uncommon.  Thanks.

I got this card in March 2008 and was told I'd receive 2% for weekend purchases and 1% for weekday purchases.      Ever since I got the card I have CONSISTENTLY received 1% for all purchases. I called half a dozen times up to August 31, 2008, complaining that rewards were credited inaccurately. Then I look again this January and EVERYTHING is wrong from the September statement on.      I have called to complain and am seemingly getting nowhere. It's as if they don't intend on fixing it for the future, only the past, after you waste several hours of your time on the phone.      WHO must I go to to formally complain about this? Is it the better business buraeu? HOW can I formally complain about this as well?
