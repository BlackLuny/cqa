AA10766729	YES, the parent should know, but NO the child should not be the one to say anything.  The reason(s) being:    1.  Maybe the "cheated on" parent already knows.  If that's the case, that parent is either in denial (and doesn't need to have their nose rubbed in that level of poop) or they've accepted the fact and just moved on.  Not every marriage is all about love & butterflies & roses, you know.    2.  The cheated-on parent WILL find out eventually.    3.  It is NOT the place of the kid to say anything.  The LAST place that kid needs to be is in the middle of THAT type of marital spat.    Having been in that situation (my father asked me to LIE to my mother for him) I can tell you first-hand that it ends VERY BADLY for the whole family....the kid especially!!    The cheater feels betrayed and blames the kid.    The cheated-on feels betrayed....and blames the kid.    It's a lose-lose situation for the kid.  TRUST ME ON THIS!!|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	NO QUESTION.|`|KwNpyp3saa	I think you make a good point. The only problem with that is most adults don't listen to kids when it comes to something like this. They might think the kid is being disrespectful of the other parent and not listen. How would the kid prove this anyway?|`|81wvN8Rraa	I'm pretty sure if the kid figured it out the other parent can too.|`|SzQi9N7daa	Children should rat out the cheater.  No self respecting adult should expect a child to cover for them.  Of course any adult who cheats is selfish and one who cheats in front of their kids is just plain stupid.    Heres a good question.  If the parents cheated will the child cheat as well.  So far the odds are in favor of the child cheating as well.  My wife of 15 years was busted by our son.  Her mother fooled around on her father with at least 3 other men.  Guess I should have done the research first huh.  Also turns out that she had been with a few "Married" men before we got together. Now we know why it is so important to know about your spouses past.|`|lvelp0CGaa	As a mother of 5 children and 2 step children who's father's were BOTH cheating male's I am going to put it to you realistically from both the victim mother and the victim child and hopefully I wont confuse you too much .    From the child's point of view after discovering the affair role play :    Child talking to friend : I found out my dad is cheating with another woman from work his relationship from my mum ended after he had an affair with my younger brother's mum and my mum got left behind just like me , I feel I need to tell my new step mother she deserves to know but I dont want to hurt her .    Best friend advises being aged 12 that due to the pain the father caused 2 families already with cheating new step mother needs to know so the child finally plucks up the courage .    Child to step mother  2 : Mum I have something to tell you I am really pizzed about it , but you need to know ( dad works 15 minutes away from daughter's house she visits regularly ) I saw dad cuddling and kissing and feeling up 1 of his girl work mates .    The child is already upset , confused and feeling guilty , blaming themselves because somehow his constant affair 's is her fault .    Step mother is upset , confused , feel's guilty how did she fail her husband , her children again from her 1st marriage who's father cheated on her , her poor step daughter who had lost her father when she was only a foetus in uturo when his affair with 1st wife came about and caused the ending of the relationship with her mother .Seeing the pain in her step daughter's eyes and knowing how she feels .Trying to help ease her pain and stop her worry about losing yet another family to tragedy like this .    It is NOT about the STD's , it is not about busting the lying cheating toad it is about the outcome for the child advising they go to the victim parent and tell what they know is irresponsibility in its highest core , simple fact is we are NOT legal councilors we dont have the knowledge or know how to wreck this childs relationship with the cheating spouse can you imagine the suffering that poor child will go through when it's cheating parent finds out it was he / she who revealed this ? the resentment , the hatred , everytime an affair ends the cheating toad goes through a mourning time like someone died and they're angry and hurt ( yes their own fault ) but they take it out not only on the wife but the child who told as well.    Try looking at the wider picture instead of looking at the blind side . Realism is needed when dealing with a child confused and in pain and NONE of us are qualified so dont advise them to do it unless your willing to wonder about the serious outcome which could cause that child to commit suicide , can you live with that outcome ? I know I couldnt , think before you give a reply to any child asking this question in future .|`|wzqahEqiaa	I agree that people should get checked for sexually transmitted diseases.  Although cheating isn't only about sexually transmitted diseases.    My parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years.  I am 25 years old and if I discovered that one of my parents was cheating I would be devastated.  The example that a cheating parent shows is bad enough for a child.  It isn't fair to ask a child to keep a secret about cheating no matter what.    Parents are the adults and need to be responsible for themselves.  Innocent children shouldn't be put in the middle.
PCBQbQmraa	You call him a pervert ;P just like that its cute haha xD      OR you say what would you like me to do to you?|`|V2IJHt94aa	Tell him you would talk and ask him about his day.  I fhe presses the issue ask him how he would seduce you.|`|6pXT4W0faa	well if I want to talk dirty.   tell him what you would do.   If you don't really know   just tell him you'd do whatever he wants you too.
AA11231094	He must be around 26 years old. Cuz any real man would NEVER say that. He needs to suck it up. He should be glad he has a damn job right now, Many people cant even find a 10.00 an hour job in this economy. He is a damn fool. Count ya blessings I'd say to him. There is nothing wrong w/ a husband staying home with the kid's if it is a decision made by both. He just doesn't want the responsibility of taking care of a family. Sad. Very sad.   If he thinks things are tight now, if e were to stay home, He would be whipping his azz w/ leaves. I'm from the ole school way, I do not want to work outside the home. But I can stretch a dollar better then anyone. I get most all our personal Hygiene stuff FREE and dog food FREE and so on. I know for a fact my husband can not do what I do to save a buck, My place is home, Plus he cant cook or clean..lmao I for one am not going to wk 40 hours a week, and still do all that i do. He doesn't make much money But we live a simple life, and I stretch every dollar. Your husband needs a wake up call, and your baby needs you home with him or her. Why have children if a day care is raising them? I never understood that. Gl|`|AA10461616	Sorry, but real men suck it up and go to jobs they hate until they find a better one when they have a young child to support.  If he isn't okay with that, he should have married someone that made equal to his pay, or decided it before a baby was here.   You are still breast feeding for heavens sake!  I can not even imagine my husband doing that.  He has had plenty of jobs he hated.  He stuck it out until he found a better one he liked.  We are old enough to be grandparents and don't have kids but he still wouldn't expect me to do that.  Yes, maybe if your husband was wanting to go back to school or something, I can see how he might want you to work for a bit to help until he could move on to something that paid more for the sake of his family- you and his child!|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Tell him its a non-negotiable. It makes no sense for him to take his frustration out on you by making you work, particularly since the logic isn't there - he has a much wider variety of employment open to him - including those 10 buck-an-hour jobs you would be taking!     Right now, in this economy, and with his responsibilities, he should think less of his satisfaction and more about keeping his family fed!|`|81wvN8Rraa	I would tell him to find a different job but he couldn't stay at home. It might help you found something part time on weekends when he could watch your son just to give him a taste of what it would be like when he is home alone caring for your son.|`|AA11990465	He needs to stay at  his job and take care of his family even if he hates it. The fact is that he has a family and that is more important than whether or not he likes his job.|`|lGSv138Paa	Sounds like you need to get some kind of income to help relieve some of his stress. It is amazing how much a little bit of money can make the difference.|`|iD4ejChZaa	Aww--too bad he doesn't like his job, most people don't but they have responsiblities, your baby needs you. You know he won't get the kind of care you give him. So he stays home, gets fat, and lazy eventually he gets on porn, masterbates, then in 6 mos you're on here asking why you don't get any affection anymore.|`|racnq84Vaa	You need to tell him that if you have to make the money and nurse the kids and take care of the kids too, that you can buy a vibrator and two batteries and be just as happy.  So he needs to decide.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	He is probably not a good stay at home candidate.  In today's economy anyone who has a job should try to keep hold of it!  If he is really unhappy he need to make a plan.  He should find out what type of job would make him happy and find position doing that (if he can).  He has responsibilities that he needs to meet - he need to step up!|`|yVIb7zjiaa	Tell him to take a big boy pill and go out there and get a job|`|gkYZFoIoaa	Tell him no. It could become permanent and who wants that?
5r2Csdzwaa	Maybe the DOLT is a queer? Are any of your panties missing?|`|teisU4E2aa	maybe u should get of the laptop and get on my lap|`|xzX3NSUjaa	He probably wasn't expecting it since you don't do that much. Guess he needs to get used to it again so it won't be such a shock.|`|HDFsvJMTaa	He's being a petty man, probably trying to "get back" at you for denying him for two nights. Just go on with life, he'll come around.|`|gkYZFoIoaa	He's just mad. You should make a vow to yourself to never say no to your husband again.|`|mT6b7INZaa	You need to give him a wet sloppy blowjjobb|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Maybe you surprised him!|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	What a dumbass!|`|c07v7O80aa	He's sulking and trying to show you two can play that game. It means he's got a bunch of snakes running around in his head, and he's not talking about it with you, just imagining that you ought to automatically "get it." You two don't seem to have a history of talking about things without recriminations and don't have the skills. Consider a good counselor to help you acquire the skills and some insight on why you have to talk about things.     Now, if he happens to come to his senses (he might, because the snakes might just get themselves sorted out), it's up to you to stop the game and move on for now but still work toward getting some communications skills and habits going later.
xArlqHtraa	I personally think that Kate is probably the one who was wronged because it seems like Janice keeps taking Kate's guys. I think that you need to get them to realize that guys aren't everything and that your friendship is more important than some guy.|`|Lh6pnwqHaa	It was janice's fault. She shouldn't have kisssed Mick
UjG8FqLUaa	well you can`t really force it on. those kind of things just happen quick and unexpected. but when the moment comes get close to him, touch him somewhere he likes being touched, like his lovehandles or rest your arms on his shoulders while you play with his hair and look him in the eye and then stare at his lips and bite your bottom lip. then tilt your head the opposite direction and you know the rest...|`|iufAPDeWaa	Ask him umm... are ya ever gonna kiss me. Lol. I'm serious. Sometimes if helps to be humorous ya know. Lightens the mood. Good luck smooching! Lol|`|8q4RhpZWaa	first slap his face and when he says wtf plant your lips on his. hahahahah then he'll starzzzzzzzzzzzz wooot hoooottttttt|`|0tU4jkS9aa	practice with a sibling|`|fk3TFlTlaa	Just go in.|`|cIPziIdnaa	Trust me, it will happen naturally.  If you have to rehearse your moves in advance, you will ruin the spontaneity of the moment, you will spoil the romance in the kiss.|`|VO50UG6Waa	stare the person in the EYE|`|4drQ38qZaa	Just in an awkward silent moment lean in and do a peck. Or grab his shirt and plant one on him. I do both sometimes. LOL. Good luck.|`|VMEKBGUjaa	When you're close to him, look at his eyes and then his lips, and if you think he gets it move in. It'll just happen.|`|noX4xlvKaa	okay what you do is this. . .    You make little hints about your relationship and how happy you are that your together and if he agrees with you mve your head slowly towards his then that's it your kissing each other like mad!! good luck! :)|`|EswkNpFqaa	Hi, I know the solution to your problem. and trust me, you are not the only one in this situation. You are a young adolescent girl who is in her first relationship. You are confused because you don't know how to kiss. However, don't worry, it is the guy's job to kiss you, if he can't realize that, i think you need to find a new guy, because confidence is key. Good luck.|`|YV4MeQMSaa	Look him in the eye  And when you feel things are relaxed  And he is calm  Just lean in  He shouldn't reject it|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Just ask him for a kiss|`|wIN9xHuRaa	lolz i agree wit mandy datz a really Nice awnser|`|LO3Ra7Ogaa	at the right moment just move in for one..|`|6bSyMGrJaa	Just stare and lean in, he'll get it... well I did... big mistake but too badd.|`|0fTed3IZaa	The way i did for the first time. Was that i hugged my boyfriend for a long time and then after we were done with the hug i kept holding him and looked at him in the eyes. Then i just came forward and kissed him.     I hope i helped.|`|7zoRxC49aa	lol awwwww this is so cute, im such a girl i get excited bout these things (:    ask him too go see a movie, during the movie slowly take hold of his hand and he will turn to face you look into his eyes and turn your head and peck him, take control and even tongue nd move back this will open up to more kissing throughout your relationship which will be naturel
TAT0bkXyaa	Don't think, just do.|`|z2EPIm1Qaa	if shes afraid - let her practice on you, WITHOUT the kissing part. just let her do the whole lean in thing & close eyes. whatever  no homo|`|xbMLtXOuaa	just be passionate, thats what i do and the last 4 or 5 girls ive kissed tell me how great i am|`|AFGxrXSyaa	just don't think about it and let him surprise you. it all comes naturally.|`|GjoPa47waa	GirlsHave a mint. Make sure you are kissably fresh.   Lean in and make eye contact. Lean your head on your guy's shoulder as if you are about to fall asleep. Look up at him - if his arm goes around to let you in, go for the kiss. If not, or or he doesn't seem to be taking things the same way you are, he might not be ready yet. Just relax for now.    Look at his lips. Drop your gaze and your eyelids to half mast, then slowly, look back up at him and give him a little welcoming smile.   Relax and be at ease about it. If he doesn't go for the kiss, accept it and don't push. Wait for another moment, either later in the date, or another time.   Let him know you want to kiss. Reaching up to twine your arms around his neck, or lightly play with the hair at his neckline will let him know you are ready to get up close and personal.   Take the lead. Some guys are very shy. Even those who aren't have been drilled over and over about unwelcome touching. Consider lightly kissing him on the cheek to show him that you're okay with touch. Guys have a reputation as being pervs, but a lot of boys worry about going too far.   Invite him to kiss you. Yep, some boys really do need an engraved invitation. Let's say you've tried to show him you're ready, and he looks interested, but you just can't get him to (A) let you kiss him, or (B) kiss you, then just ask him, "Couldn't we just be kissing right now?" If he doesn't kiss you then, he isn't going to.|`|aOxwt667aa	Just tell her to ask the guy if she can kiss him|`|VO50UG6Waa	?|`|DnCpBjPDaa	The only way she will learn is by doing it.|`|rKbeXJPfaa	Dont worry about it. Or get drunk first! lol...joke.   But yeah, just stay cool and dont think too much about it. Im sure it will be fine.|`|YV4MeQMSaa	just google   How to kiss  (For the first time)    And it comes naturally|`|XzkvqTyxaa	some people kiss objects before the first kiss and that improves the good kissing rate some people are just born good kissers. I don't know what to say cause i have never had any experience but if she notices he sucks at kissing he will get better there is not doubt in my mind.|`|XExUVo0Uaa	Awesome. That is part of the fun. Have her tell him to "teach" her how to kiss. It will be be a blast, trust me.|`|amUIknZRaa	If he's not a shallow bastard then he will understand and they will be just fine.|`|cOkUsbleaa	Tell your friend to relax her lips and in her mind let her say the word OLIVE! it actually works tell her the shape out the letters with her lips and tounge|`|qinFCuxxaa	welll i've never kissed anyone but i would say that it'll just happen. She may be good at it! who knows!|`|o1vXdBIxaa	Yeah. Just be confident and slow. Tilt your head to avoid nose clashes. Not too wet.|`|eANBUVmdaa	oh,please tell her to get with it,maybe u can teach her (as a friend of course),but then again i could show her!!!!!
uhc1MCDzaa	First question: Yes it seems as if he is getting closer to commitment All the things you mentioned are good. Here are more.    Demand respect and give it equally.  Don't let the ugly word jealousy ever arise with either of you but if it does, talk it out. Accept and give reassurance.  Don't expect perfection. There is no such person.  Be best friends  Enjoy the same things but also have your individual times and activities  Be good to each others families  Give each other space simply to be  Be prepared to be bored with him sometimes and down right disgusted sometimes. That's life and that's part of togetherness. It works itself out if you stick the boring and disgusting times out.    You should know each others belief systems and what if any religion you want for your kids. It should be agreed in advance    Know your limitations. Right now the dirty laundry is okay but will it be okay in six years?  Be open about what you want in the relationship.  The best to you and yes there are many divorced folks but we in the human race are in charge of the statistics, therefore if we don't like them, we can change them. It just could be that you will stay married.|`|vOd72W8yaa	Communiction is the best answer that you can ever get from any person that you ever ask anyone on relationship advice about making things last between two people.  There are going to be times in your relationship when communication is going to be key.  For instance, there's going to be a time when you want an answer to a difficult question that requires a thought or two.  The best way is to ask an open-ended question to get the best answer.  Also, there's going to be a time or two when you want to vent.  The best thing that you can do is to let him know, in advance, what type of response he needs to give.|`|lvelp0CGaa	I'm confused .

Don't buy into the "never go to bed angry" crap.  Sometimes you just don't want to deal with the problem anymore and you need to sleep sometime!    2.  Don't leave a problem unresolved, but neither continue to argue about it when you've reached a stale-mate.  When people are angry, they're NOT rational, and so cannot be expected to discuss a problem rationally.  When a couple leaves problems unresolved, what happens is that the problem continues to resurface, and more and more resentment builds (because it was never properly addressed to begin with).    3.  And I cannot stress this enough....LEARN THE ART OF COMPROMISE.  At some point in your marriage (a LOT of points, actually) one or the other of you is going to have to concede a point, and it is ALWAYS better to concede over something that you actually feel somewhat ambivalent about rather than holding your ground to the death.    Which brings me to my 4th and final point:    4.  Know when to pick your fights.  Not everything is worth fighting over.  But understand too that it should NEVER be a one-sided capitulation ALL the time.  Both sides need to compromise and you (and your partner) need to figure out what is do-or-die important to each other.  Or you're going to be going to bed mad......A LOT.    Good luck!!|`|sR6vhbataa	Never take the relationship for granted. Even when you feel really really comfortable. That feeling "comfortable" can lead to "content" which can lead to "bored" which can lead to "ignored."     Don't make the kids a higher priority than the relationship. Sure you will have to spend more time on the kids than your spouse, sometimes for several years. There's no way around that. But don't turn all of your time into "family time" and forget about "couple time." By the time you start turning your attention back to your spouse it might be too late.|`|fMDS4vTGaa	It lasts if you both are right for eachother and ready and mature enough for commitment. You make it last by doing your part by being a good, caring, honest partner.

I hope I helped, and I hope u find sumtin gud for him.|`|PCBQbQmraa	get him some bling with a breakdancer on it or something to signify that moment|`|V2IJHt94aa	Get him flowers, he should be secure enough to accept them.
dGBbFwFWaa	sometimes we learn the hard way.. there isnt anything at this time u can say to her to trust u.. you will have to prove to her that your worthy of her trust again..when u do prove  that u have changed... when some one betrays the trust of a parents it isnt easy to gain it back there will always be a doubt as in you doing the right thing when mom isnt around..give it time and do your best..good luck|`|DGrbpbq1aa	Show her you deserve her trust.    Act right; don't slack off and be respectful.    To get, you first have to give.|`|6gK5dzTdaa	you don't make any one "trust" you.  You have to earn it.  Unfortunately trust is quickly destroyed and slowly regained.  You will just have to continue to be yourself and be honest.|`|kdN0iRdtaa	ok listen if u break trust then it takes yrs to build it up again. i know i didnt help but thats the truth. :(|`|KdR1Lx3yaa	IT TAKES TIME FOR THAT SHE COME AROUND AGAIN..|`|luKyK3Duaa	all you can do is show her you can be trusted.     nothing you say will help.     you can sit down with her and tell her why you done what you done and that you know it was wrong and regret doing it (if you do).
AA10280709	Sounds like a simple case of jealousy sweetie and no you did nothing wrong. You are doing what you should be doing to welcome in your new sister in law and still attempting to keep contact with friends. She should be supportive and happy for you instead she is sulking.  Let it go. Let her know you love her and want her in your life and just ask her to try to see it from your view as right now she is only looking at one person, herself. You are beautifully looking at everyone involved, which is a trait not many can do.  Your fine. The only other thing you can do is show her you care. If she cannot behave in a caring way, she may need some time alone and feeling abandoned in order to appreciate YOU, she's the one losing here not you even though your feeling hurt as well. Embrace those around you who are making you feel good and move away at least temporarily from those who make you feel bad.  Good luck!|`|9iNd0Saxaa	neither of u 2 are write because shes suppose to understand...and u should have at least tried to hang out with her because ur sister in law only needs one person to show her around town...tell her that ur sorry and that you'll try to hang out with her more...|`|9Bw6U4jnaa	She Shouldn't be Mad At All...
S8CZBCe2aa	Don't overreact about this!  It was only a kiss and he wasn't your husband at the time.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	two months is a long time before your marriage. I'd let it go. you are working on trying to make a better future for yourselves not trying to crush each other for some mistakes that have made in the past.|`|AA11990465	Why did he kiss her? What type of kiss was it? What were the circumstances surrounding the kiss? There are too many questions left for me to answer your question.     If it were nothing passionate, say a kiss on the cheek, then no biggie. I could forgive that. I just need more information to answer more thoroughly.|`|pvbjnqG9aa	I consider it cheating. It's up to you to decide if you can look past it and try to trust him. You may want to re-evaluate the relationship and why he didn't tell you before you got married.|`|81wvN8Rraa	It is cheating but you can get over it.|`|Pj81dRTAaa	It's cheating if you were engaged at the time, which I would assume was the case. It's possible to get over it though, depending on the person, some women get over actual intercourse. But it's up to you, you have to decide whether you can get over it or not. Talk to your husband and see if he is really sorry and willing to help you get over it (by say cutting off contact with the OW, spending more time with you etc.) Hope things work out for you...|`|YREeOwnSaa	HELL NO!!!!|`|fMDS4vTGaa	Get over it, it was before your wedding. Cut your man some slack and if he pans out well in the next year then you've got a keeper.    If the kisser gets out of control again, then you may want to rethink your life time arrangements.|`|hSQ0nC7haa	Maybe i might like it|`|R2epUOTMaa	If you feel like he cheated on you then you should see about some marriage counseling. A lot of church's offer it for free and it would help you two work out the issue.  A lot of it depends on your view & feelings so if you don't work it out now it will grow into something bigger.
c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	What I did with my younger sister was put on online cartoons, like Inuyasha, that was one that me and my sister bonded over, we never had much in common until that one got us talking, that one or dragonball gt, also, anime never interested me but these shows are the best =) a website to watch the inuyasha anime is www.inuyashamovies.net they have the whole series and movies, or youtube or google video, hope this stops the boredom!!|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	kick a ball around  play tip  wrap furniture in newspaper  dig a hole in the garden  blow up hundreds of balloons  bake a pie and eat it|`|njT0e7Upaa	play video games, go mini golfing, go to the mall, take him out for dinner, go to an arcade, hope its funn and helpss|`|e6MaU7nvaa	Tell Jokes - Play video games- play board games - make a snack, and watch a good movie, or read a book play games on the internet teach him about something interesting to him. Like Our planet, and solor systems then show him pictures on the Internet. You have to be advetuous, and exciding for him.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Let him invite a friend over, order a pizza and watch a movie ( of their choice of course )
iT0Z2icCaa	well done a beautiful necklace for a beautiful girl its so refreshing to see that now and then their are young lads who express their love with a valuable gift and are prepared to let their girl know she is worth that and much more , thats soooooo sweet , she will love you forever ,|`|38IuCir9aa	omg its sooo pretty, she's lucky to have you as a bf! she'll love it im sure of it!!!|`|AAQrhKg6aa	my boyfriend bought me the same necklace!!    i loved it good choice ;)|`|1GeulFHOaa	That's a really beautiful necklace! It's so sweet that you want to do something special for her  :)|`|BE5HlQseaa	its beautiful! any girl like me would go totally gaga over that. go for it if she doesn't like it than she's definitely not for you. good luck! :)|`|x0a2Zxc5aa	shes lucky!!!|`|3wWGjj4naa	i dont like it looks childish... even if she is 15 the hearts remind me of really cheap jewlery go with soemthing more classic|`|Q8QQpKPUaa	i personally think that it's not for her age... i just think she needs sth more... like this:   btw i totally love it and she, as a 15 year old girl(i am 18) will love it(plus, it's swarovsky but not expensive): http://www.swarovski.com/Web_GR/en/65890...    hope u like it too!|`|4MjSgjAAaa	yea get it it is gorgeous i wish my bf would buy me something as nice as that|`|cHM2US6xaa	Its SO pretty !    Wish my boyfriend bought me that.I'm lucky if he spends 20$ on me :(    And hes 18 so am I. I'm going to break up with him. He has all this money but barely ever does anything/buy me anything.    Thats a lot of money for a 15 year old.|`|GjoPa47waa	Hey..that's really sweet  personally i don't like hearts  but instead...you should get her her favorite shape   or the first letter of your name...|`|0128ace84ef892d02fe82e156e193d12aa	That is so pretty. I like it and only 2 years older than her. It kind of reminds of the necklace my boyfriend got me for christmas. I really think she will like.|`|4f928be0b9419dfd5070c2a489577792aa	I don't know why you say that the price isn't 99.00 anymore.  I just added it to my cart and the price is what is advertised.    You even get a cute plush puppy with it.  :)      I would get it for her!|`|jB5cMnGFaa	If you have the $$$ then GO FOR IT :) Especially for  a one year anniversary...it isn't over the top and it is something she will treasure ! I still have my very first bf's bracelet...a gold heart-i was 15 and now i'm in my 40s..and when I stumble across it in my jewellery box it still makes me smile |`|4drQ38qZaa	OMG that is amazing. Get it and she will enjoy it. But on the site it says it is 99.99.....|`|ENQkQ6JKaa	So cute She will love it!!|`|rKbeXJPfaa	Thats an expensive gift for a 15 year old!  But sure, its a lovely necklace.|`|uvn609hsaa	I think it is absolutely beautiful! She is lucky to have you. Good luck. x|`|054bfce8ce5933a083f96a2cc71caf09aa	It's beautiful just the thought that you remeber is great plus a beatiful necklace couldn't hurt ;)|`|TXKKOa1Jaa	OMG!! you are SOO sweet!  Any guy that nice is SURE to have a pretty girl.  And that necklace is very pretty!|`|7iMfRDNbaa	good choic, it's really pretty, she'll love it! :]
ztb7OCvyaa	Of course not. Truthfully many Americans don't anymore, but some still do. So I wouldn't say the idea is unacceptable so much as it is unusual. There's nothing wrong with having personal standards.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	No, I plan on doing the same.|`|qnFju8Z1aa	Even if it is considered ludicrous or ridiculous to have premarital sex in America, it shouldn't stop you from protecting your values and virtues as a woman of faith and/or morals.  I myself said the same thing, but I messed up and did it anyway.  Regardless of what I did; I still want to wait until marriage to have sex again.    Protect your values! :)|`|uQnIVnWzaa	It's not unacceptable but rather anachronistic. It hails from our puritan background and is not the norm.|`|x22uyDa9aa	I plan on keeping mine until matrimony.  To the general population it's kind of old fashioned.  But it's definitely a noble action to hold out.  Be proud to be that self respecting! It's a very small percentile of people that have the same value as you.|`|cu9V1PVsaa	I am American, and I proudly believe in keeping your virginity till marriage. Twilight is just a book, and it is just the author's beliefs.|`|pLExaQG8aa	I am remaining pure until marriage. It's not that it is not acceptable but Americans are very secular and some don't take sex seriously and just go around sleeping with everyone.. It depnds if they have morals or not..But yes it is acceptable. A lot of my friends are remaining pure.|`|LO3Ra7Ogaa	ummm no.  im saving myself.  different religions do it different ways.  theres always the man whores and the sluts but i think everybody should save themself.|`|l0Eyx582aa	I'm an American and I am waiting until I'm married. I read Twilight too and Bella just bugs me. I admire those who are also saving themselves for their future spouse. :)|`|WjClLsPQaa	no, it's not ridiculous at all...it's just that most people don't have high morals, or don't see anything wrong with having a little fun, or giving into passion, or whatever there reasoning is.|`|kD0zNJLqaa	I would love love love to date a guy who wants to wait until marraige  ahh! I love twlight! I just finnished Eclipse yesterday.  And it is very acceptable for women to want to wait too.|`|IdwbQTIaaa	Some people are just douchebags.  It is every individual has the right of when they want to lose their virginity.  Some people chose to lose it at like 13 (according to the boards on here!) and unfortunately some people are raped and have their virginity stolen from them.  But it is not rediculous for someone to want to save themselves, I think its romantic and special.|`|CcfMfP8zaa	well no it is but as it says in twilight: edward is old fashioned  and bella only laughed because she thought it was funny because the role is usually the other way around. the man is trying to sleep with the woman not the other way around.|`|amUIknZRaa	I don't think it's ridiculous at all,  just difficult in our culture.  I'm am absolutely going to be a virgin on my wedding night. (I'm 21)  Many will say "get with the times" or something like that,  but to be honest I think that premarital sex is selfish and is destructive in marriage and is probably not helping the divorce rate.|`|9AdXRilqaa	It's never "unacceptable" though depending on who you talk to they may or may not understand. Some people do it frequently and that definitely isn't ok with everyone. Some people (such as Bella) feel that if you love someone enough that you should do it, and most people feel that way. And then of course there are some people like me who wait until marriage to be completely certain that the other person is serious and committed. But anyways the bottom line is to do what you want to do and not worry so much about what others think.|`|Q8QQpKPUaa	i wish i could keep my virgiity... but here in greece the're gonna think you're crazy if u do that...! even parents are sure their kids are having sex before marriage... at least i'm gonna try to keep it for as long as i can... please don't lose yours...|`|AVSXCNBjaa	Keeping one's virginity is not ridiculous at all. There has come a time in American culture where some people feel that their virginity is not something worth saving for marriage, and there are many reasons: having fun, not ever expecting to get married, the openness of sex, believing that they will end up divorced anyways, etc. If a person decides to keep their virginity that is nothing to make fun of, it is something to respect. At this point in time I feel that it is just a matter of choice and personal preference as to weather you wait or jump in.  I am also confused as to why it is anyone business what you are doing in your sex life....    Please note, there are many many religions that require keeping one's virginity for marriage or forbid marriage for a virgin, so there are reasons relating to faith also.|`|DxohE884aa	Dude, it's cool. Just be yourself & keep your values.|`|DrFrkM63aa	NOT AT ALL!!  you'll be glad you did when you save it for that one special person!|`|7AFLaiYjaa	NO. Im doing that. Its absoultly not ridicoulous. Twilight = LOVE |`|wWzO9xARaa	No its not ridiculous to keep your virginity until you get married. I just think its ridiculous to make a promise like that to yourself, if you're not 100% sure you can't keep it. I was listening to the news a while back and they were talking about teens and how they say they are going to save themselves for marriage but quite a high percentage actually did not wait unitl they were married to have sex, even though they said they would.|`|yFvdXRPBaa	I'm 20 years old and never had sex and never had a real relationship and am dreading Valentines day yet a again, because I'll be alone, so I am just thinking F it and I will just wait till marriage to have sex, if that is that I meat anyone.    Good Luck :)|`|gxH4ySqraa	i think its really cool for someone (guy especially) to keep your virginity. its really sweet and it proves that your strong enough to stand away from the crowd. yay virgins!|`|0435c3993c3b05aec46c72cda7b5faa0aa	i am not going to have sex until i'm married, but most teenagers have sex in highschool. so yes, most people think it is rediculous|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Uh yes|`|rKbeXJPfaa	No thats fine. I'm in England but i can't see it being much different there. Do whatever you believe is right.|`|g1qoAtaRaa	I highly suggest waiting till matrimony to lose your virginity. Unfortunately, most Americans don't give a care, and have sex anyways. Well, hello, 9 months later, you're a mother. It's not pretty. So if you're considering losing your virginity, please wait for marriage; it's an altogether a better choice for both you and the baby.    Dani|`|FROfw46Yaa	Some Americans share that value. A lot of people, at least the ones I've met, seem to find the idea silly because they don't think people can wait that long. It really depends on the person. I have one friend who is definitely waiting until marriage. I have another friend who who thinks sex is purely for fun/pleasure. Personally, I am waiting until I am in a committed relationship, though I think waiting until marriage is a bit much.    The important thing is that you think about it and make the decision that you're most comfortable with, not the one that society thinks is the most appropriate.
8mR3Kchnaa	Next time u meet her talk to her and tell her how u feel...maybe u could start chatting online
9SahxKp3aa	awwwww that is so cute. id wait till ur positive she likes you back before doing anything rash tho. :) good luck|`|XzkvqTyxaa	you like her and she will probably figure out soon ut ask her out and the giggles will stop just stay completely confident and open soon you will have the courage to ask her out.|`|Yo0aKOliaa	Either you have a crush or you just found a great person who makes you smile and laugh. Either way its an amazing thing and you should tell her that you really enjoy her company.|`|NAqfPvmHaa	and they call it puppy loooooooooooove!!!!!!|`|KcR829Edaa	You like her! ask her out the worst she can say is no|`|wgCwEYzXaa	well, im going to go with, you probably like her. there should be more information kind of.....like what she says that makes you.....um, giggle.......and also.....is it like IM chat or chat chat like face to face? im going to go with IM chat and say that you like her. you should ask her out....and talk to her more often. it mite be because you dont jave so much experience talking to girls? er....again....[[conclusions, conclusions]] you like her. you'll getused to talking to her eventually. and like i said before....it would be easier to help a little more if there was some more info.   hope i helped!!|`|uQnIVnWzaa	She's a good friend of yours?|`|DxohE884aa	That's sappy... But kinda sweet I guess.  You definitely like her.|`|0tU4jkS9aa	because you like her. duhhhh|`|xETCO0rUaa	You luuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu... her|`|UP33GlBwaa	Someone's in love!  Good Luck with that.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	So, you did!  Keep on and time will tell.  The more you know each other, the more you will know yourself better.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Your feeling a banana in your pocket, okay thats kinda weird|`|zxrvjhkxaa	Ask her out!!!!|`|AA10280709	That would be called puppy love. Explore it.
8495178fb8446ca3f3b1ed47edb9dde1aa	If you have to ask, then no, you'll know when you are|`|0tU4jkS9aa	noooo. you just want to believe it because you are that desperate|`|AA10451072	No..|`|YumnMIo3aa	You're asking yahoo to tell YOU whether YOU are in LOVE or not?|`|ZkuYBUByaa	Hmmmm if you have to ask Yahoo about whether or not your in love, chances are YOUR NOT IN LOVE.  Go play with a barbie or something, because this is just retarded. :(|`|ssT6J7ifaa	no i dont think so. your prolly like 12 so nope|`|1C78irCHaa	Yes, you are in love.  OF COURSE.  DUHHH.|`|pcBmyGTZaa	No.     Simple as.|`|AA12272885	If you are so young you are referring to him as a boy, then no you can't possiblly be in love.  Just a crush.|`|pOLBKKNpaa	no, you have to get to know him first|`|lTOeMNnraa	No well i dunno    you should feel it yourself if you are|`|AIftgLEGaa	love is a word that is open to interpretation. some people may see a certain level or caring as love, while another person may not see that same amount as love. so, basically what i'm saying is that it's something you have to decide for yourself.|`|8rLH4YNsaa	Your not, because you wouldnt need to ask this question. Trust me, you know when you love somebody. I used to think i was in love with people over the past 3/4 years, and that was absolutely nothing compared to the guy im actually in love with now. You just know.    Good luck :) x|`|aOxwt667aa	na|`|EMcwjhZ4aa	No I don't think you're in love... yet.    You might be getting there. Real love is much more than the feelings you are experiencing right now. It's experiences that you both will go through together that will lead up to true love. You're gonna have to go through some hard times for it to be real. The times when it gets hard is when the love gets strong. Those good and bad moments shape what will make your relationship something worth more than butterflies. But enjoy all those good  feelings and have fun too! Good Luck!|`|zxrvjhkxaa	You need to figure out your self.|`|pFsqFeDCaa	PUPPY LOVE...SORRY|`|VMEKBGUjaa	No one can answer that for you. I know it's hard to figure out for yourself, but if you have a lot of doubts then you probably aren't. And you if don't feel comfortable enough around him to kiss him, then you probably aren't.|`|k26Vbizmaa	uh, no.|`|o1EK9llnaa	only you can answer that. how old are you.... anyway love is what you feel, not what others see.|`|pLExaQG8aa	Nobody can tell you whether or not you are in love.. You have to figure that out for yourself.. But I will tell you this.. You WILL know if you are in love.. You won't be unsure of it. So are you in love ? I don't know but since you are having to ask I don't think so. It sounds like you are in lust. I'm sure it's more than a crush though.. You probably just like and care for him a lot :) but aren't to the love yet.. We just can't tell you what you are feeling....|`|qwVruoJ8aa	no one will figure this one out for you have to do it for your self|`|mgGf6t4Naa	kiss him and you`ll find out if he pushes away friends if you beg him if not your gonna think that was the best decision of your life|`|amUIknZRaa	You have what I call the warm fuzzies.  Warm fuzzies = not love.|`|0OGC6IIraa	no, sorry.  its the lust phase.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	uh NO what are you like 12 ?|`|hCiy0CF4aa	Ok, what they call this is puppy love. What this means is that your not really in love, but infatuated. Physically I mean. Love in the real sense is much deeper than infatuation.|`|AA11376151	no  you know your in love when you don't have to question your emotions. your probably just getting attached  when you can honestly say you love him then you are in love|`|EQ4q0Lf5aa	Love is something you find out on your own, it WILL just happen whether you want it to or not. You will know if he is the right one but trust me no one on yahoo answers will be able to tell you.|`|OZQOvAhqaa	well i don't think u can call that Love just wait after a couple more dates then you will know the answer. & wait untill you 2 have kissed nd possibly make out.|`|NPEXTgkXaa	what are you 12?|`|eblEtqYXaa	we need more details hon.....  gwashhh|`|uQnIVnWzaa	No. You are not.|`|aDoMnmDSaa	Well thats up to you,,, you will know wen you are...only you would know the answer to your question(:!?|`|9RW0aqiKaa	he just wants your vagina... thats what he loves|`|ryag9YySaa	When your in love...you just know... you feel like you have to tell that person how you feel.|`|hRsIFRzQaa	well i really dont think that your in love its just maybe you like him AL0T .. you only know if you are in love with him|`|h8yKU3gAaa	well if you havent kissed yet then NO your not even in puppy love yet    barrycool5@yahoo.com|`|XExUVo0Uaa	yep|`|2Y5rSTRZaa	How old are you? Honestly, no one can answer that question except for you. And even if we could, you didn't give us enough info to do so.
Hd7tFHN7aa	it doesn't sound like your two got back together.  It sounds like he is stringing you along to me.    If he is not with you on the weekend and you make plans with friends then go out and enjoy the evening.  If you meet someone that you like exchange numbers and tell him your free on weekends, then let your old ex know you have plans, or that you went to a show on sat. night, see what happens if the tables are turned,|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Look, if you don't trust him, then it is time for you to move on. I'm sure you don't want to spend the rest of your life wondering, do you?|`|qfVE2KFtaa	If he's really your boyfriend all this I spy stuff wouldn't be needed,what would you do if you do catch him probably something stupid  is it worth it.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Don't surprise him - just don't.  If he hasn't contacted you for over a week it's because he doesn't want to see you at the moment.  Chasing after him (that includes surprising him) is going to make you seem desperate, and it will scare him off and make him run a mile.    If he doesn't contact you within a few more days, let it go, continue on with life and date somebody else.  Don't waste your time on somebody who doesn't have enough time for you.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Do what you want but it's been 5 years if he can cheat on you with some random girl he will do it again. Go ahead and pop up on him and see what he is doing.|`|5jMNBO2naa	as the old Chinese proverb once said    fool me once, shame on you  fool me twice, shame on me    so don't be surprised if he is cheating again    as why ( and i am sure i all ready know the answer ) would you try to even justify taking him back?|`|cPpP4BZIaa	Just sign into x-box as a different user and try to hook up with him to see if he goes for it. then you may get your question answered then.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	Just do it.  You will know one way or another what he is up to.  It might be great or it might be the nail in the coffin that you need to move on,|`|zNyvEtpfaa	i think u should surprise him and remember once a cheater alway a cheater|`|LgMoGUoqaa	please do not surprise him.  If you are still worried about him cheating, move on with your life.  He certainly is not worth you getting your feelings hurt over.  If he cheated on you once, he probably will cheat again.  Move on.
3k2NjOWsaa	I would flirt away!!!!!|`|z2EPIm1Qaa	make eye contact, talk, flirt a lot, & make stupid jokes|`|qVdvwWUbaa	I showed my boyfriend (before we were dating) that I liked him by spending a lot of time with him. After I while I started putting my feet between his, then I held his hand, and yeah. =]]    So I guess that's how. Haha.
4Z1yW8dBaa	Its true that he can do 6 months.  I've seen it happen a lot.  Judge's are impatient when it comes to support deliquencies.  At least she's giving him a chance to stay out of jail.  Some judges wouldn't.  I know it sounds illogical to put someone in jail, because they'll lose their job and then really not be able to pay, but this is a rainy day, an emergency.  He needs to find the money and then start making regular payments on time.  If he's making an effort, they'll work with him to get it right.  Silver lining?  If he really is facing contempt of court (for failure to abide by the court's order to pay his monthly support) and he can't afford an attorney (because, if he could, he'd be better off just giving THAT money to his ex) then the court will give him an appointed attorney.  When jail is a possibility, they almost always have to do that, get him an attorney,depending on the jurisdiction.  Make some calls.  Get some answers for your particular state.|`|zDmGngXVaa	Yup they can! If someone owes more then 5,000 in child support they will be facing jail time. If it was less then 5,000 then they would either suspend license or take them away until it's paid up for. My daughters father has been delaying on paying child support for 30 days and they are already threating to take his license away for 3 months! It sucks to be them but they should help support what they helped make!|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	ok for the most part. all of the actions are handled by the child support enforcement agency.  every body know that you can't pay money from jail. including the child support office and the Ex, so long as he is paying off his debt and continues to pay off his debt, he should be ok.     but if he misses a payment one time or gets fired from his job all bets are off. they will prosecute him not only for not paying child support, but they will prosecute him for being in contempt of court and put a warrant out for him.|`|c07v7O80aa	The court figures nothing else has got his attention. Why not put him jail for blowing off the court order. He wasn't paying anyway. And judges do not bluff when people blatantly violate their orders.|`|ciSgaxlMaa	No, you can't pay child support from jail, but you often have to post bond to get out of jail.  Guess where the bond money goes after you appear in court?  He needs to just pay the money and keep paying it.  Why doesn't he want to take of his kids?  Who does he think is responsible for supporting them?  And yes, they'll keep him in jail, they can garnish his wages, keep all of his tax returns, and in some states revoke his driver's license.  There are way too many dead beat dads out there.|`|nsGBwXCTaa	Well it is true .If yall have  done yalls taxes they can have the I.R.S. take all of the money that he Os  . Down here where I live they only let you get behind 3work weeks then they lock you up and take away your driving licens|`|cPpP4BZIaa	If he was ordered to come up with the 3- k, he better and yes he will go to jail if he don't comply.|`|81wvN8Rraa	With as much as he owes your lucky they ever let him out. He deserves it for being a dead beat dad!|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Depending on the area, he may do 6 months. Most people I know that are deadbeats usually spend 30-45 days in jail, mainly because of over population. You make the argument he can't pay from jail, which is true, but he isn't paying anyway, so maybe some jail time will give him some incentive. Although even if he doesn't have the full $3000.00 if he can show he is making a genuine effort to pay, they may not send him, that would depend on the judge.|`|YJBsyZUxaa	Absolutely. To allow it to reach a figure that high demonstrates he has no intention of paying it. He has violated a court order. If he is trying to correct the situation, I give him credit but you reap what is sowed. He will get jail time. The more money he can collect the better off he will be. His best chance is to go as close as possible, present the money to the mother in front of the judge, and ask for a few more weeks to come up with the rest and a plan on how he is going to come up with.
yFvdXRPBaa	I would ask him out, but do it when you two are alone and explain to him that you know that people have said things about you but tell him that you won't have that image if he takes the time to figure out what type of girl you are by being with you.    Good Luck :)|`|QEEweJUaaa	Ignore him and move on.|`|qM5JiI56aa	Ask to hang out and take it from there|`|0OGC6IIraa	I say no... my rule is always never redate someone.  If he broke up with you, there was something he didn't like enough to ignore his friend over.  If he wasn't willing to tell his friend to shut it and talk to you instead, he's not right for you then.  You deserve to be treated with respect.|`|EQ4q0Lf5aa	This is the easy way out just get a friend to ask him if he still has feelings for you, you get the good or bad news and make your decision. Is he worth it? Do you want to? Are you right for each other? consider this before you ask him and if you are too  shy to ask him then get that same friend to do it as well. Good luck =]|`|0tU4jkS9aa	ya ok. if you want a broken heart. hahha. your gonna be sad. hahah|`|3y0w1qIBaa	No, because if you get back together back with him, he will break your heart again.|`|coqWaO9eaa	give him a litte more time just incase he doesnt feel the same way... rejection sucks|`|aOxwt667aa	N:Never  O:Omg Don't!
KcR829Edaa	tell him it makes you feel uncomfortable in a relationship the worst thing you can do is be closed|`|faj6WSL8aa	Tell him it makes you feel weird about the pictures. Ask him to delete them in a nice way.      My boyfriend had a box of letters from his girlfriend and when he found out it hurt me that he had them he gladly get rid of them  Sometimes guy don't think that way.|`|ssT6J7ifaa	tell him to talk that OFF. omg that would make me sooo mad|`|bM4zYt44aa	Leave his ***. I just went through this. I dated a girl for 2 years that had a hard time letting go of her ex and still tried to be friends with him. I got redeployed over seas and within 2 months she was right back with him.  Leave him because the first time he gets a chance he will get right back with her and either leave you broken hearted, or try to have you both and that's just as bad.|`|JHasLcn3aa	Nothing.  it was a part of his life and memories.  As long as he is with you trust him.  Until he give you a reason not to trust him then don't worry about it.  He wouldnt be with you if he didnt care about you.|`|XzLUA7ataa	And this is wrong because?   It's good to save some memories.  He doesn't need to flaunt them in front of you or draw comparisons between you and the girl he dated previously, but a scrapbook is fine.  After all, he did break up with her to date you.  Be glad you are the one he has chosen now.|`|pbPe614Raa	thats creepy. he is still hung up on the other girl obviously... erase them and put sum of you on his phone. :P  that would b funny.|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	Ask him why he feels the need to.|`|noX4xlvKaa	Ask him 2 delete them and if he says no then ask if he still has feelings for her then its up to you where it goes depending on what he says back to you.|`|K4SSZ6qFaa	ask him if he thinks that hes still with her or what.   that happened to me before and i was PIST and i told a friend and she told him about it and then he took them off. i was still pist but i mean not that much.   yeah you can either ask him to take them off because your with him and yeah or you can tell a friend and have them tell him|`|VMEKBGUjaa	Has he shown them to you or something? Maybe he was trying to make you jealous, but otherwise maybe they're just good memories for him. If you're concerned that he's still interested in her, you should talk to him about it. Otherwise, it doesn't really matter. Everyone has pasts.|`|O6TC4CgRaa	Well, maybe you should ask him.  I'm not so sure what i would do. I think ask him why he still have the picture of them together.|`|XTehozZSaa	Well, I'd firstly confront him about it.. but dont make it such as "Why have you got pictures of you two?"  You should try make it more of a "*Chuckle* You still got photos of those old times?"    Depending on his answer.. You should tell him how you feel about him having these pictures, maybe then he will get rid of them.    What i wouldnt do is, Go and delete them.. This would only make him mad at you and wouldnt favour you in any way!|`|w4ZPcamlaa	Maybe he has pics of her and wont get ride of them coz they are still great friends. Although u should talk to him about it just incass|`|V2IJHt94aa	You should let him keep his stuff and his privacy.  You can also arrange to have some pictures taken of you and him.  When a girl tells a guy what pictures he can or can't have it is viewed as controlling and hostile.  the same as when a man dictates what his girlfriend can do or say.    To let him know it bothers you you could share things that old boyfriends gave to you.  But really you have to ask yourself why it bothers you and why he looks at them or keeps them in the first place.|`|zzUNjpinaa	The past will always be there, so let them be. If you think he still likes her, just confront him about it. Maybe he has them for a reason.|`|HykE5X0Laa	Talk to him. Say seeing those pics of the ex makes you feel uncomfortable and have him remove them.|`|r3te0Bwkaa	tell him to delete them. or delete them when he's not looking and see what he says. if he bitches, then leave his ***|`|QC7QgTZ9aa	I was depressed, but I wanted to deny it. I began to have thoughts of how to commit suicide. I knew that I was very discouraged because the events in my life were not going in the direction that I wanted or expected them to go. But could I really be depressed? Was suicide a possibility? Surely, I could deal with this! I didn't need help. I could handle this on my own. After all, things weren't that bad, were they?    Then menacing thoughts began entering my head - ways to commit suicide. I wondered how to tie the right knot to create a noose. Would that pole up there be strong or high enough to hang myself? Would I have the physical capability to accomplish such a feat? These methods of suicide were frightening thoughts. Where had they come from? How had they gotten into my head?    Later, the thoughts became more insistent. It was as if these thoughts had a character all their own, a separate entity, that had somehow taken residence inside my brain. I was starting to get worried and wondered if I needed help. I was not moving beyond this and the horrifying thoughts were getting worse!    I didn't tell anyone about these thoughts. They were so horrific to me - to my usual upbeat, outgoing personality. I was afraid to tell people for fear that they would minimize my feelings and make me feel ashamed. They might reject me and I couldn't deal with those reactions. I was trying so hard to cope with what was happening to me. I wanted to be strong. I wanted to believe in God. I tried very hard to think positively. Maybe I could purge that terrifying intruder who had begun to reside in my brain!    I attempted to deal with the depression on my own, but the insistent voice became stronger. I reached a point where I figured out a method of suicide and wondered how I should phrase the suicide note that I would leave for my family. One part of my brain mulled these thoughts in a totally irrational manner while the more rational part of my brain knew suicide was wrong and that it would destroy my family. It was almost as though I were two people at times - the person controlled by this insistent voice and the other part of me that loved God and believed that He did have a good plan for my life in spite of the painful trial that I was so deeply immersed in.    My thoughts were centered on how to commit suicide. I knew I was in trouble and needed suicide help. I could not deal with this on my own. The thoughts were too much! I needed help! Deep in my heart, I knew that God loved me. I didn't understand how He could love me, but I believed that He did. I first sought my pastor's wife, a person I respected very much. I was surprised and comforted to know that she had gone through some serious depression and understood what I was going through. She encouraged me to not fear medication and counseling. With a combination of medications, counseling, and God's help, I am greatly improved and no longer depressed. The horrifying intruder has never returned.    If that terrifying intruder has brought thoughts to your mind, don't hurt yourself. You are loved! No matter what your situation is, there is help. Don't be prideful or ashamed like I was. Talk to a doctor, counselor, church leader, or suicide prevention center. Get the help that you need and deserve. You don't need to live in depression or frustration.|`|WjClLsPQaa	well, it depends on whether or not she is hott.  if she is, ask for a copy to keep.  and if not, ask why the hell he has a picture of him and his fugly ex.|`|DnCpBjPDaa	I would confront him about that. Tell him how that makes you feel and go from there.|`|mgGf6t4Naa	say its pics of her butt ugly face or me who leaves|`|aBWT7SbMaa	let him keep it dotn look jealous, at least when u break up with him he will rember u|`|NvycINb7aa	try and delete them, or throw them away!?|`|Hizsm6m4aa	It's one of those things that varies. Like for instance if it hasn't been over 6months he may not feel he needs to get rid of them. If others have tolerated this behavior he may not know better. If they recently broke up/ or remain friends he may feel it's wrong to ge rid of them. Not to say you should be ok with it. You don't wanna come off as jealous or insecure, but let him know that his past is the past and if he is serious about moving on with you it is not respectful for him to keep them around especially since you don't wanna come across them.|`|EfhXEAbHaa	the same thing happened to my friend.  ask him if he still has feelings for his ex and if he does then tell him its not Going to work out because if a guys not committed to u then hes probably not worth it unless u really like him then just talk to him. if u feel weird or uncomfortable seeing the pictures then tell him and if he really likes u he will get ride of them or hide them|`|BSsXQkAJaa	If these pictures bother you, you should explain it to him, ask him why he still has them. maybe there's a reason.

Today I had an idea to get my boyfriend a promise ring. Just a band with something engraved on it. So I went to a Jewelry store and a jeweler recommended a bracelet with a stainless steel plate that you can engrave on, because it has been really popular. So I chose the bracelet.

O6TC4CgRaa	I dont think age is a big deal when it comes to relationship. However, if there's a difference of 10 years, then that would be kind of wierd. Anyways, u two are both old enough, you're 17 and he's 21. It's not like u are 12 and he's 20. Do u get what i mean? U both are mature enough to handle each other.|`|x22uyDa9aa	Age makes a huge difference with where people are in their lives.  If you're just doing this for fun...okay. But be careful because he'll have more mature expectations and may be getting the wrong idea about what this means.    This won't be long term at all...|`|Ed5sIoA2aa	to me no....    im 16 and talkin to a boy whos 19 almost 20.    age doesnt matter me! and if you really like or love this boy dont let him go just because hes a few years older than u!!      good luck.. hope it works out|`|9bZpW5XLaa	No the age doesnt matter,  dont let your mom find you the guy you should.

ksqPjgEUaa	Although it would be ideal to the men/women that can't seem to stay faithful... NO. Marriage is sacred. One man. One woman.   Although I have nothing against a gay or lesbian vowing to their partner as well...   Good topic.|`|79b265d392525b206ff870687ec9a303aa	It's a tough question to ask when you think about how ingrained the one husband, one wife, mentality is in our society.  Personally, I feel that what is good for one couple isn't what is good for another.  So a single universal is insane.  My wife and I are only married to each other and she is the love of my life.  But if there is someone else my wife or I are attracted to, being honest with each other about it has really opened our eyes to the possibilities that there may be so much that people are missing by keeping such tight leashes on each other.      Maybe that is part of the reason so much cheating (unconsentual relations) and divorce is going on.  Do we hold firm to an answer when that answer fails sooo often?|`|lvelp0CGaa	A random topic that JAY brought up duh we aint stupid move on .    I'm all for open relationship's for SOME people not all , polygamy is NOT to be taken lightly and if it were run properly where the husband and the wives are free to leave and re-marry a true love then maybe it would work .    Simple thing is people always term it 1 husband , many wives why cant it be the other way around ? people ask this question to open up societies B.S. attitude yet they cant quite destroy the box so it is ok for women to have many husbands so it still is a man run world even when women ask how stupid is that ?    Not to mention 96% of husband's can NOT satisfy 1 woman sexually how the hell you expect these poor women to get satisfied because in a polygamist world they are not allowed to be bi-sexual true polygamy anyways so what you see on tv is some writer's idealism . They get whipped if they dare to even touch another of the wives .|`|Pj81dRTAaa	Okay, i know i'll probably get many thumb downs for this but, its the reality.    With women, there would be an issue with who the father of a child is. DNA tests aren't foolproof and there is much room for confusion. Also, I doubt any woman would really want more than one husband, unless its just for sex and no love. If that's the case, then its pointless getting married.    With men, this practice exists already and women actually consent to this. IF ALL THE WIVES CONSENT, I see no problem.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	I don' think there's anything wrong with bigamy except that such relationships may have an especially high risk of creating an unstable balance of affection and power. But why shouldn't a lady have the pleasure of having more than one man to give he rpleasure?. Hmm... getting off topic a little...|`|b1e5309d722e5d134ec59e473b707f10aa	No. A marriage is between two people.  Vows. Dedicating their lives to eachother.  If people are not ready to do that, or do not want to do that, then they shouldn't get married.|`|95022b8a93402999302f760e35ffd0daaa	I started that discussion in another forum and I was ejected as a destroyer of morals.  I support either, first there would be fewer divorces. The only thing is there have to be guidelines under which another wife or husband can be introduced in the marriage e.g. the spouse is not getting satisfaction from one of one partner is sick and unable to give or participate in the conjugal rights. Also they partners either the second wife or husband should not be allowed to live under one roof. They should have a home of their own and it is up to to the lead spouse top visit them.  Very interesting topic...maybe more theoretical than practical. Having said this, Muslims can have up to seven wives. I also read somewhere about two or three years ago of a woman who had two husbands somewhere in Kenya.|`|Zg8aORFYaa	no|`|6wzQhsIkaa	i think that it could work.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	Why would you want more than one spouse it may look good on paper, but having more than one bitching wife isn't my idea of Paradise.|`|AA11447210	Actually, that's already been asked here this evening and I think it should be legal so those who desire it can do it. There's no realistic reason not to allow it.    If the government were smart (oxymoron, I know) they'd legalize it and then come up with a creative way to tax it (higher taxes for each successive spouse or something like that). LOL!|`|5IkOaj13aa	Hell no ! Being married is a full time commitment and one that should never be taken lightly. It is difficult enough to handle one marriage let alone many.|`|wzqahEqiaa	No, marriage should be between one man and one woman.    Try watching the TV show Big Love.  They can assign people to different spouses.|`|5jMNBO2naa	no  why?  what would be the purpose  in almost every case  the women have low self sense of self esteem  so it's basically one guy taking advantage of women ( who generally are never reality pretty either.. mere coincidence? )  the other aspect is that usually the women do all the work financially  while the guy sits back and relaxes..      hmmm      wait a minute      why not :)   ( so as long as all the wives are Playboy model material and very sexual in appetite ... )|`|AA12185428	No.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Nope because then it will make it more difficult if a divorce occurs. One wife/husband is enough.|`|lh6e1OiZaa	Perhaps we should concentrate on letting all members of society get married before allowing those who already have the right to do it more than once.

I would cut ties with the dude and never speak to him again.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	Umm i wouldnt be jealous i would be pissed, if i came home and some guy was hanging out with my wife and i was not there.    Jealously comes from within though. Its his own insecurities and lack of confidence that makes him act jealous.  You need to stroke his ego big time.|`|cPpP4BZIaa	Most women who are married , don't have guy friends come to the house . I wouldn't like it if i were married and my wife had guys come over to the house.

Tell him something like 'when you act jealous, you make me feel (fill in the blank) and please stop doing it.  There is no need to feel insecure because I love only you'     You have to keep at it until he stops it.  He will probably argue, justify himself, blame you or whatever, but stick to your guns no matter what he says.  If you don't put your foot down now it will get worse.  Talk to him about why he feels insecure and assure him that he has no need to feel that way.|`|4Z1yW8dBaa	Married women do not have "guy friends" over.  That's just the long and short of it.  Sorry to be so close-minded, but if your guy friends want to bring over a gal and the four of you hang out as two couples, that could work.

Your husband realizes this.|`|z5dN9B3Iaa	Why do you have guy friends coming over to your house? Sorry but I can see you husbands point.|`|LgMoGUoqaa	Guilty Guilty Guilty!

Good Luck|`|hOUEIEmBaa	Well I think its time for him to have girl friends call him and come over to the house. I think that would be great. Then you can have your guy friends that are really only there for one thing. Hoping there going to get a chance at bending you over.

So either your so naive and think them guys are just being nice or your sort of whacked.|`|I2zw4TMSaa	First make sure you are doing everything possible to make your husband know they are just friends. He is your husband and comes before any friend, so if they are causing that much trouble u might have to back away from them a little bit.  He could be insecure, maybe you can help him with that. He might be speaking out of quilt. My husband says that men 'know' men and 'know' whats going through their mind even if they are just friends. its possible ur husband thinks 'hey mrs wife ur pretty hot and i know ur friend thinks so 2 by the way he looks at u'. Men don't usually like to admit when they'ree jealous, and when they do have to admit it they usually don't want to go into detail.  just try and find out exactly what makes him feel this way, and maybe just you being concerned and willing to do whatever will make him feel more at ease.  oh yea and some ppl are just jealous as hell lol in that case ask him how he would feel in he was in ur shoes, or to shut up lol
e3801fbb401743baa0ab90373a0be8ebaa	awww  I'm a natural dancer since I was little  so I'm not sure how to tell you  but I did teach my best friend how to dance    i suggest to you  to go online to some videos  like hip hop dance videos  Flo Rida Low  Ciara "Oh"  or things like that  and watch em    it's all bout feeling the music and moving with it  your hips sway and move with the beats   don't thrash your arms above your head  keep them loose at your side  its okay to raise it once in a awhile    gosh i must be really confusing u  sorry....  in Colby O'Donis  "dont turn back" this girl dances with a guy  maybe you could take moves from his video?|`|MbHwygxbaa	Well usually the guy will lead, basiclly your just kind of leaning againest a guy, its just like how you would normally dance just againest him       hope that helps!|`|AA11709855	Just bend over in front of me.|`|Gburbcuiaa	Eww. Just go up to a guy and rub your butt on him.|`|xETCO0rUaa	You are not alone i asked the same question like yesterday, i'm going to take a dance class with a friend and get a DVD i know im lame|`|MIEGzslNaa	i learned by just doing it. some random guy asked me to dance at my first homecoming, and i was like oh my god i cant dance. but hello, its sooo easy!  all you do is rup your *** against his...er front (i'm trying to be "clean" lol) and sway side to side, and randomly up and down with the beat of the music  and remember, keep the beat in your movement-otherwise you both will be moving differently and it will get soo awkward  i learned just by doing it, and after a few minutes of it, it just seems so easy and you feel ridiculous that you freaked before  so don't worry and go for it!  =]|`|E8PiYH83aa	grinding is when you have someone behind you and you are rubbing against eachother up and down, rofl|`|qinFCuxxaa	rub your butt up against someone.|`|twSD9zHzaa	It comes naturally. don't worry. when it happens, you just go with the flow. you will be great|`|SxNSDYTBaa	omg i use to have this same problem!  Okay, when the guy gets behind you, just follow him. like if he moves his hips to the left, move yours with him to the left. practice with one of your friends, or pracice moving your hips from left to right to some music, that will most likely be playing at the dance.  and when your dancing with him try to move to the beat of the music. try to have some rhythem.   its ok if your thighs start to hurt after a while mine do sometimes.  and you can either place your hands on your thighs...on his hands..or he might take your hands and move them. haha its harrd to explain but have confidence in yourself and tell yourself that you can dance awsome!  i remember having this prob and was soo nervous at my junior prom.   justdancw with a guy your comfortable with, and skae that bootayy! lol  hope this helped!
kbJ34pnoaa	tell the police|`|e3801fbb401743baa0ab90373a0be8ebaa	i know its kinda scary  but think this way: who else did he rape  and who else will he attack next?    First thing to do  whether she lets you or not  is to tell the principal  she can tell her parents or guardians but if she doesn't tell a higher figure  YOU do it. She and any other future victims will be saved from future raping.    The school will call the police and her down to the office. The teacher will be suspended until all accounts are heard from the people raped and then fired.    Please take action. You don't know what else he is doing to other people.|`|Gu0Yofnvaa	omfg ,   first of all , tell the principal , then call the police   the guy should go to hell .|`|QQbbReRAaa	If your serious, you're friend has to tell the police. This guy could do the same thing to another girl, if he hasn't already. It's not only about her, she has to do it for the greater good|`|vRhk1VEfaa	You should tell me where I can find him so I can BEAT THE LIVING SH!T OUT OF HIM. I hate it when ladies get messed with. Its one of the very few things that pisses me off.(or you could call the police, but I prefer my option.)|`|kmLKKGGyaa	omg! wtf! you have to notify the police or the sick bastard will just get away with raping more innocent students, such as yourself, and leaving them in shock then one day one will take their own life believe me. you have to go to the police if your to scared to do that then go to the principal or the counselor of the school tell them and they will notify them.|`|FJZXTLH3aa	thats so stupid...........    you let everything go,     damn you, you better get her rights back, fight to death ,    go and help her, take martial arts classes and knock him out better than to go to police which wont do anything, you better to knock him out and let him bow to you if not then tie him and beat the sht outa him.|`|uz0R5pjHaa	You guys should notify the police and get that mutha fukka arrested!|`|4Vr2zecWaa	WTF. EUWWW. WTFH WTFH WTFH. First of all, if the world didnt care, i'd go over there and cut his dick off. -________-..  but. why didn't she just leave? it's a big place right? no need to be embaressed, fight that perverted ***. turn him into the police o_o omfgg.|`|0894be71d36fb087dd4d64f6446344d8aa	call/tell her parents first even tho it's weird call/tell them first and then they will handle the rest unless they don't care about ur friend, then u can call the police and tell them about what happened.       p.s the teacher can be put to jail so.... yeah guys like him don't deserve to ba a teacher so make sure he gets fired and put to jail.|`|AA10280709	If this is truth and she was coerced she needs to report it. The fact it was a teacher is apprehensible. She needs to tell her parents, the school principle, the school board. A police report and investigation need to be done and he should take all that comes his way with a hung head in shame. The fact that he may lose his degree is besides the point he should have thought of that before hand. There are consequences to every action.   She will have to hold her head high and walk with strength but if truth is behind her she shall be supported greatly.|`|twSD9zHzaa	Well, if I were you, I'd would just talk to her, and tell her that she needs to talk to her professor and tell him to not do that.  Then I would contact the police!  Yeah!!!!!!|`|mQI9N1c6aa	THAT IS SOOOOO FREAKY
UP33GlBwaa	Say hello and ask her how her day is going.  What can I say...it's a starting point.|`|DxohE884aa	Try not sounding like she's a possession. Then maybe she'll like you a little more.|`|UjG8FqLUaa	BE B0LD AND C0NFIDENT.  G0 INTR0DUCE Y0URSELF.  MAKE EYE C0NTACT AND SMILE.  JUST MAKE SMALL TALK.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	you should say "you me party in my pants" that alwayyyys works lol|`|cJooDZpnaa	Just be you'reself and talk to her. And trust me when I say from experience she will be judging more on you're looks than personality so don't worry if you're a little nervouse|`|DrFrkM63aa	just 'accidentally' run into her. ask her name.  start off slow with basic questions.  oh! and give her a complement... girls like that!  good luck!|`|of2sIYtPaa	go up and talk to her and be very confident when you talk to her. be funny also.|`|IdwbQTIaaa	Just be yourself.  Next time you see her, go say hi, but try not to be too shy.  And be funny, girls like guys that can make them laugh!|`|3LB6FPmgaa	Just say hello and introduce yourself she will probally like you back    Take it slow and maybe after a couple weeks of hanging out at school ask her to go to the movies dont be to fast (girls hate that)    Also maybe next week ask her to go out with you and friends with other girls|`|lrJQxohVaa	You cant just get a girl, you have to know her first what if she's like mean or a brat?|`|6kuJgjEhaa	Hey, dude, i've been through that.     Just go up and say hey, then talk about your interests. Casually ask, "Hey, so... you got a phone?" and then, really casually ask her for her number. Text her that night and say she's cute or something, just flatter her but don't go overboard with it. Keep spending time with her and after a week or two, ask her on a date. Maybe after a month of that kind of thing, ask to go steady :)    Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|dbUWukQdaa	start by saying hi one day then later on (another day) say hey and ask her a bit about her and if you don't know if she knows you introduce yourself before its too late!|`|Yo0aKOliaa	Take a look at what books she has and ask her if she can help you study a subject or if you could study with her. Give her your name and look for these signs to tell if she likes you too: If she plays with her hair, pushes her chest out, straightens her posture, faces her whole body towards you, and smiles a lot then she likes you too! Best wishes.|`|tTdhu8Mkaa	just start talking to her every time you see her|`|RpwSjV7daa	aww!.  talk!.  :DD|`|7MSEfa7Oaa	jawww talk to her & be your self! :D|`|CJ43KbjEaa	just b yourself b nice, friendly, outgoing, and funny!|`|ryag9YySaa	Try to get a seat by her! When she doesn't look real busy, try to say something funny. make her giggle. Later, after you get to know her...ask her out! If u guys have similar courses...suggest a study date?
df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	I kind of agree kind of disagree. it kind of depends how you look at the statement. because its really easy to hate someone you love: for example, if a boyfriend/girlfriend dumps you that you loved them it's easy to start hating them because they hurt you so hard. on the other, hand, love and hate are totally different feelings and considered opposites.|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	yes i do|`|6k2lmVChaa	I agree. There are alot of people behind bars because they loved the person so much that when there feelings were hurt or when the person cheated on them or broke up with  them it enraged them to the point of murder.
180rE9rGaa	he is jealous. or he is just trying to get in your pants. you choose.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Hes boosting his ego, and hes hoping to bed you soon, and walk away. hes a con|`|5YdSkO83aa	haha, boys are random.  I think he wanted to just start talking to you.  Or he wanted to see if you knew, like paying attention.|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	He is testing to see if you can be part of a secret spy agency.  You passed the first test.|`|EdidZdtlaa	lol he was nervous he didnt know what else to do or say|`|g7uMKvEzaa	He was probably just trying to get your attention and see if you answered him at all...He was nervous probably because he didn;t know what to say and wanted you to notice and talk to him..|`|A2u06IS1aa	FLIRTING! totally. But usually the guys will say you have pretty eyes. But i guess its his way of flirting haha(: And he probably got nervous and he didnt know what to say|`|vKrWrhQeaa	he wants to see if you were actually paid attention  or if you once bothered to look into his eyes|`|V4PMErjyaa	boys are random and say weird things when they're nervous!   He was probably just doing some sort of strange icebreaker, so he could talk to you!|`|XzLUA7ataa	He wanted to know how much you had observed about him and his face and whether or not you observe the same details about others.|`|O8pPNMm8aa	he likes u lol|`|8DhXfDXUaa	he likes you duh or maybe he is seeing how well u pay ation to things|`|qVL5R8nuaa	I wouldn't read too much into that. He was just flirting. He hardly knows you (4 days).|`|w1uHv3Ikaa	I think he was just trying to start a conversation,and was bored, or he was trying to flirt with you,and didn't know how to,so he just mumbled on about his eyes and his friends! He might also like your eyes :)  haha L.A Baby, the city L.A.?|`|HN1zYwbFaa	boys are odd....|`|0Ie7UWVIaa	its called flirting|`|5j9bRHs9aa	He's flirting with you.  Big time(:|`|f3160ee0ccd0529510bb499fae259b31aa	he was just trying to keep the convo going...i think he likes u and he ran outta things to say xD|`|9di4fdO3aa	I think he was trying to see if you studied him or not. Probably to see if you were checking him out. I think he likes you.|`|Xd0HKmfvaa	He wants to know if you spend enough time looking at him and like thinking he's "cute" to know what color his eyes are. When you said what color his BFF's eyes are...wow...catch my flow? :)      Do you like him?|`|SzQKCeRqaa	He wanted to see if you paid attention to him anymore or less than you did to his friend. He likes you probably.|`|350fb7cfcbe5d931fc0817f002ab8283aa	you may be reading into this so much...i wouldnt sweat it|`|6M036LkQaa	He likes you.  The fact that you payed enough attention to him really made him happy becasue he thought that you may like him also.  When you knew his best friend's eye color, he got a little uneasy because he did not like the thought of you paying attention to him, also.|`|EnVYsBRwaa	sounds like an attention whore...who may also be unsure about how he stacks up to his friend..|`|2uXNtCUlaa	I have no idea to be honest..maybe you should ask him this question|`|Pwqx6yZvaa	This is the best ive got.   my hairdresser and i are really close and she told me guys always mean what they say and say what they mean. most guys are either too stupid or dont want to do those hidden meanings. so i bet u he was just bored. it prob. was nothing.|`|XoYMRvtDaa	he wanted to know how much you paid attention to him, and he was happy when he realized that you paid a lot of attention to him. But he was jealous that you also paid attention to his best friend. he likes you.|`|pRF5LLloaa	It is just an immature party game. It is a form of selfishness. He is REALLY asking, "Have you been looking at ME!? Have you been paying attention to ME!?"    It means nothing.  If it were important, he would have asked, "Let me guess the color of YOUR eyes"  This would show that he is interested in you.    People like this haven't fully grown up yet.  You need to hang with some new people.|`|AA11376151	he's a SPECIAL one lol   umm...stay away from him lol|`|isPxtl3oaa	i think hes into u. u were alone in a room and he wanted to see how much attention u paid to him. by asking about his friends eyes he was seeing if it was special to him or not. the whole getting shaky was probably because he thought u would figure out what he had meant by it. if u like him let him kno if not tell him he reminds u of a brother or something, thats the way i make guys back of and be just friends|`|o1vXdBIxaa	He was tryin to make conversation Bbe. He likes You but he is nervous x|`|3h3m2UAOaa	he probably was hoping you guys were gonna kiss or something of that nature but i guess it failed lol|`|HCvNfdqwaa	maybe he was flirting or something|`|IlDIUuB9aa	BOYS????? Who knows what they are|`|0c7f90870a573719359927fff0e69d05aa	maybe cuz he thought you were check ing him out? lol  or he was probably supremely nervous and trying to cover it up with being hella awkward.|`|5qRMUug0aa	He likes you!!!! He was just saying that to make conversation and be able to have a conversation between just you and him. Congratulations!!!|`|jddxzWp8aa	well he wants to know of you notice him or look at him at all because he obviously likes you.|`|c5945tSvaa	ur so slow..     all he meant by that was that he wants to get with you, and he is wondering if his best friend could join     (somewhat like a threesome)     the old eye trick, u should know that by now...|`|rS7Ggnslaa	3-some. you, him and his BFF.  it's so obvious.|`|aKDsbpwAaa	he prolly ran out of stuff to say and wanted to keep talking so he randomly did that and he was shaky because he wouldnt have anything to say after that and he was nervous|`|BusBahLvaa	well my first guess would be that he was attempting to make small talk since you both were there together.  The silence probably would have been awkward.  Also depending on your age he might not have had that many relationships.  Though he may also have been nervous about having a lil crush on you and spat out the first thing that came into his mind.  Just keep an eye out and see if you notice anymore strange or erratic activity in the way he talks to you and you may get a conception of how he feels about you and how strong. :-D|`|Q8QQpKPUaa	lol, he likes you! and he was trying to bring out a funny, nonsense conversation...! naw, that's sweet :)|`|n5zZkbqNaa	uhm, okay.  he's either:    1. openly and obviously flirting with you, excited that you noticed his eye color    2. he's gay and has a crush on his best friend and didn't know how to bring it up    or    3. he's just odd, which explains all boys.    ask him straight-up why he did what he did. he'll probably answer.  if he's cute, give him a chance:)  lol|`|dAOUmE2Xaa	he wants to play with you.  plz answer my question plz  put this------------------->ylt=AmOE6hh.NHaz...    next to yahoo.com /answers  cause i keep getting code error 999 when i pout a link|`|UheUvWxnaa	Wow...  Well I can't just tell you. It could be anything...  but it could be, he was trying to just talk to you, and started rambling about some really random subject just so he could talk. That's just my guess!! Good-Luck!!
67f09cd66006674e278eeda3288a990faa	everyone that has answered so far has translated this phrase literally, and what they said does not exactly make sense. my answer is:    ?por qu una chica tan linda como t no tiene un novio?    which, translated, means: why does a girl as sexy as you not have a boyfriend?    it gets the same message across, and is grammatically correct, which will also earn you sexy points. lol|`|BD5WT4uZaa	PLEASE pick maddie c because everyone else has flunked|`|jki8W5khaa	como es que una mujer tan bonita como tu no tiene un novio?|`|x22uyDa9aa	?Como puedes tu--un mujer muy bonita, no tienes un hombre?

AlNu3kKraa	okay im going to be straight up about this.  MOST girls look at looks first.  me... i look at a guys eyes  and if they find the guy attractive then they look for things they have in common...girls don't like stubborn guys...you have to be open and up for anything.  girls don't like guys that are to...girly.  we like nice bodies and I personally like guys who aren't afraid to tell a girl how they feel about them and i like guys that are fun and outgoing.  its not just looks...its compatibility....hope this helped|`|z2EPIm1Qaa	if you make them feel like their special and perfect in every way. but not be creepy about it,|`|dKxrbUQZaa	I don't think any girl really only likes certain qualities in a guy. I usually end up liking people who interest me, there qualities could be anything. I think I have more of conditions.... cause a lot of different characteristics I would like... like I'd like a funny or a serious guy, things like that. Although 79% of girls will probably say "FUNNY! SMART! SENSITIVE!" or "BAD BOY! ADVENTUROUS!" things like that. Believe me, they probably will like other characteristics, and not know it yet. I can't explain exactly how crushes work, but I know that people aren't programed to always like the same kind of guys.|`|YKK0IBbhaa	What I look for is a great personality and a smile that makes me melt!|`|bG8mEUHhaa	all girls r different n lke different things frm guys.|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	mostly a sweet personality  should be somewhat cute  genuinely cares about our feelings|`|Q7waImMRaa	yeah i'm with jessica J ...oh and they have to mell good lol|`|EQ4q0Lf5aa	I like a guy with a cute face, nice build but not overly muscular, nice to me, and funny!!!|`|s4TMc1vqaa	I look for a guy that can make me laugh and doesn't have to try to hard.

WRcbYyroaa	I know how you feel. I have family too that sometimes don't always do the wisest things (IE: Excessive Drinking, etc.). The best thing you can do is hang out with her more. Abandoning her now, or not really hanging-out with her will leave her with no one who is really there to serve as the "other-side" of her peer-pressure.    The reason I say this is because right now, she has most of her friends all partying with her (which is cool), but she has no one on the other side to help her gain some perspective (or realty checks), when she goes overboard/excessive.    You can also tell her that even though it sounds lame, her actions now will have some HUGE ramifications later in life (like College/Grad School admittance, Job Offers, etc.). Just let her Google "Facebook Horror Stories", and tell her that's just a small sample of people who's lives were ruined because of what they perceived as cool and wanted to share with the world on social site like MySpace and Facebook (IE: small mistakes), snowballing into huge, hard-to-remove consequences later in life.    Let her know (not in a demeaning way either, but as a friend and loved-one), that she can have fun, she can post stuff on her Facebook and MySpace...but, remember that once it's up, it's up there for a lifetime. So think things through: is that something you'd want a potential company to see? Or, a school? Or, how about your kids years from now?    Let her know that she has to be smart when she posts stuff on Facebook and MySpace. Party pics are definitely okay to post, but post the ones where everyone is having casual fun, not where your doing upside-down drinking contests in your bikini while someone attempts to do body-shots from you.    Show her both sides. The Google recommendation I mentioned above will show her what happens when you go overboard, and then you can show her the flip-side of Facobook profiles where people post stuff of them having fun but it's within means (IE: social parties, birthdays, casual bar parties, etc.). Where she (and your other female family members younger than you), can see that you can have fun, share it, and be smart about it too...or, take the alternative and be screwed for the rest of your life.    Hope that helps, and good luck. It would be nice to know that this turns out good for all of you, so lemme know. Good luck.
OzLm0sF0aa	yes you have a chance with her. funny thing is tho, im in more or less the same shoes as u are in except the girl's stilll taken so im screwed more than you bro. anyway, i met her at work and she's probably THE most fantastic person i've ever met. i did fall in love with her but again, she's got a bf. she did fall in love with me also but then she backed out cuz of the whole bf issue. but keep at it. im definitely going to keep going on mine. if you think she's worth the fight, i say go for it. it's hard to find a good girl these days. do what you gotta do to keep her, even if it means moving to her. and yea, we have a tendency to not let go of things that are good. it's ok tho man, go for her.|`|IJwlglqaaa	sounds sort of like my situation. i think that you have 2 options. either wait it out and see if she comes back to you, but keep in touch. or confess how you feel about her and tell her you'll wait for her so she knows exactly what you feel for her. tell her everything you just wrote. if it doesn't work, what could it hurt. i really hope she comes back to you|`|b1a7294223f3b0fc270be52d3ed1fbc5aa	she is a flake.  And I'm sorry, she doesn't have a big heart.  To make out with you and then reject you, and then tell you she's in love with someone else. Ye, what a flake.  I know you are probably sick of hearing this, but you can do better.  Start dating other girls. The moment you stop giving this girl so much attention (texting, calling,etc) she will probably flake out (again).  She has too much control of your emotions and she knows it. And honestly, maybe she really doesn't like you.....take her clues as hints.  Has there ever been a girl who has liked you and you didn't like her?  When she called you, didn't you think...."God just leave me alone?"|`|F13QmUIlaa	yea you got a good chance, she'll come around
KSf9t0Vnaa	this guy chris is really into you still and is just letting you know. he is trying to give you all the obvious signals that he likes you. i think he wants to let you no that he still has feelings for you and wants to know if you feel the same way.  try to tell him if you like him and if not tell him you just dont feel like that about him any more. if you hav 2 tell him you dont like him let him down easily cuz it sounds to me like it would behard to lose a friend as good as him. hope my advice helped good luck.|`|610c57fdea7d5e585bcc43fbea02a105aa	ask him..hes the only one who knows i cant read his mind|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Chris has just figured out he has hormones and he is seeing you as probable more than a friend now.  How old are the both of you?  Maybe he is going through puberty and his hormones are raging.  Talk to him about what he is going through.
6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	If there are any clubs you can join that are outside of your school then you should.  It will help you to meet people you do not go to school with.  You can try the community college that have swimming and other pe activities that you can take without having to be a student there.  If you attend church you can look at that to see what they offer the young people.|`|1t7Gu2swaa	what do you like doing?  you could join a club to do with your hobbies+meet new people that like the same stuff as you (:
IKmskGiHaa	Gee, a smart girl at a bookstore, hmmm, must be a God!|`|diQ0oodqaa	Yes, God has got to be an interesting guy.    Sounds like she was sent to you, enjoy and have a great friendship!|`|UjG8FqLUaa	THAT`S S0 CUTE. BUT N0 THAT`S NEVER HAPPENED T0 ME. IN M0ST CASES PE0PLE TELL ME I L00K MEAN S0 THEY D0N`T APPR0ACH ME.|`|AA12290249	haha well congrats.|`|XzLUA7ataa	You just answered your own question it seems.|`|GmTMVmASaa	there is someone for everyone, and yes God is rather awesome.|`|gxnXbftHaa	that's a cute story to tell people|`|mF4tms9maa	Hahahahahah    .....    sorry thats my awnser ^^|`|AA12365984	Because girls love math!    Honestly, it is great you clicked. Don't question why, just give thanks that she met you and not another guy in class.|`|DnCpBjPDaa	Well it could possibly mean that she just might be the one for you. She saw you doing something that she is really interested in.....God works in mysterious ways....|`|dAOUmE2Xaa	cool ur so cool i cant get a girl asians cant get girls. and im not even full asian im half white and half asian lol
3mb5IV1Zaa	I'm giving him an album of boudoir photos of me :o). I have a friend that's a professional photographer. LUCKY!|`|Hizsm6m4aa	an Ipod and tool kit.|`|81wvN8Rraa	A home theater set to go on his big *** tv|`|0viZhxi6aa	He has to work until 9 pm but after that I will make him something nice for dinner, put the baby down, put the older kids to bed and let him have .............. anything he wants.............LOL|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Nothing    True Love is 365 days a Year not Just one Day on a Calender
DUOoMBqoaa	A low life is someone who brings other people down. You on the other hand might just be a good person who is bored,  depressed, or shy. Try getting out more even if it's just to go for a walk or run a few errands. Try talking to the people around you and reaching out. Doing something for someone else is usually a great mood lifter and inspiration. If you are in college, there must be activities that you can get involved in. Get out there, don't waste your life!|`|4hr9JGAdaa	somebody who doesnt do anything to help themselves, or sulks around and does nothing. maybe your just to busy.
E9t8Fmctaa	Be friends!  While your friends you can get too actually know him. Then he will realize he still wants and needs you so he will come back.|`|71VRvldJaa	You don't tell him!  There's a reason people from your past don't make it to your future!  It didn't work the first time because you had nothing in common so it isn't going to work if you try it again.  Why invest so much emotional energy trying to desperately find things in common when there's someone else out there who would be a perfect match for you!  Sometimes liking/loving someone just isn't enough, no matter how hard you try.|`|s4TMc1vqaa	I think you should tell him what you just said in the 3rd line!|`|ryag9YySaa	Tell him exactly how you feel! (keep in mind opposites attract)
S8CZBCe2aa	Tell him to get naked and meet you in the bedroom - pop your head around the door and don't go anywhere say I'll be right back!  Go to the store, when you get back many hours later he might be more willing to tell you where he is at!|`|Tbhmsrlsaa	Uhh. wow. Why would you ask that? He probably has a reason. Like maybe a valentines gift........... Just ask him|`|1hciyvKdaa	What could it be, if its not your anniversay, birthday or valentines day, what else can it be? Those trips are either illegal or to see a woman not matter what you think.  Scoring or selling drugs is about the only thing men duck out of the house for if its not a woman.   If your not ready to confront him, the second he returns walk past him coming in and say be right back, now you go to the neighbors or your best friends house where he knows her bf or hubby is there so you cant be accused of lying.   Open your eyes, men do not do that to someone they truley love, that shows no respect for you or the marriage.   No woman, yes, no woman is safe from a cheating man. Dont give yourself that much credit.|`|INkafu0uaa	all of the men in my life say this too me my husband my dad RIP and my brothers ! i hate it but i thought it was just a guy thing !|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Follow him and see what he does.|`|trQ4vqx4aa	Wow, sounds a bit controlling to expect him to tell his wife everywhere he goes. A wife is not a mother, and a Husband is old enough to do as he pleases without asking permission.    He needs his space and his privacy. Respect these two things and the relationship will benefit.|`|jiwTWNNtaa	Guys are different than girls and are more likely to take some "me" time rather than exploding later. My hubby will go out for a coffee and come back an hour later. He's just driving around aimlessly. I get mad because I'm busy in the house or whatever but I also know that he was just relaxing alone for a little while. I'd do good to follow his example and take off for an hour.    Sometimes he'll go visit his friend, I get mad but I shouldn't. I should take a break and go visit my friend sometimes too. Just because I don't take good care of my own needs, doesn't mean I should beat him up for taking care of his.    That said, just keep an eye open for weirdness. My dad used to disappear for hours and hours at a time for a gallon of milk or to return a library book and come back roaring drunk. Make sure substance abuse isn't the issue.|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	He doesn't respect you or he feels like he doesn't need to tell you where he is handling his bizzness.|`|Nzc7t6KEaa	Smell his breath when he comes back. He might be getting high.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	Hi, honey. Smooches. (Kiss him.) If you are SURE... then maybe he is just picking lint out of the dryer or something... at the laundromat... around the way...|`|81wvN8Rraa	I would tell him I would like to know where is going b/c I'm concerned about him.|`|MkImXLulaa	say '' what happened at( whatever he told you he was doing" see if he hesitates or seems like he is improvising as he tells you.|`|xMt0gktCaa	All men are alike the I'll be right back phrase means that there going somewhere and are going to come after an hour if you are sure he is not cheating then ask him where he was and if he doesn't tell you then there is a chance that he is cheating on you but if he does answer and he sounds confident then he isn't you can tell if they sound confident or not by hearing how fast they talk.|`|iD4ejChZaa	sex or drugs|`|abd7734e08dd3cfd2f4b4f272c03f4f1aa	i would try to like follow him with out him knowing. more then likely he is on the way to a fantasy sport team.  I would try to see what he is doing|`|DbDMNf0Xaa	you should say did you have fun!!!|`|zdPqht41aa	just ask him where hes going but sound curious    not demanding hes probly just doing work stuff or sumthing since you say hes not cheating but then again how would you know?|`|6EIdLkS7aa	I'd just ask him to let you know next time that he'll be gone more than 20 minutes or something  (or if something came up - doesn't he have a cell he can call u on?)|`|CUsqvrDPaa	Well how do you know that he's not cheating? I'm sorry but if he's away for longish periods of time without offering explanations than the only explanation I can think of is that he's hiding something from you. When he comes back, I would keep it casual and not overly confronting, but just ask, where has he been and see how he responds.|`|HDFsvJMTaa	Ask him where the hell he's been and let him know for future reference this type of behavior is NOT going to work. What if something happened to him? You don't know where he is.... Fix this now. When either of us go, we say where we're going. Done.|`|7VxNpWepaa	Call him on his cell phone..or  Wait up for him and ask him where he was.  tell him If you had an emergency how would you get in touch with him? He needs to tell you where he is going!|`|DYm8rPpyaa	Red flag unless hes coming home with a gift or dinner I WOULD  see a big red flag, Has he changed his attitude maybe taking more showers chagning clothes shoping for new ones?  5. He's Pulling "Houdinis"  If he's disappearing, traveling, or unavailable to the point where you are starting to wonder, then he could be cheating. Also, these times tend to take on a pattern because it's tough to synch up schedules, especially in secret.   9. Your Gut Tells You So  Don't ignore your sixth sense. People are gifted at sensing when something doesn't feel right. Whether there are red flags in your relationship that are clueing you in or not, if something feels off, don't ignore this feeling. Usually that suspicion is correct, and something intangible may have led to you figuring it all out.|`|akqFQ00Paa	When he comes home dont JUMP ON HIM about it-ya kno  act casual ask if he had fun or somthin  if he keeps doin it just casualy ask where ya goin or if you can come along ur tired of sitting @ home you just want to get out for a lil'      i guess,  If you iRELE! get paranoid then have a friend he doesnt kno fallow him|`|gCCkDLMHaa	well a person that i know was doing that and telling his wife that he would be right bacj and come to find out he was cheating on her and when she confronted  him he said nothing was goin on and they got into this big *** argueement besacuse he was saying that he needs is space and thats not a good thing i honestly dont think that you could smother someone with love but you can, im not telling you that he is cheating on you but just chgeck up on him and dont let him know anything i mean what could it hurt just don confront him about it because men hate to be confronted aboput stuff. So, i wouldnt say noothing to him and that get someone to watch your kidz if you have any get someone to come over and sit with them for a second. If you dont have kidz whats stoping you from goin with him there are ways to get around so that you know what hes doing and he thinks you have no idea and you trust him!|`|fMDS4vTGaa	He's awfully inconsiderate and I'd have a hard time trusting someone that can't follow up on their word.    You may say he isn't cheating, but why is he taking off for long stretches and not telling you where he's going? What's he hiding?    Maybe you should stop caring about where he is and when he'll be back, which I guess means you'll have to consider yourself living alone and that he can't be relied on for anything.    Some man you've got there.|`|Hizsm6m4aa	When he comes back sniff him, not sure for what(boyfriend's idea) If you're sure he wouldn't cheat on you then give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it's about something embarrassing. Normally this is abnormal for a husband, so you guys do need to talk about this.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	You his momma or wife? This is why some marriages fail - because men get treated like children by there wives, then the wife whinges that he wont have sex with me anymore - but no man wants to have sex with someone like his momma. Let him be.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	I'd just ask him where he was, thats all.  Its a reasonable question to ask.      If he has nothing to hide, he shouldnt have problem answering it truthfully.    Let him know that it worried you, that you'd rather tell each other where you going, to keep communication open between yourselves, and not just get lazy or secretive.   I am NOT saying he needs to ask your permission. But he could at least just say "going to the shop", or "going to Bob's place" or whatever, on his way out the door.|`|L3hc9EOiaa	have you never gone out for a few minutes to clear your head, OMG I have read some of the comments written and I am wondering how many of you are still married, cause I can tell you most of the writers would see my door closed rather quickly, I have never seen so many suspicious people in my life, cant a person go out for an hour without being the subject of an inquisition. My wife and I dont question each other at all, we trust each other without question. Usually I find that only cheaters fear being cheated on, the same as liars suspect being lied to, look to your self and ask, do I love him/her enough to trust him/her?  If the answer is no, then you have greater problems than a missing hour.|`|mgwiuZT0aa	Aren't you naive. A man doesn't have to dress up to have sex. He is going to take the clothes off anyway so why would he dress up for that. You're assuming he isn't cheating because of his outfit. Not good.    I would tell him nicely that what he is doing is bothering you. If he keeps it up then it is time for you to be right back and be actually be gone for hours in your sweat pants and t-shirt and see how happy he be about that.|`|jnW1hEWJaa	fantasy basketball.  Give him his space.|`|w9Ydp6idaa	relax.. let him now he scared you and talk it through|`|AA12365984	it is a power thing.    Men do not like being questioned.    I would not be there when he got back.... what is good for the goose is good for the gander.|`|wHEV7BqUaa	just tell him that you'd appreciate it if he'd tell you where he was going next time.  sometimes guys get caught up and lose track of time. he might have gone out for one thing and realized he needed to do something else, too.  he could've seen someone he knew and stopped to have a conversation.  don't flip out on him or anything  but he does need to know how you feel about it.|`|HuL6bKNMaa	Yeah, that is a little weird. You should try doing the same thing and see what he says or if he cares. Sometimes, being a guy, I'm too lazy to explain things properly and end up telling people (my mom or gf) just not to worry about it. If it becomes a problem, I would recommend telling him it bothers you. Express you aren't worried about him cheating or anything like that, but that it just bothers you that for over an hour you have no idea where he is or what he's doing. Maybe he just needs an hour to clear his head and have "his" time.
xYTagSIyaa	When you are a teen and dating you are not serious with any one guy, dating three in a day is just a way to get to know them.  If nothing physical went on it does not make sense that they would be like this.  In any case, no man has the right to call any woman that under any circumstance.  It seems to me he/ the guy who phoned was so into you, he never got over you and he is viciously trying to hurt you the way he once was hurt by your actions.  He had no right to do what he did.  It shows a great deal of immaturity and bad mannerss on his part.  It is good you did not wind up with him.  I hope your husband has the good sense to let this slide and not bring it up again.  I also hope you can let it go, showing that you are the better person, by not letting it get under your skin.  His true colours are seen, in what kind of a mess he has made with his own life.  Just ignore him and know in your heart he wouldn't be trying to hurt you the way he has if he was a well mannered young man or if he didn't at one time care a lot about you.  Lucky you,  you made two good choices one you did not chose him, two you chose your husband, and leave it at that.|`|xYTagSIyaa	When you are a teen and dating you are not serious with any one guy, dating three in a day is just a way to get to know them.

That's kind of immature.|`|cdQryr7paa	This dude Jake obviously hasn't found himself a life in the last 12 years if he is still hung up on all that high school drama.  You and your hubby just laugh about it and just let it go.  If you get mad, this Jake guy accomplishes what he set out to do, and he wins.  Be the grown up, and just let it go.  If Jake wants to stay 15 years old for the rest of his life, that's his problem.|`|JplOzo2Yaa	Let's see...who has the loose morals here?    A.  You, for going on three dates in one day when you were 15, even though you didn't have sex with them.  B.  Jake, who got a girl pregnant out of wedlock, cheated on his wife, and lied to your husband about your sexual behavior?    I'd have to go with B.      Don't worry about Jake.  You've got a husband and a baby, and he's got child support payments to one woman and a broken marriage with another, which are his own damn fault.  Some people never outgrow high school, and have to try to drag happier people down with them when they wreck their own lives.|`|uhc1MCDzaa	Why would you ask the question Am I a slut? You were 15! Kids make mistakes.  Everyone in this story needs to grow up, including you. Who cares to compare his (Jake) indiscretions with yours, except immaturity!  Tell your husband, "I won't be held accountable now for some foolishness as a kid and frankly since I didn't know you, its none of your business!"  The way I conduct myself as your wife is your business and obviously I am a good wife. End of discussion."  Don't reciprocate any ill will with Jake. It will only give him a sick satisfaction. Ignore him. If he ever speaks of it again to you just laugh and say: "Oh that. We had a good laugh at the immaturity you showed." Then walk away or hang up the phone.|`|f6RCFUNwaa	if you have to question yourself, the answer is probably yes|`|F13QmUIlaa	wow! so ummm what was the question?? Oh yeah, no ur not a ****.|`|FZLiRKIjaa	If your husband is bothered by something someone said who only knew you in school then he and you have problems.

Run a bubble bath and ask your husband to join you.|`|ka2Qo6cgaa	Haha, when your really think about it its pretty funny.    Girl I would not even worry about it, like you said it was 12 years ago and that shows you how much he matured. The fact that he is about 27 years old and he still is angry about something like that is the most hilarious thing I have ever heard. You and your husband just need to sit back and laugh on that one.    And you're not a whore,its not like you had sex with them. You were just dating and looking at your options. When you are shopping for a dress you don't buy the first one you see you like. You look around and find the perfect one.|`|HDFsvJMTaa	That doesn't make you a ****. How did he get your number??? Tell your hubby in a brief synopsis what happened when you all were FIFTEEN and let him know that the idiot has growing up impairments and that if he calls back, he should give him a piece of his mind for talking about his wife in such a way! This is NOTHING for him to get upset over. It was WAY back then.|`|b7xKoYqBaa	I wouldn't say you're a ****, but incredibly naive (at 15). I'm not sure what you really want me to say, but I don't think you did anything wrong. I know its hard, but you really need to let this thing go, if its true what you said about the other guy you dated at 15, it sounds like he is taking out his anger on you. Don't give him the satisfaction of reacting. The only thing you can do is apologize for the situation, treat him with respect, and hope for the best. You can't control other people, even if it is sometimes for the best!     P.S. That is a pretty funny story. I find it hard to believe that the guy takes it so seriously still to this day. Don't take life so seriously! Laugh it off.|`|8v40KEd0aa	Ya know what, let those people think what they want and go on with your life. Just forget about it.  Really, fu*k what they think or say.|`|81wvN8Rraa	None of that really matters if your husband still loves you.|`|gRLquASnaa	obviously you are not a **** all you need to do is tell your husband the story he will understand and he is not one to judge only God can do that. Your husband will more than likely laugh it out with you.|`|hOUEIEmBaa	LOL 15 years ago you may have been considered one by a few guys that couldn't do you and maybe a few that did. But over all your not a ****. As far as the dude calling your husband. That dude needs to be messed up real bad. Your husband should be a gentlemen and go kick the crap out of him for talking about his wife that way. And your very right he probably hasn't much room to talk. I am pissed off just thinking about the cowardly little bastard calling your husband and then your husband getting in your face. I do not know what to tell you, I am not up on all this divorcing crap and think most things can be worked out but I think in this situation I would be packing and gone for awhile to clear the air and get a few things straight between the hubby before coming back. He took the side of some guy on crap that happened 15 years ago. Ladies that is disrespectful you all ***** and moan about a guy looking at other women and porn. But this case here is considered disrespectful to your spouse. Your husband needs his *** kicked right along with that other dude.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Going out on 3 dates in one day does not make you anything.... other than lucky to have 3 dates in one day.  If you had sex with all 3 of them on the same day.. well yeah thats a whole lot slu**y.  But whatever it was, its all in the past anyway, history, over.  We all do stupid things in our teenage years, we just try everything before we buy it basically, and our experiences teach us what is right or wrong for us.  It doesnt mean because you do something once it becomes a lifetime habit.  I'm sure you husband is smart enough to know this, and know that you are a faithful wife and good mother, and your teenage years are history.  Talk to him, explain that other guy is a just a jealous boyfriend from the old days. Your husband will probably just laugh and think what a loser and ignore the situation.|`|qzK7sFRuaa	What you did in your youth doesn't matter. The way you act now is important. And no, your not a ****.|`|Hd7tFHN7aa	at 15 you dated three guy's in one day, dating is not sleeping with, so dating is not being a ****.  To me a **** was the girl that had sex with all of the guy's that took her anywhere.    you sound to me like your being hard on yourself.      I would tell your husband the truth here and give him the guys name and the ex wife's name and go with him to talk to this guy and his ex to be.      Or maybe if your man is not into rumors, then tell him what you did at 15 and ask him the question your wrote her, or show him what you wrote here and get his feed back.    as for this guy, the jerk, he is a looser and needs to meet a big brother for a few minutes in his life and see what it is like to face up to what he said about someones Sister.    I have a few mins. free if you don't have a big brother, and I need lunch in return, and a coke and fries too.|`|lvelp0CGaa	If you didnt perform oral satisfaction on any of them and they on you and no intercourse was involved then no this is just society showing its childishness and jealousy in 1 go .|`|X7Lcq0vRaa	what's your number fine mami?|`|HhKisHTiaa	No, you're not a ****. What the other guy did to you and your husband was very immature. The man is not even bitter, he's just looking for someone to take his anger out on, but a classmate from twelve years ago is not the answer.|`|95022b8a93402999302f760e35ffd0daaa	No you are not a s__t. What happened and unfortunately people want to drug us to the past when we have already moved way past. Do not allow yourself to be taken that route, that is a battle you fought and won, it's gone there is nothing ot fight for and this guy had no business bringing up that issue to your hubby.    Now the best you can do is to tell you hub what happened do not spare him ...because you do not know what he has been told. Tell him that happened you were  young and it never happened again.   We all have dark closet, and he should be man enough to let go.    I'm sorry that your life is being rocked by a fallout jerk, move on with your life, its the best you can do.|`|vT4l2caVaa	Ummmmmm your friend told you to do it I'm like only a teen and would never do that but I don't judge. that was a long time ago and this dude, Jake? what is up with that? He should worry about himself and stop basing your personality now on what it was when you were 15 and your FRIEND told you to go do what you did.
2Xh1ywWRaa	im afraid i would say it as it is tell him you need your privacy too|`|lf4Qj1T8aa	Maybe you should suggest he get his own computer, or chip in for one.    (BTW, there are a lot of really cheap laptops on the market these days! You can get a pretty good one for $900, which isn't that much if you split it two ways!)
Xf9vSIixaa	you should ask him if he wants to get pizza or something after you work on the project for awhile.. then that should give you enough alone time where you two can talk and maybe develop the relationship into something more. without moving too fast. good luck :]
180rE9rGaa	her wig is falling off.|`|3BrOSZujaa	2 of either if there were any more signs she's crushing on you! If it was just that once she was just fixing it.|`|z2EPIm1Qaa	umm... okaay, last time i checked girls could run their hand through their hair?|`|0PbYE3M7aa	Lice Check.|`|S852p6SXaa	its a way of flirting, attracting the opposite sex. everybody flirts, half the time we dont know we're doing it. it just naturally happens. Or she could of just been fixing her hair, you know how girls are when it comes to our hair. XD|`|UjG8FqLUaa	WELL I KN0W WHEN I D0 THAT IT MEANS THAT I`M INTIMIDATED BY A GUY`S PRESENCE AND FEEL A BIT SELF C0NSCI0US.

That's like asking what does it mean if a guy blinks whe you walk past him or something.|`|EfhXEAbHaa	it probably means nothing. a lot of girls run their hands through their hair. i run my hand through my hair all the time.  sometimes girls do that to see if their hair is soft and clean or to brush out any tangles they might have|`|HCvNfdqwaa	she wants you|`|WFXh3lGnaa	Uhh.. well acctually guys  Everygirl can run their fingers threw her hair when its either in her face or just wants to play with her hair,  Its commn. i do it all the time  ...

kItRaRmlaa	who d hell CARES?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    look just grow up eh..................a smart woman does what she WANTS!!!!!!!!!!!!! GEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!|`|lKRrQrvPaa	Depends on the guy.|`|EQ4q0Lf5aa	depends on how you look when you do it|`|WPfj646yaa	backcombs ???  wat is tat|`|nX9eoEZ8aa	when you say backcombing are you refrering to the method of using a backcomb to dread hair? If so I love it.|`|qwVruoJ8aa	i can not answer this question whit out a picture|`|Sh9vS1Djaa	yeah it is kinda stupid|`|6kuJgjEhaa	I do... depends on the guy, I guess. I prefer a natural look, with a center parting.
X1BaGr0kaa	She's your mom! I'm sure she doesn't hate you!!  I know how important having a reliable mom in your life is, though, so it is definitely worth bringing up to her sometime. Tell her you wish you two could be a lot closer. There is not even a possibility that she hates you!|`|ZpR57jbBaa	That dosent sound like she hates you maybe your just being a annoying smart alleck (sp?)  Well tell her you love her and if she says your being smart then get some help|`|UhVT8zRPaa	SHE DONT HATE YOU!she is just mean!jk|`|bdc65f06d5f0eaa70856c37ce528082faa	I went through something similar with my mom. She would tell me that I was a smart a*  or she didn't like me. I found out later that I just reminded her ALOT of my father. It took awhile but the relationship eventually changed and now we are very close. I don't know how old you are but can you sit down and talk to her - or maybe go for therapy. Unfortunately parents don't always think before they speak either.
8vcU9F2Jaa	She sounds like she's going down the wrong path, but since you said she used to be Shy and Quiet, she may not be used to all this. It may be a lot of fun for her since she's never done it. I'd say tell her yourself first and try to get her to understand. Wait a week and see if there's any improvement, then tell her parents.|`|XPV7Rea1aa	She definitely is. Try talking to her and if that doesn't help the next best thing would be letting her parents know. Letting her parents know maybe the hardest thing but if you really want to save her that's your best bet. Good luck. :)
IdwbQTIaaa	I don't think theres any way of doing that without being totally obvious, and I don't know if he would appreciate walking around with a bulge in his pants!  I've turned my boyfriend on by pretending to whisper in his ear and just give it a little nibble, he loves that!|`|x3NIn6rSaa	rub his inner thigh|`|UjG8FqLUaa	JUST STR0KE HIS PANTS RIGHT THERE.|`|V2IJHt94aa	Put your hands down  his back pockets.  Squeeze.  whisper things in his ear, what you Whisper isn't half as important as your hot  breath in his ear.|`|vOd72W8yaa	Just do it, but do it in a way that it's only know between the two of you.  Any type of sexual touch on a guy is welcome, but to keep yourself from being embarassed, make sure that he doesn't make a loud noise when you do it.  You'd be suprised to find out how far you can go before he stops you.|`|bG8mEUHhaa	it works best when yall r sitting down near each other, jus play around on top of his pelvis bone it work on alot of guys. if yall r walking, play with his sweet spots,it get guys arousedn he wouldnt be walking around wit a *****. if u want to get him real hard then jus pin him up on a wall n start making out wit him n play with his ****. dats being spontaneous n it should work.   :P
EQ4q0Lf5aa	he is a friend so dont be mad at him, just tell him how you feel  and make him feel like he is making  a mistake by not wanting to go out with you|`|gAflmxDRaa	yea, sometimes we guys are wishy-washy that way. but sometimes we actually do mean that we're srry. wat u should do is to ask him that he is truly srry, if he says yes, warn him that if he does something similar next time he wont b forgiven. (do the warning in a somewat nice, polite, kind, yet threatening way)|`|KQpDsKh7aa	nope|`|UY89MaBSaa	well if he is trying 2 MAKE u forgive him then screw him its ur choice if u forgive him or not so if he wants u 2 forgive him and hes tryin 2 make u forgive him then he still wants 2 b friends but the question is do U want 2 forgive him? if u dont wanna forgive then dont i agree that was really harsh 4 him 2 do that 2 u but the choice is urs hunni
FHrrKxO5aa	A woman is supposed to be everything for their husband. She should always make you feel wanted. If she is not feeling good, PMS or what not she should tell baby i don't feel well. If she does that then you know something is wrong. Now about seeking it elsewhere the majority of the time when a man cheats its because he's woman is not doing what they are supposed too. And yes it is wrong to seek any kind of affection rather sexual or emotional from another woman. You need to talk to her and let her know how you are feeling. Then give her a little time to try and change because people don't change over night. If she still isn't giving you the attention or rather importance that you need then its free game cause you warned her.|`|mgwiuZT0aa	You knew what you were dealing with before you married her. If she was like this when you dated her then you would be wrong to seek attention else where. Now if she wasn't and she changed then that is a different story.    I have a feeling you married her like this. Most men marry simple women and then get upset when they don't change. What do you expect? If you wanted a woman that wore heels, communicated and gave attention then you should have married me..lol.. You should have married a woman like that.|`|N8yQwq9Haa	Everyone should feel wanted in any relationship.  As for seeking it elsewhere how would the arms of another woman make you feel any better, its the arms of your wife you need.|`|0OT4i7Dsaa	yes its wrong talk to her first! its known if you dont give your amn what he needs he going to be looking elsewhere for it ! But because you are smarter then that and you Love your wife talk to her and tell her how you are feeling..God Luck !|`|fMDS4vTGaa	Its not anyone's responsibility to fill every weakness, failing and personality gap that another person has.  When someone is overly needy in a relationship, its not the other persons role to be the font of never-ending unconditional love.  That's asking too much of any human.    By the same token, this needy person has no business rationalizing that because he feels like a loser, its all his main partner's fault and therefore, its all her/his fault that he has to go scoping around town looking for someone to make him feel like a big man again.    That's being a selfish jerk and breaking the marriage vows, disrespecting the trust your spouse has in you and even putting her at risk for any diseases you may bring home from the other side.    I hate needy men, they bore me to tears. I'd kick them out before they had a chance to think about ways to rationalize looking for something with someone else.|`|10d29030429ea7a1527ba8f23128d41eaa	seeking someone else is not the answer. Working it out with your wife is the best thing you can ever do. going somewhere else will just lead you to the same problems your having now. its best to just work it out with the one you married . remember for better or worse you get the good along with the bad baggage. its up to you to deal with it.|`|078b47a6e483ce98bd9b5824d2c3cac8aa	it is very important tor your husband feel wanted ...in all aspects. you  shouldn't seek it elsewhere. you should talk to your wife and if that doesn't work seek outside help to solve the issue like counseling. Going outside the marriage for any intimate reasons is wrong.|`|TXY6EAYqaa	It is very important to let the man in your life know he is wanted.  Speak to your spouse and try and work something out. Maybe your not showing her enough affection.|`|447b3c2cce6bc6d60c0a2667a9e8a9a9aa	Oh snaps. Were avatar twins|`|GWRP3vLQaa	You sound like you are looking for permission to cheat on your wife, and I can't give it to you. All spouses feel taken for granted and unappreciated at times, but cheating isn't an honorable solution.     What does it take for you to feel wanted? What are you doing to make your wife feel wanted or to help her want you more?    Man up and talk with your wife and try to make things better with her. Forget about cheating. That is a low-life way to deal with your problem.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	I'm a guy.  and drugs make me feel happy but it's wrong to use drugs.     Cheating is bad too.|`|rDmMk9Soaa	What a stupid question! Of course, I want my man to feel wanted. You need to tell her how you feel.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I think that every human wants to feel wanted.  I think the real issue is what makes a person feel wanted.  And I think the key to knowing that about a person is finding out their "love language."  My boyfriend is teaching me this concept.  :)    Of course it's wrong to seek it elsewhere.  If men have one commonality (in my opinion), it is that they don't speak of their feelings enough.  If a man is not feeling wanted, he needs to tell his wife.  He should suggest counseling.  How cool would that be ladies?    Edit (for your added details):  Oh, this is different.  I had this occur in my marriage, where I was getting attention outside and none at home.  It stinks, because when you try to tell the person, they automatically start acting like you're trying to look elsewhere or cheat.  Try something different than talking.  Instead, buy her a sexy dress and some heels and take her out to dinner and dancing.  Make HER feel sexy and she might make you feel wanted.  Just a thought.|`|INkafu0uaa	yes i let my husband feel wanted because if you don't some one else will so he my fine as man and he knows!|`|AA11785285	You came up with this brilliant question, how?|`|81wvN8Rraa	Of course it's important for the husband to feel wanted. It is never right to seek attention else where. If the husband is not getting what he needs he should talk to his wife about it.|`|4Z1yW8dBaa	Of course a guy wants to feel wanted.  What kind of question is that?  And if he can't get appreciation or love at home, believe me, he'll get it somewhere else.  You obviously don't realize how EASY we are.  Get a copy of "The Proper Care and feeding of Husbands" and read it twice.  Be his girlfriend and he will never ever have to go outside the marriage to go looking for something he should be getting at home..physically, emotionally, whatever.|`|7VxNpWepaa	If you are feeling unwanted by your wife, then you should talk to her about how you feel. communication is the key to a relationship.  I don't think you should seek what your looking for somewhere else.  Just talk to your wife and spice things up!  Good luck|`|nsGBwXCTaa	Yes . She should always wont to be with you .I am married I am 27 I have been with my husband for almost 6years. Yes We have words past between us but I think that all people have that . If she is not going to stand beside you then you do not need her you and her are soppost to meet 1/2way 50 50 and that is just the way it should be good luck|`|ivsYJPx3aa	This is of very importance my DEAR!|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Absolutely its important for BOTH partners to feel wanted.  Its not ok to seek satisfaction elsewhere.. how would that possibly help the marriage?  Talk to each other, express your needs and wants, work it out.
AA11785285	Oh, yes.   and live is lovely.    And it got that way because of my mom's four rules on how to have a great life.    Read my avatar.  If I died tomorrow, I have lived 6 wonderful lives.....    1.  The most important decision you will ever make is who you marry.  Choose with your head as well as your heart.  2.  Have no children until your bond is strong, and have no more than you yourself can support.  You may just have to  3.  At any and all costs finish your education to qualify for those high paying jobs.  It is likely that you will work sometime during your marriage, probably for decades. Get paid for it. And remember, your kids and your education are forever. Husbands, lovers and promises are not!!  4.  Have a stash of cash no one knows about even if you are sure you will never need it.  You absolutely will, and the more the better.    With these, I avoided all the pitfalls, had no kids I couldn't support, have a great education, and got to retire, at 48.... do that with 7 kids, a hs diploma, and dating jerks.|`|INkafu0uaa	in marriage yes it took 7 yrs but now its clear !|`|ucIy9I0daa	No way. Seem to be backin up. 2nd marriage a disaster.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Only in my marriage. School and work are really crazy right now.|`|Hd7tFHN7aa	yes, i married a women that I have know for years, and learning together now is more fun then being by my self and doing the same thing.    She is asking a question and I know what she is asking before she gets it out.  she does the same thing when i ask a question.  You become in tune with each other.|`|fMDS4vTGaa	If I ever got to that place, I'd figure I'd either gotten extremely stupid (which in such case I'd lack any ability for introspection anyway) or that I'd lost my mind.    Either way I don't think anyone but fools and idiots reach that point.
GpitqYxcaa	Don't change, a punk guy is still a guy, we love girls that can dance... (just saying). I don't know what your personality is like, so I'm going on that lol. He will either like you or not, so just go with it and in time you will know which one it is.|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	well opposites can attract so just be your self|`|bG8mEUHhaa	ask him........... just ask him............ its dat simple|`|7mrtqwJwaa	be yourself, don't change for a boy.|`|5R3oVfisaa	sk8r boi. he was a boy she was a girl can I make it anymore obvious? he was a punk she did ballet, what more can I say? He wanted her, but she'd never tell that secretly she wanted him as well, but all of her friends stuck up their nose, they had a porblem with his baggy clothes. he was a sk8r boi she said see you later boi he wasn't good enough for her she had a pretty face and her head was up in space she needed to come back down to earth. etc, etc.   I know people will say this , but just be yourself, if you take too much time trying to be someone else, he won't like you, he'll like who you pretend to be. haha. so anywayz I'd say go for it, if he likes you, he'll like you whether your a dancer or a punk or something. whatever is meant to happen will happen and nothing will stand against you guys. so peace. love. happiness. hope i helped |`|aYcobrliaa	What do you mean you should do? Just be yourself, don't try to change yourself and become the type of girls he likes. He might actually like the type of girls like you.   Good luck :)|`|HhKisHTiaa	Don't change anything about yourself. If he doesn't like you for who you are then it isn't worth it. However, that doesn't mean you don't have to make an effort, treat him as you would treat any other guy you liked. Ignore the stereotypes.|`|uIbWOUSyaa	umm well lots of my friends r punks and some r boys sometimes they like preps but thts not offenten lol well i guess.... just a girl tht they can actually have a convo wit i guess just start talking to the dude.|`|tCt5P15waa	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhmm  ask him out & do sumthin tht he would probly like doin..  MUSIC would b good & try not listen to anythin to screamo cuz it might just freak him out but unless hes a hard core rockr & he likes kind of stuff thn go for it
5j9bRHs9aa	I honestly think 5th graders shouldn't be worried about dating. Nothing ever happens to elementary school "crushes". (I know i've been there) If he likes you that's great. you have all high school to worry about boys sweetie(: Just  have fun with friends! You'll remember those memories forever.(:|`|RWldtEkwaa	WOW, chill out just because he didn't hit you or whatever doesn't mean anything. but then again maybe he does like you? why don't you try to ask him!|`|NVx3iRZJaa	Probably not. Sorry. Don't get too excited...I'm in 9th grade, ( 14 ) and they're hard enough to understand NOW, so don't get too into guys until like...7th or 8th grade.     Dude you're only like...10 years old. So you have plenty of time to worry about stuff like that.     Generally speaking though, just because he didn't tag you doesn't really count as flirting... =\  If you like him though, tell him or something.  Good luck!|`|sYxtPBziaa	Omg do you think he has a phd in physics or mechanical engineering? woah duuuude.... Focus on school.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	I doubt it, sorry.|`|XzLUA7ataa	He's dating?  You are in the fifth grade.  I've got a fifth grade boy at home and he likes girls, but he isn't dating.  He might walk a girl home from school or ride his bike past her house hoping to talk with her.  Yes, he probably does like you and he will probably like many girls for the next several years.  You should like many of your classmates, too.|`|lQjWLffmaa	oh gosh girl calm down you are only in 5th grade|`|LO3Ra7Ogaa	daang girl calm down.  ask him.  if your just fifth graders its not gonna do you any harm.    fifth grade you dont find your true love or anyone close so you might as well just wait.|`|TWm5Smlaaa	it doesn't sound like it.|`|6kuJgjEhaa	Probably not.|`|6HgiNCmqaa	if he liked you he would have pegged u|`|XgfC0F5haa	um thats like seriously nothing      im in 8th grade and i have wayyy much more drama going on having to do with that crap      stop overreacting      he probably doesnt like you. talk to him, get to know him more|`|cOkUsbleaa	is there need for all the question marks? omg calm down he maybe likes u!|`|yZzYcxQyaa	ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....no|`|fGSI183haa	im sorry, no he doesnt. dont think about guys until high school. ur way to young.|`|gQ7HsE0daa	He might like you.  Don't jump to conclusions, just wait and see if he spends more and more time around you...then he might like you.  If you like him  spend a little more time around him.  Just not too much because that would be weird....hope this helps!|`|twSD9zHzaa	nope!|`|7MSEfa7Oaa	no no no  your way to young to even date  don't worry|`|EfhXEAbHaa	I think 5th grade is young for dating i am in 8th grade and im not ready for the drama that comes with dating. if u like him then ask him if he likes u. u have nothing to lose
dNTAPAIAaa	if he is already lying about how far you've gone with him, i would just forget him. thats a bad sign.|`|UjG8FqLUaa	WELL BEF0RE HE T0LD ALL HIS BUDDIES HE SCREWED Y0U ALREADY; HE SEEMED LIKE HE WAS INTERESTED IN Y0U BUT HE`S JUST BEING A DICK. I W0ULD AV0ID HIM BECAUSE THAT`S S0 IMMATURE AND DISRESPECTFUL F0R HIM T0 LIE LIKE THAT.|`|3wWGjj4naa	im assuming your a beautfiul girl and this guys seems like a dick... honeslty i think he might have another girl or several girls... how old r yall ?  anyways... if he is telling his buddies he slept with u hes just trying ot look like a stud in front of his friends... and thts disresepecting you and you shoudl call him out on it...tell him u dont appreciate him saying u slept with him when u didnt and tht he needs to cut it out... seriously your better then that dont put up with a sleez like tht|`|AA11376151	he might be using you   and seriously why would you mess w/ a guy who lied about your intamicy level w/ him|`|CcfMfP8zaa	ok well he does like u because why would he say that he slept with u (even though its not true)  or hes trying to get in ur pants and ull kno that if he starts actin like a jerk or eager.  watever u do dont do anything u dont want to do
pRF5LLloaa	That's really stupid.  you BOTH must be very young.    YOU need to know that you DON:T write your "friends" into stories without their permission.  Even adults don't do that!  At least, not adults that don't want to get sued and taken to court and possibly put in jail.  When you write things about another person, it is called "LIBEL", and in the adult world it is a crime. [When you SAY things about another person, it is called "SLANDER", and that to is a crime.]    You need to pick some better friends.  This guy is just plain too immature to mess with -- he's still a little boy, runs crying to Mama whenever he thinks he's hurt.    YOU need to be sensitive to that, and simply avoid doing things to hurt him -- because he will try to hurt YOU back.    Have you ever heard someone say "Names have been changed to protect the innocent"?  This is why.      A good author always uses MADE UP characters, so that he or she doesn't get into trouble.  If you want to be a writer, you need to do the same thing.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	If the fact that your friend told on you gets to you than you should rethink your friendship with him.  But do not pretend that want happened did not happen.  If you tell him something else you can believe that he will tell again.  Do you want to have to go through that again about every little thing that you say around him.  If not just end the friendship.|`|AA10162464	Well seems that your friend is a little childish.You shouldn't pretend that nothing happened..forget about being friends with him.|`|dI4aYEyOaa	whats the big deal about him being in your story. it is just a story right. did you say any thing bad.  i wouldn't worry about it .
70MRFokCaa	NO LIES  your hot but at the same time   decent|`|4fikqmnUaa	this photo is black and white, edited and at an angle so we can't see you properly. how can we possibly tell?|`|1t7Gu2swaa	wow you're really pretty!  +your smile is amazing (:|`|pmvMA19Faa	You are beautiful...

y1hi2zr0aa	you really need to talk things out with him. sometimes you just feel guilty when you want to dump them. if you been together for a really long time breaking up is gonna feel weird to you so you just can't seem to let them go. you should talk it out with him and see if things are gonna work out or not but if it doesnt you should waste your time with someone you dont want to be with anymore|`|jSH47SN7aa	if you have known him that long then you are going to feel guilty and its better to let him go then to hold him until you have built up enough to let him go by time he might have grown attached to you more then you want him to then its really going to be hard  or tell him you need a break and get back to him when you figured it out hopefully its not to long|`|2FHTVEyraa	ok ok it took me awhile to understand    just chill what ur trying to say is sometimes u want a boyfriend and sometimes u don't right (i hope i am right lol) just hang out with other guys for idk a week but without ur boyfriend around. then u think about it. is ur boyfriend really worth a relationship or just as friends? (the hanging out with other guys helps you understand what is going on. is ur boyfriend good enough for u? are there better guys out there for u? i don't know ur taste in guys but is ur boyfriend the one?) i have heard that if u question about dumping a guy, the relationship wont work for you. (im guessing that he doesn't know ANYTHING about u dumping him) so just think about what i said (sorry if its kinda hard to understand but) and do whats right for you! HOPE THIS HELPS!!!|`|9EgXeA2waa	give him your clamidea and dump him|`|el8yX5q3aa	You are afraid of change...that is normal.  Change means just that...everything is going to be different and you are afraid of that.  Right now what you know is comfortable...like an old shoe.  But it  doesn't mean it is good for you.    There is an old saying....I think by Roosevelt....There is nothing to fear but fear itself.    Once you know you have the confidence to face the world alone..you will be able to do anything.|`|PCBQbQmraa	I think you like the fact that you have a boyfriend. Some people are just like that they need a man in there life 24/7, and you don't want to loose that no matter who its with.|`|FDEuHT7jaa	Say that again.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	Maybe you are so attached to him and are scared of being alone? I know one thing for sure- If you are already concidering dumping him, something is not right in the relationship. Sit down, argue both cases in your mind- + and - about this relationship and then follow your heart.|`|w29tsXLUaa	Well what I would do is suggest a short break from each other and then go out and meet other boys. You will find out then how much you do or do not want him.    I think you are afraid of hurting his feelings and worried in case you do not meet someone else. But you will.|`|tCOrcOK0aa	just dump him|`|NGwxbzEWaa	if you feel like this you obviously don't care enough about this person to fully know that you're gonna be with them forever. Don't just "try things out", because if you guys don't click at first, then you probably won't stay together for long. Stop wasting your time, dump him, do it nicely, and move on to bigger and better things where youre confident in the relationship|`|UnWOkO6paa	I HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT THIS STUFF LOL!|`|IBEl08szaa	you've grown attached to him that's why you can't dump him adn you should talk to him about this not saying that you might dump him but that your relationship is bad.|`|ByxEE8eeaa	You don't have to take action right away. You can continue thinking and take the time you need. If you like, you could talk to him about it. Don't tell him you want to dump him, but tell him you're confused about the relationship. Maybe you can agree to just go with it and see where things go. Are you happy when you're with him?|`|2gh84Ec6aa	i JUST got out of this same relationship.  it's really hard, you just gotta tell him flat out.  no hints.. no nothing.  just tell him you're better off as friends.  it sucks.. my ex is STILL trying to talk to me and it's hard to ignore him but thats the only way.  good luck.|`|YyUCDprVaa	you don't want to hurt him but yet you don't really like him anymore... hmmm. I personaly think u should dump him, because not only is it bad for u to be forced to stay with him, it also is mean to him to let him think that u still like him after u don't anymore. If i were him i would want you to tell me the truth because i wouldn't want u to lie about liking me. That's worse than just saying u don't like him.|`|sSueqf2xaa	Sometimes people feel that they either;  a) Don't want to hurt the persons feelings... or  b) Aren't ready to accept changes and become single again  It could be either one of these but you need to respond to your feelings and sort something out. Your boyfriend needs to know, and you both deserve to be happy. Good luck.    ? Kimmiii|`|23fftRSsaa	help me
dGL5xCrqaa	The actions are so much more important than the words.  Like people say, "Show me, don't tell me." People could easily lie with words, but it's hard to always fake your actions like that.  He's a sweet guy, he doesn't necessarily need to spell it out for you that he likes you!!  You're lucky, be grateful you found a sweetie pie.|`|wpqJr2FMaa	He's just bad telling in addition to showing.  Next time you two go out, say, "I really like you, _____"  Or something along the lines of that.  He may be looking for the opportunity to tell you how he truly feels about you, and he just can't find it, so this will give him the opportunity to.  If he's as sensitive and as sweet as you say, he should be able to tell you back.|`|5R3oVfisaa	well most girls have the opposite problem. if they just say they love you, he might just want to tag you along and keep you being there. but if he shows it he really does care, and you should be grateful for that  but... if you want him to say some more stuff just start saying I think you're hot, or stuff like you mentioned (i like you) and he should recipricate unless he's a total idiot and like tucks your hair behind your ear, or something. maybe tho he;d kiss you and that wouldn't be bad, but keep trying to talk to him and he should recipricate so idk. peace.love.happiness. hope i helped  |`|5YEKmHqyaa	He definately likes you I wouldn't worry about that.  As far as the not telling you he likes you part, that is no big deal.  At least he is showing you.  Some girls don't have the satisfaction of either.  Plus he is only 15 and he might be shy about verbally expressing his emotions so its probably just easier to show you with his actions.|`|CJIZpXp8aa	Consider yourself lucky.|`|u5Ioj6aaaa	OMG your my twin! I have the sweetest BF ever and he does nice things like attending church with me and staring at me constantly but he never gives me compliments or anything. im guessing that they are kind of shy. I think it helps if I open up to him first. If i text him and say he looked great today, I think he is more comfortable and isn't as afraid to express himself. hope this helped|`|de75c6103d62d8807f85d1c1ab0c7cf6aa	don't worry! you know as they say...ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS =) its really cute and genuine that he shows he cares about you by his actions. the reason why he probably doesn't tell you is because he is shy about expressing his emotions. most guys are like that..they don't know how to talk about their feelings so they show it instead.|`|AA10789032	some guys just arent verbal especially at 15.  give it some time. He will open up and communicate more with you Im sure!
2Ub98Bnfaa	try to think about all of the good qualities you have and remember that the people who judge you have no lives and they need to take a good look at themselves before judging others|`|pRF5LLloaa	Understand that YOU are the sensitive one.  HER  attitude is ignorant and selfish. Her attitude is not something that you REALLY want.    SHE needs to become more like you.|`|dKxrbUQZaa	You've got to do what you want anyway. You've got to be strong, and not be afraid of critism. Some of the things you're probably scared to do, if someone else did you'd think it was normal. Think of it that way. Trust me, it'll make your life a whole lot better if you just completely rearrange the way you look at things so that you're not afraid to be yourself. Don't let other's words make you think that your not normal or something. If you are different than others it doesn't make you weird, it makes you cool. If someone criticizes you, turn it back around on them for example if they question your clothing act like you have no idea what they are talking about cause this is totally normal, and that YOU like it, so YOU wore it.|`|JwjFV5Uhaa	don't care just think there jelious and thats there opinion someone might like that about u
wNKleK4Uaa	He's depressed and angry? Sounds like he won't take ownership for his own failures and shortcomings, and finds it easier to blame those around him. Your parents need to put their foot down and tell him to sort himself out, because he's making life hard for the rest of you. He needs to get a job and become more financially independent. You and your family don't have to cut him off completely, but throwing him in the deep end and forcing him to take control of his own life will teach him a lot and make your lives so much easier.|`|7dVtO1gtaa	because your bother is afraid of who he is, he doesn't want to become a man he wants to stay a boy.|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	He's a momma's boy! Your mother created a monster by catering to his every need.|`|AA11464864	MAYB HE COMPARES HIMSELF TO U GUYS AND WHEN HE REALIZES ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS U HAV IT MAKES HIM FEEL AS IF HE'S BEING RUSHED TO DO THE SAME AND BY HIM LACKING SOME OF THE SKILLS U AND YOUR OTHER SIBLINGS HAV HE HAS TO BE DEFENSIVE AND HAV AN EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING EVEN WHEN HE'S WRONG HE FEELS AS THOUGH HE'S RIGHT|`|aKvxy3xBaa	There's always some one in the family with a different personality and it doesn't mean its wrong. He may just take longer to mature.|`|ErtxmW4Xaa	maybe hes just scared to open up and show his feelings,  he might be scared of trying new things, so he doesnt want to work,  i know mothers are supposed to support their children but maybe she should say no to giving him money all the time and he will go look for a job :) hope i helped :D|`|Hizsm6m4aa	We all have a black sheep in the family and it seems like your mom is enabling him. He may not be ready to be independent either. There's nothing that can be done for a person like that cause he seems to possibly have issues coping with everyday life issues. As long as your mom is fine with it, you'll have to deal with it too.|`|soyYjOPbaa	hes wierd, no offense to ur feelings.|`|Ai8H5N8paa	i think hes just afraid or looking for excuses cuz he doiesnt want to move on|`|fen79tTnaa	Sounds like a mommy's boy. He won't be a different person unless he wants too. Or unless your mom kicks him out. Sorry, some people are just overly dependent|`|448a85191a54cc7c72fb3006ad32edebaa	hes got paranoia|`|xxEl0aaXaa	hes kinda acting spoiled  try doing what they did in "step brothers" and get him a job :P something to ocupy him so he can learn to be responsible|`|AA11636728	this one is kinda hard to answer because we dont know his storey or how he was raised  but there is some thing  for sure wrong with the pic  he seems very insucure  its one or the other  if he had the same up bringing  and if it was good  hes  spoiled if he s had a hard life  or some thing went wrong with him and he just couldnt tell any one    he acting out and hes very scared  or may be hes just had every thing handed to him on a silver platter  and exspects every one to take care of him  sounds to me realy not realy knowing the situtaion   and just baseing on what you say about him   ,,, the being demanding and never had a job he playing your parents  and everyone around him  he acts as if hes running the show  he acts like every one owes him something sounds to me  your parents need to put him out in the wrold to fend for him self  seems he doesnt charish  your famliy at all he needs to be forsed  to be out on his own  may be then hil get a job  and may be hel  finaly see  what a nice famliy hes had  and may be hel gain some self respect all say prayers for your famliy|`|aEmmwWvoaa	i get the feeling that you know your brother better than i do, i dont know whats making me think that, but so yeh if you, his sister doesnt know why hes behaving like this then im hardly going to have a clue. sorry. :)|`|Sbmte7psaa	Okay, here's what I think.... You say he's 21, never had a job, is still a student and lives at home, he has sibs (younger and older).... He has middle child syndrome..... Here is something for you to think about..... are you younger or older..... if older try having a heart to heart with him, he prob looks up to you..... however if you are younger he is more than likely jealous of you.... so try talking with him just letting him do most of the talking......|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	He's a selfish pillock that thinks the world owes him a living, this is a sign of poor up bringing, was he the favourite and been spoilt or is he suffering from low self esteem, signs of this are laziness, not willing to clean up, no personal pride, basically a looser.|`|DrFrkM63aa	idkkk|`|nZpSM7ngaa	i would like to hear his side of this story.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	lolz he loves how much hes being spoiled im like that with my parents =]|`|xyrSl2nSaa	Everyone is different. Maybe he has inner issues that he doesn't tell anyone. Maybe you could try to talk to him about it as a friend|`|wIoG2KV2aa	I am not sure what 'Uni accommodation' is, but it sounds like he is rebelling, has some unresolved self esteem issues, or has some other 'secret' that he has not divulged or faced. Speaking with a counselor would be VERY MUCH to his benefit.|`|D3agflP1aa	try talking to him and be serious dont be joking around or anything
Zg8aORFYaa	Yes, but my ex-husband also ALLOWED her into his life and then felt he was "in love" again and had an affair, then proceeded to cheat on her and a string of other women.  A man or woman who loves you won't allow another person to come between you...in my opinion.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Nope|`|k8socvTVaa	i have never had that problem...because i will never allow another women come between me and my boyfriend there will be serious problems...u need to stand up for ur self and tell the b****....exactly where she could go.|`|Wi9nmYIEaa	yes....a woman tried...but then failed when I confronted her about it....I was quite confronting, to the point and brutal with what I thought of her.....because she had no right to be there in the first place. I was quite prepared to accept the consequences for my own actions....ie that if I confronte her it could spell the end of my relationship...and I felt that if I didnt do it ....it would have had the same outcome....but it turned out in my favour.    :  )|`|81wvN8Rraa	My ex boyfriends sister attempted to ruin our relationship by telling lies. I just told him he could believe her and leave me or he could shut up and be with me. We were together awhile after that but later broke up b/c he was still listening to her.|`|5jMNBO2naa	why put up with it    when you meet someone  one of the first thing you do is to clear a ny past baggage and drama  if not you simply do not go forward  no body is worth it  part of the problem is your BF is an enabler  as he allows her to run interference|`|wnb0EgaHaa	No.  My personal feelings on this are along the lines of this...    A man (or woman, as the case may be) is responsible for setting his personal boundaries, both with his partner and with others in his life.    For that reason, if there is someone in his life who is interfering with our relationship, my expectation would be that he will resolve it. Period.    I am secure, reasonable, and logical, and jealousy or possessiveness is not an issue for me.  In light of that, I would assume that if I am uncomfortable about any relationship that he has with another woman, he would consider my feelings and address the situation, whatever it might be.    That is my expectation because my belief is that it is a matter of mutual respect.  I would not expect him to have to intervene in any relationship that I might have for the same reasons.  Both of us are accountable for our own actions and choices.    Everyone has priorities in life, and when it comes to a serious relationship,  any friend who is incapable of recognizing and respecting them needs to be put in check.      All of this is, of course, based on the assumption that both parties are mature and capable of open and honest communication and have the ability to build and establish trust.      I feel like any adult is going to do what he or she wants to do, and be where he or she wants to be.  Trying to play "enforcer" is a no win situation, and if that seems necessary, the only thing that makes sense is to accept it, or walk away.|`|lvelp0CGaa	I have been married and divorce twice and through both marriages I had more then 1 woman interferring not because they wanted my husband physically but financially .    1st husband : I had his high school g/f hanging off us like a bad smell when ever she felt I had finally pushed her out she found a new way back in either through smashing her car so he could fix it / mechanical problems with it for him to fix then because she was a manager at mcdonalds she used the junk food because he loved junk food , then my brother's wives got in on the act and a fiance to my 2nd eldest brother it was never ending . His 5 affairs during the 12 years didnt help either.    2nd husband : His high school sweetheart , the mother to his daughter , his mother then 2 of my friends .    Both marriages ended in divorce you work out the consequence from me telling them all to f*^k off .
6JEhoZ08aa	Im a virgin, my fiance' is not. It makes me feel a little weird, but I know it will be ok. It just makes me worry that I will be compared to past women.|`|2dfc54c0eb87bcd7851f591498f1e09eaa	was not a virgin when I married we had sex before the wedding and it didnt change anything my thought is when you buy a new car you test drive it, why would you marry someone without a test drive what if after you married it wasn't what you expected or wanted. People can say sex doesn't matter but come on sex is a major part of a marriage and a couple's life if the sex ain't good then your relationship ain't good. GOOD LUCK|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	My husband and I did not have sex prior to marriage.  He was a virgin and I was not a virgin.  Since my husband and I have a very open dialogue about every topic it has helped our marriage a great deal.  The knowledge I gained from prior experiences have be invaluable to us.|`|p9QglBpyaa	My husband & I waited until we got married to have sex. I was a virgin, but he wasn't. For the most part, we've worked through it as best we can so it doesn't negatively affect our marriage, but there are times when it can be an issue. The main thing is the fear of comparison. It can be hard, but I try not to let it affect me. Communication is very important, but there is fine line between being open and honest on the issue and learning too much about your spouse's past.|`|CaPZrWVWaa	I've never had sex not using a condom.     I know it sounds silly, but I still feel as I am saving something for marriage.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	Yes, it does affect your marriage.|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Not in the least! No fumbling, no awkwardness just a great night>and 43years afterward|`|H1UzYl8haa	didnt wait  dosnt affect it, your just more comfortable with eachother that way|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	I don't think it matters, I think what matters more is living with the person first, but if your strict Christian than I guess that won't fly either. The sex is going to be great in the beginning with that person then it usually dissolves. So no matter what everyone loses!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Neither myself or my boyfriend are virgins and when we get married I can't see it making a difference. It just means we had a head start in intimacies and communication of what we like sexually.
by7H31Djaa	It happened to me and my husband and it hasn't affected our marriage. It's actually something i think about alot but since i see that it doesn't matter to him, our past, i never mention it. Even though i still think about it alot it hasn't affected our marriage.|`|VygBNA0Waa	i think sex is a big part of your life and not having sex before marriage is weird it the biggest way of get close to someone else you give your whole self to that person to me that's real love and not doing that i find that you must not love that person that much   what happens if you get married and you don't have sex with them then you might not like sex with them and might not be sexual compatible and then your left with a broken marriage and that's worse then having sex before marriage|`|T1P6Imixaa	Well I have been married for 21 years now and I was a virgin and he was not ...I got married when I as 16 and now I am 37 and I do wonder sometimes what it would have been like if I had been with someone  else ..An yes sometimes I do think it has affected the way I think and what I want now .|`|zDmGngXVaa	My husband and I didn't wait! Having a sex life in a relationship matters a lot. A few of my friends and including his waited till marriage to have sex and most of them say they wish they had sex before marriage because now they are stuck with their partner who sucks in bed! The saying is "Test drive the car before you buy it!" It sucks! My husband told me that he would wait for me for when I was ready because I've had bad relationships but he wouldn't marry me because he didn't want to take chances of our sex life being a failure. Our sex life is GREAT! I am glad we did decided to have sex before we got married! I'm not telling you to have sex and I am not telling you to wait! It's all up to you, this is a choice you are needing to make on your own! You are the only one who knows what best for yourself!|`|EENUWAP7aa	What's the difference...it's all about sex either way you go at it.|`|g0q6ny9qaa	well considering I have never been married and have already had sex I would not know but I would guess that it would depend on you guys and it really doesn't affect the marriage in my opinion I am just guessing but that is common sense, hope this helped.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Didn't happen to me but it did happen to my cousin. They seem to be happily married anyway.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	I have a good friend that waited until she was 32 & married. She was raised by nuns in Mexico. She & her husband have issues now.

SsGLm3Xvaa	Make him a mixed CD or something :)  like of songs that you think he might like, or songs that remind you of the two of you together, or like a mix of songs he loves and songs you love.  you could also write him a letter about why he makes you happy :)    or, you could get him an xbox game you know he doesn't have, or better yet, a bmx xbox game you know he doesn't have :)    or, does he like those bmx magazines?  get him a small stack of those.
6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	If you do end up marrying him do not expect things to get any better than what they are.  Because they will not.  If he is being mean and rude to you why would you want to get married to him.  I understand that the two of you have kids together but it takes more than that for you to marry someone.  You need to get out of this situation now.  He is not helping you with the kids so it is like you are a single parent any way.  2 years to be engaged without an official date is too long.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	your      not really playing with a full deck are you?|`|ivsYJPx3aa	rude ....get a cab  fatsy Patsy!|`|81wvN8Rraa	leave as long as you stay he will never marry you.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Go 2 Singles & Dating.|`|e149d8651ec2a8062fd5aee0bdd23a16aa	"Constantly mean and rude" is enough for me to say goodbye.

At one point they could have been true, but now he might feel overwhelmed or pressured. Talk to him, ask him what is bothering him lately and why does he have such attitude towards you.

cS3nv2V0aa	The only problem I see with it is that the man might be caught off-guard, usually they aren't expecting to be proposed to.  If the couple communicates a lot and are on the same page, it shouldn't be a problem.  :-)|`|dSMb8JDvaa	okay...good man quite hard to find now so if you got one GO FOR IT.|`|CBdKPtUYaa	I think it shouldn't. I mean, if you want to do it then go ahead. I would like a guy to do it to me but this is the 21 first century. Women are more ready to have a comment so the chances of getting a yes is if a guy does it I think but if a girl wants to propose then I think it's fine.|`|7gMJfi7saa	no it shouldnt..... but guys seem to be less ready to commit so when they propose it seems more serious to me. of course i also think its romantic for a guy to propose
czB9nABWaa	no, its not weird. don't get a baby until your 18 at least. but, you could baby-sit a lot of people's kids and hang with them.    lol, or you could ask your parents for a younger brother or sister and watch them a lot.     haha! that'll be hillarous to see their expressions, even if they do want another kid|`|3jWaexYOaa	i don't realli think you want want a baby i think u just i think you just like to dream bout how cute and wonderful it wouldd and how great itt would be to have life in you arms ... don't worrry im 14 too nd i think about that stuff alot to...but i don't think it wired i think that curiosity just takes our mind away|`|avpv7u8saa	No but don't act on it|`|ENlBD17Gaa	NOT AT ALL.  It's evolutionarily normal.  Plus, babies are cute.

Just make sure you wait till you're old enough and in a stable relationship with someone.|`|0894be71d36fb087dd4d64f6446344d8aa	yeah ur not financially ready + think about the future|`|VVcfs0IXaa	yes ur only 14. trust me 14 is way to young to be wanting a baby. most girls do have baby's around your age but you have brains aat least think ur only 14 and are to young to have a baby. at least wait until ur 20.|`|xkZbjKNdaa	no not at all  at this age most kids think of stuff like that   its not unusual  but remember kids are getting prego in the ages of 14-18  i would highly recommend no sex   please wait until you are ready|`|7tjM2socaa	grow up a little bit before having kids being 14 and pregnant is not a good idea. you will never have time for yourself and you will no longer be a kid, you'll be a kid who has to pretend to be an adult, and won't be able to go to college and possibly not finish high school which could give you a bad future. And the father could possibly not want to have anything to do with you and your child. But the bottom line, don't have kids until your married.|`|4wTbdsJgaa	It is somewhat normal to be wanting to have those maternal feelings where you take care of something that is all yours.  But seriously, are you really thinking of having a kid at 14.  You will ruin your life, and be working at a hotel.  If you have a kid now, that kid's life will be screwed up, just because you were selfish, and wanted to have a kid.  I know I sound kind of harsh, but teens really need to wake up, and think more long term than 5 minutes.|`|AA10789032	No its not weird. Your teen hormones are probably to blame.  Just dont act on it! you are way too young!|`|a9bfb7859e7ead6aed17febc4c739cc6aa	the feeling of wanting a baby is normal. It is normal to want to nurture something and feel needed. However, having a baby would not be the solution in your case since you are so young. Woman just have a special part of the brain that works subconsciously towards mothering. You aren't really "WANTING" a baby. You are just wanting something to need you, and to nurture, and to love you back.|`|efdb04ba6a4a066db7fc97aeb97e9037aa	No, but I would definitely advise you to suppress it.  A baby is EXPENSIVE and TIRING, I am putting these words in CAPS because I know firsthand.  I had my first child at 27 and I had a good job and my own home, but it was a HUGE lifestyle adjustment.  Wait and enjoy your time to find yourself.  When you have a baby, you are not  1 anymore.  Focus on fun things!|`|dGL5xCrqaa	Haha, until I was 16, I wanted to have any guy impregnate me so I could have a baby to dress up. I didn't really want that to happen, but I understand the desire to have a baby to name it and be materialistic over.  I think it's a fairly common girl thing, not all.   It's weird, so I wouldn't go telling your guy friends that, but you're not alone in it.  Hope you came up with some good names. =]|`|4Vr2zecWaa	Laawl. I want a baby, and I'm only 13 xDD But it's not like I'm that naive enough to have one. For one thing, the economy's really bad D; For a second thing, It's gunna hurt. &Babies are reaallyy adorablee(= But I'm not sure i want one cuz what if my spouse leaves me or something, ill never be too sure. But it's natural to want one ^^ maybe get a doll or something, lol. besides, everyone has something "weird"(but i dont think this is weird at all) about them that makes themselves them. (;|`|32L0SKzsaa	no.. I want one too !    I'm a dude so lets get it on and make one?    :D|`|F08qx2hgaa	Look, a ton of girls feel the need for a baby. It's completely normal- your hormones are in bloom right now, leading to new maternal instincts.|`|e6eFw91Saa	not really, i mean you could just go and get a sims game, those things are good for people who want a family too young|`|LZP3WRxIaa	umm kinda lol i mean your only 14 .. dont be stupid and just think to have a kid now would be stupid your whole teen years would be gone to take care of this other kid. lol but i dont thnk its that weird when i was your age i thought of it a couple times and then i had a kid and now im very mad at myself i did.. dont do it, its reaaaally stupid wait a while its well worth it|`|3gMmYR3iaa	No, that's not weird. I'm 17 and I started thinking about my future children (names..ect,) when I was about your age. I just wouldn't suggest having one at your age. A baby is a life-long commitment and is a big responsibility. Please wait before making that decision until you are in a committed relationship with the father of the baby and are older.   That's just my opinion.|`|eY49t8Swaa	no but wait till your at least 18|`|A2u06IS1aa	maybe you just wanna have sex. Or maybe you just want your mom to have a baby. Or you just want to prove to your mom that you are responsible. I dont think its really weird. Becuz yur a teen and a lotta people try to prove themselves to their parents|`|mMKayhNGaa	your a woman ofcourse you'll want one, its normal  But Dont! for a long while|`|zKc66WSXaa	No, it's not weird at all. It means your maternal instincts are kicking in!    But you should wait until you are much older to have kids. Maybe you could take up a babysitting job, if you want to be with kids, or be a teaching assistant at a school.|`|QEPb6sjRaa	Girl you dont know what you're Practically saying !! First of all, You are just beggining to live . You shouldnt been thinking about Having a child when you're just a kid. Focus on your studies.. on getting a good job & Enjoying life the fullest. Because once you have a child, Its your job to be 24/7 taking care of it. You're not just gonna dump the child into your mom & Go party with your friends. Once you have it . Its your job to care for it. Have you ever thought about taking in your school home ec?   Its a class program that includes a "Baby think it over" project where you take a fake baby home for 5 days & take care of it. It shows you responcebility & stuff young mothers go through. Once you have a baby .. Its like you'd stopped Taking breath.    First live your life.. Go visit other countrys & When you are mature & you're ready to be a mother .. Go for it.|`|ANKJdJgxaa	Are youu willing to sacrifice school, going to the mall, buying new shoes, and dresses, hanging out with your friends, going to the movies and your willing to get a job and be solely responsible for the health and well being of a child.   Or, maybe you have it like Jamie Lynn Spears.  If you got all that, then go right ahead, but if your not willing to make any of those sacrifices than you should wait and learn about what your going to be facing. To sacrifice your own childhood to take care of a child Is a pretty heavy commitment.|`|59xQlCjGaa	No, it isn't weird. You want what you want.    But don't try to start having sex or whatever, or your mom will kill you.|`|RsnKo6Okaa	You can want a baby, just don't follow through with your want. (:|`|M1UiYHi5aa	nope when i was your age i was the same way!!!! lol but im glad i waited. you cant go to movies hardly ever you cant just get up and go. you need about 2 hours just to get your baby's stuff ready and your friends don't usually call any more. it sucks if your young but i love it|`|6LBiVn1jaa	are you kidding! im 15 and everytime i see a baby i say "OMG I WANT ONE SOOOO BAD!" :( but just remember that your to young and if you had one now it would wreck the babies life as well as your so its just best to wait :)|`|5YEKmHqyaa	It's not werid.  Every girl usually goes thru that stage where they want a baby.  But you're def too young.  You wouldn't be able to give it the life it needs.  You would literally have to give up your entire life, plus you're too young to get a job n support it.  Wait till you are older, it will happen for you one day.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Its not a weird thing but it would be THE STUPIDEST thing ever for you to actually go through with that...do you have any idea how much time a baby takes? You would have NO life of your own, your social life would also disappear. Seriously, if you actually do that, your obviously naive and have no concept of what  ''consequences'' means,
bxlF3MEiaa	YES! omg..i think im going crazy with lonliness.... sometimes i cant take it.|`|8xMlAzTJaa	i have the same exact thing going on rite now!! all my texting friends abandoned me. i go online and everyone if offline. it sucks!!!|`|x5GMWHRdaa	yes i do feel that way.... and when i get that feeling i go play with my dog out side, he is always paying attention lol|`|mbG4GbEUaa	Sometimes I feel like noone is paying attention to me too. I'm kinda like in the room and they don't see me. Not sure what it's about. If you are having trouble with your bcp, go to the Dr. immediately. You need to get it changed, it won't be any big deal. Tell him/her how you are feeling. Have you been on Facebook yet? It's fun too  Good Luck! (if you need to talk, I'm here)!
DVw7H5fIaa	There was something in the Victorian Era called Female Hysteria.    Basically, the sexually repressive nature of that Era caused all the housewives to become extremely sexually frustrated and, because they were frustrated, they became crazy.  Did you know the vibrator was invented in the Victorian Era?    So yeah, I guess years and years of repression from the church, the easiest way to control the human psyche is through sex. Tell them sex is dirty and everyone (because everyone has sex or thinks about it, it's inevitable, and a perfectly natural thing) will come to you for salvation.  Salvation from normal human desires? Evidently.    Also, being in a male-dominated society, women were made to be the ones who were supposed to be angels while the men were allowed to run around with whores all they liked. (Funny how the whores, were the more liberated ones back then)    Back to the Victorian Era, housewives and respectable women were supposed to think that sex was a dirty thing, that it was only for procreation, and that they weren't supposed to enjoy it.  I have no idea why you wouldn't want to enjoy it btw.    So... I guess, years down the road, all this history still manifests in today's liberated (from a sexually repressive era like the Victorian Era) women still say EWWWW when anyone says anything about sex, or the organs involved in it.      I think I'm one of the... five or less women that I know that doesn't cringe at the word vagina.  Why would you cringe at the word when you have one?  I can't understand it.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	Societal conditioning|`|jiwTWNNtaa	Let's talk about evolution. It's important that women have loyal protection by a mate for themselves and children. To get that, they must not appear slutty or a loyal mate is not going to happen.   Women are kept innocent by people who are protecting us and kept innocent by ourselves to appear alluring to the right mate. (it's an image, not a reality, but that doesn't give someone the right to speak in front of me like I'm a whore and have heard it all!!)    To talk dirty in front of a woman is very rude. It's either a very crappy come-on, some kind of turn-on to the guy, or abuse. Sex talk between men and women should be reserved for the best of friends. Between good friends, it is very fun.|`|A2u06IS1aa	becuz guys think theyr the **** haha(:|`|gIcg7Ug2aa	Uh!  Not the women I know.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Not all women think sex is a crime or a dirty little secret.  It is perfectly allright to talk about it at the right time and place.  ;)|`|suVispAAaa	First not all women are like that!! But, those who are like that & do not talk openly about sex are to self concious or proud. I for one think it is distrubing talking about it to others, that is something that should be special & kept between to the 2 people involved. I think guys just like to share their personal life to feel all tough & like the big shot!!|`|mzl4sOKoaa	Not all women are like that.|`|tJa60S4Taa	I think it shouldn't be openly talked about. I also think it shouldn't be done often, and only for creating children, and before you call me a Catholic bigot, I'm not Christian.|`|8ZoSSslFaa	Umm idk i am a woman and I don't so don't say that we all do.|`|JgKosPJpaa	the women who act like that are hypocrites. i mean, everyone likes to have sex. lol|`|nv0nIj3Daa	cuz they wanna look like big bad girls|`|AA11401067	Um, all I can tell you all is that for myself, I'd have that conversation with my lover. Not with relative strangers, as though it were a group sport!|`|vVTmJjJDaa	to me, it depends on the context in which you're speaking of:      when i'm with my man, no topic is off-limits - especially when it comes to sex...after all, better communication leads to better sex!      when i'm with my female friends, the topic of sex isn't off-limits in general, but what IS off-limits is describing specific details about my private sexual encounters...    and finally, when it comes to *mixed company* (as in hanging out with other couples), aside from an occasional harmless innuendo/joke alluding to such, it simply isn't generally seen as "polite" to talk about - regardless of whether you're male or female.|`|ZYOwcdVcaa	Because women are a reflection of the society they live in. For example, if all women openly and constantly talked about sex, they'd lose a sense of innocence and sensitivity--in my opinion--that most men find attractive. Babies need sensitive and caring mothers aware of their society's values, for without that sensitive and loving trait, the baby would die due to lack of care and attention--so the careless and non-aware characteristic gene in women would have died off by now. Therefore, because society needs an innocent and aware connection around it--where men are opposite to that--women are the answer; women need to show innocence and reflect society's value for sensitivity by not exposing such crude things such as 'sex' with society.    Answer mine?  First question under my profile titled "How do I get her to like me?"|`|9CHsxrJFaa	Well I don't think it's a crime or a dirty little secret it's a fact of life.|`|sTgT1lyKaa	Good question!  When you get a real answer please let me know...|`|8VEEihaqaa	I don't think like that, I love sex, I couldn't personally have a relationship without sex, and I'll talk openly about it with anyone who asks.|`|AA12290249	because of media and some guys just don't care about the girl and stuff. they want to protect themselves.|`|F6tMSEyGaa	not all chicks r like that some like it and its because women are always righte they never think or admit they are wrong|`|Qh5Pollvaa	because they are women, all they can do is cook and clean and thats all they should do    ^-^|`|KcAehrrKaa	Some men don't show empathy for women and only care about themselves.|`|5yFmO1peaa	ask your mom.............   all women are not like that.......|`|vm5TgsQwaa	women think sex is a sacred thing  we don't think it is something people should joke about it|`|o88qLRgbaa	Because we're the ones who have to deal with the dirty secret and the crying, expensive little aftermath. You can walk away.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Not really sure who you've been talking to but I'm pretty sure most women talk about sex especially with their friends. But women also don't like big mouth men that like to spread rumors and lies about the women they have slept with.|`|mZelbkwEaa	Depends on the Girl. Some people are comfortable with there sexuality and some just are not it just depends on the specific person.|`|LrMTI8Kzaa	It's nature.|`|5vaBqfDIaa	For some reason, society is set up in a way that men can brag about having sex, and it's "well on you, mate," but women are accused of being sluts if they say anything.  Women don't think it's vile, just something more valuable than bragging rights...|`|a9bfb7859e7ead6aed17febc4c739cc6aa	....because, when women do what men do they are called things like whore or ****. while the man is called a player or ladies man. You've probably heard that.  Personally, i don't feel that sex is a crime, but i do believe that pre-maritial or extra-maritial sex is a sin. Many girls may have grown up in a religion or household with similar beliefs, and even though they don't believe those values anymore, the idea of sinning makes them feel like they have committed a crime. Does that make sense?  I think women just focus more on the feeling of "loving" if you will, someone to have sex while men are more stimulated by the physical thought of love making.  Men see it as a way to express intrest or attraction and women see it as a way of sharing emotions and feelings.  :/ hope that helps you out some.|`|zbyd3Eoraa	It is not respecting your partner.|`|qEsas2Ssaa	You're with the wrong women.|`|zWW5sO1Caa	Because girls are the ones who have to cary the baby inside them!...i dont know!    mine please?  http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|Mkroj9gPaa	because its a personal thing. plus, its supposed to be shared between two people only.|`|Ai8H5N8paa	they are just more conservative and like it to be a more personal passionate quiet talked about thing|`|iFRBrCmvaa	Not all women are that way. I'm very open about sex and my sex life. Unfortunately it's pretty nonexistent right now though.|`|0mamF6jxaa	cuz a lot of women think it's a private thing, and don't like to talk about that in front of people|`|1899lYjMaa	Their fathers raised them that way! Why? because they want to protect their little girls (and their own sanity)|`|rctPP4hlaa	To women, sex means something totally different than what it means to men. We have the ability to see --right in the middle of passion-- the depth of the experience, the fear of being neglected afterward, and the weight of the responsibility that comes with that little word- "sex".  She thinks of all those things, has the burden of being able to decipher what your definition of "sex" means, and after all that, has to decide whether or not to have sex with you.  Sex is not something women talk about in the open with each other, regardless of what you've seen on TV, unless it's -like- their best friend., and even then, it's usually reserved and embarrassing to talk about openly.  I would suggest just being sensitive to her feelings because obviously, she doesn't think of sex the way you and a lot of guys do.  Sex is a delicate matter to most women and it is an intimate, sensual, loving, caring, trusting thing --not just some casual conversation.|`|HA49yOUOaa	well.... maybe girls are uncomfortable talking about it is because they could be afraid of getting pregnant it can happen ya know then  you have to do a lot more than do homework.....|`|xkZbjKNdaa	it depends on who you are talkin to    u see some women are prostitutes  so not all women are like that     but... it depends on how you are talkin about sex  and the way you go about things  there are certain ways to talk about it  && if you dnt talk about it they way they would like you to talk   about it then u will most likely get called a perv or some stuff like that|`|Sbmte7psaa	It all depends on who you talk to... Most women now days do not feel that way..... in fact some of my older co-worker think I'm a perv by the way I talk and I am a woman......      At least last I checked I was.|`|bpxd9cyLaa	not all women think it is.  i don't think that.  but it does tend to be women because we dont HAVE to show off to our mates about sex, we can find other things to talk about.  i don't think men are pervs for talking about sex, but i DO think they are crossing the line when they go into graphic detail.  yes, we should talk about sex more often, but not in the way men do.  you will find that women do talk about sex, they just take a more subtle approach to it, and don't talk about it brashly or distastefully.|`|PJ9XNNhYaa	Sex is private. Women need to feel safe and secure before talking about sex. But once we feel safe and free, then we can let out our inner freak.
5NKa5Y8laa	Different laws apply around the world.  In most western countries, having sex with a step-brother-sister-father-mother, would be considered incest because of the strong family ties.  Step-siblings are raised together, and have the same sibling-relationship as blood-siblings. A blood connection makes it illegal and immoral to have sex with your sibling.  The family-bond makes it immoral to have sex with a step-sibilng.    And I would say that most people would go "ewwww no way", when the though of having sex with a sibling of any kind.|`|naequcqlaa	IF there is NO blood relations in any way, it's legal.  It's not like you're be going w/your "real" sister or not.  The only connections would be thru a marriage.  Yes, it would be legal...:)|`|lezq1eiEaa	technically it's legal! SICK, BUT LEGAL|`|gmefdkZsaa	its legal. but its right. there are so many other guys out there, I mean seriously doesnt that sound a little weird to you?|`|5FH5EibEaa	it is not illegal but awkward and complicate things around the family and relatives.|`|gmpW9nmgaa	it's legal, i think it would be rather wrong if the they had been step brother and sister since they were like two years old, but if it's a fairly recent marriage then i don't see the problem.|`|vdmAOQ3Paa	I don't think it is against the law the moral of borther and sister (even step of half) is frowned upon.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	legal yes(provided the age thing isnt an issue), normal...its getting more common but i would say not, right? IMHO not at all|`|NoGmacqNaa	It isnt morral but its legal Its called incest! I dont think it is normal or rite hahah!|`|81wvN8Rraa	It's not illegal but I'm sure your parents wouldn't be happy about it. Also if both parties are minors it could be big trouble.
GmTs1BB1aa	ahhh just relax  (:  start with conversation ,  pay attention to body language.  if she's facing you, touching her face a lot, or her hair, that's a good sign.  are her arms crossed ?  or legs crossed away from you ? this could be a bad sign.  flirt your butt off (:  which is always the first step.  if that goes well mention you're cold, if she says me too then be like awh well lets warm up (: and put your arm around her.  also, ice breakers !  avoid awkward silence, or just being uncomfortable.  thumb wrestle, have her try to teach you to braid hair, something flirty and fun (:  and last of all don't worry and haveee funnn !  (:|`|A2u06IS1aa	At the party try and see if she'll flirt with you first. And also if she flirts with you[even if she doesnt] still try to make it a little obvious. Oh and ALWAYS MAKE SURE that you are always yourself. Its better that she likes you who are. And always show your feelings. Its more manly. (;|`|RsnKo6Okaa	Just casually talk to her at first, and at that, talk about topics you are both comfortable with.  Then, start flirting.      Hope I helped! Good luck!|`|eSDNSq4zaa	i have the same thing. its hard for me in situations with guys:P  but you have to approach them say hi act casual and be like whats up?  just try to be as brave as you can and keep telling yourself i dont care what people think im going to be my charming self and if it doesnt work out ill get on with my life.|`|KCKq9duJaa	GO STEELERS   thats all you can say|`|p82sIbAAaa	don't worry bout it. all u gotta do is be cool and don't bug her.

Don't forget though if yal arnt ready, still be friends and be patient. Good luck and don't 4get 2 have fun!!! :-)|`|OQuyxByGaa	small talk at least|`|G3HxgCmvaa	Alright well the first thing that is MOST important is that you absolutely have to be yourself. Girls arent wanna date a guy that is totally different then what they thought. Ok if you want to make a move you should probably make a conversation with her. And if you wanna take it a step farther just make small physical contact like touching hands a little and stuff. Good luck man i hope i helped you out.|`|ESm8xXwfaa	the best thing you can do is to be confident. confidence is what attracts. then if you think it is a good time make a subtle move. depending on how long the two of you have been dating, she could be waiting for you to make a move and hoping, or she could be surprised. you will never know until you try.|`|oM9lWOJoaa	Dont thnk dat u hav 2 make a step...jst b in normal mood...lyk u r at ur classes.!!ok.??dnt tak abt stdys thou..jst enjoy d ambience..strt a conversation abt sumthng arnd u...

Remember that girls love good listeners, so smile, ask her a question about her favorite things to do, teams, food, music,whatever-and listen carefully-maybe you will get an idea of a good invitation to extend to her later, and maybe see how enthusiastic she seems about continuing the conversation.  Have fun.|`|Sai9Y9Puaa	well you need not to be nervous. If you feel nervous take a deep breaths and remember that your at a party so have fun. Hang out with her during the party and dintt forget to do some innocent flirting. Be a tower of politness and sweetness. Get her a drink , but dont wait on her. I'm not sure how you are in Class , but if your shy let lose a little at the party.    Good  Luck
SsGLm3Xvaa	Because not everyone sees sex as something personal and important - they really should.    And if they were drunk or something, it could have happened without them planning it before that night or something.    But no matter whether they had it planned for weeks, or if it "just happened", it's not okay if someone cheated on you.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	A few drinks, the right words, the right location, the right mood, yeah, sometimes things just happen.    Stalking someone, maneuvering into a situation where they feel insecure, yeah they can call that just happening too.    Also if they are guilty, they will blame it on just happening.
c7CL9x7Yaa	I think the men just want some connection to the outside world and the ability to say that they have a woman waiting for them. I think that the women either feel that they can't do any better or they like the idea of having a man she knows won't be with another woman....unless they are married. Then I would hope they would stay together for love|`|180rE9rGaa	are you going to rob a bank now? for the women?|`|qVL5R8nuaa	I wouldn't do it.

Go to your local elementary school and you'd be shocked at how some the kids behave. I witness little girl doing things they obviously had to see an adult do. For ex:  My son came home with $20 (2nd grader) I questioned him where it came from he stated a female class gave it to him. Being a good parent I called the little girl mother and my child's teacher. The little girl had been buying some candy, ice cream and sometimes giving him money, but usually less than .50 cents, that's why I did notice the money before. Long story short, the little girl had either a really big crush on my son or she's copying what she seeing. Showering a guy with gifts to get him.

I do get tired of hearing it, but at times, like lately i mention it, and then all they want to do is talk about what happened, and i dont want to really talk about it. So my advise is to give your condolences and then try to move on, if they dont feel comfortable talking about.|`|CUsqvrDPaa	Well it doesn't help or make you feel any better, but I guess I'm not sure what else someone can say. I lost my dad to cancer when I was 15 at school, and I think for a while, all I wanted was to be left alone. Now like 7 years later, it's a lot easier for me to talk about it, but at the time, I didn't really want people to ask me any questions, or to ask how I was doing. Time heals all wounds, or at least makes them more tolerable.|`|hOUEIEmBaa	Its a acknowledgment is all. Its very hard to know what to say but that seems to be all it is. I have pondered on that as well and really have to adopt that with others who have had similar situations. But to say nothing to the individual may be considered insensitive or cold in a way. I guess the only way to look at it is to put yourself in the shoes of the individual that found out and think of a response or acknowledgment.
AA11798469	I think you should have moved on about 7 years and 2 kids ago but I suspect you already know that. Your only 30 years old and your whole life is ahead of you. If your unhappy how are your children going to be? Perhaps if  Mr. Not quite ready to be a real Adult gets the idea that he stands to lose you his tune may change but regardless you need to be with someone who trusts and values you as a wife and partner. Dump him and for a change you be the doubtful one about him.|`|0br57yKDaa	mm mm this is a tough one because i'm in the same boat but for not as long i have been with my man for 5 yrs and have 2 kids, i recon i will be were u are and still have no ring as well lol anyways getting off topic, on one hand i think u should stay for the sake of the kids but on the other hand u need to be happy in life as well, u can't stay in the relationship if it only for the kids. whats the saying: Kids would prefer to be from a broken home then to live in a broken home, so if u do still love him and think u can survive without getting married then stay but if you want and need to get married one day then i say leave, believe me i will only wait another couple of years cause my man knows i really really want and need to get married. so if he isn't up for it leave.  i hope this helps you and good luck....|`|veZLfnGFaa	After all you said, you never said that you were happy or that you loved him.  Is this a relationship out of convenience?  You have 3 kids with him and have gotten comfortable living the way you do, and it sounds like he has, too.  Talk to him and tell him that if he isn't going to marry you, that you'd better move on and make a life for you and the kids. Good Luck :)|`|xyrSl2nSaa	you dont HAVE to be married. The only difference for you is a legal document. If you are happy with him then why is such a big deal to get married?|`|05127d9f3597aeb84e80058e806af80aaa	It depends on how you feel, I guess.  If you really love him, you should try to stay with him.  But talk it out; this is a big issue, whether he thinks it is or not.  Maybe you guys could go to some kind of counseling or something to work it out.  But that's if the guy's worth it; if not, it may be time to move on.  But if you really like him, you may want to try hard to work this out.  But I can see where you're coming from.  If he ends up not respecting your wishes whatever you guys do, it may be time to move on.  This is obviously a very important issue with you, so if he can't see that and understand that, then maybe it's not meant to be.|`|AA10702820	Don't let people tell you what to do because most likely they are from the outside looking in. You are the one who's living it each day-not them. That said, clear out everything from your head now and ask yourself if you are truly happy right now. If you can't say "yes" and feel as if you should move on then do it. If you want a husband and not a boyfriend, then maybe you should move on because you never know who could be out there waiting for a person like you. Being a single mom for now may not be the easiest thing in the world but don't let people make you think that moving on would be such a bad thing. Its your life and you should do what you feel is best for you and your kids.    If you wanted to get married and this man you're with doesn't want to then maybe you should find a man who will get married to you. I believe that you should marry when you truly love someone, wanna spend the rest of your life with them and when you are in a stable relationship and understand what it will be like marrying a person. I think marriage is more than a dress. That said, if this man turned you down once and still doesn't wanna get married and you're not wanting to remain his girlfriend for the rest of your life then move on for yourself and for the kids.    Don't just decide from what answers you get here. Think about this situation you're in and listen to what you feel you should do.    All the best!!!|`|Hizsm6m4aa	If the relationship is otherwise fine don't trip cause there is a lot worse out there. By no means settle and compromise if this is important to you, but if you have 3 kids and live together...after 9 yrs... you haven't really shown that it was a big priority. Could it be that other people are butting in and making comments? Yes you should be married if it means a lot to you, and if he doesn't want to then take a hint. If it is that important then it may have to be with someone else. Just remember dating is not that fun when you deal with men who lie and play games so take your time making your decision. In the end it's best your kids are with their dad.|`|fen79tTnaa	If your happy in your current state, don't force marriage on to the relationship. You honestly don't need a piece of paper to say your in love. Many people think you NEED to be married to make it "right" or "real", but in reality it may not. Society says in order for it to be love it has to marriage. But that's not true. If your happy, he doesn't hurt you, abuse you, supports you mentally.. good to your children. Then why move on? I think this stepping stone, turning thirty, is making you think that you need to finalize things RIGHT NOW. If your happy don't change anything, if you really feel a need to persist then I would talk to him about it and tell him if would make you happy.|`|bvTXm6SSaa	The real question is if your happy.  Do you have to have a wedding to rectify your love?  If your happy with him then stay.  If not, move on.
el8yX5q3aa	You said it.  You would be going back to him for other reasons than caring for him.  Not fair or honest to him or you.    You shouldn't use people honey....someday someone will use you too and it is not a good feeling.  Be honest ....the good things come to those who wait.       You could be missing out on someone important while tied up with someone you don't really care for.  Goodness...you are young.  Learn to live with yourself and be strong...and then you will have a lot to offer someone.     You didn't fix the problem between you...and it wont get better unless you do.  I have a feeling neither of you are ready to face problems and make it work...as neither of you want to be alone..but you dont want each other either.  You just want SOMEONE.    Wait it out...take one day at a time...you will find the right one.|`|hd442Ha5aa	It sounds like your ex isn't the one interested in you. His friend is which is why he's trying to use your ex as a way of getting to know if you are still hooked on him. It also doesn't sound like you actually want to be with your ex, like you said you just want to fill in the void.|`|gX40pgLyaa	stop talkin 2  his friend. he is messin wit u|`|SsGLm3Xvaa	His friend could just be trying to get you back together with your ex because he does think your ex likes you still... or he could just be messing with you.  I don't know what he's like.    I say, especially since it seems like getting back together with your ex is a bad idea for you, stop talking to his friend and stop trying to talk to him.|`|vGWD8Zncaa	From the sound of it, he may have been correct that there wasn't much communication.    It sounds like you're spending far too much time overthinking it and GUESSING about it as opposed to really TALKING to whom you need to.    One piece of advice though - if you're failing exams over this, you're getting WAY too worked up over it.|`|SpfAjQkJaa	Hey!  Situations like this are always confusing...  Disclaimer: I don't know all about your situation. It takes more than just a short summary of past events to know what is really, really going on. But I will try, as best as I can to give even if just a bit just a little bit of advice.  First off, I am really sorry that happened to you. I noticed that he was a big part of your life. You seem to still have feelings for him, if you are contemplating returning to him. If you were completely over him, I would think you wouldn't really care it he did care for you, or his friends or anything to do with him.  About his friend/s... that is really annoyinng. Here you are trying to get over your ex and they won't stop harrassing you! Hmm, maybe your ex does still have feelings for you. It is possible. But if you asked him and he declined then probably not. You say it is HIS friends that are telling you this. Why would they? Why would they care to spend there time making sure you know this information if your ex told you it was untrue. If he wanted to get back together wouldn't he say, "Yeah... I do, I just did not know how to tell you..?"- or something like that. Then again, maybe his friend has a thing for you. How knows? Guys are strange at times... Again I am not positive, but yeah.  I take it that the breakup happened like two weeks or so ago because I just had my exams. It is normal that you are lonely, Don't let that lonliness influence your decisions. Worst thing you can do- trust me. If you think he lied to you and such and you don't trust him- why bother? It just was not meant to be; that is possible. There are other guys. First you have to figure out if you are over him or if your feelings for him becoming weaker, if they are move on. That's it move on. But if you still do and alot then go talk to him. Face to face; do it one way or another. This will take some time, you know, to sort your feelings. When you do and if you decide to confront him, talk to him if he is being honest, that he is over you. If he is move on. After the talk you should now what to do? If he does want to get back together, ask for some time to think about it. And do that, think about it! If he is not your true love, don't settle. You are probably worth more than that. Again don't let your loneliness drive you.   In the end I would just ignore his friends. They can be up to anyone. Who knows?? Make your own decisions. Leave and cut of all contact if you feel the only reason you would consider getting back together with him is because of his friends, and there gossip. Leave. There is obviously something wrong with that...  Anyways, in the end- think about it, rationally, and do what will really make you happy. Inside, you know what that is.  Hope I helped  Good luck  ~~Steph :)  P.S.- sorry for this long answer. I guess I had a lot to say-- experience. lol. :)|`|TdRVzKfZaa	Katie?    Er, evermind.    Instead of asking people on Yahoo answers, think about it for yourself.    Do what you think.    Maybe theres someone out there who likes you and you don't even know it.

zzUgYFy4aa	this can be a story about a young boy on his quest to manhood .
gwHmR2LWaa	WE ELOPED TOO!  It was great!  Totally agree with what you've described.      Funny, I'm a hobbyist floral designer and wedding coordinator (25 years), yet we chose to do it quietly.....so that we could enjoy our time together (ours alone...no issues....didn't have to worry about entertaining everyone or being entertained..).   Before we eloped, I had prepared some very nice announcements and included a photo.  We sent these out the day or day after we eloped.    In answer to your question, simply go to your local County Recorders Office (or go onto the website and goggle "marriage license" and the county and state you're in).      Your and your fiance will need to apply for a marriage license, pay the fee, then you have a certain amount of time to get married before a Justice of the Peace, at any courthouse that performs these services (just like what many have already answered).  Call the courthouse to schedule the date and time.  or   You can call, schedule and go to any wedding chapel for a  fee to "seal the deal" (per see).  It didn't cost much either.     Whatever you chose to do (wedding chapel or Justice of the Peace) you can bring a bouquet and a boutonnire (for your fiance) to use during the brief service.    Shortly after the service, we went away to Santa Barbara for 3 days (brought our small wedding cake and a bottle of champagne with us to have at the hotel for our private moment).....went out to a very nice restaurant for dinner for the occasion.  It was memorable.    Best wishes!|`|sMUiGFPraa	Go to your local courthouse. All you need id a justice of peace and they offer that (for a fee) at the time you apply for the marriage license.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Good for you!  All you really need is a license, and a justice of the peace, a judge,   or a minister of your choice to perform the ceremony, and witness(es),   (the number might depend on State law).  Do consider though, that in our society, you're 'burning some bridges'   with certain friends & family who are going to feel 'left out' and excluded.  You might consider throwing a small dinner party or something else   simple and easy not to offend them.|`|81wvN8Rraa	All you need is a marriage license and a Justice of the peace to perform the ceremony. Both can be found at your local court house.|`|I1SP0tBMaa	you can go to your local court house and have the judge marry you this is what my husband and i did, i never understood those weddings that cost thousands of dollars when all we needed was 50$. good luck
YQLmmEjQaa	Well am not a parent but i think they should at least be 14*at that age their at least mature enough'' , if not they're just looking for attention , because their friends have it they want it or its cool , they just want to be involved with whats ''In'' .   But the truth is they really have no purpose being on there & probably dotn know how to use most of the applications or how it functions ? ..:S  After all it started out as just a social thing for college/university students but it seems to be now that ANYONE can join.I just use it because its pretty fun and i like the idea of staying in touch and finding past pple/friends i had that are now back in my life in a way ;)|`|WkdW04cNaa	My real answer is 18 and that is because facebook has things on there that younger people shouldn't be seeing.  A lot of their applications and advertisements are not suited for children and it isn't something you can block.  I know that there are young people who want to be on there before 18 but I really don't think it's a great idea.  I think there should be a facebook or something like it for children.  Maybe you could work on that and make lots of money.|`|uzW2rEbPaa	10|`|VFi86a5oaa	I personally know many 12-14 year-olds with a Face Book and they're more mature and capable of using it than the majority of "Adults" on there.|`|IYgTS1eiaa	Hmm, well im a kid and i dont think kids SHOULD have facebook. But if they want it lets see...    Well depends on there maturity, If they are imature, get in fights or do anything u dont want them to, then i geusse 16 would be good. They do have naughty advertisements. But in the most part it is fine. If they are mature, dont get in fights, dont do stuff wrong. Then 12 is good. And if its in the middle you decide. But in short form    Mature = 12  Kinda Mature = 13-14  Normal = 15  Not to mature = 16  Imature = 17    Also, i know u will be thinking, Well if its just bad advertisements, 14 will be good. But also think facebook is a place to put what ever u want. They can talk about relationships, naughty photos, Bad videos. If there is a imature girl, she will put those things at a younger age then mature girls. mature girls will proboly not even do that.    So again, what i said b4 i think will be good. also, you need to thin HONESTLY what ur kids are in maturity, you dont need to tell anyone so dont be all protective, be honest. Did they earn it???    ME: im a 12 year old boy, i do have facebook and i go on it alot, No videos, 1 Picture, NO INFO on my life. And my parents trust me. Ive NEVER been grounded, in trouble, got a grade worse then a C+ and only once had to talk to the teacher about something negative, and that was i forgot the homework and i need to hand it in tomorow.    So i say it depends on there maturity level. And if u dont want to think about it then i say a average of 15 would be good|`|zczneZ7baa	im not a parent but id say about 13-15 depending on the maturity of said child|`|pRF5LLloaa	My estimation -- about 40.|`|efdb04ba6a4a066db7fc97aeb97e9037aa	Depends upon the maturity of the child.  You want an open-book on the topic so that the child understands your concerns.  An immature child might resent your concern.|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	16.    That way it's slightly less disturbing for the rest of the adult world when we stumble on pictures of these kids in their tanktop/shorty short pj's trying to look "sexy".    It's still unpleasant at 16, mind you. But at least it's not upsetting.

ES1bhCyIaa	Keep him in the room, he's a baby, he doesn't give a damn.|`|5fddee5d516dbf3609553f5f2f053062aa	Being a parent comes before you engaging in  sexual activity.  The day you got pregnant was the day your life changed forever.  You have a child that you are responsible for.  If you wish to engage in sex or whatever other activity, be responsible and hire a baby sitter.  Do not leave the child unattended because something can happen.|`|672d45cf5053056aa311fd923b5d915faa	UHHH, yes that is wrong for doing that. just wait til your baby goes to sleep & he/she can stay in the room, just don't be loud.

AA10065812	If fully depends on your state laws.  If you live in Missouri, all you have to do is violate the court ordered visitation for six months in order to allow the adoption without his knowing.      Have you been punishing your child by denying access to the father for six months or more?|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	No way, absolutely not.  The biological father must terminate his parental rights.  If he can't be found, you must make an effort to find him.  You can't just say, "Oh, my new husband is going to be such a better father to my son, so I'm just going to let new hubby adopt him and to hell with the biological father."  I wish I had a nickel for every time I've seen a question like this.  I'd have a brand new car.  No, you cannot let a new man adopt your child without the biological father's permission, and no, you cannot change the child's last name either.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	No he can't - the natural father (bio) of your child has to be notified and he has to ok this.  If the bio father signs off on allowing the adoption, you do understand that he will not be obligated to pay any more child support for your son.|`|GHd84xipaa	i would suggest talking to a lawyer on this.i do believe your ex-husband has to agree on this.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	The father of your child has inviolate parental rights, same as you.  You cannot just decide your new husband will adopt your child.    Get an attorney, and don't come here and ask questions like this.  And yes, I'm reacting to your avatar, because it makes you look about 15.|`|cdQryr7paa	The biological father must release his parental rights to the child.  If he doesn't, your current husband will not be allowed to adopt him.  If he relinquishes his parental rights, he is no longer legally the father of the boy.  He doesn't have legal right to visitation nor does he have to pay any support for the child.  Your current husband will assume all financial responsibility for your son.  When I met my wife, my son was 18 months old and I adopted him.  You must get the X husband to relinquish his parental rights.|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	you have to  agree|`|bYoKSMNKaa	I dont think you can just pop a letter off to the ex. I think he has to agree to relinquish all rights - u also relinquish child support (I think). I only know of adoptions by the new partner when the ex has died.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	1. Your new husband can't adopt your son unless the biological father signs over his rights to the child. If you don't know where he is, you must make every attempt to find him, and inform him. Otherwise, you must run an ad in the paper of the area you think he is for a certain amount of time.   2. If you are receiving child support, or any other type of support from him, you won't get it any more.|`|81wvN8Rraa	You have to have approval from your ex. As long as he still has rights your son can't be adopted.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	on with child father permission|`|WmZqykz1aa	Laws vary from state to state, so what applies to us might not apply to you.  I'd get an opinion from a lawyer.  Your district attorney could probably give you 5 minutes and a rundown, but a family lawyer would be better able to help you.    In at least one state where we lived, if a biological parent did not provide child support or attempt to contact the child for one year, that parent was seen by the court as having relinquished parental rights.  However, the other parent could not prevent the parent from contacting the child.  Doing so resets the clock to "zero," and you have to wait another year with no contact.      In all cases, the adoption will have to go through a court, so you need to find out what is required.  Your new husband will probably have to undergo a background check to satisfy the adoption court.    You don't say where you live, so the best advice remains "see a local family lawyer or call the local family court for advice."|`|ixRkfLjIaa	Your current husband is taking a huge financial risk, once he does this, even if you guys divorce, which there is a 50% chance, he will still be on the hook for child support for a child that's not his.

08d1e5233f3b30ec082c65faefd9a480aa	I am an adult and I understand where your coming from.  I was treated the same way growing up and it sucks.  Your parents should show you some kind of trust or let you earn it.  Unless you have already lost it somehow?  Have you tried to talk to them about this?  If talking don't work try writing a letter.  Ask them to compromise with you somehow.  The best thing is to always be honest with them.  If you are then they will have no reason to not trust you.  But they need to know that friends and friends of the opposite sex are part of growing as a young adult and needed.  It could backfire on them if they are too strict.  I'm not saying that they should let you do what ever you want but they could loosen up a bit!|`|3ijLQe5laa	your still a child|`|SC91Uwrhaa	13! You're too young to be thinking about all this. if I was your mother I would act the same way about girls and going out.|`|I5ccK5Qfaa	Dude chill you'll ''get some'' when your older. Too young right now sorry bro.|`|RxJzvUu7aa	I know how you feel, my parents were like that when I was a teen, trust me they just want the best for you and someday you will understand.|`|VjqEi5wZaa	*gasp!* A 13 year old is actually answering this question! It's true! I would say step carefully. Don't just discuss things as they come up. Sit down with them and explain your reasoning and that you think you're ready for a little more freedom. Be sure to know exactly why, and be sure to try and predict what their responses will be, the come up with a defense for it. If you can be calm and mature about it they will respect you a lot more and probably give you a little more freedom with girls and such. Be sure to pick a good time to talk, when they aren't' in the middle of something or stressed out. If you can be calm and adult like, they're more likely to treat you like an adult. That's how I got facebook privileges, texting, instant messaging, and a raise in my allowance.|`|xrdHriOgaa	Oh gosh! you're only 13 give your self sometime don't rush just imagine how her parents act trust me you're not the only one you'll thank them in the end
wMWfCjBpaa	I met with about four before I decided on one, which I didn't hire. Most are percentage and fixed rate based. Meaning, most are 10-15% of the wedding cost, but if it doesn't add up to much then most will just charge a fixed rate starting at $1500 and up. I live in Houston and $1500 doesn't give you much. A good one is around $5000 plus. Honestly, you can plan it yourself. If you need help contact me. I had a lot of fun and no stress. Some wedding planners are a one stop shop. They own the decor and flowers. Instead you can just hire them for that. They make more money doing this than coordinating.     I don't know how much they would make per year. My planner (decor and florist) said she started off slow and now does about three weddings a month. Sometimes she goes on cruises and all that fun stuff for lavish weddings.|`|wIoG2KV2aa	It varies widely based on your geographic location and the cost of the wedding. (If you are in NYC for example, you'll take in a pretty penny, but if you are in rural Nebraska, that would most likely not be the case). On average, they make 10% of the cost of the wedding - $20,000 wedding = $2000 wedding planner fee.|`|zdPqht41aa	i think they take a percent on how much the wedding was|`|UnWOkO6paa	$51,262 a year!      *  Most wedding planners are self-employed. They charge an engaged couple a set fee or a percentage of the total cost of the wedding. So their income can vary greatly, depending on how many clients they have and how elaborate the weddings are.         * Wedding Planners are just like any other profession. You can get one's from 500.00 to $500,000.00. Depends on what you want. Best bet is to sit down before you look for a planner and see what you can afford. Also get a list of clients they have worked for prior, and call them. Also some local better buisiness agencies will have both positive and negative reports of these types of business. As I have said many times before, wedding planning is a self employed career, it all depends on how successful your business is. At first it can be hard to make ends meet with a new business but you can make a good amount of money once you get going.|`|85gpKa4saa	oo i remember watching wedding s.o.s or something like that on slice. for one wedding, it's quite a lot a few thousand i'm not sure if it's 1,000, 7,000 or 10,000. i guess the middle one haha
5DJzp6bMaa	Say nothing Stay out of it|`|b26NgqOFaa	You don't say anything.  You are saying you broke it off right? What's the point of saying anything. Plus if his wife is nosy like me she already knows all about you. I would watch out for her!!!!|`|zDmGngXVaa	Well put your feet in her shoes for 5 minutes! If you were her, would you want to know your husband was sleeping around on you???|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I would not say anything to her at all.

Why would you do that?|`|fMEypXDYaa	Depends, did he tell you he wasn't married? If he did, then do you want him to run that same game on other women? Is it that hard to decide on? Chances are he has run the same game on other women, otherwise why did he pick you up like he did? A man like that is always looking for the next one he can get into bed with. So do you decide to let him run 'wild' so to speak or do you put a stop to his ways?  Flip a coin if it is that hard for you to decide?|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Say nothing at all to her.

Just get far away from the whole thing.|`|nsGBwXCTaa	I think if you was any women at all you would not talk to him anymore and you would tell his wife that is just so wrong to do that women and her kids like that .

Typically the "bearer of bad news" in these situations doesn't come out being thanked. Generally the wife knows if her husband is cheating, but may be in denial. Also consider that it may be a one-time thing for him ... a lifestage crisis ... and one that wouldn't occur again. To go to the wife under such circumstances would be meddling in something that would be none of your business, and might destroy a marriage that would otherwise resolve happily.|`|mE0Xwa5vaa	It would be best if you just left it alone.

My gut tells me "No". If she finds out & comes to you needing answers to whatever.... then be honest. But, hopefully he will never do it again & just let it be...   He lied to you & her. He doesn't deserve his family but maybe he's seen the light & is walking towards being a better man. ~ Don't cause yourself a lot of added drama by going to her.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	why break it it off?|`|L3hc9EOiaa	dont destoy their kids with your hurt, dump him and move on. leave it at that, but if further down the track she confronts you, tell her the truth, that as soon as you found out he was married you kicked his a55 to the kerb|`|EAxjVxTEaa	9 times out of 10 she already knows and if she doesn't don't tell her. Its his problem and if you know the girl and like her then feel free to tell her and tell her you are sorry and that you didn't know and when you found out you broke it off. She will be mad for a while at you but comes to realize he played a hand it to. I think since he got a family I don't think destroying a family is a good thing. Just let the dude know if he cheats again you will let her know. Deal with him not her.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	You know what? I think most people, trying in their heart of hearts to be honest, upright, & moral citizens, would say that they would break it off with him, but in the real world where it's sticky and icky.... I doubt it would really play out that way! Emotions get involved in relationships! If the "other woman" has been with this guy for very long, I'm betting it will be hard for her to let him go, especially because she was under the assumption that he wasn't married!    So to tell the wife or not? A similar dilemma posted here recommended mailing the juicy information to the woman with no return address.    I think you have to consider the pros & cons of it, but more importantly, consider your motive for telling. Would your motive be to get back at him for crossing you - deceiving you by leading you to think he was single when he wasn't?    I'll be honest - I don't know what I would do - so I wish you well.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	can I talk to him if I give her ALL the money?|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	I think that it is better to not say anything because the wife will eventually find out on her own.|`|1978e46edc09459d102fc12e39033842aa	I think I would tell her.  Not to be cruel but so  she has the information she needs to decide for herself if she wants to stay with that useless bastard.  Also, if he is sleeping with other people he could be putting her at risk for an STD.

k6F9zkIRaa	When I think of Beauty and The Beast I think of gold/yellow and royal blue. Probably because the famous picture of them two are them in those colors! Yellow and red do go well together, those were my high school colors so I got used to putting those to colors together.    By the way I love your theme! I'm doing the little mermaid theme!|`|qvGlnAQeaa	Royal blue, yellow, and white if you want a third color.|`|aIJws5MAaa	If you're going to do a strong color like red then the other colors should be more subdued...I personally love red and Ivory (I'm doing dark green and ivory myself)  Good luck!|`|UUQXNhMtaa	You see red and yellow used together a lot and they work well. But if you are uncertain get a color wheel and use it to help make up your mind.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Classic Royal to Navy blue as a main color with white and gold accents? Reminds me of Belle's Dress and the Beast's suit which is a typical image from the movie.

7PXFXcKfaa	you hit the nail on the head when you said "she gets really mad to when nobodys paying attention to her."    Thats exactly what it is - she doesnt particularly want to be in pain or handicapped - shes not a narcissist! But she does like the attention of being ill.    There is a disease you may want to research - Manchausens syndrome - this is when people hurt or intentionally prolong injuries in order to obtain attention from others.  This kind of attention seeking behaviour can be a sign of other things too - like depression, or alzeimers.     I would discuss your concerns with a family member, who maybe will take her to see a doctor.|`|71qGan9Raa	She's old and likes the attention. She's lonely and probably very afraid. She has nobody in her world so she makes certain that her needs are met. Poor thing!|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You have to accept that sometimes people's personalities change as they age...she probably needs some medical attention...don't take it personally...
AA10604300	age is the first issue, she will settle with time.  as there are feminine issues  and then that emptiness that one feels within themselves,     oh, this can only be filled in by God.    One has a yearning and deep desire to get "something" in this life, and finding out what this is, is what is causing a great deal of strife in the lives of young folks.    God and his free gift is the answer,   and then obeying the King James 1611 Bible, follows suit.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	there can be two reasons for this to happen. one' she may reach the age where her hormones are acting up. if this is so, you will soon see her being angry,crying, and be hard to get along with. if you want to know more about this ask your mom, to explain this to you.    the second' have you ever heard of females that start to cry for no reason at all? as if you ask them what is wrong they cannot tell you why. this is because they do not know why. you see many females tend to try and not show their feelings about things, they tend to keep all of their bad feeling inside. as over time these bad feeling tend to build up to the point that they can no longer hold these feeling back. these feeling are from all the things that make her angry, embarrassed,sorry, as well as all other types of feelings. so when this emotion does build up to the point she can not hold it back any longer it, comes out as crying. I do believe most females go threw this at least once in their life. some more, as some never will. for a female tend to not say what is on their minds but hold their feeling back. so when this does come out, they do not understand why they are crying. but I see this as a way for the body to release all this pain built up inside over years. you may not have heard of this before. but again, ask your mom if females cry for no reason at all, and do not know why. maybe she can tell you about this. but I feel it has to do with one of these two reasons i gave you. sorry, this is long.
O36qjj7Oaa	Have dates on the nights your ex has your son.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	How about hiring a sitter and going on a date late at night?  If you go out an hour before your son's bedtime, and come back a couple hours after his bedtime, you really haven't missed that much interaction.  It's also okay to go on a date on a weeknight.  Single people who don't have families waiting on them for dinner can often do that.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Ha.  Well, this depends on the custody/visitation, more than anything.  I've got mine 24/7/365, except for the couple of times a year I take my son to Florida to see his father (for 2 days at a time).    Needless to say, I haven't done much dating.  At all.  But I've done a bit of it.  I've been on Match.com and set up lunch dates while he was at school.  I've dated in Florida while he was with his dad.  He's spent some time in Colorado with my sister and I've dated.      You'll figure it out when the time is right, if ever.  Also, you don't say the age of your child.  I think when your child is of a certain age, you can take a few more liberties, including letting your child meet women you date, etc.  They do need to know someone important to you.  Mine is 12 on Thursday and is pretty healthy, so far.  I'm dating a terrific guy with a 14 year old son and our sons get along very well, so don't think you'll be alone forever.    YES, and I also did what Zelda suggested.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Realistically, yes, in your situation, you will eventually have to hire a sitter. Most women expect a weekend date, especially once things are serious. Someimes you can find another parent (at school or cub scouts or whatever) who is in the same situation you are, and you can trade off with one another. Some people on here are very idealistic and will tell you to be alone for the child's benefit. Well, if you had planned to live exclusively for the child's benefit, you'd still be married, right?|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Single parents date on the nights they don't have visitation with their children. You've got the right idea by not introducing your son to a woman unless the relationship is very serious. In the meantime, you can dialogue with him at an age appropriate level about how Dad hopes to find a lady someday to make him happy, and he hopes that Mom finds someone to make her happy too. This way the child won't feel sandbagged if you introduce him to someone else.    I don't like hiring outside babysitters at all. Keeping it in the family is always best, if possible.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Can you really KNOW if a woman will be around for a long time?    How long she stays around is as much up to YOU as it is to HER - and vice versa. But ultimately - YOU can't CONTROL that.     So limiting yourself to saying "i would not bring women around your son until you are sure they will be around for a long time" -- is kind of like saying, I won't let her see me naked until she married me first.    You can't tell how long a marriage will last going IN. You can only celebrate your anniversary AFTER you have enjoyed the time together. Because that's what it's all about.    Enjoyable time together.    You have a son. A woman would expect you to "love another man's kids" . . . . just read countless online dating profiles where single mothers say "he must love my kids" - before they have even had the first cup of coffee together!! And she's talking about another mans' kids!    Consider that seeing you interract WITH your son is actually a huge PLUS in your favor! "Wow! he's great with his kid!" -- that's very attractive to women.    There is no need to feel GUILTY or APOLOGIZE for wanting what you want. Especially to your son. You are doing the BEST you can with him. You are allowed to want the "BEST" for yourself too.    Even your son will understand that.|`|FMfAcAGpaa	Date when your son is with his mom only.|`|YHcyuka3aa	Unfortunately (for you) you have a child that needs you. I know your waning to have some fun times yourself but your child is first priority. When you think someone will go out with you, explain your situation and maybe something would work out for a home-date. (while you have the child) or you could date on those nights your not working. Who says its a law one has to always have a date on a certain time. If your up fount with someone that you have child then they will be more than happy to help you if they are interested. Your child won't be a child forever so even if you have to wait several years, it will be worth it in the long run!|`|Zg8aORFYaa	You date when you child is with the mother.  I would want to spend all my time with my child.
JKlLd598aa	First and foremost,I would never cheat.I do not do anything I would not want my spouse to do to me.2nd off,being treated badly is no excuse,you have choices,sometimes some are bad,and others worse,you have to make the right ones.Cheating is never a option,there are a million and one ways to stop being treated bad,or even if he has cheated on you,there are better ways to deal with it.Cheating only makes you trashy,and leaving your husband for B.S reasons makes you worse!|`|AA11645861	you are going to hav some guilt!....but as long as u do what makes you happy....then...thats all that really matters|`|6qPndPvXaa	You should be ashamed.

As I have treated him badly at times as well.  That's called marriage.    So yes, I would feel terrible. But I wouldn't do it to begin with.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	Yes, of course I would feel bad.  Infidelity is not okay.  If the marriage was over, I would get divorced, not cheat.  I believe in finishing one relationship before starting the next.|`|NAb1Fwmbaa	No, not at all.  If he treats you badly and you found someone else who love and respect you more - and you love him back. Go for it.      He treat you bad - that's your reason for leaving.  Sure there will be times when you will remember the good moments and wondered if you did the right thing.  Hence, make sure you weigh all the pros and cons before making your decision.  HOwever. once the decision is made...don't feel bad or guilty or blame yourself.  Remember, he treated you badly.|`|BqbtvauDaa	it honestly depends on what he did. if he cheated on me, i would sure as hell cheat back. thats a true case of he got what he deserved. if he was abusive to me, well i wouldn't cheat because that would make the abuse worse, i'd just leave his ***. but yea, i think i would feel bad, because even if he did treat you bad at times during your marriage, he never stooped low enough to cheat on you did he?
ifC1aFHxaa	Yes, he's a sponge, and a layabout, good-for-nothing.   I'll BET your dad would go mad if his wife were living with another man off of his pension!  Unfortunately, you are stuck unless you can get your mother to change her will. I wouldn't hold my breath for that to occur. Apparently he's pretty good to/for your mom and she already has decided what she wants out of this life, and apparently this dead-beat is it.  You gotta let the money go, and deal with the relationships you have. If the kids are all right and you can tolerate being with him occasionally, then that's what you should do.  I would plan, however, a horribly girly shopping day to look at whatever you know he WOULDN'T want to! Maybe that will give yo the opportunity to talk to your mom about the inheritance and what your dad would want for his grand kids.  Good luck, honey.|`|ArcYueAJaa	you cant do nothing coz your mum wont listen to u all u got to do is think if it was you! your mum will learn on her own
66jX06Onaa	As long as it's loving and doesn't get into any issues or problems, yes, it's a good idea.|`|cDubFtwlaa	try it if thats what you really want and are happy with|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Its worth a try.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	yes but give him time to read it
AA12250406	Ada, I'm sorry to tell you this. You may need to get a divorce. I myself am married and I let my wife's male friends come over and have fun and go to the pub. I also let her go out to the clubs by herself. She asked me once,"Why do you allow me so much freedom?" I told her, "Because I'm your husband and not your father", She also let's me go out to pubs and nightclubs all the time. Our relationship is strong and we are very happy. You want freedom? Get a divorce if this continues and also a restraining order because he could be crazy. Good luck with everything!|`|lHCZUPm2aa	It sounds like you need marital counseling or a divorce. He doesn't own you. As for the lederhosen, you just complained about him telling YOU how to dress! Don't be a hypocrite.|`|MpiTctvbaa	If your not happy you should leave him. He's being controlling. But honestly, I would never drink beer with my nor my husbands friends without my husband being there. Its not fair.|`|1978e46edc09459d102fc12e39033842aa	Hmmm. . . .you are German (very progressive culture) and you married an Afghan man (not so progressive culture).  You will not convince him to shake off his third world value system because that is what is most likely ingrained in him.  You can try marital counseling focused on overcoming cultural differences but I doubt he will participate, unless you can find a progressive Afghan or middle eastern therapist to assist you.  Otherwise I would say, divorce.|`|3eac4095162a8fc3b0c7ab465f41b17daa	Don't blame your husband, and manipulate the situation like it was innocent fun.  BEER and OPPOSITE SEX don't go together.    You are married. And really your husband should be the only man in your house, unless your husband is there PERIOD. (unless it is your father)  And your husband should never have women over period either.    Gay men, that is a joke, why can gay people switch back and forth with sex partners and the excuse they are gay,,, should mean what?  Men and women cannot be polluntic friends, because the friendship starts with one of them wanting more, and are being like vultures waiting and waiting    Either except your marriage relationship and respect your husband, or divorce him, before you have a threesome get pregnant and won't have any idea whose baby it is.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	He'll probably get you into a burqa before you ever get him into lederhosen. Huge cultural differences between the two of you. Don't let him take you to Afghanistan, you'll be locked in a closet for the rest of your life.  You have a major problem.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Ada, this is only the beginning of his controlling quest; you don't want any part of it divorce him. His mindset is that you are a woman, you know nothing; not all, my husband is Syrian, however, there are those from there who are of the same caliber.  Mine's a lot more open because he reads alot, he takes a lot of courses and above all he's open; he's never controlling. When a man is as controlling as your husband he'll eventually drive you batty if he hasn't already; you don't want and you don't need that.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Wired that way he is.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	What a dilemma!!!!|`|71qGan9Raa	He is obsessed with you!!! He will rule you, command you and DEMAND things from you.  You will not have any freedom until you are gone from him.   Unfortunately, in their culture, it's okay to beat the wife, actually it is encouraged. Women in their culture do NOT have any power, any thoughts or any control. Your husband is wondering why are you acting so "sexual" because that is what their culture thinks of their women...just sex objects.  Therefore, there is no escaping for you. I am hoping he hasn't beaten you YET.......you could be severely disabled by the time he is done with you.
nNeX1RClaa	Age is only a limit if you make it. Its only a number. and honestly 40 isnt that bad. I understand its tough but whose to tell you not to go to the clubs? Guys like a women whose confident in her body, so be happy with what you have, not what you want, and party it out. Mr.Right is right around the cornier O.~|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	let me see a picture of ya....|`|1bb29480284b74b7e53f51936d85c768aa	YOUR NOT OLD  it's never to late to lose weight   you can look younger by losing weight  just work out and eat more healty|`|owjZhOOhaa	the only thing you have to do is find clothes that flatter your body. just get clothes that work for you and stop comparing yourself to others.|`|a0h7SLMRaa	These days its not about how old you are, but how old you feel.Maybe go visit a gym and get yourself a guest pass and try a few classes to kick start your weight loss and get into an exercise routine , you will feel  younger..more energetic . Exercising after forty can actually increase your life expectancy. If you exercise before you hit menopause, you'll be more likely to exercise later in life. So, it's important to form good exercise habits now.|`|8042dac00a4e81239a58052d23cbb99baa	Stop trying what?|`|aRHhrsrEaa	you don't have to stop trying if you look better you feel better about yourself 40 years old is not too old you are just not a child any more.

She's not going to stop if you let her do that.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	yes shes playing games and you are right to do her like that i would have to. that is mean and iwould hate to wait on her and i never wait for anyone much longer then that. you are so right and i would not have her as friend any more.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	You should have just answered the phone when she called and told her not to bother to come.|`|7Xcl9XLoaa	just tell her u r sick if u dont want to hang out with her so she doesnt get mad unless u want her to be mad|`|Ro2ObPXlaa	Nahhh, sounds good.

Freak her out. Leave a nasty note on your porch for her to see. When she asks about it later, tell her you got bored and went out with someone.|`|K2icX1Ozaa	aright dont play her dumbass games you have got to confront her and see wuts really happening   its possible she just forgot but if she didnt then dont chill with her tonite|`|0dJkuu3daa	well  tell her what a ***** she is for being two hrs late,   then get over it  go have fun|`|vNaAZU3gaa	She sounds like she had other more important endeavors. Is she seeing anyone else? That's messed up what she did. She doesn't sound like a good catch. Find a better girl. I've had my share of bad women and been treated bad before. Now I've got a good girl and now Im happy.|`|lkSDiQ8Naa	Depends how old you are..?    A mature person would just tell their friend that they are being annoying and what they do / don't like instead of stooping to their childish level.|`|9HqgrhyUaa	i do the same thing. but eventually afterwards i feel shitty cause i realize now im stuck at home and i want to go out.|`|XBvSpAYyaa	You did the perfect thing!|`|i8vyUht9aa	there is a-lot nice people out there, find a new friend|`|jfwmelYgaa	Whoa...
A7mAUaxgaa	Love is having an extremely close bond with another person, a kindred spirit with someone who you care about. It's knowing you can share anything with that person and know they are not going to judge you and will stand by you no matter what.    Not sure if that is the best way to explain it to someone from Mars or not, because, I highly doubt they speak English.....|`|N2xzSXosaa	If you could explain love, it wouldn't be love.    You can answer your own question with this.    After 27years, YOU can't even describe it!    Now that's love. =]|`|EsnFmcMFaa	love cant be explained    it is a feeling and feelings cane be explained
KwNpyp3saa	I think your MIL would appreciate getting flowers from you. If you are worried she won't get them then send them to her work. What a great surprise!|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Send them to her work. I'm sure she will appreciate them.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Send her a note telling her how much her kind gesture has meant to you. She will be able to keep it private between the two of you if that is best for her and she will also be able to savor you nice thoughts of reconciliation over and over again. Send it to her place of employment so her son doesn't have to find out. It will not be overtly antagonistic to him and she can always share the note if the time becomes right.|`|s9Uufsr0aa	send a card
wcYRxDw2aa	First off I am so sorry!  My dad is the exact same way.  Just keep your distance for a while and things should ease up.  Don't tell him anything about you unless you want him to know and ask your mom to do the same about you.  Only a few more years and you will be out of there, but by all means if it gets any worse call the cops on him.  Just make sure that you have proof like a pic of the marks or something.  It always helps.|`|AA11267703	You are in a very typical situation you are a teenager and those hormones are ragging. You father is a man no doubt and he has those ragging testerone hormones and sounds like you to butt heads.     I know you don't want him in your business but you are 14 and he is your father and he needs be included in you life. You don't have to tell him everything but if you would ask him for some advise on anything it will pull you together. Make no mistake he does love you.     Like I said you are well on your way to becoming a man it is probably normal for guys to butt heads.     My advise to you is since you are 14 years old your parents are in charge of paying all of your bills and they supply a roof over you head and the cell phone you are texting on right now.     Your dad is probably just pouting because your Mom yelled at him he will get over it. If you want quick results go to your Mom and tell her that you really love your Dad and it hurts you when he ignores you. She will set him straight I promise.     Try and curb your temper and remember they are your parents they deserve your respect and so do you. The way to get respect is to give it. Good luck|`|gYuJUyvvaa	CALL THE COPS    You dad is doing something wrong, call the gosh-dang police!    SERIOUSLY!!!1!|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	He is right, what your dad has done is illegal, and he should be punished or sent to jail. Have you talked through all of this with your mom? If she wont see sence then you're going to have to. Your father is abusive and should not be kept in society until he has went through maybe a jail sentance or anger management. But trust me it is better he is ignoring you, than him raping/hitting you. He should be locked up if he has sexual tentions towards you, not only is this insest, peodifillia and sexual harrasment.   I don't see why your mom is still with your dad. She should get out of there and take you with her, but then again I dont know the whole story.  Raych  Best of luck.|`|e2ccfda0779d310e0b3d6d1cdc69d2d1aa	I will call the cops and file the child abuse because is affecting you and he is controlling your mom. How can a father tells the mother to ignore the child.

Twilight is a book and a crappy movie,  Everything about it is fake.  Unless you run around with werewolves and vampires,  but I think not.  Am I correct? Yes I know for a fact im correct.  So stop wondering if you will find love like Twilight.  Because Im sure you wont find a guy that will "get on datt".|`|VFQyC7Vlaa	Twilight gives a terrible example of what love truly is. And yes, true love does exist, its just hard to find.|`|Sc6oGITNaa	Maybe. But I haven't experienced it yet so that's why I think its a maybe.

The fact the he goes out of his way just to let you know he enjoys your conversations, definitely should tell you that he is into you.    That being said, there is still a chance that he is just trying to sleep with you and has no other intentions.    But he for sure is being more than just friendly|`|hBSh8Y1haa	Be wary--he could have a girlfriend and is looking to cheat on her by testing you out. You have no idea what he is like outside the controlled environment of the workplace, either. He could be sociopathic - so nice at first or to strangers like you but not so nice just below the surface.

Divorce should be there when all other options have been exhausted, and NO other reasonable hopes of reconciliation exist, and all other options are exhausted.

HDFsvJMTaa	LoLoLoLoLoL! Yeah sweetie, he's checkin ya out! I'm guessing that when you dress up, you REALLY go out there and you make a LOUD statement. In HIS mind, he's probably thinking something along these lines, "OHHH, she thinks she's all that today huh?! Well I'll show her!" And so from that you get the 'trying to be, but not so nonchalant' hello. He likes ya girl! He's PRAYING you'll come to him and ask him out so that he wouldn't have to go through the whole turning down scene again. Just do your thing! He's STILL watchin'! LoL!|`|napgiSmXaa	Your question is?       Are you trying to confuse us the same way he's confusing you if so your doing a good job.   I'll try and work it out.  When you make an effort he tends to ignore you.  Perhaps, like me he finds that less attractive than a woman who looks naturally good looking.  It seems to some men that what you women think looks good, us men think looks tarty, not a good look at all.          Actually thinking about it, you say he surrounds himself with women.        Have you considered the possibility that he's a bit in secure around women and when your dressed up he feels he has no chance.       If you want this to go any further I think you are going to have to hold is hand and let him know.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	This sounds like high school stuff. I don't know if he likes you or not, maybe. But it seems like you should both be mature enough if you are working in an office, to stop playing games and just get together - or not.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	I think you need a hobby to fill out your time.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Hes carrying his love with you so be a firecracker and a Honkeytonk woman then, you'll be his more than a memory ....babyblue!|`|fMDS4vTGaa	Sounds like he's got some anxiety about women. Probably surrounds himself with women so he looks like a player, but in reality he is probably just as on and off with them as he is with you.      Also, just because he hangs around women better looking than what you think yourself (and could be cutting yourself short) doesn't mean they are all dying to go out with him either.  They are probably just kidding along with him.    Stop paying so much attention to him and focus on someone/something else.  My guess is that he notices that you are keeping an eye on him and is enjoying the attention you give him and likes to think he's "playing" you.    Play him back, stop caring about what he thinks. Do your job, be busy. Forget about him!  Why should you worry about a guy? Let him work to get your attention if he wants it, otherwise, ignore him.    More than likely that's what all those other women do with him most of the time anyway.
Ixom7U5uaa	Respect their individuality     Tolerate bad habits.. unless its illegal     Shared responsibility in everything - finances, household etc    Trust    GIve more than you get    Listen .. then talk or more important.. just LISTEN    Compliment the little things daily - everyone does something sweet or nice each day    Leave work at work - we spend 15 minutes discussing work day and that is it    Laugh and cry    Have fun and live like you are still a child    Relax.. no one is perfect . but don't settle for less than you feel in heart you deserve.. I do not mean that financially or status wise.. but at a personal level|`|JiUwpYSXaa	That medioca relationship might not be medoca if you work at it.  Many people confuse love with lust and lust doesn't last forever.  Love is where you never think of yourself first.  Better communication and having your partner as your best friend. Always do things together and having shared responsibily.  I am a man & I see nothing wrong with cooking, cleaning or doing dishes. Sex is important but as you note it is not at the top of my list.|`|jcoUS28Laa	WORK!!! tolerance and truth ....be happy with what you have and love because Jesus loves you .. good luck|`|fJZQ6gl4aa	My dear wife and I have been married for over 30 years.  I didnt say all of them were happy, but most of them have been.  Between any two people, one of them has to the head and make most of the important decisions.  When this doesnt happen things start going wrong.  But the head need not be discussed or agreed on, it simply happens and stablishes a pattern.  But these patterns are worked and gained, not imposed.  And dont expect to be head on everythig.  One should lead some aspects of marriage and the other the rest.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Find someone who brings out the best in you and you bring out the best in them.  If he is a "normal" male you need to be attracted to him physically or you will both be miserable.  Women with guys they don't like very much starve them of sex.  Men who are sex starved are not fun to be around and if they have a spine eventually leave - if they don't they might just stay and cheat.    Sometimes mediocre can be fixed.  But only if both people really love each other and they are both willing to work really hard to change.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	My husband and i have been happily married 18 yrs and we love each other more then anything,have always gotten along great,rarely fight,are each others best friend,are both still very affectionate with each other with lots of hugs,kisses and cuddling,are very supportive of each other and have a lot of laughs that is what has keep our marriage successful and long lasting.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Not giving up when things get bad.    Unconditional love.  On both sides.    Learning to TALK to teach other.  Seriously, communication is THE key to a relationship.  If you can talk through everything, you're good to go.    Compromise.    Other than that, it's just finding someone who you have good chemistry with and who posesses all or most of your basic wants. (ie someone who is kind, someone who is funny, etc.).  And you have to be willing to take that leap, which can be scary if you're talking about possibly getting hurt.    Yes, great relationships exist.  Great marriages exist.  Sometimes it takes hard work to get throughthe bad parts to the good parts, but it is worth it.  Granted, I've only been married for almost 5 years, but I am planning on a lifetime of happiness.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Sometimes a mediocre relationship can turn into a great one if the two people involved really care and want it to be one.    But to answer your question, I think the secret to a long lasting happy marriage is the right attitude, realistic expectations, honesty and having a lot of fun together.  Laughing a lot is so important, as is healthy communication and good sex.  We like to find new things to do, adventures to have.  Keep the mind and body healthy.  Talk things out so resentments don't build.  Don't expect the other person to always be in the same mood you are.  Respect each other.
bQR2Ld7Eaa	I would of course be jealous, but I would also be flattered.

bB5d5YVeaa	Gotta love the man-haters answering this question.    Call me old fashioned, but the absolute earliest I have "gone to bed" with a woman was on a fourth date.  First date; handshake goodnight.  Second date; kiss goodnight.  Third date; kissing and touching.  Forth date; things move on from there.    Think what you want, but I see more women becoming intimate with men sooner than what is needed.  Not all women are this way, but many are very needy and think they have to become intimate with guys they just met.  I've gone out with some women as much as 10 times over the course of 3 months before we became intimate.    Ladies?  What's your hurry?|`|KaaHCSPkaa	Yea and then they will know who gave them AIDS or some other STD too.|`|A7mAUaxgaa	Well, I think that you should at least know a little bit about your partner.  I realize that most people have had a one night stand (usually in their 20's and up) and don't feel the need to concern themselves with the small information when all they are doing is satisfying personal "needs".  As long as you're careful, use protection and common sense and knowing where to find the person again... you should be okay.|`|LN5nCjNRaa	Women really shouldn't sleep around anyway..It makes them look bad. But if they do they really should get the guys full name..If not then they are going to have a hard time figuring out who did what or gave them what...And that whole black book idea isn't a bad one...My friend has one and she keeps everything straight that way.|`|AA11788494	I have often thought that since I know a couple of girls who don't know who the father is because they slept with a bunch of different people on vacation in another state.|`|3arJsZ91aa	Women who sleep around should make sure that they have adequate contraception - as should the men.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	They should be using protection to avoid std's and pregnancy but they shouldn't be sleeping around anyways.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Women shouldn't sleep with random men.  Taking his full name sounds as if he's interviewing for a job.  It sounds awful either way.  Taking their name is kinda like.....putting lipstick on a pig.  Did I just say that?|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Or maybe the guys who sleep with random women could pick up some of the slack about this.  I'm sure they have the game going, so they could take some responsibility for how it is played.    This is Marriage and Divorce.  Your question is not only rude, it is out of category.  I haven't seen Maury in years, but when I did see it, the baby mamas had the fathers/prospective fathers there, so someone knew their names.|`|UspK4SQBaa	I think that's between her and the men she has sex with.|`|DenLZAL1aa	Yes, and hopefully they will practice safe sex. Because a woman wouldn't want a child from some lounge predator.|`|yy45iAbtaa	if they don't use protection yes.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I feel sorry for the women who sleep around, but if that's their lifestyle, then by all means they should at least know who the men are! Maybe they should find out why they are the way they are. It's so sad.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	I think if they sleep with that many guys or even just one they should use some protection if not to avid pregnancy at least some disease. Maybe if they like sex with different men that much they should at least get paid.|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Maybe they should do it for lots of other reasons and none of it is for if they got pregnant.     _K_|`|GHd84xipaa	yes,it would sure help,so she can drag them all to in to found out who the father is.that way she can have them tested.she might want to write down the dates she had sex with them too.that would help near it down a little.|`|AA10860594	I don't know. Men typically sleep around more than women, and oftentimes they don't even know the FIRST name let alone the last name of the chick they screw. I think men are more likely to have a bunch of mini me's running around town that they don't even and will never know about.|`|AA11447210	That's up to them. If they don't care about the identity of the guy, and he doesn't care about her identity, then they are both accepting what could possibly happen and that they may not be able to reach each other to notify of any pregnancy/STD that may result.    When you choose to be sexually active, you're choosing to take on the possible consequences of that behavior.
SsI4LLUZaa	It's you and take the caps lock off.
uUfyOLceaa	A woman is always looking for a real man. It could be you. You have some fear of people responding with mockery of your deep feelings. You have some fear of losing her friendship because you tell her you love her. I'm not mocking you when I say you need to stop wringing your hands over saying what you love. Tape a broomstick to your backbone. Practice having courage a few times in front of a mirror. You aren't telling her about your love because a relationship will happen for certain. You're telling her because you need to. Because it's worth finding. Because you can't tell beforehand the good or sad things a relationship will bring. I can guarantee you can live through them and be better for it. Your true friend, if they are true, doesn't lose you just because you say you want a romantic relationship and it doesn't work out. It's more likely that you may not be able to handle just friendship after that. Yes, that is the truly tough part about this. Look in the mirror again. Can you handle it? Good luck.|`|49A8M4ZSaa	You have to  tell her about how you feel. Otherwise, you will end up wondering "What if" for the rest of your life. If you get rejected, well, at least you tried. You already have a good start by being friends.  I think it will be easier for her to love you because she knows you real well. But if it is a "No" you will get, you have to accept.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Maybe you should put this question in the Singles section.|`|AA10461616	Well, if you have not picked up any clues that she thinks of you more than a friend at all, in all these years, she probably doesn't have those type feelings for you.  It's possible, but it's rare when a male and female friend are BOTH thinking of making it more.  That being said, she probably already knows how you feel about her as women are really in tune with those things called emotions.  You are never going to know until you test the waters though.  You don't admit that you are in love with her to us, so if you just really like her and want to date, just ask her on a date.  If you are such good friends, she make think it's worth a try.  The most important think is even if she says no, act OK with it, just be relaxed and don't think of it as rejection.  If you get all weird on her  you will lose her as a friend and you don't want that.|`|AA12272885	Never, ever tell someone you are not involved with that you are in love with them, or even nuts about them.  It is just too creepy and an immediate turn-off.  She isn't deaf and blind (at least I don't think so) so if you are friendly and flirt with her she will get the idea that you are interested in more.  So if you are that crazy about her wait until she is single again, and make a move.  Get some confidence in yourself, that is very attractive to girls.|`|AhRRhe1Yaa	i'm in same boat.I wish he would tell me.
fH0cZIy1aa	It means he likes you and wants to look at your picture. Just take a nice, simple picture that he can look at when he's missing you. Make sure your have on a cute smile, guys love that. Ask him for a picture too, it'll make him feel good knowing that you want to look at him too.|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Well first off, have you guys ever seen each other.  If you havent he wants a picture because he wants to know what you look like.  If you have seen each other, its VERY common for a guy to want his girls picture.  Theirs no secret behind it.  We look at the picture so we can think about what kind of girl we are with.  As long as he doesnt start for asking nude ones, everything will be ok.  Also guys like to show off pict's of their girls to show how hott they are or something.  Dont be insecure about this little thing.|`|EklDkZ79aa	to remember yo ugly face!  so when he sees it, he can runnnn  :]    sikee kidding    seriously since he goes to a different school he probably doesn't remember you.    or maybe he wants to show you off like to his friends  :D

KILFoc6kaa	You need to sit down together and come up with some kind of compromise. Communicate.|`|bO2rzfISaa	It's good for your arthritis. Take a book or crossword for when you're done and he's not.  The day may come when you wish you could go with him once more. He loves it and he loves you and it's good for you. I think you should go. I also think he should do something with you that makes you happy. Every week. :)|`|XjgQ3jDZaa	You should tell him that it's not that you don't want to go, it is just physically draining.  It is great that he wants to be with you, but he should give a little.  Maybe suggest every other week, you pick what you do.  I do agree that he should join a league.|`|DIuE4vshaa	Now this may seem a little stupid but hear me out. Have you thought about getting a Wii and playing virtual bowling at home?     It's just as fun, your arthritis wouldn't hurt so much since there is nothing heavy to throw, and he gets to do something he likes.     Just a thought since I've played the game with my family and we have a great time.|`|66jX06Onaa	What is someplace you like to go to and he doesn't? Discuss it with him from that point of view. If there isn't such a place, perhaps you could go as a loving gesture and take a book or crochet with you. Work on a compromise.|`|7cjqT33Baa	Getting out for physical activity once a week is great for your arthritis, beats sitting at home just letting the muscles atrophy.  I think it's sweet that he wants you to come with him.  What he needs to do is agree to just once or twice a week and set a time limit on it.  Compromise.    That Wii bowling idea was a great suggestion too.  We have it and have a lot of fun with it.|`|IsPlrwiRaa	then go put put|`|DQkDQraOaa	Compromise and go with him but only for one game. That way he gets to bowl and you don't get too tired.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	You two need to compromise. I know that my husband wouldn't want to do something all the time if he knew that I physically hurt afterwards, so I do think he's being a little insensitive. Ask him if you can compromise and just go bowling twice a month. That's once every couple weeks. If he's not willing to compromise, then I would rethink how much he really cares about you, because as you said it's really painful. Have you spoken with a doctor about your health issues and lack of energy? You may have a thyroid disorder. When you do go bowling try bringing a book or some sewing or something with you so you don't get bored.|`|VfuCXCRAaa	Well its nice that he wants to spend more time with you!      So since he really loves bowling, why don't you talked to him about rotating your time together.  That one week you'll go bowling with him if the next week you do something you want to do!      This way its not always bowling but set a date to do something different together atleast once a week.|`|lfQHjp5baa	You know Hon,  I agree with Sandy and Love is Happiness,  Compromise. maybe bowl one game.  Then sit and have a coke and read a Harlequin or Daniel Steele.  Hahahaa.  Then, let him know its his turn to go to something you want to do.  Drag him to the opera or art museum.  He needs that culture, I bet...
exnkBKzgaa	He's family not a total stranger or a friend. It's not unusual for siblings to argue or fight. You should talk to him and tell him how you feel Regarless of what happened he's your big bro and nothing can change that. He's probably already forgotten what took place.
0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Go to the owner if you can with the quote and ask him to honor it. If not, stop the check and tell them that since they didn't honor their quote, you're not doing business with them. I'm very sorry this happened. Also, if you cancel the check and for sure will not be using them, then go on every internet list, the Better Business Bureau, and anywhere you can rate them or write a review and give them a bad review and tell everyone how they gave you a written quote and wouldn't honor it, and how they were going to charge you their purchase price for you to rent and then they get to reuse and make a profit.

(Not that it's happened to me but I would think that would ruin it)|`|71qGan9Raa	terrible musicians, poor music choice, awkward JP or reverend|`|cGbTJobeaa	As a guest I've been to several bad weddings.    Let's see...there was the one where the ceremony was held in downtown Chicago because the bride wanted a beautiful church but refused to get married in the Catholic church (groom is Catholic) because she hates Catholics.  Nice. It took 45 minutes to get there and another 30 minutes to find a parking spot.  All for a 15 minute ceremony.  Oh, and the groom had a major hangover and it was obvious.     Their reception was in the suburbs...45 minutes away.  It was 105 degrees that day and during dinner, a transformer blew and they lost electricity.  After about 20 minutes of sitting in the dark, everyone had to drive another 15 minutes to another banquet hall for the rest of the reception.  That couple got divorced after about 2 years.    Oh...then there was the one where the groom and his parents had a major fight the night before the wedding. So his parents boycotted the wedding.  Somehow I wound up being seated at the table with the groom's extended family and no one would talk to each other.  It was miserable.  That couple got divorced after 1 year.    I had a great time at my sister's wedding, but there was one event that ruined it for her.  My BIL's nephew and another out of town guest were drinking alcohol at the reception. The rent-a-cop at the venue carded them and told them to stop drinking. The other guest stopped drinking.  The nephew continued to drink.  Both were arrested.  The cops did it in a way that the arrests did not disrupt the reception; I only became aware of it when we were leaving and I had to give my sister's SIL directions to the police station.    Most of both families were staying at the Marriott that night.  After our limo arrived at the hotel, we found the 23 year old niece freaking out about her brother's arrest and crying just riding up and down the elevator.  So we took her to our room along with my sister, the bride.  My BIL had to help his elderly dad get settled in his room first (since my BIL's siblings were at the police station dealing with the underage drinking thing) and my sister didn't want to hang out in the honeymoon suite all by herself.      Although the one guest was classy because after he was released from the police station, he bumped into my BIL in the hallway at the hotel.  He wound up coming to my hotel room to apologize to my sister....the nephew never did apologize.  As I'm writing this, I'm realizing how my hotel room wound up becoming party central after the reception. LOL.    It has been 3 years and my sister is still angry about that whole incident ruining her wedding memories.  She and my BIL are still married.|`|ghLdIUz0aa	they actually say if it rains on your wedding that its good luck. i would have to sayyy, bad guests, i woudnt want my guests to hate each other, because alcohol and enemies, only bring cops and a bridezilla.|`|xukz46NFaa	The Bridal Couple not having fun... You can have bad food, bad weather, or bad guests...

Also cheesy venue/decorations. Balloons     F A K E flowers...ewwww. My stepmom used fake flowers in her wedding (when she married my father) and they are shoved in a bookcase where they have sat for 10 years. They weren't even real looking. They were magenta day lilies with other blue and yellow dandelion looking things, wrapped in plastic lace looking stuff. Also a big evil soon to be stepmother, who throws a fit and slaps the grooms daughter in the face on the wedding day in front of all the fam.   My  1 thing to ruin a wedding is ruining a beautiful gown you only get to wear once. (hasn't happened to me, I just have nightmares about it)|`|ceb6c90d8c3e9b8f93dff5e84b9d8499aa	Alcohol... no matter how good the wedding and reception are... alcohol consumption and abuse ruins it all. Especially when people get unruly and rowdy!|`|EwNrlF8jaa	nothing ruins a wedding more than other peoples uninvited advice or ugly comments of what the bride and groom selected for "their" special day. but of course the things you mentioned does put a damper on things but its ones attitude that makes a "ruin" into something sweet.|`|F7O0nLK1aa	being so worried about things going wrong, who cares as long as you have a sense of humor. you cant control everything and still enjoy the moment.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	My guests all started leaving the reception in groups before my husband and I were even done eating. I went around begging the last twenty or so people to stay so someone could blow bubbles at us as we ran out the door. And I didn't get to throw my bouquet.|`|q3iRTCVsaa	I would say a missing Groom or Bride, drunk out of control guests, people getting sick from bad food at the Wedding while the Wedding is still happening..  The police having to get called to your Wedding.  Those are the few things I think can ruin a Wedding.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Tables crammed so closely together that you can't get in or out of your chair.    Bride and groom who believe the day is really all about them and act that way.
0ox8VKwKaa	I don't know but I would suggest researching other invitations from 15 years old
FB1zwZkMaa	Conclusion starts after the Data and Analysis.<br>  of course you know what data is, right? In the Analysis, you start connecting the data to your opinion(conclusion) but not making it sound too much of an opinion. Just connect the data to your point.<br>  Then when you are done, you conclude.<br>  I conclude.... blah blah blah...<br>  There.

qc2yP8Reaa	if he really trustes u like u say then u might be great friends, and he might stil like u more than a friend.|`|OHPXGahYaa	Well it means he trusts you. And you dont have to be a couple to trust eachother it just means your friends.|`|RmlJs18haa	That doesn't mean that your ex. can't trust you.<br>  maybe he understands u too well, or maybe he treats you as his sister/gd friend.|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	It means he thinks you're a good honest person who won't screw him over. It does look like he sees you as a good friend.
hVrfm4eIaa	I am so sorry that this happened to you.  I would have him stay some place else for a while.  Get support from family members and close friends.  Maybe go to couples counseling together.  After some time passes you may have a clearer picture of if he is truly repentant and how you want to proceed.  You don't have to make any long-term decisions right now.  Just make sure to take good care of yourself so that you can be there for your three little ones.    Please protect yourself by not having any unprotected intimacy with him until he has been tested for STDs (he'll need to wait at least 3 months before anything would show up).  He's gambled his health by sleeping with a random stranger, don't gamble yours.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Why did he do this?  Are things overall good between you?  If this is the only time in 9 years, I bet you have a good chance this won't happen again.|`|Xhaa1nVNaa	im sorry for this,,, but once u forgive them its easy for them to go do it again... its like giving him a free pass to go cheat again... if i were u id move on get a divorce... once a cheater always a cheater... good luck|`|tO7Rpjmqaa	kick him to the curb. dont never trust him again or he will just hurt you again.|`|78c5d650f87826bfbfea0158b5e3884faa	Wow, That is horrible. I would not know what to do too, if that was me. This is really hard, maybe you can try marriage counseling.  To be honest I really do not know what to say because I have not been in a situation like this yet, and until that happens then I would be able to give great advice.  I am so sorry that this happened and it scares me because it could happen to me and I am the type of person that do not forgive.  You screw up goodbye.. But at the same time if there is children involved it makes it so much more complicating.  Good Luck with your decision.|`|0qAmRjfOaa	People cheat because they are selfish, immature or have poor decision making skills.|`|fJZQ6gl4aa	Dont forgive him, but give him an only second chance.  And tell him that hell be on probation for the next months and any re-doings will be it. You are very right on feeling the way you do, as the truth is that he did cheat on you.  Dont ask for any details on the matter, leave it to his conscience if he has any.  And definitely separate from him if he should cheat again and file for a divorce.
RMo0L2bjaa	I dont know about 6 goes in the 9 hole, I only thought 69 meant like a girl sucks boy's **** and boy sucks girl's vagina, so that's 69. =/|`|741f42ff5ba975d170982f91a0e29e0eaa	Ok, imagine the 6 and the 9 are two people. What does it look like?
GWRP3vLQaa	I imagine you are both really wrung out right now. Many men who lose their jobs really feel like failures and strike out. He's treating you bad because he feels bad about himself, the marriage and everything! Can't you see that? It is wrong to take it out on you, but you don't seem to be cutting him any slack, either.    It would probably help you both to get some counseling. I know money is tight, but if you belong to a church, many ministers are pretty good at helping couples work things out, or at least learn how to fight fairly.     In the meantime, get a handle on the kids and try to calm down yourself so he doesn't have to come home to the chaos. Neither of you can  win if you both take adversary roles. Good luck.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	That's a decision that you have to make on your own if you should leave him or not.    You cant depend on others to tell you what you should or shouldn't do.    Do what you think is best for you and your kids.|`|DxohE884aa	Oh my goodness, he is out of line. I say ditch him and take the kids or hash out a deal - he has no right to keep them. I mean, I don't think. I mean, he lost his job first, so why is he behaving this way? He does not sound like a responsible father.  Sorry you have to go through this! Good luck!|`|sEFmjAJkaa	He feels like a Failure......    He feels you are a Failure.......    He feels that you both have failed.......and he is trying to put the blame on you,  do not accept that....    Stress can mess up a Marriage......    Marriage Vows........  ARE FOR BETTER of FOR WORSE.....  Are you a Strong Enough Women to Try To Stay & Work it out?     YOU CAN THANK bush, EX PRESIDENT FOR THIS MESS, YOU BOTH ARE IN......|`|IPb9zjL2aa	He feels like a failure as a provider.  I know it seems like its directed at you but im sure its something else.  Its alot to go though and he is looking for someone to blame. Be the bigger person and talk to him and tell you are thinking about divorcing him because of the things he is saying.  Tell him together that you guys can and will get though it.  and if he keeps blaming you then you have to do something cause he will start to believe it himself.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	Leave.  and take the kids.  what i don't get is that he won't let you take the kids, but he wants you to leave because he can't stand the kids' screaming.  when you take your kids, tell him that.|`|BqxYa9tEaa	Yes times are rough now, but give it time and it will be better.    He is just frustrated with everything going wrong.|`|GZCmyzBYaa	get a job, leave him and take your kids with you|`|nIG0j9wUaa	find you a good job get back on your feet show your husband that you don't need his negativity to bring you down even more then you gain custody of the kids and show him what a good person he wanted to leave...

If you are ready to end this charade, then see an attorney Monday for advice, and get things started before you do leave.  He can't keep you from taking the kids, just do it.  They are as much your kids as they are his, so both of you will have to fill for custody.  You will probably share custody but that is normal.  And BTW, kids aren't pawns to use against each other, they are sensitive people, and they know what is going on.|`|c07v7O80aa	He can't stand to look at you. He can't stand the kids. He wants you to leave.     Sounds like he's making it pretty clear. It's at times of stress that you find out who can stick. He can't stick. Look, call the local women's center and talk to them about it. They know a lot of resources. He doesn't get to say you can't take the kids. But remember that once you move out and leave the kids with him for a while, you won't get them back without a court order. Don't give away your plans. Make the plan. Carry it out.|`|AA11990465	What does he mean you're not "allowed" to take the kids? Screw him and his parents and take your kids and leave. I'm sure you have somewhere you can go to for awhile until you can figure things out and get a new job. In the meantime, you still have your unemployment and the kids have health insurance. Why do you need that jerk in your life? Divorce his dumb a** and do it soon.|`|by7H31Djaa	You know i see it like this. I think that he feels ashamed of himself because he can't provide for his family. It's not his fault that all of this is going on but he feels at fault. Seeing you and the kids reminds him of this everytime and he doesn't want to face reality. I don't think it could be that he just hates you now. Ask him.|`|yniedaZSaa	ditch him|`|fPxUdKZEaa	If he wants a divorce and is saying all of that $hit to you than Damn well leave his Rude Unappreciative ***!|`|rgqDS5VKaa	Some questions can only be answered by you, this is one of them.|`|1899lYjMaa	If you love him, stay. If the Love is not enough, leave. You are both under a lot of stress. Try to work together instead of against each other. Arguing all the time is not good for the kids, but overcoming this adversity and giving them two parents that love each other is the best thing for them.|`|pKgkIwSEaa	i think that he is very depress because in his mind he is telling himself that he lost, but in reality he don't, you and him could get together and talk that "you and him could get this done and could work just talk to him and discuss it.    another is that start again begin finding new jobs and the more important part is to talk to him ok i know what i am telling you ok.|`|6HgiNCmqaa	marriage is hard, take time and talk to him, or even try couples therapy, unless u  want it to get worse.    good luck|`|5OXtsCv1aa	I think he is just feeling insecure and frustrated because he has lost everything and can't provide for his family.|`|AA11231094	what you do is save every dollar you get from unemployment, and get on food stamps, and go to your families house until you can get back on your feet. He doesn't want to hear them screaming.. REMEMBER?  So take your babies with you, It will be hard, No one is saying it won't be. But you have got to stay strong. You pack a little at a time and bring it to where you will be staying. Do not let him know your doing this. Then when you have money in your pocket and most of yalls belongings out of his dads house you leave for ice cream, and do not come back!!!!!!! GL.|`|pvGwBH9Baa	Hmm, very sad [for all].     Opinion: Be the FIRST to file for a divorce - he will pay anyway.     On the form check BOTH boxes  - Yes.  - Yes.     * if you are clean/sober he CAN'T take /keep the kids to himself - court will not allow it.     He deserves it for be an idiot and saying things like that!|`|qljapIxBaa	You should poison/shoot him.|`|oztoPKrGaa	Do you want to work it out?  Do you think it is worth working out.?  Not for the kids sake, but for your sake?  If you want to work it out, either talk about it, or just leave for a while.  Go stay at your moms, or a friends. anything to be able to clear your mind and allow him to clear his mind.  It isnt right for him to be mean to you, even if it is due from stress.  He may just not be feeling that manly right now maybe you need to be the one to up his confidince.  That is your job.  Men really have to feel manly to be happy.  Dont put him down, he is just as stressed as you are.  Everyone thinks about leaving people every now and then.  But. No you shouldnt abandonin the children,.   But dont bring them into it.   I got brought into all kinds of fights and its really the hardest thing to do ...Your the mom, you have unemployment, so you probably have more of an income than him so you are automatically better off for the children.  Goodluck , and sorry this is happening.|`|T2PRG16taa	It will be tough to find the right answer here.    Take some time to try to remember why you love your husband.    Then when you have some quiet time alone with him, ask him what he remembers about why he married you.  What were the good times like?    Burdens can hide love, but it is always there.  Certainly you both love your kids.    Best to get some advice from some other adult that understands your situation.  Then try to sit down together to figure out what is going to work best for everyone during these difficult times.  Remember he feels pretty bad about himself and when he looks at you it probably makes him feel worse for having let you down.  You have to let him know that together you can make it through this.    Best wishes.|`|CZwJJetyaa	If your on the fence get counseling. Your the only one that can decide whats right for you. Maybe he's a jerk maybe he's acting this way because he's depressed. Either way going to a certified therapist will help you get the answer you seek, or perhaps fix your rocky marriage.   You can get free marriage counseling though some sort of religious or government organization.|`|ozcrnvFLaa	hello i feel for you dear there is a lot of ppl. having to lost there jobs dear so i say go and give it one more chance for the sake of love try to talk to him about how he is doing to you see i feel if you don't tell him it will be on your mind and that will stop you from growing and getting over him God will be with you i know i had some things happen to me in life some one was doing me and hurting my feeling and i did not say any thing to them i started drinking and drugging i am 42 yrs old i lost about 29 0r 26 yrs of my life be cuz i had not let some one know how i was feeling i had started hatting them God was not with me take cair|`|xzX3NSUjaa	Of course you should leave. Never stay with someone who doesn't want to be with you..or anywhere that you are not welcome. It will be hard at first but you will get through this.Many attorneys give free consultations. You should call for one and be advised of your rights. I'm pretty sure the mother of the children has the right to take the kids with her in this situation. Get a paper from the attorney with the laws and your rights on them.When you plan to leave with your kids and tell them you need an officer to make sure you can leave safely with your children. File for divorce and full custody ASAP.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Oh WOW!   If this is completely out of character for him, then I would say he is really not handling the circumstances life has thrown at his this time, and is taking it all out on you. He's obviously feeling like he cant provide for his family, extremely worried about lack of finances, finding another job, and now his marriage is falling apart, and he's living back home with his dad!  You of course are feeling your own feelings about the same problems,. You are both so caught up in your own worries that you arent listening to each other at the moment.  You both need space to think and plan where to go from here.     Talk to him and agree to separate for a while, you move out for a while, with the intention of reconciling. Leave the kids with your husband and his father for now, rather than unsettling them with another move and it will be easier for you to find a job. For your peace of mind, both of you sign a written agreement to that effect, and give copy to a solicitor, so everyone is aware that your intention is that this a temporary measure for financial reasons, and you are not abandoning the kids or giving up your right to custody.  Both of you work on the immediate and urgent problems of getting another job, becoming more financially secure, and once the pressure is relieved, then take a good look at your marriage, and you may find that once you are both feeling more secure individually, you can talk reasonably again and work out where to go from there.  Whether to reconcile as a family, in a new home, or end your marriage and start negotiating the divorce and custody and settlement issues.  Good luck.

I think it has to do with the fact that you're becoming more like the way her girlfriends treat her too, and that way apparently you fall into the best friend category. I have to add though, it also depends on the person you're with. Most girls however, tend to have their girlfriends to be chatty with.     Again, while some girls love security, some just really don't. However, being a bit unpredictable is always good. Not so much that it makes you uncormfortable, but bring sudden little presents, like a rose, or her favorite candy. Write a sweet note that makes her think.   You sound like a smart guy, maybe it'd be nice for you to spice up your relationships with the intelligence? Challenge each other by leaving sexy riddles under their pillow, or write what you're planning for her in a very sneaky way so that she still doesn't really know what to expect. Do give her the security to know what she has to wear though.    Fact stays, look for a girl that really fits with your personality. I think you like security, (me too), so make sure before you start anything too serious that you know what kind of girl you're dealing with.    Then again, I don't know the whole story, but I hope I helped a bit. ^^  Good luck and all the best to you!

Well yes good luck.|`|mgwiuZT0aa	My partner said it first. He claimed he fell in love with me on our first date which made it the second time we saw each other.

At that point I think we had been dating about 10 months.

And you don't want a girl who has so little thought for another person's feelings.  You didn't know her long enough to be planning marriage, so take a lesson and move a little slower the next time you fall in love, that way you can be more certain of your feelings.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	NEWS FLASH. . . you say she is leaving for no reason.

Just for a second. It will never make sense. Your heart will start trying again pretty soon, but stop for just a second. Stop hitting your head on that wall. We don't get over these things. They are always part of us. We just get to the next day. There will be that next day. Sometimes those days are worse than the one before. Sometimes they are better. You're mind will never, should never leave behind what was beautiful. Pick it up as a burden worth carrying. Leave behind the person. It's a lousy deal. I'm sorry. There is another time and place for this to happen. Read your question to someone in person. Get some healing from that real person too. We feel for you. Other people, people in person, will feel for you too. Good luck.|`|MsyTNZjqaa	Did you talk to her? Maybe her account had been hacked.
upqJU9yiaa	well yeah cause there are too many people in the world to just have one specific person with all the characteristics you admire.    Ive only been in love once in my lifetime but i still got time...lol|`|WoAAdxHEaa	I suppose. I feel that in a romantic way, you should devote all love to one girl, but as friends, there are many girls I love and care about very deeply.|`|Ip3mxDqdaa	Only if they're DTF and want to do it.. together.|`|fe6766b37b52b8ec8cb724b37eab9ff3aa	yes!!! I do..|`|cTWiFzJCaa	I dunno... I like 2 people alot and just posted a question about it.
aDL7xmt6aa	The worst?  She'll die, lonely and broke because her only relative in the world didn't care enough.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	this is sad, for she cannot help herself and has no choice if you do not help her. as also if you do not try and help her this guilt will be with you for life. for you know what will happen if she has no place to stay. and yes, she will have to go to the streets, where else can she go? as she may not live long on the streets. for it is cold as she may not even make it threw this cold weather, much less to find a warm place to get out of the ice and snow. check the weather where she should be and see how cold it is there.
xPfJG3FGaa	okay well this is normal in a relationship, break ups and make ups, if he really cares about you, he'll be back, u gotta try to stay cool until then, i know it's hard i've been there, but some of us are just more emotional than others, me being one of them! when me and my boyfriend broke up i took it really bad, i didn't eat a thing i couldn't sleep, it was terrible, but we got back together, and now sometimes i wonder if it was the right thing, because he hasn't changed at all, in fact it got worst, maybe because he knows whatever he does i will take him back, because i love him so much, and i can't picture my life without him, but i hate the life i have with him, i just keep thinking maybe i should finally call it quits, because i am so unhappy with him, but i can't picture myself with anybody else! i've been with him for 7 years and now i'm 8 months pregnant, it's too hard to just walk away, but i know deep down inside it would be the best thing for me to do, to start over and try to be happy again! But we have broken up so many times in our 7 year relationship, it's a shame, but we always got back together, so i'm sure u guys will too, but u gotta give it some time if he knows that u will take him right back, once u guys do get back together its gonna be the same, he will know he can do whatever he wants and u will be right there waiting for him to come back, just give it a day or two and see if he he calls u, if he even cares enough to just call and check and u! In the meantime it will be hard u have to keep yourself occupied, go look around the mall, get on the computer, go out to eat, chill with some friends, and when it's time to go to sleep, which isn't easy, u have to take some tylenol pm or some benadryl, to help u get to sleep, then when u wake up, get dressed and go do something don't sit around crying, it will make u call him, wait til he calls u, trust me he will, and if he doesn't which i doubt, then u will know that it is time to move on and find somebody that will care about you the way you care about them! And if that time comes, send me an e-mail and i will try to help u do that, but don't worry he will call, if u can hold out at least 2 days! just keep yourself occupied, and take something to help u sleep!|`|ArcYueAJaa	u should wait till tomorrow and let him sleep on it|`|AA10684960	sadly sounds uninterested,probably time to move on|`|FIALhwlKaa	I know you feel awful. Sit down and make a list. What do you love on him and what dont you like? What do you think would be in a couple of years, when you get married to him and might have children? What do you expect from your life?  This might sound stupid to you, but after the 2nd divorce I can tell you, better to loose him earlier, than having kids and getting ill. To me it sounds like his friends are right now more important to him than you are ( sorry for saying that ).   If you dont know what to do, call a friend of yours to talk. Cut your hair ( if you know how to do it ). Get a wonderful warm shower ( its relaxing ). Go for a walk with the dog - if you have one - otherwise borrow one of the neighbors and look what happens around you. Look at the sky and see how blue it is.|`|AA10960571	You should be proud of yourself for standing up for yourself and not allowing him to run you over.  Boys like it when they can do what they want and not do for their lady they way they should.  If he feels like he has done nothing wrong then you are right in not calling him or hanging around expecting him to know what he lost.  Move on and find someone who is going to take care of you and love you the way you want and need to be loved.|`|C568eIL7aa	wait a few days see if he is really in love with u, if so then he'll surely call u, if he doesn't call u then i guess its about time for u to move on and get over ur feelings for him.  i dont think u need to call him or apologize or anything else   Its all in ur hands if this answer doesn't help then just do what ur heart tell u to do......|`|H8tXHWRsaa	Try tomorrow to let him sleep on it.  Tell him how you feel know and that you are sorry.  Also calm down everything will be alright.        If that fails try again the nxt day

7CKipTZOaa	If there is really a lot of empty space left over so that it feels empty see if the venue has partitions you could use to make the space more intimate and more full, if not create a boundary with your decor whether by hanging tulle, you'll think of something though I'm sure|`|2daebb3597a4356f1b883fea4d41414eaa	You should have a small sweetheart table for you and your hubby, and room for the dj (if you have one) or band.  Also, there should be room to dance!|`|QQbbReRAaa	Get a band/DJ, and make a space for a dance floor|`|MZA7Q2vVaa	You could have a gift table. Then if you wanted to do something special you can make a digital photo images about you and your spouse and family for guest to look at and admire. I saw that at a wedding very nice. Also space for Dj and sweetheart table.|`|xukz46NFaa	Try arranging areas in each section of the room... Have a line of things ready on one side, like food and stuff.. On the other side put tables of guests.. In another area you can set up a dance floor area that will be accented by maybe decorative stuff on the floor or walls - decorations and accents can liven up any room.  I would put it all down on paper and use maybe graph paper, just like school days- u can plan out the whole thing on paper and see what works best... Just need the room dimentions...  :) Good luck|`|76nTvO4iaa	You don't say whether they're the long, rectangular banquet tables or round ones.  Please, please, please make sure there is plenty of room between the tables so people can get in and out of their chairs without bumping or squishing a person at another table.  You're looking a minimum of 6 feet between the tables for that.    Option 1 - Set up one end 1/2 to 2/3 of the room for the tables and the food and drink tables.  Decorate the other part with pedestals with plants, standing plants, etc. to be the dance floor.    Option 2 - You can set up the tables in a rectangle around the outside of the room and have the center of the room be left vacant for the dance floor.
ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	just nicely tell him that you are not and won't ever be interested because he is "simply not your type".|`|yTTXjQSmaa	Treat him like trash  Tell him to stop and that you're not interested  Have a guy go to talk to him  Have a guy beat him up
8oCwrIR2aa	I love it.    Your boyfriend could very well think you're nuts. Lots of guys flat-out get weirded out by it. Some figure too far, that a gal who likes being spanked likes other rough sex. Most don't, the want the sensual experience, not roughness, per se, though they usually like their men to be more "manly" (whatever it means to them) so that can be trouble.    If you want to do the spanking, it's, um, well, shall we say... less likely he'll consider that "normal" and be interested. But he could be.    Here's the thing: if you don't bring it up, he might never. Especially if he wants spanked. THAT's just not coming up any time soon, not 'til he's locked you up as a wife anyway.    I look at it this way: if you're already comfortable together, it won't hurt too much to bring it up. If you aren't at that stage yet, then it's not a huge loss if bringing it up causes him to jackrabbit. One caveat. If you ONLY want to go that far, make that clear because he'll definitely get the idea you want him taking charge and pushing the envelope. If you react badly to that pushing, he'll slam into a tougher shell than a turtle's and not come. If you do want to go further along those lines, explain your thoughts to him so he has some idea about leading onward or going hand-in-hand instead.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Spanking is another way for a women to show submission to a man.  SO YES its a major turn on.  When spanking enters your sexual relationship it should be done right.  (basics here) A spanking should start out light till the bottom is nice and red and warmed.  Then move up on the force put into the spanks.  Till the bottom is ripe and ready for the next step up paddles and belts all the way up to canes.   No thats the "bedroom" situation.    I give spanking to women and men as a hobby.  With my girlfriends if I am displeased with her behavior I give punishment spankings where I go right to whats needed.  Sever infractions can go right to the cane.  Small ones hard hand spanking.  It all depends on what "hold" he has on her in the relationship.  If she submits to my strong domination and is sexually attracted to my personality she accept her pain to know she is still my woman.|`|XZlFLecLaa	i LOVE when my boyfriend spanks me!!! its a turn on for him that i like that!|`|2c3e8d03104f93e5fc0db8e588652541aa	Try bringing it up as an "off remark" or a joke and test his reaction. Maybe he's wanting to try it or maybe he'll be weirded out. Mostly likely he is somewhere in between.     Rent a movie with a spanking scene and watch his reactions.   i.e. Blind Date, McClintock, Basic Instinct, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Americn Wedding, ect.|`|AA11243424	Giving or receiving?

RDsyZFsaaa	well it depends on how the guy looks. I personally love guys with long hair (long hair I mean by shoulder length, straightened like) I really don't like guys with buzz cuts, but yes chris brown looks good in one. It really just depends on how the guys looks.  Most importantly though, the inside is what matters. ;)

You lose it when you are ready. For me it's when I'm married.|`|4CkM4UZ5aa	1 quarter of people lose it before the legal age of 16.. roughly  there is no average though. it would be too varied to be accurate. but dont be in a rush to lose it.. i know people who have done that. im glad i waited until i found the right person before hand.

That's your personal business, i mean unless u were in some trouble with your body i think you can keep it to yourself.|`|9S9PqSvyaa	I would say "Sorry, but i made a terrible mistake....

Or do you want to go to planned parenthood and continue having sex and need birth control?    I don't understand.  It wasn't an issue before you had sex.  Why tell them now?  I wouldn't.  You said it will just piss them off and forget about going out anymore with out getting the 3rd degree.    If your parent's opinion and/or blessing was so important you should have talked to them before.  ???????|`|Y2Ag76kEaa	tell another family member and gauge they're reaction. if they take it hard... probably not a good idea to tell them right now.    afterwords (im assuming ur having protected sex, if not then i cant help you) sit your mom down,with your dad FAR away and tell her that you been having safe, and protected sex with your boy friend(or to-be boy friend). If they dont already know who your boy friend is, DONT tell them.    dad+shotgun+boy friend= crime scene    if you parents lose they're mind and go boy-friend hunting then just stay at a famly members house(or if your old enough you boy friends house) and crash there until the heat has died down.    I honestly wish you the best of luck, this is really the hardest things you can tell your parents(other than telling them your gay)|`|LNpsFt64aa	ok well darling there are a couple of things that you will have to consider....  1)even though your parents WILL and ARE going to get mad you made the choice and you will have to tell them  2)if your dad is going to get mad its better to tell your mom first but make sure that when she tells your dad that your there with her.  3)no matter how small you may feel when you try to tell them about it it's better just to get it over with

3kCmqrnzaa	Get a cloth & put a lot of force on where your leg is bleeding it will help  & if you have some type of wrap to put on it cover it up  You should also clean it since its an open wound  If its really deep you may need stitches  In order to calm him down you need to leave him alone & not talk to him just let him be & soon he will calm down|`|1rlFqcVbaa	Are you okay?   Just apply pressure to the wound to stop the bleeding. And disinfect it thoroughly with poroxide or soap and water.   And just stay out of the way from your dad..and if he looses his temper like this often try and talk to him. Or some body-it isnt good for you.|`|khDV9mdcaa	Hmmmmm;is this the frost time he has behaved like this if not seek help before something worse happens until then stay out of his way;and put presure on the gash and then wrap it ip to keep presure and when u remove the bandage clean it.|`|uQXPDfGUaa	OMG, sweetie are you ok...  First you need to pour like a whole bottle of proxide on it then dry it off with a clean towel and hold the pressure and when the bleeding slows down get a big band aid and put it on! or butterfly stiches|`|UaJHq2vsaa	uh, clean it. bandage it up. or like rap a cloth over the bandage pull it tight for the blood clots? and im not sure how to calm him down im sorry. i wish i could help?    maybe just stay out of his way or do something nice? im not sure    if your leg doesnt stop bleeding get help.
yIHlvPFfaa	yeah id say he likes you or thinks youre a really good friend  but next time you cant go to the store surprise him and send him a cute text thatll make him smile si he wont feel upset and when youre ready tell him you like him because i think youll get it in return that he likes you too
rR0rPVAEaa	Simply invite your old friends to places that have a special meaning to them, that make them happy. From there, act similar to them and be happy around them. If you do this, they will eventually turn around and be your friend again.|`|11VwVTYYaa	movies, dinner dates, shopping at the mall.

lJf6pSbaaa	maybe its the way you talk to her. or the wording of it? i used to demand things out of my mom, i was always edgy, and then i stopped b/c i realized i was being mean.     =]|`|2a81b75bc28e9ad9db8f1b3ebaedefc9aa	b/c all moms never want to hear what u say till its too late. my aunt is like my mom and she is a major wanna be ***** and she never listens  to me till i have done something she got mad and got on to me and took everything and everyone away from me. then i write her a letter and that always helps just ask her to reply in your letter to her.
UWfLT2iHaa	she should say yes lol|`|bPIR7WMQaa	She should say things like, "The type of relationships you want with me don't last forever, but friendships can."    Cause, it's damn true, and I won't lie. He's only 6 and it's better to tell him her true feelings. Knowing later hurts more, and a waste of time.|`|sLmX4H3Caa	How do you date a six year old? Well anyways, I think your right. She should tell him.|`|xSFjArmXaa	aww that soo cute   sorry that wasnt any help
aT5jaFX8aa	Ok this is the wrong time to be truthful even if it hurts kind of thing.    In the situation, he was just being rude. Maybe she did touch it, but saying that to her face is rude, and she wasn't asking for his opinion on what happened to the piece.     Example of the right time to tell the truth even if it hurts:    You and a friend are shopping (these are girls) Your best friend picks out a pink dress that she really likes. She likes it so much she does realize how ugly and awkward it looks on her. You don't want to hurt her feelings, but if she goes to the dance in that she will be made fun of. You have to tell her the truth when she asks you what you think, especially because you don't want people at the dance to make fun of her.|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	Nooo. Well, I always try to be nice.|`|aa013e9a2443a8c713e9debdef2ba157aa	It was wrong to be rude to your aunt
VjmTK6uZaa	Erm, I know you said not to do this.  But you need to just set him straight.  Put the fear of God into him.  I had the same problem with guys trying to hit on my girlfriend, until I set them straight.  But that mainly happened because im a fairly big guy.  Most guys don't want to mess with me.  Your going to have to talk to him and tell him to screw off basically or he's going to be meeting your fist.  The main reason you must do this is because if you come off as a wimpy guy, he wont take you seriosly.  You need to come off as the strong guy and telling him to screw off basically.  Might not want to tell your girlfriend.  But its going to be the best thing to do.|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	Go to the police. If you threaten him, he could go to the police and you'll be the ones in trouble.    Don't let it get any worse then it is, keep your girlfriend safe.|`|CBdKPtUYaa	I would give him a warning, tell him to back of a little. If he doesn't stop go to the police. Just don't hit him or anything or you'll get it trouble.
5tWfObAXaa	Keep it keep it keep it.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	Do you feel like you deserve to be paid for the decision you made to "give him what he wanted?"  Keeping the video camera is like taking money from him for the service you provided.    You need to understand that this is part of decision making.  He asked, you provided.  You said yes.  He owes you nothing.  Give back the camera and be grateful for the lesson that you learned and don't let it happen again.    I don't think you would enjoy having the camera in your possession.  You are hurt and probably embarrassed over the situation.  No amount of possessions is going to change that feeling.  You will feel better about your moral choices if you give the camera back.|`|iJrCZxy8aa	give it back to him. That *** hole is gonna bug you about it forever.|`|irS70aE7aa	Dont give it back never just get rid of it or sell it he deserves it|`|8042dac00a4e81239a58052d23cbb99baa	You're hurt by his lies and deceit, but don't let that drag you down to his level.  Keeping his equipment will not change what happened, it's dishonesty on your part, and will also lessen your morals.  Honesty is the only policy and that never changes.      The sooner you get rid of his camera and all things concerning him, the sooner you'll start feeling better.  Another thing about keeping the camera, it's like you're appeasing yourself for taking up with this bum and him walking out of your life, and that's not good.  If you react negatively this time, it will be easier to react negatively the next time something bad happens to you, and each time you'll add on more and more, and you'll eventually find yourself some place where you don't want to be.    This man may not remember where he left his camera, but things have a way of making itself known.  Eventually, he'll find out where his camera is and want it back.  If you don't return it, he can sue you in small claims court.  If the camera is damaged while in your possession, he can sue you in small claims court.  The camera is expensive, so why take the risk of spending several hundred dollars just because you're hurt now.  The best revenge is moving on.|`|LC3TGSr3aa	Well there's a few things you could do.     You could make some sort of F*ck you video and give it back.     Me personally I might have thrown it out the window.     You could get a few of your friends and make a video of the way your relationship went and point out everything he did wrong and the things you didn't like about him.     Or simply you could give it back :D
MsyTNZjqaa	He's a timewaster and enjoys you chasing him around... he probably has a few other girls chasing him as well and just enjoys the attention.    He's not worth your time, if he was interested he wouldn't cancel on you.. find someone who's worth your time.|`|wnr9S9kuaa	It sounds like he's too busy admiring himself to admire you.  He sounds rather selfish, unless he's trying to impress you with his body.  But you don't want to go for a boy by there body first.  You want to check out their personality.
iRdKOCVpaa	well it is very possible and it can ruin the whole kissing experience if your quote on quote "bad". BUT, as long as you don't shove your tongue down the other persons throat then you should be in the clear lol. ill give you a few tips<br>  1.first let them know that they're your first embarrasing yes but i mean it'll make him feel good trust me lol.<br>  2.just start off with a regular peck<br>  3.linger around after the peck and gently rub your tongue up there upper lip, just like a flick of your tongue on there lip don't run it across it lol.<br>  4.take another peck and this time do the tongue trick while your doing it.<br>  5. your in the clear now to insert the tongue lol this sounds so provocative xD.<br>  6.best answer?|`|cLRKfzBmaa	ya|`|YE0baNYRaa	yes|`|TIVrZ2I8aa	Yes, it IS possible to be a bad kisser.<br>  <br>  Let the person know you will be kissing for the first time.  They will probably be flattered that they are your first.  After the initial contact, you will relax and "go with the flow".  Follow the other persons lead.|`|zka26204aa	Yes, practice on the back of your fist or kissing a mirror, and watch movies for technique.|`|FzFSzilmaa	there are plenty of people who are LOUSY as kissing... i should know, i've kissed them!!!|`|OAYaeW22aa	yes you might suck|`|IScK0gc3aa	trust all of us...its compleetly possible and you've never made out before it more than likely that your first kiss will not be vry good... now if your gonna do i recomend that you should use ur your toungue yet...inexperienced kissed make feel like your making out with a hose or something when they use tounge on first ever kiss... i recomend practice with your hand or something...yes its embarasing, but hey, whose gonna know? but second, dont worry even if you suck, because youll only gonna get better at it,twice i had gf that had naver kissed anyone before and though they werent good at first it was fun to guide them into it...|`|KDjU5MOiaa	yes it is though i never experienced kissing someone on the lips. there are actresses who are bad kissers. they try to open their mouth while the kiss is not yet done i.e., the trying-hard type|`|T26GPPYmaa	ouch!!! yes there is.

8cuPVvYnaa	Having those feelings are normal. Part of you has embraced your wonderful but "mature" life. But part of you still feels like you're 19 yrs old. You know you would never want to go back or lose what you have, but that doesn't change how you feel sometimes. So admit it and then look again at your beautiful wife and kids and thank God for what you have. Just don't let your feelings rule you. We all feel at times that life is too much. But then we end up making it, don't we?|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	Isaac, as a single guy in his early 30's, I feel like life is passing me by as well.  I would really like to find The One and I am sorely missing her in my life.  I want kids too.  I know it's all a huge responsibility but that's what comes with the territory and clearly (to me) it's worth it.    In other words I think you are the one who is actually living his life ... even though it's tough sometimes.  Props to you, and good luck.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	You might not be having a mid life crisis.  You have just gotten to a point where you did not think you would be at such an early age.  You are 28 with four kids.  It can be hard to understand how things moved so fast for you.  You see your friends who are the same age as you and they do not have as much responsibility and it reminds you of when you were in the same boat they are in.  It makes you miss the life you had.  Then there are times when you love where your life is and all the people and things that are in it.  Maybe you just need to feel single again.  Try having a date night with your wife.  Ask her out, get a babysitter.  Do the things you did before you got married and had kids.  Even after she has the twins continue to have date night.  Pretend the two of you are not parents and are dating for one night out of the week.  It will make you envy your friends a lot less.|`|veZLfnGFaa	You aren't even old enough to be going through mid life crisis.  Lol.. Your problem is just as you said.  Everything moved so fast.  You just have to have time to let your mind catch up with all the responsibilities you have on you.  You'll be fine.  Just be thankfull you can consider yourself a lucky man.  :)|`|XawBWMQraa	its normal, happens to all of us all the time. sometimes the things in life we go thru can seem overwheling because its happening to us all at once or it seems like its happening fast compared to other people in our age group. i say just live in the moment and enjoy what you have. Make the best out of it    when it feels like too much, calm down, think it thru and get support from family and friends. your friends will one day be where u are too. don't judge your situation based on theirs because we all have different roles in life to play.   remember things are usally not what they appear to be when you are looking at other people or friends from the outside.|`|ARCURrPhaa	Its totally natural to feel like that..  You have a lot of responsibility, that is for sure... but there is nothing you can do about that now. Try not to think of your youth or even your life as being over. Life is what you make it and you can still be happy and feel youthful.  Life hasnt' passed you by just yet, and it won't as long as approach it the right way. 4 kids at your age IS pretty crazy though, I agree!. What were you thinking?!?! lol.|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	ahhh, you left out the crisis part.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Sounds like you just need time to get used to the change.|`|LUhh9bSWaa	See I remember you posting something months ago about how marriage is so great.    Not so great anymore?    Here's the thing.....once you married, you pretty much load up your plate with tons of responsibility and no fun....well maybe family fun at the chuck e cheese...that kind of mindless fun ...blah.    It gets old quick.    I hear ya about that midlife crisis being brough on quicker by marriage.|`|gUPUSTEuaa	I think you have the right to freak out ones in a while I am sure is a lot of stress been married having 4 kids and having so much responsibility at a Point you wish your life was different, but I think that you should sit down and tell your wife you never know she made be going threw the same thing, holding back stuff don't help if you feel like you can't tell your wife you should have somebody to talk to.|`|AA11122479	trust me this is completely normal and its ok to feel this way. it doesn't really matter what age you start having kids everyone who has ever had a child has had this thought cross their mind. and if you think things are crazy now just wait until the twins are born. just keep in mind the good times. no matter how crazy and hectic things get make time for you and mom to have down time. together and alone. but sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and good intentions so you will do just fine. start planning your retirement now. as crazy as it seems but im a single mom of three and planning what i will do in once im not working full time and the kids are grown helps me get through it when things get tough!|`|ksqPjgEUaa	You're really cute. Nice smile btw...     Are you kidding! You've got a lot on your plate. It's ok to be scared once in a while - you're human.  If you weren't scared it would mean you don't care.     Just wake up every morning & realize how blessed you are. Your friends are still figuring themselves out. You've found the key - your wife. She's amazing & you & she will have a beautiful life together. Just keep your head on strait... you'll be fine. Life's not passing you by - it's just beginning to make sense. Your path is to be a good father & husband now. There's nothing you're missing. You have it. - Love of a good woman, a good life, children & more on the way...Be grateful it's with someone you love & respect. Be grateful they are healthy. ~ Take a time out for yourself once in a while... a beer with the guys, a game, a little trip.   Keep inner peace & make sure temptation isn't an issue.|`|wnb0EgaHaa	Wow...you've done a lot in three short years!  I'm sure there have to times when things are overwhelming for both of you.    You are young, but clearly you love your wife and family.  I'm sure it can get distracting that many of your friends are still single and dating and just planning marriages. Same way it can be so rewarding to watch the woman you love and the kids you share sleeping so peacefully.    Advice:    Make sure you set aside "date nights" or weekend time, or something of the sort.  You guys are young and have so much still to learn about yourselves and each other.  That can very easily get lost amongst the pampers and pacifiers and pooh bears, and you owe it to each other and your children to protect, cherish, and build that bond.      Make sure you continue to treat her as your girlfriend and your wife- tell her the things you told her when you met and married, bring her flowers, cook her a surprise candlelight dinner (or bring home take out and then serve it by candlelight.)  It is so easy to fall into viewing her as "mother" that those important things can get neglected.  Make sure that you continue to treat her as sexy and hot, lol, especially because she's the mother of your little ones.    Try to set aside a few minutes daily to talk - difficult with small kids, but establishing a set nightly routine and bedtime for the little ones will really help with that.  You need grown up time to talk about things that don't involve potty training and teething.    Cherish family time - spend time planning activities that all of you can share and enjoy, and try to build in some traditions that you will all come to treasure and look forward to.  They can be silly or fun or sentimental- the important thing is time together, a common goal, and creating memories.    I would also recommend that you try to carve out some alone time for each of you based on your personal needs - that'll be tough, but getting it can make a world of difference in each of you feeling important as individuals since you are immersed in the family unit now.    And, for what it's worth, it's likely better for you to invite single friends in for a pot luck or or movie night, or go out with them as a couple on dates occasionally.  You will both know the single friends that are still healthy for you to have as friends, versus the ones who might be bad influences by bad-mouthing your responsibilities and lack of freedom and spontaneity, lol-despite popular opinion, those do exist, and you'll be doing your marriage a favor if you both acknowledge and deal with it head on.     Final thought - sure you guys are young now, but that means your kids will be all grown up while you guys are still young enough to enjoy each other's company!  Plus, you have lots of energy to hang with your kids.    Best luck to you and congrats on your coming twins as well as your other little ones.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Well if you look at it that way, then yes, you are missing out on everything that you don't have.   But I bet people took a look at your life, your amazing wife and your wonderful children and wish they had what you have.  Life and marriage is what you make it. Don't wish for the things that you don't have because you will be missing out on what you do have.  Embrace what you have and love it like you have never loved it before. Happiness comes from within. A great marriage is very hard to come by these days and I think that you do have exactly what you want and need.  Responsibility? Nah. Only when you decide to make it that way.    Its a lot too late to just go get what you think you are missing out on. The grass is not greener.|`|jTsQkuhHaa	you always want what you don't have.  maybe you are looking back and realizing the stress free carefree days you had but everyone "grows up", gets married and has kids, so keep your focus on what a great family you have, make friends that are married and have children so you're not left "aching" for the old "glory" days.  It was fun while it lasted but now you have new experiences and memories to make!  Enjoy it! You chose it for a good reason! There are ups and downs no matter what stage of life you are in.  Gotta take the good with the bad.|`|ROZQMRzxaa	You've got a long time before you go through midlife crisis! You're blessed to have a wonderful wife and children. Sometimes we get overwhelmed in life with things but that's life. Make the best of it.|`|5FH5EibEaa	You should be lucky to have a wonderful family... it is normal to feel that way sometimes...it is human nature|`|hjt0H2MQaa	I think we have all been there at some point.  Look at it this way:  Your friends are still beginning the marriage era - where you essentially will be back out partying when they are up doing 2am feedings!  I wish I didnt wait so long having kids -- (I have a 1 and 3 yr olds) and the people who live directly behind me are the same age and their kids are 15 and 19!  They go out all the time, and Im still doing the "baby thing".  Count your blessings - just think of all the joy your kids bring ---- also, isnt the grass always greener?  Believe me, YOU have the better life.  No one wants to be alone, and you landed a great girl!  Be happy and enjoy YOUR life - dont worry about other people.  PS Congrats on the twins!|`|7njY4nEeaa	I think life moves faster than our own consciousness.  I turn 40 this year and I can believe that Im old enough to understand what a decade means!  In our western culture there are no rites of passage or anything to mark our movement into adulthood and I think that as a result we end up adults, with adult lives, adult bills and responsibility and somehow don't feel like adults.  Four kids in a few years is a lot.  That's a wondrous gift...and a large duty.  No wonder you waffle between overwhelmed and over joyed!    I say, talk to your wife as much as you can!  She is going thru the same process in a different way so lean on each other.  Support each other and rely on the wealth of love in your home to help you find the balance when the top of the world seems a long ways away.|`|1978e46edc09459d102fc12e39033842aa	Having a husband or wife and kids are a big responsibility.  Some parts of my life were definitely easier when I was single.  Same for my husband.  We can't just pick up and move or change jobs if things are tough.  I'll bet your wife also has these feelings too about all that is on her.    Please remember, though, being single is not all a party.  It can be lonely and depressing and sometimes it is such a hassle to spend yet another holiday dinner at a co-workers house.  For me, the economic meltdown has me at times longing for the days when I was single, living in a cheaper city, with a managable mortgage payment and a boss who I respected.  On the other hand, when I reach out and touch my husbands back at night, I am so glad that we are doing this bumpy ride together.  I think you are scared and doubting your ability to keep things together when things seem so out of control around ALL OF US.  Please share your concerns with your wife.  She loves you and I know she wants for you to confide in her.  I know she probably has similar worries.  You'll both be able to do this if you acknowledge to each other how overwhelming all of this is.  Good luck.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	r u sure those r your kids?|`|UV27AyIPaa	I feel like you are the same guy who would be belly-aching if he was a single 28 year old. Be thankful for what you have.|`|982b63b7af7d35aa88514fbe563f2b78aa	You are also going through a transition phase and eventually it will pass.  Happens to us all but eventually you will grown and adjust. As for missing out I think we has humans will always feel we are missing something but you have to live in the present moment and appreciate what you have and not what you don't have.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	It sounds like the drastic change (2 not just one more babies on the way) combined with looking around at the contrast of your friends' lives (they're just now getting married, or they're single) is like dropping you in cold water, totally jolted to shock.    Take one day at a time. You will adapt to this. Perhaps you had similar feelings when your very first child was born. You thought oh crap, how will I know how to be a dad? Will I know what to do? Will my wife ever want sex again?    But you got through that, didn't you? Just like you'll get through this.     I think sometimes we magnify our problems by thinking about them too much! Some of us who like to think often create problems by thinking too much about the change around us!  Just take it little by little & remember that comparing yourself to others is not wise!|`|ixRkfLjIaa	Having twins during a recession would give anyone a crisis.    But seriously, most men do settle for a wife long before they hit their peak.  Women call it a crisis, but it's more like an awakening.  The guy wakes up and realizes how great his life could have been if he wasn't tied down with a wife and kids.    Yes, we all love our kids, blah, blah, blah, but kids are an expense, and if you sat and thought about how that money could have been otherwise put to good use, then yes, that'd give anyone a crisis at any age.      Plus, be honest, did you used to sit around with your guy friends and talk about baby names?  I didn't think so, guys dream about fast cars and hot women.|`|pVrKaZOmaa	First off -- congratulations i just want to say that maybe you should take some time off away from your family and go travel some quiet place before the twins arrive, or take a trip with just you and your wife, take some individual time with your kids before the family grows again. however whatever you do decide to do make memorable and meaningful. i think you may be feeling the angst because everything id moving really fast for you slow down and take a picture or take up a hobby of some sort. Hope I Helped!|`|ZtfN4J6taa	You got married too young and now you are feeling the weight of all the responsibilities. You are probably feeling you have missed out on a lot of things. Playing around with other women, partying with your friends. Having a wife and four kids at 28 is a big weight on your shoulders. Hope you are not planning on more kids after the twins !
b1NMh5K2aa	Your right he shouldn't be keeping any memories of his ex. He must still have some feelings for her as he doesn't want to let go. I would be so annoyed. She might be the first person he ever loved but if he loves you now then he doesn't need all the stuff from his past....Tell him how you feel. Good luck!!|`|YE0baNYRaa	he is definately freaking you out. it shows how much he loves and is emotionally attatched to his ex. he has not still moved on in life even though he claims to have. dump him.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	When you say Teddies do you mean as in lingerie?  or Teddie bears?<br>  If it is the lingerie I would think that was weird and he should throw them out, if it is stuffed animals that is okay.<br>  <br>  He may want to take a box and put all those things in it and store them away, there is nothing wrong with that.  I wouldn't think he would leave this stuff lying around.<br>  <br>  He is a sentimental person and that is endearing.  Let him have his memories.|`|XJ0Nux6Naa	How Could You Say That?<br>  <br>  She Almost Died, And Shes Still His Friend, And You Say Its Just Crap? Thats A Bit Selfish. It Is Memories, Ive Had Two People Close To Me Die, And Ive Kept Everything They Sent Me, Wrote Me, Or Any Of The Things They Touched. Its Value, Its Loss, Its Comfort, Be There For Him. It Was A Hard Time For Him And His Ex. It Doesnt Mean He Still Loves Her, Its Values From The Past.|`|lT6WBaWIaa	thats his way of showing you he loves you: he's keeping his ex a friend, but not trying to keep her a secret.|`|RLoilwCNaa	He's going to leave you. What a jerk.|`|JuGH3Rowaa	he might have said its the first person that he ever loved but you have to look at what he said....."its over now and he loves you" if he said that you need to belive that or your relationship will not work....trust me...and i would keep crap like that if one of my ex's almost died and still sent me that its prolly just more sentimental|`|KaDxFT2Haa	therres nothing to feel bad bout it..dere r some ppl whom u can nva chuck off frm ur life...so may b evn he cant..it doesnt mean dat he doesnt love you or he still loves her...al it means datt he still considers her a friend.dats all...he loves you n only you..so dont get paranoid for he is all urss.
dHDe64FUaa	Well your boyfriend sounds perfect for you, whets the problem your not dating him? I think it is hard to find perfect men so keep him.|`|HNAVlwV7aa	fight for him. don't give up. show him that u love him and don't let go until he makes it clear that he doesn't want to be with u again. hope u win.|`|HEDKbHKlaa	It's what you want, no-one elses choice, from my point of view, I'd get rid of him, hook up with me ;)
2Om1LosMaa	I'm sorry your teacher left. You probably can't get her back at school but maybe you could call her or send an e-mail so you can remain close. Tell her the difference she made in your life, that would make her feel good. People will come and go in your life and it always hurts. Too bad we don't have more teachers like this one. If you don't get to be close, don't be sad, be happy for the time you had and what she has done for you. Good luck.
gRXy66dOaa	well come up with something<br>  if you say that he is slow then ask him in some way so that you can go out with his cousin<br>  <br>  idk yet what you can do<br>  <br>  email me.. and i will get back at u later
8C1a8uhpaa	ummm, maybe just cool off for awhile, don't cut off contact completely, but sometimes be unavailable (more than usual). Just make him miss you a little. It seems like he might be waiting for the right moment. My sister dated her bf for 5 years (at least) and she went to cali for work for a week and when she came back, he popped the question! I was so happy for her! Don't let him know you are doing it though, he will feel manipulated...but isn't that what we women are good at? Subtle manipulation, so everyone wins in the end? We ARE the best natural psychologists in the world :D Also maybe he is trying to save for a ring and a house and to pay for the wedding. All of those things are really expensive.|`|12ORrojXaa	i dated my husband for 5 years before he proposed.  i remember feeling the same way.  i was 26 when we got married and, believe me, i was ready LONG before then.  he actually bought and picked out the ring himself in august 2006 and didn't propose until october 1, 2006.  we were married june 9, 2007.....his reason was he wanted both of us to be out of school (i ended up going to grad school) and he wanted to have a good and steady job.....he landed a job with exxon as a production technician.  it was well worth the wait!  remember, it is very important for BOTH of you to be ready...you don't want to rush him and then have him resent you!  but, you also need to do what's right for you!|`|71qGan9Raa	He doesn't want to get married. He's just telling you that so you don't leave. How long are you willing to be unmarried to him??? Legally, you are married but i know you'd like that ring.  Good luck honey! If he hasn't proposed to you yet, you'd better put the pressure on or he's not going to do it willingly.|`|9dL6NCoiaa	hi|`|kBW9ihIlaa	Well, I think he is just waiting for the right time and when he feels ready. If you don't wanna lose him and you really love and care about him you'll just have to wait. I know it sucks really bad, but don't worry it'll all be worth it in the end!|`|q3iRTCVsaa	Well I was in the same boat your in.  Except my boyfriend starting talking about getting Engaged when we were at our 4 year mark.  Every once in a while he's bring it up.  Fast forward 4 years and still nothing had happened.  Drove me nuts and I would ask him what the Heck happened.  We would end up fighting.  SO not fun.  But this year on Christmas Eve he asked me to Marry him. Best night of my life best day of my life. Now I feel bad for bothering him and fighting with him about it.  You should ask him where he stands and tell him to be honest. If he is serious about asking you one day just try to be patient. I know how hard it is.  I know it sucks.  But I really believe he waited this long because he's ready now to be Married and handle everything that comes with it.  If you don't think you can wait or he doesn't give you the answer your looking for you might want to plan your next move.  Just think 8 years is a really long time. But I wouldn't of had it any other way.|`|SYuukcxgaa	If you love each other time doesn't matter. It took my husband 9 years to propose. We had talked previously about getting married and I knew he was going to ask it was just a matter of when he felt ready to take that step. Just be patient.    Good Luck and I hope this helps :)|`|CaPZrWVWaa	Let him know he has to **** or get off the pot. My mom did that and they have been happily married for 26 years.|`|BUCvr0R8aa	Here's the plan keep holding on to your boyfriend and in the mean time be looking for someone else.  There's always someone else out there.|`|AtJgXB59aa	i think he is waiting untill he feels comfortable and wen you least expect it
c2YcBbXyaa	they're never as good in person..........end it now|`|zRmwEFAwaa	I think you should just stop talking to him altogether. Just stop. I am worried for you, and I don't even know you. He seems really infatuated by you, but you are in a relationship at the moment, so again, I suggest, stop all contact with this man, and stay that way. If you let it keep going, it could lead to worse. The man could be obsessed with you even. Just stop all contact with him, and don't think about going to contact him again after.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Stop talking to him. The real problem is that you don't want to because it fresh and exciting which is a change from your current situation. Good luck losing everything for some guy that just wants you for a side item.|`|aUbxn1eYaa	That's Happened To Me Before..The Thing That Helped Me Get Over Him Was Just Going Out WIth My Friends And Enjoying Life With People I've Actually Met..So If You Have No Desire To Meet Him, Then it's Fine And Just A Friend Online...Just Don't Make Your Self Obsessed ABout Him If Nothings Ever Gonna Happen.<br>  <br>  Hope It Helps In Anyway..|`|FzFSzilmaa	when personalities meet, that is a stronger connection than visual...<br>  <br>  he wants you to get naked on the webcam - though i bet you've already done that with him... ;)|`|iBH7NTl3aa	Most of the people in cyber space are living a cyber life lol x
OfRy572faa	Someone who can be with me for the rest of my life. (:
rEtpj95iaa	try being me I'm 5'7 and my lil sis is 6'3|`|rh12tX8Naa	How old is your sister? Women typically stop growing around ages 18-21.|`|EXxtV5VUaa	To answer your question, you can't predict puberty. Also, alleles are not based on gender. In addition, you can't prepare your sister's height based on your aunt's height because your sister is not directly linked to your sister's genetically.  So, it's unpredictable. Your sister could stop growing, or she could keep growing 'til she's eight feet tall! (I kid, unless your family is home to the eight-foot-tall man.)  And hey man. Why is this in singles and dating?|`|MIR3eC5kaa	if your parents are tall then she will get as tall as them|`|AA10934463	if you have a big family thats tall your bound to be tall aswell and same goes for your sis , its in the jeans :D|`|WCAhhAFiaa	well how old is she?! i stopped growing this year.. im in 11th grade- 16 years old and i'm six foot... and are your parents tall? she probably will be tall but she probably is done growing a lot.. maybe a couple more inches but not giant tall..
XExUVo0Uaa	You have to respect your parents, even if you dont agree with them. Who you date is really not their concern when youre over 18 but if you are still a kid then I would be very carefull with who you bring to the house. Try not to make waves until you are out of the house.
uoEfoI7aaa	Here is a radical way to do it...<br>  Go up to her, hold her hands, look into her eyes...and say, "I LOVE YOU".<br>  Radical I know...but it works.|`|Xl1k5dMiaa	Give her....Flowers, hugs, kisses, pictures, jewelry, compliments...etc.  Your 14, write her love letters, poems, make a youtube video of how much you love her.....Use slang words or make up new words that yall only understand like code words that mean I love you, or give each other nicknames.
otTMXJvRaa	Sounds extremely dangerous.  Don't do it.  <br>  <br>  Have him visit you instead with his parents, and they stay at a hotel (not your house).<br>  <br>   - Charlie|`|ieS2q7Gcaa	have you met him??? in person i mean not thru the internet. he probably want to use you as a sex slave or sell you for money. havent you seen movies like that??? watch the movie TAKEN|`|W41F7EFfaa	wow, that sounds kind of freaky. with sex slavery going on, i wouldnt feel all trusting. if you do decide to visit him, put up your guards. have a plan B. he can pay for your airplane ticket but i wouldnt stay over at his place. i would stay at a hotel instead. his parents could even be fake. just be really careful, i'd hate for you to end up becoming a victim of somekind.|`|kEy3W5ydaa	R U NUTS?  Want to get sold into slavery...sex trade? HECK NO you are moving way too fast...
eU2Hg0Deaa	A man will not be able to tell if you have had sex before.|`|htWw0OlCaa	LOL.... Where do people get this stuff?....|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	no it is not possible to tell if you are a virgin or not during sex, sometimes the first time causes bleeding as the hymen breaks but this does not happen in all cases, sometimes the hymen breaks naturally - mine did through gymnastics|`|v1uNUcwCaa	only if you catch a STD and give it to him or something like that.<br>  a year ago is along time.<br>  how do you know he is being faithful as your obviously not?|`|FzFSzilmaa	no man really cares whether a woman has had sex with other men or not - except the weird and weirdly religious ones...|`|iBH7NTl3aa	Only if you tell him lol|`|7twWHSJYaa	no he won't|`|DTZmqnCkaa	Yes, of course it is.  He will also know when and where and how many times and certainly what positions you enjoyed with your other partner.|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	nah he wont know! you are harsh cheating on him though, shame on you!
Sc6oGITNaa	Well, if you and your ex. boyfriend still like each other and you know that it can work again give it another go.     Let the other guys down easily and tell them how cool they are and how any other girl will be extremely lucky to date them.    Be firm without being harsh!    :)|`|nF2ylZwcaa	well, the only way to not hurt any of them is to not date any of them  and since you already tried it out with the guy you liked in return, i think you shouldn't date any of them  maybe you should spread the word to all three of them that you like someone else  unless you plan on getting back with your 6 month man :P  truth be told, it's hard at times like these not to hurt any of them  or you could hook all of them up with someone that likes them! =D
wl85WhsTaa	It might get the hint across but it doesn't matter if shes not ready or willing, she might be waiting for marriage.|`|YIlP4yNaaa	Probably not.|`|1rlFqcVbaa	Um. NO. If you really like her you can just let her be. jerk|`|3MNVStEmaa	im guessing alot of irls here will sa sumthing mea to u cuz ur basically pushing a girl to give up her virginity to get laid....    just saying|`|XXZFf1AYaa	No, I don't think so. Think about it, why would she give up her virginity because of the opportunity to put on some sexy underwear, that doesn't even make sense.|`|AA11615514	I think she'll get the hint you want in her pants, but I don't think it will change her mind about "putting out." Your choice of the term "putting out" gives the impression that you consider getting her in bed as either your right or some sort of conquest. Neither of those ideas is likely to endear you to any woman. Grow up and enjoy this girl's company for what it is or go find a girl with lower standards.
f2R0QzUyaa	So what if he's trying to impress you? It just means he really likes u?
3924c6cb1a9c58e6092df7c8166eddceaa	He may like you.  It's quite possible.  If I were you, I would ask more about their relationship.  Find out how long they have been together, if it is serious.  Drop some hints.  See how he responds.  It's ok to still flirt!|`|GHd84xipaa	well you know he has a gf.you can ask him if he would like to hang out?if he sez no,then you got your answer.if he sez yes then maybe you can ask him how serious he is with his gf.i hope he will be honest with you and not lead you on.tell him you want to be friends,but don't want to come between him and his gf.|`|asxqampCaa	If by "friends" you mean "some ditzy girl he bangs on the side and doesn't tell his girlfriend about" then --- YES!!!!|`|AA10721433	just start talking to him and see how far things will get .
8xMlAzTJaa	dang! i have the same thing going on here. but im a girl. he is a boy. im so nervous. do i said hi and shake his hand or do i like hug him..! haha once u figure it out let me know.. hmk thank u :)
IPb9zjL2aa	LOL serves you right!!!!!  Personaly if i really likes a women and she dated me and then told me she has a live in BF i would run the other direction..  This speaks tons about your character.  And saying that you really like him and would dump your BF is like the nail in the coffen.   He will not trust you from day one.  If you want to date other people then go ahead and break up with your current BF>|`|yGwda7wPaa	Why do you feel like you have to have a man in your life?  If you are not happy with your boyfriend, then get out of the relationship.  It seems to me that you are only willing to leave your boyfriend if someone better comes a long.  But, how can someone come along if you are in a relationship?  You need to get rid of the boyfriend, and then get yourself together.  Then, you can be free to be honest and open in a relationship with someone else.  You don't need a boyfriend.  Who cares if this guy doesn't want to know you.  You need to love yourself first, and then you can love someone else.|`|c07v7O80aa	Grow UP, for God's sake. You either want to stay with current BF or not. Figure out which one and do that. Only then do you have any business with someone else. I don't blame him not wanting any part of that triangle, him, a girl who can't make up her mind, and a potentially violent boyfriend.. It also tells him that you might just "grow apart" from him one day but that you wouldn't tell him. It's not that you don't have the heart. You don't have the soul. Work on it.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	This new guy is a very smart man.  He is guarding his heart against a woman who blatantly lied to him from the very beginning.  And to add insult to injury, you revealed that you had a boyfriend who subsequently abused the poor fella over the phone.  Can you blame him for never asking you out again?  If I were him I'd hide at lunch time too.    Don't look for another relationship while you are still in one. You will draw the wrong people toward you and scare the right men away.  Not only that, many people will get hurt (yourself included).    Let go of this guy - he's already gone, and don't get involved with someone else until you are completely free of your current boyfriend.|`|9JFnkCMfaa	YOU REALLY MESSED UP. When u 1st showed interest in someone else, u shoulda broke up with ur BF and THEN began dating again. There are more guys out there so if u r ready to date again, which it seems like u are, then BREAK UP WITH UR LIVE-IN BF and continue ur life. Maybe u will catch up with this guy some other time. Cheaters never prosper.|`|2afVnStxaa	Well you did go out with him and not tell him that you were with someone else, then when you did you said you were breaking up with him and then he gets abused over the phone over YOUR drama. This is most likely a good time to break up with the BF, then give the other guy some time to get over the drama he found himself in through no fault of his own. But after the break up call him and let him know it is done and you are free. But if you are breaking up with the BF anyway, then do it, don't let it hinge on him. Even if you don't get with him, you need to do this anyway. The BF should have enough sense to see that you are moving on anyway by this point. But you also have to understand what the new guy is going through in his mind. He sees himself right where your current BF is right now, you wanting to break up and another guy calling you while he is there. Can't say I blame him right now for being scarce, can you? Hope it works out for you, but in the future, break up FIRST and leave the drama behind. Good luck to you.|`|AA10937949	If I was in your shoes I would dump the bf anyway, not only does it show this man your serious when you said you were leaving your existing bf no matter what.  As for your bf abusing him over the phone why don't you call him and tell him that your extremely sorry for what happened but also tell him that you have dumped this terrible man as well, it doesn't have to be him that does all the phoning/testing get the courage up girl and CALL HIM!!!!!      Good Luck     P.s. If he does knock you back at least your free to see who you want to and this way your not deceiving anyone
c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Both. Sometimes we're busy and go out a lot other times we just like to kick back and stay home.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	My husband and i have always stayed home on the weekends.    My husband works full-time monday-friday but we have always been low-income and dont have much money to go out but that has never bothered us.|`|lGSv138Paa	Stay home, catch up on house work, and deal with kids. Occasionally I will get out.|`|5ILdSx7faa	ummmm not sure what this has to do with marriage and divorce maybe better if you were in the dating section|`|Ud1L9Wayaa	stay home|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	I am going through a break up so lately I pretty much have been home:(|`|81wvN8Rraa	It depends on the weekend and what there is to do in our town.|`|oEdgddQPaa	stay home with dvd and wine|`|tDMEVrbWaa	Both.

V2IJHt94aa	Practice grammar and punctuation.  You don't have to be perfect but making an effort is always appreciated.    As for her, start looking at dating again, she may come back to you when she finds out.  She may not, but you will be dating and on your way to finding a woman who can love you.
hkuZSeZzaa	she doesnt love the other person. im guessing she doesnt see them as much as she sees you. i live with my boyfriend and we never have anything to talk about its not that we dont love each other we just no everything about each other so theres not much to say... and when i catch up with people i havnt seen for a while i talk constantly with them|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	Sounds like a middle school problem|`|SsI4LLUZaa	That's an indication shes not really interested in you any more.|`|XExUVo0Uaa	Ask her, not us. the best way to calm your suspicions is to put them out in the open.|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	she doesn't like you, sorry. Now dump her before she dumps you. You'll find a better girl, no worries.
I2zw4TMSaa	There is no right or wrong. It is a personal choice you and only you can make. without influence from your husband. my main problem with this is my kids are only little once so I wanted to stay at home. that is not saying i don't agree with a working mom. I am actually in school (online) so when my children get a little older i can work part time. I feel working part time you can get the best of both worlds. you will be at home enough to really enjoy the kids, but also a few days out of the week you can speak to an adult lol   I admire anyone who can balance this. it will forever be a battle|`|yGwda7wPaa	You are supposed to do what you want.  There is nothing wrong with either choice.  However, it is up to you, and not him.  If you enjoy working, I would see no reason to stop.  Plus, you have been divorced before.  If something were to happen, you don't want to feel trapped and not able to take care of yourself.  Perhaps a part time job would be good.  You could still be home to cook for him.  He met you, fell in love with you, and married you knowing that you were independent.  It isn't fair for him to try to change you now.  You wouldn't ask the same thing to a man.  He would think you are crazy.  So, do what is best for you.  If he is worth it, he will understand and support you.  Good luck.|`|vYt7LWTvaa	Honestly women should be at home if they have children, some put their careers first which is understandable they want to be able to support themselves. But when A woman is a stay home wife/mother it benefits the family unit. Wife/mother takes cares of house duties husbands earn enough to provide and enough for the little extras a stay at home deserves.    Honestly I would have stayed a stay at home mother if my husband kept his promise to get a second job to support the family. Now I love my job to much and my husband barely gets any hours with the recession.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	If you do not want to stay at home than explain that to your new husband that you have been working for so long and you do not want to have to stop.  He should want you to be happy and if working makes you happy then do it.  Being a house wife is okay if that is what you want to do.  Maybe if you want to compromise with your husband you can work part time and still be home early enough to be house wife to your husband.|`|RtkB46peaa	What's best for the family?  It sounds like you already know.  Please don't let the dips of society convince you that there's anything wrong with being a stay-at-home mom.  It's the most important job you can have, and extremely rewarding.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Why are you confused? Either you want to or you don't. There is no right or wrong answer for this but I'd think something like this would've been hashed out by now. It's nice that you have the option to be one but if you don't then you don't. Don't convince yourself that you'll get used to it.
LUhh9bSWaa	Time for side action?    Thats pretty lame what that broad did ...|`|zDeFibxzaa	sounds like you pissed her off good this time,lol. if you cant get over your problems and work it out in not a childish way that she seems to be doing to you,i would just drop it and move on.|`|t81MEJ82aa	If I were satisfied with the marriage in every other aspect, I'd get sex elsewhere. If not, I'd divorce her.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Wow, sounds like you married the wrong woman.|`|eUf9e81eaa	Keep on loving her and she will eventually change her mind.|`|bUig1Fmlaa	Tell her you're thinking of doing something nice for your secretary, since you haven't had a treat in awhile.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	Try puppy chow for the mature dog!   Has more vitamins for the role-over!   ha ha ha !|`|GbeF6gQuaa	Time to find a new wife.  I know, easier said than done.  Is this acceptable to you?  You want to be rewarded for being a "good boy".  She is using sex as a weapon.  It's up to you if you want to tolerate it.  There are women who appreciate the art of love and loving.  Let her get a dog and you get a real woman.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Cheat|`|mgwiuZT0aa	She is wrong for that. Women like her deserve to be cheated on, seriously. What you did to get your spouse is the same thing you do to keep them. Now if you haven't been doing your part around the house I could understand her point.     If you're working and doing right by her then she has no reason to go there with you. I guess she would be devastated if she found out you were cheating her.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	well,, shes proably sore from screwing  the     football team, can u blame her?|`|xtcwWlUJaa	I had a wife like that once... thats what divorce court is for.  seriously though, your wife is clearly telling you that she is superior to you and has very little (if any) respect for you. When sex becomes a "treat" for you that also means that in her mind sex is a reward that requires her to give you something she doesnt want to.  Heres the point, do you really want to have sex with someone who doesnt want to have sex with you? Is that what marriage and relationships are really about? If sex is just a "reward" in your marriage, then she really has no desire to be physically intimate with you. She also probably isnt very emotionally intimate with you either.  My plan, back when i was in your situation, was to really try harder to make her happy and then she might feel like being close with me again. But now that I'm older wiser and divorced from her I can say with near certainty, you are probably looking at getting sex somewhere else... Like maybe from your next wife.  Remember the old joke, why does divorce cost so much?.. because its worth it.  Good luck to you|`|AA11122479	that's just crazy... sex should be considered an act of love. a way to show special affection to one person alone. tell her you are grown. if you wanted a damn treat you can go to the store and buy one yourself. either she loves you or she doesn't|`|xmmX3JTRaa	You might want to talk to her and tell her that marriage is about undertsanding and adjusting to the other person needs.    She might also be going through some difficult times and you should talk to her to find the real reason whe she says like this.    Communication is very important in any relationship so talk to her and try to find the solution together to this problem.|`|I2zw4TMSaa	ok first ignore the cheat comment ...never cheat!   I know I say hurtful or mean things when my husband has hurt me but don't understand he has hurt me. for example say she came to bed in something nice and you didn't respond how she wanted. it could be possible that out of hurt (sometimes we can be a lil childish..im guilty) she has said this and then maybe again you didn't respond right and then.... so on and so on.  sex is physical so usually people enjoy it, BUT with women a lot of it is emotional. if u love her try and find out whats going on before you get mad at her. i bet 500 dollars there is a deeper issue either with herself or the 2 of u.    have patience if there is an issue. be nice no getting rude if its not resolved right away. if she has issues that cause her to not want sex more than likely she will need more support than anger|`|XL5sB7PKaa	ignore what your wife said thats stupid, try to turn her on and then have sex with her, she will think differently afterwards. Unless you suck at having sex with her, then your on your own.
aDL7xmt6aa	Seek counseling.  You're a sad, sad little girl.|`|7KAduk1daa	You're off to a good start by realizing this truth!  Many young people  spend countless hours looking for self-esteem and validation outside of themselves.  They heap all sorts of unfair expectations on people to give them the self-esteem and love they can get only from themselves.      So, how to do it?  Start by looking in the mirror for 2 to 4 minutes every day and repeatedly say, "I love myself, I love myself, I love myself!"  Sounds cheesy but it works.  Make sure you mean it.  If you do so with sincerity and dedication, this truth will sink into your subconscious mind and take hold.  Next, keep a journal and, at the end of each day, write down at least 3 things you accomplished that day.  Don't judge your accomplishments-----they can be anything.  Next, write down all the things you love about yourself.  If you need help, talk to a trusted friend or relative.  Next, write down your "areas for improvement".  Be realistic about yourself.  How are you living out of integrity?  Have you done anything to hurt others?  Don't blame yourself or feel bad about past transgressions.  Take the steps to speak to the people you may have hurt while loving yourself in the process.    Other steps:    1.  Work on healing emotional any emotional wounds which you may have.  Consulting a professional therapist may be in order for you.  Don't be ashamed of this; many people, including myself, have done it with good results.    2.  Address the negative critics in your head by stopping them and replacing them with a realistic positive assessment of you and the situation in question.  When you hear a voice criticizing yourself, say "Stop!" and replace it with a better, more positive perspective.    3.  Don't compare yourself to others.  Easier said than done, I know.  But catch yourself doing this and tell yourself that you are allowed to be YOU, and you must be.  You are a unique soul and focus on the fact that you must lead your own life when you start to wonder what others are thinking about you and what they're doing.      This is a good start.  Go out and get a self-esteem book.  Do some research online and find a good one.  I think there is an author with a last name of Burns who wrote a good one, if I'm not mistaken.  Building your self-esteem and establishing your self-identity as an independent, loving, beautiful soul is absolutely ESSENTIAL for living a life of happiness and fulfillment.  Your question is surely one of the most important ones you could have asked.  Take time over the next several years, and indeed the rest of your life, to love yourself and realize all of your "wonderfulness" and you will live happily ever after.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	email me at chelly17luvsjd@aol.com you wrote to me about that anxiety question i need your help!|`|dBuc8c2Raa	For some, this takes a lifetime.  For others, this never happens.  For many, it comes naturally.    I suggest printing out your question and taping it to your mirror or keeping it inside your daily planner.    With each new day, answer the question for yourself.  Take those few seconds to remind yourself why you are a loving, caring, intelligent, thoughtful person.  For example, remind yourself of a time when you helped someone through a rough time.    If you feel you aren't any of those things yet, answer the question with a suggestion to yourself as to how to be a better person.    I wish you insight and strength :)|`|SpfAjQkJaa	Hey!  I am guessing- you have low-self esteem or something....  Well you are not alone. I hate being the teenager- hormones or something-. I am also interested in this question and its answers. But whatever they say I know it is easier said then done. People might even say... "figure it our on your own." or "only you can know that" or something like that. Because in part it is true. I wish there was a simple answer, but there isn't. But maybe you learn how to do these things as you mature... I can't really give you advice; because I don't know what to tell you- cause I am facing a similiar situation. What can you do? Maybe have faith things will get better. And in time these things will happen.   Anyways, I wish you well. :) Good luck  I can relate to you. You certainly are not alone... lol  ~~Steph

I think about all i have given him, all he has given me, our great memories, how i would never want to see him someone else and most of all our son before acting with my emotions. I never forget i love him but instead don't seem to act like i do sometimes.|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	I have bipolar so my poor fiance has to suffer with me being the 'ideal housewife' one moment and being moody and depressive the next. We fight like an old couple sometimes, and for two years we've been at each others throats one moment and hugging each other and talking about the future the next. Really you need to have maybe one object/item that reminds you of his love. I have two, a pendant he gave me that was his and resembles his heart metaphorically. Then there is my engagement ring all I have to do is play with it and I remember the way he proposed to me (it was incredibly romantic). So maybe your wedding rings can remind you.  If this doesn't work maybe you should associate a word with a certain event, so when he annoys you or makes you mad you should say this word to bring back memories. The best thing though is communication. You should really be disscussing this with him. Yes it may upset him, but how else will he know how you feel. Just say you love him, but currently the marriage is taking a strain and you're upset/mad with him. Maybe it isn't just you with issues. Communication is the key to a successful relationship, just remember that.  Good Luck  xox|`|naequcqlaa	Just try to think  of all the good things that attracted you to one another in the first place.  You surely had good reasons for wanting to even get married, bring the reflections of the past into the present.  isn't there just some way the two of you could have a talk & make an attempt of getting rid of the bad, bringing back the good .  Do your best to think of what attracted the two of you together in  the very beginning.  Best to you...:)|`|ORy1HG0yaa	Its a conscious decision. You made a choice to be married, and you have to stand behind that choice. Go to the movies and see Fireproof. Its a great movie for couples who are struggling.|`|31kGwr1Paa	If you have to find ways to remember that you love him then you have a big problem on your hands. Seek counseling before your marriage ends.|`|t5EE6WO8aa	i know where you're coming from, every couple has their issues. for me, its the little things about him that remind me why i love him. the way he always makes me laugh, even when i'm mad, i love when he sings to me, and having him around just makes me feel safe. when we argue and i get really mad, i'm usually reminded of how much i love him when we're working out our fight. he thinks very different then i do and will bring up points that i had never even thought of and i'll have a completely better understanding of why he did what he did or said what he said. that's when i'll sit there and think to myself how happy i am that i have him in my life. it does always have to rain a little but even after the rain, if there's no sunshine to look forward to then what's the point in putting up so much effort?|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	why?|`|0sqRwzcfaa	think of that special amazing time when you met or got atracted|`|1978e46edc09459d102fc12e39033842aa	First of all, I try and consider whether or not I have a legitimate gripe.  It drives me crazy when my husband leaves dirty clothes on the bedroom floor but he also cooks me really great meals so I don't mind picking up after him too much.  If he lied about finances or I caught him drinking and driving, that is a legitimate gripe and I'd have a reason to really be mad.  If you get mad at him over your pet peeves, try remembering that he is just a human being who has little gripes of his own against you.  I try to focus on all the things that I like about my husband and cherish those moments when I feel those burst of love.  Commitment is work; it takes effort from both parties.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	Try making a list of reasons you love him and reading it when you forget to remember.
xmmX3JTRaa	It is a really difficult question to answer as we do not know too many details.    If you can accept what happened and forgive you can move on to talking to him, and asking him if he want to continue the relationship with you, if he still and really loves you.    If you think you won't be able to forgive it will be better to finish the relationship now.|`|zDmGngXVaa	MOVE ON!!!!!!!!!!!

You have to talk to the other girl and get her opinion, and you have to talk to him. And remember it is your desicion to keep the baby not his. You have to think both with your head and with your heart. What would be best for the baby? And what would be best for you. Either way make sure the father maintains child support and pays attention to his child. Maybe you and his ex could form a relationship of friendship and help each other with the children, at least then the siblings can keep in touch, as they are family and you should accept that. Do not blame the other woman, it is always the person who has cheated that is to blame. Ask him why he did it, if he says 'I dunno' then he is taking you for a fool. Do not allow him to touch your body sexually or anything of the sort until you know his feelings are true. If they're not don't hurt yourself any more. But don't listen to anyone saying dump him or stay with him because only you can make the desicion.  Raych|`|ARCURrPhaa	Dump him, and collect child support for the baby.

Now that he is gone, I still have the most 2 wonderful children in the world.  They have saved my life in so many ways, just by loving me.

Your baby's life and your own is at stake.  I have seen these situations before and they all for the most part, end even worse as they started.  Please talk to your parents or someone who is more mature, one who can help you see clearly.  P E A C E|`|AA11948528	His ex what-----girlfriend or wife?  If wife, I would exit the picture as in God's eyes they are still ONE Flesh (he is still responsible for your baby though).......

Stay calm and cool for the baby's sake.    I say, lay low for a while and focus on your inner strength and wisdom.  Don't let his nonsense bring you down into a rut.  When calls, you don't always have to answer.  When he wants to hang out, you can be "busy" doing other things.  Give yourself the space you need to find clarity.    Then, follow your intuition.  You know the way to your own happiness...it's within you.  And, now that you are responsible for another human life, you must be sure to provide yourself and your child with a solid foundation for a healthy, happy life.    You deserve better than a cheater.  So does your child.|`|aEMvCMfDaa	I would have to say that only you would know the answer to this. Yes it will be hard but as long as you follow your heart then that's all that you can do.     I would have say that you need to sit down, by yourself, and figure out what you want. Maybe write down things that make you want to be with him (more then just because you love him) and reasons why you don't think it would work out.     I am not sure if this answer would help you but I wish you all the best!
nE95Hnn5aa	In general?  Well, I think that it is beautiful institution.  I mean think about it, it is the ultimate in human relationships.  The desire of a man and woman to display all the different types of love: eros, storge, philia and agape.  I mean it is the foundation of our human society.  What could be more enjoyable and pleasurable than being with the woman that you truly love or the man that you truly love, and then bringing beautiful childeren into the world so that they can learn from their married parents the meaning of love..........    Too bad that we as humans are so imperfect and thus have to deal with the pains from marriage.  Abusive mates, arguing, separaton, infidelity, divorce....delinquent children.      One day maybe we will be perfect?|`|jTsQkuhHaa	realize that it takes work and commitment to make it work.  there will be good times and bad.   communication and compromise are crucial.  being married is pretty cool as long as you are with the right person, a good friend, lover and all that  :)|`|mgwiuZT0aa	I was married and marriage was something else. I got married at a young age and I wouldn't recommend anyone to get married until they are mentally and financially ready. So that should be around the age of 30 and up.

Without TRUE love a marriage can't work. Marriage is what a couple make out of it.|`|oGoWz511aa	I think, if you take the time to really know the person you marry, BEFORE you marry them, marriage can be a truly beautiful thing.|`|81wvN8Rraa	It's wonderful but it takes hard work.|`|AA11122479	think it could work if you choose carefully and are ready but most of the time its completely over rated|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.|`|c73c9fc0da3874e1d4faac4608c7b448aa	most of the people who responded are living in a friggin fantasy-land.

bb7cc37c884e0d86b0b8f3f44235f9b3aa	If you hooked up with him and that's all TRUST ME, he's not worth it. You seem young enough for me to say you've got plenty of time to find someone who isn't sleeping with girls randomly and then ignoring them. Also you're friend's taken and he's not backing off, not a good sign.    My advice, find a guy who wants to sleep with you and take you out to dinner, and rub it in the losers face.|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	Do you really want to go for a guy that is trying to get a girl who is already in a relationship, as that may be the sad answer to your question hun. Just talk to him, honesty is the best answer. Just say your feelings to him, the worst he can say is no. And if he says no then move on and find someone better, as I really think that he is interested in your friend for the very reason that she is already in a relationship.  Good Luck.

LcGQllH0aa	To the person(s) below: she means a  guy 15 years older than him, not he's 15 years old. Don't worry about kissing and making out. All you really have to do is "go with the flow". There really is no technique, just have fun and wing it while in the heat of the moment. I had stressed out about my first kiss, but after it was said and done, I realized there were no worries, and that kissing her would just be a natural feeling done in the way you want to. Just approach it with an open mind and your instincts will take over from there.|`|eKMXNKBHaa	hmmmmm this doesnt sound right i know your only 20 but a teacher at my school did things with a student and she went to jail  if i were you i wouldnt have anything to do with this 15 yr old|`|bib5lRQYaa	You know u can go to jail for that right?|`|1KV5rfpIaa	wait, is he 15 years old? or is he 15 years older than you?!  If he's 15 years old, leave him alone before you get in trouble!  If he's 15 years older, kiss him!  you can either not kiss him(in which case, he'll probably kiss you anyway!)  or tell him that you've never kissed a guy before(he'll probably think it's cute, and tell you that he'll teach you!)  either way, you get your kiss!  Good luck! Just make sure you tilt your head to the right!
2TC7aS8Baa	well tell him to back off or that your going to kick his ***!!!  i wouldn't let some stupid guy say **** about my friends   tell her to ignore him and that she'll find someone better who will appreciate her   just go kick his ***|`|lkSDiQ8Naa	What have you got to lose?

You do know there are alot of odd weird individuals out there? I am a Mommy of two and you remind me of my daughter. I think you are pretty. I think you need to not worry what boys think because they are trouble. The best advice i can give is: let someone like you for you and not whats on the outside. In the future when you get in a relationship and date. Dont date a person for there looks date them because their personality makes them cute or attractive. It turns out better that way! Please do me a favor please be careful posting your Picture on the web, and be careful who you talk to......|`|2C9jU67vaa	For one thing, you need to keep a straight face in your pictures, and smile more.

So don't worry about it, just be you and have fun.|`|aXUKiwNBaa	hahaha    you look like you're eight years old.    you have a chubby face, but I guess it's just baby fat.    i say maybe a 4.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	You like like you're 9 years old.

yGwda7wPaa	I think that you will be okay, but a lot depends on the judge, and if HE gets an attorney.  Usually, the mom gets to have the children in Ohio, which is where I live.  Especially with him working nights.  How we he handle that?  I would keep all sorts of documents from the doctors office, showing you take her and pay for it.  Keep documents from the daycare.  If he tries to get out of paying child support, it will just look bad on him for not wanting the best for his daughter.  My advice is to document everything you can.  Get a blank journal or calendar, and write the times when he did see her.  Show that you take care of her and that he hardly sees her.  Good luck!|`|7foornMVaa	Im in CA.      I had no lawyer and what we ended up with is joint custody with primary custody to the mom and every other weekend with dad.      The ONLY way he can take full/sole custody is if he can prove you an unfit mom which is really hard to do.     Just conduct yourself like a lady and make your demands reasonable.  The more you are interested in the best for your child the more the judge will be on your side.    Good luck|`|zDmGngXVaa	If you get lucky with the right judge then yeah you will be okay! Usually showing up in court without a lawyer makes a judge think! Sometimes if you get lucky with the right judge he/she will assign you a lawyer and the state will pay for it.|`|wc9viY4Saa	Based on experience..the more evidence you log, the better it is for you. You must jot down all dates, times and details of events that take place regarding your ex-bf and your daughter. I believe you will win, because it is 'what's in the best interest of the child' and since there has been no history of abuse on your part and you have been the primary caregiver since birth, you will have no problems in court. Remember..write everything down, it will help you a lot!|`|AA12187979	I had to learn this one the hard way.  What is the worst thing that can happen, he gets custody and you get to be the Disney Mom and he'll return them in a few weeks anyway.  If he's just pissed about support call the bluff.  If he'd actually be a better dad, your obligated to let them go.    Save your money.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Yes if you are talking about a divorce you are entitled to an attorney.  However if it is to go back for custody of an existing divorce then it is a different matter.  Child custody advocate will represent you .  Child support is basically set by state tables according to pay.  Joint custody will not change that.  You are probably ok as far as keeping your child unless you are a convicted felon.  Sounds like you are doing well for the child and don't worry about the court uprooting her good home as long as dad is not denied visitation.|`|xR3F2RFnaa	ok if im not mistaking . isnt e?veryone entitled to their own lawyer free or not? or is tht just ppl in jail|`|ghLdIUz0aa	if he is working overnight shifts, and you basically have a good homelife for her, im going to say that you will win, how can someone actually love a child if hes working at night and sleeping during the day, he cant spend any time with her, or love her. i really hope that you do win this case because i dont want to see any child being deprived of an actual decent father, not that he may actually be a good father, but i just feel that she needs love and attention, and you can give that to her.    best of luck.|`|q4rSV4cKaa	If there is no reason for the courts to change the situation, I don't see why they would. You could end up with shared custody. You probably should have a lawyer. Will your ex have one? Do whatever you have to to keep your daughter in the best situation possible for her. Your ex might be just yanking your chain. I hope he isn't doing this for spite. Is there a chance he is just full of it or has a legal date been set for this custody case. I hope it works out for you and your daughter. good luck|`|YJBsyZUxaa	Since you have custody you are definitely in a good position. However, you do have one thing to be concerned about. If he does have a good attorney and you don't have one to represent you, some attorneys can make you look bad. You need someone to defend you.
oQBzf5tYaa	This could be your first love. don't take the chance it is not|`|6VUesjxxaa	Really, hun, you shouldn't have to ask.  I thought I was in love once, in high school.  I was so sure my feelings were as strong as they could ever be.  Then, I REALLY fell in love.

You can go to your doctor to remedy this.  He'll give you a prescription which entails in a swift kick to the behind.     Also, Romeo and Juliet were retarded because they through themselves away for the first piece of tail they got and died.  They were also 15 and didn't know what they were doing.|`|B0Nh6nScaa	aaww thats ssssooo sweet!!! hhmm i would say maybe but my question to u is, when u look in his eyes do get butterflies and smile for no reason, and do u CONSTANTLY think about him?|`|U01avfzxaa	he sounds like a really sweet guy|`|N9yeUh2Xaa	It could be.  You two sound adorable though :)|`|7PBDxj8raa	Why are people so rude? If you think its a stupid question then uhh, DON'T BOTHER ANSWERING! Ugh. All she wants is an opinion, geez.

He's mean because he does'nt want you to find out that he likes you. The teasing part is the key point to knowing this. If I were you, whenever he's mean to you, don't be mean back. Instead, make jojes about what he says to you. Don't put your guard up. I did this with this one guy that liked me and he started being friendly to me.
phnq8tH4aa	i agree, just ignore him. if I'm right, he's playing a mind game with you and it's working. By doing what he's doing, he's making you want to talk to him more and maybe want to get back with him.  If i was you, i will play the same game back. In a couple of week(if he still really want to be you friend), he will call you and text you.    you are giving him too much attention and he know it. he has you in his bag. Man I hope i didn't ruin the games for the guys by trying to help you out. also, if I'm wrong, MOVE ON|`|J7o7FtZdaa	Even if he is not responding to your texts, he still reads them. Maybe you should send him a text saying "Look we might be broken up, but you are still a good person who I would love to be my friend.

I hope you understand and maybe be my friend."|`|gr8Oc9c9aa	depends why you broke up|`|TlU3zj61aa	Just give him a couple weeks of silence from you. Don't seem so antsy to talk to him.

But you broke up for a reason. If you didn't do anything wrong and don't need to apologize, you shouldn't talk to him. It seems like he doesn't want to talk to you. Give him his space, I know it's hard but don't talk to each other. That's the healthiest thing you can do, just take time apart.|`|SUKdrAkGaa	its impossible to be friends right a way.  give him space and he will text you when he is ready.  if you keep bugging him, you will never be able to have a friendship|`|TOa38qzEaa	make him jealous!! jealousy is a verrrry powerful thing if ya kno wut im saying.... go work ur womenly-assets all over his best friend when hes watching n then i can GUARENTEE ya he will start payin a wee bit more attention to ya haha GOOD LUCK! ONE LOVE!! -i |`|Oh2wVMkyaa	ok. i would do the same thing to him. dont make it look like you cant keep away from him. it'll make you look bad. if he doesnt want to talk to you then just let him go. and if he asks why you are ignoring him then tell him that you thought that he wanted to be left alone so you left him to himself.

RC8Pxx8eaa	I have had experience of both and I much prefer my fiances circumcised penis, its cleaner and it looks better too, and I know I can go down on him any time I want and there will not be any little nasty surprises lurking under that flapping skin. I would not be so keen on oral with all that extra skin hanging there yuk yuk yuk. Sweet clean and better looking so circumcised for me.|`|Yb99bIdnaa	In general, women who've tried it both ways prefer natural (uncircumcised) men. The O'Hara study explains some reasons why, but basically: The foreskin's function during sex is to ease motion and increase pleasure for both partners.    It's counterintuitive, because the surgery is performed on males, but it's females who suffer most of the discomfort from sex with a circumcised man. Soreness from friction, excessively hard thrusting, and dryness are all much more common with circumcised men. In many senses, these effects are the intended outcome of circumcision, which was popularized to discourage the "sin" of sexual pleasure.     I have to add, not all foreskins self-retract during an erection! It's rather common for the skin to be loose enough that it can be moved easily back and forth, but doesn't pull itself back. Check the "coverage index" (google it) for details. This is important, because it's those looser skins that provide the most benefits during sex.    Also, a man whose foreskin is too tight to retract doesn't need a circumcision, he just needs to stretch it. Almost all of us start out that way, it just takes a little work to achieve full mobility. If he reaches adulthood and hasn't gotten there yet, there's a steroid cream that can help, which any urologist can prescribe.     Also also: Women who think uncircumcised men are dirty have clearly not compared the male and female anatomy. The penis is much easier to wash than the vagina! That opinion absolutely baffles me.|`|Iq0ZW0vVaa	to the first respondant -----------as if circumcision is a ticket to heaven!!!!! Many christians are uncircumcised!!!!!!!    Anyway....it actually doesn't matter to me, as mostly I only deal with erect penises, and once foreskin retracts, you can't really tell the difference......  Beware of men who can't pull their foreskin back properly though...they should have a circumcision to enhance their sex life....and for hygiene reasons.....  so long as foreskin is retracting properly, it is completely healthy for it to be there.....  I would never circumcise my child unless for medical reasons.......|`|7n4rtfp6aa	what is the point of circumcising? totally pointless and needlessly painful!|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	For sanitary reasons I prefer circumsised men. But, I agree, once it's erect, the woman can't tell the difference.|`|jOFRD9sLaa	Do you prefer circumcised or uncircumcised women?|`|C6tKpoN6aa	most of my ex's have prefered circumcised, before and after i had it done.
gfHutvEFaa	Are there any guarantee's in life?     Just disclose to your potential partner your genetic history and talk about it. My father's mother has mental illness, my father had it and so does my brother. I have 3 children, 19 yr old son, 16 yr old son, and a 12 yr old daughter. No signs of it. I didn't realize the risk when I had my kids. They are great kids, with different personalities. One straight A student with a happy disposition and very responsible, a jock who is the class clown and a serious girly girl who is on her way to work on world peace. You never know.    It is ultimately up to you. Research it and find out the real heredity risks are.    Good luck.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Given the circumstances...it may be more 'responsible' to take care of your mother rather than complete your own life, but what will you do after she's gone?  You will have given up everything...for nothing at that point.    I suggest you get some genetic tests/counseling.  It will give more of a solid base to work off of...and they can tell you with surprising accuracy, the odds of passing a genetic disorder, physical AND mental on to your children.  It will also allow you more information in order to be more open and honest with anyone you find yourself in a relationship with in the future.  The only thing you will have left to do then, is let THEM decide.|`|VSw6eN4Baa	You should do what makes YOU happy.|`|X6I49NUZaa	No, you find someone who loves you no matter who you are or what you may or may not become!|`|X40Ww89qaa	why are you thinking about that?  you don't even have a girlfriend.|`|AA10405438	I am a mother with a 36 year old son.  I would want my so to find love, get married and have children.  Your mother probably has this dream for you also.  Take care of you, and the rest will come.  Godspeed!|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	No! Don't give up your future happiness! Live your life. As you said, just because your family has a history of mental illness, doesn't mean that you will contract anything or to the same degree as your family.  So count your blessings. At the moment, you are fine and hopefully will stay that way.     Your special challenge is to learn to work with your history and to inform your future spouse about your history so that both of you can make informed decisions about your future together and how to cope together as might be needed!     I'm sorry about your Mom, but she is about your present and your past. You have to make a future for yourself. Don't make the decision not to marry on your own. There could be a wonder girl out there who could love you and willing to take the risk with you. It wouldn't be fair to her not to have had a choice of say yes or no, if you were the guy for her.     You and your future wife will make the ethical decision together of what to do concerning children. As a starting place, you might look at yourself: you are the child of a family with a history of mental illness. Was it unethical for your parents to have had you? Is your mental health life so difficult that you would you rather not have been born? What might you do to support your future child, given what you know now?    Good luck and much happiness.|`|RvOH0hjhaa	you cant ruin your life over something that may not even happen. imagine if you had a son, you could never think about what if you had never had him..|`|LyZhJB1Baa	Tell them about your possible illness, and if they don't care, then marry them. At least they'll know what they're getting into.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	No, because I am married and have children and take care of my mom.  I have issues that I have to deal with and that is part of life. You can't live life with that, What if I have this or What if I don't. Its a chance you will have to take. If you get that problem later in life, you will be glad you have a husband or wife and children to help you get thru this. Lots of people have bi-polar and they are living their life. You can too.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	You sound, from the way you phrase the question, like you already have a definite leaning on this.    I don't see that forgoing marriage or partnership would be 'responsible' at all.  Children is another matter, but bear in mind that there may be other options, like testing to see if you or your partner risk passing on the relevant genese, or adoption.  If you are at a crossroads, maybe the best thing to do would be to discuss it with your potential partner.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	That's so sad for you , but have you been tested to see if you have the gene? As far as not reaching out to find some happiness, I'd say you should. If or when you get into a serious enough relationship, and you have found out you carry the same gene, be honest with her about it and your fear of giving it to your children. It should be a joint decision then on what to do. As far as caring for your mother, that's a good thing too, but if you need more than that, don't be afraid.|`|lfQHjp5baa	Have you talked to your family Dr or personal Physician about genetic testing?  My eldest son is a geneticist, and I know they are making constant breakthrough in gene detections with the human genome.  Possibly your family physician can put you in contact with a clinic or even a educational Research facility for genetic testing, if in fact it is genetic.  There is quite a possibility that it may not even be genetic.  Lay individuals blame a lot on genetics when in fact it may not be genetics at all, but a genetic predisposition instead...|`|pog5Nqj5aa	I think you should find happiness with someone you love regardless of your genes.  I don't think like is complete until you have a soul mate that you can share everything with.  I remember that I was unhappy and felt that life was empty and meaningless until I met my husband.  We've been married for 28 years now. We are the highlight of each other's life.  And I feel sorry for anyone who hasn't had such a close and fulfilling relationship.    But who says you necessarily have to have kids if you marry? Maybe you'll meet someone who doesn't want to have kids either. Or maybe you'll meet someone who already has children. You could accept them as your own and be a wonderful father.    I know where you're coming from though, and I think it's good that you are giving having children of your own careful consideration.  I too have such a family history, and I suffer from severe bipolar depression. I had 3 kids. All of my kids suffer from the same mental illness. Their lives are so dysfunctional. And I see how very much they suffer at times.  And sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice in having children. Life is hard enough as it is.    But then I also realize that no one is perfect. Everyone has flaws and genetic problems.  And we, despite our problems, are a very close and happy family.    I wish you the best of luck, and whatever you decide to do, I hope you find great happiness. :-)|`|gUScZlhXaa	of course not .you be who you are and don't let any one or anything stop you just LIVE YOUR LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11645861	you shouldnt stop your happiness because your child MIGHT hav an illness that MIGHT cause you unhappiness!.....you cant run your life based on if's!.....  and you can still care for your mother w/a family....and i work at a nursing home....and they arent as bad as people say if taken to the right one.....  i dont think you should sacrafice your happiness based on a maybe...based on something you dont know if its even guna happen|`|kGTvJS4paa	I'm sorry about your mother. And to be honest, I'm not as old and experienced as you I'm sure. But in my opinion, I don't see that being selfish. Life happens, and even if there wasn't those genetics in your family, there is still a possibility something like that could happen. If your happy and get married and have babies with someone you love and you want to take care of them, there isn't anything wrong with that. Yes you should help your mother, but that doesn't mean you need to forget about your own happiness, life is way to short, and time passes by to fast. Ultimately, you should what feels right, not what you think you should do, but that instant deep gut feeling. I wish you the best of luck.|`|pmJiJnWZaa	You sound like you really care about your possible future kid. Ask doctors about if your kid would have any problem
zzUgYFy4aa	check out the UK on wikipedia .. they have lots of real facts there and links to other sites for information
N2xzSXosaa	Aww, well, as long as you're sure you want to be with her forever and take on the responsibility for what you've done, then just talk to her parents and they can legally give permission for you two to get married. It's technically not illegal for 17yr olds anymore from what i've heard. Especially if the parents knew. You didn't really do anything wrong because you were both sexually active with eachother, you didn't rape her or anything. Plus I think the law is it's wrong if she's 17 and you're more than 5yrs older than her... just talk to her parents and they can legally allow the marriage, i'm pretty sure.    Hope this helps and best wishes with your new life together! =]|`|XZlFLecLaa	poor lil guy
Ixom7U5uaa	So far its unanimous    Sorry to say.. move on    He won't change|`|ku7s4H83aa	Talk to someone who is going to listen, without judgement.  If it is worth leaving or staying, it needs to be on your own feelings, no one elses'.  Only you know what is really right for you.  It is hard when things like this happen, but don't ever think people can't change. We all make mistakes, but it's how we face them, and rise above them that makes us better than we were before. I will be prayinf for you sweetie.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Confront him about it.|`|encb0jc2aa	Lorena Bobit|`|66jX06Onaa	Start collecting money quietly, watch for more clues, then consult a lawyer.

It's better to be alone than to be with someone who makes you miserable.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Confront, discuss and then walk. No, walking is what I'd do at this point in my life, but weigh all your options according to your circumstances. It's never good for anyone to cheat and if you stay you'll have to live with that fact. If you can forgive, more power to you, but if you can't, move on and make a new life for yourself. I hope you make the right decision for yourself.|`|qK8wcP2Aaa	it really depends on you. some people can be such a pain-in-the-*** freakin martyr, "for the sake of marriage, i love him, think about all those years we spent together" blah-blah..    you can swallow your pride & keep it to yourself & cry inside OR    you can confront/ask him & if he admits (surprisingly)to his dirty deed, for sure he'll ask for your forgiveness so on so forth.    just ponder this: if a guy can do it once, he can definitely do it again (esp. if he knows you will forgive him no matter what).     now with that in mind, if you think you can live with that (paranoia & all. "oh my god, is he cheating on me again?), then live with it. if not, then leave him.|`|hlq3Eo0haa	pretend you feel kinky,tie him up, have a blender hidden under the bed, grab a knife and chop it off and blend it so they can not put it back on

0ox8VKwKaa	Sounds to me like you know all the answers. Now you have to take that knowledge and put it into real life action. Here's how to do it and minimize the pain. If you keep focusing on him you will always be caught up in his b.s. You want to become indifferent to him. The good thing is you still have your whole life ahead of you. Don't waste another six years. Start today. Spend more time with healthy family members and friends. Shift the focus away from him. Maybe go to a support group so you can share your feelings and get healthy feedback. Don't start a new relationship for at least a year. learn to live by yourself. Just remember if your angry at him or feeling love your still emotionally involved. What you want is indifference so you can move on.Good luck|`|zDe47rREaa	damn. that is quite the dilemma. well, first off, make amends with your friends. apologize and tell them what happened, and prove that you're a trustworthy friend and won't do it again. do what you guys use to do together, and hopefully that will clear up. maybe you should invest in seeing a therapist or something to clear your mind and get your life together. if you get bad signals from a guy, steer clear of him. be more aloof and aware of guys, since they can definitely screw you over. yep, you got played. hope you get your life back together soon.|`|f8CN2qIvaa	Close the door on that jerk and move on.  You can do better.

NiF|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Nothing wrong with that.|`|MwHxyNogaa	Sure.I have seen women in strip clubs before with there husbands.You wont be the first one to go.Enjoy it and maybe you will find some moves to bring home to turn your husband on.|`|K3nObNlOaa	its fine if hes cool with it|`|jnqc2BZGaa	well, in this case its all about trust.  going with him really shows that you want to see what goes on there.  you can see what goes on there, instead of only seeing what strip clubs are like in movies....its an adventure :)  try it...u might like it.|`|XExUVo0Uaa	Hell yeah. I love to take the wife out. Sometimes I think she has more fun than I do. I love to see her dresss a little slutty and get the guys looking at her. Makes for a great night.
rDmMk9Soaa	Perfectly normal. Should you tell him? Duh! Why don't you give him a lapdance at home while you are describing to him in detail how it made you feel? Then f*** his eyes out!|`|DytsjZKpaa	yes you should. there is no difference in your feelings as there are with a man enjoying the sight of his woman with another man. i believe that if you tell him, the 2 of you will experience the other greatness of marriage. please don't listen to the negative responses you will get as the only reason they give the negative response is because they are too scared to tell their spouse what they want, so they don't want no one else to enjoy it.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	No, this is not a normal feeling for a normal wife.  At least it didn't used to be.|`|BGTkTNQyaa	Well, you have more tolerance than I do.....;)   I think it's like watching certain kinds of movies or reading certain books....they'll turn you on, too.|`|AA12272885	Why not?  I think it is normal to get tuned on when viewing something sexy, especially if it is a guy you care about who is involved.  What a rush.|`|aGOBuJtKaa	You honestly can't help what turns you on, and I do find that to be normal.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Nope he will be buying lap dances all the time if you do.|`|kTN1WGvFaa	tell him...he'll probably be overjoyed!!! lol|`|lGSv138Paa	If that turns you on, go with it. You never know, telling your husband may turn into something else that you like.|`|lnWvaRWBaa	This is a harder question for me to answer because personally I would not want my boyfriend to get other lap dances. But, I guess everyone's different so you get turned on by different things. Sure, you should tell him. You're married so you should be able to share anything.|`|RlcfZAxQaa	In what way were you getting turned on? Did the thought of the stripper doing that to you turn you on - or just watching your hubby get all horny, do that?    If it was the first option - yes, there is something you should tell him.|`|HFHNxQ0vaa	yes. i would enjoy seeing my husband bang the sh*t out of another woman. haven't done it because it might backfire!!|`|lmqjTTIhaa	ther is nothing wrong at all with it.you were with him,he wasn't doing it behind your back and there is nothing wrong with getting turned on by another woman  MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|JbKerMCkaa	Yes, I would tell him, but I would also be sure to set some boundaries to be sure you both are OK with this.  What if this goes farther into something else....is that still OK with you?  Us guys need boundaries sometimes, ya know?    What do you think this turns you on?  Is it just that she is arousing him and its a power over him kinda thing?  Most women are usually very upset if hubby goes to the club :->  Just interested.  Sometimes watching a superheroine bend steel makes me feel aroused and not sure why (maybe its a power thing too?)
BGTkTNQyaa	Sometimes, people are just manipulative and hateful, and their victims have done nothing to deserve it. What would I do? I'd speak to her only when spoken to, and have my own life and not focus on hers. Focus on you and your husband, and here's a secret: you have NO responsibility/obligation to have a relationship with her. As a full-grown married woman, your only responsibility/obligation is to your husband, and his is to you. Don't give her mental instability a second thought. It's not worth it, and it's not your problem. It's hers. Good luck.
VcrDOsFKaa	look here mr broken heart.........i wanna know ur real name as i completely hate negative ppl. i am sure u have a sweet name.    u choose ur own happiness, u choose the way ur life goes....    if u damnit have chosen to brood over a dead confused girl and dance to the tunes of her emotions, asking these questions and wasting five points makes no sense.    u need to give up a person like her who doesn't even realsie herself and therefore stop ruining ur own life     see hear sweetie, there r so many fish in the sea....  leave her, maybe she was not the one meant for u....and anyway, u r still a year younger than complete maturity which means u r still not compatible forlifelong serious decsions like that......    honey, trust me, an insecure person like her is bound to cause a great deal of harm to u.....u have a long life laying in front of u darling......love and marriage is not the only thing......    u need to make ur own choice.  be firm and hard headed......brooding over any damned girl is not the thing to do.....    look, i once heard someone say that.....""if u want to swim, do so in the wide ocean...whats there is a lake and pond? if u want to love, love ur motherland, whats there in untrustworthy humans that girls and boys are?????""|`|lJf6pSbaaa	first i think you need to realize, that she will always have a place for you in he heart, second, i think you need to find a hobby, something that makes you happy and that will keep your mind off of it. for example, one of my favorite things to do is play the piano, i love music, listening, playing etc. another thing is take pictures. i like to go to the beach, or to the park or just take random pictures.. like a closeup of a candle. anyways, these situations are definitely hard, but trust me, it is not the worse thing that you will face in your life. while it doesn't make things any less harder, it might lead you to realize how important life is, and how it isn't certain moments that define it, but the big picture.. all your memories of her, of your friends, family.. i really hope that you don't plan to do anything stupid, or something that you might regret... good luck. and dont forget that it is not the end of the world, things will begin to look up ..

Come on...|`|AA11138696	The man does not want to see his scantily clad wife grinding on the pole and giving lap dances to strangers.  He does not want to see strange men drooling over your body and trying to shove money in your G string.  He does not want to bring his friends because he is embarrassed.  You need to stop stripping and be a wife.|`|RD05jXYwaa	where do you work? maybe i can help. tmm|`|5ILdSx7faa	he is in denial?  he is embarrassed by what you do?  he doesn't want to get into a fight with the patrons at your job.|`|nC6qEW1Paa	Why not tell him to have his friends bring $100 so you can take them in the backseat of your car too......    Seriously, find something else to do with your time. By the sounds of it, I should say find someone to do....|`|ksqPjgEUaa	Why would you want him to have to see his wife drape herself all over other men? Don't you think he might be embarrassed that you still do it for a living? Don't you think it might hurt him?  Aside from that, how much do you think he brags about being married to a stripper? It's fine when you're dating one, but not married to one.   If you like to dance, try to find something a little less erotic... I bet he'd love to see you then... leave the stripping & erotic dancing to your bedroom with him. ~ Just a thought.|`|95022b8a93402999302f760e35ffd0daaa	Understand that it is hard for a man to see his wife do the belly dance thing out there with man admiring her body without feeling kind of bad about it. I would say read the writing on the wall, and talk to him. He is probably telling you "I don't mind the money but not how you get it "     Ask him whether he would rather you take on another job. Most men are slow and would not like to rock the boat but you seem to be the smart on here...approach him, without feeling frustrated. You will be glad you did, it could even save your marriage.|`|yVIb7zjiaa	Your married now and you really should think about changing  your career.To me that disrespectful to your husband and to say bring his friends for a lap dance what kind of drug are you on?

Moreover, what if she's already aware of it, and just is "playing dumb"?  What makes you think she's actually ignorant of the situation?    Nope....just keep out of it.|`|ev33OxJbaa	That would be a hard thing to do... I would tell your friend to stop this thing, it is your father and a lack of respect for herself and your family. I would tell your dad to get some help. Or you could talk to both parents about this matter. He is messing up a good family and home over this so called best friend.

If your friend is under 18 then your father is engaging in sexual abuse of a minor which could get him serious prison time.      If this is true, your father needs help and you mother will too.    But the fact is that these are your parents' private lives and you have no need to watch over their activities for eachother.  What you need is to find someone you can trust to confide because you have got a lot on your shoulders.    Is there a relative that you can trust to talk to? Possibly you can talk to a school counselor, school counselor's are obligated by law to respect your confidentiality.    If you don't feel comfortable with a school counselor, possibly you could talk to a counselor at a local agency, maybe a hotline for teens.  Try calling a local crisis line in your area, they should be listed in your phone book, they can help to hook you up with someone to give you support.    What you need is someone to unload this on, instead of just the internet. No one here can sensibly advise you on what to do, please talk to someone in person as soon as possible.|`|racnq84Vaa	You wait until your parents are both sitting down together and you say 'Dad, I know you are cheating on mom with such and such and it is time you handle your business morally so I do not have to worry about it anymore.'  'Mom, you need to listen up and deal with this however you choose to'.  ' Now that you both know what I know, leave me out of it, and dad, find someone else besides one of my mates to screw'.  Then you leave the house and have a good cry and let them deal with it.  Because you staying mum serves no purpose but to make you stressed and that stress can affect every aspect of your life, even your health.  And lying and sneaking serves no purpose for you or your mother.  As for your pops, he is a lying, cheating dog.  Sorry, but that is true and you will have to face it.  We can only choose how we are.|`|9JFnkCMfaa	I don't know what kind of relationship you have with your dad, but if it's good you need to talk to him first. If you don't have the guts, cause it's too hard, drop him a lil' note... He needs to know that YOU KNOW and that if HE DOESN'T TELL YOUR MOM, YOU WILL; and you need to ask him STRAIGHT UP WHY THA HELL HE PICKED UP YOUR HOOKER FRIEND. And about your friend? WTF? I don't know... Maybe the same approach. You need to tell her you are her friend, but she has issues, to stay the hell away from your dad AT THE VERY LEAST, and try to be there for her. If you can't help her once, and she decides she wants to keep walking the streets after your advice... Well, some people you SHOULD NOT continue to fight for. She has to make that decision on her own. GOOD LUCK!|`|Zg8aORFYaa	If you are serious....and this is not a joke...tell your mother.
lJf6pSbaaa	not really.  the frist time my boyfriend did that, i bled too, and it hurt for a while, i could barely walk, no lie.. but just tell your boyfriend to be more gentle with you. it might be that he wants to reach your g spot that way, and he might not realize that he's hurting you. i think its important to let each other know the type of stuff that you like and don't like.|`|OsHjXzxUaa	well it should NOT hurt to pee, completely diff thing. but yea obviously he did finger u too hard if ur bruised... but yea especially if he hit ur cervix that cud make u bleed a little... hope it helped :)|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Holy crap was he trying to kill you? That is actually dangerous especially if he didn't wash his hands immediately before (which I'm sure he didn't) because if his nail cut you (and your skin inside is quite sensitive, so that's not unlikely) and dirt got in it it could become infected... not pretty. Go see a doctor.|`|QADhk0nFaa	you could have a bladder infection (its happen to my friend before), but you should tell him to be a little nicer ya know just be like hunnie owie you hurt me .> thats what i do if we are having sex and hes really nice about it and hes says sorry and is nicer :D|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	no, not normal. You're a slut, seek professional help.|`|smFfcmYuaa	Your response to getting fingered too hard is normal, getting fingered too hard on the other hand shows that either your boyfriend isn't a good lover or he's a sadist who isn't a good lover.|`|ll1YiHZJaa	yes it is very normal, juss ease up|`|1bb29480284b74b7e53f51936d85c768aa	yes u can   he doesn't know what he's doing  let yourself heal   HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING  tell 'em to be gentle not so rough talk to him|`|fEnARs6Naa	lmfao omg!! tell him to be a more gental n yes that can happen "apparently" but it does go down after a day or two|`|lf4Qj1T8aa	The vagina is just like any other part of the body; if you're too rough with it, you can bruise it.    Let yourself heal until the bruise goes away, then maybe instead of letting him finger you, you could "demonstrate" the proper method on yourself. It's hot to watch, and it will give him the right idea.    Also, I should mention that if it really starts to hurt, you should see your OB/GYN, or if you don't have one, your general practitioner!|`|MQ83HGD5aa	It's very possible if he was rough. It's sensitve tissue down there and it can be very painful if it's too much. Just relax. It will heal. Next time just tell him to take it easy!! We don't need to be as roughed up as they do and I think sometimes they forget that.     PS - if you are still concerned within a week, you may need to go see the doctor.|`|SFgipEgCaa	Well its normal hon what has happened to you, your boy freind was way to ruff! He needs to be soft and gentle to you. Dont let someone be so ruff on you. Thats no pleasure. You will heal in a few days. Take a easy mean while down there if you have sex.|`|SxNSDYTBaa	well, you could be bleeding, because he might have "popped your cherry"..if you know wat the means..but seriously he could have.  next time i would..."baby that was great last time, but a little too rough, do you think this time you could be a little gentler?" and say it in like a cute voice or something.  you could say that?  hope this helped! x|`|8042dac00a4e81239a58052d23cbb99baa	No this is not normal.  What your boyfriend did was assaulted, punished and  sexually abused you with his fingers and hand for you to be like this.  There's no telling what harm he's done to you.  Regardless of what you're told here, you need to see a gynecologist right-a-way to see what damage he's done to your vagina, labium, and urethra and get the necessary treatment.  Even if the symptoms eventually go away on it's own, there is still damage you have that can cause problems in the future if there's no medical treatment.    You need to stop being sexual in any kind of way with your boyfriend.  Would you let him beat you up, giving you a black eye, busting your lip, and bruise your face and then ask if it's normal to look this way because you let him beat you up?  Of course not.  You would be getting rid of him.  Well it's the same with sex.  If they have to beat you up sexually, then you need to get rid of sex with them.  He's not thinking of you at all, he's only thinking of what he likes doing with his hand.    Some people might make light of it, but this is a serious matter.  It's your body, it's your health.  You take it seriously.

I understand what you mean because I, myself was once in a similar situation. But you know, sooner or later you have to realize that if you two are to spend the rest of your lives together, it will be better to make the fixings now than to wait and hope things would change. How I dealed with my situation was.. I made sure everything we did from then on was "just us" and "for us".  It didn't matter how many ex's my fiance had in the past.. or what he shared with them. I just made sure that whatever I had with my fiance was the best he's ever had and will be the best he will EVER have. Needless to say, he always tells me that I'm the most amazing thing that's ever happened to him. He's never had anyone as comparable as I am.      So for you and your situation, just try to be the best you can be. Who cares if she has all those ex's. You just make sure she knows that you're the best thing that's EVER happened to her and that you will ALWAYS be the one and only 'best thing' that's happened to her.

(I feel it's easier to be aproached by someone when i'm alone, plus I like the peace and quiet.)<br>  <br>  The only 2 signs I give off, are:<br>  - I'll often try be around the person I like, hey I never talk so they have no idea, but being around them makes me feel happy.<br>  - I can't look at them.. I'll look at any other person, but I can NOT look at someone if I have a crush on them. Not unless they spoke to me or something..<br>  <br>  Best way to find out from these types of people is to catch them alone and just say hi to them and observe their reaction. - It would be obvious from their response.<br>  -------------<br>  <br>  For people who aren't shy, they might just be straightforward and ask you.<br>  <br>  the only other type of person falls somewhere inbetween, where they'll deliberately throw hints and make it obvious. Flirting, teasing talking to you about other girls, ect.<br>  <br>  To my own dismay, i'm wary and don't like to look obvious so I cover my feelings fairly well.<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck. ,xP|`|RNhx7TH9aa	girl that is so easy lokks at u every chance he gets he stares at u sometime u think he is obbsessed withj u hev smiles  girl the ovious

fMEypXDYaa	Your just doing what any mother type person would do, as for them not taking good care of the momma and puppies, all I can tell you is to turn them into the local ASPA and ask if you can adopt the family if your willing to do that, at least let them know that the doggie family is in danger of freezing to death. Your right to offer shelter to the doggie family overnite, but unless your willing to take them in all the time, your best bet is to contact the ASPA and let them deal with it. The momma dog brought the puppy's to your place because she felt it was safer for her puppies there than there, because you feed her, so she thinks you will help and she trusts you more than the other family. It is a hard call, but do what you feel is best for the momma and puppies, being cruel to animals in not right for any reason.  Sadly, it sounds like they don't care about the dog or her puppies, and most likely won't appreciate your calling ASPA on them, but the dog most likely will die if you don't step in.|`|n8lXItGraa	You have no way to call your neighbors? You could always call the police station in your town and explain about the pups and see if they could contact them for you.  They might bring them to an animal shelter if the owners don't want to bother.|`|OVenWc3Paa	Take the dogs in ur house but keep them away from ur baby|`|0NGv4Vtyaa	Take them inside.

The dog is smarter than they are.  With love mamma dog will grown her fur back.   God bless you.|`|zDmGngXVaa	If the neighbors aren't taking care of their dog then they can rot. I hate people like that!  Grr! I had that problem with almost my whole block. We've got an alley FULL of cats. We put 4 bowls of kitty food out in the garage for them to eat. I had put a soft old blanket out their as well. And 2 of them had a litter. Just recently we had posted an ad up in the store and we are down to 4 cats still living in our garage! We had 2 dogs come around as well and one had 7 pups but 3 died because of the cold, so I called the neighbors but got their machine and told them to call me that night, if nothing then I was welcoming the dog and pups in my home for the night and then calling the  pound! If you have been taking care of their dog and pups then you can take action by finding their number and calling them and telling them the situation or leave a note on the door and if nothing is done then if you want the dog and the pups then keep them, if you don't then call the pound or put an ad up and give the pups away! They can't do anything to you, if you have left letters on the door or left a message on their machine! You can always call the police and inform them about it and if you want to keep the dog and pups for awhile then inform them that and the neighbors can't do a dorn thing to you!|`|xQn3rR6Naa	That is a smart dog if you ask me.

It sounds like they're more likely to take care of the animals then the rightful owners. :(|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I would be upset about the puppy's.  But would not be sure about bringing them in the house with the baby there.  Do you live in a house?  Does the house have a garage?  If the garage is attached to the house and it is not very cold in there you can let them sleep there.  If you have no problem with them being in the house, try to send a note to your neighbors telling them that their puppy's were outside in the cold so you took them into your house.  If they get upset tell them you were only trying to help and if you see the puppy's outside again you will call the police.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	You could bring the dog and her puppies in and leave a note for them so they would know where their dog is.  I wouldn't be mad if I were them - I would appreciate my neighbour looking out for my pet.  (I'd also be a little embarrassed about what happened.)|`|jtjISk6qaa	you should keep them in your house and report your neighbor for animal abuse!|`|0YrSsKUmaa	Call up your neighbors and leave a message on their machine telling them you have their dog and not to worry & you'll return in the morning|`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	Can you call them? If not, then I would bring them in if its going to be cold out. They probably won't get mad if they don't care about them and don't care for them properly. The poor babies!!|`|dDGKUTT1aa	it will wind them up and they wont be happy,maybe try later on ,maybe ask  this question in the animals section as well|`|OocDN5evaa	Take the dogs inside! You haven't legally done anything wrong and you could always threaten your neighbors with animal abuse laws if they start to hassle you. Take the dogs in and approach the neighbors with the situation in the morning.     Aw, dogs....|`|MzgecQSLaa	It would be offensive to the owners, but then it would give you an opportunity to confront your neighbors about the dogs. Maybe you can leave your garage door open a little bit, so they can crawl in. You could put some blankets in there for some extra warmth and comfort.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if he was married to someone else at the time, maybe he wasn't always around like fathers are. being married to someone else would be a legitimate excuse. if your mom tells u this is your father u should believe her, and accept it.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	if you need to know, you could get a paternity test done|`|ma6Re8B1aa	1) I would never date a married man!!!!!!!<br>  2) I would never have a baby with a married man because I would never date a married man<br>  3)I would never be with an unhappy married man because I would never date a unhappy married man and have a baby with him whether he was a unhappy man or not???<br>  4)What I think is your looking for a daddy figure in your life because you never had one. I think it's high time you grow up a little and figure out why you would date a married guy and have a baby with him. You can get attention in other ways in your life.|`|AA10460376	Are you saying that your Mother had a baby with a married man and that baby is you?.....Anyway, I think that it is ok for the baby to know her Father but his Wife should also know that the baby exist....OH WHAT A TWISTED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE....This does not sound like it is going to have a pretty ending.......Good Luck to you!.....|`|OHfZFR31aa	I can imagine most guys would not want any pictures taken because the mistress could always send them to the man's wife.

Get one if you want to find out....or just tell him you want to get one. He shouldn't have any problem swabbing the inside of his cheek if he knows he's your father. If he's not your biological father, he will tell you at that point I would think. Another thing is....if he isn't your biological father, your mom probably kept that from you to protect you, so don't get angry with her if that's the case. It's maternal instinct and your biological father was probably just a sperm donor and unworthy of being your father.|`|AA10487501	if this is bothering you i guess you can either talk to your mom or both ur mom and dad and ask them to tell you the truth.<br>  or u could do a test to check whether you are really his daughter.<br>  but even if u r not i suggest you dont make an issue of it if ur mom is happy with him|`|hd3B4DT0aa	i dont know you should ask your mom and see if they have them or they lost them. i've never seen my picz when i wasnt yet born because they lost them when we were moving.<br>  i dont knw any other way to help you.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	you are a victim son don t do that once you are married

(srry to put it that way). and if he is a jerk and u go out with him, you could turn into a jerk (back to the breakup thing) without realising it.
SpfAjQkJaa	Hey!  I can't believe you want to change your name!!  It is soo unique, I would die for a name like that!  No one has a name like that... Krista allie....  Not one person will be named that.   Betcha, one day you are going to like it!  My name is Stephanie- no not wierd, BUT I have 5 other Stephanie friends. I know millions. No uniqueness whatsoever. If anything I should change my name.  Shakira, Thalia, Beyonce are 'wierd'(to you it might seem because it is unusual) If you ask me the more unuasl the better. They don't even need a last name. When they say Shakira you know who that is. The same with yours.   You really should not change it. Plus you need to be 18.(right?)  Your mom thought something about that name. Ask her why she named you that? Give it time. Learn to love it!  Hope I helped  ~~Steph|`|ONZ4QhDIaa	No name is really weird besides you can't change your name until your 18+|`|fwIe1sQwaa	I like it, its unique :)
RC8Pxx8eaa	Dont do it, you must never ever be pressurised into doing anything sexual that you dont want to do, its the first rule and it lasts for life.  If your bf appears not to worry whether you do it or not, then dont do it, its not for everyone and some girls find its a real turnoff especially if boys are not clean down there.  Just be confident and say you dont like doing it, if he accepts it then let it go.  Good luck.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	simple- DON'T.   1st- a guy who loves you DOES NOT pressure you into anything you don't want to do & looks at how YOU feel about that first  2nd- Talk to him and explain how you feel and if he still pressures you then let him go. You deserve more than that.  x|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	Then do not do it.  If he is worth keeping as a bf,he will accept your feelings...|`|PHKSoUTDaa	But you don't say if he ejaculates in your mouth or if you enjoy him giving you oral.  If it's the taste of semen you don't like, then finish him by hand.  If you enjoy receiving oral sex, it's only fair you compromise.|`|ErtxmW4Xaa	shag him lol that will put his mined of a hummer lol :)|`|p0ioXUM2aa	do good h..js instead|`|xEmIhOc3aa	if u dont like it then top if he loves u he'll understand|`|sSueqf2xaa	If you don't like it then it's simple.. Don't do it. You shouldn't feel pressured into doing something that makes you feel uncomfortable. If he's a proper boyfriend and he respects you then he shouldn't be bothered either way. It's your choice as well and he wouldn't like it if you pressured him into something he didn't enjoy. Have a chat with him about it and say it isn't for you but maybe you could find something else you both enjoy together. Good luck.    ? Kimmiii|`|SsGLm3Xvaa	Ask him what else he likes you to do, and try to do those things more instead.    Also ask if he likes hand jobs as well.    If you don't like oral sex when he goes pretty far into your mouth, try only taking in the tip and using your hand around the rest.    You should probably talk to him about your feelings, though - he should understand.  Sure, he'll be disappointed, but it's how you feel.  Tell him you love to pleasure him, and will maybe do oral sex once in a while, but it's something you really don't like.    EDITED TO ADD: You can try to ask him what else he likes in a sexy kinda way... like when you're with him, kiss him and ask if he likes it.  Put his hands on your body and ask if he likes it.  Use your hand on his you-know-what (hehe, sorry for the silliness) and ask if he likes that.
1Hx7MFUvaa	Falling in love is the most wonderful thing in the world, that's one thing money can't buy.  Getting married and raising a family are not for everyone. I am engaged and even though I hate almost every kid I meet the thought of not having my own child makes me feel hollow.  People get married for the wrong reasons sometimes to the wrong people. I got my fingers crossed.|`|sTgT1lyKaa	I thought I did.  I was married once before and had a child with my ex wife.  She actually turned out nuts, so we divorced and I had her parental rights terminated.    I ended up getting remarried to another woman.  She is very stable in her life, she is a bit older than me and very mature.  She even adopted my son.  However, for some reason things don't seem to be working.  It would appear as if we are going to get divorced sooner or later.    I am done with relationships.  I will never marry again, nor will I ever start another family.  I might get a gf, but that will be it...just a gf nothing more.|`|D9k0aoqdaa	fall in love..yeah, i mean who doesnt    but married and kids????  i dunno maybe one day but got no serious plans for it  why would i want to  do that before i get a chance to live my own life and and do what i want to do first    why you ask??|`|VygBNA0Waa	full in love yes   have a family yes  get married yell no   when you get married its like they own you and treat  you different and everything changes   a bigger comminment is having children because you cant just sign a piece of paper and walk away you have that connection for the rest of your life|`|9db251db6fb9ab5257ac294d2bac13b4aa	Yes, with the right person....when someone is ready for it, love is a wonderful thing.....:P|`|hMavMBo4aa	yes eventually i guess.  i fell in love and got married.  not ready for kids yet.  right now i want to finish school and get a good job.  it's probably not too smart to be having kids right now.|`|pWArTam4aa	Fall in love?  Yes    Get Married?  Yes    Raise a Family?  I think so... yeah    Because I want to be loved throughout my life - who doesn't?|`|3ijLQe5laa	isnt that what life is about|`|DWElTA36aa	Yes. Yes. Yes. I have nams picked out already! Heh.    I want to have a big family. Always have, probably always will. Don't really know why, just feel like I should. :-)|`|VXaKIFVLaa	yes to all your questions i honestly think i would be really happy i am already in love and i know its gonna last we have been through so much and i know we would spend the rest of our lives together and being married and having a family is what we both want and i know it will bring us so much closer together!! i know it would make me really happy and i look forward to it
2545a1a8d5f0a0f14de8e407f7c80f7caa	Yea it all depends on the person. some people will change, some wont. Everyone thou gets characteristics thou from there other half. some people start to change the way they look, or dress, not because they feel like they have to, it just happens. alot of times people tend to be very happy in there relationship if they start dressin like each other, I read that, but thats over many years. Anyways back to the point, if you allow yourself to join in with your partners activities like smoking or violence then it seems like you'll do anything either a)just to be liked or fit in with this person, or most likey b)that you havent found yourself yet. You know as you grow up you meet tons of people and try to fit in places, but once you see how your gonna be when your older, you'll know what type of girl or guy your looking for, then you guys will have more in common, both of you want the same, and then if a influence is rubbed off, its in a good way/ but then like i said alot of people will fall or follow anything. or if that person is a really good mind bending he can manipulate you into his way of thinking, which I see alot of guys try to do. Thing is, stand your own, be yourself, and you know right from wrong, and obviously if your partner doesn't then he or she wouldnt be right for you, you know. hope that all kinda makes sense and that I kinda answered it|`|twVyisGnaa	It all depends on who the person is dating and how strong their moral values are and how desperate they are to get their partner's love.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|AA12159712	Yes they can have a huge influence on each other. The Bonnie & Clyde effect, if you will, for bad influences. Otherwise, if one feels that strongly about the other, it could determine which path is taken, good or bad.

GOOD LUCK|`|5jMNBO2naa	too many to list    but you get your life  freedom and sanity back|`|41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	Yeah, you get rid of something that was causing you distress and eventually you'll get your peace of mind back.|`|uXeGsxSVaa	Meeting new people. Getting rid of ball and chain.knowing what mistakes you are capable of so you won't make them in the next relationship.|`|81wvN8Rraa	If you are not happy then you will be happier with your life.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	The negative flaws within yourself that led to the demise of your relationship could force you to work on improving yourself. For instance, if it was alcohol or drug addiction that led to divorce, it could force the addict into a recovery program. The divorce could serve as "proof" that the addiction truly has taken over the person's life and that help is needed. That could serve as a catalyst for the person to get the help they need to overcome.    The same concept could be true for other destructive tendencies, such as lying, taking advantage of another person, cheating, taking the other person for granted, etc. When divorce occurs, the person might look back and reflect and say "wow, what caused this to happen?" Then they might resolve to change & not let it happen again.     If there are children involved, some positive might come from the time that they spend with only one parent at a time. Getting to know that parent better - without the other parent around - might be a more peaceful environment than if the two parents were fighting. It might also cause a slightly uninvolved parent to take greater initiative to know what's going on in the child's life because they won't have a spouse to "fall back on" or rely on for daily information.|`|tI7QP3dkaa	You get rid of the pain in the neck  you get to do what you want when you want  you don't have to answer to anyone for things you do  Less people to clean up after  can eat what you want when you want  less expenses   you get the whole bed no half   and the list goes on|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	yes the woman gets the house, the car  the bank account, the kids , alimony. child support, half of the guys pension, then she gets to start on victim number two, yes i would say that was pretty  positive, wouldn you agree?|`|i1kl1VDUaa	There are TONS of positive things.

And stop living the lie he lived every day of your married life.
AA10223196	I've been married several times.  Each time I married into poverty.  All my exhusbands are now deceased.  Next time I'm going to think about where I stand financially.|`|diQ0oodqaa	Usually, it means her love for the person the ring came from. You know, joy, commitment, spending the rest of her life with a great guy she loves with all her heart, etc.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	wow, no. Maybe some women, but I actually asked my husband to trade my engagement ring back in for something with a flush mount (bezel set) so that I wouldn't lose the diamond. I kept snagging it on everything, and I was a nervous wreck. Now I have what most would consider a 20 year anniversary ring (with diamonds channel set all the way around) as my engagement ring, and a plain white gold band as my wedding ring. The whole set was less than 1000 dollars, and I prefer it. So no, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I never think about how much money my ring is worth. I think of how awesome my husband was to appreciate my concerns rather than be offended....|`|Lz3yxrXKaa	If she is thinking that then, don't marry her. when i first put on my wedding ring, my first thought was this person wants to spend the rest of with me, this person wants to be a witness to my life and there's. This person loves me, also, yeah, this person wants to be commitment ed to me.|`|81wvN8Rraa	I think most women are excited about the man they love and how they are treated and look mostly at what that ring symbolizes.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Only if she's really shallow.    But guys, dont test it by buying the cheapest tackiest ring for her either.  Be respectful, give her a quality token of your love and committment to her.|`|VygBNA0Waa	wow yuck and now i have to wear to for the rest of my life how embarrassing|`|S8CZBCe2aa	No she thinks about this wonderful man who is now her husband.

vdmAOQ3Paa	I'm a sophmore girl in High school and I think it's cute when you act like you want to be together, but don't be the one to want her, make her want you just as bad.   Slowly hang out mroe and more and see if she is interested. DON'T THROW YOURSELF AT HER. Be confidante, but don't act like you have got her easily.   As for your clothes, don't worry about it.

There was this guy in my math class he was the equivalent of a scene kid (this was back in 1996). He had the hugest crush on me and I totally ignored him - what would my friends think about the long haired, plaid pants, stoner guy. Fast foward 12 years later we now have a child together and are on the track toward marriage and a home. If that makes you feel any better.|`|A2u06IS1aa	You should try flirting with her.

I wasn't sure exactly what a framed picture is...like a shadow box?
g7SUs2A6aa	First of all, I am really sorry you have to deal with that! I know you don't think it won't change anything , but you really need to tell ur mom what she is doing! Atleast you have told her how you fell! I had the same problem with my mom, but It was my older bro that she liked to hang out with more. I finally told her what she was doing and it had absoloutely no effect on her at all the first time I told her. Then, I began to write down the things she did with me and the things she did with him for about 2 weeks, there were 2 things on my side of the list and 10 on his sid eof the list. I took the list and wrote my mom a letter about what she was doing and how it made me feel. I took that letter and list and left them on the dinning table for her to find on my way out to school (to give her time to read and take in what i was telling her) and when I got home that day we had a lon long talk about the situation and now its not a problem! It took a lot of time and tears, but now its over and we are all happier and she spends equal time between her children. Oh, don't bottle up your feelings inside they just build up and turn to anger and that only makes things worse.      I hope things get better for you!|`|mYAbq6fnaa	i know exactly how you feel. of course, you'll probably get to spend more time w/ your mom and have more freedom once your sis graduates, but ask your mom if you can do something with a friend once in a while, or ask your dad if he wants to go play baseball or whatever he likes to do. if none of this works, find something to occupy yourself and pray that you'll get more freedom soon.|`|LYopP8Zcaa	Try talking to your parents and tell them how you are feeling. Try family therapy. Also, you are only in 8th grade, your 12th grade sister should have a little more freedom than you but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to do anything.|`|fbQ2q6FMaa	No problem and write a little note saying how you feel because obviously your mom is not ready for an open and frank discussion with you. I know how you feel, I hate it when my family or friends do that!|`|JbDfdJb8aa	Hello, I believe that you have to explain how you feel to your mother and father, regardless whether you think it will help or not. Part of maintaining a healthy relationship with your family members is communication, and you know that deep down your parents love you both equally even though recently they have said and done some hurtful things to you.    The important thing is that you address these concerns sincerely and make sure they know how their behavior has been crippling you emotionally.     I would start out by telling them that you have been feeling very depressed lately. That will certainly earn their attention. Once they realize the root of the problem they will probably be able to put themselves in your position.     Additionally, it wouldn't hurt to talk to your sister. She may be completely oblivious to the fact that you are being excluded. Having her social support and her as an ally will help in convincing your parents that something is wrong.    Good luck, I hope you work things out.|`|iaDhbBQQaa	You're in the eighth grade, you should be an apathetic teenager by now. Your sister is about to graduate high school and go on to something else, so of course your mom is gonna want to spend time with her. And hey, once she's gone you can go shopping all you want without all the favortism. And just get some good friends who will go shopping with and that to me is more fun.|`|TdRVzKfZaa	A falcon punch should solve it.|`|B2xlWmKXaa	wow maybe you should make it into like three to four sentences not like 50!!|`|sPQvp2cEaa	My parents really suck too. It makes me really mad when they try to control what i wear. Sometimes you just have to do what they say cause alot of the time they dont even listen to what you have to say. If I were you I wouldnt throw it away, but tell your parents you did.|`|2k5gj59Daa	you could say       mom can we please do something together like bowl ,go to a movie, go have a bite to eat, or lets go to the mall do some shopping together.

2b0812b5f0b805dbd0a14b215181713daa	My fiance was in Tampa on business in January ( we live in NY) He was in a bar where there was dollar bills all over the walls that people had written messages on. He wrote Marry me? I love you ! (and our names)on a dollar bill and had the bar staff place it somewhere noticeable. (He knew we would vacation there four months later...) while vacationing there a few months later, he told me he wanted me to check out a bar he thought i'd like. so, we went and he was videotaping things, which i thought a bit odd, but really didn't think too much about. We were reading some of the dollar bills, and then started chatting with the bartender who remembered him from months earlier. They stood talking for what seemed a long time, so i started reading more of the messages on the dollar bills while standing there. Then I found "mine" and started crying. He had the whole thing on video.  He pulled a ring out of his pocket and asked me to marry him...I couldn't stop crying or saying "are you kidding me?" but i did say yes... to the cheers of everyone in the bar....|`|rS5oHNGjaa	Well I havent been proposed too, but this is how I want my future fiance to propose to me, we get together for a date, and its just us,(or is it??) (friends are hiding all over the park) Where i want to get proposed too...and then we hang out just me and him and he proposes and then everyone suprises me by popping out at the least expected moment, and then all of us just hang out.|`|ghLdIUz0aa	mine was on easter sunday, i stayed over his house, started with breakfast in bed, which my fiance alwayys does nice things for me, then leaded to him grabbing me and kissing me, not like a hurt grab, but a nice one, then he told me that he loved me with all of his heart, he told me that i make him the happiest guy in the world, and that hes so lucky to have me, then he got up got on one knee and proposed, my ring was in a gorgeous porcelin box that i still have, and he chose the best ring i could of ever asked for a carat and a half past present future princess cut with princess cut bagettes on the side it was so romantic |`|ZPvq5cd7aa	My fiance was in Iraq.. we talked almost everyday on MSN or Yahoo. I was at work and we were playing on messenger using the drawing  part and he drew a picture and then wrote "will you marry me"  =)  He came home safely a few months later and we are hopefully getting married in June!!|`|SYuukcxgaa	We were on holiday in New Zealand and when we were in Queenstown he sneakily arranged a private helicopter ride up to a secluded snow topped mountain which is where he proposed. Very romantic and very unexpected. I was so choked up with emotion I could only nod.|`|PKS67gsRaa	We went to dinner with his and my family to celebrate his birthday.  It was a teppan style grill - the kind where the chef cooks right there in front of you.  Usually at the end of the meal the chef writes "Thank you" with oil on the grill but this time he wrote "Marry Me?"  I looked over and there was my fiance with the ring!  Then, after I accepted, the chef lit the words on fire.  Pretty darn cool if you ask me! :)  The really funny part was that the chef misjudged the amount of space he had on the grill and ran out of room for the word "me" and had to slant it diagonally. So my mom made him do it again so she could get a better picture!  Ha.  :)|`|7CKipTZOaa	He sang me a song that he wrote for me that talked about wanting to love me for eternity, I know it sounds tacky but it was sweet and he rocked it and had me all swooning, was expecting him to go straight into another song but he hopped off the stage, came over to me and asked if I would be willing to let him try, was very sweet
mzNLfY4Caa	I show concern if you die =(     I don't know you, but I care about you. You can either move forward in life, or move backwards. You can either suffer from your pain, or you could learn and grow from it. Right now you might feel like you are not worthy, or you might feel like you cannot do anything because you are fourteen years old. Hon, as you get older, life starts making sense to you. It's hard for other people to love you when you don't love yourself. I don't know you are or what you want. You obviously care about yourself if you're posting this question. My answer might be another insignificant one, but I just want to let you know that even though you might not realize it, you are a human being from this planet, and we need you. There can't ever be an extra person. You have life for a reason, and even when times get hard, you should rely on yourself. Learn to stay strong, and most of all, love yourself. Please...|`|r8Sme80raa	You're extremely depressed you need to get counseling as soon as possible!    You are vulnerable right now!  My advice to you is to stay away from strangers, people you don't know.   Reading some of these other postings, there are folks "way over their heads"!    They don't have the experience or the training to assist you!|`|g7gvzhkpaa	This world, this world is cold  But you don't, you don't have to go  You're feeling sad, you're feeling lonely  And no one seems to care  You're mother's gone and your father hits you  This pain you cannot bear    But we all bleed the same way as you do  And we all have the same things to go through      Hold on, if you feel like letting go  Hold on, it gets better than you know      Days, you say they're way too long  And your nights, you can't sleep at all  Hold on  And you're not sure what you're waiting for  But you don't want to know more  And you're not sure what you're looking for  But you don't want to know more      But we all bleed the same way as you do  And we all have the same things to go through      Hold on, if you feel like letting go  Hold on, it gets better than you know      Don't stop looking, you're one step closer  Don't stop searching, it's not over  Hold on      What are you looking for?

Talk to someone, ANYONE. not strangers on the internet  talk to someone who you know cares.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Call the local teen help line or suicide intervention line in your area. Explain your desire for counselling to them and your mothers opposition to it. I am confident they will be able to get you help, or even approach the counsellors in your school, tell them your desire to get healthy and your mothers opposition to it.|`|DjCLWseZaa	tell a teacher. They will listen.|`|1oJ1qokjaa	yeah. sometimes it feels like my family is falling apart (my parents are on the verge of divorce) and i dont get along too well with my younger sibs. i have a lot of friends but i not really any of them are true true true bffs if you know what i mean. i thank god so much for giving me a twin because my twin sister is one of those true bffs and i know shes never going to go anywhere. i can always talk to her about stuff and she always gets me. weve seen eachother everyday of our lifes except for like 4 days this one time and even then we talked on the phone.  we get each other because weve done practically everything together. we always talk about how we dont get how everyone else can make it thru life without a twin! i dont know where i would be today without her support. but there are still times when everything falls down. i know what its like to hate how things are.  when things are taken away from you or you have to go through big changes or even hating how everyone else has something and you dont. like i hate that im short (5'0")  and skinny (76 pounds) at 15 and look so little! but i always just take a step back and figure everything has to turn out okay. i thank god for the things he has given me(like amazing life-long friend cousins) or hasnt(like diseases) and i always pray for him to help me be a better person. it helps me when i write about my problems in a song and sing them or poem or if im mad at someone, i write it all down and how much im mad at them and then shred it. it gets your anger out. and to be optimistic, i make a huge list of all the things that are GOOD about me and all the things im blessed to have or be. i can compare all those things to everything i wish i were or had and i see that im actually pretty lucky and i sleep with a smile on my face. it makes me feel alot better.  i look in the mirror and insted of saying whats wrong i say whats right? i smile at myself and i feel way better. things get tough in like but you have to be tougher. believe in yourself and shoot for the stars because you can make it. go to college and be loving and caring to everybody and compliment everyone and people will like you and once you get outta your house, youll be able to start over. just make the best of things until things get better and dont sit around. go out and have fun becuase it will make you feel better. good luck and i promise that things can only get better! =]|`|zczneZ7baa	pray to God and he will guide you    a friend of mine had this to say: "wat would u gain by ending it all? u make it sound like people are just trying to be perfect and have fun just to smite u. they have fun because they try. if u try to find the good in people than u will find the good in life.everybody has problems but the only difference is tht u have had a lot more problems than anyone else."|`|5ocCUojWaa	calm down just think happy thoughts   and try to meet new ppl mayb go out all dressed up and have some fun   try to forget all ur problems|`|XoYMRvtDaa	Go to your school counselor and tell him/her everything. Please don't kill yourself.|`|XSXRVoETaa	i was just like you. and i am 15.  don't try to kill yourself it's not worth it.   go move in with your grandparents if you have any; they seem to care a lot.  or just go to a therapist.  or just talk to a friend. anything helps.  just don't kill yourself .|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Well, stating the obvious, you do need help. If you can't go to therapy because your mom won't take you, could you not just go yourself? Although you may not have the money to do that if your young. Well, there is always other people you can talk to, like at school or something, a school councillor? A school nurse? Those kind of people will help you and sort your head out, you need to talk to somebody that WILL listen and WILL try to help you, seen as your mom obviously just doesn't give a crap about you. Talk to a teacher or something. Don't be scared, because they will be glad to help you. You need to talk it through will somebody that will pay attention to get your head sorted out. You seem to not have people around you that you feel like will care or that you can trust, I really suggest talking to a teacher or a school councillor. They will be sure to help you and they will care about you.|`|YFgREceaaa	ur like a female version of my life if that makes sense but highschool..  listen to some music, exercise--you can put your frustration into running or biking..its a great way to forget when all you can think about is cranking the pedal another time. Also get some meds..im on some they have helped alot..but yeah excercise like running not an organized sport is good and depression meds...jus relize that there are other people out there that feel pretty much the same way..people that wonder why people can smile, love, and enjoy life...dont give up if you ride it out things will get better.|`|396786e39de6d27bb83a16323b6d33ddaa	Oh sweetheart. Listen I know exactly where you are coming from...I started becoming depressed in the 4th grade. Ironically, my mom and stepdad, who I tolerated, were having trouble. It didn't really hit until the 6th grade when I started becoming suicidal. However, I told my mom and she went BALISTIC she thought that the only cure was talking and praying to Jesus to help me. I love Jesus and all but I need help. This is not something that you can just pray away. I know how you feel. It's like you try to talk about it but people either treat you with sympathy, that is not wanted, or they just automatically think you are crazy. Let me tell you something. People like us are not crazy. and no matter how much you might believe it, you have to keep telling yourself that because if you don't it will get worse-trust me. I cry almost everyday. Sometimes I don't even realize that I am doing it. I read to get out of my world and listen to music all day. Writing suicide letters really did help me out though because it would kind of take the desire to kill away. Not saying that I haven't tried it. I can't count the number of times I did. Just try to reach out tom someone at school, maybe your counselor and try to find a way to get therapy. I have tried therapy but quit because she wanted to send me away. DON'T LET THEM SEND YOU AWAY!! Just keep your head up and try to find outlets in life. My outlet is art and photography. I use these to describe how I am feeling inside because I am not comfortable talking to people about it. I cut, but don't you do it. I know it isn't right but again DON'T YOU DO IT... and try to find people who are there to support you. I have only two friends. And they are the closest things to me and they help me through my struggle everyday. Okay? And I know this isn't a cure but try talking to Jesus- or just out loud. It isn't a cure, but it sure does help sometimes when you want to talk to someone who won't judge. You can just say it and feel a little better. I am 17 by the way and if you need someone to supprt you....I definitely will. Just let me know okay? You will get through this alright?|`|B1WyHzyHaa	if you dont want to die dont kill yourself simple as that|`|QdRuiZI4aa	Well Sweety. I too went through a lot of depression. You need a friend. I would be more then happy to be your friend. Have wide shoulders to hold your head on. Smiles to ya and know yes you are very special.|`|pKIIOuyLaa	Just REMBER diing is never the answer.

There is a word in the hospital that deals with these things. You stay there for as long as you need to and they look after you well.  4. You could also make alot of friends and go stay with them.|`|4YPseFSIaa	i ammm so sorrry, you shouldnt be going through this.  but it seems what was getting you on your feet and when you were the most happiest and stable was when you were in love with that boy when you were 12, try finding another guy to full fill what that guy did. i know its gonna be hard and its the only thing that will "cure" you.  i hope this will help if not, start looking back on the things that do make you happy and not what makes you sad.|`|Txmk80I6aa	I'm sorry. I understand what you're going through, and let me tell you, I'm so so glad i didn't kill myself.   I know its hard, but i think you should try to rejoin cheerleading and be social with the other girls and stuff;  It's hard, but try to act happy around them, and be yourself and soon their love will definitely grow for you, and invite you places and you'll cheer up, i'm sure.    i dont know I'm kind of rambling, but i want you to feel better.|`|9c34c7a7ad663d73b2aa40d6cd0868d7aa	forget about everything else. you're 14, and it's a critical age, yes, but there's still an entire life to go. take it slow, don't think of "why am i like this?" but think "what can i do to make myself happier?"     what do you like to do? take up cooking, baking, art, music, etc. to see if it distracts you or at least makes you feel a bit happier. I like to cook when I'm upset because then I make the food, which takes a while, and it's good and I like it and so does my mom and bf, and it makes me feel happy with that sense of accomplishment.     it does suck that your mom doesn't pay attention, but that means that you have to love yourself more. as you grow, you'll meet people in life that will feel like sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers to you. if you want to start out slow, why not get a yoga dvd from the library or store and do that at home if you don't want to go out. and even though you said to not recommend volunteering, there are differnt things out there: at the animal shelter, with children, for the city or a museum. and a lot of that really does give you gratification, especially working with animals. I used to walk dogs for the animal shelter, and its great because you see them get homes, but in the mean time you play with them and give them freedom, they're like pets you don't have.     as for friday nights, they get more fun after you're 21. school dances and all that isn't too big of a deal, just means that you're going through all the hassle for some stupid thing with lame ppl.     there are 2 great and funny books that i recommend for you 1) How to spot a bastard by his star sign  and 2) A pagan's nightmare.  Both books are funny and uplifting, especially the first one will make you laugh about your ex.     If you want to talk more, add me on messenger    also, just because some people smile, doesn't mean they're happy. when i was in middle and high schools, i was pretty depressed but smiled to cover that up...nobody ever thought that i had my own suicidal thoughs. but it does get better, it really does. people do care about you, and the more people you meet later on in life, the more that will care.|`|Z5Gs9bIDaa	i understand, i am the same way, no one even cares, the only thing that cheers me up is to play guitar or listen to music. i have almost droped out(oh yea im 14 too) i have been in bad relationships and now i cant even feel love anymore, i cant find that perfect one, to me everyone sucks, trust me we are like the same, i almost tryed to commit suicide tonight but i just cant, i hate my life but i always remember it will get better, becase its true, it will, and no one can tell me what to do, and i really dont care if people hate me or are better then me becasue when im older im out of my state off to meet new people, you should feel the same just remeber all those asses you hate you probally will never see again once you are 18 or whatever and move out...good luck|`|OqiFoJFraa	i feel your pain...    all i can tell you is what i did when i was going through this(i still am, but not as severe as before)  first off, find someone you will trust.  I know, it sounds very corny, but try, search.  It could be a friend, teacher, counselor, a bum on the street.  Talk to them about anything that bothers you.  Anything that's on your mind.  If you cant, push yourself to be open.  Make yourself go out, even if you cant get up from the bed.  Even if you will be all alone, you will have people around you, and it will make you feel as part of the whole.  Do stuff alone, and you will realize that it isn't so bad, and over time, if you'd be open, you will start having friends.  And find someone that cares.  But most importantly, never stop before any challenge.  Take it.     Do things with your life, dont close your heart to people, and you will feel better.    hope you all the best.|`|GT0hOEGhaa	The first thing you must know is that you aren't the only person like that. Long term depression and suicidal tendency is a very common thing in the US and the world. So don't feel ashamed of it.    The truth is that the world is a hard place to live in. It will never be easy, but as long as you have faith and hope, you will be able to go on.    I recommend you read   The road less traveled : a new psychology of love, traditional values, and spiritual growth  by M Scott Peck    http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0671250671   There you will find a place that will lend it close to you    It is a bit long but is very useful|`|LYopP8Zcaa	First, I would like you to pray to God every day of your life, no matter how much you think it doesn't help, believe me, it does. Next I want you to see a school counselor and ask your mom for her to please send you to a therapist. Try to be brave and please please please don't commit suicide. Even though I don't know you, I love you. I will pray for you tonight and every one who reads this please pray for her too.|`|ZuhvDanxaa	Hi There,    It is really hard when you love someone and he doesn't love you in return.  More so when he is just using you.  Nobody will ever know how you feel unless they have been there themselves. I know how you feel because I have been there.  I cry almost every minute.  It feels like it's the end of the world.  I did not know what to do.  I'm here in a strange country, very far away from my family, all alone with no friends to turn to.  I thought about killing myself too.  Because I'm hurting so badly that I thought it is the only way out.      But you know what, it isn't.  It took me a long time to realize this but I did. I prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed.  Learn to love yourself again.  Thinking about killing yourself is hating yourself for what happened to you.  But it's not your fault. You fell in love, you gave your all but it didn't have a happy ending.  It's okay, you'll fall in love again.  I did.  It took a while for me to fall in love again but I did.  And you know what?  This time it feels SO good.  So so much better than the first time.     I'm not going to tell you what to do but this I'm going to tell you,  you don't want to not experience falling in love the second time around. Get up, dash yourself off and give yourself a second chance.  Because if anybody deserves a second chance that would be you. There is someone out there waiting for you.  Your future is out there waiting.  I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.  GOD LOVES YOU.  Just keep on praying.  It's the best cure for everything.|`|XL5sB7PKaa	ok this guy that you liked, he is part of the reason why your depressed. you need to let him go. i tink the best thing first of all will be to write how you feel on paper, instead of trying to take it out on yourself physically. Ignore your mom, she evidently is too preocupied with her perfect life to care bout you, just let her go and take care of yourself, if you want to go to therapy get a job and communicate with people outside of your house, and save up the money to be able to go to therapy. And what you should do is go to hallmark and find a book called 1001 things to be thankful for, its funny trust. but save up whatever money you have. you should find your friends and go out one night just to see what happens and forget whats happened in the past and go towards the future and live in the present, just have fun. put on your best pair of clothes and go out with your friends one night. it might hurt to one time but it will all be worth it at the end.|`|xlvnryb3aa	your problem is that you can not see the sunshine through all those tears. Yes what that boy did was wrong and you were a very vulnerable girl at the age of twelve. esp that being your first bf. And your Mother is very lax in her responsibilities towards you. but nothing is going to change unless you make  changes. if you liked cheerleading then go back to it. Quit skipping out on all the fun stuff !!!!!   JUST KEEP IN MIND that there are a lot of guys out there like your first bf. And a lot who are not. You just have to know the difference.Make some girlfriends they can help you with that but do not trust them to much because they can turn on you as well, The Best part is is that your a girl, and the power is all yours. You can break up with guys without even a real excuse, whereas a guy has to try to find one first.  If you were a Cheerleader well then you must be pretty. They do not let just anybody be a cheerleader.  Look at it this way,a bad relationship is like falling down, it hurts but you pick yourself up and dust yourself off because no one does that for you.     Don't wear your heart on your sleeve, and don't be so free to give your heart away so easily,Some of us guys are JERKS and you have to make us work for it. Sports nah makes you to tired, volunteering nah that just gets you in trouble never know what you maybe volunteering for. TALKING TO JESUS; well thats ok, if you like long lenghty conversations that are one sided.Praying is better that way you can ask for some really cool stuff that you might not get anyway.  Now if this has put a smile on your face, even just a little one then maybe tomorow you might see a little sunshine or hear a bird sing.Sometimes; all it takes is something small to make you feel a whole lot better.Oh ya one more thing no more crying in books, the pages get all wet, and then hows anyone else going to read it.Takes a long time to dry a book but it only takes a kleenex to dry your eyes.Hopefully this has made you feel a little happier...|`|3c25a1e6de0b47dcd74094146835a69daa	Apologize for my inconsistent form of writing however my objective is to set you free.    Concretely try and understand this first. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. DO NOT feel ashamed or guilty in the way you feel.  At your age now, you have a real human and non-superficial quality in the way you've expressed yourself. You are lucky insofar as you are way ahead of the game compared to other people at your age.  But no matter what age anyone is, we all make mistakes.  However resorting to suicide is merely a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Today I'm very grateful that when i was 11, my serious attempt at it failed. Have seriously contemplated again and again it many times since then but i'm ultimately so glad that i was never truly sincere in carrying that out. I realize you don't feel very free right now but i assure you that all will be fine in the end. I know how inexuberantly extreme and "serious" these teenage years can be. I was there, in the thick of it all. experienced so much pain and witnessed Too many games, so much petty drama, one person after another telling you who you are, and the so called  'establishment' (parents, school, politicians, TV, etc..) creating an image of whom you ought to be. It's all phony.  All of it. Yet very effective in parylizing the real you. In my teenage years, i always knew that there was something silly going on.  Understandably, perhaps it is pointless in venting to ur mother during these times.  And don't judge me here but maybe that 'perfect-ness' she's living might just be a 'perfect lie', if for no other reason than her eyes and ears cannot acknowledge her precious daughters' cry.   Talk to a teacher about this, preferably one who is good at teaching and in a clever way, makes their students laugh. These teachers tend to be the most direct in difficult times. The most important point is, be genuine in your account and remember there is no need to be afraid in letting the dams open. Be human and feel free to just LET GO. There are countless amounts of people out there, young and old that have gone through the same things as you.   It has always been like this.      Remember, the best thing about the past is, that its over. Love is unshakable and in this dense midst, it is only the ego that leaps.      Surround yourself with good pplz and come back down to earth safely.   Be well. Be patient.|`|1xDr6C8Kaa	pleaseeeee dnt worry hunnie :) xx  i have had many friends taken overdoses and even tried to hang thereself wen they have felt extremly depresed and low and the last couple of days i even felt suasidal myself with my own problems i am havng to face but believe me take each day as it comes and things wil start to get better ..get yourself out and talk about your problems and u wil soon realise that ur glad u didnt do anything stupid :) xxx|`|mKNaV9xJaa	1-800-SUICIDE     1-800-273-TALK  1-800-784-2433     1-800-273-8255       I have been in your shoes, take a walk and look at a sunset there is always so much to live for.

Start taking interest in your education. I had so much free time that i spent in bad just laying there picturing how to die that i started spending it on my studies and now i have an A- to A ish average. join clubs. i would drraw hideous pictures and right destoughting letters and stories. I joined drama (it let me channel my anger) . and i was definatlly against this at first but someone on my blog told me to and it helped. you wont believe that it will but give it a try. try making friends with the quieter kids because they turn out to be the most understanding of what weve gone to when the time comes to tell them. STOP  comparing your life to your mom or the popular girls at school. the truth is nobodies life is perfect. guess what for the first year of school here i was popular but still suicidal. my parents wouldnt stop fighting and my grampa was in the hospital. instead of drawing picture of how you plan on killing yourself draw the house you want to live in when your older, think of your dream job. once you have that dream job making tons of cash you can toss your old life goodbye, and say hello to a new one.|`|597c8f15fab088aa6aa168eace6808e7aa	My friend,   I am really sorry you are going through all of this.

I've been through some pretty tough things when I was a kid. Around 12 or so. So I know. I was suicidal. But I got out of it. You just need to find someone who cares about you. And honestly, I do not even know you, but I would love to listen.
mE0Xwa5vaa	It's unfortunate that you have to experience such circumstance. Talk to your husband. Go out to dinner, somewhere quiet and discuss with him your concerns. Do it calmly and not in a way that is accusing him of anything. Tell him of your attempts to get close to him and of your feelings being hurt when he acts like he doesn't know you when you are out. Ask him if there is something wrong and what you both can do to improve the relationship. Don't accuse him of cheating unless you have actual proof (like a phone bill with repetitious calls to a specific number). Just be gentle and tell him that you feel a little distanced from him and that you'd want things to get back to how they were before.    Wish you the best.|`|AA10747411	based on what you've said here, I'd say he's a jerk.  I'd get to the bottom of why he doesn't want to make love, why he is late home from work and why he acts like he doesn't know me when out in public.  Sounds fishy to me.  I'd be watching him real close!|`|iD4ejChZaa	yes. sounds like an affair. he's in love with another, he is clearly telling you, you need to address this issue and don't give up. when he's out with you he doesnt want it to look like you 2 are together, he is always aware she may be around. sorry -but this is my life of experience opinion.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Figure it out.  -C-O-M-M-U-N-I-C-A-T-E-|`|VygBNA0Waa	leave move on yes i think he is cheating you don't and shouldn't put up with him doing that to you   to make him realize what he has at home   you put make up on do your hair real nice and go out with out him or the children and let him stay home and look after the kids so he knows how it feels and when get home he says where have you been say out like he does to you  do on sunday morning before he wakes up and write a note saying im sorry forgot to tell you i had to go out this morning i love you xx xx  don't come on until 5pm   i hope this works  leave your mobile at home so you can say you forgot it leave it plugs   into the phone charger so that way it looks like you did forget it and he cant ring you so he will get really worried go to a friends place or familys|`|IqC0Ri2baa	Are you serious? This seems really messed up so its hard to believe. Sorry, I think you should seriously consider leaving. Good luck.|`|5FH5EibEaa	OH god been there... he is a cheater for sure... get out ASAP and stop trying to over analize it..|`|MyzkHJLraa	You need to tell him you want to sit down and have a long talk with him. Tell him you want him to be upfront and honest. Ask questions & demand him to tell you what is going on & why he is acting the way he is. Communication & trust are key ingredients for a good strong marriage.|`|KWk5Sfn8aa	tell him how you feel, no straight answer then go to counseling, then hire a lawyer and private eye. then take him to court|`|b26NgqOFaa	Likely.    But I don't claim to know the right thing to do in this situation.|`|ucVgUcDvaa	Somebody, I have been there and done that. He could be cheating. Or hes just a fool. How about both. What a waste of a life. I suggest if you feel no love from this dawg. Then speak to him about then cut your losses and move on. Use a professional in counseling not Y!A to figure out your next move. In my case it worked for us. Husband just felt to settled in and forgot how to be in a marriage. Do not wait like I did. And you feel like you have to settle. Mine turned out better than that, thank goodness,  but I give my husband all the credit for it.     These people who say "Yes he is cheating" Ask yourself, How would they know from such little info. And Why would you trust someone here. You do not know them. And they are not professionals. Some people are younger than your last hair dryer that answer here. They have no experience in such subjects, just take joy in hurting others. Honey, only your husbands knows whats going on with him. We are all individuals Email me if you want to talk!.|`|AA11785285	Of course he's cheating... how thick are you??????????    Buy a GPS, put it in his car and have him tracked.

But more than likely he has someone on the side.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	yes...sorry but it sounds like he is getting his needs met elsewhere. I would tell him that you know he is doing something deceitful, (and you know this in your gut...you are a woman..and we KNOW when we are being lied to) and if he is not truthful with you then you have to make a very painful and difficult decision..are you willing to live a lie with him or not? you may not get him to answer you truthfully and in that case you will made yourself insane because your soul knows the truth and it will gnaw at you until you listen to it. Be true to you..always.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Of course he's cheating and you should too.|`|L3hc9EOiaa	Take the hint, sounds like he has lost interest in you, have you changed? has his job become more demanding? is there something either of you has done that would make him loose interest? so much more info needed

Good for you for standing up for yourself.  Maybe you could talk to your guidance counselor at school about family therapy.  It sounds like you still want your dad in your life, but you and your mom and dad have issues that you need to work through together.  Hopefully your parents would be willing to consider counseling.|`|TlC3lxD8aa	I think you should go talk to ur best friend and vent, if he does things like this still, then u need to tell ur guidance counselor, or another authoritative figure you trust...also if ur christian or somewhat something like that, pray to god...I hope u feel better and ill pray 4 u...smile :D|`|nNYBhelGaa	wow you need to call someone about this he is abusing you|`|SC91Uwrhaa	call the cops the next time he does it.

7LtbetTFaa	I think the most likely thing is you are able to fill in the blanks with what you want to believe about the other person. Have you ever seen someone wearing sunglasses and you think they are really good looking but when the sunglasses come off the don't look as good as you thought. It is because we fill in the blanks with the best image that might belong there. I am not saying this is not a good guy but you don't have a good basis for saying that yet nor have you delved into the matters that are important to a good long term relationship. It is normal to desire a great relationship but be careful not to let that desire blind you to reality. Sit down and think seriously about what you need in a guy to make you happy for the rest of your life (not just some excitement for a few months and then try to find a guy that has those traits. As I say that doesn't necessarily preclude this guy, you just don't know yet.|`|fNgv2FeRaa	If you're a desperado yes!|`|e8aa8e418b72c63acc3e4ab908f8a79baa	Anything is possible|`|VjJJSvxnaa	it's possible. it wouldn't be a bad idea to really get to know them first, as your feelings may change!|`|cwXfF3SNaa	I've answered this question once, I'm not doing it again.|`|9TQrtSoiaa	sounds like a crush maybe it could be something serious if u tried|`|WA65IQ0kaa	Hey<br>  <br>  I think this happens to many people (me included). I believe that if you really feel stongly about this person then don't hesitate and do somthing about it! Ovbiously this kinda thing won't just happen overnight, unfortunatley it does take time. If he feels the same about you the best thing to do is to talk about your feeling, even online if this helps. Just talk about it let them know that you may like them and you might be surprised! When thats over you may think about organising a meet. Most of the time its better to take a good friend or two along for the first encounter just to help keep you at ease. Also get him to do the same. The key to it is to talk and listen to eachother. <br>  <br>  I hope i could be of help to you|`|7q4BVzvJaa	yeah i guess its possible but its probably not likely though unless you start talking about the guy u like or if he starts to talk about you . :)

You wanna move out and never see them again? Do so.|`|d08rkYlpaa	Well, first of all you are going to have to stop being shocked.   If you don't want this episode to become like a permanent scene running behind your eyeballs all day and night, you will have to get some perspective.  The fact that your dad is police means you probably won't be able to get legal help - they defend each other and they know the angles about domestic disagreements and the law. So you will have to find some other way to deal with it.  You might begin by dropping the idea that you have a right to judge them. Maybe you do and maybe you don't, but that doesn't actually matter - it just hurts you to try. Whatever you think deserves to happen to them, probably will not, so it only hurts you to keep wishing for it, and will make you crazy.  Look at it a different way, try to find something normal to hang on to. For example, she is 18, and 18 year olds have the right to have sex with anybody they want to - it's nobody else's business. If your mother is not there, then they are not hurting anybody. I know, you have this long list of reasons why its wrong - but that list isn't going to do you much good, so you might as well try to find good things to consider.|`|o1irBbeNaa	how old is she ?|`|b6dd766795b2323f7f9fcbc373494574aa	i would be like ok its time for me to move out and never talk to you again............        lol|`|cxKR99KIaa	ide never speak to him again
AA10944766	If it's just the 'once over' then you've probably got what they like - either nice body part eg hair eyes, smile, breast, ***, legs etc or wearing something they have a fetish for eg high heeled shoes, short skirt.    If he is making repeated secret glances at you he DEFINITELY fancies you! I'm guessing you're not so self conscious that you think he may be staring at you as you have a problem so you must have an inkling he likes you, and you wouldn't be so interested to know if you didn't lke him too...so if he is too shy to make a move why don't you chat him up? Have fun ;)|`|5dc6493b424c85096e22e1614be3c9daaa	it really all depends. she doesn't have to be hot to lbe ooked at|`|mGlJbDHtaa	they dont have to be attracted to you to appreciate some part of you. maybe your eyes are captivating or your smile, could be just a normal male and stare at your legs, boobs, butt, but if they secretly look at you alot, could be something in the air!!!

sblgM6ANaa	I have been there. If I were you I would bring it up when you two are just casually hanging out together. DON'T just be like "What are we?" Start off by saying something like "the past several months have been great and I like how things are going but I was just curious as to what exactly we are ... I don't want to scare you but I am just curious because I like how things are going and I do not want to get hurt or hurt you for that matter." If he is a jerk then he is not worth you time but if he talks to you about it and things go great then it was worth while! hopefully he is nice! cause if things have been going great for several months then obviously its going somewhere! Good luck!!!:)|`|FiCl71flaa	If you are seeing someone for several months, it means that you have a certain amount of communication.All of the issues can be resolved if you do the following: 1)you both sit down and have a conversation. 2) discuss all the issues that right now are unspoken such as do you love me,what do you want with me in a relationship,are you dating someone else, and saying to each other that you love each other,make it official, and build the best romantic relationship that you can.In the final analysis, everyone would have to speak and speak the truth .I hope this works for you the way you want it to work.I wish you the best.|`|tb0NMaooaa	just talk to him. tell him you want to know where we stand|`|dAOUmE2Xaa	yourrelationship.com/quiztakers|`|67f09cd66006674e278eeda3288a990faa	i think you should just ask. honestly, it's the easiest way, and if having a frank conversation about your relationship scares him then he is most certainly not ready for any type of commitment. figure out where you stand as well, and you can open the conversation that way so he doesn't feel put on the spot. but if all goes well, you would have also established a precedent of openness and honesty, which can only help your relationship be better and stronger in the future. good luck!|`|WFXh3lGnaa	WEll, if you've been dating him for a several months, Than you should be able to talk to him about anything wherever and whenever,  If you are that comfortable with him than go for it but if you get that vibe that he isnt ready to be commeted then just wait and see,   I wish you the best girrl!:)
e5k8Bsxpaa	The biggest and best piece of advice I can offer you: BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. And forgive yourself when you digress from your 'rules', if you end up having any.    2. Don't have strict rules! If you are craving something, first, think: am I hungry or thirsty? If so, eat or drink something healthy. If you are still craving it, then eat a small amount. i.e. One to two small cookies. And/or stop when you are SATISFIED, not full! Full is bad. Think of full as an overload. Satisfied is just enough. And when you get hungry again, eat again! ASAP. Eat smaller meals more frequently. Your body will adjust.    It is so psychological. I am 5'2 and lost 20 lbs by believing that I wasn't going to die if I ate less. I just believed for some reason that I needed the fat to stay or else my body would die. In truth, as long as we keep nourishing ourselves, our body doesn't need or want that extra fat.    3. Try to stay away from whipped cream, but again, do it if you are really craving it and can't get it off your mind. Diets are not about saying NO they're about saying YES. Or at least about saying yes more than no.     4. REDUCE YOUR PORTIONS!! So important. When you are full, STOP! Your body will get used to the new portion size over time. Your eyes also need to get used to the new portion size. Leave food if you are full.     See food as something to give you energy and nourishment only. Not as something to make you feel better. Taking a walk, talking to a friend, relaxing can make you feel better. Food will have very little impact and as you may know can make you feel worse.    Try to picture the food as it enters your stomach. Lettuce looks much better than a chocolate bar doesn't it?    Don't shy away from carbs, but definitely try to avoid WHITE carbs and choose multigrain/whole wheat. It will make you full and keep your nourished.    If you were thin when you were younger, try to think that you are supposed to look that way. Or picture you but thinner and think that that is how you are meant to look.     I am definitely in the camp of freedom to eat what you want when you want (but choosing healthier foods a lot more often). If you are looking for a 'food schedule' I am not a believer in that sort of thing. I believe we should restrict ourselves as little as possible.    Those are some pieces of how I reached my goal. Good luck to you and feel free to message me if you have q's!    I really don't recommend diet pills. Who knows what harm they can have on your body that hasn't been studied yet?|`|76nTvO4iaa	If you're planning to do that, get a dress with a corset back on it.  That style is the most forgiving about gaining or losing weight - you just let the laces out or pull them tighter.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	When is the wedding? My bridesmaids want to do the same. My wedding is in January 2010. The girls already bought their dresses but we didn't order them. The store said to come back six months before the wedding to do the measurements and they'll send it to the designer to make. So the girls have six months to lose all the weight they want. Plus, most brides-to-be get their dresses altered by a seamstress. You'll have to do at least two fittings before the wedding. It takes up to four months to get your dress from the designer after you order it, then 4-8 weeks for the alterations. Play with your timing. You'll have time, hopefully, I think.    Like everyone else, just exercise and diet. It'll be hard but well worth it! Either way, you'll look beautiful on your big day!|`|pwC0bEmHaa	go to gym and do some exercise at home don't eat toooo much meat or cheeese if u try this u will loose ur weight.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Wouldn't you rather enjoy your wedding and be a little bit pudgier than you'd like than die of a heart attack just before it? Those "unhealthy" ways can kill you or at least result in a lifetime of heart problems, digestive problems and blindness.|`|CaPZrWVWaa	First thing to do is cut out unnecessary food from your diet.    No more pop, cut back on juice, drink more water. Eat cereal and fruit for breakfast.     Cut down on your proportions, like eat half a sandwich and fruit, instead of a whole one with fries or chips.    Get a little more exercise, Walking more always helps.    Do the little things to make you healthier. Cutting out pop and fries will make you lose quickly. Easy way to drop a few pounds.|`|8kdjvWAxaa	i think you should hire a trainer or go to the gym. Exercise daily and eat healthy and stay away from the fried foods.|`|CAeU0qyZaa	isagenex* or something like that. it's a detox thing that i think sounds ridiculous but i understand your reasoning. and it does work, i know someone who lost 9 lbs in a week..but only 12 at the end of two.|`|sMUiGFPraa	it is never a good idea to crash diet. Get the size that fits you now and you can have it altered later when you have lost the weight in a healthy way. Proper diet and regular exercise is key.|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	I don't have any answers for you, but you are right to do this before you get your dress.  When I stood up for my sister's wedding, I went to the bridal store to get fitted for my bridesmaid's dress and while I was in the dressing room, I heard someone in another dressing room down the hall just sobbing and sobbing.  When the fitter came back to me, I asked her why that woman was crying and she said it was because she had lost a lot of weight between the time she ordered her dress and came in for her last fitting and her dress no longer fit her and her wedding was a week away.  She said there wasn't anything the bridal shop could do at that point and then mentioned that she saw that happen A LOT.|`|NdOwsxsqaa	ONLY EAT VEGGIES!!!  the pounds will jus melt off thats what im doing haha  it's not healthy but then when you start to eat healthy add a little bit of meat durning dinner! good luck!! and CONGRADULATIONS on you're wedding!|`|705abedec0fba2815cbcf3249a8471ceaa	Not that it is fun but you can loose about 10lbs of water wt with the Hollywood diet, you can find it near the diet pills and slimfast. Its a drink.|`|pWArTam4aa	OK, may I say something in total honesty here?  Bad plan!!    You do not "lose a few pounds the unhealthy way" then lose weight 'the healthy way'!  It doesn't work like that - you lose weight in a healthy, normal, safe way or not at all.    And for most all people, when you crash diet and try not to eat at all, you actually don't lose too much weight, if any at all.  You may even gain weight... it's a strange concept that has to do with water retention and I'm not sure I even fully understand it.  But in addition to being unhealthy, this method is ineffective.  Don't do it!    Lose the weight in a safe way - drop a few pounds to fit into that perfect dress and tone up so you look fit and fab for your big day.  There are plenty of workouts designed for bride-to-be's just like you.  If your dress is a strapless beauty, tone your arms and have a set of awe-worthy shoulders.  Backless?  Tone your abs and sides (obliques, I think) and you'll rock that look.    Watch how many calories you eat per day (most of today's portions are way too large so when eating, use a smaller plate and eat in smaller quantities - you'll be surprised) and switch out 'white' carbs (bread, pasta, etc) for veggies and fruits.  Simply eating healthier (without the hassle of counting carbs or eating the dreaded 'diet food') will give you amazing results!    Exercise whenever possible and just be conscientious.  Good luck and congrats on your wedding!  :)|`|xukz46NFaa	Just get the dress in what ever size you truely need now.  You will have another fitting a month before the actual wedding date-- So I would say after you get your dress in a size (for example only) size 12-- You can go and lose your 10, 15, 20lbs and then have them in a month or two fix the dress for the big day-- always leave ur dress so slightly loose (incase ur cramping that day) cuz trust me I have seen dresses just not fit right after fixing them cuz they were taken in too much... Just try the dress on 5 days before- in 5 days u will be good to go as long as it fits right then...  Good luck and congrats!!

I had a girlfriend of 8 months already, we were madly in love. She and I were so sad to part but I had a duty to God to fill. (i'm religious and so was she), after the 2nd month she kissed my brother, I forgave both of them and was convinced she was the one for me. 4 months after that she was raped. I believe she was. Although I was very sad for her I was not happy with the situation she put herself in. 2 months after THAT, (this was when I returned) she was so happy to see me and I her, I felt the spark we had in the beginning and I swore things would turn out well.<br>  <br>  One day I surprised her at her house to see that she was watching a movie with another guy and there I sat on her porch seeing her with 2 empty mugs she was getting her and her date drinks... I felt very confused??? I found out that after she was raped, superman came to her rescue, she told me she didn't love me anymore and broke it off and they got married 3 months later. I was soooo depressed.<br>  <br>  I lived everyday much like you describe. What I did and had to do was hard but it was the only way I coped. At first I would drown myself in a virtual reality behind my computer screen from the moment I woke up until the moment I would pass out. I didn't deal with it for a long while. I then decided to burn all photos, all pictures on the computer, all e-mails, EVERYTHING, all connections I had with her I got rid of... I couldn't believe it was happening it was all such a nightmare. I prayed for help a lot because I knew I couldn't do this alone. I asked God to help me let go of her because it was literally painful every day.<br>  <br>  After 1 year and a half I was finally able to date again without wishing the girl I was with was my ex!

aXOyK3uBaa	The only kind of person who has a "problem" with women who are "EASY"  . . . . .  are OTHER girls who believe it's "good" to be "difficult".    "NICE" & "SWEET" girls are not as "nice" and "sweet" as they pretend. You actually believe you are BETTER than other girls who guys REALLY ENJOY being around.      That's not something anyone would call "nice".    Think about it.    But if you REALLY want to know what men prefer.  We like BAD girls . .  . . who know how to BEHAVE "nice".    That's why -->> niether "bad girls" nor "good girls" know how to keep men interested in them for very long. Because like you - they believe they have to be EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER. Men really enjoy the best of BOTH worlds.|`|sDSOqtQeaa	(: haha.|`|B3Cd58ehaa	personely I like the nice ones|`|feUMAvgLaa	Good|`|A2u06IS1aa	Imma girl, but i think the only reason why the guys go after the easy girls is because they like > Its kinda obvious, and its their hormones(: And becuase usually, the sweet girls dont wanna do ne of those bad stuffies(: Hope that helped!|`|kWjy7uzAaa	the phrase good/bad girl good/bad guy is so idiotic I cant even begin!

Seems like the bad girls get all the dudes when you are in high school.    But when we are grown up we go for the good, nice, sweet, good girls.

So to answer you question, yes at school the bad girls get attention, but in 5 years no one will pay attention to them.|`|F4rD4HF0aa	guys go for the bad girls cause they think they are easy and don't go for the good girls tell there ready to have a serious relationship|`|HCvNfdqwaa	good girls cuz theyre sweet and not easy like those tr@mps|`|EfhXEAbHaa	it depends on the guy|`|WFXh3lGnaa	Imma girl:) But personaly,  i know that every guy likes A good and a bad girl,  One that will take chances and Some that can say no...  ..HAHA|`|OwmzoPuHaa	i like the good girls|`|9iWqc5CNaa	depends on the guy..if bad girls are preferred,then it's all because they're easier to get laid or have a 'good' time with.in high school,most guys are not exactly looking for a nice,real,long-term relationship.don't worry,there are still guys who are worth your time, those that really prefer good girls.|`|nbUIs70Yaa	Sorry, I'm not a guy, but honestly, I think that when you're younger, the guys tend to go for the bad girls who have an attitude/give easy, but I think when you get older, you see more people finally getting a little bit more serious and actually become attracted to people who are similar to them, but at the same time, opposite. Like a bad boy in high school will probably go for a bad girl, but when he gets older (sometimes, not all the time), he might go for a girl who has attitude, but is a "good girl" in comparison to him, and vice versa.     I think the bad girls all get chased after because they get the most noticed and are the most intriguing.|`|o1vXdBIxaa	Well good because you know they wont dump  you the next day  bad because you can go further with them|`|AA11119393	i know that's always how it seems like, but i love nice, sweet and down to earth girls with no drama.|`|71f2930ee535098af1f6581cea1d859faa	You should just be yourself around guys  if they dont like you for you them they dont deserve you|`|HVOBuYYtaa	i like them in between, if you get a nice girl, you want her to be slightly bad also,    the reason all the easy girls are getting laid... is because there easy and there tryin to get ther dik wet lol|`|8Z1KkIWcaa	depends on the guy  the flirts like good girls (easy to play)  the funnys (like a girl thats like hanging with the boys expect pretty with nice taste lolz)  bad boys like good girls and bad ones|`|mGlJbDHtaa	Hey Kali, whats going on? nahhhh, to be honest, the bad girls for most guys are all short term flings, when were in school, the easy ones are what most guys will go for because at the end of the day they were easy, but they never last. The good guys get the bad girls and the good girls get the bad guys, there are only a few that get snapped up really early in school, but looking at some of my older friends they met their perfect match later on in life. Bad girls are just for school, the good girls are for life. I honestly prefer a good girl, why would you waste your time with a bad girl who will treat you like a dog. At least if your romantic and cool, the good girl would appreciate it more than a bad girl...
BKr3y30maa	I'm not a guy but I have my boyfriend right here and I asked him your question.  He said that some guys do like you to compete for their attention by trying to lay moves on them and stuff like that. Plus it helps feed their egos.  But it's like he just said, do you really want to be with a guy that plays games like that?  You shouldn't have to go all out to get a guy.  He should geniunely want to choose you....you shouldn't have to compete for him and his affections.  Good luck. Hope this helps.|`|fOzSL7tIaa	Your Just freaking out. its life dont worry about it cuz itll drive him away. Just suck him
VzXSC8fiaa	First you need to focus on what you DO have. <br>  <br>  Second you are not alone, your closest friends are inviting you to their wedding, obviously that means they want you and care about you. If you have friends and family, then you don't know the meaning of the word lonely. You have multiple relationships as it is.<br>  <br>  Third obviously the timing isn't right. You never want to jump into a marriage just because your lonely, because that is a recipe for disaster. <br>  <br>  Lastly, you had a serious relationship, you can easily have another one. Learn what didn't make the previous relationship and apply that to your future ones. Get married and involved with someone because you love them, not because you don't want to "feel" alone. <br>  <br>  Remember these are your close friends whom you love, you don't need to be jealous of them, because eventually you will get yours and you will never want anything more. ^_^|`|PQwRl27Jaa	hi dont feel bad n getmarried for wrong reason im single if u wnt we can hook up n mabe get married 2.|`|JizwgEiYaa	medication|`|iLuc1xyAaa	Keep your chin up high!

That must be painful. I bet part of your "homesickness" could be brought on by your accident. Your emotions are probably all over the place and missing family and friends would be natural. Do you have Skype or a camera? That would be great, you could see everyone (as long as they get one too!) and maybe that would help alleviate lonliness. Good Luck!

SsGLm3Xvaa	Maybe you should casually mention to your dad that she made a facebook and it doesn't seem like she's married at all on her facebook.    Or you could talk to her about it - or send her a facebook message.  Ask why her maiden name is being used and why it doesn't say 'married'.    But don't accuse her of anything, because you really don't know what she's doing, so don't assume.    It does seem like a red flag.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Well..I would stay out of things and not stick your nose in it.  The relationship between them is their business and since she added you she knows you know what is going on....so I doubt it is anything serious or mischievous.  Doesn't sound honest...but I don't know what her intentions are and neither do you.  Maybe she is looking for old school mates that might not know her maiden name.  I know I have tried to find a couple and am lost.  I WISH they would add their maiden name.
AA11987900	Get over your fears and maybe try to group with him in class so you can start talking to him more in person instead of just through technology.|`|tmnCbCqcaa	So the text flirting didn't help at all?  lol<br>  <br>  Anywhoo, he's prolly a little insecure about talking to you in front of his friends.  That does not mean he doesn't like you.  You might want to try getting to know one of his friends.  You can approach them individually and ask a question about a class or subject or something... just b.s., it should come natural, you're a teenager. That way the situation isn't too awkward if you walk up to the group and greet a few of the guys and not just him.  That should make you (and him) feel a little more comfortable since you've already met his buddies.  <br>  Good luck.|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	umm just face ur intimidation and fears =]|`|KeDIU7pkaa	I know that feeling, because it happens to guys as well! I get intimidated by a crowd of girls when I want to talk to one. However, there is a solution. <br>  <br>     Here's some of my knock-dead advice: use him to meet the other boys that surround him. <br>  <br>     Whether it be MSN or text, ask him "Hey, <insert name here>  I was wondering... could you introduce me to those guys that you hang around with?"<br>  <br>     If he really is that sweet, he'll do it!<br>  <br>  P.S: Good luck!|`|cwXfF3SNaa	Welp, just go up to him, talk very slowly.   (Don't sound retarded, just don't be a Chatty Kathy either)  That sometimes brings people out of their shell.   I know it's what brings me outta my shell.   Also, don't interrupt him.   I'm willing to bet you a dollar on a dime that he's been interrupted his entire life, and he's just sick of it.   <br>  <br>  Either that or he's just shy and he doesn't really know how to talk to girls that he really likes.   If that's the case, start referring to him as "friend".  This will get him to thinking that you two are just friends, and that he can start opening up to you some.   <br>  <br>  *shrug*   Just a suggestion.
EAxjVxTEaa	I would have played it off and laughed at her. Then made a comment about her as if I liked what she said to see what she did. If she went on saying how she wanted to see it. Then I would have known for sure she wanted me and told the person who I was with about it. If they didn't believe me. Then wait and catch the mother in the act again and gets proof.

The polite thing would have been what you said and expected under  these circumstances, but don't take it too serious. At least this time.

TKNPveHDaa	First, you're going to get a lot of crap for asking this.  Ignore those people.<br>  <br>  Second, an open marriage can be successful if you have the following foundation.<br>  <br>  1.  Be married for over 10 years at least.  The couples that have problems with swinging and open relationships are the young ones who haven't established a solid foundation of trust and comfort.  They're the ones with jealousy and divorce issues.  The older couples, married for 20 years, in their 40s or older are the ones who can pull it off.<br>  <br>  Trying an open marriage could go either way.  It depends on how you deal with the stress and excitement of sexual relationships with others.  <br>  <br>  I would be comfortable in talking about the idea with my wife.  I would hope I'm trusting and comfortable enough to let her act, but it hasn't come up.  I doubt it ever will.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Open marriages don't work for most people. Actually, it only works out for a very small percentage of couple who try to go this route. <br>  In my opinion, why would anyone ever even consider getting married to someone if they still want to date and sleep with other people?|`|gspTDufpaa	It takes a very  strong understanding to be able to pull that off.<br>  It works for a lot of relationships.|`|FzFSzilmaa	mine did... we did it and stopped by mutual consent... no jealousy, no problems... :D|`|cyt7oh97aa	I've seen open relationships, but never seen an open marriage.  I personally couldn't do it.  But if both people have the right personality it could work.  I've heard of one couple, the wife was bisexual so the husband allowed her to be able to see other women so she could get those feelings out of the way and keep her happy.  If people have jealousy issues and are in an open relationship then they shouldn't be in an open relationship.|`|8ebYteQsaa	I only know one relationship like this and they seemed to work pretty well, and they were not jealous! They stayed together like 14 years and then finished, but I think they finished because of other reasons like compatibility and stuff.  I think it could work if you handle the crude truth from the beginning. I think it is also about personalities, I don't think I could handle it myself...|`|AA10420452	we know of couples that do and they get along great as for us well were alittle old fashion. now we also know of some it did not work .swinging and open marriage is 2 different things in my op ion.|`|zKtrWvA5aa	IMO if a couple wants an open marriage then something is seriously wrong in their marriage.<br>  An open marriage is just an excuse to get away with screwing other people.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Not really, we just delude ourselves into thinking so.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	marriages is like the road we must keep two way traffic give and take|`|4HoVVCenaa	Some do. Most don't. It takes very mature, healthy egos for it to work. I know several people who are "open" and who are happy and better for it. They tend to be older people who have had bad relationships in the past. And no, I would not ask anyone to do this who wasn't truly ready... It should be a totally mutial decision or it will not work. And interestingly, where it does work, the female gets more out of it over the long run.|`|bO2rzfISaa	This worked for my husband and me for almost 20 years. Neither of us are jealous.
91D2cLEraa	No...............My boyfriend now smokes weed i can tell on the phone but when his drunk i can never tell! if u think he is ask him if you can pick him up and make sure he doesn't drive.|`|AA11125475	Just ask him. Why wasn't it a good idea for him to drive... stuff like that... but what I do is just play along, like it doesn't matter...then he'll be more responsive to you in that area.|`|5fddee5d516dbf3609553f5f2f053062aa	I don't understand why young girls sell themselves short by engaging in a relationship with someone who is clearly going no where in life.  At your age, if you're going to have a boyfriend, be with someone who respects  themselves and doesn't put themselves or you in danger.  What if you were in the car with him while he's high.......and there's a car accident.  Think about your safetyl  Life is too short.
SsGLm3Xvaa	Okay, you deleted the history in the search bar.    You also need to delete the history in the actual history pane... when you go to 'Favorites', there's also a 'History' tab... you need to change the viewing of it (it should be right there) to 'view by site' or 'order visited today' and delete everything p()rn related.    That's probably how he found out.|`|mGHT30Jsaa	a password so they cant even get on to your computer|`|fbQ2q6FMaa	You have to erase the history, do something else then erase that and he won't be able to find out.|`|rH5x7NFcaa	I assume you are using Windows, make your own account and give it a password. That's what I used to do :P and empty your browser history and cache data when you finish, its in options under most web browsers or clear private data in Firefox....|`|k2wiYJAcaa	If they did find out, blame it on your brother.   If they know that he watches it and is fine with it, then it shouldnt be that big of a deal. Just look disgusted and suprised and say your brother was probably using your computer.
MX1shAbcaa	Just ignore him whenever he says something. Or really tell him that it is drastically bothering you mnake it clear that it is hurting your feelings, tell y our parents if you need to.  ~william
B0GsaV8saa	It's his fault for going  over his min.  But I know his mom didn't hurt  him, just wait for him to contact you.  Im pretty sure he's okay.
EPaYoJaiaa	It can actually be done several different ways. There's no way that's set it stone that you have to follow by. I waitress at a banquet facility so I'll give you the order in which we do things but remember, it can be done differently there's no rule book that says you absolutely must do it this way.    A. Ceremony-it varies on how long the ceremony is it can be as short as 15-20 minutes or as long as an hour. (possibly longer)  B. Reception:  1. Cocktail Hour- this is the first hour of the reception, if it's right after the ceremony it's used to entertain guests while the bride, groom, parents, and bridal party etc are taking pictures. There's an assortment of hors 'dourves and enough time for guests to get their placecards, find their table, get settled, and mingle.  2. Introductions- This is when bridal party and bride and groom make their grand entrance. Some couples will have the DJ also introduce the parents and sometimes grandparents of the bride/groom.  3. First dance- pretty self-explanatory  4. Toasts- also self-explanatory a religous couple may have their priest/minister/deacon/rabi etc. say a prayer before eating the meal  5. Dinner time-there are 2 types, a sit-down dinner or a buffet. A sit down generally has more than one course and they come right after another no real breaks in between unless something unforseen happened in the kitchen or something (which can happen of course) You all are each served your appetizers/dinner and portions are controlled by the chef. At a buffet we set out the food for you in chafing dishes and you serve yourselves, (bride and groom first of course for both of these) all the appetizers/dinners are out at the same time so you don't have to wait for the next course and portions are controlled by you.  6. Party time-once most everyone has finished dinner and the waitstaff has started to clear dinner plates the DJ will switch from 'dinner music' (classical soft type of music) to 'dance music' (the loud stuff lol) that's when the dancing starts. After dinner is cleared waitstaff should be going around with coffee/decaf/tea  7. Cake cutting- depending on how much time is left in the reception this can either be done 20-25 minutes after dinner is over or as long as an hour and a half after. It's up to you bride and groom (and something to discuss with the DJ as they will be making the anouncement to your guests when it's time to cut the cake) Once they've done their thing with the cake the waitstaff takes it into the kitchen then cuts the rest and serves to your guests.  8 and 9. While cake is being served is usually when the bouquet/garter toss and parent dances happen. Either could go first it's up to the bride and groom (again discuss with DJ as they will be making the anouncement)  10. Party till the end of the night.    I hope I helped a little bit and again I can't stress this enough it can be done in a different order.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	Please go to the library and look at some Bride magazines. Then talk with some people who have been to weddings. There are so many ways to do it!
nv0nIj3Daa	its embarrassing|`|HGIuXxnRaa	It comes down to fear. They don't want to get their boyfriends in trouble. If they get into trouble, this may mean more abuse and with a greater severity. It also has to do with insecurities. Some people hate themselves so much, that they think they deserve it, or they are scared to lose someone because they dont think they can find anyone else.|`|BzYbEa6Taa	I will not speak for every one but people that are abused claim that they are not because in their mind they arnt abused they believe they have done something to deserve the way he is treating them such as, " If only I had make his dinner on time."      Hard as it is to beleive some women become dependant on the man and they dont really know how to leave it behind and get the help they need, so yes in a way they are in denial and yes they want to protect teh guy because "no ne will love me like he does" is the mind set.|`|JgKosPJpaa	both.|`|AA12290249	they are probably afraid to get hurt, protecting their boyfriends cause they think they love them, are afraid to have to find another boyfriend and just take what they think they can get (when they can do so much better.) they could be in denial too, thinking their boyfriend won't do it again, that they can change him or that he will change because he 'loves' them    it's kind of the same thing with abused children, why don't they tell someone?|`|czB9nABWaa	both, they mainly want either no attention or they are protecting one another. they also probably want to handle it them selves  probably not going to work out well|`|GkqTIGVqaa	stockholm syndrome of course|`|M1UiYHi5aa	they are in love with the guy usually and a lot of the time if the guy hears her saying it she will get it worst|`|0mamF6jxaa	both. they are probably embarrassed too. it's very traumatic|`|nm3f8HVRaa	It's kind of both. They're know that they will lose him entirely. and generally, guys like that, although they abuse their girlfriends, also have a sweet side, and most girls don't want to lose that. Sometimes it's also because they're protecting themselves. They're worried that their boyfriend will find out that they told and then hurt them more. It's just a bad situation all around. They usually aren't entirely in denial, just mostly. They don't realize how bad it really is.|`|s685etpbaa	because they r afraid to get hurt worse or killed kidnapped bad bad much worse things rape scary things except me i wil kick some as* and they r afraid of what will happen to there new partner|`|5YEKmHqyaa	In denial definately because they don't wanna believe that the guy they love would do something like that.  Also, they might be scared to leave because they feel like no one else will love them.  Most people that get abused have really low self esteem and guys feed off of that because they know they can control them and the girl wont leave.|`|FztJJ2fPaa	Girls don't want to admit that they are in a horrible relationship and they try to cover it up with lies. So even if they absolutely hate they're boyfriend or husband it's usually hard to get them to admit it. also they may be afraid of they're boyfriend or husband and they might be to scared to tell anyone. :D|`|29360f739fd46229348227a5ac6fbedfaa	Because they are embarrassed & ashamed. You have no idea how it feels or what it's like until you have walked in her shoes yourself.
60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	i think u r a pretty beautiful girl,still a virgin congrats.<br>  he is for sex only,ignore him.find another man and surrender ur virginity to him ,when u r sure that he will give u happy life.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	i applaud you for standing up to him, most girls just give in just to shut the guy up. some guys just don't understand the word 'NO'.<br>  <br>  the answer is obviously easy. hes trying to make you jealous. calling YOU and telling you to look up some girl? i'm sure he has a computer or other friends. hes just trying to get you to like him so you wont let another girl get in his way.<br>  <br>  here is what i would do. just play along. you are now aware of his game, just play along. and if look up the girl and her photo comes up and he goes "yea shes hot." just reply "so what does this have to do with me?" or just agree with him, that the girl is attractive.|`|1a528d2870eb7875be6fd0e16f069929aa	Most guy don't really understand what part is no, when girl keep saying no then why guy keep asking the same thing over and over. Maybe you can ignore his call when he keep calling you back over and over.|`|AA10958492	Wow, it seems that this guy is stopping at nothing to make you jealous and come crawling back to him. My advice, do not fall for his trap. By the way you described him, he seems sleezy. Why don't you let him know that you are going to seperate yourself from him and would appreciate if he does not have contact with you. Good Luck!|`|IWiAm8IMaa	he is just trying to make you jealous <br>  so that you go running to him and give him you re virginity <br>  dont fall for it|`|AA11683605	No one but a psychiatrist could nail down what the dude's issues are...but IMO, I'd say he's got a cruel streak a mile wide.  He shows signs of passive agression on top of it all.  If he were 15 yrs old I might understand the cruel immaturity of it, but at age 20 or 21?!?!!?<br>  <br>  Hun, count your lucky stars that you found out before you either gave up your virginity to him...or worse...married him.<br>  <br>  My advice.....tell him to stop contacting you IMMEDIATELY...don't discuss your reasons. If he does try contacting you again and upsetting you threaten the police (and follow through if you have to). Cut him off, hold you head up and move on with you life.  You DESERVE a kind, faithful and loving partner.  This guy is NOT that.  Run....don't walk away.  You're wasting you precious time even letting him drift into your head space for even 1 minute!  Luck! :)|`|8ebYteQsaa	Gee, I think he is a bad looser. Just ignore him, he is just trying to brag that he has a lot of gfs and that you are missing a lot of "good stuff".  Stick to your values and you'll never be deceived... and girl... all men are after sex, the good, the bad, the christian, the jewish, the straight, the gay... that's just the way they are.|`|Sji79Ipxaa	Hes a man whore. stay away from him,ignore him
AA10378030	Coming from a smoker....ME I used to bring Altoids with me, and every time I would be on the way home after my ciggy, I would pop one of those in and use a little spray of body spray.. Worked all the time. If he said he can smell in ON me, I would tell him 'so and so's" mom or whoever was smoking around me. Good luck. ?|`|43D89edDaa	Hmmm what is better<br>  <br>  living at home with a parent who is proud of you for not smoking<br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  killing yourself slowly with cancer sticks just so you can THINK you look cool and become dependent on something that is going to only take your money and make you smell.<br>  <br>  Hard decision??? not at all... stop smoking kid. Your not cool by it, and its gross.|`|uQHHVI8Zaa	DEWDD, STOP SMOKING !!!<br>  <br>  its gross, gonna kill yourself, smell bad yellow teeth/fingernails, and ur totally blowing ur money...... and u take away like 40 YEARS of ur life if u keep smoking.....|`|IzsGakLRaa	Quit smoking would be a start..OR bring some of that body spray along with you before you go home.|`|fe18eb610ca43e8d49ebafca28790fe9aa	Stop smoking.

I am not that close with her anyhow.  unfortunately she drives me crazy.|`|d5sAojVmaa	Well I think it all depends on how close you are to his mother.

I never felt comfortable wit calling anyone else mom or mother, etc. I already have a wonderful mother. I just don't feel right about using that title for anyone else. I do have a wonderful MIL, that's not an issue at all.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	I called my ex-wifes mom by her first name, but it took 4 years of marriage for her to even acknowledge me or ask me over to her house when we would go back to visit family|`|qsLhVZd8aa	First name.|`|GvamTVqAaa	I call her by her first name or 'Nana' if my 3 yr old is around because that's what he calls her.
YyUCDprVaa	duh he likes u! just be patient, ur time will come when he asks u out|`|xthO2EiCaa	It's kinda weird....because he shouldn't make you WAIT to be asked out.  But he better actually take you somewhere lol.  In my school when someone says"wanna go out" they dont take you anywhere cuz they cant drive!! It's real stupid.  So every time a guy does that I say where are we going? And the ge all embarressed...ANYWAY, back to the question: some guys are just like that.  I have a boy who does that but he's just being nice.  But most guys don't say Good morning sunshine to girls they dont like...But theres always those "just REAL nice" guy exceptions.  Classify if he does it to everyone and you've got your answer!|`|o1irBbeNaa	have you guys met before?
AA11894640	I think all relationships demand that!  You can't just neglect or leave things to chance...you've got to work your way.  You have to take care of their feelings...and that in itself is some 'work'!  <br>  <br>  Otherwise,  your attitude could be misconstrued as indifferent!|`|fmHyfVmVaa	No. I have found that when I seek to Love I don't feel unloved. <br>  For many years I sought to be Loved & accepted. When I stopped seeking & focused on Loving & accepting I discovered what I had sought found me.<br>  Blessings!|`|UofhMpy9aa	love is a blessing and a responsibility<br>  ...it is free, but it has to be deserved.|`|4GCH1lTyaa	nope..i had love (i thought) once..i got stabbed in the back...no more..love is a false front for taking a person for what ever they want|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I think so. <br>  <br>  If you bottle up all the love you have FOR others, then they will probably keep their distance from you.  You have to work at feeling comfortable showing love and receiving love.  If you push away love, you will get none.|`|y3xu4wxUaa	yes, you can not expect people to love you right away, you have to be kind and funny, open and not judgmental, and have good hygiene!!! :)|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	Love is not dependent on your actions. <br>  <br>  But you have to work at relationships - love alone is not enough.|`|Ccp9bZLEaa	not always. some types of love are unconditional (e.g. parent to child).|`|QRWqplREaa	yea i guess i cud say that, im always doing things for pple.|`|rw3s2Au5aa	How true.|`|yuuvBSKsaa	Love is considering the self interest of another as though it were your own.<br>  <br>  Now there are some tragic individuals who think unconditional love is a good idea.<br>  <br>  But in general love requires a quid pro quo.  Something you do or give endears you to the person who loves you.   <br>  <br>  Conversely we do not typically love for no reason, the objects of our love have typically 'done' something to attract our love.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Well...  it sure does seem like it anymore.  Love is supposed to be a gift, "just because", given freely, without conditions. Anymore, people mistake Infactuation for Love. Or they use the term so lightly... <br>  <br>  I do believe that when you fall in love with yourself and understand who you are, giving love to someone will come naturally. And if they cannot receive it with honor, then they do not love their self enough to understand what exactly Love is.......... After you've given them this love & it is not returned, it will not hurt you, because you gave a gift without conditions.
WDs4fRoxaa	Your horoscope will not make him stop leeching off of you.    You need to stop worrying about astrology, and start worrying  about facing the problems head on.    1. He leeches...you tell him he needs to be self-sufficient or  get out.    2. He is insecure...you tell him he needs to get over it, get help,  or leave. You will no longer be accused without reason.    3. If he is not going to marry you...you need to end it and move on.    Seven years is enough time to devote to a man who contributes  more trouble than love in a relationship.    Best wishes|`|At7WLduQaa	women and men dont get along when they are together for a long period of time, I was in the same boat where i couldnt stand the girl i was with|`|encb0jc2aa	cuckold him|`|wnoGTIzuaa	Try doing it back to him, and explain you are demonstrating how annoying and insulting it is.

And that is insulting|`|p5YEzLxeaa	I say if your getting blamed for cheating all the time you mise well do it Id rather get yelled at something that i did then for something i didnt, and plus you dont want him to be a Liar!  =D|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	yeesh. i cant believe people let such little things ruin the sad little lives they build together. epsecially when kids are involved.     Why dont people ever just sit down and work it out until its completely worked out?    Probably because it means they too have to change a little.    Being in a relationship is hard work, it never just comes naturally.     Wanna know why he's so clingy? Because he knows he's not good enough for you and he's waiting for you to act on it so he can confirm to himself how much of a failure he is in your eyes, and then go off and ruin his life further by leaving or being mean and distant or even aggressive. I mean, if you cant even see yourself with anyone, let alone him, for the rest of forever, or in any sort of really committed relationship, how else is he going to feel? He made two kids with you, and stuck it out for 7 years...     Its hard work being together, its like that with anyone. My husband and I fought like hell the first three years we were together. Until I realized that if I believed he was good enough he would figure it out.    Short of him being a naturally mean and agressive person who's abusive, he's not going to let you down if you honestly change your thoughts and concepts of who and what he is to you and your family. If he were that abusive awful type of person you wouldnt have been stupid enough to have two children with him and stick around for 7 years. So why not give him the benefit of the doubt and see if a few months of it doesnt change his outlook. There must be a vast majority of good in him, or you wouldnt be this far into it.|`|gpBicBEPaa	Oh geez, you got a lotta problems hun...|`|iEQWgoDcaa	stop seeing him|`|79b265d392525b206ff870687ec9a303aa	The question becomes why is he so insecure.  Only two real reasons for it, someone has done it to him in the past, or he has doe it to you and projecting his own guilt.  I would have a long talk.  And if he isn't the one, maybe it's time to save the both of you some headache and start looking around.|`|sZhjGs51aa	well if he never gets out  of the house then he might get  mad cause he stays there with the children  instead of going with you as a family  so he might think your cheating on him.  so now since he gets mad make him  go to the   store for you then do the  same thing he did to you ask him so do you like me   accusing you.|`|zNfD17Voaa	ok!    it seems by reading your question, you already know the answer to this question... walk away!    i know its scary especially when you have two children and you've been in a seriously long relationship. in this circumstance you really need to look at your options and how they are going to affect you and your children. the thing is if he's accusing you of cheating its showing his lack of trust in you...and if thats not hurtful enough its also a sign of disrespect. he needs to gain more trust as well as more self esteem for himself.     when i say walk away, i dont mean completely break up with him, this is the father of your children, but maybe take an extended break from him, where you see less and you have more time with yourself and children without his negativity. it also gives both of you time to reasses you're relationship and situation.    Good luck :)
TJrRPIFLaa	I would probably try to talk some sense into the father - either she should do it or someone else who can talk to him like that.  He should understand that it's her special day.  I also think it's sad that the bride's parents don't approve of her choice for the MOH.  That is a very personal decision for the bride and everyone should respect it.  Also, this is not her father's opportunity to show off to everyone - it's a ceremony marking the unity of two people in love.  I really hope someone can talk to the parents and get them to understand.  Ultimately, this is about what the bride and groom want.  But breaking up a family is hard to fix.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that if I told my family to jump off a bridge for my wedding, they'd do it.  They are very accomodating.  I am lucky.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Well, she needs to decide what kind of wedding she wants, especially when she is paying for it.  Let him boycott it if he wants.  He is trying to control them.  He is the one ruining his relationship with his daughter, son in law, and their future children, if he does this.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	Her father should offer to pay for all the additional guests <br>  <br>  If not, let him walk out.  A good father would not issue an unfair and childish ultimatum like the one you outlined.<br>  <br>  Also, the MOH is always the bride's choice.|`|AdoY6wKZaa	How very childish of him to embarrass his daughter by walking out of the wedding. Tell him that there is no sense in him bothering to attend.  Advise that she and her husband-to-be continue with the wedding. Don't let old customs interfere.|`|oojO4WAraa	Screw the father and his bad attitude.  The bride should elope and leave them all out.|`|1xggHtgXaa	Something sort of like this happened to me when I got married. I had just graduated college and my husband was still in college when we got married, and we paid for everything ourselves, to obviously money was tight. We saved and scraped and scrabbled for two and a half years planning our wedding so we could have a beautiful ceremony and reception that was still within our budget, and then 3 months before the wedding when we are finalizing our guest list, my Dad (who lived in a different state and wasn't very close to me - my stepdad walked me down the aisle) said his family wanted to come. Welllll... my dad has 9 brothers and sisters, plus their families. We only had 45 guests planned for the wedding! SO... I figured out exactly how much extra it would cost for the extra guests (which luckily only ended up being 7 additional people) and told my dad that if he wanted them to come, he had to pay the difference (which only ended up being about $150 luckily, because of the size of our wedding). Also, I didn't really trust my dad to give me the money, so I made him give it to me BEFORE the invitations went out. Sounds bad, but I didn't even KNOW these brothers and sisters of his who he wanted to invite. I mean, literally had never met them.<br>  Anyways, I don't know if that helps, but that's my story. Good luck!|`|LaFklYyzaa	wow! daddy needs to let go. he can't live his life through her and his possesive days are over now. his little girl has grown up and is making a new family and the day is hers. <br>  <br>  i had a blow out with my dad with him threatening not to come. i just sat him down and calmly told him "dad, i love this man and i'm going to marry him. we are paying for our wedding and we are doing what we can afford. i would like for you to be part of our day but if you refuse to accept that we are going to be making decisions for our big day then i'm sorry."<br>  <br>  it took him about a week and a half and then he was ok. needless to say, he was at my wedding!|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Honestly, if they're not happy to support her at this point in her life she's better off without them.  Tell her to tell daddy that she'd prefer it if he stayed for HER wedding, but she's not going to change her mind on the size.  If he wants to leave it's his choice,nobody's forcing him, and it's a decision he's going to have to live with that he wasn't willing to support his child on her wedding day.  Don't play into the drama.|`|ETymaT8zaa	dw the same sitch happened 2 my mate. Tell the Fther if he wants to walk out and miss the moment then let him. Its the best thing to choose|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	ask the father to give the budget|`|abrIJMYpaa	That's about the most immature thing I've ever heard! It's the COUPLE'S wedding, NOT her father's! What an ***! Especially when the couple are paying for it. If i were her, I would either have it the way I want it and let my "loving, caring, considerate" father walk out, or I'd elope and say to hell with all of them. If her father is that immature, he might consider making an *** of himself at the wedding and ruining it anyway.Poor girl. I think I'd elope.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I feel her father is acting childish...  A wedding is not about what "class" you are in...  It's about two people vowing their love for each other and commitment!!<br>  <br>  Wow...  If my father EVER threatened that, I'd be furious!!<br>  <br>  But, all that put aside, if they are from three different countries, are you sure they will attend?  <br>  <br>  Maybe put them on a "2nd Guest List", and whoever can't make it from the A-List, send an invite to those lost relatives....<br>  <br>  She needs to sit down and rationalize with her father...  In a mature way...  Maybe he can come down from his childish ways.......<br>  <br>  Bottom line:  It's her and her fiancee's day...  They should be able to do what they want...<br>  <br>  EDIT TO ADD:  As for the Mother being upset if she found out you are the MOH... That's b.s. too...  What is WRONG with these parents?|`|ft8t98Pnaa	Unless he plans to pay for a huge wedding like that and pay to fly all those people over... id tell him to kiss my asss... it is HER wedding... not her fathers.... he needs to grow up and realize that...... im sorry... I guess my dad wouldnt be at my wedding.. it would hurt me.. but thats his loss... if he walks out... not hers... and she shouldnt feel bad about it|`|AA12041870	That father has a lot of nerve.  The wedding day is for the bride, not his family.  If I were in her shoes, I'd elope with my intended and just cut them out of my life.  She is going to be miserable until her family understands that she doesn't live for them.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	She can say that she can't afford it and they are welcome to invite them if they pay for the expenses.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	He needs to get over himself fast. If he expects them to invite everyone on their tiny budget, then he needs to pay for everyone else who they can't afford. If he isn't paying, he has no say. If he chooses to walk out due to his selfish immature behavior, it will only reflect badly upon him.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Put up or shut up, Dad.  Either he agrees to pay for every extra relative that does show up, or she doesn't invite anyone more than she and her fiance can afford to pay for.  If her parents want to show off to the relatives, then they have to pay for it.  It's completely unreasonable of him to expect her to go into debt to fund his bragging rights, and extremely childish of him to threaten to boycott her wedding.  I'd call his bluff.  How impressed will the relatives be when they hear that he stood up his daughter on her big day over a temper tantrum?
blujrCISaa	How about looking for a part time job, sometimes there are more of those around and then you have maybe have two part time jobs, and in two different fields of interest so you can see which direction you like best. Maybe take some classes at the adult school like typing or office skills, or medical bill etc. Just some ideas off the top of my head.    How about volunteering? What do you like to do? Local animal shelters always need volunteers to walk the dogs. A reader at the library for the preschool kids for story time.    I have never heard of prednisone used for depression, but then again I am no expert in the medical field; but I will say go talk to a doctor before using any medication especially old meds.     Hope this gives you some ideas|`|zDeFibxzaa	keep your chin up,get off the meds,go volunteer at the hospital or do something for the kids or something,think about it !you are depressed for what?there is something that needs to be changed,you need to figure that out and go do something,find a job or volunteer,even if it dont pay nothing ,it will put it in your head that you are doing some good for someone.i used anti depressants for a yr but it never solved the problem,it will help,in your mind'' but you have to make some changes to ever get it to feel right,if you know what i mean,?and i think you do!!dont feel bad,its probably the pills anyway,so get off of em and get out and find something to ease your mind,ok.|`|AA11785285	You keep asking this same question, over and over and over, yet tell us in your avatar that you're as happy as a clam.

It sounds like you're doing what you can for now, so give yourself credit for that. Yes prednisone could cause depression, but instead of thinking about getting on anti depressants, see if the doctor can change the prednisone to something else. You  have to make the best of the situation and give yourself credit where credit is due.|`|zHwlGhIAaa	i know exactly how you feel.  I stayed home to take care of my son who was born prematurely but hes doing fine now and I so want to be a part of the working society again.

No depression pills are going to help, you're already putting a stamp on yourself that you're depressed. And honestly no man wants a woman who feels sorry for themselves. Men like strong but sweet women. Understand that future mother-in-laws want to make sure that their sons are marrying women who can handle pressure or tough times. Not that they haven't been through it but because they want to make sure that you can stand. I know what prednusone is and what it can do. But you have to pray and ask God for guidance and he'll give you the answer. Then again sometimes he wants us to be still. Because as people we're always running around too busy to listen to him!!!

I know a teenage dad who adopted his wifes little boy and he had two more with her and she left him and he took custody of all of them and he is 22 years old.  Good luck to you and your little family you can hold your head up high and be proud|`|5A7RmIH6aa	i agree. you get a pat on the back. 95% however,are on wefare.pregnant.unemployed etc.. why need to struggle in life with 2-3 jobs? that sucks. really. go back to school. get a career. its never too late.|`|29hcn9JRaa	Can you blame society for feeling this way? after all have you looked into the millions of dollars spent on welfare, housing, medical benefits for the poor,etc, and these are merely the financial aspects of the issues with teen parents, let's not forget the role that not being mature enough plays in this never ending battle. Please realize that you may be the exception to the rule, in other words, not many teen fathers take responsibility for their children, so of course society is upset, were tired of footing the bill for other people's child support. Having a child before you are ready is simply not being responsible you like so many other guys were not thinking about the consequences of your actions, so now you will have to pay for this for the next 18 years of your life, right now it is ok as your child is young, but just wait, as this is going to get really tough, but hang in their, and don't have any more babies, as you might be aware we have a failing economy that is not exactly strong, so things could get worse prior to getting better, so save your money.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	Sadly though, for every responsible teenage father there are about 100 irresponsible ones. <br>  <br>  Those who don't even know who their kids are, those who don't work and live in free hand outs, those who can't keep the damned thing in their pants and keep on having more... you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  It's unfair that you should be lumped in with all of the above, but sometimes that's what life is like.<br>  <br>  I am sure all the innocent hard working mulim men and women who get called terrorists also get a bit miffed too.|`|iZDsMCghaa	I dont look down on you or any teenage parent for that matter, at least not simply for being a teen. I was a mom at 21, that's 2 years older than you, I fell into the role and have been a wonderful parent, has my husband who was also 21 when baby #1 came. <br>  In fact, I have known two sets of teen parents, one couple was 16, the other 19 and in these two cases, the MOMS were the ones to take off and the dads cared for the babies.<br>  When you see or hear some ignorant bs, just pay no mind, you have your baby to put your concern into, you dont have t add idiots to the list.|`|Z2ayOQHFaa	My husband and I were also teen parents! They do this because they think or assume you are to imature to take care of a child we went threw the same thing ! Everyone thought we were on welfare and all that other crap!

It is time to move on with your three children.|`|vOUDHws3aa	If marriage is THAT important to you, for religious or other reasons, move on. The longer you wait, the harder it will be for you and the children.  If you are otherwise happy in your relationship aside from not being married, and it isn't a religious issue, you'd be a fool to leave the father of your children and someone you have no real problems with.  You could meet a loser tomorrow who would be willing to give you a ring and piece of paper and be even more unhappy than you are now because he wouldn't be the man you love.|`|ZtfN4J6taa	Why move on, it's only been 9 years !

If you were my daughter I would tell you to focus on only one thing, the financial impact of being married to him versus just living with him.  To do that you HAVE to talk to a lawyer to find out:  - What would happen financially / asset split etc if you left him now  - What will happen if you split in 10 years and are still not married  - Are there any ways for you to prepare yourself financially in the event that he leaves you at some future point and you have never married.      There is NO WAY I would suggest my daughters leave a situation like yours unless staying with the man leaves them very financially vulnerable.  If marriage will make a big difference in financial security for you then you have to try to figure out if it makes sense to move on or not.  But be realistic.  You have to try to figure out whether you think you have a decent shot at "marrying" someone else who will improve your situation.|`|e149d8651ec2a8062fd5aee0bdd23a16aa	Forget it.  Move on to what?

That should be your answer.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Dont be so Selfish|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If all 3 kids are his, I would stick together, instead of breaking up the family.  While marriage is ideal, its better for the kids to be raised by 2 loving parents (mom and dad) then to break up because he won't propose.

He told you he did not want to get married and you stayed which told him that you were okay with the arrangement that you both were in.  Now you are trying to change the arrangement that he is so use to after 9 years.  You should not listen to the people who are telling you to stay because of the kids.  If you feel that the relationship is not going the way you want it you should move on and find a man who wants the same things you want.  If you continue to stay he still will not change his mind about marrying you.  You already have your answer.  If you are okay with the way things are then stay but if not you should leave.|`|Lz3yxrXKaa	its time to move on girl and follow your dreams. don't wait in tell you are 30 or tomorrow. now.|`|NpcSEJX1aa	well which is more important the ring or the relationship and why wont he comment.is it because you already gave him what he would have in a marriage.only you and answer this question..do not stay just for the kids sake..stay also for yours and his.. only if you really want to..and if marriage is what you really want in life you just may need to leave|`|3ijLQe5laa	no ring/ no dream. why buy the cow when you got the milk. move on|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	little late to be figuring this out....but dont expect a proposal ever...decide if you are happier and healthier with him but without the marriage or without him altogether.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	It depends on how badly you want marriage. I'm sorry he won't marry you, especially after all these years and 3 kids, but I guess you knew that early on. I guess if nothing else you've learned that you can't change people. You have to weigh out how important the "paper" is to the relationship you've established. What will the paper do for you other than a feeling of security.? In some states you'd be common law husband and wife, so if security is what you're looking for, you may already have it. ( 7 yrs. is common law) If you have everything you need from him, love, respect.etc.  then you have what's important.

Hon, you have no choice.      You stay, you and he be the best parents on the planet to your children.      If you and he need counseling, get it....  but stay together in a loving, supporting relationship.    When they are grown, your life is again yours.  And you can bail.    And just as an obtw, no guy will take you on as  single mom with 3 kids, except for a booty call.... it just ain't gonna happen, ask any single mom out there.

Talk to him and let him know how you feel. Be real with him. If he still says no about the marriage then you can tell him that he is already married anyway by law all you want is the ceremony. Legally you guys are married. Its called common law. If you live together, have things together, then you are consider married. Just let him know that and think about the added bonus if you get it on paper. He get to claim you on taxes. Point out the pros of the marriage. You guys have already been living the pros and the cons. Also if he is a religious man. Then point out the religious aspects. By you guys not being married and having sex that's commenting adultery. If you really love him you would stay with him though. All in all you guys are already legally married and if you guys ever broke up and a battle came up ,the courts would say the same thing. You guys would split stuff and share the kids. Sounds to me like he is either scared or just a man who wants to know he is always free to do as he pleases because he is not tied down by a marriage. You are just "convient booty" He can come home do what he wants says he loves you and go out and do something else with someone else. Not saying he is doing that. I mean if his reservations about not being married are not based on fear of something then its based on selfishness and not being able to give up his bacholores ways.|`|6EIdLkS7aa	Where do you live? ( In some states, legally after 7 years of living together you are considered married)  I would move on. There is no reason for you to stay with him if he's never going to commit to you - the children will still have a mother and a father, who aren't married, still get to see both of their parents.. What would be the difference in their lives? Maybe a new 'parent' to love them in addition to the two they already have? No harm in that. I do agree that working it out is best however...but you CAN'T work it out unless he wants to as well.|`|k3obZ8Dqaa	see this is the problem with women..  We get fixable guys. we love to make someone better instead of getting a man that will make us better.   This is the reason im a firm believer on not living with someone til marriage. Because then you cohabitate and live as if your married but really theres no commitment and of course the guys like that. Some men are too immature and are never going to be ready for settling down. You knew that from the beginning but you decided to stay in a relationship and go further with it by having kids. I dont mean to be a ***** im just telling it blunty and the way that I see it...this situation would be better off if you guys were separated.     Because ya its going to be hard on the kids.. but it already is i bet tension is high on a day to day basis in that house. Plus your boys are seeing that there is no commitment needed..so when they get older they will do the same thing that daddy is doing.. just make kids and not become a man and marry his babies mommy. you are not setting a good example for your kids by staying in something like that. And you are not making yourself justice.. because you are staying there knowing that that man does not love you enough to marry you..     If you didnt have kids then i'd say leave him and go get yourself a man that will love you enough to marry you. not because that means he is trapped by you.. but because he loves you enough to commit himself to one person and that one person is the one he loves..    But seen as you have kids.. you should move and get your own place...and have them see daddy on the weekends. and you should in no way try and find a man..because now you are a mother and a mother puts their kids first and not their needs. so you will date if you want after your kids are 18 or out of the house.. because if you bring a man into your life then THAT will affect your kids.. because that will make them feel ignored and most kids that have mommys trying to find a daddy for them end up doing drugs and becoming rebelish! you do not want this to happen to your kids.     Hopefully you know what you need to do.. but better yet i hope you are strong enough to not give in to temptation and give your kids your sole attention and not let a man get in the way of that. Kids ae first..     Paola Zevallos
dQrBlk4qaa	You are only as happy as you make yourself, particularly in this situation.     If I were you, I'd do my damndest to find the things I like about my wife, focus on those, and start trying to do things to rekindle something between the two of you. Get a babysitter, and start going out with your wife places, and see if that does something for you.     If it doesn't, maybe the two of you should try some couple's counseling - maybe both of you need a little jump-start. Better that, then to give up all hope, man.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	You should never use your kids as a reason to stay some where you do not want to be.  You son maybe young now but if you stick it out as he gets older he will understand more than you think he will.  For you sake if you are not happy in the marriage you have 2 choices: 1) you can go to counseling and try to work it out that way or 2) you can just end the marriage.  Like you said you do not want to walk away from your son.  If the both of you can end the marriage on good terms you can still come and visit your son.  Remember that he will need you throughout his life, so even if you leave his mother do not leave him.  Maybe things are just getting boring.  So you should try to spice up the marriage.  I am not in your house so I do not know why you are not happy so talk to a counselor about your marriage and see if it can be saved before you just to divorce proceedings.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	You not only CHOSE to love your wife, you promised to love her forever. You know, in good times and in bad. You think marriage is about good feelings all the time? You have no idea what a marriage is then...     Go to couple's counseling if your commitment to your wife and son means anything at all to you. What are you gonna say to your son when he's older? "Yeah, I left you guys cause uh... well... I dunno really. Your mom didn't do anything wrong. I just got bored with her and left." People like you make me sick. Walking out without even putting up a fight, leaving your wife and child to fend for themselves because of your selfishness. Grow up. I'm married and 20 years old and I feel more mature than you.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Try to put the spark back into your marriage. A new baby can be a great strain on a relationship. If that doesn't work then move on.|`|0894be71d36fb087dd4d64f6446344d8aa	yeah  i would stay together, b/c it's for ur son and go on a date w/ ur wife and places u went together...     i mean u did put a ring on her fing finger for commitment for ever and every no matter what so just walking out on ur son and wife is a lame reason to divorce on...     u'll break her heart and  i mean ur son don't even remember u and how would it feel when ur son doen't know who u are?     and why is marriage miserable? wow men these days what a disgrace gonna leave a woman b/c he's not satisfied enough....     for ur son's sake live on plus when u get older u'll love each other more than u ever did b/c all those loving memories...|`|AAnlhsnGaa	Please go see a marriage counselor. You owe it to your son to at least try to make it work. But you can't do it without help. You may just have depression. That in itself can't be dealt with alone. With the proper medication you can have a whole new outlook on life. Just please don't let it slide. Get help. You will be glad you did.|`|wrs4kLReaa	you need to be honest to yourself and your wife as well.  By staying you will only cheat or start to resent her and the relationship. It's going to be hard but you have to do it, either way she is going to be hurt, but if you let it go on you will only hurt her worse.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Consider counseling. Remember even with divorce you do not have to abandon your son. You could have lots of visitation and pay child support etc. You have to weigh the price of personal happiness versus commitment. Marriage could be tough, I agree.|`|nsGBwXCTaa	I am married for the 2time .But I have to tell you I wolk out on the man I realy loved but he was doing stuff behind my back.He was a police and I was only 14teen and had his baby and he stay with me so he would not get in troble i did not no that then . But till this day that man I will always love tore my hart . But I left him because we could not get along and that is VERY BAD MEDS FOR ANYONES KIDS .I beg that you do not stay becues of you kid . You would wont him happy right . Do what is best for the kid . I did and my boy is very happy now|`|AA10789514	If you are not happy you allways could leave her and pay child support for the next 17 years.But if you do .dont become a dead beat father like 60% of all the other ones out .Something to think about eh.|`|by7H31Djaa	I would NEVER do what you're planning to do! You need to tell her because she will eventually find out and im sure she'll be more hurt to find out something like this after so long than by you simply telling her. My husband and i have been together for more than 3 years and we have already talked about not feeling that "spark" anymore more than twice. We talked about it, sad, but we would try to come up with solutions together. We now have a 15 month old son and just taking our son out to have a good time makes us a healthier family. It seems to me like you just don't feel much for her anymore BUT there are lots of things that can be done. Besides from you maybe being depressed for some reason or no reason at all. It can also be that you need more one on one time with her. Make plans to do something you both enjoy even if it's just going to a museum. Find a hobby and plan a family day or night at least once a month. We go out as a family at least once within 2 weeks and on average without our son every 2 months. To make it more simple, you just need to reconnect. Almost every night we, after our son is sleeping, we sit together and watch a favorite show we both enjoy. Or a movie at night at least once a week. Just cuddling on the couch makes me feel more closer and loved. Maybe you need more love.|`|Hizsm6m4aa	If you don't love your wife you are not doing her any favors by giving her half-*** love when someone out there could love her 100%. Do not blame your son for not having the courage to be honest. When you go to court you will get rights to him as a parent. In the end if your interest is low you will cheat on her. You may not think so, but it'll be easy. Then you may destroy them both. Do the right thing,your son is young it will affect him more later if you stay...you can only pretend for so long.|`|5ubxs8G4aa	There must be a reason you married your wife.  You were in love with her once.  I have a 13 month old daughter also and I know that having a child changes things.  I would recommend marriage counseling.  You dont have to be miserable.  You can work hard at making your marriage a happy one.  Marriage is not easy...thats for sure.  Sit down and make a list of all the things you love about your wife...sometimes we just need a little reminder =).  It sounds to me like you do not have a lot of BIG issues to work through...you just need a little reminder of why you fell in love in the first place.  You might think you want something else but the grass is always greener...and then when you get that grass you want different grass!|`|6EIdLkS7aa	It sounds like you might have commitment problems if you are wandering yet nothing has gone wrong.  Try going to a marriage counselor.  Forever is a long time, and you can go through many different ups and downs during forever!  Don't give up hope yet, you loved her once and you still do, love can't just disappear like that.   Sometimes it just takes some extra work to bring it to life again.  I'd suggest trying talking with her as well. Tell her you're having a hard time, whatever, (just don't say "I don't love you anymore")!|`|zDmGngXVaa	You can't suck it up and hide it forever! Your son may not be able to see you unhappy now but later he will! I do not believe you should be with someone just because you have a child/ren with them. If your not happy, how are you going to make your child/ren feel happy????  Have you ever thought of that?  You really only have 2 choices! If you really want to SAVE your relationship with her for the best of your child then you need to write down why your not happy with your wife and you need to tell her as well that your not happy because she may not be either..  Never know about anything unless you convey with your partner! Two people can't be together if one isn't happy just because of a child. Because you will be bringing your child/ren in the middle of that depression when they get older! Children can read you a lot easier then your own partner can once they start understanding things! You need to be happy, your wife needs to be happy and your child/ren need to be happy! If one of you are unhappy then something needs to be done! If the relationship is able to SAVE then do what you gotta do.  If it's not, then you need to find what will make you happy!  Good luck!|`|4tFuosueaa	Don't think you are doing your son any favors by staying. Kids can tell and eventually, if you aren't already, you will be fighting. Move on while you're young enough to start over. It would hurt me a lot more if I knew my husband was staying for all the wrong reasons. Give her a chance at finding someone who loves her back.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	get a Divorce and Move on

0BCu94DIaa	WOW... at first i wasnt to sure but i def thinks he likes u now! at first he might not have been 100% about it or just rele rele shy but he was def tryin to make u jealous by talking to other girls just cause he seen you talking to other guys...he only wanted revenge!! so i think u should talk to him.. dont bring up the past yet then if u talk more or feel more comfortable talk bou thow he feels and how u feel.|`|z2EPIm1Qaa	wow, it's a little creepy, the staring thing...  buut, if you like him then totally go for it!  good luck!|`|I9lwHvUgaa	So you have never spoke to him in 2 years?!?!?!  he sounds creepy.|`|1YaHn28Yaa	Hey Ashley!     He is Soooooo in love with you! That's what happened with my first boyfriend. he would look at me and smile all the time and his friends would always say hey james look who it is and he'd get all embarassed. one time i caught him staring at me so i went up to him and i was like what the hell is your problem you're always looking at me. and he told me he liked me and i was really flattered and he asked me out.      The reason he won't talk to you is because he's scared he'll say something stupid or embarrass himself. You should talk to him oneday to boost his confidence.    congrats boo! keep me posted!   xox Della
NO8NoirWaa	Maybe he trusts you because you did date. I mean just because he trust you doesn't mean he still likes you. I'm sorry to say. But I mean its good that he trusts you. For all I know, he might still like you, but I am just letting you know what I think.

Also have him read the community guidelines.
tkSzObmQaa	Actually, I believe you know the answer to this already.  Be careful.  You seem like a nice person and deserve better.  Don't settle for anything less.|`|0LEFco9xaa	He's blaming you for the things he falls short for in the relationship. My ex did that to me until the day I woke up and realized that it wasn't me it was him. He's got things to hide or some sort of bad habit. He's having a hard time facing the reality of his own situation and chooses to blame you for it. I think you need to be careful because it could turn ugly quickly if you decide to end it with him because to me it sounds like things are going to go nowhere fast. I don't think its a very good idea that you gave him all your passwords to everything. Keep a close eye on all your stuff. You need to really look at  your relationship with him you sound like a nice girl and he sounds like not such a great guy. From personal experience it probably won't get any better. If you do it will hurt for a while but you will be okay and there are plenty of other guys out there are better. Keep your head up. Hope that helps. Good luck.

FRE2gov3aa	I think a threesome is considered when all three people are having sex. Like girl and girl,both girls and guy.<br>  <br>  I don't think if someone watches that is considered one because they are not participating.<br>  <br>  And if the girl and girl are messing around and just feels up on the guy,I don't consider that either.<br>  <br>  Idk, those are just my thoughts.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	1st scenario:<br>  <br>  I would say it is not a threesome due to the fact nothing progresses beyond kissing.<br>  <br>  2nd Scenario<br>  <br>  It would be a variation of a threesome and it would depend on the role of the third person. If the third person was watching I would say it would be a soft-swing situation. Otherwise I would say it a threesome where one chose to watch instead of participating.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...I believe a threesome constitutes 3 very active people that are all actively having sex with one another...not just two really.<br>  The camera man or onlookers are not actively involved intimately...however they are voyeristically aiding the event...without creating physical contact....sound cool?

We're not chained to our past, our lives are not predetermined.<br>  <br>  So he messed up.  Lots of us do.  You probably have, too.  Did he learn from that mistake and do different?  Or is he persistently making the same kind of mistake over and over and over.  If he learned and is doing different, good for him.  If he's living the same day repeatedly then it's likely that your keeping him is actually contributing to the problem by sending the message that you'll put up with it.

AA10784932	first of all i love the date! Thats my birthday!   And I love the colors too! I dont know where you live but i'd go w/ a more of a winter theme! Lots of white snowflakes hanging form the ceiling at your reception! You can even make those snowflakes from paper where you cut out shapes or whatever!  You could use hot chocolate packages as your favors w/ green and blue ribbon on them!   How about blue table cloths, green napkins, white plates. You can go to www.theknot.com and they give you options to look through a bunch of pictures for blue weddings, green weddings, and winter too!

If you say he's "your guy" then it seems you like him enough to be with him, and if that's true, then you will either sex him soon or are planning to wait until marriage (rare, but admirable!).  Ask yourself what you're afraid of. Rejection? Being judged?  Then ask yourself what's the worst that could happen? He leaves?  Honestly, in my decades of dating, the ones who leave usually weren't worth keeping around anyway. My experience says go with your gut feeling and be honest. Accept the consequences and take it from there. Be brave!|`|kfM7ppWpaa	If you refuse to answer his question the you obviously are not a virgin.

kuefQuxiaa	This is really sad. I am sorry that you are going through this.     One thing you have got to understand, is that life is full of changes, and things don't always work out the way we want them to. Also, she may be missing you just as much as you are missing her. She may just be caught up in a new type of lifestyle, or with new surroundings and friends, that she is trying to fit in where she is at. You have to put yourself in her shoes.    On the other hand, I can really tell you miss her. Never quite "move on". Always keep a picture or old journal you both kept behind so you remember her. Try to contact her every chance you get. This happened with my old friend Annie, who I was practically sisters with in kindergarten and first grade. It may not seem like a long time, but she was my only friend. When she moved to Arizona, it sucked so bad. Thanks to myspace, I just found her this past year, and now we talk all the time. As long as you don't forget her, then when you get the chance to be close to her again, you will have a better chance of feeling that old awesome friendship again.    As for her mom changing, it's possible that the new "rich" boyfriend had a certain lifestyle also, and her mom fell into the way he was. She probably wanted your friend to get used to the change fast, too.    I'm sure she didn't start hating you, and your friend still misses you also. Just give things time, and remember her. Don't forget her, but don't let it bring you down from making new friends, and getting closer to others. It's totally possible to have more than one best friend.|`|ciQjwtTcaa	Just move on.  its for the best =]|`|MWg8RvlKaa	I have been in kind of the same situation as you. I fault the same way, my friends parents were so cool but then they stopped being so nice. I think her mom believes you were a bad influence on her and she thought it would be best to move away or your mother lost herself when she met the new rich boyfriend. Either way, as hard as it is, you gotta move on. I know it hurts inside a lot and its hard to get past, but i promise you will make it!|`|gAflmxDRaa	im so sorry. if you knew where she moved to, try the yellowpages. thats just about everything i got. srry. happy birthday anyway.|`|n4zATZ7Paa	Well first off, happy birthday!    But anyways, I think you need to contact her tomorrow? See how things are going. You know people can get really busy sometimes. I know I barely have anytime to talk to my friends except on the computer on my free time. After you contact her ask her to meet up somewhere and then from there on see if she still doesnt contact you. If she doesnt then you might suggest just leaving her alone and move on with life.|`|1L6h4YXiaa	i'm sorry to hear about that. *hugs* amd happy birthday as well!|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	She would have made an effort like you were doing..... so move on.  If she wants to be friends let her find you.|`|g4K0lHH0aa	It is sad for a best friend to move and for her/his mom or dad changes and becomes mean.but i would have to say let her go i know its hard but some times we have to do things we dont want to|`|jcKRTC2Aaa	I personally think you should move on.Would you want her to sit around being all sad? No..You'd want her to be happy.Maybe thats what she wants for you too.And hey...Maybe you might meet someone new! But you have to forgive and forget first in order to move on in life.Some things don't last forever hun....Best Wishes & Good Luck :)

YyUCDprVaa	after u tell the girl that u like that u like her, the other girl will realize that u don't like her. Good luck!    hint: start casually flirting with the girl u like, and maybe she will realize that u like her. get the point where if u asked her out u think she would say yes and then go for it. what's the worst thing that could happen? u get rejected. big woop.
u5scdvhZaa	man im going threw the same crap, so far what i have done is just try your hardest to let it go a little bit go out have fun with your friends don't bother her. take some time for your self, you have to take a risk here. you will be hoping she will drop you a tex,call,ETC. when she does ask her how she has been and tell her you have been working on your self and using your time apart as a test. catching up with old friends and just trying to get out and have fun, let her know you miss her and hope to talk to her again. work at her pace. hope for the best and expect the worst. you can also tell her that. just try not to set your self up for fail er. good luck and best wishes.|`|y6mzYTG5aa	well i had the same problem not that long ago but it was the other way around. The guy wanted to date me i said ok we dated for about 3 weeks, then i found out that i was moving and i told him and the i found out that i wasn't, and he still thought i was moving i really like the guy and like turn in to love and then he told me that he wanted to be friends and i didn't and i , i work with this guy so i was really hard for me to get over him. i called him Texet him and i tried to ask him to hangout but he turned me down!!! But he was the one that wanted to be friends so now were friends that don't talk. I think u should tell her how u feel if she doesn't want to hear that than move on.
KR1FdEZgaa	she is upset that you moved on. she will cool off, but it takes time. you should talk to your new girlfriend so your both on the same page. change your cell number or just ignore her text. she will get the hint. good luck with a pist off ex.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	I would be annoyed too if you only broke up six weeks ago and then started seeing my ex. <br>  <br>  I would cut contact with both of them for a while, at least until the dust has settled a bit.|`|WKiAISZdaa	Why don't you just tell her to piss off instead of fannying around messing with her feelings.|`|2S2onP86aa	Oh so you are a lesbian? <br>  <br>  Oh well, none of you will go through a heart-ache I guess.

This is too much drama for anyone.|`|iLuc1xyAaa	Number one golden rule, you cant be friends with an ex. When i was dating my boyfriend his ex used to follow us around, call him constantly and text him. He didn't have the guts to tell her to piss off so i did, it made it look like i was the one getting in the way of their "friendship" as she put it. I then broke up with him because to me it looked like he still had feelings for her, why else wouldn't he not tell her off? Long story short he missed me so much and told his ex off and he has never been happier since. Me and him are together 2 years later. Tell this girl to stop being childish, its over. Enjoy your new relationship.You don't want to lose your new relationship over your ex.<br>  Good luck<br>  x

You both just get together and come up with a date that works and means something to the both of you.

SC91Uwrhaa	Well, how did you lose her respect in the first place? Gaining trust and respect takes time. Your mother does not hate you. Just don't go looking for any trouble. Go to school, do your homework, help her out at home...clean up after your self and prove to her that you can be trusted. Don't ask to do anything for a while.|`|xyrSl2nSaa	Just follow her rules and listen to what she says and then she will see how mature you have gotten and will trust you more.

What about this "girl" causes you such insecurity? This sounds like something that you need to deal with in several ways ...  within yourself ...  by talking with your husband ...  and by scheduling a private counseling session with your Minister / Pastor / Rabbi / Priest / Bishop or whatever to discuss your feelings and to get assistance in learning how to get past the jealousy by improving your sense of self-esteem and security.    Hope this helps ... without more details, its difficult to answer most effectively.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	Is she putting the moves on your man? Does she flirt with him? If that's why you're bothered, then I would say to tell your husband what about her behavior is agitating you. If she's rubbing him on the arm, winking, etc, tell him about it (in the privacy of your own home) so he will be aware of her behavior. Sometimes men can be very - let's say oblivious to female behavior.    If it's something else about her that just makes your skin crawl or causes your jealousy meter to rise - she looks better than you, has more money than you, better career, house, whatever.... realize that jealousy is something that you'll need to work on within yourself. If you change churches, sweetie, there's no guarantee that such a problem won't follow you there! So if you can, try to distance yourself from her while you nurture your own self esteem, pray for yourself that you won't be so bothered by her existence, and go forward living your life.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	donate all that money to the church ...then can I talk to him?|`|e5FoLh2Paa	Invite her to go to the alter with you and then put the smack down on her!

Like a fling.|`|4O9FsO3Xaa	they dont know if they like eachother but they definitely are interested in one another.|`|iu6aPL98aa	Adult-<a href="http://exbi.info/" rel="nofollow">http://exbi.info/</a>
nfQhsRvfaa	Invite her over for some hot sex and then "accidentally" forget that she was coming over and hv ur face buried in another hot girls P**** when she walks in. ;)|`|2sgYribSaa	So she is a W H O R E? You should just hit it and quit it one last time. When your finished get dressed tell her you saw her, and that your sorry you just wanted one last F U C K with her and then leave.|`|eX7L3Zgzaa	take some pics of her and dont tell her you took them, upskirts, shower shots, etc.  then shoot a load on her face.  Make it seem like a accident.  drop her!|`|FfFkyHSIaa	have her come over... have sex w/ her and video tape it behind her back then show it to the guys and give her the name "porn-star"!!<br>  haha!! that b**** deserves that!!!
jdah4ZA2aa	She was probably trying to tell you that she felt cheap and used when she had sex with the other guys.  Just because a girl gives in doesn't mean she wanted to.  Some guys don't take no for an answer ... but sometimes it easier for us to take the blame than to admit he pushed us or forced us. <br>  <br>  She may still have a sex drive, which means her body wants to do these things that feel so good, but she's afraid of the bad emotional and mental aftermath.  <br>  <br>  Communication is key here.  Ask her why she feels so nervous and guilty.  Ask how you can help.  Be patient. Start small and work your way up.  Be very loving.  Be sure that you do love her and aren't just looking for a physical release.  She'll come to see sex as connected to emotional connection and not as some dirty thing where she is used like masturbation (girls feel like guys see them this way more than you'd think).  At the same time, encourage her to embrace her own sexual feelings as natural urges ... Tell her to take some time to get to know her own body...this is how girls usually first learn to experience sexual pleasure.|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	in short, she just felt cheap and felt that she better stop. she already felt cheap and hust after 3 unsuccessful relationship...plus she worry you don feel satisfy having sex with her once u found out.|`|O5xYTO1naa	maybe you should try taking control more in the relationship, try asking her why she feels so guilty even though she has had sex with 3 other guys. hope it all goes okay (: x|`|ddP3klT3aa	She is playing hard to get. She wants you to want her, but won't let you have her. She wants you to stress over it like you are doing now. She either 1) Really likes you and wants to wait or 2) Wants you to know she has slept with other guys so it will make you feel bad since she won't sleep with you. <br>  I would either stop any kind of sexuality altogether or leave her. Don't give her the attention she wants..she just wants to tell you no to see your reaction and make you upset.|`|UY0LoYYBaa	Maybe she thinks that's all you want from her and break up after. <br>  Maybe she's not ready to do it with you.<br>  Maybe she's just teasing, checking your patience. <br>  <br>  I have a boyfriend and we had sex 8 months after we got together.|`|PQwRl27Jaa	i think she playing u, come on she hd sex 3 times, r u stupid, 3 diffrent guys, please.|`|7VwdSHd8aa	i get where ur coming from, and yeah if she feels so guilty y has she slept with other people, u can sit her down and talk to her about it nicely, with no ultimatums like we have sex or i go, or like u say do what she does get her interested then put her off, but with that u run the risk of her just giving up n leaving u, thinkin ur not bothered. even if she was brought up like that and after the others, u cud still try makin her feel less guilty, romantic film, candles, glass of wine, massage ...|`|AA11683605	You're understandably sexually frustrated.  If you find this girl to be worth the effort, then sit her down and have a brutally honest talk with her.<br>  <br>  Tell her everything you've stated here..and ask for her help in coming to a solution.  Perhaps if you told her that her "signs" are a "flirt signal" to you, and that you'd prefer she not do whatever it is that peaks your sexual interest.  If she's worth her salt, she'll cut it out immediately when she realizes it turns you on....and then leaves you "out in the cold".  If she doesn't cut it out, then you'll have to assume she may just be teasing you.<br>  <br>  Either way, an honest talk will give you the answer.  Hang in there...I'm sure this isn't easy for either one of you.  The taboo north american's place on sex is a tough one to deal with....but not impossible to work through.  Much luck :)|`|FwdBKodSaa	You should tell her that "sex is not bad". However, sex presupposes a relationship based on love and mutual respect which is sealed with a public act of engagement to accept her and to give yourself to her for the rest of your lives which we call marriage. In the millieu of such a relationship two people can agree to come close to each other intimately without having the feeling they are lying to each other. The other thing is the two of you should have enough respect and trust in each other to be able to talk things out and go into detail about your feelings and desires. That's inevitable in any functioning relationship.|`|kxAMOZAuaa	First of all.. Girls always have the power when it comes to that sort of thing.  Second..You don't have to "DO" stuff every time you're together. Surprise her one day and don't suggest that or don't act on the urge when you think she wants to mess around.  She is with holding it because it may seem like thats all you want.  To regain a small portion of the control here you have to make her want it.  Forget it even exhists.  Preted it's not important to you.  She will start initiating it and really wanting it.  Try it and let me know what happens.|`|vraUJFqWaa	I think you need to sit down and talk about it with her, don't allow her to "get sidetracked."  Just pose the question, may we please sit down and talk about this.  Perhaps something happened in her past that you don't know about which leads her to fear sexual intercourse, whatever the reason, you both need to talk it out because pussyfooting around won't get you anywhere.  I know how you feel...|`|F3LBgfvwaa	She is confused. People with this unhealthy "guilty" complex about sex usually are a little messed up and I find that they are not trustworthy. Maybe you should have a nice long talk about sex with her and convince her that sex is normal and healthy and not "dirty" and figure out what kind of weird religious nonsense she believes about sex so she can get it out of her system. If that doesn't work out...run for your life. Sorry.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	you have not wrote how long you guys have been dating, because time is important in a relationship and relationships take time to build.  Give her time and you'll get all the sex and intimacy you want.
t4DP30r6aa	Go to counseling. If all of this stuff has happened to you, you need someone to help you work through your grief, trauma, and losses. The girl left you because no one wants to feel like the "rebound" girl. Your loss is very fresh and she doesn't want the relationship to end up getting serious then questioning if it is really her you love or if she is just taking the place of your former love.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	if i were in your place, i would not have gotten too close to another woman if my fiance he just died. i would not have used someone just to TRY and get over it, so her leaving was no surprise because the relationship should not have been that way. you should have taken this time to mourn, remember all the times you guys had, TRY to surround yourself by people, its never good to be alone. i would try to comfort your father, ask him if there is anything you can do to help.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u would have to get a child support order, he is still their dad and is still responsible. i can see your point in all this. but if there was no order for him to pay, i don't think u could now go back and get it.there has to have been some order with the court system.|`|bO2rzfISaa	You are a terrible mother. He is their parent equally to you and you had no right to tell him he had to choose between remarriage and his children. You indoctrinated the children against him and they will hate you for that someday, when they are old enough to understand what a horrible thing you've done.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	You seriously are keeping their father away because you are angry he married someone else?  And that's not being a terrible mother?<br>  <br>  The kids had nothing to do with the issues between the two of you.  They had the right to those 6 years with their father.  You took that way from them because you were selfish.|`|c3f0288f0795ae4a646f8c1bb917d015aa	What a P.O.S. you are!<br>  You didn't do the right thing, you were/are being selfish and you shouldn't receive one penny!<br>  BTW, stay in Japan! The US doesn't need garbage like you here.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Not allowing the children to see their father?  That is manipulative, controlling behavior.  If you don't live life my way - you don't get to see the children.  WTF is that?<br>  <br>  You made you bed - now you have to lie in it - and it sucks doesn't it?  You are going to have to ACCEPT that he is remarried and move on with your life.  Let the children visit their father  - without any conditions put on the visit.  I doubt a U.S. court can make him send money to Japan for you...if you want to go that route - move to the U.S. and plan on staying put.|`|gfHutvEFaa	Why are you so jealous of his wife? If you weren't jealous you wouldn't blackmail him by dangling his kids in front of him. You are an awful person. I have 3 kids and 2 step daughters. I consider them my own, and I love them to death. They are 21 and 19 now and tell me often how great it was to have an "additional mother type figure" around when they were growing up.<br>  <br>  Your ex should have taken you to court and got full custody. Do you date? Do you EVER bring males around your children? If you do you're also a hypocrite.<br>  <br>  You can't file for back child support in America if you don't even live here. File in Japan.|`|7SwfRs4Uaa	Safe and loving home? His wasn't? Was there a reason you kept the kids away from his new wife? Was she harmful to the children? Or are you biter he left you for another woman? You should never involve your children with your problems you and your ex have. <br>  People get divorced and meet new people. Because of this, you have left your children with no father figure. Shame.|`|9BsyKN9haa	You told your Children! WHY? You are a BAD mother! if my husband and I divorced adn he got re-married I would let my children see him, because I LOVE my children and want them to know their father no matter what! YOu are a sad person! Your poor kids are brainwashed and will never have a happy relationship because of your bitterness! If they do end up getting to know their dad and realized he isn't bad then your going to lose them because they will see what a selfish woman you are!|`|ndQkhqZeaa	No court order, no back child support.<br>  <br>  If you file for child support, he will file for visitation. The judge will not allow you to determine that his new wife cannot be around the children.<br>  Unless you can prove that she is dangerous.<br>  <br>  Be prepaired to pay have the cost of flying your children to USA for visitation.<br>  <br>  If his name is on the birth certificate and you show up in the states without legal court ordered custody, he can just take the children from you. He has the same rights to them as you do.
1ea451e36b1c7169d47c66a544f52138aa	I think you may be looking for the love you thought you had with your wife when she was 18 and you guys were just in love, not yet pregnant.<br>  Sounds to me that you had to "grow up" very early in life and had not much time to really find out who you are and what you are looking for in a relationship with a girl.<br>  Could it be that you really enjoy the companionship of the girl you are having an affair with? Yes, why not. You guys talk and understand each other. You trust her and in the things she tells you you place value. How much of that do you have at home with your wife?<br>  Sometimes, realizing that you got married to do the right thing and that you were not yet ready for a lifetime commitment is not a bad thing at all. Your life is your dream, no one should put limits on that and you have the right to start over, be free and do whatever you need to find what you makes you feel happy.<br>  You have a child, that is a responsibility that under no circumstance you must neglect. However, for parents to stay together for a child and be unhappy with one another is not the right thing to do. Sometimes both parents can be a better parent seperatly because they are happier that way, which will reflect upon the growing child. I have had a divorce, I also have found new love and looking back, I'm sooo glad I did everything that way. I have 2 kids from my firts marriage. My kids are straight A students and love Mom and Dad with shared custody, very much and without sorrow. My new husband and I have a 3 year old and we are super happy. Often we are just not ready to be married when we are just in our early twenties. Don't feel bad, just search for the truth in you. Maybe you just want out, maybe you love the other girl, maybe she is just an excuse to leave your wife, maybe you need something else, or maybe you love your wife and just wanted revenge for how she hurt you when she had her affair. Search your soul and do what you feel is the truth - no regrets, life needs to be lived !! <br>  Good luck!  One last thing, honesty counts. It's the value of your soul - tell your wife the truth, you deserve it and she does too!|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Take the high road and get a divorce before you explore whether or not this other woman could be true love. You're better than a sneaking cheating husband. It's either get a divorce or cut off all contact with the other woman and make your marriage work. You can't do both and it's best to end one relationship before starting a new one. You know that though.|`|8SnKiFypaa	Boy this is hard......I agree that you need to loose one or the other. I could sit here and say that you should never even talked to this younger woman, but you can't  go back in time now. I think you dug yourself in this hole and now you need to get yourself out of it. What do you want? Who could you live without? What makes you happy? Ask yourself those questions and I think you'll figure it out.|`|PPLxDKYwaa	There is no honesty/communication.chemistry between you and your "wife". It sounds to me like it's over. Why don't you come clean and tell her that you'd like to move-on. Understanding the person equals to love but I don't think it's the type pf love that you have for your wife, in terms of long-lasting partnership. Good luck! Life is short .. live it fully!|`|zKtrWvA5aa	If you truly love your wife and want your marriage to work you have to stop all contact with the younger woman. Concentrate on your marriage.|`|kRvc9Nyjaa	maybe you need to get away from both of them and see how you feel after being away. it would definitely clear your mind|`|BLaEQfdDaa	we all find comforter in other people sometimes, not sure if its you just getting back at your wife for what she did, maybe in you mind its ok, but what is important now you both have a child, what is the best interest for the child, if you both go your own ways will that make things better, or do you think you two can work things out, main thing you have to sit down and be honest, open and just talk about everything. how can love someone else when you have a family at home, if the love isnt there and if there is no chance of getting it back, then move on, but this other person doesnt she realize that she will be the cause of you changing your mind about your own marriage, how does she feel about it?? ok or not, are you sure you willing to give up your family for this other person, your wife and you felt enough love to hang after her affair, and now your not sure yourself. just look at everything before you make that choice!!!|`|JIW1Qo5Qaa	Make sure that you really love her.   You must of loved your wife at one time.   Love is something that should not go on and off at the drop of a hat.   I know I don't always like my wife but I have always loved her.  You might just have the same feeling about this other one later.   You have to be sure and watch out for your child and not let you pants make all the choices.|`|bdiSM1UXaa	You're 26 yrs old, she is 9 yrs younger than you. Have you done the math, have you researched this as well just like the difference between love, lust, and infatuation? Are you sure you're in love with a woman because she sounds more like a child? Also, why isn't there anything about how princess puberty feels about your future in your post? <br>  <br>     You had a family to take care of when you should have been out having fun, and most importantly getting to know yourself so that you wouldn't end up marrying someone just because they were pregnant. But you didn't do that. You chose to disregard condoms, birth control, body rhythm (if it's in line with your beliefs, abortion)  and took on a huge responsibility. Now, you're trying to take on another one, sleeping with a 17 year old. Do you not even realize that your lives are completely different, and your maturity levels probably don't match up? Do you think that she will stay with you when she can just have fun with others that do not have ex-wives and children who are ready to make her the priority in their lives? <br>     I don't want to sound mean. I'm not judging you in the least. I feel sorry for you. If I were stuck in a hopeless marriage at a young age that caused me to be emotionally distant, I'd leave in a second. And you should too. However, don't think your high school girlfriend will build a life with you. Even if she wants to, stop her, tell her to get an education so that you don't suffer a second divorce in another 7 years.|`|djUMvICoaa	You were young and she was pregnant, a bad mixture, I went through that too.  Biggest reasons why, you can end up feeling trapped, that you didn't get a chance to explore the world, you had to settle for what was in front of you.  At that age you do what seems best and make a lot of mistakes in the process.  One gets hurt and then the wondering and wandering begins, to see if things are better out there.  Right now I think you are emotionally disconnected with your wife.  Your head is telling you to do what is right but your heart isn't following.  This is bad for you, your wife and child.  But now you have someone you are infatuated with, someone about the same age as your wife when you married her.  How long do you think it will take before she decides she wants to explore the world?  I think a mistake.  I think you might have to try a seperation to clear your head, but doing it without contact with either woman.  Your head is spinning right now and until it stops you will only enter either relationship not really knowing you or what you really feel.  You are working off emotions right now, the head has to have time to clear to see the best solution.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	You know what you are doing is wrong, and you married your wife till death do you part. You have your cake and you are eating it too. You need to stop seeing the teenager, or tell your wife, and get a divorce. Think about how you felt when your wife cheated on you? It sounds like a completely unhealthy relationship all around. It will probably continue and I think you should follow your heart and do what's right. How sad that a child is involved...that always seems to be the case. Best of luck|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	You need to lose one or the other. You can't have both. thats not fair. Actually since you have a child you should focus on that relationship first.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Nine years younger than you makes her 17 years old....hardly a woman.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Either end it with your wife or ditch the underaged teeny bopper. Cheating makes you less of a man. Make your choice and stick to it or be stuck forever in between. Your choice, but it affects not only you but your family and now this other little girl your seeing. She deserves better, your wife deserves better, your child deserves better and lastly, you deserve better.<br>  <br>  Step up and be a man and quit being a lousy person.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Nice.  You are screwing jailbait.  It's not love, it's statutory rape!  Yippee!|`|vFCva8R5aa	Your cheating on your wife with a 17 year old? <br>  <br>  Oh that will work out just fine....|`|wzqahEqiaa	I'm sorry that your wife had an affair.  Remember that "two wrongs don't make it right."  Don't have an affair just because you're unhappy.  Think about your child and the example you are setting.  If you want to know the difference between love and lust check out the resources below.  Many people are afraid of being alone and I will not date anyone unless they are single.  If a person can be happily single it shows confidence and self assurance.<br>  <br>  Scientific research shows that a person's brain isn't completely mature until they are 25 years old. This doesn't mean that a person under 25 cannot make good choices. It just means the brain is still growing and changing. People may change a lot before the age of 25.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Get some personal counseling so you can be very clear about what you are about to do to your spouse, family and yourself.  You won't know if it's love you are feeling because the lust chemicals in your brain won't fizzle out until after a good year...Love is work - lust fades...|`|At8D5Xu2aa	Let's see.  You're 26, and you got married when you were 21.  You have been married 7 years.  Your wife was 18 when you got married.  She's 9 years younger than you.  Now you want advice.<br>  <br>  Here's my advice.  If you're gonna be a troll, at least do your basic math, sweetheart.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	Hmm well the best advice I can give you right now is you need some time to think things over because you're not in a right frame of mind to make any decisions.<br>  <br>  Some time away will do you some good to clear your head and get things in perspective.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Your numbers don't add up.

( that cannot be 100% correct)<br>  BUT, now you are banging an 18 year old and are confused?<br>  OF COURSE you are confused, You are lost for any sense of proper behavior.<br>  <br>  Love , lust , infatuation, all terms for your behavior toward your wife.<br>  If you are unable to generate these feelings toward her you are in trouble. <br>  As for the 18 year old stop this now before you get another 18 year old knocked up.<br>  Do her a great favor and stay out of her bed.<br>  Go back to you therapist and get a plan for your entry into maturity because you are not there yet.<br>  <br>  There is not excuse for your behavior toward any of these women.<br>  Its well past time for you to grow the hell up and learn how to deal with relationships.

I'm not saying she is but she could be one. one reason why she allowed the "friendly" relation to go beyond just being friends. And now you are at a cross-road and you don't know what to do.<br>  <br>  I guess that makes you even now with your wife ... you both had affairs. and do not know what do to?<br>  <br>  there's an old saying ... "once there's a crack on a glass, it will stay cracked." no matter how much glue you apply, the crack will always be there.<br>  <br>  Time to confront the old lady and face the consequences. And take it from there. if you guys separate (which is a sad thing) then so be it. you didn't mention kids but (hope not) but things like these happen.<br>  <br>  Also think about the younger woman ... yes, its true, she's young and she got her whole life ahead of her ... its not nice to play with her feelings, you know.<br>  <br>  your move ....|`|nr1G4uPyaa	My heart goes out to you. What does your inner voice tell you?  I believe that communication is the foundation of any relationship. I would sit down with her & explain what happened.  She should understand since she has already been there. When your young sometimes you grow in diffrant directions , unless you talk about things. It is possible to stay with someone & learn to love them again but, I was very unhappy doing that.  Once the trust is broken it is very hard to get it back. I can always forgive but, to forget is the hardest thing in the world.  Peace be with you always!!
a7VkyZLfaa	He likes you but he is shy and afraid of rejection. Smile at him and wait until he comes to talk to you . if he didnt talk to you the first time you smile , smile again and again sometimes guys will stay shy ,so encourage him to talk to you with eye contact and bodylanguage .|`|31b574dfeeb648b4c51a2adc44c50c74aa	if you guys used to talk all the time then why dont you anymore?

He will make it as difficult as possible. If you are leaving, you need to quickly give up on the idea of getting anything from him. Get money from someplace else because he is not going to help you out in this.|`|El4rRzWOaa	Hey. I studied law at A grade. If you ask for his accounts to be checked, the courts will do it. He cant hide any money, its a jailable offence. Your entitled to 25% of his earnings when you seperate, and also you are entitled to 10 percent of his houses value and anything you added to your house, (like if you bought the fridge) You would be entitled to its worth aswell...<br>  <br>  Take him to court, they always favour the claiment.|`|8SnKiFypaa	Ok you are  married.....and in court half of whats his is yours and vice versa. Don't let him feed you any bullshit.....do some research, talk to a lawyer and hear what they have to say? Also do you work?? If not I suggest getting a job. Can your parents help you out for a little while? There is always something that you can do. Don't wait just leave with your dignity. He knows ur not leaving because in a way you need him. Don't give him that satisfaction just leave! GOOD LUCK!|`|kRvc9Nyjaa	hes wrong about the judge, but if it comes to the point where he dont want to give you money, just leave and go to a family's house or your parents house, until you get a job,|`|Pey04FlCaa	ok,<br>  if its that bad to where u just cant take it anymore. and u want out of the relationship. dont depend on him to give you anything. i mean its not gonna be all peaches and cream at first when u leave. you may just have to start back and square one. you may have to suffer for a little while at first but it would be worth it. but i dont understand how you expect for him to take care of u and you are divorcing him. be a woman and find your own way. trust me if its as bad as your trying to make us believe it is. and if you really wanted out. you would just leave and not even worry about him or his money. its not even worth going to court and fighting for his money...money that does not belong to you anyway. be a WOMAN go out and get your own and show him that you can make it without him. you dont need his money that bad. you dont need no mans money that bad.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Here's what you do:<br>  <br>  Go to YWCA or other women's shelter for free legal advice. They also have transitional housing and job assistance....pretty much everything you need to get on your own 2 feet. I know it's scary but don't stay in a relationship where he doesn't respect you enough to treat to as an equal partner. You deserve better than that and you know it. He can't hide all of the money because there's always a paper trail....no matter what! Go to this website for more info: <a href="http://www.ndvh.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndvh.org/</a><br>  <br>  Financial control is a form of domestic abuse and you don't have to put up with it!|`|gBEWhY2Jaa	Wow sounds like my ex.. he was controlling and it took my years to leave.  So I understand completely what you are going through. <br>  <br>  GO to your local court immediately and ask them what you can do<br>  <br>  You can also can a protection from abuse order if you are afraid of him.....ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  He is trying to scare you by saying there is nothing a judge cant do..if the accounts are in both names you have every right to access them|`|gj6rpPjYaa	Divorce is not the solution. There is no reason enough for you to leave your husband. Did you know that getting into marriage meant that you were submitting your whole life to your husband to control? If you don't submit to him, respect and obey him, then your marriage would have difficulties. There is nothing wrong in your husband controlling you. That is marriage! If you are sick because of the smoke being generated at home by your husband, then that is another kettle of fish and should be dealt with separately on its own merit.<br>  This does not imply that your husband has been a perfect husband; far from it. What I am saying is that you should play your part in saving your marriage. Your husband has partially (ironically) played his part in not letting you go!

You may win, but then the courts may decide that you are both responsible. <br>  <br>  I am not aware of legal precedent mandating that one party in the engagement pay for a called off wedding.|`|ds5MCdS5aa	Of course he should! It wasn't your idea, nor your guests, to call it off, therefor, it is his responsibility to reimburse both your guests, and any facilities retained.  I'm pretty sure you could take this to court and win!  If he had the balls to call off the wedding, he needs to take care of Business and shell out the dough!  Good Luck!|`|eWObKmBSaa	Who paid for it all, or any to begin with.  Marriage is to be a twosome thing.  You can't marry yourself.  Tell him that it is a joint affair to marry and it IS A JOINT affair to get undone.|`|dcd11iUwaa	HE is<br>  AND you can keep the ring too!<br>  f%^& him|`|OlLMoT5Daa	The one who calls it off is the one financially responsible, and should step up and be an adult and offer to make it up to the guests.<br>  <br>  Since you're still a month away, most places will refund the money minus a deposit - especially the venue, since they can rent it out again.  No food has been cooked yet, so that should be mostly refundable.<br>  <br>  Sell the ring to pay back your parents what isn't refundable.<br>  <br>  Tell him to move along.<br>  <br>  Someone else suggested writing a quick note telling people - NICELY- what happened and apologizing tot hem.  Pretty sure he's not going to do so, so you do it.  People will be sympathetic and if they can't get refunds, most of the time the airlines will let them transfer the tickets to another date and place.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have to ask - you're 47 and parents are paying for your wedding? Why?|`|zEZF5ITMaa	I would say he is, but I think you should sent out a nice letter to everyone to thank everyone and tell them the news in a polite way and apologize for inconveniences.

Keep that diamond.|`|2b89bf97bd46e907e67742dba26abd5daa	I personally think that he should, because he called it off, it's not fair for your friends and family to have to shell out that kind of money in support of the two of you for him to call it off after they spent the money to get there!|`|OGhWKEWoaa	I'm sorry to hear this. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4672277_call-off-wedding-class.html?ref=fuel&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=ssp&utm_campaign=yssp_art" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4672277_call-off...</a>|`|E0uRBwWtaa	The moron should pay.

He called off the wedding... he gets to pay!<br>  You would have to take him to court. Or ... your parents actually. Under the law, all this money was a gift "as a condition" basis. Meaning, under the condition you two would get married.<br>  He is incredibly stupid and he shouldn't play around with you like that. You dont deserve that under any circumstances. If he still loves you, he should marry you. Its not like you/yourparents are made out of money. How does he plan postponing the wedding... with the same arrangements already made for this one? That's so childish. Coldfeet is the lamest excuse.|`|S1Q1mVgJaa	Who paid for it? Legally speaking no body owes anybody anything, that's the risk you take when you pay in advance. I guess you could take this to a law office and ask a Lawyer what you can do, but they will charge you for the time.|`|FlgTkLn0aa	the person that called off the wedding..but do you really want the ring..what bad memmories it will bring....sell it and buy you something else or take a vacation or give the money to charity so something good comes out of this.|`|srNze5uIaa	He is the one who canceled; so he has to repay. If he does not want, you can go on the court if you have proof he is the one who canceled.|`|VzXSC8fiaa	Technically he should have to pay because if he hadn't called off there would be no financial concerns.<br>  <br>  They would say the same thing in court, runaway brides have to pay compensation for damages same thing goes to men|`|AlFCR6Xpaa	Traditionally the Brides family pays for the Wedding and the Grooms family pays for the Reception!|`|4p9ez6PHaa	Since HE is the one that called it all off he IS responsable to pay back wut is owed to the people! and girl KEEP that ring!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im sorry that happened to you!|`|65VJCQ5Faa	The guests are on their own for their plane tickets, but he pays for everything else.|`|7xq7hUB7aa	who paid the wedding? did you guys split the cost?? i think you guys should divide the guests' airfare up in half, if not take him to small claims court|`|jCeylLsIaa	both of you. you should have thought about this possibility.|`|t4DP30r6aa	Don't repay anyone.. Why would you? Just go anyway and have a short vacation! Haven't you ever seen FRIENDS?|`|KtmbnW4Naa	he is what are you insane if he called it off you shouldnt even have to pay a cent!

You lost a good friend.. it's ok to feel sad.|`|6rJj1wH3aa	I think you should talk to him about it and if he deserves a second chance you should give it to him, if he doesnt you should just be done with him.|`|KJmuHxcCaa	Try to figure out if was a bad idea and if you decide it was ask him if he will forgive you and go back out.|`|c325AREXaa	i think maybe the breakup was just something you did rash.just have a talk with him,communicate,see if you will still want to be together.|`|GSIHc6nQaa	Honestly, you shouldn't do anything. He will get over it soon. You cant run people down to make him/her feel better. Things takes time. He will come around soon. Don't worry, everyone may be mad or sad if someone breaks up with them. Think of it this way, how long can he be mad for over a relationship? People come and people go :) Good Luck :)|`|UFiHugGOaa	eh, this happened to me before i got dumped and wernt okay with it, what you should do is say sorry but and tell him the reason why, theres really nothing you can do unless u really do love him then ask him back out|`|FfFkyHSIaa	its part of breaking up. think of it the other way.. if he would break up with im sure he would feel bad as well. its just part of it. hope You feel better.|`|JiRJQCHFaa	Alot of people will be as mopey as possible in order to guilt trip you into going back out with them.  Its a viscous cycle.  If your set on breaking up stick to it.|`|TmD6Nnxzaa	Breakupss are never easy.|`|NLlhv0Hmaa	Ask yourself why you dumped him in the first place.

1gyzz3kxaa	Ok so you may not like the responses you get, but here goes....<br>  <br>  If this boy does drugs and smokes..and is a 'bad boy' like you say, how do you know his affiliation with drugs is only as a user?  How do you know he isn't involved with the distribution of the drugs?  Think about this...if you're with him and he is in possession of drugs, not only will he be arrested, so will you.  <br>  <br>  Is it worth it?  Is he worth it?  <br>  <br>  Here is another thought...if he is a user of drugs, how comfortable are you with having him in your home?.around your wallet/purse?.  The reason I ask is because most users at that age, don't have an income to support their habit and will resort to theft to support their habit.  If they don't steal, they'll 'borrow' money with no intention of paying it back..they only see the money as way to get their drugs.<br>  <br>  Again..is it worth it?  Is he worth it?<br>  <br>  The story he gave you about his girlfriend probably cheating on him..is more than likely her getting tired of his behavior and giving him an ultimatum to straighten up or their relationship will end.  He's playing the sympathy card with you..don't get taken in.<br>  <br>  You seem like a pretty intelligent girl, don't get caught up with someone that is already on the wrong track..drugs, juvie..etc..and although you parents may be strict, its all about keeping you safe and on the right path.|`|31b574dfeeb648b4c51a2adc44c50c74aa	women are automatically attracted to that "bad boy" appearance becuase of our primal instinct to find someone that will protect us.  We want the strongest and the best.  Truth is in our society the bad boy is usually more bad then good.  ive been there and done that and if I was you id forget about him.  There are better fish in the sea.... he can "work something out" sounds like bad news to me... and he will probably end up cheating on you.|`|AA11987900	Find someone better for if he does go to a juvenile detention center then you are with out a boyfriend so it would be better to find someone else less troublesome.<br>  <br>  My Friend was dating druggies a lot and one eventually broke into her house, drunk, at three A.M. so there are many problems that can arise.|`|NpWKUz0qaa	Stay away from that guy, its sounds he more interested in the drugs right now than having a girlfriend, you deserve something better.

He does drugs and is in trouble, so he has no credibility. He sounds like a nightmare all around.|`|16vMIGPiaa	What is it about young women that they're attracted to "bad" boys??  Please for goodness sake do not tangle your life up with this guy.  At least not until he gets himself straightened out.  There are lots of decent guys out there that it's safe for you to associate with.  Dating a guy that's in trouble sends him the message that it's okay to be in trouble.  It's not.  And a very wise person once said "You can't play with tar and not get some on you."|`|tX27e0UFaa	No matter hwo much you like him you should keep a distance. If he is caught doing somehting bad when you are around you can be in trouble too. You parents are over protective for a reason! They want you to be safe. He sounds like a problem to be around and if you get involved things can only get worse for you. Your reputation, grades, other friends and fines!|`|Vh9CbtLUaa	Listen to your parents. 9th grade?<br>  Don't ruin your life because you are too nice for your own good and safety.<br>  You need to leave him to his family, let them take care of him. <br>  The decisions that you make now will last your lifetime. How will you explain this to your daughter when you want her to listen to you?|`|AA11812015	Get some respect for yourself and try to find a decent guy.
el8yX5q3aa	If everyone agrees...why not?  IT is your wedding....you do what you want to do.!|`|q2AsDnjpaa	This is alright. Should actually be invited if no one else has expressed interest.|`|zEZF5ITMaa	It's YOUR wedding, it's YOUR day. Do what makes it special!<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Sure. Why not? If you're cool with it, then you should do it.|`|eWObKmBSaa	IF the groom and bride do not mind, why should I|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	yes|`|SwIOyL0laa	Then who is giving the bride away?|`|4p9ez6PHaa	There is nothing wring with that. It is your day u can do wut u want really! lol Congrats
FVFxE6owaa	Yes, that's a huge mistake.  You should wait until your wedding is a bit closer before buying a dress (nine or so months before the wedding is a good time).    I had a friend who bought her dress a few sizes smaller than what she actually was because she figured she'd lose the weight.  Long story short, she didn't lose the weight and had to have the back changed from a zipper to a lace-up back.  That alteration cost her quite a bit of money.|`|4To2mrpIaa	ABSOLUTELY.....It is certainly easier to take up then let out.|`|tzRyeX62aa	Yes, because Wedding dresses run small.  I am normally a size 8 and my wedding dress was a size 14.  Once they altered it it worked perfectly, and the wedding shop worker said all dresses run really small, so you have to buy bigger sizes.      GOOD LUCK!|`|4ee462d07960362b22e9c105ac41714daa	Yes it is a mistake. I agree, get the size you are now, you can always get it taken in.  Speaking for personal experience - wanting to the lose the weight before your wedding (which can be SUPER stressful) is relatively hard to do.  Save yourself the additional stress and just get the size you are now...    Congratulations!|`|81wvN8Rraa	Don't do it. It will be a big mistake. Especially since even if you don't loose that weight you can't stuff yourself into a dress that small.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Don't buy it now. Focus on losing the weight and if say 6 months away from the wedding, you are smaller THEN get a dramatically smaller size. NOT yet! Don't put that pressure on yourself. Waiting and seeing will still have some pressure but won't leave you feeling hopeless if you don't reach your goal.    Ps. here's what I wrote to someone to help them lose weight before the wedding (works in general too)    The biggest and best piece of advice I can offer you: BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. And forgive yourself when you digress from your 'rules', if you end up having any.    2. Don't have strict rules! If you are craving something, first, think: am I hungry or thirsty? If so, eat or drink something healthy. If you are still craving it, then eat a small amount. i.e. One to two small cookies. And/or stop when you are SATISFIED, not full! Full is bad. Think of full as an overload. Satisfied is just enough. And when you get hungry again, eat again! ASAP. Eat smaller meals more frequently. Your body will adjust.    It is so psychological. I am 5'2 and lost 20 lbs by believing that I wasn't going to die if I ate less. I just believed for some reason that I needed the fat to stay or else my body would die. In truth, as long as we keep nourishing ourselves, our body doesn't need or want that extra fat.    3. Try to stay away from whipped cream, but again, do it if you are really craving it and can't get it off your mind. Diets are not about saying NO they're about saying YES. Or at least about saying yes more than no.     4. REDUCE YOUR PORTIONS!! So important. When you are full, STOP! Your body will get used to the new portion size over time. Your eyes also need to get used to the new portion size. Leave food if you are full.     See food as something to give you energy and nourishment only. Not as something to make you feel better. Taking a walk, talking to a friend, relaxing can make you feel better. Food will have very little impact and as you may know can make you feel worse.    Try to picture the food as it enters your stomach. Lettuce looks much better than a chocolate bar doesn't it?    Don't shy away from carbs, but definitely try to avoid WHITE carbs and choose multigrain/whole wheat. It will make you full and keep your nourished.    If you were thin when you were younger, try to think that you are supposed to look that way. Or picture you but thinner and think that that is how you are meant to look.     I am definitely in the camp of freedom to eat what you want when you want (but choosing healthier foods a lot more often). If you are looking for a 'food schedule' I am not a believer in that sort of thing. I believe we should restrict ourselves as little as possible.    Those are some pieces of how I reached my goal. Good luck to you and feel free to message me if you have q's!|`|UUQXNhMtaa	Yes most definitely. Get the dress isze you need now , it is easier to take up than to ever let out enough!|`|pub2GLZPaa	Well, considering wedding dress sizes fit on average at least 2-4 sizes smaller then you'd normally wear, you actually bought a 6-8 size.    So I don't know how much weight you have to lose or the resources (time, money etc) to help you do it over the next year.... also motivation is a big factor- WILL you actually do it?    Its more like 4-5 sizes you will need to drop..... you can do it if your 110% focused on your goal...... otherwise hope you have money for a new dress :)|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	No offense but you better start looking for another dress. First of all it's not just 4 sizes too small, it's probably like 6-8 sizes too small. Wedding dress sizes are weird. Many girls who normally wear a size 6 dress end up in a size 10 wedding dress. Find a dress in your size now and they can easily take it in. They can't let it out. I thought I was going to lose weight too, but I ended up gaining. Luckily I bought my dress in the right size and it still fit me.|`|PsQFasl4aa	Oh my goodness, get the size you are now. If you lose the weight get it taken in.|`|AeN3LD0taa	One thing to consider: Wedding dress sizes are not generally comparable to regular clothing sizes. Many women who are 6's in street clothes are 10's in wedding dresses.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	A size 10 formal dress, like a wedding gown, is more like size 6 or 8 in normal, every day clothes.    So yes, that would be a huge mistake. Buy a dress that fits the size you are now and have it altered to accommodate for changes in weight a few months before the ceremony.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Yes.  I suggest you find another dress or find this particular style somewhere else.    Congratulations|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	You have to be realistic and fit the body you have right now.    The LAST thing you want is to commit yourself to fitting into something unrealistic, and then having to stress yourself over every bite of food you eat between now and then. What if you fall slightly short, and end up stuffed into a dress that makes you look like a sausage? You don't want to feel uncomfortable on your wedding day, hon. You want to relax and have a good time, and not hafta fidget with a tight dress.    Best of luck and congrats !!|`|HEvSVMeVaa	Even though your not buying it from a dress shop, maybe see if you could get it in the size you  currently are. And remember that most wedding dresses run smaller than your normal size; i.e. I'm normally a size 16-18 and my dress was a size 22. Also there are plenty of dresses out there and you may still find one in the right size that you will love just as much.|`|w1necKzYaa	Totally bad idea! Not to say you won't or can't but you will feel like crap if you are unable to loose the weight you want and are unable to fit the dress!
07EuYEk3aa	The job of a notary is to verify a person's signature not determine whether the document that is being signed is a legal document.   Many times a notary will just verify the signature of someone on a letter that is being sent.|`|m81dfyOYaa	It is the responsibility of a notary to insure that the person signing any document is in fact the person whose signature is on a document. If I don't know the person I will ask to see a driver's license or photo id. I'm not a lawyer and have no responsibility to check the legality of a document that's being notarized.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Can you be a little clearer?|`|XExUVo0Uaa	Yes a notery can noterize any document it does not have to be a "legal" document.

5NKa5Y8laa	Well considering that she has broken an unwritten rule between girlfriends (as in NEVER get involved with a friends ex), AND you still have feelings for him, why are you even friends with either of them still.    Unless you can get over your feelngs for this man, and stay gotten over him, then there is no way this can work well for any of you. You will be jealous of her.  She will be wary of you trying to steal her husband.  And he will be aware that you are an available booty call should he want one.     Move on from both of them.|`|ghLdIUz0aa	i would tell her, if shes truley your best friend, she shouldnt get mad. best friends are supposed to tell each other EVERYTHING, regardless of what it is, just tell her that your happy for her, and you dont want to interfere but that you still have feelings for this man, and that you still want to continue to be best friends with her, but when you two hang out, just make it girls nights, without him, until you can get over him. i think that if you dont tell her, she might feel like you betrayed your friendship with her by not telling her everything thats going thru your mind.|`|6EIdLkS7aa	For sure don't tell her!  It will cause big problems for the three of you, with you being the loser. They are getting married - forget your feelings for him and move on. (I know it won't be that easy, but if you want to keep a relationship with them you need to do it)|`|RupVgAQEaa	look at it this way put yourself in her position would u want her to tell u that she still had feelings for him also if she were a real friend she wouldn't have let it get to the point to when they were getting married karma is a b***ch|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Just because it did not work for you and your ex does not mean it will not work for them.  Maybe they were meant to be together.  It will feel awkward for you to see them together but if they are happy you will learn to be happy for them.  You may only have what you think are feelings for him because he is with your friend.  If it will be too hard for you stop being their friend, but are you sure you want to lose your friend over these.  I have been in a situation somewhat like yours.  My friend started dating someone I was seeing when I was in high school.  We were still talking and all of a sudden they started talking.  I found out she tried to sleep with him.  I was a little upset but I remained her friend.  They are not together now, but at the time it was weird.  So you have to make the decision of whether you will be happy for them or if you will just walk away.  But do not tell her you have feelings for him because your feelings for him could be for the wrong reason.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Sure do it on Springer|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	what do their user names have anything to do with the price of tea in China???|`|Lz3yxrXKaa	no. don't tell her. you keep that to yourself and let them be happy.|`|cdQryr7paa	Why tell her?

If you run into either of them just offer your congratulations and move on. There are way too many good things to think about than to waste any time resenting those two hussies.

The other reason why thye break up....is that neither really knows what true commitment is about....and that working on a relationship is the way to success....becasue they give up....and dont learn a thing from their errors      :  )|`|IPb9zjL2aa	They deserve each other;|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	There maybe nothing you can say to stop her from getting with this other man if she makes the choice to leave her husband.

And yes its been bloody hard for the past 3 years for us to both be going through divorces and custody issues whilst trying to get our own relationship off he ground. Between us we have so much emotional baggage that is threatening our peace and love together, thats for sure, but rather than walking away, we have made a committment to do our best to work out all of our problems and be happy together.  Only time will tell if we are successful.      Bottom line is.. it isnt supposed to be this hard.  Really its putting the relationship behind the 8 ball right from the beginning.      Its always best to get over a relationship ending BEFORE entering into a new one.  Start clean.   And in your friends case, she first needs to deal with actually breaking up with her husband first, and thats not going to be easy, and he's going to be bitter when he finds out she has been cheating.|`|Lz3yxrXKaa	if your  best friend is unhappy with her current marriage then she needs to talk to her husband, to tell him how she feels and what's she wants now which is not him, its someone else. weather they will be ok in the end together has to be determined.

I have watched my ex-wife move from guy to guy, leaving each one for another, and now she is a very lonely old woman with a tag for being a serial cheat, her abuse has made me a much stronger person and I thank her for that, best schooling I ever had, the pain was certainly not pretty, but the education invaluable, my new/current wife is a gem. I was alone for many years after my first wife burned me, not trusting anyone for a long time. Now she is alone and untrusted by everyone, even our kids dont trust her or want to spend time with her, I have to remind them to call her for birthdays, and holidays or they dont bother. Karma really does come back to bite you.|`|29hcn9JRaa	The reason your friend should not leave her husband for this other guy is for many reasons, however the main reason is due to the fact that many people who are married start to get bored as the newness of the once romantic man or woman they married starts to settle down, reality of bills, in-laws, and who left the cap off the tooth paste become a constant reminder of simplicity, and while most married people can adjust and not cross any major boundaries, many cannot, especially women who are so attracted to the power and thrill of fresh romance and love, and to a certain degree their is nothing wrong with these wants and desires, however when your married and your boyfriend is married, ah it gets a little dysfunctional, and the consequences of both their actions will be quite humbling. Let us just assume she leaves her hubby for the married man, after a while this married guy who she thinks is Mr. Wonderful, won't be so wonderful, as he is merely a man, no different then the man she has now, they will have the same issues, bills, in-laws, and might I add, maybe in-laws who don't respect her, family issues, and again, who left the cap off the tooth paste? After the party simmers down, it will be fairly much of the same old same old, different man sure, but at the end of the day, this honeymoon will end. Your friend is a attention love seeker, she needs to really take some time to get to know who she is as a woman, this must be done alone, no men, and this is my advise, clarity is the best remedy, and you cant get this by being married, and dating a married man, do I make any sense?|`|uzWqpG0Maa	Stay out of it.

Don't be surprised or upset when or if she reacts negatively towards your advice - try practicing what you will say with a friend and word it in the best most supportive way possible. As a caring friend, talking to her is definitely the right thing to do. Urge her to get marriage counseling. She's your friend, and eventually, if she gets mad, after the heat wears off, she'll see you for what you are - a caring friend.

But if this is just a crush that he will get over soon then you still have a chance. Only time will tell, you can not do anything more to get him to change his mind. Just keep being yourself obviously that is why he is attracted to and the reason why he can talk to you. Remember that even if he ends up dating this girl, that all is not lost between the two of you some couples start off as being the best of friends then slowly end up being more then that. those are the people who have the best relationship i think...because they already established great communication and trust. so if you ask me your on the right track. Just make him aware that you will always be there for him and if you think that you have a shot with this guy then you should try and tell him how you feel about him. He may be feeling the same way, Just never considered the option of the two of you dating, ad dump the this girl he knows will end up hurting him. If you are to shy to come out and tell him your feelings just continue to remind of how great of a person you are. He will come around one day. if it is meant to be.

If hes willing to tell you about his love interest hes obviously not interested in you at all... sorry that might sting a bit but its true you must of put your self in the Im just a friend position.. which can be great, and in time he might see you in a new light.. however, for now you have to decide if your cool with being the friend or if you want to pursue him as a boyfriend, in that case you need to show him a new you by flirting, playing hard to get, giving great eye contact, letting him know that there are others interested in you, getting someone to fall for you is a delicate dance, if you take the right steps you can get what you want but if you trip over your feet you could lose a great friend.|`|i0PBpcIhaa	give "it" to him to win him over.|`|mZ41AFRnaa	train|`|17p9paihaa	you should let him know how you feel because he most likely feels the same way, unless he has made it absolutely clear that your just friends. he's probably shy and waiting for you to make the first move, and trying to make you jealous.  if he doesn't feel the same way, just move on, but stay friends  hope things work out :)
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Have you thought that maybe she doesnt do anything because there are plenty of people around her to DO everything for her.   why are you living with her parents?

Then she wouldn't have her mother to depend on.  :)|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	Either continue to live the way you are both living, or get an apartment of your own. You have to communicate how you are feeling to your wife so she understands how you feel in this situation. You are her husband, and you have to find a way to get her to hear you. if that does not work tell her you are getting an apartment and when she is ready to grow up and be a responsible wife and mother she can then move in with you.|`|AA11785285	Wow, sweetie, you are soooo far down in the bottom of the test tube you can't even see the rim, and how far you have to climb out... when you look straight ahead, it all looks clear, doesn't it.... until you write it out like this?

What can she did in her parents house? At the same time you need to be a man and let her know what you want. A woman is supposed to be the back bone for a man at the same time a man is supposed to respect that woman. She needs to cook, clean, take care of the kid, work if she have to and service you when she can. At the same time show her some appreciation and let her know you care. Don't just bully her around. A woman is only going to be as good as you treat her. You cuss her out and treat her badly she is going to do you the same way and its going to be worse. If you talk to her and let her know the deal without screaming and sounding like father and she still doesn't act right then let her know its not working out and you are going to find someone else but at the same time still take care of your responsibility which is your son. Remember your son always. Children need there father no matter what|`|6kue5meiaa	She does nothing ... except the Laundry, the Dishes, and caring for the Child and keeping things Picked-up.     She sees you cleaning up after Yourself, and about half the time she helps you with that.     Do you have a problem picking up after yourself?    Is it possible her mother WANTS to make dinner (a lot of women don't like other women ... even their own daughters ... in their kitchen cooking)?     And why, if you are working, are you living with HER parents? Is it possible that they might be thinking the same things about you that you are basically saying about her? Something about responsibility?    Women NEED their own turf; their own home. Then they have their space to care for ... it does really make a difference. Right now you are a part of a family dynamic that began long before you came along, and she is very likely acting according to "house rules" set by her parents.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	Get someone in to help out, between you and her folks can u afford it? You've tried talking to her, you've tried having a fit, you've tried doing it yourself. None of its working. Some people can live in it, others can't. Maybe set aside a weekend with her and her folks and do a massive clean - all rooms, everything done. I find it more easy to get motivated if i'm only looking at only a few things to do on a daily basis. It doesnt look so big. It also means that if i'm having a bad day with the kids then when hubby gets home we can do a quick 10 min job together, leaving time for family stuff for the rest of the night.|`|by7H31Djaa	You saying/thinking "Sure, I do leave a mess behind me to be cleaned up every day, but I don't feel that it's so much to ask to clean up two soda cans, my dinner plate, a shirt, a tie and some pants every day." isn't going to help the situation! No it's not much to pick up BUT she's your wife not mother. A mother picks up after her kids when they can't do it themselves. Now if a mother continues even after the child is old enough that's her problem. A wife's job is not to pick up after her grown husband. Picking up the plate from the table at meals includes a wife picking up after her husband. But picking up glasses, clothes, or other messes is not.     So about your wife, her job is to clean up after your son and keep the house cleaned. If she's too lazy to do it then she has some growing up to do. Being a wife and mother involves cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. You need to continue to talk to her and set an example. DON'T clean up what she should which would be dishes, laundry, and the detailed househould cleaning (i.e bathroom and kitchen).  If your wife still doesn't get it it will really affect the relationship. I would like to think that after she notices she can't eat because theres no clean plates or take a shower because there isn't clean towels she'll start to do something. If it doesn't work with her then do your own laundry and that way when she asks you why you aren't doing hers tell her "Well you're so lazy at doing your chores that i figured that you don't think they need to be done. BUT my clothes needs to be washed for work (or whatever) so im doing it myself!". If she still insist that you do her laundry too tell her "Well you never do it on time before so i figured it's because you don't need them clean often. So, again, my clothes needs to be clean for work" just anything similar.      How can you make her feel good if she's not making you feel good by doing her job as a mother and wife. You can't come home and kiss her and tell her you miss her because it's not true. No man, that's aware of the responsibility of a wife, would miss a dirty home and lazy wife. Sorry, i know that sounds to harsh but it's reality.  My husband doesn't help me do anything. Not sweep, dishes, or laundry but im perfectly fine with that. He's the only one working right now so im fine with it and plus it's my job anyway. The way i see it is when a husband helps out it's exactly that "helping out" and not really doing his job. All i ask for my husband is that he pick up after himself and HELP KEEP clean. NOT help me clean. Picking up after himself in my opinion includes his dirty laundry on the floor, beer cans, and food wrappings etc.|`|OHydEvTCaa	Pray|`|zHwlGhIAaa	you really need to sit down with her and communicate.  let her know that she is not doing her part in this marriage.  if she is not going to work, she needs to keep things clean and care for her child properly.  there is a way to work this out.  i know its frustrating and mind blowing, but dont lose your family over it.  Encourage her to work so that she can help you two move into your own home.  Try to have open dialogue with her and see what the real problem is before emotionally cutting her off.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	quit     your belly aching, man up, or shut up|`|L3hc9EOiaa	Take your wife and kid and move out, get her out of her parents apron strings, you and her and your child are a family unit, get some space between them and you before it destroys your marriage and family, living with her folks allows her to not grow up, cause mommy and daddy are there for support|`|AA12222291	Move on, she will never change. It took me years of counseling to understand that some people are lazy and incapable. You chose poorly.    Leave her, find a real woman and move on.    Don't wast the years I did waiting for her to change. People will be who they want to be... and she WANTS to be like this.     She will not be able to be a mother and you will soon have 100% custody. Your son will need to be parented, taken care of and taught how to be a responsible adult.    Let me warn you of the biggest consequences.   My wife did not want to work. She sat home doing crafts and chatting online. The kids were left to themselves all day, with no guidance or responsibility. No one made them get out of bed, clean their room or anything for that matter. fast forward 17 years... they are incapable of being adults now. They sit around and play video games. They have observed and copied their mothers behavior. I have worked enough to compensate for my wifes lack of maturity. It was starve or parent. By the time I figured out that she was not parenting AT ALL... It was too late.     You owe it to your son to find someone that is mature. Don't hurt your children(child)...     Trust me, you will hate your wife and become bitter. Leave now before you are less than you are|`|k3obZ8Dqaa	I think you should try one more time. just as her one more time and sit down with her and tell her how you feel. just ONE time do not keep doing it.. this is just a last attempt because it seems like she doesnt care so thats all she gets is one chance. and then if she still doesnt do anything about it...    You can leave her. and take your son with her. go to the court and find a lawyer and fight for full custody and give her rights for weekends    she is obviously not fit to be a mother or a wife. when you talk to her you should let her know that if she doesnt change you are sorry but you are going to have to look else where. No one deserves to be anything but happy. You owe it to yourself and most importantly your SON and give him a childhood with the one parent that really cares and loves him.       Do not take long to leave. or you may never leave.|`|OSomjqYdaa	Man, I feel for you.  I know I can't live in a dirty house.  No way-it would make me physically and emotionally sick.

Did you two talk about what level you two were on.  She dropped the conversation when you brought up something about your relationship which should have been your second clue.  The first was when you found out she was spending time with another guy.  This does not sound like something you should continue to waste your time with, move on and find someone else.  I would care less if she wants to break it off, because there is nothing to break off.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Of course she wants to break it off.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	dude,,, step away from the computer,,  walk away,,,from the computer, find you a comic book read it, then get another comic book repeat procedure,,,do not go near the computer,,, stay away from the light...|`|L3hc9EOiaa	you met online? hmm let me think, Man Up! go out and find a real girl, cyber relationships never work, of course she is done with you, she avoids the question every time because she is happy to have an online friend but that is where it ends, after reading this, turn off the computer and hurl it out the window, go meet some real people for a meal or drinks, start exploring the real space and bypass cyber space,

(as your name says) perhaps your mother should be watching over your computer activities a little more strictly  maybe your mother has spent her entire life, sacrificing herself raising you and doesnt want you to go into what could be a potentially bad situation. Parents are like that you know, they want what ia best for their children and sometimes they need to make decisions that the child doesnt agree with. You need to understand that and try to be sympathetic to her wishes instead of trying to over rule her and do as you damn well please.  if you were my kid, you'd be off the computer for awhile and be spending your time understanding the impacts of 14 year olds trying to be sexy beasts before they grow up.  And, its late, you need to go to bed.
2uXNtCUlaa	No offense but your boyfriend is acting childish. Do not worry about if he will call you back not you have more things to think about..chances are that he will call you back once he feels insecure about himself.

Make him aware of how his questioning your motives is bothering you,and would like him to trust you more|`|arXHFPcTaa	Yes, that is both controlling and jealous behavior.

And the attitude in which it is presented is important as well, present it as what it is, a cute fun gift.|`|ZiLHLMHzaa	If you really want this girl back, then give her the flowers. Also, I think maybe before V-day, you should be subtle and casual about doing things like suggesting that you and her go somewhere, as long as you dont make it an actual date.

And to answer her question about the "What would you do with me if your sister wasn't here?" just say "Nothing" or "Nothing that you'd like" or maybe even say something about like shooting animals or deer or something.

Tell her you wouldn't do anything with her because you are not interested in her and you like someone already.  That should throw a bucket of cold water on her.  If that doesn't work, tell her you are going to throw a real bucket of cold water on her (at least a glass full).  That should cool her down.  Good luck.

If she doesn't come you should not be offended since you were worried about her not being comfortable in the first place.

Try getting his meds adjusted, maybe he'll snap out of it.|`|2JPRTMIJaa	First off, excellent play at trying to make him seem deviant. A lot of people have arrests on their record. He's good enough to be around the child (and have another with him) while at home, but not if you split? Heck, he wanted to watch the kid more than have sex with you! Can't be an all bad guy/dad!   This is typical angry woman behavior, but if I read between the lines, I see that he works, he's tired after a hard day, is interested in the child. He was willing to be a dad again (and you werew illing to conceieve with him again), so what do you really got to complain about?|`|DlBeFoKcaa	i am not sure what his problem is, hun we all get very stressed in life and with the economy sucking it makes me wonder if there is an issue at his job....just a thought......hugs for you.....here is antoher hug again.....email me if you want to chat.
AA11607503	No, it doesn't necessarily mean that you are into her sexually.  It could mean that you are impressed.  I am an open person that will very willing admit when another girl is pretty or hot.  It doesn't mean I swing that way just willing to give an honest perception of her and/or her body.|`|5kXe739Naa	BI ?!|`|w5As20EOaa	yes its normal   im married and i do it  its far from gay!
fULZei1haa	I got contacts in the third grade because the doctor said it would slow down the rate at which my eyes were getting worse. (That's not grammatically correct, but it does get the point across...sorry!)  I never had a problem!  Maybe you could get your doctor to say that.|`|XP36zr63aa	well, i wear contacts and as long as you put them in solution every night and take good care of them, theyre great. i dont even notice that im wearing them. you just let them soak in the solution before going to bed and make sure to empty the container and add a few more drops the next day. its really easy. they dont irritate my eyes at all and ive never had mine come out or anything during school. hope i helped!|`|MJ39zfnqaa	say that glasses can easily be broken, or that u are able to do mroe stuff with contacts..like sports etc

fH0cZIy1aa	write love letters, set up "dates" when you can talk on the computer or on the phone, get a web cam. just do anything to hold his attention and to show you care. Hopefully he's a sweet guy and will do the same for you.|`|r8rykCkGaa	How can we say when we don't know anything about your lives.  Why don't you get a job where he lives or vice-versa or enroll in school in his city or whatever.  But don't go over there unless you are sure he is serious because it will be like all that trouble for nothing and then you will get heart-broken.  Do you have the same religion?  That's important.

0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Stand up straight, throw your shoulders back, and be proud! Honestly, you shouldn't be that concerned about it. The only thing they'll think about you is how lovely you look as you walk down the aisle. And there will be someone right behind you so they'll only look at you for a second. And after that, all attention is going to be on the bride and groom. Try not to worry and just have fun.|`|bJ1jC8Xraa	hey courtney  you know, just pretend that it doesn't look big and have a good time. hope it helps.

WHAT do you want help with????|`|kQnEvrIRaa	I do not understand why being a tomboy effects whether you look nice at the wedding.   Ask your brother if it's a good dress  and that should solve it.
vOUDHws3aa	Well you definitely should seek counseling..granted you can't get that on a Saturday night so I'll answer as best I can.  My ex was deployed for nearly a year and when he came home EVERYTHING was different. You're right, they warn you that then men will change during deployment but they don't warn you that you will. How could you not though? Even though you are married, you've been forced to be a single mother while he was away. Deep down you might even resent him (without realizing it)  for thrusting you into that role even though you know that it couldn't be helped.  You've had to do everything on your own and might even subconsciously now feel that he is in your way or slowing you down. Another source of the problem could be that flip side of you changing- they warned him that he would change but not that you would...or maybe they did and he didn't take it to heart. Maybe he's still trying to interact with you the way he did before your time apart and doesn't realize that that will not work because you're no longer the same.  If you're anything like me, you missed him terribly while he was gone and counted down the days and hours until he came home. When he is stressing you out, do your best to remember the days when you would have given anything to have him there with you. Try your best to be thankful for him everyday because if something were to happen to him one day, you would probably regret the way you are feeling now and would give anything to have him call or come home.  I'm not laying a guilt trip on you, just trying to give you a new perspective.|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	You've learned to live on your own with your daughter and you need to learn how to bring this man that you loved the day you married back into your life.  If he's asking you what's wrong you need to tell him as well as you can on what could be bothering you.  It's hard when they're away no matter how short or long it is.  You've had access to help way before all this happened and in some ways it sounds like someone else has comforted you while your husband was deployed.  I could be wrong and if I am I apologize for that.  Sleeping on the couch won't solve problems.|`|1978e46edc09459d102fc12e39033842aa	when I am tense like that it is usually a sign that there is something that I am not saying that really, really needs to be said.  I don't always have the words.  I wonder what would happen if you shared any part of your anxiety with your husband, couched in the assurance that you love him and want you marriage to work.  Look, you probably want the anxiety and tense mental and physical pain to go away, not your husband.  Somehow you associate the symptoms though very closely with him.  There is something in your marriage that is not being shared and worked through.  Something might be going on in him too that you can't see but are feeling.  You go first to counseling and at some point talk to your therapist about when you should invite your husband.  I think you are very brave to admit your feelings like this.  I know that you prayed daily for his safe return home and are grateful that he is out of harms way.  Good luck.|`|ghLdIUz0aa	i would suggest seeing a doctor for postpartum depression, that may be the case.|`|zDmGngXVaa	Sorry dear but nothing will get done if you can't talk to him about your feelings.  You are making matters worse for yourself and him.  You need to speak up and tell him the real deal or your gonna end up letting it bottle up too much and you will explode and won't find away to control it and trust me you will end up doing and saying things you will regret! You need to convey with your husband! If you can't convey with your husband then you  got the door wide open for you to walk out, if not you then him!|`|yGwda7wPaa	My guess is that there is some unresolved resentment there from being left on your own with a young child so early in a marriage.  Since he was defending our country, you probably didn't feel it was fair to consider how difficult it was for you when he was in Iraq.  From doing the math, it sounds like he wasn't there for the birth of you daughter.  That must have been very difficult.  It also seems like he left right after your wedding, which could not have been easy.  My guess is that while he was gone, you were very busy worrying about him and trying to survive with a baby all on your own.  Now that he is home and out of harms way, your feelings are kicking in and you don't even recognize them or know how to deal with them.  I think counseling would be very helpful.  If you love him, and he loves you, you will get through this.  Marriage is tough, in the best of circumstances, and you have had a tough couple of years.  But, you are blessed to have a husband that loves you and a wonderful daughter.  Be patient with him, and with yourself.  You will get through it.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Get some counseling...I'm sure they provide it for army wives...|`|ARCURrPhaa	well, you didn't say how things have changed so it's hard to give advice... but to play devil's advocate, is it possible that it is YOU that has changed, and maybe your marriage with this guy, after he was gone so long and came back changed, is no longer what you want? It also sounds like you are being somewhat insensitve where he is concerned. He has been through a terrible experience and he needs your support to get through this hard time. You said you don't want to burden him with your feelings but you have to talk to him. Tell him how you feel and maybe you can find some common ground and get back in touch with the way you used to feel. Some marriage counselling couldn't hurt, but hte first step is to talk to him one on one, no matter how tense you feel by his presense. It's also not fair for your daughter to deal with that. Kids pick up on stuff.|`|vNaAZU3gaa	I think you need to ask yourself a question. Why did I marry this guy? Does all he talk about is his work and it drives you crazy? He probably has depression problems|`|AA12187979	Drop the pride, it may have done you and your family good when he was gone but it has no purpsoe now that he's home.  You are suppose to be a team.  Sometimes you will be a team of one other times you will be a team of two.    My wife filled that role for 17-years of my military career, now she has passed and I'm now I am the team of one raising two children.  I am not angry that she is gone, I am thankful for all the time I had her on my team.    Treasure the moments you have, put this behind you, apologize, and never look back.  This nation thanks him for his service.  WE thank you for being a team of one at times.  But now is the time to take pride in caring and sharing with your whole family.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	You hold the key.

SpfAjQkJaa	Hey!  I am sorry. That must suck, I wish her well. He is obviously a jerk, I mean WHO CHEATS ON A PERSON THEY REALLY LOVE??? Gosh, some people don' get that. They think they are human... they make mistakes... blah, blah, blah. That is why they take them back. She probably does not want to be alone and still somewhat cares for him even if he cheated. Truth is, if he loved her he wouldn't of done that. Try approaching her or something... as a friend. Maybe she needs a friend right now. Seriously though, that is sad... :(  I would not take a cheater back.  This is how I take it..  Many things in life are ordinary, right? Love isn't, it should be special. But extrodinary(if that doesn't sound too corny, but I know it does. lol). Why would you settle for anything less than that. Taking back a cheater is not exactly living up to that, right?  Anyways-- no I would not do the same thing.  ~~Steph|`|2XV8U9emaa	hell no, i'd never be that stupid.|`|4C2rZaeOaa	Well every situation is different. In your situation, I believe that everyone deserves a second chance, and if this guy is a jerk the way you say he is...you saying that is only going to make the situation between you and her awkward. she has to realize that he is not the man for her and she has to be fed up. The only thing that you can do is be the best supportive friend that you can be for her!.|`|fg2VTCV1aa	I wouldn't.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	it depends on how she felt about him. if she loved him she may feel she should give him another chance. but if it was me, I would not take them back. but too' I am a guy. and females do not see or think the same way we do. but I have seen female that even know that there boyfriend is cheating on them but try to ignore what is going on. as some will get angry but will take them back. but too, there are some that get angry and will never have anything to do with him again. so I believe it depends on what type of female she is. and how much she cares about him.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	They all lose.
AA11603468	September is a long way off in terms of booking a trip or even something like a long weekend, believe me. My husband and I take quite a few short trips, with never more than a couple of weeks' notice at most. <br>  <br>  Living in So Cal, you are close to alot of great places. Living there, you probably don't even think about all the great spots there are to visit because they're right in your own backyard! I would think you could put together a nice long weekend trip for the two of you that wouldn't cost very much at all, where you 2 can get some alone time plus see some interesting things. I just went to San Diego this winter, and there are lots of things to see there. That's only a short drive from where you are. How about a drive to Sequoia Natl Park? I'd love to see that! <br>  <br>  I can understand being upset about not having a honeymoon, but there is really no reason you can't have one--just stick to someplace in driving distance, and keep it to just a few days.|`|FplTPoAyaa	We didn't have a honeymoon.  We are saving to go to Hawaii or Jamaica on our 10th anniversary. Don't worry about being "embarrassed" to tell people you aren't going on a honeymoon.  Who cares what they think ? Enjoy your special day.  You could go to a nice hotel or B&B for a day or two after your wedding.  Truly, you will be so blissfully happy, you won't care where you spend your first days together as a married couple.  Just enjoy each other.  Why not just take a nice long drive (you live in a beautiful area) and find a little place somewhere along the way to stay overnight ? Do some sightseeing that doesn't cost anything.

Why not save up for a year or two and then have a honeymoon.  I've known lots of couples who have done this and had the time off work and the money in their wallet to have the time of their life.  Not to mention it rekindled their relationship and made it stronger.<br>  <br>  Even if you can't afford a B&B or nice hotel room, why not make something really special at your home.  Have someone come in a clean it for you.  Don't worry about laundry or any house work.  Turn off the phones and computers and just chill with each other.  Enjoy the wedded bliss of being alone with each other in your new home ;)|`|UM9LlPWDaa	My husband and I got married in a small town in Florida. We took the next three days to go to a Comfort Inn, open our gifts and just spend time with each other. 3 days is plenty and I feel good about doing that even to this day. <br>  <br>  Worst case scenario- you can't do it/afford it right now and you do it later (this is what my sister had to do sicne her husband had a job offer and had to report there a few days after the wedding- in Arizona).|`|wADnvKGFaa	Why dont you rent a fancy beach house for a few days?  Dont feel bad for not have the typical honeymoon.  My sister got married last june and she is still in debt over her honeymoon.  She still rents her apartment and has a junk car!  I say do what you can afford or you will regret it later (my sister does).<br>  <br>  Just try to get away even for a small amount of time.  Be happy that you will be with your new husband!|`|5qwJM2G2aa	we didn't have a lot of money either, we pretty much spent our honeymoon traveling to colorado, which was where we were going to be living. The most important thing is that u are spending time with your husband and truly bonding with him. Maybe go to a nearby town and stay at a hotel and go site seeing? <br>  <br>  Or if u have to stay home, buy some nice romantic gifts for each other, lock the door and order take out so u don't run into any friends or family. Make it special, but don't feel too bad about not having a honeymoon. You'll have the rest of your lives to plan special vacations and romantic surprises.  Hope this helps and that you have a great time!!!|`|XUrgcOMDaa	Don't feel bad, dear!  Haven't you ever seen "It's a Wonderful Life"?  :)<br>  <br>  I agree with the first answer.  Do something small and special and enjoy it.  Since when does big and flashy and grand ensure happiness anyway?<br>  <br>  If you can enjoy what you have, however little, from the very beginning... then you and your new spouse will be able to deal with any hardships that life may throw your way.  <br>  <br>  You know, some people have magical, grand weddings, and fabulous honeymoons... and they get disappointed when the rest of the marriage doesn't follow up.  But this is real life.  And you shouldn't be embarrassed.  Since when is a person's wealth a good judge of their value?<br>  <br>  Try to think about it this way.  You don't need "stuff" to make you happy.  You should relish in the fact that you have someone who loves you enough to want to stay with you for life... though all the good times and the bad.|`|hkwBR1moaa	We don't really have a lot of money for a honeymoon either but we found a nice cabin in the mountains and are renting it for a whole week for only $500.00.

Try and find something like that.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	A nearby B&B for 2-3 nights could be a nice getaway.<br>  <br>  My husband and I went on a 9-day Caribbean cruise, and we loved it, but we hardly spend any $$ on the wedding itself, so we could easily afford a nice trip. <br>  <br>  Besides, you ARE having a honeymoon, even if you don't take a trip. There's nothing embarrassing about not going anywhere after the wedding. Different people have different circumstances, and things don't always happen in the most optimal manner. Our cruise was actually a month before we got married - this is just how our schedules worked out. We didn't enjoy it any less, that's for sure - we loved it just the same; and it was actually nice to not have to travel anywhere after the wedding, as we were pretty tired (we had relatives come from out of town, we've been entertaining everyone, and it really takes a toll on you).<br>  <br>  P.S. Personally, I think it's much more embarrassing to spend the money you don't have, and then not being able to pay your bills. To live within your means is not at all embarrassing - it's smart.

When I shave it actually looks like there is hair still there, when its just dark armpits.  Over the years, I have learned to accept it. I don't have money like some of the celebrities where they can pay to have their arm pits bleached.  I don't think you should feel insecure, I mean I don't think at your wedding your arms will be in the air all day??  Also you can try looking for a gown that has mesh arms, if that is an option.|`|eQ1phaDXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  wedding-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  it really worked for me|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you should see a dermatologist.

It's almost a look like cap sleeves that have slipped off your shoulders and are resting right along your biceps...That sort of neckline is really flattering, and is positioned to cover that area...<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you really don't lift your arms way up in the air all that much during the day....In looking back, I didn't lift them any higher than when looping my hands around my husband's neck when we danced...|`|3WQOa4sraa	you can get lace bridal shrug jackets which will hide the area descretely, if you get warm at night time at the party im sure it will be dark enough for people not to notice if your self concious about it<br>  <br>  There are so many types and they do not really ever go out of fashion:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fashionbride.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/lace-jacket.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fashionbride.files.wordpress.com/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbride.com/acatalog/ok_bride04-028.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbride.com/acatalog/ok_bride0...</a>|`|sGP6s7uraa	I think sleeves are coming back, actually.

Honestly I don't think anyone is going to notice. I am sure it is just you thinking it will be noticeable. I think that the only thing the guest will be staring at is how absolutely gorgeous the bride looks. They will be too distracted with how gorgeous your face and hair look. Don't sweat it sweety. Try the lemon juice for like a week as a trial run if it is irritating then don't use it. Also try using baby powder under your arms, it could work? Good luck and don't worry about it :)
ECe1rgsdaa	Me!!!! I am so excited!! Only about 6 months to go!!! <br>  <br>  You are doing good as far as planning, but you should definitely try to book your venues before it is too late. Some one else might already have that date! <br>  <br>  We booked really early (last may!) just to get it out of the way and guarantee our date. I bought my dress last month from David's bridal for $400. I'm making my own invites too! I made the save the dates as well and sent them out a couple weeks ago (with it being Labor day weekend I wanted to be sure people made plans to attend). <br>  <br>  I like the firehouse idea, very unique! I looked into silk flowers too, but I ordered a couple to check the quality, and they were horrible, so just be sure to order some now to check if they are nice. I decided to buy real flowers online in bulk. One of my bridesmaids was a florist so she is going to help make the boutonnieres and stuff. Our dj is one of my moms friends who has a dj business so it is cheap, and I found a photogragher on Craigslist for only $500 and we will get all the pictures on a cd! Everything is basically set... I hope I didn't forget anything!|`|fUBWB88laa	We're getting married September 12 of this year! So kinda close to you :) Everything is done for our wedding...paid for and purchased.

I've got it easy..even planning a wedding from 1500 miles away, it went smooth and it's pretty much complete for being just about 6 months away! GO US!

aT5jaFX8aa	Totally not! You are giving everything up to gain nothing, lose friends, go to a new school, so your sister can "take a chance at the big shot" Does she know the chances of getting into a Hollywood kind of movie, or big production? Its 3/50, 6/100, 12/1000     And does she know how many people audition for those things a day? And what happens when she doesn't make it. IS she just going to move back and have everything the same? If she is done with school and older, why not send just her?    By the way, what are your dreams? Do you want to go to college? Do you want to have some really cool job? Then follow your dreams, and knowing you, it won't get in the way of other people's dreams.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	How about this:    Your sister can take acting classes throughout high school and college and gain experience both in school plays and community theater. When she has graduated, she can go anywhere she wants.     You and your dad have a right to continue to run your lives, live and make a living where you are at. If your mom wants to uproot to persue getting your sister into showbiz, your mom and sister can do that on their own.|`|lbMUNNCuaa	Is your sister involved in the local theatre? Perhaps show her, lovingly, some research about great actors that not only got their start in theatre, but are still currently on stage. Make a pros and cons list with her. It's many childrens dreams to pursue Hollywood...but how realistic is it? Not very. The most important thing is her academics. If mom is willing to go along, sounds like mom may be living through her daughter. Not a very good idea!  Good luck. Try not to worry too much about it. Be supportive of your own dreams. Perhaps your family needs to be more involved in your own community. Sometimes acting is about attention. Being involved creates feelings of fulfillment.|`|jnRdXKVbaa	I think you should convince her that staying is sooooooo much better than moving. And also sometimes you can meet an acting agent in like ohio! i have like a little friend who is 7 and she is sooooo cute! she was on some at&t commercials and she was like in wyoming taking her little career! she found an agent somewhere random so just convince your sis. I'm sure she will realize that. Hope this helps!|`|ofMV2sS5aa	That is rather selfish (of your sister). If acting is something she truly wants she should be willing to move on her own and make her own name for her self. You shouldn't feel guilty about feeling that, it is perfectly logical.  ~K8|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Everybody in LA wants to be an actor, singer, etc....yes, her chances are miniscule but you never know, it could happen!|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You'll have to do whatever your parents want at this stage in your life...
CeoqmywVaa	once i made my mom a mosaic with pictures of all (us) kids and grandkids at various different times eg xmas, birthdays.  Mum loves it and still treasures it!
y9CgveCGaa	I think it would be stalking at the beginning.  If you don't see that then there probably isn't any fatal attraction.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	It will involve stalking|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	Death, usually. Isn't that why they call it "fatal?"|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Sombody dies.|`|AA10803292	going to Hell in a handbasket...|`|wc9viY4Saa	I believe if she said that he was truly in love with her, after she had broken up the love affair...That he could still be obsessing about her at work. I.e. Trying to convince her that he loves her, intimate things that he has told her while they were together etc...I don't believe there are any signs of fatal attraction. If there were any possible signs of fatal attraction, I believe they would be the same signs as true love, such as depression if one was not around the other for a certain amount of time, anxiety, a need to get out of the house without reason etc...Hope this helps...
9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	Personally I wouldn't spend this amount of money without seeing the item in person first.    Also you maybe able to haggle with the jewlery store by showing them this item could be bought cheaper.     Keep in mind you need to be comparing apples to apples. The ring needs to be the same quality or they would just point this out as justification for charging more.     Keep in mind the four C's. Cut, Clarity, Carat and Color.     Cut is one of the most important to me. I have an ideal cut and even though it's a G in color when you compare it to a E Good cut my diamond outshines it.     Also next is Clarity. A much smaller stone with a better clarity rating would cost more than a larger stone with less clarity.  The clarity also contributes to the cost and how nice the stone looks over all.    Carat is preference . Some girls would love a huge stone and some like a smaller.|`|P3e2kJtwaa	beautiful! :)  and if you can find it cheaper online, and know for sure it's the same ring, go for it.  Sometimes if you go in to the jewelry store and show them proof that it's cheaper online, they'll give you that price in the store.  We did that with my wedding band :) Saved lotsa money that way|`|8kdjvWAxaa	It is a good idea because my fiance bought my ring online he saw it on www.theknot.com went to the website of the ring holder and my ring is beautiful and it fits perfect. Now i don't know if its for everybody but i think you should consider looking in the stores first (that's what we did) and then check online if the ring is cheaper than in the stores. I think the 3 stone white gold ring is beautiful. Good luck:)|`|EJJMXnf0aa	noo, its better to visually see the ring before buying.|`|CaPZrWVWaa	I have a friend who LOVES buying jewelry online but is never satisfied. The diamonds are cloudy, and have many flaws.     Your best bet is printing out the picture and having a jeweler make the ring IF you want a quality one.     However, if you are satisfied with it, and it fits your budget, I'm sure the ring will be most loved.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	If you do buy it from here I would recommend you go for the SI2 or VS2 ones or you will see the inclusions and that kinda ruins it for the girl.  Personally I would be wary of any diamond online that did not come with a lab certificate from GIA, ASG or DCLA.    If you want to buy it online go ahead, but you might try showing the jeweller the website first to try to bargain them down.|`|nujen4dmaa	I bought my engagement ring online no problems.  I did a little research first so I new what I wanted.      I went to a few different stores first and they showed me diamonds of varying color and clarity.  I got an idea of what I wanted from this exercise and then went online.    You could tell the online vendor what your budget is and they will find the best cut stone that falls within your budget.    I dealt with http://whiteflash.com who I found through pricescope.com    I have now made several purchases through them!    IdealD|`|8be367fe78353833dcfd48377d2502ecaa	Do extensive research on the company.  Be sure you know how to return the ring if you need to.  If you decide to buy it from the company, be sure to take it to be diamond tested independantly when you recieve it.  Buy the warranty if they have them and know how to use it!  It's a beautiful ring, but sometimes the extra money is worth the piece of mind you get.  Not to mention the perks...for instance if you buy from Helzberg they clean your ring for life and check the stones every six months to ensure they are holding tight.  Congrats and good luck!  (I agree...maybe the store will match the price!)|`|AA11760899	My Fiance bought mine online. Its beautiful and I love it! He went to bidz.com.   What you should do is do your research and make sure the place or person you are buying it from is legit. and make sure they have a return policy in case you are not happy with it when you get it. My Fiance only spent $350 on my ring and it has real diamonds in it. It was appraised for $3600! Go figure.   In my opinion though, as long as you love your fiance and like the ring, it shouldn't matter how much it costs. Dont listen to these crazy materialistic people who say it has to be a percentage of what he makes. What a crazy world we live in.|`|ThqwfJcXaa	buy one at a pawn shop . someone else deals aer really good and you have 48 hr to let some one look at it|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I think it's a great idea to buy things online as long as you buy from a reputable jeweler.  Two of my future SIL's bought their diamonds on bluenile.com and were more than happy with their purchases.  I know one of them took hers to a local place to be appraised and it appraised more than $10K what they paid for it.  bluenile.com has been voted the best online jeweler by Forbes magazine every year since 2000.  I have never heard of the jewelery site you have listed above, but I'd check on the Better Business Bureau to see if anyone has complained about them.
CU2fjELvaa	i disagree with your MIL. you can love someone and divorce them you made a mistake and you realized it. its your decision if you divorced this man but no one can tell you how you feel because you cant even help the way you feel about someone weather its your husband or boyfriend. anything of that sort. I AGREE WITH YOU. good luck :)|`|EAxjVxTEaa	You can still love him. Like you always love your first love. Just because he hasn't gotten in touch doesn't mean he has stopped loving you or thinking about you. He is probably hurt and don't want to forgive you. Look at it from his side. I mean would you get in touch with him if he did this to you? Also are you sure you still love him and not just missing the life you guys had together? I mean its hard getting back out there and finding true love again especially with a child but its not impossible just hard. You could be just lonely. You really should be positive before you try and get back with him. Besides he may not want to get back with you after what you put him through. To me it seems you are just a little lonely right now and scared to get back on the horse and find love again. Just give it a little time it will happen. If its God's will it will happen. This is a lesson you will never forget.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	what is a mil?|`|8e172b6b03562dfb30dd48d18dae04baaa	You need some time to get over it and move on.  And you will get past this.  At first you will miss the rituals, history, patterns of your relationship.  It takes a while to get used to being alone.  Since he hasn't made any effort to make things right, you did the right thing.  He wasn't there for you in the first place. You may have divorced quickly, but I am  sure you had  accumulated a lot of information before you made  that "quick" decision.  These feelings will pass.  The Christmas holidays are the hardest.  By next year you may have someone else to share Christmas with.  None of this should be your MIL's business.  Don't talk to her any more about him.|`|zDmGngXVaa	It can happen! I've seen people divorce knowing they love each other it was just other things that went wrong and was ruining the marriage! I know if my husband and I ever got divorced - I would still love him no matter what happen between us! I am still in love with my children's fathers! But only because he'd given me something I couldn't have on my own! My husband knows that and he doesn't make a fuss about it! Actually no one, I know does. They all say it's normal to still love someone even though you are the one breaking it off!|`|diQ0oodqaa	Yes, you can divorce someone and still love them. If the divorce is not final and you want to be still legally  married to him, stop the divorce. If you think you should go on with your life since he left and you haven't heard from him, go thru with it.    Either way, just because you still love him won't make him change the ways that caused you to file for divorce in first place.|`|V780bRMRaa	Of course you can still love him. Many people still love the person they divorced. Him and you have history and children and you'll always love him no matter what anyone says.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I think that you can love someone but get a divorce.  The divorce can end on good terms.  Your husband left and is not trying to work on the relationship at this point and you should do the same.  Do not listen to your mother in law about not loving him because you filed for a divorce.|`|eUf9e81eaa	yes it is possible.It could be that the man was being fooled by someone else.|`|AA11125475	She's wrong to judge someones love for someone. No one can say how much one person loves another and to what depth. But it's obvious the love you hold for him is not felt the same or returned by him since he just left and didn't even want to work things out, which is the first step that should have been taken instead of being so willing to throw the marriage away.   Your husband is showing his immaturity by not coming to terms with the fact that he has a child to take care of.|`|jTsQkuhHaa	you know what you feel...|`|4cc28qsSaa	It looks like you just had a rough time. All couples have something that they don't like about each other.     Yes, you can still love him.

srNze5uIaa	Seriousely, you accepted someone who never wanted you any good? don't you see that?<br>  <br>  everytime you found a BF, he made everything to break you up, if you can't see how much he's only good to be slaped, then this unwanted love is blinding you.<br>  <br>  Love comes and go. There is no such a thing as eternal love, or true love because it all eventually fades away. You got yourself with a man who wants to deprive you from your own life and freedom.<br>  If you want to be happy and find true love, open your eyes at his stupidity, selfishness and evilness, and quit it definitely.<br>  <br>  It's like you're his object, that he can use, then put carlessly into a closet, making sure you stay all alone, before using you again when he feels like it.<br>  <br>  But I think he can be dangerous if you decide to quit him definitely, so be careful.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	this guy is a LOSER<br>  run run away as fast as you can<br>  maybe your dad can have some words with him<br>  or maybe your family has a cop as a friend<br>  do whateveer it takes to get this loser out of your life<br>  immediately|`|fKuvMPCiaa	He sounds like a douche.

Dump him. He shouldn't be messing with you like that. If he really cared about you, he wouldn't be doing this to you, and wouldn't give a **** what people say. Dump him.<br>  <br>  He's playing you.<br>  <br>   You can do better then this guy. Don't settle for these kind of selfish jerks. Trust me.
AA11447210	Of course they aren't obligatory...it's just a way for your friends/family to help you celebrate and to help you gather the typical items needed/desired to start your new household. If you don't want a shower or don't really need those kinds of gifts, then you are certainly free to request no showers be thrown.|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Are bachelor parties necessary?  I think not.  What do you want to do? They are based on old outdated traditions.|`|TMhVClBgaa	showers are for celebrating the once in a life time event.  it's just a way that every one of your friends come together and say congratulations|`|AA11138696	You do not have to have one but remember the showers are not just about you.  It is one of the few ritual for gathering female members of the family that we have in American culture.  It is a way of passing on traditions and a beautiful memory for you in times to come.  Hopefully you will only do this once so why shortchange yourself  have your shower and every other party you can get and enjoy the hell out of this wonderful time.  The road takes a different turn from here on out so make the most of this season in your life.|`|QX3zn5Tqaa	If there are people that want to honor your impending nuptials, how about you all get together in a service event for your community? Instead of receiving gifts (that you don't want), you could ask everyone to get together to paint a house, clean up a park, do yard work for the elderly, buy a book for your local library. If this idea interests you, you can check for charitable events in your area at VolunteerMatch.org.|`|s6YZpAopaa	I dont think they are. When i get married I probably wont have one. To be honest, I grew up with all brothers and never really acquired a lot of female friends. It would be awkward to have one so I probably wont. So do you have to have one? No. It is your wedding and you are not obligated to throw a shower if you dont want to. Never do something because "well other people would like it". Its not their wedding, its yours. If you want to have a lil get together with the ones you do know thats fine. For example just go to a restaurant one saturday night or something. Whatever you want, doesnt have to be anyting fancy or over done. Wish you a lot of Luck and Congrats!|`|mXIVMmPSaa	Really, nothing's necessary but a fiance, some kind of official, and the marriage license. Why don't you just elope? Then you can avoid all the traditional trappings of a wedding.  That being said, the bride isn't the one who decides to have a shower. Her female friends or relatives offer to plan and host it for her and then she can ungraciously refuse it if she wants. But since you don't really have any of those, it shouldn't be a concern.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Nope, they are not necessary. Just let your relatives and friends know that you don't want one.|`|8kdjvWAxaa	well, its only really for gifts but you don't need to have one.|`|4CsGde1qaa	As long as you can refresh you body and skin.|`|AA10824931	A lot of young girls are skipping the showers and etc and having a girls weekend out in Las Vegas.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	No, there are not.|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	no - but it's fun as long as somebody volunteers to organize it

apvPWgNzaa	I would also like to know how that was paid for. This is total irresponsibility on the part of the doctor. He should have his license lifted and put on trial for ethics violations.  The mother should be locked up in a lunatic asylum and the key thrown away.  There should be a complete investigation of this and some strict laws passed.  I am sure that the taxpayers are getting stuck somewhere along the line on this one.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Aside from the fact that in vitro fertilization is expensive the hospital bills must be staggering. And, how ethical was it for the doctor to do that to a single woman with 6 other children? It blows my mind.|`|y21VcTjDaa	I'd be interested to know where she gets her money too.  Even though she lives with her mother, she would still need to contribute majorly to care for 14 kids!!!  Her education must be costing her too, doesn't it?  And from what I hear, in vitro is super expensive too.  She must h ave some wealthy guy paying her bills!    But I think the bigger question is what sort of doctor performs in vitro on a woman that many times?????  It's something that really should have his medical license under review.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Who knows? That's some crazy s***.

In California, there are laws prohibiting a residence from having too many cats and/or dogs (and it's WAY less than 14) b/c the pets won't get the proper care. And now this single mom has 14???? If she wanted that many kids, why didn't she try to adopt them? Here's why: b/c no social services office with half a brain would let 14 kids live with a single mom in a 3 bedroom house.|`|6fce40fc087ca94205e0e0e2743c64f5aa	does it really matter either way why or how.  its her life and she should do what she wants no matter what.. yes I think its crazy and yes maybe irresponsible but hey its her life after all and who are we to judge her for it...  just think if you judge her now, remember that the day your day comes to being judge... people just need to worry about their own life's..|`|5FH5EibEaa	she has a problem....addiction i would say, she is a very educated woman, who knows she might have a suger-daddy|`|8YadWefXaa	I don't have a problem having kids, but I think I might try invitro so the government/everyone else will want to give me free money too.|`|AA11525670	I think she has psych issues...

Let's face it; we all don't make millions of dollars a year, and the odds are that most of us won't receive a large windfall inheritance either. However, that doesn't mean that we can't build sizeable wealth  it'll just take some time. If you're young, time is on your side and retiring a millionaire is achievable. Read on for some tips on how to increase your savings and work toward this goal.     Stop Senseless Spending   Unfortunately, people have a habit of spending their hard-earned cash on goods and services that they don't need. Even relatively small expenses, such as indulging in a gourmet coffee from a premium coffee shop every morning, can really add up  and decrease the amount of money you can save. Larger expenses on luxury items also prevent many people from putting money into savings each month.      That said, it's important to realize that it's usually not just one item or one habit that must be cut out in order to accumulate sizable wealth (although it may be). Usually, in order to become wealthy one must adopt a disciplined lifestyle and budget. This means that people who are looking to build their nest eggs need to make sacrifices somewhere  this may mean eating out less frequently, using public transportation to get to work and/or cutting back on extra, unnecessary expenses.  This doesn't mean that you shouldn't go out and have fun, but you should try to do things in moderation  and set a budget if you hope to save money. Fortunately, particularly if you start saving young, saving up a sizeable nest egg only requires a few minor (and relatively painless) adjustments to your spending habits.    Fund Retirement Plans ASAP  When individuals earn money, their first responsibility is to pay current expenses such as the rent or mortgage expenses, food and other necessities. Once these expenses have been covered, the next step should be to fund a retirement plan or some other tax-advantaged vehicle.  Unfortunately, retirement planning is an afterthought for many young people. Here's why it shouldn't be: funding a 401(k) and/or a IRA early on in life means you can contribute less money overall and actually end up with significantly more in the end than someone who put in much more money but started later.  How much difference will funding a vehicle such as a Roth IRA early on in life make?  If you're 23 years old and deposit $3,000 per year (that's only $250 each month!) in a Roth IRA earning an 8% average annual return, you will have saved $985,749 by the time you are 65 years old due to the power of compounding. If you make a few extra contributions, it's clear that a $1 million goal is well within reach. Also keep in mind that this is mostly interest  your $3,000 contributions only add up to $126,000.  Now, suppose that you wait an additional 10 years to start contributing. You have a better job and you know you've lost some time, so you contribute $5,000 per year. You get the same 8% return and you aim to retire at 65. When you reach age 65, you will have saved $724,753. That's still a sizeable fund, but you had to contribute $160,000 just to get there  and it's nowhere near the $985,749 you could've had for paying much less.    Improve Tax Awareness  Sometimes, individuals think that doing their own taxes will save them money. In some cases, they might be right. However, in other cases it may actually end up costing them money because they fail to take advantage of the many deductions available to them.  Try to become more educated as far as what types of items are deductible. You should also understand when it makes sense to move away from the standard deduction and start itemizing your return.  However, if you're not willing or able to become very well educated filing your own income tax, it may actually pay to hire some help, particularly if you are self employed, own a business or have other circumstances that complicate your tax return.    Renting Versus Buying  At some point in our lives, many of us rent a home or an apartment because we cannot afford to purchase a home, or because we aren't sure where we want to live for the longer term. And that's fine. However, renting is often not a good long-term investment because buying a home is a good way to build equity.  Unless you intend to move in a short period of time, it generally makes sense to consider putting a down payment on a home. (At least you would likely build up some equity over time and the foundation for a nest egg.)    Buying Expensive Cars  There's nothing wrong with purchasing a luxury vehicle. However, individuals who spend an inordinate amount of their incomes on a vehicle are doing themselves a disservice  especially since this asset depreciates in value so rapidly.  How rapidly does a car depreciate?      Obviously, this depends on the make, model, year and demand for the vehicle, but a general rule is that a new car loses 15-20% of its value per year. So, a two-year old car will be worth 80-85% of its purchase price; a three-year old car will be worth 80-85% of its two-year-old value.  In short, especially when you are young, consider buying something practical and dependable that has low monthly payments  or that you can pay for in cash. In the long run, this will mean you'll have more money to put toward your savings  an asset that will appreciate, rather than depreciate like your car.        Don't Sell Yourself Short  Some individuals are extremely loyal to their employers and will stay with them for years without seeing their incomes take a jump. This can be a mistake, as increasing your income is an excellent way to boost your rate of saving.  Always keep your eye out for other opportunities and try not to sell |`|2v0iRkudaa	my pokemon brings al da nerdz to da yard   and der like ya wanna play cards?

This theory tries to define and explain the fundamental particles that make the universe what it is. It combines elements from Einstein's theory of relativity with quantum theory. It also deals with three of the four basic forces of the universe: strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force and electromagnetic force. It does not address the effects of gravity, the fourth fundamental force.  Engineers build the Large Hadron Collider  Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images  Constructing the Large Hadron Collider    The Standard Model makes several predictions about the universe, many of which seem to be true according to various experiments. But there are other aspects of the model that remain unproven. One of those is a theoretical particle called the Higgs boson particle.    The Higgs boson particle may answer questions about mass. Why does matter have mass? Scientists have identified particles that have no mass, such as neutrinos. Why should one kind of particle have mass and another lack it? Scientists have proposed many ideas to explain the existence of mass. The simplest of these is the Higgs mechanism. This theory says that there may be a particle and a corresponding mediating force that would explain why some particles have mass. The theoretical particle has never been observed and may not even exist. Some scientists hope the events created by the LHC will also uncover evidence for the existence of the Higgs boson particle. Others hope that the events will provide hints of new information we haven't even considered yet.    Big Bang on a Small Scale  By smashing protons together hard and fast enough, the LHC will cause protons to break apart into smaller atomic subparticles. These tiny subparticles are very unstable and only exist for a fraction of a second before decaying or recombining with other subparticles. But according to the Big Bang theory, all matter in the early universe consisted of these tiny subparticles. As the universe expanded and cooled, these particles combined to form larger particles like protons and neutrons.    A-nother question scientists have about matter deals with early conditions in the universe. During the earliest moments of the universe, matter and energy were coupled. Just after matter and energy separated, particles of matter and antimatter annihilated each other. If there had been an equal amount of matter and antimatter, the two kinds of particles would have canceled each other out. But fortunately for us, there was a bit more matter than antimatter in the universe. Scientists hope that they'll be able to observe antimatter during LHC events. That might help us understand why there was a miniscule difference in the amount of matter versus antimatter when the universe began.    Dark matter might also play an important role in LHC research. Our current understanding of the universe suggests that the matter we can observe only accounts for about 4 percent of all the matter that must exist. When we look at the movement of galaxies and other celestial bodies, we see that their motions suggest there's much more matter in the universe than we can detect. Scientists named this undetectable material dark matter. Together, observable matter and dark matter could account for about 25 percent of the universe. The other three-quarters would come from a force called dark energy, a hypothetical energy that contributes to the expansion of the universe. Scientists hope that their experiments will either provide further evidence for the existence of dark matter and dark energy or provide evidence that could support an alternate theory.    That's just the tip of the particle physics iceberg, though. There are even more exotic and counterintuitive things the LHC might turn up.|`|7d8a232729948aa43d4cfa13bdc6648faa	The Wikimedia Foundation's 2009 steward election has started. Please vote.

The film is essentially a backstage musical revue, featuring high-budget sets and cinematography in the MGM musical tradition. The film stars Eleanor Powell and Robert Taylor and features Buddy Ebsen, George Murphy, Judy Garland, Sophie Tucker, Raymond Walburn, Robert Benchley and Binnie Barnes.    The film is most notable for young Garland's performance of "Dear Mr. Gable/You Made Me Love You", a tribute to Clark Gable which turned the teenage singer, who had been toiling in obscurity for a couple of years, into an overnight sensation, leading eventually to her being cast in The Wizard of Oz.

Concerned for the horse's well-being, she sneaks aboard a train taking the horse and its caretakers to New York City. En route she meets talent agent Steve Raleigh (Robert Taylor) who, impressed with her dancing and singing, sets her on the road to stardom and romance blossoms between the two. A subplot involves a boarding house for performers run by Sophie Tucker, who is trying to find a big break for young Judy Garland.

Not smoking, daily exercise, moderate drinking, being married (and sometimes not being married) have all had their champions.    But, at the ripe old age of 105, Clara Meadmore could trump the lot: a life of celibacy.   Miss Meadmore says she has always been too busy for relationships and thought of physical intimacy as a 'hassle'.   The former secretary, who will celebrate her birthday tomorrow, said she had no regrets about remaining a virgin and had turned down several marriage proposals.    Miss Meadmore said: 'People have asked whether I am a homosexual and the answer is no. I have just never been interested in or fancied having sex.    'I imagine there is a lot of hassle involved and I have always been busy doing other things. I've never had a boyfriend - I've never been bothered about relationships.'    She added: 'When I was a girl you only had sex with your husband - and I never married.    'I've always had lots of platonic friendships with men but never felt the need to go further than that or marry.    'Everything seems so fast these days. I don't know a lot about young people or the way they do things. I'm sure it's very different. I made my mind up at the age of 12 never to marry and I've not gone back on that.'    Miss Meadmore was born in Glasgow in 1903, two years after the death of Queen Victoria. She remembers hearing about the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 and the outbreak of the First World War. Her family emigrated when she was seven, first to Egypt, then Canada and later New Zealand. But Miss Meadmore returned to Britain alone in her twenties and worked as a secretary and housekeeper.      She said: 'I grew up in an era where little girls were to be seen and not heard so I had to learn to stand up for myself and earn my own living.    'Some men don't like that in a woman and before long I was too old to marry anyway.'    Instead of boyfriends, Miss Meadmore filled her time with reading, gardening, cooking and listening to the radio.    Yesterday her friend and former neighbour Josie Harvey, 72, said: 'When she was a little girl she told her mother that she would never marry and for Clara no marriage meant no sex. She is fiercely independent.    'Maybe never having a man to get under her feet has kept her young all these years. She has her hobbies and her friends and that is all she needs.    'She has always believed in doing things her own way and that has allowed her to live a long life. Clara listens to Radio 4 all day long and knows what is going on in the world better than most people in their 30s.'    Miss Meadmore trained as a secretary and served in the Army, undertaking administrative duties in Egypt during the Second World War. She was one of the first members of the Youth Hostel Association and a keen member of the Women's Institute.    Her only surviving family are two nieces in New Zealand who keep in touch by post.    Miss Meadmore will celebrate reaching 105 with a card from the Queen and a glass of wine with her friends at the Perran Bay nursing home in Perranporth, Cornwall.    But she is determined not to let things get out of hand. 'I'm hardly likely to get drunk and do something silly at my age,' she said.

If u dont branch out and get other opinions about not jus finacial problems, but other circumstances in life, how will u know if ur makin tha right decision or not?|`|1MGXHYq9aa	It depends. Are you replacing your partner with this other person for advice? Are you giving intimate details? <br>  <br>  Are you willing to be honest and open with your partner about exactly what was discussed? If you wouldn't tell him, then it is cheating.|`|aGXankr2aa	Not as far as I'm concerned, it's just a friendship.  It's a little different if you're not also discussing the matters with your partner though.|`|38OYfx1haa	I don't think so.  From what you explained, there doesn't seem to be any sort of emotional connection between the people.|`|dHDe64FUaa	F@@k no, you are too sensitive, you betta louse your self.|`|ISPIa0n5aa	no, it's not cheating.  you're asking for advice.|`|S5x6KNHraa	its ok to talk to people or guys some one that u can trust that's not cheating having sex with him is cheating|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	I don't consider it cheating, but I do however consider it a betrayal of trust. I don't think this woman's husband/partner would appreciate her discussing these personal financial matters with anyone else - regardless of who the person it (obviously in this case its her male co-worker). Its nobody's business only theirs and both partners in the relationship should respect that. However, it could be worse - she could be telling her male co-worker that her partner was crap in bed!! lol!|`|n8Db77zbaa	Wow people!!! What is the real definition of cheating these days? <br>  <br>  No, it isn't cheating all you're doing is confiding in someone you might find to be willing to lesten when you vent. You aren't going off on a permiscuous rampage or anything, I don't understand how that would fall into the category of "cheating".<br>  <br>  Although, I believe sometimes you need to be carefully selective in the information you provide to others. I would never speak of my financial problems with a co-worker. It may be your preference to let people know about your perosnal business, but do you know if it's your significant others?|`|QrQWQ1nraa	It's not cheating; but it is offensive to your significant other (as bad as cheating) if you have not talked the problem over with your significant other first; or you tried to talk to them but got nowhere then gave up and then went to talk to your co-worker without their consent.  Worse would be if the co-worker & you had a flirting history (does not matter if it was a secret or if everyone in the office knew about; nor if you never acted upon the few flirting incident).  It just shows a sign of disrespect in the eyes of the significant other.|`|59fdLKz0aa	Hhhhmmm ... In my household it would be TABOO. My hubby and I would have to agree there was a problem, and then agree on who to go to for help and go to the helper together to ask questions, then decide together what to do. <br>  <br>  If I were stressed at work and worried and a man asked me whats wrong, I would tell him It is a personal matter and thus none of his dam business. If I am a partner in the relationship, and I am vulnerable, then the whole partnership becomes vulnerable. <br>  <br>  That is where the term BOUNDARIES comes in. <br>  <br>  Only your hubby can decide if you have done the right thing, and ONLY his opinion matters.|`|I4tulYTzaa	I do not think talking to another person is cheating. If in your heart and mind you absolutely know you love only your spouse/boyfriend, then it is absolutely not cheating.<br>  But for me personally I do not like it when my wife, friends or anyone talks about me. Good things are maybe ok. But my finances, feelings, problems, needs, sex life, personal comments, health and thoughts are my business. I only share them for the most part with my wife. And she now understands that I really do not like her discussing these issues with other people. And she does not.<br>  I would venture to guess that they are saying you cheated but are really saying that you said stuff to others when you really should not have.|`|PPLxDKYwaa	I don't think it's necessary at all to speak to a male co-worker about you and your significant other's personal matters.<br>  <br>   Men have pride in being a provider for the family so if ur out and about speaking about personal matters such as that then I would consider that inappropriate.....keep those things between you and ur partner not some guy co-worker who can later on "look-down" on ur husband .. sort-to-speak|`|rgFM1VIZaa	People will give you that no matter if you are talking to a co-worker for advice or not. But No, it is not consider cheating. Honestly, I would disregard what other people are saying and keep doing what you are doing, as far as you know, you are not doing anything wrong..Right?<br>  <br>  RIGHT!|`|AA11988503	It's not cheating. However, if you start to attach emotionally to these men on more than a platonic level, some people consider that just as bad as doing something physical with another man. Being emotionally unfaithful can do just as much harm to a relationship.|`|nnaqMgYRaa	yes, personal life should stay personal, and you are giving out personal information about your life, like cheating.|`|YFXusnT1aa	No it is not, but it is undermining your partner's trust|`|pKBCzK5Waa	no, that doesnt make any sense to be cheating. i dont know what that black girl is talking about either, aha.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	how is that cheating? lol<br>  the 2 people are crazy|`|PQwRl27Jaa	simple it's notcheating ok, dont listen 2 those 2 people ok.|`|FzFSzilmaa	nope, not cheating... it is finding a friend to vent with...|`|f79c26b7044dd5c4e629f481f9756330aa	hell no|`|7Et2fqH1aa	I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHYL HIGHLY don't think it's cheating.<br>  Who ever is asking for the advice is simply just ASKING FOR ADVICE!<br>  there's nothing wrong with asking for help.<br>  just because the person you are is asking is from the opposite sex, it doesn't make a difference.<br>  it wouldn't matter whether your asking a dog or a guy for help or advice. it still isn't cheating.<br>  As long as you are ONLY asking for help or advice and noooo more.<br>  <br>  if the 2 other people that are upset or believe that is considered cheating, are probably jealous or don't have the same opinions. Let them believe what they want, as long as you know you aren't and don't have any bad intentions, its all that matters.|`|nXgc461baa	No, Definitely not. It is no fun being in such a strict relationship where you are not allowed to talk to other people of the opposite sex. This couple clearly has trust issues if this is the case. They should be able to have close friends of either sex, as long as of course it goes nothing beyond friendship. Each person needs there own freedom and the other person should be able to trust them with that freedom.|`|sVWVEnkkaa	I don't consider that cheating.  I do,  however, think that talking to your coworker about your financial matters is a bit too personal.  Quite frankly, it's none of his business what goes on financially in your household,  even if he does give good advice.  Leave that kind of talk to close family or a financial counselor.|`|3ieqwgWGaa	its not cheating <br>  <br>  definition of cheating: you sleep or do promiscuous things with the opposite sex|`|iOwIULltaa	That is not cheating!!!! Its just a little mean to talk to a man about finnancial problems and home b/c its kind of saying your husband cant solve this problems. It hurts a mans ego|`|AbQCkNHuaa	No.. They aren't touching each other or flirting a lot. So there is no reason they should think its cheating. Maybe they are just very jealous people.|`|AA12227599	No, it's not cheating, it's venting. don't listen to those people, they obviously have issues.|`|cwXfF3SNaa	I'm gonna use a joke that some comedian used...    "Unless someone leaves that place satisfied?   It's not cheating..."|`|wJk6FS0Yaa	i wouldnt say this was cheating , cheating means your having sex with another man id say , he sounds like just a good friend to me ,|`|kfM7ppWpaa	Not Cheating.|`|xkVeB14naa	No I dont think thats cheating!! Its simply talking.|`|kjzfL86caa	nawh dudee.|`|AmVvWChdaa	Not at all.|`|ZEOUmHLVaa	Yes|`|2qyIInrdaa	go for it|`|FfFkyHSIaa	what? NO those two other people are morons!!!! fK people can even have friends anymore!|`|fDncsn8qaa	well if my b/f was talking to some chick i didnt even know at home id be concerned and jealous!  id probable get mad too.
9YlQ5HEhaa	No, I couldn't. Do you want women to lift you?|`|qegWdsNLaa	In 2003, a Chinese female Olympic weight lifter lifted 150kg.  That's 330lbs.  So yes, women could lift your 130lbs.|`|OETH5mGJaa	ya|`|rnMZHdCraa	erm.. maybe? i dunno.|`|12a0272242edadf74177f3fc2ca00636aa	What a stupid question ,dont know where you live but here in Australia women according to union rules can only lift 13 kilograms|`|cgXOR6LKaa	Haha random. :) But probably not. I lift 50-70 pounds around work (I'm a server at a pizza place) and that makes my back hurt. Ha, I'm weak. :)|`|hLozB0MUaa	ummmmm no! hahaha i weigh around like between 115 and 120 so i can't lift more than i weigh (:|`|S0XPrJ2laa	depends on the angle
T3b4I4kXaa	Your mother is a classic ADDICT... meaning that the only thing she is concerned with is getting her next fix, and she will lie, cheat and steal to get it. She would sell you off to get her next fix. At least she is acknowledging this. Stay out of her orbit and don't fault her for letting this substance run her life.    Don't waste any energy on hating anyone... it does nothing whatsoever for you, and actually attracts more crap like that into your life. Don't let your messed-up mother color your life.   You move on to lead a good life and build your education and career as best you can to give yourself stability. When you do this for yourself, you can approach all of your relationships from a position of strength.|`|3IXj7jQNaa	how old are you?  my best friend well,ex is doing this to her daughter and this is what i see coming for her and she doesn't care. girl is 8. sooo sad. i am sorry for you.|`|Hx2raTNQaa	omg hOW  rude that isnt wrong @ all|`|suE2Y3afaa	Oh my that's harsh! :O  I don't really trust my mom after the GIANT lie she came clean about 2 yrs later.

No a lot of people go through it.|`|180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	It's truly understandable that you would hate your mother, have trouble trusting other people and have trouble even thinking about forgiving her.  And it's okay that you feel that way.  For now.      There will come a day in the future though that you will need to let go of the hate and anger, not for her sake, but for your own.  Holding on to such toxic feelings will eventually make you a bitter young woman and will taint many of the joys that life has to offer you.      You may not think that true right now, but you will one day.  When that day comes, get some counseling, so that you can get those feelings out in the open.      I wish you luck in life.|`|rVdcXJ8aaa	Ooo Okay well first of all let me say this thoug my situations t=not the same as urs I kina know what ur going through...and well u don't have to like her but I think for ur sake u shouldn't hate her cuz Hate hurts u more than whoever ur hating|`|fCc1vqkNaa	owh..  ok..  im so sorry 4 u..  i know how it feels to be in that situation although i never been in it..  its not your fault if u hate her..  ur mum (or should i say its ur adopted mum) shouldnt have done it in a first place..  but maybe she had gone through a terrible stage in her life..  that kind of people wont admit that she/he needs a company..  just be by her side and make her feels that she's not alone..  its ur responsible to comfort her,talk 2 her,face to face..  if she's ur real mum,then just remember those sweet memories uve gone through with her..  =)  remember,she's d one who gave birth 2 u n raise u up..  hope this helps my dear..  =)    by the way,where's ur real mum?|`|FeqMZsQaaa	It's completely wrong for her to say something like that to you. I wouldn't say you should hate her or hold a grudge against her. I would just put her out of my life.    When people are under the influence of drugs they say stupid things like that. I know from experience, not a parent though, that sometimes even when they get straight, that the good ol' silent treatment will be a breakthrough.    If one day she does come back to you clean and sober though, just be willing to listen to her. She might be serious about getting things straight and you might regret not getting to know her.|`|mLHW6Je1aa	Whether you forgive your mother or not is not the issue. The fact that you feel sorry for yourself and can't trust anyone because of this is something you should speak to a counsellor about. They will help you make sense of all those feelings you have right now.     It's okay to hate her and refuse to forgive her. It's good that you can get your feelings out, rather than keeping them inside of you.  In time you may be able to forgive her, but for now, it's really good that you can express your feelings. If you're concerned about hating her, you are probably feeling guilty because you feel this way. At 17 it's normal to feel the way you do towards all parents. Don't beat yourself up over how you're feeling.  There is nothing  wrong with you for feeling like you do. In time you may see that she did the best she knew how to do.  Please talk to a counsellor so that they can help you work through all of those emotions.  There are people out there that will support you and offer you help.|`|71qGan9Raa	If you don't want to forgive her, then don't!!!!   But....you do need to forgive yourself or you're going to end up just like her.|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	I think your feelings are totally understandable and even though I might not want to use the word "hate", I could not forgive my mother in your situation.     Has she changed though? How old are you?    EDIT    If you got adopted, there should be a way for you to reveal what your mom is doing and how badly it is affecting your life. This is not something you'd expect from a parent who wants an adopted child, they should be much more responsible.|`|zdpp7cubaa	I'm not sure how right or wrong anything is, but I do know until you let go of your hatred for her, the whole situation is going to eat you up inside. I did not have the best childhood and it turned me into a very angry, distrustful adult. It caused problems in every relationship I ever had. One day though I realized that hating people and my anger towards the situation was only making me bitter and eating me up inside. So I decided to let it all go and try and move on with my life. I still have trust issues, but at least my anger towards the world has gone away. I wouldn't suggest you forgive your mother for her sake, but I would suggest you forgive her for yours. This doesn't mean you have to have contact with her, if you are an adult and out of her house I would just cut her out of your life completely because you don't need unhealthy people in your life.|`|l0xnIquFaa	its fine to hate your mom, most ppl would say 'she gave birth to u, u owe her respect' u owe her nothing bc it seems like she gave u nothing, i would hate her too. im sorry that you are going through that, take a deep breath, everything is ok

I would tell my spouse that he is not in control of me and i will speak to my parents if and when i feel like it and my parents would be told the same.... you are not in control of me anymore and i will be with who i want to be with. IF your spouse and parents both love you undeniably , they wouldn't honestly make you choose. <br>  <br>  idk if i could even make that choice though if i was forced too. <br>  <br>  great question!!!|`|IKXZZDH9aa	MY family started with my wife.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Well they both sound selfish to make you choose. Can't they just get over themselves and realize they have a shared love of you in common?<br>  <br>  If they made their love conditional by saying either me or the other person, then I would leave them both to their own devices.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Spouse - as the other poster says, you can't choose your parents but you can choose your spouse.

No question.  I didn't pick my mother, but I did pick my wife.  She is my family now, not my mother.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	I would choose neither of them. A good mother would respect my choice, whether or not she agreed with it.  A good spouse would accept my contact with my family.|`|TKNPveHDaa	I choose my wife every time.|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	C-u-m is thicker than blood?|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	If by spouse you mean actual husband, then always choose your spouse. He is your new family now. You and him will be starting your own family so that is what matters most. When you get married I believe that it makes your mom/dad/siblings your extended family. That doesn't mean that you stop talking to them and they are no longer important, it just means that you and your husbands relationship should be a little more important. <br>  <br>  Though I do think that it's extreme that they're making you choose between never contacting the other one again. You should still be allowed to talk to your mom when you want no matter how much crap she talks. As long as her trash talking and attitude doesn't affect your relationship then it shouldn't matter and that can only be if you don't LET it affect you. This sounds like someone let a situation get waaaaayyyyy out of hand. Maybe sit them both down and talk to them about this. Make some guidelines that they have to follow. Like "Keep Personal Opinion to Self" and if they go against the rule then tell them you would appreciate it if they kept their opinions to themselves. Do this a few times and they should start to realize what they are doing. This is a really tough situation and I hope that it is ONLY hypothetical and that you aren't actually going through this|`|f4keqWZfaa	If you have decided to begin a marriage and life with someone then that is the decision you make and you need to be totally commited to that new family. When a parent interferes by disliking your decisions and partner they do not have respect for your life as an adult and disrespect your husband or wife. This is very imature behaviour and sorry to say it is coming from someone that really should be helpful and kind. The best way to handle this is to either move away so that you both cut interference type connections with that person and you focus on your marriage and new family. If you can't move then stop all communications with the disrespectful party until you show them you are serious and will not tolerate their disrespectful behaviour. From what you say, your Mom is controlling you for her own sense of self and power and that's pathetic. Stand up for yourself and start living your own life by never putting up with this kind of attitude.|`|nr1G4uPyaa	First I'm not preaching to you. The bible says that once you are married you go with your spouse.

Your happiness is the most important thing in the world. To thy own self be true.|`|NENgQYdRaa	I would independently walk away from both of them.

NOYiba8Vaa	Assume your parents will be very angry, but just tell them straight out, right when they come home, that you did something terrible, you feel bad about it, tell them what happened, and then lead them to your brother's room. 'Til then, make sure that he's still talking and is concious. I don't know much about nose bleeds, but just incase he loses enough blood and passes out? Depends on how hard you hit him I guess?    I'm sure that once their anger has passed that they'll realize that at least you told the truth and didn't try to cover it up.

Be on your own for awhile.|`|mEUGJafdaa	you have two girlfriends your cheating, this is karma, i dont feel bad for you at all|`|e2379ca65e20818375f1f5e7d111d387aa	well listen do this go to the a music store n go to rock or metal section then pick up a slipknot n go home n put it on n put it on a high volume n then so nobody can hear u n then cut urself its make u feel better...shyt get a stripper n **** her cause i know u don't want 2 **** ur gf cause she stress u out
pdr3b4u6aa	I say you should get in contact with the guy you met over the summer and get to know him better, just as friends and THEN decided if you want it to go anywhere, and if he does too, then ladeedaa happily ever after.    And as for the other guy, if you went with him, you could break up and then it'd be all awkward all the time and you don't want that!    Also, it seems like the guy from summer seems more interested in you. You should take what you can, and not chase after some guy who MIGHT MAYBE be interested in you, after he breaks up with his girlfriend, and only the gods know how far away that time might be.    All I'm saying is: 'Dont **** where you eat'    Haha, I cant believe I took the time to read that whole thing !    Goodluck!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Didn't read it but this works,  Flip a coin  Before it lands you will know which side you want to come up|`|KTj9g2mGaa	follow ur heart! pick the one you like most. don't go for a guy who already has a girlfriend. go for the scope guy. Unless he's a manwhore.    then just wait for another guy who deserves you.|`|lHCZUPm2aa	Ok, you need a hobby.
twVyisGnaa	You have a right to be angry about this.  I personally think your boyfriend should not associate himself with the person that hurt you and treated you like crap.  Talk to your boyfriend about this and tell him all the reasons why you don't want him talking to your ex.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|73A0T8ltaa	I don't think you should dictate who he talks to, esp if they were already friends, sorry love.|`|Ig0nRZlgaa	be secure....let 'em ramble. No reaction from you--and it will stop. be quiet on this one, as a matter of fact tell your boyfriend tell your ex, you said "hi".<br>  <br>  laugh it off. Who cares. Thats' your best defense.|`|6BhTjwoNaa	No, if you push , he may think youre hiding something. Just chill and see what happens.

If you wait and he finds out by himself and she really is cheating, it's going to hurt him way worse than you telling him now. Your better off telling him now, then he can talk to her and sort it out. GO NOW! TELL!|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Hit her

Can you shorten that just a bit?|`|wnr9S9kuaa	I think you're getting over the two years relationship.  Or possibly both you're in love and getting over a relationship.|`|mgxMJVdtaa	First thins first.  Before you enter into a new relationship, end the other one.  After you end it, wait a while before you begin another relationship.  Did you check with family and friends to see what your old friend has been doing for the past 12 years?  What is his relationship record?  Has been married?  If he is involved with someone else is that relationship over?  If not, why go into a relationship with him and set yourself up for a lot of heart ache.    There is no reason to rush into another relationship.  Take your time.

rx20pKgOaa	My spouse had a long distance, mainly over the internet, affair.  He actually did leave me to go be with her, (in France) but was emailing me before the week was over telling me what a mistake he had made. <br>  <br>  It takes years to regain trust.  It helps if the spouse who had the affair is willing to answer any and all questions even if they are asked over and over again.  Also to eliminate all contact.  My husband changed his email addresses, changed his cell number, and gave me passwords to everything. He didn't become defensive or angry when I compulsively checked things. And he would tell me when she tried to contact him at work. I was present when he told her on the phone to leave him alone and I saw the emails she continued to send until he closed his email accounts. <br>  <br>  In the following years my husband has done a great deal to show his love and commitment but I have also accepted responsibility for my part in the break down of our relationship.<br>  <br>  This "crisis" happened in our 3rd year of marriage.  We will be celebrating our 10th anniversary this year. It's been difficult but we are both better individuals and better spouses because of what we have been through.  I will never take him for granted and he shows me daily that he loves me.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I wish you the best.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	be open , and understanding , that s one of the secret|`|8KB1LL3xaa	Trust, one must remember it a choice, not an emotion. The pain you feel from being cheated on is real, but trusting is something you just do or don't do. So how do you trust a partner that has cheated? That partner has to show you that they can be trusted, but the problem here is that no matter what you can always come up with a reason not to trust them or let your imagination play tricks on you. Say they are working late, or you can't reach them on their cell phone. You can assume that they are cheating again, or you can assume that they are just in a dead zone and didn't get the call. Everyday there are a hundred ways your partner will be delayed and you can assume they are cheating. IT IS YOUR CHOICE TO TRUST. <br>  <br>  Now that is not to say that they are not required to put forth some effort in showing you that they are true to their word. That is the proof. They have to make an effort to show that they are telling you the truth and lets face it you know if they aren't.<br>  <br>  I have been cheated on, and my partner never tried. We divorced, but that is not to say it has to be that way. Discover why they cheated and work through that. Perhaps there is a way to take this and make your relationship closer. Bottom line they may have cheated, but it is you they are still with. Who of us have not had other partners in our lives. Do we dwell on the fact that this person was with someone else or that they are with us?
O1b7das7aa	Scenario 1: If you mean that the groom performed or received sexual acts, my answer is C.     Why? Because if he cheats before marriage, he'll cheat during marriage.    Scenario 2: Again, if you mean that groom actually performed or received sexual acts?  I would do what I would want others to do for me. My answer is C.    Why? Because if my fiance received fellatio from a stripper at his bachelor party, you are darn right I would want someone to tell me!|`|4To2mrpIaa	It would be to let go of such friends and settle down or that would create problems in the future|`|KM5LLCqWaa	S1: C  S2: C|`|EQOnbP3Qaa	C for both!! There is no way I could marry my fiance if he did that to me! (He's not allowed strippers anyways)|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	No one "comes across" pictures in someone's phone. You have to be on a mission, pushing the buttons until you get where they are saved, ok? So you saying that someone "came across" the phone and just happened to see the pictures is bs.     Before you jump down my throat, hear me out:    My answers are A and A.    As far as I'm concerned, it's pretty horrible behavior, but you (I mean they) were going to marry them without knowing this happened, am I right? Which means, the fiance is a stand up kinda person who wouldn't normally, under usual circumstances, engage in this kind of behavior, correct? If this is an isolated incident, why allow it to ruin everything? It's not like they chatted up someone in a bar - when they were sober - and then took them home, ok? You're ... I mean they're not married yet, so I think they should get a pass.    This is what you get from snooping !|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	B, B.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	1  C  2  A|`|B94G0Y7haa	1-b  2-b, except i would talk to the future spouse and tell them to talk to your friend about it, instead of hinting to your friend to talk to the future spouse.    will you please answer my Q :)?  http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my;_ylt=AqsN...|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	D-but i'd keep the ring- once a cheater always a cheater-  unless he had money and it was a community property state - I'd marry the scum then show him the pictures... walk away with half in the divorce!!!   :)    As far as my best friend-  I'd tell her about it and explain about the community property part!  haha|`|pgF6i0L4aa	1-B     2-A
Xzvoz6mcaa	I can't stand it when people do this!!  I don't like it when people have their little floofy dogs that they consider as one of their kids.  I love my dog too, but I never would have considered her for my ring bearer or flower girl.  :)  I think it is definitely over the top.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	LOL... Yes, but being odd is fun!!<br>  <br>  A lot of people nowadays have their pets as their immediate family... I was going to have my dog in my wedding, but after a break up, the dog is no longer mine :(<br>  <br>  It's cute, fun, corky... You name it.<br>  <br>  But, again, it WILL be remembered... :)<br>  <br>  Look at "He's Just Not That Into You", Jennifer Aniston's character had to walk a dog down the aisle...  It's becoming more common nowadays to treat your animals as humans....  Sad?  Maybe.  But, at least it shows the love they have for their pets too... :)|`|1xggHtgXaa	It's strange, but whatever. I wouldn't do it personally, but if she's willing to take the risk, it must mean a lot to her.|`|LJwhaNIDaa	No. <br>  <br>  Some people consider their dog to be part of their human family. <br>  <br>  It's an inter-species adoption.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	is the dog well  behaved and friendly?  if so, why the hell not? just because it isnt your cup of tea doesnt mean its wrong|`|sGP6s7uraa	To each their own.|`|TJrRPIFLaa	That is pretty funny, and definitely unique.  But like a lot of others said before me here, dogs and cats are like immediate family members to some people.  I know they are in my family - we have 4 spoiled cats and 2 dearly loved dogs.  The cats sit at the dinner table with the family and the dogs watch TV with us.  I don't know about having the dog walk down the aisle (might run into some problems with that) but I certainly wish I could have my dogs at my wedding.  Trouble is, our venue does not allow pets.  Bummer  =(|`|vtW3qPZmaa	It's not odd - if I could I'd have my 2 bassets in our wedding... it's not practical, though so they get to go on vacation to doggy sleepover camp for a week.  I'd have really liked to have them in some of the photos but one of my hounds is an escape artist and I'd be too stressed about him getting away with so many distractions around me.|`|VTee51r9aa	I have to diagree, our dog charoletee will be walked down the asile by the flower girl. She's getting a collar with pink flowers and a decorated leash. She's a member of our family and we wouldn't think of leaving her out. Our wedding is also outdoors.|`|VEi3R0craa	to each is own if you don't like it pay for it and you can tell her to keep it out.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	it might be a little diffirent...but i guess they want to make their wedding unique...I'd love do that acutally I love dogs so much...|`|9hPnvmuzaa	no. she probably think you're odd for thinking that having her dog in the wedding is odd.|`|63439e5b52d40d8694adad7cd7a9c505aa	If my wedding location allowed dogs, I would do it.  To some people, their pets are their children.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	maybe if it was an eye seeing dog that wouldnt be so odd|`|zjtxKpLqaa	I think that is actually a really cute idea! Just imagine the little flower girl carrying the dog in her basket of rose petals or him walking by her down the isle. For many their dog is an important member of their family, almost like a child if you dont have one. Come on if you sleep with your dog how much differance is it haveing him in your wedding.|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I don't think that is odd. Some people, like me, treat their dogs like their children. I wouldn't have them in my wedding because it will be in a church and my mini dachshund is a little psycho around a large crowd. But, they may want their 'children' to be apart of the celebration. If I could, I would include him in the wedding somehow.|`|3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	Haha. Yes of course it's a bit odd. But I think it's really a fun idea. <br>  In fact, my dog is going to be my ring bearer - he's going to march his furry butt down the aisle with the ring tied around his neck. I think it will be hilarious. But then again- my fiance and I are a bit odd ourselves. "Traditional" isn't really something we're going for. I really don't like stuffy, snobby, super formal weddings. I plan on having fun - and for me that means including my ugly dog.|`|lpeHQj3aaa	It's indeed odd, but adorable too. <br>  <br>  I'm a dog lover and I would think it's a truly adorable thing to do.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Nope.  I kinda like it.  It's an outdoor casual wedding.  Those sorts of weddings anything goes.|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	Not really. My cousin had his dog be his ring bearer because there are so many little ones in our family and he didn't want to single them out!|`|c7Zmlediaa	I don't think so; to some people, pets are just like family members.|`|wADnvKGFaa	Why not?  Its her wedding and she wants her loved ones there.  Her dog is her loved one......why do you care?|`|0DGbdSIgaa	totally i think thats over the top
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Maybe he is tired from working all day or having a lot of stress   but honestly hun I am sure you do not have to work that hard to turn him on- He probably is already turned on by you just because you are you. Maybe he doesnt always like the "new" things you try because maybe he cant handle them or maybe all he wants is plain ol fashion love making without all the teasing and dancing and what not.     good luck|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Yes; without doing all what you are doing. You should take it easy and relax; with or without sex if a man loves you, he loves you.|`|jTsQkuhHaa	his drive is lower than yours|`|eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	will you marry me?|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	football game.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	Yeah... football game. But, keep up the good work & bring him a beer|`|81wvN8Rraa	He's tired of all the shows and just wants to have plain old sex with his wife.|`|mgwiuZT0aa	He could be under stress or cheating. When some men are stressed out the last thing they want to do is have sex. Sex is a mind thing and if their mind is full of stress I find it hard for them to perform. With the recession and all who can blame his stress.     Why don't you sit down and ask him nicely what the problem is. Hopefully he will tell you and stop rejecting you. Rejection can lead a person to do some foolish things. Get to the bottom of this and don't do anything that you could regret (like cheating).|`|yy45iAbtaa	maybe he just wants to make love to you and forget about all the role playing.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Crack`im in da sack!|`|mf61QkNLaa	if you give to much of yourself  its a major turnoff to a man|`|zimJxTlKaa	He's not a guy|`|UV27AyIPaa	Maybe porn stars aren't his thing. Sounds like he's not a nympho. Lucky you!|`|8YadWefXaa	Are you fat?|`|0sqRwzcfaa	well first if you want to be a hore or a skank you walk around in a maids out fit and wheres some white heels or pumps  but seriousley he just saying he wants to spend time wit you emotionley not sexually and if you do it ounce a day wit him then thats kinda not good well its up to your standerds or he just kinda wants to take it slow for a while if he has a joob and after work you two do it beacause he just thinking horney thoughts|`|t5EE6WO8aa	stop trying so hard and just let it happen, that's usually the best sex anyway when its completely random.|`|6k2lmVChaa	I HATE PEOPLE LIKE YOUR MAN. If my wife was like that I wouldn't be on this forkin computer right now. My wife makes me want to ram my own head into a brick wall and break my own neck.|`|zDeFibxzaa	sounds like he is over stressed and just needs some reassuring or some holding time.maybe you make him feel like he is just a peice of meat? men have feelings too you know.|`|zDmGngXVaa	lol. If you can do all that and he loves it but doesn't want to have sex sometimes doesn't mean you got to find new ways all the time. Could just mean he is tired! I do the same with my husband! But if he says he isn't up for sex then don't push it. Wait til he does.. If he doesn't then somethings wrong and thats when its time to push!|`|eUf9e81eaa	apply diplomacy instead of full force|`|o6xLWwZvaa	I turn my man on without even trying. I don't have to tease, taunt, dance or be naughty. I turn him on just by being me. He loves me and with that turns him on.
4qT0TfMZaa	I had to - and it was hard!  You wouldn't believe the number of gold-diggers there are out there willing to do anything to get their hands on a guy's money.  It's so bad that if you so much as look at one of 'em crosswise, she'll sue ya for breach of promise - when you never promised a damn thing!  And I'll tell ya - as a physical specimen, I'm about as far from a ripped hunk o' manhood as a guy could get!  Mother Nature beat me severely with the ugly stick - and I still have the occasional hot young thing brazenly hittin' on me!  It's flattering - but I didn't earn all that money by being impulsive or stupid, and I ain't gonna give it up for a quick roll in the hay, no matter how desirable she is.|`|2NRCJgq2aa	Shouldn't they be?  Probably more than they are.|`|57xZxXI8aa	Well I make really good money and I am only 19. But I can tell when a girl wants to go out with me because I have money, Or if she really likes me.

Uj5kuzoJaa	The best thing you can do on Friday when you're with him is to NOT bring up anything about being broken up or your past relationship. Don't tell him that you've been changing and that you want to get back together. Act like this is one of your guys' first dates. Be nice, caring, funny, etc. Show him what you guys have together rather than try to force him to admit anything. Make him have fun with you like you used to. Don't bring up anything you think you guys need to talk about. Let this night be about making a connection again. Later on in the evening, if he starts bringing things up, then go ahead and talk to him about it, but ONLY if HE brings it up first. When you drop him off at home, don't show him that you're sad. Pull up to his house and say "I had a really fun time tonight. Maybe we can do this again" Try not to let your emotions get the best of you, I know that will be hard. <br>  <br>  Now when he texts you to ask how you are doing, DON'T call him right away thinking that it's your cue to talk to him. Text him something simple like "My day's been great, what about yours?" Show him that you aren't needy. He might be turned off if every time he displays an interest in you, you go overboard and try to bring up your past relationship. It sounds like he's trying to start things out slow again. Don't try to make him rush into anything. I take it as a really good sign that he wants to take you on a date. Keep things slow and see what happens. After a few dates together, maybe then it's time to say a couple things that you need to say, but again, try to make a connection with him first.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck. If you could let me know what happens on your date, I would appreciate it!

e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	Guys do this because it works and gets the guy what he wants.  Girls always have and always will fall for whatever lines a guy says.    Guys don't care about words, actions matter to a guy.  So he will say any words he needs to say to a girl.  It's amazing to a guy how a word or two can so easily control a girl.    Guys also know they can never be honest with a girl.  Girls don't want to hear the truth and don't accept reality.  So the guy tells the girl what she wants to hear.

He may have had plans to harm the other children as well but was too distressed to carry them through, (Thank God).

wSeOxs7Jaa	Open marriages can work for some people if it is very important to both of them to have that kind of relationship and if they have a strong, trusting bond. But for most people it is not a good idea. If you think it a good idea because it would be easier then you're mistaken. Its harder and takes a lot of work. Otherwise you just end up with jealousy and broken hearts. I'm not against it for the right couple but monogamy is best for most people.|`|rH33ty23aa	The article may make sense yes, but my ex husband and i divorced because of being open. Our  marriage was fine till we opened it. I'd say its not a good idea|`|eUf9e81eaa	yes it is cheating|`|by7H31Djaa	Even though i strongly disagree with being married and having sex with other people i still understand him. I too see cheating when your spouse doesn't agree with seeing other people and/or doesn't know about it. Simple as that. But i think that couples who have continued to stay with eachother even after seeing other people it's just because they have the right control over their relationship. And couples who don' believe in "swinging" can have the same control too! I just would never ever feel right with my husband having sex with another women. I see myself as only his and something very private and personal and NOT something to share!|`|LUhh9bSWaa	Nope its not cheating if you're honest...only the broads can't handle this kind of honest side action.

Why would you want to fix something that isn't broken. If you have a need to read, re-read your marriage vows.|`|AA12027736	I think part of the reason marriages fail is because people do not realize fully what they are getting into. People usually get married because the idea 'sounds' good..so romantic, right? Only one true love in your life that you are with until "death do you part". The only thing is life happens after that wedding day. The anticipation is gone and you have to tread through this hard life and now have another person to worry about, be responsible for, and answer to. Throw the stress of kids in there and yes, divorce seems like a welcome release....    If you wanna screw around think of the reasons you want to. I can list you reasons why you shouldn't.      1 STDs...yes if the person you are doing is willing to be with a married person, they are more than likely loose. Non-discriminating. Meaning...hey more of a chance of stuff spreading around     2 Pregnancy. Condoms break. Psychos say they are on the pill when they are not. People take birth control incorrectly.      3 Falling for a Fling. It happens. Is it fair to your spouse to even put that into play?    Calling yourself in a "happy marriage" when you let your partner screw around is something I have a hard time wrapping my mind around. I guess I made sure to get my "ha-ha's" out in my dating years, which I sure did...but that was 7 years ago. Proud to say I have been happily monogamous since I met my husband.    Why open the can of worms? Improve on what you have, don't look elsewhere....the cliche goes: the grass is always greener....|`|1978e46edc09459d102fc12e39033842aa	Honesty does not eliminate jealously.  Spreading the proverbial love around is a real challenge to commitment, a prerequisite to a successful marriage.  Sure your eye might wander and your mind might briefly fantasize but the decision to commit nurtures love and your relationship through hard times - such as these.  We are too narrow minded in many ways but it is simply human  nature that everyone wants to be number one with someone else.  Threats to that number one position have lead to murder and war.  The writer you refer to has intellectualized his or her point but only presented one side.  I have worked with several couples who have open relationships and rarely are both parties entirely satisfied with the arrangement.  Stay focused on the number one in your life.|`|nE95Hnn5aa	well, one thing that we can all agree on is the freedom of speech.  that is definitely a wonderful thing not to be taken for granted here in the USA!  Here is something to ponder on, also:      Marriage Under Attack    The attacks on marriage are not new; they go back to the beginning of human history. Qualities and attitudes that developed in our first human parents have led to the marriage crisis we experience today. Adam and Eve sinned when they gave in to selfish cravings, and thus sin entered into the world. (Romans 5:12) The historical record of the Bible states that soon after this, every inclination of the thoughts of [mans] heart was only bad all the time.Genesis 6:5.    Not much has changed since then. Among the corrosive inclinations that plague marriage is the uninhibited pursuit of selfish gratification. Marriage itself might seem an outdated institution, no longer viable in a modern world under the spell of a new morality. And the relaxing of laws that regulate the breakup of a marriage has removed most of the stigma once attached to divorce.    Impatient individuals, who seek quick results and instant gratification, give little or no thought to the consequences of divorce. Lured by seductive promises of freedom and independence, they believe that divorce will lead to happiness.    Others when faced with thornlike problems in their relationship turn to therapists and marriage counselors or to books written by such authorities. Sadly, some modern marriage experts have proved more adept at promoting divorce than at defending marriage. For perhaps the first time in human history, states the book The Case for Marriage, marriage as an ideal is under a sustained and surprisingly successful attack. Sometimes the attack is direct and ideological, made by experts who believe|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think that is a total crock.  If you love someone enough to marry them, you love them enough not to be with others.  Marriage is about being with one person.  If that isn't for you then don't get married.  What you are describing is not marriage it is something else masquerading as marriage.
TuheGzLkaa	I think that is an important part of a relationship. But because quite an amount of guys aren't into doing amazing things of that sort i have come up with rules along the basis of if i dont get i dont give.<br>  <br>  One should care about their partner enough to give them that pleasure. It also adds to the whole intimacy experience with someone. They learn your body better from doing it. Us ladies need our time and stimulation. Were not wham bam thank you ma'am like most guys are.
gK0vcdnDaa	Me too!  My step-father has been with me since I was 8 as well, and we are dancing to a song by Brad Paisley called "He Didn't Have To Be" and its about how a man comes into the single moms life and becomes a good father too when he didn't have to.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFmHHxXC...

iizKx4Bvaa	I am sure that plenty have succumbed to the fallacy that is porn. I know for a fact porn is a great illusion, now it can also be a powerful tool to use to enhance and spicen things up in the bedroom. This is just not to be taken literally. Porn when it is being filmed is as romantic as a dead fish. what you see is not necessarily what you will get. I know.lol Yes to answer your question. Not all but alot will take this as the way to put it down in the bedroom. Poor things. Nice and slow and long and hard is the way for me.lol|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Any man that gets his sex tips from watching porn is so clueless, there is almost no hope for him...<br>  <br>  Porn is made for MEN, not women.......that should be the first clue!<br>  <br>  And my husband and I never had any problems coming up with ideas when it came down to pleasuring each other......|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Ok...I am loathe to answer questions liike these, for fear of feeding trolls...but no. <br>  <br>  If a man was good in the bed in the first place, watching porn is not going to make him "bad" in bed. And it might even provoke a little thought in the ones who think they are Thor between the sheets...|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Yes. I agree that porn has given some men some bad habits in the bedroom. They feel that we are like porn stars, (who are faking by the way) and use the same tactics. Men forget the gentleness that we yearn for,  the fact that a woman must be turned on in her mind in order for her to enjoy sex.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	If your parents  took you to chuch when you were young   I am sure   you should know ., PORN  is not love .|`|SovaFpN8aa	Pros: Porn can give people new ideas, ie. positions - that can change up the routine.<br>  <br>  Cons: Porn is fantasy, and gives people unrealistic expectations about sex. This is most detrimental to teens and children. Face it, porn is all over the internet. Boys used to look at Playboy, and where exposed to naked women. Today, kids get on the internet, and are exposed to filth and degradation, mixed in with sex. Kids have no point of reference, they think this is what sex is about. <br>  Men begin to believe they need to perform like these porn actors. The problem is, these movies are edited to make it wilder, but you have no editor in your own bedroom. I think porn overexposure causes men to be less satisfied in their own sex lives, because it is not like the porn movies. Even porn stars don't have sex like that in real life.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	I think you are seeing it a little backwards, no offense. First of all there' all kinds of porn -not just the hard and fast type you speak of. I've seen the soft and slow kind, the lengthy foreplay kind, and many others. I will admit that the hard and fast kind is probably more popular than others. But it is not the porn dictating the sex. It is the pre-existing desire for hard and fast sex that makes this type of porn so popular. Men haven't become a certain way because of porn. Porn has become a certain way because of the demands of its audience.|`|ZEitfScGaa	This is what people are like who just sleep around with people casually. Those people may have a lot of partners, but that doesn't make them good lovers. <br>  It takes being with someone in an intimate relationship to be a great lover. You learn to go slow, take your time in pleasing a woman. <br>  I don't think it really has much to do with porn, but alot of men, and boys, have not been in an intimate relationship so they have never felt that special emotion of actually making love to a woman. They just stick it in, pump, c**, and their done.|`|nWyvrEX6aa	I know that taking my time and foreplay get my girl to orgasm, but sometimes I find myself just going for it right away. I would agree with that. Guys generally just go for it and aren't into foreplay. It's up to the woman to communicate what she wants as well when it comes to that sort of thing because guys are not all that smart sometimes when it comes to pleasing a girl.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	As for a man, I watch porn but you know its all fate and made up, myself I like to take things slow, I would like to make sure my partner is feeling great, I love when a women is moaning and her body is shaking, I love that, and the whole of going fast and hard, sorry thats not me, it should be something you both build up to, where you both *** together thats amazing feeling. but sorry there are alot of men out there just think wam bam its over, not thinking about how the woman feelings, which alot times feels empty!!!|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	I think you are probably right and it's not just the porn...it's that a lot of me just don't care about the woman's pleasure.  Very selfish.  Now, me, on the other hand, I watch porn but only one kind.  The kind that shows women having an "0".  No "0' - no watch.  I am most turned on by seeing a woman's pleasure.  Unfortunately, my SO has not interest in pleasure - mine or hers.|`|FzFSzilmaa	hell no.. porn has helped me in the bedroom... cos we come up with new ideas... :D<br>  <br>  [edit - if your man is bad, it is cos he doesn't care... ;) some of us like to learn about new techniques, positions, etc to try... :D]|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	sex is like an art it s a teamwork between man and a woman , if they have good team effort they will both satisfied and they will reach the real orgasm|`|djUMvICoaa	I think men not knowing what women want or need is what is making them do this.  Porn might not have helped for some, but not all watch porn.  Sex doesn't come with a manuel and you try to figure it out as you go.  It takes two for what you described to happen.  It isn't that hard to fix for most, open communication about what one wants, that's how I found out the best way to please her.  Then if he can't hear this, doesn't try to follow through, you're not talking about love anymore.  He just got onto a one way street and you are left behind.|`|zKtrWvA5aa	My husband does not watch porn but I do think porn has altered the way some men look at sex.
iPNOVR6Gaa	I highly recommend you not marry someone you consider to be idiotic.  If you're not even able to have a conversation in which you can come to understand his point of view on such a simplistic topic, it bodes ill for your marriage.|`|OHfZFR31aa	No, that's not idiotic. I think it's very respectful of him. Most of the women I know who have been married in the last 5 years did not change their name. Especially if you are a professional woman who has made a career and name for yourself, why should you change your name to his? He respects your individual identity.<br>  <br>  And the whole point about taking a husband's name goes back to the middle ages when that showed you were basically your husband's property with no rights of your own. It's basically the same as when slaves used to take their master's last name. I am not anyone's property.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	No it does not seem idiotic. He respects you enough to have you make your own choice than to try to force you to do something that is a sexist tradition.|`|RBRq8406aa	Taking last name is more of a tradition then a requirement and if he does not care then why does that bother you? Many professionals don't take there spouses name because they have built a reputation with there maiden name and not a big deal. Think your making a  mountain out of a mole hill.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	If it is announced publicly, there is no need for a name change. If the name is changed, there is no need for a big public announcement. It goes both ways. Be glad he is open to you having your name any way you want it. Many guys are more stubborn on this issue.|`|S0XPrJ2laa	its just a name. WHO CARES.

In-love with my life!  Awesome!|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Can't say it will but will say it can. Take some time for yourself and make yourself into the person you want to be and a happy person that you love. Your happiness is within you so thats were you need to look. Then you can go about finding someone to compliment your happiness. No one can give you what you only have inside.

There'd be couples where one would commit to stay and support the other on and on.  There are other couples where the injured person would say "Please do me the honor of going on and living an active life.  Find a partner to live it with you."|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	dhat wud be com[plicated but i wud not consider marrying him<br>  i mean its nothing that will come from it.<br>  i wud still be frendz nd help otu sometimes but i wud def find someone new.
G7v2PWZVaa	Before you start the discipline, you need to have a private meeting with your ex husband. If you want to discipline your daughters, you both need to be on the same page. If you ground them, they will use him and pit you both against each other. You cannot start effective discipline without his support.<br>  <br>  No parties. No friends. No car. After 2 weeks riding the bus, and no social life, a teenager will start to see the light. If not, take them out of extra-curricular, on top of all other punishment. I would also require them to spend time as a family. You should set one night a week that is family night. No phones. No friends. They must eat at the dinner table with the family. <br>  <br>  Teenagers crave discipline. They will walk all over you if you let them. Don't give up! Do not cave in. Don't yell at them, just keep taking away privileges. If they yell at you, let them know that you have a WHOLE LIST of things that you can take away.<br>  <br>  My parents went as far as to take away my makeup and hair products and contacts, as well as all the above mentioned punishments. You had better believe that it made me mad, but I eventually got over it about a month later. <br>  <br>  If you do this all in love, without losing your temper you will win the battle. If you yell and scream at  your girls, you will loose. Good luck!|`|z5N0fQITaa	Just tell them, in 2 more years you will be happy to see them leave and you can legally evict them then|`|AA12041870	Oh, Lord have mercy, you have my daughter at that age.  Thank God that murder was illegal, or she would be dead today.  I tried and tried to figure out a way to make her stop being such a moron, but nothing worked.  The day she told me she was moving into her own apartment, I almost threw a party.  Never in my life was I so happy as I was when she moved out of my house.  She graduated at 17, had a job, so she was able to take care of herself.  By the time she was 19, she figured out that she was acting like a complete idiot and it stopped.  Short of putting them in a closet for the next couple of years, there isn't much you can do.  Don't give them a thing.  No money, no rides, nothing.  Never let them see you cry.  I wish you all the luck in the world.  I really do.  I understand completely what you are going through.|`|nJOYHuyZaa	Threaten to send them to live w/ their Dad. It always worked for my mom.<br>  I feel your pain, I have a 8yr. old soon to be 9 that is trying it w/ me.<br>  Luckily for me, she is in Karate & if she acts up @ home, her Master will punish her in class. As far as them forgetting stuff, if they forget it, then it wasn't important to start w/. Don't give in to them when they expect you to be the maid & chauffeur.<br>  Good luck,|`|h5cPbPj5aa	Maybe they are not happy with your new husband. sit them down and talk to them about it.|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	DO NOT DRIVE THEM BACK AND FORWARD!! Tell them that if they forgot something then they can take the bus to go get it or go get it next time! If they wont clean their rooms do it for them! Take everything that is out of place away ... Dont throw it away but lock it in a room that they have no acess to! Tell them they will only get it back when they promise to keep it clean ... and if when you give it back they make a mess again ... take it away for good and donate it to charirty! Tell them that they dont deserve to have it if they cant take care of it! Stay true to your rules! Dont let them see weakness!|`|oojO4WAraa	Stop driving them back and forth between houses - there is nothing that is important enough for that.  They will learn to gather all their stuff as soon as you stop indulging their forgetfulness and demand responsibility out of them.  <br>  <br>  Sit them down, tell them the rules, explain that if they do what they are suppose to do their lives will be good.  If they do not do what they are suppose to - they will spend their lives in their bedroom with the door shut - only getting out to go to school.  Be consistent in your discipline.  Also - make sure you and your ex are on the same page with the same rules.<br>  <br>  Also - you might go get some books on anger management - those girls would be pissing me off bad - because those books might offer some tips for turning things around in your relationship with your girls.  When you are angry it is difficult to deal with situations.  The books might help you come up with better ways to deal with your kids.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Well u have several issues here and some are already baked in but you have options. First, as children of divorce your daughters are effected psychologically. That means they have baked in resentment already. This complicates things. What I would do is set the rules in place and offer rewards instead of punishment. For example, you get these grades then you get this. If not you get the lessor - still give something. There are many that are out there that say you should not do this. Well, hello...in the workplace you get rewarded for positive behavior and contribution and no rewards or less of one for poor performance/behavior. So there is nothing wrong with prepping your daughters for the real world. Your employer does not punish you but will not reward you. Try approaching them with this and I think you should see some results. If they make good progress but short of the objective don't burn them but still give them second or third place rewards. And yes your daughters will be competing meaning comparing who got what and when. This itself will create a driving force to succeed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Y1iYQJvWaa	Strop ferrying them round for a start <br>  grounding never works <br>  tell your ex its as much his problem as yours <br>  let them go stay with him for an extended period<br>  dont ever give in <br>  if they dont clean their rooms it not your problem its theirs<br>  dont do stuff like wash their clothes<br>  Be strong|`|jL9myhmqaa	i think you need to keep it up and also tell them that you are the rules and your their mother, not their friend, not their buddy. their mom and if they dont like your rules then leave|`|A8k9NHigaa	sorry that a really tough situation. Call Supernanny?|`|4QHanq1Laa	Stop caring, seriously.<br>  If they forget something at your house make sure thier dad doesnt go back... tough luck if they forgot, they forgot it. <br>  If they wont clean thier rooms then take a trash bag and put everything in it.. when they ask where thier stuff is tell them its in the trash. If they want is back they will go to the trash and dig it out.. <br>  You are being way to nice, honestly.. The girls are doing this because they know they can get away with it. <br>  <br>  No allowance<br>  no cell<br>  no ipod<br>  <br>  They have to earn the right to have privledges such as those<br>  It worked on me as a kid.. good luck!|`|8KMdXKTLaa	this is VERY typical...the only thing you can really do is keep doing the same thing until they grow out of it. changing what you do isnt doing to do much since their old enough to figure out the tricks. i took me til about 18-19 to realize that my parents were right. well i knew they were right when i was 15 and 16, i just didn't want to admit it :) i would try sitting down and talking to them, and make a rule that theres no yelling and no raising of voices or condescending anyone. they'll listen if you talk to them as an equal|`|8pl0mtnNaa	You should try something a little more....i guess you may say Severe? I remember my sister was being a jerk to my mom and you know what she did? she made her dump her boyfriend! taking away there stuff will only get them them pissed off. i learned that when i was a kid too! after a while you get used to your stuff tooken away until you start to except what is happening! make sure that they are prepared when they leave the house as the excessive driving might have a negitive affect on them. Probably the best thing to do is send them to a camp or something. have some family time with them!|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Oh my ... I hate getting older, but I'm so glad I don't have 3 teenagers anymore!   First of all, stand your ground about the phones and Ipods.  Choose to speak with respect to them and require them to speak that way also.  It is tough to do that, but your goal is to raise respectful young ladies, and you must lead by example.  <br>  <br>  Forget the clean rooms.  Choose your battles.  Isn't a clean bathroom and kitchen more important?<br>  <a href="http://www.fivelovelanguages.com/forfamilies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fivelovelanguages.com/forfami...</a><br>  Check out the above link.  This guys books are easy to read and really ring true.|`|fb0ad31580ee2dd9c25d798bf0b062dfaa	They are probably angry about you and their dad's divorce. I have cousins who are now adults that used to be bad and disrespect their mother and that have a step dad and step brothers. The reason why they act this way is because of hurt and anger. I'd say giving them a spanking, sending them to their dad, or just kicking them out should be solutions. I know this may sound harsh, but it might help in the end.|`|y1hH8UtQaa	ok teenagers are hard it wasn't that long ago i was one (not bad honest), maybe you could try talking to them, threaten them with behave or get out, its your house they have to follow the rules.<br>  Do you have a family member or friend who can help?or call social services for some help. there are also courses on parenting around. Or maybe you and your ex husband can help each other and join forces.|`|xFVDjZqPaa	Keep up the hard work, parenting is surely the hardest job in the world, if you and your exhusband can be on the same page, no more driving them back and forth, they can do without, Im sure they arent going to die. Also if they cant keep their room clean take a trash bag in their while they are at school and pick all their stuff up off the floor, counters..where ever, put the trash bag full of stuff out in the garage, laundry room, somewhere where its not in your way and you dont have to look at it, either they will start putting their stuff up or they wont have anymore stuff to leave everywhere. I wouldnt even try arguing say what you need to say and follow through, arguing gives them room for negotiating, and negotiating at this point is not an option, you have to make that clear to get the respect that you need.|`|SeUk64yfaa	instead of punishing them for something bad they did<br>  maybe you should praise them when they do listen to you.<br>  <br>  im 15 myself, <br>  and when my mom praises me<br>  im more likely to listen.<br>  <br>  when she just keeps yelling and yelling<br>  i tend to defy her.<br>  maybe give em the silent treatment.<br>  it piles on the guilt|`|C61HWHKeaa	Don't let them go anywhere, take tv away, make sit in there room without anything at all. and if they want to go back and forth tell them it's too bad. if their father wants to drive, SURE!|`|nnaqMgYRaa	it is working, just continue what you're doing. teenagers will be defiant to all discipline. you're setting them on the right path to life.|`|tLBjsrEFaa	I would tell them to get out of the house they are no longer wanted, let  a foster home take them|`|VemHKmkmaa	Send them to boot camp.<br>  teach those brats a lesson.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	I am a mother of 3 teenage girls. And I planted fear in them since they started to understand words. Discipline starts as soon as they are born. If you are trying now, it may be too late cause they always got their way. Good old fashion *** whooping helps. You start doing things for yourself only. Cook and clean for you. Leave their stuff alone. They can wear their dirty clothes, eat whatever they can make. DO NOT drive them back and forth if they forget something. Teach them responsibilities. They have to be responsible for their own behavior. You need to put your foot down, you tell them once "NO" and that is it don't repeat yourself, just ignore them, if they continue to run their mouth drop them off in the middle of the street and tell them to walk home. Or take them to a foster home for a visit, take them to a jail/prison to visit, plant some fear into them. Tell them if they want to talk and act like adults I will treat you like adults. Start making them pay for living at your house. Tell them they need to get a job or get out. Simple and then just walk away. The more you talk the more they don't care. Silence speaks louder than words.|`|AA11918707	Teens are tough.  You have to learn to pick your battles.  So they have a messy bedroom.  Shut the door, they have to live in it.  Set up rules and consequences.  Make sure you follow through each time a rule is broken.  Always let your children know they are loved, even when they do things that do not please you.  Let the natural consequence happen on things.  If they forget something at dad's oh well, they will have to just get it next time, it is not going anywhere.  Instead of telling your daughter to shut her mouth when you are disciplining the other.  Just tell her nicely to go to her room that the situation does not concern her.   I know it is hard not to lose your cool, been there done that.  Maybe something is bugging them and that is why they are acting out.  Have you ever told them they are welcome to chat about anything with you, that you will listen?(remember to keep quiet while they are talking).|`|EZHZW7QFaa	I'm not a mom but when i was 16 (which was about 5 years ago lol) i was a little miss *****/know-it-all and i had no respect because i was going through that difficult stage. My dad was ALWAYS trying to control me it was so F*** annoying! My mother was trying to reprimand me too but not as much...anyway after while my mom got sick of always keeping after me and my ways so she started to kind not pay as much attention to me except if it was to talk or ask how my day was or if i needed to talk about anything. The reverse psychology DEFINATELY worked on me b/c i wanted to know why she wasn't paying attention! The harder you try the harder they will resist...they are 16 not 10 - they are starting to grow up. Give them back their phones, their Ipods and everything else - and dont ground them...once i saw that my mom was my mother/friend i really started to respect her more and not resent her for everything all the time...<br>  <br>  P.S - once you are their "friend" you will find out more about them and they will even tell you their secrets!! It will take time but i swear it will work. They will clean up and respect you on their own volition try it ....Good Luck <3|`|YwuwL21Gaa	tough situation......well...i am 17 boy here.<br>  <br>  See, i understand how difficult and ugly the situation can get. Basically its a rift that is being created. You and your teenage daughters dont share a common wavelength.<br>  <br>  The idea is to get in their skin....well not literally. Make them feel you are part of their group.<br>  <br>  Sit with them and watch the TV shows they watch (not matter how explicit they are). Talk to them about the show.<br>  <br>  Then talk to them about their boyfriends (this can be tough for a mom to discuss...i can imagine). But first check whether they are comfortable disscussing their bfs with u or not. <br>  <br>  Talk to them on the dinning table.......not about the mistakes they commited...but about how good they are...and how better can they be.<br>  <br>  MIX WITH THEM....THATS THE KEY.<br>  <br>  IF YOU HAVE MORE PROBLEM...YOU CAN CONTACT ME ON MY CRICKET WEBSITE <a href="HTTP://WWW.CRICKETGURU.CO.NR" rel="nofollow">HTTP://WWW.CRICKETGURU.CO.NR</a>|`|b4ed84ea4c76a500f5bae98276bbbf46aa	I am wondering if their bad behavior came on suddenly, or gradually. If you and your ex have been tough on discipline since they were little then it would seem out of character for this to pop up. Granted, they are teenagers, but they should not be disrespetful.<br>  I agree with taking all of their stuff away and would go further by taking EVERYTHING out of their rooms except their beds and dresser and books.....they should not be allowed to come out at all. Sit with them, one at a time and tell them it is up to them how long they will be disciplined and the only way you will know is when they stop disrespecting you.<br>  And if they forget one thing from one house...too bad. Don't go back for it. If it is something they MUST have, like medicines or toothbrushes, then there should be one at each location.<br>  You and ex must be on the same page discipline-wise. If they are grounded in their rooms with you, then they need to be grounded at the other house.|`|bpg90jhkaa	I am 18 years old and I went through the same thing with my father. <br>  First of all I would like to say how great it is that you are single mum and managing two animal teenage daughters.<br>  This is a give and take situation. You need to co-operate with your daughters as much as you expect them to co-operate with you. Basically you need to come to some sort of aggreement. You still need to stand your ground but ask them what they want. Knowing girls at that age want to go out and party with boys. As sad as this might sound, you cant stop it. If you try to, your daughters will rebel more and become complete monsters. <br>  Approach them and say they can do what they please but they must answer your phone calls when they are out, come back by a certain time (arrange a time that suits you and them). Tell them you love them, and thats why you are doing this. Alot of children think you are selfish and just want to spoil their fun. They dont know that you just care and love them.<br>  My father was old fashioned and wouldnt let me leave the house. At first i just thought he didnt know better and was selfish. I rebelled and left my home completely. It wasnt until later that i had to find out myself he did truely care and couldnt change his ways because thats how he was brought up. I sat down with him and gave him a reality check and said to him he needed to co-operate with me and be abit flexible. We came to a aggreement and problem fixed.<br>  There is also abit of reverse psychology involved. Every time my parents would yell and shout at me I would get angry, not think logically and rebel against them. I felt that they didnt respect me and i refused to respect them. If you can control your fustration and change it to being friendly and patient you will see how differently your daughters will act. Be like a friend to them, and develope a strong relationship. They will not only respect you and listen to you more, but you will understand how they think and work. There is a lack of understanding in the relationship between you and your daughters. They key is to bond with them and like i said before.. come to an agreement.|`|m40Hh4a1aa	my mother says that it seems like a hurricane has passed through my room so i can't really say anything about that.hehheh . BUT about the driving of your daughters back and fourth....you are not their chauffeur!! they should really stop expecting that of you. next time they ask you to drive them about, tell them to take a cab[of course, only if they can afford it, sine they have no allowance] or they can walk there. IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM IF THEY LEAVE SOMETHING BEHIND. You are not their servant.<br>  [should have disciplined them when they were younger]<br>  [btw, I'm 16 this year. Gosh i want an Ipod too T.T I bet that the amount of their allowance is big too right? TT_TT]|`|pGZjGFM5aa	Don't do what they ask of you until they do something first...they have to earn it.<br>  <br>  Just grounding them won't do much, but if they say something like "I need money to go to the mall" or something that they want you to give or do for them, don't do it.<br>  <br>  Delete every thought of doing something nice for them for a little while. (Unless one of their birthdays is coming up, in that case give them a few things of what they want that's in YOUR budget)<br>  <br>  If you ever take them to places on your own will & they don't say thank you or even act like they appreciated it, tell them "Well I'm never gonna do anything nice for you guys anymore because you won't say "Thank you" or do anything nice for me"<br>  <br>  As for the back talking, it's a normal teenage thing. But threaten them will locking them in their rooms for long periods of time with nothing in there for them to do other than clean it or do homework.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :D|`|hd3B4DT0aa	as  a 16 year old girl;; i think you should only punish them when they do something you had already warned them about;; but not all the time so it could take full effect on them. wait till like a dance or when they really want to go out so you can say no to them until they change their behavior. it always works for me.|`|e39ca120bf2c23ac79a4334d9632adaaaa	I would tell your ex to take them in for awhile and let him see how they are and let hem see how it is not to have there mom around to do the stuff for them.

zjtxKpLqaa	Well it will be both of your money once you are married. But I believe if you are able to save for the trip then do it and then some of the wedding money could be used for spending money and excursions. 8000 is a lot especially with all the costs of a wedding. Make sure to let her parents and your families know of your plan because they might want to contribute a little extra. You could jokingly say an extra 200 will pay for scubba diving in ___ but all the while be subtly hinting.|`|AA11509996	Forget ettiquette.<br>  <br>  What does budgeting have to do with etiquette??<br>  Either you spend it now or you take it out of your gifts later.<br>  <br>  You and your bride to be should be handling financial issues as a couple as of now. Have frank discussions on how you will spend  BOTH your money.<br>  <br>  UPDATE: Jon, i realize you're probably the type of couple that is very traditional and in this case i'd say speak to your fiancee. Make sure she knows where the spending money for the honeymoon is going to come out of whether you have to save for it or from the wedding money. I'd assume the wedding money. Alot of ppl will even specify that they are giving you money on your wedding day to be used in the honeymoon and for fun. <br>  <br>  There should be no reason for not having this conversation. Thats why so many couples divorce for financial reasons. They arent used to talking about money as if it were taboo to do so.  In doing so you will know what is expected money wise while still keeping that element of surprise. You'll both be happier.<br>  Congrats!|`|Gu856ETGaa	I think that at that point you're married to the money and the trip belong to the both of you....it's not his money or her money it's both of your shared money.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	we both paid for our honeymoon and the wedding. we put our money together.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Actually, since I'm doing most of the planning for the wedding, my fiancee wants to take care of the honeymoon planning...

The two of you should sit down together and talk about how much each of you will be able to save to contribute to honeymoon expenses.<br>  <br>  Together, you might decide that you will pay for the cruise and the plane tickets, while she will pay for shore excursions. Or you might decide to set up a bank account just for the honeymoon and both of you will contribute to the fund, with all of the expenses will be paid out of this joint account. You might agree that any money you receive as wedding gifts will go into the honeymoon account, or that you will use only a certain amount of the gift money and put the rest in savings.<br>  <br>  As you can see, there is no right answer. You and your fiancee should think about honeymoon expenses together and make a plan that works for your particular financial situation as a couple.|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Welcome to the wonderful world of "tradition is dying"...<br>  <br>  Traditionally, the Father of the Bride paid for the (daughter's first) wedding - the Mother of the Bride and Bride made all the plans, not worrying about money, and the Father paid it with a Smile. Beyond that, in some places, the Honeymoon was paid for by the Family - read: Father (Bride's or Groom's), or by the Couple themselves.<br>  <br>  Now-a-days, with more and more couples wanting to pay for everything (and both families "gifting" the couple with different things - caterer, flowers, etc), talk to your fiancee about what sort of budget she thinks would be appropriate, and see how much she would be willing to put in the pot...after all, if Daddy's not footing the bills, YOU will be, even if she's taking the debt up-front. That being said...make sure ahead of time that whatever you have planned is something she'll enjoy and want too. After all, if she's the type that gets sea sick in a bath tub, a cruise would be a really bad idea.<br>  <br>  In any case, I wish you and your fiancee all the best in your new life together, and hope you have all the happiness you deserve.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11312653	This is not a matter of etiquette. Etiquette tells us that such matters should be negotiated in good faith with mutual courtesy, but not what the outcome of such negotiations should be.

pQgpTJh7aa	okay, well, this has happened to me several times. Usually I try to make him realize he was wrong by asking him how he would feel if I did the same, and create a scenario. Or, you could be immature (ohh how I want to immature sometimes!!) and do the same petty thing to him so he SEES what it is like.     So basically, and I hate to say this, but they're always going to smile and say, "okay, I'm sorry, I was wrong." but deep down they will still think they are in the right, and nothing you say can change it.|`|zDeFibxzaa	take a vacation,with him or without|`|sfn6SpbCaa	Lying is doing something wrong; in a lot of marriages it's a major trust breaker. So, let's begin from the top...|`|ARCURrPhaa	The only way things will get better is for him to admit he was wrong. If he can't do that then everything that comes out of his mouth will be lip service.|`|y9CgveCGaa	If he doesn't feel that he did anything wrong, then he's not going to understand.  You need to make him understand that he lied first.  Then the way he works on it is not to lie anymore.

It seems to me that men who want to change will.  Men who don't, don't.  When we have to ask for them to renew our trust when they know they've scorned us, our efforts seem futile.      I'm sorry you are going through the drama!    Follow your gut.  Not your heart...your gut.  Intuition is a powerful thing!|`|t5EE6WO8aa	you can't make him understand all you can do is remind him how you feel. if he loves you, he'll change on his own because he won't want to lose you. also, don't be so suspicious all the time. just because he lied about one thing doesn't mean he lies all the time. you have to show him that you're beginning to trust him again too. if you can't bring yourself to do that then maybe its time to re-evaluate.|`|xpJcnM88aa	Men are wolfs, for they will never understand.

0dJkuu3daa	well those people you drink with, start talking to them at school and stuff  like about how good the last party was and stuff like that.... ++ find out something little that they like, like a tv show, and talk about that together.... taling about tv always solves the problem, then you will be accepted without drinking|`|11VwVTYYaa	well maybe the drinking is affecting your friendships.|`|rR0rPVAEaa	Make a conversation about the latest hit songs, and things that are not gross.

If so, they aren't your real friends. They are drunk acquaintances. Now, i dont mean to sound like a saint, but get involved with a teen youth group. You dont have to mention that you drank or anything but its a great way to participate, have friends, and have fun without gettting in trouble. If your crazy, then think of fun ways to be with your new friends! Go TPing, egging, paintball, whatever! Those are all great ways to have fun and there isnt any fowl. Good luck and even if my advice wasn't the best, tell me how it goes. Please, just update me. It'll make me feel good by talking about highschool. Email me or something. Tell me what you are going to do.
rM63IEfzaa	i think you should take a chance and try to start a conversation. i mean, talking to someone is the first step to getting to know them, right? if she doesnt respond, then on the bright side, at least she'll notice that you've taken an interest in her. after that, the chances of her thinking more about you as a possible date rather than just a classmate will increase. so yeah, take a chance, be brave, and see where your words take you :) you never know-maybe she'll respond and at the very least, start thinking a little about you!|`|2lxVGnOwaa	Bang her!

Hope I could be of help.  Good Luck!|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	The best thing you could do is to   NOT   look at everything that's been done before.    Sit with a sketch pad and get out some pencils, and just start drawing. Visualize what you want it to be, how you want it to look ... and make it happen.    Do you want sleeves? Halter? Strapless? Do you like seaming under the bust like for an Empire waist? Do you want lace? Satin? Silk ? Beading ? Will it have any kind of ruffles or tiers, or just fall straight to the floor? What about the train?    Just start drawing, and make it happen.    You can do it !!    :D Best of luck !

Uj5kuzoJaa	Do you live together? If not then this is easy. Just tell him that you already have plans with some friends when he asks if you want to do something. Or tell him that maybe it's time we took a day to keep in touch with our friends. In the beginning of a relationship it can be really easy for both of you to forget about your friends you had before you started dating. Tell him that you feel like you've been neglecting your friends and you'd like a night where you got to hang out with them again. He should be ok with that and probably realize he should do the same thing. Just give yourself the space you need. You don't need to hurt his feelings to do it either.|`|I40iBJdHaa	oh god, don't you hate that??  you need to tell him that you love him, but that you need time for yourself and time with your friends. let him know that it is healthy to have your own lives.<br>  that always freaks me out, how when  some people get together they become this this like...one entity. i never want to be like that!<br>  everyone needs there own friends and there owns lives.<br>  my boyfriend that i'm with now was like that in the beginning. after i talked to him and actually encouraged him to have nights that he hung out with his guy friends without me, everything just kind of fell into place. <br>  now we can do things together with his friends and/or my friends without each other and there are no longer issues.<br>  good luck! i know it can be really frustrating.|`|iRdKOCVpaa	theres no easy way to say it just dont let him overwhelm you i felt like i was being over bearing in my previous relationship so i backed away a little but not everyone will do that.<br>  uhm just try and do some activities that he wouldnt want to do or that he cant do and eventually his life wont revolve around you anymore.<br>  thats a horrible thing when that happens because when plans start to differ from being with each other it feels like your panicking waiting to see each other again dont let it get to that level lol.<br>  good luck (:|`|yDKHatBxaa	let him know that you need your own time too but not because you dont want to see him but you just need your own time and so does he.<br>  <br>  same thing happened to me and i ended up feeling like he was completely taking over my life, so make sure you let him know.
iPNOVR6Gaa	I've been married for 22 years and I love my wife.  Love does exist.  Unlike your husband, I think one of the keys to the success of my marriage is that both my wife and I highly value each other and demonstrate it often.  If I were you, I would ask him why, if he doesn't care about your feelings, *he* remains married to *you*.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Married 52 years.  Love my husband but not "in love".  Nobody married for a long time is.  It wears off.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	Have been married 22.5 years and three children,two grown and a 15 year old. I yo-yo everyday between wanting a divorce and wanting it to work and finish growing old together. We actually have found some common ground over the years with the kids getting older, but there are other issues that aren't being resolved and he is happy just to sit and watch tv all of the time when I need him to talk to me. <br>  <br>  He doesn't want out at all and as I said I yo-yo. If both of you want out and are completely unhappy with one another I would think that maybe you should both make a change. Divorced couples sometimes live together to give the kids both parents in one household and manage to have a separate social life.|`|igH1dP4laa	My husband and I have been married for 47 years, and I am just as in love with him today as I was when we got married, but when you get older, that flame just kinda sits there, but the love is still there. I think when men get older, they kinda take their wife for granted, and therefore put their priorities over the wife a little bit, but don't mean to. Maybe going to Counseling would help.|`|1474ddd3aa450daf673bdee63169f0ccaa	Nearly 25 years, Good times and rough times, as well as really bad times.<br>  <br>  Check out this web site in the source link list.

You know love exists because you see it everyday and your entitled to it just as much as the next person. I have been with my husband for 15 years, and yes there is love.Do you really want to look back on this 1, 2, even 5 years from now when nothing has changed. Kids will not make it work, or make you love each other. You owe it to them as a parent to show them what a healthy relationship looks like and right now they are learning from the two of you. I also have 2 children, and regardless how much it would hurt and take time to get over I would leave. For an even clearer picture imagine your own daughter asking this question......would you want her to waste her life in a loveless marriage? Kids are resilient they will bounce back, grow up, and understand. Do whats right for you.|`|RBRq8406aa	Love might seem to have one meaning but in reality it has many. Try asking someone to define love and you will get many different and varied answers. With that in mind the way you define love might be such that you are or will be in and out of love with spouse. That is we are humans and we evolve as such through our entire life. Think of mental state at different times in your life and can guarantee it has changed. Same with emotions and thus being in love is one of those moment to moment things not a global always yes or always no. Would have to say that after 21+ years of marriage my definition for love has changed evolved just as has life with wife. With that statement must say that have been in and out of love with wife many times over the years.|`|mC1EL2kRaa	Each Family is quite different. My wife and I will be married 20 years next week.

We expect each other to support the marriage the way that God wants us to.<br>  If I treat her without love, I believe I have to answer to God for that. We expect that each other loves god greater than we do each other.<br>  We have three children. We are quite happy. Not always, but in general.<br>  I miss my wife all day long, when I am at work.

She sounds amazing, and a perfect match for you. Here's what I'd do.  Bring it up in conversation.  Ask her something like, "So do you think, as an individual, that you'd be ready for marriage anytime soon? Emotionally? Or do you think you'd like a little more 'livin it up' time?"    If she says no, don't propose.  Give her more time.

But I would suggest to talk to her about marraige once and a while and if she tells you yes I would definitly marry you then you know that she is in the relationship for the right reason as wel  I would wait a year though because she is a year younger then you  this story sounds like love at first sight.

You should let her read this! I think you will know when it is the right time. If you think it is now, then go for it. You sound like a wonderful couple. I just got engaged myself, and it took my man 2 years, but I was okay with that. If you guys have talked about marriage, then maybe the next step is to propose. You obviously love each other very much and might as well be married:) Best of luck! You two are so lucky to have found each other. Trust in her love. You may think she's "out of your league", but she obviously thinks you're perfect for her. Make sure you really think about the proposal and that it's not something done at the last minute. Show her just how much she means to you, and you will be fine.

Studies show that the "romantic" feeling wears off after 2 years. I know this from experience. Please don't become another statistic.     You're in love, but after the wedding, after the kids after the dream has been achieved, what's left? Take your rose colored glasses off for a minute and think, is this gonna work? What are the problems that might arise? You're living together now, right? It'll be easier to be a little constructive about the situation. You might get bored or you might not.    Sorry, I'm not trying to be negative and over mature, but heartbreak and divorce hurts like hell and if people would stop being so idealist about situations then stuff like this doesn't need to happen. All the best anyway! I hope you make the right choice!|`|c73c9fc0da3874e1d4faac4608c7b448aa	you question is too long and i would fall asleep if i actually read it.      but HELL NO, you should NOT propose.  unless, of course, you actually enjoy PAIN, MISERY and endless AGONY every single day of your life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|pgF6i0L4aa	yes!! good luck

Far from being embarrassed,I think he'd be very happy to have a partner who shows such loyalty and consideration about the whole aspect of the relationship.
HfrR1xspaa	You have to get over your fear of rejection. It won't be easy, and it won't be quick, but you just have to slowly come to terms with the fact that sometimes you'll get shot down, other times things will go smoothly.    As far as flirting goes, it's not too hard on the girl, basically just be open to his flirtations. Smile at him, laugh at his jokes, be open to conversation. Picking on him can work to, as in make fun of him in a joking way. Obviously nothing too serious, but just innocent jokes.    Other than that, you just gotta slowly open yourself up kid. Be patient, observe others, and go with it.    Good luck.|`|AA10037028	well, when he stretches his feet out to touch yours, give him a light kick back and smile at him.    haha. it is flirting if he's trying to play footsie haha|`|LnzUMUCdaa	smile look at him laugh act bubbly and very flirtatious touch his feet  talk to him alot hope this helps|`|JZMfUDylaa	you and me both|`|hyRj4eIjaa	u and me both|`|CvREWSV1aa	Well i know that with a guy i like i love just touching him like putting my feet beside him, its just one of those things that make you feel like "ohhhh" but i think its his way of flirting.  and you should just flirt with him by maybe smiling at him if he is looking at you but in one of those innocent ways.

I just flirt with out knowing it:P lol|`|2huMUAREaa	Well there 2 ways to go about this..  1 way is hard to get,where you act like you dont like him..most times this dosnt work i dont reccomend this..    the other way is toflirt back...    when he strecthes his legs out again kick him gently and smile  to let him no you notice him..    also talk tohim alot    make lots of eye contact..there is a hint to this..  when he looks at you look away fast and act like you werent lookin at him..but a few times you wnat to keep his eye contact and either smile wink or slightly bite your lip      good luck:)|`|BrH4HR7xaa	awww he totally likes you!  i think that you should keep your feet there haha. dont be so shy! if you keep moving your foot away or not looking at him he might get the hint that you dont like him and that would suck (becuase from your question is sounds like you DO like him) just smile at him a lot, do cute faces, and try to talk to him! dont be shy. if you guys like each other and he's already taking the initiative, you guys will mesh perfectly! =)  good luck! i hope i helped!|`|9C7hcdwyaa	well first of all you need to get over your fear of being shy or it will take over you, and that is not a good thing. secand yes he is flirting with you, so let him tuch your feet and if he is trying to play with your feet don't be afrade to play back, because if you keep acting like that ond day he might give up and just move on., and then where will that leave you . so all i can say is get over your fears and go after him!
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Most girls feel this way....yes...|`|sC6zU8BEaa	Yeah... so do I and I'm 13 and I'm guessing you are around that age too.|`|da1Vqmbqaa	ur not alone im here 4 u and i want a gf that wants that- all the girls in my school want u think of their boobs more then them|`|e2ccfda0779d310e0b3d6d1cdc69d2d1aa	Yes all men are like that. Is good that you are standing up for respect.What gets me is when men get in a relationship with you, they get jealous on the way you dress. Men care about image.|`|b1b6e3d33b1a99da35a245dd5c6cae76aa	Oh dont feel bad.  I was the same way when i was your age.    Your not alone.|`|uSZVT4bwaa	yeahh most girls feel the same way and there are some really sweet guys out there. just keep looking!|`|9YYGCIX5aa	yes yes|`|PTXFO6asaa	your allll alone......    so am I :(|`|e2kldwB7aa	im the same way you have to pick the right guy just go to the mall one day and "boy shop" look in boys sections of stores and look at the guys dont go for gang people...emo guys normally dont think about your boobs (my boyfriend) because there normal worried about cutting themself.. or preppy and jocks normally stare at your boobs cuz all they want is sex so just be careful in your decision|`|w5As20EOaa	i went through the same thing
QOSWAnYkaa	awww thats so sweet. ok. asking a girl to be your valentine isnt really that hard. If you talk to her once in awhile it shouldn't be to much of a surprise when you come to talk to her. My guess is that she probly likes you. Just be really sweet and start a conversation maybe about sports. Then ask her how her valentines day is going. Then be like ya know, i dont have a valentine..would you like to be my valentine? (smile a cute smile). I hope it works out well, it sounds like you would be good together. :)|`|w5As20EOaa	lol  race dont matter  u should do something cute  she's athletic? do something like idk ummm make a cake in a shape of the sport she likes and write would u be my valentine.  corny is cute|`|xR3F2RFnaa	ask her. v-day itself iz romantic.send her like a person to sing to her at her doorstep and give a valentine candy and roses|`|5mD4AfeWaa	HELL YES! Build her a cake. That would get me SO aroused.|`|ChMTXl3saa	Just get her one of those tiny boxes of valentine candies. Share it with her and read what each tiny heart says...then see how she reacts..Take it slow since she likes someone else...|`|RjlavyLtaa	just act cool around her and ask if 0you like anyone and then ask her. Get her something really nice. Valentines day is pretty far. Start getting to know her now before Valentines day.|`|KFlnnvTwaa	jamaican / chinese ?

"Hi, Do you want to be my Valentine" ????  if she says yes you say " ok so I want to invite you for some ice cream after school  at 3pm is that ok."|`|Mr0x9Y7Maa	Step up ur game and ask :)|`|QlV1ke1Yaa	mmate girls hate it when they single on valentines.. so get her now b4 its 2 late like me the girl i like just got her valentine b4 2days ago and i got expelled from school.. girls hate it when they single so get in the game and go out with her a week befour|`|KvyB0E77aa	Do what Pedro did. Build her a cake.|`|1ZwI8ePdaa	Do something cute that will grab her attention, for example:    If you both like the same sports team buy her a shirt for them, then get " Be my Valentine" written on the back as the players name.    Or chocolates and a bunch of flowers.    But make sure it's personnal, if it makes her feel loved then she'll melt :)|`|wl85WhsTaa	just ask her and tell her how u feel|`|nz5uA7VOaa	buy her chocolates! i loovee when guys do that, she should to!|`|xthjbUg2aa	GO UP TO HIM AND SAY..."WILL YOU BE MY VALINTINE"...(BOYISH  SKEAKY VOICE) THAT EASY LMFAO
HqG4MDxGaa	Hon, that looks suspicious to ME. You didn't think anything about it at first UNTIL he became distant, now you are here on Yahoo Answers because you get the feeling that something isn't right. Listen to your gutt, honey, it never lies. TRUST ME ON THIS! But if you want the non-confrontational way, say something to him like "I've noticed that you've been getting alot of text messages lately from so and so. Should I be concerned?" and see how he answers the question. If he looks you right in the eye and answers you in an even tone, chances are you got nothing to worry about. He may even offer to quit talking to her so much if it bothers you, even (without you even having to ask). If on the other hand, he looks uncomfortable, gets defensive or looks down, he's lying to you. Best of luck to ya.|`|0RFlpHXaaa	I don't believe u even put this up.   U don't say how old u r but I will assume, Verrrry young.    It don't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out, Ur out of the picture in a short period of time.    I did the same to my Girlfriend and was not MAN enough to let her know what a JERK I was at the time, but I had the best of both Worlds, Her and the one I ended up with.    Don't wait until he is ready to cut u loose, Dump the JERK NOW!    signed "Been there, Done That|`|xpiGWrdMaa	You don't really need to ask him. Most likely he is cheating.  But if you feel you must, just straight out ask him, "What's with this girl you've been texting every night?"  You know your man, you can probably tell when he's lying, most likely he will be.  Leave him in the dust. A*hole.|`|LK2FfRhsaa	Ask who this person is and find out her background.A few days later tell him you want to have a get together just the 3 of you, and then you should be able to identify cheating signs quickly.If he is cheating, tell him that you and him are through. Then find another boyfriend.Hope this helped!!!!!!!!!!
4C2rZaeOaa	I think maybe its just courtesy!|`|B5dpYZDVaa	If they separated on friendly terms I don't see anything wrong with the birthday card unless either of them have hopes for reconciliation.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	He still loves her.|`|uyU24qXXaa	i don't think he will ever stop loving her like a friend because they were so close.so i think its perfectly fine for him to still send cards to his ex|`|36uns5nRaa	Please. Your husband, at least I'm assuming, is just being courteous and classy. It is entirely possible to still be friends with an ex, even if you are no longer romantically connected.|`|3NoQuoWuaa	It's a courtesy. There probably are kids involved and maintaining a reasonable relationship with the ex is a big plus for the kids.r
AA11266093	Maybe, but sounds like right now there are benefits of you two not being married. And at the sametime doesn't sound good that he sold the engagement ring.<br>  <br>  It really depends on what you want and need too, like if you aren't happy living with him and not being married,get back to living separately, do live the life you want as much as possible, and don't only go along with what your bf says.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	LOL this is a movie script i just cant remember which one<br>  <br>  he is a LOSER! LMAO and if you stay with im then what does that make  you LMAO!  oh yeah a welfare momma|`|JgvQDjf2aa	Wouldn't stick around to find out. Sounds like he could be planning something to get back at you.|`|7hkbzqrCaa	WOW. I'm sorry but he sounds like a real ***. Truthfully I have never been in the kind of situation you're in, but you need to ask him flat out if he will marry you. Sometimes the girl has to propose to the the guy. If he still doesn't want to marry you, and his only excuse is that he wants to screw the system. You need to find yourself some one else who will love both you and your baby, not just the idea of you. <br>  And congratulations on the baby.|`|NHq4RJdvaa	Okay first off, I have to start by asking, how did you go five months without realizing you are pregnant?  Wasn't it kind of obvious after say, the first month or so?<br>  <br>  Having said that, as far as the intentions thing goes, if he didn't want you back in his life, he wouldn't have allowed you back in.  Realizing that he may have a child on the way is a very sobering moment, and may have shocked him into settling down with you.  The best thing I can recommend to you as far as an answer goes, talk to him.  Sit him down, and be very open and honest with him.  Communication is very very necessary for success in any relationship, especially one involving a child.|`|37M3dkkRaa	it doesn't really sound like he wants to marry you right now. maybe he's trying to make your relationship stronger, since you are living with him now. and he will probably marry you one day, but probably not soon. and i don't think his intentions are bad, i think he's just waiting to see how things work out this time.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	of course he will want to marry you, keep dropping hints you think he gets it
tqvWD5RQaa	Well shes probably wanting to wait until marriage if shes held on this long.. the question is are you willing to wait? Or ask the big question? Probably not.. so heres what I think.. Valentines day is coming up since your both in college you'll have to celebrate this during spring break right? Anyway a girl wants her first time to be an event! So many of us give it up and forever have the story of how my 1st time sucked! So you need to go the distance and plan a very special event for her go all out, dinner, candles, chocolate, roses, a love letter, in a hotel suite with a hot tub, a gift from victoria secret (have someone you can trust help you) all in the name of Valentines day and when things get going slow it down!!! Take extra time pleasing her seriously! Dont forget places like her back, neck, legs, do this for her and you may get what you want too. BUT if its a no then its a NO! And this is your chance to talk to her and REALLY find out whats her thoughts on the topic. If you love her you'll respect her and you both should be able to talk about this and anything else! But do me a favor if you get your way, give her at least 10min of caressing her after the deed, us girls love that and it makes us feel appreciated. I hope this helps Good luck.|`|AqHm4IQyaa	Just say "yes" when you are making out. Take it to the next level.|`|Ip3mxDqdaa	Nail some slags to get your confidence up then just take her home and never look back.|`|OiLNogtEaa	Next time you see her say "girl I'm gonna tear you up tonight"   That should get the message through|`|pTrjBgg2aa	take a drink and start making out again then dont be scared to do what to feel, let your hands take control|`|c8d25898c40e7e6915e612f57f1d7766aa	Got to get her in the mood dinner at your place, candles,  romance and if that doesn't work you need to have a serious talk because something isn't right.|`|VkXv4RInaa	get her this for valentines day; she will get the hint.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXvR97Wk...|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Take deep breath.  Open mouth.  Exhale words.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	You haven't had sex yet?  Wow.|`|el8yX5q3aa	I think if she wanted sex she would let you know..and it isn't right to pressure someone into it.  You want someone to make love to you because they are ready and not doing it because they feel coerced.    You don't want her resenting you for that.      I DO understand wanting to have sex especially when you are a virgin at your age.  You have hung in there this long...try a little longer until she can handle it.  She obviously holds her virginty close to heart and wants to be sure whoever she gives it to will be worthy of it and someone she can trust her heart to.    It is much different for a woman and sex.  They do tend to be more emotionally involved.....    She might be afraid of getting pregnant or getting a STD or something....like I said...it is MUCH different for a woman than a man.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Don't talk about it! Just let things happen naturally, for example while you guys are making out just go in for it, take it slow and slowly take off her bottoms , and if she's ready she'll let you continue and if not that's the perfect time to bring up the conversation and let her know how your feeling and also at the same time you don't rush her but you want to know how she feels and think about it.|`|3BrOSZujaa	just pull out a condom some where where you too are alone and she will if she wants. accept fate.|`|mz0RCtfXaa	well, this is what i did, ....uhhhh you wanna have sex with me?!?!?!?    uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yea??????    okokokookookokookokoko|`|TlU3zj61aa	Next time your making out try to take it a little further. But if she stops you or seems hesitant don't continue, just back off. That should spark a sex conversation.|`|TqYqQgxEaa	Well when ever both of you are getting kinda to the next level just go for it...|`|hyRj4eIjaa	ask. lol|`|MIR3eC5kaa	ok you dont want to get her preagnet you knw you arn't even married|`|iNV8wpZxaa	i think that if you have an open relationship you guys should just talk about it. i bet shes wondering the same things as you.|`|AA11489369	First off do you know if she wants to wait till marriage to have sex?   If you don't know, then ask (in person) what her view on sex is? Get it out in the open.  Or, when your making out and it starts to get out and heavy, start off slow. Take her shirt off. If your still hot and heavy, just keep slowly taking her clothes off, while you do the same. And before you know it, you both are naked and it's on.
l0xnIquFaa	i think its fine, its not overly mean n i think they will get the point|`|fCc1vqkNaa	ur situation is 80% same as mine..i cant go out at nite..cant stay outside after 7 pm..  we have the same parent species..haha  but im worst..  im 18..  cant drive..  cant go out..  cant have friends..  cant go clubbing..  cant do this..  cant do that..  recently my mum knew im kissing with my bf..  n she gave me 3 slaps..  n its really 'nice'..  n grounded for a month..  haha  i had a good performance in academic n co-curricular activities..  got 9 a's out of 11 subjects i took for trial exam..  i represent school for debates..state for other competitions..  but everything seems just not right for my mum..  but just let it be..  as long as she's happy..  sooner or later she'l let go of me..  n that time is coming soon..  im not worried..  i try 2 make my life happy..  cooking..  sewing..  baking cakes..  etc..etc..    =)|`|M5oMYc9Laa	This answer comes to you from a parent who's child is now well into adulthood 30+.  I know you just want to get away but perhaps you would be willing to consider staying if they weren't so strict and over protective.  I also think when they get your note they will be absolutely crushed and heartbroken.      Based on what you say they are do not trust you which makes them overreact and and hold on tighter instead of allowing you to have additional liberties as you gain maturity.  No doubt they they are worried you will get pregnant prematurely.   I know you are anxious to move out, become independent and begin your adult life.  You have only two more years to be a kid and the entire rest of your life to be an adult.  I can tell by what you wrote here that you are smart and I think you should be considering college before marriage becaus it will afford you the best opportunity for the highest earning capacity.  Getting married just to leave home is just not the answer. Keep mind that divorce rates in this country are very high and even higher amoung those that marry young.    What no one can tell you is just how hard it is fending for  yourself out there even under the best circumstances.  No doubt you love your fiancee and he loves you but you haven't even begun to know what life is all about.  A young woman your age should be dating lots of different people  going to parties, dances, football games, movies, proms and having fun.  It is so hard even for those of us that have experience, education and resources.  By the time you turn 18 you will be all burnt out. and trust me, wishing you hadn't taken on so much so soon.    Early in adulthood many young people solicit parental assistance to buy cars, homes, rent apartments, go to college, not to mention help with children.  If you take this radical an action at such an early age you run the risk of slamming the door on the opportunity for decent future relationship with them.    You say you have done all kinds of things, and your parents have no clue but don't play them cheap.   They once were your age.  It's likely that they did a lot of things once upon a time that would shock you which could also account for why they are so distrustful and over protective.    It sounds like there is a lot of dissention and tension in the home and that both you and your parents would benefit from family counseling.  There is no doubt that they love you and you love them but I think what you want to do is not advisable.  For the sake of your own future I hope you will reconsider.|`|OYcB4rvraa	Wow you are 16 and enagaged! Thats pretty intersting. I can see both sides becuase they want to be protective and make sure you dont do something stupid that will rin your life. But if they are going to let you get married at the age of 16 then I think that is a little crazy becvuase once you get married you can have sex,, so how can they not let you guys sit besid|`|8e0955220ed4a4405d699fae1bf2b11faa	i am a parent, and a young parent at that so i can see both sides of this story...    first off, i grew up in a situation like that, and it wasnt to be mean, or evil, it was to protect me. i didnt see it that way until i had my own two girls. you are the only YOU that they are going to have and its probably bad enough that you are engaged lol, now they think thier little girl doesnt need them.    i say dont go...why? because i did when i was younger and it was the stupidest thing i ever did. if your fiance loves you he will understand that you should respect your parents and just wait. trust and believe, if something happens and you go back home? all you are going to hear is "told you so" and that is sooo not fun.    take your time and just follow the rules until they cant make you any more!|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well i would just like to say that your 16, not even a legal adult yet. so technically your parents still have control over you. and im a little confused, do your parents know that your engaged? and has it ever occured to you that they only do the things they do that you think is overprotective because they care about you and love you? that letter is a little mean, but i think that your parents would be devastated either way. and in my opinion, your only 16. (and im not like old or anything so your getting this advice from a teenager too,) you dont know that what you want in life now is going to be what you want in 5 or 6 years. your not old enough to know that yet, you havent even finished high school. just thought id put that thought out there. best of luck! :)|`|AtJgXB59aa	at the beginning you kinda sound dead but then i get that you went to live with your fiance.... i think the letter is a bit harsh bt you were probably mad you wrote it so wait till you calm down and revise it bt i love tht youre standn up for yourself....(GUDLUCK)|`|9bdEPcWIaa	It sounds like you're engaged just to escape from your family.  I know it sounds like a cliche but you are so young to think about marriage now.  Once you leave it will be hard to finish school and continue more education, financial responsibilities will be overwhelming.     Please write another letter to your mom and dad, don't mention about you leaving but let them know how sad you are. I'm a mom and if my daughter told me how hurt she is I would absolutely modify things to help her.     Your mom made it clear that you'd be leaving when you turn 18, it's 24 months or less, by then you'd have at least a high school diploma and a choice to continue your education.  Economy is so very tough even for people with blue chip formal education are having a tough time finding jobs to make ends meet, do yourself a favor, don't move out yet.    I hope things get better for you...|`|jERevyR8aa	it's pretty harsh  obviously they care a lot about you  so they deserve better than that|`|AA10250756	At 16 you are much too young to be engaged. You have not experienced life. How would you support yourself if you moved out? You need to finish high school at the very least before you are engaged, married or living with someone. If you have a child, how will you support the child? You have no skills to offer an employer.  If you have trouble in school now, how will it be when you are cooking and cleaning as well? I suggest you and your parents go for family counseling. Most medical plans do pay for that.|`|X4UAMHhRaa	so, uhm... how are you and your fiance going to feed yourselves and pay the rent?    please think first. a lot of teenagers go through this whole "my parents are so uncool" thing, and the best way to get out of this is to finish college, get a good job then be independent. heck even college grads end up moving back to their parents. life is hard nowadays, especially with our current economy. unless your fiance is older, wealthy, has a permanent full-time job, dont go for it.|`|m40XxkSvaa	Well first of all you are only 16. How old is your fiance? I don't think that you are making a wise decision. You said in the letter that you were going to give them that if they found you they couldn't take you back home because of your age. Well if you aren't 18 then yes they can. Plus if your fiance is 18 or older he could get in serious trouble for that. I say you sit down and talk to your parents before you do something that you may end up regretting.|`|YPZXcxwBaa	It is a little harsh, but if they are as bad as you say, I guess you kind of have to slap them in the face to make them get the point. however, I would include a PS that say you love them (even if you actually dont ;-)), a picture, and a rose or something. This way they don't feel as hurt. Of course, they will be hurt no matter what.    I would also  think it over for at least a week, but it sounds like you already did that. I would, however, try to get close to your fiance's parents, because believe me, you will need advice from older people. It could be on anything to stains in the carpet to relationship problems. Also, try to get a friend or two that you can fall back on. It will help to have a support network.    Other than that, all I can say is good luck!
o88qLRgbaa	Thank you! Learn to enjoy it while you can. Youth is only there for you once.|`|AA11263103	i am 15, truly I think its funny, for those people. My favorite ones are young girls have sex and they are only 13.   Because we want to loved   Thats  i am doing(living life )  Most girls want to popular there for,make out and care what other people think of them  i do care about that (starting a career)|`|hJmVcWekaa	Ok I'm 15 and I have never had a boyfriend and I don't really care either.  There will be the right guy someday and I have got plenty of time for guys.  I think of that a majority of the time.  Probably 9/10 of the time but i also live by the moment.  So to answer your question, almost on a daily basis i have that goal.|`|Q30JCGhgaa	I agree =]|`|5O4kuA7Caa	WEll i know we have our whole lives ahead of us, but does that mean that we shouldnt enjoy our lives now??? if thats what we want to do, god dammit let us do it.    This is so stupid, this is the way it is today. we dont do it because everyone else does. we do it because we want to and thats what we do.|`|G6x9SCWoaa	hey  Well honestly? I agree with some of what your saying. It IS important for me to not always be thinking about boys and stuff.. but in moderation its fun.    to me, this is the age of experience. a chance to try new things! If, i make  a mistake( which I do) I know not to make it again.    To find yourself, or make something out of yourself, you have to not know who you are at least for a while.    Also, when I care about my looks it makes me feel confident and happy.  when I dont, i feel quite vulnerable.    having said that girls who JUST care about looks are shallow and superficial.    I dont Mean any Disrespect just my opinion on things|`|rVdcXJ8aaa	Well yes first of all this question is relevant to me i am 13 and here is my answer:      answer to ?   1: Well I'll tell you why, its because thats whats on our mind mostly due to changes in our body, hormones, and when hormones kick in then u have the problem of liking people and dating and am I too fat...      ?   2: Who says were aren't enjoyin being young?!? Yea i'm dating, yea I do care about my looks but I grew up with a whole bunch of brothers soo I am used to rough housing and I still do it... lol this question is probably more toward the girly girls cuz I'm tom-boy, for example make-up can be fun but I don't usually wear any cuz  a) its a hastle and b) It doesn't REALLY improve ur looks and I want a guy to like me for being me AND looking like me         ?   3: Well maybe not on a daily basis cuz usually i'm worried about wait did I do my home-work or ugh!I'm tired...But about having the goal to graduate and go to college, find mr. right, and start a family, yes I do have that goal though I still haven't figured out exactly what I envision in my future I do realize that thats what really matters|`|oNVRKVUGaa	Its simple    first off im 14 with a 4.0 and president of a ton of clubs at my school    And its not like me wearing make up worrying about how i look and dating guys is making me any less deticated....    Its just like girls want to have that feeling of maturity as soon as possible and its not like you can't do these things and not have long term goals       I don't get the fitting in thing though... i mean sure im pretty popular but for me atleast its not that big of a deal...
QIQNzE11aa	From what i have recently learned about India and marriage there, divorce is horrendous and a woman loses her standing in the country. This is why divorce is so low there, not becaue they are happier. <br>  <br>  Which is better? I'd say either can turn out well and either can turn out badly. I'd say there's no guarantee either way. It depends on the type of person that gets into the marriage. Are you willing to work out all the hard times and work to get through anything that comes your way? If so, a marriage of either type will work out. But most tend to run at the first real signs of problems. I'm not talking about small problems, i am talking about the types of large problems that comes in ones life. Job loss, injuries, kids, death of children.. these things are not easily gotten through and must be worked at extra hard. It's easy to get along when things are good. It also takes problem solvers in a marriage to make it work and the strength to follow through with the solutions.<br>  <br>  I've heard of many arranged marriages leading separate lives in the name of staying married. Though, i met many who do the same thing though theirs started out as a love match. But is that really worth while? Most could fix the relationship if they went and sought help, yet most do not. <br>  <br>  Love matches are often jumped into too quickly. Someone knows another person for a year and thinks they know they can make it a life time on how they are feeling at that moment. So many end in the long run as they weren't compatible to begin with. You can be different and still compatible. You can have many things in common with each other and not be compatible. Two extremely strong willed people aren't very compatible. <br>  <br>  Often arranged marriages are for convience and status and not for compatibility. So many do not work, just many countries where it's still practiced do not allow for divorce easily. <br>  <br>  If you consider divorce as the only means to a failed marriage, than i think you have the wrong impression of what a good marriage is. My grandparents married for love in the beginning but ended up hating each other the rest of their lives. They lived completely separate lives under one roof and remained married. Is that truly a marriage that suceeded? I don't think either would have agreed that it was a successful marriage. <br>  <br>  I married for love and have been together for 17 years and am very happily married. I'd consider that a successful marriage so far. We put in the hard work and dedication and worked through the horrors that life has thrown at us. But you are right about one thing, love isn't everything in a good marriage. But hating each other and remaining married doesn't make it successful either. <br>  <br>  I met, recently, a woman who agree'd to an arranged married in India. Her husband left her and her entire standing is ruined now. They will divorce, though it will make her look terrible. Make it harder for her to get another marriage and give her no say in the next one. Her life is ruined, or so she explains to me. So, was her arranged marriage better than mine?<br>  <br>  It takes understanding of both people, their personalities and their goals to understand if a life time commitment can work out. I've also seen some great relationships work out that never got married and have been together more than 20 years. In the end, it's hard to know if it will work out. In the end, if 2 people aren't working on it, it will fail. If it fails and they stay together, that doesn't make it any better than a divorce would.|`|AA12346188	Every marriage holds disappointments - someone said long back.<br>  Marriage is a marriage whether it is arranged or love.<br>  It depends on the couple on their common sense, logic, observation, understanding, adoptation, compromise and willingness to take on responsibilities throughout life and come out successful in flying colours.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Divorce is low in India not because of arranged marriages, but because a divorced woman is ostracized by her community. She is often not supported by her family because she is seen as a traitor to her family since they arranged the marriage and paid the dowry. And no other man will marry her<br>  <br>  Since most girls going into arranged marriages are young, uneducated and without any work experience, they have no way to support themselves if they are not living with either their father or their husband. Those that do leave often end up as prostitutes because that is the only way they can find to support themselves. <br>  <br>  "While India feels that one should have the right to divorce, it is still a highly stigmatizing action. Women are looked upon more harshly than men in this regard. There continue to be segments of Indian society that feel divorce is never an option, regardless of how abusive or adulterous the husband may be which adds to the greater disapproval for women. A divorced woman often will return to her family, but may not be wholeheartedly welcomed. She puts, especially if she has children, an economic burden on her family and is often given lowly household tasks to perform. There is also the risk that a divorced woman's presence would ward off possible marriages for other daughters within the household."<br>  <a href="http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Divorce.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Divor...</a>|`|z6d6k1Ltaa	Love is often lust & may just be a passing fancy. Often couples don't date long enough to figure that out. They get married & a couple years later realize they have little in common. Also, people are just prone to getting tired of one another or begin to find another person's habits annoying with time. I don't imagine all arranged marriages are that great either, but I doubt they are worse. Also, some cultures frown more on divorce & people will stick things out no matter how bad. And around the middle east, women can get killed for wanting a divorce. But I'm sure there are many arranged marriages that do work, where people grow to love & respect each other, in part because they may share common goals, common culture, similar family values, similar social status or whatever.|`|jOcFXCfMaa	it's difficult question to ans cause arrange marriage may work for some and for others it may be a complete tourture cause they cant get out of it because of society and the reputation of their families, if the marriage is a failure.on the other hand in love marriages tolarance level is low so problems occur very often but most of the couples sort it out cause they r in love while in arrange marriages people fall in love after they get married so a reasonable amount of time is lost in knowing each other and adjusting with families.<br>               it can only b said that arrange marriage is best for who it works for but in any kind of relationship the most important thing is love and taking care of your partner and as long as that'a going well no one really cares whether it's love marriage or arrange.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	Very good advice but you need to watch your spelling|`|AA11695632	Divorce rate does not measure Happiness in marriage.. Maturity does not mean to bare the unhappiness as an individual. Indian social system certifies character of person and torn apart the character on anything one does which does not meet social criteria.. So most people  continue with the marriage rather than taking social embarrassment. Indian society is Hippocratic and has dual side. Persons are different in public and and opposite in private and one side is always not been seen to world.. <br>  <br>  Love is also not really known to most indians in general as love can never fail in the life... Love is not about togetherness of getting separated.. Its a feeling good for other person without any reason.. and when somebody really loves other one, than that will last for the live whether one lives together in marriage or not.. <br>  <br>  There is no comparison between LOVE and Arranged Marriage.. <br>  <br>  Arranged one if turns out good will be part of LOVE and if not worked well, it will be disaster for people in marriage whether they live it together for life or get separated.|`|XQWInrsBaa	It's not which marriage is better. Arrange or love. Partners make marriages better. In love marriages after sometime they loose their interests in each other while in arrange marriages after marriage they came to know each other interests more better. I m not saying that this happen in all arrange marriages or love marriages. There should be understandability and adjustments between partners. If both of them go missing then the problem occurs. Patience and tolerance should be there. Some teenagers say that they r in love at the age of 18, 19 and soon they got married to their partners but they did not get enough matureness to understand the commitment of a marriage and hence they fall. Both partners should understand every aspect of it. In other countries ppl don't have patience and not much wiseness as indians have. So am i right????|`|UKqDzATkaa	You are right. Marriage needs working. Whether it is love marriage or arranged marriage. Some people hate love marriage and some people opposite. When you are going to marry, boy should think whether he is financially stable, can he understand girls mind so and so and same way girl should can I give him happiness, and am I really matured to handle tough situations so and so. If everything is ok, then they should step into marriage. Otherwise it will happen like my case where I felt I can give all happiness to my wife,but my wife thought she will get all the care, but she never thought what she can give to her husband. So when I didn't fill her expectations in her expected way, she left me and now I don't know whether she will divorce me or not.|`|tA1ztvXaaa	personally I feel the Indians have it the right way, who knows any child better then it's parents.

If it is you & he just has the kids like for a weekend, then he's being a pretty lame dad. If he has them full-time, I might cut him some slack, especially if the 18 year old or both kids are good kids & aren't running wild. If you don't have custody at all, then maybe you are looking to find fault, while being unable to provide anything better yourself. If the latter is the case, then you & the ex are lame & then you probably don't need to worry at all, cause kids in that situation usually know that & are used to taking quite good care of themselves cause no one else ever has.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	The law in MD is 13yrs of age to be left alone.|`|Ql6qFk85aa	Check out this website.

I consider myself to be a very protective mom, who has two teen boys, and the idea of them staying home with no adult supervision at the ages of 14 and 15 makes my heart go from 60 beats per minute to 100, however if the father of your son doesn't do this on a regualr basis, I wouldn't fret over it to much, but if it is something that is happening to much, it may be time to put your foot down and bring the protective mother bear out in you and protect your cub? Also while it is not fair that the older brother is taking on the responsibility of the dad to a degree, you must remember that many of us older siblings have ourselves sat with our younger siblings, I know I did, I babysat my little brother many, many times in my childhood, I didn't like it, but that was just the way it was, so it is no different for your son, thats the breaks when you have siblings who are younger. I admire the fact that you have your radar on and are aware of what is going on with your children, as many parents don't care. I am unsure of who has physical custody? but I am assuming the father of your children does? However this doesn't mean you are not allowed to voice your concern, either way, who has custody or who doesn't shouldn't matter when it comes to this paticular situation. So my advise is for you to bring out the mother bear in you and protect your cub, but bring the calm, concerned mother bear to the forefront, don't approach your ex with fighting on your mind as this will only make your ex feel threatened, and you will stike out, just calmly express your concern very bluntly and simple, in a adult mature manner. So be protective without causing drama, good luck to you, Penelope|`|RBRq8406aa	I agree with most of the responses posted that if it really bothers you can check with the laws for that area. But also agree that need to calm down a little a 13 year is old enough to be by self. When I was that age my parents would take weekend trips that I hated so would stay home entire weekend by myself. My parents were not divorced and wondering if its really just a way to get something on your ex because as stated I would stay entire weekends alone and my parents were married and ok with it. That was over 30 years ago also so different time period.|`|ad2f9df6e51923e9b041c490b085104eaa	Regardless of what is considered legal, I wouldn't trust my teenagers to be home alone ... overnight.  Would they know what to do in the event of a fire or robbery?? That being said, if you can't change this, you should at least have the phone numbers of a few neighbors, just in case of an emergency. Your 18 year old needs to learn some responsibility right now, and know that he can't just leave his younger brother at home...It's not the end of the world to have to "babysit".  Their dad is wrong for leaving them so often, If he can't be a dad and stay home to ensure the safety of his children, he shouldn't have them. If this was a woman leaving her children to have a sleepover, she would definitely be called a horrible mother, whore, among other degrading things.|`|DRdxTlhTaa	i don't think there's anything wrong with them being home alone, even overnight, as long as the 18 year old is there.  after all, he's an adult(even if he is in high school)!!  a 13 year old shouldn't be left alone overnight, but surely should be able to take care of himself during the day.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I think it is important to discuss this with your ex. It is okay once in awhile, but I dont know many 13 year olds that like staying home all night by themselves. Offer to take your son when your ex wants to stay out for the night. He is your son too right? Good luck
8cuPVvYnaa	I don't view teenagers that way at all. There are a lot of "scoundrels" in the adult world as well. I enjoy teens. They are at a time of "becoming". They are becoming adults, independent, more sure of themselves, more outspoken...  And I don't believe that becoming a rebel is just something that happens because you're a teen. I know many teens who never rebelled (majorly). However, some parents don't know how to allow their children to gain more and more independence, so there are some who do rebell to try to get it for themselves.|`|OYcB4rvraa	I ahte it when people view teens as bad peiople.

Attempt to glance at him, keep doing it until he notices you looking.  When he looks at you look back down.  In the guys mind he will know your either checking him our or think he is ugly.

Tell her that you hate him, that you hate how she's changed. Tell her how she's changed, and tell her what you've missed about her. Tell her that YOU have been eating alone, been cleaning up after her messes, been depressed. Tell her what her boyfriend told you.

Never let no one put u down|`|71qGan9Raa	Your mom is going through a lot of changes right now. She has never had a "me" moment all her life. It has always been about someone else. This is her "freedom" time. She'll get over it!!! Life is all about change. She may be grieving from the divorce or grieving with this new guy. I think if she just spent some "alone" time with him she would come to the same conclusions as you....hate!!! If this guy is as terrible as you make him sound, she won't be with him that long either. So, hang in there. Don't shut out your mom but definitely give her some space. Maybe you can spend some weekends or holidays with your dad? Do you have an aunt or grandma that you could also visit??? Let your mom decide what kind of man she is dating. She'll figure it out and you don't want to lose her to this guy because she'll be needing you when they are through. Good luck.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	your mom sounds sprung from what your telling me. anyone that changes for the worse like that and completely disregards everything and everyone is sprung. i dont know what it is but dude has got your mom's head in the clouds. in that state it'll be impossible to talk to her. especially since your probably just a kid to her. but try and sit her down and talk. if she won't listen make her. but don't get rude. KEEP YOUR COOL.    if you can, move in with your pops. i hope he knows of what your mom has become. this should be an easy move if he does know what your having to go through. same goes for his gf.      your mom is being considerate of your feelings as you put it. she's not letting him move in until you get into college. so if you can put up with her childish behavior until then, which i hope isn't a long time from now, ride the storm out. but you do have options. good luck.|`|KojH3RiUaa	If I were you, I'd probably move in with your dad. I'd talk to him about truly considering family counseling. It could help. My main focus would be to try counseling. Tell your dad how you feel, it may very well strengthen your relationship with him. Clearly your mother is set in her path in being with this pathetic excuse for a human being. I apologize you're going through this. You're definitely not sounding selfish or self-pitying. You sound extremely outgoing and willing to change things for the better. I wish I could give you a big hug right now, as lame as it sounds. I know how angry a person can get. I'm having plenty of problems myself... if you want to distract yourself for a bit you can read my resolved questions from today. Trust me, I'm going through hell too. I know you don't want someone to tell you "Everything will be okay" because it's not okay right now. You have to deal with the present, not the future. Your mother is making a heartbreaking decision. She's basically abandoning you for her boyfriend, who by the sound of things is just going to leave in the end anyways. As much hatred as you may have for her when he leaves, you should try to be there for her, because she'll have nobody when it's all said and done. If moving in with your dad isn't an option then start saving money for an apartment.     Everything will run its course and I wish you nothing but the best.    Feel free to e-mail me if you want to talk more.    xannettereneex3@yahoo.com|`|QA62m6Y7aa	ive seen this happen to a few of my friends.     When parents divorce and get new boyfriends or girlfriends they end up giving that person more attention than their kid, its terrible really. Maybe next time you talk to your mom remind her that she IS a parent, and you are still a kid. and if things dont get better than maybe try living with your dad, maybe then she'll realize what a mistake she made.     but goodluck with everythinng, i know how stressful and how bad it can make a person feel.  i wish you the best of luck :]|`|FeqMZsQaaa	The best thing I can say is that you need to just keep being honest with her and telling her how you feel.    Try just ignoring her a little bit, (it's been fairly effective for me in the last week, cause I'm in the same boat but the stupid thang already moved in!)    If he does move in, move in with your dad. Maybe that will cause your mom to see the light. Eventually she will see the kind of person he really is.|`|ofMV2sS5aa	I see what your saying, if there is no possibility of you and your mother's boyfriend getting along maybe after collage you should just move out. (I wouldn't be able to get along with him that's for sure) That would save you the time of having to look at him and if you missed your mother you could just call her.   I know its frustrating to see someone you care about change because of a relationship but if your mother is happy i think you might want to let her have that.   As far as not spending time with your mother maybe you could sit down with her and discuss just having a you two night and try to negotiate leaving her boyfriend out of it? If she can't make room in her life for you then don't even bother with her. Look to your closest friends to try to find a mother figure. But I hope it never comes to that; it sounds like your mother would be better off without him anyway. Good luck with everything anyway!   ~K8|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Talk to your dad.  You are being actively neglected by your mom so see if you can move in with your dad.   At age 12, a judge will hear you, and at 14 you have the absolute right to determine which parent you will stay with. Have your dad take you to court and change the custody AND the child support. This at least takes the child support money away from your mom's boyfriend.     She won't miss you, but she may miss the child support money.    Your mom has fallen in with a professional user and abuser... a Lothario that can't keep a relationship. About all you can do is stay out of her orbit and let them ride that roller-coaster without dragging you along for the ride.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	I know EXACTLY how you feel.    My mom was the same way. I just left, I couldn't take her holier-than-thou husband. She married him three months after my parents' divorce was settled, and he is the most ignorant, hypocritical jerk I have ever met, and she completely abandoned my brother and me for him.    Talk to your mom ALONE. Tell her all that you feel, and tell her not to interrupt, because that can derail your train of though if she tries to defend him or herself. Lay everything out on the table. Ultimately, I would suggest moving in with your dad. If only to make yourself happier, then maybe it will help her realize that you are her son and she will appreciate you more. It's sad to have to be faced with such an ultimatum, but it may be the only way to get through to your mom.

I do know you need to leave anyone who is abusing you.  However you need to be careful how you do it.  You already know he is violent and abusive, that isn't going to change. If you stay with him your life may be in danger. You need to contact a women's shelter, they have experience in this. They can help you through this, and help you to get away from him in a safe way.

XJlD2kPsaa	It's fine if you hate your family. There's nothing you can do to change the fact that you hate them. If you hate them, you hate them right? The only thing that can change is them. Can you change their behaviour? no, you can't. It's up to them. A solution is to well, maybe put them in rehab. Maybe run away if possible. And maybe you should find love from someone else if you don't already have like a boyfriend or girlfriend(forgot to look at your name or maybe your bisexual).

vnJG8UYJaa	Your father is obligated to pay the monthly child support ordered by the court.  It is his choice regarding whether he will send extra for some new clothes.  I understand that the CS is supposed to cover clothing, but a lot of times the amount is so little that mothers have a hard time making it stretch.  This doesn't mean that he has to send more.  It is his choice.  Can you try earning some money on your own by babysitting or shoveling snow, mowing grass, etc?    I also have to ask, do you need new clothes or do you want new clothes.  There is a difference.  Make sure that if he does send extra, you take the time to thank him.  Things are tough for families right now.  Try to be understanding with both your parents.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Get a job|`|JZIzUM5iaa	i think he might.|`|c3b11df445c85a57854c19a1ff159cddaa	it would be much more helpful for you and the good of mankind if he sent you a dictionary instead|`|NHIQl6VTaa	sometimes mail is slow.

okh3hL8taa	What would you say is the first thing that you think of when you think of or find out that you daughter is pregnant?   Make sure she is getting medical attention.    If they are getting married at 18?  In the states 18 is an adult, and marriage is legal at 18.      If you kid has a STD that they got from someone else?  I'd seek medical attention for my child and make sure she informed everyone she had sex with to get checked themselves.    When they first start to drive?  I have no problems with my children learning to drive when i is time.  I'll be sending them to drivers school so they can get a license.    When they get a boyfriend or girlfriend?  I look forward to my girls dating when their time comes.      I have been giving my children "the talk" their entire lives.      What to you do when you find out that your kid does drug or is alcoholic, either doing it to be cool or doing it because they are angry or depressed because of something that goes on in the family?  I doubt very much any of my children will get into drugs or alcohol, however if they do I'll be right there seeking help for them.  My children have been taught and they know very well that when they are hurt or angry they can talk to me without fear that something is going to happen...and Yes they have come to me with certain issues     If you child has an abortion because they are afraid that you would hate them or kick them out of the house? (even though you love them, you are just upset that they would even do that)  My children know that abortion is not a form of birth control...they also know that their mother is pro choice.  Which means their mother believes in their right to choose to abort, to carry to term and adopt said pregnancy out or to carry to term and raise said pregnancy.      If they caused a car wreck and they got hurt?  Karma    If you found out that your kid has trouble making friends?  Nothing, not everyone on this planet was meant to have an entire entourage.      As for you...you may be 21 but you are far from being an adult.  The reason you don't like children and you find them so annoying is because you are not much more than a child yourself, take a look at the job you have, working at taco bell...When I was 21 I was an administrative assistant and going to college fulltime.|`|hQsvuxs3aa	why do you need to know if you don't have kids|`|dGBbFwFWaa	too too many  questions to answer.. so i just rather ask ...IS THIS SOME KIND OF RESHEARCH for a school project  its sounds similar to one of my niece asked me not long ago.. all i can say is.. parents should be more open to their kids and let the school help out if they have the right info.. good luck|`|luKyK3Duaa	OK that's a lot of questions, All im saying is if they get into trouble let them know your disappointed but still there for them if they need you, get hurt or pregnant, its happened you have to deal with it, so stay positive, if they do anything that you don't approve of that's up to them, you be there for them and tell them how you feel about it. if you are to strict they will rebel against you, not strict enough they may feel you don't care and stop respecting you.     everyone has to make there own mistakes you never learn from other peoples, because you see other people as other people, they made there choices but that's different from you.somehow.    newho everyone parents differently, no one can say they are the perfect parents so its just best to talk to your kids and help them make the right choices for them and there life.     newho    that's my view on things
XbsuY1ogaa	My mother walked in on me three times when I was still living at home.  I came over my boyfriend's house to see his roommate and his girlfriend having sex on the couch.  My roommate came into my room one night when my boyfriend and I were having sex and started a conversation, oblivious to the fact that we were naked and in the middle of some business.  Pretty much every time me and my boyfriend, or anyone in living in his house (5 roommates) everyone (even guests) can hear. The walls are so thin and the floors creak, it's kind of funny after a while.|`|j6RDbnl6aa	OK, so I like this teacher a lot. Let's call him . . . Germany.    So I had stayed after school with two of my friends, Lisa and Estefany, and I am kind of free spirited so I lay down anywhere and hug anything.  So I lay down by his car, like 15 away and I didn't look at the time, it was around the time he leaves, so I call Lisa to lay with me but she is too busy looking inside teachers cars, when she yells, "Oh Hi GERMANY!"  I quickly get up and mutter,"oh ****!" quite loudly, then I say Hi.    Lisa told me he made a wtf face. i felt so embarassed  and before that my friend was stalking him and he was coming out and seen us, i quickly turned and walked away while sliding my hands against the bushes.    now he thinks i'm weird. *sigh.|`|D6pfv64maa	ok i really didn't want to say anything to anyone about this but here goes.  i know what it is like to be really embarrassed around your boyfriend.  i will tell u what happen to me that hopes it makes u feel better but it still till this day doesn't make me feel any better.  the first time that my ex and i were making love we were almost done and i move and when i move well i farted and he heard it boy was i so embarrassed my ex wasn't nasty about it about and didn't make me feel bad. hope this makes u feel better|`|EwNrlF8jaa	My fiance farted while making love to me after that its a fart fest between us.

Personally, with my mum, I wouldnt, however ive never been grounded lol.
KTj9g2mGaa	talk to him in person and become friends. then get his number from him. otherwise you will probably just text him but never talk in person, and you will look really scarred and shy.   Also, if you don't get his, just give him your's.

I don't go to catholic or private school, but it is still pretty strict.  Sometimes when you are alone with a person, it is very easy to tell the what you want to say.  So get together, go to the mall, movies etc. Just try not to sound like you are bragging or being a jerk when you tell her.  Trust me, I am 13 and I hate it when guys try to show off.    give it a try!|`|dFQ5Xbj2aa	umm....i dunno why you wanna do this but ok...i'll help you anyway. maybe wear a shirt thats shortish ( like ends at the waist) and stretch up. maybe she'll catch a glance at your abs.

ROWNVIUVaa	Of course not, silly. It can involve whatever the planners choose. Strippers are just a cliche' that some men choose to have. Not all of us want dirty girls rubbing their diseases on us.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	No, my fiance just went to one last year... they went camping, canoeing and fishing for a weekend, creates a much stronger bond than watching naked women with fake breasts for a few hours.    My fiance isn't interested in having any strippers at his either.    It kind of irritates me that people just talk about this like it's a fact of life. I wouldn't care if my fiance went to a strip club now, but in celebration of our pending nuptuals? Doesn't make sense to me.|`|CaPZrWVWaa	the fun ones do!|`|s7gWSqV5aa	Like candy cane stripers?

I just don't get it.|`|05ff5bb18eb4c096ef430ca99d7dad2daa	No, each party is designed differently. My cousins bachelor party was hosted at their local pool hall with beer and chips. Sounds like it was pretty fun.|`|s4FEJiNHaa	not all of them, but probably most do.  It's just a stupid tradition like most of the crap that goes on at the actual wedding!  Get over it!  He's still gonna marry u afterwards and he'll still be disease free, so quit worrying and just let him have his fun with his buds.|`|FjwdmI0oaa	NO !! They come after the wife forgets or just quits doing what attracted her man to her in the FIRST place!! And do not get all ticked off at me this goes for the men also ! I am speaking from 36 years of marriage experience. A lot of times men and women get married for for different reasons. The women get married thinking she can change her man into what she wants and a man gets married to the women he wants thinking (and hoping) will not change.DO NOT get complacent with each others wants and desires.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	No and I pray that my future husband's doesn't.

My husband's bachelor party was at the pool hall and mine was at home with the girls.  Then we all got together after that and went to the club.  It was the best ever!|`|lTOeMNnraa	well sometimes they do|`|p5YEzLxeaa	THEY SHOULD!|`|psKx7NF8aa	No.  I didn't want any.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Nope, not all.  My husband has been to 3 bachelor parties....only one involved a strip club.  One involved a night of booze and x-box and the other they went to a "game park" that had go-cart, laser tag, mini-golf, and video arcades.|`|LEvoWDvnaa	Nope. But please understand its away to say good bye to his Friends and ring in a new part of his life.|`|F7O0nLK1aa	no, but there is nothing wrong with it. let him have some fun for a night, you get him forever.|`|TzCBMtNKaa	No, but my fiance's friends keep saying they are getting him one just to make me mad. Personally, I would be a little upset/sad if he ends up having one, because I just feel it's disgusting. Why would he want to look at a naked woman?! Even though he says he doesn't care, I don't think he would want some guy rubbing his "manhood" all over me. It's just gross. You can do other things and have such a great time.
BzYbEa6Taa	While I do agree that she overreacted, you also need to understand that until your 18 and on your own she has the right to tell you what she feels and in a way what you can and cannot do.   I too love body art but fear needles like the plague so I can understand about the  temp tattoos but don't let it get you down, there is Always henna ;)|`|hQsvuxs3aa	your mom is a freak who doesn't love temporary tattoos!|`|ARiPzGIkaa	It isn't normal that you wear fake tattoos if you're over the age of 7.|`|wxnfDptaaa	overeacting just isnt the word|`|2e5a7c8a2287633977e955d0ed3fe521aa	your mom  loves and really cares about you.|`|lwFo3IWtaa	Yes your mom is over reacting, Im an adult and I also like fake tattoos!|`|Thy29qMYaa	My mom is the same way.  She is probably just wanting to have what's best for you.  In a few years you'll be on your own without your mom and you don't have to go by her rules so don't worry.|`|WkdW04cNaa	She is over reacting a little.  I think that all parents go through this at one time or another.  I think that she probably would be more comfortable if you weren't liking those things but it could just take her some time to realize that it isn't so bad.  It takes time.........I doubt that you could totally  accept her ways all at once either.  It works both ways.  When you think she is over reacting, stop and take a look at yourself and ask yourself if you could stand wearing the clothes she wears every day, or her jewelry, or listen to her music.......you probably would over react if you were expected to pay for her things or live like that.  Just try and understand that it isn't easy for her.  Try to gradually bring these things into your life.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Katrina people who work together have to be friends.Otherwise the the situation becomes untenable and can effect the other people at work too.Jealousy is a curse. Don't be judgemental a work practices.At least until your more certain that there's a fly in the ointment
AA10576394	You leaving when she comes over is just going to make things worse. For one, it puts strain on your husband and step son by making the situation uncomfortable for them, and secondly it gives her control of your house.    I think just making small talk, and not avoiding their company is the best thing.  Maybe you could sit down and watch the games with them.  But I think you making things easier for you ie pizza and paper plates is a good idea.  If you put more effort into their visiting, it's only going to anger you more when she is not helping out.    But dont let her push you out of your own house.  Her being rude is HER problem, not yours.  That is the price your stepson has paid, not you.  So for the sake of your family, just think of it as a bratty kid visiting, smile, and thank the good Lord when she leaves.|`|hbCq5h0Oaa	cook something for you're self only.    and when she asks whens dinner ready say cook it you're self|`|c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	You need to set some rules that if they are going to be living there, that they need to grow up and help, what do they expect to be taken care of until the day you guys are gone? what are they going to do then? How are they going to support themselves, you need to make them do something, if they get mad, they can move out, pay real bills, and have to cook and clean on their own. Be firm and let them know that it is unacceptable, not only should you just be upset by the daughter in law, but the stepson, he allows her to act this way, the only way this will get fixed is if you talk to him, he talks to her, and they start a cleaning routine or they are out.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Good for you! I'd be tired of it too. You might try suggesting that you would like some help. She probably thinks you haven't minded doing all the work. After all you have been doing it for 5 years now with out complaint. (it sounds like) Hope your situation gets better!|`|LwCAph6Paa	she is not happy cuz you are not her real mom if you can let her go see her other mom if she cant email me and i will tell you a new way|`|kdN0iRdtaa	well i think u should tell them it may not be easy but it might work hope things work out. :D|`|QswdY6hcaa	I wouldn't wanna help you either because you're a control freak. If she's coming to visit with her husband she's a GUEST and guests are not required to do anything for you. You don't have to serve them anything to eat, but you sure can't expect help either. Besides she's married to your step son not to you. As long as they get along it's their business. You have no right over the relationship or her behaviour in your house (your husband's house actually). But like I said, no1 expects you to cook for them either, your not a slave. But if you do it, don't expect help.|`|okh3hL8taa	Just remember she is married to your step son and HE choose her.  The fact that you don't like her is a moot point.  If you don't want to be around here then don't be.  Don't invite them to your home if you don't like her.  But remember your step son is now a "packaged" deal.  If you invite him you also invite his wife.  This issue will probably begin to affect your own marriage if you don't learn a bit of tolerance.|`|08d1e5233f3b30ec082c65faefd9a480aa	My first thought is where is your husbands support and why does he allow this?  Its your house too, which means you make the rules!  Have you spoke to your husband about this?  I would do that and then set the rules.  If they don't follow them then don't let the spoiled brats come over anymore! You'd just be letting them have control by leaving when they come over!  Also, have you tried to connect with them in anyway?  Maybe try getting to know more about their interest even if that means watching ball games.  It could help!  Good luck and STAY STRONG!!!|`|njT0e7Upaa	hey. buy her something she likes. talk about what she is into and just tell her you really want to be friends and get along more better. hope helps|`|AA11389288	You should let them know how you feel.Tell her nicely and politely.She probably not trying to hurt you on purpose.Talk to your stepson about it too.He would want you to have a good relationship with his wife.Good Luck:)|`|MHFuJGdGaa	She sounds like the perfect woman to me.    Also, instead of just being passive-aggressive with the paper plates and all, have you tried actually talking to her?  Not just asking her, but actually sitting down with her and having a conversation and letting her know you don't appreciate being treated like a servant?  You know, sometimes (I don't know where I read this) people don't respond to passive aggression and nagging.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Good for you!!    Next, you should start yelling at her.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	Perhaps you should print this out and hand it to her as you seem to have spoken your point quite succinctly in the question.    I would like to ask though, does your step-son help out with the cooking or cleaning? Does your husband? If they don't, why should your daughter in-law? Why should YOU, for that matter?    I don't think it should be a case of girls do housework and men don't, that may well be the problem in your daughter in-laws eyes. Try talking to her?|`|diQ0oodqaa	I don't blame you, I think I'd be gone, too. Of course, you'll have the mess to clean up when you come home.     Have you tried "inviting" her to help you cook, clean while they're there? I think many girls just don't know how to do anything to start with, so they stay close to their men instead of any women around.    You have to take care of you, hope your step son's dad knows how you feel, if not, tell him. Then leave when they come or go into another section of the house and don't cook for them.|`|6gK5dzTdaa	The way I see it is . . . you're the adult here, you're the cooking and cleaning up so she is the one that needs to find things to chat with you about and finds way to be friends with you.    If it will not cause any problems with your husband, then the next time they are there to enjoy your meal, let them know up front that "tonight is your turn to clean up"  When your finished with your meal, and all is ready to get up from the table, state to the  lazy girlfriend that the boyfriend will be able to help her find where everything goes while in the kitchen for clean up duty.    Or, you can try inviting her lazy butt to help clear and then clean the kitchen.  Say it out loud in front of every one so that the step son can hear it and can also see her reaction.  You are not their slave.

yIHlvPFfaa	this could be wither really good or really bad  i think itd be nice only cause im single but others might find it creepy and weird and stuff and if she doesnt like you... well thats going to suck but if she does she may return the kiss so good luck with that|`|7VMLssSnaa	Um does she like you?    If she likes you and you like her. Go up to her ask her out and if she says yes ask for a kiss. If a guy came up to me and just kissed me i'd be kinda freaked. So don't do it out of random.|`|XbsuY1ogaa	If I didn't know him, I'd beat him to a pulp.  If I knew him and wasn't interested, I probably would avoid him for the rest of my life.  If I knew him and kind of liked him, I'd get into it.|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	This seems so romantic, it may be best to talk to one of her friends to get her honest opinion of you. If it is positive go for it, thats a great way to go for a first kiss, I wish that happened to me :)  If she is the typical shy type though then I would advice getting her alone, calling her name so she stops and looks holding her hand and asking her to be yours, or come up with something romantic to suit her interests.|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	aww that would be like the most romantic thing ever :):)!!    make sure she doesnt HATE u first but lol.....    if anything she will be flattered...or better case scenario she will be swept off her feet at ur gesture..    that my opinion anyway|`|enEvZqPBaa	i would probably punch him in the face and then go tell my parents. if i didnt like the guy.    but if it were this one guy..... well id be surprised but iwould probably enjoy it|`|H7v497GGaa	dont get it the wrong way but you should find another way of letting her know you like her. i dont think its the best way of letting her know you like her.
AA10378030	Dont say anything to your poor mom... But, every once in a while, give your dad "the look" like you KNOW whats going on.... let him squirm. Watch how fast his attitude changes towards you and your mom.... hopefully he will dump this home wrecker... good luck ?|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	No you should not tell her.  Your father should tell her, if it is to be told.<br>  There is nothing hard about this.  Your mother would be doubly hurt if it came from you.<br>  <br>  If you have it in your mind that there is some "right" in this, you are not understanding the situation.  at all.  There is only wrong present and your father's to admit.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Do what you consciously think is right. But bear in mind, telling your mother could destroy your family which is something your father obviously didn't think about.|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	You should talk with your father first. Give him a chance to come clean, that way your parent's relationship will have a better chance of healing than if your mom has to find out from you. If he won't, then tell your mom. (But give him a reasonable amount of time, as that is a very difficult conversation for him to have)|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Do not put yourself in the middle.  You must speak up to your Dad.  I would say "If my suspicsions are correct I think you need to speak to Mom about your actions."  <br>  <br>  If he starts objecting, telling you there is nothing going on, or you are crazy.  Simply say "I do not want to be placed in this situation.  This is between you and Mom."|`|TJezsCkHaa	stay out.she will find out one day,and better to find it her way than you telling her.It will be harder to know that you know about it.And when it happens,don't mention than you knew.But try to talk to your dad and tell him what you saw,maybe you explained it wrong|`|AA11755944	stay out of it.  your mother either knows or will find out.|`|qr16GzNnaa	That is bad and a hard decision. First talk to your father about his behaviour if it is something he does regular trust me, if you love your Mum tell her, because it will hurt now but it will hurt far more years to come. Talk to your father and find out what is going on and as I said if it is something that he has been doing on a regular then tell. If your father have no respect for your mother and her home then that could never be good. The decision is yours so think hard about it before you do anything. If your father is up to no good and have no intention to  stop it is best to tell your Mum. If he leaves her for this other woman and she find out you know about what he did and you never tell that is going to hurt a whole lot.|`|10ECFLYSaa	You have to tell her, yes it will be hard to do but that is something that she needs to know. Some things are better left unsaid but this is not one of them. How would you feel if your husband was cheating on you and your daughter knew about it but did not tell you. She needs to be given the chance to confront him.|`|y1hH8UtQaa	speak to your father, that is an awful situation to be in, if you tell your mum you could end up being the bad guy! def speak to your father.
WkdW04cNaa	I think you both need to calm down and relax.  No reason to be shaking down the house over 15 minutes on the phone.  Why do you think your mom is using your phone to talk to this boyfriend and not her own phone?  That doesn't make sense to me.   I do know this........whether or not your mom is making sense, she is the one who makes the decisions, not you.  You need to listen to her and do as she says.  I am sure she wasn't happy with you telling her what she should be doing.  If you are doing the right thing and she is not, then you need to ask her to talk about it when everyone has calmed down.  You need to tell her your feelings and find out what is going on with her.  Is that possible?|`|ENQkQ6JKaa	Sneak out the window!!!! BTW GRAB UR CELL AND CALL 911!!|`|4Hy97dkMaa	i would lock my door and ask her to stop for a sec and try to talk things out.
aDL7xmt6aa	Get a hooker  Vote  Do the Curt Cobain|`|KvyB0E77aa	Get a credit card and go in debt.|`|k2wiYJAcaa	leave the country  go to mexico  drink in canada   lease a car  get your own cell phone plan  get your own house|`|NhC0dHu1aa	Club?|`|6pXT4W0faa	depends on the state you live in.   But in Nevada where I live   you could do all the things you've listed,   and  move out   get a decent job  go out past curfew    hmmmm   can't think of anything else.|`|iM1i07gEaa	Call a hotline!   Buy a snuggie, woo!|`|Mvsh1wqYaa	Go paintballing.  Drink?
AA10776535	No, you need to get someone like me a non denominational person.  Actually we have titles mine says Reverend in front of my name LOL|`|wMWfCjBpaa	I am a practicing Roman Catholic. If you want a Roman Catholic ceremony, most of the time it needs to be done inside the church. The reason is because it's the House of the Lord. He's the one that will marry you and bless the marriage. It's to be done where the church (meaning the people, not the building) gather and worship. Great celebrations are to be done where greats things like this happen, ex. sacraments. Anyways, what my Priest said that some couples do are get married in the church and then renew their vows in a different location right after, like outdoors. You can always ask your Priest or parish for an exception. It never hurts. Could you do an outdoor reception?|`|CaPZrWVWaa	My mother said no, that you need to get married in a church. Greek Orthodox is the same way.     Because of that we are getting a nondenominational person.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Sure, the church is just a building.  The marriage is what's important.|`|ggpf6AZuaa	yes a priest can perfrom the marriage outdoors|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	Ask a priest. He'll be able to explain to you why it is that the "celebrant" is the priest, who is also the celibate.   I have been to a Roman Catholic outdoor wedding, but everything is dependent on the officiant.|`|AA11440601	It depends.    Although the usual practice is for a Catholic marriage to be celebrated is in a parish church, the bishop can give permission for the marriage to be celebrated in another suitable place.    For more information, see the Code of Canon Law, Canon 1118: http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__...    With love in Christ.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Some are saying no, but I (a Catholic RE teacher) am saying you can    BUT    You need special permission, ask the priest.|`|8C1a8uhpaa	when you say catholic, I assume you mean Catholic, as in Roman Catholic, as opposed to catholic, as in one united church of God catholic. (I went to a Catholic school--yes there is a difference, according to Catholics) I believe in order for the marriage to be blessed by a Catholic priest, it has to be in a Catholic Church. They could have two ceremonies though, one with just a few people in a Catholic Church and the other outside, that way their marriage will be still within the rules of their religion. :)|`|F7O0nLK1aa	call your parish and ask, it depends on the priest. if he is old school you may have an issue, but some will do it. congrats!!|`|71qGan9Raa	No! If you do, you have a very hip priest.|`|AA10830892	Usually a Catholic marriage should be performed in a Catholic Church.  This is because the church is a sacred space where sacred functions are performed.  The Catholic belief is that marriage is a Sacrament.  It is one of the seven holy Sacraments of the Church, instituted by Christ himself.    The question should not be so much whether one CAN marry outside of a church, but rather why one would WANT to, knowing that the church is a sacred building reserved for sacred functions.  It is a holy place not because of the stones or bricks that make it up, but because it is there that the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is celebrated, if not daily, at least weekly on Sundays.    I hope this helps you in your quest for an answer.|`|3secB3Smaa	it depends on the priest.
oGoWz511aa	That's what happens to people who don't get to know the people they marry BEFORE they marry them.  I suggest he call the INS.  He's isn't the first story like this they've heard.  They might be able to do something to help him.  Maybe.  If not, I hope learns from this experience.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Well looks like he learned from his mistake. He can't do anything, she played him and he is dumb for falling for this.I know a man who has a divorce on his record because his sudanese wife left him after she got her card. American men need to wise up.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	She used him and moved on. Time for him to chalk it up to experience and move on too.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Have him call the INS and tell them this story. If she has left the home and hasn't made any complaints to the police about abuse, it's pretty obvious she's a card whore. And she can be prosecuted for fraud and deported.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	go home|`|8e172b6b03562dfb30dd48d18dae04baaa	See a divorce lawyer.  Talk to immigration.  I think she has to be living with him for a period of time to keep the green card.   I know she has to file income tax to keep it, and if your friend does not file "married filing jointly" the green card may be canceled.  Check with a lawyer.  Ask this question again and post it in the Immigration section of Y/A.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	sounds alot like our  precious american girls.  only here the girl gets alimony, paliamony. the house, car kids, he got off lucky!!|`|vOUDHws3aa	Live and learn. It's sad but there are a lot of people out there who are willing to marry (and screw with peoples hearts/minds) for only their own gain.  This girl used him and moved on and has no use for him anymore. There is nothing he can do about it now but to learn from his mistake.
zhsTxqGxaa	This used to happen to me but they moved.  If you have their number, just call them and say you are disturbing the peace and we're trying to sleep.  Say it calmly and firm.  If they still are loud or throwing loud parties, call the police.|`|ANKJdJgxaa	If its an apartment complex, complain to the superintendent, or call the police, or just tell them to shut up already (or if they could just keep it down a little after a certain time).  Or....., You could just move.  either way you gotta do something.    Or I could send over my cousin Jimmy, he'll get 'em quiet for you.

pG7OYpvbaa	I read this question cause I thought, "let's see what's happening, maybe I can help." But honestly. Wow. It's life. And it has it downs, and ups. If you have enough time to think about the 'world' after you die. How about you think of how to live it.|`|nm3f8HVRaa	Aw! sad, don't do anything suicidal! That's selfish :) No though, half of being pretty or smart is your attitude, no joke. If you believe you are pretty, or if you try to be smart, really try, not just kind of try, then you will become so. It's all about honest effort and believing in yourself. K, i know that sounds dorky, but it's the truth of it. Just try it. I guarantee that it'll be better than suicide or just giving up on life. Plus, YOUR parents are overprotective? My parents TRACK me. ya, it sucks. I do nothing with my life either, just.... you don't have to be an optomist, just try to find the best in your life and in yourself!|`|zMYYow55aa	come ONnn! you just gotta think positive! your parents are overprotective because they LOVE you! Talk to your parents and tell them that you want to hang with your friends. everyone in this world is beautiful :). No matter what. curvy, tall, short, skinny, big boobed, one boob bigger than the other, too many pimples, ect. We are all the same! everyone has imperfections. maybe to make you feel better, ask your mom for a new hair cut! try somthing new! cut some bangs! get yourr hair cut short! have fun with the way you look! enjoy what you have! find a new crush. he is a jerk to like someone else. and stay positive. be stubborn. be nice, but get what you want. study hard, and before you know it, you will be in college free from your parents and able to have your own life!|`|dFQ5Xbj2aa	no no no no no no no no no no no no no and NO. think of the positive things. look on the bright side of things. you're looking at all the negative things, try the opposite.|`|gSRuZoZVaa	ive been through that too infact i asked a question on here saying i wish i was dead (i deleted it)i think i was just saying that and didn't mean it and hope that's true for u.   im much better now i met a really nice guy that liked me for (but i moved states)    im not the smartest or that prettiest  but i know i can still be happy and im sure you can too. if you think about it it i know u know someone uglier than you.  So just be happy ok hun?|`|SmnWSJxIaa	I want you to know that sometimes what you think looks good to you on the outside really isn't good for you. I use to think that I wish I could go certain places. But understand that beauty is not what you see but what's within. Maybe tha guy you like isn't who God has for you. I've seen young ladies who like guys and they wind up with the friend. But guess what?? God saved the "outcast" from the young man because the popular friend got pregnant and the "outcast friend God blessed her life in the long run. Right now God may be preparing you for all the permanent things he has in your life. See, it might not be meant for you to have him as a boyfriend because when you're old enough God is going to bless you with a guy who has 10 times the qualities that you think he has. So right now write down some great things about yourself, goals you want to accomplish, and work on your inner self. God created you for a purpose. And every morning wake up and say I am fearfully and wonderfully madeLook in the mirror and say that, and anytime you're feeling down say that to yourself.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	You know me to well.  IDK either.|`|V780bRMRaa	Watch, when you get older you're going to be drop dead gorgeous, have the guy of your dreams (and everyone else's for that matter) and have an awesome life. This is just something that you have to go through, but please don't do anything stupid. Things will get better, you just have to wait and see. Good Luck!|`|TlU3zj61aa	NO. Eventually your parents will loosen up. And for right now your just going to have to stick to dating in school. You don't have to worry about being smart or talented. The right guy for you will love you and think you are amazing and beautiful no matter what.|`|ng7KNpOOaa	omg don't say that!     Have a talk with your parents and let them know that your old enough to go out by yourself. Or maybe you can go with them with your friends to like the bowling alley or something so you can hang out with your friends with them there but not to close.     There plenty of fishes out in the sea so don't worry about that one guy. And it doesn't matter if you never been to a movie theatre lol and I bet you so do have talent :)|`|eSI9c4Ncaa	That's just not true. I certainetly wouldn't be any happier, in fact I would be quite sad. So don't even think about it or you'll have to have my mental health on you concience.|`|CBdKPtUYaa	NOOOOO! I've been there! I have. Don't do it! You may think that but people will miss you. I've never been on a date, or kissed a boy. I've never done any of that. I don't make good grades, my brother is the star in my family. I so understand. Just got to wait, people will miss you. I swear. They will. Just please don't do it! You can get pass this! I did! Look my friend use to hurt herself and wanted to die and a few months later she is saying "I love you" to a guy! Things will get better. Trust me, please. I've been there.|`|ztfkMcK8aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...  TALK TO SOMEONE A FRIEND OR A COUNSELOR THE WORLD NEEDS YOU.|`|1AFDw5KDaa	?!?? dont think like that hunnyy..    im sure that ur beautiful in ur own wayy..everyone is.    ")|`|vCTMZKrgaa	NO!

oGoWz511aa	Every country has its own rules on foreign marriages.  I'm not sure it would be illegal.  I'm 99.44% sure it's a bad idea.  I don't think ANYONE should marry someone they haven't spent extensive time with.  As in, at least a couple of years.  I've encountered several people who've entered marriages like this.    Can't think of a single one that's worked out.  What I did notice was each of those people was desperate to find someone to hook up with.  So desperate, they completely ignored common sense, and anyone who tried to give them any.|`|zDeFibxzaa	make sure he is real and legit,there are many love scams from western africa and the uk.if so i suppose they can get married anywhere they want.   look up dating scams nigeria on google!!|`|AA12130542	it is legal (assuming they have a government recognized ceremony), but the ramifications can be pretty stiff. if they have a child, and she decides to leave, she is going to have an extraordinarily tough time taking him out of the country with her. depending on the country, the us may be required to send the child back until custody is sorted out, or she may not be able to leave with the child at all. in certain countries where muslim law is predominant, even if they are not married in a muslim custom, the laws dictate that she will have no rights with her children. she may not even be permitted divorce.  not knowing what country this man is from, i cant say specifically what the laws are. worst case scenario, she will have no rights over children, no possessions, no property no job. she may have to share her husband with other wives. she may not legally be allowed to leave without her husbands permission. she may have no recourse for abuse, or rape. she may be forcibly  circumcised. she may have her passport taken.  far more likely is that she will live in a level of poverty she has never before thought possible. she may have to constantly choose between food and rent. she may not have access to regular health care, much less access to surgeons or specialists. she will be living in a place with a truly frightening number of HIV infected people, none of whom have access to medication. she will see children starve before her eyes. she will see women and children beaten and raped, and watch everyone just accept that this is how life is. she will witness murders, either through tribal warfare, genocide, or within the bounds of the law. she may not have access to books or stores.  or she may be extraordinarily lucky and live in a place that is modern and progressive.  parts of africa are the most beautiful places in the world. parts are a literal hell on earth. the regions of africa are as diverse as the regions of europe. some so poverty stricken that people are dying faster than they can repopulate. some are cultured and beautiful and a paradise. its not that it wont be worth it, but personally, i would be a lot more sure about what my life would be like before i made that kind of commitment.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Legal adult can get married anywhere they please.|`|JKuTvdfeaa	is this person an adult, ..?? over the age of 25, (i say 25, as thats a better age to get married, at least they have a clue what love is)...if shes an adult, then its really her business, why would you talk her out of it? Meeting on the internet, has nothing to do with it, thats no big deal anymore, there are just as many losers in some night club as there are on the web, so thats no big deal, but if this is some kid, some 18 or 19 yr old kid, then perhaps you could SUGGEST, she spend time with him first, i'm sure she cant be that stupid to marry someone shes never been with "in person", ...(though i do know adults whom have met and married soon after meeting, and they're fine), again, this isnt really your business, so just offer support, and guidance and suggestions, IF this girl is old enough to begin with, and yes, its legal.|`|ksqPjgEUaa	Insist someone talk some sense into her.   The Internet???? Really, is she that desperate????  If she marries him, he can become a citizen, which is probably what he wants.|`|t5EE6WO8aa	well obviously the straight up approach didn't work with her so if your really care about her and want to make sure she's safe as much as you can, if this is something she really wants, all you can do now is support her and be her shoulder to lean on and the friend to call if she needs someone to talk to. at least if you remain being her confidant, then you will always know where she is and what she's doing. if you become too judgemental about the situation, she'll just block you out completely, which one would you rather have?|`|XL5sB7PKaa	she can get married if she wants to, its her choice, but you can't come back the united states if they get married in africa. They wouldn't be legally married, plus she hasn't seen this guy before, what if he's a rapist, she doesn't want to go through the rest of her life depressed and scared because she got raped.
52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	To the best of my understanding there are no laws concerning this issue.|`|fRYQfvNaaa	From what I know, brothers and sisters are NEVER aloud to share a room.  It may sound crazy but theres obvious reasoning behind it.
lWOZwV5Laa	I feel your pain.  I am going though a bad break up as well.  I loved this guy a lot but in the end he turned out to be a liar, a cheat and a fake.  Its never easy letting go of someone.  Sometimes it feels like life couldn't possibly go on but then the sun rises, the world is still turning.  What you have to remember is what he REALLY is.  You deserve a man who loves you enough to NEVER even raise his hand to you.  This guy was not the one as hard as that may seem to believe right now.  Your heart is broken.  Suround yourself with friends and family and lots of love.  I wish the best for you.|`|lHCZUPm2aa	Just keep thinkin about that black eye, honey. The only real way to get over someone normally is to just keep yourself busy. Spend more time with friends and family, take up some more hobbies, or volunteer. Hell, volunteer at a battered womens' shelter and be so thankful you got out when you did.

QeohvfRRaa	If she says she doesn't want to have anything to do with her ex, believe her.  I had a hard time ending conversation with an ex a year ago, and though there nothing was between us any longer, the guy I dated after him made me stop talking to him.  Though it was the right thing for me to do, I think I should have realized it on my own.    Tell her how you feel when she talks to her ex and don't tell her what to do.  You don't want her feeling like you're making decisions for her.  Give her some faith.  When you trust someone, they're more likely to trust you, and less likely to break your trust.|`|iUYTvsPEaa	Forcing her not to talk to him isn't right, but she should respect you enough to not talk to him if you asked. If it's really over, she would really just be friends with him instead of confusing you. I think a few more conversations with her are required, but if she still isn't getting the picture, drop her.|`|ICeP717gaa	You need to learn how to relax. I can understand that you may feel jealous, and it surely may be awkward to know that she used to be intimate with this guy, who is now her friend. Truth though is, there aren't any rules to relationships, he must have offered her more than just intimacy if she still speaks to him. Be happy for her that she has friends.     It's good though that you didn't keep this all bottled up and told her what you thought of the situation -I'm hoping you spoke about her about this guy in a sweet tone..  Maybe she made a big deal out of it because she felt like she needed to protect and defend her friendship with this guy when you began arguing with her--- maybe she thought YOU were being offensive.    It's not good to be controlling, or give your girlfriend the impression like you own her. She's a separate person, she's had a past and will have a future.. whomever she decides to still be friends with is her choice.     It's not an offensive act, she's not trying to hurt your feelings. You walked into her life and so there are some things you both will need to tolerate from each other's lives.    By being a tolerant person you'll just draw her more to you.      Hope this all helps!|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	You over stepped yourself.  You have NO right to tell her who to be friends w/ and who not to be.  (also it goes the other way around...she also doesn't have the right to tell you who to be friends w/.)
ab0969c637900508350d036d0578f045aa	Try to understand where she's coming from first and you might be able to connect with her better.    Like you've mentioned, your parents are divorced so maybe your mother is strict on you because she doesn't want you to get hurt the way she did.    But that aside, you ARE 16. You're enough of an adult to handle your responsibilities. So you can start by letting her understand just that. Be more responsible around the house. In fact, ask her for more responsibilities. When she gives it to you, let her know that she needs to give you two sides of the draw.    Let her know that if you're old enough to handle those responsibilities she gave you, then you're old enough to have appropriate fun others your age have.    Never butt heads with her though. From my personal experience, that always back-fire. Don't keep keeping her in the dark as well. Trust me, at some point, she WILL find out. And then she'll see you as even more of a child than before.|`|2lt9fgBlaa	(: Maybe you can have your bf pick you up at your dad's place??|`|gvbK8VHgaa	kill your mother. since your parents are divorced your father will be the prime suspect and at age 16 with your mom dead and dad in prison for life you will be able to apply to live on your own and do as you please with your bf|`|nm3f8HVRaa	I'm guessing you're in highschool. So do you do any sports or anything? hang around after school w/ him and make up excuses for why you have to be there.

I know from experience, trust me.|`|uU88Dkh6aa	Well, I think (though I know its not a popular idea and I'm gonna get chewed out for this) you should talk to your mom about it CALMLY and really tell her why you want to spend time and try to assure her that's all you want to do. If she says no maybe you should listen to your mom and respect her decision for a while. I know, not the answer you want but its what should happen.  Best of luck.

It just didnt work out, sucks too she was really hot. =/      Funny thing is her parents were divorced too but she was already 16 so i guess she's just a little too unfortunate.|`|uHCIxJmqaa	i was 16 once and my parents wasnt divorced but i had my first love at that age! honestly best thing you can do is listen to what your parents say, if he truly wants to be with you and loves you he can wait for you and ur mom to come around. other then that theres always the phone - letters - email.   sorry might not help much but sometimes its hard dealing with parents at that age, they just dont understand sometimes.|`|NvCcdszsaa	Well if you truly like the guy, and hes decent. confront ur mom and ask why she dont like him, if its a good reason, try and reason wiht her. but  like ?? my mom is super strict and im 16 and my boyfrined is 19, he sleeps over everynight in my bed. If my mom tried to say no i cant have my bf over, i would have moved out by now. that is RIDICULOUS. She needs to let you go lol. i think u should live wit ur dad.|`|KTj9g2mGaa	first off, talk to your mom about the whole strictness, without yelling. just openly telling her.  then, have group dates, without a third wheel kinda thing (that drives me crazy)

AA11607503	First off the bleeding will stop and as of now since you had sex so recently the burning and sensitivity during peeing could just be from that, but you didn't use a condom (which you should not do again) and could be an STD.  If it does not stop in a few days I would talk to a doctor.  The Morning after pill is a good idea.  If you are underage go to planned parenthood to get one.  If you are of age you can get one at the pharmacy counter.  Coming back to the condom issue.  I know people that are allergic to latex, use lambskin condoms because they are latex free and get birth control as a back up.  As for the freaking out, that is normal too... talk to him or other friends about what is freaking you out most to find people that can help you calm down.  Hope that this helps you out.|`|OiUiEMr0aa	other guy said it was normal about the burn but there is also an STD that you get which makes it so that when you pee it burns every single time ...so i guess only time can tell...or a test...well best of luck to you, btw they sell a type of condom made from ssomeething else not latex...so i think that guy was just being a dick...well good luck....|`|pCYyzYklaa	wow all i can do is hope you dont get pregnant cuz already you cann see that your stupid enough to have sex unprotected...so being a mom would be hard for some1 like you|`|bRoSGSxLaa	allergic?  ahahahaha....|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	Allergic LMAO.   You'd better freak. And get a pregnancy and STD test while you're at it. This little burn from your hymen being broken is normal, but herpes isn't.|`|AA12290249	there are different types of condoms, he could've found one that he wasn't allergic to.    but yeah it probably is. i wouldn't worry to much about it unless it doesn't stop, then i'd see a doctor.|`|AA11830517	bet you feel special huh..... stupid thing you just did.|`|HNOBUB5Naa	three words.  morning after pill.  that was rly stupid, allergic? hahaha  be happy youre bleeding now because it will be last last time for 9 months.|`|qbS7d8RHaa	well someones certinaly going to get pregnet ..    get yourself on birth control!!|`|a85CukoUaa	W0W most of the ppl who answered r juss *** holes n.e way its normal to bleed when you pee maybe for a few days it will go away its not an allergy unless you swell up or the burning persists
i3PGjRRfaa	He has changed because he now has a wife that is trying to change him and nags him alot................|`|hIe7qLN5aa	i'd get the hell out of this marraige...trust me things will probably get worse    remember your family is what matters most....what if something happened to your dad 1 year from now...u would regret the times you missed with him..or just the phone calls you missed with him    Any person who puts you against your family isn't worth it    get out now !!!!!!!|`|AN9PdKmgaa	he is a mentally ill control freak and you should get out why you can it is not natural to live like that espically when you were so social before. Sounds like he wants to own you and that is not acceptable. Keeping you from family is especially bad. Get out quick while you can he sounds like he could become more abusive I mean not just mentally but physically, Good luck|`|s1LfdCdsaa	May I suggest this? Take a pad of paper and draw a line down the middle, top to bottom. On the left side, write things that would make you happy, like being near family, having friends, speaking in your native language. On the right side, write down all that is making you unhappy.    Once you see it in writing, you will know the course to take. Ask yourself:    Are you happier here in the USA or would you be happier returning to India?    Are there family members that you can live by now, if you leave him?    If you do leave him, is he the violent type who will hurt you?    If there is the slightest chance that he would hurt you, I suggest you make all of your arrangements without telling him, and return to India without telling him. Let him divorce you in your absence.    Do NOT have kids with this man. He is not behaving like a husband should and would not make a good father.    I keep thinking about a young woman in my home state. She too was from India, and she too moved here with her husband. First to California where he was being violent towards her. She came across the country to New Jersey and lived with her cousin. The husband showed up at church and started arguing with her. A young man tried to come to her aid, as did her cousin. The husband shot all three of them. The young woman and the man were killed. The cousin is still in a coma and may never recover. I do not want this to happen to you. He sounds very controlling, and no medicine will work for that.    I hope this has helped.|`|FBKg7oyQaa	Never let anyone control you. You need the love of your family and should see them as often as possible. Friends are important too. Think about divorce long before you jump. You need to be strong. Spend time with your friends and family and let him know that if he loves you, he will want you to be happy.|`|GHd84xipaa	well your country has different cultures then this country has.if you live in this country you are pretty much free to do what you want to do.in some countries the man has a lot of control over their women and the women are made to obey them.the women are made to have low self esteen .that's why a lot of women come here so they can have their freedom.since you are married to a man of your same ethics and culture you will probably have to do what he asks of you.if i were you i were you and you want to be happy i would move on and start another life.i hope you are a citizen of this country now,that would help you a lot and make somethings easier for you.i hope you have some good friends that can give you good advice.if not you will need to see a lawyer.good luck to you and GOD BLESS.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Wow! You come to America for a better life and freedom but you are a prisoner in your own home and relationship. First, I would see if he were willing to go for counseling. If not, then I would leave him. Your parents are your family. Once they are gone you cannot bring them back. And you will have wished for time with them again that you will never have.  Sounds like he is a control freak.   If he does not change, then leave him. Life is too short to be miserable and controlled.

okh3hL8taa	If your father is financially supporting you in any way when you are 18 he CAN come and get you.  If you want to move out when you are 18 then you'd better have a job that you can support yourself with.  If your father pays any part of your rent, or your bills, buys you groceries he can have the court send you back home until you are able to support yourself on your own.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	If you mean-- You move out of his house and on your own and he can come and force you to move back-NO- unless the courts have deemed you incapable of thinking for yourself (ie: mentally ill or mental retardation -something like that.)  He can't force you to do anything and you can have him arrested if he tries.      Now if you mean that when you turn 18 your dad can come and get you from where your living as a child and move you to where ever- yes he can do that because your 18 and a legal adult and it will be your decision.|`|urfVAfHAaa	Yes at the age of 18 u can do what u want unless the court says diffent|`|WkdW04cNaa	Why do you want to leave?  He must not think you are thinking responsibly.  Dad's usually care about their daughters and want them to be safe.  I would bet he is worried for you and is angry about something.  Maybe you could talk it out.|`|e6MaU7nvaa	Absolutely not, because when you are 18 you are legal for everything ,and everyone, except for alchool. He can try, but he may not succeed.
WkdW04cNaa	How about all of your initials :)|`|Bngsrgpgaa	You could have "forever yours" engraved in it?
WoRnK6L0aa	Girl he just doesn't want to wear it. How the hell is metal supposed to break? it's not glass.|`|AA10460376	A ring is only a symbolism of the vows that you made together....The true test of love is within the persons heart, not through the ring that he wears.......Who does he really have to prove anything to by wearing the ring?......AND, why do you put so much emphasis on the ring itself?......You should do some RE-ASSESSING on your true feelings toward this man....TRUE LOVE IS embedded in the hearts of two people who made vows together and the ring does not need to stand as proof but the proof is in your commitment to one another....NOT IN THE RING........|`|wzqahEqiaa	I just did a search on the Internet and a tungsten carbide band can be purchased for $50.00.  I wouldn't worry about wearing the ring everyday.  I've spent more than $50.00 on sterling silver jewelry and I don't worry about losing it.<br>  <br>  I've never been married but I wear a band on my left hand ring finger.  My ring has religious significance and it's a reminder of my commitment to purity.  When I get married I plan on putting a wedding band next to the ring I currently wear.<br>  <br>  I don't think tungsten carbide can be sized.  You may want to get him a smaller size if it's to loose.  It's funny that he's afraid of losing the ring because of smoking.  It's the first time I've heard someone say smoking is a reason not to wear jewelry.  Wearing a ring is about symbolism.  You could buy an inexpensive silver band and replace it when it's worn out.<br>  <br>  My dad works with heavy equipment and he doesn't wear rings because if the ring got caught on something he may lose his finger.  My dad will wear rings outside of work.  My parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years.|`|z6d6k1Ltaa	Could be either. My brother got his wedding ring caught in mechanical equipment years ago at work & hasn't worn his since, but I've never known him to have interest in anyone except his wife. The real question is, does he have other behavior that is suspicious - if so, yes you may have reason to worry, but if not, he probably is telling you the truth.|`|gYRfWcleaa	That sounds like a bunch of Lame excuses. <br>  If he won't wear his ring then I certainly wouldn't wear mine. <br>  I wouldn't trust a man who wouldn't wear his wedding ring. <br>  If he worked in construction or something I would understand him not wearing it to work but worrying that he might flick it out the window while smoking seems a little suspicious to me.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	He doesn't want to wear his ring.  BTW, his first excuse is as lame as his second.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	He just doesn't want to wear it. Scared he will break it?

You tell him how you feel ,and how upset you are ,and see how he reacts.|`|cyt7oh97aa	I know some happily married men who don't wear a ring.  They all have a great reason, all different reasons, and I don't think my future husband will wear a ring either, at least not an engagement ring.  I'd sit down and ask him what's up, specifically why and if it has anything to do with the relationship.|`|6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	The only excuse I had for not wearing my ring was because it gets cold out ( I work outdoors) and it hurts my finger (busted up some time ago). I would carry it in my pocket. While grabbing for my keys, I lost it. A very nice platinum ring! I got another and the cold be damned. It hasn't left my finger for 16 yrs. now! He's just making up excuses...ask him why?|`|1YdeUn1Caa	You got a real winner there. He's not wearing it, because he doesn't want to scare other women away. He's cheating on you. Mark my words. What lame excuses.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	HE DOESN'T WEAR HIS SO HE SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOU NOT WEARING YOURS. RIGHT? RIGHT. Give him a taste of his own medicine. See how he feels!

I have worn mine for over 21 years (entire marriage) even when it was probably a better idea to not wear it because of real danger of things like electrocution and once almost got finger tore of getting caught on piece of equipment. But do now people that don't wear when it is a safety hazard like the two cases I listed and still wore mine.|`|Ie9s1Z8kaa	those are two of the most lame excuses ive ever heard, i smoke n cut down trees all day and my 1.600$ ring is fine, the only time i make an excuse to take it off is when my hands will get wet or i get a callas below my ring-  seriousy he dosent want ta wear it!! mabey somebodys lookin at it-women always notice a ring  believe me!|`|gTfNdFAzaa	my husband doesn't wear his ring either. he does keep it with him though. i don't think you need to wear a ring to show your love for the person your married to. a ring is just a symbol of your love, its a circle of trust. so just trust him and his reason not wanting to wear it.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	hmmmm, tell him to stop bullcraping you and be honest for once. His excuses are lame. Tell him that you decided not to wear your ring, because you are scared your rings will go down the drain if you wash dishes. Im sorry your husband is being a dork|`|sNTizChDaa	all lame *** excuses. sounds like he doesnt want anyone to know that hes married. i mean there are places that will fix it if he "breaks" it|`|M6uIbKXRaa	he doesnt want anyone to know that hes taken he wants to keep his options open|`|2ggfJCQbaa	that is no excuses to wear is ring|`|8ebYteQsaa	Men only get the signal when you act, they don't listen to words. <br>  <br>  Take your ring off and pledge it itches you, or you read in the web that wearing rings can obstruct the proper flow of blood, of you just took it off to wash the dishes or manicure at a friends house and you left it over there... try to look pretty cool about it, nothing to do with him not wearing the ring (it shouldn't look like a take back).  Then wear a beautiful dress, go out with your girlfriends to have a drink and do not wear the ring "because you are going to dance a lot and you don't want to loose it". He'll loose his head and think every man will be sticking to you because you're not wearing a ring.  Then you have to say something like "don't worry baby, you never wear a ring and you have told me it is because you don't want to lose it, and I trust you" <br>  If he really cares for you, I guarantee he won't sleep that night. <br>  <br>  Maintain this alternative (casual) therapy until from his mouth you hear "let's always wear the ring", and then you'll have to agree.  Try to be cool, any emotional behavior will make you loose control of the situation. <br>  <br>  I guarantee it works...     <br>  Men think they are so simple but actually they are very complicated... good luck!
SovaFpN8aa	He just wants to see you, the effort on your part is great, but don't expect him to notice your hairstyle or nails, He will be able to sweep you up in his arms, and hold you, and that is what he really wants.|`|1TXJDiedaa	Awww Congrats! He already thinks that you are hot so you are doing all of this just to make yourself even hotter~ He will be so happy either way but be ready for him to jump your bones every chance he gets!|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	be prepare and be ready make yourself super special|`|FzFSzilmaa	you have WAY too much time on your hands...|`|BLaEQfdDaa	believe me he will be so happy to see either way, just knowing that you love him and your there is the greatest gift you can give him, all the other stuff is extra, Iam sure he will love that to!!!|`|QIQNzE11aa	It depends on where he's been. If he's been involved in combat of any form, he'll want you to look like yourself and more natural. It's funny how that normally does that to a soldier, but they want normalcy as much as possible after the horrendous times they have gone through. <br>  <br>  He's been dreaming of you just the way you look, not all the extra stuff. Spruce up just a little but keep it as near normal as possible at the same time.|`|S0XPrJ2laa	im sure he ll be excited no matter what
zxQT3Uo5aa	There is a clash between culture values here.  The real conflict is being manifested physiologically in breaking out, losing hair, inability to concentrate, sick to stomach.  You have passed you ability to tolerate the conflict and is now on you way to mental illness.  So, present your parents with a different scenario.  A mental ill child or a healthy one.  It has gotten that serious.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	"Mom, Dad, you were so lucky that your arranged marriage worked out so well.  We, as a family, have had a very fortunate and prosperous life.  I know my getting an education and a medical degree has been a wish of yours, as well as mine.  I hope I can make it through the many years of study that it requires.  To do this I need your emotional and financial support.  Your constant questioning about my social life and your ridicule of my study habits is seriously undermining my confidence and ability to concentrate.  Can we come to an agreement regarding my future and my ability to plan for it?"

That was also a great idea that u had paid for your own lunch because if u didnt then u dont want him to think it is a date or anything. Just wade it out and see what happens next.
I40iBJdHaa	did he say you're not good on top, or do you think that? either way, practice practice practice! try bouncing up and down, try leaning over him and grinding, try leaning back with your hands behind you and moving yourself up and down. guys seem to like that last one, since they are very visual. in that position they can see themselves sliding in and out. also, you could try the reverse cowgirl, where you're facing his feet, which gives him a great view too. ask him if it feels good. if your legs get tired easily, have him sit on a chair and ride him that way, so that your feet on the floor.<br>  i hope i helped! just keep trying!|`|xIlIbZJtaa	LOL I hope you got to read that!|`|cwXfF3SNaa	Put on a cowboy hat, red cowboy boots, and save a horse.
QtTvjLS4aa	Well i don't think you should go back to him, you said he hurt you in the past, and you don't know for sure that he won't do the same to you again. Also you both have just gotten out of unsuccessful relationships and yes it seems as the easiest and best thing to do right now for you two to get back together, but it's not the right thing to do. He has broken up with his girlfriend and he is hoping to get back in your life because it's the easiest thing to do as you two were together before and he knows that you are currently separated. You may see it is a good thing but it's not, you yourself have just broken up from a relationship and right now you must be feeling a bit vulnerable right now and like him you know that you two were together in the past, so you see it as the right thing. But i think your mind is clouded by you heart right now, you are thinking about your failed relationships and you don't know what's the best thing to do right now. I suggest you stop and take some time and think long and hard about what you should do right now and what you want in life and if you feel that the right thing to do is go with your ex atleast you took some time to think about it and you will know that you made the right decision. Hope i helped.|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	get ova it its a year ago.=']|`|X6C6kZKKaa	you need to take some time off from boys. get a real man. and no it is not worth it.|`|Zjb4p1TRaa	I always say if you can see things TOO clearly, like you can feel them happening, it won't happen.<br>  It means you get your hopes up, to get your hopes up, your hopes have to be crushed.<br>  It sounds harsh, I know. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't take him back.<br>  You've moved on.<br>  Don't go back to your past, it obviously ended for a reason.|`|YWoVltTWaa	it depends on what your ex did to you and how he approaches you. Take it from me it is really hard to change someone or for someone to change.<br>  but if your willing to take that risk go for it!!!!|`|FfFkyHSIaa	you still love him... go 4 it!|`|bszyOuIqaa	I think you already know that it won't work more than likely.  Sometimes you grow accustom to being in relationships that don't work. You don't want to get caught in the pattern of needing to be in hell to feel normal.  If the change isn't obvious then there is no point in going back. It takes more than someone saying they changed.  For guys it takes them dating other girls and going through some trying times for them to really grow up. If nothing life altering has happened to him then he probably hasn't grown any and you and him are just wasting time.|`|kII0dTwQaa	omg! I am a model I want to marry a good man.

Uj5kuzoJaa	I think that it sounds like a great idea. though I wouldn't put her hand in front of her face, I would just be smooth and wait for her to notice. Another idea is to find a really cool viewpoint along the drive and give it to her while you guys are looking at a beautiful view. The car is a little corny lol. But I like the idea that you want to give her the ring at the beginning of the trip because that will make the whole trip more memorable. The pictures will mean more to her. Also if you ask her at a beautiful spot, then you'll always have a picture of the place you asked her. Very romantic *sigh* lol|`|Sjf112pKaa	Promise rings are stupid.|`|F4EZ7YERaa	forget the slippin it on her finger while drivin down the road.. i think you should tell her what your promising and why (all that sweet crap) and then bring out the ring as a token of those promises or whatever. im sure yall will get married eventually but be clear that you arent poppin the question. <br>  and have her favorite snacks and what nots in the car for the trip. girls like when you notice little things like what they like.|`|4Hkqeoy6aa	That sounds really cute! just make sure you dont mess  and the ring falls on the floor or something cuz that would TOTALLY kill the romantic part of it.|`|FkJobxmGaa	sounds good but change the b&b to camping under the stars on the coastline(if you are near any beaches)|`|IxOP4qbYaa	Yes, she'll be fascinated...<br>  She seems like she's a lucky girl.|`|AA11753560	i dont think you should do that corny slipping on the ring while your in the car. you should wait till your at the resturant and tell her how u feel and then but it on her nd tell her all the things u promise to do 4 her. also by her some cute little gifts =]|`|9iuwkis7aa	aww sounds really cute...but be careful as she may think your proposing lol
Uj5kuzoJaa	You need to let him know how serious this is for you. If he continues to do this, you might leave him. Maybe it's time to tell him that. I'm not usually one for threatening to leave a spouse as punishment, but if you have tried talking to him and he won't listen maybe it's time to let him know this is serious. Have you tried making friends with the daughter? This is a really difficult situation and I feel for you here. Maybe try keeping a journal of when this kind of thing happens. Don't be accusatory or anything, try to be objective. Just state the facts of what happened. Then write how it made you feel. When you have a couple of situations you can actually show him, give him the notebook and tell him that he needs to read through it. You can stay or you can leave while he reads them, though it would probably be best if you were there so he could talk to you after. If he reacts badly, then maybe it's time to re-think your relationship. You don't need to be with someone who acts so childish.|`|AA11312653	Tell you husband you understand the need for quality Daddy-Daughter time and you don't want to intrude. Ask him what the plans are for Daughter's visit, and whether each part of his plans is for Whole Family or for Daddy-Daughter. And have a Plan B prepared. <br>  If it's D-D time, you and the boys go do something on your own. Explore getting a membership at your local zoo or science museum, activities at your library, and so on so that this is quality time for you and your boys too. If it's supposed to be WF time and Hubby is slipping into D-D mode, just suggest gently "The boys and I were thinking about going for a walk. Would you mind?" This will alert him that he needs to come down on one side of the fence or the other, either recognize that he needs D-D time or he needs to behave in WF mode. <br>  <br>  If it "seems lately like he's resenting me for whatever reasons" then I'd get very very interested in his life just now. Not always, but sometimes when everything a wife does seems to just irritate the bejabbers out of guy it is because he is thinking of leaving her and feels conflicted and angry about it. Whether the problem is wanting out of the marriage, stress at work, health, or whatever, a husband and wife need to know what is going on and be supportive of each other, not snarl and growl and drive the spouse away.|`|6Ge7kcgqaa	I just had a bog blowup with my stepson who has tried his best to divide our family ever since me and his mom got together.

She is not a good girlfriend for cheating.  You are very obsessive for going to such lengths to tempt her into cheating.  In the end, clearly neither of you are ready for a relationship.  Just break up.  She needs to grow up and you need to get your head examined and build up a minimum level of confidence.|`|kbkbDhwLaa	Yes, what you did was wrong.

Good luck with that.|`|ee98025b513c047ed69a68224b1fb014aa	Yes, what you are doing is really f*cked up.<br>  Long distance relationship? sounds more like an online relationship.<br>  You're the one with the issues, you should have just asked her.

But i guess it was for a reason. You obviously didn't trust her from the beginning if you feel like you had to do this. I don't think you should continue to be with her b/c she is obviously unfaithful. Are you sure she doesn't know that it's really you doing it?? I would get suspicious....hmm. Bottom line is if you feel like you have to make a fake web page you shouldn't be with them to begin with ya know? Anyway good luck <3|`|LXJCQ3SAaa	long distance relationships Always end bad. she is cheating on you but it is wrong for you to do this but it is not cheating just to chat with other guys online. you can ask her about it but you will be incriminating yourself and she will probably break up with you|`|uNSFCryiaa	what you did was wrong. i dont no if its cheating or not but if you rally are so insucure about your relationship, maybe a long distance relationship isn't best for you.|`|WiQNbmHFaa	sounds ridic. ulous.|`|Y38ZGHUDaa	confront him and break up with him.. dont tell him you made a fake page thats creepy.|`|Cgrd1CWoaa	that is so wrong you should be ashamed of yourself i'd leave you if i found out|`|xcFEHHYvaa	does your brain stop woking when your fingers hit the keys or are you always this retarded?|`|sX3xxLAIaa	i have no idea...|`|f2q8KoBuaa	As i see it no it is not cheating however it does lead to cheating.

If you start doing this to this girl, then you'll do it to every other girl you're with. She is not cheating, unless she makes an attempt to meet with them for a sexual encounter.<br>  <br>  You need to stop, step back and trust her. If she ever gives you any reason that she isn't faithful, then you can talk to her about it.|`|b79281394f26d2628c17365fc5559ae3aa	I think yes it is considered cheating but at the same time you set her up for this.

You are just gonna get yourself in massive trouble over this whole thing.|`|gSwobfujaa	its pretty much building up to be cheating. shes obviously playing games. leave her.|`|b7246aa9c54ecf3cf12beff32046d863aa	if you are worrying then there IS  a problem. please talk to your gf about your relationship, whether she is happy, what she expects , how she feels about you and you should make sure her that you are totally loyal and committed to her, tell her beautiful things, use webcam, send small gifts, and see if she STILL looks for another guy. <br>  girls are more committed than men but they need more care and more communication. <br>  please just effort a little more before you freak out. if she behaves suspicious after your efforts and still looks for another guy around her, then just move on with your class and dignity. <br>  <br>  i had a long distance relationship (he lives another country) so I truly understand your worries but try to be patient and make MORE effort in order to provide a commited healthy relaitonship with her. <br>  you can email me if you feel bad, i will try to help you to improve your relaitonship with her as much as my experience allows.
QMAqzpKEaa	Well what do you personally want to do Charlie? Do you see yourself with the other woman on a long-term basis or is all the stress making you think less rationally?<br>  I honestly do not know because I do not know you, your wife or the woman you are having an affair with.<br>  Studies have shown that in 2009 an increasing number of us will have affairs.

But an affair can provide nothing more than a distraction, instant gratification.

I always thought we had a happy marriage until I found out about the affairs.  I think it hurt worse knowing that he was keeping this all from me than if he would have been up front and told me he was unhappy and needed out.<br>  <br>  Do right by your wife, by your girlfriend and by yourself - be honest, stop the charade and move on with your life.  Not everyone that marries is compatible, but sometimes we don't find out until it's too late.  Now is the time to step up and be a man.|`|NENgQYdRaa	Okay I am going to say this the nicest way I can. You need to break it off with your wife or end the affair. You may have a better connection with that woman now but down the road that connection will become just as watered down as the one you have with your wife (most likely anyway). You can however, regain the connection with your wife if you put in effort. And if you don't want to put in the effort then break it off with your wife before she finds out about the affair because that will probably hurt more than you leaving if that is the inevitability anyway.|`|gSwobfujaa	i feel so so very sorry for your wife. i cant offer you anything more than you should truly be ashamed and disgusted with yourself. you vowed to be loyal to her and you couldnt even do that. you are the mere reason i am terrified of getting married. its repulsive.<br>  <br>  i hope you see this additional response. i am not pathetic for "casting judgement". u put urself out there to be judged. do u really think there is any good excuse for u to be cheating on ur wife? there isnt. and although i personally may not be the most perfect human being i have never cheated in my life and i never will. if i become unhappy in my marriage i will divorce the man before cheating. i will give him that much respect and have some morals and dignity for myself. u call us pathetic for feeling sorry for your wife. at least someone does. i would say between u and i...its a hands down on who is pathetic. seriously. u r simply trying to make urself feel better for the disgusting things u r doing.|`|AA11328507	Oh woe is you...such a poor loser!

It sounds weird, but treat it like a science experiment. Try seeing how avoid things changes your stress levels, and happiness. But I would say for the sake of the relationship you do have with your wife, to give her the upper hand. Talk to the new girl, if she knows your married, which I would guess she does, and talk to her about your stress. If she "loves" you, she will understand. And if you find yourself missing her, and more stresses, maybe you should talk to your wife, and say you need some time. If she really wants everything to work out, she will understand also, but I would suggest not mentioning the new woman to her. In the end, what ever scenario makes you the happiest, follow that path.

The consequences of your actions can be devastating...You can ask many others who have been in this situation.  If you do value your marriage at all, I would make an attempt at counseling--so, if you want to continue to pursue this, you will know that you did not try to address the issues in your marriage.  There are simply no easy answers here.  Eventually, as you get to know this woman, you will have a new set of problems to deal with.  The fact of the matter is that the grass is never always greener.  So, I would seek counseling for yourself and in your marriage.  You need wisdom and need to exercise great caution....Good luck.|`|7X82RNuiaa	I think the main problem here is the fact that you think there is an excuse for your actions. You are not the only person in the world affected by these types of problems (pretty much everyone is!). There are other outlets to the stress you are  going through, which I think you should consider exploring, such as counseling, therapy, that type of thing. As far as the affair, you are married!! You made commitments to your wife, and you should have kept them. We all make mistakes, but in order for it to be a mistake you have to learn from it. End it with the other woman immediately. Can you honestly say that you have a better connection with her when the relationship is obviously purely sexual? If you feel that you have absolutely no way out, then maybe you should consider divorcing, but its not fair to anyone to continue both relationships at the same time.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Let me get this straight. You are a married man having an affair? You justify it by saying you married too young? You want my advice on how to ease the stress this is all causing? Oh, you poor thing you.|`|VhmBMJKxaa	I think that the reason it seems that you and the other woman have a better connection is probably because you are not married to her. The relatioship is still new. I think that the excitement of the affair blinded you to what is really important. If you were feeling dissatisfied in your marriage, you probably should have talked to your wife about it, instead of cheating on her.<br>  <br>  I am not trying to make you feel guilty, we all have our choices in life, I am just trying to help. <br>  <br>  I think that you need to get rid of one of the items of stress in your life, and since there's really nothing that you can do about the jobs and economy, this is the thing to fix. <br>  <br>  What, do you think, would make you most happy? Being with your mistress or your wife? Bear in mind what you like about each of these women. If your favorite thing about the mistress is the sex and excitement, then you need to set your priorities, as plainly sexual relationships never last. Do you still love your wife? Probably not, or you would not have dishonored her in this way.<br>  <br>  I cannot tell you what to do, who to pick, anyway. But just think about it. This current situation cannot go on. You are hurting the women and yourself. My advice would be to come clean with both women, (because whoever you pick, you want to begin the new life with honesty). <br>  <br>  I'll be truthful, they may both leave you, but if you could do this to the woman that you love, the woman you commited yourself to. Then you might deserve it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|dr32Mtxdaa	THEN STOP HAVING AN AFFIAR <br>  U DUMBAS S!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Do your wife a favor and divorce her.

I am not saying it in a judgmental way, because I am in no position to judge you as I am in almost exactly the same situation. I have come to the conclusion that the only way I can regain my sanity is by attempting to simplify my life. In this case, the first step is to end the affair. Then, once that is settled, maybe see what I can do to lower the intensity of my work schedule.

Divorce is scary but you gotta deal with things before they deal with you.|`|GuKofUzSaa	Either get a divorce. or end your affair. That will take away a lot of stress right there.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	It is interesting when I hear these stories. I bet you felt the same way about your wife a month after you started dating her too. It's something new, and that is why you feel that you have a better connection with her. Give it some time and you will probably feel the same way about her as you do your wife. I hate cheating, but I also realize we are human beings and that is that. You owe it to your wife to stop or to tell her. Put yourself in her shoes. How would you feel?|`|y1hH8UtQaa	affairs are no good sort out your problems with your wife or leave her, dont cheat its not fair on her at all|`|0JB4eb6raa	Geez this is a tough situation. How long have you known this new woman? Because you know all is so great in the beginning. How long have you been married and are their children involved? I think that when you stated the stress your under and possible breaking down. You owe it to yourself to take care of you during these tough times and so I would look at the stress factors and eliminate, decrease any levels of stress that I did have control over. <br>  1. intense work schedule?<br>  2. an affair?<br>  3. financial woes?|`|abrIJMYpaa	Hopefully your wife is having sex with someone else too. I bet she's stressed out. Poor thing.|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	"due to the stress of the relationships, the stress from an intense work schedule, and financial stress (thanks to the economy..).... I'm getting to the point that I feel like I'm breaking down."<br>  <br>  I think you should take comfort in the fact that the Wheel of Karma seems to be working just fine in your case, i.e. you behaved badly and now you are suffering for it.  <br>  <br>  That's what we call "justice".|`|ED4nlW4raa	You get what you deserve.|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Try to work things out with your wife. Obviously you know the reasons why you are cheating, so you know what issues you have t work on. If you still love your wife then you owe it to her to try and work things out before you make false declarations of love with some other woman. Marrying to young and this point makes no difference if you vowed to stay together.|`|AA12227599	I think it's called guilt. Be a man and make a choice. Your wife deserves better.|`|AA10420452	you really need to fess up and get the guilt off your shoulders.affair is just wrong.how would you like to find out she has been unfaithful.i have been married 26+ years to the same woman.and we still have great sex now we do have to work at it so it stays spicy for us .communication is the key to a success-full marriage|`|01kEoI0Oaa	you should dump her|`|MvcX75q9aa	well i think u should probably go with who u love|`|ZEitfScGaa	You only feel this strong connection because it is new to you. Im sure that you still love your wife, stress comes into any relationship but you deal with it. Not this way though. <br>  What you are feeling now is just lust. I recomend you end this relationship with your mistress now.|`|Nk876YgJaa	Charlie, I hate you.|`|K0cdQbH0aa	Ya think you're stressed now? HA!! Just wait till your wifey catches you being a DOG and boots your filthy butt out, takes the kids, the cars, the house, pets etc then your new fling decides she doesn't want the burden of a homeless brokea*ss unfaithful loser and ALSO kicks ur a$s to the curb!! Remember KARMA baby it'll get ya every time :-)|`|4QHanq1Laa	Do you have any kids with your wife?<br>  If you want to limit stress I would get rid of the women you are cheating on with your wife. Ic you stay with her things could get very messy and that would add so much stress onto you.. Also this woman might only be using you for sex.. <br>  <br>  Where as you know your wife supports you, she loves you for who you are.. are you willing to give that up for a few good sack sessions? You could always talk to your wife and try to spice thigns up. I wouldnt just give up without trying..<br>  <br>  Furthermore, I will be suprised if anyone trys to help you considering you are a cheater. But I feel bad for your wife. I hope you grow up a little bit and give your head a shake. The world doesnt revolve around your needs, you have to think about your family first.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Stop having an affair and that will cut out 1/3 of your stress. If you want to explore your relationship with her further, get a divorce first. The guilt is going to eat you up from the inside and you will break down if you keep it up!|`|8KB1LL3xaa	Affairs can be an emotional roller coaster for all involved, instead of having an affair have you explored the idea of including your spouse in the adventure? It would be an option that you may all enjoy and it may help resolve the issue you are having with your marriage. <br>  <br>  Bottom line you know the reasons you find someone else to be involved with and those are personal. I do not ask you to share them. What you need to ask is do you love and want to stay with your wife or do you want the adventure of this new person. Remember the new person may only seem better now because she is forbidden fruit. Will she hold the test of time. It is unlikely you will be accepted back if she doesn't work out. <br>  <br>  Talk to your wife and see if there are things missing by both parties. Maybe you will be surprise that you can have your cake and eat it to.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	You and this other woman are 'connecting' better because you are ONLY having sex. You don't go home to her (or she to you) to face all your bills, irritation about work, etc. <br>  <br>  If you are already stressed, this may have you headed for a nervous breakdown because you can't maintain a lie like this forever. You are gonna slip up, get caught and be sorrier than you are now.<br>  <br>  Break it off ASAP. Your connections -mental and physical- should be with your wife. If you are having problems, TALK and get counseling, if necessary. Don't blame or criticize because you can't throw stones. You have done something that could land you in divorce court.<br>  <br>  If you can, get transferred to another project, but you have to cease all ties and communication with this woman. Do you really want to leave your wife? If so, then man up and do it. Just don't be a liar because nobody wants one of those.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|KjJFgBEIaa	What I think may of happened here is the relationship with your wife was at a boiling point because of what you said, money, work, and the relationship it-self. I also think the affair happened because of your unhappiness and stress level and the reason because you may feel like there is sparks is maybe because it's something new if you know what I mean. What I think you need to do is talk to your wife about how you feel your relationship is going and how stressed out you are and have her commit in telling you now she feels. Ask each other if your going to be able to do all this be happy and if your not then you both should maybe start moving on and if you happen to think there is hope for you two then let go of the "other woman" and have the both of you really try to work it out. I hope this helped you maybe a little and good luck.|`|fKuvMPCiaa	Either get a divorce or leave the other woman. You'll be less stressed and your wife can go find someone who actually appreciates her.|`|Ql6qFk85aa	Of course you're stressed.  You should go talk to a therapist who might be able to help you through this.  Talking about what you're going through to a real person, especially one who isn't there to judge you, can do wonders for beginning to relieve the stress of your secret. <br>  Bottom line is you shouldn't be cheating, but you know that.  Regardless of how strong your feelings are, you should have had enough respect for your wife to make up your mind and end it with her before pursuing the new relationship.  You should think about it carefully though. You've only been with this other woman for a short time and you're probably still in the honeymoon phase.  It might help to really examine what it might be like in the long term to be in a normal, public relationship with this woman.  If you don't feel there's actually a real love between you, think twice about ruining your marriage.<br>  I'm sorry if this was blunt, but it seemed as though you were looking for an honest answer.  Good luck.|`|KtmbnW4Naa	stop having an affair thats the lowest form of being a ******* douche bag the world has ever seen, dont be a pussy at least divorce your wife but dont be a sneaky little *** hole behind her back|`|ad2f9df6e51923e9b041c490b085104eaa	YOu know, I'll bet this other woman seems so great because she isn't washing your dirty drawers, picking up after you and being stressed from putting up with your bulls#!t. Honestly...men... what the f^*k are thinking? You stop respecting your wives because you finally beat them down to become the perfect little clone of a 50s housewife, where you are the only thing on their agenda, and they lose themselves in the pursuit of making you happy. And BAM.....suddenly they are not spontaneous enough, not interesting anymore, and they let themselves go, ALL FOR YOU!!! Do you really think your wife doesn't think about cheating on your work obssessed @ss? UMMM, yeah, she is. Hopefully she is. :)|`|fb7587a927e5d6cde99b1661549ba969aa	I understand what you are saying - but I think it's important to keep in mind that you are probably only seeing the very best side of the other woman - and probably only showing her the very best of you.  All relationships are fantastic at the beginning!  Also, with all the stress you are under now is probably not a good time to make any major changes or decisions.  When things get hard I think it's  natural for us to 'run', or seek out things that are totally different as an escape.  We think things are better elsewhere.  That said, only you know what is right for you in your heart.  I wonder if, since you say you feel like you are breaking down, you should take a break from the other woman just to see if eliminating that new stress doesn't give you some relief?  Adultry hurts everyone involved - it almost always ends up as a lose-lose situation.  It's very stressful indeed!|`|AJTOP5jzaa	dude cheating is one thing but if u let her join in well damn u jsut have urself a little party going on. but this is the real world tell her what u did and then have some good old fashion hate sex|`|S1vu0IWDaa	I would say you either need to end with your wife or the other woman. You are not going to be able to carry on the affair forever. Eventually the other woman is going to want more, assuming that she knows that she is the other woman. <br>  You need to be fair to them and make a decision. You shouldn't string them both on like this.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	You'll find sympathy between 5h1t and syphilis in the dictionary.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	OK, you know already what you're doing is wrong on every level, so we'll go past that to why you feel this stressed. That is your conscience and also the lies you are living in, it is bound to get you down sooner or later and this is a warning for you mentally and physically to stop this affair NOW and focus on your marriage. This is nothing but a fling, it is temporary and you would not want to lose a good wife over a cheap affair with some woman who cares nothing for the sanctity of marriage and only wants to scratch an itch. Were you to choose her over your wife, she would end up cheating on you...so subconsciously you are aware of all this and that is why you are feeling so stressed, it is very stressful living with lies. When you stop the affair and all communication with this person your stress will go away too.
gAflmxDRaa	tell her that and if she still trys to push it too far, stay with your bf as much as possible
YbwDFvEaaa	Your parents may be concerned precisely because they have been in a similar situation. They're probably well aware of the trials and tribulations, and rather than see the wonderful family they raised as a result, they just see you dealing with the troublesome parts, and no parent likes to see their child in any sort of trouble.<br>  <br>  However, you should remind them that you are a mother now yourself, and whether they're ready to admit it to themselves or not you are an adult and are fully capable of making your own decisions that you feel are best for your family. Whether they agree with your decisions or not are a moot point. As your parents they should be offering you support.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on the baby!|`|TJezsCkHaa	keep doing what you are doing.You are on the right path.As for your parents,explain for them for the last time how you feel about you step-daughter and tell them that you fell she is like your own and you won't give up on her.If they accept it,that's good,if not,you don't need them if they are going to be a part of ruining your life.God bless you|`|xkVeB14naa	Its your life and your decision, but more than likely because they dont like your decision they are going to try and blame it on someone else because its better than blaming it on you.|`|9BsyKN9haa	Your parents are sticking their nose where they don't belong! I just hope they NEVER say any of that garbage in front of your children!  You need to really let them know they need to step off!|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Since you have already told them how it is i would tell them to butt out!|`|cEakVShMaa	u need to tell your parents that he had nothing to do with you dropping out for the semester. and tell them that you feel like his daughter is your own. and there is nothing wrong with raising your step daughter. tell them that you want to raise a family and you promise to go back in the next semester. and it your life.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Your mother has some experience with what she is talking about.  It may not represent you situation to you but it close enough.<br>  <br>  You can not say if you did not have the responsibility for the care of his daugther that the out-come would have been any different but I can say that part of his value for you is the care of his daughter.  That is what you parents are trying to get you to see.  Your circumstances may reveal some things as you declining health will continue to render you unable to provide the care that you have been giving<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know if you made them aware of the serious of the health situation because on their own they should be able tod raw the same conclusion.<br>  <br>  That tells me that they are basing their position on more than what you have shared here.  It seems that your concern would be your health, not trying to make them see anything which tells me your are not being completely honest in your representation of this.  What is the real motive here?
0Vpm9vHDaa	First, how...big is she? if shes really big, he could be worried about her health, but i do agree that it was kind of a harsh way to tell her...if shes not really big, then, no offense intended, but he's a jerk and i cant believe a husband of 13 years would do that... just try to be a venting tool for her, maybe go exercise with her to give her support
SfGyzMSFaa	My husband and I have each been away from home for weeks at a time (for work) throughout our entire marriage. These trips have lasted from a week to 3 months. We've been married 28 years and are still going strong. When I was growing up, my dad periodically traveled for work too; a few weeks at a time was common; but he also worked overseas for nearly two years with only one break to come home for 10 days. My parents are also still married, 50 years now. Military families deal with long separations too. <br>  <br>  I won't tell you that it is easy; it isn't always. But with the ways we have to stay in touch now it's far easier than when my dad worked overseas. <br>  <br>  You and your husband need to have some very open and honest discussions about whether to make this change, and if so, how you will work out the details. It will help if you can come up with some idea for a goal; how long will you two commit to living apart, and why. It is possible to flirt long distance, it is possible to keep your relationship strong; but it can be lonely. I find myself missing the daily contact with my husband when one of us is 'on the road'. For me, the trick is to consider each other partners, part of a strong team, and be willing to renegotiate things periodically. We figure that we can handle just about anything if we work things out together.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	It will be fine. With todays technology you can still see him daily with webcams and Instant messaging. My husband is in the army and he is gone for months at a time so it could be worse. When he is gone jsut put pillows in the bed so you feel like he is there.|`|gj6rpPjYaa	You want someone to give you good reasons why you should stay behind; in your heart, you know you should go with him. Marriage is an adventure, dear, there should be no break in transmission. Leave no room for problems to creep in.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do...Even if that means uprooting yourself to be with your husband.  Good luck!|`|59964d53fa7967029226eb0cf3c34609aa	If your relationship is strong, that means you trust each other.  Right now, people all over are making decisions like this that would never have considered even a few months ago, because of the economy.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, the situation will only be temporary.  But if he's going to be going back and forth, it's not all bad.  Absence does make the heart grow fonder. hehe.<br>  <br>  If the benefits of the new job aren't outweighed by the cost of his travel, I think you two should be OK.<br>  <br>  Go for it.|`|DjLFiZEwaa	He is your husband.A husband and a wife need to be together,under one roof.The two of you need to decide together what would be best for your family.Either he stay with his present job even though it may be unstable and you continue with your job or he take the new position and you move with him and find a new job.One thousand miles is too much distance a part.He may come home on weekends but after a while it will probably be less and less.Even tough you say your marriage is strong it will not stay strong if you are apart.There is no way I would live separate from my husband.Spending a few days a month together is not a marriage.If you want your marriage to stay strong you and your husband must be together.It may not be what you really want but you have to decide what is more important in your life.IMO your marriage should be first on your list.|`|NENgQYdRaa	This is actually a very up and coming trend. If your relationship is strong and it is something that you must do in order to maintain the things you value then I say go for it. Especially if he can come back to be with you frequently. I read about this trend in Microtrends by Mark Penn, the good news is that it is usually only for about 4 years typically and about 50% of married couples are doing this now. In the mean time you could try looking for a job similar to the one you have closer to his job and maybe you will find one if not know that it is temporary and that this maybe a real opportunity for you both to grow in your marriage. To love and devote yourselves to each other without necessarily being close to each other. I couldn't do it with my husband because we have issues of trust, and things but if you guys are in a really strong place and have confidence in maintaining that despite the difference I would weigh what it means carefully and what you are both willing to do for each other.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	all of these options are totally do-able..  and whatever desision you make is the right one for you guys.you do need to weigh the pros and cons of each option.  1. he doesn't take the job, you struggle financially, but you get to keep the job you love.  2. he leaves you go with him.  he gets the job he wants and you sacrifice yours.  you have to start over at the bottom of the totem pole, and have to work your way up again.  3. he goes you stay.  you each inveset in a web cam, and good long distance phone plans.  you see each other every so often when he gets home.  yes it's lonely and yes it's hard but hundreds of couples do it all the time.  my husband was overseas for 8 months. and we made it through just fine.  think of it this way. many couples are seperated for months with not seeing each other.  and they aren't sure whether or not they will ever see them alive again.  so really this is no biggie.   whatever you do choose to do. know that noone can tell you that it's the wrong choice.  work at it, and you will be fine. absence does make the heart grow fonder, and you will be surprised how much you are capable of on your own.|`|kRvc9Nyjaa	i had the same problem, i live in NY and my husband got a great opportunity but in california, but he was going to come back and forth, but because our relationship is very strong, (we have been together for 6 years and never been away from each other), he didnt go, he said if we are going to struggle, we are going to struggle together not apart.<br>  and thats what weve been doing, good luck|`|0CX9a9wyaa	Just like any marriage it takes work and understanding with one another to make it work....remember anything is possible. And at least you know he will be coming home to c u . And what ever job anyone may have is very important to hold on to. We r in hard times right now.<br>  so working together is very important. it will work out.... just b patient......  good luck and best wishes.....|`|KZlgdMeEaa	I would relocate with my spouse, yes the economy is bad but being apart only leaves you both lonely which leaves room for troubles in your marriage. Try renting your house out for a while til u decide your ready to let go.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	You're his wife move with him. Relocate. That is what I would do. I wouldn't even question it.|`|6yEcTwofaa	The same thing happened to me a year ago! But I was a manager with the company i worked for since i was out of high school- 7 years. You got to do whats best for the family! I don't know if you have kids. But now that we relocated we are in a better position to raise our child the way we were not. And i get to stay at home with him for once before he is off to kindergarten in the fall. My husband was in the marines thank god he never got deployed over seas, but now with his job he travels over seas for a couple weeks here and there march he is going to Kuwait!. I think it makes our marriage stronger on that part. But i think if he is going to be working there for good  you should move with him. If you dont want to sell your home, or you dont think you are able to sell it with the economy, put it up for rent- but i would go through a real estate agent that way they back ground check and everything and they don't destroy it. <br>  <br>  Remember to decide with your heart whats best!! <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  Also i would do what the other person said.. try it out and see if it will work that way, if it doesnt move!|`|F2pY6Dfiaa	hey the way economy is right now and the stable nature of ur job it would be good if you stay back and keep earning something<br>  <br>  also you mentioned yours is a strong love then why are you worried have faith also you have emails orkut and cell phone so you can anytime get in contact with him also if you are earning you are playing safe becuse in case he finds his new job difficult he can always think of comin back... <br>  also the additnal info u provided is also favoring you <br>  <br>  but finally if you that attached to him follow ur love, nothings more good than being with ur love but also be very pratical in what u decide<br>  <br>  hope it helps.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Many couples are having to do the same thing, when you look at it as temporary it will be easier, however, if it turns into a permanent situation you might try finding a comparable job where he is and move.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I would try it for a 6 month period and then see how it works. Maybe you can arrange to at least spend every weekend or every other weekend together. And depending on the job, perhaps he can arrange it so he can work from home sometimes.<br>  <br>  If it is too difficult after 6 months then you need to decide where you need to live. <br>  <br>  But people do it all the time. Just think of all the people whose spouses are in the military and gone for up to a year at a time. Or another friend who is a management consultant in Texas, but is working in North Carolina on a project for 4 months, and was on a job in Tokyo last year for 6 months. If there is trust and you communicate daily, it takes work but it can survive.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	You're stressing yourself out about this, but you don't have to.  Yes, the economy is in bad shape *right now*.  However, this is a market correction, and it's not going to last forever.  I suspect by this time next year, things will be almost back to normal and perking along just fine.  So, think of this separation as temporary.  Later, when the economy is good, you can join him or he can come back to you.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Maybe you should try a long distance relationship until the economy improves. Obama is working on it. Then whoever can best find a job should move.|`|AA10065812	???<br>  Make sure both of you have a good Internet connection with web cams and wireless mics.  I would recommend a Unibrain.<br>  <a href="http://www.unibrain.com/Products/VisionImg/Fire_i_DC.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unibrain.com/Products/VisionI...</a><br>  <br>  This is a Firewire, high speed, and high resolution camera that can be daisy chained.  This means you can connect up to four along the same cable line.  You can set up cameras at different locations in each place, and with the wireless mics, talk and see each other as you move around.|`|Yh63ysrzaa	Wow, that is a tough one.  But I would have to say, if it were my husband, no matter how much I love my job, I would relocate with him.<br>  <br>  Something to consider - money is just that - money.  It comes and goes.  It can only buy material things.  Your marriage, on the other hand, is sacred.  Money can't buy that, it can't buy happiness.  Maybe it means you have to tighten your belts a little bit or curb your spending, lose the house you love for something new/smaller.  But in the long run - isn't it worth it to be with the one you chose to love and cherish for life?<br>  <br>  Life is too short to be apart for too long.  Why deprive yourselves of your relationship, of your love, if you have an option?  Even if it isn't a "great" option, it's still an option.  Relocate, honey, you'll be glad you did!  No matter how strong your marriage is!<br>  <br>  Good luck, blessed be!
LaFklYyzaa	carefull with the dirt and grass stains. if you can find a nice "runway" to lay down stuck to the ground so your train won't bunch up or carry dirt up to the alter then go ahead!! congrats :D|`|jLg8Mh1kaa	If you want a train then have one or you will regret it afterward.  There are a couple of things I would suggest. First, there is a loop on the inside of trains so that you can pick it up and carry it when you walk around outside before the ceremony so it doesn't get dirty.  When you are ready for the ceremony, your maid or honor can spread your train out so everyone can see it during the ceremony and then you can have pictures taken with it as they do.  Then, you can have someone put buttons on the dress (someone who alters wedding gowns) so you can pull it up into a bustle in the back so it does not drag when you are walking around during the reception. I think these things may solve your problem so that you can still have the dress you want. Good Luck.  I hope you have the perfect day for your wedding.|`|iuSrMdwmaa	A train can look beautiful, but it can also cause numbers of problems. Only you can decide if you can live with a less than pristine dress not just at the end of the day but possible almost from the get-go. <br>  <br>  Problems include not only stains on the dress, some of which may show in the photos (think of rising damp!) but drag. When you're walking across a completely flat surface indoors your train will slide over the floor easily. Outdoors it may well drag, meaning that as you're walking along you're pulling the dress behind you, which can alter the look of the dress in the front as well as in the back.<br>  <br>  Here are some tips to avoid or minimies problems when wearing a dress with a train for an outdoor wedding:<br>  <br>  1. use a carpet or an existing path for the aisle<br>  <br>  2. make sure the area you will be standing on for the ceremony is clean - a paved area is preferable<br>  <br>  3. have someone hold your train up until you get to the carpet/path and then let it go so you can sweep down the aisle.<br>  <br>  4. talk to your dressmaker or bridal shop about sewing an extra band of material on the underside of the hem<br>  <br>  5. Have the front of your dress shortened so that it sits on the top of your shoes, not on the floor - If you're walking on grass (even with a carpet laid down) you will sink a little with each step, maybe only 1/2 an inch but it will be enough to make the front of your dress too long, so you'll struggle as you walk and you'll be likely to get damp stains/grass stains all round the hem rather than just the train.<br>  <br>  6. Avoid walking on pea-gravel paths - the stones will not only tear up the underside of the train, little stones can make their way into the hem as well which will ruin the drape of the train.|`|ss3ZU4KCaa	If the area where your wedding is will be manicured and flat then yeah, you should be okay. Mine was in a field so there were dried brush and leaves and stalks so i was very happy i took a dress without a long train. If you do decide to have a train and the area you are having it is relatively rough, i would definitely suggest putting down a cloth aisle for you to walk on.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	You can have a train and pin it up once you're not walking down the aisle.  Or you can hold it up on the side.  A lot of dresses with long trains bustle in the back and work out so that you can walk around like that.|`|0CX9a9wyaa	If that is what you want then do it..... make your heart content....good luck and many blessings to you both.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I had an outdoor wedding and had a small train on my dress.  Something that helped was that I walked on a concrete walkway and not just grass and dirt.  My dress did get a little dirty, but once we get it cleaned it should be fine I hope.  One of my friends had a rainy wedding day and her dress got very muddy.  I probably would have pinned my train up for that instead of waiting till the reception to pin it up.  If you're not worried about your dress getting dirty then go for it!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	As long as it isn't muddy, go for it! My fmil had a train and it was so muddy everywhere, we had to adjust her train "just so" for the pictures so it wouldn't show the mud!|`|di6p10Ifaa	Just because you are getting married outdoors doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your dreams of your princess gown and go with something that is tea length, simple and just not you. I am having a candle lit garden wedding and I have a taffeta beaded champagne and ivory ball gown. Not a huge train but it definitely has a train. I would stay away from a cathedral train but I think the ball gown is a nice length. Have a seamstress or a dry cleaner scotch guard the underside of the gown so that it cleans up nicely. Chances are yes it will get dirty but who cares you are only wearing it once and if you have it prepared and cleaned properly it should clean up fine. Good luck and go for the gown of your dreams!|`|AA11380378	It will get DIRTY.<br>  <br>  On a wedding that I atteded a couple ofr years ago, the sensless bride wore a dress with a train for an outdoor wedding. By the time she got to the outdoor ceremony site, she looked like she was dragging a pile of dirt on her dress. All you you see was the black and grass stainson the dress. It was really distracting to herr dragging a pound of mud and wearing a dirrty dress. What a shame, she ruined the dress and everyone looked ayt the stains, not the bride<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|4459a617a0f5dd8c54421a39f39f8ed4aa	If you want the beautiful train for walking down whatever aisle you've created and it's not muddy, then go for it. If you are afraid of dragging in through grass and possibly mud then get a bustle for it so it can be buttoned up when you're not walking down the aisle and when you're greeting your guests. <br>  I'm getting my dress bustled so it doesn't drag during the reception, even though mine is indoors. The shop selling you your dress can have it added or any seamstress can do it.|`|1xggHtgXaa	If you don't mind the fact that it will probably get ruined, go ahead. My train got grass stains all on the underside just from taking pictures, and it was a beautiful day. Imagine if it would have rained! But, who cares? Not like I'm gonna wear it again. OR you could just make sure you have it bustled really high so it doesn't drag the ground when you bustle it.
kv8ZFPP1aa	well one she kind of has a reason to be insecure about your relationship [[you are cheating on her]] but i would sit her downa and talk to her about this and if nothing changes then just leave. it's not good for either of you to be in this situation.|`|oojO4WAraa	Since you have a girlfriend on the side - you deserve to be treated this way.  Continue to wallow in your depression.  You have earned it.|`|fNNTPqZLaa	Ha. Don't feel sorry for you, b a s t a r d.<br>  You deserve all of this and worse.<br>  Dumb f  u c k.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	So you're cheating on her and blaming her for being insecure in the relationship?<br>  Leave the one you live with so she can find someone better.<br>  Does the one on the side know you have a gf? If so, you deserve each other.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Cut out the drinking ,It's a depressant. Dump the girl.|`|01kEoI0Oaa	dump her|`|eaO0MRaBaa	The second gf friend obviously likes you. Go with her.|`|GQRs83Haaa	Get rid of the girl... move out if that's what it takes. But you shouldn't have to feel like this. <br>  <br>  Also CHEATING is wrong a**hole!!! haha!|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	Depression? Listen some linkin park songs.<br>  Then just dump her.|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	You'd do yourself a big favor if you first admitted to your own mistakes. The truth will first piss you off, but it will set you free. You say that your girlfriend is stressed all the time because she's insecure about your relationship, but so are you. She has a good reason to be too, because you ARE seeing another woman. I hate to say it so bluntly, but you are in the wrong here.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have a girlfriend on the side. You can't get it up because you're feeling guilty about what you're doing. You know it's wrong, man, because it certainly isn't right. You even said you don't love her, so what do you do then? You should really find out, most importantly, whether she loves you. If she does, then it isn't fair to continue a relationship with her, for her sake. Relationships are a two-way street.<br>  <br>  So now that that's taken care of, we'll talk about good things. Maybe you're stressed, you're feeling guilty, and you need to vent a bit. Talk to someone who knows you well and who cares about you, and get this off your chest. Try to work things out with your current girlfriend, or pick one or the other. It isn't right to cheat. Once you get this figured out, your life will magically remedy itself.|`|Sjf112pKaa	Go alone into nature and seriously contemplate your messed up life. See a Dr and get some pills. Move to another part of town or another town. Don't take your GFs with you and while your at it break up with them. Get a second job to pay the bills and keep you busy. Find a good hobby that helps make you happy and then go back and reevaluate your life and write down what has changed.|`|f4keqWZfaa	you ARE your own worst enemy my friend. You have created the situation you are in and continue to spiral in deeper. and, only you can get yourself out. Here is some pointers but you will need to work your own plan. First be thankful, you arent dieing and no one has a gun to your head, you do have a job, and things arent really all that bad as you "think" they are. It's all of this that is going in your head that is driving you crazy. look 1) stop drinking, period - you clouding your emotions into depresion with it 2) you are feeling a lot of stress and masterbating as a release when you have a gf is crazy- if you need release masterbate with her. 3) start being true to yourself and if you dont like the way you are being treated - stand up for yourself and say so. then do something about it already. 4) move out of that house and find a new place so that you can feel better about yourself. 5) you are in a confusion of circumstances so stop seeing anyone and start investing in yourself.. look for a better job and further your career - do things you like to do and stop with all of the pity party bull s## start finding yourself be a man  and  find out what you want to do with your life and start doing it .. step by step. .make a plan and go for it! no one is really stopping you from living the best life you can live, dog.. get it? go for it!!!|`|fLU63N4kaa	You don't deserve anyone's respect, since you don't respect anyone. Stop being such a dishonest lowlife. Have some balls and be a man for once in your life.|`|pVwyu6Fuaa	Move out of the house, to a house of your own.<br>  Pay your bills.<br>  Cut all ties with BOTH women.<br>  Learn to stand on your own two feet.<br>  Find some great new freinds to talk with and spend time with.<br>  <br>  You are under enormous stress, but you can blame no one but yourself! You are angry with the gf that you dont love, because she feels like you are cheating on her, because you ARE!<br>  <br>  Stop treating the people that love you, like ****.<br>  Good luck and I hope you can figure out how to respect a woman!|`|F2pY6Dfiaa	you yourself have complicated your life, decide with whom you got to stay  and be loyal to that ONE PERSON half of your prob is solved dude,<br>  you cant have 2 gfs at the same time and also a happy life it would be stressing.<br>  <br>  and once you know with whom you are love her to the most and see how life works wonders for you
meacW8jQaa	your one of those people   you wants popularity more than friendship.  why would you care about what other people thinks?  you should stick up for her not thinking she is lame.  do YOU think she's lame? what if people in your school  thought YOU were lame. She is nice enough to hang out with you...|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If your friends make you happy, then who cares what others think.|`|DjCLWseZaa	just stick with her.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	you or your friend shouldnt care what other people think. if you want to be friends with her, thats your business. and if your a true friend, then you'll stick with her and wont ditch her just because she is supposedly 'lame.'|`|o1irBbeNaa	if you care wat other people at your school think about you being friend with her then you have some issues.|`|1dVoVp1gaa	if ur happy with them being ur friends it shouldnt really be bothering u and if u dont like them that much and ditch them and make cooler friends|`|wB8C1Zbkaa	if they're nice to you and you like them, you should hang out with them, but it doesn't seem like you like them because you're actually considering ditching them because some people called them lame.

bO2rzfISaa	Really? You FIGHT about this? That would really motivate me to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should remove yourself from the equation (you aren't helping, anyway) and send him to Weight Watchers or Jenny Craig. Reward him for doing well instead of making his life miserable.<br>  <br>  What you can do is buy no junk food, cook dinner 7 days a week and pack his lunches. Walk with him every day. Encourage him.<br>  <br>  No one responds to negative reinforcement.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	OK, one, stop nagging, stop mentioning it at all, two, cook and prepare fresh fruits vegetables etc and lean meats and proteins, and three, join him in daily walks for 15 minutes to start then work your way up to 30 minutes. get into this habit. But most important of all is you stop any mention of diet to him, that is totally counter productive. Do NOT insist on him taking any pills unless his Doctor has approved them first, but he does not need pills if you will put your money where your mouth is and help him rather than antagonize him.<br>  There is an excellent book called "Eat This Not That" which is 9.99 and you can order from amazon.com, it gives you healthy alternatives in the market and at fast food places.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Start making veggie trays with dip, fruit salads. Make the dinners, but put less on his plate. You can get low fat dreamwhip and low fat pudding and make that for him for desert. Just help him.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	always engaged your husband in sex that s the best exercise|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Well, this is what I suggest.  <br>  1.  Don't say anything to him about his weight.  He already knows what your opinion is and, frankly, there isn't anything you can say to him that he hasn't already thought himself.<br>  <br>  2.  If you don't cook the food or do the grocery shopping.  Start doing so.  If he complains about there being no junk food then tell him that your sorry but you just can't have those sorts of delightful temptations in the house because your trying to lead a healthier life.  Watch your tone when you talk to him about this!  Prepare healthy meals.  Evenly balanced.  Hell even include some not so healthy item on the menu but only serve that in TINY portions.<br>  *example*  Grilled lemon/lime honey chicken (4-6 oz), a TON of steamed broccoli or grilled veggies, and a small helping of cheezy mash potatoes w/ a few bacon bits.  Then a fruity dessert served later.<br>  <br>  3.  Go for evening walks, or other types of exercise and ALWAYS invite him with a smile and a joyful (i love you) tone.  If he declines, go anyway.  When you get back appear happy and refreshed.  Tell him that you missed him (kiss on the cheek) and you would have loved to have had his hand to hold while on your walk.<br>  <br>  Rinse and repeat.  Catch more flys with honey than vinegar.|`|xGshAiXOaa	Losing weight is a personal goal that one must set for themselves.  You can't make him change his eating habits or work out.  All you can do is voice your concerns regarding his health and be encouraging and supportive.  Keep healthier options in the house, start planning more active outings, take walks at night after dinner and ask him to come along.  Good luck to you and to him.|`|f90398951f7adee7e74f9756fac8e803aa	He will loose weight when he is ready, there is nothing you can do, the more u push him the more he will go towards the food, <br>  Just cook healthy and hopefully he will eat it, also u can try going to parks and long walks with him if he wants remmeber that he did not get fat overnight so it takes time.
AA12367392	The first thing is dont blame yourself, yes you may feel you are the reason but you're not, have been through the same thing and at your age, my mum used to cry herself to sleep while he was boozing it up with his new girlfriend (usually a bar maid), mum used to go looking for him thinking he's been in an accident, and last time she found him he was at the latest girlfriends place and he tried to break her arm to make her leave and threw her down the steps, yes, married for 25 years and he cheated on her most of the time, even when my sister was in hospital near death still had his floozy in the car, please dont be sad you will be able to visit him if hes one of the ones who care about their kids, and please dont pick on your mum, shes going through enough as it is, just sit down and talk to each other, you will be surprised at how much this means to you both, especially your mum, godbless and hope it goes away soon!|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Talk to a guidance counselor at school if you do not have a grown up relative to talk to.|`|P5GhUEvoaa	I'm in the same situation as you.I'm 16 years old and my father cheats with another woman and even has a daughter with that bit.h .They all said we cannot do anything about it beause it's their relationship,not our fault. So what I'm doing now is to talk with my best friend and see what is going to happen next :(
MaATw3NNaa	I think I may know her. I always ask "How ya doing?" She took me litterally and vented every single time....I feel your pain.    Is her name Melonie by any chance?|`|4qpA27dTaa	My friends, and even I myself, waste loads of time whenever we can complaining to each other and considering it a topic in a conversation. We call this "venting," and it seems to help us cope with things and prevent us from exploding with emotion later on. What's funny is this: even when I am complaining to my friends, I normally spend another topic in the conversation taking back everything I said!  Whether it's someone, something, or even some place that's on your mind (believe it or not), complaining about a certain aspect of your life can relieve stress from day to day. I know it sounds corny, but when you vent to someone, anyone, it allows your mind to take a rest from the subject and let the pressure off easy.  But, also, yes, when my friends spend any amount of time more than about 10 minutes ranting on about something that bothers them, it literally gives me a headache! That's why I am trying to find ways, other than venting to my pals, to deal with the stress of my life, because I know that it bothers them when I complain, too! You could help your friend out by helping her do the same as well.  So, just let her have her time crying about how much she hates the people leaving mean comments on her MySpace, or yelling about how her parents never let her go anywhere, or even fuming about her science lab partner's stupid mistakes. She's just getting it all out so she can remain bubbly and carefree the next day! So, in a way, you're helping her out! Good job!  If she can't find a way to cope with much of anything and keeps bringing stuff up to you, you could try just preventing her from whining in the first place and changing the subject matter every time she goes too far, so she'll know that you don't want to hear it. If that doesn't work, then she must be having a rough life so far.  In other words, if you would like to help reverse this problem yourself, one of the best things to do is just come out straight with her and tell her that complaining isn't going to get her anywhere (and I know that sounds mean, but, trust me, I've had to say this many times to my friends). Then, just say that you'll help her when she's in a rut of unhappiness, but that she needs to just brush off the little things and cool off by doing fun things instead of complaining every once in a while. Telling a person straight forward and directly can really get them thinking.    I hope this helped, and don't forget to have some vent time, too!|`|kuefQuxiaa	YEAH!!!    My boyfriend! And let me tell you, if this happens ALL THE TIME, so much to where you simply CANNOT have a decent conversation with them, then that's not a good relationship!    Between friends, buds, or anyone.
zzaScg0haa	Why not wait and see if he will perdue you, some guys do better when they do the persuing
rc52fIZQaa	Hi,<br>  I recommend you to go with a jean, a long, nice shirt and on top of the shirt a thick belt! It stays really nice. Try it! And of shoes you can use anything. HAVE FUN!!!<br>  Enjoy<br>  :D|`|AA11755944	casual sounds good.|`|9EiGOJaWaa	Try something in the middle>
3ieqwgWGaa	give in you are being unreasonable if u keep being stubborn he will dump u
AbQCkNHuaa	Well whatever your mad at him for must be big sense your still upset over it. It sounds like he wants to try and fix it but you won't open up to him more. And on top of it, you are ignoring his calls. So now he is aggravated and mad at you! I think you should call him to talk about it and apologize, because you really didn't feel like talking. If he doesn't pick up leave a voice mail saying your sorry and you just weren't in the mood to talk about it. And your willing to set things straight now.|`|20Hpqmuzaa	hahah i do the same but i always let him look for me don't look so despreate and making them think they got u ?? wait for him to contact u|`|xqan4ChSaa	if he doesnt want 2 talk u u should check up on him if hes cheating on u or hes not 4 you|`|bJFJ1l6daa	well if you have troubles opening up then you gotta take it slow to be able to open up. If your boyfriend doesnt understand that and cant understand that, then he is not the guy for you.|`|0imjbygmaa	Stop being so immature. If you can't communicate you shouldn't be in a relationship.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Stop being a baby. People aren't mind readers and ignoring people on purpose is RUDE. How would you like it?|`|bszyOuIqaa	There are things you can do to help your relationship (communication).  Then there are things you can do to hurt your relationship (withdrawl).  What you did wrong was you shut off communication with your boyfriend, all because you didn't want to talk. Maybe you were avoiding an argument but you are sending a message that "It's okay to talk when I want to talk but when you want to talk it's not important."  You should never close the door on communication. Arguing is a normal part of any relationship so you shouldn't try to avoid it.   After most arguing there is at least understanding.  Wouldn't you be upset if there was something you wanted to discuss and your boyfriend refused? Then he ignored your call?<br>  <br>  You do owe him an apology.|`|fw9BDFu2aa	i do not know if this is much help my my wife is the same way will not open up to me  no mater what i say or do . just let him call u do not give in .thats what i did my with my wife if that dont work then call him  and tell him what going on be for u do tell him not to get mad or say any thing that will make u mad that what i think i do not know if it help but i tryed|`|lRnEQbsWaa	Give in(:<br>  Just call him or text him ask wether he is still angry .<br>  & tell him that you really was moody & you need time to tell him .<br>  Tell him that you know actually he care for you alot ..but you wasn't ready to tell him about ur sadness & didn't want to quarrel with him because you really need him with you.

Thats the part you have been given to play so thats what your going to have to do. Just be confident.

AA11312653	For the ceremony:<br>  The honour of the presence of<br>  [write in names]<br>  is requested at the marriage of<br>  Missy Bridenton, daughter of<br>  James and Jessica Bridenton, to<br>  Guy Groomly, son of<br>  Laura Groomly Newman and<br>  Gordon Groomly<br>  on Saturday ... etc etc etc<br>  <br>  Laura and Guy are divorced. Laura has remarried a Mr Newman. Since they (Laura and Gordon) are not a couple, each name gets a seperate line. If parents form a couple, the names can be as above, or both full names can be used on a single line as in "Jessica Bridenton and James Bridenton", or each full name can be on a seperate line.<br>  <br>  If the ceremony is in a secular location rather than in a church, you say "The pleasure of your company" instead of "The honour of your presence." The idea is that only God can invite people to God's House, so you just tell people you'd love to see them there at God's House. <br>  <br>  For the ceremony:<br>  The pleasure of the company of<br>  [write in names] <br>  is requested at a dinner and dance<br>  to celebrate the marriage of <br>  Missy Groomly (formerly Bridenton), daughter of<br>  James and Jessica Bridenton, and<br>  Guy Groomly, son of<br>  Laura Groomly Newman and<br>  Gordon Groomly<br>  on Saturday ... etc etc etc<br>  <br>  Notice that it's "the marriage of Missy TO Guy" in the first and "the marriage of Missy AND Guy" in the second.

AA10378030	I agree you just have to find your comfort zone and friends who accept you as the fun guy like you were at the old school. Just be patient. ?|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Don't let it get you down; since you just changed schools, it will take a while for you to fit in and find your niche. Just give it time and I'm sure people will begin to notice what a fun guy you are. =)
JhvqUvlsaa	Yeah this doesn't concern you so don't let it rile you. =)|`|5A7RmIH6aa	get the hell away. that's jail time. its just a matter of time. and you can be her accomplice.<br>  <br>  that is very easy to track back to investigate. you do not want to be in the middle of that. especially if you are in school,it will ruin your career forever.|`|S1vu0IWDaa	That's a hard one. But in my opinion I wouldn't let it affect your friendship, unless she starts forging things about you or other friends.<br>  But if you really feel so strongly against it, I would say let her know and let her know that if she continues doing it your not sure if you want to stay friends.<br>  ps. You should probably also tell your friend that she could get in a lot of trouble for the stuff she is pulling. Insurance companies are very serious about insurance fraud.|`|wb9BBKzRaa	I guess a mother will do anything for her child. <br>  But here's a question for you: How do you feel about paying taxes to support all those people who abuse welfare, food stamps, section 8? I understand there are people who truly need help, but there are also PLENTY of people who take advantage of the system. <br>  If I were you I'd confront her.|`|VemHKmkmaa	please Ignore what she is doing. I know she is your friend but please ignore her it doesnt concern you.<br>  if she brings it up give your opinion but dont bother her about it. its none of your buisness and not your problem.
b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	It sounds to me like his was very hurt in the past by the break-up with his ex. Although he may have done lots of nice things for her - as you say on Valentine's Day - hes reluctant to do all this again as he feels its just not worth the hassle in case you break up with him. You deserve better than this though. Just because he was in a bad relationship with his ex, does not mean he should neglect the woman hes with now is case things turn bad for him again.|`|PumDOQC9aa	sorry to say but it seems like you are a rebound to him .the way his daughter acts around you and hiting you beating up your daughter is just wrong . I think you should should really talk to him about the whole problems . If he doesn't want to change his ways you should leave him|`|AA11780625	Before you think your the rebound, I think you should ask him to sit at the table wit you, and ask him to be realli honest wit you, about this whole situation, I hope for your sake that you aint the rebound that aint cool of him, or any guy doing. I want you to sit at the table and be like exemple, george i need you to be honest with me, are you with me cuz of ur ex  if so im leaving you, and the mother whose kicked you in the stomach, go up to her and be like if you dont stop, ill call the Popo aka cops, that aint right of her, and tell ur fiance that. He'll talk to her, Anywayz good luck :) and im sorry to hear about your situation, I hate people like that.|`|LjyfQZdwaa	Possibly a rebound.  Expand your thinking, and get out of this mess for your daughters sake, and start over somewhere else with her.  Focus on bonding with your daughter and rebuilding your life.  Consider counseling for what she has already endured and for yourself.  This is not a healthy relationship for you or her.  There is unresolved issues with your fiance and past relationship that should have been addressed long before you even got involved.  Very immature on his part.  He needs to address those issues in a mature manner.  This is not for you to sort out.  Its a very sad thing that innocent children are in the midst of such confusion.  They don't deserve that.  They are carefree and should always be in a happy and nurturing environment.  Just my opinion, hope that helps, thanks for asking.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	he needs an attorney, to fight for his rights and as setts. if he paid for the home why do the in laws have control?|`|satoCRC6aa	Legal help is the answer, don't leave the state|`|bO2rzfISaa	What good would that do? If his in-laws truly own everything, he's not going to get part of it. You should help him get an attorney. Unfortunately, it sounds like he's made some choices that have him backed into the corner. No one should pay for a house if it's not in their name.|`|OHfZFR31aa	She has no rights to 100% of their home and assets if they are legally married. He needs to see a divorce attorney ASAP to protect his assets. If they bought the house after they were married, she is only eligible for half of the value of the home, as well as half or any assets acquired while married (car, furniture, etc). If he came into the marriage with a car, his own furniture, etc he can also take these with him when he leaves. <br>  <br>  And if they are legally married she cannot kick him out of the house without a court order proving he has been abusive towards her.<br>  <br>  He should not leave the state or even his home or she can try to prove abandonment when it comes to the divorce proceedings.  And if he is co-signer of the bank accounts, he is free to take out as much money as he wants.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Find him a good attorney who will explain his rights and how to best proceed.|`|oojO4WAraa	No, power of attorney wouldn't do you any good.  But he needs to get a good lawyer.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Unless hes mentally incapacitated,or out of the country, you couldnt get it for this as he is an adult responsble for his actions. Maybe he has just decided that this would be best for all involved and finally be done with his in laws. Unless he has signed over his half to them, hes leaving as half owner of a house in which they wont be able to do anything with either. He just might have a plan here that he doesnt want to tip his hand to them so it only sounds bad on paper.|`|0CX9a9wyaa	I am not sure how that would work, but if it is possible then go for it. And hell no this family should not have any say in what goes on in his marriage to some gold diggin b****. he paid for it then he needs to fight for it........and i don't think they can make him leave the state... what the hell and who in the hell do they think they f***** are.. i wish you the best of luck and best wishes to you and your son......i hope all works out well......... tell him not to stress so much.....it only makes things worse.....|`|djUMvICoaa	I don't think you can take power of attorney from an adult child unless invalid.  But I'm pretty sure he can give it to you.  What would you do with it anyway?  You were supposed to instill into him how to make good choices growing up not after he's married.|`|fecUjSr1aa	the question is .. Who has a better lawyer? Apparently, the girl's family is financially well off and can certainly get a very good lawyer. A common factor, the rich protects their own. How far do you think you'll go?<br>  <br>  your move ...|`|12a0272242edadf74177f3fc2ca00636aa	its not power of attorney you need its power of gaurdianship one is for the liveing one is for thr dead good luck

Ge8xMTgRaa	I think you two have very different views of life and priorities in life. And there`s nothing wrong with that, as long as you could join both your ideas and middle point some of them. Not everything that you like, he`ll like...not everything that you think, he`ll think...but at least have the same beliefs because that`s what makes a relationship solid and strong, and especially if you`re thinking about getting married. Your views need to be quite the same, and your future plans should agree pleasing you both. However, getting married is not really going to change anything dramaticaly between you two right now...but once you start forming your family, having kids, that`s when the real problems begin if from the beginning you didn`t patch up your differences and tried to accept each other.<br>  I think you guys need to have a long talk. You need to see in him a support for you and vice versa. ...but if what he believes in is not what you`re giving him...something could be wrong. Two people may love each other to death, but ultimately what will keep you together is your beliefs, your common interests and priorities in life, and obviously having a great communication. This is how you`ll grow as a couple. and growing together makes you a strong couple.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If he is 35, you've been together for 6 years, and he still doesn't know if you are the one, I'd hate to say it but give him an ultimatum or move on. He's never going to come around<br>  <br>  Be very honest with him that you have been together so long and really want to get married now. And if he's not into it, then you have to move on with your life and find someone who will want to marry you.|`|eaO0MRaBaa	Sorry couldn't be bothered to read it. Hope i helped

I would get him three boxes with items in them (I did this for my bestfriend once & she loved it!)  In the 3 boxes I put three items.  A nice piece of jewelry -->  which was the real gift; a large pack of gum cause it's one of her favourite things; and the third box contained a piece of paper the promised her that we can go to see a movie (one of her many favourite pass-time activities) but she gets to choose the movie, when & where; and with not excuses I am obligated to meet those desires.  Just me creative way of making her day really about her!  (I I topped it off with 2 balloons, but I would have preferred a cup-cake with one candle in it!
t1VthewCaa	Legally, they are not considered "guardians" if a judge haven't stamped that on paper! Yet, if these people have been there for her and have provided for her over the last year, I think she should take all of that into consideration before just up and leaving without any consultation first. They can't tell her she can't go, but they can call the police and let them know that she has moved out on her own, is under 18, and is living with a "friend" that is of legal age. Especially if this "fiend" is a male and they are sexually involved. I just hope she and this "friend" is careful with their decision!
