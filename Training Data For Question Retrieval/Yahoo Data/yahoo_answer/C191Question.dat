20090307160826AAmFuL1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I need help!!! thanks!?	First of all, This is my younger SISTERS account!!! I am just borrowing it for this question.       Now, well, I was raped, and now I am pregnant. I went to the Doctor and everything. When I told my parents, they said,"We will help you get rid of this thing. Though it is your fault. We are very dissapointed that you let yourself get rapped. We should disown you." meaning they wanted me to get an abortion and are blaming the whole thing on my. (i was at my bff's house while her parents were gone having a sleepover. her parents knew i was going to be their and my parents knew that her parents wern't gonna be home. her bf and a whole bunch of people came and partied. he rapped me. After i left and to the hospital.) I was all for the abortion at first. I have plans in life that don't include a baby. But then i missed all the appointments my parents set up. I want this baby. I talked to my older sister, she is in Med school and her husband is a dr. she said she will help me in every way possible. I approached my parents about keeping the baby. They said." No way in hell!" My little sister was listening and said, "I won't have a crying snot nosed rape conceived baby in my house!" My older sister said I could live with her and keep the baby do online schooling and get a job. btw i am 16. she is 22. her husband is 25.      But should I press charges against the rape? i have a rape kit and know who has done it (my bff's bf) thank you so much!

20090307103519AAckhvI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do you know if you are in preterm labor?	First of all I am 29 weeks pregnant...I have back pain, some pain in my abdomen, I was having contractions yesterday regularly but my cervix was closed according to the doc and they sent me home. They said I have an infection and gave me meds... the contractions started yesterday at 3:46pm and stayed until 6:45 consistently but slowed down after that. I checked my own cervix last night just to see any progress and i could feel the hole but only enough for one finger and i felt soft. I checked again this morning and i didn't feel any difference, however I checked again just now 12:00pm and the hole is larger. I haven't been feeling any contractions since I laid down last night but I know you can dilate and not feel the contractions per say ...       I just wanted to know if any of this sounds like preterm labor....

I have to wait until im 11 weeks to get an ultrasound so I am a little concerned after reading about a blighted ovum.  Do you think I would have miscarried by now or my hormone levels would be off if I had a blighted ovum by this point? I know I'm probably crazy its just my first pregnancy and I'm worried to wait that long to go to the doctors.  I also have cramps from time to time but no bleeding is this normal?

20090225065449AAua73i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How do you feel about this pregnancy test?	 http://www.tellmepinkorblue.com/       They claim that it can tell you what gender your baby is going to be. According to Marie Claire magazine, they don't sell it in certain parts of Asia, because of the tendency of women in those countries to abort baby girls.      I think that this is sick. If you want to know what gender you're having, why not just wait and get a sonogram? What, if the baby isn't the sex you want, you'll abort it? I don't know if I want kids or not, but if I do, I'd like to have a daughter, but if my sonogram says that I'm having a boy, I'd still be happy. This 'test' should be abolished.

My daughter is 17 months and her favourite phrase is 'what is it?' - she wants EVERYTHING explained to her!  I know she is a bit young to understand perfectly, but how did you explain to your children about meat coming from animals without it sounding really cruel?

20090227083742AAziNIU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What is the magic age?	What is the magic age that makes someone a murderer and no longer a child? 6 years old? 8 years old? 11 years old? or 18 years old?       In a 1893 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that "children under the age of 7 years could not be guilty of felony, or punished for any capital offense, for within that age the child is conclusively presumed incapable of committing a crime.      But a child over age 10 can be tried as an adult.      9 years ago, Derick Owens at age 6 shot and killed a little girl in his kindergarten class. He was seen as a poor little child and not a killer.      Now we have an 11 yr old murderer who is being called a horrible person.      Where do we draw the line and still see these children for what they are? They are children still and not adults.      At what magic age do you draw that line? In the past ten years quite a few murders have been commited by children under 14 years old.

I'm 28 weeks now and I guess about a month ago, my mom asked if anyone was throwing me a shower and said "Well, I guess I should throw you one"...but that is the last I heard.  I had one with my 1st girl, but that was almost 10 years ago, which my aunt who is very close to me threw for me..my mom lived out of state at the time.  My mom is kind of absent minded and I wonder if she'll forget and I don't think my aunt will want to step on her toes by doing it...you know?  I'm starting to wonder if anyone will do it at all and it's kind of hurting my feelings.  I guess I'm wondering if I should bring it up....but I think that would kind of be rude to ask for your own shower, what do you think?

20090225063411AAVhd3v	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should I worry about my baby?	My little baby who's nearly 7 months was diagnosed with a heart murmur at birth.  She's been seen twice by the Paediatrician and the murmur is still there, so he wants her to see the Cardiologist.        He told me that he is fairly certain it is an 'innocent murmur' but because it hasn't gone it warrants further investigation.  She today had an ECG and although the ECG itself showed a few problems and the outcome was 'probably abnormal ECG' the doctor said it "looked normal, but lets wait and see the scan results"      I'm even more worried now than before, and these tests were supposed to reassure me!  I realise that a doctor can't tell me things look normal if they don't, but I'm just so worried about her.  She doesn't have any signs of heart problems, ie, blue tinge to lips or not thriving, she seems perfectly normal, happy and healthy, but I'm so frightened.      Please offer some help - particularly if you've been in this situation yourself.  Thanks.

20090225034948AAgc0fg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	15 weeks pregnant, 17 with limited income?	Currently I am 17 and 15 weeks pregnant. I live with my parents, but we don't have any extra bedrooms here so I can only stay here until the baby is 3-6 months old. I am about to graduate high school in a few months and I am planning on working part time at an office job by going to an agency. I also plan on going to city college right after high school, university, and then law school and eventually becoming a lawyer. My boyfriend currently makes about $2,000 a month. So we have a very small amount of money. My plan is for us to live at my house for 3-6 months, and then once I turn 18 the baby will be about 3 months old, and I can go to a job agency and get a part time job; that way, we can move into a 2 bedroom apartment. The rent here in California for a 2 bedroom apartment is about $900-$1,000. I honestly was not expecting this and I wanted to wait until I finished college to have a baby. So, I am very discouraged and feel as if i'm never going to have enough money. I wanted to ask if this sounds like the best plan for me and my family? Also, is there anyone else that has been through this before and can give me some advice or just reassurance that this can work?

20090225064541AAXe620	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are the chances of getting pregnant from pre ***? Please read the details...?	Okay, so I just had an IUD (Intrauterine device or aka birth control) removed. Last night my fiancee and I made love. For the first few minutes we made love without a condom on. But before he came he put one on. What are the chances of someone getting pregnant in my situation? If I took my birth control pill this morning does that lower the risk of me getting pregnant? It's not that we don't want a baby, we just wanted to wait a while, but a baby would be more than welcome. Thanks for all the answers!

20090225061245AAFNtcn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	So.. Im not pregnant?	Hi      Just wondering if it is too soon for me to test with First Response Early Result Gold Digital Read or EPT Certainty? Today is CD24. My period tends to fluctuate from 28-30 days cycles. I took one yesterday and today with FMU and NEG. Is it just too soon? My breasts are a little sore, nipples hurt a little. No areola changes. Should i see some kind of symptoms if i am? CM today seems wet, kind of tacky but kind of lotiony. Almost more warm and wet then usual. the some bottom part of my cervix feels hard but the very tip is still kind of soft. it almost feels like it may be come hard pretty soon.   I have been suffering from gas and lower back pain. ocassionally it feels wierd along my sides by my ribs, like a strained muscle. Ive been getting lower abdominal cramps everyday since i did my insemination on CD 11 & 12. I have also experience nausea over the past 8-9 days and slight vomitting last week. I occassionally feel myself get a little wet in my panties, when the cm is coming down. which isnt my normal, im normally pretty dry. Ive also been bloated.      I am wondering what all of this could be about...i really hope this works. i always appreciate the time u take to answer...      Baby dust to all
20090227083858AAlFea2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My parents visit every other weekend and completely steal my daughter from me.?	I'm 18, with a 2 year old.. My parents moved away, and they visit every other weekend or so. When they come home, my daughter clings to them with every breath in her body. I'm not at all a bad mom, I love on her and play games with her nearly all day long. It really hurts my feelings when I see her playing the same games I plaid with her the day before with "mimi". She even confuses saying mimi and mama, so she sometimes calls her mama. My parents give her absolutely everything she asks for, and if something bad has to be done, or punishment is in order I hear "uh ohh where's momma.." because apparently I'm the bad guy. We have a routine at night where I sing my daughter songs, and read her a story, then she goes to sleep, she might get up a few times and come to her door, then I just lay her back down, then she goes down fine.. As soon as they hear her shed a tear, they go and lay down with her until she falls asleep. I understand that they love her and miss her, but they make it miserable for me when they're here, seeing her run to them when she gets scared, or is hurt..I'm the mommy, thats my job.. I have tried politely asking them to take a step back, and they either get offended and dont mess with either of us the entire time they're home, or they laugh and say "thats what grandparents are supposed to do." We have extended family coming over today, and its going to embarass me to no end to see them see how my daughter acts when my parents are home.. How do I get my little girl back?

I posted a question earlier about my teenage son causing lots of problems etc with agression abuse etc getting in trouble with Police, lashing out etc.       Quite a few people recommended smacking.  After a chat today with the School nurse who is going to recommend some counselling for my son, she said that if I were to smack him and it was found out - or my son were to report me - I would get in serious trouble with Social Services who would look into removing my son and me being in trouble with the Police!      And if he were to hit me back - even if he badly hurt me - I'd still be in more trouble for the smacking cos he is a minor!        Well that is Britian for you!      I totally believe that when we were allowed to 'smack' our children - that they were more controllable and obedient.  What do you think?  Does anyone still smack their kids, despite this new law?

20090227090639AAZ4EtZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Going craaaazy... please help?	I'm on CD 14. I had my last period Feb 13th, and my periods usually last 3 days. Cycles usually average 32 days. Ok, on to the situation I'm in.      The other day I noticed a slimy brown discharge when I wiped. The next day, it was in my underwear (tmi, gross..sorry), and tonight after BD w/ the hubby, there it was again. Actually, for the past 3 days it's been around just wiping.      So after researching I see that you get a slimy brown discharge when ovulating, which I should be ovulating right now. Thing is, I've never had anything like this before. The more I researched, the more "implantation" kept coming up. Now, I've been TTC for awhile now...so of course I would absolutely be thrilled if that was the case, however I would have had to ovulate early. I don't keep track of my ovulation. Sometimes I go to those ovulation calculators which said I should be ovulating at this time, but seriously? Wtf. I'm dumbfounded. I'm nowhere near my period yet.      What do you guys think?
20090227091934AAfYZNq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What shall I feed a vegetarian 6 month old?	Lukas is 6 months in a couple of days.  He's been on solids for about 6 weeks and has had just about every fruit/veg puree we can think of, then mixed together in different combos, plus baby cereal, the occasional rusk (he loves getting stuck in to them) and recently we've been giving him petits filous, which he's also enjoyed.  We tried moving on to mashed food, but he wasn't having it and gagged!  He did manage to almost finish a jar of baby veg pasta (that did have lumps) so I think he's ok with some lumps, just not others!  I know they say avoid gluten until 6 months, but my health visitor said baby foods containing gluten were fine... I've later read things that lead me to believe otherwise but he's had it now and been fine so no going back!         We're vegetarian and bringing him up veggie too... other than pureed meats what can we try next?  I want to start giving him "proper meals" (pureed or mashed obviously) rather than just fruit and veg.  He had lentil chilli (without chilli or salt) and "roast dinner" (potatoes, veg and baby gravy).  Does anyone have more ideas?  What did your babies like at this age?        Also, any other veggie parents... do you know when babies can have meat substitutes like Quorn, soya mince etc?

20090227090642AAc8xi9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Can you help me with sleep issues?	My son is going on 18 months, and still is not sleeping through the night. When he was younger 10-12 months he slept from 7:30 at night til 6 or 7 the next morning with no wake times, but then Ike hit, and we had to evacuate, and stay with my husbands dad. He went from sleeping in his crib to sleeping in a pack-n-play. The first night he slept ok, but every night after that he was up for 1-3 hours at a time. Even now he wakes up and is awake for 1-3 hours. I have tried giving him a snack to see if maybe it was hunger that woke him, but he never wants to eat. He just wants to sit on the couch. All the lights stay off, and he just sits there. And then to make things worse he has started going to bed later and later. I have always rocked him to sleep, but I feel he is old enough now that I should be able to put him in his bed, and have him fall asleep on his own. And little to my surprise he's not about to let that happen. I have tried letting him "cry it out" but I hate to hear my baby cry. Plus I don't know how long you are suppose to let them cry before checking on them. With my daughter we never had any of these problems. I am at wits end. I am always tired from lack of sleep, and my son is always cranky "once again from lack of sleep". What can I do to get him in a good sleep routine, and to where he will sleep through out the night? I haven't had a full nights rest since September. Please Help?

Period Due Jan 11   Feb 26 still no period   Feb 14 NEGATIVE blood and urine   Feb 20 NEGATIVE urine   --------------------------------------...   Had unprotected sex on the 13 and 14 of Feb, and also earlier on around the days I was SUPPOSED to ovulate...   --------------------------------------   Slight cramps sometimes,   Nipples are sore,   Nauseous at times,    Dizziness comes in mid afternoon,   Heartburn, but thats pretty normal for me,   Tired alot,    and that is all the symptoms that I could think of off the top of my head   --------------------------------------   Do you think that there is a possibilty that I could have gotten pregnant after I stopped trying as in like the 13 and 14th? That was after my period was already due, but I mean my tests keep coming up negative, but at times I really do feel like I am pregnant. I have another appointment tomorrow for some more pregnancy tests... also the doctor said her tests didn't come up positive until she was 6 weeks so if I did get pregnant when I was due for ovulating then I would be around 6 weeks.. Can you guys help me.. I been trying to make sense of all of this for awhile.   --------------------------------------...   Also I have been sick like a sinus infection or sinus cold and I'm not sure if that is where the dizziness is coming from or what?      Thanks for all the help!!

I have several friends and family whose doctors induced labor just because they asked, but a lot of other people I have talked to had to wait until they went into labor.  I am 39 1/2 weeks and have not asked my doctor but I have a feeling they would not do it unless there was a good reason.  I just wondered if it depends on the doctor, or if it's too risky to induce just because.  It just doesn't make sense (or seem fair!) that some people can just decide to be induced while others are not given that option.

20090227090056AAW0RgJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	3 month old boy EBF nurses every 2 hours, but only 5 min max?	I have a 3 month old boy and he is exclusively breastfed ( no bottles at all). He nurses in average every 2 hours, sometimes every hour and half, but nursing session lasts from 3 to 5 minutes maximum, one breast per feed (there is no way I can put him to the other side once he pulls off). And to be honest, I can never figure out if he is really hungry or not. I am just so afraid he will be hungry and offer him breast every time he starts fussing. He seems to gain weight well, 14lb, born 7.12 and has PLENTY of wet diapers and regular BM. My question is can he really get his meal that fast and what is possible to do to make his feedings more spaced out and longer?

She found out six months ago that this man was also sexually molesting their 6-year old daughter. Including rape and penetration. This woman said, "I suspected it was going on but wasn't sure."

When I'm at home it won't be a big deal because my dishwasher has a sterilizing cycle and I will use that for the bottles, nipples, etc.  However, if I'm traveling I would like to use bottled water to mix formula and to not have to sterilize the bottles and nipples if possible.      And on a related note, I have tried a few times to give my baby a bottle of formula to get him used to it and he flatly refuses to take it.  His father and siblings have also tried to give him bottles to no avail.  Pumping is not an option for me (I hate it and it never worked for me with any of my previous 4 children).  I'm starting to get frustrated.  I planned to breastfeed my son in the morning and at night once I start work but he willl be at daycare during the day for 8 hours and will need to take formula bottles during that time frame.  Any ideas how to get him to try the formula??  The nipple I'm using is the same nipple as is on my son's soother so I don't think that's the problem.  Just a small taste of the formula and he makes faces and refuses to drink! (:
20090307171833AAv741Q	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Recommended nursery rhymes book..?	I was hoping to get your opinion on the best nursery rhyme books, and also just books in general.

Any and all suggestions would be wonderful!!      Thanks so much everyone :)

I took 2 tests 3 days ago and the first one I looked at it and I could see the faintest 2nd line but when I held it up to a light you couldn't see it but when you held it down away from light you could see a faint line.      The second test as the pee went over the screen you wait for the normal line which comes second but as the pee went over the screen you could see it go over the first line which tells you your pregnant but then it faded to the faintest line then the second line came up.      I looked at it again and I could see the normal line and then a very faint line and it was the same as the first one where if you held it up to a light you couldn't see it but held it down you could just see it.

Now to start with, my life isn't bad by any means, I have some good friends even though I don't see any of them very often, I can talk to my family about some things, I live in a nice flat, am doing well in my studies, and have all my health. However, at the moment I am just feeling so unsure about what I want, and who I am, Im jealous of other peoples lives and keep asking myself what they're doing right that I'm not, I'd really like more regular reliable friends who i could go out alot more with but am worried it will never happen. I feel so lonely and bored and isolated sitting at home staring at a pc screen and it feels like a vicious cycle because you make friends by talking about things you do and being interesting and most of the time I do nothing or very little worth talking about. And before you say get involved with something honestly I dont have time with the huge amount of homework and revision on my hands.   Is this feeling familiar? Does it go over time?

20090307172259AAxSv3o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding mommies, am I doing the right thing?	I could use some feedback, especially from some moms who've been around the block a few times with breastfeeding and/or are currently bf-ing toddlers.   Before, my son was never too interested in solids (I'm doing baby-led solids and basically skipped purees).  But recently he's gotten better (pincher grasp and all) at feeding himself and he LOVES his solids.  It didn't bother me much until over the last 1.5 weeks it seems my supply is dropping.  I do nurse him before I offer food, and I definitely don't want to restrict food in anyway, but I also want to make sure that the majority of his food is breastmilk at least for the next 3 months.  Is this just a phase?  How can I make sure he doesn't start to like food more than boob?   Thanks!!!!

20090307171325AAIyfoG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Does all frizzy/ curly hair get straighter when wet and brushed?	I know that some people say you shouldn't brush wet hair (which I disagree with, unless you're truly damaging the hair), but I am wondering if it's normal for some curly hair types...especially the frizzy types that don't look anything close to straight hair,  to ever lay flat without the help of any heat or relaxers (just styling creams, at the most).  I'm especially wondering about toddlers and children, but really I wonder if it pertains to anyone's hair type?      My own daughter, who is 2 years old, has very, very very fuzzy curly short hair when she wakes up.  But, after I wet it and brush it down with a 100% natural soft round brush (and mind you, I am not seeing any breakage as her hair seems pretty strong), it actually lays flat on it's own, where most of it looks stick straight and shiny and only the ends looks like they have little ringlets.   I condition it, of course.  After I brush it straight, it pretty much dries that way as well as long as she doesn't rub against anything.  And it can stay that way for a few hours...that is, until she sleeps on it again (probably due to sweat).        Is this normal?  Or, does it possibly signify that her hair texture is changing, and the bottom is fuzzier than the rest?

20090307161442AAdL2kd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Parents took away driving privileges, acceptable punishment?	My parents took away my 'driving privileges' because I skipped school for three days. So now they've taken it away for three weeks!       The reason I skipped school was not just because I didn't go to school either, I had neglected to finish an important history project and needed more time to finish it.       The second thing is that was Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, around the 27th of february. I had a school CTSO conference to attend this last Monday Tuesday Wednesday, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th. My parents didn't tell me I had lost my driving priveleges until I returned from the conference on the 4th.       The only other thing is that it's more my Dad's punishment than my mother's. My mom doesn't agree, especially because she had given me permission to stay home Monday. But does this punishment seem acceptable? I understand and take responsibility for disregarding their rules, but I don't believe three weeks (especially with some of the inconsistancies) is fair.       If you believe it's not fair, what are some ways I might reason with them? My dad's usually very reasonable and will let me tell him my side, but lately I haven't gotten more than a sentence out before he starts yelling.

20090307161220AAELpVP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My grandson's behavior?	We haven't had our grandson for the first 21/2 years of his life due to some family issues. Since we have had him around on a consistent basis since Sept of last year, the opportunity has been wonderful. However, mom seems to think that when he comes to stay with Grandma, Grandpa, Auntie, and Uncle for a week or maybe just the weekend, that all the good things she enforces on him are just undone. Now, I feel that I have been the one who has taught him the right behavior. I do discipline him when needed. When his parents arrive, he'll start to act out. I tell them he was a perfect angel when they were gone and the minute they arrive, he won't listen, he'll start to whine, and then his daddy gives him a spanking. They say, "Everyone says he's good for them when we're gone." Why is that?   When it's time for mom to go back home (out of state. Daddy does not live with her) he doesn't want to go back. He wants to stay with Grandma.

He's never taken a single step on his own and when we hold his hands to help him along he sits down to crawl instead.

She's very fussy in the car and it's hard for my sister or husband to go anywhere. She'll cry and scream the whole time she's in the car. Even if she doesn't need anything (food, diaper change, a toy, a pacifier, etc.), she'll still cry. She rides rear-facing in the car. My sister once tried turning her seat front-facing and it worked. Her daughter didn't cry at all and was happy and giggling the whole time. But my sister and her husband don't feel it's safe to have her front-facing yet and I agree. But it's only way to keep my niece happy and from crying. We want her to be happy, but we want her to be safe too.

20090307165636AAOmYBw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is is safe to have another baby after you have eclampsia with your first?	Hello all! I gave birth to my first child in June of 2008. He was 8 weeks premature due to complications I had with full blown eclampsia. My blood pressure climbed so high that I had a seizure. Luckily, my husband was home and called 911 immediately. The doctors told me later that it was a lucky thing he was home, or else I might not have survived.    It was only after coming home from the hospital that I talked to my family and learned that I have a long family history of pre-e on my mom' side. I never knew, I never asked!    My doctors seem to think that "I'll be just fine" if I want to have another baby. They told me they would just watch me a lot closer.    Although I have read that pe-e is most common in first pregnancies, I also know that it is slightly common for women to get it in their second, too.    My husband and I would love to have another baby in about a year or two, but given the circumstances, I am afraid of what could happen. I know my doctor said it would be fine, but I am just not convinced.    I had hard time recovering after all of that and I don't know if I could do it again, and I def. never want to see my baby in the NICU again either.    What are the chances of it happening again? Is it worth it or should I just be happy with the one wonderful baby I have?    Thanks in advance all :)
20090307170021AArGvro	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	6 year old son driving husband and I crazy!!! What's wrong with him?	My son is 6 1/4 and his behaviour is getting worse not better. Ever since he was born he was fussy and demanded a lot of extra time and attention but now, he's like a calculating, manipulative, impulsive and aggressive adult!!!  He whines ALL the time and cries hysterically when he doesn't get what he wants. He at times have resorted to destructive behaviour ie. cutting clothes, destroying his own toys, peeing his bed while awake.      Hubby and I have set strict boundaries for him and constantly get them overstepped, resulting in punishment ( tv/games/toys taken away, timeouts, even spanking etc.) He is obsessed with video games and cartoons but he deliberately defies us and doesn't seem to care about consequences.       Academically, his teacher complains of him talking a lot in class and not completing tasks.        I'm very embarrassed of his behavior and have tried many things except for psycho-therapy, which as i see it, is a last resort.     What could be wrong with him?

20090307171253AAOwmXy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is there a great chance that for some reason I am not healthy enough to have another baby?	I am 22 and had one abortion at a young age, then I had my son when I was 19, then at 20 I had a miscarriage and then another one a year later.  Both of the miscarriages were at 17 weeks.  The 2 miscarriages were with someone totally different that my sons father. Now I am pregnant again with someone different and I am very worried about having another miscarriage.  They never found a cause for the 2 miscarriages, but the person I was with at the time has a heavy drug user, which I failed to mention to the doctors.  I am wondering if that played a role in the miscarriages or not.  Also, when I went to the doctors to let them know I was pregnant again, they told me there were options this time like getting a stitch in the cervix and taking antibiotics.  I am wondering if anyone knows anything about any of these 2 options and if it's at all possible that I can deliver a healthy baby??

20090307173523AAhA7cV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you think I should retest?	Ok so, to make a long story short i started having what seemed like pregnancy symptoms in the beginning of january, mid Jan i took two HPT came back negative. Beginning of February i had a very abnormal period, i dont really consider it a period becasue it was mostly light to moderate spotting even though i was cramping a bit. i took two HPT tests after the spotting stopped and both were negative, i was still haivng symptoms, now some of the symptoms have mellowed out a bit but my period is a couple days late. I know stressing out can delay a period, but mine is like clock work no matter what is going on and i dont feel like i normally do before i get it and i have heard stories of people having bleeding while they are pregnant and not getting a positive HPT until months later which concerns me because not knowing for months could casue some damage(my mother has had a miscarriage before, and a child with Anencephally which adds to my concern about not knowing). Do you guys think i should retest or go to the doctor or wait awhile longer before i start thiking along that route? i know you all arent doctors but i just wanted your opinions to ease my worries a bit or point me in the right direction of what i should do at this point. Thanks

20090307134302AAeb3RR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	How do I legally adopt my brother?	Now, to preface, my wife and I already have legal guardianship over him (my brother) but I feel legal adoption would fofer a better set of legal protections in addition to emotional security for him.       Unfortunatley, all the attempts I've amde to elarn how to do this have led straight to adoption of babies and small children and whatn ot. I'm hoping someone can lead me in the right direction.      We live in Nevada if that helps any. Thank you in advance.
20090307140247AABuHIj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Prolonged post miscarriage bleeding?	Since its the weekend, and I have to wait til Monday to call my doctor, I figured I could give this a shot. I would appreciate any advice or input.   Thanks in advance, and sorry that this is soo long.   So, my question is: Have you experienced prolonged bleeding after a miscarriage? Where you able to conceive after the bleeding eventually stopped?   At my 12 week check-up, I was told that the fetus had stopped growing at 8 wks 5 days. Unfortunately after weeks of waiting, my body never started the process naturally, so on the 14th of January I was given misoprostol (vaginally). Within 2 hours, I started miscarrying. By the next day, I felt better, thinking that the worst was over...but by the following Sunday..it all started again...twice as bad. I passed more clots and bled fairly heavily.   I continued bleeding for about a good 3 weeks (heavily)...during that time it would taper off, and then start again..my HCG levels were still elevated...my bleeding went from heavy to spotting, and alternating between brown and bright red. At the 1 month mark, I was given medication that would shrink up my uterus, which would help with the bleeding. 5 weeks pass, and I am still spotting...sometimes like a light period, sometimes just like in between spotting. One day I finally stop bleeding and think it's finally over....my husband and I had sex (with condom) and right after I started bleeding again. Went to the doctor that week and was told my HCG levels needed to be at 0, for me to do anything...My last readings were at 17, then at 7 and eventually at 5.5 (almost 3 weeks ago-doctor said that levels were fine, no d&c needed, no more pregnancy). About 2 weeks ago.. I stopped bleeding again...for 2 full days....so, once again my husband and I had sex and once again i started spotting again right after.   I am now going on 8 weeks all together of constant spotting/bleeding..The spotting varies from brown to bright red. Having to wear pads constantly has left me very sore and irritated down there.   I am sooo fed up with this whole process. The miscarriage alone was so painful..I have no idea why I am being punished with this on top of it.   Has anyone else experieced something like this??
