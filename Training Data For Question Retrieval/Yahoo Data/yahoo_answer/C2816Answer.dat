RzaP9bQmaa	That squidgy sign is the symbol of  British Sterling I:e Pound. <br>  <br>  <br>  I must admit it does sound to good to be true, it also sound's very clever and also very risky.  <br>  <br>  I have always thought that the Chinese takeaway business has to be the most conpetitivetd industry going. It amazes me how many Chinese takeaways there are on top of eachother I have even known three Chinese takeaways on the same road. So maybe this offer has two motives. <br>  <br>  1, With the credit crunch going, the company feels if they show people genorosity with not only giving away free food but money as well. Hopefuly in the long run when everything takes a turn for the better the very same customers will remember them, and take their orders there. <br>  <br>  2, With all the compettiton between themselves and the other Chinese Takeways, are they trying to take custom away from other business? <br>  <br>  <br>  There must be some limitations to the general public?  Maybe the offer is only allowed to a person once every two weeks, or the free food is in fact a really small portion of rice?  <br>  <br>  I think this is a really good business ploy, how many people are going in this takeaway just grab one thing?  They are still going to spend money. <br>  <br>  I know Domino's Pizza (the uk branch) are offering a free item on your online order i:e Free Cheesy garlic bread or Free Chicken Strippers. The majority of people think because they are getting a free item that can order another thing.  I know this applies to my partner when he orders online because he is getting a free item, it makes it ok to order something else as well.  <br>  <br>  So in a way other businesses have started to do this, another example is Burger King, with there ￡1.99&￡2.99 meals, now these meals are so tiny that they must cost hardly anything to buy from the surpplier. Burger King will make a huge profit on this deal.|`|9xr2cyTBaa	what is that squiggly sign?  do you mean a dollar?  but yeah, i don't think that's a good business plan, especially during hard hit times like these where businesses are doing anything and everything they can to save each and every buck.  people tend to forget the generosity and when they have money, they're most likely to buy some luxury item over chinese food.  <br>  i prefer indian, btw :)|`|DTAzCQlqaa	Its a very clever business decision if they have enough behind them to keep afloat.<br>  <br>  But at the same time it does seem a likke too god to be true|`|1eDNxCZKaa	yum yum yum   fooooooood|`|YUi1W7ZZaa	i think its a great idea, more business need to advertise more <br>  and keep the customers coming back!|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I would hope it wouldn't be the Chinese.  They're stealing business away from the US.  I should know.  My husband just lost his job because they are sending his work over there.<br>  <br>  Anyway, there are a few places in the US that are doing free food days as well.  It helps, but it doesn't solve the problem at hand.  Most of all the big businesses that were high end price gaugers are now out of business.|`|h9y1IZA2aa	They are doing something like this by me aswell, every weekend the 1st 100 customers get there whole meal for free. i have never bothered though cause the queue is right down the street before it's even opened lol<br>  There idea is the same, aswell as people remembering there generosity, they are also attracting new customers who have never bough from there before so when the deal ends they are hopeing the new customers will continue to buy from them.|`|gZlRnTISaa	When you consider the other advertising options available to small restaurants/takeaways - this doesn't appear as expensive as it could be - but will surely be significantly better received.<br>  <br>  Of course you will have people coming along with no intention of ever returning, but that's half the battle with advertising, no matter what you spend/do its all about numbers - plus they can do loads to make the meals slightly cheaper - or have set cheaper options for the free deal...<br>  <br>  I think its a brilliant marketing idea - and like the other poster said, where there were limits - ie. first 100 per weekend - it can be very controlled with what gets given out for free...!!!|`|MWE7rQ4Daa	What the? I would be walking in and out of that place faster than usain bolt, where is it?|`|LWXMUmFOaa	sounds too good to be true
7QrqI6xfaa	I worked at Mcdonalds for the most part of 2008, my pay was always late but 4hrs to 24hrs. the pay was crap compared to most jobs i've had, the people I worked with on day shifts were lazy and only worked with the roostering manager cuz they were best friends and didnt even do anything all day.<br>  Some mcdonalds need to put more stuff on so the service of customers is faster and they have better quality food.<br>  I worked and drive thru and only once put out the wrong order cuz it was 4am i'd been working since 9pm hadnt had a break and he was a total *** hole and the people who worked before me had nothing done and they didnt make much in sales so it would have been pretty quite.<br>  they need better quility food, less water in there drinks, need to fill the cups all the way and whole meal burger buns would be a good idea.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	They need to add more changes periodically to their menu..I worked there 30 years ago..and everything is basically the same. There was a rumor then that they were coming out with a McFeast sandwich...sounded great..but guess it didn't fly for some reason or other.|`|NPgKtzo8aa	Definitely bring back the McPizza, and make it healthier - I understand that "fast" food is meant to be quick, but maybe if they sacrificed a minute to drain the grease, I'd hbe a lot more eager to eat there.|`|9OimLHPlaa	the staff are the nearest thing to robots i have ever seen.a smile,a welcome,and politeness would go a long way.|`|gaWZ79gNaa	nothing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtL1yrRNSM5nfjN2Hu0Px_jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225052926AA3kQ61">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|QgxZOI4Iaa	MAY BE... <br>  just may be.. <br>  they could stop torturing animals for a change, and have vegetarian and vegan choices on their menu. :)|`|BnqjD1P2aa	Brand Promise = Crew Satisfaction + QSC|`|LoTvlrsjaa	Give worker's comp. to people who help others from attack. <br>  <br>  Or not make the hash browns so greasy.|`|YUi1W7ZZaa	how about they just stop selling all the crap<br>  that they do and offer all different types of food from around the world.|`|Poqf1cp3aa	For starters, they could make their food better (healthwise)<br>  Normally I stay away from McDonalds.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	They should make healthier meals.  The salads that they sell are outrageously priced.  Why would anyone spend $5 for lettuce?  The store by me just upgraded.  They have tvs, Mccoffee, new items for sale and are pretty quick, for the most part.  I don't eat there, but my daughter used to work there.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I need a job badly right now.  The factory in town is closing it's doors and there isn't a lot to be had around here.  I filled out an app there last week.  I hope BK calls me instead.  I would rather work night shift than get paid more at McDs,|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	They should go back to basics. They had an apple pie in the 70's-80 that was so much better. They should have a fish sandwich using better quality fish than pollock. Try using whole grain rolls instead of white bread. Give student and senior discounts. There's a couple to work on.|`|103d3879d1499695e3f4a5d95bcd053baa	not all students (sorry) and peops that actually look human and smile!! having said that the wages are crap don't ever work there josh that and dunnes not too nice to there juniour staff|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Not sure about ethically, but it would be nice to (just once) get the correct order from drive thru.

z7MPaUELaa	I think everything is ok in moderation. As long as they don't have fast food all the time they should be fine. Too much fast food however could result in obesity and bad eating habits.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	obesity and they will grown accustom to eat and will be more likely to go to it in adulthood x|`|8VrlRUfhaa	It teaches children that every thing in life must be done at a fast pace.

They are addicting because of that, and the companies know it. Kids have problems with obesity, and more and more are being diagnosed with high blood pressure because of obesity and the high sodium content in prepared foods. Look at labels in the grocery store and you'll see that lots of prepared foods have heavy sodium and sugar content. Eat fresh foods as much as possible and you will lose the addiction.|`|pmNmrVj4aa	you can get stomach poisionINotefrom eating to much fast food you need to watch your childern if they are under 9 years old because they might have problem later in the future|`|sYRPEjsQaa	they become addicted to it and they gain weight,clog their arteries and when they grow up they become big fat lazy people who run through the drive thru to get even more fast food while steering with their stomach because they are too lazy to get out and walk in.|`|UGSlEhnbaa	Kids get addicted, become obese and slowly become sedentary and lose interest in their activities.
JfVxCDb7aa	yes I do<br>  <br>  their food is super fattening<br>  <br>  but you can't beat their prices.|`|VvbOSbRnaa	I usually only stop there on Sunday mornings before I go to work and get a bacon egg and cheese biscuit.|`|AA11684189	I hate McDonald's and I don't see why anybody goes there when there's much better fast food around. The only things I will get at McDonald's is an Eggnog or Shamrock Shake, or a McFlurry.|`|kKmuFi4zaa	Yes, I like the grilled chicken sandwich. The milkshakes aren't bad either.|`|pbfkYJ2daa	i like it.|`|GHd84xipaa	my dog loves McDonalds|`|VoV7jGc3aa	For the most part I really don't like McDonald's except for breakfast every once in a while (like maybe once a year). However I heard that their salads are pretty good now. <br>  <br>  What drives me nuts is how much my stepsons like it! That food is so bad for them, yet its their favorite so  we get it for them as a treat sometimes (not often).|`|pUF71f1laa	Just walking in the door makes me Smile!<br>  <br>  Oh Man! I love their Fry's when they are hot and just came out of the fryer and with salt and ketchup washed down with a icy cold Coke with a nice warm Big Mac where the pickles are still crisp and the cheese is all melty.

It is the worst food for you but I think it tastes so good. I feel really guilty when I eat it, but I do treat myself to a bigmac maybe like twice a year.|`|gxL9qeTyaa	I like McDonalds. It is the only fast food restaurant we have in our little town so its nice but we need something else now!!|`|ee132737d0e2aeb1472848f439feaf8aaa	in and out is sooo much better.

The food was great (we had steak with the best pepper sauce I have tasted).  The prices were reasonable and they were playing some great retro music.  The decor and staff were really nice but relaxed and not stuffy.  For a birthday I would recommend.  We ate in Norwich branch.|`|lj47k4A1aa	ahhh yeah frankie and benny ribs rock so bad!

ncojw5ttaa	FAMOUS FAMIGLIA... I always go there when I'm in Times Square. It's really good and they have a lot of different types of pizza/toppings.

BB76pnzzaa	Geisha House! It has the BEST sushi, great atmosphere, and GREAT sake bombs! But still classy, of course =)    Another fun place that is not classy but is a great drinking place and has a mechanical bull is Saddle Ranch right on the Sunset strip.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Try Los Tacos Mexican Restaurant in West Hollywood.  It's 1 block west of Fairfax on Santa Monica Blvd.  It's sandwiched between a 7-11, and an all-night laundromat.  They don't serve alcohol, but they got the best Mex food this side of the border.  And they're open 24hrs!!  Great food after a night of drinkin'!  With a designated driver, of course...|`|gaXUIduMaa	Joe's Crab Shack.  Although it has a bar, it is okay for all ages.  Be sure to tell them it is your 21st birthday.|`|dikIXLWHaa	pizza hut|`|wbXE9ip2aa	T.G.I. Fridays is the most common restaurant to have a mixed-age party but if you want a lot of fun....try to find the nearest Dave & Busters to you and go there....it's like a Chuck E. Cheese for adults. Any age can go there and they serve food & alcohol. I think there's an age requirement after a certain time so make sure to go a little earlier. The one I go to is at the Block in Orange.
