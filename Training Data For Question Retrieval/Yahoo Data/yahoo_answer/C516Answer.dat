2de81b2b1d77d27b8da01b5ff5df17c1aa	Gamma rays are sometimes used in treating cancer because of what they are and what they do.<br>  <br>  Gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation. Just like light or radio waves. Except that they are of a much higher energy than light or even X-rays. They are absorbed or scattered by anthing they pass through, and their ability to penetrate material and the amount of scattering they experience varies as the material. But they penetrate stuff pretty well, and slice right through biological stuff like plant or animal tissue. And they do stuff to the tissue they pass through while zipping past.<br>  <br>  The high energy of gamma rays is what is called ionizing radiation. It has the power to break chemical bonds between atoms. This is important because living tissue is made up of complex chains of atoms. Big organic molecules are the basics of life. If a gamma ray zips by, it can break the big molecule apart kind of like snipping a string in a place or two with scissors. The gamma ray loses energy doing this, but it still continues on cutting up molecules. It causes radiation damage. Electromagnetic radiation (emr) damage. And this can be good.<br>  <br>  It turns out that though emr damage can make living cells "sick" and can also kill them if enough damage occurs, the cells that are most sensitive to emr damage are cells that have "fast metabolisms" or that work at high rates. Cancer cells work at high rates. Irradiate them with high energy emr (gamma rays) and they can be killed. So will some surrounding tissue, but the brunt of the damage will be caused to the cancerous tissue. And by moving the beam around, we can minimize damage to surrounding tissue while pounding the cancerous cells. This is the basis for current radiation therapy by gamma rays.

65Gk2etyaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  It's mainly because some men develop quicker than other men. Especially at the age you are given. For the same reason, I'm more muscly than the guys in my group of friends. It's a matter of time before they are the same. Except not all people will be really muscular. Some people are born with thin builds/frames and will always be skinny. I'm more muscly than my friends, as i said, and i do no sport at all. Nor do i work out.<br>  <br>  Please, don't work out now. Do sport, physical exercise etc. But don't work out. At your age it can seriously damage growth, and stunt growth even!<br>  <br>  Hope all works out,<br>  Beau
o0I5YXMNaa	If it is still preying on your mind so much, it would really be better to talk to someone.<br>  <br>  Every town has a sexual health clinic/hospital department. You don't need an appointment and they are totally non-judgmental.<br>  You can speak plainly to them and they will do their best to put you at ease.<br>  <br>  Please try to talk to someone.<br>  It's easy to say don't worry, but perhaps if you talk with someone who will take you seriously, it may help.
CNDGtlJhaa	Oh girl!!  I feel for you and him, I am a recovering herion addict for 3 years now but I also tried different other drugs.  Side effects could last for years and as for crack there are a few to be concerned about like heart problems, breathing, and emotional problems depending how much and long he had been doing it, the one I would be concerned about is the drinking because that effects the liver and the liver is one of the main organs in a persons body and once that fails forget it, he def needs professional help but with family supporting him would help a million too!  There are many web sites to go on and check out different things to comfort you, which you seem to care alot about your uncle maybe try to get him in a intervention or something, talk to him and don't give in to him hopefully he would want to change his life and realize that there are so many different things he can be doing right now that would benefit him instead of wasting himself.

5rJ6nf2oaa	This has nothing at all to do with gallbladder disease. <br>  <br>  You are absolutely right. The reason fried food makes you sick now is because your liver doesn't like it, these foods are toxic to the liver which is a major digestive organ.<br>  <br>  Chips and fried foods usually contain enormous amounts of salt which we become addicted to and crave these foods when we start to eat them regularly. When we stop eating them, our tastebuds return to normal and can't cope with the salt content anymore. The body normally craves what it needs; if we give it an addcition to something it thinks it needs that food. However when a normal healthy diet is followed the body is free to crave only those foods it really needs.<br>  <br>  The other factor to consider in chips and other types of fried and processed foods is that they are often full of additives and these do actually have a taste and it's not a nice one. I've noticed exactly the same thing as you after I had changed my diet for the better.<br>  <br>  Good quality chocolate and cheese by contrast are quite good for us so long as we don't eat too much and overdo the fat intake.<br>  <br>  There's some further reading below if you want it.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	That happens frequently to people who develop gall bladder disease.

pXPdO2I8aa	It is unlikely that you will get it again.<br>  Most people have chickenpox at some stage (usually as a child). The virus does not completely go after you have chickenpox. Some virus particles remain inactive in the nerve roots next to your spinal cord. They do no harm there, and cause no symptoms. For reasons that are not clear, the virus may begin to multiply again (reactivate). This is often years later. The 're-activated' virus travels along the nerve to the skin to cause shingles<br>  Shingles cannot be passed from person to person as shingles but you may catch chickenpox from a person with shingles,if you never have had chickenpox yourself .<br>  Crusted over spots aren't contagious.|`|Cub8LmfXaa	hi,im afraid there is nothing you can do. i had chicken pox at the age of 5. and shingles twice in my teens. shingles are what the doctors call the "dormant" form of chicken pox. when the chicken pox goes the shingles are sometimes left in the body dormant,or you can catch them if someone has chicken pox and you have already had them. it can come out at any time.i havent had them since the 2nd outbreak.  you can only have chicken pox once.its the shingles you can pick up as its highly contagious|`|IKakoOfyaa	Chickenpox is most contagious one or two days before the rash appears.

wwP3ONCFaa	Persistent bad breath doesnt mean you eat too many onions. Bad breath is a sign of major gum disease. It can also be gases and odors coming up from gastrointestinal problems. If you halitosis hangs on more than 24 hours without an obvious cause, see your dentist or doctor. <br>  <br>  Some tips to get rid of those mouth odors:<br>  Eat Parsley. Parsley adds more than green to your lunch plate; its also a breath-saver. Parsley can freshen your breath naturally. <br>  <br>  Gargle a minty mouthwash. If you need 20 minutes of freedom from bad breath, gargling with a mouthwash is a great idea. But like Cinderella's coach-turned pumpkin, when your time is up, the magic will be gone and you'll be back to talking behind a hand again. Choose your mouthwash by color and flavor. Amber and medicine-flavored mouthwashes contain essential oils such as thyme, eucalyptus, peppermint, and wintergreen, as well as sodium benzoate or benzoic acid. Red and spicy mouthwashes may contain zinc compounds. Both types will neutralize the odor-producing waste products of your mouth bacteria|`|bppI7Pxzaa	Hello,<br>  Here are a few tips to stop bad breathe...<br>  1. Brush your teeth twice a teeth.<br>  2. Use mouth wash after brushing teeth ( avoid chemical ones )<br>  4. Eat fruits and vegetables.<br>  4. Chew sugarless chewing gum.<br>  5. Learn the side effects of any medications you may be taking, are they causing your bad breath? If so, you may wish to call your doctor to see if you can switch medications if bad breath is a big issue for you. <br>  6. Follow your diet for a few days. Are you eating a lot of something known for causing bad breath? For example, garlic, onions and some types of fish are known to cause bad breath, and cutting back can help. <br>  7. If you'd like to fix the problem naturally rather than going the usual route, chew - do not swallow - a sprig of parsley or mint, or a fennel seed or two, before and after eating to get rid of post-meal halitosis. <br>  If you'd rather go the usual route, gargle with a mouthwash or have a sugar-free mint or stick of gum. Some mints have ingredients designed to absorb, not just mask bad odors. Sugar-free gum generally promotes salivation, which helps rinse away troublesome bacteria. Sugary gums and mints have a sour aftertaste and feed oral bacteria (bad for your teeth and your breath). <br>  8. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to promote salivation and wash away bacteria without giving the remainder food to grow on. Being well hydrated also thins the mucus secretions in your nose passage, which when thick can harbor bad-smelling bacteria. <br>  9. Purchase and use a tongue scraper and/or vigorously brush your tongue--your teeth are not the only place where odor-causing bacteria form. Make sure to brush the back of your tongue, not just the front. <br>  10. Floss on a regular basis. This is still necessary, even after a toothbrush cleaning. <br>  11. Consider that your bad breath may be stemming from within. While some bad breath is "superficial," (i.e., caused by bacteria in the mouth) it is oftentimes the result of postnasal drip or poor digestion. Your doctor may be able to help with postnasal drip. To alleviate the second type of bad breath, make it a point to eat a serving of "active culture" yogurt every day. The healthy bacteria in the yogurt will aid in digestion, and quickly eliminate any traces of internally generated bad breath.<br>  <br>  More tips.<br>  Chances are, your breath is not as bad as you think it is. Ask someone you trust (and will give you an honest answer) if they think you have bad breath. <br>  General rule of thumb: if you have a taste in your mouth, however light, you have bad breath. This only applies during periods of time when you aren't eating. <br>  With so many choices of toothpastes on the market, pick one that you like the flavor of so that you'll enjoy brushing your teeth. <br>  Don't drink bad-smelling liquids, as these particularly stick around in your mouth - drink lots of water but not milk, because it makes your breath smell REALLY bad, and don't go heavy on juice or liquor. <br>  Some South Americans may gargle with one teaspoon of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot water in the morning. This could keep mouths fresh all day. <br>  To keep your toothbrush free of bacteria, store it, head down, in a lidded plastic tumbler of hydrogen peroxide. Rinse the brush down well before you use it. <br>  Tea can effectively get rid of bad breath caused by thick mucus, and drinking a cup daily will gradually decrease the bad odor. <br>  If you don't want to purchase a tongue brush, then you can also just use your regular toothbrush<br>  <br>  If you want to check if you have bad brethe here are a few ideas.<br>  <a href="http://www.therabreath.com/art_testbreath.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.therabreath.com/art_testbreat...</a><br>  Hope that helps =)<br>  x|`|lz6vt0ofaa	gargle hydrogen peroxide then brush really good and use a mouthwash I've got a bad cavity and I haven't made it to the dentist yet but I get a bad taste every once in a while, biotene mouthwash works really well its not cheap but it works good and there is no alcohol in it so it does not burn at all.|`|hggYZSyQaa	Have a dentist appointment,breath spray and breath mints work.|`|ANRTDInTaa	sometimes bad breath can be caused by going without food for a while.so if you havnt eaten today- i suggest you do so now|`|YQYMPGK3aa	eat an apple.|`|CNDGtlJhaa	well if it's your tooth, see a dentist!!

But there are finer points to masturbation, and there are many ways to make it more enjoyable.<br>  <br>  There will be times when you feel a strong need to masturbate when it isn't convenient. In this case you may want to ejaculate as quickly as possible, perhaps in the bathroom. That's fine — but you should know masturbation, like two-person sex, is much more pleasurable when you can relax and take your time. If you have your own bedroom and can close the door, you can have a great masturbation session every night and perhaps every morning, too. If you share your room, you can masturbate privately in the bathroom or shower. Or, you can wait for your brother to fall asleep and masturbate quietly under your covers. But if he hears you, be prepared to answer some questions!<br>  <br>  Some guys masturbate by lying on their stomach and rubbing their penis against their bed. A more common technique involves lying on your back and rubbing your penis with a hand (or hands). In this position, when you ejaculate, the semen will end up onto your chest or stomach, so it will be easy to clean up. (You'll probably want to pull up or take off your pajama top or T-shirt, so as not to wet it with semen, and you'll want to have a roll of toilet paper or a box of Kleenex handy.)<br>  <br>  Just about every successful masturbation session begins with getting an erection (ee-RECK-shun), commonly called a "hard-on," "*****," or "woody." An erection occurs when your penis fills with blood to the point that it becomes quite a bit larger and firm to the touch, usually sticking straight out from your body or angled upward as you stand. (If you're lying on your back, your erect penis might rest against your abdomen.) Getting an erection is usually as easy as thinking sexy thoughts and rubbing your penis. If you're going through puberty, or if you haven't ejaculated in a while, you may not have to do anything to get an erection — they can happen spontaneously, or without provocation. This is normal and just one of those puberty things everyone has to deal with.<br>  <br>  Once your penis has reached its full length and hardness, take a hold of it and rub it lengthwise at a consistent rate. This will mimic what it feels like to move your penis in and out of a woman's vagina, which is what happens during sexual intercourse.|`|6TSwoU3yaa	Perhaps you need to work out what is not pleasurable with what you are already doing, then try something different.<br>  Seems to me you have the right ideas already.<br>  Masturbation is not a science.

If you really feel something is not right, keep asking different doctors, and keep doing research online.

While herpes symptoms usually occur in approximately the same place each time (say, on the tongue) the truth is that the virus has actually infected that entire section of your body - your face - and so you can get outbreaks anywhere on your mouth, lips, cheeks, etc.    Licking your lips won't change the chances of getting an infection on your lips.   <br>  <br>  For a lot of  good information on oral herpes, I recommend the website below.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	No.  Cold sores tend to stick to your lips.

KL1Y5FeHaa	As you have never had sex, it could be either<br>  <br>  Diet changes<br>  Stress related (even worrying)<br>  Your periods could be irregular (it happens)|`|bSDAdMfnaa	yeah i think it could be stress related or it could be to do with your eating habits <br>  <br>  make sure you are eating a balanced diet and drinking plenty water also most teenagers go thro ups and downs with there  periods have you recently went on the pill or something  this can change your cycle as well|`|820fcc25e1d405c3b1bd1d47e46df2b2aa	How old are you? If you are in your teens, then it's not too surprising, your body is still developing and growing, which is related to hormone changes, which are related to periods. <br>  <br>  Periods can stop from time to time. Have their been anything different happening in your life recently? Taken any tablets, change in weight or diet, more exercise, emotional events? I would try to not worry about it too much (I know not easy), and enjoy the lack of mess. If you are a virgin, you aren't (as you say) pregnant, so you don't need to worry about that.|`|mNqNqKrIaa	the best way to solve this is to see a doctor.<br>  I have a friend who hadn't her period for delayed nearly 2 months (she was a virigin), so she went to see a doctor and the doc gave her some pills. Her period was back and everything was normal again.
i4bjQbPcaa	I was on it years ago and while it made my periods a lot shorter and lighter it also made me have terrible PMT symptoms before.  It made me really short tempered.|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	ive been on it since i was 19 (im 23 now). my periods last about 5 days now, my boobs have gone from a large B cup to a medium D cup and i have gained about 2 stone since being on it. i do tend to get mood swings, and not only around the time im due on. im coming off it in august anyway, you shouldnt stay on the same pill for years and years|`|qjDxKXENaa	They have made me very stressed and was bleeding for the whole month. I had to stop them. All bad sides not good.|`|1iDSGET4aa	Well, because my cycle was so screwed up (irregular, differing 'heaviness', different lengths each month etc), I haven't really noticed a change in length, but they now tend to last about 5 or 6 days, and are much lighter. My boons haven't really changed that much, and I haven't had any side-effects apart from the fact that I get less hungry so have lost some weight. If you manipulate the packets (ie run two together to avoid having your period for a specific thing, for example a holiday), I've noticed that my period is slightly heavier, but that's it really. It stopped me getting stomach cramps and migraines, so I guess I've only had good side-effects|`|CzeKDSpwaa	I'm 28 & have been using mycrogynon 30 since I was 18.<br>  <br>  My period lasts between 3 & 5 days, unless I make it shorter, by starting another pack early.  Which I don't, usually.<br>  <br>  My boobs have always been massive, even before starting this pill, so I can't answer that, except to say, that they go up & down in size, according to my weight.  Although I will never go short in that department.  I am a size 10 - 12. The 12 is because I need a bigger size on top to accommodate my 34g boobs.<br>  <br>  Good effects for me.... control of my period AND not getting pregnant.  :O}<br>  <br>  <br>  Are you using it to control heavy periods?|`|f75x8aI3aa	Mine went from nearly a week down to  3/4 days, with my period being a lot lighter.<br>  <br>  I haven't noticed any change in my boob size, however my sister as gone up at least one cup size.<br>  <br>  Good effects: periods a lot lighter, no period pains, my skin has also cleared up ( i was prone to getting quite a few spots and now i only get the odd one.)<br>  <br>  Bad effects: I've felt more hungry...however i actually haven't put on anymore weight<br>  <br>  That's about all i can think of =)|`|zK1V9Mu7aa	I've got pregnant twice off microgynon lol..maybe because it didn't work for me, but I have spoken to a few people who have said the same thing. If your going on birth control you must not want kids,so though I should let you know!<br>  Periods stayed the same - a week long.<br>  Boobs stayed the same.|`|w1l1ryscaa	I have. My periods improved but I had the most terrible mood swings - i'm talking really bad!!! I also have 2 friends who became clinically depressed whilst using this pill.<br>  Everyone is different though so if this pill has been recommended for you take it but monitor yourself carefully for a few months. If you are ok after 3-6 months then it could still be right for you.|`|lKFLeKmSaa	its worked for me<br>  periods shortened to only 4 days, boobs may hav gotten bigger...but im 16 so they might have just grown anyway lol<br>  they have pretty much gotten rid of all period pain, which was KILLING me before<br>  still get mood swings at 'that time of the month' though, but not as bad as they were before i was on microgynon30
AA11705978	12 to 16 weeks
PyQhb7gCaa	yeah that is what i heard ..|`|RJdWIHR7aa	no you lose loads of weight really quickly. but if you start eating loads the after you start to eat again then it will go back on but if you go back to food slowly then you would only put on one or two pounds out of the loads you just lost :)|`|ANRTDInTaa	not true- you will lose a lot of weight. however once you start getting into the regime of eating again- u will put on weight very easily|`|wZmp9mAWaa	well i've heard that your body has to use all its fat that its stored away or something like that<br>  also on that kellogs advert they said that a person who eats a whole grain cereal for breakfast is more likely to lose weight than someone who doesn't. <br>  so yeah it does make you put on weight|`|pGHyYHmMaa	dang rando destroyed that question. def giv him best answer|`|iXpQdp45aa	yeah|`|LpaUZNPkaa	No, it's wrong.
vPI1hVGUaa	Everyone's bodies are different. The best way to find out is to stop for a couple of weeks and analyze your energy levels yourself. <br>  <br>  In regards to reducing fatigue, there are a few things you need to pay attention to.<br>  1) Diet<br>  2) Sleep (Get at least 8 hours)<br>  3) Exercises<br>  <br>  Here are a few tips:<br>  <br>  - Have low calorie food. Avoid fast food that has high fat content.<br>  <br>  - Minimize the consumption of sweet stuff. Try not to have candy, cake or ice cream. Those are the source of your energy depletion mechanism. Once you can omit those sweets, you will gain back a lot of your energy during the day.<br>  <br>  - Have a lot of high fiber food include fresh vegetables. High fiber product will improve your absorption of nutrition and reduce your blood cholesterol level. Your digestion and excretion systems will significantly improve with high fiber food.<br>  <br>  - Have enough water. Water can come from the fresh water you drink and from your food. You should have high water content food for example some of the fruits and vegetables. Water melon or cantaloupe can be a good example of such fruits. In addition, we need to drink at least two liters of fresh water daily. This means eight glasses of water at least per day.|`|G89gKKfHaa	I really don't think so...masturbation entails ejaculation, that's basically the point, well that and pleasure. If you want to reduce fatigue, cardio fitness helps a lot and anaerobic exercise (running, speed walking, etc.)<br>  And of course exercise and a healthy diet|`|SKBLAqFtaa	me personally; Masturbation affects me by making me feel more fatigued. I think it depends on the person because everyone is different. Either way, the best way to reduce fatigue is by consuming LOTS of water, eating a good amount of fruits and vegetables, and getting no more than 8 hours of sleep.Sometimes TOO much sleep can actually ,make you feel fatigue,<br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|qHsP55E7aa	Actually, masturbation without ejaculation can cause some serious health issues relating to the testes in which later in life, you won't be able to ejaculate at all if you continue with your "exercise".  It does not necessarily help you feel more energized, either.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Anxieties and phobias can develop out of the blue sometimes- something will generally trigger it off. If this through process continues then you will need to seek therapy in the form of CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), CBT has a 70% success rate in curing phobias. <br>  <br>  I went through similar when I had a severe allergic reaction to peanuts- for weeks and months afterwards I was paranoid about every single thing I put in my mouth- fearing my throat would swell and I wouldn't be able to breathe. Fear of choking is actually a common phobia. <br>  <br>  If things are becoming a problem, see your GP.|`|9f8XoDKJaa	liquidize all your food|`|1qKTC3YFaa	don't worry im sure the fear will go away, i mean look how many times a human being eats in one day, it will be something you will get used to and forget ;]|`|0TB9GwZ4aa	Try playing some music while eating to keep you distracted and after a while you might completely forget about it.|`|lz6vt0ofaa	try chewing your food and not inhaling.|`|ANRTDInTaa	lol.you wont choke i promise|`|0e3127e9ecee43459523cb403e3185ebaa	Scoop small portions at a time.  Chew slowly. Don't THINK about it.   Good luck!
63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	Is this a lesion on the her spinal cord? Is patient on a morphine drip.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	For relief, see a doctor to find out what is wrong with you.|`|IKakoOfyaa	When posting test results, it's also important to post the ranges the laboratory that did the testing used as they can differ (what may be normal at one lab may be abnormal at another depending on which standards are applied).
KL1Y5FeHaa	It could be a blocked milk duct. Have you gone to the doctor to get it checked out. If not, make an appointment.|`|p3NsXo0baa	I have heaps of lumps since i gave birth 7 months ago. I never breastfed though.<br>  My doctor tells me mine are hormonal because they hurt and get swollen during my period.<br>  You should see your doctor, or wait until your 6 wek check up. You can also ask your babies health nurse, there not just for the babies, they can help us mums too.<br>  <br>  If you have a temperature, any hot spots on yor breasts or discharge it could be mastitis which needs antibiotics.<br>  For now, try massaging your breasts in a hot shower to help loosen up any milk ducts that may be clogged
IxzJ6SN5aa	I believe people who are prone to anxiety can get OCD. Anxiety and depression seem to run in families.|`|bjqjkDMHaa	Well...  Fool's guess: My mom has it, I have it.  Make sense?  I don't know that studies have proven anything about the genetic link(s) but it is common to run in families.  I don't think scientists honestly know much about it and its mechanics.  They have drugs which were designed to help, these drugs change the levels of seritonin and dopamine in the brain, and myself being a patient with OCD, I know these drugs help.  Words of a patient: I start out having horrible thoughts, these disturb me and distress me, I start therapy which doesn't work too well, then I start taking a drug for it, it makes the thoughts relent a little.  So if that makes any sense...it is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.  Whether or not that chemical imbalance is a mutation of some gene, well, I am not a neurologist or a geneticist.  But I know that my mom has had thoughts like this, she has OCD and depression, I seem to have "gotten" this from her.  But then she starts thinking: I was the source of her genes that caused this problem to start with...so we tend to try and ignore the genetic side because I don't want her to feel like that..its kind of the way OCD works, it comes up with the worst thing it can and sticks that in your brain forever.  So maybe it is random.  Sure.  In a way, the source doesn't matter, the fact that I am stuck with this anxiety disorder for my whole life is the fact that does matter.  Right now scientists are kind of more concerned with treating it than the direct source.  So nobody knows.  I say they are right to treat it first.|`|dT8tbGrLaa	No, it's Not herreditary
zD0V9nQraa	You will be asked back by a nurse.<br>  Your weight will be recorded.<br>  You will then be escorted to a exam room and your blood pressure and temperature will be taken.<br>  The nurse may ask personal medical questions and go over any health concerns you may have.<br>  You will then be asked to undress removing all articles of clothing including bra and panties . The nurse will offer you a gown and a sheet. Once you are dressed in the gown you may be seated on exam table and place the sheet on your lap to help you feel not so vunerable.<br>  The nurse willleave the room letting you know the doctor will be in soon.<br>  When the Doctor returns he will greet you and introduce him/herself.<br>  A nurse will be in the room during the exam. He or she will ask you to you what brings you in today? you will discuss any concerns you may have and answer any questions you may have.<br>  After the answering of your questions you will be asked to lie back. The doctor will perform a breast exam which consists of you lying on the table with arms above your head. Your breasts will be examined for any unusual lumps, or soreness.<br>  The doctor will then feel around your abdomen. After checking your abdomen you will be asked to scoot your bottom to the end of the table and place your feet in the stirups. You will be asked to allow your legs to fall to the sides with your feet remaining in the stirrups.<br>  At this time the doctor will examine the outer genital area. Dont worry the nurse will be present. Your doctor will then lubricate a speculum and slowly insert it into your vagina. The speculum is used to open the vaginal walls to help gain visibility inside the vagina. The Doctor will then open the speculum and adjust the light so that it provides adequate lighting inside the vagina. The Doctor will then use a swab to gather some cells from your cervix. These cells will be sent to the lab for testing. The speculum will then be removed.The Doctor will then lubricate the fingers on their glove and insert one or two fingers inside the vagina while using the hand outside pressing down above the pelvic bone. This portion of the exam is now complete.<br>  Some Doctors may choose to do a rectal exam which consists of inserting one finger inside your rectum to feel for hemmoroids or other abnormalities.<br>  At this time you will be asked if you have any questions and given a tissue to wipe off any excess lubricant used during exam.<br>  The Doctor will then leave the room allowing you to get dressed. He will reenter room once you are dressed to provide you with information concerning recieving your pap smear results and give you any prescriptions he or she may be prescribing.|`|a32a57e50083185fc6a8990c0dfd03adaa	If this is your first visit, the gyneae may ask oou several questions to get your reproduction system history like:<br>  1. how old were you when you get your first period<br>  2. your menstruation cycle<br>  3. your last menstruation<br>  4. your sexual activities (you may be surprised to know that there are several different meaning for the word "virgin")<br>  5. depends in the indications, he/she may ask you about your family health histrory too (mother,sister, aunt, grandmother, etc).<br>  6. if you are taking / took special medicines / drugs, it maybe useful to inform the gyneae too...because some medicines may affect reproduction system, even long after you stopped taking them.<br>  <br>  depends on the gyneae early diagnosis, you may have to undergo some examinations. some can be done right away (e.g: USG scan), some have to be done in the laboratories.<br>  <br>  there's not much to say if you only tell the gyneae that you are virgin and havent had a period since November, because it could be anything.<br>  You may be pregnant (remember, what you mean by "virgin" may be different with what it means in medical term)<br>  You may have some disease(s)<br>  You may have hormonal unstability due to drugs/medication you are taking, overstressed, overworked, malnutrition, etc.<br>  <br>  Just tell the gyneae the truth, and anything else that maybe related.<br>  Hope this will help.<br>  <br>  may God bless you|`|9xClnnFvaa	a rectal vaginal exam.<br>  A breast exam<br>  a pap smear<br>  And many questions asked|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	They will most likely ask you some questions about your period, if you are sexually active and then do a papsmear. It only takes a few minutes. Because you are a virgin, and if your hymen is still intact then they may use a small stick to be able to insert the prongs. They will also do a pelvic exam which involves having 2 fingers inserted and they feel on the inside and the outside at the same time. <br>  I have been several times and never had a rectal exam....<br>  I have had a breast exam and the papsmear too though.
pCbzhOrkaa	i have short term memory loss and out of 5 words i usually can only remember 3 or 4. I have working memory problems, which isnt very rare. You can google working memory and see if it fits for you|`|CjJKUMl8aa	Are you suffering from insomnia???  Wake up very groggy and grumpy???
zyKQPLqQaa	I had pain in my legs a few years ago and someone told me it was because I needed to leave the situation I was in. I did leave and the paid went away.  Sometimes your body is telling you things subconsciously when you don't want to deal with the situation. You mentioned anxiety due to your relationship. You need to do whatever it takes to be happy. If you are not happy you are affecting the people around you, especially your child. Take a good look at your situation and make a decision to make it work or leave, whatever is the best result for all concerned. Most dis-ease is caused by stress. <br>  <br>  Listen to some relaxation audios that you can get free on YouTube. Just search for relaxation. While you relax, think about what will make you happy. I like Brad Yates who uses EFT. Whenever I have pain it goes away within minutes with EFT. You will notice that you say "I love and accept myself" using EFT.  You must love and accept yourself first. Forgive yourself for anything you think you shouldn't have done. <br>  <br>  Find out what you really want and what will make YOU happy - then do it. Don't listen to anyone telling you what you SHOULD do--don't should on yourself. Nobody knows what is the best for you or what will make you happy except yourself. You are very young and have many years ahead of you. Make them happy ones for your child as well as for yourself.
zWRJVJdOaa	Ewwwww!!!!|`|BhrT5Sagaa	yes..definitely. its too big to be a normal pimple. u got to squeeze the pus out. its harmful. go see a doc immediately. he might give u cream or medicine like anti biotics. to let it heal faster as he might poke or cut a hole to drain the pus. get well soon.|`|l1UwQRBTaa	Appart from the fact thats not real, If anyone had that they wouldnt NEED to ask about seeing a doctor, it would probably have killed them!<br>  <br>  Looks like he would be more pimple that neck! Might eat him if he isnt careful!|`|0gSuxiQOaa	He is not yr brother, please...|`|20RWDIvjaa	whoa is that real??? if so he should definently go see a doctor|`|OVUkamlpaa	Wow, that is bigger than your boobs. And sexier, too.|`|pXPdO2I8aa	That looks like a typical boil that's just about to burst.<br>  A nice warm kaolin poultice applied 2x daily till it has completely drained should do the trick.<br>  Kaolin poultice can be bought from any chemist--in a jar or tin.<br>  Follow directions on container.
dcKUZCnOaa	I was sterilised 15yrs ago, i had already had one ovary removed due to a cyst, but i had a clip on the remaining one. I had it done on the NHS and i was not given a choice of how i was sterilised, they just told me how it would be done. <br>  I have never had any side effects from this procedure. It is a big decision to make though, and you must be 100% sure you will not want children in the future.<br>  Yes it is possible for women to become pregnant after sterilisation, No contraceptive is 100% safe, but the chances of this happening are very slight.<br>  Hope this helps:):)|`|AvD96i9eaa	there is no complication, better remove your tube, because that is the safety one. and you can't get pregnant. if you get pregnant the baby can't go to your uterine, and make a lot of bleeding in your pelvic.
vTfEYeKQaa	I workout at Curves...it's about 40 bucks per month, and it's just for women. It helps to lose weight, and tone up. You're not working out with weights, it's all resistance machines. It really does work. I've not lost any weight, but have lost 3.25 inches with only 11 workouts. They recommend at least 3 times a week, and it's only 30 minutes long. You can go to your local Curves and they'll show you how to use each machine to see if you actually like it before you commit to anything. I stay motivated because the monthly payment is automatically taken out of my account every month...I think "I'm paying for it, so I might as well use it." Get a buddy, it helps (even if  you don't workout at Curves!)|`|01WTU3gVaa	Find a sport or physical activity you actually enjoy. That will be much easier than trying to force yourself to "workout". Try racquet ball, you don't have to be good to enjoy the sport, and it's a great workout.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	You sound like me, I lose weight alot too, i guess just force yourself to do it?|`|zzHNHd4daa	write up a goal sheet for when you go to the gym and for overall.  so, for example, you go to the gym you have yourself do 500 situps, 20 pushups, 10 bicep curls, 10 tricep extentions, stationary bike 5 miles (or a time like 2 hours), etc. whatever muscle group you want to exercize. and make sure you do all those things. and then set a goal to reach at the end of a period. like, do that for 8 weeks and then have a weight youd like to be at or something..|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Its always easier to work out with a buddy!|`|i7Nb169Taa	have you tried hyponoese ?

yvQpQjv1aa	hello sorry to hear that. a good friend of mine had a pap test come back abnormal. after further testing it was found that if not watched she could possibly get cervical cancer in 10 years or so. but since they know, she now gets more regular check ups and as long as she listens to the doctors she will be fine. i hope you will be ok aswell. good luck to you:)|`|8PDzaAJcaa	Abnormal paps happen from time to time especially if you are young, I wouldn't worry about it until you have to.|`|AA10988719	so, what is your doctor going to do?  did he/she say hold off and repeat the test or do you have to go in for a biopsy?  some STDs can stay dormant in your body and surface much later than the initial exposure.  you can check out some articles on STDs and see if you are exhibiting any symptoms.  I included a link, but you can probably do a google search and find more.  Also, I included a link regarding abnormal pap smears.  I would go about life as usual, get it checked out and hope it is nothing serious|`|A1S4X0DJaa	I'm sorry to hear this. It could be HPV, cancer or indeed nothing, only time will tell, not anyone on here. x
S71MT9USaa	The only related warnings I can find are:<br>  #1) Not to combine the use of Curcumin (the main active cancer-fighting compound in Turmeric) with the chemotherapy drug Camptosar (irinotecan) because of one animal study that indicated a possible adverse effect. <br>  #2) Not to take more than 15 mg total Bioprene (piperine) if used as enhancement with the Curcumin - which is effective, however should be used only with physician supervision since it may increase blood levels of prescription medications. . .and is counter-indicated if you have a biliary tract obstruction. Also do not take with anticancer drugs.<br>  #3) High doses of Curcumin taken on an empty stomach may cause stomach ulcers.<br>  #4) "Thiol" nutrients such as cysteine, lipoic acid, SAMe, and glutathione might interfere with curcumin's effects - (lower it's efficiency).<br>  <br>  Most cancer patients take between 1800 to 3600 mg a day of curcumin.<br>  <br>  More detailed information given at link below including source references for all statements in article.|`|LrBYeb6Aaa	i dont know of any side effects, i use it everyday in cooking and alot of people use it for the skin, and for colds aswell|`|aCDWwsisaa	There are no "health side effects" from using tumeric, neither are there any measurable health benefits.  Over a billion people in India use tumeric in their food almost every day, and they still get colon cancer (though at lower rates, likely attributable to the lower percentage of red meat in the typical diet)...|`|abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	Turmeric is considered a safe herb. However, prolong use of higher than recommended doses can cause stomach upset and other gastrointestinal disturbances. <br>  <br>  However, a typical adult dosage as a stand-alone supplement is 400 to 600 of curcumin a day. People with congestive heart disease whose cause remains unidentified and People with painful gallstones, obstructive jaundice, acute bilious colic, or extremely toxic liver disorders, should avoid Turmeric.
e6jrBORRaa	I had the same thing.  Your body produces a hormone called relaxin that is making your joints loosen as they get ready for the huge load you are about to carry.  It's normal.  I couldn't really get rid of it, and I think I made it worse when I tried walking.  <br>  <br>  Still, definitely talk to your doctor about it just to be sure everything is okay and there is nothing else going on.<br>  <br>  It won't last forever.  Just keep telling yourself that.  You'll have a beautiful little miracle at the end of your ordeals.  :-)  Congratulations!|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	Yes it is normal. I have heard that doing stretching before bed really helps. As well as hot baths and heat packs. You could also try getting a maternity belt, it helps with the pressure especially while walking throughout the day.

Best to report it to your doctor and see how he/she wants to proceed.|`|t5T8urrtaa	Sleep Apnea<br>  My sister had it for a couple years because she thought it was panic attacks so she didn't think anything of it..she decided to go to the doctors and he gave her medicine for it and she hasn't had it since..its been like 2-3 years since she had it|`|oGSmGgJbaa	...:(|`|estIQEVNaa	Sleep apnea.

l1QzfK8uaa	No you're doing it right. You just need to strengthen your lower back. The key to getting abs is working your back muscles as well. Try flutter kicks. They're beast mode. Sorry no one has responded to your question they only like answering questions about penis's it seems. LOL. Flutter Kicks and Swimming are the two best lower abs excersises. Swimming is not actual swimming. Hard to explain. Google :Swim move ab excercise.. Good luck man.
yGWoxnDXaa	Hi i have the same kinda problem as you, when i go running there are always builders that start staring and whistling arghh i hate men like that!! Anyway, that is definately enough to be a healthy fitness, seeing as you do pilates as well. A lot of people do no exercise at all!<br>  Keep up the good work :)<br>  Oh and the carbs don't matter that much tbh, as long as you eat healthy-ish and exercise.|`|JIVRSm08aa	Actually, you don't have to diet as such to lose weight, the only method that definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials left, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I lost 30 pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	I do the same amount of jogging but every day and this is enough for me to maintain a stable, healthy weight. Pilates is excellent too. And you're right about the carbs. Sounds like you've got it all sorted to me. Well done.
znjl6WrWaa	"just out of curiosity...how tall are you?"|`|uqKpjV6qaa	Oh all you do is take a measuring tape and ask them to stand up against the wall. Measure them with your handy dandy measuring tape and voila! You have their height. It's not weird at all.<br>  <br>  Haha. I was just kidding. If you know them you could start of by talking about something that involves height (basketball or reaching the cookie jar) and tell them your height first. Then ask what their height is. Good luck!|`|2Z4G7aXZaa	Just be casual and go up to them<br>  "Hey, Name, how tall are you?"|`|0IhCFeXLaa	check their myspace|`|1x8UI9vcaa	Just go to that person and say, hey, What an impressive height, how tall r u? like that! believe me, he wont mind but will tell u happily:D its nt rude to ask someone's height:dont be ridiculous!!!|`|hN3k3ggSaa	Hey Tower boy, how tall are ya, and are you in proportion "everywhere"?|`|vucMO9Glaa	Just ask them.  It's not like asking a lady her age or weight.|`|UVncUmpNaa	just go up to them and be like hey how tall are you. lol that's what i would do.|`|AA12050428	Well why can't you just say straight out I am curious to know what height you are?
PyQhb7gCaa	Well, I am still figuring it out for myself too .. I think jump more ..|`|MMmv06Ynaa	haha I am short too, but I have found that over time you will slowly grow.

Jet2E58aaa	Have the doctor check her out for piles (haemorrhoids) - common in older people. There are creams which treat this.
9pLdhuBnaa	There are things that a doctor can do.  I would recommend a consultation with a gynecologist as well to see what they think could be going on.  Surgery can be an option for dealing with this but they also may have non-surgical options that can be of benefit.<br>  <br>  I am also including the link to a site that may help you find more information.

8OqdoIHtaa	Its very possible that she had some sauce on her hands where the test was done, which contaminated the test. Try testing her blood sugar in the morning when she has fasted overnight. Wash and dry her hands first. Test. <br>  <br>  Then give her breakfast, a normal breakfast with either toast or cereal in it so she has some carbs. Test her 1 hour after she starts eating and again 2 hours after she started her meal. <br>  <br>  Her fasting blood sugar should be between 4.0 and 6.0<br>  <br>  At one hour after a meal it should be under 8.0, at two hours out it should be below 6.0. <br>  <br>  If any of these readings are high, she should be tested for diabetes. Along with a fasting glucose, or Random Glucose,  or Glucose Tolerance Test, (the doctor might order any of these), you should also ask for an HbA1c, which will give her average blood glucose over the last 3 months. <br>  <br>  Her blood sugar went down fast, but the other symptoms do sound like diabetes, so I think you really need to get her checked out by a doctor and get the HbA1c and any other tests the doctor thinks are needed.|`|Z4PArYfTaa	i would have asked the doc when at hospital that is what they are there for|`|3hwcIHFuaa	is there msg in tomato sauce? these symptoms sound like what happened to my grampy and it was msg in potato crisps. i'm presuming it is potato fries she ate? not crisps so i'm wondering about the sauce.|`|ztzL7ntwaa	The fever is causing the convulsions. She may have juvenile diabetes. High sugar can cause her to go into a coma. Check with your doctor immediately.|`|6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	Okay ... since I'm american I had to get a converter to change all of your numbers, and now I understand.  Your child is not running a fever.  <br>  <br>  But you said her blood sugar was very high.  I don't think it really was.  What I find weird is that it would be so high at home, but then just go down to normal within an hour at the hospital.  Diabetics do not go from that high of a number down to a normal post-meal number in an hour without some help.  It seems to me when you took her blood sugar at home the sample was contaminated somehow.  You didn't get all the sugar off her hands before you tested her.  <br>  <br>  And you didn't say that she actually had convulsions.  Did she?  She didn't have a temperature, and apparently she didn't have high blood sugar, so if she did it wouldn't have anything to do with those two things anyway.<br>  <br>  And if she got pale, with red eyes and black rings ... I'm thinking it's because it's 10pm and she's still up.  Do you think she might have been tired?|`|iK3YYRaTaa	Your best bet would be to do a fasting test on her. But if test you gave her was done right , which would be a random test she is surely diabetic. High sugar could cause convulsions. I would check her often, because something is defenitely wrong. Because a small child like that could die from going high to very low glucose levels. <br>  <br>  Also try testing her after you give her all the things that have high carbs  and then test her 2 hours later. <br>  What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels<br>  <br>  <br>  There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes. <br>  <br>  Fasting Blood Sugar Test:<br>  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test. <br>  <br>  Random Blood Glucose Test:<br>  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes. <br>  <br>  Oral glucose tolerance test<br>  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus. <br>  <br>  Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test<br>  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes. <br>  <br>  Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have. <br>  <br>  Good luck my friend

820fcc25e1d405c3b1bd1d47e46df2b2aa	I'm afraid that if guys think that you're up to it, then that's all they will respect, especially if you meet them in a club. I don't know anyone who's met a future partner in a club. They are great places to have a snog or more, but people don't go there to find much more than a bit of fun. <br>  <br>  Trust me, you are not alone, at 17 I went through similar feelings, I really wanted a boyfriend, made stupid mistakes. I've learnt since that it's more important to have good friends and try and learn (study), so you have more options in life. When I was your age, I found it harder to get on with my Mum, and it basically came down to the fact that she was worried about me, and didn't want to see me do things I'd regret. <br>  <br>  What do you enjoy doing (when you're not drunk)? Do you have friends you can spend time with? Confidence is not something that is instant. I'm not very confident, and am quite an introvert when I meet new people, but over the years I've built up good friendships, which have helped to make me feel more confident, and work towards being less introverted. <br>  <br>  How can you change? Stop getting drunk and doing things you wouldn't do when sober. You need to find out things to do sober. Find people you enjoy spending time with, who you have laugh with. With sober eyes you will be able to tell the difference between the boys and the men. Get to know men as friends, meet friends of friends, if they are idiots don't get involved.|`|2eW4z4Hmaa	the best info is from here

0BeWgkpkaa	sounds like an eating disorder to me! go see your doctor!
5rJ6nf2oaa	It depends on your own body's ability to handle certain foods. With many people it is caused by eating wheat based products like bread and pasta, or dairy foods. However anything that causes gas for you is obviously something to avoid. Also avoid salty food since this will make your body retain water. That's my suggestion for tonight.<br>  <br>  If you really do experience bloating every day it sounds like your liver is on overload and needs to be cleansed. You will need to change your diet to achieve this. Buying products to do it is not necessary and potentially harmful. If you do a proper 8 week liver cleanse you will find that you don't bloat during the day anymore. It requires that you stop eating red meat, animal fats, dairy and processed food for the 8 weeks, and replace it with any seafood, some chicken, vegetables, fruit, even bread, pasta and rice. It's a weel known diet and it works for me every time.<br>  <br>  Read the articles below if you want to understand more about it, and they include my own diet as an example. Hope you like it.|`|YXgVGjHlaa	Fatty foods and sweets make you bloat more.  Eat a balanced diet during the day with fruit instead of sweets and bread.  Drink plenty of water during the day.

6d7m0kWWaa	Yes, it is just "anger", but it may be due to a combination of factors.  I often experience surges of anger that seem completely disproportional to the cause (even while I'm angry).  I've found that they always occur when I miss a meal and have low blood sugar.  Other people I know have anger caused by tyramines (link in sources).  It could also be caused by something psychological.  <br>  I've found that hitting the wall / banging things doesn't help (which is not to say that I never do it).  Try sitting down and feeling your pulse (I feel mine at my wrist, much easier), try to slow your heart beat down.  The combination of concentrating on something else and making calmness a goal might help.<br>  Again, see if you might have any dietary triggers.  This is quite likely if you also have panic attacks.  The three people I know who have panic attacks and random outbursts of anger (myself and two others) have dietary triggers: sugars and tyramines.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	no it's not a disease. it's called anger. try some anger management classes to help you control your self. most kids out grow the banging the head on the wall around the age of 5 or so. without knowing it, you also may be looking for attention. good luck

IKakoOfyaa	Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain or inflammation.  Your doctor is probably trying conservative treatment and then will check your response.

I am sure there are more!)|`|9GmoO5NLaa	I used to work myself up when I was scared or angry and have panic attacks, however this has not happened to me since I was 11 (I'm 22 now).<br>  <br>  I have never heard of panic disorder, however I would not look to deeply into it.  Sometimes when you watch a documentary like that you immediatly think you have the problem they are talking about.  One weekend I had diabetes, ADD and I was pregnant.  It was a hard weekend.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|bjqjkDMHaa	Well...I don't know how common it is, nor do I know exactly what a panic attack feels like...but I do have certain moments when I freak out for no apparent reason except one that is apparent to myself.  I have pretty bad OCD, and sometimes I have a thought come and sort of bite me and I freak out which results in looking like a seizure because  I have Tourette's as well which gets a lot worse when I am stressed, so I sort of have these moments when it feels and looks like something is very wrong with me.  So I don't know much about the terminology, but yeah,  I have something that is relatively similar.  PS: I am fourteen.

Aguanta! total, los resultados valdran la pena) llenas el envase de la licuadora hasta la mitad y echas el pepino (CON TODO Y CASCARA!) en cuadros grandes (para que no se atasque la licuadora) y lo dejas licuar bien, muy bien, luego cuelas la bebida (pues el bagaso es horrible en la garganta, aunque muy bueno, si deseas lo puedes tomar con todo y bagaso) y te lo tomas, luego de media hora desayunas.<br>  <br>  Para limpiar tu rostro puedes hacerlo con un jabon antibaterial y puedes aplicarte mascarillas de miel y avena, son muy buenas, recuerda hacer un poco de dieta de grasas o por lo menos evitarlas lo mas que puedas.<br>  <br>  Este tratamiento es muy, pero muy bueno, veras resultados en la primera semana, pero aun asi continua haciendolo por un par de meses hasta que veas tu rostro bien limpio, no solo te servira para eliminar el acne, sino que tambien te pondra bella la piel, las u?as y el cabello.

0a7a0027e0ce28f6f9d73ee5c3610710aa	You have not asked a clear cut question,whether you have ovulated,will you conceive or some thing else ?As per my interpretation,I can only try to clear the concept.The process of the rupture of matured graafian follicle is called ovulation.It occures between 13th.- 17th.day( average 14th.) of the menstruation cycle of 28 days.The ovum is carried along the fallopian tube.If the sperm is present,fertilisation of ovum takes place and then it is carried into the uterus where it is embedded and pregnancy begins.In the absence of sperm the ovum dies and is passed out in the menstrual discharge.The best chance of pregnancy lies in the third week and the least chance in the first week of the menstrual cycle.In surgically induced ovulation,adhesions develop around the ovary and fallopian tube due to surgery.Hence the woman may ovulate but has difficulty in becoming pregnant due to these adhesions.
pRF5LLloaa	For stem cells to work, the disease must be a "systemic" disease, with a strong genetic component -- like leukemia.<br>  <br>  Disease that come from the OUTSIDE (like colds and flu) are not easily treated with stem cells. Diseases caused by environmental factor (like smoking or chewing tobacco) are not usually affected by stem cells.<br>  <br>  Healing might be helped, like using stem cells to grow new muscles or bones or nerves.<br>  <br>  In ALL cases, stem cell therapy is in its infancy.  There are very few disease where stem cells are KNOWN to help.  Scientists are STILL experimenting.<br>  <br>  But there is one thing to note -- out of all the successes that have occurred, they have ALL occurred using ADULT stem cells.  No disease - not even one -- has been even slightly affected using fetal stem cells.  There is no reason to kill babies to get stem cells, when the stem cells from adults works the best!|`|c6e07d38fd442ff6cea962c40f738d09aa	Stem cells are meant to create 'broken' or problem genes so are really only good for genetic fixes. They are also able to help in cell regrowth, for example torn ligaments and tendons.<br>  <br>  They are not good are non-cellular problems. You have already identified the common cold but they will also not cure 'flu, chicken pox, measles and the like because these are not illnesses that are based on problems with your cells, they are more like an infection.<br>  <br>  So, stem cells will replace broken or missing cells, but won't fix problems that are on-going or not at the cellular level.<br>  <br>  When it comes to Type 1 diabetes I have no idea if stem cells will resolve the issue. The islets of Langerhans in a type 1 diabetic are destroyed by the boy's immunosupression system, which causes diabetes. The question here is: If I were injected with stem cells that could be made to produce new islets, would those be destroyed as well?<br>  <br>  To this I don't have an answer, but it's very interesting research.|`|9ed44342f109934ea75c69a84a787cc5aa	<a href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/" rel="nofollow">http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/</a> is an interesting website with answers to some of your questions.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Stem cell research is still in its infancy, researchers don't know what they can or can not cure yet.

l1UwQRBTaa	drinking more water does flush out toxins, also maybe ask your doctor about dianette, its a pill for contraception that prevents acne|`|Bt7eyuM1aa	Yeah, drinking more water can help, don't drink enough to make you light headed and don't drink tap water because the fluoride and chlorine can cause health problems once ingested, but clear bottled water or fruit flavored water that doesn't have harmful ingredients would really help.<br>  <br>  In general, there may be little you can do, but there are a lot of little things you can do that could help. Taking an antihistamine for example could cause a bit more bleeding if it thins the blood, but it would also reduce the acne problem without irritating the skin.<br>  <br>  Anyway Janmay's advice is sound advice.

Getting up early is sooooo hard. I understand.  I get up at 4 a.m. with my husband to go to the gym. Just knowing and seeing the results make it all worth it. Oh, by the way, it will take about two weeks to get used to getting up early. It's rare to hear such a young person think the way that you think. I wish my daughter thought like that.  Best of luck to you. Sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders.
q1CiUd0Laa	look up refractory period mate, theres nothing wrong at all.
ApFWLsELaa	1. the scale lies, especially when you're exercising (muscle weighs more than fat, when you start exercising regularly you will probably gain weight while loosing fat & gaining muscle)<br>  *this is good because when you are at rest, muscle burns more calories than fat. gaining lean muscle mass will aid you in burning fat & extra calories*<br>  <br>  2. you have to eat enough to sustain your training, but not more than you expend. If you don't eat enough & expend WAY too much energy in the same day, your metabolism will slow & your body will go into starvation mode. I notice you don't have a lot of protein in your diet, and it's also important to take in enough omega3 fatty acids (as fish or in supplements) as this will help your body function on a whole by supporting your nervous system function. <br>  <br>  3. the best indicators for success is not a scale, but measuring tape, or how you feel/look.<br>  <br>  4. It may take you a couple weeks to see results in the mirror, but you should feel healthier within days.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pediatrics.about.com/od/nutrition/a/06_protein_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.about.com/od/nutrition...</a><br>  <br>      * Milk<br>      * Soy Milk<br>      * Eggs<br>      * Cheese<br>      * Yogurt<br>      * Peanut Butter<br>      * Lean Meats, Fish, and Poultry<br>      * Beans, Tofu, Lentils, and other Legumes<br>      * Grains, including bread and pasta<br>      * Nuts and Seeds <br>  <br>  since milk products, meats & even nuts can be fatty you have to make sure and stick to lean cuts & white meat vs dark.

It's also about making an actual lifestyle change, not just losing 3-4 pounds and that's it. <br>  So what you are doing is good but you could improve if you want more dramatic results.<br>  I also want to let you know that muscle is heavier than fat and when you do start exercising because you're losing fat and toning up you could weigh the same (if not more) because you're fat has turned in to muscle. <br>  Now, with you're exercising, it depends what you want to achieve. <br>  The amount of exercise that you're doing is good but I will give you a few pointers:<br>  bike works out quads (thighs) so if you want to make your thighs bigger looking then do bike, if you want to lean out your legs I would suggest upping the jogging to running, and increase the time to 30mins. <br>  Taebo is fabulous, as it works out your whole body and is a fantastic cardio workout but again probably not enough, so try to double it to 40mins. <br>  With eating :<br>  make sure whenever you eat pasta you eat it before 3pm; rule of thumb generally is carbs before 3, protein after 3pm and don't eat after 7pm. <br>  Ceasar dressing is fattening (just to let you know-but if that's the only fatty thing you're having then that's fine) <br>  You need to up your fruit intake, an apple and banana a day is good. <br>  I don't actually see good consistent food on the list apart from the pasta ? Meat, vegies ? <br>  You need to drink 2 ltrs of water a day to flush out your toxins and fat cells too! <br>  <br>  If you have any other q's ask away as I'm a personal trainer. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|SwP3tE2Uaa	Your exercises are great, but your diet is neither healthy nor satisfying.<br>  <br>  Try these<br>  1) Eat 5 to 6 times a day.<br>  2) Eat lots of veggies, lean meat and complex carbs<br>  (low carb, low fat, high fibre, high protein.)  Lean meat is high protein.<br>  3) Reduce sugar intake and simple carbs. They make <br>  you hungry fast.Cut junk food .<br>  4) Take 2 to 3 cups of low fat milk, cheese, yoghurt.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am on low carb, low fat, high fibre, high protein and an hour brisk walk every weekday morning.<br>  And I am still at 108 lbs since I lost 31 lbs one year ago.<br>  <br>  More details in my blog. <br>  <a href="http://lowcarblowfathighfibrehighprotein.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://lowcarblowfathighfibrehighprotein...</a>|`|94Ti4bHtaa	Cut out the caesar dressing and pasta. Try some healthy fruits and veggies or low cal snacks. Eat a lot more protein. Forget taebo and biking. Just hit the treadmill and jog as much as you can until you can do more every time. Even if it's a couple minutes extra every time, you will burn the most calories jogging. What you eat shouldn't taste amazing and you will notice that giving up certain foods is half the battle. Depending on your weight, you should lose more than a pound in a week. If you want to lose it fast, you must have high intensity workouts.

d1635a6d45e75c9ca22fb8ffbeb1e891aa	I worked In a Dr. office and hospital. You should use peroxide to kill the germs, that will help to dry it up also.Do that 2 times a day. Some dumb Dr's. might tell you not to, but it will kill germs fast and help it to heal faster. Then during the day you need to let it get some air and sun light. Also take at least 2000 milligrams of vitamin C everyday! That is natures natural antibiotic. You CAN NOT take too much vit C because your body gets rid of so fast.

681671b8db63cde85f65759dcf0f542caa	Diet and smart exercise are more important than the supplements you are currently taking. Make sure to drink plenty of water and get plenty of rest. Take the necessary steps to avoid over-training. Then follow the directions on the bottle and make sure not to exceed the recommended dosage. Finally, it is always good to "off cycle" to clean your body out and allow your system to recalibrate.
4EHYN6TKaa	judging by your remarks, chances are your about 16 and didnt think to have your bloodwork checked to see if your kidneys were healthy enough to handle all that protein and creatine.  kidneys alone filter both substances and elevated creatinine (the waste product of creatine) can be toxic to the kidneys.  anyways, I assume you lift weights, which can elevate testosterone levels.  this can lead to more acne.  Also, dermatologists now believe that acne is more bacteria related then sebum (skin oil) related.  A topical antibiotic like clindamycin, could solve your problems.  clindamycin is a perscription tho.

Also drink mineral water when not eating and chew sugar free gum. The no eating method is faster especially if you do sit ups or walk. You will lose 10 lbs in 10 days or less.

eDKSKqcSaa	I think you have decided to see a doctor which is good if you think you are depressed. But meanwhile try spending time doing things that can lift your mood naturally. Eat well, exercise - do fun things that dont cost much. Its a new relationship but it might work out once you are feeling a bit better. However, friends are going to be more useful to you just now I think. Have plenty of 'you' time and be honest with him about how you feel. Its miserable to feel lonely and down and the last thing you feel you can cope with it a breakup.. so dont do it now, just focus on other things. But dont stick with someone who isnt treating you right just because you dont want to be alone - Mr Amazing might be around the corner and you want to be happy, healthy and SINGLE just in case he is. :) Good luck and take good care of yourself x|`|hmsMpECkaa	Yeah, I'd be depressed and in the dumps if I had to spend on somebody else when the money is mine and for me!

U4CLmiJWaa	Start out with very low weight to get the proper form down and then start adding weight.  You don't have to go all the way down, just have your thighs parallel to the floor.  It is OK if you lift your heels a little.  If your heels are always off the ground then that means your calves are tight.  Stretch them before you do squats.|`|9Z7oyqS9aa	you need to warm up and stretch thoroughly before u start the excercises...sounds like your hamstrings and calves are tight...|`|160be9e3f6f6116ca05de83376045ad4aa	You can't go below a 90 degree angle with your upper leg and lower leg. Your upper leg should be parallel to the floor. It just takes practice.
AA11096432	yes, try the super dieters tea, u may just need to be cleaned out|`|O6DbXWGqaa	you have to be more specific when you say you work out; what is it exactly that you are doing? also, it's not only about exercise but about what you eat also. ...So if you can be a little more specific...then I can give you all the advice you need.|`|e621352110a57cacddc7fc658846a82aaa	Try more cardio. Cardio is the workout that burns off the fat, weight training leans everything out and builds muscle. If you're doing more weight training, cut the weight training down (but not out) and do more cardio. Try doing the cardio in the morning, finishing one hour before you eat breakfast. This will help your metabolism kick up and burn more calories and fat. Also, eat more veggies and fruit than protein. What you want is to burn more calories than you intake, thus burning the fat.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)
O6DbXWGqaa	I don't want to slam you but I do want you to be aware of the facts before you go ahead with this diet. <br>  Being a personal trainer I can definitely say I don't agree with the fruit diet because there are nutrients that your body needs that fruit just simply doesn't have not to mention the lack of energy you will have and you will be very tired and lethargic. In saying that, being on a fruit diet for any more than 30days, you will simply starve your organs of what they really need and not only will you affect your stomach but your organs, your skin, your brain etc. So before you do go on this diet think whether it's really worth putting your body through all the stress, instead of a good diet of portion control, with exercise <br>  that will do your body wonders. <br>  <br>  The fruit diet as a form of detox.<br>  A 30 day all fruit diet will provide a benefit similar to juice fasting and is a great alternative. Eating a diet exclusively of fruit takes far more discipline and self-control than fasting. I have gone on many fasts but have yet been able to accomplish a lengthy diet of fruit. During fasting, your digestive system shuts down. Psychologically and spiritually you have become resolved not to eat. But an all fruit diet is very different in that your digestive system is fully active and you are still engaged in eating. For most of us who are accustomed to living on a highly, concentrated diet of meats and starches, fruit can often feel unsatisfying physically because our digestive system is producing large amounts of hydrochloric acid, resulting in a grumbly stomach for the first two or three days of a fruit diet. Also, physiologically, fruit does not give that heavy, full-belly feeling, and cravings can rise powerfully to the surface. <br>  <br>  Surprisingly, a fruit diet is lower in calories than juice fasting, hence resulting in a deeper detoxificaton. Due to the cleansing effect of fruit and reduction of calories, the tongue will become coated, breath, foul and you may experience times of weakness due to the release of toxins.<br>  <br>  Because the digestive system is still active, but you have drastically reduced caloric intake, for the first few days, you may experience intense hunger. Hunger is good! Face it with courage. Show who’s in control. <br>  <br>  In choosing fruit, try to eat melons and non-acid fruits. Too much citrus fruits will increase detoxification. At the start, fruit may cause diarrhea. In time, the body will grow accustomed to the fruit's cleansing properties.<br>  <br>  Those who wish to change over to a fruit diet will experience occasional weakness, or possibly even a cleansing crisis. Fruits are high in vitamin C, as well as citric acid, which is a powerful detoxifier. The absence of mucus-forming foods allows the lymph glands a chance to detoxify. Less digestive effort results in more cleansing time resulting in vibrant health and a need for less sleep. <br>  <br>   With Jay Robb's diet, I haven't done it but I know it's a 3 day fruit flush diet (which mainly gets rid of fluid retention in the body) and you can eat any fruit you want except frozen, canned and dried. <br>  Why don't you buy the book, it's only $5? <br>  Good Luck. <br>  <br>  If you actually want a lifestyle changing plan instead of a quick fix ...let me know.
O6DbXWGqaa	Magnesium has a lot of benefits, but it does depend what you want to take it for. <br>  Here are some of the benefits it can help with: <br>  1.it aids in the body’s absorption of calcium and also plays a key role in the strength and formation of bones and teeth. <br>  2. it helps stabilize the rhythm of the heart and helps prevent abnormal blood clotting in the heart. Magnesium also aids in maintaining healthy blood pressure levels.<br>  3. Magnesium also helps maintain proper muscle function. It works to keep muscles properly relaxed. Because of its benefits in relieving stiff muscles, magnesium can be especially beneficial to fibromyalgia patients.<br>  <br>  I personally take it every now and then to help relieve my muscles after I run...but you need to be careful that you don't over use this supplement. But amino acids are also fantastic for muscle recovery. <br>  <br>  Can I ask why you're thinking of taking it?

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	The reason you get carsick is because your brain is confused. You don't feel like you're moving, and yet all your senses are telling you that you are. In response, you feel disoriented and sick.<br>  <br>  I've found the best way to counteract this feeling is to look at the horizon. Look at something that's not moving, so your brain doesn't feel so confused. You can look at the sky, too - inspect the clouds. Just don't look at the road, or at the trees whizzing by. That's the opposite of what your brain wants.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can also take dramamine, a drug for motion sickness. It makes you drowsy, but will help you from getting sick. I believe you can buy those at Target or what have you, and don't need a prescription for it. It's just like Advil or Tylenol, from what I understand.<br>  <br>  You might just have to give up on reading in the car. Try listening to audio tapes instead, or find joy in taking naps - that always works! :)|`|wPXwC7Ufaa	I get car sick on normal roads, but I'm fine on the highway, perhaps because of the constant speed and lack of turns.  I remember when I was little I almost threw up in the car, so we pulled over at a shopping mall and my dad went in and bought a bag of lollipops, and I felt fine after having one.  Perhaps that will work for you.  Either that or do like the other person said and eat mints.  Or you could ask someone else in the car to read to you instead (provided there are more people in the car than you and the driver, which could be a road hazard).|`|P8sZHaAvaa	I know same here, i was reading a Bliss magazine in the car (Looking down at it) and i felt REALLY sick- i had to lie down! anyway,its because your nerves in your brain are confused and it makes you feel ill. <br>       It actually makes you feel worse reading on car trips-  if you really have to read Don't look down at your book- try and keep it in front of you.|`|icHv1UZQaa	Yeah this happens to me too.

gJcfmK2haa	I have had A LOT of styes in my life, they are horrible and painful little things! And it sounds like you do have a stye. If the stye is located on the edge of the lid by the eyelashes and you can see part of the actual stye, then it is a ton easier to get rid of than one located completely underneath the eyelid, then it will be much more difficult to get rid of. I have had many by my eye lashes and a couple completely hidden within my eye lid. Of the ones under my lid, one stopped getting infected and was reduced to the size of a grain of sand, which I can still feel today. But this one hasn't gotten infected in years so it is not a problem. The other one was a whole different story. It was awful! It got infected several times within a few months and was not showing any signs of going away on its own. So, I eventually had to have it surgically removed, not fun. But I have not had any issues with it since then. Let's hope this is not what happens to yours! I tried EVERYTHING when I had styes, from what doctors told me, what friends recommended, and even old home remedies. I found the most effective treatment to make one go away faster is to place about 1 cup of plain white rice (uncooked) in a clean sock and tie off the end. You then place it in the microwave until it is very warm, but not hot. You don't want to burn your eye! Test it for a quick second before placing it completely on your eye. The trick to using this method is not the length of time the hot-pack is on your eye, but how often. When my stye was bad I would do it 4 or 5 times a day for about 10-15 minutes each time. This worked much faster and stayed warmer MUCH longer that a cup of warm water and a washcloth, which a lot of people recommended so don't even bother trying that! Once the stye is gone (When I say the stye is "gone" I mean not inflamed. Ones on the edge by the lashes should go away completely, but ones completely under the lid usually leave a hard bump, which may or may not become inflamed again.), the rice hot-pack can be used to prevent the stye from coming back. I used to do it once a day at night when I went to bed, that seems to be the most convenient time. The warmth of the hot-pack will help to release the oils in the glands in your eye and clear up the stye, so don't be scared if you wake up and your eye is all goopy! That is actually good!  Other things you can do to prevent styes is to wash all make-up off before bed, don't eat greasy foods, try more naturally-made make-up, and try not to touch your eyes with your hands since the oils on your hands can get in your eye. I called the stye an "infection" before, but really it is not an infection and isn't something that can be passed from one person to another. It is pretty much like a zit on/in your in eye, gross I know! And if you used make-up while you had the stye using it after the stye will not cause you to get another one simply because it had been in contact with the stye. If the make-up is oily though, then it could be the cause of your stye. One last thing, be sure not to squeeze it or try to "pop" it as this can damage your eyelid and can cause the oils to get trapped in other pores and cause more styes. Let the oil get released naturally by using the hot-pack. As for the pain, there is really no way to get it to go away while the stye is inflamed. The pain will go away once it is healed. Sorry this is sooo long, but in all the years I had styes I coulnd't find ANY good information and it was so frustrating. So I don't want someone to go through the same thing! Good luck and I hope this helps!
p2Bp0DAKaa	fixing_my_heart88, I've been bleaching my teeth at home for a long time with noticable results. Try it yourself. <a href="http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Teeth-Whitening.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Teeth-W...</a>|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Do you drink a lot of coffee or tea?  That might be staining your teeth. <br>  <br>  Keep up with your teeth by brushing everyday twice, and using whitening toothpaste.|`|6026XWBgaa	how about you try brushing them, i heard that works|`|efa3a4f2facfb1fd057a71ddccbe4c1daa	the more you brush your teeth, it will wear away & make the dentin visible inside which is yellowish. Use mild tooth paste & soft tooth brush always. If you want white teeth, you need to go to a dentist & get professional whitening.|`|GqTSa85daa	Yeah, what all the above said, and if you smoke, stop.|`|P7mYy4CFaa	Brush them with baking soda|`|FRNDkLNqaa	use baking soda. but dont swallow it. just let it rest on the teeth evenly for an hour|`|yoJNAihhaa	In response to your additional details, it's important NOT to brush your teeth too much. Over brushing can lead to gum erosion and also damage your enamel.<br>  <br>  I would talk to your dentist to see what he or she recommends in terms of good whitening agents. I've heard before that most whiteners are temporary and that after a certain period of time your teeth will either return to their original color or get even darker that the original. I've heard for example, that if you use Rembrandt toothpaste, you shouldn't stop or your teeth will not keep their whiteness. <br>  <br>  So I don't think it's your fault that your teeth are going back to their original color, and I would try and talk to your dentist about what products and whitening methods cane help you most.|`|jewgQZGUaa	You can try whitening toothpastes. Though heavily advertised, these only partially whiten teeth and don't provide a complete remedy. Make sure the toothpaste has the American Dental Association (ADA) seal of approval and has been clinically proved to whiten teeth effectively.|`|gF0rJPSYaa	lol i brush my teeth and 2 mins later they are yellow again and i haven't touched them lol! Well you could just put some whitener on everyday but it might be very expensive!<br>  <br>  i recommend you brush Your teeth with camicle fluoride which you can get in toothpaste for whitening teeth and just brushiton for 2 mins everyday!|`|8lOjRnEJaa	Soda, coffee, and red wine can stain your teeth.

OkL3Whopaa	We have some ideas of good, healthy lunches on our web site at http://www.lunchtaker.com. We created the site to help inspire people to pack healthy lunches. It certainly helps us keep out of a rut. The serving sizes for each lunch idea are also in there, so you know how much is enough for fruit, for example.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	dried mango  celery and peanut butter  hummous and pita bread  fruit salad thats been chopped into little bits    And if you're worried if you're eating too much fruit, remember you should be having 5 a day. A serving can fit into your hand. So a handful of grapes or two kiwi fruit, or a handful of rasberries are all one serving each.|`|ojtINp2raa	Firstly, I commend you for taking the initiative to become a more active and healthy young adult. *applause*. :-)    Secondly...have you tried the following?    * flavored rice cakes by quaker. :-)  They're quite good.  * low-fat cottage cheese mixed with pineapple or peaches  * sliced bananas with natural orange juice poured over  * carrot sticks and raisins (yes at the same time, hehe)  * peanut butter is good for you in moderation** and it is quite nice on celery sticks  * Yogurt and all-natural granola (be careful when purchasing yogurt  though, and be sure to read the nutritional information, *many* yogurts out there on the shelves are just as bad as ice cream! lol  * Make yourself a milkshake without the ice cream!! Just place skim or low-fat milk in a high-quality blender, and add ice cubes, frozen peaches (or your fruit preference) and some Splenda...and blend until smooth and creamy....trust me it's good and filling.  * Drink *a lot* of water...     ***Update****    I *strongly* disagree with the above poster who said to make smoothies without the milk.  If you're a teenage female...you need the calcium and other nutrients milk provides. Especially for when you're an old fart like me!  If you *really* want to cut milk out altogether, discuss it with your doctor or nutritionist and see if they can recommend a good calcium replacement/calcium-enhanced vitamin that is appropriate for your age/weight/height.       Blessings,|`|Xwx8mUnYaa	fruit, veggies, fat-free stuff, and [though this might sound weird] bison burgers. meat from a bison instead of cow. trust me, they're sooo good!! they taste mucho better|`|f2MmEMg5aa	Hmm, eat a cupful of frozen grapes a day, drink smoothies but only ones made with fruit and water, NOT milk...  Apple chips are yummy & a good on-the-go snack,  and low fat yogurt with nuts or TINY pieces of chocolate are good.|`|1YcKHGLqaa	Mmk, the fresher the better. It'll take some adjusting, but try to eat a lot of raw fruits and veggies. Find a kind of apple you like (I like galas and braeburns) and eat that for breakfast or a snack. Bananas with some peanut butter on them make a really great breakfast/snack, too! Also, try cereal. Try to avoid the really sugary stuff, but things like rice krispies or special K with some skim milk are great for you, filling, and tasty! I also really, really like hummus. It takes some getting used to, but hummus with tortilla, pita, or crackers? Yum! And very good for you! It's also great on sandwiches for a little boost in flavor. Yogurt is also good for a snack or as a side to a sandwich at lunch -- I really like the yoplait whips, especially the key lime one. They're satisfyingly sweet and still good for you :)    Drink LOTS of water. Steer clear of sodas -- even the diet ones. It's okay to have one now and again, but slowly switch to water. It'll be hard and first, but you'll get to a point where you choose water over other drinks first. The eight recommended glasses a day will do WONDERS for you.    For lunch, try to eat balanced. Throughout high school, I ate a sandwich on whole grain bread -- normally ham or turkey, but sometimes tuna -- with a small bag of potato chips (a couple of handfuls) and/or a piece or fruit or some veggies (mm, carrots with ranch!), and something sweet, like a cookie or two.     The best key to losing weight is to keep your metabolism going. Eat less at meals, but eat small snacks in between. Don't shock your body by suddenly halving meals, but try to think about the fact that most restaurants serve things that are 2-3 times more than what you really need to be eating. Also consider that your stomach is roughly the size of your fist. That's the biggest problem people seem to have when dieting. They don't consider that, no matter how many 'good' foods they're eating, they are still eating too much. So, as far as your grape question goes -- look at your fist and look at your grapes, and figure out about how many grapes would fit there. It'll probably be around 20-ish. That should be about how many you'll want to snack on.    If you get hungry between meals, go for the "free foods". That is, foods that don't have a lot of calories in them. Salads that aren't slathered in dressing are a great example. At the grocery, I like to get the pre-bagged stuff and make myself a small salad with a little ranch for a snack :) Tasty and filling, and doesn't really "hurt" you, calorie wise. If you're feeling kind of lazy at lunch time, you can also make yourself a salad, half a can of soup, and a slice of bread and have a tasty, filling, and healthy lunch that is mind-numbingly easy.    Also, don't eat anything right before bed. Like, if you go to bed at 9, don't eat anything at all after 7, and try to end all of your eating around 6. Whatever is left in your stomach after you go to sleep gets turned into fat, basically /:    All of these changes will take some getting used to, but believe me, you can be very happy eating them. Don't view going on your diet as a punishment or something temporary. Make sure that you realize your diet is a lifestyle change, and tailor it so that you are happy. It's great that you're wanting to eat better and be healthier, but don't be afraid to live life :) If your friends are going for ice cream, don't say "oh, sorry, my diet". Get out there and have yourself a sundae! If you go to your favorite restaurant, don't be afraid to get your normal favorite over a salad that you won't really enjoy. While splurges shouldn't be daily, don't be afraid to treat yourself. It'll make sticking to healthier foods a lot easier in the long-term.     Best of luck, and I'm so proud of you for taking your health into your own hands, and for being smart about it! So many people nowadays want a "quick fix", but you are clever enough to realize that there is no miracle pill or diet. Brava :)|`|uxvskU7Xaa	when i need to find waht a serving for fruit is i go online and search   fruit serving size or something similiar to that there are a lot of websites that have different guidelines so if u search u will find one u like better  search online for healthy snack ideas too there will be too many to list on here  snack ideas  all fruits  yogurt  almonds    for breakfast i'm eating my fruit for the day with vitamins   between bkfast and lunch i eat 1-2 servings of beans  for my lunch i eat a salad consisting of   shredded cabbage or letuce  carrots                 bell peppers  onions                 chopped almonds  shredded cheese          a boiled egg  small amount of salad dressing lo-fat kind  for snack betweeen lunch and dinner i drink 8 oz of milk  for dinner i have fish and rice    this is my reg schedule of food it gives me 30-35 grams of fiber and about 1200-1500 cal  enuff protien and carbs - i try to keeps the carbs low and most come from the beans but they are very high in fiber  and at ur weight drink at least 75 oz of water a day but if ur exercising good i would up that   i do my water intake by taking half my body weight and drinking that amount of oz of water a day plus enuff to compensate for water loss due to heat or exercise    have u tried soy milk|`|qtpuOf7Oaa	pizza and ice cream      seriously      pizza with light cheese and slow churned low fat ice cream, i lost a bunch of weight just eating those.|`|daa9iTC5aa	fruit,carrots,celery w/ peanut butter, fruit snacks(gummies)|`|VOYSmwOXaa	fruit smoothies!!yogurt!!|`|82niQjyCaa	bagels are low in fat and you can change the fillings so not to get bored. it doesnt how much fruit you have and just exercise   make sue you are consuming your calories and drinking 6-8 pints a day or you will be more prone to gaining weight x  exercise is the key x  try swimming as its the best form of exercise and fun x  fruit fruit and more fruit x  yoghurts , jelly cereal x|`|8wU9D1P7aa	Control the food you intake....

I honestly am not much of a fan of fruit, but i eat a lot of veggies.     I have been eating like this for about 2 weeks, i try to keep at least one normal meal a day.

Of course i don't always stick to the diet, it's mostly a guideline.
GbzxnGcIaa	Yes,it is possible for you to get your clear skin back provided you start to treat your skin blemishes from now on.It is beneficial for you to increase your water intake since this could hydrate your skin internaly to prevent breakouts.However,it is best for you to find a skincare products to treat your skin for now.I would recommend you to use Neutrogena or Dove cleanser to cleanse your face and withdraw any impurities that cause breakouts.Plus,apply toner and moisturize right after cleansing to improve moisture and skin pH balance.This will make it easier for you to prevent more breakouts in the future.Hope I helped(:<br>  <br>  P/s:I would also recommend Clinique 3 Steps Skincare Regime since it targets skin blemishes.Try it and you'll see results in 3 weeks.Good luck!!|`|AA11995742	buy a skin cleansing product/blackhead eliminator and preventer (i recommend neutrogena), eat healthily (no chocolate and not too much cheese) and don't touch any pimples on your face<br>  good luck
2q1XI0j9aa	you cant spot reduce, you can spot train (tone) but not reduce (lose fat). the fat off your butt may go first or last, that is all about genetics...  to tone your butt you can do squats, deadlifts, lunges, legpresses, leg extensions, leg curls... if you don't know how to do these just email me, yahoo only allows so many characters in the answer haha      To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|Uu7BeMF2aa	you and try using an elliptical|`|eI5rgLcraa	"Loose fat?    it should probably fall off if you rub it  lightly with a towel|`|ONRpcM82aa	Try running and squats.

da7acbf57beceea0010f81ab835fb6ecaa	I agree with the last response. I think you may have heard about or seen someone who looked like they were tucking their chin because of the position of their back and shoulders. When benching for a max a lot of people use their legs to lift their butt off the bench to change the angle of the press closer to that of a decline (generally the easier press). In addition, most lifters will squeeze their shoulder blades together to move the weight from the triceps to the chest and shoulders (again, easier). This might make it look like their are tucking their chin.<br>  <br>  Your head should be flat on the bench. Don't try to lift off the bench since it takes away from the lift. Save that angle for decline presses. The shoulder blade move is an effective way to get more out of the press and improve your numbers once you can do it comfortably. <br>  <br>  Hopefully this makes sense. Good luck!|`|AA12144656	I've been training for 16 years and have never heard of this.  If someone has given this advice, I would ask why?  Normally we don't tuck the chin, but leave the head flat on the bench in a natural position.
aMQD2UnWaa	I seriously considered taking hydroxycut myself.  I'm glad that i didn't.  Taking diet pills just is not a reality.  Once you stop the weight comes back eventually.  The best way is the right way.  Don't diet.  Just eat healthy.  Try reading labels. Smaller portions.  Each balance meals that are low in fat and most importantly.... exercise, even if it is just a 30 minute walk several days a week.  Just move.  Adding vegetables and fruit make a big difference.  They fill you up with little or no calories.  Making sure that you are getting protein too will help you stay more satisfied. Since July I've lost 26 lbs by doing what I just told you.  I'm healthier, feel good, sleep better and I make much better choices now.  Try to stay away from drugs.  They can mess you up if you are not careful or if you are not monitored by a doctor.|`|GZBTuWzraa	Eh they are a temp. Solution, i would stay away from the hdroxycut hard core way to dangerous. I take reg hydroxycut periodically so after i am done with a bottle i stop for awhile and work out like crazy and try to have a steady diet. I wouldn't use them unless you work out and diet because they really have no affect if you just sit around and pop pills that's where it becomes dangerous.
oszDKWf1aa	Yes, I use to smoke everyday and lots as well. I started to smoke it for health reasons and then it just became a habit. I am glad I stopped but every now and then I think about having just one joint but luckily due to my work I can not touch he stuff.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	Yes.

Count the birds flying by (that you imagine), or try to see what is really behind your eye lids. Praying puts me to sleep, you might try it. If worries are keeping you up, praying may help as well.

There are many, many bras that do that, like push-ups and the ones with a little thing in the middle to move the cups closer.    There's nothing weird about boobs being "far apart", though. The women you see with close-together boobs are usually wearing push-up bras. I know it's "easy for me to say", but try not to worry about it. I'm sure you're totally natural and look fine.|`|ssiqDLKsaa	just gf\et a push up bra and wear it sorda tight and see if it works|`|fsHgUrcAaa	Go to Nordstrom and have them do a bra-fitting.

It sucks doesn't it? I use Victoria's Secret push up bras. When I'm wearing a low cut top & I want to have a lot of cleavage I use gel inserts too. I wear a 36 D so you would like I would have good cleavage... but no.|`|XEtESkISaa	Mine aren't close together, the models and actresses you see have people who make them look like that. Boobs are naturally lifted and so high. You're also only 14. Your body is still developing and it will take a while for you to really get the womanly shape.     If it really bothers you when you're dressed, try a different bra. Go to Victoria's Secret and get measured, they'll help you find the right fit. It what they're paid to do.     Good luck, but don't try to grow up so fast.
6HS1ot35aa	Honestly, the best answer is diet and exercise. Once you start hitting the gym, I guarantee you, you will feel and see changes. Diet is a huge part of it. The best thing to do is to follow the food pyramid and work out at least 1 hour a day, 5 days a week. And since your weakness area is your stomach, put a lot of focus on abdominal exercises. You just have to have the determination! I'm sure you can do it! :)|`|AA10980192	Last time I also experienced that, but now I don't.

Having just a little bit of what you like doesn't work, you simply end up eating a lot of it - what you need is to completely cut out the things that are making you fat. Full stop<br>  <br>  I found I was eating plenty of Crisps, Cheese and Chocolate, so I threw them all in the bin. And didn't allow myself to eat any of those things (unless offered them at a social event). Even in moments of weakness you can't cave in, because there are no snacks in the house to cave into.<br>  <br>  Eat lots of Protein, it keeps you very full. Lots more than junk food and Tuna is low in fat.<br>  <br>  Take up a sport or regular excersise, I actually have started running (but not on a treadmill, I find that boring) but instead I challenge myself and see how far I can run.<br>  <br>  It really has worked! For the 1st time ever I probably wouldn't actually want to lose any more weight, and I never thought that state was even possible!!|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	sounds really random! but when i was what i thought as being to fat i took a picture of myself naked at a size 16 and put in on the fridge and in my purse so whenever i was tempted i saw that picture and it put me off any naughty snacks, the weight soon started dropping off and as i was i felt more confident to go to the gym/swimming. I always attend at least three times a week now for approx 1/2 hr to 1 hr.<br>  I am now a size 12. It has taken me about 1 year. want to be a ten though bt i have big hips anyway!<br>  Try not to get too stressed about it coming off all in one go, chances are the weight came on gradually so you need to lose it that way to!|`|lIO4uiJmaa	When I think I need to lose weight and can't get motivated.

My advice is watch one of those shows about people who eat too much or are morbidly obese. There is one on TLC every now and then called "I eat 33,000 calories per day" which always has an impact on me when I see it. <br>  <br>  Once you are motivated it is important to realize it is hard work. Don't accept people telling you they took some pill and lost a lot of weight. If you want to take a product that actually heabsorptionli at the pharmacy. It will prevent the absorption of 1/3 of the fat that you eat. Beware of the side effects and make sure you are prepared to handle them. <br>  <br>  Another tool which I highly recommend is the ipod and Nike plus.

nbmAssw9aa	It sounds to me like you have a condition called hyperhidrosis.  Hyperhidrosis is a conditioin where you sweat more then most do in many situations.  I suffered from this condition for a while before i realized that I needed to do something.  Tons of my shirts were ruined, I had to wear baggy clothes every day, and I was to embarassed to tell anyone, even my parents.  I tried every deoderant that could be store bought, including certain dri, ban, secret clinical, mitchum, and more, and absolutly NOTHING worked.  So one day last year, I decided that I could not take it anymore and told my parents and they arranged a doctors appointment.  This was the best descision of my life because the doctor perscribed me Drysol.  This stuff works wonders for me and I feel normal again! Plus, I only have to use it once a month!  What I would recommend for you to do is first try certain dri, which can be bought in walmart and other convenient stores, because a perscription is not needed.  If that doesn't work, then I would definatly recommend setting up a doctors appointment to get your problem solved!    I hope this helped!|`|2b4cf122bf028b6f310138970448a801aa	I have this exact same problem. I forgot the technical name for it. But it's actually pretty common. Chances are you're just wearing regular deodorant. I use Certain Dri (The roll on kind, no Certain Dri AM) It's a special kind of antiperspirant, even better than the other "clinically proven". You can buy it at more drug stores or Wal-Mart. Be sure you read the directions!! It can be harmful to you, but really only if you use it right after you shave. Also be sure to apply it at night and then wear a regular deodorant in the morning. But this works wonders. I don't sweat period under my arms anymore. I also used to buy Maxim, which I could only find on the internet, but it seemed to have stopped working for me after a few months.|`|jQCy5x9Iaa	hi dear,  Have you heard about that book called stop sweating and start living it's amazing , i really don't know what would have happened without this book, it really works, anyway here is the link i read that led me to buying this book. http://freesweatlife.wordpress.com/2008/... hope that it helps.|`|hiTuNQU3aa	botox injections in your armpits work|`|HA25C2rxaa	all you have to do i take 1/2 cup of vinegar and 1 cup **** and mix together. once you have that take some butter and mix it with  a teaspoon of spem and then just mix it all together and eat it. that should make it stop

8RQCa3SXaa	PLEASE don't waste you're money.    it is the same as any other shake.    the only reason you loose weight is because you are substituting a healthy meal for a drink, which has less calories. you may as well substitute your meal for some healthy soup (which has little calories) or some vegetables.  it has the same effect, probably better.    please take this advice. (: because it is not worth the money.|`|al0cCPb6aa	They taste decent, I like getting the powders better because it's cheaper. Just like any other diet it works as long as you follow it.

5ulr9xLQaa	You didn't do anything wrong.  Your parents are just a bit misguided.  There has to be something that is causing the migraines.  I used to suffer from migraines and I found that they occurred only when I was dehydrated.  First, take care of yourself and make sure you find out what is physically wrong with you.  Second, go to school someplace far away from your folks.  You don't have long to go before you can get out of your situation.  I bet that part of your problem is that you have stress at home and when you go away you will see that your migraines will start to go away.<br>  <br>  You have to let the issues with your sister go.  She is getting the attention because your parents are trying to stop her from screwing up.  You are the perfect child and your parents feel like you don't need attention.  They give you negative attention because sometimes you are in the way of them stopping your sister from doing something else wrong.  They figure that you have things together and can handle things so they are short with you and take out their anger with your sister on you.  When you assert yourself they lash out at you.  Furthermore, a kid has a crazy effect on grandparents.<br>  <br>  Keep doing well in school and you will be ok.  You are not crazy but if you keep stressing you will lose it.  Find a job in a call center or entering data.  Try hanging out and having some fun, that will relieve some stress.<br>  <br>  Relax!!!|`|OmDPJvo9aa	All I can tell you is to try and make it through the rest of this year in school. There are only a few months left so it won't be long before you are off to college and you won't have to deal with the grief your parents are giving you. As far as the headaches go, I'd ask the doctor if there is some kind of medication he could give you to help. Hang in there, it will get better.|`|BTc4Qp48aa	You need to go to a counsellor.

I'm not a health therapist or anything... just a uni student... i know stress so first thing is calm down as nothing is worth getting so worked up about.. <br>  <br>  Perhaps try talking over your concerns with your parents using things like i feel rather than u didnt kick my sis out (which astonishes me by the way) if that gets you no where... plan b<br>  <br>  Which is probably to seek guidance outside your household... someone able to view things objectively and from an adult position... guidance councillor or family friend...??<br>  <br>  hope that helps... its ok... things my seem mucked up right now... but everything gets better!|`|c8DjmWXxaa	YOUR NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG.. sounds to me like your mom and step dad have high expectations of you, as for sister well that's just something your going to have to deal with, i feel so sorry for you, and im ever so sorry that i can't give you the answer that you need, you should try and speak to a counselor at your school, they will help anyway they can, but you do sound like a great kid, you need to carry on as best you can , remember that at 17 you don't have to wait much longer to get yourself out of that situation, your parents need a good talking too for their behavior, they are being very un fair and un sympathetic, a counselor will help you to deal with this, give it some serious thought.|`|JOBXEGq1aa	hi<br>  i come from a very different culture to you're culture but i can relate to you on one level, that is the feeling of not understand what is wrong with me and why do when we need help people sort of abandon us.<br>  honestly there is no reasonable answer to this nor an explanation. may be cause you acted out sensibly all you're life and took care of it pretty well up to this point may be they see it as some thing made up.<br>  they might see u as a strong girl who does not need them, and honestly some times parents do this for no apparent reasons.<br>  would you have a friend or an aunt / uncle, grand parent , cousin who would understand and support you for some time. least let you live with them for a little while. or may be who can talk to you're parents on behalf of you and explain you're need.<br>  may be if you take you''re parents to the doctor and if the doctor explains the condition and explain the need of the amount and quality of support you need may be you're parents would be more understanding. but then there is no guarantee that they will.<br>  big hug to you,  talk to some one who can really support you least show care. it'll help you loads. <br>  would not a counselor help?|`|fI0KaZ3jaa	Sounds like stress definitely has something to do with it. <br>  <br>  Your writing seems very forceful and emotional. I would suggest you write more to get your feelings out about what you are going through. It should help you feel better at minimum, though it certainly won't solve any physiological problems. <br>  <br>  As for the blackouts, there are a multitude of reasons for that to occur but what comes to mind the quickest (just based on what information you have given thus far), is lack of oxygen, which is generally what causes dizziness and fainting. <br>  <br>  I'm curious about the following:<br>  1) how long has this been happening?<br>  2) how are your eating habits?<br>  3) do you throw up often? voluntarily and non-voluntarily<br>  4) do you take any medications?<br>  <br>  For now, I would suggest finding a relaxing place that you can rest and think about yourself. Try to avoid thoughts about anyone else in your life, which you will probably find is going to happen. Just you and your own future/life.
tkDfqjQdaa	As far as I can tell that is not a brand name of a pill.  Thermogenic basically means speeding up the metabolism in the  body.  When you say it will heat up your body it will and it won't.  Metabolism creates heat or energy.  If you increase metabolism you increase the heat generated but this is not the same thing as turning up the thermostat in your house.  You won't necessarily feel hot all the time.  If you are familiar with Chinese Medicine philosophy then the increase in heat is an issue if you are already dealing with too much heat in the body.  Most of the thermogenic herbs are heating by those standards.  Exercise (nature's very best thermogenic!!) also does the same thing.  Eating 5-6 small meals a day will also.  You don't have to use any pills to create the effect you are looking for.|`|ufgv7oTjaa	I haven't heard of a Thermogenitc brand before... do you mean thermogenic nutrients, which help your body burn fat? If so, there are several nutrients that help with thermogenesis and/or metabolism, which can both help your body burn fat. Some of the most popular ones are Chromium, Niacin, Cayenne (along with any Casaicin/Capsicum product), and even Ginger. Any of those can help warm up the body and/or boost the metabolism to burn fat. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Waste of money, if they are the ones I am thinking about.
VtJuicThaa	I know it sounds kind of crazy but thats not confidence when you hear your friends say that they are sad. its just RELIEF that you feel when you know you are not alone in the world.<br>  in order to be confident yourself i sugget you do things that you are good at or practice things if you feel that you are not good at then you can show your talent to your friends then you will feel confident <br>  else don't care about what others think and just smile at whatever they say and don't act stupid in order to gain attention it will decrease your confidence more.
al0cCPb6aa	I would do the cross trainer, that burns the most calories. Then I would do the weights for your arms if you want to target them. Do light weights high repetitions so only do about 10 pounds for your arms and do 2 sets of 16 on each arm machine of your choosing.|`|q1KTVTNlaa	to tone you should do more at a lower weight. start at 10kgs. But dont do too much on yor first time. Remember and warm up properly first or you may pull a muscle.|`|KppM3VzAaa	Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day.    Exercise wise, you need to do 3 20 mins sessions per week. Choose your machine, running, rowing etc. Do 5 mins at a gentle pace, then up your pace each minute for the next 4 mins, repeat this cylce. Then the last 2 mins the gentle pace to warm down.    Combine these you'll burn fat.     hope that helps

qSFtNZ1jaa	Whatever your doing to make you think you need to do it.. Such as feeling tired, or stretching.. Sometimes when people stretch they always pop their neck and all that.

EZt7ZHIiaa	I think a lot of the problem is just what you said, you have a lot of stuff building up in the back of your mind, and you are lonely and cooped up all day.  Feeling supported and having someone you can talk to is extremely important especially during a pregnancy.  It can also help to unload some of these feelings that are building up inside of you so that they don't continue to make you so upset and depressed.  If you have every considered online counseling, it can be a very practical way of talking to a professional and getting these types of things sorted out.  Feel free to check out the link on my profile.  I think the most important thing is to find someone you feel like you can talk to about all of these things that are bothering you and work towards a solution.  Good luck to you.|`|Gxog88I3aa	It is a toss up between being pregnant and being alone most of the time.  You need to get out and walk for a little while each day and that might help some.  If you have friends or neighbors that you could spend time talking with that would definitely help with the loneliness.    That would also put less strain on your BF to try to help with all the feelings you are going through.    I spend all of my days home alone with my dogs, due to chronic headaches I can not work.  There are days that drive me crazy.  I try to go out for walks as often as I can.  I also drive the poor ladies at the grocery store nuts by talking their ears off when I go there.      Give it a try and see if that might help.  If nothing else hopefully it makes you see that you are not alone.
xvey8ixPaa	Your eyes do not ever stop changing. They do stop growing when you stop growing. So, changes due to growth will eventually stop. Natural regular changes with continue throughout your life. You can expect things to level off in your early 20's in most cases.|`|0LEFco9xaa	I have horrible vision too. It probably won't stop for a while. Most eye doctors say that you should start leveling out at about 25. Although I'm 27 and I just had a check up and my right eye got a little worse. So it will probably be a little while before the changing stops.

There are loads of temptations in the real world don't you think?! The one thing which clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it was highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN. I worked off twenty pounds, it clearly does produce results!
fY6L4qlaaa	i'm 5'5" and have never been over 130 lbs. and that is all muscle cuz i'm crazy about running....but even so, i was told by my doctor that it could have nothing to do about weight at all. sometimes stretch marks occur from growing too fast or losing and gaining weight fast and not gradually. also, some skin types are just more prone to stretch marks simply because they lack an ideal amount of elasticity. hope i helped...and i feel your pain.|`|fb6e01bd10dce5212a34b8e493ff20a8aa	Stretch marks are caused by a sudden increase in body mass, be it by water retention or weight gain.      Since they are under your top level of skin, only time and vitamin E will help them fade.  A laser clinic might be able to do something.     Body makeup is a quick fix.  It works for Charlize Theron!|`|qHUcyrytaa	It could be from growing quickly especially if you are so tall. There are some lotions with vitamin E and other supplements that will help them be less visible.|`|s7FBDZpbaa	most people have stretch marks, they are from gaining weight losing weight ect. coco butter works wonders on them. good luck|`|AN98KWr3aa	Fat and muscle can cause stretch marks, but you should probably ask your doctor.
OkCcsIzcaa	There are two reasons that you CAN''T get Rabies from contaminated food. <br>  <br>  (1) The virus will be killed by the cooking process<br>  (2) The virus enters the body through bites and open wounds. It does not enter by ingestion because the stomach acids will also inactivate it|`|qveeTggpaa	"Can you get rabies if you...eat something that actually was made out of an animal THAT HAD rabies?"<br>  <br>  ANSWER: Obviously, yes. You would get rabies i assure you. and my friend, if you ever faced this predicament please kindly go directly to the hospital and have an anti-rabies vaccine. (sorry, too formal huh((: )<br>  <br>  You're right, some CHEAP and careless people dump cat meat(yuck!) in some food stalls conveniently located outside. i gave you a link providing the answers for your other questions?      be careful now:D
slILtaEiaa	Make sure you see a doctor for a follow up to make sure this kidney infection is gone! I went to school for nutrition, and we did major work in a dialysis center, and several patients there had low grade kidney infections that started with one simple kidney infection, and it never went away fully, although they thought it did. This wears down the kidneys over a lifetime, and can end in kidney failure (end stage renal disease). When the antibiotics that were prescribed for you are gone, I would call the doctor and tell him you want a follow up to ensure that your infection is cleared up. Thats not to say that all kidney infections end up as renal disease, this is just to remind you that kidney infections aren't something to play around with, so make sure you get it properly taken care of! (Which is sounds like you are).
Uu7BeMF2aa	Are you giving into your cravings for butter and rye bread?  I don't think Rye Bread is bad for you, but if you've gained over 20lbs since quitting sugar and you're not caving in to the cravings, maybe you should double check the label on that craving reducer and re-evaluate what you are eating
Nvrwsf5zaa	you must have dry eyes. try usung TEARS NATURALE. it 's an eye drop that has the same pH value as your tear.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	If you rub your eyes. Your hands can have a lot of germs on them, and pollen/allergens, too.|`|kkAHzrVFaa	Eye irritants like pollen, dust, or an insect getting in your eye.  Also rubbing too hard can break the blood vessels.  Smoking or being around people who smoke can make your eyes very red and irritated.  Sometimes people who drink too much alcohol have red, bleary eyes.  An eye infection called pink eye produces red eyes that crust while you sleep and you have to wash with warm water to open your eye.  In other words there are lots of things that cause the whites of the eyes to redden, but it's the broken blood vessels leaking that actually gives the redness.|`|q1cqgVVSaa	sometimes because of dust and if you are not careful you rub your eyes letting eggs to get in. the worm grows bigger, soon the person has to take an operation.
EIrdLq6Zaa	Do you want the honest truth?<br>  <br>  First of all this only happened yesterday; naturally you've had a setback. No, of course not everything is going to be the same as it was yesterday. Your lost of interest is because you are depressed, wondering how am I going to pay bills, what am I going to do etc... However agreed said "mngmt blew it" said that to you because they A-were your friend or B- just took your side to appease you. You need to realize (I don't know your age) that you abused someone. You called them an unnecessary name instead of some self control. and then you had a childhood fit and at work no less; very immature thing to do. When someone pisses you off, you either ignore them or walk aware, you don't have a tantrum like a 5 year old. Management was right. Who needs an employee with an attitude. I would have done the same. With the job market the way it is, you CAN be replaced.<br>  <br>  Sorry but that's how I see it.|`|eWEqGHvJaa	Yes losing your job can cause you to be depressed and loose interest in the rest of your activities. It sounds like you may also have some anger issues.  Buck up and get back into the work place and back into life.  If you let the depression drag you down it can get to the point where you never leave the house and loose all your friends too.The choice is yours.  Take care of yourself and enjoy life.|`|FfGIZe7jaa	Yes it has everything to do with you not being interested in anything.|`|spXPpyP0aa	depression|`|ESG2olzlaa	You have to consider if the dis-employment was technically fair or not. Chronic anger issues like that could be very unappealing to an employer because it causes loss of income. The loss in interest is a form of depression that is caused from negative consequences from anger. Like most of the questions posted in the health section, I recommend seeing a doctor of medicine about a trial antidepressant. The anger issues may be resolved with self-help anger management, but that is on yourself to decide.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can recommend when you feel angry is from one of my favourite songs: <br>  <br>  "Now I'm sure you've had times when you've felt down or angry,<br>  Wanted to lash out, punch a wall and be manly,<br>  But the question I pose now will offer you a plan B,<br>  And maybe some peace and quiet for your friends and family,<br>  How hard is it to decide to be in a good mood,<br>  And then just be.. in.. a good mood?<br>  That's all I have to say because it's a straight up fact,<br>  You control your emotions it's as simple as that"|`|Lnqj0IlYaa	I was like you 12 months ago. Everybody cringed when they came near me as I snapped all the time. I then started crying at the drop of a hat which wasnt like me. IM PRETTY TOUGH. RAISED 2 KIDS ON MY OWN FOR 15 YEARS. I went t<br>  o my GP and told her how I felt. Then started crying. STUPID. She told me I had to think of myself and not others which is very hard. I started crying. STUPID. My whole life has been thinking of others and she told me I had to start thinking more of myself. I dont know how old you are but sometimes we have to put ourselves first, not family. She put me on some CHILL PILLS (anti depressants) now I feel really well. They kicked in right away. When I went back to work after holidays nobody could believe in the change in me. I have now decreased dosage to 20ml. Only need these now cox still raising 2 kids (19 and 21) still kids and a little grandson every 2nd weekend. Nothing wrong with you. Just a bit of stress. Please talk to a doctor. I dont believe in  anti-dresspants, but they have done wonders. I have had a temper all my life, now semi under control.|`|kEjxtQNDaa	it kinda of sounds to me like depression  over  the job loss and  that your upset with yourself for how you handled the situation|`|AA12316366	wow!! damned if i know|`|cGnIZ7kfaa	Well... I think there are external factors here we dont know about but Im sure getting canned is a contributing factor. I mean when I got bad marks on a test I studied so hard for, I just gave up on everything for a while. So maybe its the same principle.<br>  Maybe its just burnout. Apathetic feelings, indifference and at times sudden anger are symptoms af the simple overexhaustion of your psyche.
tMtBe1lKaa	Don't dance with mary jane. ;0)<br>  <br>  I think the traditional way is to drink TONS of coffee and water and apple juice. Try to flush your system. There are special products available, but honestly don't know hif they are effective. i think it normally takes 20-30 days to get it out of your system. also, eat poppyseed muffins before the test so if you fail, you can blame it on them :)|`|GoJLdATfaa	Don't smoke pot for a month and you'll be negative for THC (chemical in marijuana).

By the phrasing of your question, you sound pretty desperate for a remedy..

lg8gqyWVaa	yea my mom passed away 3 months ago. She had cancer and she was in a lot of pain! She said it hurt worse than having a baby. But i guess it just depends on the situation, i saw my friend die after a car wreck and i don't think she could feel anything.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Yes, I have sat with a couple of people whilst they were passing over and I suppose it depends on what is the cause of their death.  I don't think their passing causes them any more suffering than the initial cause.  Sometimes, it is a blessing.|`|GY97evsBaa	Well it all depends on the illness doesn't it?<br>  <br>  If it's a natural death it wouldn't be tooo painful (i hope)<br>  <br>  But if it was, i duno, cancer, it'd hurt?<br>  <br>  but you have painkillers<br>  <br>  it depends whether you're at hospital or not?<br>  <br>  (:|`|audIMxn7aa	If you don't wear a seat belt, yes it would be painful.<br>  Don't want to go into detail. But car accident deaths are not always instant. People actually drown in their own blood its horrible. Good thing its totally preventable.|`|5agXk9ldaa	well i think it is very hard just thinking that one day you will die, so i guess it is harder to know you are dying. and no i did not see one yet|`|EtUkys6Waa	I am truly sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  You do not say how this person died, or what their suffering was.  <br>  If your someone died in an accident they could have died before they realized what happened. Even if they did not lose consciousness their thoughts are usually on their loved ones.  If you person was suffering from a lengthy illness, did pain medicine block their suffering to the end?  If there is a doctor involved, they may have a more direct answer. But don't keep looking back too much, whatever happened, they are suffering no more.  You have my sympathy.|`|WbnAlLMeaa	as a matter of fact, i just watched 2 people die tonight.  right in front of me.  an suv in front of me crashed into a pickup that was headed in the wrong direction, head on.  only the drivers were inside each vehicle.  the guy gurgled and spit blood for a minute before dying and the woman in the truck grunted and gurgled and lost pulse twice before dying.  there were at least 10 of us trying to get them out and help them.  must say, not a pretty sight and definately not something you want to see.  makes you wonder about things you don't want to wonder about.  and another thing, i was behind the durango that hit the oncoming truck.  if durango hadn't been there, it would have been me twisted in that wreck.  both vehicles were doing about 60 miles an hour|`|eu6UQElYaa	I've seen three people die.  My grandfather, my mother, and a kid on my street after he was hit by a car.   For my grandfather it was peaceful.  He was completely unconcious and just sort of slipped away.  Same for my mother.  For the kid on the street, it was a little worse.  He was scared and in pain, but shortly before he died, he calmed down, he drifted into unconciousness and he also just sort of slipped away. None of them suffered right up to the very end.
dOeE9GCcaa	Sounds exactly like what happened to me when I first started having sex. I bled the first time, not the second, and then tons the third. Dont worry thats just your cherry poppin.

Just be careful and use condoms!|`|b2d07243a56fe86e58deeafb008493abaa	breaking the hymen should only be a little blood and only once.  it sounds like something else is going on. the pain and amount of blood are just not right.  maybe you should think about going to the doctors, something is just not right.|`|EgeId6TKaa	It very well could have been your hymen. Traditionally, the hymen breaks the first time you have sex, but not always. It also has a lot to do with roughness of insertion and size. A girl's hymen can even break from riding a horse or inserting a tampon! If you're not experiencing any bleeding or pain (except for soreness) right at this moment, I wouldn't worry about it.|`|8cfyxToaaa	I got off lucky when it was my first time. no blood or pain.  It could be that your hymen wasn't fully broken, or that you weren't loose enough. As the person said above me, get your boyfriend to finger you abit to loosen it up some more. Its both pleasurable and will help with your problem. Over all don't worry about the blood, its natural. But if it does keep up just ask your Doctor. But like i said give it few more times, your body just has to get use to sex. Hope that helps.|`|Aw0TFdNzaa	I dont knwo why your vagoo is bleeding but I know the solution.

VB76LCmSaa	unfortunately spot reduction doesn't work.  only a decade or two ago people still believed if they did squats that the fat would burn on the thighs which in reality was quite the opposite.  what really happens is the body thinks that you need more fat there because its working harder so your really just going to burn it off somewhere else.      so what you will want to do is diet and exercise, it just takes good old fashioned hard work.  since your not trying to gain muscle or anything you will most likely want a low carb diet and a good amount of cardiovascular workouts, such as running and jumping rope.  i've never been good at low carb diets but i can recommend the basics, throwing out the junk food and the so called "health food" like granola bars and health drinks which are almost always just as bad as the junk food but tastes worse and costs more.  and when your feeling hungry, what always worked for me was a glass of milk, or a lot of water. that's about al i can think of,     buon fortuna!  ~bruno talina|`|2q1XI0j9aa	well chances are thats not the only place you have fat, and you can't spot reduce, we can spot train (build muscle), but not reduce(lose fat) you will lose fat from everywhere and it may not come off your tummy first.    To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.), shape and woman's health videos. Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!
LvGQINd3aa	diziness    nausia    pressure    hard moving    etc etc etc|`|2sycPf8Daa	Although mitral valve prolapse is a lifelong disorder, many people with this condition never have symptoms. When diagnosed, people may be surprised to learn that they have a heart abnormality.    When signs and symptoms do occur with mitral valve prolapse, it's typically because blood is leaking backward through the valve (regurgitation). Symptoms can vary widely from one person to another. They tend to be mild, develop gradually and may include:    A racing or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) ,Dizziness, lightheadedness ,Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, often when lying flat or during physical exertion ,Fatigue ,Chest pain that's not associated with a heart attack or coronary artery disease.     If you have mitral valve regurgitation but don't have symptoms, your doctor may suggest you return for examinations to monitor your condition every three to five years. The need for follow-up will be based on the details of your case, including the amount of leakage. If, however, you have severe regurgitation, your doctor may suggest surgery to repair your valve.    Take care as always!
uX5hO3d8aa	At 5 foot 8 and only 123 pounds you're very skinny. Granted I'm a guy, I'm 5 foot 4, 140 pounds and thin (ok, got some muscle weight too).     You shouldn't be concerned about losing weight to try to trim yourself up. Any thinner and your boobs and butt will shrink if they haven't already.

B08V01eRaa	the rash is the most striking sign of scarlet fever. It usually begins looking like a bad sunburn with tiny bumps and it may itch. The rash usually appears first on the neck and face, often leaving a clear unaffected area around the mouth. It spreads to the chest and back, then to the rest of the body. In body creases, especially around the underarms and elbows, the rash forms classic red streaks (on very dark skin, the streaks may appear darker than the rest of the skin). Areas of rash usually turn white (or paler brown, with dark complected skin) when you press on them. By the sixth day of the infection the rash usually fades, but the affected skin may begin to peel.<br>  <br>  Aside from the rash, there are usually other symptoms that help to confirm a diagnosis of scarlet fever, including a reddened sore throat, a fever at or above 101° Fahrenheit (38.3° Celsius), and swollen glands in the neck. Scarlet fever can also occur with a low fever. The tonsils and back of the throat may be covered with a whitish coating, or appear red, swollen, and dotted with whitish or yellowish specks of pus. Early in the infection, the tongue may have a whitish or yellowish coating. A person with scarlet fever also may have chills, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite.<br>  <br>  When scarlet fever occurs because of a throat infection, the fever typically stops within 3 to 5 days, and the sore throat passes soon afterward. The scarlet fever rash usually fades on the sixth day after sore throat symptoms began, but skin that was covered by rash may begin to peel. This peeling may last 10 days. The infection itself is usually cured with a 10-day course of antibiotics, but it may take a few weeks for tonsils and swollen glands to return to normal.<br>  <br>  In rare cases, scarlet fever may develop from a streptococcal skin infection like impetigo. In these cases, the person may not get a sore throat|`|3QIWdvG1aa	If your child has scarlet fever, he or she may experience these common signs and symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Red rash that looks like a sunburn and feels like sandpaper<br>      * Red lines (Pastia's lines) in folds of skin around the groin, armpits, elbows, knees and neck<br>      * Strawberry red and bumpy appearance of the tongue, often covered with a white coating early in the disease<br>      * Flushed face with paleness around the mouth<br>      * Fever of 101 F (38.3 C) or higher, often with chills<br>      * Very sore and red throat, sometimes with white or yellowish patches<br>      * Difficulty swallowing<br>      * Enlarged glands in the neck (lymph nodes) that are tender to the touch<br>      * Nausea or vomiting<br>      * Headache<br>  <br>  The sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes and fever are likely to appear first, while the "scarlet" signs and symptoms of scarlet fever usually appear on the second day of illness. If your child has scarlet fever, the rash and flushing will likely begin on his or her chest and spread to the neck, face, trunk, arms and legs. The rash won't appear on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.<br>  <br>  The rash and the redness in the face and tongue usually last about a week. After these scarlet fever symptoms have subsided, the skin affected by the rash often peels. The red rash of scarlet fever usually begins on the chest and spreads to the neck, trunk, arms and legs|`|iS8UxcJsaa	Persons with scarlet fever have a characteristic rash that is fine, red, rough-textured and blanches upon pressure.

In these cases, the child may not get a sore throat.<br>  <br>  Preventing Scarlet Fever<br>  The bacterial infection that causes scarlet fever is contagious. A child who has scarlet fever can spread the bacteria to others through nasal and throat fluids by sneezing and coughing. If a child has a skin infection caused by strep bacteria, like impetigo, it can be passed through contact with the skin.<br>  <br>  In everyday life, there is no perfect way to avoid the infections that cause scarlet fever. When a child is sick at home, it's always safest to keep that child's drinking glasses and eating utensils separate from those of other family members, and to wash these items thoroughly in hot soapy water. Wash your own hands frequently as you care for a child with a strep infection.<br>  <br>  Treating Scarlet Fever<br>  If your child has a rash and the doctor suspects scarlet fever, he or she will usually take a throat culture (a painless swab of throat secretions) to see if the bacteria grow in the laboratory. Once a strep infection is confirmed, the doctor will likely prescribe an antibiotic for your child to be taken for about 10 days.<br>  <br>  Caring for a Child With Scarlet Fever<br>  A child with severe strep throat may find that eating is painful, so providing soft foods or a liquid diet may be necessary. Include soothing teas and warm nutritious soups, or cool soft drinks, milkshakes, and ice cream. Make sure that the child drinks plenty of fluids.<br>  <br>  Use a cool-mist humidifier to add moisture to the air, since this will help soothe the sore throat. A moist warm towel may help to soothe swollen glands around your child's neck.<br>  <br>  If the rash itches, make sure that your child's fingernails are trimmed short so skin isn't damaged through scratching.<br>  <br>  When to Call the Doctor<br>  Call the doctor whenever your child suddenly develops a rash, especially if it is accompanied by a fever, sore throat, or swollen glands. This is especially important if your child has any of the symptoms of strep throat, or if someone in your family or in your child's school has recently had a strep infection.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	I wish i did June but i'm a simple fellow and medical jargon goes over my head,thanks for the two points though,Matt.

You have two options really, you can either wear multifocal contact lenses which allow you to see near and far in both eyes at the same time. or you could be fitted with monovision which means that one eye is corrected for distance and the other for near vision. the brain adapts to this really well and so you can see both near and far at the same time.    Go see your optician and they can assess the health of your eyes to ensure that there are no other complications that would stop you from wearing contact lenses

The calorie limit you have set is probably fine too. Please do not buy anything to help you do this, making money for others won't help you lose weight.<br>  <br>  The key to melting away the excess is setting up your body to burn fat at it's maximum potential. You do this by eliminating foods that clog your liver and replacing them with foods that increase the fat burning function of your liver. This diet was written by a liver doctor and I have used it myself for ten years, its efects are immediate and you do not need to starve yourself. It takes some reorganisation of eating habits and understanding of how the process works. You will lose all you need to but only at between 1 - 2 kg a week. I limit myself to 1200 cal a day but it is actually the diet itself that helps your body to lose weight rather than the precise amount of calories.<br>  <br>  Read the articles I have linked below, they will explain further and includes a sample diet that I follow myself. I love it because it allows me to eat whatever seafood I like plus some chicken and lots of vegetables and fruit, pasta, bread and rice.

In a sense they are but they didn't alter the fetus to create belly buttons. A belly button was just a place where the umbilical cord was attached when you were fed by your mother in the womb. When you were born the doctors cut it, and after being cut it would dry up and heal. The way they cut it is in fact the way to determine your belly button (inny or outty).|`|X1IHaTKEaa	No they are not, the umbilical is cut about an inch from the babies belly and it falls of naturally after a week causing a belly button.|`|QWN8KNCPaa	not easy being attached to your mother aged 18 by the umbilical cord,human nature|`|AenRh1eRaa	yah i think so

You could be suffering from a medical condition which has caused the problem and if so the quicker it is checked out the sooner it can be treated.<br>  <br>  With regard to your mattress. If you consider it is past its best my advice is to simply get another one.<br>  <br>  If you don't already do this, it is recommended that mattresses should be 'turned' periodically. Maybe once a month.<br>  <br>  Before going to the expense of a new mattress, which may not be needed, I would consult your GP first just to make sure their is not another cause for you problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you can soon have a sound and painless nights sleep.<br>  <br>  Poseidon|`|OaDXVJU1aa	Try the reverse cowgirl......it won't help your back, but you should sleep better.......|`|NARiXGNDaa	sleep on the bare floor, its good for ur back :D <br>  <br>  x|`|QsrX5CY3aa	Acupuncture masks the pain but doesn't cure the problem.  So does a mattress change. It's like taking a pain pill. The pain may leave but the cause is still there so that's why your new mattress really didn't work. Now, inversion therapy causes your muscles of your core (the hips, thighs, buttocks, back muscles and most importantly the stomach muscles) to stretch out. As they stretch the knots and spasms leave and when these muscles are all relaxed they loosen their grip on your lower back muscles, your spine and most importantly your pelvis, allowing them to go back into natural alignment. As they align this will cause your sciatica to vanish. It's like if your car is out of alignment it pulls to one side and screws up the tires, it's the same with your back. Inversion therapy will help align your spine much quicker than some pillow while you're laying on your back. Hope this helps.|`|YtE7YXJWaa	Dont let the man do it then

Otherwise, your only other [drastic] option is for a certain surgery, where they implant some rod-like devices into your legs and stretch them out a bit....(long story short, hah).

cc9fd1e80d4f3f3e0531c81601acf1d6aa	Does this occur often or just after you eat something specific? Could be substances that you have not digested. Thats all. Try changing your diet to fruits and leave out the tea and coffee and nuts and see if anything changes. Consult a doctor too.|`|CEoCe9ENaa	Try using wet wipes after you have dry wiped post bowel movements.  It could be bits left over in the creases of your skin,|`|estIQEVNaa	And make sure you watch it closely though.  Too much black in your stools can mean that you have internal bleeding.
BNAzjSO1aa	Do you eat anything that contains things like poppy seeds? If so it might be them you are seeing, but also the other thing that it may be and this is purely speculation on what you have said it is possible it is specks of blood, if this is a recent change it might be worth your while going to a doctor and let him investigate further, if you do decide on that route then I suggest you take a stool specimen with you. A small amount is all that is needed not the full amount just make sure there is some of the specks in it.

og2zUpa4aa	Yes, there might just be a little problem with the fitting of the permanent bridge. Consult your dentist as soon as possible. Guess not a serious problem yet, but still. And as far as the pain is concerned, I feel there is food lodgement over your gums which is irritating the whole adjacent area, hence the pain. Keep the area clean from debris. Inflammation is going to subside automatically.

I was there for 3 days, self admitted. You get bored and have to share a room, yada-yada. But if you want the help, it works. Most hospitals have a psych ward. They will help you develop a plan to follow when you leave the hospital.|`|eDKSKqcSaa	Why not see what they say when you go along - it sounds like it would be good to speak to someone. Maybe they will suggest its better to get you an emergency appointment with someone but to stay at home. But if you go along they will help you decide and you can ask questions about whether the ward is busy at the moment.. what therapy they would offer..etc. But remember: hospital is usually only good for treatment to stabilise an emergency - healing and recovery happens after that with longer term support. So see if you can get a nurse or therapist to see regularly in the community.  Hope that helps. Good luck!

The machine should have 3 speed settings low, moderate and high so if you've never used it before start with the lowest. It isnt recommended that you use the machine for more than 10 minutes at a time and this provides you with a good workout - 5 minutes is enough to start though with trust me!

CciXZNYraa	Don't eat late at night. <br>  Eating late at night can cause you to store more fat in your waist and stomach. Stop eating 3 hours before you go to bed. If you need a snack, eat something healthy like a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts (unsalted). <br>  Eat often, but in small portions. The less your body peaks and falls on the blood sugar scale, the less likely it will be to overeat and/or store unwanted fat. Ideally, cut calories, but don’t starve yourself. If you eat the right foods and eat often enough, you won’t find yourself eating huge portions and overeating in general.<br>  Eat fats like fish oil, sunflower oil, flax seed oil. Also whole grains, legumes, and vegetables and limiting meats. Ease up on the salt and gassy foods that cause you to bloat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Get out and move. After what you put in your mouth, what you do with your body will determine if you can flatten your belly. Get at least 30 minutes of cardio exercise every day, along with a properly executed abdominal workout. Train your body with strength training activities. Adding muscle tone will help you perform all daily activities as well.<br>  <br>  You can also try these exercises:<br>  <br>  Belly rolls strengthen your vertical abdominal muscles. Sit with your legs bent, with feet flat on the floor and arms straight in front of you. Exhale and roll back until your lower back touches the ground and stop for a moment. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  In the same position, exhale and roll back until your shoulder blades touch the ground and momentarily stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  <br>  Tummy curls work on your horizontal abdominal muscles. Lie on your back and bend your knees at an (almost) 90-degree angle to the floor with your feet raised slightly higher than your knees. Breathe out, lifting your butt and rolling back to your shoulder blades. Inhale and roll to your tailbone and stop. Try not to let your bottom touch the ground. Repeat 20 times. <br>  <br>  Cross crunches are hard work but they're miracle workers at cinching waists. You will need a liter bottle filled with water for this one. Lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle with the floor. With your left hand cradling your head, hold the water bottle in your right hand. Lift your head and shoulders off the ground and reach across your body, so the bottle is outside your left knee. Pulse 20 times and then switch sides and repeat. <br>  <br>  Tailbone lifts work your lower abdomen and can help reduce a belly pouch. Lay on your back, with your arms stretched straight over your head and legs fully extended and crossed in the air. While breathing out, lift your tailbone then slowly lower as you inhale. To get maximum effect from this, don't let your bum just drop, you want to resist on the way down. Repeat 30 times. <br>  <br>  This is a favorite of mine as inverted crunches work your lower back which improves posture and strength. Lie on your belly with your arms in front of you as though you are flying like Superman. Exhale, lifting your right arm and left leg as high as you can. As you inhale, lower slowly. Switch, lifting your left arm and right leg. Repeat 20 times. <br>  In the same position, lift both arms and legs twenty times.<br>  <br>  Burn your belly fat by doing sit and reach exercise. <br>  Running and dancing early in the morning. <br>  Simple stretching and jumping when you wake up in the morning.|`|AA12383033	Put gun 2 face pull tig thanks|`|wnDPlEjDaa	For you, follow these 5 simple tips:<br>    <br>  1.

841943b78cff7c2c6b60811aa6a6632baa	You can lose 10 lbs in a week.  Most health programs suggest 2 lbs per week is the proper way to do it.<br>  <br>  But I gained 20 lbs after high school and used to be just like you.  All I did was finally get my butt on the treadmill (I drank a little water before, during, and a lot after).  I walked an average pace for the first 5 minutes...then moved it up to a fast walk for about 25 minutes, then sprinted for one minute then walk for one minute and switched off like that for 10 minutes.  Then I jogged at a fast pace for a straight 5 minutes and then walked at a fast pace for one minute, then an avg pace for another minute.<br>  <br>  The next day I jogged 10 minutes and walked 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  And I did the 15 minutes above the 3rd day.<br>  <br>  I had lost 10 lbs.  I was craving water and ended up replacing sweet tea/soda for water because my body wanted water since it really is more refreshing and not so thick and sugary.<br>  Also, as for eating...I found myself wanting to eat after my long jog...but I opted for a salad.  But then, I was wanting healthy food or smaller portions.<br>  <br>  So there you go!  It worked for me and I was amazed.  I had tried doing a short 15 minutes every day but never got any results...but by doing that large amount the first day it made such a difference.<br>  <br>  If you want (or need) to lose more, just do 30 minutes instead of 15.  Alternate between slow walks, average walks, fast walks, sprints, long runs, etc.|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Most people want to love as soon as possible and then permanently lose their excess weight.

xqYrGjGVaa	'Get Big' Routine<br>  People have different goals, and one of those goals is that people (especially men) want to get Big or Huge or Cut.  That's fine, and here's a great way t do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When working out to get big, you want to give your muscles the maximum amount of rest possible.  Therefore in a given week, you should workout each muscle group only once.  Yes, just once.  That way when you workout you are giving your muscles the maximum amount of time to rebuild and recover for the next week's muscle destruction.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When working out, every set needs to be to failure.  That means that you don't stop until you fail at doing the repetition.  For example, if you were doing chest then every set would pain your chest because you were working it out so hard, and by the end of the workout (which would last at least 1.5 hours) your chest would be extremely tired and broken down.  Since it would be so broken down there would be no way you could even exercise your chest in 2/3 days because of how hard you worked it out.  Make sense?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, studying more about muscle recovery and ways to help that through proper supplementation need to be looked into, as well as Protein 30min-1hour after your workouts.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A sample routine could look like this: Mon-Chest, Tue-Back, Wed-Legs(Upper+Lower), Thur-Shoulders, Fri-Arms, Sat-Abs.  Remember though, this is hard.  To always puch your muscles to the maximum requires patience and intense desire.

NJEzbr1baa	As far as I know, bad hand writing is just bad hand writing. How you use a pen/pencil should have no effect on your hand-eye co-ordination. The more you practice something, the better you'll become at it, and your co-ordination at performing that task should increase.<br>  <br>  While it's not easy to change your hand-writing when you're older, it's not theoretically impossible to introduce changes in the way you write. It'd take a while, and I wouldn't expect you to go from chicken-scratch to completely legible anytime soon, but if you are determined, you should be able to make improvements.<br>  <br>  As anecdotal evidence, many of my colleagues (general surgeons, ophthalmic surgeons...etc...) have poor hand-writing, but their work (which requires fine hand-eye co-ordination) is still top-notch.

You don't have to starve yourself, the more the better! don't mix meat with starch (pasta potato) they combine together and make fat sources. so stick to green vegetables and pasta.<br>  and meats and anything apart from starch.<br>  after a week your body will get used to all the changes.<br>  just remember to have 8 glasses of water a day.<br>  this could be, sugar free squash ( i have that ) sugar free sparkling water, sugar free flavoured water. anything you like. as long as it says '' sugar free on it ''<br>  hopefully this will give you a few hints and tips.<br>  good luck with everything.<br>  danielle xox|`|ptx1SrcTaa	I think that answer itself is a question somewhat.  What kind of work do you do? Do you sit in a chair at a cubical all day or are you moving around? do you sit down every chance you get? Do you drive to school or work?  1. If you work at a desk job this is a downfall.  Most offices now-a-days offer other types of working areas.  By this I mean you can ask for a desk that you stand up at, standing up or even sitting on a exercise ball all day can help you work off weight without even noticing. This causes you to flex abs and cause fat burning.  2. Try to not sit down every time you see a chair if this is the case.  Your body burns more calories standing and moving then sitting.  3. Try biking or walking to school if it's not too far.  If it is and you must drive try and park as far back spot in the parking lot as you can so you must walk to your building.  <br>  <br>  Now onto the workout.<br>  <br>  Movement.  Find a sport that you like.  Volleyball or jogging, or swimming.  If you don't like that try to go for a fast-paced walk everyday.  And eventually start adding weights to your ankles.  And increase resistance. If you really want, try to jog while in a pool.  It's cooling, its resistance and you get to play in water.<br>  <br>  A healthy diet is always good too.<br>  <br>  Drink 1 to 2 glasses of water before every meal.  I don't mean sip, I mean finish 1 to 2 glasses of water, entirely before you eat.|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Not so long ago, experts have determined how much time should be given to physical exercises to achieve a protective effect.

I hated working out before but now I walk my dog every morning at 6am for half an hour. Before I never wake up before 7 let alone walk every day, but once you get used to it you will keep doing it. Also watch your eating, you can't just do one but need to balance both eating and exercise to lose weight. I've been going up and down and not losing weight for 2 years but now I started eating healthy and regular exercise and have lost 4.7 kg in 5 weeks.
KKev7q04aa	You just need to get into the habit of always wearing (or at least bringing) your glasses. It is no harder to remember glasses than anything else. I presume you don't forget to put on your pants before leaving the house. Note: if your glasses are -2.25, you should probably be wearing them all the time anyway, that way they don't get forgotten, sat on or left somewhere.<br>  <br>  If you still forget your glasses, maybe you can talk to the teacher, before the class starts, and see if he/she will let you sit in the front row. If they refuse, let the teacher know that, if you can't see the board, you will not get a good education and probably never get a decent job and probably wind up leading a life of crime and it would all be their fault.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Squint or get new ones....|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	You can't.<br>  <br>  You have to wear glasses when you really need them.

Keep pushing the limits everyday 3 days to a week, and not by alot. For example, jump 3 minutes a day for 4 days, then on day 5 add 30 seconds a day and so on.

It's actually pretty common -- especially if you used to have a bedwetting problem when you were a bit older (past 5 or 6) as a child -- for this problem to recur in situations where you're really tired or under a lot of stress.  (Alcohol is another common "trigger" for a this in a lot of people, if any of that was involved!)  The recent urinary tract infection could have played a role too, as your bladder may not be completely "healed" yet and may still be a little more sensitive/irritable than normal.  As long as it doesn't happen again more than once or twice in the next month or so, you're probably fine.  If it does happen more than that, then it's possible that the UTI has returned or something else is going on -- in that case you might want to run it by your doctor just to be sure.|`|6f10b90520a20cc4b683af96c31a2cabaa	It could be a urinary tract infection. And if you were having a stressful night, you were probably exhausted when you fell asleep and bedwetting can be more likely in someone who is in a deep sleep. I would go to the doctor and have a urinalysis done.....maybe even a pregnancy test......and mention the incident to the dr as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and whichever way things go with your bf, I hope it works out for the best!|`|M3x0quJsaa	as well as what the other person said, perhaps you were so worried and that it led to you doing that.

He was a toothpick and wanted to gain weight. What he did was take weight gainer powder and ate A LOT. The most important thing is gaining weight without getting fat. This means you want to eat lots of protein and and an equal amount of carbs. Too much fat is bad and too much carbs are bad. In terms of exercises, you want to do low repetitions and higher weights, increasing weigh as the weeks go by. Building muscle in your workouts require high intensity resistance training, so if you haven't been lifting weights build up to it gradually. Taking longer rests between your sets will allow more muscle fibers to be built, and drink plenty of water.|`|igiCJuF9aa	30 min cardio (for heart health) lift weights/stretch, try a weight gainer shake from the vitamin store, use whole milk, eat a lot of whole grains, lots of whole wheat pasta, etc..  eat lots of healthy fats, coconut stuff, avacado, cook with lots of olive oil, potatoes are a heavy starch, try dicing them up and cooking them in olive oil, you will then have healthy fries

I also found myself eating massive quantities of food (I did the same thing at university as you).<br>  <br>   I have researched overeating and food cravings for nearly 20 years now and have discovered that there are 3 very common medical conditions that cause insatiable food cravings...you may well have all 3. <br>  <br>  Candida causes cravings for anything sweet or yeasty or mould type foods - this would explain the fruit, bread, chutney and cheese.<br>  <br>  Food Intolerance cause cravings for anything to which you are intolerant - I would suspect wheat and dairy.<br>  <br>  Hypoglycaemia is all about the blood sugar roller coaster your body goes on when you eat so many carbs (fruit and honey mostly for you). When you eat a carb, your body is supposed to release the right amount of insulin to 'mop up' the sugar that enters your blood stream, to return your blood sugar levels to the normal range. If you are eating smoothies so much - liquidised fruit - you body may think you've eaten several mangoes and bananas, when in fact you have just had the sweetness equivalent in the smoothie. The body is likely then to release too much insulin and this will drop your blood sugar lower than where it was before you had the smoothie and then you'll be hungry again - it's a vicious circle.<br>  <br>  There is a way out - I've published 3 books on it! Check out the links below and email me if you want any personal help.<br>  Very best wishes - Zoe|`|XM84YoBxaa	sh*t calm down... everyone gets random huge food munchies.<br>  <br>  Eating least 6 times a day is great for your metabolism anyways...gets it going, where as if you didnt eat then it wont be working right.<br>  <br>  Then again im no doctor..either way dont feel guilty about eating it lol your only human|`|yuB6dP1Waa	have you been putting on any weight?|`|LpaUZNPkaa	Hi!! <br>  I think that your normal diet is not right. <br>  for example, for breakfast eat too much fruit and no carbohydrates <br>  Instead of eating all that fruit you could eat the biscuits with milk and fruit <br>  for the snack a fruit. a lunch of meat, bread, vegetables and fruit. The afternoon break is good. Also the dinner is good, but snack after dinner is wrong. Instead of hot chocolate, drink of green tea or herbal tea. The hot chocolate is full of fat. <br>  Physical activity is right. And every now and then you might give a good pizza or something more. Just be careful and not over the top. If you have some time off from hunger meals, chew gum or eat a fruit. Bye, I hope to have helped. =)|`|igiCJuF9aa	1) you should be eating small meals every 3 hrs. <br>  2)  you should be following the food pyramid or about this: 2 fruits a day, 3 veggies, 4 proteins, 6-11, whole grains, 2 healthy fats and 3 non or low fat dairy. yes 6-11 whole grains sounds like a lot but when you realise how small a whole grain serving really is, its not. 1/3 cup cooked rice or 1/3  cup cooked pasta is a serving, its tiny.  also dont eat white bread, rice or any white grains, they burn too quicky and then you'll be hungry quicker, whole grain bread, oatmeal, brown rice, etc.. burns off slow so it will keep you full longer. you need some protein for breakfast too, how about a muscle milk protein shake or add it to your smoothie, they are the best tasting ones out there and have a TON of flavors. <br>  <br>  look at something like this:<br>  <br>  breakfast: fruit, low fat dairy, protein, couple whole grains<br>  snack:  fruit, low fat dairy, rice cake, with honey, or somethign<br>  lunch: huge salad with diced marinaded yummy chicken, whole wheat curly pasta and low fat or fat free dressing<br>  snack:  protein bar<br>  dinner:  veggies, brown rice, fish or meat, or veggie burgers<br>  <br>  you need to eat more often, and a balance of all the food groups. it seems like your main problem is your day is starting without a good solid protein source for breaksfest and not enough whole grain for breakfast either to keep you full longer<br>  <br>  good luck

So my dermatologist prescribed Benzaclyn(morning) and Differin(night) and recommended I use Cetaphil as a face wash. That works for me.  I don't see how you could continue on anti-biotics forever, those are pretty strong and ur body will eventually build up a resistance. You could also try Accutane, but you have to go in for monthly tests to check your kidney or liver function, because it can cause problems. Hope this helps!

My favorite recipe to make is grilled chicken & zucchini over brown rice.     For about 3 servings:    Ingredients: Rice, 1 zucchini, 2 med. onions, chicken broth or cubes, olive oil, chicken breast, spices.    1) Cook 1 cup of brown rice in 2 cups chicken broth (no water) and 1 onion cut in quarters. This gives the usual bland brown rice amazing flavor.    2) Meanwhile, sautee sliced zucchini & sliced onion in olive oil and add your favorite spices - I use garlic power, salt, pepper.    3) Then use same pan to quickly grill cut up chicken slices.    Serve over the brown rice. Give it a try. My husband (a health food hater) balked at this but when he tried it, he raved.      http://www.yumyucky.com/yumyucky/about-y... is a newer site with upcoming taste test reviews on foods promoted as diet or healthy.

However, when the results were returned I was referred to a reproductive endocrinologist (because of my reasons for getting the tests done{trying to conceive at the time}).    So in other words, yes...a general practitioner can perform the blood tests easily enough, but depending on the outcome, further testing and treatment would more than likely refer you to a specialist.    Take care.

6MwIvHlNaa	3 miles isn't a long distance, even after only 2 months you should be able to do it in 24 minutes (8 minute mile).  If you cover the distance (combination of running / walking) every other day you will soon be able to do it without breaking into a walk.  If you run the full 3 miles you will easily do it inside 29 minutes.  The biggest tip for new runners is to start off really slow so to avoid getting a stitch or shortage of breath.    Firstly you need to measure a 3 mile course http://www.mapmyrun.com    Make a note of 0.5 & 2.5 mile points.    Wear a stopwatch to monitor your times.    If you can't run the full 3 miles, run as far as you can then walk for 1 minute before trying to run again.  Just make sure that you cover the full 3 miles.    Start off nice and slow (so you don't get a stitch) for the first 0.5 mile, then step up the pace. Increase the pace further at 2.5 miles to just below a sprint.    BTW, I had to do it in 21 minutes to get into the British Royal Marines.  The 32 weeks basic training wasn't much fun either!|`|pa7hVLAHaa	Cross country training should start with long distance long duration runs and end with short distance short duration runs.      Begin running at a slow pace, 2-4 miles a day for 3 weeks.  This will build up your frame by strengthening your bones, tendons and ligaments.     Next run 5 (slow pace) miles a day MWF and on TR do 2-3 intervals of 1 mile timed runs.  Try to get your mile time to below 8 mins per mile and take 5-10 minute breaks between intervals.    For the last 2 weeks you should focus on fast short distance runs.  Do timed 400m intervals on the track (6-7x per workout).  Continue the 1 mile timed intervals on the days you're not doing the sprints.      Track your progress throughout your training and try to raise your standards.      Good luck!|`|EhJlgKLAaa	well first run the three miles and see how long it takes you. and run 3 miles for about a week and push yourself. the next time run 4 miles everyday and push yourself for about 30 seconds with about every half mile you run. the next week time yourself again. if you are under 29 minutes then continue to run 3 miles everyday and push yourself. if not keep switching every other week until you get there. the key is to train hard. if you don't then you'll never see improvement.|`|2VtFVKCDaa	My husband just did his qualifications for USMC. He had to do a mile and a half in 13:30 for qualifications and now at RSS they run 3 miles in 26. He was overweight 6 months ago and has actually lost 50 pounds in 6 months. Eat a high protein, low calorie diet. Stay consistent with your running. Don't take 4 days off and then do 3 miles. Your body will not accept that. You've gotta build your endurance! You can do it if you work at it slowly!    Email me if you want to chat with my husband via email. Sounds like you guys are in the same boat (he is 24) and could be long distance support for each other! He ships out March 30|`|fMS1kDA2aa	its all about breathing. To do it in 29 min. you have to average just over 6 mph. Start off on a treadmill, its easier. Then start running outside as far as you can in 29 min, but don't push it. Then keep running 29 min everyday and try to work up a farther and farther distance. I take two steps while I inhale and two steps when i exhale. keep the breathing in rhythm with your steps.|`|iEomLzhqaa	well, im sure u can basically walk/jog this. im guessing ur gonna suck as a marine, sorry.

AA11375099	My wife's friend had breast cancer.  She did not want to go through the traditional methods of curing it, so she tried alternative methods.  At first she was at stage 1 breast cancer.    Well after a year, it did not leave, in fact it did the opposite it grew.  She found out that it was now at stage 3 breast cancer.  She realized that everything she tried did not work.    From energy work, massage, and prayer the cancer continued to grow.    Finally she realized that she had to do the traditional way or die.  She went through chemotherapy, mastectomy, and radiation.  That was seven years ago and she is doing well.  In fact she was a great help when my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.    We do some of the alternative work along with the traditional treatments.  Some of them are "hands on energy healing", massage, supplements (though a naturopathic doctor that was recommended by the hospital), and of course prayer.    We are satisfied that we have a great team of doctors helping us.  They are our PRO BOWL  Team of doctors that will help us kick cancer out of the ball park.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	It's a quack site.    The breast cancer treatments that have been proven in many large, multi-center, randomized and generally double-blind clinical trials are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.    Nothing else is proven to work.     Many things recommended at that web site are actually counter-productive to the proven treatment methods.    What about the current conventional treatments is bothering you?|`|FicyC2TXaa	No. It's important to remember that in this context 'alternative' is just another word for 'unproven'. If any of these treatments had been proven to be effective against cancer, they wouldn't be 'alternative medicine', they would just be 'medicine'.    Please research thoroughly before you or anyone you know invests money, hope and - most dangerous of all for a cancer patient - time in ineffective and dangerous treatment.    Sadly wherever there is cancer there is an unscrupulous charlatan eager to separate desperate people from their cash for useless and sometimes dangerous 'cures'.     Please be wary of ubsubstantiated testimonials, especially on the inernet; you have no way of knowing if the person ever had cancer in the first place, much less that they were 'cured'.     If you are tempted by a particular alternative treatment, do a search on this site for some facts:    http://www.quackwatch.org/index.html|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I don't know what you mean by alternative but I wouldn't be taking any chances on anything other than the specialist at the hospital.  I have had two lumpectomies and radiotherapy.  The first in 2003 and the second in 2005. I have just been told I am cancer free at the moment.|`|AA12050428	My friend opted for some such treatment, afraid it didn't work so I would not recommend them.

AA12338819	I completely understand.  I am going through the same thing.  I can't quite get my yeast infection to clear up!  I have found in the past that boric acid suppositories work like a charm but they need to be made in a pharmacy and insurance doesn't cover it so it can be 40$ for a 30 day supply sometimes which really is expensive!  You might have to wait longer on sex until your natural juices start flowing again, too.  That is what I am doing.  The prescription medicine didn't work for me but boric acid did.  Now that I stopped it, the yeast returned.  I suggest you try the boric acid for a week and wait for your natural discharge to return and then have sex again.  That is what I'm gonna do, too.|`|qPZ6qzeGaa	I am assuming you used monistat one dose? I never found the one dose, or 3 day very effective myself. Try the old standby 7 day dose instead. I would refrain from sex til it clears up and you do not have any more symptoms. You can  also douche with 3 tsp hydrogen peroxide to a quart of water till symptoms subside.  Maybe the one dose was not enough, and the blood may be before your period, or maybe the infection was bad enough to make you raw and irritated so you bled.(???)
AVzQs5Uhaa	Could be a possible prostate problems but I would cut back on the coffee,tea and pepsi and try water they are better on your kidneys and less calories so it may help you lose some of that weight. If you have no pain urinating and do not urinate frequently and are constantly thirsty it sounds like  it could be from the fluids you are drinking. You are probably dehydrated because you are not getting enough water into your system even though its coffee and tea they all have additives sugars and syrups try sticking to regular water for a while.|`|KdUbGwaYaa	There's no problem with only urinating twice daily. I drink about 6 glasses of milk a day, plus other beverages and I only urinate about twice as well. I, like you, have troubles/dislike urinating in public places. This may be why you only go twice because when you feel uncomfortable doing something you're generally not going to do it. As well, you could just be used to the feeling of holding it in because when I hold it in, I tend to forget and then just go when I get home. Also, if you do drink a lot of pop, it is very sugary stuff, therefore, your body might just be absorbing the sugar and there is no real fluid in that, so it may cause some odd urination habits.     I hope it helps!!!!  P.S. If you drink 1 can of pop every day, that's equivalent to eating about 2,920 teaspoons of sugar per year. If you've been drinking pop like this your whole life, then you've consumed close to 87,600 teaspoons of sugar. This (no offense) may be why you're about 33 pounds overweight. So, just for your own health, you may want to consider cutting back the soft drinks!  I'm sorry if that sounded rude, I really didn't mean it too sound like I was making fun or anything. I just think you'd lead a healthier life if you cut out all of that sugar.|`|lAI9Mxcnaa	I agree with Ashely.  It takes your body a lot longer to process liquids that contain sugar and extra calories.  You may notice you urinate more frequently if you switch to drinking water.|`|kC8JHWVQaa	Your body may be hydrating,Are you eating alot more fiber? Diabetes? Any Medications you are on ? Could be any of this or others issues best to see your health care provider have some lab works done to find out..     And by the way HOUSE is AWESOME!!!!!
cg9Xt536aa	Hi    I am a Nurse in my local Anticoagulant Clinic. When we use the thumb prick (protime machine) we dont test for the pregnancy hormone the machine just measures the time the blood takes to clot (INR) . If you wanted to know if you were pregnant then you could ask them to do an INR and pregnacy test from the same sample of blood, thius should not be a problem providing your local Anticoagulation Clinic still does the venous test. If you are pregnant then its important to find out so that your Anticoagulation Drugs can be alterned, changed or stopped depending on your condition etc because some anticoagulaton drugs (especially warfarin) can cause harm to the unborn baby.    Good Luck|`|sw2R5A9iaa	of course not -use condoms & buy a pregnancy test at the local drugstore.
R4WX5twzaa	Tone down the caffeine, chica. Limit yourself to one cup of coffee every few days. You may have to wean yourself off of it, if you're drinking 1-2 cups a day you're probably addicted to caffeine so suddenly cutting it off could cause you to get headaches, but once you're not addicted anymore, don't drink it everyday, then see how your heart is.|`|xJUQW1xmaa	it may be the coffee.. but how long have you been drinking 1-2 cups of coffee? have you seen a doctor to check if you may have an irregular heart beat?|`|0K7eHcIRaa	I work in health care (although not in the clinical area) and have heard about this. A lot of the time it is associated with stress. Do you have any other symptoms associated with anxiety or panic attacks? You may want to visit a doctor for a check-up, just in case. Just take note if the doctor suggests any anti-anxiety medications, they can have side-effects. Try reducing your stress through spending more time with friends & family, exercise, nutrition, getting enough sleep, and taking time for yourself to do what you love. Hope this helps!

I work in a chemist and theyre are hundreds of people on the 30mg strength and they have been taking them for years, and also my mum have been on them for as long as i remember. See how it goes, if you get the tummy probs you know you should be carrying on with your original dose of one daily!
B9yfHeRYaa	Sometimes people just normally skip one, for no reason...well idk if there is a reason or not, but I've done that and a lot of my friends have so I think it's normal.    Plus, do you think you might be...um...pregnant?

I truly envy you. - Such dreamy feelings seems not completely bad.    However, have you tried to drink something sweet and, if possible, cold when you feel that the said feeling is beginning?    Please also be attentive on your living. - Make sure that you sleep properly, take long walks (the feeling could depend on that you are not getting enough fresh air) and, of course, eat as you should. - No diets.    Then it could be something with the ventilations in that specific room. - Your mates are not feeling anything? Your teacher? Please tell an adult if the feeling not vanish.    Good luck!
e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	you may want to check with your doc about this, but most people don't feel 100% for about 6 weeks. You should get a little better each week.

They end up losing weight . Not because negative calories, but because they are eating healthy.|`|Z2iQdl53aa	Many foods do. The source website contains a list of 'negative calorie' foods.|`|uqRb9tAqaa	Well, ice water burns calories and has none. And some kinds of pickles have such low calories that you burn about the same as you are eating - so pickles aren't negative calories but they are 0 - sour pickles, that is.    xoxo  Simona
5LJUiqOUaa	i have ceramic braces on both my top and bottom teeth and i think it was worth it . it was $500 extra to get them . i can't see them when i take pictures . everyone says they turn yellow after a while but only if you don't brush your teeth as often as you should .  i got mine in november and my braces look as white as the day i got them . i brush after every meal ( except when i eat at school ) and floss at night and my ortho. says they won't turn yellow if i continue this . or if you decide not to get ceramic braces, you can try invislign . it's like invisible braces but you have to change the trays you put in your mouth ( approximately ) every 2 weeks  but you can take the trays out when you eat and brush you teeth . i think ceramic braces would be easier because you might forget to put the trays back in or even lose the trays if you had invisalign . good luck :)|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	I had clear ceramic braces on top and metal on bottom and my daughter has that now.

They were about $800 more expensive but I didn't mind paying it. BUT - I had springs on in front and other stuff so I didn't really get to experience the clear braces thing.

The only thing with them is you have to clean them a lot more than the metal ones, but this is a really small price to pay for such a big difference! the cost difference for me was negligible (about $200) so there wasn't too much of an incentive to not get them.    In photos it just looks like I have a retainer on, and you can't see the metal lowers at all, so that's not a problem.    Re: invisalign, I looked into this extensively and am so glad I chose to go with traditional braces. Invisalign would have cost twice as much and taken twice as long.

This is done, not with pain killers that mask the pain, but with anti-inflammatory meds like Ibuprofin.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	I've lost 30 pounds in 4 months.

aFkHCpwKaa	Hey there. No need to worry. I've just recently turned twenty, and I now have at least fourteen fillings.If you add that to the fillings I had on my first set of teeth it adds up to alot of fillings. They will give you numbing shots, and once they have it's smooth sailing. It is going to hurt a bit, no doubt, but not much and not for long. I can also tell you by experience that not having the fillings can make the pain worse.  I'll give you the advice I should have listened to when I was ten: brush about ten minutes after every meal.Brush right after having any candy. Brush even if you don't have toothpaste, baking soda works just as well. and try to get porcelain or composite fillings. make sure to ask about amalgam, and if the dentist uses it. I suggest not having amalgam fillings, but the best thing you can do is make sure you don"t need any fillings after these three. Take care of your teeth, and they'll take care of you.  No worries, everything will be fine.    I'm not a doctor, and all advice is anecdotal.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I don't know how it is in the UK, but here in the US-yes of course-they give you a shot to numb you first.

AA12041870	Weather is the word used to tell people the conditions outside.  The word you want is whether.           One definition of oxygen debt is "where the demand for oxygen is greater than the supply". In practical terms this means that your body is working hard, you are breathing in a lot of oxygen but you cannot absorb enough to cope with the level of activity. If this happens, your body is mainly utilizing the anaerobic energy system and as a result, lactic acid builds up as an undesirable waste product. This system can only be sustained for about 60 seconds (depending on the individual) before severe fatigue sets in and you would have to take time to recover. The amount of oxygen "owed" to the body in order to recover is called the oxygen debt.     An example of this is if you run a hard race like the 400 metres where you start and finish using mainly the anaerobic systems. Soreness and fatigue sets into the muscles and you need to "repay" your body with oxygen after the race in order to recover.
EZt7ZHIiaa	Because each person has anxiety and depression for slightly different reasons, this type of approach isn't going to work for everyone. As a therapist myself, I can tell you that your best bet is to find someone who will work with you on a more personal level, and that way you can work on problems specific to you. If you are interested in online counseling you can check out the link on my profile, but I think what you are going to find is that many self-help resources don't get deep enough into your specific reasons and triggers for your problems, which is necessary in order to really get to the bottom of it.  However, I'm sure it can provide some useful coping mechanisms and some general guidance if that is more of what you are looking for. Good luck to you.|`|f19e89jKaa	it was the worst time of my life.|`|AA10626996	I never have .I do not know what that set cost but it looks expensive...

Therapy is also a good treatment if you are against taking meds. They can help you w/ coping skills...

FicyC2TXaa	While it's true that one in 7 to 9 women (depending on where you live) will develop breast cancer, 80% of those women are over 50, only 5% are under 40 and 0.1% are under 30.

Pain and tenderness are rarely symptoms of breast cancer, and the fact that both breasts  are tender makes it even less likely that this is anything sinister.

Just exactly what type of conspiracy would be needed to keep the 'cure' a secret . . what you suggest makes no sense whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Instead look at it this way .. cancer is an ancient disease . . always been around . . if you look at cancer as being thousands and thousands of years old than 30 years of research does not seem like such a long time.<br>  The problem with cancer research is that we are talking about an individuals DNA . . which is unique to that person . . than we are talking about over 200 differerent types of cancer . . all treated differently and treatment tailored for that one person. It than will become clear to you why there is 'no one cure' for all cancers . . because like the common cold . . every cancer is unique to that one person.  The best we can do so far is 'early detection' becomes the best prevention.<br>  <br>  We also do have treatments for different types of cancers in the early stages that can lead to 'cure' for that individual . .we just don't have overall consistency for all patients . . because treatment success is based on patient age, overall health, type of tumor, location of disease, grade, stages, and the skills of the doctor.<br>  <br>  Not sure why people keep thinking that there is some 'conspiracy' . . doctors, researchers, and government officials all die from cancer too.<br>  <br>  So there is 'cure' . . but cure is based on strict criteria . . and type of cancer . . .. it is 'stage of cancer' that is critical to 'cure'. Cancer is a progressive disease which means it starts out tiny and keeps on growing indefinitely. If the disease can be found in this early stage before it has grown, invaded, and replicated . . there is a good chance for 'cure'. It is only when the disease has grown significantly and begun to 'seed' into the blood stream or lymphatic system in a process called metastasis does cancer become deadly and more diffiuclt to 'cure'. So it is really stage IV cancer that continues to give the most problems in terms of treatment that will lead to cure. Think of it this way . . the earlier a cancer is found, the more likely for treatment to be effective .. the later a cancer is found . . is when treatment may not work. And metastasis is a focus of researchers . . who now have turned to the idea of treating cancer as a 'chronic condition' rather than a 'curable' disease . . there is no 'cure' for diabetes or a host of other diseases either . .but there is treatment to control the disease.|`|ECLYzIXZaa	Just because you think something is true doesn't make it so.You need to find do some research before you make claims like this.|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	No, and the government does not make money on treatment.  They lose money.<br>  <br>  And , yes, some people have been cured.  Early detection is the key.|`|FicyC2TXaa	No, there is no hidden cancer cure, no conspiracy to hide a cancer cure from us. The conspiracy theory is an urban myth, a sort of game played by those who have not had cancer or close experience of it.<br>  <br>  If there were such a conspiracy drug companies would either be keeping quiet about the cure even though it would bring them fame and fortune. Any drug company discovering a cure would make far more money than they can have dreamed of making up till now.<br>  <br>  And doctors, scientists, researchers etc would be watching their relatives die and dying themselves (they and their families develop cancer at the same rate as the rest of the population) rather than revealing the existing secret cure<br>  <br>  And in order to prove that any secret, hidden cure worked, thousands of people would have to have been cured by it. They’d all be keeping quiet too – not a word to the media from any of them either.<br>  <br>  Most unlikely of all, every medical professional in the whole world would have agreed to keep existence of a cure secret. Every single one. One blabbermouth, one disgruntled researcher or sacked nurse and the whole conspiracy’s blown. Newspapers and other media wouldn't have got a sniff of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Which government do you mean? Do you suppose every government in the world is colluding to hide 'the cure'?<br>  <br>  I live in the UK; we don't pay for our medical treatment, including cancer treatment. Cancer treatment costs our government many, many billions. If there were a cure for cancer that would save them this money, believe me that's what we'd be getting. <br>  <br>  We have the same treatments as in the US. Why?  Because although existing treatments aren't perfect - very far from it -  they are all we have at the moment, and we know, because they have been tested and proven in double-blind clinical trials, that they save many lives and prolong many, many more.<br>  <br>  No, there's no guaranteed cure for any cancer. Why? Because  the trouble with finding 'a cure for cancer' is that cancer is hundreds of diseases, not just one. The difficulty is that different cancers are caused by different things, so no one strategy can prevent them, and different cancers respond to different treatments so no one treatment can cure them all. There will never be a magic bullet that cures all cancer. <br>  <br>  And some cancers CAN be cured these days:. 7 out of 10 children are cured of cancer. Testicular cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and many cases of leukaemia can all be cured in adults with chemotherapy, most skin cancers are cured with surgery, and many cases of thyroid cancer and cancer of the larynx are cured with radiotherapy.<br>  <br>  Many other types of cancer are also cured if they are found early enough. There is still a long way to go, especially with some of the commonest types of cancer such as lung, breast, bowel and prostate cancer. But there is dedicated (and underfunded) work going on; there'll never be a Eureka! moment when a single substance or procedure is found that will reverse all types of cancer. But there will continue to be steady progress.

What separates these diet pills from the rest is that they are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are not held to the same standards as prescription and OTC medicines.

TAiQxo5paa	Trojan Magnums are really common to find in drugstores or supermarkets, and at some of them you can do self-checkout, meaning that you don't need to have someone see that you're buying them.<br>  <br>  Also, I'm fairly sure that almost all, if not all, condom websites online ship discreetly without the use of the word "condom" on the packaging and billing.<br>  <br>  I use www.condomdepot.com, and you can read about their discreet shipping here: <a href="http://www.condomdepot.com/info/shipping_info.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.condomdepot.com/info/shipping...</a><br>  Most websites commonly ship using their actual registered company name, not their website.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	What's wrong with Walmart?

tMtBe1lKaa	Valium can be just as addicting. I've never heard of someone actually dying from alcohol withdrawl either.<br>  Can you go to Alcoholics Anonymous? they would probably have some experience with this and the best way to do it. The time before, some of those experiences could have been due to the infection the antibiotics were prescribed for. Get a buddy, drink TONS of water, and talk to an AA leader or your doc. You may try a rehab hotline as well. best of luck!|`|XEKvJzGaaa	You are an alcoholic. The alcohol is only 5% of your problem. If you want to stay sober from now on you should consider going into a treatment center. You will learn much about yourself that you never considered before.

bTfR8OnDaa	Yes, I think you have a case on late on-set asthma. For the longest time I didn't make the connection between shortness and breath and asthma. I thought I was just out of shape... but it got to the point where I would gasp for breath. I have a co-worker who has asthma and dust particles make it worse. They get trapped in the lungs and make it hard to breathe. You should go to a different doctor. I recently had a case of bronchistis and my asthma was flaring up. I was wheezing. They gave me a breathing treatment, and prescribed me a rescue inhaler to use when I am having difficulties taking proper breaths.|`|yVk590JGaa	I've heard the same story and I believe that is asthmatic. All you would get from clinic or hospital is the inhaler medication. This wont help in the long run.<br>  <br>  Recently, I recommended VERVE, a healthy drink with antioxidant to my asthamatic friend. The result is not immediate, but his asthmatic problem seem to be reducing. Wy not give a try.
BNAzjSO1aa	Because you have a cold and are suffering from congestion the pain is due to the fact that the pressure in your inner ear has not adjusted as it would do normally after a flight. Try chewing some gum or sucking a lolly they might help if not decongestants may help as well

IVlXrZ2Xaa	Hi,<br>    To be honest i am appalled by some of the answers you've been getting. Why becuase you have a mental illness would you not be a good Dr, that's crap. I'm a medical student in the UK and i suffer from clinical depression. Mental health problems are exceedingly common in the medical profession. And who knows in some respects it may make you a beter Dr, you will have an understanding of patients that other Drs cannot even come close to.<br>    In regards to studying, take small steps. When i'm my worst  i see all my works as an unclimbable mountain, something i can never get on top of. But if i do just a little work everyday, even when i'm feeling absolutely shite, things do get done. Then on better days i can work harder and know that i have achieved something. I miss alot of classes, but i find that if i miss one i have to tell myself not to give up and go back to bed that i should go to the rest of them that day. <br>    Maybe try changing your psych if you find he's not doing stuff in your best interest?<br>    Good luck for the future and don't listen to the small minded bigots in the world. xxx|`|deebXXoHaa	why so blue panda bear?|`|8012427537078e29822bf1bd1e533dfaaa	Hi there Martinisa. Im sorry but you have no business being a doctor or a healthcare worker period. I would not let you near me with a 10 foot pole with that condition. If you are not 100% at your best, you owe it to yourself and your patients to remove yourself from patient care. If it is affecting your grades, it will affect your patients. Don't get me wrong, I am not against you. I wish you good health and prosperity. But, you need to find a different profession, that does not involve anything sharp! Find a different doctor, it takes time and a lot of trial and error to get the meds right in your circumstance.|`|aa382d783c7d775e7642f723203a2199aa	I also suffer from depression and some other mental illness although not the others you mentioned but I certainly understand the desire not to want to pursue things like you do. The feeling of apathy that just wont go away and although this certainly wont solve all your problems I suggest a few things. 1. A possible change of medication(the depression one) as increases the dosage doesn't help if the drug itself isn't working. If your shrink fights you on this one then if possible seek a second opinion. Just because someone is a shrink doesn't automatically make them right and going with your gut on whether certain drugs work in my experience has been usually right. Secondly and more importantly do you speak to your shrink as a therapy or are they mainly just giving you drugs and little talking? If the latter is true insist or find a shrink that will talk to you rather than just be a drug dispenser. Ideally they should be both but often it doesn't seem to work that way. Spill your guts to a professional(psychologists rather than psychiatrists are better at this because they do this rather than having anything to do with drugs but I understand if it's not possible to see both if income doesn't permit it). Now thirdly, sometimes in your life things are just too much at the time, college in the end can be put on hold and returned to if things get to extremes where it hinders getting better. This is just an extreme measure but I want you to know it's an option rather than feeling you can either push yourself beyond what you may be able to now or quit completely!|`|Pp42qmFhaa	If truth is to be told, the fact is that Bipolar disorder will not allow you to have the same level of academic excellence than most other people can. I am telling you from my experience and the fact is that I never reached the same level of academic performance than my pairs. I am Bipolar II and all I have done is just: <br>  <br>  1.- I was born in a foreign country - in a 7,500 people village <br>  2.- Attended the  best uni from my country   <br>  3.- Graduated top <br>  4.- I was 22 when I went for a year to Scandinavia and enrolled in two unis (Graduate level) at the same time. Did excellent in exams. <br>  5.- Got an internship in a very selective International Organization in Switzerland when I was 24 (far more selective than UN, so you get an idea). <br>  6.- I got the Fulbright Scholarship, <br>  7.- Doing the Master's degree right now in a top uni in the USA, and <br>  8.- Having outstanding results so far. <br>  <br>  Now you can see what I mean. We are not in the same league than 'average-people-. Our genetics have given us more chances to have a fatalistic life and yet more chances of being much better. We are extreme and it is in our nature. <br>  <br>  My advice: accept what you are and pay no attention to people telling you that you cannot make it. Be proud of being Bipolar II. I am. <br>  <br>  Kind Regards, <br>  M<br>  <br>  Drop me an e mail if you want.

(well not really but close enough)<br>  <br>  you need more protein, how about an egg? or some chicken or fish?<br>  youll lose weight, and overeat(lets say this whole day x 3? )once a week at least so you dont build a plateua and stop weightloss, and so you dont start wasting away too much muscle. <br>  <br>  also try eating some veggies inbetween the 3 meals, they barely add to your calorie amt.|`|AA12144656	I can understand that you are not wanting to eat much, but this is'nt nearly enough for your body.  Healthy eating does not mean hardly eating all day long, in fact this is un-healthy!  Your body requires food most of the day, like a car with gasoline.  If your car is running our of fuel, you pull into the station and fill it up!<br>     More food is required, and if it is healthy then you won't have to worry about it, as your body will use it for fuel.  Think of food as fuel, a necessary thing.<br>    Your breakfast needs to be more solid food and yorgurt can be eaten inbetween breakfast and lunch.  Try some oatmeal or a healthy cold cereal and a banana and fruit, then have the yogurt inbetween breakfast and lunch.<br>     For lunch a good sandwich with wheat bread would be great, or some chicken with broccoli and a potatoe.  For dinner eat something similiar.  To be healthy food is required and without it you will feel tired and run down, and depression sets in.<br>     To be healthy is to move around too, try doing something outside or some kind of exercise daily, as this has been proven to relieve depression, yoga even.<br>     Hope some of this helps, remember being "healthy" is really taking care of yourself, not starving yourself.|`|2qEBzxX2aa	Don't listen to the guy who said to try acai berry.  You don't need to worry about burning calories.  You need to worry about getting/being healthy.  <br>  <br>  That being said, there is not enough protein in that "diet" that you have suggested.  Try adding 1 egg to the breakfast, some kind of white meat (turkey, chicken) to the lunch and then turkey or chicken again at dinner.  Chicken breast (skinless) when grilled have less fat than anything and they are good for you.<br>  <br>  Adding protein is the most important part.  I understand that you have a disease and are trying to get over it. Start with the diet you have but do try to add in some meat or even cheese or egg.

I imagine the specialist will arrange for you to have a colonoscopy - a procedure where a tube containing a tiny camera is used to have a look at the large bowel and biopsies can be taken if anything abnormal is seen.   Causes of bleeding from the bowel include haemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) as well as tumours.    Sorry but there's probably not much you can usefully do about this yourself other than waiting to see the specialist to have further tests...hopefully you won't have to wait long for this.   If it's taking very long you should contact your GP to get them to chase things up with the hospital.|`|I9tpJY4Maa	it sounds like a condition called diverticulitis and your gp should have you on antibiotics i had the same symptoms and did nothing about it and ended up in hosp for 6 days on a drip of very strong antibiotics and nothing to eat for 3 days i suggest you mention this condition to your gp asap hope it all goes well
bvYPr0Cvaa	My husband had a rash that was kinda like the way you described. He had it for close to 3 years, it started on the inside of his thighs and eventually spread all over his waist and legs, it was extremely itchy, he tried everything to make it go away, but nothing worked. The doctor he went to see said it was just the laundry detergent we used causing it, so we switched brands (think we tried about every brand out there) but he still had the rash. So he went to a different doctor and this doctor told him that it was a fungus, he prescribed some kind of pills and a type of antifungal body wash. He did the treatment and it went away. So i would suggest getting it checked out by a doctor, because if it is the same thing as he had, it's only going to get worse. We don't have health insurance either, but our health is too important, we shouldn't let the fact that we don't have health insurance stop us from being healthy and happy. Most doctors will let you work out a payment plan with them.

9edc5077057569352822a821adc48204aa	I work in a psychiatric hospital as a clinical social worker and see post partum women all the time.  You can definitely have post partum depression 6 months after giving birth.  Although you say you proved the doctor wrong about your past diagnosis, having had a history of mild depression and anxiety makes you at an increased risk of having post partum depression after giving birth, both because of the sleep problems that come with having an infant as well as the hormonal fluctuations...<br>  <br>  If you are crying daily and feel like giving up on motherhood these should be huge clues to you that you need to do something about these symptoms NOW.  Giving up on breastfeeding in exchange for getting decisive treatment would be a good decision on your part, both for you and your baby.<br>  <br>  I give you a lot of credit for trying to struggle though this without medication, but given your current situation it's time to re-evaluate things.  Your baby needs for you to be mentally healthy and you need it for yourself too.<br>  <br>  And post partum depression is one of the most obvious needs for biological intervention I can think of... poor sleep and hormones aren't things you can talk yourself out of.<br>  <br>  Your baby needs for you to turn around the emotional disengagement you may be experiencing now due to your emotional state.  Please reconsider getting medication and psychological help.|`|aXYiOskmaa	you've kind of answered your own question. you have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression already. your hormones have thrown everything out of whack and made it worse. do yourself and your babe a favor and see your doctor. i know you don't want to stop nursing but whats worse?, the baby not nursing or the baby having an unhealthy, unhappy mom?|`|U4JEgNPNaa	Yes, it certainly can.

It has been recognized by the NIH and the World Health Organization for the treatment of many diseases including (but not limited to) back pain, nausea, headache pain, women's health issues and stress related conditions.<br>  <br>  Why do people use acupuncture? In ancient times, acupuncturists were also known as barefoot doctors who walked from village to village and provided healing. It was a treat to get acupuncture.<br>  <br>  In modern times, acupuncture is often effective where Western Medicine falls short. Acupuncture is a wonderful healing modality for improving quality of life. It is successful at treating the side effects caused by chemotherapy. It has been used in hospice work.<br>  <br>  People suffering from chronic illness, such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue find that their lives are better. People with arthritis find a great deal of relief. Patients with progressive diseases such as Parkinsons and MS find that their symptoms are less severe and their progression slows when treated by an acupuncturist regularly.<br>  <br>  Other types of problems, such as headache pain, pain from a trauma, and digestive issues can have all symptoms cured with regular treatments. Women's health issues frequently respond well to acupuncture.<br>  <br>  Acupuncture helps bring balance back into a person's body. Science hasn't been able to qualify exactly how acupuncturists do this but the fact remains that scientific evidence supports that something did happen when the needles were placed in the body.

It's a darn nusience but can be controlled.<br>  Good luck.|`|imWxnK2saa	Try to change your diet. IBS can be caused by fruit, soda, milk/cheese, chocolate(caffeine),cigarettes (nicotine products).

IBS is not a life threatening disease. To deal with it, you need to eliminate the food or drink that 'triggers' it off. In my case it is caffeine, so coffee is off the menu for me.

d331e25a3bf2fa5d4adc840b4fb3276caa	Well, the way I see things is that I can always get a new job. My husband comes first. The thing is, everyone puts their priorities in different places. You are going to have to weigh how important it is for him to go to SA with how important your friends and job are to you. If this is life's ambition, something he must do to be happy, and you truly love him and want him to be happy, then it might be easier for you to make the sacrifice. But it can work the other way, too. From what you've described, I'd say it does sound like you should go to SA with him. But only you can make that call. You both need to weigh your priorities. Is this so important to him that he can handle you being saddened by your loss of everything you know? Do you love him enough to make the sacrifice? Good luck...|`|333JXoLEaa	Sounds like you should follow him.  If you are madly in love with him, he's good to you, you have no family here, you should go.

If he is your fiance then it will be an opportunity to meet his family (which is probably what he wants) and for you to see how your relationship works away from your Country. Sometimes guys are very different in their own environment and dont treat you as nice when you are away from everyone who cares for you and on your own. Be careful. Make sure you have your return ticket and your passport kept somewhere safe that he cant touch, just in case. Im not trying to scare you, just make you be aware. If all goes well and he wants to remain then you can make your decision easier about whether or not to finish your career with the US salon your work at. If it isnt what you want, tell him you love him but that he met you in your Country and formed the relationship there and it isnt right for him to ask you to give it all up.<br>  <br>  Good luck and always be one step ahead of men. They arent nice forever.

zg7myZiBaa	well, i'm not farmilliar with all the patterns because I mostly use to 'weight loss' setting. But the truth is, any of these ones will help you lose weight. The only thing is, the ones who have a higher resistance level will make you build muscle faster, like bulk up rather than toning. Just think of it like lifting weights. If you want to burn arm fat, then you want to lift smaller weights and just do more reps. if you want to bulk bulky muscles, then you're going to lift heavier weights for less reps. <br>  It's bassically just muscle endurance vs. muscular strength.<br>  <br>  Edit; muscular endurance (lower resistance for longer period of time) will not only help you burn fat, but definetely help you be healthier in general. This will primarily help your heart distribute blood better to your body. You'll just have a better energy level.

7hWEiTQUaa	Yes it is. Since there is such an emphasis on the sexuliation of women in today's world, young women are going to feel a ton of pressure to conform to what the world considers to be the "ideal" image. Many young women don't have the metabolism or build to conform to this image, and being so desperate to be accepted and considered beautiful they will take extreme measures, such as an eating disorder. In fact, one in three girls will suffer from an eating disorder at some time in their lives. I think that especially young kids need to be reminded that just because they aren't the "ideal" they are still beautiful in their own unique ways, and that is what makes them truly special.|`|oojO4WAraa	It might contribute in some cases, but a lot of people have low self esteem and are not anorexic.

I still have some muscle aches etc. but that should lessen overtime. I had the XLIF surgery because I could not function from the pain.

Get a cold pack (a freezer pack wrapped in a towel is fine but you want cold not freezing on your actual skin) and a hot pack (hot water bottle, wheat germ bag heated in the microwave). Put the cold pack on the area for two minutes, then swap for the hot pack for 2 minutes, then 2 more cold, 2 more hot and finally 2 more cold. Changing between the two helps to get the toxins pushed away from the area and calms things down.<br>  3 - Exercises to improve your core muscles.

Inversion therapy uses the effects of gravity to weight down your spine and stretch it out.  As this happens your spine is allowed to decompress and as that happens it relieves the pinched nerves in your spine.  Inversion therapy causes your muscles of your core (the hips, thighs, buttocks, back muscles and most importantly the stomach muscles) to stretch out.  As they stretch the knots and spasms leave and when these muscles are all relaxed they loosen their grip on your lower back muscles, your spine and most importantly your pelvis, allowing them to go back into natural alignment.  As they align this will cause your sciatica to vanish.  It's like if your car is out of alignment it pulls to one side and screws up the tires, it's the same with your back.  Inversion therapy will help align your spine and relieve your pain and decompress that painful disc.  Hope this helps.

LDlrJNX5aa	I hear you, I'm in the same boat, trying to change my diet to a healthier one. The people in my home buy and eat junk foods all the time, and even my boyfriend's parents will buy it and give it to us as "groceries". I know it's bad and there are all the good reasons in the world that I know I shouldn't eat it, but I still get tempted. I agree with the lady who said it comes down to willpower. I realized that the junk food is always going to be there my whole life, and I have the choice to eat it and be sick or not eat it and be healthy, it's just not an easy choice. I always have healthy foods around for myself and that way I always have something to eat if I need a snack instead of junk food.<br>  Are there any fruits/veggies that you really enjoy? Like strawberries for example, or pineapple, perhaps, really yummy healthy things, you could get some and have them around and then it's still a treat and you won't feel deprived. I find I am most vulnerable when I feel deprived. I tell myself, "no, it's not you who is deprived, but if you eat that you will deprive yourself of health and feeling good".<br>  I also find drinking hot herbal tea helps fill my stomach and gives a "comfort" feeling instead of comfort food.<br>  I wish you the best with this. It is a challenge, but you can do it!|`|rpf1xrfzaa	1. Allow yourself to eat the foods you want. If you deny yourself the "naughty" foods, you'll only want them more.

If they want to have one day where they have cake and pizza, so be it. One day won't hurt any of you, but if they're eating poorly all the time, you should discuss with them your desire to eat better foods. Offer to prepare meals for the family and go grocery shopping.

Choose a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast instead of the pizza. Consciously say to yourself 'no, i shouldn't eat that' and make an alternate, healthier choice instead. <br>  <br>  A guy in my office has a big jar full of candy in his office. I used to go in and grab a couple of chocolates in the afternoon as a snack. Now, I try to make sure that I have an apple or yogurt or something else to snack on so I don't have to resort to that candy.<br>  <br>  Oh, and a word about the free trial on acai berry supplement -- I'm not gonna knock the benefits of acai berry b/c I really don't know anything about it. BUT I am gonna knock the 'free' trial. Read the T&C first. They'll bill your cc $80 for it after 14 days. And then after 30 days, they'll automatically send you a new supply & bill your cc again.

Nc7clhzIaa	Ok, I have searched around for myself & I found that mypyramid.gov is very beneficial in taking decent, healthy steps to losing weight/maintaining a certain weight @ a safe rate.  What you do is plug in what kind of foods you are eating & it balances out how much you should be taking in of protein, dairy, iron, etc. and it highlights what you need to take out of your diet/daily meals.  It takes a few minutes but it is so specific it is the best nutritional info. I found for myself & I got my info. from a dietitician at my school.  Hope it helps!  P.S.  Bodyspace.com & bodybuilding.com are great websites to plug in a forum/blog about yourself or just feedback for general questions like that.  You wouldn't believe how many people including myself who just want to be tone & firm w/o that extra bulk of muscle.  Many people on there are trained professionals & give great advice.

7srTqyjgaa	Good for you for making such progress.  Your true friends will love you no matter what.  Nothing has to change in your relationships.  They should feel happy that you are coming into a stronger self, and they will get to know the new you.  Who you are isn't changing.  You'll always be the same person on the inside, just more confident.  It's not like your undergoing some huge personality change, just a confidence and outlook change. Treat your friends well, and don't worry about losing them.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Which is more important -- your own personal health and well-being, or your friends?<br>  <br>  ANY lifestyle change will cost you some friends.  You are going to find that you have some friend who like WHAT you are, but not WHO you are.  These are called "fair weather friends".  you ARE going to loose them.<br>  <br>  But what is MORE important is that you will gain new friends to replace them, and with your new self-confidence you will find that you are less attracted to shallow, insignificant people and more attracted to true, solid, life-long friends.<br>  <br>  The friends you are going to lose are not true friends.  In fact, some of them are probably the reason you are the way you are now.  You are more concerned with impressing friends than with doing what is right.  These "friends" are people who you like, but they really don't like you -- they only "tolerate" you.  So you waste your time and energy trying to impress them, when they really don't care!<br>  <br>  You NEED to get rid of these "fair weather friends", and you NEED to get the new, solid friends.<br>  <br>  So don't worry about who leaves and who stays.  Your friends will take care of themselves, and you will be a better person because of it.|`|6K1D6Azmaa	Life is about change. When people change, they sometimes have less in common with their old friends.

da28cfd4d81aff76ceb6826e12c7ced0aa	Well your mouth will be numb for a couple of hours after the extraction. You aren't supposed to chew gum cause it can cause a suction and unclog the clot in the hole left from the extraction. You also can't drink carbonated water. <br>  <br>  Otherwise you don't feel any pain after the numbness goes away. The dentist will probably tell you to take over the counter pain relievers if you do feel any pain but you usually won't.<br>  <br>  It will take several days before the hole starts to close and after wards you'll be just fine except you'll be one tooth short.|`|UTA4G5rTaa	First, FOLLOW ALL POST OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS!!!! If you smoke, refrain from it for at least 48 hours! Something they never told me, sounds rediculous, but be careful when blowing your nose and try not to spit or suck through a straw or anything.After two days, rinse with warm salt water, 1/4 teaspoon to a cup 3-4 times a day for three days. This helps in the healing process!<br>  You will be numb for a while, maybe a couple of hours or so. they will give you some gauze to bite on, make sure not to bite with too much pressure! It's kind of hard when your mouth is numb!<br>   It all depends on if the extraction is surgical or not. I just had a surgical extraction and they tend to be sore for a couple of days.<br>  After the extraction, it can be painful, not unbearable, however, this is trauma to your jaw, and where their once was a tooth, now theirs not, so I would expect some pain, but don't be afraid to ask for help with the pain, like medication! Good luck! But you should be fine!!<br>  <br>  Dental assistant|`|7UQUkhjZaa	I would imagine it won't be painful during the extraction - they probably won't have you sedated completely, but you should have enough local anesthetic to be aware of what's going on but not feel anything.  Afterwards, take your pain medication as prescribed and any antibiotics (if they give you any).  It will probably be slightly painful afterwards,  even with the pain meds.  Just imagine the trauma your mouth has gone through with a tooth being pulled - it'll be uncomfortable, a little painful, and probably a little swollen.  Don't drink through a straw, and don't smoke.  Take it easy - don't go eating taffy, caramel, or anything else requiring lots of chewing.  <br>  <br>  Good luck... write down any questions you have left and be sure to ask the dentist before your procedure.|`|760742cf4d5e0a51a5eaf85329717412aa	It is not painful to have a tooth pulled, they numb you really good so you don't feel pain but you will feel the pressure. After they pull it, they'll  have you bite down on gauze for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. If it is sore afterwards, you can take Tylenol or use a heating pad. Just remember to keep your mouth clean and rinse with salt water. When you brush your teeth, rinse gently and let the water run out, you dont have to spit hard. <br>  <br>  Oh, and you might want to take an Ipod or radio with headphones to the dentists to take your mind off of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|yr5W0xS3aa	U can ask the dentist

zD0V9nQraa	You will be asked back by a nurse.<br>  Your weight will be recorded.<br>  You will then be escorted to a exam room and your blood pressure and temperature will be taken.<br>  The nurse may ask personal medical questions and go over any health concerns you may have.<br>  You will then be asked to undress removing all articles of clothing including bra and panties . The nurse will offer you a gown and a sheet. Once you are dressed in the gown you may be seated on exam table and place the sheet on your lap to help you feel not so vunerable.<br>  The nurse willleave the room letting you know the doctor will be in soon.<br>  When the Doctor returns he will greet you and introduce him/herself.<br>  A nurse will be in the room during the exam. He or she will ask you to you what brings you in today? you will discuss any concerns you may have and answer any questions you may have.<br>  After the answering of your questions you will be asked to lie back. The doctor will perform a breast exam which consists of you lying on the table with arms above your head. Your breasts will be examined for any unusual lumps, or soreness.<br>  The doctor will then feel around your abdomen. After checking your abdomen you will be asked to scoot your bottom to the end of the table and place your feet in the stirups. You will be asked to allow your legs to fall to the sides with your feet remaining in the stirrups.<br>  At this time the doctor will examine the outer genital area. Dont worry the nurse will be present. Your doctor will then lubricate a speculum and slowly insert it into your vagina. The speculum is used to open the vaginal walls to help gain visibility inside the vagina. The Doctor will then open the speculum and adjust the light so that it provides adequate lighting inside the vagina. The Doctor will then use a swab to gather some cells from your cervix. These cells will be sent to the lab  for testing. The speculum will then be removed.The Doctor will then lubricate the fingers on their glove and insert one or two fingers inside the vagina while using the hand outside pressing down above the pelvic bone. This portion of the exam is now complete.<br>  Some Doctors may choose to do a rectal exam which consists of inserting one finger inside your rectum to feel for hemmoroids or other abnormalities.<br>  At this time you will be asked if you have any questions and given a tissue to wipe off any excess lubricant used during exam.<br>  The Doctor will then leave the room allowing you to get dressed. He will reenter room once you are dressed to provide you with information concerning recieving your pap smear results and give you any prescriptions he or she may be prescribing.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|VV2BZvlLaa	pap smear<br>  a breast exam<br>  <br>  & she will ask you lots of questions
3mAgM405aa	Anal sex is quite enjoyable and will take some preprep before engaging in it.<br>  <br>  Begin by:<br>  <br>  1. Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kD8iggyCaa	2 hours is enough

9edc5077057569352822a821adc48204aa	They are very related; a little less than half of people with depression also have some type of addiction problem.<br>  <br>  When you drink, in the first hour after you drink you are stimulating the release of hormones into your nervous system that will make you feel pretty good...that's why you have the compulsion to drink...you know it'll make you feel better pretty quickly.  And when you are feeling upset or down and just can't stand that feeling, drinking seems like the quick fix.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it's a little like withdrawing lots of cash from an ATM machine...it's pretty cool to have all that money but sooner or later the machine empties out, and when you have no cash anymore, it feels pretty bad.<br>  <br>  And so it goes with the alcohol.  Once you get that rush from the release of the "feel good" hormones, you've kind of bankrupted your supply...not much left.  So then your body and central nervous system feels the depletion of "feel good" chemicals, and so the depression comes back worse than ever.<br>  <br>  And that's why alcohol is actually a depressant drug...because, despite the initial good feeling, within an hour or so you will be at a severe low level of feel good chemicals in your central nervous system.<br>  <br>  You have to stop drinking in order to get your depression symtoms under control.<br>  <br>  And it takes more than stopping your drinking.  Because as a user of alcohol, you've used alcohol as a way of coping with anger and sadness and frustration and lonliness.  And so, if you don't learn some new ways to deal with those feelings, you'll always go back to drinking.<br>  <br>  So try to get help from "dual diagnosis" resources that treat both the alcoholism and depression at the same time.|`|220b497f9a511b5df0fff475b46096ffaa	The two often go hand in hand.

For example, it could be a kidney infection or urinary tract infection.  See another Dr if you're embarrassed, although everyone gets embarrassing problems, and GPs are immune to embarrassment!  Your mum will have to believe you if the Gp says you've got something wrong, and you will spend less time off school if you feel better.

AA10723498	Most definitely.  If he was intimate with another woman before you who had the yeast infection, then he can pass it on to you.  If he continues to give it to you, he should be checked himself.  It doesn't matter how much he showers, if that fungus is present in him, he will pass it on to you.  If you take an antibiotic, make sure you finish all of it.  That's so important.  Too many ppl don't finish them when they start to feel better than wonder why an infection has returned.  When you finish, it means the bacteria, fungus is gone.  That's why Dr's will specify a certain amount of days because it means it takes that many days to kill off the infection no matter what it is.  Good luck|`|hlYZeY4vaa	Yes, guys can be carriers of yeast infections, but I would go get checked out just in case. If some of the other girls he was with had this, then maybe he could be spreading around a little more than yeast infections. Best of luck.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	discover below all info about yeast infection|`|ff633d5c0a70cfd301d2a35d0b10250faa	This could be more than yeast infection. Go get this checked out to be on the safe side.

eS4WU4Oaaa	Agreed with the person at the top. (:<br>  <br>  Stay away from fast food!<br>  But if you are going there with your friends, or family or are just really hungry, there is always options that you can get, I will admit there isn't a lot but there is some! If you go into Mc Donald's, don't think your being good by having a salad because its got lots of added sugar! Try a chicken burger that has been seared, not fried! Anything that has been processed stay away from! It was processed for a reason.<br>  <br>  Start walking. Walking will make a huge difference to your weight loss! Got a notebook (I am serious, buy one or find a piece of paper of something!!) and write down how far you walked each day. Everyday you need to increase how much you walk, even if it is only 30 seconds! (try for longer). Making a goal for each day is also key, you should never start a workout/activity without a plan and a goal! A goal could just be as simple as saying "I am going to power walk for 20 seconds".<br>  <br>  Also, make an overall goal apart from losing 50 pounds! Make a goal that by the end of it you will be able to fit into a dress or you will go for a walk and not be as tired in June! You need to make small little goals to achieve your main target! Because of you make small goals, and you achieve one every week, you will get happier and no your going some where!<br>  <br>  Don't pretend like your going to go on a diet, a lot of people do, but give it up straight away because its like taking cigarettes away from a smoker! You can't take things away from somebody and not expect them to miss it. You need to eat in moderation, you can have whatever you want, just in moderation. If you are having french fries with your dinner (Always baked!), take a small handful off and give them to someone else. If you have a chocolate bar, have a couple of pieces and leave the rest! I highly recommend staying away from these foods: White bread, chocolate related food or drinks, candy, anything fried!<br>  <br>  One more thing, stay away from high sugared food or drinks. One more suggestion, if you are going to have a coke, replace it with water. If your going to have a muffin, replace it with fruit.<br>  <br>  I promise this is the last thing before you get annoyed with me, you need to have breakfast every morning without fail! It starts your metabolism. And also, if you think your being good by missing a meal, bad idea! You need to have 3 main meals, and 2 snacks (fruit and a cracker?). Also have a cut off point of when you will stop eating! Try this, every night at 8pm you won't eat anything until you wake up, not even a grape! You will see massive differences if you do this within a month!<br>  <br>  Helpful? =]<br>  <br>  email me of you have questions! alejandro_1210@hotmail.com|`|jVosSk1taa	I don't know if you're a vegetarian?!

You would need to restrict your calorie intake while eating mostly real foods like meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables of all kinds, with smaller quantities of whole grains. You will also need do a LOT of exercise of all types, such as cardio, resistance training, and yoga.

60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Ahhhh, something I know a little about!!!<br>  <br>  I had one of these that showed up during my 1st pregnancy.  When I was 7 months pregnant (on Christmas eve of all days) I had to go in for emergency surgery to have it removed.  It kept growing and growing and finally got to the point that I couldn't even walk.  After that, all was good.  2 1/2 years later I got pregnant again and it came back.  Smaller this time but my doctor surgically removed it again after I delivered my son (didn't even know what he was doing, thanks to the epidural).  I still have some tenderness there now, a year later, with certain sexual positions.  I really need to get this checked out again.  I know vulva cancer is very rare but I also know that mine was never sent to the lab for a biopsy either.  And, no, it's not necessarily from an STD or STI.  They can be but not always.  I swear mine must be hormone related b/c pregnancy is the only time it has given me problems.  The other mild pain I mentioned is only during *that* time of the month.  I'm convinced hormones have something to do w/ this.<br>  <br>  From what I've read though, it is NOTHING to worry about!!|`|oojO4WAraa	You should google "Bartholin's gland cyst" and learn about it.  That way you won't make yourself crazy imagining things like it is going to turn to cancer.

USoqyjaAaa	Yes, you can get it more than once, but you cannot catch it from someone with shingles.  It is a reactivation of a chickenpox infection, usually years ago.  So there is no reason to avoid contact.  Somone who has never had chickenpox does have a small chance of getting chickenpox from her, however.|`|Mb7PP53Xaa	I had shingles twice, nasty business.<br>  So to answer your question Yes it can be caught twice<br>  it can be gotten from someone with chicken pox too.|`|uJDCoXH9aa	Yes.|`|HrDcaocMaa	ABSOLUTELY!!!!  I know people who have gotten it 3 times|`|ea688e0ee7ebc6fe5eaaffcf5e7e80e2aa	Once you have had shingles the virus lays domant and it can rewaken many times..basically you are prone to having it once you've had it. Avoiding other with chicken pox and shingles is wise but not always possible.|`|LQvvZ5EHaa	yes, shingles can be gotten more than once.|`|xCqNTjGLaa	i got told off my doctor no when i had it but i honestly couldnt tell you|`|ocHnc2Nbaa	yes ,there is no limit to the amount of times you can get it|`|w29tsXLUaa	I would imagine you could.

fTztIC22aa	At the park, if you run on a treadmill the treadmill sets the pace. If you run at the park you get fresh air, plus you get to set your own pace which your body is naturally comfortable with.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	its down to preference really. It takes more effort to run outside than it does on the treadmill but some people dont want to run outside|`|FWMnop6oaa	Well on the treadmill incline can be easily changed, you can watch TV, you can easily monitor how far/fast your going and you won't be hit by a frisbee. At the park you can accelerate and deccelerate without pressing buttons, if you are on grass then you will do less damage to your knees than if you are on a treadmill and its fun to run in the fresh air. Its personal preferance really over winter I have only used the treadmill because its to cold and its hard to run in 10 inches of snow.|`|tCNP6bbeaa	treadmill tells u how much calories u lost but disadv is u being inside a room or gym. park...fresh air, joggers.. seems to be better if u can motivate urself going out and doing it.Do it in the morning if planning park thing.evening caries more pollution along.|`|e4ebc08557e7843458d66e6d4375e253aa	Just run. It's all good for you, but I prefer to run outside.|`|SaOLhaPYaa	i run outside cause i love the outdoors|`|uwaAcgyiaa	The park is best, but try to run on the grass if possible as vibration from the raod can cause splints on your shins (though this is rare unless you are doing it alot).... the treadmill is ok as long as its from time to time, because your posture when running on a treadmill is totally different than when actually physically running on a road or surface and so can cause back problems in the long run... so park is always better :))
I40iBJdHaa	some people are more sensitive than others. try rubbing yourself through your underwear, that's how i started!|`|DErBSfZgaa	Yes its because your too sensitive. and ofcourse it's meant to be touched. every women works differently when it comes to masturbating so don't worry about it.|`|l1UwQRBTaa	Maybe you are too sensitive or the little piece thats most sensitive is more out, there is a more sensitive bit that can sometimes feel uncomfortable to touch.<br>  <br>  I dont think your too sensitive, maybe you need to change your technique|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	Yours sounds really sensitive and yep that is okay.|`|zz15M6vQaa	Runels?
dkEUJPhnaa	First of all I think you need to find motivation to concentrate on your homework and school work because this will gradually expand your knowledge in areas which in turn will make you have a better chance to get good grades and then get you a good job. There is no point in worrying about how 'talentless' you are - you have the ability to develop your skills which will make you realize that there is hope. Maybe you could talk to a teacher about improving things and don't care what anybody else thinks. You are in school for the purpose of getting far in life and if you want things to change you need to act now. Try not to talk to these 'smart' friends either - it's only making you feel inferior to them making you reflect upon yourself. You are unique in your own special way, and if it takes you a little longer to re-gain the motivation you need then so be it. Stop focusing on what everyone else is doing and start looking at you. I also think it's good if you change your thinking pattern to a more positive view as it's obvious you think you're useless. I believe that you can do anything you want to with a bit of hope and determination. If you're not getting focused because you have no job then look in local newspapers, go to your local job centre and ask about. If you start from the bottom and work yourself up to the top you will know instantly that it's all been worth it. This is your life, therefore make the most out of it and make changes now.|`|59b1fddc617491e538d31b5a8aa3904aaa	Many lazy people resort to alcohol and drugs to give them a sense of superiority and accomplishment .<br>   It is certainly easier at first than work and actual accomplishments.

Then I would use that money and start a new sport.  I would recommend Karate or another type of martial art.

d53eb480285c0502d45e38b33b8b27cfaa	My best advice for you is to eat more protein and cut back on the carbohydrates.  Particularly at night.  Have protein shake after you work out and another before bedtime.  Good luck.

AA10723498	It can't actually hit the bladder since it's closed off from your cervix.  If your bladder is full, you can feel the pressure from it.  Otherwise, he can't hit it.  Also, if he is larger than most men, you may still feel that pressure from his penis because the bladder is so close to the cervix, but like I said, the bladder is closed off so don't worry.|`|hlYZeY4vaa	Yeah, I have heard of a man hitting the cervix and the bladder.

Don't let your partner just go at it, because this is what causes tearing.  <br>  <br>  This type of activity does open you and your partner up for infection, especially if the tearing is making you bleed.

So, when you say it's around your Endometrius, that can't help someone determine what you may be having pain from. But, if it's lower on your body, when your thigh and vagina come together, you could have pulled a groin muscle. Those types of injuries are pretty common, especially from athletic types, due to fact that they either didn't stretch or didn't stretch carefully. Your bladder is located below your bellybutton close to the top of the vagina in the middle. Since it's in on your left side, it could be that you are about to start your menstrual cycle, or you may have an ovarian cyst. Urinary Tract Infections can also cause pain. You may pain in the bladder and around your ovaries where the ureters are. When it's your lower abdomen (this is actually more accurate when it's your right side due to fact that your appendix is there) it becomes a little bit more difficult to determine what's wrong without first doing some additional tests. Try and heating pad, but don't keep it on past 10 minutes or so. You can also soak in a hot bath, buy the Heat strips from CVS, WalGreens, etc. those can last up to 6 hours. You just peel the back off of them and place it over where it hurts. However I wouldn't do that if it's your groin muscle. It may get in the vagina and that could be painful. Make sure you are checking for blood in the urine, it would be an orange color, keep track of how many times you urinate and the amount of urine output. Also, the intestine is also in your lower abdomen. So that could also be a concern, you could have an infection in the intestines. Make sure that you keep track of bowel movements and how much you go. Also, look at your stool and see if there is any blood or mucous in the stool. Make sure you do not have a fever and keep checking. If it gets worse go to the emergency room. If it's not better in the next day or so, make an appointment with your doctor.|`|Xlb8QPj9aa	Are you taking on any "extra curricular" activities or are you just trying to "broaden" your horizons ?|`|IkAtIQumaa	Visit your gynecologist.

Enjoy.<br>  they are not non-smokers then.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	They're rude.<br>  I've been smoking for 50 years and now suffer severe consequences because of it.  I strongly urge you to quit while it still wouldn't be too difficult for you to do so.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	It takes a strong person in this climate of hate about smoke.  To smoke a fag.|`|OH9GRLnLaa	First of all THUMBS UP TO YOU for your question!!!  I am a smoker. As much as I wish I wasn't it is very hard to quit.  I live in Illinois and they passed the law about not smoking in public places.  I am sick of everyone crying about that crap.  I understand people not wanting you to smoke in a restaurant.  Being a smoker I don't like people smoking around me when I am trying to eat, but the one thing that really ticks me off is not being able to go to a bar have a beer, watch the nascar race, and have a smoke.  Its a bar for crying out loud.  I have seen non smokers go to the bar and have a beer and a smoke(the ones that aren't crying about this stupid crap)  You are right when you say even if you move away from the door they still stand around you and criticize you for smoking.  Well to them I say then get the he** away from me.  What more do they want.  I am with you ....    Best of Luck getting anywhere with them..  They just don't get it.|`|hhFp7jZSaa	If they dont have to breathe your smoke their just being self rightous by complaining,and they must enjoy that,or they wouldint do it.Quit though,even if you dont see the health affects for a while yet it will ruin your skin much sooner.|`|9xrInw4raa	don't worry about wat people say if they think they're gonna die then they can find somewhere else to stand|`|4df2001e587654341ae93baf67eafa20aa	I'm a smoker, too.  Don't give a damn what anybody thinks and pay little attention.  However if I had a workplace in which I needed to stand in a designated smoking area, and people who didn't smoke came there with the intention to ridicule, I think I may eventually get upset about it.  It's supposed to be your break and you shouldn't have to contend with that.  <br>  <br>  I don't know.  Try standing right next to the "smoking area" sign, and every time they make a remark or look at you, smile and point right at that sign with your middle finger.  If it persists, just be overwhelmingly rude in return.  Chances are they will knock it off.|`|8BLvoVpIaa	I don't smoke but I do understand what you are saying. People are rude regardless if they smoke or not. If the non-smokers what to stand near the smoking area then let them complain they are only harming themselves.|`|SjHRNrhBaa	smokers are get their health very weak and also to cause cancer and their smoke affect to other peoples.non-smokers are get good heath and wealthty life
Q4ggnG0waa	I think some of your symptoms are unrelated. I went for quite a while feeling like I had low blood sugar, loud throbbing in my head...like bad sinuses, strange feeling in the pit of my stomach, feeling of deja vu, very strong weakness in my right arm. All these issues seemed to come and go. Have you had a ct scan on your brain? I put all these symptoms off to getting older, hurting my arm when I was young. I fell off a horse and landed on my right side. Hit my head and my arm ended up in a sling. I was dx with a brain tumor on the right side of my brain 5 months ago. It might be worth getting your head checked out. Brain tumors can give you all sorts of strange feelings and sensations.|`|Um75aRZFaa	Could just be nerve damage or a circulation problem, if your kids are older than 5 and you use your right arm to hold them it could just be from strain. With the amount of diagnostic tests you've had done I doubt it's cancer but that's for the physician to decide. I wouldn't worry about it.
AA12218624	im actually surprised you have stuck with alli. i have heard too many horror stories from people who have taken alli. honestly, the healthiest and most natural way to lose weight is simply through exercise and diet. and by diet i dont mean fad diets. i mean simply eating more complex carbs, more protein, more water, and less junk food and simple sugars. <br>  <br>  acai berry is not a weight loss product. it is a fruit. a fruit with antioxidants. it does not aid in weight loss. it just helps keep you from developing cancer and other diseases.|`|XwgoLxnhaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was   <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|Qdmb9u8paa	I wouldn't recommend it. I would suggest stopping Alli because all those diet pills are bad for you. I don't know what Acai Berry is, but thats probably no good either. The 2 together would just be bad.|`|qQCbP6pKaa	Neither work. Acai berry is marketed as a weight loss supplement...Acai berries are high antioxidant fruit and have nothing to do with weight loss.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cfnk42" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/cfnk42</a>

Or it can be caused by carrying an awkward load that you clasped tightly against the sternum to get your arms around it.  Usually, a pain that you only get when taking a deep breath is not heart related, which would be continuous pain.|`|4WieNr6Raa	Wow I just asked this question like a minute ago and I am 22 as well.

There ARE methods that work, but you need to choose carefully.<br>  <br>  There are 2 chambers (the Corpora Cavernosa) inside the penis which fill with blood when you get an erection. Penis size is limited by the amount of blood that these chambers can hold. The only scientific way to get a bigger penis is to increase the amount of blood these chambers can hold – more blood in means a bigger erect penis.<br>  <br>  Enlargement pills are probably the biggest scam. There is no proof, scientific or otherwise, that any of them work. The better ones increase blood flow, so should give you a stronger erection, but none of them will give you any extra size - because they do not increase the amount of blood the penis can hold.<br>  <br>  The only method which can do this is enlargement exercises. These work by driving blood into the chambers (using your hands) and so gradually expanding them. By consistently doing the exercises for a few minutes every day, it is possible to get a longer and thicker penis.<br>  <br>  You do need to know how to do the exercises properly – there’s a good site with more information at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a>|`|tA8T4QYFaa	In the Kama Sutra, men would tie weights to their members and sleep on their stomaches at night, with their member hanging down through a hole in the bed with the weight tied to to it.<br>  <br>  I suppose if you do that enough, it will stretch it out.

Z1po12EXaa	Take your temperature off and on when you aren't feeling sick.  Maybe your normal temperature is lower than average.  If it is maybe you really do have a "fever" when you are sick.  Not all infections lead to a fever, so it might not mean anything.  On the other hand, a fever means your body is fighting the infection, so not having a fever could mean something.  If you are getting sick this often and having strange rashes, I would really go to a doctor.  If your family doctor doesn't have any answers try a dermatologist for the rashes.  Good Luck!|`|sjERiFeNaa	you should see your dr. neither we nor wikipedia can help u on this one love|`|phGow6Qvaa	i don't get fevers ever either. your body decides to raise your temperature in order to kill the bacteria, however it doesn't really work on viruses anyway, so you are not missing much. It could be that your immune system isn't working properly, which could explain the rashes too, or it may just be that as all bodies work differently you don't have fevers much. anyway you should see the doctor about the rashes.

vrYohsjhaa	Shin splints is a general term used to refer to a painful condition in the shins. The muscle pain is caused by any activity that involves running, jumping, also sometimes even walking, swimming, roller skating, or other basic physical activity. <br>   <br>  Growing pains are pain symptoms relatively common in children. Typically, they are located in the muscles, rather than the joints, of the leg and less commonly the arm. They are usually felt on both sides, and appear late in the day or at night, waking the child, with pain varying from mild to very severe. Pain is absent by the morning, and there are no objective clinical signs of inflammation. Pain can recur nightly or be absent for days to months.<br>  <br>  What sports do you play?|`|xI5Auibiaa	I'm not 100% sure, but I think that growing pains typically stop as soon as you hit adolescence.  Which for most would be the age of 12/13.  You should probably see a doctor and ask him what he thinks.  <br>  <br>  Do you play any sports that would possibly cause shin splints?<br>  <br>  This website might come in handy:<br>  <a href="http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/archives/shin-splints.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestretchinghandbook.com/arc...</a>

Also have some provolone cheese or some other kind of healthy cheese on the sandwich.<br>  -have some of your favorite vegetables along with the sandwich.  It will help you get in your serving of vegetables and goes great with a simple sandwich.<br>  -Drink some milk (for calcium) or some water also.<br>  <br>  Morning Snack:<br>  -Have some fruit like pineapple, apples, peaches, cheeries, oranges, pears, grapes, or even a fruit salad.|`|CMDbPn8qaa	Salad - add things like boiled eggs, tuna, ham, chicken e.t.c<br>  FRUIT salad<br>  if you have a grill pan which removes fat from the meat, grill things like chicken or fish on it|`|760742cf4d5e0a51a5eaf85329717412aa	A healthy lunch could be a tomato sandwich on whole wheat bread with fat free mayonnaise. <br>  For healthy snacks, I like strawberry's cut up and mixed in strawberry yogurt. <br>  Or walnuts or almonds, they're good for you.
dIxATqQoaa	I do feel alone, even though I live in a city of almost 500,000 (Fresno, CA), I seem to only be able to find Aspies online.  <br>  <br>  About the 1 out 150, I believe that is for Autism period and although Aspergers is on the Autism spectrum, it is only a part of the spectrum, (there are far more low functioning than high functioning) so the real number would be 1 out of something much higher.<br>  <br>  Which makes the situation that much more lonely.|`|wdSn4opgaa	I'm also an aspie from Austria, but I don't feel alone, because I don't care about other people.<br>  <br>  I think there are much more autistic people, as 1 out of 150, because even if you are a little bit on the autistic spectrum, you are on it und you are autistic.
iByp9i2Naa	Yes, I'm both.  I take 4 different meds, and if I didn't, I would not be able to work.  After putting in my normal hours, I'm pretty drained though.  I have to give myself a little time to recharge mentally when I get home from work though.  All of my medications make me sleep and did cause severe weight gain.  I have lost most of it though.  I recommend giving yourself time to get adjusted to the medication, because I think it would really help you in the long run.  It took me at least a couple of months before I could function and live a halfway "normal" life.  Normal...I hate that word.  Anyway, Try to adjust to it and then try a part-time or temp job to see how you handle it.  Don't jump in all at once.  This is how I had to approach it.  Luckily my employer which I've been with for 11 years now, was willing to work with me on my hours and now I'm at a higher position than I was making better money.

9edc5077057569352822a821adc48204aa	The doctor will ask you about how your symptoms developed, ask you a little bit about your functioning at school, with friends, about your family, whether you have any history of abuse or substance abuse and about your medical condition...things like that.  The doc will also ask if you've taken any mood related medications and if so, how they worked.  If the doctor confirms that you have depression, the doc will then discuss possible medications to use, the risks and benefits of the medication as well as the risks and benefits of not taking medication.<br>  <br>  If the doctor prescribes medication, s/he will want you to come back for a follow-up appointment to see how things are working and will probably tell you about side effects you might have as well as if they'd be serious or not.<br>  <br>  The doctor will likely tell you that antidepressants take quite a while before they have an effect, usually a matter of weeks, so you shouldn't expect to feel their effect right away.  The doc will also mention that the first antidepressant you try may not work for you but if it doesn't there are others to try, one of which is likely to be effective.<br>  <br>  Since you have depression, the doc will ask you about your risk to hurt yourself, especially if you've thought about suicide.  It's important to be honest about that.  The doctor needs to know if your situation is so serious that you might need to be hospitalized, which would be either if you were actively suicidal or if you've been suffering so long that you need to "jump start" your medication.<br>  <br>  If you were hospitalized, while you were in the hospital the doctor would see you almost every day, so that medication changes could be done more quickly than if you were an outpatient.<br>  <br>  Well, that pretty much covers it.|`|SPh4ctPCaa	Hey I'm just getting over depression :-) What help me the most is me being with god and praying.

I too, had this problem when I was younger. Its really horrible when you can feel it about to happen so you kind of squeeze your stomach or cough or something lol! It is not gas, it is because you need to eat more - honestly! Try harder to digest food such as wholemeal bread, ryvitas with cheese or something similar that you like. Bananas are also good. It only takes a couple of minutes to eat it before your class. Just have it in your bag and quickly eat it. Other fuit probably wont stop the rumbling and nor will sweets. Also water throughout class is helpful but that wont work alone. <br>  Lucky you! You have a fast metabolism. Because you are still growing, you wont get fat by eating more I promise!<br>  The worst time it happened to me was when I was 12 and the whole year was having to say a prayer with our strict headmistress before lunch. She said 'Let us think about the food we are about to eat...' and paused for ages for everyone to pray about their food or whatever and my stomach rumbled really loud! How embarrassing!

j0xfBk5Caa	Wow, I'm so sorry you and your daughter have to deal with this. You really need to seek professional advice though, nobody here is going to be able to give any solid answers since they are not familiar with your child or her behaviours. <br>  <br>  Talking to yourself is very common in children, it is almost mandatory since small children have no "inner monologue" they need to speak out loud in order for their brains to process certain information but this seems very extreme. The fact that it started so young is a bit concerning. The fact that she has named whatever it is she hears is alarming as well. My honest advice to you is to co-operate with the psychiatrist and keep in mind that a hospital stay for a child her age isn't the same as a hospital stay for an adult. It is all about being able to monitor her for a longer period of time and be able to observe the behaviours more consistently. It is a scary thought but it is not her being institutionalized in the way an adult with a mental health issue would be. If there are problems that need to be a addressed and dealt with being inpatient is the safest way to accomplish it with a child. Medications are more easily monitored and therapy is more intense. The sooner she is able to access steady treatment the better the outlook becomes. To be frank a hospital can provide round the clock care and crisis intervention that even the most devoted and caring parent can not. In general parents simply don't have the proper skill sets to deal with this in the same capacity as trained professionals.|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	Bless your heart!  <br>  <br>  It is a good idea to rule out any physical problems, like how you did with the seizures. But if you find no physical cause, then you have about two options.  One is to admit her psychiatrically, or two, contact a local church that can pray for her.  <br>  <br>  I understand your reasoning behind not wanting her admitted for tests, as I work in the psychiatric field, too.  However, is there not one hospital in your area that perhaps has a med-psych unit on it, for children?  Where you could stay with her, and no one would make you leave her?<br>  <br>  In case there is any kind of demonic influence about her, I pray in the mighty name of Jesus, boldly walking up to the throne of God, requesting that the Father rebuke all evil from around you or your daughter or your household, sending them into the abyss or wherever He chooses.  May the Lord then place a hedge of protection around you and yours, for the battle is the Lord's and He does all things good.  We praise You Father, thank You Jesus, for all this being done right now.  And Lord, after this has been done, I ask according to Thy will, for comfort, strength, understanding, and discernment on the mother's part, so that she may do what is right for her daughter, and what is necessary.  Hallowed be Thy Name, Holy Father!  Amen.<br>  <br>  Expect to hear from the Lord!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ? Comforting Prayer Warrior ?|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Just talk to a doctor.

dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|1AJQJ7Gjaa	Perfect Pushup go me ripped in no time!! go get it it really works!

fACWmhuFaa	Hi, This sounds like a urinary tract infection, the symptoms you describe e.g. blood in your urine, and pain when you urinate both point to this, also some medications can cause this also. Try drinking lots of fluids, cranberry juice is especially helpful, but if this doesn't clear up please go and see a doctor, all it usually takes is a course of antibiotics, the longer you leave this without getting medical attention, can cause an infection of the kidneys.|`|OleVPkJgaa	If you have visible blood in your urine, do not attempt to treat yourself with home remedies. See a medical professional without delay.<br>  <br>  If you have a urinary tract infection, you will take antibiotics for 3-14 days, depending on what part of the urinary tract is infected.<br>  <br>  If you have kidney stones, be sure to drink plenty of liquids to help pass the stones and prevent other stones from forming. You may need to take pain relievers.<br>  <br>  Medical Treatment:<br>  Many conditions can cause blood in the urine. Some of these have no medical significance and do not require treatment. They usually go away by themselves. Others can be serious and require immediate treatment. Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the bleeding. Anytime you notice blood in the urine you need to consult a healthcare provider for an evaluation.<br>  <br>  it has nothing to do with smoking pot. dont freak out about that.|`|em4F3jw3aa	It's most likely a urinary tract infection.

I used to have periods on the dot every month and the on one day, they were 1 day late 5 days late a week late, then I started going 6 months without one and so forth. I've had them two weeks apart, every sort of variety you could think of I've been there :) I talked to my mom about it and she said she's irregular too, so I figure it's genetic. You can go to Planned Parenthood and start taking the pill, that will regulate your period PLUS keep any babys from happening. Also, you can get pregnant even without him cumming inside you, pre-*** that "lubricant" he produces has sperm in it. So "I'll pull out" is BS and don't ever let a guy tell you that. Planned Parenthood offers the Womens Health Program through medicaid they will give you the forms to fill out and your visits are free. Just call and ask before you go down there because not ALL the PPs accept this form of insurance. But it's easy and quick and you should go see a Dr. any time you feel something is wrong with your body.|`|trhMszD1aa	if you ever have any concerns speak to your doctor asap!!! its you body trying to tell you something...it might be nothing but never take that risk!!|`|ZeYYHByTaa	IF I WAS YOU I'D CHECK OUT WITH YOUR DOCTOR.|`|VIHw7kRkaa	Your body is constantly changing.

There are problems, which may not be mentioned to you, about removal of these organs, so unless the pain is severe and constant,  I, personally, would advise against an operation, unless it is simply to  check for cancer and does not involve removing any of these still necessary parts of the body - just in case!<br>  <br>  However the decision is your wife's and of course yours to make.  just ensure that you go into it with full knowledge of the facts, both for and against, as it is possible for an awful lot of information to be left out.|`|TFV8RLiQaa	Best to consult a qualified consultant.

Breaking in between simply just gives your body time to recoup and prepare itself for more. <br>  <br>  I would recommend stopping in between them, but that is just a personal opinion.  When i go to the gym, i do 3 sets of each exercise with a break in between and i usually do 25 reps <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|i9W9rKSXaa	The best thing you can do is see how much push-ups you can do... Go until you almost max out.That will become your baseline. If you really want to improve...Let's say you max out at 22 well over the entire day do 5 sets of 22. Everyday try and increase to reps and reduce the sets (staying around 100 a day). If you can't increase that day then do the same and try for the next day. Inno tme at all you will be able to do upwards of 60 70 push-ups.|`|PTmvJQglaa	Ensure that your break does not exceed beyond 40 seconds.|`|8Fn1tYaJaa	The first option would be less effective than the second option.
BB0DUGRgaa	Hey, when I was 14 ( last year) I weighed 161. I don't know how much you weight but it can't be too far off. I had the same exact problems as you do right now. I ate when I wasn't hungary, just to keep me occupied. I will tell you what I ate so you can base your meals and snacks around this. You don't have to eat the same exact thing but it may help you.<br>  <br>  Breakfast: I would eat a serving size of healthy cereal (special k, Kashi, Curves, etc.) try to stay away from the sugar cereals (Fruity Pebbles, Corn Pops, etc.) I would also have the recomended serving size of milk (says it on cereal box) and I would add fruit like a banana, strawberries, blueberries, raisens. For your milk you can start off having whatever you prefer but I now get skim milk, which I started with 2% and slowly worked down. <br>  <br>  Try to eat breakfast within an hour of waking up. If you are not hungary before you go to school then bring a granola bar with you to school and when you get hungary you can snack on that before lunch. NEVER skip breakfast, i tried it and actually gained like 5 pounds from not eating breakfast. <br>  <br>  Lunch: Bring a lunch to school. You can't trust what the school has. You can bring a salad with veggies in it but go extremely low on the dressing. Or you can bring a sandwhich on wheat bread. You could have PB&J or a Turkey sandwhich. And on the side I had Wheat Thins (reduced fat are best.) And bring a water with you for a drink.<br>  <br>  You could eat 1-2 meals from school a week if you want to. I did that for the first month or so and then just brang a lunch everyday. Try to pick healthy meals.<br>  <br>  Snack after school: if you are hungary then you can have something at home like wheat thins, yogurt, dry cereal, fruit. If you are craving a cookie, have one, but do not have more than you should. Just keep that little voice in the back of your head and it will remind you when making certain decisions. But if you are not hungary and want to eat you should go outside and play B-Ball or read or do something to keep our mind off of food.<br>  <br>  Dinner: You can have whatever your parents prepar for supper. Try to eat small portions and maybe add the frozen veggies into a meal. You can also have frozen dinners once in a while if you don't want what your parents are making or if you think it is too unhealthy or what-not. <br>  <br>  Try to eat supper before 6 so your food can digest in time before you go to bed. <br>  <br>  Exercise: I didn't start exercise until about a month or two ago. I just ate healthy. But you can start off by going for walks around town or on a treadmill. And if there is a local track nearby you can go on that too. If you eventually want to start jogging you can do that too. <br>  <br>  I just started to jog about 2-4 times aweek on the treamill before I go to school. I jog about a mile at 5.5 speed. I will eventually raise that and you can gradually move up the scale too. It takes about 10 minutes to jog a mile so you could do a mile in the morning and a mile in the afternoon.<br>  <br>  When i was 14, i was 5'1 and 161. But by eating healthier and just starting an exercise routine I lost 40 pounds. I am now 120, 15 years old and still 5'1 and its a year later. Now you could lose weight faster than me by starting of with exercise right off, but I wasnt ready for that so thats why I started a short time ago. <br>  <br>  If I could do this, anyone can, and I am being serious. I was the girl who would eat 2 burgers on buns with a side-dish of fries/chips for one meal. Now I just eat a burger on the plate without the bread with wheat thins on the side. (I know, I live on wheat thins! lol) But beside the fact, I couldn't stick to an exercise routine that i had tried to do so many times. <br>  <br>  It does consist of will power, but this is not a diet, it has to be your new lifestyle and you need to take charge and do this for you. I know what it si liek to be the big one in the class and the slow jogger but now I have confidence going shopping and walking the in hallways in my school.<br>  You need to do this for you and only you, you can succeed if you put your mind to it.<br>  <br>  If you need any help at all, I am here, just email me at AlexInLuv93@aol.com<br>  <br>  Take Care, Alex.|`|xeRkqINEaa	about it you can find information from the following website<br>  <a href="http://healthy-lifes.synthasite.com/?q=weight%20loss" rel="nofollow">http://healthy-lifes.synthasite.com/?q=w...</a>|`|dVnoBtdhaa	Well first I would like to suggest belemia because you can still eat.

Um75aRZFaa	It's not "onion oil" that makes you cry as the last poster said. It is a weak sulfuric acid that gets created by enzymes being released as you cut, which irritates the eyes. Your eyes tear to try to dilute the acid and in turn stop the irritation. <br>  <br>  Try cutting the onion under running water next time to stop the chemicals from releasing into the air. I cook with Peru sweet onions that have a lower concentration of the enzymes and haven't had a problem with them so far.<br>  <br>  To answer your question though, 10 minutes of cutting onions won't affect your eyes long term unless for some reason you have a disease or are taking medication that reduces the amount of tears your eye ducts release. Just wash your hands thoroughly and then rinse your eyes after you are done slicing and you'll be fine. If the irritation continues use some over the counter eye drops like Visine.|`|AA10491480	if u rub lemon juice on the cutting board and knife it does no hurt|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Onions won't really "hurt" your eyes but they can make them sting. When you peel an onion, the onion oil is released into the air. It is this oil that makes your eyes hurt. Don't worry though, it's not permanent or anything. This is also why onions are said to make people cry.

2hrLxxlWaa	Most people don’t realize that it isn’t diet or exercise that is going to help them but a combination of both.<br>  <br>  In order for your body to burn fat you must be taking in less calories then what you expend.<br>  <br>  Yes, for some, diet modification will help in the beginning, but in the long run it is going to require  regular exercise to continue to burn the fat and to actually build muscle tone.<br>  <br>  Not body builder muscle tone just normal healthy muscle tone.<br>  <br>  So eating healthily is a vital component to weight loss. The other component is exercise.<br>  <br>  What are the best ways to burn fat and tone up? I can start by telling you that the less cardio you do in your workout routine the fewer calories that you are going to burn per workout.<br>  <br>  As I have already stated that weight loss, or the amount of fat you burn, depends largely on calories.<br>  <br>  You need to be burning more calories then you take in. So here is an example for you.<br>  <br>  A 30 minute cardio routine burns about 150 – 300 calories. Talk to a nutritionist or trainer and they are going to tell you that we know that in order to burn one pound of fat we need to burn 3500 calories.<br>  <br>  The USDA has guidelines that suit all people.<br>  <br>  They recommend that all people should get 60 – 90 minutes a day of accumulated moderate – intensity physical activity most days out of the week. Note that is accumulated, so if you can’t get it all in at once then break it up through the day.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of the best cardio workouts:<br>  <br>  1.   Running – doesn’t require expensive equipment and can be done anywhere. Burns serious calories especially if done on sprints or up hills. The average person weighing 145lbs. can burn up to 300 calories at 5.2mph in 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  2.   Boxing for cardio strength – this is considered the best cardio workouts. This workout requires the heart rate range to be 50-70% of a person’s maximum heart rate.<br>  <br>  3. Swimming – is the also one of the best workouts. Involves nearly all major muscles and therefore is the best whole body workout. Aquatic exercise can help and has become very popular as an exercise program.<br>  <br>  Weights and Fat Burn and Tone<br>  <br>  Yes, you need to include the use of weights in your routine to really see your body tone up.<br>  <br>  There are principles, 3 of them to be exact, that need to be adhered to in order for you to build muscle and tone up. Following these three synergistic principles will help you make continuous gains any time you want.<br>  <br>  These three principles are:<br>  <br>  smart weight lifting <br>  quality nutrition (there is the diet again) <br>  quality rest <br>  Keeping these in balance will optimize your muscle building and toning. So how do we fit the cardio and the weights together?<br>  <br>  You should do your cardio after your weight lifting. Yes, you need to warm up for 5-7 minutes prior to your weight lifting, but your main cardio workout should be done after you lift weights.<br>  <br>  This will help you burn two to three times more fat during your cardio routine because your metabolic rate will already have sky rocketed.<br>  <br>  This next suggestion is one that causes great controversy.<br>  <br>  Your weight lifting routine, when it comes to toning and fat burn, should be a light weight lifting routine.<br>  <br>  This is because you need to have the energy to do the cardio as well. So a good 20 minutes of weights and then your cardio will super charge your metabolism and heart rate. Make sure you snack prior to your workout, primarily on fruits.<br>  <br>  A combination of cardio and weight lifting is the key to burning fat and toning up. As well as having a balanced heathly diet.|`|fC9lljKaaa	try some yoga,if you have on demand or anything like that on your tv go to it.work with trainers.you eat healthy..great! good luck!:)|`|fTztIC22aa	Eat 6 small meals a day and do cardio for atleast 30 mins if you're going to do distance.

If burning fat everywhere will make you underweight then you can rebuild good weight in muscle rather than fat to replace it.<br>  <br>  Any good aerobic exercise for 30-40 min per day is fine for shedding general excess weight. After that, you can go to the gym in order to have more of a say in putting the weight back where you want it.

One of the causes of stomach pain after eating is stomach ulcer. The ulcer can be in the stomach or the upper part of intestine.<br>  Other causes include coronary artery disease which results in blockade of blood vessels supplying the intestine and stomach cancer. Stomach cancer is more of a possibility in elderly age group.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you to consult a gastroenterologist for complete evaluation.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|UxQ1VwGBaa	same

You can have any seafood, some chicken and lots of vegetables and fruit, even pasta, rice and bread. It's a great diet, if you do it you will wonder why you ever put up with your bloating. Your bowel actions will return to normal, excess weight loss occurs and you gain energy.

d331e25a3bf2fa5d4adc840b4fb3276caa	Unfortunately, I don't think there's much you can do. PCOS is poly cystic, right? Well, I had a cyst that was the size of a grape fruit (no joke), so the doctor took it out, put me on birth control, and told me to have children as soon as possible. Now, obviously that last one isn't the best if you're 16. I was 23 and getting married. <br>  <br>  I'm not an expert at PCOS, but I'm pretty sure it's not something you cure- it's a condition you're going to have to deal with for a long time. Birth control helps prevent the formation of cysts. You didn't mention whether you are on that or not. BC also helps regulate your period. <br>  <br>  The only other thing is to maintain your healthy weight, and light exercise.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Hi, I am sorry you are in so much pain. If your periods are this heavy and painful then your Doctor really needs to look at better management. What tablets did he give you? <br>  <br>  You could see if your GP will prescribe you Mefenamic acid- this is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which is sometimes very good for period pain. This can cause gastrointestinal upset though.<br>  <br>  You could also try Naproxen (another NSAID) It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, reducing the contractions of the uterus. This drug also causes less gastrointestinal disturbances which are common in NSAID's. Another option would be seeing if your GP will prescribe an Antispasmodic drug. This sometimes helps with cramps.<br>  <br>  If everything fails, the pill is another option (if you're a teenager and your cycle is not fully established, you should try and avoid the pill if possible) another alternative would be progesterone Norithisterone.<br>  <br>  Your sore throat is unconnected to your periods pains, you likely have just picked up a virus- this could also be why you are feeling unwell in general. The pain under your ribs which feels like a stitch could simply be trapped wind. Drink some warm water and walk around- it should disperse. Have a chat with your GP regarding your menstrual issues. Don't suffer in silence<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Then your next best bet is either an antispasmodic, progestogen Norethisterone or the contraceptive pill.|`|ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	Give the pills a chance to work.

sPDOMTTjaa	Basically- a heart attack. Myocardial infarction is just the more sophisicated way of saying 'heart attack'; it is also the proper medical term for 'heart attack'. A transmural MI is characterized by ischemic(lack of blood flow)necrosis(the death of living cells or tissues)of the full thickness of the affected muscle segment/segments, extending from the endocardium through the myocardium to the epicardium. A nontransmural MI is defined as an area of ischemic necrosis that does not extend through the full thickness of myocardial wall segment/segments.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	Myocardial Infarction.....is a heart attack......transmural is referred to as "through-and-through".|`|wDCjzuPraa	What is Ischemic Heart Disease?<br>  Ischemic heart disease is caused by an imbalance between the myocardial blood flow and the metabolic demand of the myocardium. Reduction in coronary blood flow is related to progressive atherosclerosis with increasing occlusion of coronary arteries. Blood flow can be further decreased by superimposed events such as vasospasm, thrombosis, or circulatory changes leading to hypoperfusion.<br>  <br>  Coronary artery perfusion depends upon the pressure differential between the ostia (aortic diastolic pressure) and coronary sinus (right atrial pressure). Coronary blood flow is reduced during systole because of Venturi effects at the coronary orifices and compression of intramuscular arteries during ventricular contraction.<br>  <br>  Factors reducing coronary blood flow include:<br>  <br>  Decreased aortic diastolic pressure<br>  <br>  Increased intraventricular pressure and myocardial contraction<br>  <br>  Coronary artery stenosis, which can be further subdivided into the following etiologies:<br>  <br>  Fixed coronary stenosis<br>  <br>  Acute plaque change (rupture, hemorrhage)<br>  <br>  Coronary artery thrombosis<br>  <br>  Vasoconstriction<br>  <br>  Aortic valve stenosis and regurgitation<br>  <br>  Increased right atrial pressure<br>  <br>  40 micron collateral vessels are present in all hearts with pressure gradients permitting flow, despite occlusion of major vessels. In general, the cross-sectional area of the coronary artery lumen must be reduced by more than 75% to significantly affect perfusion. Coronary atherosclerosis is diffuse (involving more than one major arterial branch) but is often segmental, and typically involves the proximal 2 cm of arteries (epicardial).<br>  <br>  "Thrombolytic therapy" with agents such as streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is often used to try and lyse a recently formed thrombus. Such therapy with lysis of the thrombus can re-establish blood flow in a majority of cases. This helps to prevent significant myocardial injury, if early (less than an hour or so) in the course of events, and can at least help to reduce further damage.<br>  <br>  Images of coronary artery disease:<br>  <br>  Normal coronary artery, microscopic. <br>  Coronary atherosclerosis, cross sections, gross. <br>  Coronary atherosclerosis, minimal, gross. <br>  Coronary atherosclerosis, severe, gross. <br>  Coronary atherosclerosis, composite, microscopic. <br>  Coronary atherosclerosis, intimal plaque, microscopic. <br>  Coronary atherosclerosis, complicated by calcification, microscopic. <br>  Coronary atherosclerosis, occlusive, microscopic. <br>  Coronary atherosclerosis, occlusive, microscopic. <br>  Coronary artery, hemorrhage into plaque, gross. <br>  Coronary artery, atheromatous plaque with disrupted fibrin cap, microscopic. <br>  Thrombosis of coronary artery, gross. <br>  Thrombosis of coronary artery, gross. <br>  Thrombosis of coronary artery, microscopic. <br>  Thrombosis of coronary artery, microscopic. <br>  Patterns of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)<br>  Angina pectoris - a symptom complex of IHD characterized by paroxysmal attacks of chest pain, usually substernal or precordial, caused by myocardial ischemia that falls short of inducing infarction. There are several patterns:<br>  <br>  Stable angina (typical) - paroxysms of pain related to exertion and relieved by rest or vasodilators.subendocardial ischemia with ST-segment depression<br>  <br>  Variant or Prinzmetal's angina - angina that classically occurs at rest and is caused by reversible spasm in normal to severely atherosclerotic coronary arteries. ST-segment elevation or depression maybe seen during attacks.<br>  <br>  Unstable angina - prolonged pain, pain at rest in a person with stable angina, or worsening of pain in stable angina. ST-segment depression (usually) and ST-segment elevation.<br>  <br>  Sudden cardiac death - Unexpected death from cardiac causes usually within one hour after a cardiac event or without the onset of symptoms. Strikes 300,000 - 400,000 persons annually. Usually high-grade stenosis with acute coronary changes.<br>  <br>  Myocardial Infarction (MI)<br>  The pathogenesis can include:<br>  <br>  Occlusive intracoronary thrombus - a thrombus overlying an ulcerated or fissured stenotic plaque causes 90% of transmural acute myocardial infarctions.<br>  <br>  Vasospasm - with or without coronary atherosclerosis and possible association with platelet aggregation.<br>  <br>  Emboli - from left sided mural thrombosis, vegetative endocarditis, or paradoxic emboli from the right side of heart through a patent foramen ovale.<br>  <br>  The gross morphologic appearance of a myocardial infarction can vary. Patterns include:<br>  <br>  Transmural infarct - involving the entire thickness of the left ventricular wall from endocardium to epicardium, usually the anterior free wall and posterior free wall and septum with extension into the RV wall in 15-30%. Isolated infarcts of RV and right atrium are extremely rare.<br>  <br>  Subendocardial infarct - multifocal areas of necrosis confined to the inner 1/3-1/2 of the left ventricular wall.

BnR4LLhxaa	The glucose tolerance test measures the body's response to a specific glucose load: they give you a 100 grams of glucose in a drink, then measure the blood glucose levels at specific intervals over the next 3 hours. Your diet should not have any specific affect on that test, the possible exception being if your ate a whole lot of fruit before hand, and your glucose level was already very high at the start of the test. I think that you are usually supposed to be fasting (no food for preceding 12 hours) when you go for this test.<br>  <br>  The hemoglobin A1c (often just called an A1c test) measures the amount of glucose attached to red blood cells. Since the amount of glucose in a red blood cell is related to the level of glucose in the blood at the time when that cell is created, and red blood cells last 2-3 months, the A1c test measures the average glucose concentration over a 2-3 month period. A dietary change for a few weeks before the blood is drawn for that test could have some affect on the results, but only if the diet causes a significant difference (either higher or lower) in your blood glucose levels.<br>  <br>  It is very unlikely that the vitamins and teas will not have any effect on the results.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you get good news back.|`|pRF5LLloaa	The effects of diet on the 3-hour GTT are minimal.  It IS important that you be fasting for 8-10 hours before taking the test, though.<br>  <br>  The GTT test your body's ability to handle a sudden "slug" of sugar.  This ability would not normally be affected by your current diet.  <br>  <br>  During the test you will be asked to drink a really sweet (like nasty sweet!) liquid that is almost 100% sugar.  It has no drugs or not other additives except water.  There is no possible reaction between that and anything you are taking.<br>  <br>  Since this is not a blood sugar level test, per se, eating a special diet for a few days before the test will not affect the test, pro or con.<br>  <br>  The GTT totally tests how your body responds to sugar, and not how much sugar is in your body (which is what the Finger tick tests do).<br>  <br>  you should ASK the doctor to perform an A1C test as well, taking the blood sample BEFORE you begin the GTT.  This test will give him more clues to your condition.|`|6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	It will effect the results.  I don't want to tell you to go off your diet, because it's probably closer to what you should be doing all the time.  You need to find a diet that you can stay on indefinitely before you take that test.

5rJ6nf2oaa	It doesn't mean your metabolism is low necessarily, although it may be. It sounds to me that you are not eating enough. In order to have healthy and regular bowel actions you need to make sure you eat well at every meal, that means breakfast, lunch and dinner. If you don't eat sufficient amounts of food then obviously not as much will appear at the other end. If you are limiting your food intake in order to keep your weight under control then I would advise you to change your diet to one that allows you to eat properly. At least 50% vegetables and fruit, with 30% lean meat or other protein and 20% complex carbs (whole wheat bread, pasta and rice). This will give you a good intake of bulk and fibre. Also make sure you drink lots of water since dehydration can cause constipation also. Hope that helps.|`|6d7m0kWWaa	No, it means your constipated.  Take a laxative.

qHa4w8eyaa	I looked up this article just for you!  Please read it and reconsider your decision to take Yaz....<br>  <br>  <br>  TV ads for birth-control pill Yaz gloss over the risks<br>  <br>  If you weren't paying close attention when you saw two recent TV commercials for the birth-control pill Yaz, you might have missed the part where they mention the serious and even life-threatening risks associated with the drug. That's because while a voiceover ran down the potential side effects of the drug, such as heart attack and stroke, pop music played in the background, and what appeared on the screen were images of women jogging, meeting up with their friends, and engaging in other everyday activities.<br>  <br>  The ads raised a red flag with the Food and Drug Administration, which said the commercials glossed over the drug's risks and could give viewers the impression that Yaz is safer than has been demonstrated. The agency sent a warning letter in October to Bayer, Yaz's manufacturer, requesting that both commercials be pulled immediately.<br>  <br>  In one ad, entitled "Balloons," the voiceover lists the side effects of Yaz while women are shown running in a park, driving, and singing. The FDA said the music and the numerous scene changes distracted viewers from hearing the risk information and made it difficult to process the adverse events associated with Yaz.<br>  <br>  But that wasn't the only problem, the FDA said. The ads also give the misleading impression that the birth-control pill is appropriate for treating premenstrual syndrome (PMS), when in fact it's only approved for treating a more serious condition called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD. The symptoms of PMDD are generally so severe that they interfere with a woman's ability to work, go to school, and engage in social activities. In one ad, women sing the chorus to the song "We're Not Gonna Take It" as they kick and punch away words describing symptoms such as irritability, moodiness, bloating, and feeling anxious. The "Balloons" commercial shows balloons labeled with similar symptoms. But the FDA said that the way both ads present these symptoms gives the impression that they’re milder forms associated with PMS, rather than the more severe symptoms of PMDD.<br>  <br>  Another knock against the commercials is that they misrepresent Yaz's potential for treating acne, the FDA said. Both ads show women with blemish-free faces while the voiceover says Yaz can help keep skin clear. The FDA pointed out, however, that while Yaz can reduce the amount of acne a woman has, clinical trials show that it does not result in completely clear skin.<br>  <br>  Because the ads were considered to be serious violations of drug-ad regulations, the FDA asked Bayer to develop a plan to present truthful and non-misleading information about Yaz.<br>  <br>  —Steve Mitchell, associate editor, Best Buy Drugs|`|UwNKFSBeaa	Don't worry!!

2RzEaod9aa	Wow, "skinny cause their lucky" people? Women who are naturally thin complain that they have no curves. Men who are naturally thin complain that they look like weaklings. And you sit here and think they're LUCKY? That's kinda sick, my friend.<br>  <br>  How about a healthy body? Why not ask about that? That's an easy answer for you.<br>  <br>  I think food is a fuel. Even if it tastes super nasty, I consume it knowing what nutrients are in there. I enjoy food and know how to cook, but sometimes I throw a lot of mismatched ingredients into my post-workout shakes and I just have to plug my nose and down the hatch it goes.<br>  <br>  I eat 5-6 times a day, and each meal is comprised of lean protein and natural carbohydrates. I tell people that the best thing to do is cram as many nutrients as you can into your food. Some people have lettuce and some cucumbers and call that a salad. I have either spinach and/or mixed baby greens and/or mixed herbs + tomatoes + cabbage + cucumber + squash + mushrooms + nuts + dried fruit, and sometimes I'll even throw a potato or vegan chili in the mix for the hell of it. <br>  <br>  I have no feelings towards food. It is just fuel. I eat because I have to fuel my machine. I need the nutrition to function, to build muscle, to wake up and have energy throughout the day. I need food. <br>  <br>  My body is a machine and works like a machine. It requires fuel, and when I do something to it, it will react. I know the codes that I must punch in to lose weight, to gain muscle, to do both. I also know the codes that I must punch in to gain weight, to lose muscle, to be miserable, to have energy, to be fatigued.<br>  <br>  I see my muscles grow and love the feeling of being stronger. Life is so much easier when you can just DO something. When you can walk up a flight of stairs and not get winded, or run to your car and not even be breathing heavy a little bit; when you can carry all the groceries into the house in just one trip, or carry someone who's sick into a warm bed; when you need no help to push your stalled vehicle uphill and out of traffic, when you can help others do the same; when you look into the mirror and see all that you've worked for and you feel great physically and mentally, and you flex and you know you're on the path to your goal...there is no feeling like that. None. That's why studies show that people who add weight training into their routine not only stick with it longer, but also feel better about themselves.|`|XNBMzuxbaa	I just don't eat that much.

I would go back to your dr. and ask for a referral to a therapist. Also, you need to tell him that the medication isn't doing it's job. He'll either bump up your dosage or try something else. You might need ativan for those intense attacks. Also, cut down on caffeine if you drink a lot of coffee or colas.

You poor hungry baby.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Your friend is sick.<br>  <br>  There is a rule of thumb that was common when our mothers were young.  Many girls think it is outdated and makes them have to be fat, but that is because they all want to look like cracked-out models.<br>  <br>  <br>  The rule is<br>  100 lbs at 5'<br>  +5 lbs for each additional inch.<br>  This rule is judgment of how much a "normal" skinny girl should weigh.  Personally, I'm not that into skinny girls.  Women should have curves.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, you should weigh at least 90 lbs and your friend should be at least 120.  I really can't believe she is able to stand up!  She cannot be healthy!!!<br>  The two of you should try to gain some weight together!!!|`|2RzEaod9aa	No, you aren't fat. <br>  <br>  How about worrying about if you're healthy instead? Health is a lifestyle, not a weight.|`|oojO4WAraa	Your friend is at an unhealthy weight.  She must be bony and ugly looking, and probably sickly.  You are at a good weight.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	ur not even tripple digits! ur not fat|`|HGLdQgpEaa	You're not fat.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	5'4 and 80 pounds?  That's disgusting|`|xz0QrA6caa	You are not fat!!!!  You need good muscle tone for a sport like soccer and your friend that is only 80 pounds at that height does not sound like she has that.  You don't want to be to small for a sport like soccer.  You are not fat at all.  Good luck in the soccer|`|XNBMzuxbaa	She is wayy too thin. I put her BMI in on this calculator<br>  <a href="http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi....</a><br>  at it was 14.7! That is underweight!<br>  Then I did yours and you were 16.2, slightly underweight.<br>  So your not fat if anything too skinny|`|ximWtKVuaa	Calculate your bmi ... the calculation has to do with your weight versus your height... you are both considered underweight according to that ... her more considerably more severely than you.|`|e4ebc08557e7843458d66e6d4375e253aa	No you are not fat by any means.

oojO4WAraa	Don't be embarrassed by a medical condition.  Ringworm is a fungal infection.  It will probably not go away on it's own.  You can try atheletes foot spray or some other OTC anti-fungal medication, but it is probably best to go to the doctor and get a real diagnosis and treatment.  Good luck.|`|IggGQ4GEaa	Try any anti-fungal cream such as Tenactin. However, if it doesn't show signs of improvement within a week you really should see a doctor and get a prescription medication. It's nothing to be embarrassed about.... you could have picked it up anywhere (school, pet, ect.)|`|e957853a940a0d81e718eb3079902633aa	The main theme in home treatment for ring worm is to keep the rash clean and dry as fungus thrives in moist and unhygienic conditions. A shave might be needed to clear up the area around the infection and after it has been carefully cleaned a hair-drier with a setting for cold air could be used to get the skin dry. Getting a tan is also a great home treatment for ring worm since fungus doesn’t enjoy sunlight very much.<br>  <br>  or you could visit this site:  <a href="http://www.ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Get-Rid-of-Ringworms-Fast&id=333108" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Get...</a>|`|v0596BTeaa	Canesten cream will treat ringworm.  It is a fungal infection and may eventually go away, but you can buy canesten over the counter at any UK chemist.|`|f6ZFjatlaa	You can buy an over the counter antifungal cream (for jock itch or athletes foot), like Lotrimin or Lamisil.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	You can get ringworm cream at any pharmacy.|`|jKh5M53Yaa	It wouldn't go away by itself. Ring worm is fungus infection, get a anti-fungal cream from a pharmacy suitable for ringworm. You can ask the people working there for the right one.<br>  <br>  Since it is a fungal infection, keep applying the cream for at least 3 weeks or so. Fungus takes weeks to reproduce, and it will take as long to get rid of them. So don't think it's gone after applying for a few days, because it will come back and be harder to get rid of.|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	You should see your doc but if you're going to try and home treat it, take a picture of it beforehand - a lot of times the creams change the rash and make it look different so doctors end up doing the, "It looks a little atypical for a fungal infection but..."|`|c5bf6f12f6374eb3f9af40a3aba726d2aa	It's  a  fungus  infection.  Try  Tinnactin  powdered  spray  or  Tinnactin   cream  or  Lamacil.  You  could  ask  the  pharmisist  what he  recommends  if  you  want  to  but  you  can get  all of  these  over  the  counter|`|W55tjTcbaa	an antifungal cream should work.  anitbiotic cream will not help.
BG8vMyZjaa	"Baby lung development problems is a very specialized medical field. You must raise your concerns with a specialist rather than Yahoo/A". <br>  I am desperately sorry, is she a premature baby?  If so here is a little information<br>  "Immature lungs, another common problem, occurs when a baby's lungs lack sufficient surfactant, a chemical that prevents the air sacs from collapsing during breathing. Surfactant isn't usually fully in the fetal lungs until after 34 weeks' gestational age, so many preemies need help with their breathing. Ventilators, machines that are hooked up to a small plastic tube that goes into the baby's windpipe, are often used to aid in breathing" <br>  The link to this site is below.<br>  I wish you and your daughter all the luck in the world.|`|epBOAXUraa	was the infant born prematurely?  Sometimes lungs do not expand enough when baby's are born early.  Injection of a surfactant sometimes works to 'elasticate' the lungs to allow them to open better.

MI7Vo2d5aa	You'll have to ask your doctor, I don't know.  What I do know is that it is very important never to self-diagnose.  You have to have a psychiatrist evaluate you in order to be diagnosed with it.<br>  <br>  That makes sense, though.  A 'diagnosis' is something that doctor's use to communicate and treat.  It isn't of any real use to us.  We are no different before or after it, though.<br>  <br>  eta: oh, and many professionals are beginning to doubt and stray from the 'chemical imbalance' way of thinking.  It may be that a more fitting definition would involve that different areas of the brains cells are behaving or functioning differently than they normally would be.|`|NllUnaBZaa	Diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of an individual as well as abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends or co-workers, followed by secondary signs observed by a psychiatrist, nurse, social worker, clinical psychologist or other clinician in a clinical assessment. There are lists of criteria for someone to be so diagnosed. These depend on both the presence and duration of certain signs and symptoms. Assessment is usually done on an outpatient basis<br>  <br>  An initial assessment may include a physical exam by a physician. Although there are no biological tests which confirm bipolar disorder, tests may be carried out to exclude medical illnesses such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism, metabolic disturbance, a systemic infection or chronic disease, and syphilis or HIV infection. An EEG may be used to exclude epilepsy, and a CT scan of the head to exclude brain lesions. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication|`|GHZts2BTaa	all in all friend only your mental heal care professional can diagnose you! bi~polar is in fact a chemecal imbalance in the brain and your 100% rite! bi~polar is also known as manic depression! its kind of odd. one minute you could feel the greatest and then the next you feel  as if you hit rock bottom:( but.... there are tests that can be done! im sorry but... they cant just stick a needle in your arm and say that you are bi~polar! you have to see a doc. and that would be your ultimate test! just be honest! obviously something is bugging you? soo find the source and im sure you will fix it. you already took the first step!          good luck hope i helped|`|nX9qHTWwaa	The doctor will prescribe medication for you along with therapy.<br>  With bipolar disorder, the patient can't be too happy or sad.

OleVPkJgaa	ok there zapper, so i feel like its not just one thing. Yes the smoking accounts for the symptoms felt in the throat and lungs, and the withdrawal from the nicotine may be whats causing the watery eyes and runny nose, <br>  but the spine is completely different. Anything to do with the spine can be very dangerous, you should def get an x-ray. If it is shooting pain and it is intense, it could possibly be a pinched nerve. Go to a chiropractor if you do not want to go to your doctor's, but you have to get the spine thing checked out. and soon.|`|VXQFT341aa	You might want to go to the ER.

Use it to your advantage.|`|cI6vT8yJaa	I would check out this information from Darren LaCroix.

C59bTKO2aa	Take whatever the difference is between the minimum dose and the maximum right now.  When it's time for the next dose take the higher dose.  Twice a day for Maalox is usually when you first get up and then right before bedtime or you can try every 12 hours, whichever keeps you more comfortable.  If you don't get relief after 48 hours, talk to your doctor about a different medication, or to your pharmacist, whoever recommended the Maalox.
CceiP7q5aa	get it checked out, blood in your stools is not a good sign|`|xvPsAonzaa	I take it that spicy is your comfort food.

As a Nurse I know that if the blood is bright red it is in the lower part of your colon, usually just inside your rectum.  Dark red blood comes from further up in your digestive tract and is dark because it has been in part digested.  My guess is that you have internal hemorrhoids that start bleeding every once in awhile.  If it becomes more often see a doctor, and if it doesn't bother you keep eating the hot and spicy,  It is hard to stay away from it.|`|5bajPMZRaa	Bright red blood means it's coming from your lower GI tract (farther north you get dark tarry stools caused by digested blood.  this is melena. it's bad. see your doctor.) Occasional trace blood sounds like it could be from a hemorrhoid.  Internal hemorrhoids aren't painful because the innervation is different from that of external hemorrhoids.  It could also be bleeding from a duodenal ulcer.  Bleeding hemorrhoids aren't necessarily a medical emergency - but, since you don't know where it's coming from,  See your doctor.|`|kLmZAaqHaa	hi you say the blood is bright red this would suggest that it is fresh as digested blood usually darkens the motions to almost black in colour, it could be that you have an internal haemorrhoid which bleeds when you pass a larger than normal bowel motion or runnier than normal motions caused by highly seasoned foods which may cause irritation to the colon lining. however if you are at all worried about this problem always go and see you GP.

bfsym1dsaa	The chemical called "isoflavone" helps reduce the risk of breast cancer while also naturally increase your breast size. This if found most prominently in soy beans, or any soy products. The best is if they're not in dishes, as some nutrients may be lost when cooked. The best is regular fresh soy milk, since they're not really mixed with anything else other than water and maybe milk, very healthy, has calcium for growth, and it doesn't hurt to drink more... (Also it tastes good :D ). Since isoflavone is also a phytoestrogen, it works similar to estrogen in a female's body, which helps her to develop and grow to be more feminine (on the other hand, men are usually affected minimally by this because they have hormones that counteracts these things so they don't grow breasts when drinking soy milk).<br>  <br>  Another thing is, providing great nutrients is also very important to one's body. Dark orange colored carbohydrates such as yams or sweet potato gives energy and helps growth, while not being unhealthy, so they shouldn't make you fat (don't eat with butter, but just steams or cooked, eat plain or with minimal fats).<br>  <br>  Lastly, very important to keep up with your protein and carbohydrate intakes and do not lack down on vitamins. The pills may be okay, but they're not nearly the best, as medicines are drugs, they're made from the same chemicals that poisonous products are made. Natural sources of nutrients are best with fruit juices. Papaya juice stands out the most because they also contain a chemical that enlarges breast growth, while being low on calories and fats, keep you healthy.<br>  <br>  Don't espect growth extremely rapidly, as you're already in your 20s, this process may take longer than young teens, but nonetheless it should work over months and years.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I'd like bigger breasts too, but there isn't any way to do it unless you gain weight or get pregnant.

I think you should go too, you don't know what your missing :).|`|Z3bjHCZpaa	Oh well if you do need glasses you do not need them severely. I would go see a professional eye doctor and see what he/she has to say. Also, NEVER trust the school nurses. Those eye tests are absolutely rip -offs. My younger sister passed the school eye test with flying colors but when we took her to the doctor she needed glasses severely.|`|V6dz395kaa	you might just need a minor prescription. I have the same problem and i got glasses only when i cant see things. You should see a proffesional eye doctor.
xb2Df33eaa	It could be because you are still healing. I had mine removed 4 years ago and I always thought they did not do the surgery well, I have been dealing with pain under the rib cage for almost 2 years. I know it is the liver because it can not be the gallblader anymore. It you are still healing give it some time. Otherwise go back to the doctor, because it could be your liver.<br>  I started taking some natural remedies this week for the liver and feel better. Go back to the doc, they should be able to help you.|`|HlUEFypHaa	"Just" when?  A couple days ago?  A couple weeks ago?  Was your surgery laproscopic or did they actually open you up wide to remove it?  All of this would matter.  I had my gallbladder removed with laproscopic surgery years ago.  I was up and around pretty good the next day, but tender for sure for about a week.  Each person's mileage will vary though.|`|cI6vT8yJaa	My mother just had her's removed and the surgeon explained that the gallbladder sits on top of the part of the spine connected to the shoulder blade and chest. When you have it removed, it can really irritate these nerve endings and cause pain. I would talk to your doctor about it if does not go away.
sQu3LLqtaa	Too much sleep is almost as bad as too little sleep and can make you feel very weak and very tired.  More than 10 hours of sleep per night is too much.<br>  <br>  Most people manage quite well on 7 or 8 hours of sleep per night but some people actually need 9 or 10 hours.|`|JFbWyKKDaa	Besides bed sores and laziness.  I saw something on Penn and Tellers Bullsh*t on Showtime (movie channel) in a scientific study that people who actually got less sleep (6-7 hrs a night) throughout the course of their lives actually lived longer than people who got 8-10 hrs of sleep a night. So if you want to live longer, limit your sleep to like 7- 8 hrs a night as an adult. If you don't then get more sleep.  I hear it can weaken your sleep system... see the website below for more details.|`|0oDxnVx7aa	Bed Sores<br>  Laziness|`|YnlplIOOaa	Nothing, Isn't it good for you?

icgTII3Maa	Since doctors in England need to be registered to be able to make private prescriptions, you may need to look for another doctor who can. You may want to ask for a recommendation from your present doctor.<br>  <br>  The cost of the prescription may depend on how much the doctor charges for consultation or appointments. There is really no fixed price for it. You can also ask him on the refills.<br>  <br>  You also have to inform your doctor of the other medications you are taking so he would let you know if it interacts with Propecia or not.

This may be her way of dealing with it.<br>  <br>  Better than that, though, I think she should see a counselor.

If her experience was that traumatic then regardless of the imaginary friend or not she probably needs some kind of counseling.  I would suggest that she talk with someone, anyone.  Start with a school counselor and work from there.  Or have her talk with her doctor and get a recommendation.<br>  But 16 is kind of old to be having an imaginary friend.|`|9MXG3O74aa	I don't know I talk to myself but I don't have an imaginary friend.

Of course I can't say for certain because I don't know her or the circumstances, but most likely she has her imaginary friend because she doesn't feel comfortable with other people or like she can't get close to them.|`|M3Rz8pviaa	She doesn't have any problems. Shes absolutely fine. She may just want to talk to someone and nobody may be there at the time. Instead you should tell her, that wheneverr she needs to talk that you will be there for her. Don't worry, she doesnt have problems. But if she starts acting like this imaginary friend is real and wants to go places with her/him. Then; I'm not completely sure but you should get that checked out. And you also might want to ask her if shes just playing around ?|`|6d23830200d24363fd3bda7844f752bdaa	i wouldnt exactly say it is normal, but i dont think theres anything remarkably wrong with her either. Maybe having an imaginary friend heals her in some way, if thats why then you shouldnt be worried. But if the problem goes beyond than just having an imaginary friend, ie. hurting herself/other people around her then your cousin might need to seek some help. I dont know though, im not a psychiatrist -_-|`|XWb92lglaa	I'm 24 and have an imaginary friend. And I love him with all my heart.

Is it serious or just something to put up with? For most people eye twitching is not a serious condition and typically results from excessive fatigue or stress. For others eye twitching can lead to chronic irritation or vision problems.<br>  <br>  Causes of Eye Twitching<br>  There are various causes of eye twitching in its serious and not so serious formats. The more common causes for eye twitching include:<br>  <br>      * Corneal irritation or injury<br>      * Stress<br>      * Lack of sleep<br>      * Fatigue<br>      * Prolonged staring or eye strain<br>      * Neurological disorders<br>      * Possibly Hereditary <br>  <br>  Rest and relaxation often resolve most minor cases of eye twitching. If you experience more severe twitching your doctor may recommend BOTOX therapy or medication. In rare cases surgery may be recommended particularly if twitching is interfering with vision.<br>  <br>  Prevention is best when it comes to twitching. All in all you should work to relieve your stress and get as much rest as possible. If eye strain results in twitching, be sure you get plenty of breaks during the day to help rest your eyes and reduce the severity of your symptoms.<br>  <br>  It is always a good idea to consult with your eye doctor to discuss your options.|`|SW17FGBoaa	I get that sometimes, usually when I am under pressure or I am mentally tired. You don't have to by physically tired to feel tired, you can get tired from siting an exam, being bored or even trying to find things to do when there is noting to do!<br>  Try fully relaxing and getting a good nights sleep so you'll feel refreshed in every sense tomorrow morning.<br>  Good Luck!|`|TcMa4a7paa	It is called eye fatigue.  My former boss, who is a pharmacist, told me this.  You may not feel tired, but your eyes are tired of working.  Have you been doing a lot of reading or looking at the computer?  This used to happen to me when I was in school and studying a lot.  It could also be a sign that you are straining to see and may need an eye exam.|`|o6LrQTw6aa	It is tiredness. You don't have to feel tired for parts of your body to be tired. Make sure you get a good restful night sleep tonight. <br>  <br>  This happens to me sometimes when i'm busy/stressed. Before I go to bed I take a wash cloth and wet it with cold water (make sure to ring it out so it's damp). Then I place it over my eyes for about 30 minutes while I listen to music and lay down. It helps to relax you and de-stress you. then goto bed right after.|`|Mejzhipyaa	Mine does this when I get really stressed.

SjTAVdcKaa	Meats fish, dairy are highest in protein. The assimilation of the protein present in the foods is best in the egg. Chicken is about the lowest in fat.<br>  Low/no fat & cals? green vegetables - brocolli, spinach, peas.<br>  <br>  Uh...one gram fat has 9 cals, 1 gram protein or carb is four calories.|`|Ndr7D8BJaa	you can't really get low calorie/high protein foods because there are 4 calories in every gram of protein. what you need to do is look at how much protein is in a certain food. multiply that number by 4. if the number you get is larger than the calories from fat/fat content for that food, you're probably in good shape. for example:<br>  <br>  5g protein x 4 = 20 calories<br>  10g fat<br>  20-10 = 10<br>  <br>  if you need a lot of protein, try protein shakes.
KILFoc6kaa	Go to a doctor. It can be a sign of serious medical conditions.

Sometimes an infection is present for days or even weeks before other symptoms, such as burning occur. <br>  <br>  I have argued with my urologist when he thought I had an infection, (because I get alot of them due to chronic kidney stones, and thought I could be sure of when I had one) only to find out that I had a large asymptomatic infection, requiring antibiotics.<br>  <br>  If you want to nip it in the bud, consider drinking lots of water, wearing white cotton underwear, (or none) staying away from caffeine, sugar, and carbs, peeing before and after sex, and taking a cranberry capsule to regulate acid levels.|`|1QjAU7fraa	have you been tested for a UTI because that kind of sounds like it. also, if you drink more water than normal because you are trying to lose weight or are exercising more, then your body is just trying to get used to all the extra water. This could also be overactive bladder and you should go see your doctor.|`|82qhbW1waa	try not to drink water at least two hours before you go to bed-you might have an overactive bladder issue also. I have to wake up usually in the middle of the night to pee too-just because i drink a lot of water!|`|AkADuZrVaa	it could still be a uti you should get checked out its also a sign of diabetes.
6QbqhJbtaa	umm do you mean like love handles?<br>  well<br>  first of all i understand you might not want to go outside but it would help alot if you did.<br>  so number 1 thing to do is start a healthy diet the idea is to lose more calories than the amount you put in.<br>  so find your BMR which is your weight x 10 that is the amount of calories your body naturally burns a day doing nothing.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. drink 8 glasses of water <br>  <br>  3. cut out sweets. no more chips candy greasy junk all that stuff goes directly to your butt thighs and stomach.<br>  <br>  4.eat more vegetables and fruits and lots of fiber it is recommended to eat 25-30 grams of fiber a day.<br>  <br>  5.keep tack of your calorie intake in a notebook and eat around the amount of calories your body can burn( BMR).<br>  <br>  6. at times it is hard to stay motivated and you might just feel like eating sweet stuff and you feel like its not working remember it wont be an emidiate change. it is your body and you only get one so take care of it. show you care about yourself.<br>   <br>  7. try belly dancing!! it is really cool look for videos on youtube and dance to them trust me they actually work about 5 minutes and i was already sweating. also look up yoga and do it in the mornings to feel you with energy and stay positive you CAN do it.<br>  and for the ab execises go here<br>  <a href="http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abex...</a><br>  <br>  always eat breakfast but not like pancakes with syrup and cookies eat a cereal with fiber and a small fruit skipping meals does NOT work it slows down your metabolism.<br>  eat snacks too but i mean snacks like a few carrot sticks.<br>  <br>  if you get hungry eat but not until you get full just in small portions to keep your metabolism active.|`|LkgKagoYaa	I feel the same. You need to start feeling good about yourself ASAP. Im not gonna patronise you but things are always much worse than what they seem to you. But if you do feel you need to do something then go for it. <br>  The best way to loose weight is eat breakfast, lunch and a light dinner with two snacks. One which you have mid morning and the other an hour before bed time. When i mean snacks, i mean something healthy like an apple or fat free yoghurt. <br>  Its best to eat low GI foods (glycemic index). Reduce the amount of carbs you eat at dinner, increase the amount of vegetables etc<br>  The idea is cause a huge surge of your blood glucose levels. Products like cakes, donuts, white bread will do this and make you feel more tired. <br>  If by chance you do eat something naughty, balance it out with a piece of fruit. <br>  Let exercise be your new best friend. You need to do squats, and aerobic movements. Look on youtube for things like pilates or body balance. They are the kinda things you should be doing. If not, hit the gym. <br>  <br>  Good luck! x

OleVPkJgaa	Acrocyanosis is blueness of the extremities (the hands and feet). Acrocyanosis is typically symmetrical. It is marked by a mottled blue or red discoloration of the skin of the fingers and wrists and the toes and ankles and by profuse sweating and coldness of the fingers and toes.<br>  <br>  Acrocyanosis is caused by narrowing (constriction) of small arterioles (tiny arteries) toward the end of the arms and legs.<br>  <br>  good choice taking her to the doctor's. A discoloration in the extremeties gives signs of poor blood circulation, so maybe if not Acrocyanosis, she may have an underlying disorder that is causes the constriction of her blood flow. Hope its nothing too serious! :D|`|Um75aRZFaa	There is a long list of things that can cause cyanosis. If she has a cough it is probably croup's or another variation of lung infection.

pRF5LLloaa	Probably not.<br>  <br>  The key is that you are GAINING weight.  Diabetics LOOSE weight.<br>  <br>  Diabetes canNOT be diagnosed by symptoms alone.  There are too many diseases that have many of the same symptoms as diabetes, including puberty.  It is VERY common to be thirsty in winter -- the weather is much drier.  And when you drink a lot -- you pee a lot.  So many of your symptoms may be due to weather!<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to diagnose diabetes is by having the doctor take blood tests.|`|lvfPrS6saa	I know those are the exact symptoms of dogs and cats.If I were you I would see a dooctor immediately.|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Sounds like diabetes to me. The usual symptoms are frequent urination, excessive thirst, feeling tired, blurred vision and weight changes.|`|pC0GVZCcaa	Being contantly thrirsty, very tired and needing to pee more often are more often than not a cause of diabetes. <br>  <br>  You should definately go get checked out if you are in doubt.

HlD9dRF2aa	You must understand that YOU DO NOT GET STRONGER WHEN YOU WORK OUT.  <br>  <br>  You get stronger AFTER the workout when your body has a chance to repair and adapt.<br>  <br>  Try not to do the same thing two days in a row unless it is low intensity endurance work.  Take at least 1 or 2 days off a week.  It is easy to overtrain -- you often hear people say, "I've been working out every day but I don't understand why I'm getting weaker/slower/tired more easily."  You know they've been overdoing it.|`|2RzEaod9aa	As long as you aren't going there working the same thing each time and allow proper rest for your muscle groups that you worked, you'll be fine. I used to workout up to 17 times a week and I didn't get burnt out at all.|`|EertNe9Taa	I would make sure to have at least 2 solid days of not going to the gym at all. Secondly sure you can go to the gym the other 5 days, just make sure you segregate your muscle groups and work only 1-2 muscle groups a day. That way the day you will give them time to repair while you work on a different muscle group.|`|a5MzSF5qaa	depends on what you do. As long as you switch muscle groups you can gym everyday. Do arms and chest one day then legs the next. Throw some cardio in along the way. Just switch it up.|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	Or switch it up between cardio (running, swimming) and strength.

(Usually in older people though.) I would actually recommend seeing a Chiropractor for a couple visits, they should be able to fix the problem, and keep it from happening again.|`|V6dz395kaa	your diaphram (not the right spelling) is under neath the rib cage and that helps you to breathe.

5PIgZ7tFaa	You have a life of your own, and you need to live it. There is no good reason for you to quit your job in NY to go to SA where you are probably not going to know anybody.<br>     If he can't live without you, then that means he will be that much quicker getting back to you.It's kind of unfair for him to want you to give up your job that you have worked so hard at. It was probably unwise for him to start a business on the other side of the world. He should be concentrating on the business where he lives.<br>     Don't quit your job, it is your independence. If he truly loves you, he'll go to SA by himself, do whatever he needs to do, and come back as quickly as he can. It will be a test of your relationship, but if it's solid, there won't be any problem. <br>     Your happiness and hard work counts as much as his does. The economy being the way it is, quitting a job is very unwise. The people you care about are in NY, and everyone needs a support system. Stay put. Your relationship will only get stronger.|`|jaGU3zyyaa	If he's only going for a couple of months, you stay here and maintain the home until he returns.  True love will survive the separation.|`|TdIbrGYYaa	Dear heart, relationships are all about compromise!  If this is what needs to be done for the business to succeed then it has to be done.  Your only choice to make is if you are going with him?  Sounds to me like he's a great guy.  He's at least giving you that option.  Oh, and it is an option.  He wants you to be part of that journey because he is building the relationship with you by trying to keep the finances in order.  Your job now is to "support" him but by choice.  Maybe throw some suggestions out there like, you stay in NY during the week for work but go and visit him on the weekends.  Or flip flop the idea and do every other weekend so that he too can depart for a bit a still feel like he fits in with your world.  Honestly though, if this is his request it's because he wants you there and you should feel honored because so many would just leave with no communication about it.  It's only two months and two months will fly by.  You could even view it as a mini vacation.  Love, honor (this means,listen, uplift and team play) and support- That's what has kept me married for 14 years.  Good Luck!|`|pRF5LLloaa	Only for a couple of months?<br>  <br>  What's the big deal?!?!  YOU are being selfish, and getting in the way of his improving himself, which would make him a better husband.<br>  <br>  You need to insist that he go, and go without you, and that you will be right in the same place when he returns.  <br>  <br>  If the two of you are REALLY in love, these "fears" of separation are totally uncalled for.  If he "can't and won't" go without you, then that means that he mistrusts you, thinking you will "sneak around" on him while he is gone -- or maybe he fears that HE will "sneak around" on YOU while he is in SA!<br>  <br>  After a 4-year relationship, if that basic level of trust isn't in your relationship, you probably have shaky relationship, and a poor chance of making it together in marriage.<br>  <br>  A short term separation like this is just NOT a situation that a truly loving couple would even worry about.  A truly loving couple would meet a challenge like this without blinking an eye, because they KNOW that their life and relationship WILL be there when they get back together.<br>  <br>  There is a good possibiluity that he will want to return to SA permanently.  That's OK, too.  You BOTH can make that decision later, after you're married.|`|6utUL9Hiaa	I'd be a little upset at the fact that he wanted to start a business so far away when your life together is in NY.

Yet we find the walls restrictive as well as protective.  Often we find we have built walls unconsciously, and when we discover them, we are not sure how to tear them down.  The answer is to wear them down, not to tear them down.  Wear the walls down by reaching through them, reaching out to others and opening yourself to others.  Sometimes you will get burned, but if you continue to make the effort to be open and to reach out, the wall you have built around yourself will be filled with doors and windows through which you can reach out and others can come in.|`|K1rUaOqWaa	it happens we get depressed from time to time but it's ok everything is gonna be fine because there is always light at the end of the tunnel. :)|`|7B9hncCXaa	I think that we all have felt like this before, even though it does not seem like it this feeling will end shortly.|`|DIzRyRS9aa	if you were more comfortable and happy with being yourself before, then go back to that.<br>  honestly, forget about the "popular" group. everyone's friends change after high school, and you make tons of new friends in college.<br>  <br>  From about 8th through my 10th grade year, I used to be a so called "popular" student, but I never felt right.

mLeEQpwHaa	This nomenclature is happening in this country as well.<br>  <br>  I think that surgery is the most expensive phase of health care because you have the most highly paid professionals (surgeon, assistants, anaesthetist, charge nurse, and others) to pay for in this part of treatment.  Everything, including instruments, mops, cleaning equipment, sterilisation etc. is charged at the highest price possible.<br>  <br>  The "aftercare" of patients of any age and condition, can be given by so-called registered carers or enrolled nurses, with only the supervision done by properly registered nurses.  Interns and medical residents will take care of perhaps, a daily round.<br>  <br>  This will leave surgeons and other medical practitioners with far less possibility of malpractice suits.  Admittedly they do already pay an extremely high rate of insurance against this.<br>  <br>  Hopefully intensive care units will be included in these "centres of excellence".<br>  <br>  In my opinion it is merely a way of separating the rich from the poor in another way of stating the case.  Of course pensioners and "sinful"<br>  people who smoke, drink alcohol or work in dangerous conditions to support their families will be denied the medical care they so desperately need.<br>  <br>  In this country govt. is more concerned with importing foreign trained doctors than in training our own.<br>  <br>  Absolutely nothing is done in the correct way any more.<br>  <br>  Sorry gussie you have picked the subject which is so close to my heart.  I may have been rather cynical here.|`|01a27d61adc33c89cc6ffac93373db73aa	i would think that the post op recovery phase is more costly than the actual procedure.  For instance, when patients go in for surgery be it elective or emergent, they have this tendancy to have multiple co-morbidities that negatively impact on patient outcomes.  The cost of the room, equipment, supplies, varied treatments add up.  I would have to do a cost analysis, but I believe for the majority of procedures( surgical) the cost of that aspect must have some government control.  <br>  Far too many people live unhealthier lives and this also takes a toll on the recovery process.  More patients are in the geriatric group for a majority of these major surgical interventions.  Not to mention if we then have to deal with greater number of bariatric patients.  These are the patients that are morbidly obese,  These patients also put an increased cost on the recovery process and the length of stays are then magnified.  <br>  I hope this answers your question.|`|WWT45CEzaa	the pos orp care cost will be more expensive<br>   for you may need to be there a few day
a76629fcd8dd30887d6f5348489ce42faa	If you're working different muscle groups then it will be OK, but not optimal.  Definitely a bad idea if you are hitting the same muscle group.  Even someone on steroids wont recover quickly enough to have an optimal workout the next morning.<br>  <br>  As someone else said.  You need to give a muscle about 48 hours rest before hitting it again.  Plus you don't want to work a muscle group more than twice a week.  Research has shown that working a muscle group 3 or more times per week actually retards muscle growth.<br>  <br>  Personally I tend to do cardio in the am and weights in the pm.

tkDfqjQdaa	It depends on what you are using as the herbs.  You can make a sweet and soothing base of honey and add either already prepared herbal extracts or simply powdered herb to the honey base.  Honey is a natural preservative but you should still keep whatever you make in the refrigerator.  Otherwise you could make a strong tea of the herbs and add that to honey.  If the herb is a leaf or flower, just pour boiling water over the herb and let it steep for 10-15 minutes.  If you are using root, bark or seeds you will need to simmer them in water for 10-15 minutes.  Be sure to bruise seeds (crush slightly) before adding to the water.  Here is a wonderful recipe base for a cough syrup that you can add powdered, extracted or infused herbs to.<br>  <br>  Chop one red onion and 4-5 cloves of garlic and place in a glass or ceramic container.  Completely cover the onion and garlic with raw honey and let it steep at least 8-12 hours.  Strain out the solids and be sure to squeeze it to get all the honey and liquids out.  At this point add your herbs, put in an airtight container and keep in the refrigerator.

What they are talking about is the chemical precursor to most plastics, Benzene, a six membered carbon ring with continuous double bonding which has been shown to cause cancer in the human body because it can convert into benzene oxide, which can have detrimental effects to the structure of DNA.  Benzene is colorless and it has a boiling point of 80.1 degrees celsius, which means that it will degrade with heat before water can boil ) Products that you should worry more about are sodas (or anything which contains the preservatives Sodium Benzoate or Benzoic acid, etc.), tobacco smoke, and car exhaust.  You can also have your groundwater tested for Benzene and its derivatives.  Bottled soda can have somewhat more benzene than the World Health Organization standards say it should during photochemical processes.  Photochemical degradation of the plastic bottles that hold drinks like soda (or bottled water for that matter) can lead to an increase in the amount of benzene derivatives in that soda (did you ever wonder why bottled water tastes strange after you leave it in the sun for too long? Benzene is colorless and it has a boiling point of 80.1 degrees celsius, which means that it will degrade with heat before water can boil).  Some soda manufacturers are more careful about this and try to limit the amount of preservatives in their drinks.  You should always check the ingredients of your food and drink because consuming a lot of any kind of preservatives can be harmful to your body.|`|5TPsr3c5aa	Not at all... <br>  <br>  Cold climate actually causes molecules to stick together... you will not consume any toxins within the plastic because they cannot be separated.<br>  <br>  This is the opposite of heating plastic in which then you should be worried.|`|4j3CwEnLaa	not until u fill the plastic ice cube trays with water till a level. if u pour more water it may just break the tray but its not dangerous and could u please tell me why u asked this question?|`|rndrIjkyaa	If it were, why would they sell it?<br>  Think about it.|`|Gz1mNE2Kaa	NO..|`|wwP3ONCFaa	Likely you’re referring to the potential dangers of polycarbonate plastics—often used in reusable water bottles, clear plastic food-storage containers and some baby bottles. Polycarbonates contain bisphenol-A (BPA), an estrogenlike chemical also used in the linings of some food and drink cans. Studies link BPA to the development of precancerous lesions and abnormal development of reproductive systems in animals. While BPA can leach into food and drinks, whether it actually affects human health currently is not known.<br>  <br>  What is known is that we’re all exposed to plenty of the chemical. In a 2005 study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control, 95 percent of people screened tested positive for BPA.<br>  <br>  A study published in early 2008 in Toxicology Letters suggested that hot liquids and foods exacerbate leaching in BPA-containing plastics. When researchers poured boiling water into polycarbonate drinking bottles, it caused up to 55 times more BPA to seep out than room-temperature water had.<br>  <br>  Consumer concern peaked in April after the National Toxicology Program (part of the National Institutes of Health) issued a draft report noting that, given the current science, the possibility couldn’t be ruled out. In September 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said that BPA is safe for adults and children at current exposure levels.<br>  <br>  Whether washing containers in hot water causes them to break down and release BPA the next time they’re used isn’t clear: only a handful of studies have been conducted, and results are conflicting. While heating these plastics in the microwave hasn’t been studied, it’s not recommended. “We assume there is increased leaching with any kind of heating,” says Anila Jacob, M.D., a senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Manufacturers currently aren’t required to label BPA so there’s no way of knowing if it’s present in the plastics or cans you use. For now, the best way to reduce your exposure is to use stainless steel, glass or plastics labeled “BPA-free.” If you’re not sure about a product, recommends Jacob, call the manufacturer.|`|n7U9YqBSaa	no|`|hRNpGnktaa	There has been arguments to suggest that the plastic used in ice trays, over a period of time, can exert production chemicals into the water. This is the same for some water bottles aswell, in the case of reusing them, refilling with water and whatnot. Whether these chemicals are dangerous to humans has been looked into and if they even do release chemicals. the case with water bottles has been proved and new regulations go into thier production.. But chances are its totally safe, now enjoy a nice orange juice on the rocks and stop worrying|`|peckUVpzaa	No why would you think that?

dkEUJPhnaa	Life is hard when you feel alone in the world, but what you have to realize is that there are people who can help. Obviously your half-sister is playing a big part in this problem so get that sorted out first. Of course all siblings fight but if it's getting you really down then try talking to either your parents or have a one on one chat with her. Just tell her you're having a hard time at the moment and would appreciate it if she left you alone for a while, and if that doesn't work either write a letter to explain your view better of get away from her for a couple of days just to get some space and relax. Then when you get home again just stay away from her if possible and don't react when she says things as this is what she wants.<br>  Friends are a hard subject as well. If you can't be yourself around them then they are not your true friends. Maybe you could try interacting with other people or at least try to be you for a day around them. I was in your position and I finally made the decision to leave the group, even if it meant being on my own. <br>  Maybe it would be good for you to see a counsellor, you don't have to be clinically depressed to see one but they are always a big help when you have nobody to talk to. Try seeing if there's one in school and make an appointment just to talk things through.<br>  It's not petty and silly at all, in fact it's great that you want help.

However, having said this, I think that you are far more fortunate than you realise. Your parents have spiritual values far greater than most "modern" parents, I know, I was a teenager in the 60s and we did and believed things totally differently then. <br>  <br>  I can't help you find the right balance, or advise you how to cope, that has to come from inside you, but you are obviously an intelligent and talented young woman and I'm sure your problems are only temporary.

You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise.

When breast cancer has overwhelmed the body’s natural defenses and spread this far by the time the cancer is first diagnosed, the 5-year survival rate drops to 16%-20% in the United States (American Cancer Society).<br>  <br>  Up to 5% of white women in the U.S., and up to 9% of black women have advanced breast cancer spread to distant tissue at the time of first diagnosis. This difference is usually attributed to poverty and lack of health insurance.<br>  <br>  In general, women who have advanced breast cancer at the time of diagnosis live approximately 18 months after diagnosis (median survival rate). Those who are still alive five years after their diagnosis of advanced breast cancer can live an additional 3.5 years (median survival rate) according to the American Cancer Society.<br>  <br>  Since this is the most deadly category of breast cancer, it is important to work closely with all the health care providers. New treatments are being developed all the time, and second, or even third opinions may give the patient more information about newly discovered successful solutions.<br>  <br>  Early detection is clearly the most important factor in breast cancer survival rates. Breast cancer detected at Stage 1 while it is still localized to the breast has a survival rate of 98%-100%, while metastasized breast cancer first detected at Stage 4 drops down to 16%-20%.<br>  <br>  Early detection procedures must include monthly self-examinations done at the same time each month. From age 20-40, healthy women should have clinical breast exams performed by their health care providers every three years. After age 40, the breast exams should be annually and should include a mammogram or similar procedure.<br>  <br>  North American white women have the highest rates of breast cancer in the world, but the 5-year survival rate for all stages (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, and Stage 4) combined is 88% for the U.S. A recent study found European countries have lower 5-year breast cancer survival rates, with England at 77.8% and Ireland at 76.2% (Lancet Oncology).<br>  <br>  The difference in these survival rates is usually attributed to life-saving early detection.|`|goY0JHzlaa	sweet Julia,<br>      It really depends on how your mom's body responds to the treatment.

They train for around 3-4 hours every day, then hit the gym six times a week, doing weights and such to build up their muscles so they can power through the water. So if you workout by swimming you'll definitely slim down and tone up, but your muscles will not become bulky.|`|lbnfDXsHaa	Swimmers also do plenty of weight training, ab workouts, and other conditioning activities such as running, stretch cords, and balance activities.

It does sound to me like implantation.<br>  What i would do is wait till this spotting has gone, give it a couple of days then take a test, whatever the result i would see your doctor so you can confirm your opinion but get a more accurate one to.

In fact, it could be the reason why you cannot gain weight -- your body is badly imbalanced.  You are full of useless, empty calories from too much sugar, and not getting the proper nutrients your body needs to grow.  It is almost certain that the sugar is the cause of your "edginess" and possibly the facial tics.<br>  <br>  You will maintain your body weight, maybe even gain weight, if you eat a BALANCED diet, including  red meats and vegetables.<br>  <br>  But yes, cut WAY BACK on the sugar.|`|2vReTqyYaa	Calories is a big subject when it comes to weight loss. We need to know three definitions: the number of calories in our food, the number of calories a specific activity expends hourly, and last but not least our own personal daily limit of calories.

Lift weights and you'll start to build muscle and gain weight. Eating all that sugar probably is causing your anxiety.|`|SFZOZK39aa	no because sugar is a carbohydrates|`|XmUQdS2caa	Well it depends what you need to gain wieght for.<br>  <br>  The sugar is not healthy...it makes your very jittery and when you stop to lay down you probably crash. Meats and grains are usually a good source of nutrients but if your a vegetarian eat alot of pasta and breads.<br>  <br>  Sugar is not a good source of calories but you also gotta think of what your eating. You probably dont gain the weight because your burniong off the sugar from those sugar rushes you get. Proteins are good for the cells in your body keeping them healthy and also usually the foods help maintain your weight. And sugar probably burns your weight and probably why you cant maintain it.<br>  <br>  Only have a low amounts of sugar.<br>  <br>  Its simple biology. Calorie is a measure of heat energy given off when its tested. The calories are energy and so is sugar, which contains alot of calories. Calorie is not used it stores as fat and then is not used till you exercise or lack food which gives energy.|`|aP8L8LZeaa	Don't listen to the spam. <br>  <br>  Regardless of if you're overweight or at a normal weight, high amounts of processed, refined sugar is NOT good for your body. In the long run, it may affect you through diabetes. <br>  <br>  Dieting if not for losing weight-- it's a lifestyle style..Which means eating healthy and staying active.

c2Q6YEJvaa	hi! I ALWAYS have a blocked up nose and ive found several natural ways to relieve this-<br>  <br>  one- reflexology - rub and massage the sides of your toes (this may be a bit tender as they get sore if you have sinus problems) do this for a good 20 minutes, maybe while watching tv. This clears my nose.<br>  <br>  two - hold both your thumbs at your eye socket where your eyebrows start and push....this should hurt!. thats a direct pressure point to your sinus, hold for 10-15secs and release, repeat at neccessary.<br>  <br>  or 3- hold your breath for as long as you possibly can, and i mean as long as you can. your body , as a reflex, will unblock your nose allowing you to breathe. <br>  <br>  <br>  all 3 of these unblock my nose, just depends on your body.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|wIoG2KV2aa	Use a Nedi Pot.

31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	This is common.  The condom is an interfereence to many in this way.  Also soft erection are common also.  You should never not initiate a sexual act on the premises of a proposed possible failure of this or any other kind.  Its difficult enough for the act to succeed without further stress.<br>  <br>  Its no big deal.  Sometimes he might be stressed by other issues.  Smoking , Drugs, Beer, Wine, or a recent masturbation could all have played a role.  If you think hes not that way, then think again.  Perhaps 99 percent of the males you encounter on the street have masturbated within several hours from the time your see them.  Leaving home like the energizer bunny is rare for me.  I avoid that at all costs.<br>  <br>  Given this it might just mean that the condom placed added complexity in an act otherwise done with out the interruption.  As soon as the body detects that you are not having sex it can shut down the errection thinking you don't require it anymore.  They need constant upkeep to be so maintained.  Position and relaxation are what bring them on.<br>  <br>  If he is not relaxed then forget it.  He is never getting there.  If he is relaxed then with time it will arrive like on its own.  So the problem can feed itself.  The more issues the more stress the more issues.<br>  <br>  Stressing about a softy only brings on more of that.  <br>  <br>  It might also be of interest that if he is licking you down there... You know what I am talking about...  Then the sent and taste of this trigger erections.   So have him start with you first.  While some people do not like going down on a girl, what they are doing is forgetting that doing this will turn the male on like an animal.<br>  <br>  It a secret that I have known of for a long time.  Now you know it. It has something to do with triggers.  Your fluids and smell there guarantee a very hard male in record time.  Some males may not like the smell and taste.  This is because they are not use to it.  Its like beer.  Most kids find the taste to be bad.  Later in life you cannot separate beer from them.<br>  <br>  I never use to go down on a girl.  Then I got in with the program and now its like the very first thing I go for.  Even when my girl says she feels smelly or dirty its great.  The reason is girls are always particular about this area.<br>  <br>  Much more so then we are when we have gotten past being kids.  An adult males has no issues there.  A teen may still have only done it one time at most.  So that is the key, and your best answer.   You can get him hard.  Relax him and start with you.  Let the erection come to you not the other way around.<br>  <br>  YOUR BEST ANSWER..    What do you say...  Do I get my points..?|`|H24DtUKOaa	Alcohol inhibits sexual capacity.<br>  Apart from that, you can't imagine how hard (pun intended) it is for a guy to sustain an erection throughout sex for a relatively long time with a condom. It makes very little difference for a girl, but (sorry for being graphic) imagine if your clitoris was covered by latex. It wouldn't be too fun!<br>  Maybe take the COC pill? My girlfriend does and the sex is amazing<br>  Good Luck|`|l1QzfK8uaa	it wasnt the condom i blame it on the alcohol. When drinking it inpairs the whole body. Not just the brain.

Here is why, alcohol is a blood thinner and it isn't running through the body very well.

It can occur due to both physiological and psychological reasons, Common physiological reasons include cardiovascular leakage, diabetes, fatigue, exhausted penis which is under pain(due to lactic acid formation) and yet to recover, etc. I think the issue is inclined towards psychological cause. He may possibly hide some trauma, sad incidents(recent), etc to you and his mind is engaged with so many thoughts, even while love making. He was not able to concentrate and enjoy the act fully, since the earthy thoughts never leaves one and makes him preoccupied all the time. It arieses like blinking. It is certain, even though you two have consumed alchohol. He have to rectify his problems at first, then forget all the memories of failure, and finally enjoy the lust with new vigor and charm.

fErpHX47aa	Hi, <br>  <br>  Yes, there are serious risks - this is not quite the same as buying a car. Technically you cannot go blind from refractive laser eye treatment, laser eye treatment occurs on the cornea, not the retina. That isn't to say that your vision cannot be damaged. Certainly the level of vision that you see now with glasses or contacts may not be as good after laser treatment. There are a number of reasons for this including LASIK flap complications, scarring, haze, DLK. regressive prescription, post operative bio-mechanic shift, post-Lasik ectasia etc etc. The list goes on, most consent forms are 4 pages at least. (Makes the Lifetime Guarantee that most companies offer seem rather redundant.) However, until you have actually had a full consultation everything is hypothetical. You may well turn out to be a suitable candidate, equally you could walk in and find out you have keratoconus.<br>  <br>  My advice would be as follows:<br>  <br>  1. Visit www.lasik-eyes.co.uk and start researching. <br>  2. Have a few consultations, not one, get at least 2.<br>  3. Give Optical Express, Optimax and Ultralase a wide berth - their business ethic, safety and technology are quite inferior (my opinion, having worked for different clinics).<br>  4. Get treated with the company that you trust the most - every company will tell you they have the best technology, Lifetime Guarantees etc - most of them are bending statistics, nor would you have to sign a prohibitive consent form if they guaranteed anything. <br>  5. Take your time to make decisions, DO NOT book your surgery on the same day as your consultation - if you later decide not to proceed you will likely have difficulty in getting your deposit back.|`|rRQNDpwVaa	I had laser surgery done by Optimax several years ago.  It took me about 3 days before I was back to 'normal' but I think that's improved a lot now.  My surgery was a bit painful for day 1, but I had to get the underground train and then the normal train home which was at least a 2 hour journey home.  The next time we went by car it was better, as I found it better to just lay back, keep still and keep my eyes shut, as moving them aggravated them.  It really was the very best thing I have ever done though, it is wonderful being able to see so clearly, especially in the rain!|`|qxdUzCCDaa	Not so serious if you get a good treatment done but there can be some itchiness and uncomfortable feeling after the surgery.if that happens there are some creams and mediciness to put.But hey! what's life without risks?<br>  <br>  -everything will be fine. B.O.L for the surgery<br>  <br>  Camper Girl|`|47i1KYEsaa	They now have a new method called intralysic. It will take 10 min only to done that. You'll have an eye drop which is anesthetic. You'll feel nothing at all. Then they'll ask you to stare at an orange or red dotted light. 3 min and they'll shift to the another, and another 3 min. volla it is done. The only thing that it might be a little anxiety is to let you stare at the light dot where is there some clips to hold your eye from being closed. Be patient. The best thing I ever had is I now see things clearly from before without having my glassed on.<br>  <br>  After the surgery, you'll feel your eyes are dry for some time, it is normal to feel like this but it will go by the time. Keep taking whatever eye drops the doc said and you'll be amazed from the result. I have done in 2 years now and it is the best thing I ever had.

EmW5bVz3aa	1. Ok, I don't know about you but if someone hits me in my vagina, ill beat them. But no you shouldn't<br>  2. If you put the tampon in right you wont feel it at all. If you do feel it, and its uncomfortable change it right away.<br>  3. You can use a tampon whenever you are ready for it.<br>  4. It is very unlikely to get a tampon stuck in you. All tampons are made with a string that hangs out of the vagina so its easy to take out.|`|AA10803292	do you have a mother or close female?...ask them.|`|9dqG2ZSRaa	why would you ask that <br>  yes <br>  i wouldn't <br>  i hope not|`|oAH71drxaa	1. No it won't hurt any more than being hit whilst not wearing one.<br>  2. Generally you can't feel a tampon once it's inside of you but if you haven't pushed it in fully you may be aware of it.<br>  3. You can start wearing a tampon whenever you want at first its probably easiest to use applicator tampons and if you're finding it hard to insert try using a mirror and a bit of vaseline on the top.<br>  4. No there is no way a tampon can get stuck in you, there is no where for it to go. However if the string goes into your vagina it can be hard to find and it may feel as though you have lost it. If this happens put one foot on the toilet or a surface and relax, using your fingers try and get the tampon out from inside your vagina. If you still can't get it it's not lost but go and see the doctor to get it out. This should be done a.s.a.p as tampons left in over 6-8 hours can put the wearer at increased risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS)|`|ioY0rwmwaa	No it won't hurt but why would someone hit you in the first place.<br>  <br>  You can't feel it inside you. If you can feel it then it's not in high enough. Get the ones with the applicators.<br>  <br>  You can use tampons from your first period<br>  <br>  It won't get stuck inside you because the string is outside so you can pull it out to change it. <br>  <br>  <br>  I'd advise you use tampons as they are cleaner and you can't feel the blood leave your body like pads. With pads your constantly aware that they are there and feel like you're in a nappy. You can just forget about it with tampons and go about your everyday life.|`|JFbWyKKDaa	1. No... it's too muscular and when the hell has anyone hit you in the vagina?<br>  2. You can't feel a tampon while it's in you if you put it in far enough.  It's held in place by the vaginal wall.<br>  3. Yes, I did and it was a lot better than a pad... a pad feels like you have some kind of diaper on... you can't feel a tampon so it great!<br>  4. No the tampon is held in place by the vaginal wall and your cervix stops the tampon from getting lost in your body.<br>  <br>  Buy a box and most of those questions will be in there... the answers will be similar to mine. Your period is kind of a coming of age thing and it should be celebrated... welcome to womanhood!|`|PmWzhGP3aa	The tampon wont hurt if you get hurt, but the getting hit might! <br>  <br>    If you can feel a tampon it is not in properly, needs top be pushed in further.<br>  <br>  Ok, if youve just started your period, satrt with the small or mini ones<br>  <br>  Cant get stuck in you, make sure string is hanging out of you, if it does get stuck , see doctoer imdiately, as toxic shock can become a problem<br>  <a href="http://www.tampax.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tampax.com/</a><br>  loads of info here|`|MlDs21jAaa	My question to you is why would someone hit you in that area??<br>  <br>  1. No, as you can't feel it if it is properly inserted in you.<br>  2. No. (Like i said in #1) Most tampon packages come with directions and visual aids to help first time users; the placement of it can be kinda tricky at first, and does take a few times to get it right. After insertion, and you've washed your hands and put clothes back, sit down on like a chair or something. You shouldn't feel anything. My best advice for insertion, is to put as much of the applicator inside of you before placing the tampon. <br>  3. I didn't use a tampon until about 2 years into my period, probably like 14/15. I just wasn't comfortable with it, and my mom wasn't either. I think it's all up to each individual girl to decide what is best for you.<br>  4. There is a string attached at the end of a tampon, for most anyways, so that it can be easily removed. And also, at the end of your vagina is your cervix which only opens during labor, unless I've been misinformed. Anyways, the muscles of your vagina will keep it in place from moving anywhere, unles YOU move it. In very rare and freakish accidents has anything serious every occurred, or a tampon moving by itself. Just make sure you don't leave one in longer than 6-8 hours I believe is their recommendation, and don't use an absorbency that is higher than your period flow. It can increase your risk of TSS.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :o)|`|IygYP5E9aa	1. it does not hurt. it just kinda feels funny<br>  2. no you dont feel it at all<br>  3. no wear a pad first then when you feel like you are ready, wear a tampon<br>  4. no it cant. unless the string brakes, but even then it will come out with a doctor or you help. i wear tampons all the time, and not once has that happened to me<br>  hope this helps!|`|9gg5v529aa	1. if you are wearing a tampon and someone hits your vagina will it hurt<br>   It really won't hurt anymore than getting hit in the vagina normally would haha. <br>  <br>  2. do you feel a tampon in you<br>  You can if it isn't in far enough, but if its put in correctly you shouldn't be able to feel it. if its your first time using them make sure you get the smallest size just to make it more comfortable. <br>  <br>  3. should you use a tampon when you just started you first period<br>  it doesn't really matter, its whatever you feel more comfortable using. i didn't use tampons until a couple years after i got my period for the first time because i just wasn't comfortable using them at the time. <br>  <br>  4.can it get stuck in you<br>  no, theirs a handy little string that you use to pull it out with, as long as thats on there theirs no reason for it to get stuck.

W8aiAWe2aa	I would continue taking the Omeprazole. Never stop it without your GP's advise. The omeprazole reduces the acid in your stomach hence why the pain has gone. If you stop taking it the pain will most likely return.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  The smoothies are healthy so I would not stop them.<br>  eat slower. Have plenty of carbs in your diet and low saturated fat.<br>  I've had this kind of pain and it is not nice.<br>  Once the course id finished see how it goes and if the pain returns then go back to the GP who may refer you for a gastroscopy.|`|koAaPXKQaa	You should always take the full prescribed amount.

Could be that you have a hiatus hernia which can produce the symptoms you mentioned especially the pain and cramps.

Meantime keep a food diary so that you know what if anything that brings on these attacks.|`|RNNdRHrMaa	Are the doctors sure as to what the reason for the pain is?<br>  I ask simply because if you are getting pain after eating a chinese, chances are it could have been the fat content rather than the acid, and that your gallbladder is playing up.<br>  <br>  I am on Omeprazole as I had my gallbladder out last year.

(14 days) you should take maybe like two more? and just eat less acid foods, also for dinner eat 2-3 hours earlier before you go to bed.|`|N0b14EDIaa	I take this every day (via a doctors prescription) for a Hiatus hernia, so in the right dose it's reletively safe. But it does not work immidiately but blocks acid production over time. I would suggest you follow the doctors prescription and no more! and reduce the overeating. Try eating little & often to keep hunger away & drink plenty of water to help your system re-balance!

But listen you are 14 years old and don't have to worry about it so much, I know easier said then done I'm 18 and I know that it's hard with all the pressure from people at school, boys,and all the stars. Just remember that there is soooo much more to you than the way you look. A girl your age should be eating at least 1,800 calories a day. It may sound like a lot just do it right with fruits and vegetables. Get daily exercise and plenty of sleep. So remember that your young so have a little fun and try not to worry about you're weight so much if you were to gain a couple of lbs that would be fine. At your age your matabolism is very fast. I hope I helped!!!

44b90c053b01c2794d2454eb16fcbea1aa	I would say adding 1 cup of milk to your smoothies is sufficient amount.<br>  <br>  Your diet is full of fruits (which is higher in sugar, and usually calories). I also don't see any vegetables at all. You need to add veggies to your diet...perhaps a salad along with dinner, and some vegetables with your lunch rather than the strawberry yogurt. (You're already having a stawberry smoothie as a snack.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	Agree this is too high in sugar and not enough vegetables and salad.<br>  I would go for plain natural yoghurt instead of flavoured, and natural pot set yoghurt has many times more gut friendly bacteria.<br>  The skim milk is a good source of calcium but you might want to eat less fats from animals and more unsaturated oils. <br>  I would add some fish or at least some fish oil capsules if you don't like seafood. Canned tuna and salmon with bones can replace some of that milk to keep your calcium content.<br>  Maybe rice can replace pasta sometimes since too much wheat can cause problems for some.<br>  But on the whole not bad compared to many people's diets.
0mSpQjzCaa	I agree with ANGELA J on this one.   I feel like if it was any thing serious it would have developed fully by know instead of small little things.  I know from experience that when you are worried you seem too be consumed with noticing every little pain.   I got to the point of being overwhelmed with the fact I was dying.  I thought I had colon cancer because there is a history of it in my family.  I would have panic attacks, for sure thought I was a goner.  I know how scary it is.  After all my test ruled there was nothing wrong, my dr. prescribe a antidepressant, and it worked wonders I was able to get back to my normal life.  I don't even have to take them any more it was just for a short while to get me over this.  Find a dr. you feel comfortable with and talk to him about your feelings.

This condition would make you feel that tingle sensation that you described. or two...GERDS.  I suffer from GERDS, and I do at times get a burning sensation, and a stabbing pain.<br>    Next time you see your doctor, ask him or her about either of these two things.<br>    I know it is scarey, but try and relax because I know from experience that googling all the symptoms only makes you worry more, and worry and stress will make your symptoms so much worse!

6d7m0kWWaa	One thing to keep in mind, I've read books by some psychologists who say that if you watch a lot of porn you become attracted more to the idea of the SCENARIO than the woman herself.  Have you found yourself thinking of porn (scripts, positions) even when your girlfriend was there?  If so, the porn might already be changing the way you are attracted to girls, which is a bad thing.  <br>  Some things I have found: don't try to avoid porn, it doesn't work.  Start even before that.  Avoid gateway sites, avoid erotic pictures.  Work on disciplining your sex drive: learn to turn it off when you want to.  Instead of worrying about not being able to get an erection, see how long you can go AVOIDING one by thinking about something else (not dangerous, don't worry).  <br>  I managed to completely reset my mind by doing this for a week, it made me better able to control my internet use and better able to relate to women.  Of course, you can't stop after a week, but you can re-evaluate things.<br>  <br>  Yes, you are 15, but that doesn't mean you'll get over things.

The problem is: how to set you free.<br>  <br>  From my own experience: face the devil & flee from temptations.<br>  Find out how bad pornography is, how it can break relationships and 'poison' your mind, affecting your body and soul. Unlike alcohol, smoking, or drugs; pornography adiction is purely mind matter. You can be free without any physical therapy. But you do need some help. Maybe you can try these out:<br>  <br>  1. Admit your sin to God and ask for help & forgiveness. He is our creator after all...He knows our flaws & how to fix us.<br>  <br>  2. Avoid any condusive situation for your bad habit. For example: if you watch / read porn in your room, throw away your collection (the fastest way is by re-format your pc) and move the computer / TV to the living room, so you will get "help" from your family members.<br>  <br>  3. get out of bed anytime you feel the urge, and do something else to occupy your mind & body; like exercising, do some part time job, clean the room / house / car, join church activities, etc. once again, avoid the condusive situation.<br>  <br>  4. Ask your girlfriend to help you by not doing sexual activities until you are strong enough to control your mind & body. Better still, dont do that until you are married and ready to have children.<br>  <br>  Just because you can have erection everyday doesnt mean you have to do it everyday too. Control your body & mind...dont be the slave.<br>  You may not feel all of the bad effects yet as you are still 15.

There is no way to quit smoking in 2 days.  But you may be able to start weaning yourself off of the behavioral part of the smoking, and you can buy a little time in telling your parents.  You won't be confronting them with your smoking right off the bat.  Then you can gradually wean yourself off the patches.<br>  <br>  You should tell your parents your dilemma.  Maybe they can get you into therapy to help you with the underlying issues which drive you to continue to smoke.

Focusing on how to quit smoking ain't going to help. Do something else that makes you happy and keep on it. If need be, get help from a friend or family member. It is better for your family to know about this than to keep it from them. Sometimes you need help from other people.

It is also a lot cheaper than joining a gym or going to yoga or kickboxing or something<br>  It costs maybe $3 per entry to a public pool, while it costs $20 for ONE kickboxing or yoga lesson. You can go swimming 7 times for that, and that would be SOOOOOOOO much better for your body and for weightloss than one yoga or kickboxing lesson|`|SmF9yU2Eaa	i am a physical education major...i love your question. diet is also important to loose weight. u can eat what u desire but limit your portions. fresh fruit for a snack or desert would be very healthy. have a light lunch and try not to eat after 6:00pm. if you are going to "pig out" make it during breakfast, because you have the whole day to burn off the calories. exercise is also vital, however running is good but, just using weights or a treadmill is also good. doing simple light weight with a large number of reps should help you tone up. water and gatorade are also good to drink during or after a workout. CUT SODA OUT of your diet...that will do wonders if you do...u will feel and look so much healthier fast! good luck! i wish u a good strong healthy body, after all god only gave us one body so take care of it!|`|O4SgF5o2aa	running is good, but aerobic is the best exercise|`|lmHBKBxYaa	Free weights. <br>  Bench Press, Squat, Dead Lift.

Cross country skiing, for example, might burn more calories per minute.  <br>  <br>  You'll succeed with running but the key is consistency.  You need to build up so that you can maintain at least 10 or 12 miles per week if not more (20 per week would be better- 3 miles per day).   Compared to walking, you'll burn about twice as many net calories.|`|MQqnN9SLaa	i think that the most best exercise for loosing weight is just walking just walk a mile or 2 then back again running is better but if you feel uncomfortable or emmbarresed just walk

If you do eat, portion control, portion control, portion control. Our stomachs are only the size of our fists. Our stomachs are like an elastic... the more you put in them, the more they stretch. Sometimes if it has been too stretched out for too long, it will not go back. You are then stuck with a big, fat, flabby gut. Also, drinks can bloat you which might make it seem like you're making no progress. But you have to know that you ARE making progress. You will see it after the first few days of following this diet. Plus say if you wanna go to the beach in 2 days, for example, you can make plans to limit your fluid intake till then. This will help to further flatten your stomach. Carbonated drinks (like pop) are notorious b/c they give you gas and bloat you up. In general, stay away from foods that can give you gas.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	appetite control is easier said than done.

All you need is a barbell or 2 dumbbells. You could even use a broom if you don't have those things readily available. You simply stand up straight, hold the bar or dumbbells in your hands and twist from side to side (left to right). You can adjust the weight as necessary to suit your individual needs. Try doing 1 set of 50 repetitions - you'll really feel it in your abs the next day! You don't need a lot of weight to do these or you could injure your spine. <br>  <br>  * Upper Abs Exercise. -- Simply lie flat on the floor and place your legs up on a chair so that your legs are parallel (thighs perpendicular) to the floor. Keeping your legs raised this way assures that your upper abs are doing most of the work, and not your legs or back. Try to complete at least 3 sets of crunches with 12 repetitions each. <br>  <br>  * Lower Abs Exercise. -- Decline (or incline) reverse crunches rule the world! They are an awesome way to tone up your lower abs which is the hardest area of the tummy to tone. These are amazing. Simply do 3 sets of this exercise to failure. Meaning, do one set until you can't do anymore, rest for 60 seconds, do your next set until you can't do anymore...etc.<br>  <br>  * Eat right.<br>  <br>  <br>  Goodluck.

f9yORGumaa	Just talk to people (even complete strangers). Say "Hi, How are you?" to someone you don't know. Talk about the weather or just bring up something relevant just to start a conversation. You'd be surprised how many nice people there are out there. The more posititve interactions you have with people, the higher your self esteem gets. Some people live like hermits under a rock and wonder why nobody likes them. Just talk to people!!!!  <br>  <br>  I read a book for a class once, it was called "How Full is Your Bucket" it explained that negative interactions make you feel crummy, but every positive interaction will make you feel better about yourself. So, in theory, a negative remark from someone takes away from your "bucket" and a positive interaction helps to fill it.<br>  <br>  So stop being a boring empty bucket, and make some friends. lonliness never made anyone happy.<br>  <br>  Unless you are an introvert like myself. I prefer to be alone with my bf and son rather than out with my friends partying. In fact, I've had about 30 offers to go to the bars with my best girly friend in the past year or so, but decided to stay home each and every time to be with my family.<br>  <br>  I guess it depends on what you want. If you aren't really a "people person" than a different way to boost your self esteem would be to just make yourself look the best you can (for personal pleasure). Get a well needed haircut. If your a girl go get new makeup or get your nails done. If your a guy...I don't know any advice because I've never actually been a man with low self esteem.

Y4s4Om38aa	The behaviors and sympoms are very similar. How ever the main differnce is Bipolar is a mood disorder, and the sympoms arise from the mood epiodes. BPD is a personality disorder.....and the moods arise from their learned way of thinking.<br>  <br>  They can be missdiagnosed for eachother if not looked deeply into or by a dr that is bias towards diagnosing one or the other.....but they are distinct from eachother, and can coexist even.<br>  <br>  Pretty much as an example.....impulsiveness in both. In bipolar, it is typicly only in the manic episode, where the mood is so high, thoughts are racing, ton of energy, and perceptions are distorted by this so things seem great very quickly, and will for the duration of the manic episode. In borderline it is due to a more black and white thinking, where at one point something will seem like the best thing in the world, until either something happens that causes it to become horrable in their eyes, or until something else takes their interest in the same manner. <br>  <br>  And as far as moods, moods in bipolar IS the illness. Moods will change to being depressed or manic no matter what is going on i life. Could have everything going wrong and be manic and feel like everything is great, or could have everything great, and be depressed as can be. Could cry over nothing when depressed, or get angry quickly over something small when manic because that is how the brain is running. In borderline the mood problems are a result of the thought prossess. They have a very black and white thought prossess, so you could go from being their best friend in the world, and do something relatively small that they take as a insult, and suddenly you are the worst person in the world and hate them and so on. Because of this thought prossess, someone with BPD does get angry or upset very easily over little things, because they see things as very black and white, so its everything is great, or everything is horrable and falling apart.<br>  <br>  I guess simplest way to put it is bipolar, moods cause the distorted thought prossess and other symptoms and BPD distorted thought prossess causes any mood problems and other symptoms.|`|eu6UQElYaa	It has to do in part with the duration of the symptoms.  A person with Bi-polar Disorder typically has the same mood for weeks on end while a person with Borderline Personality disorder will experience intense bouts of anger, depression or anxiety that last a few hours or up to a day at most.   <br>  And the symptoms are very similar but there are some minor differences.  Such as reactive mood being associated with borderline personality disorder while "rejection hypersensitivity" is associated with bipolar disorder.   And transient paranoid ideation, abandonment fears, and chronic emptiness is associated more with borderline personality disorder than it is with bipolar disorder.|`|Ep7fwAtFaa	Borderline has some of the same bipolar but borderline is a learned behavior. people with borderline often harm themselves. They tend to be afraid of real or imagined abandonment . They have a hard time trusting. While Bi-Polar is a chemical disorder. They tend to have mood swings. People with bi-polar tend to have what they call manic stages which is really high moods to where they think they are on top of the world then they can get very low like depression. There are I think 2 kinds if not 3 kinds of bi-polar. But there is some of the same in each but borderline is learned behavior how you learned as a child, bi-polar is a chemical imbalance.|`|3ZgmcNK9aa	Bi-Polar disorder has a ot to do with mood swings. It could be an event that provokes a mood or merely how a person with Bi-Polar is "feeling" that day.  The mood could (whether manic or depressed) could go on for days, even months. Medication can help stabilize this kind of disorder.  Borderline Personality Disorder is usually provoked by a person or relationship.  The person feels utterly hopeless and helpless to the problem and usually says or does something very destructive to the relationship so it will end in order for them to avoid being abandoned.  The biggest difference is that Bi personality is aggravated by the threat of the loss of a relationship while Bi-Polar is more unpredictable. I hope i didnt just confuse you more.

AA12167923	A person cannot become "more stupid", unless you have had some kind of brain injury.  If you are a procrastinator and also lazy (actually procrastinators are also lazy), that would explain your present dilemma and getting over these negative traits are the hurdles you must face.  Being a procrastinator can have a crippling effect on your life and I would put every effort into stopping this behaviour.  Your brain needs exercise and you should begin by teaching yourself self-discipline.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Do you know the meaning of stupid?  It means a lack of intelligence - because you are not exercising your intelligence does not mean you become "more stupid" (personally, I say I am having a stupid attack! - a momentary lack of intelligence?), it means you are mentally lazy.

Or boredom if he was in a 5 inch x 5 inch cell all day... But no, you probably didn't kill him by overfeeding.|`|TKNPveHDaa	I don't believe gerbals can exist in nature.  They would be too easy for predators to hunt and consume.  They're strictly house pets.  <br>  <br>  They are also not very fat animals, but they have a lot of fur so they might look fat.  I doubt fatness is the reason your gerbal died.  You probably didn't do anything wrong.<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about him.
BnR4LLhxaa	To me, this means that you need to be able to count the number of grams of carbohydrates that you will eat at each meal, and inject an amount of insulin that will be able to handle that amount. <br>  <br>  This is often expressed as a ratio - such as 1 unit of insulin for each 5 grams of carbohydrates, or 1 for each 10 grams. You can end up injecting a different amount of insulin at each meal depending on what you will be eating.<br>  <br>  That requires two very important things, however:<br>  1) that you have been given proper education by a diabetes educator on how to read nutrition labels and properly estimate food quantities so that you can properly count the grams of carbs in each meal and snack.<br>  <br>  2) that you and your doctor, or a diabetes educator, have figured out what the proper insulin to carb ratio is for you. It will vary from person to person and you cannot generalize about what might work. Sometimes, the ratio will vary according to time of day: in the morning, perhaps the ratio is 1 to 3, for lunch and dinner, however, it might be 1 to 6. This really has to be worked out over time, by keeping very careful records of what you eat (and how many carbs are in each meal), how much insulin you inject, and what the blood sugar measurements are before, and two hours after, every meal. The doctor could suggest a ratio for you to try, but it is only by careful carb estimates and faithful recording of sugar levels that you will find out if those ratios work or need adjustment.<br>  <br>  The other factor involved is a correction factor. If you start a meal with you blood sugar at 100, then the proper insulin to carb ratio usually works out OK. However, sometimes the glucose level before a meal will be much higher (happens to almost everyone sometimes). In that case, you would add some additional units to the amount that you calculate form the ratio. It might be something like: 1 additional unit for each 30 points that the glucose is over 140 (using US units, don't know the mmol equivalent). So, if you measured 170, you would calculate the usual insulin dose from your standard insulin to carb ratio, then add 1 unit as a correction. <br>  <br>  If you started the meal at 200, then you would add 2 units... and so on.<br>  <br>  It takes some effort, but it is absolutely worth it to achieve good control and to manage the disease properly. With good management, you can live a good, long, healthy life.|`|tFAKwsv6aa	My doctor had me on a sliding scale before I was put on an insulin pump.  It means if your blood sugars fall between a certain number you take as prescribed dose of insulin. An example might be...<br>  200-239  4 units of insulin<br>  240-69  6 units|`|pRF5LLloaa	It means you change your dosage of Humulin-R, based on what and how much you intend to eat.<br>  <br>  This works in the hospital, with trained nurses, but for most diabetics it doesn't work.  You are a case in point -- you have no idea what these instructions mean!  Shame on your doctor for prescribing this, and then leaving you hanging without  further instruction!<br>  <br>  You are in a VERY dangerous situation right now.  it is CRITICAL that the diabetic maintain STRICT control of their blood sugar.  The insulin WILL do it, but it needs to be properly applied.<br>  <br>  If you do not get you blood sugars under strict and tight control, you are going to die early.  And before you die you are likely to suffer heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, blindness, and even amputations.<br>  <br>  You need to ask you doctor to refer you to an ENDOCRINOLOGIST, a specialist in disease like diabetes.  Most Endo's work with a "team" of nutritionists, teachers, and counselors who can instruct you in the RIGHT WAY to manage your disease.<br>  <br>  With properly controlled diabetes, your expect life span and quality of life is almost as good as a "normal" healthy person.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Your doctor will help you to determine the number of units to control how many grams of carbohydrate at any given meal or snack.<br>  <br>  You must learn to count the grams of carbohydrate and do it very accurately. Some people suggest we can discount the grams of carb from fiber, but I find I go high if I do that.<br>  <br>  My personal numbers are 1 to 15, but each of us is very individual in our needs. So If I were to inject 8 units I would be eating 120 grams of caarbohydrate for that meal. I attempt to keep my daily total of carbohydrate under that much so that would be like a whole cake for me plus my regular meal.
bjqjkDMHaa	diaphragm?  Yes.  You do need help..sorry for saying it again, but I feel obligated somewhere deep down to say it.  So I said it.  Yes, they will put you on meds, yes any sane doctor will send you to a shrink of some sort.  I'm sorry if I was preachy.  But you need to find somewhere else to cut.  Warning: diaphragm is what you breathe with.  If you mess up your diaphragm, it will mess up your breathing, which will mess up your ability to stay alive.  So cut shallow there...if you mess up your diaphragm, you'll need emergency medical attention, which will definitely land you in the psych ward for a couple of days.  So be careful not to impair your ability to breathe.  Okay?  I know saying "stop cutting" won't do any good.  I bite myself lately if that is any solace to know there are other people out there who have similar problems.  Meds will help.  Therapy will help.

Sleeping more hours makes you less tired - This is one of the biggest mistakes people make. It's simply not true that the more you sleep the less tired you'll feel.

bnJPvsVWaa	It depends on what you're using it for, but generally speaking, if you can do more than 12-15 reps with it, it's probably too light.   You want a weight, where the tenth rep gives you a solid burn, but you can continue un-spotted and still have good form.  The 12th rep should be very difficult, and much slower than 10, but still do-able without a spot.  The 15th rep should probably require just a little tap from the other arm to keep it moving.  <br>  <br>  If you're outside that, in either direction, you might think about changing weight.<br>  <br>  With your 12 lb, before you buy anything, try doing a set of 15 in super-strict form, and very slow.  Do your best to make a full rep take 5 full seconds  up and 5 full seconds down.  Take note of  how you feel at 10, 12, and 15 if you get to it.  That should give you an idea of whether your weight is right.<br>  <br>  ** edit **<br>  <br>  Chase, if my assumption is correct that this question pertains to bicep curls, I strongly suspect that you're using your core muscles to hawse that 45 lbs into position.  Try keeping every single body part absolutely still, and moving only the forearm.  See if you're still using 45s.|`|xb3RjkV2aa	Well it's a fact that if you keep using the 12 LB ones, you will see the same performance as using heavier ones.

M1PYqC3qaa	Okay - so you can change your diet. Its really important that you do not starve yourself - because a) it will not aid your weight loss, and will slow down your metabolism considerably, and b) You have finals, and I know just as well as you do that you can't concentrate on studying or in the exam itself when you are really hungry. Just take all the junk food out of your diet and replace it will fruit, low fat yoghurt, lean protein such as chicken, and switch your carbs like rice and white bread all to brown which should help you feel fuller for longer and contain more nutrients. You should aim for an intake of around 1500 calories a day to keep your body going. If you don't have the time to workout so much at the moment, then, as you said, do some pilates every now and again and when the finals are over, then you can start doing some swimming and light jogging. Walk to school/exams whenever you can. Walk everywhere! Also, you could try doing a bit of yoga during study breaks. This is not only good for your body, but will calm your mind. Also drink lots of water.<br>   I think you should aim to lose 10-14lbs. You will probably lose 1-2lbs per week, so it will take you around 2months tops to get beach body perfect. If you want results much sooner, cut your intake down to about 1200 calories and get more active. <br>   Good luck!!|`|DyORD0Zkaa	go to GNC and get hydroxycut and then do exercise on the part that you want to get slimer and then you will get it thinner quick in under 30 days guaranteed|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Sandra <br>  <br>  What's up you have posted the same question again|`|mA3ZAKVfaa	Take the advice of a grown up that you picture of yourself is fine, there is nothing wrong with your body, to me, your is perfect shape, your either paranoid or someone told you you loof different. those who told you a different story about your loos , were your peers, I am assuming this! but overall, your body will look great in your old or new swimsuit and you should forget about the diet from others, as they are trying to take advantage to sell their products so they become richer while you remain poorer and their product DOES NOT work.It is only a selling gimbit.|`|xaRyvznHaa	I don't think losing weight will help your thighs and knees, because you don't really have any weight to lose.

It was finally figured out that she was allergic to all of the anti-bacterial hand soaps (or washes).  That was when all of those soaps had first come out and they were pushed on us!  She stopped using them and it completely went away.  To this day she still checks all products to make sure it is not anti-bacterial.

wwP3ONCFaa	the only way for you to get up early in the morning without getting those lazy-butt attitude is to go to sleep early.<br>  <br>   You should set up your own sleep schedule seven days a week. Sleep is an unavoidable interval in the 24-hour day. I insist you to try to be as regular with your habits as possible. The key is to get enough sleep so you can make it through your day with drowsiness. To help achieve that goal, try to get to be at the same time each night so you can set your system's circadian rhythm, the so-called body clock that regulates most internal functions. Just as  important is arising at the same time each morning. <br>  <br>  Set a sleeping time of, say, 1:00 to 6:00 am. If youre sleeping soundly through that 5 hour period, add 15 minutes each week until you get aroused in the middle of the night. Work on getting through the arousal before adding another 15 minutes. You'll know when you reach the point where you've had enough sleep-you'll wake up refreshed, energetic, and ready to take on the day.<br>  <br>  If you wake up during the night and cant get back to sleep in 15 minutes, don't fight it. Stay in bed and listen to the radio until you're drowsy again.<br>  <br>  Again, be sure to wake up at the appointed hour in the morning; don't sleep in trying to pick up on "lost" sheep. That goes for the weekends as well. Don't sleep late on Saturday and Sunday mornings. If you do, you may have trouble falling asleep Sunday night, which can leave you feeling wished out on Monday morning<br>  <br>  Follow those tips and your all good|`|AA10330431	Go to bed a full eight hours before the time you want to wake up, and the last thing on your mind should be the time that you want to wake up.

AA12123587	There are two different types of male breast development. One is called Pseudogynecomastia<br>  and the other is called Gynecomastia. <br>  <br>  The first, Pseudogynecomastia, is due to fat accumulation in the chest area. This type of breast enlargement responds very well to dieting and exercising. The problem is that if you gained excessive weight and then lost it, you may find yourself with a droopy flap of skin (chest ptosis).<br>  <br>  The other type of breasts development, Gynecomastia, is actual breasts tissue and gland formation. In other words, real breasts development similarly to that in women. Milk production may or may not be present, but usually there’s none. <br>  <br>  It may be caused by hormonal imbalance, medication with estrogens or steroidal compounds, failure of the liver to inactivate circulating estrogen (as in alcoholic cirrhosis), marijuana use, hyperthyroidism, decreased testosterone production, chronic kidney disease, Klinefelter's syndrome, testicular tumors, pituitary gland tumors, and obesity which tends to increase estrogen level in the body.<br>  <br>  True Gynecomastia can NOT be treated with exercise and dieting. In fact, doing push ups or other exercises that develop the pectoral muscles underneath the breast tissue can make things worst. This is because the developed muscles will push the breasts tissue outward making them look bigger than they really are. <br>  <br>  If the problem is new, it may be treated with Selective estrogen receptor modulator medications such as Letrozole. This is a pretty effective treatment during the first 2 to 3 years of breasts development. After that period of time, the breast tissue tends to remain and harden due to maturation, leaving surgery the only treatment option. Simply put, the sooner you get treated, the better the results.<br>  <br>  Surgery is an option for some people but not for all. Mainly due to cost. Plastic surgery is very expensive and not everyone can affort it. There is a couple of other options. You could wear a compression garment which hides the condition, or just learn to live with it. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you don’t try to diagnose yourself, but rather seek the help of a doctor. Because as I mentioned before, Gynecomastia can be caused by some serious medical conditions. I doctor can rule any of these conditions out. Good luck!|`|gq93af81aa	I really don't want to click on that link at work, so I can't say for sure.

Don't worry about the actual intercourse part, just pleasure each other. If you are having pain, then you probably aren't relaxed enough, and need more foreplay. It's much easier for men than women. Has he ever brought you to orgasm before? If not, then that should be the first step, but through stimulation not sex - much easier.

Gosh, she didn't even  have to list her age to ask the question! My sister started having sex at 15/16, she was mature enough. AGE DOESN'T MATTER. They're 40 years olds who aren't mature enough to have sex!<br>  <br>  Anyway, back to your question. There are three things that help me: lube, going in slowly (and relaxed, no rush), and frequency. The more often something is stretching you out, the more ready you will be. That's why it gets easier as you get older and do it more. That's probably unfortunate news for someone in high school, where it's hard to get alone. Lube will be near the condoms in the store, which you are using, yes? If not, I take back the mature part above. :-P

AA11897918	Erika, Derfz has said it all.  <br>  <br>  But you may not need a specialist unless there is infection.<br>  <br>  Most NURSES in the emergency room are well trained in "oral irrigation" with warm water and a syringe that wax can be removed quite painlessly. (I have had it done 10 times over the years).<br>  <br>  After you are back to normal you should buy a rubber ear syringe and then when an obstruction occurs you can do your own "ear maintenance"..  Just pour an ounce or two rubbing alcohol in a glass and then some hot water to make a mix. (the mix should not be be hot but just warm)<br>  <br>  'Then using that syringe squeeze that mixture into the ear a couple of time. That's it. The alcohol will dissolve the wax and also dry out the ear as well.  ( of course it is best if you have put a few drops of Murine ear oil in a few hours before doing the irrigation ) <br>  <br>  Of course if the build up is too extensive you will once again have to visit the ER.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps/|`|041b0462d79f0e5c2d4dc32dfd70d958aa	Go see the Ear eyes nose and throat doctor.|`|A5W8LQzVaa	I suffered from that few days ago.

0e8mlXveaa	Cystitis can be bacterial or non bacterial so is usually caused by  bacteria travelling into the vagina or by sex. It is possible to get it from any means of introduction of bacteria so oral sex is a possibility although if you then went on to have full sex after it is most likely that is the cause. Drink a glass of water every 20 mins and drink cranberry juice to help shift it and if it is bad go to the doctors. Get into good hygiene practices to keep clean and always wipe the area front to back after going to the toilet to minimise the risk of infection. Empty your bladder after sex too, this will flush away any bacteria that is trying to get in. Hope that helps.

Inversion therapy sounds like it could be perfect for you.  Inversion therapy is when you hang upside down with gravity boots or on an inversion table and the weight of your body pulls your spine or elongates it so that your spine can straighten out and go back into alignment and straighten up.  This will also fix your posture problem.  Once you begin to invert your spine will get used to being straight and will stay that way after a while.  If you invert you can also do mini crunches to strengthen your spine and to build the muscles in your back.  Inversion therapy is the best thing for you sweetie.  Give it a try, you won't be sorry.

F2rI3Juaaa	My 7 year old fell off our trampoline. She said her arm hurt but not too much! I finally took her to the hospital and I couldn't believe it when they said it was broken. Casts have come a long way and my daughter was able to choose from 4 colors and was able to swim and shower in it. Wasn't half as traumatic as I thought it would be. I would get her arm checked out - The staff know how to calm a child. Good Luck!|`|MpVQE8tnaa	or of it is broken and you do nothing about it--the bone will die (necrosis) and never heal....you are her parent until she's 18--despite her protests--get het to the hospital ASAP<br>  <br>  Tough if she doen't want it  she may need a cast anyway--especially if it's broken<br>  <br>  Don't give her a choice--she's only 8--do what YOU know is right  Don't let her manipulate you.

All sorts of complications can arise if bones are broken and not dealt with immediately.  Even if she hasn't broken her arm she could have sprained something - her bones are still developing so it is best to get it checked immediately before she ends up with a deformed arm.  It's possible that the 'I dont want a cast' is because she is afraid of the hospital. However you are responsible for her health and if you let it go without being checked earlier and something else developes you could have the police knocking on your door - as hospitals are quite hot on this sort of thing nowadays.  The longer you leave it the more suspicious it may look.  Doctors are able to tell just how long an injury has been left unattended.  Hopefully it is a minor injury and not a break,  good luck.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	We have these places in America for people who are injured.  They are called hospitals.  Maybe there is one near you.

If you have a keyboard or piano in your house, you could try and play some scales or just run your fingers up and down the notes to give yourself a "finger workout".|`|8QrfXxaXaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It is difficult to lose weight around the fingers because the structure of the hand is genetically determined.<br>  However sometimes fingers look puffy due to water retention, you can try restricting your salt intake to make fingers look slimmer. Also losing weight in general will make the fingers look thinner.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|wSKLLtryaa	the only thing you can do is lose weight. i dont even think there is a plastic surgery for that.  maybe you're bloated? eat less salt.|`|RYZ8CVZTaa	there's really nothing to do about that,sorry <br>  u should just keep it like that.|`|NPMKqJlMaa	genetics!<br>  u cant do anything.|`|DyORD0Zkaa	you have to make sure to lose weight but fat not muscle weight then your whole body will get slimer including your finger|`|xaRyvznHaa	lose weight. im not sure if there is another way.

They have no ovaries, womb etc etc, therefore no periods.|`|VV2BZvlLaa	that's a stupid question. the answer is NO!<br>  <br>  because they re not really women they don't have a uterus or ovaries.<br>  <br>  they're a man inside.
sVrkjixAaa	I live in California, and it hasn't been decriminalized. Possession is still a crime, and you can go to jail for it. Medical use is allowed because we are generally more liberal than other states, and we approve of it's medicinal value. The way to get them is simply to vote on the propositions supporting legalization.|`|V5TC4x6jaa	I dont know but we should move there.|`|kfy8RnI1aa	I don't know what your on about
tVVLtMHGaa	The first week is the worst. They will probably hurt and rub ur mouth. Be sure you get a ton of wax! But after that its not too bad. When they get tightened they might hurt a little for a day of 2. Good luck! Ur teeth will look great!|`|xs9L4eGpaa	nope they just feel very different and big even though there not.. it took me about 2 weeks to get used to them and after about 4 weeks you dont even know there on you get used to them.<br>  <br>  when u first get them on they hurt tho as they are tight but after a few days its fine.<br>  <br>  you cant feel nothing when they get put on they just use a lazor or some kind of light to fix the little metal things on the teeth its fine takes about  5 minutes and your out|`|7wSOv17Gaa	I have braces and mine are coming off in 33 dayys :)<br>  <br>  First of all, they do not hurt whilst being put on,<br>  They use a numbing gel on your teeth and gums so no needles aree involved. <br>  <br>  They will hurt after so I suggest that you take an aspirin straight away, before the pain starts to avoid the worst of it, it does'nt hurt that bad, it depends how high your pain threshold is, it's like a long, dull throb like a broken bone, this is because the brace is moving and twisting both your teeth and jaw bones. <br>  <br>  Also ,, enjoy the time and freedom you have left now ! :) Braces can be a pain . You can also, choose colours for your braces so have fun with that .. :) best of luck! You'll have a fabulous smile at the end of it ! :D<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps  :)x
mnvHvDuKaa	If you walk in, someone random may be able to speak with you, but you will probably have to wait on them. I think your best bet would be to call and see when would be a good time for them. After all, doctors are normally really busy. Good Luck!
l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  You must cross train. Do Aerobics and weights on alternate days.<br>  Have a complex carb snack half an hour before workout. As this will maintain your energy level. Aerobics will build up your endurance.<br>  And there is no problem with your heart rate. that is about 80% of your Max Heart rate
iK3YYRaTaa	WOW! Perfecto! Very normal. Keep up the good work Low carbs and exercise. <br>  <br>  Envy! Envy! Yeah for you!|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Yes. Normal fasting (before breakfast) blood sugar is between 70 and 99 mg/L.|`|6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	That is a wonderful number to have in the morning before you eat.<br>  <br>  The person who said between 80 and 120 is partially right.  Fasting numbers (first thing in the morning before you've eaten) should be under 100.  Between 100 - 125 is considered prediabetes, and 126 and up is diabetes.<br>  <br>  87 is a perfect fasting number.  At this point you are nowhere near developing diabetes.|`|daf31a0f11d6dd2ff61a771f182635ddaa	Anything between 80 and 120 is considered to be normal.|`|9aAO1J73aa	yes thats normal|`|FncktQ4gaa	I believe so you can go  to diabetes.com and find more Information|`|rVvtoljyaa	Great - exactly where it should be!|`|qmk2mIKpaa	yeah thats an amazing number i wish that was my numberrrr
VWvI5RyBaa	I know everybody is different but I have those systems when I have sinusitis(sinus problems).  It can be an infection of all the air ways which would cause the sore throat.  Sinus automatically, when infected, cause pressure in your head and it's very painful.  Did you take your temperature?  Because once I had pain everywhere, in all my bones.  I went to the hospital and the nurse told me I had a temperature of over 103°F(39.4°C) and that for an adult it feels worst than for a child.  She told me that if she would have had my fever, she would have had pain also.  Sometimes you can have sinus problems without the infection.  I'm not a specialist but I truly believe that you have an infection and you need antibiotics to cure it.  No, I'm not a believer in antibiotics when taken too often but they're there for that reason.  Whether it's a sinus problem or not, please see a doctor.  You could suffer for weeks and it could be something else.  I wouldn't wait if I were you.|`|A5W8LQzVaa	Most of the symptomps you've mentioned are caused by Tonsilopharyngitis except for the earache. Tonsilopharyngitis is treated using ani-biotics. But we have may types of anti-biotics so, better consult your doctor for best medecine to use. Your earache is possibly due to the severe headache you are suffering. Rush up to your doctor before you regret.|`|6d7m0kWWaa	The joint pain is probably caused by a fever, you might have strep.  Go to a doctor, if it's strep some antibiotics should clear it up quickly.|`|lT6WBaWIaa	youre probably getting old.|`|NwiJ1MBUaa	Strep throat.

You just need antibiotics to cure your bronchitis.  But did you know that if you cough phlegm out it'll just make your body produce more phlegm.  The mucus is a protection against germs.  Hope that helps.|`|KkDTGuAXaa	No, ht emucus is what is making you cough and the bronchitis is what is making the mucus build up. You should take anti-biotics before it hits pnemonia stage.|`|K1rUaOqWaa	cough and spit em out.

efa3a4f2facfb1fd057a71ddccbe4c1daa	flossing is a must, brush cannot enter in between the teeth & that's where food gets collated causing in between caries which is very common. Your grand mother used to eat a lot of fiber foods earlier, so that's why she is still having good teeth.|`|O0VQqIkDaa	food will get stuck between your teeth and will cause cavities.|`|UTA4G5rTaa	The real problem is microscopic bacteria! Even though your grandma has never had problems, you may have! Bottom line, bacteria gets in between your teeth excretes an acid, ruins your enamel and causes a cavity. Worst part is that some of these cavities can not be seen, only on an X-ray!<br>  Flossing removes the plaque that contains a lot of the bacteria, it also makes the fluoride in your toothpaste able to get in between your teeth, because the fluoride, can not penetrate the plaque! Fluoride helps rebuild your teeth. This is why they say to floss before you brush your teeth.<br>  I am one of the unlucky ones!!

FfxmE9Toaa	See a podiatrist pronto. I walked around on a broken foot for 20 years, thinking it was just mild pain. I'm lucky. The surgery worked and the incision is so tiny it will be gone in a year.|`|kmIcAySEaa	See your MD or better yet a podiatrist. Need some history about foot, injuries, etc. How old are you ? It could be edema, or early stages of gout. Maybe even a blood clot, if you feel it needs attention see a Dr. It could be even a bone or tendon or ligament. Humans have approximatly 206 bones in the body, most of them are in the feet and hands.

Pain somewhere else I'm not so sure unless he rubbed you raw? If you are really concerned and the pain doesn't go away go see the Dr. Planned Parenthood provides a Womens Health Program through medicaid. Call them first because not all the PP. accept this insurance but if they do, they will provide the paper work for you to fill out. It's quick and easy and your visits will be free.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	You will just have to wait it out.  Sorry.  If you don't want so much pain next time, tell him to go more gently.

You need to try and relax. Sit in a bowl with warm water of fill the bath, sit sideways with your legs dangling over the side and lean with your back to the other side. If you have any fresh rosemary in the house sprinkle that in the water or some Radox salt.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, drink some warm milk with a spoonful of honey. It is imperative that you relax. You are making yourself feel worse, due to psychological fear.|`|1QvCwWMgaa	lol<br>  <br>  tell your bf to swear less during sex.

Don't worry about it, I'm 99.99999% sure she's not pregnant, especially not from a tiny semen specimen which the cell was almost 100% likely dead... <br>  The fact is she had one day of her period, which means the egg HAS been released...<br>  Dude, chill and next time pay attention in Biology ;)<br>  Sorry if this doesn't help much I've not done biology since GCSE...<br>  Best way to test is of course get a pregnancy test kit though just to make sure, but from what you've said, I stand by my answer.<br>  Let us know what happens.|`|WAEDIWz8aa	hmmmm yeah anything can happen.<br>  <br>  if she doesnt get her period tell her to check.<br>  <br>  but i think it will be fine...|`|fVMzCP5raa	It will be fine there is a very low chance of this happening so dont worry her periods will happen soon.|`|4IC78le4aa	Go to the drugstore and get a pregnancy test kit. It costs about $12 and it is a stick which she urinates on mid stream (this means she has to pee, stop herself and put the stick under the flow when she starts to pee again). It will show up with an indicator if she is pregnant. You dont need to take her to the doctor and she can do it in a few minutes and relieve any worry for you both. Good luck.|`|p93GnJzbaa	it might be a short period or it might have been spotting which is an early sign of pregnancy. but i wouldn't be too worried, have her take a pregnancy test in a couple weeks just to be sure.|`|mfZvg4rGaa	By 'it' do you mean your penis?<br>  Well have her take a pregnancy test, better safe than sorry.<br>  Who knows maybe it's just stress.|`|XzBlDliBaa	Mate, ccchhhiiiilllllll if she was pregnant she wouldn't be having periods at all!!!!! she would of missed that period wouldn't she? But if your still not satisfied you should take a pregnancy test. <br>  But I still think its unlucky she is pregnant if she is on her peroid.<br>  Plus, irregular periods are normal, it isnt always from sex, it can be from irregular eating for example. <br>  But bless you for worrying. <br>  x

Maybe you'll have a growth spurt soon?|`|W0AK2Lumaa	The right bra,<br>  Massaging them (My doctor said)...<br>  Your diet and YEs Hormonal balance...|`|AA11678263	Your mum's breast size is not necessarily an indicator of your own genetics.  You have genes from you father's side of the family, and your mother's.  Your mum is essentially only one bra size bigger than you in the cup, and one back size bigger.  You being slimmer will contribute to this, plus your mother has had at least one child, and breasts may grow in pregnancy and breastfeeding, and do not always return to their previous size.  Although B is not huge, it is probably perfectly fine for your build.<br>  <br>  Also, girls grow until they are 21, and breast size fluctuates throughout life depending on hormones and weight, so you're not necessarilt done yet.  Be happy with who you are.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The release of certain hormones, e.g. during pregnancy, would lead to an increase in breast size.  You are unlikely to have a hormone imbalance that would prevent your breasts from growing.  This would more likely result in the developmentof more masculine features.  If you are still concerned, go to the Dr, but I think you're worrying unnecessarily - I am now a 34C and was flat as a board until I was 17.|`|T4JBT3k6aa	I was a 34b when I was your age and gradually grew to a c in my 20's, now I'm a 34d, same weight as when I was a b cup. <br>  Essentially you're almost fully grown in terms of bone structure, but breasts are affected by hormones and still able to change size and shape.<br>  Even if they don't grow, at least they're less likely to sag and be at knee level by the time you're 40. :)|`|nKosOzuVaa	Boobs aren't everything ;) they get in the way, sag, and make you wonder if a guy has heard a single word that came out of your mouth or if he's just staring at your boobs.<br>  <br>  Some birth control pills increase your cup size, but might increase the size of everything else & make you feel crazy, too.<br>  <br>  You may still grow more, so don't think about a boob job anytime soon (ever) and keep in mind you have to replace them every so often, not to mention fake boobs can look really fake and folks will unfairly judge you based on them (they might do that with real ones, too).|`|H93JbQS0aa	I too am 32C but dont want them to grow, its not nice, this size is best becuase u dont want to over do it!! lol<br>  <br>   Just keep healthy u dont need sexy hahaha|`|kiySV84Saa	your still a growing kid!! give it time... don't be in such a hurry to grow up...

As far as pain, take some tylenol, eat soup, pudding, applesauce etc.  The talking thing I thought was the worst, especially since I had speech class when I got mine.  Just practice a lot speaking outloud.  I would read a book or the newspaper outloud to myself.  It gets easier once your mouth gets used to it.

FWMnop6oaa	I have the same problem, I take a daily supplement of glucosamine and cod liver oil (in one capsule) .  Like the other answer said your joints are not well lubricated- this leads to arthritis.

Ideally you should carry on taking them once you stop hearing cracks/scrapes btw.|`|hRNpGnktaa	Seems to me that your natural bone lubricant has been dried. I urge you to go see a doctor soon as it can escalate, and lead to malfunctions like arthiritis, and it sounds to me like you may be developing the early signs. they should be able to help by catching it in this early stage, and put you on drugs to aid the regeneration of the fluid in your joints

44b90c053b01c2794d2454eb16fcbea1aa	I would really keep a close eye on her when it comes to her eating. You're not there to see whether she's eating the lunch at school, and she does not seem to be eating enough. The fact she feels hungry is a HUGE sign that she is not getting enough food. And I don't like the fact that at 14, she's concerned about her thighs. She gets plenty of exercise, and should not be worried about her weight at so young an age. She needs to understand that her body is till growing, and undergoing changes. She needs more nutrients so she grows up to be a healthy adult.<br>  <br>  AS for snacks, they are great for everyone when they are hungry. Convince your daughter that snacking between meals when she's hungry actually INCREASES her metabolism. Give her a granola or protein bar, light popcorn, fruit, nuts or trail mix, lowfat string cheese and yogurts.

If this is a possibility they may be able to do tests to confirm or reject that. Misdiagnosis is common in adults where, because of their age, they are assumed to be T2.<br>  <br>  Most important is to talk to the endo about what is happening, what bg levels you should expect, what levels are too high, and get answers that satisfy you on how you can tackle that.|`|NigoVXX1aa	I am a diabetic,my sugar level count was 450.The doctor gave me the following medication.<br>  Every morning before breakfast half a tablet of Amaryl 2.<br>  After meals Morn/Noon/Dinner 1 tablet of metformin 850 3 times a day.<br>  One of my friend a doctor also,told me to burn my fat by walking 5 kms a day.But the best result was from an old lady who told me to take betel nut,crush about 5 nuts and boil in water of 5 litres and boil till the water remains 4 litres and the color will change to pink,cool it and drink it instead of water.In 1 week sugar level came down to 250.Today I still take my medication but I have made herbal medicine myself and trying it on myself first.My dead feet is alive again and I am gaining weight.It's pure herbal no side affect.My doctor is shocked.I have been giving the medicine to old people and they are feeling better.God has given us medicine in forms of plants for every illness but we are not aware about it.Nature is great.I can help an AIDS patience also.There is cure for Cancer also.See if you can get a hold of natures cure book.But do not stop your medication till you start feeling better.God bless you.

You need to grow up and go to the gym. <br>  <br>  I don't know what you've looked up that hasn't helped. If you're REALLY desperate to lose weight, cut the bullsh*t and just do it:<br>  <br>  DIET<br>  Eat 5-6 small meals per day comprised of lean protein and natural carbs. CUT OUT THE JUNK. Think of food as a fuel, not a punishment, not a reward. Cram nutrients into your meals. Don't just have a salad made of lettuce and cucumber, throw all kinds of veggies and proteins into it. I'll even put potatoes, chili, squash, or even noodles and rice in my salads. No reason not to, you know? Don't get the stupid "diet" foods, don't get the frozen meals, don't get the shakes. Just freakin' eat real, natural food.<br>  <br>  EXERCISE<br>  4-6 days a week, do strength training. <br>  4-6 days a week, do cardio. <br>  If you do them back to back, always do strength training before cardio.<br>  Always increase the intensity and/or duration every time you workout. Don't just do the same routine over and over and wonder why you won't lose weight. <br>  <br>  <br>  Get out there and make it happen. It took me about 10 months to lose about 100lbs this way.

Some foods will cause your liver to become sluggish and when that happens it will not burn fat efficiently no matter what you do. This is why so many people become exasperated with diets. No product from a pharmacy will do it for you either. A total rethink about how you eat is necessary if you are serious.<br>  <br>  A great liver cleansing diet I use is as follows. For 8 weeks eliminate red meat, animal fats, dairy, and any processed foods. Replace this with mainly seafood (but not fried), some chicken (no skin either), lots of vegetables, salad and fruit (raw is better) and wholemeal bread, pasta and rice. Drink lots of water during the day. Limit your daily calories to 1200-1400. If you do this without cheating the weight will come off. You will lose around 1 - 2 kg per week.<br>  <br>  Read the articles I have attached as these will explain to you in more detail and they include an example diet plan.<br>  <br>  This works for everybody who does it without cheating.

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

THEY DO NOT WORK ! But anyways its best to replace sugary drinks with water. In order to curb hunger as well you can snack on fruits and nuts like trail mix. <br>  <br>  Alongside of all that you have to also concentrate on exercise. As you begin you have to learn to start out slowly and as you begin to shed the pounds, its best to kick up the intensity.  To tone your thighs and legs go out for at least half hour to an hour runs. You can also do something fun to not make everything feel like its boring such as belly dancing or just dancing in general. Because I belly dance to stay in shape :))  <br>  <br>  And lower your calorie in take and watch your carb in take as well. The less carbs and calories you take and the more water you take in, the easier it is to burn fat because water weight is well just water weight LOL so what you try to burn come out as sweat. To clean out "your system" keep lime in your house and in the morning squeeze a half lime into some warm water to get rid of the muck. Thats all I can type for now.

Alternating workouts forces your body to burn calories faster. LOW INTENSITY EXERCISE....Your heart rate should not go above 70% of your maximum heart rate so that you will burn mostly fats instead of sugars.<br>  <br>  Do not increase distance/intensity/duration in any combination by more than 5-10% per week. You get stronger when your body is recovering so you should rest 1-2 days a week. Injury will be minimal and swimming helps sore muscles to recover faster. Reduce your caloric intake and more fruits and vegetables--junk food is a no-no, back off of red meat and say hello to chicken breast and fish (not fried). Easy cycling will burn the fat in the legs and calves. Swimming will burn fat and tone muscle. <br>  <br>  Look up the term glycemic index and try to eat foods that are high in complex carbs and complex sugars that are low on this index... e.g. instead of white potatoes eat sweet potatoes, whole grain bread instead of white bread. I've left out running because it is likely that you will become injured if you try to do too much too fast. <br>  <br>  MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL: Make a schedule and stick to it. e.g. Monday Swim, Tues. Bike, Wed. Swim, Thurs. Bike, Fri. Swim/Bike, Sat. Show off 6-pack abs at pool. Sunday Show off 6-pack abs at pool.<br>  <br>  Save your money and avoid supplements except for multivitamins. Your cost effective recovery drink is chocolate milk. (Milk is where whey protein supplements come from anyway).  <br>  <br>  It also helps motivate you if you sign up for a race or some kind of sports event. See you at the finish line.<br>  <br>  P.S.

With the anti biotics it doesn't take too long for the pain to go away.

fTztIC22aa	No sir. You're completely looking at this the wrong way. Special K and Slimfast use the whole "lose weight fast" commercials and advertising to get you to buy their products. If you really want to lose weight you should take a look into a diet with 5-6 small healthy meals with a variety of nutrients, a good cardio regimen, and a nice anaerobic routine.<br>  <br>  To get this setup I highly recommend the site: www.cagedanimal.net and everybody there will offer their knowledge.|`|RJdWIHR7aa	You are overweight but not by much and you can go on a water fast for a week or so and that will help you lose LOADS of weight but you might put it all back on so read about it on google before you start :)|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~
j0xfBk5Caa	The problem with both bulimia and anorexia is that your body gets very used to not being fed properly. It starts to hoard any food you take in in an attempt to store it for when you aren't eating or are purging. Your body knows it need the nutrition and it is acutely aware of when you are not providing it. With bulimia your body becomes a pro at sucking out what it needs the second it hits your stomach, this is why many bulimics don't loose weight or stop loosing weight, sometimes even gaining,  after time. <br>  <br>  One huge problem with eating disorders is the addictive nature behind them and the mental illusions we encounter. It is highly possible that a good portion of what you are experiencing is in your head. You may be bloated but it often seems far more severe to us than it really is. Eating disorders also change how your body accepts and processes food. Your metabolism changes and your body goes into survival mode, this can bring on discomfort after meals and seemingly excessive weight gain when we first try to change our eating habits. Keep in mind that these things are temporary and as your body readjusts to normal eating and nutrition levels it will stop trying to hoard the nutrients it does receive. When I first started eating again I became violently ill with every meal, hunger pains made me feel nauseous and I put on a great deal of weight very fast. After a few months of normal and healthy eating habits my weight plateaued and my nausea, bloating and feelings of illness after meals stopped. <br>  <br>  Nobody can overcome an ED without support and assistance. You need to change almost every aspect of your life since so much socializing and day to day activities involve food. I would highly suggest a good support group, such as a chapter of Anorexics and Bulimics Anonymous, and intense therapy with someone who is trained in dealing with eating disorders coupled with the help of a nutritionist to help you with meal planning and healthy eating practises. <br>  <br>  You can overcome this with time and patience but trying to go it alone is hell. Contact NEDA, the National Eating Disorders Association, they have tons of resources at their fingertips and can assist you in finding a support circle and therapy in your area.<br>  <a href="http://nationaleatingdisorders.org/" rel="nofollow">http://nationaleatingdisorders.org/</a><br>  <br>  Also check if there is an ABA, anorexics and bulimics anonymous, in your area. If not try to get a copy of the ABA Recovery Textbook. It is formatted in the same way as The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous but with assistance geared toward eating disorders. It was written by a Dr who is also an ED survivor. The ABA was founded where I live and the meetings have quite literally saved my life and sanity. It is nice to connect with others who are also learning how to cope with and heal from their own disordered eating habits. <br>  <a href="http://www.anorexicsandbulimicsanonymousaba.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anorexicsandbulimicsanonymous...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.something-fishy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.something-fishy.org/</a> is a pro-recovery website covering everything from symptoms of eating disorders to finding a therapist to online support groups. This website has been pivotal in my own recovery and the members are amazing people committed to their own recovery and helping others through their recovery journey. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck, bulimia is hard to conquer but once you do the feeling is amazing.

baWh7kYoaa	First off - 6 times per week is way too much for drug free lifting.<br>  <br>  Second - Change the workout when you no longer are making gains.  However if you are properly regulating your workouts then you may not have to change your routine for months.  <br>  <br>  To build muscle you can lift as little as three times a week, given that you are working out hard and intelligently.  And these are not marathon lifting sessions - I am lifting three times per week for an hour each time which includes weights and 20-30 minutes of cardio afterwards - and my strength & size levels have never been better.<br>  <br>  The only 'change' is that every fourth week I scale back the intensity to about 50-60% of my peak lifts to allow my body to catch up with the induced stress.<br>  <br>  Google: Elite Fitness Jim Wendler 5/3/1 <br>  This is probably the most simple, intelligent strength program out there today bar none.|`|tKNYGM5Aaa	<a href="http://healths-school.synthasite.com/?q=change%20workout%20routine" rel="nofollow">http://healths-school.synthasite.com/?q=...</a>

QsrX5CY3aa	You have a form of sciatica.  You probably hurt your back or tweaked it at one time and now it's causing you problems.  What happens is that the muscles in your core (hips, thighs, buttocks, lower back) spasm and get knotted.  When this happens they pull your pelvis and spine out of alignment.  What I did to stop my problems is to start doing inversion therapy or hang upside down with gravity boots.  As you invert the muscles of your abs are stretched and the knots are broken up.  As this happens they release their grip on the muscles in your hips and thighs.  As they loosen they will release their grip on the muscles in your lower back.  As this happens they in turn release their grip on your pelvis and lower spine and allow it to go back into alignment naturally with gravity.  When your spine and pelvis are out of alignment it effects the sciatic nerve and that's what's causing your pain.  I guarantee if you try inversion therapy within a week or so your pain will be gone.  Here's a good site to read about what I'm talking about.  Hope this helps.

zwJbUbWMaa	Online counseling is becoming more and more popular.  You definitely need to make sure that the therapist you use is actually board certified and qualified to give online counseling.  You also need to make sure that they have taken the proper precautions to assure confidentiality.  This form of therapy still hasn't had a lot of research but I know one thing that is lacking is that a lot of the emotion and communication can be misinterpreted.  Without being able to see each other's facial expressions and gestures it is easy to misinterpret what the other person is actually trying to tell you.  It might be a good idea to find a local counselor who can still meet with you periodically face to face but still conduct most of the communication online or through emails.|`|upvLAyyzaa	I would try it if you feel that's right for you.  It is becoming more popular, especially for people who can't find the time to meet with a therapist in person, or someone who might have trouble opening up to someone face-to-face.

3d6bn4Qzaa	Absolutely not.  Only those with serious sleep disorders need medicine.  Here are a few tips to get you started toward faster sleep:<br>  > Give yourself about 30 minutes before bed to unwind.  If you have a very busy schedule and cannot afford to start preparing for bed 30 minutes early, consider shifting your bedtime back by 30 minutes; after all, you were going to spend that time staring at the ceiling anyway.  <br>  > Turn out most lights and dim the rest.  The amount of light measured by your eyes indicates it is still daytime to your body, you can allow your body to prepare for sleep by convincing it that the sun has gone down and is now nighttime ( this also works for those who work at night and sleep during the day ).  <br>  > If you watch TV or check email or like to read before bed (use a small, LED book light instead of bright overhead lights), try doing so on top of the covers or out of bed.  If you use your bed as casual lounge furniture, your body will not recognize it as the place to rest, but rather to continue working.  Though I must admit, I do like treating myself to some wrapped up comfy TV time with the wifey now and again.  <br>  > Do some stretches, have a few deep breaths, and let your body relax physically.  Do not get over zealous or warmed-up, just release the day's tensions.  <br>  > If you are a heavy thinker at bedtime, pick something specific that you can follow through to completion.  Do not jump from topic to topic, pick something.  If you choose wisely, that mental feeling of completion will aide in preparing the rest of your brain for sleep.  "Ok, lights out.  I am done.  Time for bed.  Zzz."<br>  > Follow a strict routine.  I am not suggesting forever, but just do so until your body gets used to a specific time.  Change into comfy sleepwear.  Stretch.  Dim lights.  Wash face and hands.  Brush teeth.  Go over tomorrow's highlights ( not details ) all the way to completion.  Deep breaths.  Snuggle.  Zzz.  <br>  <br>  Before you know it you will be getting ready for bed without even thinking about it.  Good luck!|`|tsn34pS4aa	eh, i've been on some form of Diphenydramine (the main component in over the counter sleep aids) for two months straight now, and less often since july. i know i shouldn't but if i want an actual good nights sleep, i just gotta. i guess i should go to the doctor because of what the box says (if sleeplessness persists for two weeks...) but i just haven't. i have most likely become dependent which is the issue associated with these little blue pills.<br>  <br>  i am an adult, and i know what i am getting into. if you are a kid (14-17) i say reconsider due to your age, body growing, and that there are kids getting addicted to a high they get from them.<br>  <br>  try doing tiring activities during the day, or getting caffeine into your system around lunch or so or after school so that at bedtime you will actually be physically tired. if you are still considering it, talk to a doctor first.|`|81jCGbj8aa	maybe you should try something that is a little weaker first.<br>  you can get a thing called bedtime tea and it knocks you right out.<br>  it should be with the herbal teas in a supermarket|`|VJ2aG6znaa	Try herbal remedies first.

mCEKMWTYaa	I think it sounds like you may have some type of infection that is causing problems in other areas too.  Remember that your eyes, ears, nose and throat are all "connected" so an infection in one area can affect another area or spread to another area.

Glands are below the ear in the neck. Sounds as if you have a cold and possible sinus infection. This can cause your ears to be stuffy. Ear pain could be an ear infection. antihistamines and decongestants can help. If you cough or blow yellow green mucus that is a sign of an infection and needs an antibiotic.
AA11570236	Your dehydrated drink gatorade to rehydrate you,really works.<br>  Tie one on?

I had a student once who I swore had pink eye in both of her eyes because it was just red and I took her in to the nurses office and she said it was just cause of straining so maybe when you were going number 2 you pushed too hard. This usually happens to people that are constipated. If not try drinking lots of water and take a mulitivitamin supplement along with lots of high water content fruit and veggies. If your eyes dont get better in the next few days , its time to schedule and appointment. Also try to keep your eyes away from the t.v. , computer stuff like that.|`|05SbMDA6aa	I agree, Optrex works but also, you need to rehydrate yourself (obviously don't drink gallons of water as drinking too much can also be detrimental!) aswell as supplement your vitamin c levels which the alchohol would have depleted.

I'm sorry, but there aren't really any options...I'm sure you know this, but it's called fast food for a reason.

Depending on your metabolism, it is possible you eat very few calories and still don't make much progress if you don't exercise.  (This is the case with me).<br>  <br>  The first thing I see as a problem is that you are not eating any real protein before 3 PM.  You're starving at this time because your body is telling you that you did not eat enough.<br>  <br>  You should have some protein in the morning.  My favorite is a yogurt with fresh fruit mixed in.  A hard-boiled egg will also work.<br>  <br>  You should probably have 2 snacks since you don't eat lunch untill 3 PM.  Maybe a piece of fruit around 10 and another around noon (or, another helping of protein).  Even drinking a soy milk at this time may help.<br>  <br>  Chinese take out or burritos are not usually healthy.  They have too much sodium and (usually) too much fat.  Look at the nutritional values they have there (you may have to ask to see it) to be sure you pick the dish that is best for you.  Some kind of salad with a protein on it (chicken or whatever) is usually ideal.<br>  <br>  What is in the soup at 7 PM?  Again, are you getting enough protein?  <br>  <br>  Protein = calories, which is what you burn for energy during the day.  Carbohydrates (such as rice and breads) will turn to sugars and store on your body as fat if you do not use them.|`|0AV9U0Yyaa	It is feasible to lose weight quickly but you should be realistic and accept that if you lose weight fast then you will inevitably put it all back on again just as fast.

I worked off twenty five pounds, it really does work!
Um75aRZFaa	I would call your doctor and tell him what is happening over the phone. The infection could have spread and a new course of treatment might be necessary. The nausia/fever/chills could also be from pain killers you were given. Those symptoms are consistent with opiate withdrawal. Either way I would call your doctor and make an appointment. You should check with him if it is okay to stop using the drug but those are some serious side effects from an antibiotic and I'm going to assume he will tell you stop taking them.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	clinda is a VERY strong antibiotic and not used for a generic infection -you must have strep, staph, or MRSA.  take the med as prescribed & contact your doctor about your symptoms.  you may need to follow up with an infectious disease specialist.

sMuMfuAgaa	A lot of the fad diets with the whole meal plans and prepackaged meals do work but the main thing is that they really don't teach you how to eat healthier.  They give you meals for a certain period of time and then expect you to be able to eat like that when they stop giving it to you.  Also in many of the prepackaged meals they include deserts that you'd think should be tons of calories only they're not...but they taste the same.  That doesn't help when it comes to trying to avoid eating junk food.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	Meal plans combined with exercise regime...<br>  <br>  the most important thing is your routine and what you eat .... exercise comes next..<br>  <br>  Eat more fibre... instead of starving.. it can do wonders... things like brown rice just helps a lot !!!  I eat them as much as i want and never have any side effects.<br>  <br>  Drinking water of course .. is important.<br>  <br>  According to a study... it also depends upon your thinking.. people who gets more into thinking get leaner... <br>  <br>  but it really depends on your body type... i would suggest you should try something for a span of time .. and be regular with it... <br>  <br>  best of luck!

Um75aRZFaa	When you go to a allergist specialist they will do a prick test on your back using a wide range of concentrated allergens. The pricks that present an allergic reaction are noted. The doctor will then create a specific allergy shot containing very small doses of the substances you are allergic too and inject them into the fatty part of your upper arm. Over months or years of treatment the dosage of each allergen are increased over time. Eventually you will be at a point where those allergens no longer affect you as much. They can "cure" allergies but will most likely just decrease the build up of histamines when you come in contact with said allergens. <br>  <br>  I had allergy shots as a child and no longer have any as an adult. Although I can't say for sure if it was the shots that did the job or if I just out grew them.|`|8RjhpbFJaa	an allergy shot is a shot you get when you have allergies (food, pollen, etc.) it helps you so you can grow out of it and so its not so bad.|`|8f8b918d1198f1e196976002004cf9eeaa	They take what you are allergic to and inject small amounts of it into your system. This builds up antibodies that over time will decrease the allergy itself.
Z3bjHCZpaa	Ummm, how about you view the video from a shot glass or a beer bottle. And blacken out the sides that are not shaped with the beer/shot glass.

They do it so that you're going to keep paying and coming back. First off special k is not a wise choice for breakfast. Eat eggs or oatmeal with some skim milk or low fat. Begin counting calories too. And make sure you use italian dressing rather than ranch. Nuts are salty and sodium is in salt. Sodium causes you to retain water, and part of your weight is water weight. Cut the salt intake you cut some water weight. Eat danins diabetic yogurt it's very low carb/sugar.

I'm only trying to lose about 10 pounds and I have been working out and dieting for a month now and have yet to lose a single pound!  Frustrating right???  Well I started doing a lot of research on it and what I have found out is that if your working out as regularly and as much as you are your calorie intake needs to be higher.  Because your burning so many calories and not eating enough to compensate, your body is beginning to go into starvation mode and is actually storing body fat.  I recently, and by recently I mean today, have added more protein to my diet.  That is needed to jump start your metabolism at the beginning of a diet.  Eat about every 3 hours.  3 main meals and about 3 snacks a day.  Everything your eating sounds great you just need more of it.  Especially the protein.  I hope this helped you at least a little bit!
27gxjVJnaa	I use a pair of scissors first to get rid of all the long hair then a Gillette G2 razor the one that vibrates when you shave its a nicer shave and it tickles when you do that nice bit, and plenty of soup|`|IkAtIQumaa	You might be allergic to the shaving cream you use. Buy a different brand or ask your gynecologist. Or your dermatologist.|`|JFbWyKKDaa	It's razor burn... I don't know what to do about that except tell you to wait a little longer between shaving or don't do it at all.|`|uUGSLs9Daa	i have the same problem, its best to get it waxed off, even though it hurts lol.<br>  <br>  or hair removal cream, but that does;nt last as long as being waxed off, there angin arnt they lol x|`|SW17FGBoaa	I think it is just shaving rash and to counteract the sore feeling you might get, try rubbing baby oil on afterwards with talcum powder. It may help with the itchiness.<br>  try waxing if nothing else works :)|`|87nG6aKaaa	well do you shave down there? If so it is pry a razor bump. If you dont shave you should she a docter|`|U4AeZ41Raa	I just wanted to add to everyone's else comments (most I agree with).  I used to have the same problem of razor burn when I shaved.  This is what worked for me:  First, let it grow out a bit the first time, then shave it off gently but thoroughly (you may or may not still get razor burn, but I think it's good to start without the skin being SUPER irritated); then after that you can shave everyday or every other day, but what you do is first put some cheap conditioner on the hair and let it sit, then shave WITH the grain (this might take off next to no hair, but still do it); wait a little bit, and then shave AGAINST the grain, gently and in long strokes.<br>  Usually this drastically reduces the amount of razor burn I have ( I don't have any anymore, but I have to keep up on it everyday, or the next time the skin starts to get irritated).<br>  Also, I use that razor that has the soap around the blades, and I try to always use a fairly new blade in the pubic region.  It helps having the soap/moisturizer around the blade like that.<br>  Good luck! :]<br>  <br>  By the way, if you're like my best friend, nothing may work :/... you could either try trimming really short (like she does), or maybe using a man's trimmor/razor thing that just trims it super short.|`|J8PY1Tnsaa	It's most likely just razor burn. Your skin is being irritated from shaving. If you're shaving too often, skip a day or two in between and let some of the hair resurface itself before you shave it off again. They do have aftershave out there, for women. Pick up a bottle of that, maybe that would help. Just be careful when putting it on that area, as I think it's only made for your legs.<br>  <br>  Also, keep your skin moisturized, drier skin tends to take to razor burn a lot easier I have found.
obVGD37Yaa	GIRL YOU'RE DYING GET TO THE HOSPITAL NOW!!!!!!!!!!!! GO GO GO!!!!!!|`|3GHXk05saa	Yes, it's coagulated blood. You are bleeding in either your stomach or just below in your duodenum. Your body has started to digest the blood so that's why it's brown or black and not red. <br>  You need to get to a doctor so they can find out how bad you're bleeding. It could be a small ulcer, or it could be more serious, enough that you could become anemic or even bleed to death. This is nothing to fool around with. Please tell a parent and get to the doctor.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Ashley is full of it. From wiki:<br>  Bile or gall is a bitter yellow or green acidic fluid secreted by hepatocytes from the liver of most vertebrates. In many species, bile is stored in the gallbladder between meals and upon eating is discharged into the duodenum where the bile aids the process of digestion of lipids.|`|OleVPkJgaa	brownish black IS the color of bile. if you threw up blood, it would definitely be red because it would be from your esophagus tearing.<br>  <br>  well hey guess what, it IS BILE. even if you dont want to believe it. i prooomise you it is. you have been throwing up for so long now that your stomach is so used to the jerks and heaves of food reversal that it is getting better at. throwin in some intestinal juices now too.|`|3Ks21ASDaa	Brown or black blood means it's old blood so it took a while to get up to your mouth. You probably have some kind of rupture or internal bleeding. Please see your doctor immediately. Also, get some help for bulemia. That is so damaging to the body.|`|Ujo6TiZNaa	Sounds like it could be an ulcer.<br>  You NEED to get to a doctor about this, because blood in sick can indicate something much more serious, especially if it's dark as this means it has come from within deep in your digestive system.|`|8hyxabYOaa	EMERGENCY ROOM ASAP. please.
bCmqScVlaa	Your friend is just talking nonsense.  Anyone that drinks enough to have cirrhosis has a serious problem.  The least of his problems is worrying about drinking one drink compared to many. If he drinks none at all, that would solve his being :sick and feverish."   I guess he is trying to tell you that it must be OK to drink a lot since that doesn't make him sick like just one drink does.  <br>  <br>  If he has cirrhosis and continues to drink, he will die.  That's a fact.  The more he drinks, the quicker the death will come from total liver failure.|`|OleVPkJgaa	yeah wow<br>  i'm thinkin he's LYING to you.<br>  he's obviously an alcoholic that hasnt decided e wants to stop drinking yet...even after a major liver issue.<br>  the liver is a poison filter. if a little poison (aka alcohol) enters it and it freaks out, then a LOT would make it freak out a LOT.
YRJShhKraa	Group Support<br>  <br>  Group support or therapy can take place within an inpatient program, an outpatient program, a therapists office, or within an independent support group. Support groups can vary in their objectives and it is important to find out the goals and methods of the group you wish to attend. Group support may be aimed at the sufferers getting support and understanding from peers, or it may be aimed at incorporating members of the family.<br>  <br>  Group therapy is usually facilitated by a professional therapist. Support groups can be facilited by a professional therapist, intern, recovered person, loved-one of a person living with an Eating Disorder, or someone else interested in working to help others (and maybe themselves) recover.<br>  <br>  There are many different types of groups... some will be held in private homes, others in a rented or donated space, and some in a treatment center, hospital, university, highschool, or therapist's office. Some support group topics may include: spirituality, art therapy, coping strategies, family issues, general discussion, communication, inner-child work, body image, nutritional groups, or any combination of the above. Find what appeals to you most and what you think will help you on your road to recovery.<br>  <br>  <br>  Therapy<br>  <br>  There are different types of people who can provide you with therapy... Counselors, Social Workers, Psychologists, and Psychiatrists. Most of them should have some kind of degree representing the type of education they have received. The therapist may or may not be licensed, but should have a degree in the theories of psychology, psychotherapy, social work or counseling. Whether a license is important or not comes down to your own decision. There are many good counselors and social workers who are not licensed medical doctors, but who can still provide you with good therapy. As long as they have a degree, the only technical difference is that they cannot prescribe or administer medications. What is most important is that you are in a comfortable and safe environment, conducive to recovery, and with someone who can counsel you effectively.<br>  <br>  Psychiatrists (Ph.D) are generally more expensive and tend to focus on admissions, diagnosis, evaluations and medication administration. There are psychiatrists who do and do not provide psychotherapy. Not all psychiatrists are trained in practical psychotherapy unless they have sought some kind of post-graduate education.<br>  <br>  Psychologists (Psy.D. or Ph.D.) are the ones who are trained in the theories of pyschotherapy. A licensed psychologist can prescribe and administer medication if it is necessary.<br>  <br>  Marriage, Family and Child Counselor (MFCC), Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT) and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) are not very different from psychologists depending on the state you live in (licensing issues vary from state to state). Most can provide the same level of counseling as a psychologist.<br>  <br>  Marriage, Family and Child Interns (MFCI) or Marriage and Family Therapist Interns (MFTI) are exactly that... interns. They are working in clinical practice to fulfill requirements they need to be licensed. They can see clients and all work is usually supervised by someone already in a licensed position.<br>  <br>  Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCW) has a degree in social work with a strong clinical focus. They can make very good therapists because of the strong focus on psychoanalytic and pyschodynamic theories in their education.<br>  <br>  A Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) in some states, is equivalent to a MFCC or LMFT, and is trained in counseling.<br>  <br>  Types of Counseling Your Therapist Can Provide<br>  (Theories of Psychotherapy)<br>  <br>  <br>  Individual Counseling -<br>  <br>  The ultimate goal of your therapy should be to recover! To learn to be more confident in yourself, to make your voice heard through communication, to validate your own emotions, to learn to love yourself, and to learn better ways of coping with anger, sadness and stress (and not rely on your Eating Disorder). You will spend many hours talking to your therapist about your childhood, your experiences, and your day-to-day life, and all of this is important to your recovery. There are many ways a therapist can work with you individually, and different therapists have different methods. The name of the approach is not as important as the methods used, so it will be important for you to discuss with your therapist your goals in working towards recovery.<br>  <br>  Psychoanalytic: This is a clinical approach through interpretation, dream analysis, free association, analysis of resistance and transference. This all assists the client in gaining access to their subconscious, to the internal conflicts they may not be aware of, and in gaining new insights. There is a strong focus on repressed conflicts and less focus on social, cultural and interpersonal factors.<br>  <br>  Nonpsychoanalytic (Jungian) Therapy: Self realization and learning to accept yourself as an individual
H2qEN27daa	Go to a dermatologist, have them look at it and remove it. My friend had a mole that she consistently scratched and it kept bleeding and got worse and worse looking, She got it removed and now has a slight scar, but I feel that is because she kept agravating it. Def. get it checked out, your Dr. will also have it tested for cancer as that is a normal precaution they take. <br>  <br>  Here's some mole information:<br>  Out of the ordinary a bleeding mole can occur. There are many reasons why a mole bleeds. A bleeding mole can be caused by irritation while a mole is scratched or rubbed off with the skin or clothing. It could be caused by an accident while shaving the skin with a razor blade. Some people have hairs on moles that are unsightly and they usually trim or cut the hairs with scissors or tweezers. This will not remove the hairs permanently and eventually the hairs will grow back again. As the new moles grow the mole becomes itchy. Some people may unconsciously pick or scratch the skin. A bleeding mole may or may not pose a medical threat but to be sure, see a dermatologist.|`|uDOVf2vvaa	I had a mole that was itching and because skin cancer is in my family I got it checked and it was cancerous. I am not saying yours is but I wouldn't take a chance especially if cancer is in your family or you've spent a lot of time in the sun. Get  it checked and watch for any moles that change shape, size or color or have irregular edges, or itch. Good luck!|`|OleVPkJgaa	its itching because its forming a scab and trying to heal<br>  stop messin with it! stop it....stooooopppp. it's like a mosquito bite; itch it enough  and it will bleed, and then when you get a scab Thats itchy too. put an ice cube to it so it'll numb the nerve receptors wherever the mole is so you dont feel the itch.|`|Um75aRZFaa	The itching is from the mole healing/scarring. If the mole has changed in size or has become discolored (before you scratched it open) you can put your mind at ease by visiting a dermatologist and getting it biopsied.|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	Have it checked out, it could be a malignant melanoma.
veeC7Rvvaa	Because you ignore these feelings and let them bottle up, so whenever you have a chance to finaly speak up and reach out, you feel overwhelmed with so many feelings that you have tried to keep secret and under control.. <br>  It's nothing to be ashamed of.. I really feel for you.. I think you need some counciling and a good ol' cry. Have you tried keeping a diary? Writing your feelings may help.|`|xDdmnf80aa	You sound a little depressed. maybe you need to speak to a doctor and prehaps get some counselling. speaking to someone about your worrys may help you deal with things on your mind a little better.|`|ZUwBvmNzaa	No i don't think you need help. Different people deal with problems in different ways. Some are more emotional than others and express themselves in different ways.<br>  For example when some people are sad or just down, they feel the need to cry because its the only way they know and feel comfortable to express their feelings. Whereas other punch walls or shout at loved ones.<br>  Don't worry its totally normal.<br>  It also depends on how old you are. If your young then your still hormonal. If im honest i don't speak to other people about my problems, i shut off and don't speak, mainly because i know i'll start crying.<br>  Honestly its fine to cry. Never think its not ok too. :)|`|NIAmYzZ7aa	Just keep on clearing your mind in these events, so if you talk to doctors clear you mind and think, he is helping me, he is very professional, he knows more about me than myself*dont break down*. the more you think before you act it helps <br>  <br>  this is called the ironity method, c pyschological help for more information, you are fine jst need ressuarance thts all|`|5eekpFG9aa	I think you just need to become more comfortable in your own skin.  There are things I dislike about myself, too.  Some of them are hard to accept, but life goes on.  Surround yourself with friends and family.  Sometimes all you need is someone to talk to :) .
GbzxnGcIaa	First of all,for dry skin,it is really important for you to apply lotion or moisturizer to your dry skin areas to improve moisture balance of your skin.For this,I would recommend you to try Nivea Body Lotion,Kose Body Lotion,St. Ives Lotion or Lancome Body Lotion since all of these lotion is gentle for dry skin and improve your dry skin areas in a few weeks.However,I would still recommend you to try St. Ives instead since it works best for all skin types and has a big range of any skin types.If your face is dry,do apply Vitamin E Moisturizer on your face and don't forget to apply any sunblock whenever you go outdoors to prevent moisture loss.<br>  <br>  Besides lotion,you might as well try to eat lots of fruits such as apple since fruits promote water retention and hydrates your skin.Plus,drink lots of water to hydrate your skin internally.You should also avoid hot shower since this could make your skin worse.Get a body shampoo which is not aggressive and moisturize your skin such as Dove.Good luck and hope I helped(:|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Use Olay!|`|OleVPkJgaa	Cosmetic Procedures: Skin Care for Dry Skin<br>  Dry skin most often occurs on the shins, hands and sides of the abdomen. It is more common during the winter months, when humidity is low. Some people also have a genetic, or hereditary, tendency to develop dry skin. In addition, elderly people tend to have more trouble with dry skin due to the natural changes in skin that occur with age.<br>  <br>  Treatment is important because extensively dry skin can lead to dermatitis, a more severe inflammation of the skin.<br>  <br>  Dry skin may be prevented or treated by:<br>  <br>  Taking lukewarm baths or showers (instead of hot ones)<br>  Limiting baths/showers to 5 to 10 minutes<br>  Applying a moisturizer right after drying off from a shower or washing your hands<br>  Using a moisturizing body soap and hand soap<br>  Using heavier creams or ointments during the winter months and lighter lotions in the summer<br>  How Do I know if I Have Dermatitis?<br>  Dry skin is defined as flaking or scaling -- which may or may not be itchy -- when there is no evidence of dermatitis, or inflammation, of the skin. Some flaking along with redness, however, may be a sign of an underlying dermatitis. There are different types of dermatitis that may cause dry, itchy, flaking skin.<br>  <br>  They include:<br>  <br>  Seborrheic dermatitis. This type involves a red, scaly, itchy rash on various areas of the body, particularly those areas that contain many oil glands. Seborrheic dermatitis can occur as scaling on the scalp, eyebrows and sides of the nose.<br>  Allergic contact dermatitis. This occurs when the skin comes into contact with a substance that causes an immune reaction, such as poison ivy. Allergic contact dermatitis of the hands often causes scaling on the fingers.<br>  Atopic dermatitis. Also known as eczema, this is a long-lasting type of dermatitis that often runs in families. It also may cause excessively dry, itchy skin.<br>  Athlete's foot. In many cases, athlete's foot, a fungal infection, shows up as dry flaking on the soles of the feet.
c0O0831Eaa	tell you parents about this.<br>  go to the doctor.<br>  it could be bad
XSu3dedGaa	Ice is good. Pedialyte however is for children. For an adult who needs re-hydrating you need something more, start him on gatorade if you can get it to replenish electolytes then go to your pharmacy and get oral re-hydration salts, they're typically for adults, and will do a better job than the pedialyte is doing, and if he's only dry heaving now, they'll stay down.<br>  <br>  Just because his arms aren't achey that doesn't mean he's not having a heart attack, it's unlikely seeing as it's been so long but it's not something you should stop considering just because he has normal feeling arms. Heart attacks have many symptoms not all will be noticed by every sufferer just as with all other illnesses.<br>  <br>  The chest pain is normal if he has been constantly vomiting and is now dry heaving, he's probably just pulled a chest muscle, it's common with constant vomiting and not something for you to seriously worry about unless it gets worse.<br>  <br>  That little girl that doesn't belong to you needs to go home, you don't know what's wrong with your boyfriend yet and if he's contagious you need to keep contact with other people and him to a minimum, whether her mother wants her to go home or not, it's in her best interests that she does. Your boyfriend can't seriously be expected to look after two children by himself if he's this ill, it's not fair on him or the children.<br>  <br>  Keep him hydrated, it may just be he ate something that disagreed with him, if it goes on longer than two days and you notice any other symptoms such as severe or acute abdominal pain, think about taking him to a doctor, but tell them at the time why he's coming in, they may ask you to wait until the end of the day just in case he is contagious, to stop him infecting others.<br>  <br>  Gatorade or lucozade and oral hydration salts and loads of rest are going to be better for him than pedialyte, but until you can get those keep him on the small doses pedialyte, but not so often.|`|M6HzBoj7aa	The best thing to do is to go see a doctor.

5obNah1waa	What do you mean by "i get a cold that lasts for an hour'?  If you are referring to runny nose and dry cough, these are normal reactions to cold weather.  The cold dries and freezes mucous membranes causing a dry cough.  It also freezes the cilia in the nasal cavity.  The cilia are what "sweep" the mucous that runs out of your nose back up.  When they are frozen they don't function properly and the mucous runs out.
TcMa4a7paa	It is very possible that it is from the antibiotics.  I would not worry about it if you are not experiencing any pain.  If you begin feeling pain while going to the bathroom, contact your physician because there could be an unrelated problem going on.|`|6wR9QkAlaa	uh oh. Did it hurt when you peed? You could be getting cystitis. If you're taking antibiotics you have to remember to eat yoghurt or take some good bacteria supplements. Antibiotics are at the same time a blessing and a curse because they just kill off every type of bacteria in your body good and bad!|`|4WVbjbWxaa	yeah it is probably because of that..<br>  <br>  <br>  nothing to worry about.. i guess|`|evB63qWvaa	It's quite possible that it's the antibiotics or just something you ate, but it's nothing to worry about.|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	It most likely is.

M3pRAe7Vaa	Chicken noodle soup is always good when you are sick.  Drink a lot of water as well, as a fever is dehydrating and you need fluids.  Since your throat hurts, you need something that will not hurt going down; soft foods.  Try rice (can be flavored like rice pilaf), any kind of soup, macaroni, spaghetti.  Just make sure you drink water and take care or yourself.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|3GHXk05saa	Chicken soup (of course). Try pudding or custard if you can tolerate the milk, it won't irritate your throat. Gelatin is good, too. Mashed potatoes or noodles with a little butter is mild and goes down easily. A little diluted ginger ale once your throat doesn't hurt as much, then you can move up to juice.<br>  Hope you feel better.|`|Z3bjHCZpaa	umm i usually like toast and peanut butter or toast and jam.|`|ZY6svhldaa	When I'm sick like that, toast with a little bit of peanut butter on it works :)|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	A hearty broth is good.
M3pRAe7Vaa	It is true you can be dependent on laxatives.  The reason to take them is for irregularity, and as you said, you are not irregular.  That being said, you also said you take them to reduce weight the night before your weekly weigh-in.  FYI...The weight of your bowel movement does not weight as much as you think, and does not impact you overall weight by much for than a few ounces, NOT pounds.  So, what you have been doing for a months has been pretty pointless, and also can be dangerous to your natural cycle.  Please be safe and stop taking the laxatives, they aren't doing anything for maintaining your weight, and can be dangerous when used inappropriately.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with this, as well as your MS.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Two pills once a week?<br>  <br>  That's nothing... <br>  <br>  You're fine.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about it why not try working prunes or a natural alternative into your diet?|`|be1526199d1ecf02c956ea2a8302d69faa	OMG stop doing this to your body. Ex lax is bad for you even if you are taking it for constipation. You are not maintaining your weight by doing this you are losing water. And if you have MS you should be taking care of yourself as best you can. Seek a nutritionist to help you choose a healthy diet.
