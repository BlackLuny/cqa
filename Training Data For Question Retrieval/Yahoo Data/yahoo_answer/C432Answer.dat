4z0Rk4Ddaa	If you think that flies are attracted to the soffit on your home then you may have something dead in there. (something has gotten inside of the area that the soffit covers and died)  Need to get up there and take a look to see what it is and remove it and that will take care of the flies being attracted to the soffit and facia.  Or you could wait until they are done feeding on what ever it is that they are eating.  You could also make sure you have screens in your windows before you open them.<br>  Same with your doors.  Make sure you use screens in your storm doors so they do not get in that way.|`|Mi90leiTaa	fly traps

Suction is not that great once the filter gets dirty.  Would I buy another one?  No.  Not worth the money you spend for one.  The best hand held vacuum would be one that holds a charge for longer than 20 minutes.  That you can plug in to use if you choose.  That has better suction at all times.

The key is north, the further north you go, you generally have less insects, but too far north like canada and you get biting flys like crazy, so id say like illinois, wisconsin, michigan, ohio, all these northern midwest states would prolly be best, luisianna would be the worst

YmeS75aSaa	The belt that spins the drum is probably broken, worn, or has slipped off. The reason the breaker is tripping is because the motor has no resistance and is going too fast using more power than the breaker can handle. There should be an access panel you can remove either on one side, front or back of the washer to allow you to change the belt.|`|ZhN9hOaaaa	When you have a circuit breaker trip like that and the light dim you have a heavy short and it is probably your motor in the bottom of the washer. It isn't just the belt.. A free spinning motor would unload rather than load so it isn't just the belt.

To get the stain out, I would try rubbing alcohol, nail polish remover or even hair spray. All of them break down the pigment in permanent marker, and non of them are greasy which may cause another stain.

2VXJnNUYaa	If you can afford topgrain leather thats the way to go. It won't crack with proper care. The 'leather' that you've seen cracking has probably been leather that has been ground to a powder and suspended in a resilient base to create something furniture makers call Natuzzi Leather or some other brand name. It is not solid leather but because a component if the upholstery is leather they get by with calling it leather. <br>  Get leather if you have pets otherwise get microfiber.
AA10526402	You should get two panels that are at least 48"W each; 60" W would be ideal though.

Let it dry out for two or three days.|`|YaeG1cjhaa	First is the question of what kind of plants are they? Different plants  get different maladies. What are the environmental components? ( air conditioner, heater vent etc.) It's probably not a root problem since the first signs of root diseases shows up on the top of the plant, not the bottom as you have described. (the effected plant's root system isn't strong enough to carry nutrients and water to the top) <br>  Miracle grow is OK but not the best. It usually has a high P # in the NPK rating and can shock young plants that aren't ready to flower. It is also a chemical fertilizer which is Ok for the plant, (they can't tell the difference between chemical and organic compounds) but destructive to the environment. And many are based on petroleum by-products.<br>  In order to tell if your plants need water all you have to do is stick your finger in the pot. If it feels dry about an inch down, you can water. Watering in pots can be tricky since the capilary action of water is different in pots than it is in the ground. Make sure that the plants are watered completely (that is so the water runs out of the drainage holes) Certain pots tend to draw water to the sides and away from the center of the plant where it is needed.<br>  As far as grow lights, you can use a CFL for a spectrum that is beneficial to plants. Not quite a grow bulb but our grocery stores sell them in 4 packs for around a buck. Something to make do in the meantime. Good Luck.

AA11305474	Dogs are my passion, too, and I have found that creeping fig is nearly indestructible.  I have it growing on the face and top of a retaining wall, across a path and onto a wrought iron fence.  My humongous siberian husky (RIP Boo) liked to sit on top of the retaining wall and scope out his kingdom below and even he couldn't kill the stuff climbing up there.  It is fast growing, needs little care other than pruning it back when it gets out of control and is drought tolerant (I live in SoCal where temps can get over 100 degrees).  Best of all you can find it at the home improvement stores in flats and they are inexpensive.|`|w45r9DREaa	This may not be the answer you're looking for, but given the variables of keeping the dogs safe from the plants and the plants safe from the dogs, weather that will do what it wants, when it wants, regardless of season, bugs, disease, etc., how about getting those privacy strips that you weave in and out of chain link to block the views? Then your mom can put all sorts of things there to landscape for her pleasure, and for the dogs'! I've always found it difficult to rely on anything but hardy shrubs for privacy, and even if they are fast growing nothing grows fast enough when it comes to your privacy. I wish you luck (and envy your mom her big backyard!)
H1s8BEVTaa	Actually it IS true. Plugs them up tight.|`|03sLrNPCaa	Chewing gum probably would plug them right up if they ate it, but moles are strictly carnivorous and won't even eat chewing gum of any flavor.  A totally unproven old wives' tale.
VYCLwKwNaa	Here's what works for me. I put some of the Spray and Wash stuff on just the stain, let it soak in for awhile (20 minutes or whatever the bottle says), then put the clothes in the washer in cold water and air dry them. Don't get Spray and Wash on anything else, or let it touch any design part of the hoodie. I've seen it fade the color of a person's kitchen counter. <br>  If you wash a stained item in hot water, or dry it in the dryer, the heat can set the stain and nothing will get it out. <br>  When I am REALLY worried about a stain, I add a second step. After soaking the stained spot with Spray and Wash (which also comes in a squirt bottle, which is smaller than the spray bottle), I wash the clothes in the washer, in cold water, with liquid Biz instead of soap, or with both some liquid Biz and the soap. Biz is supposed to be safe for all colors. Again, do not put your hoodie in the dryer. If you have a top-loading washer, run some water into the washer and dissolve the Biz and soap in the water in the washer before you add your hoodie. That way, you won't risk more spots on your hoodie from pouring Biz or detergent on them. If you have a front-loader washer, put the liquid Biz in with your soap or in the little bin that says Bleach. <br>  If you end up having to buy a big bottle of Biz, don't worry, you'll be using it again. <br>  A word of advice for the future: if you ever get food on your clothes, wash them right away. The same day. The best is to take them off immediately and go directly to the sink or the washing machine and use lukewarm or cold water and try to wash or rinse out as much as you can. The longer they sit, the more likely that the stain will not come out. The foods actually undergo a chemical change, so something that seems like no problem can turn into a nasty spot, especially if it has any kind of protein, fat or grease in it, which includes milk and ice cream. <br>  <br>  If you happen to know what food made the stain, take a look on the internet under "stain removal" and the name of the food that did it. You might find more directions specific to the food. Search more than one place, because some sites are not very accurate. If you see the same answer 4 or 5 times, it's more likely to be right.<br>  <br>  If it really won't come out, maybe you can find some nice applique patch to sew over it. Places like Michaels and JoAnns have the embroidered patches, in all designs and colors. Depending on what kind of hoodie it is, you could also put on a gold metal fancy pin, a skateboard patch, the patch from a sports team, etc. Or you can cut a small but nice design out of another item of clothing or purse/bag and sew it over the stain.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|nOVSf06Raa	just spray some stain remover like Shout on it and rub with your hands, after that wash it in cold water ,read the label first perhaps you can even use warm water .|`|sw2R5A9iaa	avoid bleach -it can ruin most fabrics.  pre treat with a stain remover, wash, and air dry.|`|S0ZCIDgzaa	There isn't any correct way to answer your question without knowing more information.

wKQbNvm9aa	I never heard of daffodils blooming in the summer.  You should take really good notes and pictures and get a good bulb catalog, like Brecks, and find the daffodils in the catalog that match.  The descriptions of the bulbs in the catalog will include information about whether they are early or late bloomers and how tall they get, etc.  and will of course have pictures so you can figure out what you have.
wKQbNvm9aa	This does sound like a challenge!  Don't know where you live... cool weather grasses are hard to establish in the spring - it would work better in the fall.  But if you want to work on it now, the thing to do would be to spray a broadleaf weed killer, aerate, spread compost, overseed the yard.    Those weird shrubby things sound like maybe they should go.   If there is any growth on them at all, you could spray them with Roundup till they all die.  Then remove the roots if you can.<br>  <br>  OR,  spray Roundup on the whole area.  In a week or two, till it all up with a lot of added compost to improve the concrete soil.  Lay sod, or seed.   If you are planting fescue, blue grass or rye and live in a place where it gets really hot in the summer, you may have to reseed in the fall.  I think this is what I would do.

gaITsKksaa	Let's take some time with your original desire i.e. morning glories. I really appreciate these plants BUT they consume everything in sight. If you want them anyway, you need to plan on pruning them often. They will fill-up any planter you put them in so there won't actually be room for something else. If you'd STILL like to go ahead, one person mentioned daisies. There is a tiny daisy-like plant called Erigeron (Santa Barbara daisy) that's a real doll. It will cascade over the edge and it will have flowers almost year-round.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Small snap dragons....|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	red geraniums.|`|xmibEEdcaa	I liked the Baby's Breath suggestion!  For a gentle look, I think that a pastel pink would go nicely with the deep blue morning glories. Maybe one of the smaller-flowered petunias, in a light pastel shade of pink? Or, if you want something more delicate than petunias, how about annual verbena? It also comes in pastel shades and has that tiny fairy look to it.<br>  <br>  I'd also throw some sweet alyssum in there. Not only does it have the delicate little flowers that match the look I think you're going for, but it also has a lovely sweet honey smell which I think would be nice on a porch. (I always throw some sweet alyssum into anything near the door, because I love to smell it when I come home).<br>  <br>  Finally, although this may sound odd, one of the silver or lemon thymes might be nice for foliage.

WtqsWctjaa	The reason for the creaking is your floor has shifted and become loose from the beams they were fastened to. If your floor is nailed, the nails have pulled up even ever so slightly. That being the case you'll either have to renail the floors down or find the "loose" spots and screw them back down.

bf5cDEyZaa	The crisper drawer is designed to control humidity rather than temperature.<br>  Vegetables will dry out and get flabby unless the humidity is kept relatively high, so the crisper keeps water vapor in. Fruits require a lower humidity than vegetables, so some crispers have adjustable openings that you're supposed to readjust every time you change the contents. If you have two drawers, keep fruits in one and vegetables in the other, adjusting the humidity accordingly.
UNUJNgHxaa	I am not sure what the question is. Are you saying that the fan is in the on position? If the fan is in the on position and the fan is humming then it sounds like you may have a bad fan or a bad run capacitor. If the fan is in the off position and you are hearing the hum sound then It is the step down transformer. Basically it is in the standby position waiting for a call from the thermostat. If that is the case then that is normal. If the fan is stuck and not turning then there are a couple of steps you can do to test this. If you need further information please let me know and I will do my best to help.  I hope this helps.

pDKm9Wmgaa	Do any of the branches look like they were burned in a fire? If so, your tree has Fireblight. Crabapples are prone to fireblight. There are cultivars out there that are more resistant to fireblight, but it takes thorough research to find the ones that will work well in your climate zone and be resistant. These links take you to information on crabapple diseases.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bickarb.org/flowertree/care/disease.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bickarb.org/flowertree/care/d...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bachmans.com/retail/tipsheets/diseases/diseasesornamentalcrabapples.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bachmans.com/retail/tipsheets...</a>|`|xmibEEdcaa	It sounds like a fungus problem to me. Trees in the apple family are really prone to fungus problems.  <br>  <br>  The best way to stop this from happening is first, to maintain really good hygiene around the base of the tree.  Fungus loves to overwinter on the rotting fallen fruit under fruit trees. Be sure to pick up all the fallen fruit and rake up all the leaves, and if you want to compost them, compost them somewhere far away from the dripline of the tree.  <br>  <br>  The second thing you can do is to spray the tree in late winter, just before it breaks dormancy. There are a number of "dormant sprays" you can buy for this purpose: unfortunately, many of them are really nasty, toxic substances.  (Don't be fooled by the label "organic." Some of the organic dormant sprays are the nastiest ones!)  Unfortunately, the nastiest ones are also the most effective. So it's up to you how you want to negotiate that trade-off.  But if you don't want to use harsh chemicals, even spraying the tree with a mixture of baking soda, water, and just a drop of organic dishwashing detergent will still go a long way in helping to cut down on all of the overwintering nasties. It's not nearly as difficult a task as it sounds, if you get one of those sprayers designed to fit on the end of your hose.<br>  <br>  The third thing that might help is getting the tree pruned by someone who knows what they're doing. Professional pruners are great at opening up the inside of the tree without making it look butchered. This keeps the tree healthier overall, and you'll also get much better flowering and fruiting from it.  It'll probably look a lot prettier, too. It will cost you, though.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, none of these are things you can really do right now. See to them over the fall and winter, though, and I suspect you'll have a much happier, less fungus-y tree by next spring.

When the bees are brought to their new home they're put in a special bee box and allowed to rebuild their hive.  <br>  Bees are endangered due to a bee mite which came from Europe and is killing off Americian honeybees.  Please don't poison them!!|`|wcxuzttIaa	just keep on smoking them. eventually they'll lead off to your house. trust me
2Ypig4jBaa	The speed of the fan in RPM varies from model to model.<br>  Just like on an airplane the Speed (RPM) and the angle of the blades determine amount of air that is moved.  The angle of the blades called "Pitch", effects how big of a bite the blade will take out of the air on each revolution.   It is far more common to rate a fan by the CFM.  This is the cubic feet per minute of air that it is able to move.<br>  A small slow fan can be 80 CFM or less while a large fast fan may move 10,000 CFM|`|N0TJqtzMaa	they wont make your room lift off,go to hunters web site and it will tell you the rpms of all their fans or hampton bay|`|215f94929cd73f525c67170c8b14df25aa	I would use my speed indicator, if you don`t have one ask around some of your friends will.  Also there are 3 to 5 speeds for most of them.  <br>  <br>  If you do the above, you will have the correct reading, not what  the MFG. suggest.
8apA3Rffaa	The average price for a decent wood , and this is a full 3/4 prefinished wood, starts at $3.00  a s/f  and up..The extras will include 4 rolls of rosin paper or felt .. I know rosin paper is 300 s/f per roll at $9  a roll.. Renting a nailer ( air driven is best to rent.)  The nails or staples  and see what your manufacturer says about the stapler.  These can most often be used but check it out..plan ahead to see if you need spline  in case you have to reverse the wood, this is cheap but if you have some ot know if you ll need it,  it won t stop the project. You have to get rid of the old carpet and pad,  and I have suggestions on how to get rid of that..<br>     You can paint over the paneling  just do that 1 st before you put down the wood  but after the carpet rip up and clean up since you ll have to clean all the wood 1st and you ll be shocked at how much dirt and dust is under the carpet and padding..Any flooring questions you can e nail me thru my avatar..

Try Lumber Liquidators if you have one in your area (<a href="http://www.lumberliquidators.com)," rel="nofollow">http://www.lumberliquidators.com),</a> they have pretty good prices, especially if you buy from the clearance list.<br>  As for painting paneling, we did that in our house and it looks fine. Just make sure they are clean and smooth before you start.|`|glRVp2Mdaa	I did my floors (about 1000 sq. ft) for $900.00, flooring delivered by Fed/ex freight, (the expensive part was the shipping) and that included the underlining.

AA10963967	The most prolific indoors, low-light plant is philodendron.  They grow fabulously in artificial light.  If the leaves are variegated (green with white or yellow stripes) they do even better.  Philodendrons are also very inexpensive, and you can take clippings from the runners it produces to make more plants.  Just give it a good drink once a week and a tiny pinch of fertilizer once a month, dissolved in the water and it will be very happy.   <br>  I have a philodendron on my basement windowledge.  It only gets light from the shoplights hanging overhead, and is watered mostly by the dregs of my husband's tea or coffee mugs (and when I remember to bring down a quart jar of water).  It's full, lush, and has 12 foot long trailers full of heart shaped leaves.|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	As mmerobin said, philodendrons are your best bet. They are almost impossible to kill once they take root. I remember to throw water on the one I have at work about once every two weeks and have never fertilized it and it is in great shape. I've even propagated several cuttings from it (just shop off a runner, stick it in a glass of water for about a week to get the new roots going, then plant it). They are also apparently good plants as far as oxygen production is concerned, so they will not only look nice, but will help the air quality of your office.|`|HV8i5qcHaa	Chineese Bamboo Plants..need very little water, and almost no light at all
UNUJNgHxaa	This may sound like a joke but believe me it is not. You can use ketchup to clean it. It has an acid base to it that will not damage the brass but will clean it like new. Some people use hot sauce, It too will work. I can tell you that when working with hot sauce the chances are great that you will splash it. Ever get Tabasco in the eye's? Not a great day if you do. try the ketchup. If it does not seem to work then give the Tabasco a try. Just keep you eyes closed when you do. Have you ever cried wile cutting an onion?? Well Tabasco in the eyes is 30 times worse. I know this as a fact. I hope this helps and good luck to you.|`|WZdEdgxwaa	shasta,they never taught us that in the army "grin".Hey,it's worth a go at it.I'm gonna put that one in my bag of tricks.<br>  <br>  My Best|`|AA10213978	I work at a dialysis center and we have a special water system which is in place to use during a patients dialysis treatment.  Anyway,  the water treatment system that we have yields an end product of RO/DI water.  Which is Reverse Osmosis AND Deionization.   This type of water (after its entire treatment process) If poured onto an item that has deposits of lime/calcium or whatever actually absorbs the minerals (due to the fact that it has ZERO in it).  I suspect that if you could get your hands on a little bit of this type of water it could help you. I'm not too sure if you know anyone what works a a dialysis facility but there are MANY industrial water systems out there that transform regular water into the type that you possibly could use.<br>  <br>  or spray it with WHITE DISTILLED VINEGAR and see what that does for you.|`|iko1uqBnaa	dude so simple learned this in my time in the navy the best thing to clean brass believe it or not tabasco sauce it will take anything off brass and give it a mirror shine up to military inspection quality <br>  there is a lot of brass on a navy ship I don't know about the army
LqaQ5f5Vaa	your doing the right thing by airing the room, i would say don't use the carpet cleaners again, sounds like they don't know what there doing, the carpet should of felt lightly damp when they finished, think they didn't suck enough water up|`|57502521dc0b77626e264db4b7c3aaf2aa	Put a fan blowing across the top of the carpet.  This will help it dry faster.  It still will not be very quick.  Make sure it is dry before placing items on it.|`|pxVCuDoyaa	The best thing to do is turn up the heat in ur house and allow a lot of air circulation such as a fan.

IICuVmPcaa	You're a very adventurous 13 year old.  Well done.<br>  Have you tried ebay for your furniture.  Many merchants have furniture packages where shipping is included in the price so you will have no surprises when it comes to the price.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you do a search in the country where you live for the term "black trundle twin bedroom set" and see what it returns.  If that doesn't return any answers then try "black bedroom furniture" or use the word "dark bedroom furniture" and see what these return.  You may find something second hand that suits.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure of the ebay rules, you may need to be 18 to purchase online, so just in case, get your parents involved or a friend over 18.<br>  <br>  Buying online can save you heaps of money and  you may come in well under budget.  <br>  Good Luck|`|l9xnybUMaa	OK, so you really want to redo your room, you do know that will take more than furniture?  If you already know what style you want for your room then its easier to find furniture, if its modern vs traditional or girly.<br>  Black furniture usually has a graphic contemporary feel, a little sleek and metallic, also masculine.  There are lots of options for bedroom sets,<br>  use a furniture website software to try out different arrangements of furniture, dressers vary alot, do you need a desk?  Must you have a twin trundlebed?  This limits your choices to primarily kids furniture. One way around this is to use a twin bed without a trundle, then buy a trundle frame and mattress to slide under it.  Also think about it if you are planning to move out and take this with you do you really want your first bachelor pad to have a trundle bed?  :)  Check around with large manufacturers like rcwilley, ashley,ethan allen, and oh yeah...ikea.  Once you have selected and ordered your furniture then you can REALLY redo your room...paint, art, lamps, shelves, window treatments, mobiles, tv and stereo, rugs, chairs and more!
jcauTPLZaa	At 120' if you use #10 you will have a 3.7% voltage drop. The max is 5%, if I was doing this I would bite the bullet and run #8 that way in the future if you needed to replace the compressor with a larger one you will have the capacity. Either way you need to run new wire with a ground so you can ground it properly. Use a 30 amp double pole breaker for this.|`|AA10625552	10 wire should be just fine.<br>  Use a 30 amp breaker for this.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	With the distance you are from the power panel, it would not hurt the system to use the larger #8 wire and a #10 ground and the 30 amp breaker.  The inrush current will be enough to lug the motor down when starting with a 10 wire. This will damage the motor over the long term.

J6Ksn0P7aa	Yep, you are right, looks like ginestra to me.  It can be a very bad weed if it gets into wild areas, so if you are looking to plant it, you should be careful.|`|AA10097817	Some type of orchid?
vEsSIGfYaa	No, do not apply anything.  That blob of sap is the equivalent of your blood forming a clot and scab which acts to seal and protect the wound from infection.<br>  <br>  IF the sap has covered the entire wound then nothing else needs to be done.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, IF the sap "scab" is not fully covering the wound, I use a clean spoon or knife to gently "spread" the sap over the entire exposed area of the wound, and with time it will "set up," protecting the wound.|`|pDKm9Wmgaa	If you apply anything over the sap, you will be trapping bacteria and fungus in the wound. Trees will heal, but it takes far longer than an animal heals. Leave it alone and it will be ok.
pcEJMHPMaa	There are ones that are white and ones that are clear.not only do you not have to see the contents,but they decompose quicker in black bags because black is a heat conducter.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Its cheaper to make plastic when you can just mix all the recycled plastic and other stuff in together to make the bags.|`|o96BXmSYaa	Black bags tend to be sturdier than the regular white kitchen bags.

uBtQuK8haa	That's not just a fan, it's the compressor unit.  It's not something the average homeowner can do.  Your best bet would be to get 3 free estimates and go from there.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that replacing the older unit with a high energy efficient unit will cut down on your electrical cost and the unit will eventually pay for itself.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	A good cleaning and servicing may keep yours going, the fact that it gushes water means its working well. That water is the moisture in the air that is being removed by the cold evaporator. If no water came out then there would be issues. Also depending on its age and the refrigerant it uses you may have to replace the evaporator (in your attic) anyway due to incompatible oils.
J6Ksn0P7aa	Does it have a cleaning cycle?  Mine does, and we use bleach for the load, this is recommended for the health of the washer.  You can also use vinegar in the rinse.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  When I got mine I thought that the bleach went in the slot for the fabric softner, I ran the load and could not understand why the rags smelled like bleach.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	You can easily grow your own apple trees from seeds, although it does take a lot of time for your trees to mature and produce an edible crop of fruit. If you plant a small apple tree, it will take about three to four years for the tree to mature and start to bear fruit. Growing apple trees from seeds will take upwards of ten years before your trees will produce a edible crop.<br>  <br>  Apple seeds need to be started indoors. This can be done in one of two ways: you can place some apple seeds into a paper towel. Fold the paper towel over into a small square. Keep the paper towel wet, and place it in your refrigerator. Keep checking the seeds and keeping them moist. In a week or so, your apple seeds will sprout. They are now ready to plant outside. Or, you can use a Styrofoam cup filled with potting soil to start your seeds. Dig a shallow hole in the middle of the potting soil and plant the apple seeds there. Set the container on a sunny windowsill and keep the soil moistened. In a week or so, the apple seeds will sprout. They will then be ready to plant outside.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/24824/how_to_plant_and_grow_apple_trees_from.html?cat=22" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|03sLrNPCaa	One seed, one tree.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	Only 1 if it works|`|5shqstYraa	one good one
