Diodes are typically about 0.7 Volts, so two would make a 1.4 Volt reduction.<br>  <br>  Another option is to put a 1.5 Volt Zener diode in series with the circuit.<br>  <br>  This is the simple answer, but also don't forget to consider the power rating of the diodes.  I'm assuming the LED current isn't that high though.<br>  <br>  (I usually answer math questions, but I'm a EE, and this one happened to catch my eye)

The transport cost would offset whatever difference you gained by buying it in US. Well to answer your question, obviously by air only. Even if we assume it will cost a minimum of 5 US D per Kg, it is going to be a costly affair. Transport by sea may be cheaper but the TV may not be in one piece when it touches the Mumbai harbour. And the time. May be three to four weeks. Your most popular teleserial or program might end before you get your TV installed in India. I do not have to tell you that commercial products and home applicances cannot be brought as part of your baggage when you travel and it is to be sent only in freight carriers.<br>  <br>  As for the quality, All popular brands are available in India at affordable prices. All leading brands of TV come are the of same standard and it does not matter where you buy.<br>  <br>  Buy one here. Give that one to a friend or sell it. When you cannot make profit, keep the losses to the minimum. You can install it in a charitable home for aged in US and get their blessings whenever they see it.<br>  <br>  By the way what is lcd tv? Does it come with any narcotic or psychotropic substance? Better be careful, buddy.
6qVBAl45aa	Sounds liek you have some bad problems with your PS3.. cant say mien are anywhere near as bad as that.. but as small problems as they are they are annoying.. my PS3 freezes from time to time which is annoying especially when im mid game play. also some games cause replying to messages (on the PSN) and other things to run really slow which is just painful! not to mention many games having real troubles with online play and MGO servers being full of lag recently but thats not the PS3 itself. anyway one annoying thing i have at the moment is since i got my PS3 mediaboard (the big keyboard you can get) i cant view my PSN and reply to messages while in a game online especially on Metal Gear Online (MGO). once i press the PS button rather then seeing the PSN i see the options (quit game, turn off controller, turn off system etc..) the options you usually get when holding the PS button down rather then just pressing it once.  last night i had the problem that i used to get on my PS1 years ago.. i got the flashing disc and "?" which confused me due to the fact i dont take the disc out that often (im a huge MGO fan/player lol) and when i do i put it straight into the case which should mean there are NO scratches or anything. i havnt looked at what the problem with that is yet but i hope its nothing like yours did. i know this doesnt help much sorry about that lol.<br>  James|`|wzA4GcWKaa	i think some games does that to the ps3 like BATTLEFIELD BAD COMPANY  its a good game but freezes all the time why?don't know my friends have the same problem with it i think its just some games not your ps3

ad2faoKcaa	There are two ways you can go about this depending on your recorders inputs. Some recorders have both Component inputs, and Composite inputs. Getting it hooked up with the composite video is pretty self explanatory. You just use the A/V out on the PS3 (that's included with every PS3) and hook it into one of the composite inputs on the DVD recorder, and then simply have video go back out to your TV.<br>  <br>  Component is a little different, but still the same in principle. You may think, "Just go out with component to the recorder and back to the TV from the recorder". Yes, it can be this simple, but only if your not outputting a high def signal through the component video. I'd say 99-100% of the DVD recorders on the market today will not accept a HD signal through component, so if you try and do so you will not get a picture. In order to get any picture for recording, you need to make sure that your outputting 480i out from the PS3. (it might still work with output of 480p if your recorder can downscale it, but you will only get a 480i recorded video.)<br>  <br>  NOTE: You may also be able to do with with s-video as well, but this requires extra cables (you would need to buy the s-video A/V cables specifically for the PS3) and I am not sure how many recorders have s-video in for recording.<br>  <br>  NOTE #2: The PS3 is incapable of outputting simultaneously through HDMI and the A/V outputs. There has been people claiming their PS3 can do it, but don't count on it working. If that does work, then this will enable you to play with your HDTV via the HDMI cable, and record in SD via the composite video. Since I am not sure how this would work, you still may have to play in SD outputting over HDMi and composite video.

The Insignia house brand is made for BB by several different Asian manufacturers including (depending on model) Syntax-Brillian and Funai, the company that also makes Sylvania, RCA, Emerson and several other "junk" brands.

If you really can't afford more and simply must have a 42", I'd suggest you shop around a bit. $800 isn't really that spectacular a deal for a 42" LCD set these days, especially for an off brand, and I'd about guarantee that with a little looking around, you'll find something much better than the Insignia for around the same price.<br>  <br>  Any particular reason for avoiding plasma?

qFAPqHrwaa	Well... the ipod touch and the iphone are basically the same except that with the iphone you can use it as a phone. You can only get the iphone with a contract which means that if you buy it in stores, you are paying about $199 and you are stuck with it for about 3 years. You can find places where you can get the iphone without a contract but it wouldnt be in major stores. You may find iphones without contracts at the little electronic stands in the malls or you can get it online at websites such as ebay (thats where i got mine). The ipod touch as i said before is almost like the iphone but is just an ipod. <br>  <br>  I think that the ipod touch is the best ipod out of all of them. The price tag is a bit bigger on the ipod touch, but its so worth it. On the ipod touch you can surf the web and watch youtube vids as long as you are connected to wi-fi, you can also download apps, play lots of games, watch downloaded videos, and of course, listen to music. You can find any ipod in stores like walmart and best buy, you can even buy them online. Hope This Helps!!

Plug your PS3 and computer into the HDMI inputs in and take an HDMI cord and plug it into the HDMI out on the receiver to the television.  <br>  <br>  This is the proper connection for what you want.|`|0wTOMifKaa	Plog the PS3 DVD player sky etc.. whatever you have all into an amplifier is the way to go.<br>  <br>  Then have one hdmi cable from that to the TV and of course the speakers plug into the amplifier as well.<br>  <br>  It's a lot simpler and then you just change the input on the amp and it switches it all over to the correct device.|`|SwYRiWIdaa	le tette di qll roia de tomare

C5EPlZ8saa	Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent a number from showing on a detailed bill, nor in the Usage section on MyVerizon. It's a requirement to make the call detail available for any call made/received. If they blocked there number with *67 before calling you, that number would appear as unavailable on the bill. But that would only work for calls, not texts.|`|b1c1cfae4e69dbb558dcec1bac53da19aa	I used to work for verizon and there is no way to block a certain phone number from your usage.  You wont get the messages and minutes used off your bill either because they are explaining to you how your minutes and messages were used for that month.  That is automatically generated when they print the bills from a third party company, whether it is a detailed bill or quick summary, any numbers that go off your phone text/call are going to be generated on it. As a perk vz customers they allow people to see detailed bills including detailed numbers both called and texted.  So sorry to say, but unless they changed the policy in a few months, then I dont know of any way around it only not talking/texting that number so it doesn't show up on your bill.

They can supply a network unlocking code for you. If they do not hold it on their systems they will be able to request this from the phone manufacturer.<br>  I cannot comment on T-Mobile, but for my own network, Vodafone (UK) the <br>  unlocking code is provided free so long as you have had the phone 12 months or longer. If under 12 months the charge is ￡19.99.<br>  <br>  You should speak to T-Mobile and find out where you stand on this matter.<br>  <br>  NB: I would tend to be wary of third party services offering to unlock phones as entering the wrong code may permanently lock your phone to your current network.|`|ssdTfrImaa	you can do everything online at home and for pretty cheap at sites such as <a href="http://www.cellphoneunlock.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.cellphoneunlock.net</a> or <a href="http://www.cellunlocker.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.cellunlocker.net</a> if you need to unlock your tmobile usa phone, i know they unlock all models like blackberry, motorola, sony ericsson, g1 phone etc..<br>  <br>  hope that helps
8iCWSfAMaa	After noticing on their website that for any subscription plan they accept credit cards (VISA, Master Card, Discover, AMEX) and PayPal, I went through the checkout process for my order, only to notice that I am only able to pay through MoneyGram for my order.<br>  <br>  I emailed them about this. Below is their response:<br>  <br>  Dear customer,<br>  <br>  I am sorry for this inconvenience. Unfortunately, due to high rate of fraudulent activity recently we decided not to accept credit cards and PayPal from ALL buyers except Canadians (our company is located in (Canada). We have suffered loses of 500.000 CAD during 6 months due to fraudulent activity associated with credit cards and PayPal. Swindlers steal credit cards and PayPal accounts and use them to pay for merchandise. Afterwards we are obliged to refund the money to the credit card and PayPal accounts` holders. So, we lose money twice: when sending merchandise to swindlers and when returning the money to the true holders of credit cards and PayPal accounts. Being located in Canada we are able to keep an eye on all purchases made by Canadian citizens and return a parcel if it was shipped to a customer. We are unable to do this if a package was shipped to a different country (including the USA). We have made this difficult decision not long ago and have not changed the FAQ section. Our web designer will update the FAQ section soon. I am very sorry for the time you spent on us but you should understand us: we do not<br>  want to become bankrupts as many developing companies. For citizens of other countries we accept only Money Gram.<br>  <br>  If you have any question feel free to email them to me and I will do my<br>  best to respond back as soon as possible!<br>  Customer Loyalty Team<br>  Cherows, Inc.<br>  <br>  Avoid this website at all costs.<br>  <br>  Also, see here: <a href="http://forum.blu-ray.com/showthread.php?t=88683" rel="nofollow">http://forum.blu-ray.com/showthread.php?...</a><br>  <br>  Apparently, their area code isn't even from Canada.

After "creating" and account and log-in I proceeded to check out.  Looking for some secure encryption it never happened.  My total was $209 + $21 shipping.  To a lot of people that is a freaking great deal.<br>  <br>  However, if something is too good to be true it is.  This isn't a phishing site per se but it is a big scam site.  After proceeding through checkout it states that we will email you the details on how to process your payment.<br>  <br>  Also if you read on their FAQs it states it takes 5-7 days to verify the "money".  This clued me in on other scams that are being run where they send you a link to some semi-legit place and tell you to basically send them a money order.  By the time you realize it is all a scam it is too late because they cashed your money order already and your S.O.L.<br>  <br>  Remember if any online establishment asks you send them money order and there is no such thing as a secure encryption during check out it is 100% a scam site and it is just luring people in thinking it is a great deal i'll try it out.  This will probably go for a few weeks then the site will disappear and change names to promote the same things.<br>  <br>  Please be careful where you buy from and be cautious of where you purchase from especially online.|`|gBAE3hGyaa	I ordered 10 Asus Netbooks for $100 less than Amazon was selling them for.

BMConIedaa	Here's Marth's FAQ posted on GameFAQs:<br>  <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/file/928518/52504" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/file...</a><br>  <br>  Marth has been toned down a little bit since Melee.  One example of this is neutral-special attack.  In Melee, he swung his sword overhead in a fashion similar to his forward-smash.  In Brawl, his neutral-special attack is now a straight-forward thrust that isn't as useful when opponents are attacking from above.<br>  <br>  The key to using Marth is spacing.  His sword has a "sweet spot" near the tip.  If you can nail your foes with it, you will do more damage and knock them back further.  Also, timing and tactically applying his down-special, a counter-attack, can be crucial, however using it too much may make you predictable.  Using his side-special combo is tricky, but you may find it is a better recovery move than his up-special, which is neither very powerful as an attack, nor very versatile as a recovery move.<br>  <br>  But you generally want to use about 20% special attacks, 80% regular attacks and combos.|`|gBkBZNJOaa	my friend kaylif (kdogg on brawl) uses marth. if you wanna play online i can tell him to join and you can learn from him. here's what i know about marth from my experience playing as him (i used to main him) and watching kaylif.<br>  <br>  marth is better played as an aggresive character. instead of running straight in to attack try coming in with a fair (forward air. i'll be using these abbreviations. get used to it. bair. back air. dair. down air. you get the point) to keep your enemy at a distance and prevent getting grabbed. his fair is his best move but don't spam it cuz that's lame. his down tilt (duck and a) is good for keeping your enemy from running straight at you. if you're facing an overly aggresive oponent, shield grabbing and using his down b are good defensive tactics. his grabs have little knockback but are good for comboing off of. <br>  <br>  e-mail me with your code. i'll train you. as for not getting edgegrabbed... the best defense against that is not getting hit off the stage in the first place.|`|2ZLvuK4haa	i dont like marth but i have snake from metal gear solid and i am solid  and never stand still it could cost u the match (online) unless the attacks are still have u got wi fi if u have can i have you friend code|`|DaAJrdyLaa	I use his dancing blade attack very often.(it takes a while to master the different combos though)|`|vPW7S8UZaa	i dont really like marth but ike is better...ike is more powerful, maybe runs faster...im not good at marth...

cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	I think that all polaroid cameras are not worth it.<br>  try canon, nikon, or samsung<br>  <br>  All of the major brands are good. Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......<br>  <br>  The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands. If possible, take some pictures in the store to check the quality of the pictures.<br>  I can only give a suggestion of what to look for in a new digital camera.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  my suggestion<br>  go to this link for help <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-buying-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-b...</a>|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	My opinion is why do you buy Polaroid when they do Not make cameras anymore?

TbTO5SXlaa	If your goal is making large prints then you need to do the following:<br>  <br>  1) Always shoot at your camera's highest resolution.<br>  2) Always use the lowest ISO setting.<br>  3) Always shoot at between f5.6 to f11 - most lenses perform best at these apertures.<br>  4) Always use a tripod or firm support.<br>  5) Make certain your focus is perfect.<br>  6) Use the camera's self-timer to release the shutter.<br>  <br>  Any defect in your original file, no matter how small, will be magnified as you increase the print size.<br>  <br>  To determine the maximum print size, divide the resolution by 300. 300 refers to the dpi (dots per inch) you'll want to print at for maximum quality.<br>  <br>  Suppose your camera's maximum resolution is 4416 x 3312. Divide both by 300 and you get a print size of 11.04 x 14.72 so you can print at 11 x 14. If you took the same picture at a low resolution, say 640 x 480 your print size would be 1.6 x 2.1 using 300dpi.<br>  <br>  Since viewing distance is also a consideration, you can always reduce your dpi to 200. Again, using the high resolution from our first example, at 200dpi you can print at 16.56 x 22.08 - a 16 x 20 print. Since your viewing distance will be farther away from the 11 x 14, your 16 x 20 should look just fine.<br>  <br>  Billboards, meant to be viewed from a couple of hundred feet, are usually printed at between 30 to 40dpi.|`|WOiH4CGvaa	I have a 44" printer, I routinely print images, at 36" x 52", taken with a full frame, Canon 5D, with a 12.8 MP, 4,368 x 2,912 pixel sensor.

R4WX5twzaa	No, you have to use iTunes to put music on your iPod. However, that doesn't mean that you have to download all your music from iTunes. What I do is I have the normal "My Music" folder on my PC full of all the music I could ever want (ripped from CDs, downloaded, etc), and when I want to put music on my iPod, I plug it into my computer, open iTunes, then drag the music that I want from the "My Music" folder and drop it into iTunes. The music is never stored in the iTunes software, only on my iPod, and I still get whatever songs I want without having to pay for them through iTunes.|`|4818d65e08b64762be5f48d1d6b7ea82aa	No.<br>  <br>  iTunes.

RCbtRF4xaa	The 2nd generation iPod Touch is an almost perfect device. It combines top-notch video/audio, world-class UI, great casual gaming, hundrets of apps, and full access to the Internet into a single, beautiful package. To sum it up neatly: Untouchable. Well -- almost. It has one big flaw if you have invested in accessories: it may not be compatible with them, as Apple has changed the iPod connector pin-out (again). With those reservations, I recommend the Touch to anyone.<br>  <br>  + great display <br>  + good audio <br>  + gesture-based interface <br>  + accelerometer for controls <br>  + great integration with your music library (via iTunes) <br>  + long battery life <br>  + wireless music store <br>  + wireless App store (killer feature) <br>  + Speaker for gaming <br>  + Mail, Calendar and Address book with Push <br>  + WiFi Internet (killer feature) <br>  + Remote App (free) for your PC/Mac's iTunes/AppleTV <br>  + SDK freely available for anyone <br>  + Microphone and remote support <br>  + Nike + iPod without dongle<br>  <br>  Apple iPod touch 16 GB (2nd Generation)<br>  16 GB capacity for 3,500 songs, 10,000 photos, or 20 hours of video <br>  Up to 36 hours of music playback or 6 hours of video playback when fully charged <br>  3.5-inch widescreen multi-touch display with 480-by-320-pixel resolution <br>  Supported audio formats: AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV; supported video formats: H.264, MPEG-4; supported image file types: JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, PSD (Mac only), and PNG<br>  <br>  Price: $284.95 <br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPod-touch-2nd-Generation/dp/B001FA1NZU/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235574173&sr=1-3&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPod-touch-2...</a>|`|BAAehgWlaa	Ipod Touch<br>  <br>  it's my 2nd time to answer this kind of question|`|qFAPqHrwaa	Depends on what you like.

2728dfb022c14792863b78aafcfd0d23aa	If you mean a game that you play on your computer, no, you can't add it to your iPod.  iPod's use different kinds of hardware and software than a computer.  Games and other programs have to be written specifically for the iPod, so you would have to get the game from the iTunes store.|`|PdmaKwhNaa	You can drag and drop .ipa files and .app maps into iTunes.
KLL0Acrwaa	When she says "fixed lens" what she means is that it's not a zoom lens, but instead a lens with a fixed focal length--you only get one view and have to change position to get a different view (rather than zooming).<br>  <br>  The 200mm f/2.8 is an excellent lens for portraits and you would get great photos.  However, in a smaller area like a small room, you might not be able to step back enough to get certain kinds of photos, like full-length portraits or group photos.<br>  <br>  Hence, that's why she recommended looking at the 24-70mm, which has a wider view and can zoom (so you don't have to step back or step closer).<br>  <br>  If you really like the 200mm f/2.8 and have thought about how you'd use it, then it's a great choice.  But if you haven't thought about how you'd use it or how often you'd use it, take a moment to consider what kinds of photos you want to get, the types of locations you're taking the photos, and when/where you'd be using the lens.  This will help you to decide what lens is right for you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You're confusing focusing with zooming, apparently.  A fixed focal length lens has only 1 view, and to change the view, you have to physically move closer or physically move back.  But with a 200mm lens, your view is very narrow, so you might not be able to step back far enough if you want a wider shot.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Although the lens is an important part of good photography, no lens can "... get clear and professional photos  ..."  UNLESS you are a skilled photographer. Any problems you now have using whatever lens you're using will not be magically cured by a new lens.<br>  <br>  Before you buy any lens I suggest buying this book: "David Busch's Quick Snap Guide to Digital SLR Lenses" by (surprise) David Busch.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dbusch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dbusch.com/</a><br>  <br>  Since you obviously don't know the difference between a zoom lens and a fixed focal length lens you are likely to be taken advantage of by some commission-driven sales associate. I found the 200mm lens you mentioned at B&H for $695.00 and the 24-70mm for $1,190.00. Of course the sales associate wants to sell you the 24-70mm lens.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com</a><br>  <br>  The problem with using a 200mm lens for people pictures, especially head shots, is it tends to compress facial features. Very unflattering.<br>  <br>  So buy the book I suggested and educate yourself before venturing out to spend your money.

Though there are no subscription or additional charges, when an incoming call is diverted from your number to another, you'll be charged as if you're making an outgoing call to it, according to your tariff.

lebKMTaQaa	I sell a lot on ebay (I actually run a business on there, as well as a personnel account). Your best bet is to sell the machine separately and the sell your games in 2-3 set packs. You will make more money this way. When you put it all together, people tend to look at it as a discount bundle or something. <br>  <br>  You should get $350-$400 (maybe more) for just the system, provided you have the box and all the manuals (if not, maybe a little less) and, with games, that varies quite a lot. Games like Resistance 2 and Vegas 2 should pull in pretty good money ($45 for R2, 30 for V2), but Assassin's creed and Warhawk not so much (10-20 buck, maybe).<br>  <br>  All together, you should be able to walk away with about $550, give or take!

RCbtRF4xaa	I purchased the Canon SD890IS about a month ago, after my Olympus Stylist 400 was stolen. I read many reviews, but I have had a Canon 35mm camera for years, and know its reputation. This camera does not disappoint. <br>  I find it takes great pictures, and so far the image stabilization feature has given me excellent and sharp pictures, even at low light levels. <br>  The camera has many more features than I will ever use, but I particularly like the large screen and the optical viewfinder.<br>  <br>  Canon PowerShot SD890IS 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom<br>  price: $194.46 + $5.49 shipping<br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD890IS-Digital-Stabilized/dp/B0015DPJMK/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1235574452&sr=1-11&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that help.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	canon sd1100<br>  <br>  All of the major brands are good. Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......<br>  <br>  The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands. If possible, take some pictures in the store to check the quality of the pictures.<br>  I can only give a suggestion of what to look for in a new digital camera.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  my suggestion<br>  go to this link for help <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-buying-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-b...</a>|`|yoVBjn8baa	There are so many cameras out there.  Some points to keep in mind when making a decision are:<br>  <br>  1) Fair amount of megapixels (6 or more)<br>  2) Price<br>  3) Optical Zoom (3-4x or more)<br>  4) Battery (make sure it comes with a rechargeable battery) and a charger<br>  5) Make sure it takes SD cards.

The ps3 doesn't output in vga format anyhow.    A 3rd party could make a cable that either connects to the ps3's A/V out or hdmi out, and has a vga connector on the other end, but that will not turn the output into a VGA signal. It would still be either digital (HDMI), YPbPr (component) or standard A/V (composite). The latter two are analog signals but they are nothing like a VGA signal and would be read as gibberish by a VGA monitor.    There are converters that can turn an analog composite or component signal into VGA. They run from $50 to $100. They can't turn an HDCP-encrypted signal into anything, though. None of them are HDCP-compliant, so even if they have an HDMI input, they would do no good for a digital output. You would have to use component cables to get a hi-res output.

RN6HMF7Waa	Unfortunately a ruined LCD screen on a camera is not fixable without extreme knowledge of what you're doing. I would suggest taking it to the shop or calling the company if it's under warranty.  They may be able to fix it for nothing. If it costs anything at all to get it repaired, just buy a new one. Cameras are unbelievable now-a-days and are fairly inexpensive.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	i'm in the USA, but i'm sure you can find a number in your user manual. don't try to fix it, you'll void the warranty  http://www.olympus.co.uk/customersupport...|`|IdtzdpqGaa	most cameras allow the screen to be replaced, depending on your skill level will determine whether or not you can do it yourself or you need to take it to someone.  shop around, different shops vary wildly on there prices|`|AA12370001	time for a new camera.  they are so cheap its not worth fixing.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	You're better off buying a new one.  Unless you picked up an extended warranty, it's rarely cost effective to repair small personal electronics. You can probably recoup some of your costs by selling the broken one on eBay, since the screen doesn't effect the actual picture taking.  Or you can just use your viewfinder.

If so then the problem might be that the left stick was tilted when the controller turned on and you accidentally set the stick default somewhere else. So when the stick rests in the middle the game is reading that as going left and up. If that happens just turn off your controller and turn it back on, making sure that none of the sticks are tilted. That will reset the controller.<br>  <br>  If not then it's time for a new controller.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Try buying a new a controller and then see if its the console or the controller.

Edit: For the person who said it didn't support flash, you're wrong. It may not be the latest version but you can play a good selection of games and there are even some dedicated sites that I listed below, along with proof.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Ch...  ''As the browser supports Flash, users have the ability to interact with Flash-based software using the Wii Remote. As a result, several websites have been created or expanded to gather Wii-friendly Internet games. However, the Flash SDK that is offered to developers only supports technologies up to Flash Player version 7. Due to this limitation, any website that requires a newer version of Flash Player will not operate properly. This is important as many media-heavy websites require the use of Flash 8 or higher. Windows Media Player and Real Video content at this point are also incompatible with the Internet Channel.''|`|F8LYdCdfaa	i think you can attac ds's but im pretty sure you cant  the wii shop channel you can buy games from other systems without using a disc|`|3pLv7KBvaa	those are only it the rest come form the VC wii shop channel. where you need tro get a classic controller and gamecube controller.    gamecube games- to play gamecube on wii    wii controller- you have options on the back of the game cover sometimes it can be used by classic controller or gamecube, wiiremote or wiiremote and nunchuk, etc...    classic controller- to play on vc from wii shop  not sure wiiware though.|`|CjuRYxHIaa	no sorry. just wii and gamecube. even if you had internet on it, you cant play flash games. sorry|`|GB9JPNukaa	If u have the internet channel than u can go 2 the Wii section of Miniclip and play the games there.

4IEYyJmgaa	Hi..<br>  I spent 3 hours last week to get my first gen iphone working again-<br>  What jailbreak program or method are you using? Ziphone did not work for me.<br>  Ok this is what finally worked for me- I think there is a file in itunes or in your pc that doesnt let pwn correctly function.<br>  I assume you do not wan to uninstall itunes completely so...<br>  Go to another pc (im on a mac) that you have never backed your phone too; or set up another profile or user on your  pc. Install a new itunes, it can be the latest version. Download the last firmware, and baseband files. Do a master reset using ITunes first. This should reset the iphone, now pwn again the firmware. Once done go to itunes as instructed. The phone should work now; now go back to your original itunes and reload everything you had, DO NOT reset from your backup. Good luck! And please send me Good karma regardless; as I dont do this for the points, but to help someone! Be well!|`|4cMuedpWaa	Your best and fastest option is to jailbreak it again.

9mTctb7jaa	It has been done for at least 30 years. To be compatible with normal video processing equipment, it takes advantage of NTSC frame being composed of 2 interleaved fields. To make 3D, the fields are actually two separate views.  The only practical way to view is with computer type virtual reality glasses so that field one is displayed to the left eye and field two is displayed on the right eye. I think some video games can do this as well.  It has half the resolution of SD video but the stereo effect compensates by giving depth of view.

I read all the reviews before I bought it and all the problems that people were writing about it were simple fixes and mostly caused by "human error". This is a great phone for texters who aren't either "really tech savvy" or "don't need all that the iPhone gives". My 1 complaint is that, with all the phone can do: text, video, internet, camera, camcorder, it does wear the battery out after a full day of using.On the plus side, it only takes 2 hours and the battery is fully charged again. I switched from a Blackberry and while the Quickfire is not as sophisticated as the blackberry, it does what it was made to do as well as it can do it.|`|dk360f3Iaa	i havent had the best experiences with it.<br>  <br>  i got my first quickfire on christmas and i only had it for one week. i had to exchange it because the phone wouldnt let me IM. i got a new one that i had for a month and i had to exchange that because one day i put it on the charger and it just wouldnt charge for no apparent reason. i'm on my third quickfire for christmas and this one seems to be working fine so far. but those are just my personal experiences with the phone.<br>  <br>  i suppose the quickfire is an okay phone if you just want simple texting, picture messaging, IMing, and dont mind having a really lousy camera.<br>  <br>  the reception is good, the sound quality is good, and battery life is a little short-lasting, but not too bad.<br>  <br>  the major downfall with this phone is definitely the touch screen. a lot of people have complained about the touch screen being non-responsive. i've personally never had this problem with any of the three quickfires that i've had. though, i do find that if you tap the touch screen very lightly, it works better. so the touch screen is okay, but dont expect anything like the iphone.|`|7AeFGx12aa	I did hear yesterday that the Quickfire has been discontinued. My daughter has the phone and loves it though. I called AT&T yesterday and asked if it's been DC'd and they wouldn't tell me.
KJLFVjoraa	Yes it needs an aerial.|`|2uPEty21aa	The fact that you don't watch it is immaterial, if you have equipment capable of receiving a TV signal you have to have a licence.    And yes, you do need an aerial.    Edit:  You still seem to miss the point, the equipment is still capable of receiving a TV signal.  If you kept it in the loft and never plugged it in you might possibly get away with it.  But in order to use it for gaming you need to plug it in.    You should also be aware that the retailer supplying your TV is legally obliged to supply your name and address to the licencing authority.|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	As soon as you purchase a new "television" your name and address goes to the "tv licencing dept".  Then they will then look for a current tv licence.  Yes you do need a tv aerial for freeview.|`|HP1pToMOaa	I'm afraid everyone is right apart from you. The Licensing people assume that if you have a TV you will receive a signal and watch it. This has been discussed many times both here and elsewhere.

The law states that you must have a TV licence "... for any device that is capable of receiving broadcast television programmes".    The key word is 'capable'.  Your TV is capable of receiving TV broadcasts, if it had an aerial plugged in.  Therefore, you need a licence, whether you agree with the law or not.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	aerial or not you still have to have a tv license, and of course you need an aerial to receive a tv signal

HekFanRvaa	UPS is for computers. And a PS3 is considered a computer. It should work but it is not really unlimited. The purpose of the UPS is to prevent sudden shutdown in case of power outage. So that you will be able to save your data and shutdown your computer properly to prevent errors and data corruption during sudden outage. UPS only lasts between 15mins to an hour or maybe longer depending on the power consumption of your computer. UPS are not like generators that you can use during the entire power outage. When the power goes out, your computer stays on and what normally people do is not to stay on but save files and shut down properly or wait until the back up generators stabilize and kicks in and then switch over. You don't stay on UPS for too long. It's only meant to give you a stable power supply until an alternative power supply (ie, generators) is in service.|`|AA10459818	most ups have computer controlled functions that non windows os wont be able to control.

Best thing to do is check your reception if it freezes all the time then re-align or replace it.|`|z8jYprWkaa	Yes - it's almost essential to have it pointing at the transmitter otherwise you won't get all of those stations you never knew you wanted to watch in the first place!<br>  Having it properly aligned will prevent picture break-up and sound noises, so yes - do try and get it sorted.|`|qGfAlDd2aa	It can be, but it's not super critical.  As long as you are getting solid reception, it's good enough.

RMplfgjHaa	Eventually, the answer is yes.  Initially, one can expect to see Wi-Fi services converged with cellular devices.  The first GSM/WiMAX device was recently introduced into Russia.  This device operates on the carrier's WiMAX system when on its network and roams to GSM on other carrier's systems.  <br>                         This early foray will teach both the fixed and mobile wireless industries a great deal about technological co-existence.  In the US, T-Mobile began trials of a cellular/Wi-Fi fixed-mobile convergence handset in the Pacific Northwest.  A number of other firms have dual-mode phones in the market place, however, adoption has been slow.  T-Mobile is using a Nokia handset.  Reference designs for PC-Card form factor Wi MAX cards are already in the market place from a number of different firms.  The short answer is that Wi MAX on your phone is just around the corner.
Hiasgb75aa	If your computer has AV Ports it should work.|`|HekFanRvaa	For 2 important reasons, you cannot use it for PS3:<br>  <br>  1. It is only VGA, meaning it is analog. PS3 signals are digital. To transmit digital signal, you would need at least a DVI (digital video interface) port. Newer monitors have HDMI port which is the best.<br>  <br>  2. It is not HDCP compliant. Some monitors may have DVI ports but does necessarily mean you can use with PS3 unless they are HDCP-compliant. Blu-ray technology requires HDCP compliant monitors.

noU2uKEoaa	The reason phones are locked in the first place is to allow the networks to sell them at a cheaper price and therefore make the purchase of one more attractive. With a locked phone you can only use the sim card of the supplying network. If this was not the case then networks would be selling subsidised handsets and losing revenue as any network sim could be used.<br>  You will have to contact T-Mobile and request an unlocking code. They will advise if a charge is applicable. In many cases if the prepay phone was purchased over 12 months ago the charge can be waived.<br>  If you use a third party service ( such as a high street store or online service) you are still going to be charged. Also you risk permanently locking your phone to your current network if the wrong code is issued<br>  Locking codes are introduced at the point of manufacture at the request of the networks. Each phone has a unique unlocking code which is tied in with the serial number (IMEI) and it is not possible to guess or " work out " an unlocking code, despite what many people think.<br>  Your safest bet is to contact T - Mobile.

KLL0Acrwaa	The D40 is still being sold and hasn't yet been replaced.<br>  <br>  There are still stocks of the D40x and they haven't been depleted; the same is true for the D80.  The D40x was replaced by the D60; the D80 was replaced by the D90.  However, since there are still unsold cameras, you may still see ads as camera stores try to get rid of their stocks.<br>  <br>  And of course, the D60 is still being sold and hasn't been replaced.<br>  <br>  However, in the case of the D200, it has been replaced by the much, much better D300.  The D200 came out in November 2005, making it much older than all the other cameras you list.<br>  <br>  Hence, because the D200 is much older, and because it has been replaced, there are really no stocks of new D200 to market.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	they only market the big sellers|`|lp9jwGmQaa	D200 was produced in smaller quantities than the D40x/D80.

I used to install these systems when I worked for a radio shop.  We set up several companies with GPS tracking for their vehicles.  <br>  Don't expect real-time tracking like the special effects you see in the movies.  It can be done but would be very expensive.  Depending on your needs, you normally receive a vehicles location every 10 to 30 minutes.  You can also poll a vehicle any time you want to see where it is if the system is between polls for that particular vehicle.|`|Wm7f02DDaa	<a href="http://www.bluewatersecurityprofessionals.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluewatersecurityprofessional...</a> has trackers you can view online|`|UCzHy3N5aa	There is a gps device you can use to track a vehicle or anything else that moves or is likely to be moved or stolen.

CGfEZV45aa	you could use a full screen program on a multi monitor setup, but there are some bugs involved with that, like cursor tracking between two monitors. some developers release patches to allow multi monitor gameplay though, but not all of them. I do know for a fact that the PC version of bioshock is capable of being  played at a panoramic resolution (that's your setup). what I would do is compile a short list of racing games that you want to play, then check each one for multi monitor compatibility or if it has patches that enabled multi monitor game play.

IvkZNs0caa	If they are photographic prints (not digital, ink jet or similar prints) the paper is designed to be "wet processed".  The pictures can usually be unstuck by rewashing them in a bath of 60 to 75 degree water with a small amount of good detergent such as Ivory dish detergent (about 1/2 teaspoon to a gallon of water) added.  You will need to let them soak long enough for the paper to absorb  water and then gently separate them.  Then place them FACE UP on a terry cloth or other soft towel and let them air dry.  <br>  <br>  The pictures may curl as they are drying but that can usually be corrected by placing the FULLY DRIED photos face down on a clean surface such as a glass table top and placing a heavy weight on top of them for a day or two.<br>  <br>  I would test this on a small number of less important photos to make sure it works okay for the specific type of photos you are attempting to separate.<br>  <br>  HTH.  Good Luck.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	put them in a dry place<br>  or maybe use a hair dryer<br>  they may separate when you dry them out|`|qUiuRDs6aa	get a bowl of steaming water and hold them just above it whilst slowly prising apart, the steam should seperate them, if it does not work, go to a photo shop and queary with them. keep them in albums always :)|`|5ab21e250543771adf61c9be4b6e06a8aa	put powder in a bag and place the photos in the bag the powder should soak up the humdity
eVptHOOBaa	One thing I could tell you for sure:<br>  - D80 with a good solid performing lens will serve you better than D90 with a cheap and flimsy lens.<br>  <br>  I have a D80, and it's doing great! While D90 has lots more bells and whistles, and maybe a slightly better image processing and auto exposure metering, and largely useless video function, plus a rarely needed live view... But all of that would be overshadowed by the quality of glass. Because no camera will capture an image better than produced by a lens. Overall, I think the two bodies are nearly identical as far as quality and primary function, so better glass will determine the final quality.<br>  <br>  LEM.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	go to kenrockwell.com<br>  he knows a lot more than I do
becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	HD ready means it has no Tuner, so you need a set-top box.  Full HD is more of a marketing term and means the TV is a 1080p TV (versus 720p).|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	I've owned one of each.    HD Ready means it has no HD Tuner.  So you can't receive HDTV over the air through an antenna, unless you have a separate HD Tuner.  This was done on earlier HDTVs because the cost of the built-in tuner would add $500 or $600 to the price.  And considering most people get their TV from cable or satellite, it was an unnecessary expense in most cases.     A full HDTV means it comes complete with built-in tuner.    Basically, if you get your HDTV signals from cable or satellite, the HD Ready TV will get the signal fed to it from the cable or satellite box.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	"all HD TVs come with freeview built-in."    I suspect you are in the UK.   This is not true for the US market.    When HDTV antenna signals were first starting out in the US - there was a lawsuit to try and force to use a different signal standard.  If someone bought a HDTV for the 1-2 only available HD stations, it could stop working if the lawsuit forced the antenna signals to change.    So TV makers started making televisions w/o antenna tuners.  Early adopters could later buy a separate box that you use with an antenna to get free HDTV after the standard was settled.    They discovered millions of people never use an antenna so they have continued making these sets and the price is about $100 cheaper.|`|AA10986277	HD Ready uasually means that the telly is 720i or 720p which is half full HD. Full HD = 480i, 480p, 720i, 720p, 1080i and 1080p.    Tv guy ( the guy that answered your question first) was telling you a lie all HD TVs come with freeview built-in. so any HD Tv you buy will have built-in freeview
becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	Without a model number it is all guesswork, but I doubt your TV has a digital tuner. Digital tuners became mandatory in 2007.    If you use cable, you don't have to worry and you don't need a box.|`|AA12370001	If its hooked to cable, then you don't have to do anything.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Almost certainly the TV is not digital ready.    But in your case, that doesn't matter, because you've got it hooked to cable.  The digital transition only effects those people getting their TV via antenna.
becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	Basic Cable is ALL analog. There are no digital channels. You need to upgrade to digital cable.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	To get HD on cable, you generally need to get the HD Cable box from your cable service.      On mine, the HD cable channels are all in the 700 - 800 range of channels.  Something no TV will be looking for.|`|LddkW0JFaa	The HD channels from your cable co are probably encrypted and this TV cannot decode them. If you want any HD signals, you'll either need to get a set-top box from your cable co, or get an HD Tivo and have your cable co put a cablecard in it.

Read this first, before you run out to buy a new camera:    About the color accent option: it seems to be a current fad that people are getting excited about.  The camera keeps one color and turns everything else black and white.    I would never use such a feature for the following reasons:    ? You are very limited in what you can do.  ? The function isn't always reliable or accurate. The camera's idea of "red" might be different to yours. It will often include/exclude areas that don't want to be included/excluded.  ? Imagine  if you just happened to take your best photo ever, but instead of having a real color photo, you only have some partial b&w thing that might look totally awful. You'd kick yourself.  ? If you do the "Selective or Partial Desaturation" (as it is called correctly) in post processing, you have much more control over it, and will get a way better result. Plus you can keep your original color version, too.    This also applies to any color effects done in camera like b&w or sepia - you're better off NOT to.    If you don't have your own image editor, you can go to www.picnik.com and use their effects menu which makes it very easy.      By the way - have you ever tried reading your manual?

If it was bought after January 2006, it is still eligible for free repair if it is showing 3 red lights.|`|wq4auO5caa	umm you will screw it up even more you 360 i had the rrod call xbox and they will put you on repair list if you have warranty or the will just do it for you depending when your warranty  expired
7nmzxp4Iaa	Pros:    Upgrading from a regular ipod you will se great improvements.  Because you are navigating with your fingers instead of the wheel you can move much faster and with greater accuracy.  If you are in range of wifi you can get the internet and e-mail on the touch.  The ipod app is much better than a regular ipod, it suppots genius playlists as well as lyrics.  The app store is the the best thing about it.  You can download thousands of apps for it and most of them are free!  It will become more and more mainstream in gaming as the platform takes off.  There are already popular titles like simcity on the ipod touch/iphone.  Because it can get aim, as long as you have wifi, you can basically sent text messages to other people's phones.  Just make their name +thentheirnumber.    Cons:    The only real con is that if you are a little OCD then the fingerprints you see when the device is turned off can get annoying.  You can't see them when it's turned on though.  Every once and a while you will have to do a hard reset if something is acting up or it freezes, probably once every couple of months.  It's far better than any competiton though.  Good choice!|`|kaZPtnhRaa	I think they absolutely rock.  I can look on the internet and the internet  is part of my work

I would not recommend a cheap home theater in a box because they are not built well and most have proprietary connection so you can't use the receiver, speakers, or dvd player if one component fails (and they do!). What I would suggest is a decent HT receiver and speakers. Cambridge Soundworks has some decent systems. Onkyo receivers are very good for the money but make sure you get a decent one (they make a full line and somewhere in the middle of the line is probably the best for you). Keep in mind that you may have this system for 20 years. Go to best buy (they aren't going out of business, that's circuit city) and listen to as many different speaker systems as you can afford. Everyone's ear and budget are different but I would suggest listening to Boston Acoustics, Klipsch, and Mirage speakers at least (stay away from the Bose cubes .... overpriced and over-hyped). The CS speakers are very good for the price also.<br>  <br>  If your budget is higher, checkout Denon AV receivers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cambridgesoundworks.com/store/category.cgi?category=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.cambridgesoundworks.com/store...</a>|`|wQFZKkWHaa	The space you're working with is as important as your budget. For the ease of use issue and the size of your TV, the soundbar might work well for you. There are several new ones coming out soon, CES was the big announcement window for those and home theater in a box (HTiB) systems. But i like the sound bar idea because it's easy, they have simulated surround sound and some even have wireless subwoofers to get the bass sounds.
O8qdCBzLaa	Give it 40-50 hours to "break in the sound"? Sounds like someone's pulling your chain. Subwoofer/satellite pairs don't "break in". What they probably meant is that it doesn't sound as good as you expected it would, and after 40-50 hours of listening to it, you'll just get used to the poor sound.    Anyway, by running the satellites out of the subwoofer instead of the receiver, you're using the built-in cross over in the subwoofer, which would be optimized for integration with the satellites. And, as such, should give you better sound performance.
gQqO1sPxaa	I would recommend Mario Kart Wii, Zelda Twilight Princess, and Super Mario Galaxy to start with. They are definite popular top-sellers and the only ones I would definetely suggest!   Since you can only choose one however, I would go with Super Mario Galaxy!

The more help you do and the more you make the animals happy, the more parts of the forest you unlock. 4 players, I think, can play all at once, which is really cool. It is fun for like a week or so, which is someone said is the time they finished the game completely. If you like Sim games, then go rent it and then buy it if you find enough enjoyment in it, if you're not, just rent it to try it also, then buy if you like it also.

oUjuw66uaa	what format did you download them (iso? avi? mpg?)  for a set top DVD player, you will need them to be in a DVD format (lost likely) not just a files. This means you will need to create a DVD with some sort of software, not just drag and drop the files to the DVD-RW. Also, many DVD players have trouble reading DVD-RW --especially if it has been used a few times before. You will need to check your docs about this.

But there is a 56.6 percent of it working|`|PXfUyd5aaa	I dunno, try it. It probably won't work, though, if it wasn't dry already but still functioning, then you probably shorted it out when you tried to turn it on before.    Being honest: since it's an iPod, chances are you never turn it all the way off, so it was probably on. And thus chances are it got into that wash, got all soaked inside while still on, and shorted out. So chances are it's gone.
HDeUYCnXaa	Well, the 2 must have RPG's for wii are The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (40 hours if you play straight through and much much longer if you try to get everything.) and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption (about the same as Zelda, probably a little shorter). not sure if it is an rpg, but Super mario galaxy is also a must have.

Unfortunately I don't think you're going to be able to get anything back of much use from the thumbnails.<br>  <br>  The camera only takes one picture. As far as I understand it, the image file is then used by the operating system to create the thumbnail. The parts of your files that it uses for this must be OK I guess. The bad news is that the thumbnail resolution is only what you see on your PC. It only consists of a small number of pixels. It looks recognisable when it's tiny but it becomes a blocky abstract when blown up.<br>  <br>  You could capture the thumbnail image by doing a 'print screen' capture, but I think that's pretty much it.|`|c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.

0AUTZt5Aaa	I agree with nv_lao    I mean, do you really want to pay $60 a year just for cross game chat? Besides you have your telephone for that    And LIVE doesn't even have dedicated servers, which PSN does (basically LIVE shares its servers with other telecommunications)    I am looking forward to PSN v3.00 then MS will have no more bragging rights on LIVE, and they will have to give a refund to all those people who bought LIVE.    Oh yeah and the LIVE servers have crapped on me numerous times (while at my friend's house)|`|pl2SocVKaa	it is|`|raEUval8aa	I don't really see why Live is so much better. The only real thing Live has that PS3 doesn't have is cross-game chat.    Which the PS3 makes up for in all its extra features like Home and the free internet browser, and free internet in general. PSN is not any more laggy than Live.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	PS3 online is better than live. The only thing that live has that PS3 didn't have was voice messages. Guess what, ps3 has live voice now which means that you can talk to someone like your on the phone over the ps3. Also, PSN is free and requires no adapter    and ps3 uses dedicated servers, its your internet connection that is lagging. get a wired connection or a better router and you will have no lag.|`|fwIe1sQwaa	Ask this on the XBOX section. These PS3 fanatics don't know what they're talking about :P|`|VcNHahtgaa	In withing 4-6 months, PSN will be equal to 360. They are implementing everything that the 360 has. There are rumors that Sony will make a deal with BlockBuster to give the same thing Microsoft and Netflix has with 360.      Also, to me games are not laggy. Resistance 2 has 60 player online games and are never laggy to me. The most on a 360 is like what, 16 players max?    There's also a game called "MAG" coming probably Summer this year that can host 256 players online in 1 game. Let's see 360 do that.|`|0b915c12b3c905a690ee76903af0032baa	Exactly, what does the Live have that PSN doesn't have?   The only thing I can think of is In-game voice chat and sending media messages. I heard some rumors that the new [big] update for PS3 v3.00 will feature these things, or at least the v3.00 will live up to Live.    Some things that PSN have that Live doesn't have:  Home  Live Channels  Folding@Home  Internet Browser  ____    Oh, and to answer your question: Yes; but I think the servers won't be reliable as Live. Some online games on the PSN have some bad servers.|`|H162bS7kaa	I have both and personally PS3 online is already way better for one simple reason, its free!!!  Xbox is cool and all but come on the PS3 looks so much better and then toss in the fact that the online play is stunning you cant go wrong.      COD4 and 5 is so smooth and simply amazing to play online.|`|mE3wNi8Raa	i really dont know why everyone says live is better than psn,i cant think of a reason why live is better because there is nothing in live that u cannot do on psn,but on live its worse you have to pay and also there is no home no internet|`|197RAFFMaa	Depends on the game. All the games I play (Rock Band, Resistance 2, The Orange Box, Condemned 2, CoD 4) have great servers and I've literally never lagged.    Now for sports games... I never play those, so I have no idea. I think if they are published by Sony, they will have good servers. If they have to use the servers of a third-party company, they may not be so good.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	It excactly te same it's EA Sports, 2k Sports or whatever company that has a bad server. It's not PS3|`|cCC7KTrKaa	Once you're in game they're both the same.      The only difference is Xbox has the cross game chat and PSN is free.    I'll take the free service, thanks.

Wii fit is nice to play but don't stop getting outside exercise.|`|yfwY8XGlaa	no it does not.|`|ucUZ9YZeaa	some people take this sooo literally. Wii fit is basically aid for weight loss. It keeps people from just sitting around doing nothing. I usually play every game when i play it. i do the yoga poses, aerobics, strength training and im always sweating at the end because it takes about an hour and a half or more to do all of it. so yes it will help u lose weight if all u do is sit at home and eat and watch tv. it basically gives u another option. but if u depend only on the wii to lose weight instead of changing eating habits and still getting your regular exercise then nope it wont work.

cViFUALzaa	make sure your mast is level, find out the elevation of the satellite you want from http://www.dishpointer.com/ . you can also use the satellite finder to find out the direction of the satellite based on your location. it is also a good idea to invest in a satellite finder tool. as long as the elevation is correct, you should be able to find the satellite you want by moving the dish left or right.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Angle of elevation and direction of the satellite.|`|FR4fzr4Zaa	I found that to align a sat dish is to set it up out side if you can or near to the dish and move the dish left or right/up or down till you get the signal. very easy. if not screwfix direct do a satellite finder for around 15: if you want to do it better. good luck.|`|TJGje2blaa	You can do it, using the Receiver outside, moving the dish manually, but this is very tricky.  You need to ask a Satellite Company Rep, or better yet, pay him to come & do it.  If the dish is not perfectly level, you won't get your signals, either.    An experienced guy can do it in no time, where-as, you may pull your hair out & still not get it right.  Each location has its own settings, too, so what works in one state, won't work in another.  You'll find out that these people really earns their fees.

O8qdCBzLaa	Get this subwoofer (Klipsch KSW-10): http://cgi.ebay.com/KLIPSCH-KSW-10-SUBWO...    And these satellites (Klipsch Quintet III) and surround sound receiver (Denon AVR-1602): http://cgi.ebay.com/Klipsch-Quintet-II-S...    The speakers are all new and the receiver is used, but a very good model. You'll have your complete sound system for under $600. And, it will kick but. I've been running this system with a Yamaha surround receiver for over 2 years and it sounds great. You can also mount the surround speakers on the wall. They are very small and come with mounting brackets. I put mine on stands in the corners of the room.    And, seriously, avoid Bose. They are overrated and overpriced. I bought a bose Acoustimass 5 system before the Klipsch system and I hated it. I just gave it to my step-son in exchange for some computer work. But, I love the Klipsch (always have since I was a kid) and I don't think you can get a better audio product for the money.|`|Eazlb9Kdaa	since you are in a small area, i would recommend a bose 3-2-1 system.   i have this system and it is amazing, only two speakers in front that mimic the quality of surround sound. run you about a grand or you can get one from eBay or craigslist for much cheaper.  go to bose store in your area and listen to one, your place will sound like a movie theater.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Here's a good Blu-ray and 5.1 setup for about $1,000:    http://www.amazon.com/The-Best-Hi-Def-Ho...
d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Yes, I have a good experience to share.    I purchased the Samsung 52" LCD and was proceeding to enjoy it immensely when 5 days after purchasing, my 3 year old threw a pacifier at the screen.  It wasn't even a hard aimed throw, but kind of a backhand thing.  It knocked out a small group of pixels, probably no bigger then a tip of a dull pencil.  But those damaged pixels grew to about the size of the end of a pencil eraser quickly.    Fortunately my retailer took mercy on me when I brought it back and let me exchange it for a 50" Samsung Plasma, which has been a wonderful TV for over a year now.  And this year's Samsung plasmas seem to be even better!    The lesson is, LCDs screens are damaged far easier then Plasmas are.  You can verify this easily enough by poking a few of each in the store.    Right now, Samsung has some very sweet 50" plasmas out, and the prices are good.  I'd go with the PN50A650, only $1,400 and some change at Amazon.  Free delivery, and you may not even have to pay sales tax.|`|fQgbBx7caa	My neighbor just bought 6, yes 6 Samsung t.v.s   I bought 2 right before xmas.

Xxviy63Paa	You will have to look elsewhere, because nobody here is allowed to tell you how to do the 3-sensor mod.    It would be a hell of a lot easier to just run the games on your pc, since apparently you have one.

Ns6I7MmBaa	If you are getting snow with an antenna, you likely have your TV set on analog TV (NTSC) instead of digital (ATSC).  Is it an HDTV (which should have a digital tuner) or just "HDTV Ready" (no digital tuner).  Some TV's have a separate antenna connection for digital (besides a different menu selection).|`|AA11525080	As of last week most stations are broadcasting in digital
AA10959572	1) iPhone are made in China<br>  <br>  <br>  2) A non-Apple one is probably better anyways|`|Y3aNeD3naa	The chinks (chinese manufacturers) are usually very honest about whether their products are real or not. They never use the manufacturer's logo, and they name them things like "hi-phone - Apple i-phone imitation." If you bought your i-phone at a reputable mobile center (or better yet, straight from apple), then I don't think you have anything to worry about.
Zy0OcOpeaa	Yea, its pretty annoying, sometimes it cant find any other serves and stuff,<br>  <br>  A thing to do is to start a new free mode, and in a while people will come.
qGfAlDd2aa	If your TVs are analog only AND you will use them with an antenna, then yes you will need a converter box for each set.<br>  <br>  If the sets have Digital tuners, then the converter box functionality is built in.|`|akvrwpywaa	If they're analog and you want to watch separate channels on each one.  I mean, you COULD just get one, then run wires to all four TV's, but then you'd have to watch the same channel on all the TV's that are hooked up to it.|`|H44mq72Paa	Yeah i think so, unless you have a hdtv you should just go and get the converter boxes but don't trust my word 100%. that's just word of mouth

KxXOSySUaa	Hands Down: The Canon HV30 VIXIA. When I was in your shoes, every specialist in Best Buy, B&H Photo & every other photo place told me that they were drooling for the Canon HV20, which was a bit over $1K at the time.    By the time I decided to buy it, the HV30 was out, apparently a model above the HV20, and I got it for $899 (now it's like $600).    It is by far the best camera I could ask for, especially since my experiences with my previous JVC Everio MG-130 was TERRIBLE.   I moved from Windows to Mac, and one big reason was because of photo / video editing. When I found out that the salesrep 'yes-ed' me to death, and it didn't have any firewire, etc., I was really upset.    A year later, I bought my Vixia HV30 (by Canon) and could not be happier. After tons of research, I learned that the best media for editing on a Mac afterwards is Mini-DV.    The HV-30 is a High-Definition packed bundle of joy that is responsible for endless hours of memories. It has a built-in FULL SIZE HDMI port, which connects right to my 46 inch TV (1080p) & my video is clear as could be.    Read some reviews on it & go try it in the store. But if I had to do it again, I would.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	I would suggest Canon VIXIA HV30 MiniDV High Definition Camcorder  10x optical zoom; SuperRange Optical Image Stabilizer   24p Cinema Mode; 30p Progressive Mode   2.7-inch widescreen Multi-Angle Vivid LCD   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00114P...    or if you want flash memory camcorder Canon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder with 16 GB Internal Flash Memory is a good choice.  12x optical zoom; SuperRange Optical Image Stabilizer   24p Cinema Mode; 30p Progressive Mode   2.7-inch widescreen Multi-Angle Vivid LCD   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001144...|`|m2pavYMcaa	Im waiting for this to come out, its the newer model of the hf100, its supposed to be alot better, im gonna wait a few weeks after it comes out so i can read the reviews of it too.    http://www.amazon.com/Canon-VIXIA-Memory...

It could be anything really and without knowing what you got in your system hard to say.     You will tend to see problems in the ITV stations first as they use a different QAM that is that they bundle a lot more stations down the 8Mhz band and as such are not as flexible as the BBC muxes or others.    If you just have a aerial and cable down to the point it is probably rust on the bit that picks the signal up or degrigation in the cable over time. (That would be my two guesses anyhow)

VMVW3E7Aaa	Hmmm...... I'm not sure that you can. It is a fantastic little camera, but that seems to be one of its drawbacks.    It doesn't appear to have a filter thread on the front (according to owner reviews), and Canon doesn't list a lens adapter under the accessories, so that leads me to believe it can't be done.    If you're ready to play around with lenses (note: the singular is lens, not lense), you might need to start looking at DSLR cameras, instead.
18K7ucsEaa	Is it just on the low E string or is it all of them. The problem with rattling is that the strings vibrate and touch the neck. You need to have the bridge or nut lifted so that the strings won't hit. You can adjust the truss rod with a hex key, but I suggest you don't do this unless you really know how because you can easily permanently bow the neck this way. I'd just take it in to have the bridge raised.    :-D

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	you should be using the red, blue, and green component video cables, the switch on your cable should be set to HDTV, and the settings in the 360 dashboard should be set to 720p.  You do not need HDMI.|`|5qRbgqnBaa	You have to go to console settings and change the output to 720p, you can set it to 1080 if your TV set supports it.    Regards.

Have you downloaded the new update from iTunes?|`|jPeySdTSaa	It is just a glitch.  It is very dumb, but the newest software update should fix it.

jhop0uYPaa	Go to "LIBRARY" on limewire, then click on a song that you want and click on a button that says "ENQUE" with a little plus sign (it's somewhere in the middle)...this adds the song that you clicked to a playlist on the bottom of limewire...add as many songs as you want...after you have all the songs you want, click on a button that says "SAVE AS" (it's on the bottom left corner)...save them anywhere you want then go to iTunes...in iTunes go to FILE--->ADD FILE TO LIBRARY and look for the file that you saved from limewire...all the music that you saved should appear in itunes...do this anytime you download new music and wish to put them in iTunes...GOOD LUCK|`|y6c2V3Qwaa	Simple open iTunes library then Limewire's library click the limewire song CLICK and DRAG to iTunes!|`|WtxoR575aa	first you have to update your itunes to recognize that you have music in the limewire folder.    find the folder your music is being saved to. usually:  c:\Documents and Settings\your_computers_name_here\Shared  (mine is c:\Documents and Settings\anna\Shared)     then you go to itunes and click file>import>find the folder with your music in it.here is an image  http://z.about.com/d/ipod/1/5/2/0/-/-/ad...    Now go check your iTunes library for those songs and you will find them categorized in the proper places.    It may take some time for Itunes to convert certain files like music files that end in .wma but your work is all done.     Goodluck.|`|1WXPDnYTaa	what you're doing is illegal.

VMVW3E7Aaa	It depends on your settings and even on each scene, but here is a rough and easy guide to give you a bit of an idea: http://www.picstop.co.uk/pdf/image_count...    Keep in mind that you should never EVER set your camera to anything less than best quality (i.e. lowest compression rate) and biggest size (highest resolution).    The reasons for that include:    1) If you have a good, large photo, you can crop it more later on without losing too much detail if you really have to.  2) If you happen to take the best photo you ever took, you'll be able to print it at a large size. If you lowered size and quality, you'd be kicking yourself.  3) If you decide later you really don't want to keep a big file, it is very easy to down-size it in post processing - but you can't go the other way, you can't invent pixels that weren't there in the first place.  4) Memory cards are cheap, so are bigger hard drives. There is NO reason to do anything less than the best.    Also: don't store your photos on the card, a memory card is NOT meant for storage. Make sure to download to your computer after every shoot and make backups, then FORMAT your card in the camera (which helps to protect it from developing problems and failing).|`|22fca0784b8657563e32d64aab1fae2faa	It all depends on the size of the photos you take. For example with my camera I have the option of taking small pictures (640x680) all the way to a large photo (2816x2112). The size of the picture greatly changes the amount of photos you can take. But I can tell you this, if you have a 8GB you can take A LOT of pictures. I have a 256 MB (sad) but I can take about 200 pics set on medium 1600x1200). 8 GB is a lot more than 256 MB so you pretty much don't have much to worry about other than your battery life.
HBNx77BBaa	Got to be a bit concerned about your L11 comments. It's well-liked so your experience wasn't typical. Before you spend $250 be sure to actually try out the cameras in a store. The Canon Powershot A590IS is a camera that can take great pictures and it costs around $105.    Have a look at the comments in Ken Rockwell's recommended list...    http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/recommen...|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Well none of those links work so its hard to say what the last two are. The first one I can see is the Olympus 1050 SW. If you are going to for just good image quality in a point and shoot I would steer clear of this camera. While it does have the added benefit of being waterproof, dustproof, shockproof, coldproof, the image quality I think lacks somewhat because of all the other features you pay for. But if you see yourself using those proofs, then its still a decent camera. Imo the Canon Powershots are the way to go in terms of overall image quality and camera build for point and shoots. I do not know which one you linked to but I can recommend the SD880 IS as a good one. Imo touch screen is a completely useless addition on a camera especially since as you point out its much more likely to get the screen scratched and dirty. As a word of advice, bad lighting is not really an effect of the camera itself, nor are blurry pictures. Granted some situations are pretty bad and will produce blurry pictures, but an understanding of aperture, shutter speed relations and the necessary shutter speeds for certain types of shots can be very helpful. Also learning about what types of light work good for what shots is good to know as well.
SKqTyJD6aa	haha and how did you manage to do that? lol    anyways take it to the electronics store....see what they can do...|`|d6FoskJPaa	Make sure it is off and don't try to start it  soak it in clean water for about a minute  Put it in a bowl of rice (it will absorb it)  Let it sit for some time|`|v2ut95Wzaa	if you haven't taken it to a electronics shop i would do so a.s.a.p
