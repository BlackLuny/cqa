0f31c3b6fd63743455c16dc0b66cf67caa	OUI; Il y a quelques annes voyage Louxor> Paris sur le vol Flash Airlines. Dj l'avion est parti pour le dcollage quand les passagers taient encore debout et taient en train de ranger leurs affaires. Ensuite au bout de 4 h de vol on voyait toujours la mditerane en bas. Les passagers taient trs inquiets vous imaginez bien. Seulement les h?tesses de l'air ne parlaient pas un mot fran?ais ni anglais! le capitaine NON PLUS. Heureusement il y avait un passager qui parlait arabe et qui a pu communiquer un peu avec les h?tesses. Du coup c'est lui qui traduisait tout au micro pour les autres passagers!!! Comme ?a on a appris que l'avion n'avait plus de carburant! et on devait faire un arrt d'urgence  Milan! Tout le monde paniquait moi la premire! A Milan la moiti des passagers voulaient sortir et continuer le voyage avec une autre compagnie mais les h?tesses sont restes debout devant les portes et ont refus de passer les gens. On est enfin dcoll vers Paris. ET l quand j'ai compris qu'il faudra passer par les Alpes j'ai eu peur! Finalement on est arriv  Paris aprs plus de 8 H de voyage! Et dans quelques mois cet avion est tomb dans la Mer Rouge  cot de Sharm El Sheih|`|73a5187cc65f51d9696d3e08ab02264eaa	oui une fois je rentrais avec Easyjet et on entend le train d'atterissage sortir (normal on approchait de l'aroport), on voit le sol se rapprocher (normal)....l on est  20m au-dessus du sol et soudain le pilote remet les gaz  fond!!! on redcole et pendant 10min on fait un cercle complet dans le ciel sans que le pilote nous dise pourquoi....franchement j'avais les chocottes!!!

Sur le coup, un peu de peur et de pression parce que j'tais place tip top bien si la queue de l'avion se dtachait ou prenait feu et puis finalement, je me suis dit que si je mourrais, et bien tant pis, j'avais dj eu la chance de vivre ce que j'ai vcu...

Les deux parties sont donc lies par des engagements contratuels qui sont dcrits dans les conditions de vente. Les possibilits d'annulation, de report et de remboursement sont indiques dans le contrat de vente. Dans certains cas, le remboursement est exclu mais souvent des frais plus ou moins levs selon la date  laquelle le contrat est rompu sont  la charge du consommateur. En labsence dassurance, l'annulation d'un voyage peut co?ter dautant plus cher que la date de dpart se rapproche.       Le cas des billets d'avion et des titres de transport de la SNCF.    Si c'est uniquerment  la lecture du contrat de vente (dont les conditions sont souvent rappeles au dos du billet) qu'il est possible d'tre certain des possibilits offertes aux consommateurs, il existe des rgles gnrales qu'il est utile de conna?tre. Depuis l'anne 2005, la SNCF a adopt un rgime plus svre qui rejoint les conditions appliques par les compagnies ariennes. Un billet au tarif normal sur une ligne rgulire est rembours intgralement si l'annulation est demande avant le dpart. Dans ce cas, seul le co?t de la rservation est perdu pour le client. Nous allons voir qu'il existe de nombreux cas particuliers et qu'il est important de conna?tre les conditions de vente avant d'acheter un billet.     Les billets d'avion. Chaque compagnie arienne applique des conditions qui lui sont propres en ce qui concerne la possibilit pour le voyageur d'obtenir le report ou le remboursement d'un vol.   vol regulier plein tarif : Les billets plein tarif sont gnralement valables un an. Ils peuvent tre utiliss ou rembourss ou changs  tout moment. Si vous avez rserv un vol prcis, vous devez en cas de dsistement prvenir la compagnie arienne. Des frais dannulation de votre rservation peuvent vous tre facturs si l'annualtion est tardive.       vol  tarif promotionnel et charter : Plus le tarif est bas, plus les conditions de remboursement sont restrictives et les pnalits importantes. Ces formules ne permettent pas de rserver sans payer la totalit du billet. L'engagement est ferme. Souvent aucun remboursement n'est possible.       Les forfaits vol + hbergement : Ces prestations touristiques sont vendues par les agences de voyages et sont accompagnes d'une brochure dtaillant les prix, les modalits de paiement, les conditions dannulation et de rvision du contrat. Si vous annulez, des pnalits plus ou moins importantes seront appliques. Les barmes ne sont pas fixes par la loi et sont propres  chaque contrat. Un usage assez rpandu dfini une plage progressive de pnalit entre 1 mois et moins d'une semaine avant le dpart, durant laquelle vous serez progessivement redevable de 10%  100% du prix du voyage.       Pour les forfaits touristiques, une solution consiste  revendre vos billets  un tiers. Il faut en informer votre agence 7 jours avant le dpart. Sauf accord de la compagnie arienne, un vol sec ne peut tre revendu car il est nominatif.

For most temperate weather most cars, 10W30 pr 10-W40 is good.  In colder weather, 5W20 or 5W30 is better for cold starts, since it's thinner at start up it's easier for it to warm up.

1725118e553d8b7372f0c591223f1186aa	Wie in frankkis Artikel schon angedeutet ist, wird W?HREND der Landung kein Treibstoff abgelassen! Aus deinen in der Frage genannten "Sicherheitsgrnden" ist es n?mlich auf jeden Fall besser noch Treibstoff im Tank zu haben, als mit dem letzten Tropfen landen zu mssen. Denn stell Dir nur mal vor, die Landebahn wird blockiert (weil das Flugzeug vorher einen Reifenplatzer hat oder noch schlimmer vielleicht von der Bahn rutscht). Das hei?t nun fr alle anfliegenden Flugzeuge, dass sie dort definitiv nicht landen k?nnen und durchstarten mssen bzw. dann in sog. "Holdings" (Warteschleifen) geschickt werden! So etwas geht dann nur mit ausreichend Reserven. Schafft es der Flughafen dann nicht, die Landebahn wieder rechtzeitig zu r?umen, muss woanders gelandet werden n?mlich auf dem sog. "Alternate" (dem Ausweichflughafen). Der Flug dahin ist ebenfalls nur mit gengend Reserven durchfhrbar.    Was frankkis ber Langstreckenflugzeuge geschrieben/kopiert hat, kann ich nur best?tigen:    Gr??ere Flugzeuge haben tats?chlich ein h?heres Startgewicht als Landegewicht. Nehmen wir also an, eine Boeing 747 (maximales Startgewicht/MTOW etwa 400 t zu maximalem Landegewicht/MLAW etwa knapp 300 t) startet voll beladen in Frankfurt.  Tritt nun nach dem Start irgendwann im "climb-out" eine technische St?rung ein, die die Rckkehr erfordert (z.B. Triebwerksausfall - das Ding hat 4 davon, also fliegerisch berhaupt kein Problem) muss eben Treibstoff abgelassen werden k?nnen, um das zul?ssige Landegewicht nicht zu berschreiten, denn die Koffer kann man ja schlecht rausschmei?en...  Dafr gibt's nun (in Frankfurt z.B. ber dem Taunus) aber spezielle Gebiete, also nicht ber bewohntem Gebiet. Das ganze wird dann mit der Flugsicherung koordiniert und findet (laut Gesetz) in mindestens 5000ft ber GND statt (meist aber sogar ber 18000ft).  Au?erdem sollte der Treibstoff im Geradeausflug (also nicht in einem Holding/Warteschleife) in "clean configuration" (also ohne Klappen und Fahrwerk) und au?erhalb von Wolken (wegen statischer Aufladung/Entladung!) abgelassen werden.  Bei den meisten Flugzeugen liegen die Ablassraten bei 2000 kg pro Minute. D.h. in unserem Beispiel, dass die B747 rund 50 Minuten brauchen wird, um das Landegewicht zu erreichen.    Oben genanntes Beispiel und andere Notf?lle und wirklich NUR Notf?lle, die eine Rckkehr erzwingen, sind die einzigen F?lle, bei denen Treibstoff abgelassen wird. Beim Landeanflug an sich wird so ein Verfahren NIEMALS angewendet!|`|f69e237ee9af72ee0f5f056c8c7f3c5caa	Schau mal in der Spalte oben (Suche nach Fragen) nach - ich habe diese Frage vor kurzer Zeit gestellt und relativ viele Antworten erhalten.     Sehr interessant!|`|2cbe230762575cb4bb17c7fda42ce32aaa	Nein, sie machen das nicht immer, sondern nur in Ausnahmef?llen.  In der Regel wird der berechnete Sprit auch verbraucht. Ich denke schon, dass der abgelassene Treibstoff im Falle des Falles nach einiger Zeit fein zerst?ubt den Boden erreicht und nicht sehr lange in der Luft bleibt.|`|fb25a7b5abf85aa4ae893756aed04680aa	Das Fahrgestell eines Flugzeuges wird bei der Landung st?rker beansprucht als beim Start. Aus diesem Grund liegt bei Langstreckenflugzeugen, die ber eine hohe Treibstoffkapazit?t verfgen, das h?chstzul?ssige Landegewicht deutlich unter dem h?chstzul?ssigen Startgewicht.   Fr den Fall, dass nach dem Start technische Schwierigkeiten auftreten, die eine rasche Landung erzwingen, sind Langstrecken-Flugzeugmuster wie z.B. der Airbus A 340, die Boeing 747 "Jumbo Jet" mit Vorrichtungen ausgestattet, ber die im Flug Treibstoff abgelassen werden kann.  Das als "Fuel Dumping" bezeichnete Treibstoffablassverfahren ist auf Notf?lle beschr?nkt, bei denen keine Zeit bleibt, den berschssigen Treibstoff zu verfliegen und die in Einzelf?llen erlaubte bergewichtslandung nicht m?glich ist.    Die Flugsicherung registriert pro Jahr etwa 50 derartiger Vorkommnisse in Deutschland, wobei in jedem zweiten Fall ein milit?risches Luftfahrzeug betroffen ist. Sie weist dem Flugzeug einen Luftraum zu, in dem Treibstoff abgelassen werden darf. Dies geschieht nach M?glichkeit ber unbebautem Gebiet und in einer Mindesth?he von 1.500 Metern, meistens jedoch in 4 - 8 Kilometern H?he.    Der gr??te Teil des abgelassenen Treibstoffes verdampft. Bei einer Mindesth?he von 1.500 Metern, Windstille und einer Bodentemperatur von 15 C erreichen 8 % der Treibstoffmenge den Boden. Daraus l?sst sich eine Bodenbelastung von 0,02 Gramm/m2 ermitteln, was mengenm??ig einem Schnapsglas Kerosin verteilt auf eine Grundfl?che von 1.000 m2 entspricht.    Wie schon ausgefhrt, handelt es sich beim "Fuel Dumping" um ein Notverfahren fr Langstreckenflugzeuge. Die auf Kurz- und krzeren Mittelstrecken eingesetzten Verkehrsflugzeuge (z.B. Airbus A 300, A 310 und A 320, Boeing 737, 757) verfgen nicht ber eine Vorrichtung zum Treibstoffablass. Dies gilt auch fr alle am Flughafen Hof - Plauen eingesetzten Flugzeugtypen wie z.B. die Dash 8-100/200/300/400 von Augsburg Airways.   Bei diesen Typen ist die Differenz zwischen h?chstzul?ssigem Start- und Landegewicht so gering, dass in Notf?llen auch bergewichtslandungen durchgefhrt werden k?nnen.  Bei hoher Luftfeuchtigkeit k?nnen hinter landenden Flugzeugen Dunstfahnen sichtbar werden. Dabei handelt es sich nicht um abgelassenen Treibstoff, sondern um in Luftwirbeln kondensierte Luftfeuchtigkeit, die als Nebelfahne sichtbar wird.|`|YzYDIxqPaa	verrckt aber war    wenn ein Flugzeug vor der Landung zu viel Sprit hat, wird es einfach abgelassen,  manchmal Tonnen    so kann man auch Sprit sparen    es bleibt in den oberen Luftschichten h?ngen  weil Kerosin  ist leichter als Luft|`|SWo6YRBVaa	Nicht alle Flugzeuge mssen Kerosin ablassen!  Es gibt eine H?chstgewicht bei Landungen das nicht berschritten werden darf! Das ist in ungef?hr 10 bis 15%  der langsteckenflge ! Weil man mit Gegenwinden und  Umleitungen rechnen mu?!!! Kurzstreckenfge  brauchen keine  so gro?e Notreserven ! Und das Kerosin geht in die Atmosph?re!  Leider!!|`|e7573ef08494d74b9770f9b2b6eaabb0aa	Ich frage mich, wieso sich dieses Gercht solange h?lt.  Fr Langstreckenflugzeuge wurde das schon oben richtig erkl?rt, Kurzstreckenflugzeuge haben in den meisten F?llen gar keine Vorrichtung zum Ablassen von Treibstoff.  Das Landegewicht ist bei diesen Flugzeugen kein Problem - und warum sollte man den Sprit ablassen, den man vorher teuer (relativ) gekauft hat? Den benutzt man dann eben auf dem n?chsten Flug und muss entsprechend weniger nachtanken.  Aber ich vermute, alle Leute, die unter einem landenden Flugzeug tief einatmen, riechen etwas. Aber geht mal an einer Raffinerie vorbei, da stinkt es auch, und die kippen den Sprit auch nicht weg!
7a79b57d263cd28f55402aa0e3d18e05aa	Anmelden kannst Du ein Auto nur in dem Land, in dem Du einen festen Wohnsitz hast, in Deinem Fall also in Deutschland. Wo Du dann tats?chlich haupts?chlich mit dem Auto herumf?hrst, ist dann allein Deine Sache - Du f?hrst dann halt mit deutschem Kennzeichen z. B. in Frankreich herum. Lediglich bei einem Wohnsitzwechsel ins Ausland wrdest Du auch Dein Auto im Ausland anmelden.    Der Kauf funktioniert genauso wie beim Kauf eines Re-Import-Autos auf eigene Faust, also ohne Einschaltung eines kommerziellen Re-Importeurs.    Sofern Du in einem EU-Land kaufst, ist die Sache relativ einfach.  Vom Fahrzeugh?ndler (z. B. in Holland) l?sst Du Dir vor der Abholung des Autos das Certificate of Conformity (COC) zuschicken. Da Du in so einem Fall die Mehrwertsteuer nicht im Land des Kaufs, sondern im Land Deines Wohnsitzes schuldest, gehst Du als n?chstes mit dem Kaufvertrag zu Deinem Finanzamt und kl?rst die Entrichtung der deutschen Mehrwertsteuer auf den Nettopreis - der H?ndler im Ausland verkauft Dir das Auto zum Nettopreis, sofern Du Dich mit Deinem Finanzamt vorher schriftlich dazu geeinigt hast. Am besten vorher mal beim Finanzamt anrufen und fragen wie das geht. Dann schlie?t Du mit einer Versicherung Deiner Wahl eine Kraftfahrzeugversicherung ab - mindestens Haftpflicht. Damit (COC und Versicherungsbescheinigung) gehst Du zu deiner ?rtlichen Zulassungstelle, und l?sst Dir die Zulassungsbescheinigung Teil 1 und Teil 2 ausstellen. Au?erdem bezahlst Du dort die Kraftfahrzeugsteuer bzw. erteilst die Einzugserm?chtigung. Dann besorgst Du Dir die Kennzeichen, l?sst sie stempeln, und dann sind die Formalit?ten fertig. Mit allem vorgenannten in der Tasche holst Du dann Dein neues Auto ab - ob beim Reimport-H?ndler um die Ecke, oder am ?u?ersten Zipfel der EU.    Wenn das Auto nicht aus der EU stammt, bzw. der H?ndler nicht in der EU sitzt, wird es etwas schwieriger. Dann musst Du n?mlich mit den Papieren vom Fahrzeughersteller (was auch immer Du bekommst) erstmal zum TV, und Dir best?tigen lassen, dass dieses Auto den Bestimmungen fr den deutschen Stra?enverkehr entspricht. Dann alles weitere wie zuvor.  In besonders schwierigen F?llen hilft dann nur: Auto kaufen mit allen erh?ltlichen Papieren, zum Zollamt am Ort des H?ndlers gehen, Zoll fr die Einfuhr nach Deutschland zahlen, und per Autotransporter erstmal nach Hause bringen. Dann alles weitere in Deutschland kl?ren (TV, Versicherung, Finanzamt, Zulassung).|`|b1ac56546144e892420d7d12fadbd6afaa	wenn ich es richtig verstanden habe, willst du ein fahrzeug in einem andern eu land zulassen. solltest dich bei der zust?ndigen botschaft erkundigen, denn dies ist zulassungsrecht des jeweiligen landes. kann dir nur auskunft geben, wenn du ein fahrzeug in deutschland zulassen willst.|`|3ddbb3ece8e9a6ce9fc1cb6bd51cd799aa	Geht schon, aber nur mit festem Wohnsitz.

f4aa2326b6b09f2558d4405e7c05fb7aaa	Have you checked your heater core for any leaks?  Maybe it's a slight leak that builds up coolant while driving down the highway (when the system is more pressurized than at idle).  When you stop and idle, the system loses pressure and is no longer feeding the leak and what is there cooks off, giving you the smell.  Just a theory, but I would check your heater core to be sure.|`|d5d8a80808f848cd83d12174318c9e9faa	You may have a small antifreeze leak.  In my experience, it has most often been a small "hard to see" leak in an antifreeze hose.  But the leak could be anywhere in your cooling system.    The antifreeze smell is probably from the vapors that come from the leaking antifreeze getting on a hot engine surface, producing a strong odor.    Here's why I think you only smell the odor at idle.  At idle, the car is not moving and the odor is at full strength, not being mixed very much with the surrounding air.  But, when the car moves, the odor mixes more thoroughly with the air due to the air movement around the car.      There are some things you can do.  You could look all around the coolant hoses for coolant leaks after you have been driving long enough to get the engine up to normal operating temperature.  If you know other parts of the cooling system, such as where the radiator is, you could examine those parts for coolant leaks, also.  However, because the leak is likely to be small, the coolant may be turning to gas as soon as it hits a hot engine part, which means it would be hard to see the leak.  If you do not personally find any leak, you could pay a radiator shop or dealership to do a pressure test on your cooling system to locate any leaks.      Ask how bad the leak is, where the leak is located, what work needs to be done to fix the leak and an estimate (cost) for them to fix it.  You may be able to fix the leak yourself if it something like a leaking coolant hose.  If the leak is slow, you may not need to fix it right away.  If you are having bad weather or will be traveling in underserviced areas or are planning a long trip soon, I suggest you get the leak fixed as soon as possible.|`|13b03e11c6d4e19fd46ec4ec6f23ec9daa	check the water pump for leaks. good chance it is.  if it is leaking, better get it fixed asap. if u run it out of water, u'll cook the engine fast.  u'll know ur out of water when u turn on the heater and it blows cold air...yet the temp gauge reads 150, and still climbing.|`|f530c45f9f8bff9feb9a32862844571baa	the only time you smell antifreeze through the vents is when your heater core is leaking!!!!!!! look for wettness on the floor by your glovebox. it's a pain in the *** to fix depending on the make and model

"il veicolo sar utilizzato solo dal contraente" o "non dovr mai essere utilizzato da una persona di et inferiore agli anni x")al quale il contraente si deve attenere scrupolosamente...se tua madre dovesse dichiarare che non la utilizzer nessuno che abbia meno di 26 anni e poi invece la guidi tu,nel caso accada anche solo un piccolo incidente in cui magari tu hai torto,l'assicurazione prima risarcisce la controparte poi per si rif su di te.Ci accade perch il veicolo in quel caso  come se non fosse assicurato...e non conviene mai correre un rischio del genere,primo perch a quel punto tanto valeva non pagare il premio assicurativo,secondo perch se per caso vi sono lesioni fisiche ai danni della controparte sono dolori per il portafogli(migliaia di euro di risarcimento che devi sborsare di tasca tua-quando le lesioni non sono gravi-pi i danni ai veicoli...).  A questo punto,se vuoi risparmiare intestando l'auto a tua madre ti conviene pagare un  p di pi dichiarando che la utilizzerai tu o cercando un'assicurazione che non ponga vincoli di et.

8e33f8a849ca8ef54133411fe4be7628aa	Hmmmm.... habe gerade etwas gegooglet (schreibt man das so?), denn frher, als ich noch als Teenager mit 20 Pfennig in der Tasche von Freiburg nach Berlin getrampt bin, da gab es an jeder Autobahnrastst?tte eine kostenlose hochformatige Auslage, die wenn mich nicht alles t?uscht, "Autobahnfink" hie?.

0b974c44c4832c6adf69e44a2a906539aa	On older vehicles you got these parts new - spark plugs, points, condenser. Distributor cap & rotor were replaced on a need to basis.  Adjustments on air/ fuel mix, idle & timing. About the only things to change now are the spark plugs. Distributor cap, rotor, & numerous sensors are changed as needed.|`|2e7ee769866db0ef127ea60c2c0b99d8aa	Tuneups involve changing the spark plugs, spark plug cables, fuel filter, air filter, distributor rotor, checking timing and compression, and sometimes an oil change.

Sometimes they will do the "drip" method where they hang a bottle to your hood which is up and connect a hose to the intake and add it that way...|`|8uiRNqicaa	That depends on who you ask. Newer cars are run by an electronic computer type module. If you have a mechanic you trust, who has the latest test equipment, his computer will scan your car computer. Codes will come up telling him if there is anything that needs to be changed. Maybe you will be fortunate enough to find a guy that is honest and won't fix what ain't broke. For example, my 1998 Ford Windstar had 40,000 miles on it when it developed a miss. The computer scan said I needed a spark plug wire. That's it.  So instead of changing everything, we changed the  4 spark plug wire. My mechanic only does what's necessary. I have changed the plugs only twice. My van now has 260,000 miles on it. It still gets 20 mpg, and doesn't burn oil. I put 500 miles on each week. I change the oil every 3000 miles and I don't do anything else unless the computer says to. I change the trans fluid and filter every 100,000 miles. Most people do a lot more work to their car, and wouldn't agree with what I say, but "the proof is in the pudding." My van has exceeded it's designed service life with very little unnecessary maintenence. Find a good mechanic. That makes all the difference. And stay away from the dealerships. All they care about is making money, not necessarily about what's best for you or your car.

89fe044c4d20ad11caa431bd83c3e20eaa	Generally, you can convert almost any gasoline vehicle to run on ethanol, but what you will need to do depends on the specific vehicle.  Some cars may only need some reprogramming of the computer or a different chip, or to have the carb readjusted in an older car.  Be careful, however, because ethanol is part alcohol and can attack some of the gaskets and seals in the fuel system of your car.  Not all cars have this problem, and some cars made in the last 10 years or so are designed to run on either gas or ethanol.  I know some Ford vehicles (certain Ranger and Taurus models, and maybe others) that way, and they had a little badge on the back and an extra guage in the dashboard.  If your car is one where ethanol would cause the gaskets and seals to deteriorate, you should be able to get replacement ones that would solve the problem.  Just make sure you replace them before you convert the car, not as they fail, or you could have a fuel leak that causes a fire and destroys your car.  Research first to make sure you have all the information, and then go for it.  The only downside of ethanol is that the alcohol in it is mildly more corrosive than plain gasoline, so fuel system and engine parts may wear out slightly faster, but they will stay cleaner until that point for the same reason.  And your car will run cleaner.  In case you are interested in alternative fuels, cars can usually also be converted to run on electricity, CNG (natural gas), LPG (propane), and a few other things.  Most of these, like ethanol, will make the car run cleaner than gasoline.  Also, diesel engines can be made to run on biodiesel or vegetable oil with some modifications.  I hope this helps.|`|AA12261615	i own a shop ,and there's not much conversion needed to run it,i run a 50/50 mix of it now,and didn't do anything to my truck,and but it runs a lot better, most cars and rucks will run on it,without too much conversion,good luck hope this will help.|`|RBDVi7XDaa	If you are going with a fifty fifty mix than it won't be that much cheaper than buying regular gas.

Ma fammi capire bene........ tu aggiungeresti 2 litri perch sei basso di livello (ma potevi allora rabboccare prima) o aggiungi 2 litri a un livello gi alto?  Ricordati che superare il livello max non va bene.|`|6eeb28a03a7b894b029c9404e24d77deaa	Se vuoi buttare due litri di olio nuovo si, ma a 20000km, per qualsiasi motore l'olio  esausto, piuttosto cambia olio e filtro vecchi, poi ti compri un filtro che si cambia in 2 minuti e un olio magari pi economico  se vuoi risparmiare ne trovi di tutte le marche negli ipermercati a prezzi onesti e vedrai che l'auto andr bene. Okkio, mettine un po meno del volume prescritto e fai un rabbocco di controllo dopo 2gg. Svuota bene quello vecchio, per circa 20min, se  un p caldo l'olio esce meglio. Ricorda che se cambi tipo e marca di olio devi sempre cambiare i filtro se no l'olio vecchio ivi contenuto si mescoler a quello nuovo.

5s6iZ7OVaa	Too much stroke, too much weight, too much marketing. (For me)    Marketing is what comes into play here; they market a little too strongly so that an uneducated buyer becomes biased against other types of bike.    This happens not only for Harleys, but other motorcycles. Not to mention cars, clothing, etc. A Honda isn't the best car you can buy, but everyone driving one will brag how reliable it is. A VW is a great car, but it's not the best car to maintain. An educated motorcyclist will pick a Harley knowing that it's not the fastest thing, but it's probably comfortable and suits their styling preferences.    Yes, all sportbike riders are gay... Go drive your SUV into a starbucks. Dang those Japanese and their fancy technology!    Some people appreciate having a 16,000 RPM redline and the ability to do a powerwheelie.

Then when they do go for a ride, its a short ride a few miles away, they stop at a bar and spend hours standing next to their bike watching everybody that walks past looking at his bike, its sorry and pathetic to see a Harley owner do that!  I can't understand why they spend $20K for a Harley and they are afraid of riding it cause it might get dirty!  I can understand why they ride short trips a few miles from home, they are afraid to ride far cause they are afraid it will break down, and its closer to push home!|`|pSnI6ywJaa	We believe it, and we would love to help you chrome out your horse!

My friends tend to ride Panheads and don't mind my current Triumph nor the slew of Jap bikes I've owned over the past 30 yrs. mainly because, like them, I do my own work, I ride in all weather and I've got the scars to attest to it.

There are many Honda Goldwing riders that festoon their machines with acres of chrome.  I have heard Wing owners call the accessories as "safety chrome".  Why in the world would you construe an owner wishing to create a machine that is unique as they are a "mental dysfunction?"  That is so wrong on so many levels.  Motorcyclist have customized their machines for decades.  Attend a rally and try to find two machines exactly the same.  Won't happen.  Message to HD Williams the Greatest Unofficial  Harley-Davidson spokesman.  As you know I am one of your biggest supporters.  But to say that and I quote here   " Ya know, if you've never ridden one you wouldn't understand. There's two types of people in this world, those who own Harleys and those that aren't man enough to own one." is so untrue.  I have ridden a couple of Harleys.  One was mediocre and one was just plain horrible.  Couldn't wait to get off the machine.  Every time I sit on an bike from Milwaukee, something is in the wrong spot and hits my legs, or the bars are shaped wrong, or the bike has forward controls.    Here is one more point I wish to make before I sign off.  It doesn't require "manliness" to buy and ride a Harley.  Just a motorcycle endorsement on your license and cash or good credit.  Hate to burst your orange and black bubble, but anyone can buy a Harley.  The question many ask is "why should I buy a Harley?"  For many they find a Harley lacking and buy something that fits their needs better.    I find my GL1800 Honda Goldwing to be a better machine than anything offered by Harley.  It is that simple.|`|fdTgA1Svaa	There are not horses of chrome , they are IRON HORSES. and it is not a mental dysfunction.|`|miyAb7cQaa	Hey you think of your bike how you want and so will they DB.|`|EfxExqrkaa	Hahah yea and they call guys with 'pocket rockets' (proper sport bike's) gays|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I am strictly a dirt rider so I have no real bias on this subject. I have over the years owned a couple Harley's as well as metric sports bikes. For the record I have only owned 2 Harleys out of over 30 total bikes. I have not encountered any Harley owners, and I've been around many of them, that felt they were superior because of the bike they ride. Yes, they love their Harley's but that's personal taste and it's no ones business what another person prefers to ride. This whole thing about Harley riders acting superior is propagated only by small-minded, insecure non Harley riders. It is comments like yours here that keeps this whole thing alive, not the actions of those you choose to pass judgment on. No one that makes remarks like this can possibly be a real motorcycle enthusiast.

This theme underpinned much of Gillies' work. For example, in addition to describing his work in written form, he was the first surgeon to make pictorial records of pre- and post-facial reconstruction cases. Gillies initially undertook this task himself but the job was eventually given to a more accomplished artist, Henry Tonks. Tonks, a surgeon and also a teacher at the Slade School of Art, became the graphic historian of World War l injuries to the face and a noted wartime artist. Unlike his headline seeking cousin Sir Archibald McKindoe who is best remembered for the treatment of Royal Air Force personnel with severe burns, Sir Harold's patients were soldiers of both World Wars, frequently with serious disfiguring facial injuries.  He was instrumental in the layout of the Queens Hospital, Sidcup, where he developed many of the plastics surgery techniques still in use today.  The hospital has a small collection of his drawings which are however sometimes loaned out to other organisations.  It is now a general hospital and was renamed in 1935 as Queen Mary's Hospital, following the death of King George the Fifth.  The address is :-    Queen Marys Hospital NHS Trust  Frognal Avenue  Sidcup,   Kent   DA14 6LT  United Kingdom

The two Pontiac offerings are sporty cars, but they should be compared to other vehicles within their class (and probably to the Integras and Civics you would likely line up against in traffic).

RbCry06Taa	I'll give my share on a technical side - All versions of the triple 7 is the perfect model for the word "state of the art", B-777s are just more advanced in general than B-747s and that speaks a lot in the safety and smoothness aspect of flight. Of course you got the later models of B747s too but since its a lot older (B747 is introduced in the late 60's) its inevitable to fly on older fleets often specially on a 3-star or less airlines.    And probably because of the facts I stated above, B-777s has better safety record than B-747s and in fact the triple 7 has the best safety record of all time. Not that I'm saying 747 is not safe - it wont be the most succesful aircraft model of all time and it wont be dubbed as the queen of the skies if it wasnt safe. It is that considering 777 is now one of the most popular and commonly used aircraft to go along that it has been in service for almost 2 decades now and there has never been a fatal accident involving triple 7s is an amazing feat of safety.|`|AG8XJcLwaa	the 747 is bigger, but more packed together. It is also older, and less technologically advanced. The 777 sometimes has belly cameras of the aircraft.|`|km9cQNAXaa	I doubt there is any gain for the passenger given that the seats in the 777 and the 747 are interchangeable, so no extra room.    The minimum width of the aisle is set for safety reasons and most aircraft are close to the minimum, Increasing this would reduce the number of seats that could be fitted so unlikely to change, so no benefit for the passenger.    The 777 won't get you to your destination any quicker as the cruise speed is set by ATC to maintain separation, usually Mach 0.82 at high altitude. Only on the odd route where there are no other aircraft could this be changed but even then it won't happen as higher speed means higher fuel burn which equals higher cost for the airline, so it won't happen.    The trend towards 2 engines is simply because 2 big engines are cheaper and more fuel efficient than 4 smaller ones.    Ian M|`|U24VtSlZaa	The advantage to the passenger is that the 777 is going where you want to go, and the 747 isn't.    Everything else (seat size, bathroom size, aisle width) is customized by the airline.    Two larger engines will always be more efficient that four smaller engines (all else being equal), in many, many ways.|`|AA10380766	jtexas is right (as usual). However, there is a technical aspect that you may not appreciate until you need it.    The 777 is built to later FAR part 25 standards. The most significant of which is that the seat installations are 16G instead of the older 9G standard. What this means is that they will withstand higher G forces before they collapse orseperate from their mounting points. I don't know what year that requirement took affect, I'd have to take the time to look it up, but only the very latest 747-400 aircraft (within the last 5 years or so)would have been subject to this requirement.
kszkMlcXaa	it really depends on if you think it'll be worth it. the real question is do YOU want to turbo your tc or not? sure there are pros to it, more so on the "i have a turbo in my tc" bragging rights as well as a considerable gain in whp and torque, but there are also a lot of negatives to it as well. for one, you'll have to start pumping premium only, two you run the risk of your engine crapping out on you way sooner than it normally would, three is that now your car requires a lot more maintenance, etc.     there is good along with the bad, so its actually up to you to decide. in my personal opinion, if i had the money to burn than yes, i would do it. mainly because for a car that costs considerably less (even with a turbo install) than an sti or evo, depending on the kit and the tune you'd be able to at least hang with them.|`|JEteneuUaa	Trade in for a 2009 and turbo it up.|`|IXwLDBhUaa	what kind of turbo are you buying for everything to come close to $9000 anyways? 2006 turbo for a tC is cheaper than an 07+ but there are alot of good ones.

Some use derricks, cranes or gantries either singly or in pairs, depending on the cargo configuration. There are a variety of lifting machines, and each varies depending on what it's designed to lift. Some heavy-lift ships partially submerge, and the object to be lifted is towed over the deck of the ship, and the ship then pumps ballast and rises out of the water, with the cargo floating up as it settles onto the deck. In addition, there are LO-LO (load on-load off), RO-RO (roll on-roll off) and LASH (lighter aboard ship) heavy lift ship types too. Globalsecurity.org has a nice review of these.
wpgRMjgraa	Safe driving tips to help pass your road test:    STEERING Steer smoothly whether you are driving straight ahead, turning or backing up.    ACCELERATION Accelerate smoothly and moderately. Don't race the engine or cause it to stall.    BRAKING Bring the vehicle to a stop gently. Start braking well before your stopping position to avoid "jerky" stops. Make sure you stop your vehicle in the proper position of the lane.    CLUTCH/GEAR Always be sure your vehicle is in the correct gear. With either an automatic or a manual transmission, shift into the proper gear at the right time without "grinding" the gears.    SPEED Obey the posted speed limit, of course, but also adjust your speed properly due to weather, road, visibility and traffic conditions.    FOLLOWING DISTANCE Keep an adequate space "cushion" between your vehicle and those you are following. Use the "two second rule" described in the Driver's Manual. Be sure to increase your following distance in poor weather or visibility.    TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES Know the meanings of signs, signals and pavement markings, and obey them consistently.    STOPPING POSITION If a stop is required, stop your vehicle before it reaches an intersecting street. If stop lines or crosswalks are present, stop before crossing them. If your view is blocked after stopping behind the crosswalk, move up until you can clearly see your way, then stop again if necessary.    LANE SELECTION AND POSITION Keep your vehicle in the proper traffic lane, especially when preparing to make turns. Don't allow room for another vehicle to pass you on the side that you are turning toward.    COMMUNICATION Let other drivers and pedestrians know which way you want to go. Use your directional signals or horn consistently and at the proper times.    OBSERVATION Look for and identify potential problems or hazards in the traffic around you - not just straight ahead, but behind you and on either side. Check your mirrors frequently, but be sure to look over your shoulder behind you when changing lanes or backing up.    ANTICIPATE & REACT TO OTHERS Anticipate possible driving errors by others and be ready to react safely to make up for their mistakes.|`|EWnNzdRmaa	TAKE IT EASY DONT TALK TOO MUCH WITH EXAMINER FEEL LIKE UR GOING HOME FROM JOB AND the person sitting besides u is ur coworker and ur droping him /her home...Cheer will work fore sure

wpgRMjgraa	Yes.........    The loss in value of a damaged vehicle is known as Diminished Value.     The amount of Diminished Value of a damaged and repaired vehicle depends upon several factors including: the pre-loss value of the vehicle, the nature and severity of the damages and the cost, manner and thoroughness of the performed repairs.     If the repairs are done thoroughly and in a workmanlike manner, the value of the vehicle can be maximized to the best of reasonable human ability but likely never to its pre-loss value.    If the repairs are done to less than thorough and workmanlike standards, the recovery in value will be limited accordingly, and the vehicle will suffer a greater loss or diminishment in value.    The more significant the damages, the greater the loss in value. The poorer the repair quality, the less recovery of the vehicles original and pre-loss value.    In order to make this determination you should secure the services of an independent professional to perform a visual inspection of the vehicle and prepare an expert assessment of your remaining loss.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Absolutely.    Even if it's been fixed, there's bound to be things still wrong with it somewhere.    Think about it this way. The car was a unibody. Designed as one solid structure, in the beginning.    Now, that structure has been damaged. Without completely replacing that one structure, it will never be 100% the same again.    A wrecked vehicle? Take about 25% off it's listed value. If they'll even take it on a trade in.|`|Nyzb6cLraa	Depends. If the body work is good then you might be ok. However, there could be other damage that you don't see yet. If the car was given a salvage title and then you rebuilt it so it was road legal again, that would have a devastating effect on the resale value because of the rebuilt title versus a clean title car. However, cars generally lose their value very quickly anyway.     In short, someone who doesn't know cars very well might not notice and be ok with any work done. But if the person who did all the repairs, did a shady job (which some do), the body work can fall apart over time. If it's not done correctly, someone with a trained eye would be able to see the slightest imperfections. You are probably ok though. If it's a trade in, you are going to be jipped no matter what. Dealerships do that. It's how they make their money.

5427036efac063a7732d113e0750bf0faa	Call around to a few shops and ask what their tune-up will cost, and also what they will do to the car for the tune-up. Don't rule out the dealership service center, they're often close or even lower priced than the high quality independent shops. The tune-up specialty shops may not be ideal, as some will use untrained workers.    Prices will vary some from shop to shop, as well as the services performed for what they call a tune-up.|`|434ae21c53144cc6040a9999bb94dfc6aa	250. with parts
dQrBlk4qaa	The previous post has a pretty good answer!    I'll add a little. Check the temperature sending unit. When it starts to short out, it can hit "dead" spots, where the temp doesn't change. I would suspect this, since the ECM uses it to monitor engine temperature, and adjust the fuel mapping accordingly.     With the starting problem, try waiting a little longer between turning the key from "acc" to "start". This should give the fuel pump a little extra time to properly pressurize the fuel rail - this might be a symptom of one of your fuel injectors developing a slow leak. When the car is stopped, that leaking injector will depressurize the fuel rail, causing the prolonged starting problem. Before you look further, try dumping a bottle of fuel injector cleaner into your next two gas fill-ups and see if this resolves the problem. If it continues, repost, and you'll hear all the next things you can look for.    By the way - your sticking temp gauge and difficult starting may be interrelated. If your temp sending unit is faulty, it will fool your ECM into thinking the engine is warmer than it is - resulting in the timing/fuel map being incorrect. Once the temp unit is fixed, you may find your starting problem is resolved.|`|ug0mGhAfaa	Hi, well I had a 2002 Grand Am SE, and these cars have alot of electrical problems. Supposedly there was some low quality wiring used, which will cause the car to have electrical problems in different areas, so for the temp gage, fixing the switch may not fix the problem. In my GA, once I was driving and ALL of the gages started going back and forward (like windshield wipers) at once. Also had problems with power windows, and the turn signal sound clicking constantly!!     As for the starting problems, try checking the starter fluid, fuel filter, and spark plugs.     I loved my GA, but eventually I couldn't afford to keep fixing little things on it, so I sold it :'( but good luck with yours..    Also look on gaownersclub.com in the forums they have tons of problems and solutions.|`|e34ec130ff0f1fd7cdba13b91612b6aeaa	where the hell is starting fluid in my car, and how do i check it?    ok i've actually had this problem. my temp gauge got stuck at 100 and wouldnt move. i didnt do anything after a few days it just started working again on its own. i've asked other grand am owners and same thing for them. it just starts working again for no reason. i'd just ride it out and see what happens, and hopefully it fixes itself.    good luck

TdrgZwnoaa	I'd rather be caught CUMMIN than POWERSTROKING.    or      I'd rather be STROKED than RAMMED.     And the debate rages on. Simply put, the current CUMMINS engine is more powerfull than either of the other two offerings. I drive a 40 passenger bus with the same 6.7 CUMMINS engine that goes into the Dodge Rams. The only difference is in the turbo inter-cooler configuration. And this thing is a torque monster. We have 138 of these buses and to date have not had one significant problem with any of them. And they do get worked. Full throttle acceleration is the norm as is extended highway use.|`|AA11264416	one thing i say to powerstroke and cummings........ cummstroke this    i've had a chevy 2500HD pull my work truck out of the mud, the work truck was a Sterling dual axle commercial truck, had a 24 foot bed and 10 speed, the 2500HD was completely stock    Cummings - you say the dodge pulled a fully loaded pete up a gravel hill, i can believe that since the Pete was also had its wheels spinning, all the dodge truck did was give it a little extra pull up the hill, i bet if the Pete was in neutral the dodge wouldn't have moved it one inch|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Personal preference.

My Sunday truck is a Powerstroke with 91,000 and I've had no problems with it either.  So, with all of that said it seems as though your personal opinion about Cummins is exactly that...your opinion based on little fact it seems.  I think than no diesel is particularly better than another, but the interior of a Dodge is cheap and will fall apart after little use considering the life of the engine.|`|DAilkzubaa	Dumb *** people like duramax because dumb *** people are dumb. My dodge with a cummins pulled my dads peterbuilt with a loaded end dump up a steep gravel hill and that is better than some Isuzumax 3000 rpm 200 lb ft of torque piece of japanese junk. If chevy had a C7 Caterpillar and a solid front axle then I wouldnt be talkin down so much on them. But they have a no good engine and IFS front suspension. They are rated at a good amount of torque but the rpm is crazy and if you think that they can pull better, than watch a Cummins and a isuzumax rated at the same lb ft of torque pull something that weighs the same. Cummins makes more power at less rpm period. Cummins also gets more mpg, lasts longer, pulls harder, and is better in every way. cylinders dont make power-fuel does. stroke makes torque. Cummins has a longer stroke and a bigger bore. Just a better design and everyone knows it.|`|sJHCOgjfaa	well think u answered that yourdelf because they are dumb lol xx
dPLkNRNuaa	Your claim is worth what its worth regardless  if you have an attorney.  The value of your claim is based on the injury itself. Not the presence or absence of an attorney.     An attorney usually takes 1/3 of any settlement you get as his fee. When an adjuster evaluates your claim - they don't add 1/3 so you get the same amount of pocket money. In order for the attorney to benefit you...he has to get the insurance company to pay more than 1/3 of what they would have paid with out the attorney. That usually does not happen. Most of the time, the insurance company is going to pay the same amount either way.    If you chose to hire an attorney....it's your job to pay him. Not the insurance company.     My two cents worth....continue to work with the insurance company. If at any time...you want to say "heck with you" and decide it's worth it to give 1/3 of your settlement away - go hire an attorney then.  But an attorney is no guarantee that you will end up leaving with more money in your pocket.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	You should do the honest thing.

I7NkFJo2aa	Why not, if all the documentation is in place and the builder is competent, and the boat is well built and has legal compliance plates fitted.  Problems arise with backup in the future, and the legal liabilities of the builder go on for many many years.  The issue of compliance with your intended market's legislative requirements is critical, and will get you shut down in the blink of an eye if you do not cross every ' t ' and dot every ' i '.    Full photographic records of every individual boat built are easy in this day of digital cameras and so on - and a comprehensive listing of all materials and techniques used at every major step could be a lifesaver should some idiot buy your boat, overload/power it and kill someone - and then try to sue your bum off.     This is why it is now much harder to just start in the back yard,  On the one hand the cowboys and shonks are getting kept out of the business a lot better, but on the other it is very expensive to get started and hard to make actual profits for a while for the genuine startup business.    If you can work for a good shipwright for long enough to get your own reputation that will help from an industry and marketing point of view, and sometimes you can end up taking over the business - it does happen that way occasionally.  Just be very sure to tell the employer right from the start that your eventual plan is to run your own boat building business, you want no confusion as to your motives and loyalty, nor is it honest to not tell people with a financial interest in you like an employer what your plan is.  If you are very clear on what it is that you want to achieve and have a defined time frame then they can plan around their training  investment they have to make in you, and decide if they want to let you see their methods and business setup.    Either way it will be a lot of work, and I wish you the very best of luck.    Hope you make it work.    Anyway, who said anything about fibreglass??

You say quality control will be just as good. But what guarantee of that, is there?    I've seen plenty of shops open up in their own garage, with that same claim, and there's simply no comparison of their work to someone licensed to do it.    Which also begs the question, do you have the licensing to make water-born craft? Lot of safety inspections have to be done, I'd imagine.|`|euXfb9aGaa	Nope. No chance in hell.|`|Ht1aY8THaa	Yes I would buy a boat from a home/ garage workshop, if you are a liscenced builder. Just like homemade kit cars, boats also need to be inspected before they can be registered. Therefor, the only way I would buy the vessel was if the manufacturer, you the builder, registered it before the sale. Now, even though it seems to be a good buy if it is already registered and inspected, there are still ways to get around the full inspection and the buyers need to be aware of that. Just like kit cars, there are some crooked people that work for the department of motor vehicles that if paid, they will look past the inspection and register the boat anyway. Be aware of what you are buying, look it over for yourself and if you are a first time boat buyer, do your research before you go to look at the boat so you know what to look for. Ask the builder questions, ask to look at his liscence to build the vessel, ask to look  at the inspection paperwork and look at it carefully. Ask to see the registration paperwork and make sure the vessel is registered and inspected BEFORE YOU PAY FOR IT. Be smart on how you run your new business and to the buyers, be smart on how you use your hard earned money.|`|BAR7SOmtaa	Many businesses have started in peoples garages or basements,  it is a good way to keep your costs down and concentrate on the quality of the product.   several well known boats have started life that way such as the Cal 20 and the J24.    Since you would most likely be a one or two man operation at first the quality control, will literally be in your hands and it will make you, or break you. At first because of your low overhead you will have a cost advantage over your competitors, this will go away when you build your workshop and hire more people|`|eQyNfRXcaa	I would happily buy a boat built by another person depending on quality, lines, design and style. I am of the opinion that boats designed for a specific purpose (Cruising, Racing, Rowing) with a good design and at a reasonable price are difficult to come buy in the market anyway and the cost of them is usually very high. A few questions come to mind such as; What type of material do you plan to use? (Wood, Aluminum, Fiberglass), are you building from plans or designing your own? what type of construction and profiles are you building?|`|moECfjDkaa	Yes, I would.  My stepdad said he was going to start building picnic tables in our garage and I said no one would ever buy them.  To my surprise, they did.  I think the main thing you have to do is show people your work and promote it. If they see it's quality work then I'm sure you'll have plenty of customers.|`|Aysd0s3Faa	let me just say thats how C.N.

kOCtAVXwaa	Look at my user name for a little hint.    I have owned the whole array of cars.  I have a supercharged e46 m3 now, is quite quick, but nothing to the quality and technology of Audi.      Audi makes a very solid car, and I would think if your even thinking of going All Wheel Drive, you would basically just go for an Audi.      BMW is the same quality and mercedes.  Audi VW and Porsche are in there own crowd, above those other competitors.    I dont know your price range. But here are the following options from me cheapest to most expensive:  1. 2000-2002 B5 S4  2. 2003-2005 B6 S4  3. 2006-2008 B7 S4  4. 2008-2009 B7 RS4 ($$)    The only car BMW makes that I have a tiny bit of love for is the M3's.  If I wanted a big car it wouldnt be a 7 series, it would be an S8.  If I wanted a 328I, it would be a A4/S4 chassis.    Good luck.

The C30 emphasizes sportiness over practicality.  In terms of reliability, that's iffy.  Volvo has been using the 5cyl. engine in the C30 since the early 90's and it's a fantastic motor.

The speedsensor wire will enter the transmission on the driver side, at the rear of the transmission, in the tailhousing.  Check this connector, make sure it's on tight, and nothing is rubbing the wire or shorting it out.      If that doesn't fix the issue, then remove and replace the instrument cluster (not replace as in buy a new one, but just replace as in put the old one back).  You'll need a 7mm & a 10mm, 1/4in socket and a 1/4 socket driver.  Remove the lower dash cover under the steering wheel with the 10mm, there are 3 screws (these could be Torx bits instead of 10mm bolts).  Next carefully pop the outer plastic covering from the the outside of the cluster - you'll have to remove the cigarette lighter wiring, and maybe another wire on the driver side.  Wiggle the cover off around the steering column.  Now you can see the 7mm screwheads that hold the cluster in place.  Once the screws are removed, the cluster just pops out - carefully.  There are a few larger connectors that make contact with each other when the cluster is in place - wipe these off and replace the cluster carefully and making sure the cluster contacts pop correctly to the dashboard contacts.  Check the speedo (and other guages) too see if that helped.     http://www.thirdgen.org for all your 1982 - 1992 Camaro/Firebird questions.

MoUtk7cUaa	depends on the smoke.  generally blueish smoke means you're burning oil.  this is a usually piston ring or head gasket issue. it could also be poor gas mix.|`|9F76AUgfaa	someone told me recently one reason this happens is because the car hasn't had a decent run for a while|`|WzKrZoHQaa	you could have put too much oil in it and it is trying hard to burn off the excess or sounds expensive.|`|0SlYZRSuaa	it could be your head gasket or it could be your anti-freeze going into your oil. how you check that is tha tyou look at your oil dipstick and if its green with black its mostly a head gasket|`|aAdmCZAyaa	Wrong fuel?|`|J9NS0Br2aa	It can be a number of things, does it only smoke when u first start it up and the engine is cold, or smokes all the time. The worse it could be is if the engine has done many many miles it could do with a full engine rebuild, the piston rings or the cylinder bores are worn. The valve seals in the cylinder head could need replacing, the valves stems could be worn mean in new valves and stems.|`|fk8wXA3Saa	White smoke indicates a blown head gasket (after the engine warms up )  Black smoke indicates worn rings|`|1lsvWj6zaa	there is only one thing that makes the exhaust smoke and that im afraid is the engine
7274403b2b4f83ec6c150a8f7b80a02aaa	Since I have to be the tie breaker and I know more about Suzuki's then either of the previous two....    Grand Vitara's have 4x4 as a option but it is not standard, so no, all do not have 4x4.|`|mKVFIklaaa	Absolute rubbish: All Grand Vitara models are 4 wheel drive. The 3dr models have permanent automatic 4wd, the 5 door have a more complex dual range 4wd system.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	No the 2wd ones don't have 4wd.

AA10735939	The link isn't working but hell NO!  Way too expensive!  Look for a Dodge Stealth, it's the same car as the 3000 GT but it will be cheaper.  It's all in the name.|`|LTlx22njaa	Its a good car.  only problem with the Dodge stealth is they stopped making them in 1996.  And 43K miles is pretty good on that car.|`|Zw8YRnxfaa	although many people do not think that the 3000 gt is a good car, it is. it is reliable as well as very sporty and blindingly quick. a manual transmission would be my first choice however if you are looking for a commuter car, an automatic will be just fine. happy car shopping :)|`|a0PPw5aOaa	Thats not a bad price for that mileage for a VR4 if the car is in perfect condition, but if its a base model or SL it would be way too much. The link you posted doesn't work so can't help much. If you don't know, the VR4 is twin turbo awd, 320hp, the SL is fwd non-turbo dohc, at 222hp and the base model is fwd, sohc motor with I think about 190hp.
zhJOZhKEaa	Legal wise you need to check on your state's law... a few may not allow him to be there at all but most will if it is the only option.  If you will post your state I will hunt down the law for you.    Safety wise... if you *must* use the seat for a child push it back as far as it will go and be sure to use the safest carseat type available for your child's size.  I'm hoping your five year old is still in a harnessed carseat... if not you may want to consider purchasing a seat with high harness weight to keep him safer longer: http://www.cpsafety.com/articles/Over40....  Even race car drivers still use a 5 point harness... they know what they would prefer for their own safety in the event of a crash.    Also... it is often recommended to put the most protected child in the least protected spot.  For example a baby in rearfacing carseat is protected well because he is rearfacing... you can save the very safe rear center spot for a forward facing toddler and put the baby on one of the rear sides.      With the front seat... I might not really feel good about putting a baby there.  However if your 5 yr olds carseat *is* only a booster seat... I would certainly at least consider putting him in a safer seating position and putting a more protected child up front.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Well since you have a 4-door vehicle yes..it would be a lot safer and legal to let your child ride in the rear behind the passengers seat.........|`|AA11352641	You need to check with your state laws regarding this. You can probably call the nearest police station (non-emergency) and inquire. I don't think it's the safest spot, but it may be legal.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	As long as the passenger side air bag is shut off and the seat belt is on he is fine. Just drive carefully.|`|AA11014910	You'll get a ticket if they catch you in the State of Nevada. Such an offense comes with a hefty fine. You could even lose your drivers license.|`|PE1k59pcaa	most states do not allow children under 10yrs.100lbs to ride in front seat unless its a pick up truck with regular cab. check with your local police dept. be safe about this !!!|`|LsAArkUyaa	Why didn't you just buy a vehicle that can't safely transport all of your children?

AA12137001	Actually, Norah, the problems are nothing to do with the vehicles, it's the person behind the wheel.    Far too many people still drive appallingly as if the roads were as dry as a bone and the sun was shining.    I left earlier for work, took my time, had a little difficulty with a very icy hill but still managed to negotiate it.    I had so much time in fact that, when I witnessed an accident, I was able to stop safely and assist the lady whose scooter had skidded. thankfully she wasn't badly hurt and a day of rest would have been good for her twisted ankle.    I still got to work 40 minutes before time.    It's all about patience, leaving enough time to get to a destination and most importantly, do I need to go out today or should I take the bus and leave the car at home for one day (or two)?    I like the Weisssock covers and, at 50, not too expensive for the odd heavy snowfall.    Take care on the roads, everyone.|`|bp59GQ0yaa	Because in the UK they would very rarely get used so people do not have them.  As the majority of times we get snow in the UK it is cleared very quickly or does not lay for long and "winter" tyres or chains would be no good and would actually cause more problems than they would solve.    Chains and winter tyres are used in countries where the snow and ice covers the roads "properly" and is a normal annual occurence.|`|4LZY5eOQaa	Think that studded tyres are illegal in uk they didn't used to be as i remember having a mini van in the late 70s fitted with four it went everywhere but lost the studs very quickly snow chains are a pain to put on and can fly off, if you want grip buy a 4x4 the honda crv is very good and will cope with the weather that we have at the moment no problem mine does.|`|2016b2eff949f27f73d7f010484e92fcaa	Here in London it usually snows one day a year, and that's if we are lucky. Im 17 and this week was my first time to see more than 1 inch of snow.     A bit of grit on the roads should have sorted out our problem on Monday. Most roads weren't gritted and that's when we needed it most. We get days with a cm of snow, or a bit of frost and the roads get gritted, but it was a different story on Monday when we needed it the most.    Snow chains is more likely to be used in Scotland because it snows more up north. And I understand it being used in places like Russia and Canada. There's no point drivers getting snow chains for one day of snow in the south of the UK when we hardly get snow.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	It's probably because we don't get as much snow as they do.|`|xDPQ700baa	Because it hardly ever snows here and to be honest I have been getting around OK. You can get around OK in this weather, its just the country as a collective is a big sissy and scared of elf n safety.    Now then, where do I keep them until I need them?|`|jGmMoPrsaa	Hi  Not every one can afford snow tyre's,and regarding snow chains these are no longer legal in the uk,i used to use them in bad conditions but i now use my 4x4|`|AA11842064	snow tyres would be too expensive but a set of weisssock covers are only 40 and work fine got me to work this week     http://www.snowchains.co.uk/main/weissso...    snow chains are legal and still sold in UK|`|I6yyhbu2aa	Is it worth all the cost for normally a few days of snow, remember in the UK we come to a complete standstill at the sign of a snowflake, I would not spend out on winter tyres and I would not fit chains because I am not stupid enough to drive in heavy snow conditions.|`|9QoKdTChaa	Because they're British and anything logical is for them out of question.|`|OKVRwX2Caa	Because if you did you'd still get stuck behind a idiot who hadn't|`|0a7Xy2ygaa	Because they are not cost effective. Where I live we have had snow for the first time since 1996. Before that we had now in 1991. In that time I have had 3 cars all with different size tyres............|`|d0231dcc170bb0de07aee5020b49aeeaaa	Because it does not snow that much usually, normal snow in Britain would come and go in a day or so ans if it was the slushy type that is normal in Britain then snow tyres would not make that much difference, I live in Switzerland and snow tyres work best on SNOW that is a good layer that it crisp so the tyres can grip it, snow tyres are not too good in the rain and if the roads are dry they wear quickly, so it would be an expensive thing for a day or two and I do not think most Brits would be happy to have a set of tyres doing nothing, like me I have an old Ford car that is worth 1000 and 600 worth of tyres.

ojxfzv7Faa	That's just the high-occupancy vehicle lane or carpool lane.    If you don't have 2+ people in your vehicle, you can just stay out of them.    If 2+ people in the car, you can use them.|`|AA10860286	See, this is where GPS does not help you. There is only one road that leads non-stop from La Jolla to Los Angeles. That road is Interstate 5. On Interstate 5, there are sections that have a carpool (HOV) lane. Just don't get in that lane. There are other roads that you can take once you get into Orange County, such as the 405 and the 91, both of which lead into Los Angeles. They also have HOV lanes. Again, stay out of them. They are clearly marked. There is no charge to drive in these HOV lanes if you have more than one person in the car, but if you get caught in them alone, you will get a ticket. There are a very limited number of actual pay toll roads in Orange County and part of Riverside County, but unless you are very lost, you will not encounter them on your trip. You will only pass the exits for them.

My wife is Japanese and i have spent a lot of time in Japan. I've traveled widely, by train, in japan, over many years. I've heard of the "pushers" on Tokyo subways but have never seen them on the regular surface trains. The way people crowd onto the surface trains during peak hours though you'd sometimes think that there were "pushers" at work.|`|kLOXhmjDaa	Oh yeah they exist!    With so many people, its a necessary duty. To us westerners, the practice goes against the grain of our social "rights". Here in Chicago if you tried cramming people into one another you'd incite a pretty violent train ride. Then again, despite our hectic commute, we don't deal with crowds quite the size of Japan's.
E7e0Ur3Uaa	Most likely a  valve lifter boss, especially with low oil pressure. I've seen quite a few go in the 4.3s. Pop the valve covers off (not too difficult) and try to rock the rocker arms, if any of them have excessive play, that's the collapsed lifter. I don't know how mechanically inclined you are but the lifters have to be replaced by taking the lower intake manifold off. However, these are expensive and you might want to take care of that oil pressure issue or else your lifters are going to be dropping like flies. Try some straight 30 weight oil to start.
sx9ZRdHBaa	most mits. are reliable.  if i were you i would see if you could take it  to a mechanic first just to get an estimate for the repairs and to make sure nothing else is going to break on you.  i can tell you that you will need to replace the water pump for sure and thats not going to be a cheep repair.  but if you really wanted a "daily" driver that you dont have to put premium fuelin, and you dont mind replacing the water pump, then yest ehis will be a good car|`|1SnI86BIaa	the water pump/tiers/tune up will be another  800 bucks right there..    go to a galant forum, and ask them
Rwn0svq0aa	The Mazda 3 is well built. Mine is nearly 4 years old with over 50,000 miles on the clock. It is reliable transportation. I am never one to be satisfied with a stock economy car. What I like most about Mazda is that it can be customized into becoming "My Mazda." Mazda manufacturing  instills enough stout lightweight materials for dual use, a capable weekend racer as well as an everyday driver. Where I am most pleased is engine response, alongside performance upgrades that enhance performance potential. It is a naturally aspirated quick car. I can afford to pump gas  in a 12.5 gallon tank that gives me 300 miles in the city to 380-400 miles on the road cruising at 70-80 mph.|`|wcS84lBGaa	I don't have a mazda3, but I do have an MPV.     Mazda's are solidly built, and I have had very few problems so far (5 years ownership). Service from the dealer is very good compared to VW dealerships also.    The mazda3's are pretty sharp looking IMHO.|`|AA11619843	small good looking car and its also fast.   depends on what trim level of mazda 3 you get.|`|5xmH6HDeaa	i think i WOULD be ridin with you !!! lol jkjk itz a nice car!!!  i drive a G6 o8'|`|SEovr8BZaa	I love mine. They are practical, well built and are great on gas! They come with great standard features such as, Bose sound system (for a touring), advanced air bag system! Although, if you are a boy I would suggest a 5-door also known as a hatchback model. If I were a girl i would get a 4-door. If you want extra speed get the Mazdaspeed3 which comes with more options. I just think they are sporty and great! If you are considering buying one right off the showroom floor, be advised that Mazda has redesigned the 3 for 2010 and is coming out soon. Motor Trend did a review on it for the February 2009 issue. It is nice....check it out!  Good Luck!|`|g4n7fg4zaa	I LOVE the Mazda 3 since they released the 2004 model. Of course with 1st models of 1st generations they're bound to have some problems. It's a good thing that you're willing to invest into a newer model. But you don't need to buy the 2009 model, when you can get the 2007. They're the 2nd models of 1st generations and are only 2 years and I guarantee you'll save a couple of thousands and you'll also save on your premium. You keep hunting, you may find an '07 GT with the GFX package for the same price you'd get on '09 GX.    But if you're really insisting on the 2009 model, why not get the 2010? I know some people have different feelings towards the 2nd generation, but you should check them out. If you're in Canada, I know they were released a week or two ago, you'll see them in the Mazda dealers.    Good luck!|`|ApLNBuPlaa	my friend owns one, well first if u lookin 4 a lil speed they r nice. my friends got a 07 and its got a lil get up and go i like that and u can hold 5 people in it e z. its got alot of room 4 a lil car we go snowboreding evry weekend and we put 4 boreds in it and our other stuff  and it holds us all and that this is great on gas. i say get that ****|`|jERevyR8aa	all mazda's are great cars  i own a CX-7 and it is one of my favorite cars i've driven  they are all very solid, safe, and have great standard features    p.s. a brand new 2010 model of that car s coming out soon so you may want to wait on that  there's pictures of it on the mazda website|`|gKRLXuXvaa	I have a Mazda3 and its the best in its class.

I've had it for almost a year and I still find myself just staring at it dreamily..It manages to look cute and sporty at the same time. It's fast, it's small, it's quiet, it's amazing. Make sure you hold off buying a car until you find one that you find yourself dreaming about and feel a pang of jealousy when you see one on the street. Like saving sex for your wedding night, it will be all that much better when you finally get it.
muPiBQ3Uaa	Disconnecting the battery will not clear OBD II codes.    Most likely, the problem began with an over-oiled K&N filter, which contaminated the MAF. The MAF can be cleaned with a special spray cleaner, but if the filter is over-oiled again, the problem will return.    The codes must be cleared using a proper scan tool, then the vehicle must be driven to reset the module monitors. This can take up to 3 days of normal driving.    I would suggest having the codes cleared by a competent shop, then driving to reset the monitors, after you have re-installed the OEM air filter.|`|1SnI86BIaa	disconnect battery overnight|`|ZBVMT11maa	Yeah reset your ECU should only take about 45 mins. but overnight will work too. Just disconnect the neg side of yoru battery and it should clear out the codes, you can stop by autozone to check it for you again after you connect it back up.       The thing with K&N filters and the MAF is the oil used to clean and keep the K&N filter can mess up with you MAF if not properly oiled correctly. Meaning too much oil can mess up and make your MAF go bad due too much oil.|`|l80bH2TYaa	These codes have to be cleared with a scan tool.If these codes come up again, like this, you may need a new pcm. If this is the case, take it to the dealer and let them diagnose it and replace it because it will have to be programmed.

Sash.|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	Wouldn't try asking the station as the first answer suggests.

6xyeYjkkaa	There are no AC outlets unless you installed them along with a power inverter. The power outlets are 12 Volts DC from the vehicles battery.|`|AA11404742	A fuse blows when there's too much power through the circuit.  You might be overloading it with whatever you plug in, or the fuse itself is too small, or you have a short circuit.      Check the owner's manual - it will tell you what size the fuse should be.  Then check the fuse to be sure you have it right.    Then check whatever you're plugging in - if it draws more amps than the circuit is rated for, it's your own fault they keep blowing.    If neither of these fix it, take it to a shop to look for a short circuit.  It might be that that fuse is all that's keeping your Liberty from turning into a pile of smoldering metal on the side of the road.

ZfhYinw2aa	It depends on several factors: What state?  What year of manufacture?  Where do you hope to ride?  Many states are following California's lead and require some sort of registration and certification.  If you are using it only on private lands - your property, or closed course race tracks, it often doesn't have to comply with standards.  If you stay off-road (watch out for technicalities here!), you should not need DOT certification, but on state and/or federal lands (including privately owned National Forrest), you might need EPA/CARB or similar certification.  Finally, older bikes might fall under grandfather clauses and not require emission or noise certification.|`|pN0EOoepaa	Depends on the state you register it in. OHV must be registed within the state you bing it to.     I know in CA its not worth the trouble. My uncle bought a CR450F in canada had it imported and CA wouldnt let him register it, that means he couldnt ride it.|`|miyAb7cQaa	Depends on the state you live in.|`|OIREN5Jeaa	It really depends on what state you live in.

4b4d4f3bfe33461a02daa163629ada22aa	THe black carbon build-up is an indication of improper air-fuel mixture. With a lot of carbon build up on the valves, and in the combustion chamber, you probably have caused an increase in compression ratio. With the proper ignition timing and the correct spark plug heat range, the air fuel mixture should self adjust until the tail pipe burns clean and free of carbon particles. First check would be to verify the correct plugs and ignition timing.  Then you should check the fuel injection unit and exhaust gases for the correct chemistry via a smog check.  That would include, O2, CO2, HC, CO, NOx.  A malfunctioning Catalytic Converter can also cause this kind of problem and would show failures in the smog check analysis.

Bad sensor, for the wheels, or a bad pump for the abs system.  Or even a bad module.  But, its best to get it diagnosed first before just replacing unnecessary parts.|`|pwfy6gbBaa	check ur sensors they could be bad.

kOrYXVedaa	U want the ENTIRE STORY,here it is:  Harley Quinn (Dr. Harleen Quinzel) is a fictional character, a supervillainess, in the animated series Batman: The Animated Series, later adapted into DC Comics' Batman comic books. As suggested by her name (a play on the word "harlequin"), she is clad in the manner of a traditional harlequin jester. The character is a frequent accomplice and would-be-girlfriend of Batman's nemesis the Joker, and is also a close ally of supervillainess Poison Ivy.    The character was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm and was voiced in the Batman: The Animated Series and its tie-ins by Arleen Sorkin, and most recently by Hynden Walch on The Batman. In the Birds of Prey series, she was portrayed by actress Mia Sara.

A female follower of the Joker was thus created. Arleen Sorkin, formerly starring in the soap opera Days of our Lives, appeared in a dream sequence in which she wore a jester costume - Dini used this scene as an inspiration, writing the character specifically so Sorkin could voice her. Dini, who had been friends with Sorkin for years, incorporated aspects of her personality into the character. Sorkin's portrayal of Harley appears to be not only her own persona and quirks, but also seems to be a semi-caricature of actress Judy Holliday.    The 1994 graphic novel Mad Love recounts the character's origin. It reveals that Joker intended to twist her mind as a joke because her name was close sounding to the word harlequin, a clown character in commedia dell'arte. Told in the style and continuity of Batman: The Animated Series and written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book describes Harley as an Arkham Asylum psychiatrist who falls in love with the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again girlfriend. The story received wide praise [1] and won the Eisner and Harvey Awards for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year. The New Batman Adventures series adapted Mad Love as the episode "Mad Love" in 1999, making it the third "animated style" comic book adapted for the series (the others being Holiday Knights and "Joker's Millions").    As portrayed in the comic, she becomes fascinated with the Joker while interning at Arkham, and volunteers to analyze him. She falls in love nearly instantly with the Joker during their sessions. After helping him escape from the asylum more than once, she is caught by her superiors, who revoke her license and put her in her own cell. During an earthquake in Gotham City, she flees and becomes Harley Quinn, the Joker's partner-in-crime.      [edit] Expanded role  After Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the web cartoon Gotham Girls. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons of the DC Animated Universe, appearing in the Justice League episode "Wild Cards" (alongside the Joker) and the Static Shock episode "Hard as Nails" (alongside Poison Ivy).    She appeared in World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie as a rival and foil of sorts for Lex Luthor's assistant Mercy Graves; each has a mutual immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's climax, Harley nearly kills Mercy when she duct tapes her mouth shut and tapes her to the top of a gigantic killer android, although she is rescued and untied by Batman and Superman. At the conclusion, Harley is taken away in a padded ambulance screaming, "I want a lawyer! I want a doctor! I want a cheese sandwich!"; Mercy chuckles "Now that's funny!" as she watches Harley get locked away on TV.    In issue  16 of the Batman Adventures comic series, Harley is almost married to the Joker. Ivy crashes the wedding and tries to kill the Joker, only to be stopped by Batgirl.

ESY1pBnPaa	The biggest legitimate swap would be a J-series V6 engine.  They are anywhere from 3.0L to 3.5L engines, depending on what car you get them from.  Hasport makes a mount kit for this swap now, but there still isn't a ton of info about it.  You'd have to figure out the wiring yourself, which would basically mean rewiring your entire car.  You'd need to find a custom hood, or cut a big hole in your hood to clear the valve cover.  You would also need to get some axles welded together, because currently no companies make aftermarket axles for this swap.  But unless you have the money, time on your hands, and knowledge enough to be able to pull it off correctly, it's going to be way too much for an engine swap.    The next biggest engine would be one of the K24 engines; found in newer Accords, CR-V's, Acura TSX, & Honda Elements.  This is going to be a very pricey swap.  You'd need custom axles, an aftermarket mount kit, do wiring, Hondata K-Pro if you have an ECU with an immobilizer.  A lot of people spend upwards of $10,000 or more for these swaps (usually with K20A heads on the blocks).    The next step would be the H22A.  Yet again you'll need to buy an aftermarket mount kit, custom axles, and to do some wiring (not nearly as much as the previous 2 swaps mentioned).    Then on to the realistic swaps for people who are new to swapping engines, or at least swapping engines in Hondas; the B-series.  The B-series engines are 1.6L's, 1.8L's, and 2.0L's.  They are very easy to swap in, and only require stock Civic mounts, an Integra (or just B-series) driver's side mount and rear mount bracket, B-series axles and shiftlinkage, and the correct ECU for the engine.  Basically as easy as replacing a stock engine, but with more power.|`|Ld7dOtGUaa	The biggest engine that will fit in your 93 Civic is one of these: http://img116.echo.cx/img116/9102/allise...    I have seen this car in person when the owner first built it, and you wanted to know how big you can go....  so I know if it'll fit in a BMW Isetta, it sure will fit in your car.  For approximately $250,000 you too could do this.|`|1NumX5aqaa	The most common swaps would be any B series engine (b16a, b18b, b18c1, b18c5, etc.). The B series engine will be a nice boost in power and will maintain most of your drive-ability because B series engines are not much heavier than your stock equipment. B series is also one of the most straight forward swaps and can be done relatively easily. The b16a would be the least expensive and the b18c5 would be the most expensive, and there is a lot in between... even the crvtec (b20z with b16 head) or lsvtec (b18b with b16 head).    The H22 is good bang for the buck, however the H22 will be a more difficult install and this engine has a good amount of weight to it, it will require an upgrade in suspension and brakes immediately. Even with the suspension upgrade the car will not handle very well and will have a tendency to push through corners.    The F series motors will be about the same to install as an H series, and most of the F series engines would be a waste of time unless you get the F20b which puts out good numbers but it will cost you. The F series engines are also quite heavy as far as a civic is concerned.    K series engines, K20a (type-r) being the best. This is the newest addition to Honda engines and have great stock numbers and the sexy six speed transmission. You will pay through the nose for this swap and it will most likely require professional installation because it is the most difficult install of the swaps I mentioned.    As always it all comes down to your budget and how fast you want to go. If you are really looking for some go fast for a good price and easy install then get the b18b and turbo it. The b18b is strong with good low end torque and lower compression pistons... it is a good candidate for turbo even on stock internals (as long as you don't get too carried away with the psi).|`|QdCyTQpBaa	you can install any size engine and any swap just depends on how much money you are looking to spend or power. are you doing a whole swap or just replacment motor? you have to be a little more specific. very broad question.

7YE2arJWaa	The "hybrid" system GM put into your particular truck is a "mild hybrid" system, which has an oversized alternator built into the transmission flywheel housing.  The Alternator's large size allows it to be used also as an  engine starter motor to crank the engine.    That extra-large alternator can be turned by the running engine to generate a lot of electricity--  Enough to drive the four 120VAC outlets in the back.    If you want to use the 120VAC outlets in your Silverado, you leave the car running and plug in your electrical appliance.  The engine will spin up the alternator to produce the 120VAC power whenever it's needed.    Hope this helps.|`|1SnI86BIaa	are you sure its a hybrid if it doesnt even mention it?    but the generator works by itself, you just drive..|`|2dke6ChJaa	lol, sorry, i thought you were being sarcastic... silverado, hybrid... haha......

It could be possible that the body shop ask you the insurance company name to see if they have a "special deal" with your company.

I believe the Walkers are called Cherry Bombs. The Thrush mufflers are okay, but they produce a sound that's just a little too harsh for your local cops to appreciate.

VlYNBT72aa	You will have to cut off the catalytic converter and take off the exhaust pipe. Then just buy a catalytic on ebay. Then get the new catalytic and weld it onto the exhaust pipe. You don't have to buy a whole new exhaust pipe. Don't throw away the old catalytic because it is worth form $20-50 at some recycling companies. Personal experience.|`|0Mj9b0Aoaa	The cats are a bit of a pain on those cars but nothing to difficult.  Be advised that the nuts for the cat/exhaust manifold connection tend to seize up and need a torch, propane might work but oxy/acetylene is best, to heat the nuts to get them off.  Without a hoist the worst thing about the job will be the space to work under the car.    There is an aftermarket company, Auto Camping, that deals in european vehicles and may be able to save you on the cat since they are very expensive through VW.  Or try for a place like Auto Zone, or other such aftermarket parts supplier but they may not bolt up and may require welding. AC's cat should bolt right up.    There is also an extended warranty on the cats.  You might want to go to VW and find out if you qualify for the warranty coverage.|`|J4HEAO5kaa	Actually I would recommend you contact a VW dealer first.  There is a warranty extension for the cat on some vehicles depending on a few things.  Call a dealer with your VIN and mileage and they will be able to tell you if you are a part of this.

I forget the name of the part but basically its 2 circles, one bigger then the other and its separated by plastic clips and lets say moves clockwise what happens is those clips break and cause the part to reverse.  The upgraded part uses metal rollers(used on police and taxi cars)     Only reason i know is my 96(uses the same 4r70w trans) and i lost 2nd gear 2 times, 1st they just replaced with the same **** plastic piece and then the next time they put the upgrade part in.

Now I can tell you that if you have too many infractions against you as it relates to traffic stops such as your situation, then your points on your license could increase, but it depends on if that was your first offense or not.  If you have had multiple offense in a recent time span, then yes points will go against your license.

E0j6mhqhaa	They were a decent bike at the time, but more than once the camchain guide broke, wore a hole in the crankcase and then jumped time and ruined the cylinder head.  That's exactly what happened to my brother-in-law's bike.    If you must go with an older bike, I'd suggest a Honda CB 750, either the sohc or the dohc.  Be wary of the later V4s, the 45 (750cc) wasn't bad but the 65 (1100cc) had camshaft oiling problems and would eat cams like my daughter eating corn on the cob.  There were plenty of the 750's built and there's still loads of used and new old stock parts around if you look hard enough.    Another bike to consider would be a '79-80 Kawasaki KZ1000 or better yet, an '81 and on KZ1100.  Both have electronic ignitions, a tough as nails engine and the 1100 has a rubber mounted engine which really makes it more comfortable when riding at high speeds.  I've had two CB750 (one a Super Sport) and a KZ1000 and KZ1100.  As far as comfort, power and speed goes, the two Kaws put the Hondas to shame.  Absolutely no comparison whatsoever.  On my last Honda, a 500 mile day left me throughly beat.  Three days after I bought my new KZ1000, I put on 600 miles one day and could have gone farther, it was that much more comfortable.  There's plenty of Kaw parts around, just check ebay and you'll see what I mean.  Were it me, I'd go for a '81-83 KZ1100 shaft drive.  Fast, very smooth, great gas mileage and it has air suspension front and back unlike the 1000.  $1400 should be able to buy you the full dress KZ1100, the one decked out with Vetter fairing, trunk and saddlebags.    The shaft drive Suzuki GS1000 of the same era was overgeared...I considered buying one but passed because it needed another gear or two to slow the engine down.  The noise and vibration drove me crazy.  The GS1100 was a good, very! fast bike (faster than the Kaws), but was chain drive and more sport oriented.  In line 4 cylinder Suzukis of that era were also nortorious for frying the charging system.  Not just the stator, but the whole works, regulator and all.  Regardless of then or now, it's an expensive proposition fo fix.  There aren't as many parts floating around these days either.    If you consider an earlier Gold Wing, keep in mind that they fried stators like the minumum wage flunky at McDonalds fries french fries.  Those are VERY expensive to fix, you have to pull the engine and if you find someone who will work on it, it'll set you back $1500, often more than the bike is worth.

Ecodriving is about driving in a style suited to modern engine technology:  smart, smooth and safe driving techniques that lead to average fuel savings of 5-10%.     Ecodriving offers benefits for drivers of cars, vans, lorries and buses: cost savings and fewer accidents as well as reductions in emissions and noise levels. Several European countries have implemented successful ecodriving programs.

XBUeYE41aa	Remove variator washer, etc?? The pulley sheave will be able to get a bit closer- top speed will be in theory higher. Exhaust system may be a bit restricted, check for exhaust port pipe washer.  Depends on local laws and market if you have a throttle stop or ignition limiter- the local Wisconsin moped laws for under 50cc  tend to have restrictors or rev limiters on some models to keep under 30mph, the 125s and larger sometimes have washers  and rev limiters for engine safety reasons but not for much restriction on horsepower or top speed. Yamaha I am more familar withhas 50cc engine- moped model restricted by washer and small exhaust pipe- the light motorcycle model is 4 hp instead of 2hp , no washer and larger exhaust- requires motorcycle endorsement on license. .

PFa39j3Uaa	Any hood scoop on a mustang is non-functional, so if people consider this "ricer," Ford did it from the factory.  I like the look of the scoops on the new body style.  It breaks up that vast expanse of hood and gives it more definition.  The only comment you'll get on the scoop (as long as its a Mustang-style, OE-like scoop) is people wondering if it's an '07.  Mustang people would never consider a hood scoop "ricer."    As for stripes... I don't like them.  Makes a car too busy in my opinion.  Good luck with the car though.  I loved my V6.  =]|`|AA11264416	well it depends on what the scoop really looks like but most for mustangs don't look rice, but my opinion i wouldn't put a hood scoop on anything unless it was functional|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Anything that's non-functional, is pretty ricer.

This is what I see on Mustangs most of the time.  A stripe on one side was tradiitional on certain race cars in the 60's as well.  c-shaped stripes are traditional on Mustangs only.  they also had a stripe that angled up the fenders onto the hood on the "Boss" mustangs in the 60's.

If the answer to both questions is yes, then I suggest looking at Ford Racing Parts. The FR1 power pack comes with a CAI, exhaust system, and a tune. If installed by a Ford dealer, it will keep your factory warranty in tact.    If your car is no longer under warranty or you aren't worried about your warranty, then look at rpmoutlet.com. They have a lot of good power upgrade options.

2z94RrD5aa	i had this problem on a ford a few years ago. It turned out to be a engine temperature sensor. Not the one that shows on the gauges inside. This is one for the ecm(engine control module) It thinks the engine is warm and sets the fuel and air fixture wrong, thinking the engine is warm. I had no fault lights either.

One other thing that does come to mind. Look and locate all your ground straps, not the battery ground but the ground straps, one or two of them is the chassis ground for the ECM and injectors and the cold can create a resistance problem  Good Luck|`|l80bH2TYaa	Sounds like one of two things. first off it could still be a fuel pump, because even with fuel pressure you may not be getting full volume, or flow. The second thing it could be is th coolant temperature sensor.|`|szXPvEt8aa	have you changed your mass air flow sensor|`|LdxN3xizaa	As we al know, you need three things, to run a truck.  Air, Fuel, and spark.  Seems you have fixed all spark problems, While the air might be cold, there is still plenty of it, unless your choke is gagging the engine,  so my guess is in the carb.  Since it fried it,  The carb must be closed, I carburator is too sensitive to the cold, and is closing air intake, (Not sure if your injected or not).  An adjustment to the choke or the damper of the carbs is needed. prolly only a small adjustment, if there is not adjustment available, A carb rebuild might be easier.  When you start, and it is soo cold, it acts like it's flooded? that is an engine being suffocated.  Thus you need more air in the carb mixture.

And I would think no to the 16yr old riding one.|`|5e8bfd4f40a66f73272a2b251c8d304daa	No.    Since the law was changed in October 2000, you need a full car licence to drive a quad.  Therefore, you must be at least 17 years old.    You can only drive a quad on a motorcycle licence, if you passed your full bike test before October 2000.|`|sFtPK9MDaa	I don't think any quads are street legal.

bqLvWpcZaa	I agree with the above.  The service history is the most important factor with a high-mileage vehicle.  Keep in mind as well that the earlier ML's had a touchy build-quality.  The '98 and '99's ( the first 2 years of ML production at the then brand new Alabama plant ) are the biggest ones to watch out for but the 2000's could also be problematic.    Also keep in mind that the ML is a heavy vehicle powered by a V8 engine.  Fuel mileage is on the high side.    Oh, and as far as buying it as an "investment", pretty much every car out there ( except for possibly some very rare, exotic models ) are bad investments as they will only depreciate in value.|`|Ht1aY8THaa	The ML430 is not a bad small SUV. The vehicle only had 4 recalls and those were 2 for steering and 2 for seat belts. It has a 4.3 Liter V8 that puts out about 268 HP. For a small SUV that is not bad. However, the bads, in todays economy an older V8 engine with that many miles will more than likely have problems coming up soon and for a Mercedes, they are not cheap to fix. Also, gas prices are going up and the gas mileage on the ML430 when it was new was right around 13 MPG. I highly doubt that it will get 13 MPG now. It has a 20 gallon tank so for right around $60 a tank you can go roughly 200 miles. That is just an estimate at $3 a gallon. Now, that vehicle blue books at $8,300 so you will be getting it at $1,000 off blue book. But, make sure you have it looked at by a professional mechanic before you buy it. You might get 1,000 miles out of it before something goes wrong and you are paying thousands of dollars to fix it. Good luck with your search for a vehicle and if you decide to buy the Mercedes I hope it works out for you.|`|2z94RrD5aa	I would check its history, if it has a great service history with all oil changes and maintainance records up to date and transmission fluid changes and filter changes. Go ahead, should be good for a long time yet. But if there is no history, mercedes has a very high cost for parts and repairs. So do your home work first !|`|YDIWhciCaa	No, its will not be as nice of a drive as a Lexus.  Also you will have tons of problems, according to consumer reports a 2000 M-class has more problems then a 1994 Lexus LS 400.  144,000 miles is a ton for a mercedes SUV.  After driving the BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus suv's I prefer the Lexus.
wpgRMjgraa	In New Jersey if you fail your inspection, you will be allowed a specified amount of time to have the necessary repairs completed and your vehicle re-inspected. You can either have the repairs completed by a registered Emissions Repair Facility (ERF) or you can make them yourself. When you fail the inspection, you will get an Emissions Repair Form and a Vehicle Inspection Report that will help determine what caused the emissions problem.    New Jersey Administrative Code 13:20-43.12 speaks about inspection extensions. Here it states that the owner of a motor vehicle registered in NJ which has failed inspection and requires repairs, other than repairs required to be made pursuant to N.J.A.C. 13:20-7.6 (immediate repairs needed due to hazard), which cannot be completed prior to the date by which the motor vehicle must be presented for re-inspection due to the nature of the repairs which are required, shall notify the Division of the date upon which the repairs to the motor vehicle shall be completed.     If a current registration has been issued for the motor vehicle, the inspection Director may issue a letter extending the time period in which to have the motor vehicle re-inspected.    1-888-656-6867, the number that the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) gives for questions regarding inspections. Here they should be able to tell you for certain if you can drive your car with your extension.
RVMJ7Gmdaa	They already accepted bailout money from the government. Basically the government loaned them money so they would have more time to start and turn things around and make a profit. If they can do that they will be expected to repay that money.    What you heard about cutting employee salaries to $11 an hour is entirely wrong, and if they're losing money they're not going to cut the price of vehicles to make it back. Wranglers don't cost that much anyways, they're offering employee pricing right now so a new base model can be had for $17,973 according to their website.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	If you want a Jeep get one, pricing is cheap and it depends on the dealer, MSRP is one thing. What the dealer sales it for is another. Example there is a Jeep dealer in Covina California advertising their base model wrangler for $12,500.00 with rebate plus tax, lic, doc fees  If you are paying 30K for a jeep, then that would be a base 4 door or a sahara ltd model or rubicon

Most car manufacturers offer a 100,000 kilometres/3-year warranty    The average Owner-drivers need to replace worn clutch around 120,000 to 150,000 kilometres (5-6 years driving)    So impressive and lucky, if this is going to be the first clutch replacement for your car   Your 7-years warranty claim?|`|vDVv1xpJaa	racing doesnt qualify under the powertrain warranty. and racing or not, clutches arent covered. they're wear items. you'd pay for that even if you drove 35mph at 1800rpms your whole life.|`|d1fc8dc7983a4ae6753871eed49f5139aa	You're on your own, the clutch is considered a wear item and is only covered for 1yr/12k.  I can't say about the transmission I think it is a 100k warranty on that, all you can do is take it into Hyundai service and see what they say.   Seeing it is an '02 it would probably cost more than the car is worth to get it all fixed.

Yq2CUhtYaa	Extortion, outwresting, or exaction is a criminal offense, which occurs, when a person unlawfully obtains either money, property or services from a person, entity, or institution, through coercion.    The car belongs to them. If you wanted to negotiate a parking fee, you should have done that before.    At this point, yes, you would be guilty of extortion if you attempt to get money for property that belongs to them.|`|3emS6MDmaa	Have the car towed.  If it is on your property you have the right to have it towed and they will have to pay to get it out of the impound.    Tell them that either they have someone come pick it up within the next 24 hours or you will call someone.    Call the Cops to have this documented so they cannot come back at you later.

78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	An 06 with that mileage will go for about 8,000, to 10,000 in the fully loaded SEL package.  That is extremely low miles for an 01.  If it has leather and the center console, it is an SEL, and is well worth 5,000 at that mileage.  Make sure all the maintenance has been performed, trans service at 30K, fuel filter etc., if it has, it is worth 5K, and will be a dependable vehicle.|`|RVMJ7Gmdaa	If it's a dealer that's selling the car the KBB value ranges from about $4-6k depending on the trim level, and this is for a car in excellent condition. If you're buying it from a person the value drops to $2,500 to $4,200 depending on the options. At least these are the prices for Chicago, they may vary slightly based on location. Find out what trim level it is and offer the guy a price around the KBB value and see what he says. There's no way it's worth as much as he's asking.

AxkVvgBFaa	it's just the sticker on your windshield.      they can however, see if your registration has expired and you forgot to renew it by the color of the sticker on your license plate.  the color denotes the month and the year is right there in large print.  they can also see that the vehicle isn't registered or that registration expired by running the plates quickly although if they can see the plate they can see the color of the sticker with the year on it.    but as far as the safety inspection is concerned, it's just the sticker since a mechanic can put it there for you and there would be no record.  also you can have a vehicle in need of inspection but you don't drive it.  that's totally legal.  but you can't have a car that's not registered.  so ironball is right when he says you must be caught driving it with the expired safety sticker to get a ticket since having sit in a driveway in need of inspection is fine as long as it's registered.    -McCheese|`|S33xuTNSaa	As far as I know it's just the sticker.  I doubt local car mechanics can patch into the DMV computers.|`|904b98e3003123549fac56c6334846a5aa	The only way to get a ticket is being caught driving the vehicle.

I am currently working there as a part-time job but trust me, it could really help you out! It can pretty much be used on any surface of a motorized vehicle so could lubricate your chassis for sure. It won't drip or stain. It also repels dust, dirt and grime so cleaning will be easier next time!    Give it a try! :-)    ps: Currently (and for a limited time) you can try Jig-A-Loo for free...  http://www.jigaloo.com/ca/e_tryonefree.p...
wqeAeSVYaa	You can probably pay for his car insurance using your bank account through an electronic funds transfer.  You need to check his insurance company's website to see if there is a "pay by internet" or "electronic payment" option.  Then you are going to want to make sure that this is a one time transaction on, and not a reoccurring event.    If he crashes his car, the funds do not come out of his bank or your bank.  The insurance company pays for them.|`|nzSBkDHxaa	Each auto insurance company has different guidelines as to how insurance premiums can be paid.  The company I work for will only allow the bank account to be in the insured's name.  I would just suggest that your brother open his own bank account.  It doesn't cost anything to get one.     If he had an accident and he was the policyholder, he would be responsible for paying any necessary costs.

0Mj9b0Aoaa	Depends on 1.8 or 2.0.  It will be on the front of the block right near the alternator.  The 1.8 usually is partially blocked by the alternator wiring.  You can get to it by using a long ball end hex socket (5mm or 6mm cant remember) and moving the wiring.  It's a pain but it can be done, just try not to strip the head out of the bolt..  The 2.0 is far easier since all the bolts are more accessible.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Same like the 01,00,the 90's-the 80's, the 70's etc.  1.Go to the front of the car  2. bend down and look up at the motor from under the front bumper  3  where the bottom rad hose goes to is the thermostat housing.  All VW's are worked on from the underside.         Chances are that the coolant was not put into the engine correctly for a bottom mount thermostat....so half the thermostat is in liquid coolant and the other half is in an air pocket which will give you a non working thermostat.        An open thermostat would cause your engine to run cold-taking a long time to warm up.             Does not hurt the engine any.         You can run a car without a thermostat(which is the same deal as one being stuck open).  Fuel economy is not as good and creature comforts (such as passenger heat) is lacking for the interior.   Car runs fine.          Proper way to refill if you are going to take out the thermostat and replace it and button it up tight again - is first take off upper rad hose from the radiator and pour coolant down inside the hose to fill the engine block.  Fill it right up to the top of the hose and then reconnect hose back onto radiator.  Then take rest of coolant and pour remainder into the overflow container which fills up the radiator side.    Close up and drive the car for an hour and then shut it down and allow it to cool.  Recheck level on overflow container.   It will be lower as all the air has been driven to the one spot.  Add to the overflow contairer up to the cold line.           Done like borscht.    It is always done this way on a bottom mounted thermostat motor.|`|qxTXr4Gxaa	if it is a 1.8T, it is a ***** to get to, you have to remove the timing belt|`|VlYNBT72aa	In a 2.0 engine follow the lower radiator hose to the engine. There are two bolts that are holding the thermostat housing plastic cover. The thermostat is next to the yellow oil dipstick.

And there should be 1 to 2 bolts holding that in place. If you remove the bolts the battery should just come out. I know that the original battery had a foam shroud around the battery but when you take the battery out the foam piece comes out too.

They say you can also put baby powder on the trunk and you can see the fingerprints of the kids pushing you over the train tracks.  But it is only the residual oil from your fingers/palms from previously touching your trunk and the powder not sticking to it.      Sorry, no ghosts or phantoms pushing your car uphill.

Which sucks because the only reason to get a V6 over the V8 would be mileage concerns, but it is not much better than the V8 so there really is no point.     Just save up for the R/T if you absolutely must get a Challenger. As far as used ones, I have yet to see any for sale anywhere. I haven't really looked all that hard either to honest.

Out of curiosity is it a petrol or diesel?    It could be coincidence that it has started after 10 mins so might be the usual - worn starter bushes - but you seem more adamant regarding the 10 minute delay.    Get someone to turn the ignition, hold the key in the start position, then chap the starter gently to see if it engages.

A manual transmission ("stick shift") means that the driver must coordinate operating the clutch and shifting to change gears.  Pro automatic: easier to drive, especially in city traffic.  Con automatic: more maintenance and repair.  Pro manual: theoretically more economical. Greater feeling of control and enjoyment of motoring. Theoretically better performance.  Con manual: sometimes difficult skill to master. Is very tedious in city driving.

mKVFIklaaa	I would say that both answers are on the right track, but staggeringly over complicated.  The Discovery is a permanent 4wd vehicle - power is sent to all four wheels all of the time.  Your son is therefore correct, your cousin is absolutely wrong.  In a coventional 2wd car, a differential gear distributes power between the left & right driven wheels. This is necessary because the wheels of a car need to turn at different speeds - for example, the outside wheel of a turning car travels farther than the inside wheel, so a differential is needed to allow this, but an unwanted consequence of a differential gear (or 'diff') is that it will allow the wheel with least weight or traction to spin freely. This obviously isn't very handy for an off roader, so the Discovery employs three diffs; one for the front axle, one for the rear & one in the centre, allowing an equal split of power between front & back axles.  In severe conditions, the centre diff will behave in the same manner as any other diff: For example, if you have both back wheels on ice & the front ones on tarmac, this centre diff will allow the back wheels to spin freely, giving no traction.  The Discovery 300 series, which yours is, has a second lever with two functions:  Firstly, it allows the gearbox ratios to be put through a 'transfer gearbox', giving an additional five lower gears as well as the five conventional ones. This is useful for heavy towing or serious off roading.  Secondly, it allows the centre diff to be locked, meaning that in my above scenario, a 50/50 split of power is forced to the front & back axles. This stops the wheels with least traction just spinning & allows power to be sent to the wheels with traction, allowing the car to move.  As the diff lock only works 'front to back', it's still pretty easy to get a Discovery stuck by putting both wheels on one side in ice or mud. In this scenario, the centre diff lock will force power to both axles, but the diffs sat on both front & back axles will still allow the wheel on each with least traction to spin.    Sorry for the long winded description, but if you want to email me, I'll take you off road & actually show you!|`|4TZsKgAUaa	The Discovery is permanant four wheel drive, your son is absolutely correct.  The car is always in four wheel drive.    Unlike most off pavement vehicles, Land Rover have a third differential in the center of the vehicle.  This allows far greater capability in situations where normal four wheel drive would be a drawback, like in some sandy or snowy tracks.    That said, the front and rear driveshafts are not locked together normally.  This is a great benefit in certain off pavement situations, and is required for street driving.  This allows the shafts to travel at different speeds.  In order to gain full capability when it can be applied, a Land Rover needs the ability to lock these shafts together.  That is what the center differential lock is all about.    The vehicle can be placed in these modes with the small lever.    Low locked  High locked  Low unlocked  High unlocked  Nutural    All modes are capable of using every gear in the transmission.  The transmission can also be placed in nutural.  Since the transmission has four gears, this makes the vehicle capable of having eight gears for varied situations.    These changes are affected by a gear driven transfer case, which is essentially a second transmission.  The parking brake on a Discovery is actually a large drum brake fitted to the output shaft of this transfer case.    Due to yuppie confusion, Land Rover removed the locking function of the lever in the Discovery II, from 1999 to 2003.  They did not, however, remove the differential lock until 2003.  It can still be actuated, and there is a kit available from Land Rover to restore functionality to the lever.  In 2004, Land Rover returned to the full lever setup, after loads of complaints from enthusiasts.    The other responder is not correct.  If Land Rover didn't have that diff lock, it would be no more than an overweight Subaru.|`|8ovTppsAaa	The vehicle is in permanent 4wd in the recognised terms.    However,we need to disambiguate diff lock from 4wd.    When a car is 2 wd ,only one wheel is essentially driving,which is why ,sometimes when 1 wheel is in mud that the other wheel doesnt turn,because the diff is allowed to slip.This is intentional to allow one wheel to turn faster than another when cornering.    Therefore it stands to reason that a car in 4wd only has , for off road conditions,2wd,one on the front  and one on the back.    The difflocks allow for the axles to turn as one,creating genuine 2wd on each axle and often with a centre diff on the prop.    Older land rover products did have cockpit levers to disengage the front drive.      Summing up,you are both correct to a point but diff locks are usually disregarded when categorising 4wd's.    edit.  to the other poster..    Nowhere in my post does it say that the discovery does not have diff locks.  Your inability to decipher simple grammer is laid bare by the failure to register the word"categorising" in the context of the sentence.      Nothing in my post is incorrect.

e9W9g5tzaa	With all new parts you would suspect either an improper bleed (allowing the master to run dry during bleeding will introduce air and you need to start fresh on the bleed), or a problem with either the firewall or if it is a 6 cyl 4 speed a problem with the fork (all other combos in the F150 19995 used an internal slave cylinder with the release bearing mounted directly on the slave cylinder).    1  Re bleed the system making sure not to allow the master cylinder to run dry.     2  Some of these trucks after severe use in cold climates would experience flex in the firewall when the clutch was applied not allowing the master cylinder to be fully engaged, to check for this watch the firewall where the master cylinder mounts while your friend works the clutch if it does flex go to your Ford dealer and order firewall reinforcement kit F2TZ-7K509-A and install it.    3  If it has an external slave cylinder check the fork to see if it is bent and if the pivot is worn out.    Good Luck|`|kati4sOaaa	bad throwout bearing?|`|QFjWKJmMaa	Have you checked your clutch slave cylindeer from the wall mounted by the brake master cylinder to see if it is holding pressure.Try bleeding it first if there is a valve to open with a wrench to open and closse the valve on it before you bleed the slave cylinder by the clutch housing.One question comes to mind when you replaced the clutch system.Did you check to see if you got the right length of throw out bearing sleeve when you did the clutch replacement?, by seting each of them side by side and seeing for sure if the sleeve that carries the thorw out bear is the same as what was the same exact part.Good luck!hgm20002000@yahoo.com|`|lIxEKA1xaa	well could be throwout bearing. if its too narrow that could be it but i believe it should be able to adjust on its own so i believe it may not be it. so possibly try bleeding the system. this is a two person job. first get someone to pump up the pdeal by push and let go of the pedal. then lossen the bleed screw and it should let out the fluid. and repeat the proccess untill u cant see any more air in the fluid. just make sure you dont let the system run out of fluid. i believe its dot 3 brake fluid.

tlue10gAaa	Generally, the cheapest car you will ever own is the one you have now. I would suggest you call some junk yards to see if they have a transmission that will work in your car. If so, call around to see if you can find a mechanic to install it. I bought a used trans for $300 and paid $300 to have it installed. Worked for 50,000 miles. I would get another opinion. I know someone who was told it would cost $2000 to fix his transmission. He had it fixed for $65.|`|AA10331789	I definitely would not "rebuild" the transmission, especially through any national chain store like AAMCO. It will cost you little or nothing to get a second opinion from your Mercury Ford dealer. While your there, take a look at the new cars just to see how much below "dealer invoice price" you could buy a new economy car now. Once your have that low price quote on a specific car, ask them how much they will give you off that low price on your cougar trade in. You may be able to negotiate a good deal in these tough economic times.    Ford offers new remanufactured transmissions that have a 3 year 100,000 mile warranty, but they would cost $3,000 and you may not want to invest that much in the car. However if you did and the rest of the car is in good shape, you'd know you had something that would last and be reliable.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Start by researching the value of the car (with a good transmission). Kelly Blue Book .com or a site of that nature can give an average price based on the vehicle then take the thought process from there. The car might not be worth fixing but then again you might not be able to buy another right now. Way your options out
59b9f44cc97529e1ff460f8518e5b3f9aa	North Carolina law says that if the machine has an external shifting device or if it goes over 30mph, you need to get a motorcycle endorsement and insurance to legally ride it on the roads.

FsT54qh1aa	I've noticed an mpg bump of 1 or 2 mpg on a few previous rides that I installed free flowing cold air intakes on. You won't lose mpg, unless you start pushing that gas pedal harder more often to hear that intake sucking sound.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Actually, we all "think" intakes give more horsepower.    But you're quite wrong.    You aren't getting 7 extra horsepower.    You seem to have missed where it said "7 horsepower at peak".    That means at redline. Now, think about how often your engine is actually at redline.    Hardly at all? That's how often you'll have 7 hp.    The rest of the time, if you had looked at the dyno more carefully, it's around 1 horsepower.    You can get the same gain, by just changing out your old filter.    As far as fuel mileage? Sure, it saves you mileage. But so infinitesimally little, that you'll never notice it.    Let's say it gets you 5%.    Your car currently gets 25 mpg, for example. You now get 27.5 mpg. But you also drive harder, because you like the extra "power" you now have, even though it's a placebo effect.     So you're actually down to 24mpg.    But let's say you drive reasonably, and get the 27.5.    That means you're saving .4 of a gallon, every 100 miles. (3.6 gallons used, instead of 4)    That's about 70 cents saved, every 100 miles.    So, if the intake costs you $120, it will take you a measly 16,600 miles, before you've even paid it off and saved any money.    So, don't hold your breath for any gas cost savings.|`|x0kmZgrDaa	you'll notice a small savings but not much at all|`|CbAFShuoaa	yes it does save gas. you see it takes less effort for the engine to draw air into itself when you install a new intake. this increases horsepower as well because the engine can pull in air faster.

It would definitely look alot nicer than a body kit. As far as a cf hood goes, it is a little more light weight and it doesn't look bad depending on the color of the car. But again, its all personal preference. If you haven't already, consider cheap things under the hood to tune up the hp or torque. I've got an air intake that will only cost me the price of the filter to make, but im also not looking to impress with style, just performance.|`|ZBVMT11maa	I would say no, just take your time. and do it right. I personally have an CF lip on my Subaru and i love it. I would always suggest getting a lip rather than a bodykit on a civic. its simple clean and looks good.     It serves more function and a crappy *** body kit IMO. esp if its just daily driven. Although be careful with a lip kit you do need to drive a little more careful because it will sit lower on your car.

Do this in either order, probably best to check the tranny side first before taking the dash apart. Have a freind watch your speedometer while your under it and with the cable unscrewed, roll the cable inside quickly to see if the speedometer flickers, if not go get a new one.

AA12334360	Well, vauxhall and ford have just put thier prices up in the uk by 4% so they are not in any mood to drop on brand new prices.    I doubt if you'll get a genuine 2 for 1 on anything worth driving, best bet would be to look for discounts on cars at the bottom of a particular forecourt range becasue they won't want them hanging around.|`|6t76bgS3aa	I don't know where you live, but what you need to do is to watch the car ads in the newspaper.  Dealerships put ads for their best priced cars in newspapers to draw people into the dealership, those cars are called "ad cars" and the dealership hopes you don't actually buy that car.  Once you're in the dealership you'll be steered toward a more expensive one.  But you really should buy the ad car because it's a great deal.  Buying two deeply discounted cars would be the same as buying two for the price of one cars, your savings would be about the same.  Just keep your eye on those newspaper ads, and when you see a really good one go in early before the car you want is taken.|`|SKqV374maa	let me know when you find out|`|32d69300213c54018bab3031b85b4dc1aa	KIA KIA KIA,|`|PLdmhn24aa	There is a new Kia Magentis 2.0 LS advertised on http://www.cars2buy.co.uk/ - a new car price comparison site - for 8775 saving 45% - i think two of these is probably the closest you will get to a new car 2 for 1 offer.

VEIkVDtIaa	The first question to ask is "Does the AM Radio work?"  If you have AM radio and no FM radio then the problem is not the antenna but the radio itself because both the AM and the FM radio share the same antenna.  As a matter of fact, the AM radio is much more sensitive to antenna problems and the FM will typically work just by having a wire plugged into the antenna port.  So if the AM works and the FM does not then you either need to have the original radio repaired or replace the radio.  I think you'll find that any stereo shop can replace the radio with a much better unit for about half the price of a repair and about a quarter of the price of a replacement radio from Honda.    if neither the AM nor the FM work then you do have an antenna problem.  The most likely cause would be with the antenna module that is located in the trunk under the rear package shelf.  It's not an easy replacement as you have to remove the rear shelf to replace it and I'm sure the part is fairly expensive.  Call a honda dealer and ask them how much an "antenna coil" is for your car.  Add about $100 in labor to replace it and you'll get a fairly accurate estimate for the replacement.  By the way, they will tell you that they have to order the part because it is almost certain they won't stock that.    An absolute long shot would be that the antenna wire in the rear window burnt out.  it is possible to repair it if the wire in the glass is broken but if the wires on the side of the window are burnt you would have to replace the window and it would run about $300 to do that.  i would think at that point you would want to have a stereo shop put in a different radio or a separate antenna.    my guess is you have AM and you're going to wind up replacing the radio.    hope that helps.|`|953b1543887d5a2769cc2f6564e33136aa	ok easy question....may not be easy to find the problem but i can tell u were its at....the problem is in the back glass yes your anteanna is in the back glass but so is your rear defroster  dont ask me y it does this but it does if something scrapes the rear glass on the inside and breaks one of the defroster gridds it causes static in the radio when the defroster is pushed...now next time u use your defroster look and see which lines dont work and examine them with a flashlight for the break...they make kits that can repair the lines...they dont look the greatest when your done but it beats replacing the rear glass which is your only other option!
r1D9P4Vyaa	This is what you should do. Roll each and wiggle every pulley the belt would go around. Is any of them loose or noisy. If   so that is the bad one. If not all you need is a 1/2" drive ratchet to put the belt back on. There will be a small white sticker under the hood above the radiator that will show you the way the belt goes around the pulleys. Get the belt close, then pull on the auto tensioner ( it is spring loaded ) with your ratchet to put the belt back on. belts will not stretch, they will wear out though. Good Luck!|`|e9W9g5tzaa	Yes these belts will stretch over time but very little( the spring loaded tensioner holds these belts at between 75 and 90 lbs tension even when badly worn they will have about 60 lbs tension), to stretch enough for it to come off it would be so distorted you would not try to put it back on, so I would be willing to bet you have a pulley that has either seized and burnt off or a bearing in a pulley has gone out allowing for the movement to throw the belt. Look at the belt diagram (either under the hood or on the rad support) and follow all the pulleys and check each for play or whether it is still there, or is the tensioner broken and not able to hold the belt tight? Find the problem pulley or bearing and replace it then put your belt on.|`|n73UfGf3aa	What he said makes sense. Either you have a problem with one of your pulleys, or the belt has stretched somehow. I would try a fresh belt and see if it continues to happen. If it does, you will need to repair or replace a pulley or a bearing on it.|`|lIxEKA1xaa	maybe one of the pulleys maybe out of adjustment. im sure the mech isnt trying to take ur money. cuz if he tries fixing it and it happens again later. he should be able to do it for free. but i cant see the belt being over stretched. so maybe it would be a bearing|`|kvGHnEHjaa	Hmmm... '95 Explorer... Check the belt tensioner, they are known for cocking at the point where they bolt to the bracket. may not be visually obvious until there is a belt on it with tension applied. Good luck.

ZnvUJxA8aa	What do you mean you are trying to turn the amp up?? U mean the volume, or the gain that is actually located on the amp?     You might have some wiring off...
RbsRpcIyaa	You're in the same boat as hundreds of thousands of Americans right now.     The advice you will get is harsh, but rings true.     One statement that is bugging me is, "It does appraise at $25,000 though". According to whom? Blue Book? Your buddy? If a dealer is offering $17,500, that's probably fair market value in this economy. Truck values took a huge nosedive this past year. You know this, or would not be asking this question.    Voluntary repo is not the way to go. Once they take your truck, it's auctioned off, and you are responsible for paying the difference between what is owed and what it brings at auction. Think $17,500 is low? It'll be much less at auction. Let's assume you'd owe $15K or more... if you cannot pay this, they can get a judgment against you and garnish wages.     Selling it? Probably no chance you'd get even close to the $30K you owe. All three of the major domestic makes are offering thousands off their new trucks (sometimes up to $15K off). Why would anyone want to buy yours when they could get a new one for thousands less?    "Get another car that's cheaper and let them repo the truck?" -- Can your credit carry both loans? Probably not... which means you wouldn't get approved on the new loan.     Whatever you do, don't go the repo/bankruptcy route. You're 23 years old, and need to be spending your time building your credit instead of destroying it. Tighten the budget all you can. Spend as little as possible on entertainment, eating out, etc.     If you are going to miss a payment, call your lender immediately. They are more likely to work something out with you if you are proactive.|`|Ht1aY8THaa	Right now the smartest thing to do would be trying to sell it privately for around 28,000.00. Depending on how long youve had the truck, you could go back to the dealer and refinance it. That might make your payments lower. If you dont have anyone come to look at the truck at 28k start lowering the price slowly. Get what you can for it and buy something that you can pay off completely at around 4 or 5k. Pay off the truck loan and when you have that payed off, start looking for another vehicle. Once you are under, it is hard to get back out without sucking it up for a while. You might get 20k for the truck now, but once you give the money to the people you got the loan through, then refinance the loan to make your payments smaller but give more than what they are financing you for. If they lower it to $400 a month, give $500. That way you are paying the interest and the loan at the same time and youll have it payed off faster to get you out of what you should buy next. 23 is still young. I am 21. Bankruptcy is not something you want to do at such a young age. It stays above your head for 3 to 4 years. Over your head i mean on file. Try what i said, get what you can for the truck and refinance. That is probably your best bet. Good luck.|`|SKqV374maa	call a bankruptcy lawyer and just ask|`|5A7RmIH6aa	call the bank and get a 10 day payoff.(that is the bottom dollar to pay off your loan). then sell it.if they repo it..your credit will be ruined.no house/apartment/no car.etc. good luck.|`|i38Ev1Zaaa	Don't let them repo your car. if you think that 17,500 is little for your car, when they auction it off, they sell it for PENNIEs on the dollar, and your stuck with the remaining balance (im guessing it'll sell for about 10k on an auction).     The best thing to do is to live with the truck. Talk to your company about refinancing for a lower monthly payment; selling your car/getting it repoed will only kill your credit, and leave you carless, while still making the car payments on the car you just gave up.|`|n73UfGf3aa	Ok, first of all, don't sell the truck to a dealer...you will only get trade in value for it. What you need to do is contact the company that made you the loan for the car, and tell them your situation. Explain to them that you are unable to continue making the payments on the truck with your current financial situation. Tell them you want to sell the truck as a private party sale (you sell it yourself, so you get the most money for it). Tell them you will give them 100% of what you make on the sale and ask them to work with you on a payment plan for the difference. Ask them if they are willing to roll the debt into a new loan for a much cheaper used vehicle you can actually afford.     There is no easy bankruptcy any more. Laws were changed a couple of years ago making it all more difficult. If they repo the truck, they will sell it at auction and come after you for the rest. You will also have destroyed your credit and you won't be getting a decent car loan for a long long time.
HpWmkhabaa	Sounds like the gas pump has cracked and ticking your whole entire car. Please repair it now.,|`|KPFQBQa1aa	Sounds like you have bad connections at the battery.

Mike|`|8QMvsIfKaa	Start by cleaning battery connections, baking soda and water, about a 1/4 cup in a big glass of water, let that sit maybe 5-10 minutes.Then rinse with water and don't get any on you, it'll have acid in it. Use a terminal cleaner, you can pick one of those up pretty cheap  (take off neg., black first) and clean and re tighten connections, red, positive first. Maybe check the cable connections on the starter and engine block WHILE DISCONNECTED and check the connections on the solenoid (the battery cable will straight to it from the battery) on the fender under the hood, too.  Good luck.

ybh71Dh9aa	TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH CIRCUIT MALFUNCTION.   This will be a bit technical. For those who have driven a stick/standard transmission car, this will be more easy to understand.    A transmission is what connects an engine, to the drive wheels making them spin (thus moving your car). Now if the engine is connected to the wheels, then when the engine speeds up the wheels speed up, and the reverse thereof.    If the wheels stop, and the engine is connected to them, the engine stops. So why does the engine keep going when you stop at a red light?    On a standard/stick shift car, you push the clutch. By pushing the clutch pedal, you are disconnecting the engine from the wheels. This allows the engine to run freely while the wheels are stopped.    On a automatic transmission, you have a device called a torque converter. A real simple explaination is picture two box fans. On facing the other. One pluged in and running, is blowing air into the other, which is not plugged in. What happens? The other spins from the air moving through it.    This is kind of how a torque converter works. The engine drives one "fan" and the other "fan" is connected to the wheels. As one drives the other, your car moves. But just like the box fans, if you stop one fan with your finger, the blowing fan does not. Similarly even though you leave your engine in drive, and you stop at a red light, the engine does not stall out.    Now this is good for stopping, but on the highway, this system is not efficient. So there is an extra part called the torque converter clutch. This, just like a clutch in a stick shift car, locks the engine to the wheels.    So here comes the part you want to know: What's wrong?  Most all torque converter clutches are run by computer since the early 80s. The computer does this by powering a valve that opens and causes the clutch to lock up. When you brake or let off the gas, the valve should de-power and close, causing the clutch to release.    If it does not, then you get funny things happening when you stop (engine wheels locked together, wheels stop, engine stops). This is bad for you engine, and bad for your transmission. This is the common problem as valves tend to get stuck open when they go bad.    I had a Chevy Lumina which did this. The valve went bad, and was very easy to replace. There was a access port on the side of transmission, and the valve was only about $50 bucks.     Here's the key to you: The valve could get stuck open, and the valve could be sending bad vibes to the computer which caused the P0740. Or there could be a sensor that is giving bad info to the computer making it think the valve is messed up when it isn't. The noise you hear could be the clutch, from not releasing (bad valve), or it could be the computer putting the transmission in fale safe mode (which sometimes make noises).    Advice: If you can determine for certain it's a bad valve, it might be easy to replace. I do not know your specific transmission, so you'll have to do some research on how hard it is.    IF YOU DO NOT KNOW... for certain, your best option is to take it to a dealership. It could be a sensor gone bad, a bad computer, or a bad valve... there's also an off chance it could be something unrelated like wiring and such. You'd end up doing the part swap guess game that costs so many so much money.|`|dQUISy3Haa	These codes indicate there is a transmission problem. It could be as simple as "low voltage" because your battery ran down or a sensor. Have someone check your trans for codes.

If it has bad valves or rings you might need a major engine rebuild and there's no way to know for sure without opening the engine up.  If the heater core is bad you may have to remove the entire dashboard, a major undertaking.    My advice is to pass on it.  There's very little upside and a big downside.|`|r5EwvgQHaa	Find out if the current owner has had the gaskets changed previously, The 3.8 came from the factory with bad head gasket problems. I have a 1995 Mustang with the 3.8 and I had the gaskets changed in it a couple years ago, with close to 100000 miles on it. The lack of heat could be a bad heater core, could be a clogged heater core, or the head gaskets. if you just need to change the gaskets, it should be less than $100 for the parts. Consider this in your decision, do you like Mustangs, and know that the V-6 gets better mileage then the V-8.
AA11318686	You'll need to wire the dual 2 sub in series(positive off the amp into the first voice coil's positive negative off the amp into the other voice coil's negative and a wire from vc1- to vc2+) then put both positives off both subs to the amps positive output and both subs negatives into the amp's negative output. and yes you need to upgrade your power wire if your amp is 1800w RMS you'll need 1/0 gauge if you're running up to 14 feet and if you're running 13-22 feet you'll need 2/0 gauge and 22 or more 3/0 gauge And for a reference on length a chevy suburban is 17 feet from bumper to bumper|`|dRozk0cCaa	i agree with the person above me your amp is going into protection mode when it turns off cause of your subs. and for the wire i would get at least a 4 gauge wire not a 2 or 0 gauge cause that kenwood doesn't need that big of a power and ground wire. but 4 gauge will do just fine.|`|IaHBKA1saa	Your problem is probably popping a circuit somewhere depending on how you wired it. And you really want the same resistance on both amps. And your wiring might be too big, check the specs on the wiring. If you're wire output exceeds the output of the amp, or if it exceeds the input of the sub you could have some major problems|`|8ZmPfacsaa	your problem is your subwoofers    you are wiring 2 completly difference subs together 1 being a dvc and one being an svc subwoofer.. your amp can NOT handle this ohm impendance... and also you shouldnt wire 2 different subwoofers into the same amp even if they are they same watts and voice coils.. but thats the problem, their different voice coils and most likely different watts.. the way you have them wired is most likely into a 1 ohm load and your amp can not handle a 1 ohm load, get a seperate amp    smart thing would be to get 2 of the same subs and amp that can handle the subs, you're and idiot for putting 2 completly different subs on the same amp, esepcially cuz it cant even handle that ohm load    before you go doing things, make sure you know what your doing    get rid of either the SVC sub or the DVC sub and replace it with the same kind as the other so you have a pair of the same ones    and yeha your dumb for having 8g wire with a 1800 watt amp.. you need either 2 or 1/0g wire for a 1800 watt amp.
vGxr9e59aa	If one lamp is burning, the fuse is fine; all the illumination lamps in the instrument cluster are fed from the same source.  Though I haven't worked on a 2003 Taurus, I suspect it uses the same  194 wedge-base lamps used by other Ford vehicles in this application.  The  194 lamp is readily available from auto parts stores. Check with your local Ford dealer's parts department before you start and find out the exact lamp type and how many lamps the instrument cluster takes, including the warning lights (alternator, parking brake, etc.) , then buy at least that many from your local auto parts store.    The lamps are mounted on the back of the instrument cluster, and most likely not accessible by reaching up behind the dashboard.  You'll need a  2 Phillips screwdriver to remove the trim around the instrument cluster and pull it out.  Before you tilt the instrument cluster out, you'll need to reach behind the dashboard to disconnect the speedometer cable -- it has a nylon retaining clip that you'll need to squeeze or push to one side to release the cable from the back of the speedometer.  You'll find a cable plugged into the back of the instrument cluster, which supplies power to the lighting system and signals to the various instruments.  Unplug the cable by carefully squeezing the retaining catches on either side.  Now that the instrument cluster is fully out, simply pull the lamps out of their sockets and insert new ones in their place.  Replace ALL the lamps, even the ones that still work; they're cheap and you don't want to do this for another 5-10 years.  (The  194 wedge base lamps are usually held in place by black plastic quarter-turn holders.  Twist the holder a quarter turn to the left, pop it out of the instrument cluster, replace the lamp, then twist the holder back in place.)    Plug the signal cable into the back of the instrument cluster, wiggle the cluster into position, and reinstall the screws.  Plug the speedometer cable into the back of the cluster.  Reinstall the dashboard trim.    You can greatly extend the life of the lamps if you run the instrument panel lighting at no more than 80%-90% of maximum intensity.  You can always turn the intensity up to 100% briefly to scrutinize the odometer reading, or whatever.  As a rule of thumb, each 10% reduction in voltage on an incandescent lamp will double its life.    (If the described procedure sounds too daunting, I'd suggest taking the car in to the dealer or a competent independent auto repair shop.  What will you do when your last lamp burns out?)|`|hLcFhhNxaa	Depending on the lights you have, If they run on Direct Cables (Red, Green, Ether) cables, then i would suggest you open the light mainframe (making sure car if off of course) and slowly screw or pull the bulb, if you find out its just a simple screw in and out operation, then common sense will guide you, however, if it has 2 or 3 extension wires lodged behind its bulb, then acquire the exact same bulb and slowly unscrew your old one from its cables and screw in the new one, keeping in the mind the correct circuit wires. Hope this helps. Stay safe and Good Luck!|`|AA12056072	All you need is a screw driver look and see what size the screws are and take the cluster out and replace the bulbs

Your car has a 105 amp alternator which might have trouble because that autotek pulls 60amps by itself. You might need a H.O alternator once you get a new battery. Then if you don't run it a lot with the car off, you won't have a problem with a dead battery.    EDIT: Patrick, believe it or not, cars do have other electronics besides the stereo.

1bYITsABaa	no, this is not true. The DMV will not recognize the sale until you show up with the title. You must pay 100% of the balance prior to getting the title- I still don't understand why he won't be listed as a lien holder? Maybe he is afraid you'll stop making payments and he will have to go through all kinds of BS to repo the car, who knows?   He is actually helping you out- by allowing you to make payments to him- I think I would let it go- at least until I was paid in full.....|`|wqeAeSVYaa	If you are making payments on a car purchased through a private sale, then I would assume that he will sign over the title to you when you make the final payment.  Perhaps you should try talking to him and see what his plans are regarding the title.    Registration of the car is YOUR responsibility.  You should have the car registered in your name, with the seller as the lienholder (legal owner).  When you make your final payment, the lienholder (this guy) will sign the title and give it to you.    Then you take that title to the DMV and ask them to transfer the title into your name only.      Why do you people always think that lawyers and courts are involved?  Until you make that last payment, you don't own the car.    TITLE AND REGISTRATION ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES.|`|SuZbBnycaa	Are you saying that if you got pulled over and the police asked you for registration, proof of insurance and your drivers license that you wouldn't be able to provide a registration with your name on it??     Explain to him that being the lien holder means he's still the legal owner. Perhaps he doesn't understand that.     As the lien holder, he still holds onto the title. HE needs to go to the DMV or AAA Auto Club (with you) and transfer it into your name. The new title will be mailed to him, and you get to walk out with a registration in your name (and his name will also be listed down below where it says lien holder on the registration.)    Have you been able to insure it?|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Hi, I'm sorry but I would not register the car in your name until it was paid in full either. The seller would have no way to recover the rest of his money except to sue you and I'm sure he doesn't want to go through all of that. Go to your motor vehicle agency in person with all of the paperwork you have and see what they say about the situation. They may have a better answer for you. Those places are impossible to call !
LjTUpYpLaa	If you are going to pull something with a f-250. your best bet is the super duty. The super duty has the power stroke option with a 6.9l, 7.2l turbo, or 7.3l twin turbo for an engine and the King Ranch only comes with a gasoline engine usually the 5.4l is the popular choice.|`|fdTgA1Svaa	A King Ranch is a over priced super duty. Look at the wheel base as well, the longer wheel bases can pull a lil bit more that the shorter ones.

But none of them pull like a 7.3 liter powerstroke|`|9BcNhdZ0aa	a super duty can tow 12,000 pounds|`|N7LlOAcOaa	nothing....ford trucks are all VERY un-reliable and under-powered and they blow transmissions all the time....but Fords are better than chevy but NOT better than DODGE!|`|8e1fdf4cefa581a57ec81fd9d7c68728aa	The Superduty is a model of the F-Series (F250, F350, F450, etc) while the King Ranch is a trim that is available on any F-Series from the F150 to the F450. If you need to tow heavy loads, you should probably buy an F250 or larger.    A King Ranch F250 comes with nicer leather and some other small options that an XLT or a Lariat doesn't come with. An XLT and a King Ranch with the same powertrain and towing options will tow the same.     I am going to ask you a series of questions. Based on your answers, I'll tell you what I would buy.  How much weight are you going to tow?   How often do you plan on towing?   How long do you plan on keeping your truck?  How many miles will you put on your truck each year?

U24VtSlZaa	5, 6 years...even longer under ideal conditions.    Most common causes of premature battery failure:  Low water level (usually caused by heat).  Storage at less than 100% full charge.    Any time you accidently discharge your battery (leave the lights on, alternator failure, etc.), recharge it fully with a bench charger.  Otherwise, your normal driving pattern might not ever bring it up to 100%, resulting in a chronic undercharge condition that will shorten its life.    Unless it's a "sealed" battery, check the water, and if it's dropped below the level of the plates, add only *distilled* water (drinking water has minerals that interfere with the recharging process).|`|lc1Fm7zJaa	As stated above it depends on the climate and additionally on the make and max CCA of the factory battery...Generally, on a stock / factory installed battery, about 4 years, after that you're on borrowed time.

4dntstR9aa	Ok, I am sorry, but can you answer a few questions for me?  First off, Are you familiar with Body work and body repairs?  That car was hit HARD in the rear end?  Your talking about $4000 or more to repair that rear end.  Why would you want to pay for a car that you KNOW has been in that kind of collision.  You may know of a very good body man/repair technician and that would be great.  But you are talking about several days in a body shop - not to mention that the car looks like it might have damage to the rear frame.  If you look at the 6th picture, you can (barely) see that the LT RR door and the LT Quarter panel (Lt fender) barely has any gap at the bottom - virtually what that means (And I am only going by the vague pictures they have posted) is that the rear end could be buckled down (Frame damage - causing the rear end to need frame work - which can run about $100 an hour or more in California)  If I were you and I had several thousand dollars to buy a used car, I would be looking for a car that didn't need the repairs this car does.  If you were my daughter, I would BEG you NOT to buy this car.|`|KkrfpWn9aa	what's wrong with it?|`|wqeAeSVYaa	The pictures show some pretty significant body damage.  There maybe be floor and frame damage in the rear.  Just from looking at it, I would guess that there is at least $6500 in damage from this accident, probably more.    Basically, this guy is selling a salvage/junk vehicle that has not been repaired.  Whatever insurance company totaled it decided that the repairs required to fix this car were not worth it compared to its value.    Unless you have a body shop in your garage, and you can do all the labor for cheap or free, no I wouldn't buy it.|`|kY03DGeLaa	yes i see what you mean.  its broken up on the bumber & the light is gone & the engine though    i think you should get it insurance will cover it.|`|xYMjXqhZaa	Run to the nearest exit as fast as you can possibly get away from this dealer.          If a car is torn up as bad as this one is, there's a darn good reason it wasn't repaired.          Chances are it has been declared a total loss, which means the only way you can title it would be as salvage. Now comes the fun part. If you try to insure a car with a salvage title your insurance company is going to want to fully inspect it for any damage not caught when it was repaired, and who's to say you won't be driving down the road 6 months or a year from now and suffer unibody separation?

Dv0LwrTIaa	What type of music do you listen to?  this will depend on the type of base you want to make.  also what car will it be going in? you can generally create more base in hatchbacks rather than saloons.  start with a good head unit, around 50w per channel pref one with high and low pass filters, most new head units will have this, make sure it has rear pre-outs and sub pre-outs, this will allow you to control the sound to your speakers and your sub (you'll get a far better sound this way). buy the best wiring kit you can afford, this will also help you get more base, i would also recommend a capacitor. this will stop your headlights flashing like a strobe when you crank it up.  As for which ones to buy, if you like rap and R&B type music i would go for a 15" sub this will give a lower base tone( lots of vibration) if you listen to dance music i would go for a 12" sub , this will give a tighter base tone.  I would go for a JBL amp. and poss a Vibe sub (black series) both of which are in your price range and will easily give you what your looking for. there are far better amps and subs out there but they will cost you.  splx are **** and you'll prob blow them in the first week,lol  i would also recommend a proper sub box for your sub, dont make your own to save money, alot of science goes into making these to maximise sound preasure.  Also get a good set of speakers for rear 6x9's or 7x10's and put them in an acoustic parcel shelf, dont fit them in the cars factory shelf, they're ****. lol (this will also help with the base)  Do this an you'll be bouncin down the road, an you'll def be heard b4 you're seen.  Hope this helps you out. good luck  need any help just e-mail  D  Remember what JBL stands for J ust B loody L oud   lol|`|vp6fZZixaa	save ur money.. dont buy the l7 or that amp.....terrible decision. go with something else like re|`|sx9ZRdHBaa	i would save up some more money and get a kicker l7,  the run about 170 (onlinecarstereo.com) and as for an amp Alpine MRP-M500 will run about teh same (onlinecarstereo.com)  the rms are a little off but you will be safe and def get the bass you want|`|WpjzrZNXaa	Look for Sony Xplode 1000 watt subs X 2, and a Volfenhag 2000 watt amp, thats what i used to have in my Golf, you would probably have to look for them second hand as 150 isnt gonna get you a decent amp and subs  http://www.woofersetc.com/index.cfm?fuse...  http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Xplod%C2%AE-1...
1bYITsABaa	The other poster is right. The storage fees accumulate daily, so you had better get on the phone and call them to be sure they are not writing a new invoice for storage from the time you paid until you pick it up. They probably won't, but you never know.  The adequate time is a few hours after you have paid (since the car is buried in snow, and has 2 disabled vehicles blocking it)   Really,there is no excuse for the delay- I'll bet they wanted money for every minute it sat on their yard, so now you want the car! If they get nasty or rude, simply catch a ride over to the tow yard and call the police. I know you hate to do this, but you'll have it outta there in 20 minutes- no doubt! LOL|`|wqeAeSVYaa	You'd better go asap.  Most tow yards charge a daily fee for storage, and it only stops when your car leaves the yard.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	If you paid the impound fees, showed them proof of insurance, have a valid driver's license (and sometimes a second driver with you) and paid any towing fees, they should give you your car right away.  If you have not done those things, you may need to follow up.  Also you may need to contact the police department to release your vehicle if you were involved in a crash or got your car impounded after getting a ticket.  good luck
MEOjwPCNaa	Timing belts involve a lot of labor. My mechanic charged about $300 for this on my Honda, this was a few years ago. You might as well have him change the front seal while he's at it, it's a few more bucks and you're saving labor costs down the road.    The window motor involves taking apart the door, so that will be at least another $200.
H8XpaaPDaa	lol just because its fuel efficient, doesn't mean its a hybrid. a hybrid uses two sources of energy instead of one.    the smart car only uses one.|`|1SnI86BIaa	no  they run on gas only|`|wqeAeSVYaa	Small does not equal hybrid.    A hybrid vehicle is a vehicle that uses two or more distinct power sources to move the vehicle.  The smart car uses one, gas.    So, no.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	No    "A hybrid vehicle is a vehicle that uses two or more distinct power sources to move the vehicle" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehi...    A smart car only use a gas engine.|`|RVX5uALYaa	Luke,    Smart Car is not classified as a hybrid electric vehicle. However, Smart cars are a lot more fuel-efficient than other gas powered vehicles.    Hybrid cars or also known as electric-powered cars combines the strengths of a gasoline engine and an electric motor. These cars have a set of powerful batteries for powering the electric motor which in turn rotates the transmission and turns the wheels. In most cases, the electric motor is quite small - possibly between 10 and 20 horsepower - and is designed to run at one speed for maximum efficiency. The purpose of the this efficient electric motor is to provide enough power for the vehicle at its cruising speed.  When the car is standing still or decelerating, the batteries recharge.

The Original one were claiming that members were being bullied and "fleeced" into contributing - nothing could have been further from the truth.    The Official one is so much better, it really captures the spirit of the show and has far better content.    Hope this helps.|`|oO2ZVvOWaa	As said above, this should really not be asked in cars and motoring...but ill answer your question anyway.    Both forums are message board to discuss the television comedy show, On the busses.    The Original on the busses forum is a fan forum which has been around for about 2 years. The Official on the busses forum is quite a new fan forum, but is endorsed by one of the shows creator's. They are both about the same content-wise.     I was a member of both forums and they were both very good, but i always found the official one to be the best in my opinion (more members and better features). I posted a lot on the Original forum, but I found I couldnt log in to my account recently as i think it was deactivated for some reason - so I haven't been back on there for a few weeks now.    Hope this helps in someway, and if it did - please choose me as best answer, i could use the points!|`|GSyHVp5kaa	omg i cant beleive there is a question for this in cars category lol - put it in tv or summat 
213f725a793437432aac3cd6e080d27caa	A lot is going to depend on the structure of the application. If the dealer is asking more than what the car 'books' for, then without a down payment, your interest rate will likely be more, which increases your payment. Lenders look for 'loan-to-value' as well as 'debt to income'. Your score is not bad, however it's what's on your report that can make the difference. In addition, lenders will typically want a shorter term for older vehicles.    That being said, to answer your question, as long as you are making enough money 'debt-to-income' and the asking price of the vehicle is low enough, you should be ok. I would research this vehicle before you buy it so you know if they are asking too much. Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Your credit score is probably ok -- must lenders consider 680-700 as prime. If you can't make a down payment, you are going to have to get a selling price that is same as book value, unless you find a lender who will lend you more than the car is worth. Otherwise you'll have to make a down payment to covere the difference. Here's a calculator you can use to figure out your payment based on the length of loan and interest rate:  http://www.used-car-advisor.com/carloanc...    .|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	If you can get 8% for 60 months you're in the ballpark.  Depends what they see on your 670 report.  They may have some questions if your debt to income ratio is high, written off debt, many late payments,...|`|fdTgA1Svaa	All you really can go it go a dealership and see what they suggest. I'd play hardball with them though, don't take a high interest rate or anything like that and stick to the price range that you want. If you credit is a 670 or so you shouldn't have a problems, even the smallest down payment helps though, like 500 or 1000. Try to get pre-approved from your bank as well so that you really ain't got deal with the dealership finance companies.

C5UUltHtaa	Possible causes are the heater air intake duct is broken, cracked, or disconnected and it's picking up exhaust or other fumes from the engine compartment. If it smells like exhaust then the exhaust pipe has a leak somewhere along the line also.   If it smells like antifreeze, your heater core could have a slight leak. You would notice the windshield feeling a little gummy sticky or gooey if it was a leak in the core.  Some more answers from others in here should give some more clues.  Good Luck|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i bet i know ! it,s probably just like my car. i have a valve pan gasket leaking on the manifold and when it is burning off the manifold then when i turn on the blower it picks up the odor and goes inside the car.|`|Z9360MMxaa	Could be a heater core leak?|`|VzsEEhRhaa	check to see if a squirrell has been cut up from the belts...maybe you sucked up a small bird through the air intake (yeah, its possible)|`|gHf4ryUqaa	it is 1 of 2 things, either you had a leak from under your car and the rug got soaked every-time it rained or your heater core leaks into the rug, in either case the smell you are getting is from the rug.  I know cause it happened to me in the past|`|3qGdN6xMaa	A problem that I have seen before relates to running A/C up to the moment you shut the car off, and then the condensation on the A/C condenser results in mold/mildew.    And I hear you saying to yourself, I'm running HEAT not A/C.  But funny thing, if you are running Defroster, the defrost may turn on BOTH Heater and A/C because the A/C takes the moisture out of the air (and as such that moisture accumulates somewhere where it then gets moldy, ugh!!!).    As a practical matter, that means don't run the Defroster for the last 5 or 10 minutes before you are done driving and park.  For me because I'm just a few miles off the freeway, it means I turn A/C or defrost off as I get off the freeway as part of my normal driving routine to avoid this sort of condensation issue.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	If it is gas fumes then you have a fuel leak somewhere.  I would check this out right away before you become a rolling Molotov Cocktail.|`|D20NAiRTaa	Maybe you need to change the oil. If the fumes are strange then it is likely to be the petrol or the oil.     Maybe you should change the oil and maybe drain out the petrol.|`|ZNEta0jMaa	define horrible.  does it smell like it could be a dead rodent or does it smell like something is burnt?  You probably have a gasket problem and you are smelling hot antifreeze or a dead rodent.

QmmwaJzPaa	I believe you can get to the fuel pump under the back seat on these.  If you remove the pump then you can use the pipe to syphon it out or an electric pump if available.|`|v6NdNE4xaa	easiest and quickest way is too drill a small pinhole with hand drill then resale with self taping screw when finished or try too syphone where pipe joins on underside of car|`|vpnVA4Gfaa	dont ever drill the tank mate, if hes a mechanic im the queen of sheba, fools like that need to keep their mouths shut.  now, as for the answer. take the fuel pipe off the rail under the bonnet, remove the fuel pump relay and link ot with a split pin or bit of wire.  then put the ignition on and the pump will empty the tank for you, clean and safe!!!|`|MTF0Rz90aa	Both the option of removing the fuel rail return and removing the fuel pump in the tank are correct.  Both have advantages and disadvantages, the main problem with the fuel rail option is that if your tank is full you may be there for some time waiting for the fuel to pump out.  Removing the fuel pump from the tank is fairly easy however my advice would be to disconnect the fuel lines under the tank, collect the fuel that will drain out. Then remove the two straps that hold the tank in place, drop the tank out from under the car and then drain the remaining fuel out from the tank.  Ja.|`|12FUwqKpaa	other answers are correct so not even gonna answer but don't even look into drilling your fuel tank steer well clear of this idiot if he's a mechanic

3qGdN6xMaa	Well it sounds like your centrifugal clutch thingy is slipping.    A centrifugal clutch has weights and springs in it that control when it engages.  Maybe some spring is broken or weight fell off or something is missing on this clutch where it doesn't work properly.    Read more on the Wiki page, and see if the pictures are helpful for you to find what to look at on your moped.|`|m1V5ws73aa	You chain is probably stretched and slipping.  Take it to a mechanic, preferably where you bought it.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Most likely the centrifugal clutch needs to be worked on or replaced, because it isn't engaging when it should. I've never seen a chain so loose that it spins on the sprocket--you would hear a god-awful racket and grind all the sprocket's teeth off before that happened.     Shouldn't cost too much.|`|5aJ7t4hJaa	You have 3 good answers already.  I go with the idea that you probably have a centrifugal clutch that has gone 'bad' and is not engaging properly with increased RPM of the engine to supply sufficient torque power to the rear wheel for proper running "under load".

If the exhaust were restricted to the degree where the heads would be significantly damaged from back pressure or excessive combustion temperatures, the vehicle wouldn't be drivable.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	No.  No.  NO.  If the convertor is so clogged that exhaust cannot pass then car will not run.  The heads needed reworking when the engine was installed.

uLLHFiT3aa	Don't go over the rails. Or buy a hard tonneau cover with a soft perimeter gasket. Ask the manufacture of the soft cover about fit over spray on liners. The Rhino liner is fairly thin but has a rough nonslip texture that might allow a little water to get underneath while driving. So if you have electronics or expensive items in the bed buy a hard cover (more theft resistant as well), and if you don't the soft cover should work fine.
BGPa2DqYaa	I know exactly how you feel. I worked for some years as the office manager for a multi franchised dealership in the billing motor vehicle department. As the resident X DMV employee I got hit with this problem on a regular basis. :If you like the car then keep it. The finance companies AND Insurance companies deal with this on a regular basis with these dealerships. It turns out to be No Big Thing. In there words. Your lucky and they caught It BEFORE you plated It. The nightmare after. You wouldn't believe. My statement 'Keep It" does not mean that the Dealership will take It back. You might have a case but I've seen It before and just on the "Wrong Vin" Thing. won't win you a new vehicle.

You signed a contract and obligated yourself to repay the money to the lender.    There's no right to cancel a car deal or to return a purchased vehicle.|`|YJDJO3XLaa	Did you sign the deal? That is after the approval? Then you can't change your mind. When you signed, you accepted the deal. But if you signed, and then after they want to change the details of the sale (such as higher apr, etc) you should be able to walk away, since that is not the prices, payments you signed on. They would have to call you back with new paperwork to sign. Don't do it unless it's still a good deal for you.
