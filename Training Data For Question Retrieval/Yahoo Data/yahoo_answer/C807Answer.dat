Split one open and spread some fresh butter<br>  (actually, we always used margerine), or slip in a<br>  fresh sausage patty. There's nothing better! <br>  <br>  After I learned to make them I also enjoyed just getting<br>  my hand dirty as I kneaded the dough. Kids have fun in<br>  the strangest way. Anyway, here is how my grandma used <br>  to make them. I don't think the store-bought, canned <br>  biscuits will ever even begin to compare.<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  3 cups all purpose flour<br>  3 teaspoons baking powder<br>  3/4 cups buttermilk<br>  1 teaspoon salt<br>  3/4 teaspoon baking soda<br>  3/4 cup Crisco shortening<br>  <br>  Sift the flour to make sure there are no lumps. Add in<br>  the baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Add the <br>  Crisco slowly, working it into the dry ingredients. <br>  You can use a large spatula or spoon, but I preferred<br>  using my hands. <br>  <br>  Next add the buttermilk, working it into the mixture <br>  too. After everything is thoroughly mixed, plop it<br>  down on a floured counter top or cutting board. <br>  <br>  Turn you oven to 450 to allow it to preheat. While<br>  it's heating up knead your dough until it is about<br>  the consistency of clay that kids play with in<br>  grade school. You can make it a little dryer<br>  if need be by sprinkling more flour on your<br>  counter or cutting board. As you knead your dough<br>  it will pick up more of the flour. <br>  <br>  After you have it the right consistency you can <br>  shape your biscuits by hand or using a cookie <br>  cutter. I preferred pinching off a chunk, rolling<br>  it into a ball, and then patting it a little flat.<br>  It takes a little practice to get you biscuits all<br>  about the same size. If you want them more perfect,<br>  you can roll out your dough using a rolling pin and<br>  then cut them with a round cookie cutter. That <br>  would look neater when you have company over.<br>  <br>  Anyway, place you biscuits on a cookie sheet that<br>  is either lightly greased or lightly sprinkled with<br>  flour. If you use the flour option, be sure not to<br>  put too much. <br>  <br>  Bake these biscuits for rougly 18 minutes on the <br>  middle rack in your oven (depends upon how hot<br>  your oven is and how far this rack is from the<br>  top). If the rack is too low you can move the<br>  biscuits to the top rack the last minute of so<br>  to get them browned just the way you want. Leave<br>  them on the middle rack and thy should turn out<br>  lightly browned. <br>  <br>  Pop them out of the over and eat them while still<br>  piping hot. That's the only way to get the butter<br>  to melt just right. <br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|xc8bnpCvaa	2 cups flour<br>  1 teaspoon baking powder<br>  1/4 cup shortening or butter softened<br>  buttermilk (pour in small amounts until batter is thick but pasty) <br>  <br>  Flour your counter or tape down wax paper slick side up<br>  You can roll out dough and cut biscuits or pinch off dough and hand roll or "drop" onto baking sheet<br>  bake at 350-375 until tops are LIGHTLY browned|`|d19faee87d87426beb4d19828a1ffbdaaa	10  southern style buttermilk biscuits<br>  <br>  2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the board (if you can get White Lily flour, your biscuits will be even better) <br>  1/4 teaspoon baking soda <br>  1 tablespoon baking powder (use one without aluminum) <br>  1 teaspoon kosher salt or salt <br>  6 tablespoons unsalted butter, very cold <br>  3/4 cup buttermilk (approx) <br>  Directions<br>  Preheat your oven to 450Â°F. <br>  Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, or in the bowl of a food processor. <br>  Cut the butter into chunks and cut into the flour until it resembles course meal. <br>  If using a food processor, just pulse a few times until this consistency is achieved. <br>  Add the buttermilk and mix JUST until combined. <br>  If it appears on the dry side, add a bit more buttermilk. <br>  Turn the dough out onto a floured board. <br>  Gently, gently PAT (do NOT roll with a rolling pin) the dough out until it's about 1/2" thick. <br>  Use a round cutter to cut into rounds. ( I use a drinking glass )<br>  You can gently knead the scraps together and make a few more, but they will not be anywhere near as good as the first ones. <br>  Place the biscuits on a cookie sheet- if you like soft sides, put them touching each other. <br>  If you like"crusty" sides, put them about 1 inch apart- these will not rise as high as the biscuits put close together. <br>  Bake for about 10-12 minutes- the biscuits will be a beautiful light golden brown on top and bottom. <br>  Do not overbake. <br>   The key to real biscuits is not in the ingredients, but in the handling of the dough. <br>  The dough must be handled as little as possible or you will have tough biscuits.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	Take that can and wrap it in your hand<br>  Bang that sucker til the dough expands<br>  Put them suckers all in your oven<br>  Grab your girlie and get a little lovin'<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-1g-J-8th4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-1g-J-8t...</a><br>  (Disclaimer: I have no sound on this computer, so I hope that video is the song I think it is.)<br>  <br>  Ok, enough with the giggles (can you tell I'm a child of the 80's?).<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  3 cups all purpose flour<br>  3 teaspoons baking powder<br>  3/4 cups buttermilk<br>  1 teaspoon salt<br>  3/4 teaspoon baking soda<br>  3/4 cup Crisco shortening<br>  <br>  Sift the flour to make sure there are no lumps.

It does melt, though, and sometimes lends its subtle Crayola flavor to the food.  Parchment paper is impregnated with silicone, and will not melt at oven temperatures.|`|CeXKPtCRaa	No, wax paper will melt before it hits 150oF/65oC.  I forget the exact temperature, but wax paper should be used for cold temperature or room temperature uses only, not when cooking.

I prefer to use butter or olive oil, neither of which contain hydrogenated oils. For the same reasons, I prefer to make pie crusts and biscuits from scratch rather than buying prepared products. This also saves money and they are much better fresh and homemade. You will find that they really aren't that hard to make. <br>  <br>  Freezer Meat <br>  Most weeks feature recipes that use quick and easy ingredients like chicken from the freezer. This is a way that we save prep time in the evening. When a recipe calls for ground beef, instead of browning one pound of ground beef, buy 5 lbs. and brown all of it, freezing the extra in 4 freezer bags. When you need cooked chicken for a soup or casserole, instead of cooking just enough for that recipe, boil or grill 3-4 extra lbs. for the freezer. When we cook a ham, we dice the leftovers and bag them in freezer bags in 1-2 cup portions for later use in cooking beans or soup. Here is a wonderful recipe for cooking chicken in bulk. Have grilled chicken for dinner the night you cook it, then chop and freeze the leftovers in dated freezer bags.<br>  <br>  Grilled Marinated Chicken <br>  4 lbs. chicken parts of your choice <br>  1/2 cup red wine vinegar <br>  1 cup soy sauce <br>  1/2 cup vegetable oil <br>  2 tsp. oregano <br>  1 tsp. basil <br>  1 tsp. garlic salt or Adobo <br>  1/2 tsp. pepper <br>  Place marinade with chicken in a zipper bag and marinate overnight. Grill chicken until it reaches 160Â° at the thickest part, or until white all the way through and juices run clear. Serve half of the chicken tonight and save the rest for tomorrow. If you do not have a grill, you can bake the chicken in the oven. <br>  <br>  A good way to start stocking your freezer is to buy 10 lbs. of ground beef when it goes on sale. Brown 5 lbs. as described above, and with the rest make this mixture: 5 lbs. of ground beef, 5 eggs, and *lots* of Adobo seasoning. You may add some bread crumbs if you wish. Shape patties for hamburger (to be frozen with wax paper between each one, or individually frozen and then bagged once frozen), then take the extra meat and divide it equally between a meatloaf and meatball shapes for the freezer. Individually freeze the meatballs on a cookie sheet, then put into dated freezer bags. This will give you 5 lbs. of cooked beef for casseroles, tacos, enchiladas, soups, and more, as well as homemade patties for hamburgers (2 meals), a meatloaf, and meatballs (2 meals). <br>  <br>  If you are just starting Menus 4 Moms you will need cook this meat since you won't have it in the freezer. Go ahead and take this time to add a few pounds of whichever meat you are cooking to your list and when you cook for the dish, put the extra in the freezer. If you consistently do this, you will always have extra meat in the freezer for those days when prep time is at a minimum. The best way to store your freezer meat is in quart-sized freezer bags. <br>  <br>  Occasionally you will see taco-seasoned ground beef mentioned also. The same principle applies: instead of seasoning one pound of ground beef for tacos, cook several pounds and freeze the extra in one pound increments. <br>  <br>  Freezer Onions and Peppers<br>  The same principle of bulk cooking can be applied to onions and green peppers either individually or together. If your recipe calls for a sauteed onion, instead of sauteing one onion, buy a whole bag of onions, chop them all and freeze in casserole-sized servings. When you have these meal-sized portions of meat and vegetables, it is a cinch to throw together a quick meal late in the afternoon.<br>  <br>  If you are just starting Menus 4 Moms, you will not have sauteed onions in your freezer. Go ahead and use this time to cook a bag of onions and/or green bell peppers so you will have them ready in your freezer. These are also best stored in quart-sized freezer bags. <br>  <br>  Adobo seasoning<br>  Adobo is a Filipino spice that is mostly made up of garlic salt. If you need a substitution, garlic salt is the best one although I would use less. Adobo is inexpensive (less than $2 for a large bottle) and can be found with the Latino foods at most grocery stores. If you can't find it, you can make a substitute.<br>  <br>  Adobo Seasoning<br>  <br>  4 tablespoons salt <br>  3 tablespoons onion powder <br>  3 tablespoons garlic powder 3 tablespoons ground black pepper <br>  2 tablespoons ground oregano <br>  Put all ingredients in a jar with a tight fitting lid.

But I can honestly say I have never seen anybody drink tea with a straw before.<br>  <br>  Tea is good for you. Some more than others. Some herbal teas have specific reasons for why they are consumed. Unless stated otherwise though most tea is just black tea. This includes just tea, iced tea, earl grey, and english tea among others. If it concerns you just check the label. Black tea has more caffeine in it than other teas do. It has 50mg per serving.<br>  <br>  The maximum daily amount of safe caffeine intake per day is 300mg.

It also is known to aid good digestion and some teas like camomile have calming properties. Tea is also known to hydrate you very well, so yes its good for you and as long as you brush your teeth twice a day - morning and night - it should make very little difference to the colour of your teeth.

AA10698792	The comment about stainless isn't entirely true...you need to make sure that the cookware you get has a good heavy bottom and the heat will distribute evenly.<br>  <br>  I swear by my All-Clad, but no one set of cookware will give you exactly what you need to do every job.  You will need an iron skillet...these are cheap and many come pre-seasoned.  My set came with a large lidded pot made for stews but I prefer my iron dutch oven for this and use the stainless one for soups and boiling pasta.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't need a big set of cookware...a 10 to 12 inch skillet, a sauce pan maybe a quart or 2 depending on how many people you cook for regularly, and a large pot for the aforementioned pasta and soup.<br>  <br>  This is the set that I got: <a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?order_num=-1&SKU=100154" rel="nofollow">http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product....</a><br>  I inherited two iron skillets from my grandmother (something most chefs would kill for)<br>  and I bought a Staub Cast Iron Dutch Oven (got it on ebay, didn't pay nearly that much) <a href="http://www.abesofmaine.com/item.do?item=STB1102625&id=STB1102625&l=YAHOO" rel="nofollow">http://www.abesofmaine.com/item.do?item=...</a> <br>  <br>  Teflon is safe as long as it doesn't become scratched or start peeling off|`|hosyXVKFaa	You're right that plain stainless steel cookware doesn't heat as evenly as the heavy cast aluminum or iron.

hV43wyvJaa	I say no. There is a slicing attachment with most food processors, but it is limited in the width of the slice. Also, the food chute would only allow you to put maybe a half a pepper down the chute, where it would get sliced crosswise, not lengthwise as you would for a fajita.<br>  <br>  As long as you must cut the pepper to get the seeds and membranes out, it's only another second slice it lengthwise. Remember to slice from INSIDE the pepper for safety (the knife can slip off the smooth skin)|`|awETDHnnaa	yes i do it all the time|`|6GHtXQzTaa	As long as you have the piece that says slice on it correctly, it's a little thin but saves time.

It goes well with any fruit, especially rhubarb (now that WILL upset a lot of people) and is definitely habit-forming.  SO much better than low-fat yoghurt!  I really can't imagine how anyone could dislike it. <br>  <br>  I also like the taste of kippers but can't stand the bones.  When I was a child, kippers were a regular appearance on the menu; it took me about 2 hours to eat mine, as I never could stand fish-bones; to me, it was like eating fishy hair.  It still is.|`|syrJCT3Taa	Well I have no  idea about custard, but I've looked up "kippers", and I think I speak on behalf of the masses when I say we're skeptical.
X0E5vGftaa	There is actually more caffeine in the tea plant than in coffee beans. However by the time it is harvested, processed and made there is more caffeine in a prepared cup of coffee than in tea. Tea has 50mg per serving and coffee starts at 85mg.<br>  <br>  Some people don't respond to caffeine so you may not be getting a boost because of that. Caffeine takes more water to process than the drinks provide so it takes extra water from our bodies. This dehydrates us and we feel tired when we are dehydrated. Since a serving of coffee has more caffeine than a serving of tea it will dehydrate you more making you feel more tired.<br>  <br>  Next time drink 2 glasses of water with the coffee. It will offset the caffeine plus water is a natural energizer. See if that makes a difference. With tea you will only need a glass of water to offset the caffeine. Actually I tell people the rule of thumbs 1 ounce of water to offset 5mg of caffeine.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Black, brewed tea has more caffeine than coffee.  Regular coffee has more caffeine than espresso.  Coke & Pepsi have more caffeine than any of them .....  Sugar will give you a quick energy burst, but you'll crash later, feeling even more tired than you did before|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	Some black teas actually have more caffeine than coffee does!  But I don't think that's the problem.  I personally can't drink coffee, because it mellows me out way too much..if I am tired at all, then drinking coffee is like taking a sedative.  I just pass out!  Energy drinks like Monster, and anything packed with sugar will have me bouncing all over the place, but I just can't handle caffeine for some reason.  <br>  Other people have this problem too, so we aren't the only ones!

Although rice has protein in it, it is incomplete protein, missing essential amino acids.  Likely, you have stored up a goodly amount of these and a week without them would not cause much of a problem but more than that and you will.  You have to supplement that protein with either a different vegetable based protein that has the missing amino acids (beans, for example) or eat a small amount of complete protein from meat.

If you've had tacos and stir-fry and have liked both, try making a veggie taco. You could grill or stir-fry some vegetables and put it in a taco shell.

There are still a lot of foods you can eat, like enfrijoladas, gorditas, tamales, picaditas, quesadillas, and even burritos, just use beans instead of meat.  And also you could make yourself a vegetarian posole using vegetable broth. Just watch out for the rice cuz if you use norsuisa that's got chicken in it. When going out to eat, some of the chain Mexican restaurants even carry vegetarian options. <br>  The point that I'm trying to make is that it's really not that hard to be mexican and a vegetarian. Your family will give you lots of crap for it but it's just something you'll have to put up with or else stand up for your beliefs.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	If it will make you happy, go for it!

It takes work to be a full vegetarian - and it's actually important to talk to a doctor before making that change.

No matter what you eat or don't eat, you will gain weight without a balance between food and exercise. <br>  But vegetarianism is healthier in many more aspects, especially vegan. I have been a vegetarian since I was six years old in first grade. I am just as healthy now as I was then, if not healthier. I have read numerous articles on the subject. I suggest doing a little researching; it's actually really interesting. <br>  Whatever your reasoning, it would ultimately be the best choice (in my opinion and in fact). The animals would thank you, as well as your body (:|`|5xTfZi4Taa	There are a lot of "big" people who are vegetarians.  That's definitely not a reason to choose that lifestyle.  Meat is a great source of protein and there are a lot of lean meats out there.  If you're concerned about gaining weight, do some research on what a healthy diet is and try to maintain that.|`|u6cFXfPnaa	Your question is silly! Being Mexican doesn't have anything to do with whether you should be a vegetarian. I understand what you mean tho - that the culture and the food relies on a lot of meat. I love Mexican food, and I manage to eat it a lot as a vegan. There are options other than meat if you want to enjoy the flavors and spices of Mexican food. There's the obvious -rice and beans. You can do endless things with rice and beans, and corn. I like having quinoa with beans and sauteed zucchini and corn. You can have chille rellenos, quesadillas, bean and cheese burritos, cheese or bean enchiladas, etc. if you continue to eat cheese. So there are options there. <br>  <br>  And if you become a vegetarian, one of the great things is that you can learn about food and cooking and experience all the other great flavors out there. Of course the standard American diet relies a lot on meat, but many Americans still find ways to be vegetarians. Just because you're family continues to eat meat doesn't mean you have to. You can show them what you can make without it and how great tasting other things are. There are also many cuisines to explore - Asian food is wonderful for vegetarian options. <br>  <br>  So, if you want to be a vegetarian, don't let your families choices or your cultural identity stop you. It's doable. And there are many health benefits to not eating meat and to limiting your intake of dairy, as well as ethical and environmental benefits. Do some reading on vegetarianism and if you want to, give it a try! It can't hurt to see what it's like.
333RB4n4aa	Not only heating, but freezing plastic products causes the release of dioxin carcinogens into your system, which have been linked to cancer.  Also many plastics are manufactured with a synthetic form of estrogen called bisphenol-A (or BPA).  It is an endocrine disruptor which can accelerate cell division in pre-cancer cells.  This can prompt tumors to metastasize.  Many medical professionals also advise against drinking out of a water bottle that has been left in a car for the same reason.  And as hot as it might get in your car, I would venture to guess it's well below 400 degrees.<br>  <br>  While, I didn't find anything on cooking foods with plastic spatulas, I wouldn't advise cooking your food with plastic utensils...just to be on the safe side.|`|CkbgiHyqaa	the plastic will melt and it will taste bad...nothing serious is going to happen unless you eat it everyday for the next 10 years...lol|`|AA10102704	You can use a Silicone spatula but not plastic. Silicone can withstand higher temperatures without  melting. Plastic would melt in the hot oil of the bacon and that would not taste good or be very healthy.

Boil and shread up chicken ( you can used whole, legs, thighs or breasts) what ever you like. Put chicken into a skillet and add a packet of taco seasoning and hot sauce or chili powder, and some water. Heat until sauce thickens. Heat corn tortillas in a skillet until soft and pliable. Have on hand some shredded lettuce, cheese, cabbage, chopped onion, tomatoes and radishes. Fill the tortillas with chicken and top with what the teens like. I use two kinds of cheese Mexican Cotija it's a dry smelly yet delicious cheese and Monterrey Jack either spicy or regular. Beans and rice are great for an accompaniment. If you want a somewhat more sophisticated menu try Martha Stewart or Paula Deen their recipes have never failed to impress my family and friends. I have found that almost everyone likes tacos and they haven't failed me yet.

e8b18ec35b31a002daa415cda610a727aa	The absolute best French toast ever... <br>  <br>  Use sour dough bread if you can - makes it that much better<br>  <br>  Depending on the amount of toast you are going to make add more eggs...Basically you start out with about 2-3 eggs, beat them with milk (maybe 1/4 cup) and add one teaspoon of vanilla.  <br>  <br>  Cut your bread (if it's not already sliced) about 1/2 inch thick.  <br>  <br>  Preheat your pan so that a drop of water immediately beads and steams off the pan.  <br>  <br>  Spray your pan with oil, or give it a light coating (LIGHT!!!).  <br>  <br>  Dip your bread in your egg mixture, and place in your pan.  Cook until it's good and brown on that side, then flip it and continue to cook on the opposite side.  Total of 3-4 minutes tops.  <br>  <br>  Drizzle with syrup or add cinnamon.  Either way - yummy!|`|463981cb07d3286b2d8b5c7f6f04a42daa	French Toast is made with eggs, sugar, vanilla, , i use a mixer to make sure all ingredients are mixed well, and use Texas Toast instead of reg.

When you must split an egg, im not sure but first, beat it into yellowish mush, then measure it, and add half of it to the other ingredients.|`|OzAcn50qaa	well i doubt you can half this recipe so if you have leftovers save it or throw it away|`|0b508e8a46ceb076d498c94707fa4b1aaa	Yes. If the recipe calls for 1 egg I go ahead and use the whole egg. Preferably a small one.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	leave the egg and if there is other liquid, you could reduce it by a tablespoon|`|J2Y5zx4Saa	Yes you should half everything if you want it to turn out just like the original. As far as the egg, it depends on the recipe...if it calls for a large egg you could use a smaller one, or if it says lightly beaten you could beat it first and then divide it up. If you leave it as is, it could work, but it would depend on the recipe. It could create more moisture than is needed.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind some recipes are quite hard to cut down by half do I would suggest possibly looking for a different recipe for a similar dish/item that doesnt make as much.|`|S1S0pxHQaa	Leave the egg, its only 1 egg is it won't make much of a difference.

CeXKPtCRaa	My best suggestion is to put a sheet pan on the bottom rack of the oven.  Sometimes, the heating coil radiates too much heat directly to the product.  If you put a sheet pan (cookie sheet) at the bottom of the oven, it will block all the heat, and the cake will only receive heat from the hot air in the oven, which is your goal.  This will make a more evenly baked cake, and hopefully (probably) more moist!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I like to substitute yogurt or sour cream for all, or most, of the water or milk called for in a recipe.

jBuu657raa	You need:<br>  <br>  1-2 oz. vodka<br>  1 oz. apple pucker<br>  a splash of lime juice<br>  fill with sour.<br>  <br>  This is if you're making the drink in a martini glass, or a glass that holds about 4 ounces.  If you're using a bigger glass, I suggest assing some Sprite to fill the glass.  You don't want too much alcohol (it will obviously just make you drunk) and too much lime juice and sour mix will make your stomach turn.<br>  <br>  I always suggest adding the portions to the martini glass to make sure it's the right amount (don't want to make too much or too little), then dump it into a shaker with ice, and pour.

You can get all the nutrients you need from plant-based sources, and B12 from supplements and/or foods fortified with it, plus it is in dairy. Be sure to get enough protein, and enough iron, but it's not as hard as it might seem. If you eat vegetables every day, and eat beans and other healthy things when you can you should be fine. Just don't fill up on junk all the time. :) I've been vegetarian for years, and I'm in very good health.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Nothing unhealthy about being a vegetarian, so nothing wrong with that.  The Vegan diet is dangerous.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I would ask your doctor or a dietician on protein and other vitamins supplements you will need to substitute for the meat.  It is not a bad thing...and also the dr. I work for and my cousin are actually vegan....and it's almost scary on how healthy and energetic they are.  As long as you seek medical advice on the proper way to eat...you should be fine.  Good luck!

There are a lot of reasons as to why people become veg...  religion, personal taste, personal philosophies, animal cruelty, etc.  Personally, I was 16 when I became a vegetarian and it wasn't the easiest thing to do, but I'm really glad I stuck with it.  I used to eat meat but after awhile it just didn't taste good anymore and I started making more of a literal connection about what I was eating.  <br>  <br>  You can definitely get protein from the items you mentioned, including milk, soy products, cheese, eggs, lentils, etc.  Take a look at the Food network website and look up vegetarian recipes.  There are a lot of options!  Ultimately, it's a personal decision and my opinion is that the people who can stick with it are the people that have the strongest convictions about why they are vegetarian, no matter what the reason.|`|bc0NTxNUaa	It's one of the healthiest choices you can make concerning food! :D<br>  Although I don't consider fish-eaters as vegetarians. My definition of vegetarian is someone who doesn't eat animals, and fish are indeed classified as animals. <br>  Your friends sound a lot more supportive of my friends :P <br>  Although I know for a fact that I'm the healthiest of the group and I'm going to be the one helping to save the planet, so it doesn't matter :D<br>  But yes!!!!! You should convert! Its a lovely lifestyle and makes you feel good when you can look at a cow and know that's not going to be in your stomach. <br>  **Been vegetarian since I was 7, and I'm neverrr going back (:|`|UejZWThIaa	I used to eat meat a lot growing up because my family dose eat meat also I didn't know anything about where it came from or how we got it and I was so young at the time I ate anything that was on my plate except for Brussels sprouts which I hate.         <br>  <br>  Then about 5 or 6 years ago I became a vegetarian after watching a wild horse documentary on tv, I watched the baby horses run around and play as well as the adult animals I thought to myself "How Can I eat them, What did they ever do to me, I'm a monster".     This counts for all animals because I don't eat horses or any other animal what so ever.               Then I slowly gave up meat first Beef then Pork, and in the middle of October 2008 of last year I gave up fish and chicken all together, and I feel great about it I have not gotten sick with a cold or any other sickness since I gave up eating meat of any kind except fake meat, you can't even tell the difference once you get used to the taste.               <br>  <br>  But I feel great about my decision and I will never go back, and once you have been a vegetarian for a while like me your taste for real meat will diminish mine sure did I don't miss it at all.|`|H8KQh4Jkaa	you won't burn in hell if your not a vegan...<br>  it's actually healthier to be a vegetarian than to be a meat eater:) <br>  I mean I'm not a veget. but I still try not to have meat on wed. and fri. <br>  It's perfectly fine to become one if you want to live long and healthy. =) Good luck!|`|HhfqLSXIaa	Kind of,see your body doesn't have room for only one thing.I have read that kids have been giving up meat.Doctors say just what I say,your body doesn't have room for only one thing.

XdG7vCxhaa	Part of our food preferences is based in how we have had them prepared in the past and what associations we make subconsciously when we are faced with ones that we don't like.  One of the best ways to expand the types of food that you like is to take what was called<br>  "a no thank you helping" when I was growing up. <br>  <br>  At any time we were served something that we did not like we had to take about 1 tablespoon to taste it.  If we did not like it then we ate what ever else was served for that meal.  Mom always made sure that there was enough other choices that we never went hungry.  If we ended up liking it then we ate what we chose of it.  It will take several trial of a food to really determine if you don't like it at all.  It took  me years to decide that lobster really was something that I liked, much to the dismay of my then boyfriend when I finally decided that it was good. (tee hee hee).<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is as simple as how the food is prepared, Sweet potatoes baked in their skins have a different taste/texture than those that have been boiled and candied for example.<br>  <br>  Less well done beef has a sweeter taste than well done<br>  Pork chops with bones have more flavor than boneless<br>  Pasture raised beef, pork, chicken will have a different/better in my mind, taste than meat from large producers.<br>  <br>  Fresh vegetables and fruits in season that are locally grown will taste much better than those that have been shipped from a distance.  Tomatoes are an especially good example of this.<br>  <br>  More exotic foods/national dishes can be sampled and tried to see which ones you like.  If you can go to a buffet of that particular region you will have a chance to try several dishes and may find ones that you enjoy.  <br>  <br>  It is wonderful that you are open to expanding your choices.  Best wishes|`|MlOXHc0waa	Try one new food at a time. Eat it with other food that you do like. Example: Regular meal=steak, potatoes and corn. Say you don't like cauliflower, but put some on your plate along with the others. Add cheese or your favorite seasonings to veggies. Sugar helps, too. (Carrots and brown sugar.) For meats, try different sauces that you do enjoy. Be creative. Try the food in a non-traditional way (cook it differently from the norm; intead of smoked salmon, try grilled or in a dip. Eat veggies raw and fruits cooked). Finally, accept that there will just be some foods that you will never like and that's okay. Hope that helped!|`|yULV67HDaa	\\go to some better resauraunts|`|Enu1pmuYaa	try different recipes of ways of different ways to prpare things you dont like to other ways then you like

Let each person choose their favorite to use during the party.  Do a quick wash before they leave, and let them take home the teacup with their favorite tea as a party favor!<br>  *  If your friends are new to the tea world, then you can buy several different flavors of tea for everyone to try, sort of like a "tea tasting".  <br>  * Keep a kettle of hot water constantly going<br>  * "Who AM I?" game is fun.  This game starts by pasting labels on the backs of the guests (just use paper and pin/tape them on if you don't have time to get the labels). The guests obviously can't see their own labels but can see others. Choose from a suggested list of TV and movie characters- or choose your own "set" of characters or objects. They then ask each other yes/no questions and try to figure out who they are. This takes about 15-20 minutes.<br>  <br>  * The VERY BEST idea for this kind of party is to host a murder mystery.  <a href="http://www.merrimysteries.com/tmm/girlp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.merrimysteries.com/tmm/girlp....</a>   It is a ton of fun trying to guess who "did it", and everyone has a chance to interact.

My favorites were the gazpacho which is a cold vegetable soup with croutons on top, hot vegetable soup made with artichokes and an egg and potato tortilla. The egg and potato tortilla was usually eaten at room temp or cool with a big slice of asiago cheese. My Spanish 'mother' would pack that along with fruit and good crusty bread if I needed a lunch on the go. I would think you could make a couple of tortillas, cut them into bite size pieces and everyone could try it. I also would serve it with some good cheese and bread. You can look up recipes once you have an idea about what you want to make.

Nella parte anteriore della cornea dei nostri occhi sono presenti delle terminazioni nervose che rilevano tali sostanze irritanti e sollecitano il nervo ciliare che solitamente invia messaggi di dolore. Il cervello interpreta questa attivitÃ  nervosa come una sensazione di bruciore provocata da un'irritazione dell'occhio, che in realtÃ  non si verifica, e invia comunque segnali, a livello delle fibre che innervano le ghiandole lacrimali, provocando cosÃ¬ una copiosa lacrimazione in grado di lavare le presunte sostanze irritanti. <br>  Pare che chi indossi lenti a contatto sia immune a questo effetto, Ã¨ probabile che i piccoli dischi di fibra ottica creino una sorta di isolamento protettivo.|`|Q6TV56G9aa	perchÃ¨ il nostro subconscio sa che erano delle brave cipolle e che stiamo compiendo solo un'insano gesto di egoismo..cosa ti ha fatto la cipolla?|`|WQMTYbadaa	Da Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  "As onions are sliced, cells are broken, allowing enzymes called alliinases to break down sulfides and generate sulfenic acids (amino acid sulfoxides). Sulphenic acids are unstable and decompose into a volatile gas called syn-propanethial-S-oxide.

ephBKMthaa	I'd cut a slit in the side of the chicken breast and stuff it, with whatever I have around.  Onions and Apples, bread stuffing, cheese and ham, leftover veggies - whatever - you could even chop up some of that shrimp you have - yum.   Add a can of slightly diluted cream of chicken or mushroom soup over the top of it, sprinkle some parmesan cheese then bake it in a 350 oven for a hour.  Check to be sure it's done, could take longer if it's bone in.  Serve it with noodles or mashed potatoes and a fresh vegie.   It's quick and easy.|`|2b7ErdOqaa	Cut your chicken breasts into strips.  Saute them in a skillet with a little olive oil.  When no longer pink, set aside.  Then cook up some pasta or noodles, make a nice alfredo sauce (very simple to make) by melting 1/2 cube butter in a skillet, once it's totally melted, add cream and stir to mix.  Then add some garlic powder - I add about as much as you would black pepper and give it a stir.  Cook your noodles in the boiling water for exactly 10 minutes, drain, and add into the cream mixture along with some shredded Parmesan cheese (not the stuff in the green can).  Give it a stir and add your chicken strips and your wonderful shrimp (since the shrimp is already cooked, you're just heating it up.  The sauce will start to thicken from the cheese.  If too thick, add more cream.  Once the whole thing is hot, serve!!  A nice garlic bread on the side and a wonderful salad would round out the perfect meal.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|jHcblhmVaa	Put the chicken in a foil pouch, with onion wine garlic, or what ever you like with your chicken.  Make sure that you are adding some liquid.  Seal the pouch and bake it at 300 or so for about an hour. And raw shrimp that have been cooked? Many recipes will work.

Your choice of veggies with this which could include onions, celery, carrots, bok choy, pea pods, bean sprouts, water chestnuts, broccoli, etc. A nice broth for it is a combination of hot water with 1 tsp chicken base dissolved in it, soy sauce, sesame oil, oyster sauce, 1 tsp ground ginger, and black pepper to taste. When you cook the chicken, sprinkle some of the sesame oil on it as it cooks.<br>  <br>  Cooked chicken, cubed and made into a nice Waldorf salad made with the chicken, grapes - halved, diced apple with peel, mayonnaise with a little curry and either walnuts or pecans. Pineapple is also good in it with some of the pineapple juice mixed into the mayonnaise/curry mixture.<br>  <br>  Cooked chicken - cubed and made into a nice casserole made with cream of mushroom soup, curry, mayonnaise, steamed broccoli, shredded cheddar cheese, bread crumbs, and dotted with butter. Put the broccoli in the bottom of the casserole dish, top with the chicken, then mix together the soup, curry, and mayonnaise and spread that over the chicken. Then a nice layer of shredded cheddar cheese, bread crumbs on top of that and dot it with butter. Bake 350o 30 minutes or until bubbly.<br>  <br>  Chicken soup<br>  <br>  Schnitzel with the chicken - pound the chicken breast so it's an even thickness. Sprinkle with black pepper and bread crumbs. Brown in a skillet on both sides in a little oil. Remove from the skillet and place on a cookie sheet or rack in a cookie sheet and bake 350o for 15 minutes. Make a nice gravy to go with it and your choice of potatoes, cole slaw or sauerkraut, or whatever you wish with it.<br>  <br>  Chicken and Dumplings<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|AA12145628	KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID!<br>  HEALTHY IN A HURRY<br>  <br>     <br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  ADVERTISEMENT<br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  Healthy Chicken Thigh Recipes: Pick of the Chick<br>  <br>  <br>  Featured Recipe: Chicken Thighs with Pear & Leek Sauce<br>  <br>  Flavor, frugality and other reasons to love chicken thighs<br>  By Joyce Hendley; recipes from the EatingWell Test Kitchen EatingWell September/October 2008<br>  <br>  Healthy Chicken Recipes<br>  <br>  If you want to put a chicken dinner on the table quickly, you already know the words âskinlessâ and âbonelessâ are godsends. But choose thighs over those omnipresent breasts, and youâre in for a treat. First, youâll save money, since thighs donât command breastsâ premium prices. But the biggest bonus? More flavor, notes food scientist Harold McGee in On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen. Darker meat âcontains more materials with the -potential for generating flavor,â he explains, including fat particles and substances that help break down flavor components. Thereâs also a little more iron and almost twice the zincânot bad for a small increment in calories (177 calories and 6 grams fat for 3 ounces of thigh versus 138 calories and 3 grams fat for breast). <br>  <br>  Without skin, thigh meat moves into âlean meatâ territory; with a few easy snips you can -remove even more fat (see box, page 38). But the slightly higher fat content is also a plus, since it makes thigh meat more forgiving of overcooking. Try thighs in any of these four quick recipes and youâll be glad you crossed over to the dark side. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Thigh Master: Youâll need about 11?2 pounds untrimmed boneless, skinless chicken thighs to serve four people. For recipes that call for one large thigh per person, buy them at the butcher counter; prepackaged thighs vary dramatically in size. Ask for four 6-ounce boneless, skinless thighs. To trim them well, we like to use kitchen shears to snip the fat away from the meat. After trimming, youâll have four 4-ounce portions. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  4 Healthy Chicken Thigh Recipes<br>  Chicken Thighs with Pear & Leek Sauce <br>  Pineapple-Teriyaki Chicken <br>  Stuffing-Topped Chicken <br>  Tortilla Soup <br>  More Chicken Recipes <br>  <br>  <br>  More Chicken Recipes and Articles<br>  Healthy Chicken Recipes and Cooking Tips <br>  Quick and Healthy Chicken Recipes <br>  Meat and Poultry Buyer's Guide <br>  <br>  Stay current with the latest issue of EatingWell.

It saves money and has great flavor. I just defrost them in the microwave before use. They're great for EW Oven-Fried Chicken (leftovers make great sandwhiches) and they really add flavor to the Tea Trade Chicken recipe - making it even more outstanding. I do still prefer chicken breasts for salads.<br>  <br>  Errin, Spokane, WA <br>  Using hot water to thaw does not "nuke" the meat. A baggie, with as much air as possible removed, in hot water with a weight on top to hold it under will thaw almost anything in 5-10 minutes and it does not start the cooking process.<br>  <br>  John, Cloudcroft, NM <br>  Please - more low sodium recipes!!!<br>  <br>  Leslie Palmer, Swampscott, MA|`|UxrC2n9Kaa	My favorite is to simmer balsamic vinegar, garlic & rosemary until it thickens.

If not, skip it.<br>  <br>  Lemon Curd Tart <br>  Acidic ingredients, such as citrus juice, tomatoes, vinegar, wine and many vegetables, will react with certain metals, including aluminum or cast iron. Therefore, recipes that include these ingredients, such as lemon curd and pastry cream, call for the use of non-aluminum pans. Stainless-steel and enamel-lined pans are excellent choices. <br>   <br>  1 rolled-out round of basic tart dough** (recipe below)<br>  3 whole eggs plus 3 egg yolks, lightly beaten<br>  3/4 cup sugar<br>  3/4 cup fresh lemon juice, strained (about 6<br>   large lemons)<br>  2 Tbsp. finely grated lemon zest<br>  12 Tbsp. (1? sticks) unsalted butter, cut  into ?â cubes<br>  Sweetened whipped cream for piping<br>   <br>  Fold the dough round in half and carefully transfer to a 9 1/2-inch tart pan, preferably with a removable bottom. Unfold and ease the round into the pan, without stretching it, and pat it firmly into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Trim off any excess dough by gently running a rolling pin across the top of the pan. Press the dough into the sides to extend it slightly above the rim to offset any shrinkage during baking. Refrigerate or freeze the tart shell until firm, about 30 minutes. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 375Â°F. <br>  <br>  Line the pastry shell with aluminum foil or parchment paper and fill with pie weights or raw short-grain rice. Bake for 20 minutes, then lift an edge of the foil. If the dough looks wet, continue to bake, checking every 5 minutes, until the dough is pale gold, for a total baking time of 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the weights and foil. Continue to bake until the shell is golden, 7 to 10 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. <br>  <br>  In a nonaluminum saucepan over medium heat, combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and butter. Cook slowly, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula, until the butter melts and the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of the spatula and leaves a clear trail when a finger is drawn through it, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain through a coarse-mesh sieve placed over a bowl. <br>  <br>  Spread the curd evenly in the fully baked tart shell and refrigerate until chilled, 2 to 3 hours. Using a pastry bag fitted with a small star tip, pipe whipped cream around the edge of the tart. If using a tart pan with a removable bottom, let the sides fall away, then slide the tart onto a serving plate. Let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving, to take the chill off. Makes one 9 1/2-inch tart; serves 8.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basic Tart Dough <br>  1 egg yolk<br>  2 Tbs. very cold water<br>  1 tsp. vanilla extract <br>  1? cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br>  1/3 cup sugar<br>  ? tsp. salt<br>  8 Tbsp. (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into ?â cubes<br>  <br>  In a small bowl, stir together the egg yolk, water and vanilla; set aside. <br>  <br>  To make the dough by hand, in a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar and salt. Using a pastry cutter or 2 knives, cut the butter into the flour mixture until the texture resembles coarse cornmeal, with butter pieces no larger than small peas. Add the egg mixture and mix with a fork just until the dough pulls together. <br>  <br>  To make the dough in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, stir together the flour, sugar and salt in the mixer bowl. Add the butter and beat on medium-low speed until the texture resembles coarse cornmeal, with butter pieces no larger than small peas. Add the egg mixture and beat just until the dough pulls together. <br>  <br>  Transfer the dough to a work surface, pat into a ball and flatten into a disk. Use the dough immediately, or wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, about 30 minutes. <br>  <br>  To roll out the dough, on a lightly floured board, flatten the disk with 6 to 8 gentle taps of the rolling pin. Lift the dough and give it a quarter turn. Lightly dust the top of the dough or the rolling pin with flour as needed, then roll out until the dough is about 1?8 inch thick. Use a small, sharp knife to cut out a round or rounds 2 inches greater in diameter than your tart or larger tartlet pans. Use a small, sharp knife or a cookie cutter to cut out rounds 1?2 to 1 inch greater in diameter than your miniature tartlet pans. If using a rectangular tart pan, cut out a rectangle 2 inches larger on all sides than the pan. Makes enough dough for one 9 1?2-inch tart,|`|d1805dca25d00374cb2c98883d99b807aa	Easy Tiramisu Recipe <br>    Italian Dessert <br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  2 cups whipping or heavy cream<br>  1/2 cup sugar<br>  4 tablespoons sugar<br>  1 cup strong coffee or espresso<br>  3 tablespoons of creme de cocoa, cognac, or brandy (can substitute strong coffee or espresso)<br>  8 ounces of marscapone cheese<br>  1/8 cup of cocoa powder<br>  20 lady fingers or sponge cake<br>  serving dish <br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  1.

Chicken stock, beef stock, vegetable stock, seafood stock - depending on the dish that you are pairing the couscous with.<br>  Adding butter when fluffing the couscous also helps to smooth and meld the tastes together.<br>  <br>  One of my favourite ways of cooking couscous is to cook it the way I cook fried rice, and add it as a side with a meat dish.<br>  <br>  Here's a never fail recipe which imparts a delicious taste to couscous without destroying its texture.<br>  Feel free to substitute<br>  <br>  Mixed Pepper Couscous<br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  3 tbsp olive oil<br>  1 medium onion, finely diced<br>  1/2 red bell pepper, finely diced<br>  1/2 green bell pepper, finely diced<br>  2 cloves garlic, smash, roughly chopped<br>  2 tbsp of tomato puree (or 3 tbsp of any tomato based pasta sauce)<br>  1 tsp of lemon juice<br>  Pinch of rosemary<br>  Salt & Pepper to taste<br>  Coriander leaves, roughly chopped (Garnish)<br>  <br>  Cook the couscous (not sure if you're using instant or not) your normal way, but using chicken stock instead of water. Add a small knob of butter and fluff couscous. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and set aside.<br>  <br>  In a skillet, add olive oil.<br>  Add onions. Fry until translucent.<br>  Add garlic. Continue frying until either golden brown or slightly browned (Golden brown imparts a stronger taste to couscous. Slightly browned imparts a more subtle taste)<br>  Add bell peppers. Stir fry for 5 min, add pinch of rosemary.<br>  Stir fry until peppers are slightly charred.<br>  Add tomato puree/pasta sauce.<br>  Cook for a further 3 - 5 min, stir occasionally to prevent burns.<br>  Add lemon juice.<br>  Add salt & pepper<br>  Add into mixing bowl with couscous. Mix gently with fork to combine.<br>  Garnish with coriander leaves. <br>  <br>  Goes great with grilled chicken, grilled chicken kebabs and other meat dishes.<br>  Also works great as a standalone vegetarian dish with a few other sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jenova.|`|AA11786341	In Algeria steamed couscous is usually served plain as the basic starch component of a meal just as plain rice is served in East Asia. The sauce for couscous comes from the accompanying soup, stew or braised dish. There is no need to serve a flavored couscous in this context.<br>  <br>  Algerian flavored couscous<br>  <br>  Couscous with steamed and buttered vegetables or legumes such as carrots, peas, fava beans, scallion tips, etc... is eaten with lben or a light broth. A gently sweetened couscous with dried fruits and a light dusting of sugar can be served with lben for a light meal. Or a sweeter couscous can be served as a dessert like rice pudding, not something to serve with a savory tagine or even a sweet tagine.|`|Ql6qFk85aa	I love it with a little Mrs. Dash, dried dill and red pepper flakes.

F3LBgfvwaa	There are a number of things you could do:<br>  <br>  Bring a side dish with you when you go to their house. It's a very nice gesture in any case.<br>  <br>  Eat a bit before you go, so you won't be hungry if they don't feed you.<br>  <br>  Say you're not that hungry, and then eat later when you're alone. Almost everybody has the mats for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, so make one of those for a snack.<br>  <br>  I you don't want to risk being confronted about your vegetarianism, tell them you're allergic to what they are serving, or that you are on a diet, or that there is a religious reason why you are not eating meat.<br>  <br>  Or be honest with them. Say you warned your friend. It's really not your fault. Most people are nice about it.<br>  <br>  REMEMBER: be polite! That means no dirty looks because of what they are eating. No graphic slaughterhouse stories (save them for after dinner if you need to talk about them). Be mature. But you already know this! :)<br>  <br>  I don't think you should have to compromise and eat meat for them. Would you invite a Jewish person over or a Hindu and expect them to eat beef for you? I think you would respect their preference, and you'll find that most people will respect yours.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	Just say your not all that hungry and eat the side dishes but if you are going to go over for dinner again ask your boyfriend to tell her ahead of time.|`|AA12334360	Don't eat it. I'm sure your morals are strong enough to stand a little discussion on the topic.<br>  <br>  If you know he hasn't told her, remind him<br>  <br>  Tell him you are taking starters or something.<br>  <br>  Find an excuse to pop around a few days before and let her know ( subtly, not via a "meat is murder" Tee-Shirt !! )|`|qzPZf2XPaa	I would let my boyfriend let his mother know that I will be bringing a dish to dinner for ALL OF US since she is vegetarian.<br>  Don't be dramatic if people eat meat in front of you, just bring a vegetarian lasagna, a salad, something everyone can enjoy.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	bring something really good that will impress them. if they offer meat just say no thanks. if they ask why say you will tell them after dinner.|`|r1EfYjy7aa	ima guy....the girlfriend shouldve<br>  known and told his mom <br>  to make something else  :)|`|96djwZCgaa	1.  Best situation:  Make sure the boyfriend tells his mom you're a vegetarian before you're even invited.  Tell her to please don't make anything special on your account.  Bring a vegetarian dish that's enough for everyone to share.  It never hurts to impress your boyfriend's mom with your cooking, or your willingness to cook.  <br>  <br>  2.  Second best:  At least let her know you're a vegetarian before the chicken ends up on your plate - that's just wasteful.<br>  <br>  3.  Last resort:  Eat the sides and tell her how good everything is. She's not your mom; you're company; she can't mention it if you don't clean your plate (to you, anyway; your boyfriend will probably never hear the end of it after you leave).|`|qx4F2SJmaa	You should tell him to tell his mother about your lifestyle.  If she has a heads up then I am sure she would make something that you could eat. The respect should work both ways, it is rude for anyone to just assume anything about anyone.  Don't worry.  You could also tell her that you are sure that she has gone to a lot of trouble but your body is only used to a vegetarian diet, and to eat any meat could cause some problems.  I would respect your choice to not eat meat, just as I would expect you to in turn respect my choice to eat meat. <br>  <br>  To each his own.|`|ba84bd66d652a24d2f6720ae2c9b036aaa	If you are a vegetarian, then the most polite thing to do is warn his mom beforehand.  (Your boyfriend should probably tell his mom even before inviting you!).  It's rude not to tell her beforehand, and it goes against what you believe in if you eat it.  <br>  <br>  If you're already in the situation, make up an excuse as to why you can't eat the meat!  (i.e. You had a bad experience with the same kind of meat a few days ago, and you're staying away from it at the moment.)  Eat the other stuff at the table!|`|7xkwE3X9aa	Don't ever try to conform to eating meat just because the person might not know you're vegetarian. I would never want to do that, even though I can understand the pressure to make a good impression.<br>  Just kindly say, could I get an extra serving of (vegetables, or whatever side dish), instead of the meat, I don't eat meat.|`|233bbb5ff35324aa581bb39605c0d28daa	i would be honest and just tell her that you don't eat meat. i understand about wanting to make a good first impression and all, but you certainly shouldn't have to eat something you're against eating to do it.|`|H8KQh4Jkaa	If you want to stick to your values...tell your boyfriend ahead of time to warn his mom that your a vegetarian=) The best way to have a relationship is to start it off with the truth:) Otherwise eat it...You don't want to be rude :)|`|0dyPX0Xpaa	OMG your own boyfriend doesn't know your a vegetarian yet!<br>  If your not THAT CLOSE YET, you shouldn't ever be willing to eat meat for him!<br>  SILLY!<br>  *if he knew, he would've told his mother...*<br>  :P|`|MzXkWx0Iaa	i let them know well in advance i am vegan|`|WGZz4SQ2aa	tell your boyfriend to mention it to his mom before the dinner.<br>  that way it's not awkwardddd.<br>  <br>  (:

bmoCpcdraa	coke,The list<br>  1. Remove grease stains from clothing and fabric (I had to start there)<br>  2. Remove rust; methods include using fabric dipped in Coke, a sponge or even aluminum foil.<br>  3. Remove blood stains from clothing and fabric.<br>  4. Make gooey Coke funnel cakes .<br>  5. Clean oil stains from a garage floor; let the stain soak, hose off.<br>  6. Loosen a rusty bolt; pour on some Coke and wait for the magic to happen.<br>  7. Kill slugs and snails; a small bowl of Coke will attract them, the acid will kill them.<br>  8. Help a lawn become lush and green (see my lawn tonic article here )<br>  9. Prevent an asthma attack! Apparently, the caffeine in two 12oz cans can prevent the onset of an attack.<br>  10. Defrost a frozen windshield. Apply liberally and wait (Iâll see if this works in winter)<br>  11.

Clean car battery terminals by pouring a small amount of Coke over each one.<br>  15. Cure nausea; let a can of Coke go flat then take a teaspoon of Coke every hour.<br>  16. Also, flat coke can help relieve an upset stomach (aka âthe runsâ)<br>  17. Make a Mentos & Coke exploding fountain. This one takes a 2-liter bottle of Coke.<br>  <br>  18. Get rid of hiccups; gargle with a big mouthful of ice-cold Coke.<br>  19. Shake up a can and pour it over your windshield to remove bugs and other crud.<br>  20.

Baste a ham roast with Coke as it cooks. The sugars will caramelize; the ham will be moist.<br>  25. Add a can of coke to your pot roast to tenderize it and add extra flavor.

Clean tile grout; pour onto kitchen floor, leave for a few minutes, wipe up.<br>  30. Mix a can of Coke with a packet of Italian seasoning; cook a tough steak in it.<br>  31. Make better compost; Coke increases the acidity, adds sugars and feeds microorganisms.<br>  32. Dissolve a tooth in it; Use a sealed container, this takes ages. Why would you want to though, unless youâre Hannibal Lecter?<br>  33. Remove gum from hair; dip into a small bowl of Coke, leave a few minutes. Gum will wipe off.<br>  34. Get silky skin; mix a spoonful of Coke with regular lotion and apply liberally.<br>  35. Make low-fat brownies .<br>  36. Pour a little in a cup and set it out an hour before a picnic, away from your site; it will attract wasps and bees so theyâre not bugging you and your grub.<br>  37. Remove stains from vitreous china. More info on vitreous materials here .<br>  38. Got a dirty pool? Add two 2-liter bottles of Coke to clear up the water (it acts as rust remover).<br>  39. Add Coke to your laundry to remove bad smells, especially fish.<br>  40. Remove (or fade) dye from hair by pouring diet Coke over it.<br>  41. Mop a floor with Coke to make it sticky.

Clean a toilet; pour around bowl, leave for a while, flush clean.<br>  44. Apply to skin for a deep tan (although this seems like a recipe for skin cancer to me).<br>  45. Supposedly, drinking an 8oz can of Coke every day can prevent kidney stones.<br>  46. Add it to a Sloppy Joe mix<br>  47. Perk up your Azaleas or Gardenias.<br>  48. Coke and aluminum foil will bring Chrome to a high shine.<br>  49. Strip paint off metal furniture; soak a towel in Coke, sit it on the surface for days.
