DnkXt9Xlaa	Il cerume è una sostanza secreta da ghiandole presenti nel canale uditivo esterno per proteggerlo dall'accumularsi di particelle estranee. La produzione di cerume è diversa a seconda degli individui. L'esposizione ad ambienti con molta polvere dispersa nell'aria può far aumentare notevolmente la produzione di cerume. <br>  La pulizia quotidiana della parte più esterna del condotto uditivo con un fazzoletto è sufficiente, in generale, per una corretta igiene. <br>  Si consiglia di utilizzare gli appositi tappi per orecchie nel caso si lavori in ambienti sporchi. Una scorretta igiene e/o un cattivo uso di bastoncini ovattati determinano la formazione di tappi di cerume che ostruiscono il canale uditivo esterno.|`|bf5e37af96df8c19484ace17602e9244aa	il cerume viene prodotto da ghiandole che si trovano nel canale uditivo e serve a proteggere l'interno dell'orekkio dai batteri e cose vari ke possono entrarci|`|21f33223ccb02e6da96287ceec03d732aa	ah sp33 ma nn hai altro da fare stamattina?eheh ciao juventinoooooooooooooooooo|`|ANF0umxgaa	leggendo queste risposte , ho l'impressione che a  molti faccia schifo pulirsi le orecchie !!!<br>  che ne pensi ?|`|d4NRXP4Iaa	ma ke schifoooooooooooooo|`|d87b5299c4e7d8248e760cf2a34c9112aa	il cerume è una secrezione fisiologica delle orecchie, che può eccedere se l'orecchio è infiammato, non bisogna asportarlo tutto perchè la sua funzione è di proteggere il timpano e gli altri componenti dell'orecchio!|`|3q1qrBqJaa	tra tutte le cose da chiedersi proprio questa... cmnq x fortuna nn lo so...|`|6p4Q2HpLaa	anke io me lo kiedo ttt i giorni <br>  :DDDD|`|UcT0NSzuaa	ignorando il fatto k mi sto vomitando...t devo domandare 1 cosa...ma da dv t escono certe cose????...il cerume puo essere usato x alimentare 1 fabbrica di candele o la puoi definire 1 schifezza gialla k si forma qnd nn ti lavi le orecchie...<br>  ps:esistono i bastoncini di cotone...usali!!!|`|XepBuLZlaa	devi spalmarci dentro la marmellata di arance|`|lXOWX9c5aa	ma in che categoria siamo... aiuto

CyIB0UEdaa	Okay, things start to get crazier. At Heat 4 you go against undercover GTO's and Rhino's (the SUV's) are more likely to appear. Spike strips start to really appear so you got to listen radio. The Helicopter will come but only watch. It will only stay for like few minutes and then needs to refuel. The GTO's are worth more then heat level 3 GTO's. <br>  Heat level 5 is really insane. You go against Corvette's, Rhino's come out a lot more. Roadblocks and spike stips are everywhere and the Helicopter might ram you. Cross might get involved (happened once to me, knocked him out by accident) and if you take him out it is worth 100,000 bounty. It is really hard to escape but can be done.<br>  Heat Level 6 (the final escape) has everything come after you. You can't hide or anything. You got to wait until Mia calls you and the you jump the bridge near the stadium. You will be driving you old BMW M3 GTR<br>  Hope this helps. The game is still fun, I think better then Carbon.|`|JvjtcuNNaa	choppers come and ram you along w/ everything else on the lower levels

CyIB0UEdaa	It really depends on how you fight. The bigger characters are slower, but can take a beating. They are used for getting in the middle of the fight. DK is my favorite for this type as he can take a beating and moves fairly quick for a large type. He doesn't have any long range attacks though. For medium size characters they can fight almost anywhere. Link is okay, but I think he is a little slow. I like Samus cause of her long, medium, and short range attacks and she is fairly quick. Light characters usually fight at the side lines or from a distance. I personally like Fox for this one. He is extremely fast and has many ranged and powerful attacks. He cannot take a beating so you got to watch him. Kirby is also good as he can jump for a distance, but he is even lighter then Fox. Hope this helps.|`|1x0VvOG7aa	There is a tier list on who is the best, (how well you have to play to master the character and so on) here is the list: (top tier best, bottom tier worst)  <a href="http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/genmessage.php?board=516492&topic=22412185" rel="nofollow">http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/genmess...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  (To view it, press Ctrl and F at the same time, and type in TIERS)|`|GnKnfp4aaa	I say that Mewtwo or any swordsmaster like link, young link, marth, or roy is.|`|lXOovsIzaa	I have to go with Fox or Captain Falco, simply because of their speed. They're super easy to maneuver with and their "Last Chance" moves get major air. I pick Fox every time I play and I barely ever fall, which usually helps me win ^^;.<br>  <br>  Plus, their B-button move with the gun can do some quick and heavy damage.

They're cheaper and personally I like the games more.. I know people disagree, but this is my opinion.

FARkaNTsaa	I would have expected Spiderman a while ago but it may happen if another movie comes out.<br>  <br>  Among the series LEGO has sets of, going on right now, is Spongebob Squarepants. I think it is a good pick for a game. LEGO could also make a castle/knights game. There are a few themes going on right now that are possible.<br>  <br>  Its also possible that  some other movie or TV show will come out, LEGO will make sets of it, and they will make a game out of it.
FARkaNTsaa	No one else so far...<br>  <br>  I don't have experience with the series personally, but from what I hear it is a good buy. Some exclusives plus the sets and the magazines.<br>  <br>  I would say go for it. See how it works out.

lhek8CMRaa	Silkroad Online <a href="http://sro.mmosite.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sro.mmosite.com/</a> <br>  Silkroad Online puts the player deep into ancient Chinese and European civilizations along the historic Silk Road trade route. It is free to play, and offers the unique chance for players to develop their characters free of restrictions or fixed paths. This game is known for its stunning graphics, the variety in game play, the unique playable races (Currently Chinese and Europeans) and of course the Triangular Conflict. The Triangular Conflict is the trading system that players can partake in anytime they are in the game and it uses three jobs to complete the Triangle; Merchant, Hunter, and Thief. Each job goes for glory to finish the trade and keep their goods. Legend I, Europe expansion was introduced on July 24, 2007 and it added a new race, Europe. This Legend introduced an assortment of maps, characters, clothing, items, pets, skills and a new party-play system to incorporate more player cooperation to name a few of the key features from this expansion. <br>  <br>  Perfect World <a href="http://pw.mmosite.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pw.mmosite.com/</a><br>  Known as Chinese WOW, Perfect World is a full-feature 3D online game that is based on rich Chinese mythology and set in the world of Pangu. Malaysian version is completely english and no IP block.<br>  <br>  2moons <a href="http://2moons.mmosite.com/" rel="nofollow">http://2moons.mmosite.com/</a><br>  A very decent 3D mmorpg. Graphic is very nice. The community is totally amazing and you can barely see anyone using the word "noob". The PvP system is awesome and the good thing about it is you don't have to be a high level to be good at it or even give it a try. The upgrading system is probably the fairest you can find in any game.<br>  <br>  I suggest you to go 2moons. That's my choice.

They are pretty cheap to make, most of the cards needed are commons.<br>  <br>  Another great deck that is very cheap and easy to make is the Macro Deck. It is basically the anti of many of the top decks. It counters, Zombies and Lightsworns completely. All you need to get started is buy 2 Dark Emperor starter decks.|`|73LapXVyaa	Well, what i do is ignore the decks made by other people, and i get many cards, make a deck i think is good, and experiment and take out an add cards that i think would work well and make many strategies that take advantage. of every moment in the game.|`|5dyEb5RGaa	create your own deck seach out diffrent lists and find the one that suits you but be careful cuz sometimes there arer four or five of a sard set and then there no more so make sure you have enough cards to start of a deck properly
AA10478980	We don't understand exactly what you are asking.  Your question may have been posted in Board Games by mistake.  But most likely the music you are looking for is on there. Ask how to find it possibly in the Entertainment and Music category or in one of the internet or computer categories.  
W5JwMrn8aa	This question is not clearly stated. If you could give more detail it would be easier to answer. However, you have stated that your haveing problems updateing it. I suggest you 1) check on the website to see if updates are available 2)wait until tomarrow and see if time fixes the problem or 3) you accidently disconnected from the internet. GL

Xjd8ACdbaa	You cannot modify the umd itself...just like you cannot not modify a movie on a dvd or music on a cd....There is an alternative...you could rip your game...<br>  Ripping is converting the game into a file using softwares like umdgen 4.0...<br>  While ripping, you can remove stuff you don't want: like the languages you don't use or the music, the cinematic scenes ...etc. <br>  Once the game is ripped , it can only be played with a custom firmware via the memory card though....<br>  You cannot delete from the umd.....but you can delete what is on the umd.<br>  Hope I am clear enough.|`|LzSj90pbaa	you can do it. get a dremel and a sanding bit|`|zHX9PRQ7aa	Yea, you can't delete files off of a UMD or right files onto a UMD.

RKIt9zSIaa	This is a known issue with some of the later EPs - try looking at the technical help section of the main site.  I'm pretty sure there's some advice there.  <br>  <br>  The problem arises from the fact that you installed Pets which changes your saved game files and then uninstalled it (even if you didn't actually do this yourself).  Those game files will now not work without Pets installed.  The quckest solutions to the problem would be:<br>  <br>  1. Reinstall Pets and hope it works this time<br>  2. Use the backup you made before installing Pets to put back the old version of the game files (you made the back up like you were told to, didn't you?)

26khrXAFaa	Hi. I love the Sims 2 Pets :D<br>  <br>  1.) No, your sims cannot get pregnant but, the animals CAN. :) You have the mate them. Buy your dogs or cats. Buy a doghouse. (It's found in the Object Catalog in the pets section.)  Build your relationship with your dog & when you go near it you will see an option in the menu saying select "Try offspring with...(the name of your other dog)" at the bottom. Make sure you keep a close eye on your dogs after this...you'll be surprised what will happen :]<br>  <br>  2.) Hmm...I'm still trying to figure this out. What I did was put all my stuff that I could fit in my inventory and moved out of the home. Then, I went to the neighborhood screen & moved them back into the same home & then there will be a edit family selection on the neighborhood screen. There you add family members...<br>  <br>  3.) Nope, lol. <br>  <br>  4.) Well, you can upgrade your fridge. The more expensive the fridge is, the more items you can get. And buy those Frod Trees. They have fruits that you can harvest and put in your fridge. And the aqauriams have fish that you can also harvest and put in your fridge. Having a lot of trees, and aqauriums will get you more food in your fridge. (Note: If you have a blender, you can use the fruits to make smoothies that will raise your energy and sleep high.)<br>  <br>  5.) Check your mailbox every morning. Make it a daily routine. Sometimes, I forget to check it and then my bills get overdue! So, it's best you check it everyday just in case like you would in real life.   :]<br>  <br>  6.) Growing a garden....I think you have to buy one first, and make sure you water it and take care of it everyday then your plants will grow.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :D|`|p2hyOGfHaa	1.can ur sims get pregnant or just the animals?and how? you can get both your aniamls and sims pregnant, by letting the oppisite gendre get to no each other then relax in a double bed and ask your sim to join (must be invited over) then cuddle and try for baby.<br>  <br>  2.how do you add to ur family without having kids (customize new pets or sims to ur family)? or is that even posible?you do that when you create family obv. :l<br>  <br>  3.this is a pretty dum one i no but wat does it mean by stargaze? looking up at the stars duhh<br>  <br>  4. how do you add things to ur frig or does it up grade like the stores? when you got no fridge stock left you can ring for delivelry, use a computer or go out and buy stock.<br>  <br>  5.how do you no wen to check ur male box? the mail man comes and you are able to click it. Check once every two days at least.<br>  <br>  6. how do you grow a garden? depends what expansion packs you have if you dont have seasons which i dont think you have then go on build mode and then click on the tree/flower. Not sure.|`|mrelsNKOaa	1. On Sims 2 ur sim cant get pregnant so i dont think u can. <br>  2. When u are first creating ur person u just click add for another or u can get married or ask a person to move in. <br>  3. Stargaze is when the sim is looking through a telescope and it gets one of ur skills up a level <br>  4. Each fridge is different and usually u have to grow ur own vegetables. <br>  5. Every two days u usually check ur mail box or i think theres an envelope sticking out of it. <br>  <br>  =] p.s. i LOVE sims !!|`|WpRw2NTFaa	1: You can't get pregnant.<br>  2: If you alread have a game just go to edit family.<br>  3: You have to buy a telescope and look through it.<br>  4: Completing things and getting your cooking skill up adds recipes and other foods to the fridge.<br>  5: I check mine every  other day .|`|tEoZg4ORaa	1. Sims can get pregnant.  Males get pregnant by Alien abduction.  They will have an alien baby.  Females get pregnant by clicking on try for a baby option.  The try for a baby option is accessible in the photo booth, the car, the bed, and in the dressing room.  They must both be sitting/relaxing on the item you want them to try for a baby in.<br>      <br>      With pets, the two pets have to have a very high relationship with each other.  You can up their relationship by using the "boolprop controlpets on" cheat.  Then have an adult sim click on the bed or dog and tell them to try for puppy/kitten with... and click on the dog or cat's name.<br>  <br>  2.  If you have University, you can combine households.  You combine households by creating a sim/pet in Create-A-Sim mode then clicking on them as you would move them into a household.  Then click on the household you want them to move in with.<br>  <br>       If you do not have University, you can ask any adult sim to move in if you get a high enough relationship with one.  For pets, you can go to the pet store and purchase one.  Or you can adopt one though you have to use the mirror to customize it.  You can also adopt children which will add to the household.<br>  <br>  3. Stargazing without a telescope can be used to pass the time.  It can also cause your sims to die by satellite if they do it too much.<br>  <br>      Stargazing with a telescope gains logic skill points as well as causes your sim to get kidnapped by aliens if you do it too much.<br>  <br>  4. You can add things to your fridge by going on the phone and clicking call > delivery > groceries.  A bar will come up telling you how full your fridge is and asking you to fill it to the point where you want it.  You can also get groceries by going to certain community lots and buying it.<br>  <br>  5. The mailman or woman will come and there should be a little movie pop-up at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen showing him/her putting some mail in the mailbox.  It's always a good idea to check often whether or not you have any mail.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the long post.  I hope this answers your question.|`|2qhbefecaa	all i know is number one is they can and u have to have sex

y4uoDjV0aa	Ampharos would be my first suggestion, and second Luxray. But Lanturn might be useful cause it's a water and electric dual type, so there's minimal weaknesses. And yes, magnemite and it's evolutions have the power of steel to add to their defense, but magnezone is fugly.<br>  So i guess it's all up to you then... :)) hope that helped|`|GsNonb3Zaa	I think Magneton is a strong choice, it's defense is REALLY high.|`|rVQwxzZ2aa	Magneton may be good in defense, but its speed is not going to be good since its a steel type, so any fire pokemon like Charizard comes to battle you, it can wipe it out easily. So you have to get a good electric pokemon and then EV train it in defense..|`|TLohR62Aaa	pachrisu, electrike or i also reccomend luxio shink or luxray

iyU1Ivtnaa	Think of linking as a way of gluing together prims with the ability to selectively unglue all or part of the result. To start linking, you need to be in Edit mode. There are several ways of getting into this state. The easiest is to press Ctrl-3, though I find that hard to remember. If you like buttons, click the Build button on the bottom of the SL screen, and then click the Edit button near the top of the dialog box that opens. A third method is to right-click or Cmd-click an object, and then choose Edit from the pie-shaped menu that opens.<br>  <br>  If the prims you want to link are close together, then press and hold down the (left) mouse button and drag out a rectangle around the prims. You will see the different prims light up with white outlines as they get selected and then all will have yellow outlines when you release the mouse button. Press Ctrl-L to link. Alternatively, choose Tools > Link from the top menu bar.<br>  <br>  Once linked, the prims will be outlined in blue except for one special one, the root prim. I’ll describe some properties of this in a bit, but note for now that it is the very first prim that got selected in the click-drag method.<br>  <br>  Another way to link is to hold down the Shift key and then just click the prims you want to include. If you accidentally include something unintended, just Shick click it again and it will deselect. When you are done, press Ctrl-L to link. With this technique, it’s the last prim you selected that becomes the root prim. These linked-together prims now form a multi-prim object.<br>  <br>  An object is one or more prims linked together. The center of an object is the center of the root prim. When you look at the Object tab in the Edit dialog box for one of these linked objects, the information displayed is for the linked prim. In particular, an object rotates around the center of the root prim. You really need to remember this.<br>  <br>  To unlink an object, select it while in Edit mode and press Ctrl-Shift-L or use Tools > Unlink from the menu bar. All component prims will still be highlighted. To immediately relink, press Ctrl-L. To remove a prim from a linked object, select the whole object, press Ctrl-Shift-L, then hold down Shift and click the prim you wish to exclude. Now press Ctrl-L to relink everything else.<br>  <br>  Linked objects can be no more than 30 meters in any dimension and you can’t link more than 255 prims together. You may just have to live with multiple linked objects in a big project. You’ll get an error message if you try to link things that are too far apart.<br>  <br>  You can link two objects together or add a prim to a linked object using the linking techniques above. Suppose you had one object that was two prims linked together and another that had seven prims linked together. If you linked them, you would have one object with nine component prims. If you then unlinked this, you would not get your two objects back. Rather you would get the nine separate prims.

5da93cb703d7e0ccc2f87ca72b081c98aa	Before installing the epansion packs, it recommends backing them up. Each expansion takes up a lot of space and it says that they CAN get erased. You probably don't have enough space on the cpmputer. It's never happened to me, but it says that on the first page of the expansion pack booklets. If you make more space and reload it the game may work better.

DP3WRLIaaa	I got one: The Archaeologists tracks down the last remaining descendant from the Kateeta tribe , Asmungi(u decide wether that's a male or a female's name!!). Asmungi doesn't even know that he descended from the Kateeta tribe because 100 years ago, anyone from the Kateeta tribe were slaughtered. But Asmungi's great-grandparents went into hiding and kept their secret hidden even from their own children. Asmungi and the Archaeologists goes around the world tracing the steps of his parents, granparents, and so on... to find a stop to the curse. As they go, they recruit more people and he finds out he's not the only descendant and also finds out his and his family's past.(u continue from here)<br>  <br>  Asmungi: for some reason instinctively knew how to read Kateetaic writing and understand Kateetaic language. A Tidus-like character: confident (sometimes cocky), understanding, loving and the youngest in the group.<br>  <br>  Archaeologist 1: Prof Hatta: male, strict, strong, fast, pretty much the "big guy" of the group and has a pastime secret which he reveals as game progresses <br>  <br>   Archaeologist 2: Bakaroque: male, the leader, the "sve-the-planet guy" of the group as he fish/hunt only for the the male of a fish/animal, he makes shelter with as little trees and leaves and he.....<br>  <br>  You customize the rest but i would suggest putiing in a beautiful girl/handsome guy (depending on Asmungi's gender) that Asmungi is in love with that they later recruit in the game.|`|cvBkyVRyaa	Do a cartoon spoof on the elections.

FARkaNTsaa	If it bothers you that much then go for it. The Droid Gunship still has the "new" tags so you know that shouldn't be going anywhere soon.
FARkaNTsaa	Well, you'll be saving up 3 times what the Droid Gunship costs, so depending on how you get the money, you may be saving for a bit.<br>  <br>  Remember patience is a great thing. The wait can make your goal even better when you get it. So I would say go for the AT-TE. If you can, why not get both? Have your Gunship now and save a little bit longer for the AT-TE.<br>  <br>  It depends on you.

ynHkimZDaa	GTA IV is a amazing game, with a good story line and game play. However, it has strong language (VERY STRONG) and violence and blood. It also include drug use and sexual themes. But if your parents lets you play games like these then you should definitely get it.|`|Hiasgb75aa	lol, NO!!!<br>  <br>  Call of Duty 4 and Halo 3 are FAR superior to GTA IV. GTA IV is not better than GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City or GTA 3. I say you just get Rockband. I'm not into those games but they are a high quality, and will provide more fun moments than GTA. GTA IV all you do is shoot people, chase people and get drugs. Absolutely nothing new, other than cars that are harder to steer, money that you can't really use to buy anything, and aeroplanes that you can't fly. There are only a small amount of weapon selection. And a story with characters I find hard to like. And I am a big GTA fan|`|s6hhRtQuaa	GTA IV is god while your playing it, but once you have finished the game 100% it's really boring.<br>  I recommend GH:WT (Out in 29 Days) if it's not too expensive(￡149.99), if not then Saints Row 2 (Out in 8 Days), Call of Duty 5: World at War (Out in 36 Days) or Fable II (Out in 15 Days)|`|ca5t8aQpaa	1st GTA IV is overrated- San Andreas was more fun, the great thing about GTA IV is the graphics and thats about it <br>  2nd-Halo 3 and CoD4 are much tamer M games than GTA IV those 2 games are only M because of the blood while GTA has language blood, drug and alcohol use, strong sexual content, intense violence- basically everything a game could be rated M for.  I personally did not play a GTA game until I was 18 because my parents would not allow me to play it until then lol.  <br>  <br>  And all those games are good IMO|`|CFIocLzNaa	really good game for single player<br>  but for online play, halo 3 is the best if ur good at it<br>  then cod 4 is kind of fun<br>  rock band 2 is the same as the first with more songs<br>  guitar hero 3 is only guitar so...no its rly annoying they put 5 notes everywhere on expert so nobody rly beats the game its gay<br>  guitar hero 4 will be better than rock band 1 and 2 so yea<br>  saints row and rainbow six are HORRIBLE<br>  i recommend unreal tournament 3 for the most fun and burnout paradise if u can race<br>  Buy: Unreal tournament 3, burnout paradise, halo 3|`|AA10466415	GTA IV is a good game. But with Saints Row 2 comming out. That is is suppose to be like GTA IV but MUCH better. But Game wise I dont think its any worst then CoD 4 or anything. You kill people in both. Just GTA and Saints Row you can kill Civillians to. And in Saints Row, you get to Customize Cars, your house, your gang and more cool stuff you cant do in GTA.|`|2oTkLmKzaa	GTA 4 is really good. Basically, if you liked the other GTA games, part 3 through San Andreas, then you'll like this. Better graphics, more mission varieties, incredibly detailed city, ect. ect.<br>  <br>  As for whether or not it's appropriate for a 15 year old would be more of a decision that your parents would have to make. If it was my 15 year old asking for this game I'd decide if it was appropriate based on how mature you are.|`|nczVrYjFaa	GTA4 is a damn good game.  However, it is definitely a tad more mature than Halo 3 and CoD4.

PvR1CVGhaa	Milotic is an incredible sp. wall, already having high sp. defense making it resistant to most electrical attacks. Hypnosis or Mirror Coat would make it even deadlier.

b3215f7cdde2242433302d1e58947ebeaa	If you're talking about longevity of the console itself, then I would have to say Playstation 3 blows xbox360 out of the water. Apparently however, the new xbox360s that have been produced since the elite have a different motherboard or something which prevents the overheating problem, but my roommate has a first generation playstation 3 and currently we only use that console and never once had a problem with malfunctions. Also free online play is awesome for countless hours on CoD4 and NBA 2k9 ^^.<br>  <br>  On another note, xbox360 has a much better game library and exclusives in my opinion and definitely so far does not seem to lack any processing power compared to the playstation 3. I returned CoD4 for xbox360 for the PS3 version for the free online gameplay and honestly it doesn't look much different. Xbox360 might be around longer in terms of the games but as a standalone console, PS3 is a much worthwhile investment. Just my opinion. |`|xzJdCpcoaa	ps3 last long xbox360 last 2months|`|oTWnXvFxaa	Deffinetly PS3 lasts longer, sorry to say.  I think if you play 360 for too long, it breaks and you see that red light when you turn it on.  It's a great system (i have a PS3 so don't think of me as a fanboy) but from what I hear it can break easily.  It's not really a big deal though.  You ship it to microsoft and get it fixed.|`|qr95qZ0caa	The new in box 360s are of better quality than older ones.  Take in to consideration the games and online community too.  There are far more games for 360 and more in development.  There are also some licenses that jumped the Sony ship and went with the 360 instead.  Also the xbox live community is superb with what it offers.  They have been doing it for many years and 2 systems and it shows with the level of content and quality.  Sony's online community hasn't been around that long and is far from trouble free.<br>  Xbox 360 comes with a 3 year warrantee, PS3 is much shorter than that.<br>  |`|mim3C59Yaa	The 360 defiantly is the least living system. It tends to have the "Rings of Death" awfully a lot and it isn't dependable. The PS3 it much more reliable and it has more memory. The PS3 also has better graphics.|`|yifqm8Jfaa	The sony playstation as a console will always beat out an xbox product. How many times have you heard of an xbox overheating? How many times have you heard of a ps3 overheating? There you go.|`|UVE7sZv4aa	I have been researching the two for a while and i can tell you: go for the 360! It is much better and will last a long time, if u have problems just use warranty or get it repaired (not too expensive). Also the 360 has hundreds of more game titles and will have pretty much every good game like far cry2, cod5 and much much more.<br>  <br>  P.S. Halo 3!!!|`|sdxVmMsDaa	graphics are pretty much the same... but beleve it or not ps3 is latest and thats why it has much more cool features othere than gaming...... btw ps3 was built to last longer... btw ps3 has a failure rate of 0.2% and thts not a lie.|`|bhkKvvh6aa	ive heard of a lot of problems with people's 360 dying so i would think the ps3

Dso7k3sjaa	I used to get the BSOD all the time once I first installed Seasons.  Even though I was still able to see the fish in the fish tanks and ponds and I did actually have the x-ray cursor so I could see the newspaper under the snow.<br>  <br>  Back then, Maxis was working with Nvidia trying to figure out why so many people using Nvidia video cards were getting this blue screen of death.  Eventually, Nvidia made new drivers which seemed to be working and Maxis told everyone who was experiencing this problem to update their video drivers.  I did and I never had that problem again.  Apparently though, once Bon Voyage was released, it came back.  Now, I never installed BV, so I still wasn't having any problems with my game doing that, but Maxis and Nvidia went back to the drawing board trying to figure this problem out.<br>  <br>  Eventually they discovered that people who have Norton antivirus were having a memory leakage problem and if those people first turned Norton off before playing that they wouldn't get the BSOD.  Now, I just wanted to let you know that back when I was having the problem, I was actually using Norton Antivirus, but at that time simply updating my video drivers stopped the problem.  I still played with Norton turned on in the background and didn't have any more problems anyway.<br>  <br>  So, I would recommend that you try updating your video drivers first.  Then, if that still doesn't help, try turning whatever antivirus you have on your computer off before playing.  Unless you play in windowed mode and also use the internet at the same time.  If you do that, then I wouldn't turn your antivirus off, I would try disabling any/all other background tasks you can BESIDES your antivirus and see if that might help.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to the post on EA's Sims 2 bbs talking about the Blue Screen of Death problem:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bbs.thesims2.ea.com/community/bbs/messages.php?threadID=0a0be03fff0b6ef23f8d23d6c96f6bbe&directoryID=189&startRow=1&openItemID=item.189,root.1,item.43,item.104,item.41,item.127,item.23" rel="nofollow">http://bbs.thesims2.ea.com/community/bbs...</a><br>  <br>  And here's a listing of the things you can turn off without hurting your computer:<br>  <br>  <a href="https://easims.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/easims.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=8705&p_created=1107390902&p_sid=yN-Jt3sj&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MjAsMjAmcF9wcm9kcz03LDcwMCZwX2NhdHM9MCZwX3B2PTIuNzAwJnBfY3Y9JnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9YmFja2dyb3VuZA**&p_li=&p_topview=1" rel="nofollow">https://easims.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/easi...</a>|`|AA11850311	I have 2GB of custom content, probably 20-30 game mods or hacks.  I've been playing for about a year and only had it crash twice while I was playing.  The game crashing and going to a BSOD is more likely due to your system specs being inadequate rather than any custom content.  Bad custom content will cause an error on load that says "this application has crashed, the application will now terminate"|`|2yJU8wqCaa	haha yes,<br>  Mainly because I have<br>  everyone of their expansions and SP<br>  to date, OH and I got 2 gigabytes worth of<br>  downloads haha.|`|669bRlkuaa	Yes I get the blue screen of death when I play other games like assassins creed or call of duty.  Does it say something about "nv4_disp?  I think that has something to do with the video card.|`|ysiE6IDjaa	I agree with Melethana. The only time I have ever experienced BSOD was when I had bad ram. It is unlikely to be your game.<br>  <br>  Are you absolutely sure you mean the Windows Blue Screen of Death and you don't just mean the game going to a blue screen before it closes? Because that is a completely different problem.

That's about as good as you're going to get.|`|EbazBkpgaa	Square has only announced the Japanese release which is MAY 30 so about 3 to 6 months after will the game be released|`|7W5JCf4Naa	All the dates that are out so far are just rumors. There is currently no official release date.<br>  <br>  If I recall, Kingdom Hearts II was released in the US just a few months after it was released in Japan.

Change earthquake to fly or aerial ace because salamence is part flying and any attack that is the same type gets multiplied by 1.5 (Example: Aerial Ace normal damage: 60 but because salamence is part flying <br>  60 x 1.5= 90 damage). <br>  <br>  your alakazam is decent but give it another sp attack instead of fire punch cause alakazam has weak attack.<br>  <br>  Ursaring is solid<br>  <br>  Metagross Ok<br>  <br>  Rapidash is a mess- no point in having 3 fire moves, keep flamethrower but get rid of everheat and flare blitz, and if u want solar beam give it sunny day because sloar beam doesnt need to charge if its sunny out. Bounce is also a good move for it.<br>  <br>  walrein same as rapidash and dump sheer cold because by the time u land a hit you health will be very low. keep ice beam and surf and switch it with some other moves that could take out pokemon who would have moves super effective against it|`|a1bb8fc74ef941b0b15c95e44ca6f623aa	Well I'm not going to say you need legendaries, but since you don't use them I would have to rate your team average. <br>  <br>  Honest opionion.|`|cB6YNRpcaa	Hmm, great team, maybe i should try that|`|77ODMhQGaa	good but i can still beat u|`|Un511PNWaa	it's okay but if i had 3 more level 100's i can beat you easily<br>  <br>  so far i have a level 100 charziard, a 100 blastoise and a 100 mewtwo which is unbeatable|`|QXEtJntsaa	gr8<br>  but<br>  u should get sum actuall pkmn frm sinnoh in ur team

I'm a fan of both series of games.<br>  Both have made huge improvements this time around;<br>  <br>  In Empire, you can now garrison buildings and engage in real time naval combat whilst it used to be auto-resolved in previous titles.<br>  Your units will also take cover behind walls and other obstacles.<br>  <br>  DOW II is using the Essence Engine (if you have played Company of Heroes, You'll now how much this Engine rocks.) DOW revolves around using a minimal amount of units to achieve your goals.<br>  <br>  So if you can't choose then why not have both.|`|MUEMs2ataa	Depends on if you like multiplayer DoW.

You can even get a spiral bound blank journal.<br>  <br>  And what the person in your example is doing seems more like art journaling or creating an altered book of sorts.

No point in saying why)<br>  Graphics - PS3<br>  Shooters - Xbox 360(Much better since the xbox 360 controller is easier to control)<br>  Sports - Wii(Yes I wouldn't know which is better since all my sports games are on my Wii LOL.<br>  <br>  Either way I love my PS3 and my Xbox 360 ^^ So I cant choose!|`|pYj8KZUNaa	I am a proud owner of an Xbox 360,<br>  It is an overall good machine. it has a very good back catalogue of games including Fable 2, Halo 3 and Halo Wars, Frontlines: Fuel of War and it also has good racing games like Forza Motorsport 2 and Race Driver GRID.<br>  <br>  the Graphics are not better than the PS3 but that doesn't matter if the games your playing are really poor (Resistance 2) and games like Gears of War 2 have got really good graphics, great gameplay and a fantatsic storyline that will keep you glued until you finish the game.<br>  <br>  The 360 has a wide range of exclusive titles across a multitude of genres; Racing, shooters and Survival/Horror Etc. and most of these games have Xbox Live Multiplayer options. In the UK, Xbox live costs around ￡50 for the whole year and you will not regret it. the matchfinder will find you an opponent that is equal to your skill giving you a challenging game every time.|`|q549d4Obaa	uh its not $70 for a month dude. try $50 for a year and that package includes a headset as far as playing the 360 online goes. a three month package costs some $30 i think<br>  <br>  i hear ps3 has lots of hackers and stuff online. it kinda makes sense because its free and theres no one to regulate it but i dont know for sure. <br>  <br>  the whole wireless things isnt that bad either. not sure about exact battery life in hours but they gotta have at LEAST 12 hours fully charged. and you get a full charge overnight when youre not using it<br>  <br>  honestly gameplay cant be much different. the controller layouts are pretty much the same. two joysticks. the left and right triggers and the left and right bumpers of the 360 are basically the same as L1&2 and R1&2 of the ps3. the A, B, X, and Y, is the equivalent of the circle, square, triangle, and X of the ps3. they both have a D-pad. only difference is the 360 has a button that accesses whats called the dashboard (its like a operating platform but for a consul). <br>  <br>  given that an example, take call of duty: world at war, since both controllers have almost exactly the same layout, the only way the gameplay would be different is two factors, graphics and the actual games supported by each consul.<br>  <br>  never seen a ps3 so i couldnt give you an honest opinion on the graphics. <br>  <br>  i have a 360 never even touched a ps3<br>  <br>  another thing to consider is the HD vs blu-ray. you could get the ps3 and already be ahead on last visual technology. but then again HD is pretty up there to. <br>  <br>  the xbox is going for $299+, while the ps3 is going for $399+|`|pQunBQeoaa	if you like online multiplayer shooter games then go with a 360 because the online is way better and there will be alot of people playing even though its not free online you really do pay for a better experience when it comes to online multiplayer and sport games are basically the same on either system because the majority of good sports games are multi console and game whise xbox 360 has plenty of games that have replayablity and multiple good shooters|`|fM22ukbAaa	Well i got a ps3 and i am very satisfied with it. I mean the graphics are much better and the internet is free. Also if you like shooting games the best way to go would be the ps3. They got some pretty good shooting games out that are pretty cool.|`|zMMQVb3eaa	dude definately the ps3 i have both and never play the xbox the ps3 has better graphics better controllers and internet and stuff is free unlike xbox i think its like 70 bucks a month the xbox is more of a video game nerds system|`|2Zcm4ynHaa	It depends on your choice. <br>  In graphics, PS3 is definitely better as it has the fastest processor which is around 4.6 GHz in speed and its GPU is also top-class.<br>  <br>  In online gaming, the Xbox 360 wins. Xbox LIVE is one of the best online services, but you have to pay for it unlike the Playstation Network.<br>  <br>  In price, its the PS3 that's lesser now, even though it has an expensive Blu-Ray player.<br>  <br>  In multimedia, te PS3 again wins because of its Blu-Ray Disc drive and its PlayTV feature.<br>  <br>  The controller of Xbox 360 is easier to play with, but PS3's controller has a superior design.<br>  <br>  If you are a shooter fan, then I think you opt the Xbox 360 because it has all the best shooter games like Halo 3. Sports, first person adventure, and racing would be better on the PS3. <br>  <br>  I think you should go for the PS3, and if you do, be sure the first game you buy is "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune".|`|YMnwmrlvaa	there are us and downs for both for example for the 360 graphics are better but the controllers run on batteries, with the ps3 graphics still awesome but not as good, but controller rechargeable ,in 360 you can play games like halo where as in ps3 you cant but they are both good.<br>  <br>  although in my oppinion the 360 is better for most games (my opinion not fact), like guitar hero and rockband, saints row and any of the sega games

MEolZOtWaa	Soccer formations are all based on how you play. You need to specify that rather than the players you have.<br>  <br>  If you play defensive and go for the counter attack, I'd use something like a 4-3-2-1 or a 4-4-2.<br>  <br>  However if you attack up front a lot and cross into the box for headers and whatnot, try something like a 4-3-3 or 4-4-2 or even a 3-5-2 if you're up to it.<br>  <br>  Try a lot of different things and eventually you'll find one that suits your playing style.

Dgr5Otkwaa	To be honest, I don't know of any that are properly like that. <br>  <br>  The only one I can think of that's similar is PGR4 (the racing game). But it's not anaglyph whilst you play, it merely has a feature where you can pause the game during a race, take a 'photo' of your car, and then turn that into red/cyan 3D.<br>  <br>  PGR4 does _not_ come with the 3D glasses you need to see the result in 3D.  It's a very good game by the way.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  Dave

Now they are fairly new so they will cost around 60 dollars... COD5 isn't out yet but Fable 2 and SR2 are. <br>  THE GAMES:<br>  -Call of Duty 5<br>  -Saints Row 2<br>  -Fable 2<br>  <br>  these are some good games I would suggest.|`|LLlbvlIuaa	I would reccomend for the PS3/X360 getting saints row 2, COD:WAW(call of duty:world at war,in case you didnt know).<br>  I have completed SR2 and would give it 10/10.<br>  World at war i have a feeling would get given 10/10 aswell.<br>  <br>  As for wii depending on if you like this kind of game there is a new my sims called my sims Kingdom.<br>  <br>  I would focus more on the PS3/X360 as the games tend to be more fun and addictive.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|I5A2Dq2Kaa	COD5- 10<br>  gears of war- 8<br>  Mario kart- 9<br>  Fallout3 - 9<br>  Rock band 2- 10<br>  Guitar hero world tour- 8<br>  Ristentince 2- 0

KmPHAyzpaa	Get a playstation 3. It has new game that are coming out like, yakuza 3, twisted metal, killzone 2, God of War 3, Grand turismo 5, Quantum theory, and much more. Past titles like, resistance 2, little Big Planet, motorstorm 2, and my all-time favorite, Metal Gear Solid 4. Best of all, it has FREE online, and built in WIFI. Also, it has Blu-ray, which not only makes movies look better, it also makes games bigger ,and better.Getting a playstation 3 would be the right choice. |`|mim3C59Yaa	If you like raw power and really good graphics go towards the PS3. If you like shooters than anything else, then get the 360. If you like more adventure, cartoonish style fun, then get the motion controlled Wii. I myself would get the PS3 because of it power + graphics and also because it has some good games alaround.|`|frgyfPsAaa	Xbox 360. In the words of Nike, "Just Do It".|`|aAkjmKDXaa	with a ps3, you can do a lot more than with a 360...with a 360, the news say that the 360 has been having a lot of problems...mine doesnt work and i havent had it very long, nor used it, i got rock band and tried to play but it doesnt show up...with a wii, you can exercise and do a lot of real life things with it, with a lot of different games but i dont think you can play movies on it|`|OmRnew13aa	360
BndTpGDXaa	I dont think that is possible i have tried for the past 30 minutes. What it says is that the ds acts as a "suitcase". which means you put your animal crossing city folk character into the ds and transfer it to another wii. They do this for people who dont have wifi but want to play with each other in animal crossing city folk. 
hkuLv7Sgaa	you need a wireless internet connection. You can set it up with the settings online. If the signal is weak or doesn't recognise any wireless networks, you can use a usb internet dongle to get a stronger signal|`|mim3C59Yaa	All you need to do is to go to Best Buy or Walmart (Cheaper for more) and ask one of the employees in the electronics section where they sell the ETHERNET cables. Then when you get it(Only if you have a wired connection) and you hook one of the ends into the back of the PS3(You will see a hook in spot) and you can hook the other end directly into the modem(assuming you have Time Warner) and then you can turn of the PS3 nad make yourself a account and there you have it!

The US and Asia have a much better selection of content because of two things.  1. They are the two largest console markets.  2. Much of the content and services are created in those two regions and it makes it much easier and faster to clear licensing hurtles.  <br>  <br>     Xbox live operates much the same way, there are a million things that can be downloaded in the US, but in europe it's still bare bones, they are just now getting more content out there and that's after 3 years of development.  <br>  <br>     The best thing you can do, is complain to Sony.  It may not get anywhere, but the more people that show them they want content available, the more effort will be put forward to bring it to you.

p79koJQbaa	There are 2 tricks that you can do to be more accurate.<br>  One<br>  You can switch to your pistol and back really fast ( Y Y for Xbox, and ▲ ▲ for PS3) which brings the aimer down for your pistol and then before the aimer gets back up for the sniper you fire off a round and its much more accurate. This has to be done really fast though and takes some practice.<br>  Two<br>  You can do a quick scope which basically means you aim and shoot virtually at the same time, you don't want to look through the scope, shoot while zooming to the veiw. This also lowers the crosshair and makes your shots more accurate...if done perfectly it will go exactly where the scoped shot should go without ever actually looking through the scope.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|I8JKCKozaa	he has no life if hes that accurate,<br>  i mean after a really long time of no scoping you learn where on yor screen the shot goes, and then theres no need for the scope, but there isnt any special way to no scope people|`|bqeBvlJ5aa	This "zzir" guy (that's not his name, i can't remember what it is) is like the best at no scoping on COD 4.<br>  <br>  He's got a guide on how to do it on youtube. Just go there and search "G shot" and it will show you how to get no scopes easily and from far away.<br>  <br>  It will still take a bit of practice though.|`|atJIGcukaa	The sniper got lucky.<br>  With any gun, when you are holding it at your hip there is a reticle in the center of the screen. (The reticle is the four white lines that make a cross hair.) When you pull the trigger (say with the R700) a shot is fired randomly within the reticle. Go into a private match, stand in front of a wall and hip-fire and watch where the bullet holes form to see what I mean. <br>  No matter what anyone tells you <i>no-scoping requires zero skill and is all luck.</i> All those montages you see on youtube are handpicked from throughout dozens of matches. It is pure luck there is no such thing as a "good no-scoper."<br>  So I suppose the trick is to get as close as possible to your target so more of their body fills your reticle. <br>  Consequently, using a semi-auto sniper like the .50cal also increases your chances for the obvious reason that you get off more shots. <br>  (Also, in every case all the time, never put Stopping Power on a Dragonuv- it is always a two-shot kill anywhere but the head. 2nd perk is better used for UAV Jammer or Jug. This rule only applies to the Drag.)<br>  (Also also, there is a glitch with the ACOG'd M40 w/ Stopping Power that makes it a one shot kill to <i>any</i> part of the body. This makes it a pretty good no-scoping gun.)<br>  This information is infallible and if anyone tells you otherwise they are a troll or an imbecile.

AA12328571	From the first patch to the latest patch with the game included, it did take nearly 12 hrs but at the time i was on a slow connection so downloading the patches took forever especially the 2.4.0 one as that was 1 or 2 gb. Although with a fast connection it would still take you a few hrs, maybe 4-5 i say, all depends on computer speed, internet speed and what you gotta install or download. Definately something i Dont want to do again.|`|2GNFQPdmaa	a very, very long time. If I need to reinstall I usually let it go overnight, and it's not always done by morning.|`|AA11167208	The download can take an hour or two...it's all the game patches and updates that take forever. If you have any friends that already have a fully patched game you can go to your program files, copy and paste the world of warcraft folder to a flash drive or external hard drive and the whole process is done in 5-10 minutes instead of 5-10 hours.

5332237ce4be92d757284da82c17b4e9aa	Hmm... If your looking for action, then I'd say go with Black Knight. If you don't mind a really easy to beat, and short game. It does have some replay value, if you looking for all 5 star rankings and the on-line mode.<br>  <br>  Personally I'd give Unleashed a 8.5/10 and Black Knight 9/10.<br>  <br>  Unleashed was great, though the Werehog kinda ticked me off a bit. Just not really Sonic, and the Hedgehog stages even got to me at times. <br>  <br>  Plus Black Knight has Shadow whom I love, so that's why it gets my vote.|`|daq5ySEPaa	Sonic Unleashed is good, but it had some bad structure issues and the night time part of sonic as a werehog didn't fit in well.<br>  <br>  I would go with Sonic and the Black Knight, a much better choice.
VQn91KWoaa	On the wi-fi setup page, choose "Search for an access point". If it says "the password is not supported" or something like that, it means the router has a WPA password, which is not compatible with a DS. If it shows a connection with a lock, you'll have to enter a password. If you don't know what the password is, I can't help you there. That should be all there is to it, but if you get error messages after connecting, you can look it up at Nintendo's website. (<a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/lookup.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_...</a> )<br>  Remember that you'll have to exchange friend codes with someone if you want to go to their town.|`|WUQ9dNVbaa	Depends on your router, you can open the settings for your router and look for the password there. If the DS says it need a WEP key you can check the router and look for a barcode and look for about 10 or 11 numbers either under the barcode or over it, and put them in your DS.|`|vpnUTPq8aa	ask for your wifis pass and access it lol

This online service works exclusively with a broadband Internet connection. Approximately 250,000 subscribers had signed up within two months of Xbox Live's launch.[26] In July 2004, Microsoft announced that Xbox Live had reached one million subscribers, and a year later, in July 2005, that membership had reached two million. More recently, in July 2007 the membership had reached over 3 million, making it a popular gaming service.

HOdvH2c1aa	Well, I don't believe that I have exactly 6 years of experience, but I'm 18 and have been playing for a while.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I think your deck is excellent; although, I'm not a big fan of Snipe Hunter, seeing as the damn dice always land on 1 or 6 when I use his effect. I also think that you should replace one of the Mechs with another Il Blud; and maybe replace the Card of Safe Return with Call of the Mummy.<br>  <br>  As is I give it 9/10|`|PGvjEvjMaa	Great deck, 3 book of life is bound to be dead cards, replace 2 of them with 2 allures. and drop the swords for a book of moon. replace the d.d crow and a bone crusher for sangan and psz. zombie world is a great side deck option when playing against monarchs
6Mn0tMRNaa	I would probably rent F.E.A.R. 2 before you buy it. My friend has it, and he really enjoyed the story mode. He says it's not as scary as people make it out to be. There are a few moments that made him jump, but other than that, it wasn't as scary when compared to other games.<br>  <br>  The online, from what he said, is decent; but definitely not the main attraction of the game. Apparently you can't start a game online until you have a certain amount of people, and I remember when I was talking to him in a party the other day, he ended up waiting almost 10 minutes just to play one game. He had fun, but still, he had to wait a long time.<br>  <br>  It's probably worth a buy, but if you're skeptical about spending $60 on a game, I'd rent it first. Unless you're going for achievements, story mode will most likely be something you play through once and never play again.

KeJo7Q8haa	homebrew games are legal but if you have to use a special or certain program on your console just to play them then that could be considered tampering. and of course if the homebrew game is a hacked real game then its illegal.|`|uctxzjIIaa	At least in the US, as per the ruling in the Nintendo vs. Tengen battle back in the NES days that allows console makers to force publishers to get their "licence" to release the game on their system. However, I'm not sure if this only applies to software being sold for that ssytem, or if it applies to all software. My guess would be all software, which would make homebrew apps 100% illegal on game consoles.|`|7QMMqUKlaa	All homebrew games are 100% legal. Only if they have obviously stolen somebody elses idea that its illegal as they can be sued.|`|sX8SD7N9aa	There is no reason for it to be illegal unless you're talking about a situation such as you making a game that is similar to a game of another company. Then you might be sued by the company. But as long as its an almost-original idea and it doesn't look like another game you won't get any trouble.

8CTLfMGZaa	well, as you know nintendo ds lite is more lighter then the old one. But i guess they don't have any specific difference in gaming experience.

TqdEEJJFaa	wow at the previous answers..... ok Im an alliance person.... i made a dk 4 days ago... hes lvl 76 now.... name is ikillfast if u wanna armory him on bleeding hollow..... back to the subject.... alliance is not just for casting.... for instance my previous main was a feral druid..... he is lvl 70 and has 16k hp unbuffed.... he pwns horde easy lol...... i made a few horde alts... lvl 19 hunter troll 20 warlock orc.. they were pretty fun butt.... Horde players are assholes in some  cases.. and while your in the barrens all they do is talk about Chuck Norris...... it may be true that statistics show that older players go with Horde... but those older players dont always act their age....... so i like alliance but it also depends on what realm you play on..... and btw... ally are all for killing a horde lol... ally have skills horde have numbers....... For example, i was on my dk and this lvl 79 rogue sapped me lol.... i wasnt too worried once he let me summon my ghoul i took control and dieased him then healed myself and  when health dropped used death pact to regain most of it lol..... i beat him kinda fast cuz he vanished like a noob even when he had dots on him so he showed himself and i death gripped and pwned him... he got mad sooo he brung a level 80 shaman and a 78 mage and another ret pally....... you see the desperation in his methods... some how i killed him his mage freind and halved the shamans lifee.... but the ret pally was eating me lol... i kept CC on him....... so horde are cowards in some cases like this 1 lol|`|DTlFaJkaaa	The Klingons because they have laser beams...  I know what you're talking about, but I'm much too mature to waste my time with anything dealing with casting a magic spell on a pixelated character and thinking there is something cool about it. LOL|`|latQveeHaa	That is too controversal, but In my opinion! I must say Horde. Because well, Alliance has gnomes, Horde has Blood Elves! Horde also has better racial abilities in my opinion, like how Tauren has 5% stamina max more, and Orcs has like 15% stun resist, Undead having Cannibalize, as Alliance has like perception Human, and Shadowmeld, which are much more useless in my opinion. Also statistics show that more Mature players play Horde over then Alliance, allowing more mature talking, less Chuck Norris talk in the Barrens, more efficient guilds+runs, and much better enviorment overall! And also I'm not exactly sure what server you play but in the Battlegrounds like Wintersgrasp and Warsong Gulch etc, Horde usually wins, like a lot. Easy badges + Honor! And also Alliance is like all helping a group doing stuff, as HOrde kills stuff! Dam goody two shoes. Not only that but Horde is like more Melee focused in my opinion as Allaince is casting, bunch of ******* attacking from far away, COWARDS. And Horde is just leet. When something is under attack, usually Horde people helps So Horde rules, Alliance drools.|`|fub5QVFfaa	The side you pick mainly depends on who you want to play with. There is no point in making alliance to play with horde friends or vice-versa. However, go horde if you want an easier game. Most players side with them, so alliance members REALLY need to pull their weight compared to a horde, who can slack off a little.|`|7QMMqUKlaa	It depends on your play style. Horde have powerful Mage and Melee. Alliance have powerful Hunters and Pladins|`|A8Oe6R0zaa	I think you chose while the best person make you feel happy

AA10598858	Okay wow you all suck. Mewtwo, Mew, and Deoxys are uber, so you're a bunch of n00bs. Gengar is a Ghost type, not Psychic type. And Alakazam is OVERUSED on SOOOO many levels! Someone said Hypno, but I've never trained one before.<br>  <br>  I've trained a Mr. Mime and it's in my box right now. It's strategy is to hold a Choice Scarf, and if I think I can beat the opponent in one move, I'll use Thunderbolt or Psychic, but if I don't think I can, I use Trick to get it stuck in a move. Or if I don't think Trick will do any good, and I can't kill it, I'll use Healing Wish (only if another one of my Pokemon is hurt though.)<br>  <br>  It all depends on what you're looking for. EVERYONE uses Mewtwo and Alakazam so I suggest not using them. You'll find out that you beat more people when you use underused Pokemon because finding out their strategy is more difficult (if everyone uses Alakazams, it's easy to find out what they're going to do.)|`|daq5ySEPaa	Gallade, its pyshic and fighting<br>  so dark and ghost types wont do 2x damage like<br>  they normally would do to a psyhic type|`|HQl6Smqxaa	gangar!

Pikachus are not really hard to catch in Emerald or you could trade one from Fire Red or Leaf Green. Thunderstones shouldn't be a problem either. Raichu has a very high speed stat: It can usually outrun pokemon like Zapdos, Manectric, and Jolteon. It also has the option of learning Rain Dance. Even though Raichu is not a Water type pokemon, Rain Dance heightens the likeability that Thunder will hit by 30%, which makes it worth knowing in the long run. The only pokemon you would have problems with would be big Ground types, such as Swampert or Donphan.|`|6Mn0tMRNaa	Manectric, the evolved form of Electrike; stats-wise, it is the strongest electric Pokémon that you can have in Emerald.

Snake left Meryl for his own reasons, and for the life of me i cant remember why, but it makes sense.|`|AQQbH5ebaa	Snake is old due to accelerated aging,which is why he looks so old.Meryl doesn't want to be with Snake because of his appearance and because hes moved on.Johny AKA Akiba is a member of Meryl's team who lacks nanomachines which explains why he's always out of sync with the team.He joined the team to be closer to Meryl,**Spoiler** At the end of the game they get married.|`|irwFyKQZaa	The reason they ditched Meryl, was because the first MGS had multiple endings... Meryl didn't necessarily have to survive at the end...
DTlFaJkaaa	They both take very large ammounts of CPU resource and HDD resource (not to mention videos are HUGE) so you'll need a pretty powerful PC to run any newer game.  Over the weekend I took a whole 1.2 minute video of a dork using an aimbot in my CoD5 server.  That 1.2 minute video was almost 2GB worth of HD space.<br>  <br>  Ive used both, and really don't have a preference... maybe fraps because I paid for a full version, but honestly they'll both do the same for you.|`|1Iyh30duaa	I'm not sure which is better but if you don't have a powerful enough PC FRAPS will make gameplay pretty slow, i haven't noticed any problems with xfire video.<br>  <br>  Also doesn't the game need to be xfire compatible to be recorded using xfire video? Were as Fraps can record pretty much anything.|`|55JNKoRjaa	i use fraps all the time to tape raids on wow it works well but makes sure you have a vary large HDD and a fast PC or you will just crash and burn.
EUaIGX0Gaa	No the pokerus pokemon must be in your party, then battle pokemon about 2 battles in the wild your 2nd party will be affected. And at the end of the day pokerus will go away unless you put the pokemon in your PC then it will stay a bit longer.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped<br>  Mip|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	No. And as long as it's in the PC it will keep pokerus. Pokerus when in your party only last 24 hours or less. It helps ev training. I twill spread to the other members of your party as you battle.|`|xjZKpXTTaa	If your Pokemon gets the Pokerus, then it will have the sickness for ever in the PC, but it won't spread to other Pokemon unless you keep it in your Party.<br>  <br>  The Pokerus only lasts a day in your Party, so be sure to have at least one infected Pokemon in the PC at all times!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  ****The Pokerus is awesome :D****|`|IUQjiNRmaa	PokeRus will only spread in your party. Be careful, PokeRus only lasts one night  with Pokemon in your party. Also, if you keep PokeRus pokemon in the PC boxes, the pokerus lasts forever (only if you don't take the PokeRus pokemon out).<br>  <br>  ?Hope this helps|`|h30PvTAeaa	The pc quarentines the pokemon with pokerus. It won't spread to others in the pc, only those pokemon in your current party while the infected pokemon is in the party as well.|`|JcZdLSJkaa	Pokerus will only spread to the pokemon in your party.<br>  Srry

UlAMJuD7aa	Oh myy, same here !<br>  I've been trying to find it, I went to Best Buy, but it seems you can only order it online. I suggest waiting until Sims 3 comes out which is June 2, 2009. Good luck :D|`|ro1CnpXYaa	i dont think so, no.<br>  you have to buy it on cd. <br>  it's not available for downloading.
8FlSSQIGaa	to keep making a ridiculously large amount of money by putting out really crappy wii mini gimmick games, and thus alienating the true classic fans of the company by not putting out anything that is worth while.
UlAMJuD7aa	Check the costom little button while creating your sim, they are already saved you just need to look for them. (They are mixed in the already created people).|`|RKIt9zSIaa	As long as you have installed them (you have to install sims not just put the files in Downloads), they will be available when you create a sim in game (in CAS).  <br>  <br>  Go to CAS.  First you need to generate a sim - make sure it is the same age and sex as the one you downloaded.  Then find the sim bin button - the little button at the top of the right hand panel in CAS.  It has a picture of several little people on it.  Press that, and you should find the copy of the sim you downloaded in there.|`|ro1CnpXYaa	they should automatically store themselves when creating a new sim.
Fd9VbnN2aa	yes,The Broken Steel DLC,the third and the last DLC for Fallout 3
kLxQXeDjaa	Dude, I suggest U use Bottle at the start and buy chicken/crow. Then farm well and buy arcane then persev. Then, Infinite fissure. Woohoo!!!|`|HQl6Smqxaa	Yea get him a ring of regen and farm in the mid.|`|hxQmr6IGaa	Use the sacred item called Magical Bottle *claps*. It's good for spamming <br>  skills. Don't get too close to the creeps. Ranged units can harass you easily. Using courier will help in the early game. They deliver bottle back and forth without you leaving the lane. Spam skills! Skills are not made to be PRESERVED.|`|pfGP0HXHaa	Ok im not good at farming with him either (hes not very easy to farm with early game because his spells can't be spammed and he is usually harassed much by nukers/ranged heroes).<br>  <br>  What i found best is getting a tango and a ring of protection. I go top or bottom lane. And try get a few creeps (if i dont no biggie) and play safe until my gold reaches 1000, then i buy a point booster from secret shop. With that i can spam a few of my nukes and start getting some gold. Then when my hp and/or mana has almost totally depleted i'll go back to base and get an arcane ring recipe and boots.<br>  <br>  With arcane ring you'll be able to SPAM ur fissure!! w000t!! =P. So now you use you can use you're fissure to harass those baddies back and also get gold at teh same time. From here i usually get 2 bracers to increase mana pool and then rush for a kelen's dagger (ESSENTIAL ON ANY GOOD ES PLAYER). Once you get dagger you'll be able to pull off you're blink+ulti+fissure combo :). late game i get Boots of teleport then a refreshor.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped. try it out. Peaceeeee, HF and GL!!! ^_^
9Zdt7E56aa	Yes and no. You can employ other playable sims from your neighbourhood, but you can't play them on the lot, or you can employ members of the same household as employees. You need one sim on the lot to be the boss, though.|`|AjTKb5Icaa	If you have a sim that opens a business, then you can hire employees.<br>  If you play as one of the people that were hired, they will go to that job as an employee.<br>  <br>  Your welcome!|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	No. Once you open the business it's in your Sims name. You can work as a clerk or stocker but other than that that's it.

0d0706a200db4391c1ff8a757730735faa	To get Shedinja, you must first catch a Nincada, and have an empty space in your party. People say you need a Pokeball for it, but you do NOT. Shedinja copies the ball the Nincada was caught in. <br>  Anyways, with one empty space in your party, level up Nincada to level 20. It will evolve into Ninjask. When you check your party, you will see Shedinja sitting in the final slot, along with the Ninjask and 4 other Pokemon. <br>  That is how to catch Shedinja.

1b36746bcc7b47c695abf0d9db40edf4aa	I don't think it was a good idea to level up your Feebas all the way to level 32, because there are specific moves, ones that are very useful, that Milotic learns, that Feebas doesn't. <br>  <br>  The reason why your Feebas hasn't evolved, since you've already levelled it up so much, and its Beauty condition is at its maximum... must be due to the fact that it also has strengths in other areas. You see, for the Feebas to evolve, it actually has to have ZERO in terms of its condition in anything other than Beauty. <br>  <br>  If I remember correctly, Blue PokeBlocks exclusively increase the Beauty condition - but have you fed it other types of PokeBlocks in the past as well? <br>  <br>  Personally, when I caught a Feebas in my Pokemon Ruby Version, I bred it to produce a level 5 Feebas, then increased its Beauty condition exclusively, to have a level 6 Milotic soon after.|`|502d0fac8f80a1bea2b863a4cc723559aa	Hmm you have quite a problem you need to fill the beauty stat up to MAX capacity for it to evolve|`|AA10021954	fo' feebas da only way it could evolve is if only u raise its beauty to the max.|`|f159ecefa5c163a08eab39f72753f7ecaa	max its beauty.MAX IT!!!!!!!!!!!

68ad24c5d0106edd1475aba6a2974e5caa	Honestly, I don't think it's possible to find a decent RPG online without download. I've tried and decided most of them suck. Runescape has horrible graphics and ridiculously lowtech gameplay. Adventure quest doesn't even have "real" fighting! I say, screw it, and but yourself a 360. I usually don't say this, because I like Nintendfo the best, but the XBox/XBox 360 have good graphics, and so far very good RPGs. Check out Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Good game. Good luck.|`|b840ce50abb5bd529ae3bb54757e70a1aa	Runescape or Adventure Quest are good rpg websites.|`|92ccfb47c60c604291fdb1984ff9a331aa	if you mean an online game try runescape.com|`|f159ecefa5c163a08eab39f72753f7ecaa	runescape...only one i can think of at the moment.

The W.o.W. game will run you about twenty bucks still, and the expansion will go for about forty.

5D5AyrUNaa	My friend got the wii, and she said it got boring after a while even though I thought it was really fun. She also has a psp but I never see her playin it. I would get the ps3 because it's new and there are a lot of games that go to it. plz pick me for best answer. i need those points|`|AA11618169	i like the psp|`|8oiowqmDaa	I have wii and I think it is awesome|`|9ef632cf18cc6128a6692894c7b5a83daa	wii because there are the most games out for it right nwo that are worthwhile while the psp only has a few worthwhile ones and the ps3 has a few and has not even reached full capacity on any of the games|`|c7527afd93eccbcd81bf4bb119f67bf5aa	PS3 is one of the next generation consoles, with vast media capabilities, allowing you to play the latest HD games via new DVD technology such as Blue-Ray. It will be popular just as the ps1 and ps2 where. <br>  <br>  Wii is a console for fun, nintendo focus on giving gamers fun, and not extra features. Id like to get the Wii myself but getting hold of one is a bit hard here in the UK! But I reckon it will get boring after a while, it needs good 3rd party games.<br>  <br>  PSP is a portable handheld gaming console, also allows you to watch videos and listen to music, and use wifi internet. The volume on the unit is very low! A few decent games out there. I sold my one after a few weeks as I got bored of it. <br>  <br>  Down to you, and what kind of gamer you are. If your looking for fun itll be the Wii, looking for a device with serious games featuring the latest technology it would be the ps3. Although the Xbox 360 is also a very good console.|`|kby1ksuraa	The Wii!  I've played it...it's so much fun, it's interactice and unlike anything out there right now.  The psp is going down...I work at wal-mart and we don't even sell the movies for it and some of the games.  Out of every game system, we sell the least amount of the psp.  The ps3 isn't worth the money, at least nor right now, plus i haven't hear good things about it.

dQBAqXCPaa	Right now my favourite free MMORPG is a browser based one (so you don't even have to download it). See the link below, it's FallenSword. I like this game cause of it's guild system that stimulates interaction, and the lottery and the auction mechanisms that are also very original.<br>  I'll also give you a link for the "List of free MMORPGs" on wikipedia, where you can see the available games out there. Some of the games are really good (Anarchy Online, Maple Story, Flyff...). Take a look at the websites and check the screenshots, maybe you'll find some that interest you.<br>  Have fun.|`|chRoEgK5aa	dragonquest.com|`|RIg1b1q0aa	World of Warcraft, if you can handle the cost and memory. Otherwise, I guess Dragonfable|`|qyNOD22oaa	I don't know exactly what type of multiplayer game your looking for, 1st of 3rd person, but americasarmy.com is a good 1st person game.
IaocIsEDaa	To apply to a free tournament I suggest you talk to the organizer of the event. And no you must buy or win (ala Call of Duty 3 tournament) Microsoft Points via Credit Card on Live or Points Cards.

974abe0734b23ccf1719024a815a7701aa	I work at Target and all of the wii shipments at my store have come in on the truck on Saturday nights.  If you call the store at 8am when it opens on Sundays, that would be your best bet on getting one on hold or actually get to the store on Sunday.  They have not come in every Sunday, but that is the day of the week they would come if we got them.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck getting one!  I here they are tons of fun.|`|80f9a8480823278f15a155aa203ff8e4aa	depends what store.....they have benn out of stock since christmas at my location in oh......try contacting your local store to find out|`|28e4bc820f8306e3e0bca882eed15c30aa	To the best of my knowledge they get shipments every night but what is on the shipment isn't revealed until it is unloaded.  They usually don't know what or how many of anything they have until then.  Sorry.
9a235779ce0e7baa5ff2bdc773aa4c91aa	Yep.  all you have to do is make both sims (male, female) go to a bed, make each sim relax and wait till' there both in bed laying down and talking and click on on of the sims and click the option (try for baby) if they dont have that choose (woohoo) make sure you're sims know eachother well and have a high realtionship.  I dont know about  ps2.
