You throw it at a speed of 20.0 m/s at an angle of 50 degrees above the horizontal. The snowball leaves your hand at 1.00m above the ground. The tree is very skinny, a distance of 30.0m from you and is 12.0m tall.    Does the snowball make it over the tree?    How high above the ground or above the tree does it hit and what are its magnitude and direction?      I know the anser is that it hits the tree 10.07m above the ground. The velocity is 14.9 m/s at an angle of 30.42 degrees below the horizontal.       I just don't know how to do the question with the tree in the way      thanks

20070926121404AAM9psp	Science & Mathematics;Physics	College physics question?	How do you do this and what is the answer.  Please show and explain all work.  Thanks!      "A car is parked on a cliff overlooking the ocean on an incline that makes an angle of 15 degrees below the horizontal.  The driver leaves the car in neutral, and the car rolls from rest down the incline with a constant acceleration of 2.43 m/s squared for a distance of 60.0m to the edge of the cliff, which is 35.0m high.      a) find the car's position relative to the base of the cliff when the car lands in the ocean      b) find the length of time the car is in the air"      Ok, so I've gotten as far as determining the velocity of the car when it leaves the edge of the cliff.  I found this to be 8.5385 m/s.  Am I right?  Did I even need this step?  And what's next?

But I have a feeling this is not right as I don't understand why then the       (a,b) = {x|x e Reals and a<x<b}      I understand that x is some element that is less than b and greater than a, but have no idea about how this is supposed to apply to the F intersect and union of G.

Last year, in Algebra, my average was always above a 95%, and my Geo teacher says Geometry just invovles alot of Algebra so I have to be good at Algebra (which I was), so then why am I failing Geometry?! I memorized all the formulas, and all the different rules and definitions. But I just don't get why I'm failing! (I do fine on the HW, but when it comes to tests and quizzes I do so bad!)       I need an average over 85% to get into AP classes next year. (I need to maintain that average for 3 marking periods in a row) Last year, I was doing Kumon, and that kinda helped, but now Kumon doesn't cover Geometry, so I don't know what to do! Please help!

20081014185055AA0DL62	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Should I have taken calculus BC instead of AB?	I am a freshman in high school. I took Algebra 1 in 6th grade, Geometry in 7th, and Algebra 2 in 8th grade. My Algebra 2 book was really a Pre-calculus book in disguise, it covered all the topics, including logarithms, vectors, matrices, derivatives, and limits. When I took the test to test into Pre-Calculus, I actually tested into Calculus BC in freshman year, but decided to drop down to AB, the middle option. I apparently aced the test (100%), which was actually the same test as the test to test into Calculus. That must explain why I tested into BC. What I want to know is, should I have taken BC instead of AB? Is it better to receive the 2 years of college credit, or to go further ahead? Now, I think I will take either:   1. AB AP in frosh yr   2. BC AP in soph yr   3. Multivariable Calc H in jr year   4. Prob/Statistics AP in sr year OR Discrete Math      If I had taken BC, I could have taken both Prob/Stats and Discrete Math, although I could take them both in senior year.    However, this means I could have taken them both in junior year, and then taken a course at a college in senior year.       Should I have taken Calculus BC instead of AB in freshman year?

20090307105613AAp01QK	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Can somebody basically explain dark energy to me?	So, the mass-energy in the universe that we live in consists of 4% visible matter, 23% dark matter and 73% dark energy, or something. I know that the stuff in visible matter is made from energy converting into mass, dark matter is like, matter that we can't see the radiation of and is possibly mostly neutrinos, but it's the last bit that confuses me.      I know that dark energy is the reason the universe is expanding at an increasing rate, but... what is it? Just another form of energy that we can't detect? And why does it take up such a big amount of the universe's composition? I'm intrigued.      I'm not a pro on anything like this, so simple answers please (there will be a best answer and all that jazz.) Much appreciated!
20081117185723AAawQ6F	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	What do you think about a math book with only examples ?	If you have already answered, then please don't respond again. I would like to know the opinions of those who haven't had a chance to answer.      Students in my past algebra classes (college level) have informed me that the textbooks do not have enough examples and lack detail. (I don't want to go into the details of this, but it's mainly to reduce the cost of the book). I am currently working on an example book just for ALGEBRA. The purpose of this book is to provide a variety of examples for students. I do plan on marketing this book for teachers, students as well home-schoolers. There will be detailed examples at different degrees of difficulty. It will also contain practice problems, with the solutions online.      In addition, a few of the examples will require thought process, and will not be found in any other textbooks. It will also contain real life application problems that use algebra, unlike those train problems. This will give students an interesting perspective on algebra.      I realize there are some books out there such as Schaum's outlines, but they usually only contain simple examples that you can find in any math book.      I am not recommending students learn algebra from this book. It should not be mistaken for a textbook, but rather an example book to be used along with the required textbook.      I would like to hear from some of you and what you think. Any suggestions are appreciated.      Thank you.

20090307103842AAKXAcL	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	I have a problem with infinity....?	So, if the universe is an estimated 11 billion years old, then that obviously suggests a beginning, a start point. Where there is a beginning, there's also an end, by which I mean a physical end point. If the universe has an age and a point of conception, it is therefore a finite, contained body.   So, what exists outside the finite body that is the universe? Beyond its boundaries.   Nothing?   It can't be nothing. For it truly to be nothing, the universe itself would have to cease to exist.    Suggesting that the universe must be infinite.    Yet infinity neither has a beginning nor an end.....   And I find the concept of eterenity difficult to fully grasp.   On a separate yet related note.....I know very little about the big bang other than its most basic concept....but if energy cannot be created or destroyed, and can only change form...then where did the initial matter which created the big bang come from?   It can't have spontaneously appeared....   Discuss!

20090307110947AAoKvd2	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Chemistry 126 (II) -- pH of solution?	What is the pH of a solution obtained from adding 174 ml 0.69 M NaOH to 60 mL 0.44 M Phosphoric acid, H3PO4?       I was given three Ka values, one for H3PO4 reaction equation, one for H2PO4-, and the third for HPO4 2-... (2- is the charge on it)..      I tried using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:   pH = pKa + log([Base]/[Acid])    I used the first Ka to find pKa because after I calculated mmol of each compound, amount of Acid was greater than Base.      My second question is did I choose the right Ka? (apparently not..) and when I am given more than one Ka, which do I use or how do I use them?      Any sort of help is appreciated, thanks!
20090307111557AAqYwMp	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Chemistry Buffer question?	Calculate the pH of a solution that results when 44 ml of buffer 1 is combined with 60 ml of buffer 2. Buffer 1 is 0.30 M in ClCH2COOH and 0.26 M NaClCH2COO and buffer 2 is is 0.15 M in ClCH2COOH and 0.39 M NaClCH2COO. (ClCH2COOH: Ka = 1.35 x 10-3 M)      I used the concentrations of Na(etc) and multiplied them by the volumes of each to find mmol.   I then found the total number of mmols and total volume.   I found concentration by dividing mmols over volume.   I then used the Ka provided to find Kb... I used Kb to find the concentration of Base, then took -log[Base]    then I did 14=pOH+pH where pOH = -log[Base]   It didn't work...      Thanks! :)
