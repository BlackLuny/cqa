KEgN3KLtaa	You're looking at it. Unattractive, unsociable, fat, AND lazy.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, wow, I'm so happy everyone agrees my life sucks! xD|`|XnGCW0k0aa	well one you can change completely the other you can change to some degree. you could make yourself more attractive by being completely sociable - girls apparently only kinda half judge guys on looks and the rest is personality they don't think like men do. so as long as you pass a certain degree of attractiveness  then they could like you.<br>  <br>  unless you are gay then i am not sure how that works|`|DdEzv3NCaa	Yeah<br>  <br>  Weird, fat, unattractive and lazy. But no one is. And I am not describing you there! It's my kind of answer of what I think is a worse mixture.|`|AA11034523	yeah, unsociable and obnoxious (me)|`|FNdsPNrJaa	And who gave you the idea you were these things?....|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	When someone is all that, but doesn't think so. ~:)>|`|xGNM8J6yaa	Yeah me too.|`|yi7Q1oIPaa	Do you smell too?|`|VXy34K7Caa	you could be a one legged man trying to win a standing self **** kicking competition.<br>  or HIV positive.|`|hEJ5GCPCaa	no bahahah that would suck though|`|mggll8dRaa	Not really, unless you add loud too....!!|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Add low self esteem to that and that would be a worse mixture.<br>  Have faith in yourself.|`|XhzvFAK2aa	Try and develop your self confidence and self esteem, challenge these factors by being a little more of the opposite, and blending the two.   In fact, don't even use constraining words to define your personality.  Good luck|`|AA12302661	Hmm.. Probably.<br>  <br>  Me?|`|zLUk9YyCaa	yep...sociopaths, psychos...they are the most hated I think.

lZJWZ1rSaa	been waiting.
31CUQuKNaa	depends on what its about, if your not giving me enough then dear i will argue until you either do or run away,  or about me watching football you cant win. but most other things i will walk away or let u feel like you won, just to make u shut up and feel good about yourself. then mabe tonight you will give me some more.|`|9VaWal2Daa	I stay until my enemy has been soundly ground into the DIRT........then I spit on the ashes, where I BURNED them to the ground,,,,,,,,,,and THEN, I walk away.  Job well done!|`|B5KR2Yjlaa	If it's something that really matters to me then I'll argue if I need to but if it's something lame then there's no point- i'll walk away|`|zLUk9YyCaa	walk away.|`|AA10997134	walk away, argueing just causes upset|`|AA12302661	Argue my case out..<br>  <br>  Sometimes I just walk away.|`|BXxar1rSaa	No need to argue, when you have fists!<br>  <br>  Naww, Im joking, I like arguing..|`|XVVkrlnTaa	Argue until I see that is has no point or the other party says i'm right.|`|adLSRFrZaa	It depends.  When I was younger I would argue every time.  I thought I could change people's minds.  Today, however, I realize that changing people's minds by arguing with them is not always possible.  I now pick by battles carefully, and if I decide to argue with someone, I do it for a good reason - either because their mind can be changed, or because they have done something so bad that I don't care what the consequences to the relationship are.  Sometimes you feel you just have to speak up when someone disrespects you to protect your own dignity and respect.|`|cJDc1UGTaa	Depends on the subject that is being argued.<br>  <br>  And also, if it's something I feel strongly about, and feel the need to input my opinions, or if I feel like the person I am talking to is wrong in saying/doing whatever they're saying, I'll stay.<br>  <br>  But, if they're arguing for the sole purpose of arguing, I'll walk away. 'Cause that's just stupid.|`|u1t12bsAaa	Walk away. Unless its absolutely important life is much too short.|`|G1VsV0wWaa	There are a lot of variables that determine if I stay and argue or if I walk away...|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	Walk away -- when you argue w/ an idiot, no one can tell you apart! ~:)>|`|A82sY8JSaa	I like argue with you, Don,t you|`|f430b2Iaaa	I'm always wrong so I just walk away.|`|EeoYSgzQaa	Depends|`|wacKJOcBaa	walk away|`|8Og1ZRUraa	Someone starts a fight with me, I would finish it - i would argue.|`|0xRhEUo5aa	Lol. Argue. I like to prove my point.|`|8SQ4HvrBaa	it's best to not bother your self and if you have to stay you should|`|ft5uiNoGaa	hmm i argue then wish i had have walked away...|`|udhJhIkIaa	I won't walk away until i win. :p|`|7hrOjPwjaa	I like to agrue. It can actually be constructive if you do it right.|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	walk away my dear Sue!!!|`|G6Uy43coaa	I agree with Dr, House.  Nothing gets resolved by walking away.  But you have to be willing  to walk away knowing you may not be able to go back.  I like leaving doors open.<br>  <br>  besides...people can stay and not have to argue...they can "discuss".|`|f3SyOyMEaa	It totally depends on the situation and who it's with, but I would have to say that 95% of the time I stay and argue it out. It's not that I like it, it's just that Irish blood I guess.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	honestly i would prefer to hit them upside their head and punch them. but i cant. so i walk away before i do.|`|uJskRjP7aa	Stay and argue, especially if i know i'm in the right.

I just want to jump through the TV screen and pull off that fake wig.|`|DzuhMDTlaa	Being's she's just a TV judge, with no power to put me in jail, or fine me....YEAH, I'd even B***h slap her sassy hindend right outta her chair....NO ONE will ever sass BLUE EYES!!!!!  you can take that to the bank!!!!<br>  <br>  'BLUE EYES HAS LEFT THE THEATRE!!!!!"|`|mu94enaVaa	cuss? its pronounced 'curse'|`|ArvEdl3paa	Yes yes yes yes.<br>  Especially if I knew I was right and she kept calling me a liar, hah.<br>  <br>  She's funny but tends to get annoying.|`|xGNM8J6yaa	No|`|baW9u4yLaa	If she asked for it...|`|AA12302661	No. I rather just argue with her.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	no|`|ob9oJpKbaa	No way! She would tear shreads of anyone! Respect man- she is a woman I would not mess with!|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	Before or after I fire-bombed her car?! ~:)>|`|AQIhcBiuaa	I would be too busy laughing at her.

RzaP9bQmaa	Because he had a bad Habit just shows how the man can relate to people more on certain subjects.  No-one is perfect. <br>  <br>  Regarding the sponsors I have noticed that the recent sponsors have all been online bingo.  But who remembers when Jeremy Kyle show first come on air? Who was the shows first sponsors? <br>  <br>  Learn direct.<br>  <br>  Jeremy Kyle dose not pick the shows sponsors, the producers do that.  <br>  End of the day a lot of companies need and want their Business seen to make a profit, the best way they can do this is to advertise on a tv show that has a lot of public viewing.   That so happens to be the Kyle show.|`|h1vYbEY2aa	jeremy kyle is as bad as the chavs on his so called show|`|GXct0PFGaa	That why he is giving the bloke on there now, such a hard time.|`|V60ebzJzaa	Me thinks a double standard!|`|wmBK9uASaa	Yes I see your point...|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Money talks and what reputable company would target that show's audience?|`|AA12302661	Because he's an ex-gambler..|`|oWHplAzwaa	He's keeping it real|`|TQEwCRpGaa	WOW!<br>  <br>  I never thought of that, what a great point...<br>  <br>  He's a right tosser anyway...|`|3w7ekDQJaa	what a hypocrite!

I'll be happy to tell you a little about them:<br>  <br>  Myspace is an HTML based website, meaning you could "pimp out your [my]space", it's actually kind of fun, but when it comes to the mail, and stuff it is really quite nice.<br>  <br>  Facebook is more muture, so that why not a lot of kids have them. Facebook can be rather boring, but it's getting better. Because on Facebook you cannot make anything look how you want, all you can do it basicly talk.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|6db9945ff407961b87dcdc1c2327d1dbaa	It depends on what your purpose is.  If it's more on social networking with new people, I'd say myspace, but it's more of getting in touch with people you already know, then I'd say facebook.|`|SGreWjXaaa	Myspace!<br>  <br>  Only reason Facebook is more used is because it's new.<br>  <br>  When a new thing comes out, Myspace & Facebook will be gone.|`|FNdsPNrJaa	Oh dear god...you really have to ask that?

They bunk all the classes and sleep 10 hours a day but most of them get top grades. Every Sagittarius have a world on their own and they are light years ahead of the present world mentally. They all have keen intellects and extraordinary ideas even as children. They are always lost in thoughts and will be unaware of what's going on around them.If you ask them something they will immediately tell the answer with an intuition. Ask them how,they would take few seconds to collect their thoughts and explain why.|`|gkThLcf2aa	I'm a sag, i'm lazy, i'm a genius and i'm a big weirdo :)|`|30R7gIXtaa	I am|`|HiS1zhXUaa	im a Sagittarius  and im not lazy or a weirdo whats up with that question anyway?|`|o1FlmPv8aa	i'm sag, and my friends says im lazy, weird but genius..<br>  dunno why...|`|Bphe481Faa	This is true.

UuSK08pyaa	Actually the website probably isn't taking more members because there isn't going to be a BMG club anymore. I've been  a member for a long time and we just got a notice saying that the club is switching over to new ownership or something like that and will no longer be BMG. I'd imagine that when you signed up they started sending you the selection of the month (which I believe ships automatically unless you log in to your account every month to decline them). Also, I think when you sign up for BMG there is a required amount of CD's you have to purchase before you can get out of the club. Probably the reason they wouldn't cancel your membership, but I could be wrong. I'd try contacting them again.|`|B43x5RF8aa	Complete your commitment and they will stop harassing you|`|32d808376cd2ba67d02e1e31adfd3d09aa	just send them a note

6Au5FIYWaa	In my experience... they can be very stubborn. They are a fixed sign, after all. They are also very socially-oriented, and I feel that this can make them appear disloyal when in reality they are just sort of detached and see people differently. In my own experience, they also like to stir up drama with themselves often, but not always, at the centre of it - such a thing is representative of the wider social circle (11th house issues with friends/aquaintances and so on).<br>  From what I've seen, they can be great people to have at a party, because they will most certainly liven it up, but not so good a close friend to lil water signs like myself (and I suppose you too perhaps).|`|1PdUecpYaa	the ones i know aren't rude at all.. they love talking to me...<br>  i know a few bitchy capricorn girls too...|`|hQLtxiseaa	I'm an Aquarius female.

But I don't blame them, he's very well respected and he was the perfect choice to take over the duties of Jari.  But the latest album with his debut is very lacking in my opinion.  Again, I never was a fan of his vocals to start with, but also this album is lacking in guitar-greatness.....I don't know if that's something Petri should be the blame for or if it's just that Jari is gone.   As far as Norther is concerned, like I said I never got into them and don't know if their new singer/guitarist is any better.  You tell me....is the new guy an improvement or no?|`|SnNMMwKYaa	okay, heaven is boring. im sorry but ... half the time i didnt even know these people existed!!! i usually have no idea what you are talking about!!!! ~sorry~ Could you explain to me who this person is? my email is: all.ineedisme@yahoo.com<br>  this is for anyone to email me too. =)
3Tmxusk2aa	okay so im not familiar with ozzie law, though i am a lawyer...so just consider the following...<br>  <br>  if alcohol served at the events, u might need a license...<br>  also you might need permission from the local authorities as to the venue etc...<br>  in terms of sponsors, make sure that they fully understand that money going for donation and such.. also its IMPORTANT to read every contract you sighn with the sponsors and with the contestants...you might want them to sign an indemnity agreement before the competition starts so that they cant sue you if the get injured while in the course of the event...<br>  lastly, get some security firm to protect people and keep order etc, and read the contract before you sign it....thats all i can think of at the top of my head...goodluck hope its awesome!|`|m2eHPeciaa	legally  i don't know about advertising in the club unless u get the owners permission. i suggest doing it n the street, but most of the time people are too drunk to remember. i would suggest going to dance studios n putting up flyer's there. make sure everyone is 18+ i think its a great idea BTW!!!

5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	I remember being where your at now. I was new to jazz and didn't know a thing beyond Miles and Trane. I didn't have a website like this so I called up the local college radio station and begged for some suggestions. I was lucky, because that night the dj had a few of his friends hanging out in the studio with him. They were all yelling out albums, and getting excited about each others suggestions. I was writing them down as fast as I could.<br>  They did me right. Now all these years later, I can pass on the short list version, with my own own approval.<br>  <br>  <br>  Miles Davis Kind of Blue album. It's a great album for a beginner, and it's great even if you've heard a whole lot of jazz. Get it. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql...</a><br>  <br>  Thelonious is another great and important master of jazz. I suggest that you start out with the Monk's Dream album. Don't operate heavy machinery while listening. Monk swings the hardest of any jazz musician, in my little opinion. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  This is the album that really turned me onto jazz. I still enjoy it and respect it. Roland Kirk's Inflated Tear album.<br>  <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql...</a><br>  <br>  Booker Ervin's album called The Freedom Book is completely amazing, from start to finish. The chemistry of the musicians is amazing.<br>  <br>  Grant Green's Matador album is a great album, centered around the guitar playing, although McCoy Tyner is at his best (piano player from Coltrane's band). It's another great album that's easy to like. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  Wayne Shorter's album called Speak Like A Child is a great album that you really have to hear. I can't even talk about it. The whole band is amazing. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql...</a><br>  <br>  Herbie Hancock's album, Maiden Voyage is another great and easy to like album. Freddie Hubbard is at his best through the whole album (on trumpet, fluglehorn). It's a concept album, and it really does flow like the sea, as Herbie intended it to. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  Horace Silver plays piano with soul. The songs are great and so is the band. Everything works on this album called Song For My Father. It's another easy to like album too. <a href="http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok..." rel="nofollow">http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&tok...</a><br>  <br>  Oliver Nelson's album called Blues and the Abstract Truth is another classic. It features the great Eric Dolphy. Get it!<br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly, I think that the jazz of the current scene is some of the best I have ever heard. I live near New York City, and I am lucky enough to be able to hear today's musicians in little intimate places. Today's jazz musicians are VERY creative. Its not popular because its not advertised, and like Frank Zappa said "Most people wouldn't know good music if it hit them over the head". Anyway, here is a short list of musicians/albums that are great, in my opinion, and easy for a beginner to "get".<br>  <br>  Drew Gress- Seven Black Butterflies. This band is amazing. The songs are constantly changing and morphing. I saw this band a few weeks ago, and they were great. I really think you should hear this album if you are interested in whats modern in jazz.<br>  <br>  I'm going to stop commenting on each one for the rest of the list. I am only listing the albums which totally blow me away. I don't know if they are good for your tastes, but I do know that if you like this kind of thing, you hear albums that are a complete success at what the artist was trying to create, and in all cases, the albums were motivated to make music that is completely unique and adventerous.<br>  <br>  Scott Colley- Archetiect of the Silent Moment. Excellent.<br>  <br>  John Ellis- Roots Branches and Leaves<br>  <br>  Kurt Rosenwinkel-Deep Song (any album)<br>  <br>  Seamus Blake- Stranger Things Have Happened<br>  <br>  Ried Anderson- Dirty Showtunes<br>  <br>  Ari Hoenig- Inversations<br>  <br>  Mario Pavone- Toulon Days<br>  <br>  Charles Lloyd Rabo De Nube<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't listen to too many singers beyond the legends, but I can suggest some classic albums that I know are great.<br>  <br>  Sarah Vaughan- Self titled album, also known as Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown. Great singing and great band. Also get Sarah's Like at Mr. Kelly's album.<br>  <br>  Sheila Jordan- Portrait of Sheila Jordan. Very mellow.<br>  <br>  I promise that my answers are from personal experience and that I listen to lots of jazz.<br>  <br>  PS-The best radio station for jazz (BY FAR) is WKCR(.org).

sOCLwxnFaa	Ashley Cole hands down
9vOBtO1Oaa	My second husband, seeming so different from the previously promiscuous, lying and cheating one, proposed we take an outing which would last through a holiday week-end. I, delighted, say yes. At least I'll enjoy a day with this trusted, "good" mate, Finally.<br>  However, we never go to the outing. In the car he tells me he has to go to work instead but had had no knowledge of it till that very morning...but had chosen not to s disturb me with the change...after all, "did we not have Sunday and Monday, to look forward to, for ourselves?"<br>  I agree. After all, he is a very busy architect and I am into designing decor.<br>  I go to work with him and he tells me to go into a room at the end of the hall, so that he'll have NO interferences...except that as he escorts to me to it, an elevator door opens, and a very provocatively acting woman, whom I've known he's known from another place of work, enters the hallway..and tells him, she is also on the architectural design project he is working on.<br>  I tend to believe him, although alarms go off in my mind which had so determinedly wanted to trust anew...so I go to the far-off room.<br>  He tells me, he'll call me once they have discussed the their design. Hours pass, perhaps 3, 4. But I respect work too much to interfere by peeking. Finally a call from his office comes...he tells me MS. "Mae West" reincarnated, has suggested I design the decor of their structure...something which, in doing, will make me take heights up extended ladders of 2 or 3 storeys. I mention to good old hubby that; "does he not remember my phobia for great heights?' To which he replies : 'It's what's been ordered, I guess...(duh!)'<br>  The woman has left but as my husband puts pulls down the sleeves of his shirt, I see that a very red kiss has been planted on his upper arm. A brand to be recognized, for certain. So obvious is the red of the lipstick.<br>  Facetiously, I ask him<br>   , if we'll still do the outing tomorrow and Monday...to which he replies; 'I'm afraid not. I am needed at the office.' - there is always next Saturday , you know...' So I respond, without flashing an eyelash; 'No, there isn't  "hon" , you see, if you stop to eat dinner alone someplace and do take your time, because I'll need it. when you return to "OUR Home" you'll find your things packed and gathered at the door's threshold! Please, don't come back. Thank you!'<br>  And I leave him there, looking aghast..for little had he expected of me, whom he'd thought was just another little dog or sheep, to have always been a cat, more likely a jaguar!!!<br>  <br>  End of dream.<br>  Time to Waken & AWAKEN, would you not say, S.J?<br>  hmm...G.|`|mggll8dRaa	An Ocean Cruise...!!|`|QJwOhM0qaa	I was hanging out in front of the Red Lion Inn drinking a jug of red wine with Norman Rockwell & Jack Kerouac.

Curious, I put her in the house and walked down the hill to investigate what she'd gotten into so I could be sure it was nothing dangerous. I noticed there was an old pie tin with half eaten meat on the border of my property and the neighbors. I began to worry that the meat had been poisoned and set out to kill a skunk or something, and I got a horrible sinking feeling in my gut. The neighbors were in the yard bent over their flowers, but I was too upset to ask them myself. I was worried I would get upset and loose control of my emotions.<br>  <br>  My brother appeared, and I asked him to go ask about the meat. He tried to tell me I was being paranoid and that Copper was probably fine, but I talked him into it. As he headed over the hill I went into the house to check on Copper, and she seemed okay. Her breathing was fine, her gums were pink, her heart rate even, and her eyes were clear. Once I had finished checking Copper over, my brother walked back in, and I could tell by the look on his face my suspicions were true. He told me, "They'd put it out to kill a skunk that had been wandering around... I'm sorry."<br>  <br>  I became inconsolably upset; I was screaming, raving and crying. I was yelling for him to get the car, that we had to get my baby to the vet and get her better before it was too late. My brother kept trying to tell me that it /was/ too late, there was nothing they could do, but she seemed fine, like there was nothing wrong at all. Finally, I convinced him. <br>  <br>  I had no recollection of the car ride or turning Copper over to the vet. My dream skipped right to me in the waiting room.<br>  <br>  The vet walked out and shook his head. He told me that the only thing they could do was give her something to keep her out of pain. He began to trail into the idea of having her put down, but I cut in halfway and told him to put her to sleep as soon as possible; I didn't want to see her suffer. I had to do it fast or I would loose my nerve.<br>  <br>  Then I was holding her on the steel table, stroking her fur as the doctor slowly pushed the needle into her... And she didn't even look sick, like she could just get up and play with me... He pushed the plunger down and I woke up abruptly.<br>  <br>  I was sobbing when I opened my eyes, and Copper had curled up next to me, pawing at my face. She left a scratch mark; that was what woke me. I hugged her and cried for a bit longer. It had been one of the most realistic dreams of my life.<br>  <br>  This is 3 weeks after my ferret Papps was put down, bless his little heart.<br>  <br>  It was horrible...<br>  <br>  This is Copper: <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2048143/" rel="nofollow">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2048143/</a>|`|kbNxvsjzaa	i had a dream that a little girl came up to me asking me to help her because she got her period for the first time and her tummy was hurting her so i made her tea..<br>  <br>  i have so much weird dreams.. i always wake up feeling different..|`|tbB9IjNzaa	I had a dream that I had to study for a science test that was today.

76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	You forgot about one thing.  You can be sued.<br>  <br>  If you scare someone - especially an older person - they can sue you for emotional duress & damages.  <br>  <br>  If you destroy anything - even put a mark on a tree on someone's property - they can sue you for damages.<br>  <br>  If your friends get hurt on someone's property - and the owner finds out it was your idea, you can be sued.<br>  <br>  Boy, you will get your *** litigated against.  I worked for a reality TV show like Jackass, and they had several attorneys tied up all the time with their stunts.  If you do decide to go do something, at the very least - I suggest you have your buddies sign a injury release so, if they wind up going to the hospital, they suddenly don't turn against you and want You to pay for their medical costs.<br>  <br>  BTW - if one of your pals only has to check into an emergency room...and the medics DON'T find anything (like a bone fracture or a muscle contusion) - - that will still run you about $900, with the X-ray bill, blood panel (which is routine - you can't go to an emergency room and NOT have the folks there do a blood panel...they want to make sure they're not dealing with a hiv patient).<br>  <br>  So go ahead and have your little laugh. You may be in for one nice, big, surprise...and whatever it is, be assured a lawyer will be attached  to it.<br>  <br>  P.S.  By posting your question here, you've already given a court as much evidence as necessary to show premeditation...and that it was Your idea.  Dumpkopf.

3EquduFZaa	Jacob Black, most definitely. He's more healthy for Bella. She doesn't have to give up anything to be with him that she would to be with Edward (BreakingDawndoesnotexist), and he's just so much more genuine.<br>  <br>  Bella's love for Edward is that of a child with any shiny object (literally). It's more of an obsession, and she gets annoying with her inferiority complex. It's also very shallow; she always focuses on his scintillating chest, sweet breath and incandescent skin. Whereas with Jacob, she talks about how he actually makes her feel: always happy, makes her smile. He's her personal sun. Their love is so much more true and healthy.|`|wdXQaATDaa	Team Edward!|`|Y4RS35M7aa	I liked Jacob Black in "School of Rock"<br>  <br>  Oh, wait...|`|8oUIx5Uzaa	Edward Cullen!(duh)<br>  1.)

6mqAuBdFaa	My favorite would have to be Spider-Man.  When I was a kid, I enjoyd him solely because of how cool he was.  As I got older, I got to where I could identify with Peter Parker.  In fact, when I was forced to get glasses, reading Spider-Man made me feel like there had to be other people who could relate to what I was going through.  When I got picked on for my intelligence, I again took solace in reading Spider-Man.  I guess the reason I still enjoy Spider-Man is because he is so human.  He has to deal with our type of problems in his own life as well as the burdens of being a superhero.  He has fears, doubts, & concerns about what he is doing, just as many of us do.  Quite simply, he's one of us.|`|JbKerMCkaa	I had a big crush on Wonder woman and She ra.

S5uPFgoLaa	good points: it's got a nice ethnic flavour which I personally like a lot and in different quantity can work.<br>  But there's some points I don't like: it's too repetitive and it never takes off the ground. It makes me feel like a plane rolling, rolling, but never flying. Though the idea is nice it's too repetitive and apart from those few bars where the music varies a little it can be quite boring for that.<br>  Saying that, please don't feel discouraged, I think you can work a bit on it and make it more interesting, so people would feel like leaving their drinks and get up to dance. Try to work on it with this in mind.<br>  take care...I'm a nasty vocal coach in life so raise a smile anyway ;)|`|ngew4AWSaa	Yuck, electronica.<br>  <br>  It's not my kind of thing.

Especially if you have sensitive skin. It's COLD out there. My tummy was sore after the piercing and I had to wear low rise skirts and half shirts until it healed. (But I went for the double pierce with chain, so that might have been a contributing factor.) If you've waited since you were 12 you can at least wait until summer so you don't freeze. I'm not sure how cold it gets where you live, but I can absolutely guarantee you will not be happy with cold metal through a new  piercing, especially if something is rubbing on it, like the waistband of your pants/skirts.  Also it will not heal as quickly if it is constantly being irritated by your clothing.<br>  <br>  As far as your mum and the piercing itself - if she freaks, just judge how much she's freaking (to yourself) and plot from there. I know my mother almost had heart failure over my piercings and tats and told me I couldn't move back into her home ever, even if I was  dying in the snow and being stalked by wolves. She was that upset. She got over it, but it's something to keep in mind. Even if you have to wait until you're 18 - will she bounce you out of the house over it when you get it done? Can you support yourself if she does? You do have to keep that in mind as well, you know. <br>  <br>  If she's dead set against it, just learn to like delayed gratification. I've been on the waiting list for a Paul Booth tattoo for nearly a year now. (I've saved my entire upper back and left shoulder just for some ink from him!) I've got a bit more over a year to go. Patience is a virtue and if you want something bad enough, you are willing to wait for it. Makes it that much sweeter when you do get it.
qVXmSEVGaa	you betcha! There is a ton of literature out there ( literally as well as figuratively)<br>  For hard, good, no-nonsense reading, go straight to the top! The Structure of Singing, by Richard Miller.<br>  Singing, the Mechanism and the Technique, by Dr. William Vennard<br>  Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults, by Dr. James McKinney<br>  <br>  These are three at the top of my list of must-reads.  They are not easy to get through ( most theory of anything is not easy to read through, after all) but highly informative and worth the time.<br>  If you can find them at the nearest university music library, you will save yourself lots of money.  These books are available at your on-line bookstore, but they are very pricey.<br>  Please watch out for things that have "finding your real voice" or " an octave a week" somewhere in the title.  These techniques are usually flash-in-the-pan stuff, based on a few crumbs of actual vocal knowledge. Even pop singing technique is based on the old-fashioned classical singing technique that brought about opera, starting 400 years ago. If is was good enough for them then, and still turns out great singers today, there must be something to it, no?|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	you take singing lessons to improve<br>  <br>  music theory is placing the sharps and flats into the staff<br>  and how notes have value and rest<br>  <br>  Music theory year one - you learn all the rules<br>  Music theory year two - you break them all<br>  BUT - you have to learn learn to know what you're breaking<br>  <br>  all the best|`|lxfocaT7aa	If you've learnt, or are learning any instrument, try and relate it to singing. Anything at all would help. For example, I take piano lessons, but no vocal training, so this is all I can try to help you with; in piano, practice makes perfect, but of course don't stress yourself out too much, or else you'll get too stressed and strain yourself, and end up frustrated and tired.<br>  <br>  More theory would be analyzing your singing voice and technic. To improve yourself, obviously you have to try out certain songs or certain tunes, and see what you're poor in, and perhaps you can overcome it. Analyze your voice, and think of ways you can improve it. Another thing is you can try recording yourself; the best thing that most sites recommend. Beware though, you WILL sound different that what you sound like to yourself; this is because of your internal organs. So you will sound different, but the technic and tune will still be there, just e.g. if you sound mature to yourself, you might sound a lil' childish to others, like me.<br>  <br>  If you haven't learnt any instrument, maybe it'd be a good thing to start, which the basic like piano, with the theory, because though the theory will NOT be fun, it will help with your understanding better.<br>  <br>  Also, try your best to sing with your gut; diaphragm, and not too much of your throat, because that will strain it. Posture is important, because when you're standing straight with your shoulders back, your diaphragm will have the best advantage. And when you feel that your throat is painful, or getting dry, sore, etc, STOP. Drink water, rest a while.<br>  <br>  1. Don't drink cold water - I can't explain why properly<br>  2. Don't drink TOO much water at a time, because that will fill your stomach, and you can't sing well with a full stomach, like right after you've eaten right?<br>  <br>  Also, warm up first before singing, especially too high or too low notes. Start with the normal range first, and then move on, that will help.<br>  <br>  And if you're trying to sing a fast song, but just can't get it right, take it slow, maybe verse by verse properly, and pronounce or know the lyrics straight first, or it'll just be a jumble.<br>  <br>  Last but not least, PRONOUNCE your words. Sure, don't detach them too much, but pronounce them, so that listeners can actually hear and appreciate the words.|`|eda60a6a894beb349ddfd89a4c950beeaa	There are a lot of theories about what makes the voice "work".  Your teacher can explain all sorts of things, and demonstrate the ideas, so you get the theory side of it, but then you have to put this into practice.  I think every study of almost anything has a theoretical underpinning. It's what practical use you make of it that shows you the value.  Read about singing and technique, and biographies of famous singers, and you will find ideas to try out that work for your voice.|`|S5uPFgoLaa	sure..I think you mean singing technique. The best way is to have a coach, no suggestion on paper can be really applied if you don't have someone to show you how to sing and correct you along the way. By reading you may wide your horizons and get to understand a lot IN THEORY, which very likey you won't be able to apply in reality .<br>  <br>  Generally speaking a lot of people think that if you don't sing well, no singing technique can help. I disagree.<br>  Our body is a perfect machine made for singing, some people use it properly as they were born with the right posture and equipped with voice already sounding in the right place, but many have to learn their way to it. Voice is air after all transformed into sound, which changes its attitude along the way. We can learn how to master it in order to direct your breath exactly where you need to obtain different kind of sounds depending on what you are looking for.<br>  You'd be surprised to learn that many teachers think that breathing is the essential part of singing but it's just a a part of it, and breathing sometimes comes natural, especially if you're happy. You may have noticed that some days you seem to master your voice and some other you don't.<br>  It's really a complex matter and it requires time to learn it. I strongly disagree with the following:<br>  you were born with a voice or you weren't<br>  if you have a voice it shows, and with a couple of lessons you become a singer<br>  a good cd/internet course can give outstanding results<br>  <br>  Some peolpe have the  luck of having a voice ready for use but the most can achieve the same result with a solid technique.<br>  If you need more specific answers you can email me, this is only my general opinion on the matter

eda60a6a894beb349ddfd89a4c950beeaa	You don't say what kind of voice you have, its general range etc.  The low notes are produced by the same techniques as the high ones at the other end of the voice, just not so much pressure on the air flow.<br>  <br>  You have take care to choose songs in keys that suit you. Sometimes as little as a semitone up or down makes all the difference.  Trying to force out notes that aren't really there can cause damage to your voice.  You may feel that those lower notes really are there.  You need to discuss it with your teacher and work out a program that will help you find them.  The range of your voice will expand and shift in time. It will eventually find its own level.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are songs that I would dearly love to be able to sing, but know I never will be able to because they are just not quite right for my voice.

Telling "white" lies to control or to teach morals to children. Fables, stories, and religious myths tend to stick to the mind.<br>  <br>  As children get educated, they start to question and rightly so. The desire to learn how things really work kicks in.

I've always called it a hoover... (or a woo-woo, but that's just when I was little!)|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	While working as a janitor at a department store in Canton, Ohio, James Murray Spangler invented a portable electric vacuum cleaner. The vacuum cleaner's design was upright, and it used a cloth bag to collect the dirt that was vacuumed up. Spangler first tested his invention in 1907 and patented it after a number of modifications in 1908. He founded the Electric Suction Sweeper Company to manufacture his design.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, Spangler's invention became known as the Hoover vacuum cleaner. William H. "Boss" Hoover was married to Spangler's first cousin, who purchased one of Spangler's early models. Intrigued by the new machine, Hoover invested in Spangler's company. He eventually became president of the Electric Suction Sweeper Company. In 1922, Hoover renamed the company the Hoover Company. Under Hoover's direction, many improvements were made in the design of the vacuum cleaner, and new sales strategies were tested. The Hoover Company's headquarters were located in North Canton, Ohio. Hoover set up agreements with stores to become dealerships for the company. The dealer received a commission for each vacuum cleaner sold. In addition, customers were offered a free ten-day trial period to test the vacuum cleaner. This innovative marketing technique made the Hoover Company the largest vacuum cleaner manufacturer in the world. In addition, the company continued to develop innovative designs and additional attachments that made the vacuum cleaner even more appealing to consumers. Hoover produced the first changeable bags for vacuum cleaners as well as steam cleaners and self-propelled vacuums.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Vacuum is the correct word (verb).<br>   <br>  Hoover is a brand of vacuum cleaners, but it has been integrated into the language to the point that lots of Brits call it 'hoovering'.  <br>  <br>  In context, doing the 'hoovering' is the same as if we said 'I'm going to do some dysoning' sounds a bit silly doesn't it, and that's why some people have a bee in their bonnet about people saying hoovering.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	UM, I'M AMERICAN AND I'VE NEVER CALLED IT A "HOOVER"<br>  I THINK THAT MAY JUST BE A BRAND, BUT I'VE ALWAYS CALLED IT A VACUUM|`|Dl1J1Y9Haa	i call it a vacuum|`|PSk0zY5uaa	........ i call it vacuum cleaner

It is very complexed, which can cause boredom, much of the time spent doesn't really add to the movie.<br>  <br>  The sexual violence is very disturbing.  Most of it really depicts women as sex objects and being used as such.<br>  <br>  The movie's imagery is spectacular but I don't know if that can overcome the shortfalls of the movie.<br>  <br>  I would not recommend the movie to someone going to watch it with their parents, I also wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who isn't a die-hard fan.  I would wait until it comes on DVD where you can actually control the viewing.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	Dude, it's wrong to ask somebody else.

It's bizaare, but there is a huge list of what you must see a nurse for - like contraception, or skin complaints, or colds and flu etc, and you are only allowed to see a doctor if your complaint isn't on the list, but if it's any more serious than the list then I'd go to the hospital, so what on earth the doctor does all day is beyond me!|`|RoTLnFGZaa	Definitely the nurse, because the doctor is in and out, and always seems in such a rush.<br>  <br>  your name freaks me out man, wtf.|`|YE0baNYRaa	doctor|`|QEEweJUaaa	My doctor looks after me pretty good.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Neither of them  sadly|`|r8s5j6zOaa	the doctor he gets to examine my boobs|`|pYtnOnbDaa	The Nurse because she is the one that gives you 99% of your care...

AOZvz2dpaa	modern day rebel|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	In the December 1985 Rush Backstage Club newsletter, drummer and lyricist Neil Peart said: "Tom Sawyer was a collaboration between myself and Pye Dubois, an excellent lyricist who wrote the lyrics for Max Webster. His original lyrics were kind of a portrait of a modern day rebel, a free-spirited individualist striding through the world wide-eyed and purposeful. I added the themes of reconciling the boy and man in myself, and the difference between what people are and what others perceive them to be - namely me I guess."<br>  <br>  Ja, I googled it.

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Let me first preface this by saying I use my Blackberry almost exclusively for work.<br>  <br>  I delete messages that I won't have any need for in the future or messages with attachments I can not or will not view on my phone.<br>  <br>  When I am away from home I always use a holster for my Blackberry and my phone locks automatically when I put it in the holster. But I frequently lock it first.<br>  <br>  I almost never turn off my phone. Usually only when I'm having a problem.<br>  <br>  I don't save many messages. When I do, it's usually something like a confirmation number for a flight or some other information that I may need beyond the 30 days that messages are kept.<br>  <br>  The number of text messages I send in a day varies from day to day. As I said, I mainly use my Blackberry for work. Most of my text messaging is to communicate with my employees. I have all of them on a mailing list so I can send the same message to all at one shot. On days when I do this, it can be as many as 50 texts when you include the original and any back and forth. However, most days it's probably less than 10 texts. <br>  <br>  Even though you didn't ask, I'll add that I charge my phone every night even though the battery may only be 1/4 drained.|`|qhU3PDgfaa	Do you delete messages immediately after you read them? - yes i do !<br>  <br>  Do you always lock your keypad once you exit the menu? - my phone is a slide one...so when i slide it down, it locks automatically :D<br>  <br>  Do you ever turn off your phone? - on when it hangs.. <br>  <br>  What do you save on your archives? - nothing<br>  <br>  How many text messages do you send and receive everyday? - arnd 2 or 3 :D|`|AA10044768	Do you delete messages immediately after you read them?

FhKfyxWlaa	While I think its very cute that we're being painted as angelic creatures who would NEVER stray, I need to throw some reality into the mix. There are evolved Cancers who are secure with themselves, and extremely devoted to their partners and then there are the UN-evolved Cancers who can never have enough love and attention and who suffer from low self esteem.  The un-evolved type suffers from "Grass is Greener" syndrome, and will seek attention and affection elsewhere if they feel the tiniest bit slighted. What's worse, is that they are so manipulative and sneaky, you might not ever find out.  I am convinced this type of Cancer can get away with murder. Literally.|`|QhlEOI6iaa	No, cancers value family and home. Their partner is very important to them if they are in love. From the cancers that I've met they would end things with one person before moving to the next. I'm not sure how they would act if they are not in love with the person they are with.|`|AA10197672	Cancers are the 2nd signs after Scorpios that are known for being very loyal to their partner...|`|wqL84O8Naa	No not at all, Cancers are PLEASERS|`|r4skENXIaa	Cancer's aren't likely to cheat but any human born under this sign may suffer from emotional instability and lack of a creative outlet. Thus, when they don't have the money to keep their bellies full and their current partner is too demanding or doesn't fulfill their needs, you can bet your balls an insecure Cancer will be one of the first to venture for a new shell whether it be by cheating, flirting, etc. <br>  <br>  Cancer as a sign is not likely to cheat though. I'd say the Cancer Ascendants are the most faithful in the Zodiac.|`|8WajgMlGaa	With every aspect of my life, when I find something that I love and makes me happy, I stick with it for life, even after people try to tell me that it's passe, and this includes people as well, unless of course you double cross me and scar me emotionally, then you're out of my life for good!|`|15d1Ig0Haa	NO NO NO! Cancers do not like to cheat. They love a stable love life.|`|CG7DAJAxaa	A few cancers I know are not cheaters but, attention seekers.|`|3524bc3531ee6e0add243dab129bd851aa	no they are the cardneil water sighn. both of those influences make them less likely to cheat on their partners.|`|e5hY5c52aa	im a cancer, and i HATE cheating and cheaters!<br>  so no lol :)|`|EEo72vg6aa	its not true...|`|5M0FBU89aa	I'm a Cancer and I never cheated.<br>  <br>  My father was a Capricorn and he cheated on my mom.<br>  <br>  My mom was a Taurus and I think she cheated on my Dad (out of revenge) but I was very young - yes, it was the mailman.<br>  <br>  Leo's are the most likely to cheat, from what i heard and experienced.   Apologies to all faithful Leo's out there.|`|to6JW3yFaa	Marina is right.<br>  <br>  There are some Cancers out there whose attention wanders to other people because they arent getting the attention they want from their current partners. My bf's (Aqua) last gf (Cancer) cheated on him. And Im pretty sure it's cause she felt that he didnt care enough about her... and he DID it's just that Aquas have a hard time expressing it. So yeah... some Cancer's definately do cheat if they feel they're not being loved.
zfslaO95aa	Because the IRA are simply cowards who profit from human suffering. They profited from the troubles and dont really care if the north is reunited with the south they just want to make money. N Ireland will only ever be united with the south through political resolution only, the IRA now this but they simply dont care.|`|JYw3hRV8aa	I am from ROI and reviewing the history of the IRA tells me that Northern Ireland will never be cojoined with us. I have no problem with this but it is The Britishs' fault for the troubles in that they drew the border without much thought|`|b23ac589c655b9f48a90e2fb2ffe9f58aa	they will get somthing but the british will make sure they will not get every thing even after 100 years|`|OtN6da6uaa	I don't know if stuff like this is necessarily about succeeding as far a getting Britain to surrender Northern Ireland--  I think that it is more about being heard and drawing attention to themselves, the situation, etc.  They are successful in accomplishing that.

In most states the till 10th the syllabus difficulty is in the order - state < cbse < icse ...for 11,12 cbse and icsc are pretty similar.<br>  I've a friend in maharashtra who said the state board portions was pretty comparable to what was taught in the cbse<br>  If you plan to join a coll within the state later on and if they give importance to board marks, then you may want to join state board as it is relatively easier to score there.<br>  Or if you want to get into reputed colleges like NITs in/outside maharashtra based on the AIEEE exam, you may prefer cbse (/icsc) as it follows the cbse syllabus.|`|AA12397532	Even though College education is Pune is excellent - No wonder it is known as Oxford and Cambridge of India - surprisingly its school education leaves much to be desired. Though it has world class colleges and institutes, no world class scools. In the long run, whether it is ICSE or CBSE or state, it does not make much of a difference.

What changed was what radio stations play and your maturity level.|`|1qUokeKOaa	it started to suck wen wayne found t-pain<br>  wen wayne sold a million<br>  wen soulja boy came of the internet and in to the mainstream<br>  it aint dead but the quality aint wat used to be|`|t2evcVVEaa	may 3rd 1999.not really. but rap and rnb did die out in the late 90's. and garbage like lil wayne and soulja boy are just making matters worse. i should know. im a record producer for Geffen|`|zzmIAOhFaa	it always suked|`|CofT1t1aaa	when people started rapping about stupid crap that in no way happened.|`|b11d4406389c926e8457572221d6ce48aa	when you grew up.|`|jJHRAyERaa	It never did. It started to move on from the old stuff to this new stuff. There are still some really talented rappers from the old gen. and this new gen. <br>  <br>  Anyone who says hip-hop is dying doesn't know hip-hop. Like I said, I say its evolving and moving on.<br>  <br>  Peace :)|`|yoVF60ORaa	'97...Biggie died, and Master P's "make em say uhhhh" (possibly the worst song u will ever hear <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jykg9jDI6T8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jykg9jDI6...</a> ) topped hip hop charts|`|ZTMxpjahaa	Whenever it started to get too commercialized and rappers started rapping about their cars and gold chains etc. rather than real stuff from the streets. Still some good stuff about though. Check out Common|`|vBcadgYPaa	Only mainstream (radio) hip-hop sucks, but it didn't start so far back as your saying. It would have started to decline at least in 03 or 04|`|0Dx3pBVEaa	wheneva the message stopped playing by grandmaster flash|`|oP3V6Ka1aa	In the new millenium|`|ONgtFWlCaa	after 1999.   and wheb lil wayne n all them south dudes became big n started useing atotune.|`|Rm1zxWQmaa	This crap was never any good.

l8djUFdDaa	Well we dont personally know any celebs..And if they do display good behavior it isnt talked about because bad behaved celebs on the front page sells more magazines. Would you rather read about: Dakota Fanning getting a role in twilight or Paris Hilton partying 5 nights in a row?|`|mZcdC90Uaa	I think Gwen Stefani has good behaviour, but I don't know her personally so I wouldn't know. I also haven't seen anything really bad about her. The tabloids may post things about her having a kid, but that isn't a crime. <br>  Stefani|`|WOKbYTe5aa	we'll never know, as the media doesn't print stories about good celebrities behavior

So forget about seeing this movie now.  You'll have to wait. It should begin to appear online within 1-2 days after coming out.
ZJkwz1B5aa	Interesting.  You focus on atmosphere rather than dialogue.  I think more person interaction.......|`|URjwNyYraa	It's good, i would cut back on the "i" and the "me"<br>  <br>  i would suggest writing one for a third person or a different perspective  i think it would sound  a lot better that is just my shallow opinion take it for what it's worth<br>  <br>  the first answer has  apoint though, you don't want to go over board with the detail<br>  <br>  ((( She slowly awoke from another painful nights sleep. The dry leaves crunched underneath her as she gradually got up off the hard ground, shaded by the trees above.))) <br>  <br>  nice story :)|`|zLUk9YyCaa	You need to catch their attention at the beginning or else the readers won't bother to read the whole thing. edit: to the person who gave me a thumbs down, I was being honest. That's how it works when they pick out stories to publish(they look for the captivation at the beginning).<br>  <br>  Also, too many details throw the reader into not being interested. Perhaps try to snip out some of the unnecessary ones.<br>  <br>  I liked your concept though, with the con artist :) and the kind of moral at the end.<br>  <br>  (sorry if I was being harsh)|`|gQtbwpyCaa	aww thts gd :)

r30KO1K5aa	Try what I used to do - have a little sleep first, just for an hour or so (don't forget to set your alarm). You'll feel as though you've slept for a lot longer than that. After a shower you should feel refreshed and ready to write for a long time, and you might not even feel the need to sleep again before class.|`|73KnE9Kmaa	now little girl. go to your chemists and buy some - Pro-plus tabs . there very good just 2 in the morning keeps you alert more. and your allowed them. now what you waiting for get on your bike heehee........?|`|uqLUKbMbaa	Splash your face with cold water.  Open a window.  But how come you are doing the essays now?  Shouldn't these have been finished earlier, like yesterday perhaps?  If you do stay awake until 5 am, you will doubtless fall asleep tomorrow in class.  I wish I could help you more...|`|dCMi5rjdaa	when i worked the night shift i always found tea helped me stay awake.....<br>  <br>  other than that......hmmmm...loud music is probably outta the question....if not, then that might work too...a little harder to concentrate(?maybe?)<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|7nRom97Daa	cold shower & a pot of strong coffee works well for me|`|jVW32D0jaa	a lot of coffee|`|eCZtVCwaaa	Take off all your clothes. It is nearly impossible to go to sleep when you are freezing...<br>  <br>  <br>  edit; cheri h recommended a cold shower, that is good although don't go in the shower and then change your mind and have a hot shower because a hot shower will make you really sleepy when your blood temperature drops back down..|`|f3ZKyuq0aa	Loud music<br>  <br>  and sleepiness would go away|`|DucgF5fraa	Listen music with your mp3-player|`|XQ5VMNTeaa	drink coffee....|`|jLT7kpKIaa	yes|`|uJrHmAKDaa	drugs<br>  try speed|`|xwZV9jgPaa	how about no doze?|`|jaOEtAHKaa	U go sleep .. i ll do ur essays !!!!!|`|KdzFxCynaa	coffee lots of coffee :}
g7M1DxFCaa	Unless the rocks are going to hit the Earth or cause anything else unpleasant to happen then they're clearly not going to have any effect on anybody.  However, some people will believe anything.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Not all rocks, just some of them. When it comes to size after Mars, there are at least eight more "rocks" in the solar system that are larger than Pluto. Only two are used, our moon and Mercury. But vastly smaller objects such as asteroids and comets (Chiron) do get used. How do astrologers know they work? They don't. They believe and that is what you have for astrology to be of use.<br>  <br>  Your computer monitor has more radiation and gravity influence than any planet.<br>  <br>  If it's not science, it's superstition.<br>  <br>  Edit: Read up about gravity and tides before associating them with fortune telling. Tides only effect open bodies of water not the fluid in plant and animal cells. Here is a good link that explains the tidal forces.<br>  <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/planets.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/pla...</a><br>  <br>  To the ones that ask for an "open mind" please answer this. Where does astrology clearly succeed to do better than chance? Or better than simpler and more likely alternatives? <br>  <br>  Does your open mind even consider other possibilities or is it locked to astrology? Being open minded works both ways. You have to be open minded that you maybe mistaken or wrong. Evidence is needed for the extraordinary, not wishful thinking. Astrology IS extraordinary, can this be agreed?<br>  <br>  Million bucks still waiting for the first person to prove anything astrology. How about you Melissa? Ready to make money for the cause?<br>  <a href="http://www.skepdic.com/randi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skepdic.com/randi.html</a>|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	Well if the Moon can affect the tides and animals then why is it so hard to believe that the planets can affect us?|`|WvpG9Omyaa	Some people will believe the sky is green if you tell them that it is.<br>  <br>  They are gullible idiots.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	For the same reason they believe in gods.<br>  They're afraid of life and death.|`|94b09dc893fe23fd5d972ad2cf5381aaaa	Well, if you are open-minded and do research before coming to an assumption, astrology is too accurate to be coincidence. Astrology is actually very complex and many aren't able to comprehend it.<br>  <br>  Many people hear a small part of it, decide it's too weird for their taste being their natural personality, and never look into it forward. Their opinion is just that, an opinion based on arrogance and not facts.<br>  <br>  Then they call people that have an understanding of it gullible. I call them narrow-minded, self-righteous and uninterested in human psyche.<br>  <br>  My I.Q. is 132. I have done a great deal of research on astrology and observations of people and it has never proved me wrong when calculated accurately from the correct sources.<br>  <br>  Horoscopes are predictions based on a generalization of the sun sign and are usually wrong since they've been turned into some silly entertainment pages made up by people who are and aren't real astrologers.<br>  <br>  If you don't like it and don't KNOW anything about it- you are not entitled to bash it and the people who do.|`|J9g1fKS2aa	everything in this world have the connection with each other, that's why our future somewhat have the connection with "rocks moving in outer space"<br>  <br>  read more about horoscope and you'll understand why! Horoscope is not trash or stupid stuff!|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Snowflake guy:<br>  <br>   Snowflake perpendicularity is well known and completely understood by science. If you did not pay attention in science class you CANNOT fill in the blanks with mythology!<br>  <br>   Melissa said: "Astrology is actually very complex and many aren't able to comprehend it."<br>  <br>   What? Like every one of the world's scientists that are alive or have ever lived? Everybody with IQs that make you look dumb? It is NOT a science, it is NOT taught in university, NO organisation ANYWHERE in the world uses it.<br>  <br>   But YOU understand it right? and everyone ELSE is wrong?<br>  <br>   Complete fruitcake.......|`|LGFa6CKsaa	Actually it's called astrology. It's based on same science as astronomy yet astrology tries to find answers to worlds processes by positions of planets and aspects they make with each others and their movements. Anyway it's more about energy of universe and cosmic fate.|`|pyHF4eYJaa	They believe that everything in the universe in interconnected by an unseen web or force. Not such a bad idea, actually, when you think about it.|`|vdmqdlNfaa	Because people are ignorant / gullible and insecure.<br>  <br>  They always need to hide behind some religion or believes because they are scared.|`|91nAPOLtaa	yeah! seriously!|`|4zVi6gvgaa	I'm glad there's at least one other person on Y!A who thinks that...|`|n683LtZhaa	A lot of older cultures who believed that the stars were gods and that the alignments and positions could predict the future or the state of things has not completely been forgotten.  Now they just call it horoscopes and some people think it helps describe personalities or events.  Its really an outdated religion that some people think is cool.|`|owYyT0AUaa	its just like another form of religion really, guess you've just got to have faith in whatever nonsense you believe in order to believe it! Though i'm on your side, how could they affect anything. And how can any one star sign accurately represent the lives of a 12th of the people on the planet? Its poppy ****!!|`|LJfAhlJ6aa	Because some people are desperate to find out who they are. Having someone tell them that their character is more like this and more like that, and this star system gives them the urge to act silly, or foolishly makes one feel more at ease with himself, more 'figured-out'.<br>  <br>  this industry flourishes from the need to 'know-oneself' and that's the trickiest thing of all a guess.|`|onlUAadeaa	Its just silly.They are looking for some sort of entertainment that obviously isnt true.well thats in my opinion|`|mD7eAAoNaa	What's it you, just let them believe in whatever they want. If you don't believe in Astrology then I don't see how you should be concerned with it. The only reason as to why people don't believe in astrology is because they are in denial and cannot accept the truth. To sum it up, all astrology really is personality analysis according to planetary movements. I don't see what is so wrong about agreeing with it.

PD85QwlJaa	Good Luck.<br>  <br>  It takes money to do things right. It's not so much the software but the hardware. You need good mic's you need proper mic placement and you need a good soundcard.<br>  <br>  Save your pennies and by a fourtrack or eighttrack that records to wav.<br>  <br>  Usually cheap systems only allow you to record two tracks at once.<br>  Record the drums first alone, record the guitar afterwards then finally the vocals.

She was a friend of my mother . She told me that a man was standing behind me with his hand on my shoulder and described my father to the T. She also told me that an elderly gentleman wants me to warn his grandchild not to get into a white van with some of his friends, she gave the date everything. I warned him , told him what was said, he did not listen and crashed the works van and got killed. So i don't know what to believe anymore, that really happened and it was quite scary.|`|1044e6d5b5224a0e60d20aab5815ba06aa	yes and i have to say disappointing.she got kind of freaked out and not in the usual your going to meet a stranger sort of way.|`|XjFxlcIlaa	I've seen several over the years - even found the ring that my Grandmother had left me when she died 20 years ago :-) I've had several messages from those who have passed over.

I got lymes disease from it and had to relearn to walk again. It was terrible.|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	Yes and the best way to remove a tick is to pull it off gently.  You can do this by using blunt curved tweezers.  Grasp the tick as close to the skin surface as possible and pull upward with a steady, even pressure  Do not twist or jerk the tick.  Pull firmly enough to lift the skin and hold for 3- minutes.  This will cause the tick to release.  If you get sick, see the doctor immediately as ticks carry bacteria.|`|PD1WpoEsaa	no, luckly! even living around all these Georgia pines!|`|r8s5j6zOaa	I thought I was, can I check you for ticks|`|DP8mnHIraa	no but mt old dog was <br>  and i found it to late <br>  i lost him to it <br>  that was 3 years ago<br>  x x x|`|LpZXuTVCaa	pay no mind we can check each other|`|a1pmr73vaa	hell no..not even a real penis..lol

She may have died from a malfunctioning heart valve or brain aneurysm or any number of things. It was revealed that she died suddenly because she was in the midst of writing out a grocery list and she had been out shopping for a new couch--so it wasn't cancer, most likely. She didn't die in a car accident with her car because her car was shown in-tack.

Tickets cost $5 and fewer than 250 people attended. The whole ceremony lasted only 15 minutes. Unlike later events, the winners had been announced months prior to the ceremony. This was also the only Academy Award ceremony not to be broadcast in some way.<br>  <br>  Unlike later ceremonies, awards could be granted to an actor or director for multiple works within a year. Emil Jannings, for example, was given the Best Actor award for his work in both The Way of All Flesh and The Last Command.

2af2455d375bfc99be9ccdfe3994a47caa	That's one of the most famous of all SNL skits, consistently making it onto all-time-favorite lists. The group that's being satirized, Blue Oyster Cult, had a big hit with that song ("Don't Fear the Reaper"). It is beautifully produced and it does feature a cowbell. Considering I don't usually like "death rock" songs, that particular song is terrific.<br>  <br>  The "Cowbell" skit is very funny and there's nothing particularly in bad taste about it. There's no inside smutty humor or hidden put-downs.<br>  <br>  My all-time-fave SNL skit is the the "Schweddy Balls" routine, featuring Alec Baldwin. It never fails to have me in tears.|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	Classic.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-AdxjDGioc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-AdxjDGi...</a>|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	It would probably be funnier to me if I knew the people involved.

e7KoyoWsaa	mason, you do have a talent for expression, there is no doubt about it.  You have a way of putting things that lets things out that seem to be trapped in you.<br>  <br>  As far as lyrics go - they need to be highly revised.  Song traditionally hold a certain pattern which yours seems to ignore.  You've put numbers on different verses (i assume that's what you think they are) but they are of different lengths.  There is no chorus, there is no bridge.   If I were to take these lyrics and make a song out it, I would really need to edit it.<br>  <br>  It's poetry you have, and if your asking if you can pursue this as a career, i would say no.  Do it cause you love it, even take some collage level courses.  If your trying to be a lyricist you should probably read a little on music composition.|`|N38ZnBxXaa	yeah its nice ^^<br>  the first verse is very well written it rhymes but not to the point where it sounds all cheery.<br>  awesome, keep it up ^^|`|ucOsOq76aa	great! loved it!

It'll be really hard but i know u can do it.<br>  First of all, feeding is the most important. Warning: it eats A LOT. about... 0lb of cheeseburgers, 0kg of pepperoni pizza, 0l of coke, and 0t of hot dogs. NEVER feed it dirt. thats what happened to the other one.<br>  <br>  Next, it needs attention. give it lots of love, like a second each year. unlike most pets, it loves leashes, especially ones of its favorite color, with its name on it.<br>  <br>  Finally, (which was supposed to be the first one), is naming. Chose wisely, since rocks hate their owners if they don't like their names, but they always use the first one. Luckily, my 267th pet rock liked the name Rocky.<br>  <br>  Good Luck~!|`|1IVEYMA9aa	I have had many pet rocks in my lifetime. They are difficult creatures to take care of. First i would advise you to never leave your pet rock alone. They can be quite sneaky. If you treat it nice, maybe it will befriend you and you will not have any problems. Give it treats every time it does what you want. If you do this, it may stick around for you long enough to miss it. Good luck with the training!!!!!!|`|xcI4RXsfaa	A rock can be a very difficult pet to manage. They need to be fed 6 times a day in moderation. When you feed them be sure to not pet them as they do not like to be touched when being fed. Also and this is the most important, DO NOT FEED THEM AFTER MIDNIGHT! If you do bad things will happen.|`|XBgDFXfRaa	Hey I have a pet rock ! Maybe they can be friends :)<br>  Well you have to feed it daily and take it on 10 walks a day and pet it a lot so it will lurvvv you so much it can't run away ! My rocks fave food is popcorn maybe yours will like it !<br>  ( By the way whats your rocks name ? Mines bob :) )<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is a joke by the way im not mad :)|`|oC8U5Bl5aa	when it rains cats and dogs<br>  what to feed him? all the chocolate chip cookies he wants<br>  where? in front of the tv watching SpongeBob<br>  how? to care for him, all the TLC he needs|`|MFAMzb6waa	your pet rock ran away, it has no legs, you were incapable of looking after a rock|`|AA11969873	Tonight<br>  Dirty nasty rock<br>  Outside in your moms backyard<br>  Crouch down and dig|`|kHLwlNA5aa	You left out who & under what circumstances.|`|NYwoG13Haa	Lock it up|`|K8NWUKiFaa	oh dear me|`|lQaRKIOOaa	u must have asked WHY ?|`|FxvZmBGBaa	well... put it on a lead! lol x|`|rDsKB0uXaa	this ain't a poll|`|kwMA5I1iaa	The When, What, Where, and How of your new pet rock! <br>  <br>  When it doesn't move, you need to rush it to the animal hospital as it may be depressed...<br>  <br>  What you feed it is salt...lots and lots of salt...<br>  <br>  Where you need to walk it is in the gravel...so it can be with it's own.<br>  <br>  How you put it to sleep is by singing to it. <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|4YnoykD2aa	WHEN your PET ROCK runs AWAY, bring it back, and PUT ANOTHER ROCK ON TOP to prevent escape. Gender ID them though or you run the risk of baby pet rocks.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	keep it on a leash  and it won't run away|`|2DK4QoV9aa	LOL|`|5eoO6qosaa	When you have a pet rock, remember that you don't own it, it owns you.<br>  What ever you do, remember to let it take daily visits to the rock garden - it likes to visit family.<br>  Where it likes to sit during the day should be sunny. <br>  How you make it love you is to let it take showers with you.<br>  Remember not to train it to be a fighting rock, it will just chip away at it's solidness.<br>  Do remember to paint eyes on it so it can see you and know you by sight.<br>  Don't dress it up like some people do to their dogs. Although it does like to dress up for Halloween.<br>  Last but not least, get it a friend to keep it company while you are away from the house.<br>  Good Luck with your new pet, love it and it will love you back! :)|`|XAAF7R23aa	put it in a large  tank, with sand and plants, and give it a scorpion to play with, make sure it has  a warm environment and play rocknroll., never fails. and no one will touch it cause the scorpion will sting em, rocks hate being mucked about with,|`|jeLehwmpaa	well if you dont want it to run away then dont throw it when you get mad  :)|`|EiX4L2xQaa	well you have to teach this one just take a hammer and hit it a few time it will not run away after that|`|JwnHKTabaa	hug it and kiss it and call it Fredrick.|`|HuhI1IlJaa	now<br>  rock<br>  soil<br>  pet it|`|njlBV9Enaa	You are a very lonely boy.

You'll recognize me as I'll be the nekkid girl wearing a strand of lights.|`|87CAVhs2aa	Well, the lights go around the llama's neck... And the twelve-pack well, if I can have a 12-pack of Root Beer (You know I don't drink alcohol!) and then... Me and Winston (the llama) would have some fun. Maybe invite some friends over for a party.|`|y5FfKGAsaa	Make a story/play about a llama with the twelve pack and use the lights for dramatic effect?<br>  Haha|`|6UlOorwMaa	have some friends over to help drink the twelve pack while watching the llama string the lights up on the house|`|pHteEAF8aa	Make a corona commercial.|`|6y5wgdmHaa	Paaaaaaaartaaaaayyyyyy!|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	decorate the llama..split the beer with ''her'' and show ''her'' how we human males can light up ''her'' lights|`|v0Bk9fWGaa	Smoke em and there not dope woo hoo~]|`|CqcEhI2Kaa	Well 6 for me 6 for the Llama (Who I names Steve)<br>  Then I tie up all the lights making a bridle for Steve, and I get a car battery and Jerry-rig the lights to work. Then I'm taking a ride round town. <br>  <br>  Pedestrians beware, drunk llamas tend to speed, and drunk people can't drive lol.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	the only thing is missing in this equation is the weather. then i can answer this one. where i live its like -20 at one time then it can be 90 degrees at any other time in the summer. Depends on what the weather is.|`|9DjMGv5Uaa	Make pizza out of the llama(or alpaca-there is actually such a thing in Peru.)<br>  Have the pizza with the 12 pack.<br>  Put up the string of lights.<br>  Have a pizza party.|`|13G7AxsRaa	Have the llama drink the twelve pack, pt the lights on the llama, use a long extension cord and ride it down the street.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	+be a pack of kamel cigarettes maybe <br>  <br>  not Camel  but them cheapo Kamel ones|`|2734495ebe0db7825a50002a0b17e3edaa	Duuuuuuude!

However, my hair is only shoulder length so the strand of lights will come in very handy wrapped around my tiny bits. Hey..... at least they'll still twinkle IF you know what I mean. I'll just ride that llama all over town waving and blowing kisses. As for the 12 pack you say? pfffffffffffft........ you didn't seriously think I'd dare do this sober did you? *wink*<br>  <br>  Ciao!|`|y9GsC7ogaa	Throw away the lights, drink the twelve pack, and ride the llama to the store to get more beer.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	Get MacGyver to make me a nuclear reactor.|`|4GCH1lTyaa	put the lights in a big circle..and play spin the beer bottle|`|6ik7OJRNaa	...I would post a ..confusing question about it, here, just like you  did..... xx

Rm1zxWQmaa	Both are awesome shows,but if I had to pick it would be 24. The Jack Bauer character is the best.Poor guy can never get a break.|`|5e07813cce25cc51bdab8ac80e59c66faa	Prison Break most definitely! 24 was just all over and the whole clock ticking thing was just soooo annoying! And the guys on prison break are much hotter!|`|hYMoWedlaa	prison break|`|aKvxy3xBaa	We are Prison Break Fans in my house.|`|YscdxQQQaa	24<br>  is way better|`|OWXI806qaa	(Note: This answer is partly for people who are trying to decide which one to watch)<br>  <br>  I've seen Prison Break, & it is a pretty cool show. It's got some good<br>  plot lines & good action.<br>  <br>  But out of all the TV shows I've seen, I can honestly say that 24 is<br>  the best, most awesome drama I've ever seen. -EVER!<br>  <br>  I know that you'll get a lot of responses to this question,<br>  but this is the answer that you need to listen to.<br>  Trust me! 24 is awesome!<br>  <br>  It has everything that you could ever want in a TV show.<br>  Drama, action, some romance, suspense & really good plot lines.<br>  But I will warn you, it's addictive. I love it 'cause there are so many<br>  twists & turns that you never saw coming. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you know anything about it, but it's all <br>  in real time. Each season is one day. Each episode is one hour.<br>  There are 24 episodes in a season. They are curently airing the<br>  seventh season now.<br>  <br>  It's basically about fighting terrorism & about a really awesome main <br>  character named Jack Bauer.<br>  He's like my favorite super hero ever.<br>  (even though he doesn't technically have super powers, but<br>  sometimes I wonder. lol)<br>  See this link <a href="http://24.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Bauer" rel="nofollow">http://24.wikia.com/wiki/Jack_Bauer</a><br>  <br>  But it's not the kind of show where you can just start watching <br>  at any point & still know what's going on.<br>  You have to start from the beginning, or at least the beginning<br>  of a season. <br>  And the first season is good, but don't judge the<br>  whole show just by the first season. <br>  Keep going after that. (If you start there)<br>  It comes on Monday nights on fox.<br>  <br>  After you've seen a few seasons, (if it takes that long)<br>  You won't ever like anything as much. I guarantee.<br>  <br>  I hope I could help, & I hope I convinced you.<br>  And if you ever have any questions about it, you can email me<br>  via my profile. I know EVERTHING about 24, & I always try to answer<br>  questions about it as best I can.<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking.<br>  (See links below)|`|ANOvR67Gaa	Prison Break
PIjCNYQNaa	It's totally possible. It just depends on the other aspects the planets make in your chart. Go to <a href="http://www.alabe.com/freechart/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alabe.com/freechart/</a> and enter your time and place of birth, and they'll whip up an excellent chart based entirely on you, with explanations and everything.|`|dibBENqWaa	yeah. it's possible.|`|CmxJdPh2aa	i would say its more like layers of an onion, for the most part. <br>  though your rising sign will indicate your prominent planet in your chart. how prominent it is depends on the rest of your chart and aspects in it...but it can give you an idea of where a lot of inner focus is throughout your life. <br>  example: my rising sign is CANCER...ruling planet of cancer is MOON...my moon is in pisces and the pisces IS much too prominent for my leo sun to allow to shine publicly....but on the inside my pisces moon rules my life-somewhat...especially combined with my moody/crabby cancer rising. <br>  <br>  i feel like the epitome of "walking contradiction"

EzrciMgXaa	popular music never appealed to me, i listen to whatever is NOT popular at the moment, like thrash metal, ska, street punk, hardcore punk, death metal, crustpunk, post punk, 80s new wave, old school reggae, psychedelic trance, dark trance, classic rock, psychedelic rock, etc.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	yes and no<br>  some bands can be so good that people don't care the leads are ugly, especially when the presentation of the band is mainly the vocalist and song aspects<br>  some bands rise to popularity because of a singer, and may be mediocre<br>  however sometimes the singers have both and are equally talented|`|ObeBvtzgaa	Miss Brit beat me to it lol =( I was going to name the Jonas Brothers.<br>  Yes, I think a lot of the popular music of today has a lot to do with looks and appearances of the bands. The Jonas Brothers are the PERFECT example. I bet if the Jonas Brothers were ugly then they wouldn't even be popular (at all).<br>  Kind of sad how so many people today judge bands by looks when that's irrelevant = /|`|qSwaXLBeaa	I don't think it matters much on appearance at all. You don't exactly know what they look like when you buy the single and listen to their music LOL. 'Oh she's pretty, I'll buy her single' I don't think many people think that way, or anything similar at all. Actually, some of my friends do that which I think is quite pathetic. Obviously it will affect how popular you are if you look like a total ugly mess, but it doesn't matter too much.|`|XO4talxxaa	Yeah i don't think they would be so popular if they wern't so cute! I am not agreeing i don't think they are cute but i think that is what helps them with fans!<br>  <br>  <br>  I just turn on the radio or tv and i just listen if i like it, it isn't because of how they look! lol|`|7HCcGlkxaa	Noooo way.<br>  Why do you think music videos exist? Do you see any popular songs that have meaningful videos like TOOL of Nine Inch Nails?<br>  <br>  Noooo!<br>  It's all about exploiting your appearance and fans.|`|GVf1Ho7haa	todays music=superficial=sad    <br>  (its pretty obvious why the joe hoes are famous)<br>  =(|`|QeIs4zgPaa	I think I get what you're saying, bands like "The Jonas Brothers' are DEFINITELY more popular because they have good-looking singers.  I think it's even a little unfair- There are some really awesome singers out there in the world, and the only reason they're not famous is because they don't have a pretty face.  So yeah, I think that if Hanna Montana was ugly, she wouldn't be as popular.  Same goes to My Chemical Romance, it seems like the only reason girls like them is because Gerard Way is 'Hot'.  We live in a crazy world; where sadly, a beautiful face and body is everything.<br>  <br>  (I think I'm making less sense than you ;P I mean, you made perfectly good sense, but I'm just... being random.  I hope YOU can understand ME =D)|`|7HJ4kWB8aa	a lot of "pop" acts are all about theyre looks or theyre image is important to their success but i would say that more rock or alternative bands are about the music<br>  <br>  i think it depends which kind of music..<br>  if compare olden day bands like backstreet boys<br>  to current popular acts such as kings of leon theres a big image difference!|`|t6k3yoNdaa	Well, I hate to judge but "We The Kings" none of the singers are that good looking but their still good. But, I understand your qusetions and agree. Why do so many girls love the Jonas Brothers? Cause they think their cute! And their not. I just listen to music that is great and gets me going.|`|tM1wHAfYaa	Well yeah! Have you seen half of the bands that are playing nowadays its ridiculous! So many cute people but bad music! Take the Jonas Brothers as an in example they are HOT! but have terrible music.|`|37qOjwDraa	Yes, especially if the fans are girls (and gays), bands like Fall Out Boy (who has Pete Wentz as their "hottie".)<br>  <br>  The opposite is Iggy Pop. He's really an exception.|`|vFkh9LQ9aa	Hmm, cuteness helps but I think that the singing is much more important for most people.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	isn't it obvious? look at all the pop singers|`|900dc227c54816ae25676c1cd50ab0edaa	even though Framing Hanley is my favorite band and I hate to say says because I think they are amazing I dont think they would have as many fans without Lollipop and les girl fans without Nixon (seriously go on one of there videos on youtube all you see is girls saying how hot he is)
4SGBr8cWaa	umm, yeah, to chicago, & i'm also a member of the on the tracks club|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	It was the only way most of us had to travel any distances during the War years. The trains were often crowded with troops and their kit and it didn't make for a comfortable ride if you had to stand in the corridors for several hours. Few people had cars and most of those had no petrol to run them; petrol was reserved for essential services only - transport vehicles were allowed a ration of red stained petrol, doctors had their allowance of petrol coupons.<br>  We go on the Severn Valley Railway (steam train) from Kidderminster to Bridgnorth and back about once a year; it's a good way to meet with friends because you can relax and chat, have lunch on board (not haut cuisine!) and see lovely scenery through the river valley.|`|4rdKpvPGaa	Yes i think i did|`|K8NWUKiFaa	Yes, trains take you from place to place....|`|2JIkzC1baa	YEAH I ben on a train ride it was soooooooooo exicting|`|89ff8fa4f5283b5a62c3ea573df41106aa	Yeah!|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Well yeah|`|cYsPx9sSaa	Yep|`|ufdFei1jaa	Yes I have.|`|curz3Gxtaa	i have, but not in a sexual way..lol|`|qtmC05Tzaa	loads of times! lol|`|XPaLYdobaa	only to weeks ago,i nearly got caught.|`|8dhe15MUaa	i used to do over 29000 mile a year by train|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Of course i have.i am the fat controller|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Yep lots of times|`|wmBK9uASaa	Yes I worked for British Rail for 14 years....|`|eiEdUWNbaa	No, but I would like to.|`|FxvZmBGBaa	yeah...|`|t5NLfSmAaa	I ride on trains all the time!

FT1jKZ8paa	fave- the Amber's they are happy and bubbly i can't stand people who bring you down all the time.<br>  <br>  least fave- Ailea she has issues she needs help lol<br>  <br>  Ashley- she looks like a drag queen and swears like shes hot!|`|672Wl59Paa	I like Tiffany and Sara because they seem more real and stand their ground.  I think Whitney tries to hard to be a bad ***, Ailea is also trying way too hard to be a mean girl, and Ashley is just a fake ****.<br>  The Ambers are another story, I think what they did to Amber (short hair) is wrong and messed up, and I think that the other Amber (long hair) is being attacked because of the other Amber.  But they both need a good butt kicking.|`|Qd3sjE3raa	Tiffany she is more real and doesnt care about the other girls <br>  i hate the ambers cause they are bitches and hoes. its funny whenever i watched the new episode yesterday! haha whenever the fab 5 put tape and gummy bears all over there **** haha<br>  i think ailea is kind of a confused hoe.. cause she likes fazil physically and she like kevin ew..|`|RAatxTeSaa	I like them all but i like tiffani more! I cant stand the ambers! there so annoying|`|T9hEUqRtaa	i also like tiffany she says what she feels and she like is real she doesn't care what anyone says she she isn't fake and stuff and my least favorite is Aliea because shes so fake all she does iss talk about everyone she needs to stop and go away!<br>  <a href="http://nyrangerhockey.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/bgc-badgirlsclubblog22928.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://nyrangerhockey.files.wordpress.co...</a>|`|m7lJgAcraa	my favorite would have to be whitney...shes really funny & although she needs to loosen up i still lof her.<br>  i hate ailea (who doesnt) ashley, sara, tiffany. theyre jealous & if they hate the ambers so much why do they care if they dont hang out with them? its hella dumb they're all the ugliest on the show too.|`|J48UJBlsaa	my favorite is probably the amber with the longer hair..and my least is ashley..she is a skank|`|WOOKNMgmaa	...|`|D3Fyxj0raa	i love sarah my least favorite is the Amber's there so childish and annoying|`|2FNfyxVqaa	My favorite would have to be Tiffani. I choose her because I feel she is real, she is not a follower and she can defend herself if it comes down to it. I also think she's the prettiest.<br>  My least favorite would have to be Aliea. She's just annoying and has low self-esteem and she's pointless.

YNuyXl1waa	That Myspace page is a fake. Charmed ended due to dropping ratings, production budget cuts that The WB forced the producers to take for Season 8 (bothered to notice that the Charmed Ones were supposedly killed off at the end of the previous season only to assume new identities in the same house in S8) and the show's actors were just being burned out.|`|YIcBd569aa	no need to check the link, the answer is no. long time fans of the show know this because of the way the show went out. the actors did not want to return for another season. it ended years ago.|`|fLPhGgH7aa	the show ended a couple of years ago, it ended at season 8. so there will be no season 9.|`|ex1Kuy1caa	no

Y1aAGPURaa	LOL!!!    Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  One day my mother was out and my dad was looking after me. <br>  <br>  I was maybe 2 1/2 years old and had just recovered from a bad cold. Someone had given me a little tea set as a get-well gift and it was one of my favorite toys. <br>  <br>  Dad was in the living room engrossed in the evening news when I brought Daddy a little cup of "tea," which was just water.  After several cups of tea and lots of praise for such good tea, my mom came home.<br>  <br>  Dad made her wait in the living room to watch me bring him a cup of tea. ("It's just the cutest thing!") My mom waited and sure enough, I came down the hall with a cup of tea for Daddy. She watched him drink it, then said (as only a mother would)..."Did it ever occur to you that the only place she can reach to get water is from the toilet?"|`|RgbARcJTaa	hahahahahahah<br>  THAts a good one
LLNlyaFaaa	yes it's possible b/c i was looking up some astro love match stuff and libra's and gemini's are the best match ever!!! so yes you can be together !!!|`|gUUtGcbBaa	i dont know why people keep saying geminis are two faced, they are not two faced, they just have two sides, two personalities, two in one, but they are not fake....they are just double, cant make up their minds, but they are actually one of the most helpful signs there are, and are always willing to help and are also very gullible and naive at times. also very smart, and quick witted, thats why they are "Two faced" because they have opposite qualities that contradict themselves.<br>  <br>  gemini and libra get along great! although libra should make up their mind more cause the are both undecisev..<br>  Ooh and also i agree with the kid who wrote above me<br>  what a gemini want is a person like aquarius who is gonna show them attention and then take it all away, gemini are like kids they need decipline, and love, just like kid, and also they need to learn a lesson day by day just like kids<br>  <br>  so play hard to get that wouldnt be bad:P|`|WY8B3NWdaa	im with a libra and i am a gemini. it will be 4 years in June. It all depends on the individuals. It takes a lot of hard work!! (but that is with any relationship.) <br>  Never go to bed angry, and always say i love you when you separate!!|`|ntef2sPMaa	i'm not sure|`|CYyVD0ADaa	I have the most amazing relationship with a Gemini male at the moment, I am Libra.<br>  <br>  Despite what people say about them being two faced, I personally have never seen that other side of them...<br>  <br>  I find them easy to get along with, I also LOVE to cuddle up with my Gem lad and listen to him chatting while i close my eyes and hold onto him...I think Geminis are romantic in those ways without realizing, they don't need to put on a show to prove they care about you. <br>  <br>  You need to understand Geminis are very independent and wont appreciate being tied down or made to stick to routine, they don't like the feel of entrapment.. <br>  <br>  <br>  By the way I can help you more, if you tell me if you are the Gemini or the Libra?...<br>  <br>  <br>  Lance... I am Libra and yes we both have are flaws but we have made it through, because our charts make both of us determined people.<br>  Yes I agree Geminis are COMPLEX to the max, but after you've figured out the walking deff talking puzzle it's worth it :)<br>  <br>  happy libra.<br>  <br>  <br>  "so play hard to get that wouldnt be bad:P"<br>  I'm sorry for quoting this lol!<br>  But honestly dont play hard to get, I tryed it with my Gemini lad he got seriously bored of the game haha.<br>  Geminis would much rather be chased.|`|gwQwwW3xaa	ok wats a libra and gemini?? some 1 e-mail me wat it is plz|`|0H9dvXkmaa	no|`|UBNEzh0Saa	Yes.  A very good combination.|`|AA11946996	Sure, why not? It depends more on the person and less of the sign because their are other signs that make up the whole person. I'm a Gemini Married to a Cancer. If you look at our sun signs then you would gather that we are not compatible for the long term. My sun sign is Gemini, Venus in Cancer and Moon in Pieces. My wife's sun sign is Cancer, Venus in Gemini and Moon in Cancer. If you think that a Gemini and Cancer won't work because of the sun signs then maybe take a closer look at the surrounding signs. We have been together going on 7 yrs and Married going on 5. When we met we just clicked. For anyone out there that says it won't work really doesn't know what they are talking about because everybody is different. If they seriously think they know all then PLEASE ask them for the next lottery numbers! Then you can gauge if they really know what they are talking about.

6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	I very much enjoyed it.  I'd recommend it!<br>  <br>  Then again, I'd also recommend that you read the graphic novel upon which the film is based so that you can develop a better understanding and deeper appreciation for the story, the characters, the message, etc.<br>  <br>  Besides, I think it'll be far less confusing/easier to follow if you've read the graphic novel first.|`|cf64157ac10119178090cc78fd234a19aa	I thought Watchmen was really funny.<br>  It also helps if you've read the graphic novel on which it's based on.|`|Ta7snyIoaa	I liked it.

39OVFs5Raa	When you are tired of sitting in front of your television watching reruns or listening to music on the radio, here are some things you can do:<br>  <br>  Inspect your House - If you are really desperate, then this will keep you busy for several hours. Check pipes and the roof for leaks, windows and doors for cracks, or clean your house. You might want to clean the air conditioner, repair electrical wiring, or anything else that needs attention in your home. <br>  <br>  Get a Pet or Play with your Pet - This is the main purpose of a pet: to provide you with company and entertainment. If you have a dog, go out and play fetch or go for a nice long walk. If you are a cat person, get a ball of yarn or your laser pointer and play with your cat. If you notice your pet is smelly, you might as well give it a nice bath. Chasing your pet to give it a bath might even get rid of your boredom instantly. <br>  Engage in a Hobby - A lot of people today engage in hobbies, especially the DIY-types. You can create simple items that can either be practical or for display purposes. There are many sources and ideas for home projects you can do by yourself. Just decide what interests you. If you are the handyman around the house, look for DIY projects on making furniture or home accessories. If you love electronics, build yourself a computer rig out of some spare parts. There are countless things you can do. Of course, the project you will do will take some time to complete, keeping you busy for several boring weekends. When you are finally done, go find another thing to do.<br>  <br>  Invite Friends Over - Now, if nothing above appeals to you, then pick up that phone and call some of your friends to come over. Who knows? They might be dead bored too. Tell your friends to bring some movies, music, or anything that can keep you guys busy the whole day!!!.|`|MrLdBraoaa	Youtube<br>  Video Games<br>  Search some jokes on google<br>  Watch Pure Pwnage!<br>  Stay on Yahoo!

aC0wBzQEaa	Your like how most actors and singers start out very bad though your a trainable person. Though I'm serious the most famous entertainers if you look and listen at their early work haven't developed some talents that would later make them millions. So you have a chance get trained however.|`|560f03427fe698cc7d7014011e59a1a8aa	Your singings great but no.|`|0mKz9S9iaa	omg!! ur amazinggggggg|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	There's no way to tell.  There are hundreds of thousands of aspiring singers with great voices who want the same thing.  You have to work hard and sing every chance you get, in school, in plays, etc. etc.|`|NjES0qXNaa	YUP!!!!:)|`|ByxEE8eeaa	You're definitely on the right track. You sound like you have been trained, and the fact that you started your first lesson is an excellent step. Even if you never sing 'on Broadway', I'm sure you can enjoy yourself singing in some big productions, as long as you can act as well. Don't forget the acting!|`|Qnop8tkjaa	As of right now, I don't think so.<br>  <br>  But it is very close. I think with the training that you'll be getting, you'll make it. Good luck, chica!|`|MsLKIJWJaa	it will be hard work and your voice reminds me of kristine chenoweth from wicked... try singing one of her songs.

bTt2Bo2oaa	It could be about battling everyday crime and problems, like drug trafficking, theft, murder, and rape. you could make the person use their wit, reflexes, and strength, which any one can have without super powers.  you could make the main character something many people can relate to, like a father with teenagers, and he has to try and protect them from dangers of everyday life, meanwhile he has to protect the world.<br>  <br>  Oh crap im sorry this is a bit like Batman. well anyway i hoped this helps.|`|XQMm3Ahraa	well you could have the story about a cop who is trying to defend his city from unlikely events such as a war being held there or a gang rebellion unlikely stuff that would never happen|`|AA10784260	sorry most of the good ideas have already been used try something else

Especially if you have kids.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	they are alright considering i am one what about the husbands|`|GT6396BDaa	Housewives work very hard.  I think they are often under appreciated for all the work they do everyday, plus they do not get paid.  Plus, they don't just work a 9-5 hour work day.  It's more like a 24 hour a day job.  They cook, clean, do the grocery shopping, run the kids to school and activities, etc..<br>  People need to realize just how hard a housewife works for their family and home.  Be proud to be a housewife.|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	If you have kids, that's fine. But if you don't, I think you should get a life.

And it is a job.  Studies have shown that stay at home moms (which is a housewife with children haha) would earn $500,000.00 in the real world for the jobs they do.|`|FeRC5jkoaa	They like young pool boys.|`|CphIBXMaaa	They're Great as long as they belong to someone else!|`|JwnHKTabaa	It's kind of a whatever thing.<br>  Do whatcha wanna do.|`|hzQDocWaaa	if they want to than than can be housewives|`|4SGBr8cWaa	love em, how about house husbands, cuz i'm one right now|`|ACc1skbPaa	I am one and a mom and my opinion is that for me, right now it is the right choice.  I don't begrudge anyone who goes to work and leaves their child with care other than their own---I am lucky and grateful that I had the choice and I am happy with the choice.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about the show, I love Atlanta and NYC and think Vicki and Tamra on RH of Orange County are two of the most pathetic women I have ever seen on a television show! =)|`|oeXnhiPWaa	There's nothing wrong with being a housewife, but I don't think I would be happy with being one. I think I would just need to work, I mean I plan to open up my own Business so, that's agiven (I don't mean to imply that housewives do no work - organizing your own and your families lives must be rather stressful).|`|t0KTJr8xaa	My mother did the housewife thing and was miserable. She's doing it again, and she's miserable (I told her not to "retire")<br>  Personally, I think that being a housewife would suck, and from the ex and current housewives I know, I really can't bring myself to praise them. HOWEVER, I realize perfectly well that cooking and cleaning and wiping butts all day, every day isn't easy, so I can't exactly disrespect them. Especially when the alternative is going to work, then coming home to work. Women with a job outside the home still have a job inside the home.|`|u6YpiCg9aa	Housewives are amazing. They are full-time mothers. They gave up their work (if they had one before) just to stay take care of the kids and house. Its not a very easy job. Kids should be proud that their Moms are Housewives and the should feel lucky that they have the full attention and love from their mothers. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|uSep1sTXaa	Eh, the common stereotype for housewives is that they are to cook, clean, and take care of everyone. But personally, I think they should use it as their alone time to take care of themselves. Screw stereotypes!|`|ntef2sPMaa	well called me old fashion but we need more housewifes. guys should be the one bringing the bate home. all we should do is cook, clean, care for our family and all that sort of stuff. but one woman stood up one day and said, why dont we work, why dont we go to college. that woman screwed us all.|`|2hMhANqDaa	nothings wrong with that, my mom is a housewife with kids and taking care of them along with cleaning and cooking is a full time job.

And what about healers?  Why aren't they walking the halls of hospitals healing people?<br>  <br>  Yes, I sometimes have dejavu, but I know it's just my brain playing tricks with me.  Yes, I sometimes think of someone and they'll call me, but I know it's just coincidence.

Well Bale was pissed because he was distracted by the guy walking back and forth. He told him already to stop then he flipped. The rant can be found online, it is hilarious! There is a part where he Bale calls the guy "a nice guy" and then starts yelling at him again. He asks the guy if he would like him to wreck his lights, "No? Then why are you ruining my scene!" People have forgotten that he was arrested for a domestic problem in England with his mother and sister. What a temper!

7b3e55f1520292b18d56fea36b36fdccaa	Because it is mostly an Asian oriented style. So the characters usually embody those characteristics|`|3N2ElzcQaa	The reason is because the creators are japanese based.<br>  <br>  There are some African characters in:<br>  <br>  Black Lagoon<br>  Bleach<br>  Tenjo Tenge<br>  Afro Samurai|`|cidwIuJRaa	You know....I have pondered this as well.....<br>  But,I can only ever think of a few black anime charas,period.....<br>  Yoruichi on Bleach and then Samuel L. Jackson's Afro Samurai and the little boy on DBZ.<br>  <br>  And,that's kinda sad.<br>  In America,we have *The Boondocks*,which is an animation of African-Americans.<br>  In Japan,they only have a few black charas at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another thing that is weird is that most anime charas look like they are white.<br>  But,Japanese pplz are not white....so that is weird,too.|`|Hiasgb75aa	Black anime? It doesn't make any sense really, but I guess you are referring to alot of black people in Anime and Manga. If thats the case my guess would be that Japanese people aren't really in touch with pure black culture. That's why you'd find more white or asian people. There are black people in Anime though|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	Because They are Asian Art Works.  Why not create your own African Avatar works.  You may create the next big thing.  My point is to not complain or change what is there but make room for yours.|`|N8AJnAbuaa	yes there is <br>  The Boondocks|`|P6xuhlgTaa	First animés come from asia and especially japan and they usually talk about themselves first. There is black japanese coming from okinawa isles and living in the main island but when there are drawned people only find them tainted(like the detective rival of conan in case closed) and not blacks. Its the Ozaka type in animés in general. Some modern animés are drawing  these japanese black better recently like tokyo tribe but they are still asian first <br>  Its easy to fastly deduce they are  racist even if a bit true and in a polite way knowning japan as a european who lived in Tokyo . A country which is pretty closed and is hating even others asiatics like can't bearing openning frontiers to chinese/korean nurses for their hospitals needs, where mixed children are called half and not double, where you keep the mention "alien" for generations on your id card, where its hard to rent money if you don't have strong relations, where white foreigners living there for 20 years are still laughed at by schoogirls finding them pinky and hairy in the bus(they think you can't understand japanese as a white^^), and where people get out of water when you enter a public hotsprings(must be the d..k complex i used to claim loudly to my brother to get heard ) but the first reason is economic<br>  <br>  Economic cause its very hard for a mangaka to suceed in this world. Around 0,1% chance for people with talents and trying for years to just have a 3 chapter contract and a lot have been dumped by magazines fastly even after a first contract. A manga magazine also forced himself to drop mangakas all 6 monthes even if they have a little success to make room for newbies...Magazines aren't extensibles and need new blood <br>  <br>  Too make short when a mangaka start being serialsed he needs minimum 2 years success to get in an animé and this animé need minimum 1 year success to get out of Japan or Korea. Thats why non hero blacks characters usually appear after chapter 100(=2years) in manga (chap 131 for bleach or chap 400+ for naruto for example) cause these mangakas start to think and draw for a world public and not only japan. Trying to do it from beginning is like suicide for them and some tried in the past and never succeed<br>  <br>  On another hand the storyline can make the hero or the support character black from the beginning like in Nadia or Michiko to Hatchin but these animés have small success and aren't well knowned. Michiko from Hatchin is a 2009 new serie still airing actually with a hot black female hero so support by buying the dvd^^<a href="http://moetron.com/newfiles/20080818_michiko_resize.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://moetron.com/newfiles/20080818_mic...</a><br>  <br>  There is a lot of the black characters from chapter 1 that will usually appear if the storyline is international or not in asia or give them a reason to exist as a black like a we have examples with stories in brazilia, a girl trying to get back in  africa, non asiatic mafias story,  sport story like baseball/boxing/ football/soccer/brazilian martial art, a musical/fashion story like Nana, a realist space story etc..<br>  But its the same for a white european, he will need a specific storyline like fantasy, medieval, angel/demons  story to appear white from chapter 1<br>  <br>  Animés are starting to have really some world success now so we have 2 new tendencies now. <br>  1 We have others countries copying the manga style and dropping the comic style like boondocks for Us: the problem is there are mainly all blacks in this animé no latino or asiatic so its still the same error than asians did. <br>  There is also others countries with mixed population, good studios and a market to sell these animés like UK and France doing the same: in the starting characters you ll find a white,a black and an arab but no asian^^ . <br>  2 And we have commands like Afroman.One of the most known black hero Afroman is in fact an american command for his market looking for a black hero. Afroman manga is from 80'sand from a japanese but the manga only get around 10 chapters and didn't find success in japan so get drop with poor ratings.So his mangaka just draw another manga without a black hero to have a chance living from his work before having afroman being noticed 15 years laters^^|`|uxd8rmLxaa	If you watch bleach theres quite a few black people<br>  example being Yourichi, Chad, Tousen <br>  <br>  oh and boondocks <br>  but anime is basically japanese I don't think they'd make a proper black manga but would include some blacks in their manga<br>  I hate it when they make us look bad in mangas too like if you watched dragonball z and you see mr.po po wtf with that <br>  they may start making some in future as most of them are begining to adapt to our culture|`|LcSwDbr4aa	There's Afro Samurai<br>  and the episode 'Mushroom Hunting' of Cowboy Bebop had African characters<br>  Tenjho Tenge has the Black Character Bob Takahara<br>  Eureka 7 has Mathieu<br>  Cyborg 009 had a black cyborg character<br>  Bleach has a Black Shimigami<br>  <br>  I think overall though, it's a price issue, since it would be more expensive to make a manga with several characters that would require additional shading (more time required for the art, and more ink spent to color).|`|k4iehRa8aa	Thats what I've been thinking. -_-<br>  But its made in Japan, with asians. Not America where we're all mixed.<br>  <br>  Everyone's forgetting Nadia!<br>  She's like, my idle!|`|KSC02NcLaa	Tokyo Tribe 2 : <a href="http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4308" rel="nofollow">http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?sho...</a>|`|CPObbqfsaa	Japanese create most.. thats why their of lighter skins..<br>  <br>  but youll probably get just as many hits if you type Black Anime as if you typed White Anime|`|JiOhZ0Bgaa	:O Thats is actually a really good point<br>  <br>  Never come across any :S|`|nBaRuZ5xaa	because the world is mean like that hunny<br>  wish it wasn't. its hard i know. =(

They are both incredible bands<br>  <br>  Not a big fan of the Puscifer stuff|`|7HCcGlkxaa	Oh...<br>  This is hard. <br>  I would have to say A perfect circle.<br>  <br>  Puscifer is great, but I happen to be an industrial fan.|`|DjF6Uytuaa	Tool is better.|`|vFkh9LQ9aa	A perfect circle, deffo|`|YKSF6aoraa	A Perfect Circle.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	I've only heard one A Perfect Circle song, but I know a fair amount of Tool's songs, so I'll go with them.|`|Vu4A83dyaa	A Perfect Circle! <br>  <br>  Puscifer is amazing!!!

They have no skill, look gay, sound gay, act gay, and look like hyenas. I don't see what the big hype is about them. They're some suckish Disney Channel boy band that will fade in a couple of years because one will outshine the other 2. They should do the world a favor and stop playing music.

39OVFs5Raa	The egg!  The question has not specified chicken egg! It could be a dinosaur egg, dinosaur have been around for millions of years much longer than chickens!!!.|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	the egg.|`|VykkX7TEaa	You can't get an egg without a chicken, you can't get a chicken without and egg :p|`|vD5ysjwraa	The chicken.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It 'evolved'|`|AA12074512	chicken|`|Ul5NFGNkaa	The egg. Dinosaurs laid eggs|`|P9vPjQAtaa	This question appears regularly in the question file, so let's take a shot at it.<br>  <br>  In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote.<br>  <br>  Chickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken.<br>  <br>  Prior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. SO THE EGG MUST HAVE COME FIRST!|`|dg3qC9dLaa	It was the egg.<br>  <br>  The riddle comes from the chicken being needed to lay the egg... but assuming we evolved from single celled organisms then we also mutated at intervals. The chicken came from the egg which came from something that mutated into a chicken.<br>  <br>  Although I prefer the answer of the chicken.... because the egg couldn't cross the road.|`|21g5bHfvaa	The egg, something similar to a chicken layed the egg producing the chicken we know of now.|`|fn4MRRkKaa	Egg as reptiles also lay eggs which were around millions of years before birds:)|`|VrHlujwuaa	The Chicken From Evolution|`|EcNneP5Caa	it doesn't matter. they both taste delicious

I got it for PS2 about two (probably more) years ago for no more than $25.  I'm sure now that the PS3 is out, The Simpsons Hit and Run is considered "primitive" due to the fact that it's played on an "old" machine.<br>  <br>  That having been said, it's probably in the "Greatest Hits" section at the end of the video game aisle for no more than $20 (could be a little less...like $18.97 or something)

The John Carpenter version of The Thing from the late 1980s is also great but more gross and violent (and actually much closer to the original short story).<br>  <br>  Occasionally they show It - The Terror From Beyond Space which is also from the 1950s. The special effects are a little cheezy, but it is basically the movie that inspired the classic Alien. A rescue mission goes to Mars (in the far distant future - 1972!) to investigate the recent mission that crash landed and finds one survivor whom they arrest, thinking he had killed his shipmates to hoard all of the supplies. On the return trip, however, members of the crew start to turn up dead. The movie shows that NASA in the 1950s was definitely still being run by Curtis LeMay (who firebombed Japan into almost extinction). They go on a rescue mission in a pressurized space ship - with a bazooka!<br>  <br>  I just recently re-watched Shadow of the Vampire which is a movie about the making of the famous silent movie Nosferatu in the 1920s with John Malkovich as the director and Willem Defoe playing the part of a vampire playing the part of an actor playing the part of a vampire. When the vampire kills the cameraman, Malkovich yells and demands "Why couldn't you have killed the script girl?" To which the vampire responds "I do not think you require the writer any longer?" When Malkovich finally confesses to the producer that the lead actor is really a vampire, the producer wants to know what the director had to promise to the vampire. "I promised him eternal life. And Greta." Also, Eddie Izzard in a very rare dramatic role.|`|T38lIQ8Gaa	The Lost Room was a little-heard-of but damned good mini-series.

uD1S5dYtaa	The way to overcome an opposition is to compromise.  Find the midpoint between the two planets involved, The solution is that planet or house as a mode of change.  Its difficult but oppositions come to strong people and make us even stronger.  Is there a square in there somewhere, so that you have a T square?  In that case the release point is opposite the square.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	Oppositions are truly more important when there is another person involved. Opposites attract. There may be challenges to overcome, and since we all have challenges in our personal make-up, like being a perfectionist. That would mean you would be required to compromise and not insist on everything being done in a certain way.<br>  <br>  Oppositions in your own chart simply mean that the planets say one thing, and your spirit says another. It's a tug of war between your outer personality, your inner self, your emotions and how you combine them to create the YOU that everyone else knows.

You need someone who can give equal resistance so you don't run her over. Although Virgo can have this quality, she'll probably get tired of your power plays quickly. (I'm Virgo, my mom's an Aries, and we have Issues.) Pisces? I don't know. You're the first sign and Pisces is the last sign, which means she'll be very intuitive. Could work out well. I would look into a Leo, maybe; that's one of the happiest signs.

I don't know if other Sagittarius are like this, but I did read a lot about my birth chart and it explained that my rising sign which is "Capricorn" gives me an earthly sense of humor even in the most serious and hard times. It was dead on and I totally agree! I think that coupled with the fact that I have 3 other planets in Sagittarius makes me a bit more playful when times are serious. I'm a very optimistic person and that most definitely comes from all the Sagittarius influence in me. Don't get me wrong I do have times where I can get down and depressed depending on what the situation is, but for the most part I can handle stress and hard times pretty well.

Capricorn is supposedly 'emotionally detached.' Water signs are usually said to be emotional, and Cancers are 'crabby.' Aquarius are workaholoics. Libras are flirts.|`|DjJwKc9Caa	gemini- 2 faced<br>  taurus- boring<br>  leo- egostical<br>  cancer- judgemental<br>  pisces- too emotional<br>  sagittarius- blunt<br>  capricorn- fatalistic<br>  scorpio- secretive<br>  aquarius- weird<br>  libra- sarcastic<br>  virgo- perfectionist<br>  aries- egostical|`|ak610Npjaa	that we taurus over eat and are fat... so not true|`|AA10400874	Lots of stereotypes:<br>  <br>  Aries stereotype:  They will always pick a fight and have a tendency to light things on fire. <br>  While it's true that Aries like to be winners, they aren't always so hostile, and I have yet to see any Aries set anything aflame.<br>  <br>  Taurus stereotype:  They don't leave the couch.<br>  Yes, I've met some Taureans that like to just stay home and not go out, but every so often, you can get one to get up and go.<br>  <br>  Gemini stereotype:  They're two-faced.<br>  Some are, but I find this in other signs as well.  Also, I've met plenty of Gems who are true-blue.<br>  <br>  Cancer stereotype:  They're moody.<br>  Kinda have to agree on this one.  Most of the Cancers I've met are moody, but there's usually some reason deep down of why they are.  It just takes a while to find it.<br>  <br>  Leo stereotype:  They are full of themselves.<br>  Some are quite full of themselves (the men mainly).  And yes, they do like to be the divas of the show, but at the same time, they are pretty good at admitting their flaws, if they truly have that flaw.<br>  <br>  Virgo stereotype:  They have OCD.<br>  My sister is the only one I know who's like this (she even color-codes her M&Ms).  Others I've met have had it do a degree but not anymore than others.  They just have their way of doing things and like to keep it that way.<br>  <br>  Libra stereotype:  They are gold-diggers.<br>  Some Libras I've met, to an extent, are, but I'm a Libra.  All you have to do is meet any of my exes to know that this stereotype is not true of all Libras.<br>  <br>  Scorpio stereotype:  All they care about is sex.<br>  Scorpios can be very caring and have a lot of things that are important to them.  Yes, sex is important to them, but it doesn't completely consume them.<br>  <br>  Sagittarius stereotype:  They put their foots in their mouth.<br>  Some Sags I've met are truly classy and know what to say and when to say it.  Other Sags I've met are very guilty of this stereotype.  Good thing it's hard to embarass a Sag.<br>  <br>  Capricorn stereotype:  They will walk over you to succeed.  <br>  Caps are very ambitious and want to be the most successful they can be.  This has caused some Caps to be a bit ruthless.  Still, I've met many Caps that have gotten their success in good, kind, hard-working ways, without hurting anyone to get where they are.<br>  <br>  Aquarius stereotype:  They have no emotions.<br>  To an extent.  When it comes to mushy-gushy romantic love, this sign isn't the most emotional.  But Aquarians can get mad and huffy at times, and then they show that emotion.<br>  <br>  Pisces stereotype:  They live in a fantasy land.<br>  Yes, they do have dreams and want to live in a happy, fantasical land, but most I've met, know how to get their heads out of the clouds and do what they need to do in the real world.<br>  <br>  Generally, the stereotypes are mildly true, but again, everything varies from person to person.|`|40LtlYXOaa	you have a TC badge on the horoscopes and you don't know the stereotypes for each sign? not only that, you don't even know if there are any.|`|AA11245783	someone told me that aries aren't considered to be caring in a relationship<br>  <br>  so WRONG|`|7rrNvFK7aa	If you read the posts here, 9 out of 10 posts are stereo-typed for every signs as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  libra sign|`|QsVMeaPXaa	If you  must believe in astrology...sigh...just google Astrological personality types.|`|ixHwF4apaa	may be

6JnAOYCYaa	Hello<br>  <br>  Not usually, phone psychics have a set rate. & all are tested before they start - so all have to be at a set standard. <br>  <br>  Although I would be concerned that you spoke to 3 as I presume that you also had 3 readings.<br>  <br>  I worked on a psychic phone like for over a year & that is there only draw back, people can have multiple readings which means that they are not listening to what is given.<br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|32P3hG0Laa	You are better off finding a professional psychic locally, who can give you a list of satisfied clients, instead of a phone psychic.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	Always be careful talking to 'psychics' on the phone. Genuine Psychics do exist, but they are rare.|`|AA10923010	How much are you spending monthly on Psychics? <br>  <br>  Im sure you could get the same advice here on Yahoo for a few minutes from anyone <br>  <br>  Beware of so called psychics.|`|1BF8UMjRaa	have u ever talked to a psychic that doesnt claim to be TOP?|`|lKbt97YQaa	there is a way to prove to yourself that these psychics are scamming you,just wait till they answer and say tell me my name and if they can't then they are frauds,there are however a lot of people who think of some thing and it happens,like a song in your head ,then the song starts to play on tv or radio or when the phone is about to ring and you look at it or think about the person who's calling and sure enough it will be them,i have had this experience far too often and i wish i could control it but it seems to happen when i am not trying,you just have to be aware that your doing it,it makes me think that we were all here before and this life keeps happening over and over with slight changes,when these changes occur ,you feel a sense of Deja Vu,but then again that just sounds nutt's too.a more solid idea is that our brains can predict random outcomes on a subliminal level,there is a computer program that does that kinda well,i think its called the prediction hub,oh yea,that other person was right in saying be careful talking to these psychics as most are very good at making people believe their lies.they are not usually all that clever though.<br>  watch out for sneaky people,a liar will always look down to the left as lies use the fantasy part of the brain and when they lie they cannot stop themselves from looking down to the left,a good liar does this so fast that it is hard to notice,it takes about a tenth of a second for the eyes to do this,simply looking down to the left for a long time is imagination use and not always a lie but the fast  flick down to the left is a definite lie,i have tried this a lot and it never fails.'GOOD LUCK'|`|7It5ORAyaa	No offense, but psychics only want your money.<br>  They ramble on about stuff that may or not be related to you life, and if it coincidentally ends up being right you flip out and believe everything they say to you.<br>  <br>  It's all a load of crap.<br>  <br>  save some money, eh?|`|dJyR1p2faa	These are con artists.|`|rAa8bfhwaa	the first one

rFBypeEfaa	Oh, my god, you've chosen an album with which it's going to be really, really difficult to choose a favorite track. And, of course, it's by far my favorite Iced Earth release.<br>  <br>  First, my background with this album:<br>  My first Iced Earth purchase (based on the CD store guy's recommendation "I see you buying all this Maiden and thrash stuff in here all the time, kid, and there's this band Iced Earth that you should definitely check out. Here, they just released this, it's a good place to start." To which teenage me said "Uh, ok. <buys immediately upon seeing the front cover>") was Days of Purgatory. BINGO, a perfect blend of the three bands whose back catalogues I had been mining at stores and listening to constantly (Metallica, Megadeth, and Iron Maiden), with plenty of new ideas thrown in. Admittedly, I often prefer Nevermore, who I hit a little later, but that compilation introduced me to a fabulous band. <br>  <br>  Cut to 4 years later, when I'm on the best vacation I've ever had in my life, visiting at age 21 for two weeks with some of my cousins in southern Germany. The trip overall was awesome (with so much good beer!), but the point being: I had brought so much music with me for the trip, and I ended up needing none of it. Because the first day there, like any metal fan would do, I hit a German CD store. And, among other things, I bought this album (In the ultra-cool European book-bound limited edition version). And I popped it in my discman, and it stayed there for the entire f*cking two weeks. Because it's that goddamn good. And then some. Forget the 72-CD wallet I had packed with me, all full of death, thrash, black, and power metal, this thing had all I needed for the trip and beyond. I listened, and listened, and listened, and it just got better, and better, and better. I even loved "Ghost of the Revolution," and I had NOT yet fully discovered that slow music could be good. (Now, I'm well aware, but I was a total ADD kid/young adult)<br>  <br>  That being the case, choosing a favorite off this album is damn near impossible. "Damien" comes to mind first, so I'll go with that, though I *love* the energy of "Jack," and Barlow's soaring vocals on "Dracula," and especially the overall feel of "The Phantom Opera Ghost," which proves yet again (following the earlier effort by the band they covered here) that they really should have gotten a committee of heavy metal songwriters together to make the musical of that story, rather than that Andrew Lloyd Webber hack...<br>  <br>  As for this album's place, it certainly cemented the Iced Earth legacy for anyone who might have had any lingering doubts by that point, and I think it would have catapulted them into being *the* name in metal for the following decade had Barlow not taken his leave right afterward. <br>  (Owens, as he always seems to find himself, is a perfectly capable vocalist, but he wasn't going to satisfy and keep 100% of the fans who were beyond fired up after this Barlow-centric master-f*cking-piece. See also: Painkiller)<br>  <br>  In general, I think that this album showed the metal world that the "power metal concept album" didn't have to be what its reputation dictates (that being, to most people, a string of non-distinctive Melodic/Heavy alternating songs going through some obviously well-thought-out but quite often ridiculous story, with a cheesy quasi-classical overture and a general lack of ability to be digested by people who weren't already big fans of the band who produced it.) Instead, every single one of these songs matters, and is bad-*ss on its own merits. Every one of them could be a hit, if we were in a world where Power Metal can top the charts (I live in the US, not Brazil...)<br>  <br>  Jon & co. put every ounce of necessary effort and then some into every song, and by doing so, they showed that they could take a format that's been quite frankly abused by so many, and make something exciting, cool, and in many ways new. It's a fabulous example that many, many more artists should be following, for the overall good of the genre, and metal in general.<br>  <br>  Excellent, excellent choice, KP!!!! <br>  (Could you tell I was excited when I saw it???)|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Great album dude!!! I love Iced Earth, and most power metal for that matter. Iced Earth is probably my third favorite power metal band, behind Kamelot and Blind Guardian.<br>  <br>  I may not be into Frankenstein and all of that but the whole concept part of the album is very cool!<br>  I think it is possibly the greatest concept album in metal. Nostradamus does give it a run for its money though! (Joking obviously! =P). <br>  <br>  I think it's just another really positive step for power metal. I think the genre is looked down upon by a lot of people, even though it really doesn't deserve to be! People see it as just being cheesy and Iced Earth found a way to make this album about old horror movies and NOT make it cheesy for the most part which is pretty amazing to me.<br>  <br>  My favorite song on this is probably "Damien" with a close second being "Dracula".<br>  <br>  <br>  Great pick for this question!!|`|QhJ8YiLhaa	Would you be suprised if I told you that I have this album? <br>  <br>  I love the track Damien!! It's probably my favorite Iced Earth song ever!<br>  <br>  I'm going to go find the CD now!! Nice job pointing this out, Peachy!!!!|`|IBvz3tckaa	i like Iced Earth but to me thats not one of their better albums. my pesonal fave is Burnt Offerings.|`|37qOjwDraa	Dude! Def one of the best albums in power metal history. I love every song in that album.<br>  <br>  Wolf has killer fast bass. Damien, one of my fave pow met songs, I love the speech I will avenge thy torment. Jack, great song. Ghost of Freedom, very emotional "semi-acoustic" song. Im-Ho-Tep another great projection of Matt's vocals "With this power, I shall live again!". ... . . not much to say .. . . . Dracula my all-time favorite, proof that Matt is a God. . .. . . Phantom Opera Ghost, very nice duet, kinda cheesy though, hehehe.<br>  <br>  All in all, the album is well-thought. The solos, though some are kinda weak, I could say that it's being overwhelmed by the vocals and carefully selected notes in the riffs.<br>  <br>  \m/<br>  <br>  PS. Honestly dude, this question made my day! I enjoyed it. 11 out of 10.|`|u8ia6oKxaa	Hey KP!<br>  <br>  I was wondering if you had given up on this after the low participation of the first one.<br>  <br>  first of all, I am a fan of Iced Earth, I own this album..but its probably my least listened to album by them.  I do think the theme of the album is kinda cool, but Barlow's voice on this album just isn't my style.  It seems like he uses his high pitch voice alot more than usual on this album (I'd say I prefer his lower darker voice that is more prevalent on The Dark Saga or Burnt Offerings)<br>  <br>  Musically, this album is really good.  All songs apart from maybe a couple appeal to me.  It has arguable their most talented lineup with the underrated Richard Christy on drums and one of my fav bassist Steve Digiorgio.  My favourite song is probably "Wolf"  although Dracula is close.<br>  <br>  with that said...I just don't listen to this album too much.  Its not like its bad, but it just doesn't jump out at me like their other albums|`|gO0AmLoDaa	I love this album!  It's my 2nd favorite by Iced Earth (#1 is Something Wicked This Way Comes).  Matt Barlow is awesome.  I love how he has a deep voice but he can do those really high pitch screams.  My fave songs on here are Dragon's Child (I really like the drums in this song), Wolf, Damien, and Transylvania.|`|dFacbjIZaa	Fantastic Album Peach Man. And I totally agree about Matt Barlow, definitely one of the finest Voices in Metal. <br>  <br>  Horror Show is My fourth favorite Iced Earth album overall and My favorite songs from it are Im-Ho-Tep and Wolf.<br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  I should Mention the Album is quite a Concept, everyone knows what inspiration that the entire genre of Metal draws from Horror Films. It was certainly time that someone did a Horror Movie themed Album, and Iced Earth did it (as usual) quite well.|`|dQvKvnVuaa	Excellent album, I own it:)<br>  <br>  My favourite CD by Iced Earth would have to be The Glorious Burden.

32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	That Song is even better than all her other Songs.<br>  Thanks for sharing..|`|3cGgRo42aa	Hun, there's a video in the related box about the same song with more than a million views.|`|Z7n9F0dyaa	i love it too in fact i have it on my ipod.I wish they would play it on the radio because i know a lot of people who have never heard the song and would probally like it.|`|yEu7nCtBaa	yeah it was one of my faves on her album when it forst came out =]
AA11705909	I see the paparazzi are getting a restraining order out on her, she won't leave them be.|`|8d32360b2ae46f54d5979a019fc43955aa	Haha, very possibly but i tihnk that would be a big mistake as your right, and shes terrible live. I like her just as she is now x.|`|gHyu4Hqaaa	I think she is ok|`|yEu7nCtBaa	lets hope not|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	good i hope not,shes is pants live but the blonde is much worse its painful to listen too.|`|la9zji2Uaa	Ha ha. she is cr@p isn't she. I hope not - she should just stick to being on TV judging panels and looking pretty. Seems a nice girl either way. x
zrARzUTPaa	i bought the album off itunes after i heard him wit kanye.....i lik 2/3 of it there are a few that arent that hot. i like night night the best tho|`|D1c8cRM4aa	I was one of the 10,000!!!!<br>  <br>  Who Knew My Luck Would Change is my fav|`|os6FaEBlaa	Yeah, my favorite song on there is "Don't Fogetem", and yes I heard the album, I actually was one of those 10,000.|`|pLBHN0OKaa	I got the cd it is pretty tight and his mixtape with dj who kid is really good too COnsequence is the tight and he hasa good flow plus with Kanye on the album that makes it better it is a really good album Consequence can go hard he should be having a new album in 2009 sometime|`|HL8W9yU6aa	I like the album, at first i was a little skeptic about it...<br>  <br>  I rate it a 6.4/10<br>  <br>  I dont think it's a classic, my fave song off it is The Good The Bad and The Ugly. I cant wait to see what he's gonna come out with next, i think he has something coming either in 09 or 2010...
cYgxTWDVaa	Yeah. It's pretty much pop-rock now.<br>  <br>  Which isn't rock, so I guess you're right.<br>  <br>  Mainstream is all about the money now. No quality, as long as it sounds good to the majority of its listeners and sadly, the masses like it as long as its catchy.<br>  <br>  overly suggestive lyrics + retarded singer + overproduced MIDI music = The formula for a successful pop song<br>  <br>  It doesn't even have to be rap. And I thought rap should sound raw. You don't use auto-tune when you rap I mean really....<br>  <br>  The only way to get good music now is to listen to metal or older music. Which means you can't rely on the radio anymore.|`|b596afeb182e83361c069a4dbe60acf3aa	I Blame my generation for failing to stay home and show our little brothers and sisters what real music was all about. I graduated in 1985 and shortly thereafter a bunch of preteens grew up watching Gangsta rap on MTV thinking it was cool. So now we have a whole generation of middle class predominantly white youth acting like they'ree from the streets and talking ghetto. I'm not making it a racial thing, it's just when I was in high school, no one acted like that, even the black kids. This is just my observation as I'vee watched the decline of rock & roll over the past 2 decades. I think Bruce Springsteen said it best with his song "Radio Nowhere" which is pretty much the current state of rock radio.|`|nEn6EPuqaa	says who? mtv? lol come on...<br>  <br>  its not like rock isn't "mainstream" it's there. And I don't personally like rap because it sounds bad and it's horribly degrading, but I admire it because it does provide a means for young, poor african americans to better themselves. They can't afford instruments so they gravitate towards rap. <br>  <br>  it reasonable. but its sad that those who do make it and overcame the odds live such a disrespectful life. Rap and R&B artists time and time again are making themselves look like thugs|`|7BKHXioWaa	I agree with you that Rock is better than Rap, but rap has had mainstream success because it is the media's dream. Rap usually has controversial lyrics, which sparks worldwide controversy.|`|82f28216acfea170ebefb0b7a25198d7aa	You need to check out rock band PERMANENT ABILITY<br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/permanentability" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/permanentability</a><br>  Available on iTunes|`|OVkxvFSvaa	I don't really know. I'm really glad you asked that question. I love rock way more than rap. I absolutely 110% agree with you.|`|xFPM7sKEaa	I like this question =)|`|JThgHiaoaa	Because there has been fu<k all good rock come out in like 10 years...<br>  <br>  Emo is shi+ so best to just get CD's or move to metal|`|FSyaAnuKaa	Everything these days sucks. There are very few bands that I actually like. That's why I listen to bands from the 60s, 70s, and 80s.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	If you think about it, a lot of rap songs have rock influences.<br>  <br>  Rhianna <br>  Lil Wayne<br>  Flobots<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of, because I don't pay attention to that stuff, but I know there's more.|`|ebxwADDcaa	well the popular rock music wasnt all that much better...probably because thats what the media wants everyone to listen to.<br>  <br>  dont ask me why|`|t7U9rliVaa	Most mainstream rock sucks, too!|`|88nljACwaa	I agree!

But it is already sold out. :-(|`|KHVvDMLYaa	an amazing singer with a unique voice<br>  love story was my fav song for a while<br>  her songs relax me|`|a8mQuc4iaa	i think she is an ok singer i normally hate singers like that (im into like gothic rock) but im from the country myself and i think she is ok-ish|`|SHoIWZ56aa	she can sing<br>  and has nice hair
cuIX13BKaa	Well your own chart question was well answered...as I look at my own....Virgo Sun Mutable, Aries Moon Cardinal, Cancer rising Cardinal Mercury in Leo Fixed Venus in Cancer Cardinal Mars in Leo Fixed Jupiter in Gemini Mutable Neptune in Libra Cardinal Saturn in Libra Cardinal Uranus in Cancer Cardinal Pluto in Leo Fixed...this is leaving out the houses which cross over and I wont write all of that Right now as it is a fine mix and very complicated.....but essentially I have 6 Cardinal Signs, Two Mutable and Three Fixed.......somehow the house placements allow th Libra to bring out a more mutable side..on account of the decanates that they are in....but Cardinal it is. I see it as a rather lovely thing actually.<br>  <br>  Garbo<br>  <br>  P.S. You have a Lovely Combination.....! Very Strong and as well Sensitive...brilliant!|`|BXe211Fvaa	You're more Cardinal.

You have intercepted signs, just like me. The same intercepted signs in the same houses as well. We both have Pisces and Virgo intercepted in the 1st and 7th houses. Having intercepted signs by itself isn't that common, just...wow.<br>  <br>  Well, to answer your original question, Cardinal 9, Fixed 8, and Mutable 7. Kinda cutting it close.<br>  Gemini Sun, Taurus Moon, Cancer Mercury, Cancer Venus, Taurus Mars, Scorpio Jupiter, Pisces Saturn, Capricorn Uranus, Capricorn Neptune, Scorpio Pluto. Aquarius Rising, Aries House 2, Taurus House 3, Gemini House 4, Gemini House 5, Cancer House 6, Leo House 7, Libra House 8, Scorpio House 9, Sagittarius House 10, Sagittarius House 11, Capricorn House 12.<br>  = )|`|fgK1zOSiaa	Mutable

rZQYCpabaa	He is by far my least favorite character on the show.  He's an animal who killed Josh and didn't you all love when Reese and Bianca praised him for being a hero after he murdered him?  Zach is an abuser and thinks that he runs that town.<br>  He isn't likable and I don't think that the actor is attractive at all.  Way to caveman like for my taste.<br>  He's gross and needs to leave.  Maybe he and Kendall can do a  murder/suicide. :)|`|cCqqaKAuaa	I'm not tired of his performance, but I AM tired of his APPEARANCE. He used to be neat, clean looking. Now his hair is always unruly and dirty looking. About that beard!!!..I can't figure out why he's looking that way.<br>  As for his character..he's a multi-millionaire just like Adam & Palmer. He's got power too. One thing I'll say for him though, he's straight up; tells it like it is.<br>  C'mon "Zack"..wash your hair & get rid of that beard!!|`|Zss0O9tjaa	I love Zach forever!|`|fTDLUe8daa	well she was not as connected to him as she was kendall. everyone said that so much that you said would happen with the trouble with erica and kendall but it did not happen.he did not go out and just shoot him for no reason. controlling? i do not see him like that i guess i am the only one that sees him as protective. he was ready to take the blame for the car wreck for kendall. there is really no man in there and he stands up and takes responsibity for those women. he stepped up when he and kendall was having trouble yes maybe he did not consult her at the time of her thing with that short affair with that guy but it was that serum that caused that. he had no sex just donated serum for that baby so her sister could have a sibling close to the other one she had . i just do not realize why she would want something to remind her even more of that raping that bianca had from zachs brother.kendall is just enother generarion of the cane family;|`|jHDeIPEfaa	I love Zach. I love Zach and Kendall together. If Thorsten Kaye is leaving the show, they should let Kendall forgive Zach and let them be happy together.

Josh's heart should have gone to the 1st person on the waiting list.....not Kendall.....but it's a soap.  <br>  I think Erica just wants him back with Kendall and her boys.|`|jfriQ8pmaa	I am tired of him too!!  I didn't even like the way he was going to kill Josh for stealing the money...couldn't even give him a chance to explain at all...just wanted him dead so Kendall had to send him away. This was when I started getting sick of him...I think he wanted him dead anyway, Kendall getting his heart was a bonus.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	Yes, he is getting annoying...but I think he's better then Kendall...by far.

cLK3sFzVaa	A couple went on vacation to a fishing resort up<br>  north. The husband liked to fish at the crack of dawn.<br>  The wife liked to read.<br>  One morning the husband returned after several hours<br>  of fishing and decided to take a short nap. Although<br>  she wasn't familiar with the lake, the wife decided to<br>  take the boat. She rowed out a short distance,<br>  anchored, and returned to reading her book. Along came<br>  the sheriff in his boat. He pulled up alongside her<br>  and said, "Good morning, Ma'am. What are you doing?"<br>  <br>  "Reading my book," she replied...as she thought to<br>  herself, "duh -- isn't it obvious?"<br>  <br>  "You're in a restricted fishing area," he informed her.<br>  <br>  "But officer, I'm not fishing. Can't you see that?"<br>  <br>  "Yes, but you have all the equipment. I'll have to<br>  take you in and write you up."<br>  <br>  "If you do that, I'll have to charge you with sexual assault,"<br>  snapped the irate woman.<br>  <br>  "But, I haven't even touched you," groused the sheriff.<br>  <br>  "Yes, that's true, she replied, "but you do have all the equipment."<br>  ----<br>  Several men are in the locker room of a golf club. <br>  <br>  A cell phone on a bench rings and a man engages the hands free speaker-function and begins to talk. <br>  <br>  Everyone else in the room stops to listen. <br>  <br>  MAN: "Hello." <br>  <br>  WOMAN: "Honey, it's me. Are you at the club?" <br>  <br>  MAN: "Yes." <br>  <br>  WOMAN: "I am at the mall now and found this beautiful leather coat. It's only $1,000. Is it OK if I buy it?" <br>  <br>  MAN: "Sure, go ahead if you like it that much." <br>  <br>  WOMAN: "I also stopped by the Mercedes dealership and saw the new 2010 models. I saw one I really liked." <br>  <br>  MAN: "How much?" <br>  <br>  WOMAN: "$90,000." <br>  <br>  MAN: "OK, but for that price, I want it with all the options." <br>  <br>  WOMAN: "Great! Oh, and one more thing .....the house I wanted last year is back on the market. They're asking $950,000." <br>  <br>  MAN: "Well, then go ahead and give them an offer of $900,000. They will probably take it. If not, we can go the extra 50 thousand. It is really a pretty good price." <br>  <br>  WOMAN: "OK. I'll see you later!I love you so much!!" <br>  <br>  MAN: "Bye! I love you, too." <br>  <br>  The man hangs up. The other men in the locker room are staring at him in astonishment, mouths agape..... <br>  <br>  Then he smiles and asks: "Anyone know who this phone belongs to?"<br>  -----<br>  A young boy enters a barber shop and the barber whispers to his customer, "This is the dumbest kid in the world. Watch while I prove it to you." <br>  The barber puts a quarter in one hand and two dimes in the other. Then calls the boy over and asks, "Which do you want, son?" The boy takes the coins and leaves. <br>  "What did I tell you?" said the barber. "That kid never learns!" <br>  Later, when the customer leaves, he sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store. "Hey, son! May I ask you a question? Why did you take the dimes instead of the quarters?" <br>  The boy licked his cone and replied, "Because the day I take the quarters, the game's over!"|`|GiO4NYehaa	DIVORCE LETTER<br>  <br>  Dear Wife: <br>  <br>  I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you forever. I've been a good man to you for seven years and I have nothing to show for it. These last two weeks have been hell. Your boss called to tell me that you quit your job today and that was the last straw. <br>  <br>  Last week, you came home and didn't even notice that I had a new haircut,had cooked your favorite meal and even wore a brand new pair of silk boxers. You ate in two minutes, and went straight to sleep after<br>  watching all of your soaps. You don't tell me you love me anymore;<br>  you don't want sex or anything that connects us as husband and wife. <br>  <br>  Either you're cheating on me or you don't love me anymore; whatever the case, I'm gone. <br>  <br>  Your EX-Husband <br>  <br>  P.S. Don't try to find me. Your SISTER Carla and I are moving away to West Virginia together! Have a great life! <br>  <br>  ______________________________________... <br>  Dear Ex-Husband, <br>  <br>  Nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter.<br>  It's true that you and I have been married for seven years, although<br>  a good man is a far cry from what you've been. I watch my soaps so<br>  much because they drown out your constant whining and griping. Too bad that doesn't work. <br>  <br>  I DID notice when you got a hair cut last week, but the first thing<br>  that came to mind was 'You look just like a girl!' Since my mother<br>  raised me not to say anything if you can't say something nice, I<br>  didn't comment. And when you cooked my favorite meal, you must have gotten me confused with MY SISTER, because I stopped eating pork seven years ago. <br>  <br>  About those new silk boxers: I turned away from you because the $49.99 price tag was still on them, and I prayed that it was a coincidence that my sister had just borrowed fifty do llars from me that morning. After all of this, I still loved you and felt that we could work it out. So when I hit the lotto for ten million dollars, I quit my job and bought us two tickets to Jamaica . But then I got home you were gone. Everything happens for a reason, I guess. I hope you have the<br>  fulfilling life you always wanted. My lawyer said that the letter<br>  you wrote ensures you won't get a dime from me. So take care. <br>  <br>  Signed , <br>  Your Ex-Wife, Rich As Hell and Free! <br>  <br>  P.S. I don't know if I ever told you this, but my sister Carla<br>  was born Carl. I hope that's not a problem.|`|ZIGygVlsaa	joe his wife a having an anniversary but joe forgot. his wife says tomorrow she wants a present in the driveway that goes from 0 - 200 fast. the next morning she gets up and finds a weight scale in the driveway. joe has been missing since friday.|`|d8ox561maa	A guy suspected that his wife was cheating on him, so he hired a Chinese detective...the cheapest one he could find.

tbsVhIIAaa	A good keyboard sounds exactly like a grand piano, or very close.<br>  <br>  I have some old 2005 Yamaha Keyboard, which has about 200+ instrument settings. It can even play a woman screaming. I think Yamaha keyboards are the best.<br>  <br>  Playing a keyboard isn't like playing a piano, because usually the keys are easier to press, giving the piano more of a thud to the notes.<br>  <br>  I taught myself to play by ear, then I got a piano-teaching book, and taught myself that. As long as you have rhythm, patience, and a good ear, you'll be able to play splendidly in no time.

NJ25E4AZaa	It started off great and then got worse as it went on. Jackie Earl Haley did great as Rorschach, though.|`|y4ZgS4LEaa	I think it was good but slow. See i read the book so i knew everything.<br>  I did think some parts were a little confusing, but overall it was great!|`|59fa36c2d111e5790fda3b9fc1291d50aa	I watched it a few days ago.  I thought it would be one of those typical comic book movies.  But boy, was I wrong.  It was confusing and quite frustrating, because I kept getting confused on who was who, why certain things occurred, etc.  I guess you have to be a Watchmen fan to truly like the movie.  I bet I would have loved this movie if I actually knew what the comic book was about.  <br>  <br>  So my suggestion for anyone who is going to watch this movie, do some research or something about the comic book beforehand.  It will make the story flow better.<br>  <br>  Although it was confusing and frustrating because I got lost throughout the movie, the ending was interesting.

uhHbcIopaa	Hahaha this is the funniest question I've read. Yeah I think he seems like the Typical Aquarius. He looks to be emotionally detached but enjoys being around people. He likes making fun of others but at the same time he takes it easy when somebody makes fun of him. If Sponge bob does sth to him, Patrick forgives him the next second. That reminds me of my brother. He has lots of friends because he is like that, but that doesn't mean being stupid... it means not giving importance to small things. My brother Aquarius lives life to the fullest and doesn't let others ruin his day.|`|AA11868064	hmmm maybe not the 'typical' but somewhat like an aquarius. good question,i love that show!|`|4VNFsmanaa	No, not really.

uGmEjSLDaa	CSI: Miami is a good answer.<br>  <br>  'Battle of the Bods' has to win this. A bunch of supposedly gorgeous girls get 'rated' on their body parts (not kidding) by three troglodyte guys whom they never meet, all for the INCREDIBLE SUM (not) of $5000 cash should they rank themselves exactly correctly--and the $5000 gets split five ways, so they each only wind up with a thousand apiece.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, the tables aren't turned, so the whole thing (to me, at least) has this entirely skeevy, sketchy, prurient vibe to it. If they did girls one day, guys the next, it wouldn't seem quite so tasteless for its fair-mindedness, but its whole message is that women are a collection of ratable body parts. Need I mention that it comes on at, like, three in the morning? Of course it comes on at three in the morning.|`|8g8pHNyUaa	Actually, I used to be a HUGE fan of Gossip Girl. <br>  <br>  I had read the books first, and then I started watching the show. It's amazing how different the two are. I, honestly, cannot get into Gossip Girl anymore. Everything is just so different and there are so many twists and turns in the show. It's hard to keep up! (At least for me.)<br>  <br>  But anyways, I think the worst show is either American Idol, (I know, I know, but the show is just so overrated now, people just go on the show to embarrass themselves or to become INFAMOUS like, oh, let's say,William Hung.)<br>  <br>  Next to that, I'm going with the girl above me and saying Kyle XY.<br>  <br>  EDIT* I also agree with Hopper!

It included good health, good fortunes and peace of mind to them and the questionnaire!!!!!!|`|RIZpDdNgaa	Yes, well people always dream so if you don't "have one" then that means you have forgot it.|`|y6406A92aa	Not that I know of..|`|AA11431665	I Dont Really Remember...|`|8t1Osybyaa	5 different dreams|`|Ng2xjVKLaa	Yea, I got attacked by this dude, and I don't think I should give details :]|`|BhQSTvLsaa	I don't think so. <br>  <br>  That's unusual for me though. I usually always have dreams.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	I had many, every night. I was once part of a sleep study because of my own night terrors and sleep walking.<br>  Last night I had a dream that there were explosive knives and blades that could be set off by invisible lasers and people were getting annihilated by them. Somehow I had to diffuse them, but lost the lower half of my body in the attempt. Yeah, it sucked.<br>  I also had a dream that I picked myself up off the ground and flew all over the place, I ended up in a war zone. The flying part was cool, I have at least 2-3 flying dreams/week. I also had a dream that my cat's fur was actually colored yarn and it started to fall off.<br>  Just a sampling from last night.|`|tvdabilNaa	Of course, but I don't remember them at this point of the day.|`|7iHg8CKtaa	i forgot mine but i know when i woke up i was very confused lol.|`|R1XlS57Laa	I think I did.  If I told you though, it probably wouldn't make any sense at all.|`|oVRA1ze2aa	no, bu tI did finally get a really good nights sleep.I've been battling insomnia for the past 5 months. Since Hurricane Ike I haven't been able too sleep at all.

But you don't always remember them (which is why people say they don't dream). If you really didn't dream, you'd go mentally insane as found by some expiriments done years ago.|`|eta0c25yaa	i forgot mines|`|XojxC4xxaa	You have a dream every night.

yMgIoYmhaa	You should let your kids chose what kind of activity's and sports<br>  they want to do, but kids should be involved in something.<br>  To many kids just want to play video games or stay on the<br>  computer or watch TV all day and that's not good.<br>  If kids can't make up their minds on what they want to do, maybe<br>  taking them to a game or to a class will help them chose.<br>  Making a kid do an activity/sport he or she doesn't want to do is<br>  a wast of the parents money. There are plenty of fun things for<br>  kids to do. Kids should stay active to stay healthy same gos for adults<br>  too. Kids being involved in an activity/sport may help raise their <br>  self esteem. Kids should have the right to chose what activity/sport<br>  they want to do. Even arts and crafts are pretty good for kids to do.|`|KHL4N6mtaa	yeah, i think the parents should ask the child before signing them up for anything. that activity or sport might not be free & it's basically forcing your kid to do something they might not possibly like & that's bad enough itself, but then possibly wasting money.|`|rcHnA1iQaa	depends how old the kid is|`|ZEXGmO5Zaa	Yeah pretty much<br>  <br>  The kid should get a choice<br>  after all they're the ones that's going to have to participate in the sport/activity|`|9wblT5sYaa	yeah I cant imagine that going well.  my little sis gets to choose her activities and she ends up hating them after they start.  I'm sure it cant be good when they didn't even have a say in the process.|`|J1J47FIAaa	Yes Ive been forced to play the violin. I quit a year later. So much for wasting a year for nothing.|`|tA9xFG5oaa	depends on how old the kid is|`|v9bTfQGMaa	Yes, no one should be forced to do something they don't want to do, and it's better for the kid to give permission so there's no problem with them playing|`|UJHKyg7kaa	Absolutely! Because the child does not have an opinion if they want to do that sport or activity and it is not fair to the child.|`|uLelMuqZaa	Heck yes! That is controlling their lives, and if they do it too much the kids won't learn to make smart decisions!|`|LOgmCZdzaa	Yes. My mom used to do this all the time, along with making me hang out with friends and telling me 30 minutes before they were coming over. WTF?|`|hiN0khbJaa	Yes. They should talk to their kids first before they sign them up.|`|yq72XIhdaa	Only if they're fat and need exercise.|`|ImnZzaRCaa	yesssss!!! i hate that|`|8e56c18f1d43a3a9358100f12e2c44feaa	yes<br>  did your parents do that???<br>  well, i think its not right, becuase the kid knows what he/she is good at and the parents wouldnt know<br>  <br>  -NiKKi|`|9PscVlV3aa	Yes|`|fcku4bGjaa	yes
AA11615109	He was talking about the 1st attempt.<br>  <br>  The 1993 World Trade Center bombing occurred on February 26, 1993, when a car bomb was detonated below Tower One of the World Trade Center in New York City. The gas enhanced device was intended to knock the North Tower (Tower One) into the South Tower (Tower Two), bringing both towers down and killing thousands of people. It failed to do so, but did kill six people and injured 1,042.|`|wZa3qiSbaa	yeah that's weird , and he died like in 97 I believe|`|VGRah7Xuaa	there are  2 s question..<br>  1.

yjSGVfdiaa	Lovers in Japan kind of reminds me of Automatic for the People-era REM.  Excellently produced (this is Eno, right?) brit pop - one of Coldplay's best songs, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Never been much of a KoL fan and less so with each subsequent album, they've released.<br>  That sounds much harsher than I mean it to. They're a decent band - just sort of middle of the road for me.  I keep wanting to like them more because I know a lot of people that like them that I have very similar taste to... it just never seems to happen.  Same deal with Wilco.<br>  <br>  Anyway - I'm going with Lovers in Japan.  Good matchup.|`|7B2s7maWaa	I enjoy both songs equally all though "Use Somebody" has been stuck in my head all day.

Yes, Amazing? Yes.<br>  I'm sorry... I don't have the heart to choose, both are very special to me :')<br>  Closer! Definitely! Still getting into JD, but I love it.<br>  All Those Years Ago by George Harrison, as I said before WDC is the only Prince song I like.<br>  <br>  How Soon Is Now, without a doubt.<br>  Gouge Away- Pixies, its one of my favorite songs EVER.<br>  The One I Love by R.E.M. the other one is overplayed...<br>  Where the Streets Have No Name-U2, one of the very few U2 songs I like.<br>  Echo & The Bunnymen - The Killing Moon, I never liked Duran, Duran.<br>  <br>  I Want to Know What Love Is-Foreigner, I always disliked Drive! The Cars have so many songs that are much better...<br>  Hard one, but I love Dead more.<br>  The Wipers - Youth of America, I LOVE The Wipers.<br>  Light Never Goes Out-Smiths, love both, though.<br>  I Will Dare-The Replacements, the replacements are amazing and BFMV bores me.<br>  <br>  Dr Feelgood-Motley Crue, blech... but its the lesser of two evils.<br>  Sweet Child O' Mine-Guns N' Roses, my fave GNR song.<br>  Every Rose has Its Thorn- Poison, despite all their cheesiness its still wonderful.<br>  Fascination Street- The Cure, I got nothin'.<br>  AHH!

WbRuTjmFaa	I second Annie Lennox, all in favor?<br>  <br>  WOW!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I think there are only three female vocalists that Freddie would really love to preform with.<br>  <br>  Annie Lennox - Her dramatics would have matched Freddie's.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNG2z4wWkhA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNG2z4wWk...</a><br>  Liza Minelli - He absolutely ADORED her.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvnxpK_qxmQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvnxpK_qx...</a><br>  Monserrat Caballe - He said she was the best singer ever.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFLu6bu7LEk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFLu6bu7L...</a>|`|AA11166769	Possibly, even though I'm not really a big Amy Winehouse fan. I think it would have been great if he had done a duet with Annie Lennox!:)|`|eEoeURDHaa	Don't put him in R&S, people won't believe he existed then.<br>  <br>  Freddie and Stevie Nicks<br>  <br>  MA: Steve Earle and Emmylou Harris|`|JeBwR3Wpaa	Nah.<br>  2nd answer.  Morbid Angel with Eric Rutan in wacken hahaha.|`|dbZtCmm6aa	No, I am sorry but Amy Winehouse's vocals are not up to the snuff of Freddie. If I were to suggest a female voice I would Either say, random of course, Leona Lewis Or Amy Lee. Strange as it seems They both have the same ability to hit high notes. Combined it would be played out well. <br>  <br>  MQ- Queen And David Bowie- Under Pressure|`|AA11919945	Freddie Mercury and Annie Lennox|`|0vm66wlcaa	Freddie Mercury & Ann Wilson.<br>  <br>  MQ: Jason Becker & Marty Friedman<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Or Freddie Mercury and Rob Halford Haha
0s5cqjJ5aa	I believe that God is out there.<br>  <br>  There is more logic to believing in intelligent design than believing in the big bang.. try proving it wrong and you'll end up believing the last thing you'd expect. <br>  <br>  Haha sorry i'm going off subject.<br>  But even atheists are able to understand that while everything they do may, or may not, be pointless, the rest of us are spending our life having a good time while others are wasting it contemplating just how pointless everything is.<br>  Why not let that help you worry about things less, and just go along for the ride?|`|r5h7TmWJaa	Yeah, I totally feel that way. It's like, to yourself, you are the centre of the universe. But to the universe, you might as well not even be there. I feel so pointless, small, and insignificant. The human race together isn't even a dust particle to the universe. I always get all depressed in Earth and Space Science class.|`|GDdTEEDZaa	yeh i hear ya , there is really no point to life i mean your born and then you die , (yay) like whats the point|`|tpaoUt5Xaa	It sounds crazy and no I do not share your logic.|`|xhazgUllaa	yeah i get cha.<br>  everyone should drop the rules and live freeely.<br>  no bombing, no war. just total peace.<br>  free food. and people who produce the food dont get payed cause they know they are doing it for a good reason.<br>  <br>  :)|`|n1RqtQ4Naa	yea i do but thats cool because your totally free to do anything you want to do or become because in the end nothing really matters<br>  and you just Live|`|9Igo15ZPaa	suicidal?|`|kdlWcH3zaa	dust in the wind.. all we are is dust in the wiiiiiiiiiiiiiind ?|`|npeJPCvyaa	You mean there is no point for the other planets?|`|ihxO8qApaa	lol, but think about this, who says YOU have to do something big to change the universe? as long as YOUR happy to hell with the universe. sounds selfish but the human race is selfish.<br>  <br>  <br>  i completely understand your logic but your looking at everything the wrong way, do for yourself, not to change the universe. plus it would take billion billions of years for something intresting to happen anyway with the universe ^^|`|XZecjMyXaa	move to jupiter to get more stupider. jkjk:)|`|wylAjpfmaa	i think about that alll the time<br>  not in like a suicidal way tho..ahha<br>  but yeah,<br>  today i was thinking about all these problems in my life right now<br>  and i was like WTFF<br>  who cares? my problems/life is gonna mean nothing once i die<br>  so whats the point of trying?
V20PTwMmaa	your hair is orange|`|twVyisGnaa	Pretty darn scary about those orange people.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|jcL7gDMKaa	yeah ive seen them too! They look scary! Would be good if they could have their necks orange too and not just their faces to make it look consistent! The freaks!|`|uaq8OSUjaa	Yay, American is finally a race!|`|AA11431665	Orange People????<br>  <br>  Wtf....|`|mggll8dRaa	Sure Enough, I have noticed....lol....!!|`|pZVEBEmLaa	It's a fake tan. It's sort of attractive. ;o)|`|xNYUZZvlaa	Yes, I have. It's not at all pretty, not trying to offend anyone, but I'd rather look pale than orange.<br>  <br>  I'm light skinned for a hispanic and I like it. Don't care that everyone else says.|`|wqrycWlEaa	Haha<br>  Orange!|`|2wsv8vz4aa	pshahwashABBYlkdjalkdj|`|oVRA1ze2aa	you mean the spray tan race like George Hamilton|`|gIitANOkaa	LMAO...|`|1dVoVp1gaa	yes those ppl that stay in the tanning booth to long|`|a31kUn1Naa	I've seen them!<br>  <br>  Scarrrryyyy.|`|dTcSBuYZaa	Yupp.  The STeoples. (pronounced steeples)<br>  [S]pray [T]an PEOPLE.<br>  <br>  Ahaha, it's not the look I like, but if they become<br>  a widespread group I'll get to use my new word!<br>  <br>  Hmmm...   OR maybe the Sprans... YeahH! I like<br>  that one even better then the Steoples. Woohooo(:|`|l5zWxw1Aaa	lmfao, it took me awhile to understand what you mean.<br>  <br>  and yeah....isn't it so weird? people spray tanning themselves orange...<br>  <br>  lmfao. i think it's hilarious, people go out and get a natural tan from the sun! not some caked on orange goo.|`|zskbhOHeaa	lol yes and its disgusting!!! i dont c the point in fake *** tans!! it looks fake and i feel like if i were to touch that person i would have orange gunk all over my hand.|`|XojxC4xxaa	Yes.  <br>  <br>  Also known as 'fake bakers' or 'fake bakes', but mostly 'Americans', they comment on their 'natural' 'olive', or 'golden' tone to their skin.  Mostly resides in Americans.<br>  <br>  lol [:|`|I9yHqIkJaa	Don't mess with them.<br>  If you are being serious... the orange people is bad news.<br>  <br>  We had them here in the late 70's.... caused a lot of trouble.<br>  <br>  Cheers from Australia|`|3fEfuPWOaa	Yes, they usually originate from tanning salons.|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	hahaha YES! ugh its so unattractive.|`|d2501d420de16d088ba45fa7988a4bdcaa	I have. They are otherwise known as tanorexics. They spend way to much time in the tanning beds LOL|`|65nZU9eLaa	Ya New Mexico  people are finally a race.<br>  <br>  <br>  JK lol!    <br>  No i have not|`|3cGgRo42aa	:/ i hate fake tans.<br>  it's so.....artificial|`|fnnm3W2qaa	no<br>  why would someone be called that? Did they eat to many carrots?
EZdRYJXraa	Yes sometimes I do and I think everyone do it,it's the most normal thing to do.|`|d69d49545272c36ef0603d8151da8422aa	Yes, 2nd grade, Dianne, a little mennonite girl in Phoenix who used to carry my books home from school, no kidding.<br>  <br>  Pretty, kind and sweet.  I hope she has had a happy life|`|HCqJixZmaa	Yes. Adam Medina where are you???|`|V0PHto2Faa	yea but i know right now he's buying my niece a birthday present. He's my best friend and crush lol|`|CMpyekpNaa	i remember my first crush on a girl when I was in juniors (like 3 years ago)<br>  <br>  she was really tall; she was around 5'9 at 11 year's of age, she was really tall for her age and i was like 5'4. <br>  <br>  After we finished junior school we both moved to different high schools. After that I never saw her agian. I think she has not grown much because she might have had growth spurt. She is to my prediction now around 5'10. And I also grown I'am 5'11 now.|`|QhT9MjEoaa	Yesyesyes!|`|MlQ0GIpoaa	Yeah, I think about it often. Unfortunately i didn't find her on facebook, or myspace.|`|ztn0LcSFaa	yes|`|741f43778c091f8363a1fc7dd81e84ffaa	nah but for you to bring it up....|`|6pEevKn6aa	yeah....i dont even know where he is....i would love to find him though just to catch up!|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	no, i know what he's doing right now...he should be somewhere in this school, sitting in a classroom<br>  <br>  ugh,  don't know how i even had a crush on him, but it was 1st grade and i was nieve
ekQPmQagaa	You missed everything! My wife left me, my kids moved out of the house, my pickup truck's engine died... but luckily I got custody of the hound dog! lol (you might be a redneck if...) haha!|`|tjNcuH7iaa	Now That Youre Back... Is God Mad That You Left Heaven?<br>  <br>  I Dont Think You Miss Much Anyway!?|`|PCDuyf8raa	blood is like wine im conscious all the time, if i had all again id changed it all
ifYOXajoaa	Dear Irrevocably in ? with Twilight,<br>  <br>  Yes, I think she will be just fine for that part. Exactly, She wouldn't have been my first choice, But i think she will do just fine. I think they could chose someone a little.. Older, Maybe. I just am not sure if Dakota would be able to play as a cruel, and evil person in "New Moon" But i will just have to wait till the movie comes out.<br>  <br>  People shouldn't judge just this second, because she is young, and probably still.. Girly? Well, She is 14 now, and i think she is mature enough to play this role. But we will just have to keep our patience.|`|Q6uEvBqzaa	i think she will do OK at the movie. but:<br>  <a href="http://www.4tnz.com/content/dakota-crushing-robert?utm_source=newsletter18-mmm&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter18" rel="nofollow">http://www.4tnz.com/content/dakota-crush...</a><br>  <br>  its kinda uhh, eww. with the age difference.<br>  but if you guys want to download twilight mp4 format here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=6IM3FSP1" rel="nofollow">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=6IM3FSP1</a>|`|HRtqw6cbaa	I think she will do amazing and rock the part! Before she was even rumored, I thought she would be great for the role of Jane. Dakota is just how I imagined Jane as I read(over and over and over again) ha ha:)<br>  I can't wait till New Moon, I hope they keep the rest of the cast the same and find really good actors for the new characters such as the Volturi. I am also excited to see how they encorporate the Cullens into this movie more, and how they transfer from book to big screen. Novwember 20 in the US|`|ufTjv25Jaa	I CAN'T WAIT! Lol I think she will do a great job. As you said, the looks might not be right, but she is a BRILLIANT actress and I'm sure she will be perfect. When reading the book I didn't picture Jane anything like Dakota, but that doesn't really matter, as long as she portrays Jane and her traits the same as in the book.|`|RxHb1P4Faa	I think she'll do great. She has been in a lot of different types of movies on different powerful emotional levels. She will pull it off. I'm excited to see what happens.|`|hFFIphqNaa	Honestly, I don't think she's the girl for the role. I think AnnaSophia Robb from the movie, Race To Witch Mountain is.|`|OrKLpzenaa	She'll be okay. Personally I think it would be best if they stick with the unknowns like they did in the first movie and avoid all the already-movie stars. That's why I loved the first movie, because they had unknown actors and bands on their soundtrack (mostly unknown). I wish they would have stayed that way for new moon.|`|zMqKDqpIaa	I think she will do pretty well in New Moon. She wouldn't be my first choice. She been in a lot movies about different. But they should have pick someone a lot more prettier, but I think she'll do well as the actor. Maybe with pale skin and golden eyes she'd look better. Who is going to be Alec? I heard it was going to be Lucas Grabeel. Then that rumored turned ou to be wrong. And I am glad it was.|`|TiyL6ijzaa	I think she'll be great! She has great talent and ever since she was mentioned for the role I could picture her for Jane. She can be creepy too which is vital. Personally I can't wait to see her in it.|`|EF1SbGssaa	i think she'll play the part really well (and hopefully new moon will be much better than twilight), but i didn't picture jane looking like dakota|`|xN0bB8EGaa	I totally agree with you...her acting is great but she isn't my first choice based on looks either.  I also pictured someone older.|`|s8laxcO1aa	i think that she will do just fine shes not my first chose either but she has grown as a actress since I am Sam (if that's her first movie) but i truly believe she'll she'll all her hater what she really got.|`|58lQPEilaa	i think she'll be the best at that part.<br>  if she knows how to play an evil role, she'll<br>  be perfect!|`|afexbc6Aaa	i think shell be bad but hey prove me otherwise|`|fuuJOf5Jaa	I actually pictured someone a little younger. Didn't S. Meyer say that Alec/Jane were very young and androgynous-looking? So I pictured them as kids who haven't gone through puberty yet. People keep saying that these grown men are "perfect" for the part of Alec. Isn't Alec Jane's TWIN? Therefore, Alec should  be the same age :||`|Y8HLBJaNaa	I can personally picture her as the character. From the movies I have seen, she is an excellent actress. I am very excited for New Moon!!
QtjnmEzoaa	8:00<br>  It's getting worse and worse actually as far as nothing happening. Amy has decided to keep the baby after a lot of wavering back and forth. Her mom got a job and is going to divorce her dad as soon as they can afford it.

DNxZuoOGaa	First off, it doesn't matter how much money you have when it comes down to singing and music. You have a good voice, but your music sounds a little 80s. You kind of have that Rick Astley voice, you know, that guy who sang "never gunna give you up, never gunna let you down, never gunna run around, and desert you". For being 16 years old, you still have some maturity to go through. When I was 16, my voice didn't sound like anything it does now. Personally, your voice doesn't suit the type of music you are making. Heres my break down...<br>  <br>  Voice - 8.5<br>  Music - 4.5<br>  <br>  Keep it up though. Don't let my opinion change your way.

oQSzZeubaa	Hi!  If you really don’t want to mess with your guitar yourself (see <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Guitar-Killswitch-Strat.-design/" rel="nofollow">http://www.instructables.com/id/Guitar-K...</a> for step-by-step directions, and <a href="http://www.sputnikmusic.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-468451.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sputnikmusic.com/forums/archi...</a> for some further discussion), take it to a local guitar repair shop.  Nothing against Guitar Center (or any other large retail outlet), but they will just send it out, and charge you more for being the middleman!  A good technician can incorporate the killswitch feature into your existing 5-way pickup selector switch, or add another switch if that is what you prefer.  Figure about $50-100 for the total cost, depending upon how you want it to function.  Make sure the installation is done properly (see <a href="http://www.stinkfoot.se/andreas/diy/mods/killswitch.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.stinkfoot.se/andreas/diy/mods...</a> for more details, and ask lots of questions), as bad wiring can turn you into a light bulb!

Singing is not one of the 5 elements of hip hop. Now don't get me wrong, some cuts mixed with r&b are cool, but for the most part its watered down. As for the the reputation, that's really in the mainstream. And folks who listen to mainstream judge hip hop for what they hear from the mainstream. They never try to listen to the underground hip hop in its purest form.|`|dOurKVdiaa	i think it made singers think they were harder, it also open some doors or the lane for a more Bobby Brown type singer, that whole im a badboy type singer, instead of the typical nice guy singer, so i think it helped the r&b side, but record sales hurt r&b in general<br>  <br>  Record companies are victims of trends, so when r&b(male) didnt sell as well, it became less of a priority. <br>  <br>  So the music as a whole suffers

C7CaNLGlaa	Yes, I've taken candy from a baby, I've run through the house with scissors, I'm not in Kansas anymore.  I give people both barrels and play hardball.  I don't have a problem with Houston, but then I'd never let the cat out of a bag if he's got my tongue. <br>  <br>  I realize in this economic downturn and in these tough times, some of what I say might cause a firestorm of controversy.  But as I said before, you have to hunker down, put your feet to the fire, and put your nose to the grindstone while it's raining cats and dogs.<br>  <br>  A penny saved is a penny earned so don't go counting your chickens before they're hatched, and it's not a good idea to have all your eggs in one basket anyway, even thought they might taste like chickens.  But if you act wisely, you'll be in the catbird seat, while having two birds in one hand, which is better than one in the bush.  And you can kill those two birds with one stone, which is better than having the Sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.<br>  <br>  Like they say, a penny saved is a penny earned.|`|3oUSroiZaa	It was like taking candy from a baby.|`|6mBpkt3Daa	babies cant eat candy they'd choke|`|WWCfdgd0aa	honestly?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  yes >:(|`|bxnMQQMJaa	lol.....yes, from my brother when I came home from school today.|`|AA11777484	No absolutely not!|`|5602144e6900d1d5b176081f58568a58aa	babies shouldn't have candy lol|`|TDo1EMJkaa	Nope.<br>  But I have stolen a baby from Candy.|`|1H8xK1ZZaa	no they cry too much.<br>  it would be to hard to do it an secret ;P|`|mHynYqOsaa	no because they would cry and get me in trouble|`|t65Rb2YNaa	lol noo i love kids(: <br>  thts kindaa meannnn haha|`|KS4a4QmLaa	nope|`|yq72XIhdaa	On several occasions.|`|BqHEeYA4aa	no.<br>  <br>  and i dont think babies should have candy to begin with....so i guess id take candy away from my own baby one day|`|09fdLaeIaa	no way<br>  i'd be grounded by my parents|`|cbQIzvrHaa	Well I have from my older brother... so yes.|`|Jv75CkI3aa	NEVER!!!

a1Ngi39Xaa	I have wondered this as well.  He did sign the birth certificate as the Father of the baby before he knew it was Billy's.  He entered into the marriage with Chloe only under the assumption that the baby was his.  I am not sure legally how much protection that gives him.  However, seeing Billy show up drunk at the hospital and showing Chloe as deliberately lying to him, could help him paint a picture of them as unfit parents, even though they are the biological parents.  If he divorces Chloe, he will be a one-parent household which is not always looked upon favorably in raising a child.  This is Soap Land, so this could drag on for awhile.  It may depend on if Chloe and Billy choose to start up their relationship again.  Rumor has it that Lily's birth control has failed her and she will end up pregnant by Billy.  That could also help Cane in his case showing that Billy is not committed to Chloe and unreliable and careless.  Cane has substantial financial resources so that will not be a problem for him.|`|houWY7qvaa	He has the right to sue for custody but he may not win since he is not the biological father.  The rights of the biological father and mother usually win out no matter who you think is right.|`|9FCxm8qJaa	I guess anyone can sue for anything, but I don't think he stands a chance in getting custody.  I know a couple and the woman got pregnant before they were married.  The guy married her thinking the baby was his.  When they got divorced he tried to get custody and she forced a blood test to prove he wasn't the father.  He was devastated, (understandably so) but did not get custody.  (Actually when he found out the child he was raising was not his child, I don't think he wanted custody anymore).  I don't think Cane will get custody - at least I hope he doesn't.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I think he has the right to sue if he wants, but given the fact that he was told the truth early before he has really bonded with the child, and Billy was not really told till later, and it is better he found out now then later but most of the blame will be on Chloe, and  Cane is the legal father by law it is going to be a mess, However Cane is not going to win and I hope he does not, because he needs to go back to his own life with Lily and not have his brothers kid hanging in his relationships and we don't need another repeat of Malcolm and Neil or Brad and Victor. I don't think Billy would stand by and watch another man raise his child.|`|b95adf9df97c91be72d1af840c313197aa	My husband and I have tossed this around; given that Billy will see a lawyer tomorrow (US- he sees Rafe), I can't see a split custody three ways....I told my hubby since histiry is repeating itself over and over, is it time to repeat the "phyllils loses custody of her bio-son to her husband, who is not the father, but b/c she's unfit? <br>  <br>  Could play out anyway at this point, but if Cane keeps throing temper tantrums, it could be used against him in court|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Emotionally, I would like him to have her.  But if he divorces Chloe, which I assume he is going to do, there is little choice that he will get anything but some visitation.  The real fight will be between Chloe and Billy.  Legally, Cane has no real rights to her, especially if Chloe puts Billy's name on the birth certificate.  <br>  <br>  All of that's talking real life law; on a soap, you never know.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	1) In this case, Cane could get Delia.<br>  <br>  In some states, if you are the father on the birth certificate then you are the legal father; the biological father is not. Chloe should not have signed the birth certificate until it was fixed.<br>  <br>  2) In this case, Billy could get the baby.<br>  <br>  Some states now have laws that state if you have scientific proof (i.e. DNA test) then, the above law no longer applies. <br>  <br>  I also read in some spoilers at daytimeroyaltyonline.com that Billy asks Chloe to marry him -- that would certainly strengthen their cause.<br>  <br>  3) Depending on how long Cane had Delia in number 1 above -- Cane could still get the baby.<br>  <br>  A man who raises a child as his own may be granted parental rights even if he is not a biological parent and the mother objects, the state Supreme Court ruled June 7, 2002.|`|3xOKvjzDaa	cheetah: actually he signed the birth certificate AFTER he knew the baby wasnt his. <br>  <br>  i think he has no right to sue. i understand hes hurt and loves the baby and chloe took him for a ride, but its chloes and billys baby. chloe didnt even tell billy he was the father. he had his suspicions. let billy and chloe raise their child. cane can be uncle. and cane and lily can have their OWN baby. i dont like cane or lily.|`|r7sgshwKaa	He may have the right but he won't win. Unless the father can prove to be unfit there's no logical way then he can get custody. He might can prove Billy and Chloe are both unfit parents considering the way she got pregnant and the scheme they used. That would be the only way I think he could get custody. I don't see it happening though. He can't stand the mother so why would he want the child anyway?|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I think he does not have the right, by him being so in shock and in denial, if the they take it to court I believe that judge is going to give the parental rights to Billy,  so basically I believe CAne done wated his time signing his name on the birth certificate.|`|ab2a840460fbbeb0af2b8c4445d4667baa	i do.  he is so dumb.  first amber takes him for a fool, then chloe gets her hooks on him.  they must love them big, cute and stupid

cdf99d56c45f3f4e746f613838231bc5aa	That cold exterior they put out is really just a wall to cover up their vulnerable feelings. Virgos always seem to want to appear cool and collected and seem to be like people who never trip. They're very careful about everything. I don't mean to offend, but they can be insecure worry-warts so sometimes they lie to make themselves appear to be something else-- so that whomever they're lying to will think positively of them or think they're so cool.

One was into some addictive habits, and the other was with somebody the family despised (abusive), so that is apparently their reason for lying to the family.|`|R1Fc344laa	i'm a virgo and i NEVER lie<br>  seriously. like not even a tiny lie. i'm blunt to a fault. <br>  so i dont know maybe it's the poeple ur hanging with my dear.|`|kXUwDLgWaa	the Uranus in there sign|`|7pYyXSBUaa	I'm cold hearted yes! <br>  Lie constantly No!|`|BJERgbM5aa	What you describe fits about half the people in my life.

In which case, you too, must be a virgo.|`|ErN3pbTeaa	I'm a virgo rising....and when I was younger I would lie to my friends constantly!...Even about stupid crap that I didn't need to lie about. I think the reason we lie so much (and its not just us) is because we don't want other people to know how boring we really are or what we are really thinking, so we make things up and lie to seem interesting or likable.

7ZLxV7Mtaa	i can say great, others can say great. but if you want feedback from real artists go to talent trove. my band is on there, we're just starting out, and the people on there really know. they've been getting paid to do this for a long time and they even helped me with my vocals. i transferred all of my youtube videos in a few seconds, they have this cool button that does it instantly. and the best thing is i was just on itunes because they have a radio station that only plays music made by users.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.talentrove.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.talentrove.com</a>|`|cHVyw0jkaa	Excellent and great potential!! Ok, so there were some sound problems (your guitar is drowning your voice out), but you could really make something out of that. Do you have a band? If you don't you should really consider getting one together unless you are dead set on being a solo artist. A band really helps (mine did)!

e4h5yVXgaa	Ugh... v carefully. I get turned off v easily.<br>  <br>  First assess the type of relationship you two are involved in.<br>  <br>  For example: I am dealing w a Capricorn, which started out nsa, and in this natural fashion wants it to transition to a commitment.<br>  Things that get on my nerves, is:<br>  <br>  He wanted me to go w him and some friends to see this band<br>  When we are in the car, he wants a kiss<br>  Wants to go out on dates<br>  Has become my slave in bed<br>  Tells me I can come over his house anytime (his house; is my house)<br>  I talked about working more, he responded oh that means I wont get to see you as much (I see him 1-2 times a week).<br>  I was talking about my siblings, he said you'd probably make a good mother<br>  Mentions innuendos about marriage<br>  <br>  I mean all sorts of crap that ppl who are in a nsa relationship would not navigate... I am tired of him. I don't want to even have sex w him anymore. Now if I were crazy about him then all that would be different.<br>  <br>  Even if you are dating your Scorpio exclusively- keep the mystery alive!! Especially in the beginning. Let him chase you. Flirt w him sexy and mysteriously, in  a way that makes him think: "What did she mean by that?". When it comes time to be affectionate, do it sporadically, hold his hand out the blue (if he does it, just to do it, beware). If he clings to your hand, then he's feeling you. Just cautiously make efforts to show your affections and feel out his reactions. A Scorpio that likes you will react passionately to you, even if he has to keep it under wraps. Smile and look him confidently in the eye. If he doesn't smile back, or at least look shy or get nervous (get tense) then you are in trouble. It's sort of a thin line. Scorpio's try to hide their feelings, so if he gives you a look not good. But if he gives you a look, but you see that gleam in his eye, that's good. It's pretty easy to know when a Scorpio is giving you a green light.<br>  <br>  I absolutely LOVE when a man looks me confidently (if the confidence is genuine) in the eye and smiles!! (IF I like him)|`|CYyVD0ADaa	I know what you mean, I always feel awkward hugging or being affectionate to a Scorpio. I don't know why..<br>  I think small gestures go a long way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Libra x|`|AA10923010	Is this your first boyfriend?????|`|AA10197672	Try to show him how much you love him by doing the simplest things. I'd like it when my BF calls me up out of blue to see how I am doing, brings small things for me to surprise me, holds me, kisses me and tells me that he loves me. We like to both hear and see the love from our partner. So if you only try to show it by your actions is not enough for a scorpio, we like to hear it as well! You have to be careful to not bring out the jealous side of scorpio, you know how some girls like to talk to other guys to make their own guy jealous? well that wont work with a scorpio, as he will be very hurt. We are VERY sensitive, and once hurt we wil never forget. Our love could be very strong, we'll put our heart out there and will pretty much do anything to see a smile on our partners face, however be careful and do not cross us! AS you've heard we have the tail that stings, so do not try to do something to hurt us. We can change in less than a min and become v ery cold depending on how you treat us. We analyze everything and want to be sure the person we are with loves us back, once we feel comfortable putting our trust in you, and trust you, then don't worry about us looking elsewhere for a mate. We are also VERY loyal, and will not tolerate cheating or betrayal. Scorpio is very passionate and very romantic! We also love when our partner gets romantic. Sometimes a scorpio might look very quiet to you and you might not be able to figure him out,. Try talking to him, make him feel comfortable to talk to you abut anything! We like to have that bond with our mates.Hope that helped...|`|cE9QIMNiaa	i'm a scorpio and i know that i show love in many different ways.  I don't handle big romantic gestures..they make me feel uncomfortable.  For me, a way a lover can show me love is just simply by giving me attention and holding me, snuggling me, making me laugh.  stuff like that.  and as far as kissing and stuff like that, i thought i was normal?  i mean its not really that hard, just go for it.  Scorpio's tend to be a little introverted when it comes to romantically, all you have to do is break through the barrier and you'll be fine.  if a scorpio feels comfortable with you, you'll know it.

tQ9CnPfyaa	Guys are just weird like that. If u want to continue being friends with him, then just write him a note back - if u ask him in person, it might make the situation worse. On the note, just write something like "I don't really understand how I annoy you. Did I do something wrong? If I did, plz tell me and I'll try to fix it. You're my friend, and I don't want us to fight. If it's really what you want, then I'll stay away for a while. But plz tell me what I did to make you mad at me. I'm sorry for whatever it is I did". If he reads it in front of his friends and acts like he's not interested in writing back, he's just trying to act cool in front of his friends. Give him some time. If he was just joking, or believes that u really didn't know what u did wrong, then he'll write back. If he doesn't, then just ignore him for a while. People like that aren't good to hang out with anyways. If he thinks of ur friendship the same way you do, then he'll try to fix it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  P.S. DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT tell him what is above in quotes in person. It'll make everything worse.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!|`|ZAUcZziLaa	well, i think that he was a fake through the whole beginning an doesn't know what he's doing. <br>  or maybe he likes you and feels that he can't be around you because you guys need to seperate so that he can ask you out later in the year.<br>  or maybe his friends don't like you and he could either be friends over you.<br>  <br>  sorry for you no more friend thing hope your feeling well??<br>  i don't really know how to put it.|`|JyDIrXzeaa	Well, you prolly shouldn't have read it, cuz it was meant for when you were both on the bus together.... confront him about it and see what he says.. maybe it was just a joke. If not, he's a coward for pretending to be your friend for so long when he actually found you annoying.|`|U4dHE6Kwaa	It means he is selfiish and couldnt tell you something to your face thats why he wrote it down and asked were you going on the bus! so he wouldnt have to face you.<br>  hes not worth it at all find a real driend :D<br>  like me lol|`|NDkBHwidaa	It may be hard to accept but people do change. Maybe he saw you as a less appealing friend and decided he needed a new crowd of people to hang out with. Try and talk to him about it. (It could be a joke too)|`|iW0qemXXaa	maybe you talk alot or did something in front of somebody he likes???|`|EOL6PEvgaa	it mean he doesn't want to talk to you<br>  for some reason...so listen to him!|`|d1tyTq6Saa	well, r u embarrasing him there????? if u r, they hate that!|`|Z9Vf2xZbaa	Well first of all, if he was serious, this guys a total dumb a** for not jus saying it up front. I know, you might be freaked out, cuz i would be too, but the only thing you can really do is ask him about it. For all you know, it might be a dare, or it might be a joke for something that was going to happen "on the bus". either way, if it is real, you dont need a jerk like that as a friend anyway. hope this helps!! :)|`|08mXR4UAaa	Well maybe he is just tired of you. Im not saying that you are anything but maybe he just doesnt like you as a friend anymore. maybe you should slip a note into his bookbag and say something like your annoying dont talk to me ever AGAIN!!!!!. thats my best answer, hope it helps!!! :D|`|y3P2FgMpaa	It depends on how close you guys are, and other things.<br>  If you guys are close and joke around like that then its probably just a joke.<br>  If you guys aren't that close then its probably not a hoax. Why would you want a friend like that anyways? I bet you won't know him in ten years anyways.|`|0imzZgpXaa	it means he doesnt want to be your friend!<br>  hey its no big deal - this stuff happens all the time to people.<br>  you know what though? he is obviously not mature enough to talk to you about this so he isnt a great friend anyway - ditch him and thank your lucky stars.<br>  he doesnt deserve you.|`|uwFldGDeaa	If you have known him for 2 years and he just decided to give you that note, their is probably another reason for him to not want you ta talk to him. Maybe you should talk to him and find out. Good Luck!|`|AQlA6nu0aa	I think you are embarassing him, and he needs some space. But if he really hates you, try to ask him why when you are alone.|`|N5mU7VdXaa	uhh..wow. that's pretty straight up. so...he thinks you're annoying. Just find another crowd of friends that are annoying too.|`|TjAszHWYaa	ok this is a prob but u might try 2 stay away from him for a while or not as Much hell get a new point of View|`|PuBllrGIaa	umm wow thants kinda mean but make sure you dont make him feel bad when you go on the bus with him|`|2557b856c1b079ace27a693caab01d94aa	This guy is NOT your friend...lol|`|aizHCizlaa	You are in 5th grade?|`|nZmr9okpaa	ask him!!|`|EJJtCUKHaa	Maybe just tone it down a little.<br>  <br>  guys can be annoyed or intimidated easily .<br>  Don't take it too hard tho, he might just be going through a tough time.<br>  the bus part... beats me :O<br>  <br>  maybe he didn't want your friends too see it so he wouldn't embarrass you, if that is the case I dont think he was trying to be mean.|`|gM3tw8Ifaa	He's afraid you like him and he doesn't want you to like him and he was hoping girls on the bus would see it letting them know he's single or whatev <br>  <br>  just a theory :P|`|LAyigK5Aaa	This is in the jokes and riddles area!|`|Pm21qsddaa	it means "you're annoying, dont talk to me"

XdMcYDgbaa	because i have been a gemini for 20 years...i can only tell that Gemini do not tolerate drama...or the slightest of problems. You say you guys had some problems recently..."chaching"...you hit the jack pot. <br>  <br>  i know this friend of mine...actually we were best friends..this was like 2 days ago...she accused me of something that was not true...when I think about it it is a very silly thing to make an issue about...right after she accused me of that thing I immediately said I am leaving and did not talk to her since.<br>  <br>  all am saying is that it seems that something similar is goin around with you...probably he wants an end...but who knows maybe he is different.<br>  <br>  but i hope it works with you guys|`|F4mgVTgzaa	Hes sucha loser. he texted u that. he has no balls to say that to your face. Honestly thats low enough. Move on.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	No he wants to spend time on his own, sorting his mind, issues emotionally, mentally and maybe from outside things until he refreshes his mind then he would get back in touch with you.<br>  <br>  It's not like "you're both on a break" on the relationship whereby you both start to date someone else and definately not a "break up" he would have told you so if he wanted that but he didn't, did he?<br>  <br>  Don't get the idea of him dating or sleeping around or something. Gemin's are known and named a lot of things but they do like being in relationships so don't worry. This space could do you good too, just to shake off anything that is bothering you, or catch up with things, friends etc.<br>  <br>  Just try and text him once in a while like you're thinking of him etc. <br>  hope it works out for both of you<br>  xx|`|AA10923010	Babe give him space and get up and do something wonderful for yourself.<br>  <br>  Assert your individuality with out getting crazy.<br>  <br>  Just a small question. Have you resolved the problem you both were having recently?<br>  <br>  If not try looking at your point of view and try looking at his also honestly and if you need, talk to a really honest male friend about the point of contention between you and you BF you may get an eye opener as to your situation.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	What a load of bollocks- it doesn't mean he wants to see other people. It may just mean what it says- he needs a break.

I can help you more with that information<br>  <br>  PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ANY GEMINIS OR HAVE THE MIND OF A GEMINI DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. <br>  <br>  Ignore the pathetic negative answers, I have three Gemini family Members a Gemini partner and my best friend who I've known for my whole life is Gemini. I am Libra.<br>  <br>  Listen if a Gemini asks for space they need it. Give them time to come to a decision about what they think of the relationship, Geminis don't like boundaries or being tied down. Give them space don't ignore them completely but be aware they are becoming overwhelmed by commitment and boundaries. They just need to relax, let them do so. Carry on with your life don't let it get you down. Wait for them to come back around (he should do). They find commitment hard to deal with. Chances are he does love you very much, he just needs time to stop and think..<br>  <br>  good luck.<br>  <br>  Libra who knows Gems back to front.|`|cjk4eZWvaa	Babe, give up on this Gemini.  He is playing the field and that is his way of ending the relationship.  He will not come out and tell you that it is over.  He is beating around the bush.  If you ignore him, he would be more likely to start hanging around you again.  If you try too hard to get him back, he will run like the Dickens!  Give him lots of space.|`|uSxrmpNBaa	I'ma gemini and my advice is move on gemini guys usually do really fast so he probally wants to break up|`|bdzG1VEDaa	That means "I want to see other people" in English.

NQ37mnWkaa	Yet again, it's the current trend. <br>  One female singer did it {either Amy Winehouse or Joss Stone}, and all the rest have been thrown onto the bandwaggon to ride the popular wave. Some manage it better than others ~ I dispute Adele's ability as a 'singer'...<br>  <br>  The thing is, I'd rather have the *originals* than the mass-marketed impersonators.|`|CZszdtemaa	Nah but some of it reminds me of that 80s ****.|`|I2GVAdstaa	you're not imagining it a lot of singers bring out that style to pop.it probably because they like the style but they had to mix their style in it as well.no they are not as good as the people back then but they have a younger audience most of them weren't alive back then. so they have to give them what they like|`|AA10509738	Yes you are correct the majority of those artists wear their influnces on their sleeve. I'm Huge fan of Gillian Welch and alot of her music has that 1930's Mountain Sound to it, kinda reminiscent of the Blue Sky Boys & Similar Artists of that time.|`|73760ec70f62b217eab4a5ab28ce822baa	Yes, in fact the backbeat to Duffy's "Mercy" sounds a lot like Ben E. King's "Stand By Me" which was a hit in the early 60's.

ej6OdnDBaa	i would much rather get the one your friend is selling because the speakers arent that great ( i have one) also, the new one is supposed to be coming out next fall so you may want to wait. or not. and no you can exchange the old one for the new one. there has to be something wrong with it for them to exchange it or give you store credit. as far as trading in the ipod, its not worth it because wherever you trade it in, they wont give you  nearly as much as someone in the street you may know.|`|hoRxOOo9aa	I say buy ur friends and wait for the new one to come out.

However, one night this huge scary looking fish comes and ends up eating all the eggs, and the wife dies. One egg is left- Nemo. <br>  Flash forward a few years and Nemo is ready to start school. Marlin takes him, but is very very overprotective of him. Nemo makes some new friends and they find a boat out in the open water. The friends are all seeing who can get the furthest out towards it (the best part is that they call it a butt "Oooh, I'm gonna touch the buuutt!") Then Marlin comes and yells at Nemo, so Nemo in defiance, goes out and smacks the boat with his fin. On the way back to his friends and dad, a fisherman comes up behind him and captures him. <br>  I don't remember at which part he finds Dory... actually, it's pretty soon after that because Marlin is swimming frantically trying to catch the boat and then meets Dory.|`|D4eFh7Qlaa	marlin and his wife cora i think it was.. moved into a coral reef and a barracuda came and ate his wife and killed all of his babies except for nemo.. then marlin lets nemo go to school and nemo gets mad at marlin because marlin has separation issues. and in anger nemo went and touch a boat that was in the drop off. the scuba driver stole nemo and marlin went swimming thru the ocean trying to follow the boat and then ran into dory.|`|eoBUQlZFaa	Marlin and his wife Cora moe into a reef awaiting he birth of their babies.<br>  But a barracuda comes and eats the wife and all the babies except one, called Nemo.<br>  Marlin is very protective of Nemo and is iffy about letting him go to school, but in the ned he does.<br>  Nemo later on gets mad and swims out into a really deep part of th sea to proove he is capable of doing things himself and not a woos.<br>  He then gets caught by a scuba diver and is taken onto a boat and put in a dentists fish tank in Sydney.<br>  Marlin, seeing his son being taken away, swims after till he looses the boat and beings to wander out around confused asking if anyone has seen his son, he then crashes into dory and they meet.

Oyvlt2vyaa	Jacob = werewolf.  And he goes off to protect fight Victoria (James' mate from Twilight) because she wants to kill Bella in revenge for James' death (a mate for a mate).  So Bella goes cliff diving on her own, and Alice sees this.  Alice can't see werewolves and so doesn't know that when Bella gets into difficulties, she is pulled to safety by Jacob.  She comes to see Charlie, to comfort him, only to find Bella.  Rosalie told Edward that Bella was dead, so he heads off to kill himself at the Volturi. Bella then goes chasing round the world to stop him, and suceeds.  But the Vulturi take them in their lair, have some suspense on if their all gonna die and then free them.  Happily ever after, if Jacob hadn't had an arguement with Bella and left her bike for her dad to see.  I'd advise reading it, it gets better.  And Edward does come back to Forks.  The next two books are amazing, so don't let this one put you off.|`|UyubgNZWaa	Def not the best book.<br>  I'm not giving anything away, force yourself to read it. :)|`|LO1OYHETaa	This is going to ruin it for you, but yes, Edward comes back,

pRNm3joBaa	Hi.<br>  I've listened to quite a few 50s songs. It does seem the tenor has a bit of an advantage here. Producing those low, deep sounds. However you could produce the same soulful sound with an alto.  There is a girl whom plays a mean alto if youre interested in listening to her. Then you can compare with some of the sounds of the 50s groups.<br>  I provided you with a link.<br>  Enjoy.

d9mi76Jzaa	Until her brother is in more tabloids( or any tabloids) then he's not more famous than her.What makes you think he's more popular? The fact that he's had ONE hit sondefinitelyget me wrong, his band is definatly awesome but Miley's done it longer, and she's done it better. Not to mention her new movie, her trip to the oscars her numerous CD's, hit television series.....plus all the merchandise. See Miley feels damn good that she's still more popular than her bro.|`|5R8TtVpMaa	I honestly don't think that Metro Station is more popular than Miley Cyrus, it just depends on who you're asking. I personally don't like her, but Metro Station rocks! But Miley sounds like a stereotypical celebrity, who thinks they are the apple of everyones eyes... So I'm not sure if she realizes, but if she does, she's probably a little proud, but also a little jealous, and probably mad and left out.|`|mmrF8ZYdaa	Well, Miley and Trace are both famous in different circles of people - Miley, with young girls, and Trace with an older audience. But I think that as Miley continues on in the celebrity spotlight, her audience is going to change - because obviously her actions are getting sort of inappropriate for young girls.|`|D2C0OSenaa	she's more popular (even though i don't get why trace is a lot better.)|`|mZUXkeyRaa	I disagree with you<br>  Miley is wayy more popular than her brother<br>  Not very many people talk about him<br>  If anything, she is the one everyone talks about the most|`|nhZb43pIaa	First, he isn't more popular and will have trouble reaching Mileys type of fame.<br>  Second, I'm sure she would be pleased with her brothers success,,, who wouldn't be.<br>  She is rich, she is famous, she has had her day in the spot light.<br>  I'm sure she's a pretty happy young girl.|`|3ok7pKMNaa	Trace is NOT more popular than Miley.

hQWucH5uaa	It is about a group of retired superheroes (actually only one, Dr. Manhattan, has any superpowers) who talk a lot about the old days.  They have gotten old, bored, and out of shape.  Some are sick, some are dying, and all are being stricken with life-problems which plague every normal human being on Earth (lonliness, regret, nostaligia, growing old and alone, rebellious children, long-term unemployment, disillusionment, generation gap, being forgotten and misunderstood, etc. etc.).<br>  <br>  All of a sudden it occurs to one of the 'heroes' that someone is bumping off former masked-heroes.  And that sets the tone for this long, boring morality play which has something negative to say about American history from WWII, Viet Nam, Nixon, and finally the Cold War.<br>  <br>  THE WATCHMEN tries too hard to be profound with some excellent special effects but long tedious philosophical speeches about the meaning of life and the nature of the universe; most of which you probably already discussed in College 101 philosophy and history courses.|`|0qN0eUbUaa	basically its a 3 hour long mystery movie/ apparent porno seeing as there is a penis in nearly all of Dr. Manhattan's scenes and the unnecessarily drawn out sex scenes . Its best to read the graphic novel first so you will understand the story better|`|ftXZAgWsaa	In a gritty and alternate 1985 the glory days of costumed vigilantes have been brought to a close by a government crackdown, but after one of the masked veterans is brutally murdered an investigation into the killer is initiated. The reunited heroes set out to prevent their own destruction, but in doing so discover a deeper and far more diabolical plot.|`|CRDl9nffaa	Do you mean 'Winky the Watchman', the educational movie about dentistry from the 40s?<br>  <br>  ... sorry, Im just messing with you:) I know you really mean 'Watchmen' ...<br>  <br>  It's about 2 hours 43 minutes|`|i6Th0lItaa	Superheroes.

YwtXSUAdaa	Yeah, you'll look back on it....if you're still alive.<br>  <br>  Personally, I wouldn't, but that's just me. You asked the question so you obviously want to. So, if you want to and you don't care that there's a chance you will die, then do it.|`|fQEn8PCHaa	Do it! It's obvious you want to. You'll never know how fun it is until you try! <br>  <br>  It'll probably be one of those great memories you look back at during one of the best shows you went to. Those are priceless.
zBkaqIWcaa	According to Wikipedia:<br>  Most of the first scenes in the film were shot at Lake Powell and Glen Canyon located in Utah, as well as locations near Page, Arizona. The scenes of the crew paddling away from their crashed ship were shot on Lake Powell. The ape village was constructed and filmed on the Fox Ranch in Malibu Creek State Park, northwest of Los Angeles. The concluding beach scenes, including the remains of the Statue of Liberty, were shot near Point Dume, at the south end of Zuma Beach in Malibu.[|`|c46a3306019576b6a3287e4193fcde3faa	The Statue of Liberty was in it so I guess they covered New York in sand and filmed it there:)|`|7VIgsTEAaa	Here:<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063442/locations" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063442/loca...</a>|`|Htvrh3nQaa	i think it was filmed in tenerife at mount teide|`|jSPj3S6faa	Earth... that was the pucnchline at the end of the movie, right?|`|pg5k0E6Daa	Hi!

It's pretty much always girls. And what really pisses me off is that it is usually an AC/DC shirt, which is one of my favorite bands.|`|x8mHnT2jaa	that's so annoying...like i hate when my sister wearing my Motley Crue and Papa Roach shirts because she doesn't listen to them! i also hate when people wear WWE shirts and don't watch wrestling...also hate when that's there favorite band and they only know one song...it's so annoying!|`|DibFrwxlaa	I suppose people are free to wear whatever they please.<br>  <br>  It used to bother me though when Urban Outfitters sold all those CBGB shirts and in pop culture wearing a CBGB shirt became synonymous with being a rebel and nonconformist even though the damn shirt was from Urban Outfitters.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	This is why HOT TOPIC should be closed down.

KkZE2NDYaa	People who didn't "get it" were convinced that jazz was associated with immoral behavior. The places it was mostly played were also places that served alcohol, which was illegal for part of that time period. It was just a different lifestyle that many people didn't approve of. The same thing happened with Elvis and early rock and roll, The Beatles and similar bands because of their long hair, and rap and hip hop when it was new.|`|akUVg7CEaa	A part of the controversy was the acceptance of things that come out of African American culture.  Think about how rap is perceived today.  I chuckle at how people who will tell you they hate rap music, don't understand that their grand-parents and great-grand-parents were hating Jazz and blues music that we all love today.<br>  <br>  Jazz at that time was integrating bands, it was introducing themes that were not typical of popular music.  It was dance music (where the dancers touched each other), which again was not something that the general public embraced.|`|e7KoyoWsaa	There are a lot of social reason why it was controversial, I'm sure, and I know nothing about them....<br>  <br>  Up until that time music has always had rules.  The distance between notes in a minor or major scale - the timing of a piece and the rhythm of it.  You could practically play a song mathematically.  Jazz broke all those rules.  They made instruments used to playing classical pieces in set timing play sporadic an haphazardly.  They re-wrote the book on scales and keys.  They turned everything upside down, and people didn't like it.

He's just the kind of person who is so good to everyone, and so content with life that it's almost freaky.<br>  And his girlfriend is cool, too, because she doesn't try to get him to stop hanging out with me, like so many of the girlfriends do!<br>  <br>  I'd really like to say my Mom, but she married my dad...|`|967aae0d16dea5cecb00409736b6dcb0aa	My husband of nearly 28 years. <br>  <br>  Not long after we married and we had just had our third child, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had to have 14 operations in the following 4 years and was in the hospital more than I was home. He took care of our three daughters and ran the household while holding down a full time job. When I would come home from the hospital I was very ill and he would take his lunch hour to run home, change my I.V. lines (which he had to take special classes to learn to do) and then race back to work. <br>  <br>  He was always there for me and even today he still continues to help. I am much better now and the cancer is gone but there are days when I can't do everything because we are now raising 2 of our 8 grandchildren. On those days, he comes home from working a 12 hour day and helps out in any way he can. He does the dishes after dinner, helps with the laundry, bathes the kids at night and so on. <br>  <br>  I could have never made it through it all without him and I am forever grateful that he chose me to be his wife. I can only hope that I can repay him for all the love, understanding and compassion that he has given me through the years. He has never held my illness against me and on my bad days, he never gets angry with me.|`|AA12354590	M y dear kind best friend who always know how to cheer me up with a phone call or text even though he is hundreds of miles away :-(|`|4rdKpvPGaa	Agent Orange.

SkRJNhuCaa	Can I also sensor your essay and remove anything I don't like from it?<br>  <br>  Because that's the flipside of the coin, when you start censoring something you're soon using the censorship weapon to stifle ANY dissent and expression of opinions that don't agree with your own.<br>  <br>  Which means the end of democracy (what's left of it) and the imposition of dictatorship.|`|AA11210400	No. Music is the greatest form of expression known to man. It can really have an impact on society. If your going to be censored....then whats the point?....|`|tqfkHiEQaa	Freedom of Speech. No lyrics should not be censored. Like anything else, if you don't like it, don't listen/watch/read etc.|`|WcTZ7n8waa	No they shouldn't. You have the right to say whatever you want. It's not your fault if somebody else doesn't like it.|`|5rEV8FgDaa	Well It depends I would say no but if the Jonas Brothers(GAY)said I Fu#king hate you then yeah|`|vGsKgZsdaa	i think that lyrics should not be censored!!!|`|hUYaaXBvaa	technically we have freedom of speech<br>  but anything deemed 'offensive' for public consumption, mostly because of the whole presence of children thing, is censored anyways<br>  theres not complete censorship though, as you can easily buy music with its full content under the protective label 'explicit'<br>  so that kind of allows them to censure as a kind of excuse, as you still can hear it in its completion, just for private consumption|`|s5IjyOygaa	no. no. no. never.
Drg3bLjUaa	Smilez and Southstar's hit, "Tell Me", sampled from the Gaye/Diana Ross version. A second sample of that version of the song, at least the music, was by Ja Rule and Ashanti with their joint hit, "Mesmerized". 50 Cent also sampled it in his song, "Ghetto Qu'ran (Forgive Me)".<br>  <br>  smilez vid on youtube:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLvuTVVcrSQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLvuTVVcr...</a>
vqK2Ibseaa	Sadly no. There was a blurb during the credits of the 99th episode saying something along the lines of "Just wait until the 100th episode." And that was the last episopde they did. And I think that the end of Wakko's Wish was good, made me tear up a little. Just seeing that all the characters got what they wanted made me happy.|`|MTr4dy3naa	no.|`|DPcIjHHZaa	i haven't hear about Animaniacs for about 5 year now so i don't know what to tell you.|`|3d08f723b68ad148961c0b43f85f6ab2aa	I don't think there is any new project it has been over 10 yrs ago i sure do miss that cartoon though.
4umqDBCiaa	Oh I remember that. It was called Finders Keepers. It had a big house and was a lot of fun top watch|`|sGdeWs5iaa	I am not sure, but if you have Time Warner Cable then you can go to Kids on Demand Preschool (channel 1153).  Under "BBC Kids" there are lots of British kid shows.
HtGpTPM4aa	Yea im a big Blade fan too but, the series got cancelled bummer it was good too but, I dont think there gonna continue it. If you want a good action horror show watch Supernatural it's way better peace :)

A petal, the stars that shine in the sky<br>  Just poke at my wounds<br>  What I wanted to tell you the most<br>  Was that I’d never fall in love again<br>  <br>  That station where we’d meet<br>  And hide under an umbrella in the rain<br>  Is a place I can’t go to by myself anymore<br>  <br>  “I loved you,” I don’t need a letter with that past tense phrase<br>  If you’re kind when we break up, I’ll want you to stay with me<br>  I’ll be all alone in a place where you’ll never return<br>  Waiting for that day<br>  And sing that nostalgic song in a quiet voice<br>  <br>  Saying that I’d never fall in love again was a lie<br>  And I was joking when I said I couldn’t forget you<br>  In the end, I don’t want to forget you, I want to love you<br>  <br>  I want to see you, I miss you, we’re apart<br>  That day’s smiles flutter to the ground<br>  You promised it would last forever but you’re not here anymore<br>  <br>  I’m in our room as the radio plays that song<br>  And the tears begin to pour on their own<br>  The smile on your face as you left is what I miss the most<br>  <br>  Let’s make the cherry blossoms bloom and fall<br>  I can escape my weak self<br>  I’ll sing a melody with the sound of tears<br>  A spring song plays on the radio, it’s that time of the year again<br>  I’ve accepted your goodbye<br>  A page in my memories will always be colored bright|`|T2vZu6F2aa	Haru ni sakimasu kibou no sakura <br>  Hana mo arashi mo sakasemasu <br>  Hirari-harari to yume fukuramase <br>  Anata to watashi tsunagimasho <br>  <br>  Natsu ni sakimasu mabushii sakura <br>  Ai to yuuki ga sakasemasu <br>  Kirari-kirari to yume kagayakase <br>  Ashita no niji wo watarimasho <br>  <br>  * Tsuyoku hageshiku yasashiku sakura <br>  Saite misemasu Sakura Sakura <br>  Sakura-iro <br>  <br>  Aki ni sakimasu kurenai sakura <br>  Akai yuuhi ni sakasemasu <br>  Yaburiyaburare yume kujikete mo <br>  Namida wo fuite utaimasho <br>  <br>  Fuyu ni sakimasu yukiwari sakura <br>  Muku na kokoro de sakasemasu <br>  Takaku kewashiku yume tookute mo <br>  Anata ga ireba noboremasu <br>  <br>  <br>  Tsuyoku hageshiku yasashiku sakura <br>  Saite misemasu Sakura Sakura <br>  Sakura-iro <br>  <br>  Tsuyoku hageshiku yasashiku sakura <br>  Saite misemasu Sakura Sakura <br>  Sakura-iro<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope this is it......
AA11402617	Nurses<br>  For three seasons NBC had three related shows on Saturday night, the Golden Girls, and it's spin off Empty nest, and a spin off of that show, Nurses.  On several occasions the three shows kind of all melted together like once when a hurricane was hitting Miami and another time when we had "full moon saturday".  I miss those good saturday night shows. The cast of nurses changed during it's three year run.|`|64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	In 1988 and 1989, Golden Girls and Empty Nest were on Saturdays at 9 and 9:30 respectively, followed by Hunter.<br>  <br>  In 1990 and 1991, they were still on at the same time, but followed by Carol and Company (Carol Burnett's variety show) and American Dreamer.<br>  <br>  In 1992, Golden Girls went off the air and Empty Nest moved to 9pm with Nurses following at 9:30.|`|0yBvm90qaa	Not sure when it began following them, but "Nurses" which was also a spin-off of Empty Nest (which was obviously both a spin-off and sister show ) of Golden Girls.....it was an o.k. show.....
mMzXeOhmaa	One fine day, possibly with george clooney <3|`|9FP39p8Caa	The Movie you are looking for is "One Fine Day" (1996) starring Michelle Pfeiffer, and George Clooney.|`|hkYmuq1Uaa	It's in the movie "One Fine Day" starring Michelle Pfeifer and George Clooney, but I can't remember the scene. I just know cause it's on my soundtrack. Sorry I couldn't be more help. Hope this is what you're looking for.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I love that song (and I THINK it was recorded in the 60's but I could be wrong.)  It was in a bunch of movies.  Two that came up on google where One fine day, and Because I said so.  Hope that helps.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	I dont know if this is the movie you're referring to but the movie Gifted Hands with Cuba Gooding Junior has that song in it.

ZmmhPX6caa	Public performing can be rough.  I don't know how many people will be in your audience.  If it is just the teacher/judge and a few other students, just try to tune them all out and imagine you are just sitting in your room playing for the fun of playing.  <br>  <br>  If it is a large group, pick 3 or 4 people out in the crowd.  It's best if they are sitting in different places.  And just play to them.  <br>  <br>  Also, positive visualization works really well.  Just imagine yourself doing the piece(s) perfectly in your mind.  Picture the judge there watching you and you giving them a flawless performance.  Do this a couple times a day before the performance.  If your mind starts to wander and you start having thoughts about failing, just relax and start over.|`|HhVmI21oaa	haha lols i play clarinet and sing for school choir and i always feel sick to my stomach  what i do is i look at one person in the crowd or an object and i pretend thats the only thing that i see that nothing else is in the room exept me and that object

Also my ticket stubs: ]<br>  <br>  I display the stuff in my closet lol so I know nothing will happen to it<br>  and I do that because it's special to me and it may be worth something<br>  one day|`|A1PLJKhUaa	1. The emotion, the passion. Rock is one of the only genres where there is VERY few guidelines - it's not like rap, where you're pretty confined - in rock you can write WHATEVER you want to whatever beat you want, you can scream, you can whisper. Where rock is invovled, people write what they feel and that's what makes it so amazing. Come on, dude, rock started revolutions in grunge, punk! What other genre could have done that, eh?!<br>  <br>  2. Not souvenirs as such...do albums and plectrums count lol?<br>  <br>  3. Idk if these count as souvenirs but I should very much like to be rich and buy and collect guitars that belonged to Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, and all of those amazing people, plus Panic at the Disco and my other guilty pleasures...<br>  <br>  4. Not entirely sure how to answer question 4 as I don't particularly collect!|`|UEqiglhCaa	The music can be very strong. Strong instruments, strong lyrics. I love the loud music and screaming.<br>  <br>  Well I collect all the ticket stubs or bracelets from all the shows I go to. I have about 80 from the past 3 years. I also sort of "collect" posters. I have about 20-25 posters that I get from shows. I havent bought any of them.<br>  <br>  I dont know what I would want to have most but I think the ticket stubs and bracelets is what i have the most.<br>  <br>  I keep my ticket stubs in a box and the posters I have are up on my wall. Not all of them though.|`|CEJfiHmJaa	its full of magic and wonder <br>  its nothing like the genres<br>  the guitar is the main part for me its not rock without a guitar <br>  not yet only 14|`|9hFexadLaa	the sound and passion<br>  <br>  kind of<br>  <br>  famous rockstar statue things<br>  <br>  display man|`|sVSjpnTEaa	The passion, the touring, and having a good affinity with your fans.<br>  <br>  I collect anything I can catch at Rock gigs, plus ticket stubs, concert programmes. Including my 'Deep Purple' Knebworth '85 ticket stub, an Iron Maiden 'World Slavery Tour '84/'85 programme, and a Bass plectrum that was once lucky enough to belong to Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy fame.<br>  <br>  I'd love to own one of John Bonhams drumsticks,or even a small splinter would suffice.<br>  <br>  I don't display them in any way. They remain safe, hidden, and closely guarded, until the right person arrives, and then they emmerge to be wondered over and touched. Treasures made of Rock Legends and memories stored with care as a window to great times and emotions of the past. Simple.|`|YY806Xn0aa	ok, first off don't stereotype Rock music like alot of people do<br>  Rock can be used in many different ways and Rock is pure music, rarely and effects or computerised sounds are added, and if they are its done tastefully..<br>  and Rock music has formed other Genres such as indie [my fave], Alternative, heavy metal, death and thrash metal, emo, PopRock<br>  <br>  its by far the most versatile Genre<br>  <br>  oh, and i don't collect souvenirs.. xD|`|hlKEZAp6aa	rock and metal music is superior to all other forms of music because of its energy and the passion thats gone into it. all modern pop and rap is just created by record labels and they just get good looking people to stand in the videos and let a computor make them sound good. rock is also fantastic to watch live.<br>  <br>  i dont really collect anything to do with rock but i did find a guitar signed by all 9 members of slipknot (my favourite band ever) on ebay but i was outbid at the last second. gutted!|`|DKDOj3rxaa	pop music is manufactured they all sound the same nothing unique or any thing that stands out<br>  <br>  rap music is too slow for me and i dont like most of the rappers their selves<br>  <br>  rock bands are unique they dont follow new waves of music and it fast and energetic, i have lots of repect for most rock bands its a shame that rock is stereotyped with nutters.<br>  <br>  well i dont collect anything but i have posters/cd's/t shirts which i take ok care of<br>  <br>  ps: why do all pop bands say we rock?|`|LjbT96VOaa	I think it's special because it conveys emotions I feel at the moment I listen to it.

Now I'm a pretty emotional guy (I was raised by just my mom and two sisters not to mention my ex jacked me up in the head a wee bit so cut me break) so from time to time I like to just listen to a sad song and cry or listen to something hard and just go apeshit. That's how I vent and when I can't vent my blood starts to boil and all I wanna do is kill something.<br>  <br>  I don't have any rock souvenirs although I once caught an Oregon Ducks hat that Sully Erna the singer of Godsmack threw out to the crowd.<br>  <br>  As for what I would like to have the most. I dunno I wouldn't mind getting my hands on somethin' like Aaron Lewis' guitar pick. He's the singer of Staind.|`|JpC7ljoaaa	Henry Rollins once said: -<br>  <br>  "I wanna listen to music that makes me wanna fu*k on the floor and kill my parents"<br>  <br>  That pretty much does it for me!<br>  <br>  I collect memories, like being at Donington Monsters of Rock in 1985 (actually it was called Rocxkin' the castle that year) and then every year until it finished.<br>  <br>  Fu*k download it will always be Donnington for me!!!!!!|`|Ku1GGxi3aa	depends what type of rock your talking about,<br>  but the rock im thinking about is special because the lyrics are usually meaningful and the instruments put to the lyrics kind of emphasize the power and emotion in them.<br>  <br>  i like t-shirts with my favorite bands name on them =]<br>  <br>  ummmm...shirts.<br>  <br>  i keep them in my closet? because thats where i put my clothes that im not wearing right now...
1wNsBNmxaa	Rosie the Riveter is a cultural icon of the United States, representing the American women who worked in war factories during World War II, many of whom worked in the manufacturing plants that produced munitions and materiel. These women took new jobs and sometimes the places of the male workers who were in the military. The character is now considered a feminist icon in the US, and a herald of women's economic power to come.<br>  <br>  Rosie the Riveter was most closely associated with a real woman, Rose Will Monroe, who was born in Pulaski County, Kentucky in 1920 and moved to Michigan during World War II. She worked as a riveter at the Willow Run Aircraft Factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, building B-29 and B-24 bombers for the U.S. Army Air Forces. Monroe was asked to star in a promotional film about the war effort at home, and was featured in a poster campaign. The song "Rosie the Riveter" by Kay Kyser was released in early 1943,and Monroe happened to best fit the description of the worker depicted in the song. Rosie went on to become perhaps the most widely recognized icon of that era. The films and posters she appeared in were used to encourage women to go to work in support of the war effort.<br>  <br>  According to the Encyclopedia of American Economic History, the "Rosie the Riveter" movement increased the number of working American women to 20 million by 1944, a 57% increase from 1940. Although the image of "Rosie the Riveter" reflected the industrial work of welders and riveters during World War II, the majority of working women filled non-factory positions in every sector of the economy. In 1942, just between the months of January and July, the estimates of the proportion of jobs that would be "acceptable" for women was raised by employers from 29 to 85%.<br>  <br>  Conditions were sometimes harsh and pay was not always equal—the average man working in a wartime plant was paid $54.65 per week, while women were paid about $31.50per week. Nonetheless, women quickly responded to Rosie the Riveter, who convinced them they had a patriotic duty to enter the workforce. Some claim that she forever opened up the work force for women, but others dispute that point, noting that many women were discharged after the war and their jobs given to returning servicemen.<br>  <br>  After the war, the "Rosies" and the generations that followed them knew that working in the factories was in fact a possibility for women, even though they did not reenter the job market in such large proportions again until the 1970s—by that time factory employment was in decline all over the country.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  On October 14, 2000, the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park was opened in Richmond, California, site of four Kaiser shipyards, where thousands of "Rosies" from around the country worked (although ships at the Kaiser yards were not riveted, but rather welded).Over 200 former Rosies attended the ceremony.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???|`|XFZmAMOAaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_the_Riveter" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_the_R...</a>    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvHeRoqDeBo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvHeRoqDe...</a>   These should help.If you google her,you can get posters from that era.|`|96f5821fa3b86eb990b42224c094d1ebaa	Rosie the Riveter was the prototype for working women during World War II.

And if it's true, there goes the show.  And it isn't really any of our business.  I think if they are having trouble they will get counseling.  It won't be a rash decision.  <br>  <br>  Plus, do we really trust Star magazine?  Can you imagine the child support if it's true?|`|g5RS83paaa	I don't believe anything Star magazine says, he's says he just took some photos with some fans|`|pLCLtbtFaa	Wow please don't tell me it's true!

I am an avid fan of the show and I think that this is just ridiculous. There is no way that he is cheating on Kate. She wouldnt take that for one second, and he loves his kids to death. I also read this but it was on the Star magazine website. Its Star, what do you expect?|`|3TQCwtxJaa	You know what's really tragic about this?

As far as the "who gives" answer, if you don't then why even bother answering, unless you have to have your 2 points that desperately...|`|dGTcZOjiaa	NO NO NO NO well i don't think think they are............... they are such a cute couple and they have 8 beautiful kids it would break my heart if they did!! remember........... they vowed in FRONT of the kids that they would stay together forever. everyone seems to forget about that. also i think they said that they were getting a divorce is to get more people to watch the show. you can find more about it by going to google and typing in jon and kate gosselin + divorce you will find tons of crazy sites. well..... hope i helped|`|AQlA6nu0aa	If so, he is making a bad choice because a family of 8 can handle themselves. I mean who will take care of the kids. I dont see him as that type of guy on the show, he looks very caring.

Dude, suicide would remain an option if I had to put up with that harpy as soon as I got home.<br>  <br>  Of course, this is one case where it'd be better just to stay with the program for the kid's sake.|`|3z6lwCHuaa	Well, I don't think so but probably not because they just bought a whole new house, 2 dogs, and renewed there vows saying they would ALWAYS be together. Sooo..I don't think so.|`|ZphvM2Rpaa	I dont really believe that and I hope its not true! It would first of all ruin the show and second mess up everything.|`|P3s3UIlcaa	cute kids , they look like very diluted Asians|`|EXPdJVLaaa	I doubt it! <br>  <br>  They might be like a NORMAL family and argue.

t5QOFwyAaa	You are both wrong, why answer a question if you don't know the answer, this is not a guessing game.<br>  <br>  Alex Rider is fourteen throughout the 7 published books. <br>  Book 1 (Stormbreaker)<br>  Book 7 (Snake head)<br>  Book 8 Crocodile Tears comes out in April 2009. The author Anthony Horowitz has said he will write one more book after 8 and then he can write no more Alex Rider books as Alex will then turn 15 and he wants to keep him 14 throughout the whole series.<br>  He prefers writing about younger boys for his young adult readers. His new series Jason Steed, Book1 'FLEDGLING JASON STEED" has the hero starting at age 11. The Next Jason Steed book is out in May.<br>  Alex Rider's home is in London England. The author does not state where but Alex is a Chelsea football fan so its north London.|`|XQMm3Ahraa	the series starts with him being 15 and he lives in england and about bye the 5th book he turns 16|`|QYki1pyKaa	14 or 15 in england

If the ratings are good it will probably be renewed.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	I hope so! I'm totally hooked on this show. If they're got good ratings, I think they will find a way to make the story keep going at least for 3 seasons... but hopefully, even more!|`|TBT091pwaa	yes there will be a third season i can almost guarantee it i saw on there website auditions for season 3 and you can win 1000 dollars and a chance to appear on the show im pretty sure they wouldnt add this if they werent planing a third season|`|KLkmfWjFaa	i just hope they have more than 8 episodes this season i hate that it only had a few last time <br>  <br>   its sooooooooo goooooooood\<br>  <br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer<br>  pick me as number one answer

IzVMG59Jaa	I was a die hard chris but now i don't like that much .I always knew that squeaky clean record would be gone soon.But i never thought it would go away like this.I thought he might get caught drinking or something.Not totally thrashing his girlfriend.i was never a rhianna fan,but no woman deserves to be hit on any occasion.All my respect for him is gone out the window.|`|eOdcZvQjaa	some do, like me, i don't care who it is, its not right for a guy to hit a girl. But, then some of my friends think they deserved it. They are insane fans, and they hate chris and rihanna being together.|`|LuFGyKbaaa	Yes. I think it was completely wrong. He completely went against what he previously stated about his own childhood. I lost all respect for the man. I don't even wish to listen to his music anymore. Nobody deserves that kind of treatment regardless who you are. It was ridiculous what he did. A lot of my friends and I all feel strongly about this subject. We'd rather not hear a single song of his again.|`|uLHqz10qaa	Yes i never liked him and i never will he is a fake *** ***** and a wanna be hater. Only reason he sang all them love songs was because he never had a girl friend and he should never have on again!                 Peace Out Bitches( ;|`|j4HLhkIkaa	He is a d*ck.  I never liked him. He always looks like he just got a bloww job from a dude.

Theres another version of the song I like better. It's the same song just by another singer. Its Hide and Seek by Love Is a Story. You might like it better than the other artist if you more of a electronic sound. Check it out.But I still like both. You can by both songs on Itunes. I love that skit!

Some people like to use subs and manga translations as their evidence but that is unreliable. More people think Chrona is a girl because she wears what appears to be a dress in a flashback of her past. I personally believe Chrona is a girl.|`|nMWtEmEFaa	It's a girl, the witch Medusa later on mentions her 'daughter' while explaining some sort of experiment involving Crona.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if that's in the anime though, I've only read the manga.|`|ghQVsyHgaa	its unknown. it makes that very clear at the point where Patti asks if shes a girl or a boy.<br>  <br>  and don't trust any English translating regarding gender... its not reliable|`|X3dfHBGGaa	krona is a girl<br>  it was later in the manga

With the bad economy, they probably can't afford to keep a show on the air unless they know it's going to be a huge hit every week.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Because they don't always get canceled abruptly.  Because sometimes there's closure.  Because sometimes the show is good enough to be worth watching, even if it only lived briefly.

AA10197672	It can both we good and bad. Both are water sign and both are very emotions. Once a cancer is hurt they go back to their shell and get all quiet and cold. If you both are like that then dont expect the relationship to go anywhere. Both will be waiting for the other one to call and applogize. You both need to have the communication line open all the time and dont keep things inside as a cancer does. The good part is that you are both passionate and effectionate so that will take you long run in the relationship but in arguments and fights you need to come up a way to deal with them rather than getting all cold and quiet cause that wont work....|`|oAMmIbRVaa	Cancer?is most compatible with Virgo, Scorpio, Pisces and?Taurus. The Cancer?sign however is incompatible with Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius, Aries and Gemini. As a?Cancer though you can work well with another Cancer or the Capricorn sign. Sounds like your good on this one. Have fun with your relationship:)
8WajgMlGaa	Cancerians seem to make better friends than lovers. It can be an incredibly nurturing friendship, but in a relationship, they're one in the same and neither are likely to bring anything new to the relationship<br>  <br>  I think Cancerians generally go better with other water signs, because each signs strengths have a tendency of canceling out the other's weaknesses.|`|9scez26Yaa	To be honest, not that compatible..

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	Shel Silverstein *(author of The Giving Tree, etc.) wrote this as a parody of teen-heartbreak songs. It was delivered with very dramatic emotion.<br>  <br>  In 1972, Silverstein told Rolling Stone magazine that there was a real Sylvia: "I just changed the last name, not to protect the innocent, but because it didn't fit. It happened about eight years ago and was pretty much the way it was in the song. I called Sylvia and her mother said, 'She can't talk to you.' I said, 'Why not?' Her mother said she was packing and she was leaving to get married, which was a big surprise to me. The guy was in Mexico and he was a bullfighter and a painter. At the time I thought that was like being a combination brain surgeon and encyclopedia salesman. Her mother finally let me talk to her, but her last words were, 'Shel, don't spoil it.' For about ten seconds I had this ego charge, as if I could have spoiled it. I couldn't have spoiled it with a sledge hammer."<br>  <br>  Oh, and the correct name of the song is "Sylvia's Mother"<br>  <br>  ... and thats what it is about.  Hope it was a good explanation!!

keoqsK5Laa	A Late Night Serenade - In my own opinion, it did sound like other metalcore bands. The only difference is they are not as famous as others. But I can hear no difference with my ears. I think they were characterized by light guitars, and shouted vocals. He did have an occasional growl, or scream, but for the most part he just shouts. That's mostly a characteristic of hardcore which I am not technically a fan of. 30 seconds into the song, there was a breakdown. Literally only 30 seconds. Should those not be preserved for a climax and build up to it? I listened to a 1:23. I heard no slight build up to a climax. Nothing to look forward to. Of course, I didn't listen to the whole thing so I could very well be wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  Architects - They have a close resemblance to Bring Me The Horizon. The vocalist shouts, and sounds exactly like Oliver Sykes. The riff in the beginning pulled me in though, I enjoyed it.  Also towards the end of the song, they have lighter guitars sounding over a chunkier sound. Which is probably the metal side, the side I like :P. I listened to the entire thing because I was going to turn it off and say they were a duplicate of Bring Me The Horizon (or the other way around) but, somewhere in the comments, someone said Architects were more thought provoking than BMTH. So I decided to let it continue, because if Architects also put effort into their lyrics, that also counts as talent as a musician. Then around 2:12, the melody in the guitars started and the singing came in. I was glad, by then, that I didn't turn it off. The melody proves them much more innovative and not a follower of hardcore breakdowns, shouted vocals, and lyrics that all contain the same thing (IMO). This is why I appreciate melody in my music. It takes much more originality to come up with a pattern of notes pleasing to the ear, rather than just a simplistic riff that honestly does the song no justice but is rather a waste because the breakdowns flood in and then all the bands are the same.<br>  ** Also, take a look at the icon of Century Media who posted the video, that is Petri Lindroos :D<br>  <br>  MOVING ON THE DEATH CORE!<br>  <br>  In Mortal  Treason, I hear more melody than I am used to when listening to Deathcore, haha. I like the riff after around 2:30, and the chunky slow part of the song, although I don't know if that counts as a breakdown. Anyway, I think the drummer could be a bit better. I don't know anything about drumming so I don't know what it's called that he is hitting, but it sounds like he's hitting a hollow box mixed with blast beats. That almost destroys the song for me, because I can take drummers that aren't necessarily excellent, but that annoying tapping sound is getting to me. I didn't hear anything too original about this band. I think I heard some synth being used, and the melodic riff. But that even those were barely there and the riff was so light, but overall, I have found more interesting metal bands with intriguing melody.<br>  <br>  Glass Casket:<br>  I had already heard of them, and I already liked them. And this is plausible to believe because throughout my answer I commented that alot of the other bands had more characteristics of hardcore than they did metal and this band actually is heavier than the others, and the melody in the guitars is not light, but I think it is called "sweeps"? I am  not a guitarist either. But the melody in the guitar is cleaner and sharp (which I like) and they are heavier, the vocalist is excellent as well. <br>  I had actually forgotten about this band until you reminded me of them, so thanks. haha<br>  <br>  1. <br>  Do you think bands of metal and deathcore sound exactly like all of the other respective core bands today?<br>  <br>  - As seen by my answer, I apparently do believe so. I don't bash it though because I believe the bands do have talent! They definately aren't talentless! But I prefer not to listen because I'm more a melody kind of person, which I believe takes more intellectual thought and emotion than just a couple breakdowns.<br>  <br>  2. What do you think sets a metal or deathcore band apart from their predecessors?<br>  <br>  - The fact that metalcore and deathcore bands also mix influences of hardcore with metal (there is a difference). I hear the hardcore influence   moreso than metal though, but bands like Glass Casket, they fit the label with hardcore AND metal influences. Most metalcore bands, though, shout and have breakdowns, and yeah, that's hardcore. So the metal bands that came before them, that is a notable difference. In Deathcore, it is heavier but still uses alot of blastbeats, or double bass, and has many breakdowns. The vocalists of this genre are not so hardcore-based as they do pig squeals and growl very low. <br>  <br>  All Shall Perish and Burning The Masses are EXCELLENT deathcore bands, in my opinion. They show talent and good vocals, and I don't know really....I just love them.<br>  <br>  *** One more thing I would like to note. I recently listened to Winds Of Plague because before I was not so much a fan, but I decided to give them a try again and I wasn't very impressed. But in one of their songs, I forget the name, the synth added alot of melody and it sounded so good :D so, MELODY IS KEY. hahaha but that's just MY personal opinion. People like you, obviously, are not like me and these bands stimulate something in you that doesn't to me. We are all different in our music taste, it's personal for each of us. We hear something and it sounds good to us, we can't help it. So, just because I don't like it doesn't mean it is downright terrible ;)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Why thank you. But I am female :O :P|`|YlCgMDVwaa	No I do not think ALL metalcore and deathcore bands sound the same, though some do, just like any other genre. <br>  <br>  To me, what sets these bands apart from one another, is their guitar sound and whatever inclusion (such as a synth).  Of course they're all going to have breakdowns of some kind, but that doesn't mean the all sound the same.  Lets compare two random bands.  Born of Osiris and ABACABB.  Both Deathcore, but have distinctive sounds.  BOO is very technical and has heavy use of a synth.  ABACABB is basic Deathcore with some grind influence and very exaggerated breakdowns.<br>  <br>  BOO: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8sd7ohC-IY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8sd7ohC-...</a><br>  <br>  ABACABB: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcTOnH4g9Ig" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcTOnH4g9...</a>|`|DbtS5jzEaa	I am a massive fan of Metalcore..but not deathcore...so I will just stick to Metalcore.<br>  <br>  I believe Metalcore bands are falling into the same trends of the music they write. Their is not a lot of 'new' ideas coming out of Metalcore...that is why 'Lost In The Sound Of Speration' by Underoath was such a welcomed breathe of fresh air...it showed that you can experiment more and also add a softer aspect into metalcore.<br>  <br>  I guess all genres have the same risk of becoming stale and unoriginal...it's up to new bands and old bands to change things up...but some times it's hard to tell the difference between metalcore bands.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	It won't go by the way of extinction, if you keep them close to your heart. I love the music but the singing is not my cup of tea, If I was a lot younger I'd probably like the singing also. Ever give up hope if you do they are sure to pass away, I hope not for the people who loves this music.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	I really really hope it isn't on the verge of extinction but that thought does go through my head every once in a while. This is a biased opinion since Deathcore is my favorite kind of music (and I really like metalcore too) but I definitely don't think it all sounds the same. Maybe, some bands sound a like but overall I think most of them have there own style and bring something new to their music.<br>  <br>  Well, I like the different things that deathcore and metalcore has been doing with keyboards, synthesizers and different things like that. Look at the band Winds of Plague. They are called "Symphonic Deathcore" and I think they are amazing!<br>  <br>  I'm not the only one who likes Mortal Treason in R&P!?!?!? :O :D They are awesome! I'm glad someone else besides me likes them. Too bad they broke up though.<br>  <br>  Deathcore:<br>  Winds of Plague - "Origins and Endings"<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG_pRMe40TI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG_pRMe40...</a><br>  Whitechapel - "Possession"<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoILecAWh4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoILecAW...</a><br>  <br>  Metalcore:<br>  Attack Attack! - "Stick Stickly"<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9jQvcef2wQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9jQvcef2...</a><br>  As I Lay Dying - "The Darkest Nights"<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxaoA3V8Kjk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxaoA3V8K...</a><br>  <br>  I hope making them different and diverse is what you wanted me to do cause that's what I did haha|`|YwtXSUAdaa	I do hear that a lot too. I don't think it will die out nor do I think it all sounds the same. There are some really sh*tty deathcore bands that I have listened to that are horrible and sound like they're just trying to cash in on the genre. Annotations for an Autopsy is the worst deathcore band I have ever come across and if all deathcore bands start to sound like that, then the genres in trouble but I don't see that happening.<br>  <br>  As for metalcore, I think it is even more varied in sound. When you think about it, metalcore isn't too far off from post-hardcore..... it's just more leaning towards metal and not punk. Although I disagree with you about Sky Eats Airplane lol, they are horrible and are only hurting the genre.<br>  <br>  The guy somewhere above me said that Whitechapel, JFAC, and Suicide Silence all sound the same..... I personally think they are among the top deathcore bands out there. A lot of people saying that it all sounds the same are just people that don't listen to it and don't want to listen to it. All pop music sounds the same and all mainstream rock music sounds the same, but they aren't dying, and either will these.<br>  <br>  Personally, if it dies, it dies. We have the metalcore and deathcore from now and it will always be here. It will suck that nothing new from them would be coming out but there will always be something to listen to.<br>  <br>  People need to at least listen to something before they start saying it sounds the same as everything else.<br>  ____________<br>  <br>  Yeah, I made it. Good thing too, I would have hated to miss this question, it was a good one. You can probably tell by my long-ish answer that I don't like people talking about good genres sounding the same and dying......|`|Lg7Kgo24aa	no!<br>  <br>  sky eats airplane is godawful, and i have to see them on sunday :(<br>  <br>  a lot of deathcore bands do sound the same.. whitechapel, suicide silence, job for a cowboy, etc..<br>  and then the really bad ones like waking the cadaver<br>  <br>  um..<br>  (edit)|`|Yi24ELaQaa	No. <br>  <br>  Metalcore can't die ou that easily because it was made out of tougher stuff. Metalcore as you know it came from melodic death metal, which was more thoroughly rooted. <br>  I don't think metalcore or deathcore will die out, but will continue the trend and mix with all other genres. If no new scenes or creative music come out of metal, i give it about 10 years for all music to sound the same.<br>  <br>  If it does not mix with all other genres, metalcore will be left by itself and die out. They couldn't leech off melodeath anymore once they run out of riffs. People will catch on.<br>  And yes they will run out of breakdowns. Lyrical material they can use indefinately without anyone noticing (hell, check out the lyrical material of the bands on the pop charts. mXc has somewhat better lyrical content, but following it's fimiliar formula, it can be recycled indefinately.)<br>  ___________________<br>  Do you think bands of metal and deathcore sound exactly like all of the other respective core bands today?<br>  I think that it is getting closer to that point gradually. As I have said, if no new creative breaths come out, it will become stale and die(and all bands will end up sounding the same.) <br>  <br>  What do you think sets a metal or deathcore band apart from their predecessors?<br>  Experimentation. If a band tries different things from what it's used to, or what the rest of the bands in the genre is used to, they would definatley set themselves apart.<br>  <br>  Give my list of songs a quick listen and tell me if you believe they sound the same in one way or another.<br>  The core melodeath riffs, but that is pretty much it.

GBRmOem8aa	Your cookie: It means that in your personal relationships(family, friends, husband) you will have good luck.<br>  <br>  your husbands: It could mean he will cheat, but it also could mean that a good friend of his will return into his life and will perhaps enlighten you as the center of your husbands life. <br>  <br>  <br>  They are bogus. lol They are fun to read though.|`|PIjCNYQNaa	Your cookie is good. Which means we just have to interpret his cookie right.<br>  <br>  I would like to think of the two cookies as an indication that both of your loves will renew and you'll live happily ever after. That means the "old friend" is your younger self and you both will fall back in love together.<br>  <br>  Also, his "old friend" could be a buddy from high school, and they'll go to a couple baseball games this summer. Maybe you and his buddy's wife could go to? Nothin' like baseball for togetherness!|`|3nCA4768aa	Its bs they are such liers...They either bring something up you will forget, or something to compliment you with so you will agree. Its really bs, there to vague. <br>  <br>  What yours mean is : Pretty much what it says...<br>  <br>  Your husbands: Maybe one of his freinds from college, (male) and they could share good times together, idk its bs so dotn worry dang. and if he does cheat then you picked wrong.|`|Kg681jL8aa	watch out, it will happen.|`|AA10197672	You will have an "affair" with ur husband and that will re-new the bond you two once shared as friends. One night play a roll as that and see how that will go. They are all BS anyways...

bd34c1c498bf77ed11bff8328060c47baa	I don't know. And I only really enjoy his music, so I don't really care what went on in his personal life.<br>  <br>  And no it wasn't proven that he did it. He was found "not guilty".|`|q4pLY5F8aa	He will do anything just to make people talk about him.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	i wasn't in the room with him but - there are signs that he is.  He had no childhood and something is definitely going on in his mind with regards to self image. <br>  <br>  He should have been sent to a psychiatric facility instead of us just turning our cheeks the other way.<br>  <br>  I'm not defending him - I was molested  as a child- just saying that he needs help.|`|akcGfgdcaa	Actually in all honesty, I don't think he did anything with Jordon Chandler though he may have wanted to or with the 2nd kid (Gavin Arvizo).<br>  <br>  BUT, I'm sure he has molested children outside of those 2 cases. It should also be noted that awhile before the Arvizo case, MJ did also pay off another family who was claiming that he abused their child. He paid them $300,000 in that case. <br>  <br>  Even the jury in the Arvizo case said that although they felt he was innocent in this case, they all agreed that they were confident he had committed child abuse on other occasions to other children.<br>  <br>  At the time the Jordon Chandler case occurred, MJ was around 35yrs old. On one particular occassion, MJ and Jordon were in MJ's bedroom for a day and a half on their own. Don't get me wrong, I love his music, but in what world do we live in when it becomes ok for a man of 35yrs to spend a day and a half alone with a young teenage boy, who is no relation, in his bedroom!?<br>  <br>  I don't think they did anything together, but it seems pretty obvious that MJ was trying to groom him but failed. <br>  <br>  He is a musical genius, but every MJ fan is deluded if they believe he is a completely innocent man.|`|AA11741086	HELLO!!! Did you forget the case where the kid was about to identify body marks and characteristics about Jacko the Wackos' personals? Then mysteriously, Jacko the Wacko paid out an undisclosed ammount of money to shut the boy up! It was one of the first times he got busted and bought his way out of jail! Celebrity justice! Anyone else would be thrown in jail to get porked by the lifers!|`|dNAEJttLaa	Well I dont think so....<br>  I just think he likes children a lot!!<br>  His Childhood wasn't exactly the easiest. He was singing, practicing most of the time and his family had some issues!<br>  So I think he's just trying to bring out his inner child, something he couldnt do when he was growing up!|`|0FwVGYEYaa	watch this video or forward to the micheal part  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzdXcTIBDW0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzdXcTIBD...</a>|`|AA12227342	Yes, I do. That's too much stress and anguish for a kid to go through just for some money. Plus he admitted on TV that he had kids in his bed, which is completely wrong.|`|g3X9Ei6Baa	INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. I personally don't think he done anything to any children but to those who think that he did, show me your proof and I'd be more than happy to admit I was wrong.|`|8isZeudZaa	yes of course he admitted sleeping with young boys. once again if you have enough money you can do anything. is anyone keeping an eye on his kids now??????????????what a tell all book they will write.|`|fpyRo8Noaa	no...people need to leave him alone like seriously|`|aocf35epaa	poor michael jackson. who cares dude hes not guilty! hee hee

Here are some suggestions on when to toss a loofah and to disinfect it:<br>  <br>  Loofah<br>  When to toss: After three or four weeks. Bacteria can build up in the crevices and infect you via an open cut or acne, says Birgit Toome, M.D., a cosmetic dermatologist in New Jersey. Plus, a loofah loses its ability to slough off dry skin after a few weeks. Mesh puffs are more resistant to bacteria and can last for eight weeks.|`|BYWDIhuLaa	uh i dont use 1 i use an organis sponge straight from the north sea they are great and last forever!!|`|dbgQgYscaa	When it loofails|`|RoeMSv97aa	i guess for 1 1/2 months, then it starts shredding...|`|dFN54R1oaa	about two months!!|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	I use those nylon puff puffs....I swear a loofah lasts longer than most marriages.|`|8SyUHkPXaa	Funny you should ask, because I just opened a new one yesterday.<br>  <br>  I'd throw mine away rather regularly, because they don't dry out completely in the shower and then they tend to mold quickly.

IgNADy1Taa	I think in some ways it was a flattering portrayal of lesbians but in other ways not.<br>  <br>  It was interesting how most of the main characters were attractive, femme lesbians and at least it dispelled the stereotype of unattractive and/or "butch" lesbians. Moreover, they were all extremely successful and quite high profile, e.g. Bette being the curator/dean, Tina as a producer, Alice the host etc. <br>  <br>  But in other ways it wasn't...the worst part for me was the incestuous relations between members of the group! People seemed to swap partners constantly, and cheat on each other A LOT. Bette used to go out with Alice (this was alluded to once) and was with Tina in Season 1, but then cheated on her with a frickin carpenter, then got with Jodi and cheated on JODI with Tina again. And Tina and Helena was pretty bizarre, as was Shenny, ew! And don't even get me started on Shane! The worst thing she did was leave Carmen at the altar...and then hardly ever refer to her again after that. And what's with being on the verge of moving in with Paige, and then out of nowhere sleeping with the estate agent? The "Chart" pretty much seems to sum up how promiscuous everyone was :s it would have been nice to see more loyalty, to give the lesbian lifestyle a better name. It wasn't great for bisexuals either to have Tina dabble around with that man for awhile, and also Alice and that man when she went through her bi phase (/lesbian "Lisa") and then have them switch back as if nothing happened.  <br>  <br>  Also, a few of the characters were whackjobs which is never good for representation - like Jenny just being a general nut, Shane and her druggy/sex worker past, Alice going psycho over Dana, and Papi's total over-the-topness. And poor Max's pregnant storyline straight out of the Thomas Beatie tabloid headlines.<br>  <br>  But all visibility is good in a way and it brought lesbians to the attention of a TV audience who'd never seen a show centred around them before. In a way it was good that it didn't concentrate on being too political/role modelly, because it downplayed the fact that they happened to be lesbian and concentrated more on storylines which are universal. It made them seem less alien to straight people and the show had many straight fans.|`|q1D83tSnaa	The L Word season 6 was pitiful, but seasons 1-5 were amazing. <br>  And i guess one could say they were role models because they were not stereo-typical lesbians with mullets and manly attire. They represented real women, some with successful jobs and real situations. They weren't traditional role-models, because they are meant to be perfect. <br>  They make mistakes and do bad things. But they show the struggles lesbian women encounter. They made me laugh, cry, get angry, get frustrated, but most of all, they changed my life. So yea, to me, they were role-models.|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	I enjoyed watching The L word. I think the women on show could be role models. Most of the women all had good jobs. The last season did kind of suck.|`|o7E9LxV8aa	i work in a factory and i wish they look that good|`|HSt3y5yWaa	It sure was entertaining I'll say that much.
5hbNtQDIaa	i would deffinitly do the rising fighting spirit. well personally thats my favorite fighting music from the show but it would be perfect for that video. especially cus well in the game broken bond for Xbox 360 they play that music alot in the training and sometimes on missions...yea its a different naruto game but it still went well with it. i would deffintly do thr rising fighting spirit but i know its not that long so if it doesnt cover the whole video u can pick something like rock lees theme. i love his theme song that is deffintily good fighting music. but the rising fighting spirit would be my 1st choice..although it might be over used. so one of those 2 would be best or both for different parts of the video. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dizzler.com/index.search.dv8?q=Naruto" rel="nofollow">http://www.dizzler.com/index.search.dv8?...</a><br>  <br>  theres alot of ideas ;)<br>  <br>  hope ive helped some and good luck with the video!! i will deffinitly see it when it comes out ^_^

Megamisama movie.
HXpR2bw0aa	Yes, 100%.<br>  <br>  I'm 13 years old in High School, and I haven't ate a proper, proper meal in weeks, months even. I eat healthy for breakfast, hardly nothing for lunch, and basically crackers with some tiny pathetic topping on top for dinner. Whenever I eat something, I have to check the calories in it, then measure how much I eat, and I calorie count everyday, and spend at least 2 hours a day exercising. Sure, this may not be so bad compared to some people in the rest of the world and their eating disorders, but listen to what some of my friends do.<br>  <br>  One of my friends hasn't ate a proper meal in months, and I mean months. It was probably Christmas. She eats less than 500 calories a day, and for the past few weeks she hasn't had any energy at all and just mopes around at school. She lost 2 stone in 2 weeks and it's as if she has a fear of eating food.<br>  <br>  Another one of my friends doesn't eat breakfast, has a cereal bar for lunch, and then if she has dinner at all, she has a small (and I mean small) salad. She gets her energy from one tiny pot of ice cream a day.<br>  <br>  And that's just three of us. I think the media is a life ruining thing that puts so many people through things that no one should have to go through. A few years ago when I was a kid I really didn't understand about eating disorders and how someone would not want to eat, but now I do understand fully, and it's horrible. In my eyes, everyone who's career is associatted with the media is a sinful, sinful person.|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Yep, I would but people are also responsible when they buy those magazines and watch certain TV shows which are clearly very superficial.|`|ipiCyE3zaa	partly<br>  but other things are involved too: bullying, peer pressure, parents, celebrities, its also just a form of mental illness- they may have had a traumatic past|`|P6NptCz8aa	Absolutely yes. Because the messages in the media make overweight individuals feel bad about their bodies, which makes them want to eat more. Also, young adults especially young women feel the need to be slimmer, which can lead to anorexia and bulimia. We work harder than we think to conform to the image of a healthy and attractive person that the media puts out.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	No, everybody sees the media and not everybody has an eating disorder.  These people already had a mental problem to begin with!|`|hzQDocWaaa	no i blaim the indaviduals|`|puXPrxfJaa	yea|`|agyl1OEqaa	The media does put pressure on young girls (to be thin); however, I got through my teen years without having an eating disorder. I am not sure if you should blame the parents for not instilling enough self confidence into their children, or if the children just have a sickness, and no one is to blame.|`|AA10232286	No. The parent(s) should be more in control. Funny how people can do things of their own free will and blame someone else if there's a problem. Turn off the media.|`|yf0Qm9gMaa	I totally would.|`|33e18371c231caed609d57632064134caa	no, the parents are more to blame|`|IgIlAiO5aa	No blame their parents for letting them do that stupid crap...if my kid had a problem like that, they would be grounded and I'd be shovin food down their throat wether they liked it or not..|`|aMAhwCTBaa	No I blame the parents.|`|1tlgYKROaa	nope, plain old peer pressure is enough to cause the problem.|`|K5uoaetaaa	no|`|lAqV1OmRaa	Eating disorders have always been around. But the increase in number of these eating disorders, I think, can definitely be blammed on the media! Look around you - everywhere, there are bulletins with skinny, "beautiful" models. Watch TV, commercials, movies - the majority of the women are underweight. However, since this is glorified, teens think that being skinny is what being beautiful is. Big mistake!|`|IjKndeVvaa	Some of them. I think recently researchers found out it can be caused by predetermined psychological disorders, and isn't necessarily influenced by the media, though that can help push it over the edge. Basically, they've found out, that's just the way those girls brains are wired. Anorexics and Bulimics have actual diseases and aren't just lacking self confidence.|`|kdBhSqqfaa	Yes, the media is partly to blame. It would sure be a lot easier on the youth of today growing up if they didn't have all that pressure to be skinny and "hot". But it's also how the child is raised. If it's raised to love itself no matter what and has a healthy self-esteem, it should survive the media barage.|`|B8hzSzcAaa	Partially. Those kids also have to have a little bit of self-esteem problems to really get influenced by the media. Might be the parents' fault, or friends' fault, who knows?|`|3AoUraHGaa	yes i definately would. just the image that they put out there in the modeling industry and fashion magazies makes every girl think that they need to be a size 0 and weigh under 100lbs no matter what they really look like.|`|AA11641713	No because they are not force feeding us.  It's up to the individual what they eat and can't eat.  I know that sometimes we eat what we shouldn't but life is too short to worry about things like that.|`|U8lG8Ltjaa	yes. <br>  the image that the media portrays as "healthy, beautiful" is actually underweight. (in fat percentage) <br>  so, yes.|`|JNbHemylaa	Yes definitely.|`|r2ScQP2vaa	yes. Now that is the only thing i would <br>  blame on the media.|`|LSCvCyeVaa	I blame all the staples in labia for this|`|110635f4fe1d99bd90ec9718bf3e33d5aa	mostly parents fault|`|jki8W5khaa	yes

But otherwise, I'm good.<br>  <br>  BA1 - He should go back to behind the drum kit, the sooner the better.<br>  BA2 - Yeah, it was peachy.  Saw Slumdog Millionaire.<br>  BA3 - System Syn - The Skeleton of a Heart - it's almost like an industrial/emo hybrid.  The cover art with the giant heart with barbed wire on it might have something to do with it.

Radiohead - OK Computer|`|0vm66wlcaa	I'm alright, how are you?<br>  <br>  BQ:<br>  I don't really like the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl's voice annoys me a little and it's too poppish.

aaUogxkHaa	All My Children<br>  <br>  After Amanda checked out of the hospital, she thanked JR not only for understanding why she couldn't return to the Chandler mansion, but also for his forgiveness. JR told her that the scare she'd had with the baby put a lot of things into perspective for him. He then knocked at the door they'd been standing near and when it opened, Tad greeted them both warmly. He assured Amanda that he was fine with her move into Casa Martin. They moved inside and Jake joined the group in the foyer in time for JR to note that Amanda had overdone things a bit that day. Amanda concurred, but said that there was no way she would have missed Greenlee's memorial service. <br>  <br>  Away from the lingering attendants of the memorial service, Ryan confessed to the realization that he wouldn't wake up from the nightmare of Greenlee being gone. He insisted that he was alone, but Kendall denied that and pulled him into a comforting embrace. Opal interrupted them when she approached them, with Krystal and David close behind. Opal had some information that she'd shared with David and Krystal that they all thought Ryan should know. Opal insisted that the disclosure could wait, so David offered his condolences and said that he'd gotten to know what an amazing woman Greenlee was from when she'd been married to his brother, Leo. He then encouraged Ryan to move on with his life as soon as he could. David escorted his new bride out and, after Ryan was able to break his incredulous stare, he demanded that Opal divulge what she knew. <br>  <br>  Opal told them that when the lightning flickered during the service, she felt Greenlee's presence in a different way than she had felt other people who had passed away. Ryan told her that although he'd asked her to try to get in touch with Greenlee's spirit, he needed her to stop, as he needed an opportunity to heal. Opal said that while she couldn't stop the feelings, she could make a point not to share them. The thunder rumbled again, and when Kendall nervously clutched her chest, Opal looked to Ryan, who confirmed that he would make sure Kendall got home safely. After Opal exited, Kendall noted that she had the same feeling as the night of the tornado. <br>  <br>  Kendall questioned what she could have done to garner all of the personal and emotional fallout she'd suffered from the tornado - most recently the loss of Greenlee. She then asked how Ryan could excuse her from any culpability regarding Greenlee's death, and Ryan told her that Zach always had a choice in what happened and he continually made the wrong decision. At that, tears rolled down Kendall's face as she wondered why both Zach and her sister hadn't been honest, to the point that she woke up from the coma to a completely different world - one where her husband shared a daughter with her sister, and had been captivated by someone Kendall didn't know. Ryan noted that he had a similar struggle as he tried to understand what he had done to end up alone and filled with grief again. He tried to find words to describe how he and Kendall could get through the pain, and she offered that they could only do so by depending on each other. <br>  <br>  Ryan told Kendall that he wanted to take her home, but she resisted because she didn't want to fight with Zach anymore. Ryan asked her if that was really the reason, and she admitted that she was more afraid of not finding Zach at home when she got there. She then pointed out how much she had pushed him away and wondered how she could be so aware of what she was doing, and still continue to be so self-destructive. She worried that Zach would get so far away from her that there would be no way to repair their marriage. Ryan related to what Kendall felt, and said that his love for Greenlee was not without its own collateral damage. He advised her to take advantage of still having an opportunity to fix things with Zach, as he was still alive. <br>  <br>  At Pine Valley Hospital, a doctor took the bandages off of Reese's eyes and asked what she saw. After a moment, Reese announced that she couldn't see anything. The doctor tried to keep her calm and said that her response was common, but Reese was unable to maintain control when she realized that Zach was still there. Though he reached out in an attempt to help, she pushed his hands away and blamed him for what had happened. The doctor attempted to get Zach to leave, but he refused until Reese understood that her situation was not hopeless. <br>  <br>  The doctor said that it was his job to ease his patient's worries and he excused himself briefly. Reese took the opportunity to chastise Zach for his attempt to get rid of her. She then stopped as the realization set in that she might not see the faces of Bianca or their children again. Zach tried to comfort her, but she demanded that he tell her exactly what he wanted from her. <br>  <br>  Zach insisted that he only wanted to help Reese, but she was sure that his acts of kindness were only so that he could be sure that she wouldn't seek re|`|NGNeT3rYaa	go to soaps.com they have daily and weekly, monthly recaps.

sOpIMeJSaa	all of the contacts above me are right about what they said about twitter, but they have left out one thing;  why twitter is so amazing for people like me and other internet online marketers.<br>  <br>  twitter is free advertising for your website; millions of people of people are on twitter are following you and your online business. just put your web site on your white board and all of your followers will read it, which in turn gives you web site exposure to millions of twitter members.<br>  <br>  i have gotten more leads and sells from my web site displayed on twitter for free, then a  $500.00 paid advertising campaign from google pay per click advertisement. that is why TWITTER is fantastic for the maximum exposure of your site and it is totally free.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.me2everyone.com/2075" rel="nofollow">http://www.me2everyone.com/2075</a><br>  <a href="http://www.myprebuilder.com/?sponsor=6248" rel="nofollow">http://www.myprebuilder.com/?sponsor=624...</a>|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	Millions of people have it.

Angel!|`|WBf2V8vSaa	She is beautiful, and I love her name :]|`|P1EFw6z6aa	congrats on the baby!<br>  she looks healthy to me, but im no psychic|`|QhlEOI6iaa	She's a beautiful baby and I'm sure she'll make you one proud mama :)|`|Jg8ngWj0aa	She'll be a Gemini/Taurus cusp.<br>  <br>  The outgoing Gemini girl is clever and quick-witted. Something of a social butterfly, she adores having an abundance of friends. The family telephone line is apt to be perpetually busy and this young lady is adept at talking on the phone while also sending e-mails. Indeed, each and every item of communication in any form dispatched will be deemed both delightful and dazzling to the recipients. There is no doubt that internet chat rooms were created with the Gemini girl in mind. Here, a slew of hobbies and interests is needed to keep this rapid-fire mind occupied...which is why the girl governed by Gemini dabbles in everything from aerobics to Zen. However, as much as she loves to talk (and she always seems to have the "scoop" on everything), this young lady will also be on top of her studies and can sometimes manage to achieve straight A's without even trying (although networking with the teacher could have something to do with her success). The Gemini girl enjoys engaging in sports such as swimming and laps around the track would also be a good way to burn off some of her abundant energy. She will probably also be heavily involved in the school newpaper, either as a reporter or the resident gossip columnist.

sNr9Od89aa	Super Dog says:<br>  That's not true. People who see a funny, pretty girl don't even notice she's funny because they're too blinded by her beauty.

HRtqw6cbaa	Well , if you type in deleted and extended scenes on Youtube, you might just find them there.

I really don't think he will leave Kate.|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	If he was in a bar it doesn't nessceairly mean they are divorcing.<br>  Everybody goes through a stage where they go to a bar.  It is normal...<br>  When I first read it I didn't believe it but I looked on the internet and here is one:<br>  "The couple appears to have serious marriage problems now that Jon has started spending increasing time away from home and partying with college girls, claims InTouchWeekly.com."<br>  and another one:<br>  ""He was dirty dancing with several of them, making out, kissing them on their necks and mouths. I thought it was rather surprising for a father with his wife and so many kids at home to be acting like this. He was all over one girl, a long-haired blonde who's nearly 6 feet tall. He left with several of the girls, including her."<br>  <br>  But No I highly doubt it because Kate even said recently on the show that the stress level has gone way down since the move and that they are enjoying each other more<br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE NOT!|`|ECkj80cUaa	That would be too bad.

bd34c1c498bf77ed11bff8328060c47baa	It's the truth. He will hit her again. Guys who hit women don't just stop after one time. It usually leads up to worse and worse and even some guys end up killing their girlfriends/wives.<br>  <br>  But if that's what she wants, then no one can stop her. Only she has to make the decision that she deserves better than some jerk like that.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	Abusers are repeat offenders, Oprah is right she needs to leave him.  When I heard the description of the attack I was shocked.  It wasn't like it was one punch and then 'oops I'm sorry I overreacted'.....he beat the crap out of her over the span of several minutes.  Defiantly needs to get his @ss kicked by some people.  I hope he gets sent to prison so he gets raped and beaten.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	Oprah is a useless windbag, and Rhianna has no talent.

I feel the same about them!|`|61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	Oprah was right. If he hit her once, he'll hit her AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. And each time, the beatings will get progressively worse. The best thing for Rihanna, and any other woman in this situation, to do is walk away and never look back. And as for the man doing the hitting, they deserve everything they get.|`|AA11401294	Oprah needs to mind her own business. As a matter of fact everybody needs to mind their own business. <br>  Everybody seems to be experts when it comes to other peoples lives.<br>  Leave Rihanna alone.

They are the next Whitney and Bobby Brown.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Oprah is right again,like she always is.<br>  <br>  And Chris Brown DOES deserve to go to jail...I don't know what Rihanna is thinking....But he will hit her again..even if he does get help.|`|AA11741086	He sure looked concerned about what he did by taking a vacation to Florida, laughing and partying it up right after he showed the world what a man he really isn't! I don't know why but alot of girls think they can change a guy...not true...so if she gets beat again it's her own fault for staying with the tiger that won't change its' stripes. Good luck to Rihanna...as for Chrissy the sissy Brown...ROT IN JAIL!!! HOPE YOU GET A LIFE SENTENCE!!!|`|AA12227342	Oprah is right. Once an abuser, always an abuser.

I cannot even believe that she would even imagine that the right thing to do right now is go back to her abuser. I'm very disappointed with her actions.<br>  <br>  As for Chris Brown, I think it is obvious what I feel about him. He should be given maximum sentence as an example that you cannot hurt someone without punishment no matter who you are.|`|aocf35epaa	Well idk what she did.

IrdZKYT3aa	I saw, "Taken" and highly recommend it, absolutely awesome, and very brutal!<br>  I saw "The Watchman" and was very disappointed, however I did not read the comics.<br>  I have not seen "I love you, man" but it looks hilarious!!<br>  As for Netflix, I didn't see any of them, but I've heard nothing but good things regarding Grand Torino.|`|cQaHukqUaa	good ones i think.<br>  <br>  <br>  please answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309123555AAHePYF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

iIU7PQHjaa	Taken and Gran Torino, the only ones worth watching...|`|cKb1YiHvaa	I went to see watchmen on saturday, it is a good movie, but depending on your maturity level would depend on seeing that movie. there are a few nude scenes. but it was pretty cool movie. I was told that Taken was really good, and was suspenseful. Coraline I went and saw in 3D I would wait for it to come out on DVD it wasn't that great, it was cute for little kids. It would be better to rent it. But then again I think it would be better to rent most movies, because movie prices are so high.|`|CyjuTf0raa	I would definitely go with Gran Torino, though I have heard good reviews from Taken. Eastwood is bound to have another movie out with a good balance of plot and action.<br>  <br>  I'm questioning Watchmen because of all the other super-hero and comic throw-back movies that have been released recently; I fear it might be a band-wagon that won't be that good.|`|Rodj52Swaa	Taken and Watchmen and  Gran Torino <br>  definitely worth watching :-)|`|rqr3ilrMaa	GRAND TORINO FOR SURE!!!!!!|`|Mp5qliEhaa	Watch Gran Torino, it will be out of theatres soon. watchmen won't|`|eyXunHyKaa	I'd go see Watchmen.  It is very long (like 3 hrs), but most of my friends have seen it already, and all say it's awesome.|`|04TD5L6Yaa	frost/nixon- WAIT i didn't like it<br>  <br>  taken- GOOD MOVIE definitely "action packed".....family/friends<br>  <br>  I would reccommend going to see Gran Torino....worth the $10<br>  <br>  watchmen - YES....BETTER THAN IRON MAN.....(it is very long)<br>  yes this movie does show a naked blue man quite often....so don't see that if the family if it will be akward!!!  /friends<br>  <br>  coraline- don't see it by yourself...not as fun...i would reccomed seeing this movie on the big screen...not only is it hilarious but movies are funner in 3D while at a theater .....family/friends|`|nLcX9HqPaa	I've heard Taken was alright but I didn't get to see it yet. I saw Gran Torino yesterday and I thought it was a really good movie. It's about how an older man, Clint Eastwood, who is stuck in his ways, in a way, comes to accept others.|`|nfAM7NcMaa	you probley should see grand torino or taken, Gran Torino is a good movie but not alot of action, taken is an awsome movie full of action so those are two of the good ones to me.|`|AA12122999	taken is really great. i watched it and loved it. im going to go watch it agian this weekend. and buy the DVD when it comes out!!|`|RHfL1MINaa	All i know is gran torino is a good movie but it is a little slow.|`|PcRyxJ07aa	See Push, its a great action movie, unless you've already seen it. I saw a couple weeks ago and I loved it.|`|wbnqzpoCaa	Watchmen, that's what I'm going to see! If You watch it before me let us know what you thought?|`|IKXFAExJaa	Of these, I've seen Taken and Watchmen. Both are good movies, but for different reasons.<br>  <br>  Taken is a great semi-action, thriller. The acting is great and even though it's sort of like the Bourne Identity movies, everything that happens is realistic and possible. I would definitely recommend anyone seeing it.<br>  <br>  Watchmen is long, but it's not very noticeable. It's very entertaining and interesting and it draws you in. If you've read the comic, you'll be more interested (and also things will be easier to follow), but it can be enjoyed nonetheless. <br>  <br>  It really depends on who you're going with and what type of experience you want. All the movies you listed are different genres. Incidentally, I haven't heard many good things about Coraline and Gran Torino.<br>  <br>  My money's on Taken.|`|fBGREOKTaa	Gran Torino or Taken<br>  <br>  Clint Eastwood does a realy good job in this movie, and watching the character development of Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) and the little asian kid, as well as the change in everything else and the kick *** surprise at the end of the movie make it worth watching.  I literally do not know a single person who didn't like it.<br>  <br>  Taken is also pretty sick. Liam Neeson is a House in this movie, and the action was pretty good.<br>  <br>  If you're in the movie for a kick *** action flick with some plot development watch Taken.  If your looking for a good movie that is just overall excellent, watch Torino.  The other movies suck|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	Gran Torino. I am a Clint Eastwood fan.  My Brother & his wife saw Taken and loved it.

f43e0a6d2d98bbbea4b8923f261d8ccaaa	I've seen the rumors not sure if there true or not. You do know that TLC has a new show about a family just like Jon an Kate's. For one if they do split up TLC is a family channel an will not make anymore episodes since there not a whole family. I've been telling everyone, "What's going to happen when the 6 go to 1st grade? What's TLC going to shoot?" Kate agonizing over the dust the vacuum doesn't pick up? So then they'll follow her to Lowes or someplace and film her grilling the salesman about the Dyson vacuum she wants. Mind you TLC will probably pick up the tab for it. So this might be a way for TLC to opt-out of the show without having a bunch of fans all over them which happens when they pull the plug on good shows. An the new family will replace them.|`|U2x7WZ4Kaa	i dont think that they will break up|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	I could care less, do they care about my divorce?

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	You've named all the ones that I first thought of, too. lol<br>  How about an old one from 1978 called "The Betsy"?<br>  Synopsis: <br>   Based on the novel by Harold Robbins, this is the story of Loren Hardeman, Sr., a Midwestern automobile manufacturer (Lord Olivier) who pins his future on The Betsy, a "wonder car" named after his daughter (Kathleen Beller). The Betsy is designed to last practically forever, which doesn't rest well with the "planned obscolence" mindset of the auto industry. Flashbacks cover his career from his 40s to the present, when he is in his 90s. Hardeman, Sr. has a weak-willed son, Hardeman, Jr., (Robert Duvall) who is forced into taking charge of the family business.<br>  *How about "The Astronaut Farmer" (2006)? It kinda falls within the same theme. A NASA astronaut (Billy Bob Thornton), forced to retire years earlier so he could save his family farm, has never give up his dream of space travel and looks to build his own rocket, despite the government's threats to stop him.<br>  *The Aviator (2004)--Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes an interest in commercial-passenger travel, and purchases majority interest in Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA), the predecessor to Trans World Airlines. In 1935, he test flies the H-1 Racer but crashes in a beet field; "Fastest man on the planet," he boasts to Hepburn. Three years later, he flies around the world in four days, shattering the previous record by three days. Meanwhile, Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), owner of Pan American Airlines, and Senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) worry over the possibility that Hughes might beat them in the quest for commercial expansion. Brewster has just introduced the Commercial Airline Bill, which will give world expansion solely to Pan Am. Trippe advises Brewster to check to the "disquieting rumors about Mr. Hughes."|`|4nnGcsFXaa	"The Insider" stars Russell Crowe and Al Pacino is a true story about a Big Tobacco scientist who exposed corporate secrets.  Great film. Unnerving.<br>  <br>  "Thank You for Smoking" stars Aaron Ekhart.  It's a dark comedy about a Big Tobacco spin doctor who has a change of heart.<br>  <br>  "Fast Food Nation" doesn't really have the "one man" v. corporate, but it's based on a really upsetting book about the fast food industry.  <br>  <br>  "Supersize Me", a documentary, is a good one for this too.<br>  <br>  "Erin Brokovich" is great! Woman v. water-supply company.<br>  <br>  "The Rainmaker" is based on a John Grisham novel, directed by Coppola.  Matt Damon v. evil HMOs/insurance company.<br>  <br>  "Syriana" is about oil industry and war.  Clooney fights this battle, primarily.<br>  <br>  "Network" is a cinema classic about the corruption of the media.  And one man, an anchor, who loses his mind on air, which ends up with great ratings.<br>  <br>  "Up Close and Personal" is a love story, starring Robert Redford and Michelle Pfieffer, about investigative journalism versus pat, contrived story.<br>  <br>  "The China Syndrome" stars Jack Lemmon, Michael Douglas, and Jane Fonda.  Lemmon v. Nuclear power plant<br>  <br>  "Norma Rae" is Sally Field v. the factory.  Go Unions!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.  Great Question!!!

Na na na na na na na na, na na na na, Hey Jude|`|lNpTfAM1aa	Yea|`|AA10393340	As whiskym says it was written by Paul McCartney for Julian Lennon when John was dabbling with Yoko and his marriage was breaking up.  As a matter of interest when the acetate was cut Paul borrowed a copy and took it to the Rolling Stones party that they were giving for having recorded Beggars Banquet. At the height of the party as Jagger and Richard were boasting of their new single Paul slipped the acetate to the DJ and told him to play it. The song totally blew the party and wiped the smile off Jagger's face as he realised that the Beatles were going to release Hey Jude at the same time as their own next single. Sort of took the edge off the celebrations. Never mind, the Beatles and Stones were great buddies anyway.|`|Q5BM2POnaa	I do, though it's far from my favorite Beatles song.<br>  <br>  It was written by Paul McCartney for John's oldest son Julian (who they called Jules but McCartney thought Jude sounded better lyrically).<br>  <br>  It's really not a sad song in terms of the sentiment behind the lyrics.|`|yDnBqGheaa	It shouldn't make you feel sad, its about trial, tribulation, and triumph.<br>  <br>  Its starts sad, but by the end of the song, I feel very uplifted and can't help but smile when I sing the song.|`|ms2H2UZIaa	Yeah its a great song, it makes me really happy.

Smoke can be seen for a long distance, and if the house was consumed in the fire, it would be reasonable to assume the person inside the house was dead. I'm not sure if this riddle has enough information to solve it in one way.<br>  <br>  Another suggestion, since the man is on a hill far away, perhaps it was snowy and he started an avalanche that destroyed the house below, but before it was destroyed he noticed smoke coming from the chimney, and he assumed someone was inside. Ha ha, don't you love that we are back to the smoke again? <br>  <br>  Thanks for asking, it was fun.<br>  <br>  ~ andrew

wic6ut7Qaa	I can't say anything about V for Vendetta, since I've never read it.<br>  <br>  Watchmen, however, is absolute genius, and I highly recommend it. It has more depth than 99% of all of the comics and manga I've ever read...<br>  <br>  I should warn you though, that you might not be old enough for this series yet. It's an extremely gritty 'what if' story that goes into how f-ed up superheroes would be if they really existed, not to mention that there is a lot of violence, and sex (though none of it is gratituous)<br>  <br>  The characters are messed up. One character is a sociopathic moral absolutist. One character has godlike powers and can percieve the past, present, and future all at once, but grows detached from humanity as a result. Another character is like Captain America gone wrong, a vicious sadist and a nihilist. Another character got rich selling superhero toys. Yet another character has split personality issues with his superhero alter ego, so he's a spineless wimp outside of costume.<br>  <br>  The character's backstories, motivations, development, and world views may also take a few re-reads to fully understand, mainly the stories of Rorschach, Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias, and the Comedian.<br>  You might not get the ties into US history either (World War 2, Vietnam, the Nixon Administration, the Cold War, etc.) the first time you read it. I'm in college and I didn't get the whole story the first time I read it!<br>  <br>  Again, I HIGHLY recommend it, but it's for mature audiences only, so you might want to give it a few years before you pick it up, unless you're used to that sort of thing.|`|Hby8UMRLaa	If you're a smart thirteen year old give them a try! They're not your typical super hero stories... so if you're looking for super hero stories I don't recommend them. If you're used to reading novels written for audiences well above your age, you'll do fine with these.<br>  <br>  I loved Watchmen, but V for Vendetta is a good read as well.|`|Vz6eu8oCaa	I can't say anything about the V for Vendetta graphic novel, but Watchmen was amazing!<br>  <br>  I'm not too sure that I would recommend them for a 13 year old, however, as it is extremely graphic.<br>  <br>  To let you form your own opinion without ruining it however, here's some examples:<br>  one of the main characters is naked throughout the entire novel (plus more nudity)<br>  attempted rape<br>  extreme gore in some scenes<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you make your own choice!|`|01D61USWaa	I personally have not read V for Vendetta, but I have read watchmen several times, it is simply the best comic i have read. I would recommend it to anyone who loves piecing together the puzzle pieces of a story full of really well written and illustrated characters.|`|s3jHxRcGaa	I wouldn't recommend it<br>  Thats my opinion|`|f79674f11cb0d8833ea9b2f32ce01461aa	I think they may be a bit too confusing for you

Just pick the one you like.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://all-guitar-chords.com/index.php?ch=F&mm=&get=Get" rel="nofollow">http://all-guitar-chords.com/index.php?c...</a>|`|f1e25342ff66537c8180df460a4b389eaa	the above info is good. there are many ways to play an F chord.<br>  in typical heavy rock, punk and metal music it is played as a power chord.<br>  first finger on the first fret on the E string. the fattest string<br>  3rd finger on the third fret on the A string  the next one down.<br>  thats it two notes and thats all. strum only the two top strings. technically, it is not a chord until it has 3 notes or more, but many pro musicians play it this way. as you get better you can add the rest of the notes. this will work with what Larry S has said. if you combine his way and mine you can strum all the strings for a nice full sound.

uXsCCGV8aa	Yes...I'd rate it 4*<br>  <br>  It was pretty good, good storyline/plot, though I think it moved or progressed slowly.  There was quite good action in the film as Will Smith usually deliver.  The landscaping around had alright realism.<br>  <br>  Have you see it, I recommend you see it, as there were quite a few strong reviews wasn't there?<br>  <br>  By the way nice smart avatar pic.|`|PcRyxJ07aa	I have, and I hated it. Seeing a guy have to kill his own dog was awful. He had to strangle her before she became one of the "monsters". And his wife and son (who was like 2yrs old!) got on a helicopter, the son gave the guy their dog (as a puppy) then and another helicopter crashed into the guys son and wife's helicopter! its awful!|`|bnjjeBLYaa	I liked it. <br>  <br>  Mm, for stars, I'd say? Maybe three and a half.<br>  <br>  It was a little strange, but it was well done and very interesting.|`|nCMUA50Raa	in my opinion it was one of the best if not the best zombie movie made....although the look of the zombies was so repetative|`|UdatjYEQaa	it was very unrealistic.<br>  but it was very good! and it was definetly something WORTH seeing.|`|yI9pFCudaa	It was BRILLIANT!!!<br>  only really sad ..if you're watching it make sure you have <br>  a box of tissues<br>  :]<br>  <br>  5/5|`|EJJtCUKHaa	yup I have<br>  <br>  I would give it 4 stars<br>  at times it was startling and moving<br>  <br>  but other times the plot was lacking<br>  <br>  good acting though :)<br>  will smith<br>  nice :D|`|ek1193Qiaa	it was very good. It was kinda sad...somewhere in the middle of the movie or earlier than that but it was still very very good.|`|D5UAhY8jaa	it is awsome man i dont like the real ending thow i think the alternet ending is better|`|OTLU3Wnsaa	i thought it was ok and the way he had 2 die wasnt right but i thought they did a pretty good job with that movie.|`|P6fT0LBiaa	Yes. 2.5/4 stars.|`|95gVLrIGaa	Yep.

AKnZMOQ5aa	Sylar will definitely win. He can immobolize and kill Goku before you can say PWNED. ;D|`|8ad6fQiNaa	Sylar has a pretty decent chance of winning.

But if you seen both in action, you should know that Sylar would win.<br>  <br>  Sylar is way smarter than Goku<br>  Like I said before, Syalr can't die! He can heal his wounds in seconds. He will stop Goku in his tracks easily, electricute him, cut him open and kill him with all his power!<br>  <br>  Sylar would win!

UJHKyg7kaa	If you get it, you will be seen in the movie, walking by Bella & Edward or Jacob Black or someone thats important, but you will not say anything to them, you may be talking with someone else that makes it. They are like the people walking by in the background. Therefore you will meet all of the main characters and be ont he set and get all maked-up and everything. It would be incredibly exciting!|`|Tr24mmt7aa	are you kdding me?!?!?!!? I wish i was in it. I just read 3 of the books in a week, and just finished the 4th, wow i loved it. I did not like how bells had that baby though. it ruined the hole thing a little. I liked the very ending though, were they said they were going to be together for forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have no idea what a walk-on role is.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	walk on rolls can be seen in twilight <br>  e.g. the scene where bella first comes to the highscool and is looking at her map<br>  the people walking on and off the set in the background are walk on rolls|`|qUD3Kn1Eaa	Website:<br>  'Actors know the "walk-on" as a minor role in a production.  Well-known veteran actors take these roles as a wink to the audience (and usually a favor to the directors).  New actors take these roles to build their credits and eek out a meager paycheck. <br>   Sometimes, however, the actor does such a good job that s/he's hired on for a larger role in the same production.'<br>  <br>  = in other words, just a small part, that's just kind of there, but could help make you a star if you're good enough at it.|`|Tkno91Wwaa	You're just kind of in the shot, but you don't have any lines. You're like, standing there. In the background. It's not that great.|`|iFBZA9mxaa	You should have asked that before entering.|`|BOUlr1OMaa	A walk-on-role is when you simply walk on screen. You don't have any lines or any big movements/actions, but it sounds like a great experience. I played a walk-on for a hand sanitizer commercial (lol, lame i know) last year. It was awesome to see how commercials are shot (it took forever!). Be prepared for a lot of waiting and walking back and forth to your starting point. It gets tiring because it's so repetitive, but its cool to see how these things work! I hope you win, they'll need a LOT of people for this, you would guess, so hopefully you'll get to go!

Perhaps, they see a bit of themselves in their favorite characters, but I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  I know when I read fiction novels, I usually find a character that I can picture as myself... or can picture how I would interact with said character. It's an interesting question, though...|`|c43827ab22ae887ce79b91f8448392acaa	They might be interested if the TV show because it matches their interests.

efx1CpFVaa	I thought it was okay, but I haven't watched the second season.  The anime is turning out a bit...odd.  If your in for the vampire romances then I'm sure you'll like it.  I just don't care for anime with a helpless girl who always has to be saved.  However, the show can be really funny so that's a positive :D|`|APftKj7Saa	I've seen it and i loved it :)<br>  <br>  I thought everything was almost perfect...<br>  -The characters<br>  -The Outfits<br>  -The plot<br>  Etc.<br>  <br>  It got a little complicated at times, but i figured it out XD<br>  <br>  Too bad there are only 2 seasons v_v'<br>  They should totally make another season, or 2, or three XDD<br>  >.><br>  I have to have a serious discussion with the creator >:D|`|lvlsgRDGaa	I thought it was pretty good it in my opinion, I thought the ending was really great. It depends on what kind of anime you like.  If you like romance and drama then you'll probably enjoy it.|`|0pUkVcGIaa	I like it. I love vampire stories and it's my favorite vampire manga/anime.|`|eMMxXjaLaa	hit and miss|`|GOVUsJVVaa	i love it i think she should end up with zero i love it if you haven't read it then i suggest you do|`|ZvOMRSdSaa	I thought it was pretty good, having read the manga as well.|`|ZpsbW8gHaa	crap|`|Slyg7o6Laa	personaly i loved it the guys are so hot although the girl(yuki) is really retarded thats just my opinion cuz i liked zero more !!and she did loads of stupid things but if you havent watched it you still should check it out you might like it too!!
TPLxJEkYaa	Good tastes :)<br>  <br>  If you're into some of that old metal like Scorpions and that, I'd look into Winger (especially Seventeen), Foreigner (Hot Blooded is good), The Who (anything will be great, but I bet you already listen to them).<br>  <br>  The Strokes are also great, kinda a newere grungy sound if you're not familiar.  The White Stripes is similar, along with Jack White's other band The Raconteurs.<br>  <br>  The Decemberists are really good, too, but kinda stretch from what you're into.  Probably some of the best lyrics since The Doors, though.<br>  <br>  A few other random ones you might like Jet, The Fratellis, Electric Six.|`|eRVRWwkBaa	Good taste in music;especially the Crue : D<br>  I'm not much into any of the new bands; I'll like 1-2 songs but I'm thinking their lacking something. Sorry. What is with all the 'growling' these days? : D <br>  Anyway, Accept,Suicidal Tendencies,The Cult,Bad Company,Darkness,Stone Temple Pilot,Heart,Testament,Great White,Whitesnake,Quiet Riot,Janis Joplin,Ramones,Kiss,Queen,SIXX A.M w. Nikki Sixx,Motorhead,the Clash,Queensryche,MenOwar and something unique and good,Apocalyptica. Their on YouTube and Myspace. I like them very original.<br>  Ther older bands you probably know of but...I'm finding new bands to really enjoy hard.

A4qtTlKSaa	So basically you're asking people to do your work for you. I think people did themselves because it was easier, maybe you should reconsider.<br>  <br>  Think of things you associate with movies for your name, like popcorn for example.<br>  <br>  And in regards to your icons well you need to think what it is exactly about movies your website is about. The topic is quite broad. Are you doing about the history of cinema, is it a movie review website, is it info on upcoming movies. Think more specifically what exactly your website is trying to show.

to6JW3yFaa	Dont get ur hopes down from what everyone says. It IS true that Cancers and Aquas are very different in they're styles of love, but Im sure that anyone can make any signs work together if they really want to.<br>  <br>  The problem with this relationship is that Aquas are very independent and dont really like emotional displays of lovey dovey stuff. On the other hand, Cancers like to depend on their partners and NEED to feel loved and have their partners express it. Now Im deinately not saying that Aquas dont express it, it's just that they show it and not really say it. They're motta is "actions speak louder than words." So if they're drawing u stuff, or writing u poems, or taking u to nice romantic places, then they're probably trying to make up for the things that are hard for them to say. So try and look at their actions instead of their lack of words.<br>  <br>  U should understand that it's reallllllly hard for Aquas to say what they feel. Im not exactly sure whyyy but it prob just makes them feel uncomfortable and exposed. They dont want to get hurt. So if an Aqua every says anything really sweet to u, remember that they meant it 100%. Haha and just imagine what it would take for them to say "I love you." ;)<br>  <br>  Just try and be patient with them and understand it from their points of view. Also, when ur deeper into the relationship and when u feel that he truly cares about u, then u should express ur needs to him about how u would like it if he was more open to u about his emotions and stuff. But dont push it. If he really cares about u, he'll try and make an effort. And u should also try and make an effort and give him some space, when u know he wants it. Both of u r going to need to make some compromises in order to make it work, and Im sure u could do it if u want. Good luck!!|`|Jg8ngWj0aa	No, not at all. This match has basically no hopes of turning into real or long-term love. You two are complete opposites when it comes to what you need from relationships. You are a warm, friendly and open-minded person; he is cool and not very open to new people or experiences. You are highly emotional; he is highly intellectual. You get loud and cry when you fight; he just sneers and leaves the room. He is a detached person; you want to be connected to the world through emotion. This is a case of opposites colliding, in the worst way possible. A bad love match for you.|`|3VKiFmMJaa	I agree with the poster above. When I (kind of ) dated an aquarius it was the worst time of my life literally he was terrible it got so bad I had to change my number because he wouldn't leave me alone and I hated him.   If u really like him then go for it my best girl friend is Aquarius but i can't stand the guys. Sorry

Its for a more mature audience, and is comedy drama. It's<br>  <br>   Wiki=   The plot revolves around a widowed housewife from a California suburb who becomes her neighborhood's marijuana dealer to make ends meet.<br>  It's hilarious at times and serious and sad at other times. I REALLY think yo will like it! It shows on lifetime, but I don't have that so I watch it online at www.surfthechannel.com. That website is awesome and totally free!<br>  <br>  I also like Pushing Daisies. It's really whimsical and cool and its about a pie maker who as the gift to to bring dead things back to life= but there's a twist!! If he keeps the dead person "alive" for more than a minute, someone else has to die. And if he touches the "dead" person again, they are dead forever.

U8aXa8xEaa	Grady told Phillip that Alan hired him to frame Bill for Lizzie's kidnapping even though Alan knew Grady did it.  Then when Grady threatened Lizzie's life if he didn't cooperate with the plan to testify against Alan, Phillip grabbed Grady by the lapels and they struggled.  They were standing near the edge of a cliff at the time and Grady went over the side of the cliff.  Phillip panicked for a moment, but then he went to the reunion and acted like nothing happened. <br>  <br>  Lizzie told Frank that it was Grady's voice on Bill's phone.  Frank ran home to make sure Daisy was ok.  Buzz told Frank that she went out with Ashley.  Frank told Buzz that it looks like Grady is Lizzie's kidnapper.  Buzz begged Frank not arrest him so he can testify against Alan.  Frank wouldn't budge though.  He's planning on arresting him anyway.  (Ashley dropped Daisy off and Daisy is still waiting for Grady to come pick her up.)<br>  <br>  Lizzie figured out that Cyrus was protecting Grady.  She fired him and Cyrus told her everything.  Then he convinced Lizzie to let him help her find Bill.  But before they could leave,a big truck blocks the driveway.  Lizzie started yelling at Cyrus to tell the guy in the truck to get out of the way, but then the guy got out of the truck and it was Bill!  She ran up to him and gave him a big kiss.  <br>  <br>  The End.
pXHgU4Xuaa	Titanic 2<br>  <br>  The year is 2251 the starship Titanic is about to make its maiden voyage from Mercury to Pluto.  Rose, a distant relative of the original Rose is in an unhappy relationship with a Martian colonist readies for a trip on the starship Titanic. Meanwhile a clone made from skeletal DNA found at the bottom of the ocean escapes the lab and stows away aboard the ship.  Rose and Jack meet.  Jack has all his previous memories and Rose happens to look just like her great great great grandmother.  They fall in love much to the anger of the martian.  The starship trys to beat the speed record by flying at dangerous speeds and collides with an asteroid!  There are not enough escape pods for everyone.  Amidst the chaos the martian chases Jack and Rose with a ray gun all over the starship.  Eventually the martian gives up and saves himself into the last remaining pod.  Air is leaking from the starship and people are getting sucked out into space.  With the ship about the split apart at the seams Jack finds an airtight safe and an oxygen tank and puts Rose into it.  There is not enough room for the both of them.  He closes the door right as he and the safe are sucked into space.  The Starship Titanic breaks in half and the safe and jack float away.  Frozen Jack eventually separates and drifts away by himself.  Rose is later rescued.

71ME3IBjaa	its comin out May 19th and he said hes coming out with a Relapse 2 at the end of 2009 here is he said: <br>  <br>  SANTA MONICA, CA - March 5, 2009 – Eminem, the biggest selling music artist of the decade, officially announced the street date of his eagerly awaited new album; his first original studio album in over four years. Relapse (Interscope/ Aftermath/Shady) will be released on May 19, 2009. The first single from the album and its accompanying video will see a simultaneous release on April 7th.<br>  <br>  Anticipation for Relapse has been building since the fall, when Eminem first announced the album title and debuted the freestyle, “I’m Having A Relapse,” during an interview on his Shade 45 satellite radio station. Last month, the release of “Crack A Bottle” from Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent brought that anticipation to a head. The track soared to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 (Eminem’s second #1 after 2002’s “Lose Yourself”) and set a Nielsen SoundScan record for opening week download sales (418,000). The recording ranked third in the history of all weekly download sales. “Crack A Bottle” will be included as an album track on Relapse.<br>  <br>  With the announcement of the release date for Relapse also comes confirmation of something that had been rumored in recent weeks: Eminem is already working on a follow-up album, Relapse 2, that fans can expect in the second half of 2009. “A lot of people were expecting Relapse to drop last year,” said Eminem. “I was one of them. Then Dre and I went back in the studio in September for a few days, and that turned into six months. We were on such a roll; we wound up with a ton of new music produced by Dre. Putting out Relapse 2 will let everyone get all of the best stuff.”<br>  <br>  Eminem has sold more than 75,000,000 albums worldwide. His previous studio album, Encore, reached #1 and dominated the charts in late 2004. Certified quadruple platinum and spinning off four Top 40 Hot 100 hits, the Grammy-nominated disc has sold more than 11,000,000 copies around the globe. The #1, double platinum, 2005 greatest hits collection, Curtain Call: The Hits and #2, platinum, 2006 various artists compilation, Eminem Presents: The Re-Up, followed. In October 2008, Eminem released “Eminem: The Way I Am”, a book compiling thoughts, stories, and memorabilia from various points in his life. The book entered the New York Times Best-Seller list at #11|`|Rz6BtwdPaa	Its sayes on his myspace. (blog)

6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Alright, if you really want to know why he was naked most of the time, I'll tell you.<br>  <br>  Yes, there is an underlying significance.  The character of Doctor Manhattan has become super-human and is losing touch with his humanity.  In fact, he's losing touch with humanity in general.  If you'll notice, he once wore a full costume (or at least enough material to count as boxer briefs and a t-shirt), and then it was scaled back to just the shorts, and then it became a kind of zig-zaggy thong, and then it just disappeared.<br>  <br>  It's symbolic.  The less clothing he wears, the more he's disconnected from society and humanity in general.  He wears clothing when he "must" for public appearances, but otherwise he doesn't bother with such "trivial" niceties as clothing anymore.<br>  <br>  Oh, and yes, that's how it worked in the graphic novel too.  His increasing nakedness was symbolic in the graphic novel like it was in the movie.  The point wasn't simply to show a penis... it was to tell a story about Manhattan and his growing inability to relate to being human.|`|cf64157ac10119178090cc78fd234a19aa	Dr. Manhattan is nude in the graphic novel and the director really wanted to stay true to it.|`|y2pErbI2aa	That's just the way he was drawn in the graphic novel, and I guess Zack Snyder (the director) wanted to keep things authentic|`|W9anwUl2aa	Paolo is correct.

I know you're not supposed to put values on lives, but if any one of those 100 people would amount to more than me, I prolly would. If they were all really unhealthy or old or not really living their life anyways, why should i give up mine? I'm healthy, happy and stiving to make the world a better place. I'm loved and i want to be a nurse someday. My death would have a very negative impact of my sphere of influence, but if i thought the 100 lives could make more of a positive impact in the long run...<br>  <br>  So the answer is no. There would not be enough time to think and decided and i would just go with my basic animalistic survival instinct and save myself.<br>  <br>  I changed my mind. Yes. I just thought it thru so that now if i was ever put in that situation I would be able to decide very fast by recalling this question. Thank you. I've determined that the death of 100 completely random people would affect all their loved ones and people that new them and i want to believe that they will use my death and decide to make the most of their lives.<br>  <br>  God, you made me think :( I'm gonna go lie down now...<br>  <br>  And I'm half-asian, so my ninja skills are superior :P|`|g3IXprk9aa	I don't know.

aYNoQvfMaa	Hmmm... Oliver Stone made a film that played on popular conception rather than focusing on what actually happened? That, my friend, is what is hogwash.<br>  <br>  I mean come on, this is a man that wrote Scarface, and made JFK, Nixon, and Natural Born Killers. Now we all know how incredibly accurate each one of those films are. I seriously doubt anything he's ever written, said, or made has had any fallacy in it ever. (sarcasm).
mzhFrm5Taa	I have gotten away with not doing P.E this entire year, since the start of the school year back in September. At my school, we have to take in P.E clothes, we're not meant to do P.E in our uniform, the obvious excuse for us is that we forgot our sports clothes. It's the lamest excuse ever but it works. Then when they say ''you can't forget your P.E clothes this much times, I'm puting you on dentention'' you can just well up with tears and cry and act offended and say it's not your fault, you just have a disease. Trust me, it really works.<br>  <br>  If you have a guy teacher, tell him you have stomach cramps. They get soooo awkward, they just walk away and don't say anything Haha. It really is another classic, great excuse. They feel too awkward to say anything else so your good. Although this can only be used every four weeks or so..But still. It'll work wonders when you do use it.<br>  <br>  You could mush up some porridge or oatmeal with milk, put it in your mouth(not being obvious that there's something in your mouth). Get your friends to say you feel a bit sick, then ''puke'' our the oatmeal. Ahh, works awesomely aswell. It really looks like puke.<br>  <br>  You could also go with the obvious, such as, you hurt your leg. If they ask why you don't have like a note from your mum, you can say you fell at school earlier that day or on your into school. Your mum can't deny that. Nor can the P.E teacher. <br>  <br>  You could also say it goes against you don't believe in P.E., it's not in your belief system. They can't argue with that.<br>  <br>  You could say your too paranois and afraid of getting seriously injured or getting a heart attack because your ''uncle just died from a heart attack he got while playing basketball.'' <br>  <br>  These alllllllllll work absoloute wonders!

cMZEmpp0aa	Well, you can always get a BJD and attach your own strings to it. However, they tend to come in a limited range of colors (tanned and dark-skinned dolls are fairly new to the market) and adding strings would only be for looks, since most of the large dolls are too heavy to really be moved like that. That said, you could probably paint or stain your doll into almost any tone you wanted (I would suggest getting some small parts of damaged dolls to practice on first, if you can), and adding strings for show wouldn't be that difficult. You could probably even get the exact mold used in the video -- I seem to remember that someone had identified the doll mold, but now I can't remember the mold or where I found that info. You could probably dig it up on some doll websites like Den of Angels if you really want to know, though.|`|nQ3kFPMVaa	Generally, a puppet presented on TV or on stage is copyrighted, and unless sold as merchandise, you won't find any replicas sold. If you want something for decoration, then check out whether or not there is merchandise available from the artist.<br>  <br>  If you want a puppet for a performance, then I suggest you come up with your own designs and either make it yourself or commission a puppet maker. (Puppet makers can and do refuse to make replicas of copyrighted designs)<br>  <br>  You can't find puppets like what you want in your local toy store. You're either going to have to order it from an online puppet seller (like czechmarionettes.com), or have it custom made.<br>  <br>  If you want to find some puppet makers, head to www.puppetsandstuff.com, there are plenty online. Alternatively, do a google search for UNIMA (the puppetry union, it has branches around the world) in your country, which will have info on how to find a local puppet maker.

cuIX13BKaa	Great question. Libra women are ethereal and dreamy. It is known as the most beautiful sign of the Zodiac. Any man would be fortunate to snag a Libra and what men do not understand is just how precious Libra women are. Let's face it that most men need to be taught how to treat any of us and Libra will not stand for being stood up or to have promises not kept. Another Libra is always an interesting combination though they have a tendency to be somewhat selfish. Virgo men think they are knights in shining armour and can be pretty stuck on themselves. Scorpio men to the lovely Libra woman need to realize that she is always son a honeymoon and there is nothing wrong with that. Scorpio can be selfish until it is pointed out to them that they are not the star of this relationship. Cancer men have a lot of insecurities and love the air signs, but can they be faithful? They must be shown that Libra is the boss and her bidding will be done. Strangely Capricorn men are wonderful partners as they are made of the 'politics' of any given situation. Capricorn men express themselves wonderfully and have wonderful humour. They can be counted on to be lavish wherein Aries I have found to be stingy and this is one case where though opposites may attract it is that Libra's air to Aries fire and testosterone ultimately comes to an end as she is weary of fanning his flames and retreats to the sanctuary of another sign that listens. Leo men find the ethereal Libra enchanting, but does Libra feel the same way? Most often not. Sagittarius is a fun sign for the Libra woman as it stimulates her sense of beauty and culture and these can remain friends for all of time. Gemini men if they are listening early on really do get the message and never want to see a relationship end making great life partners or friends. Any of the signs might prove me wrong however this is my experience. I bid you well.....<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|AQwoCjj3aa	All of my best friends in the past have been Libra Woman, and I am an Aries.  I personally think that they are creative, sensitive, charming, friendly, and nice.  Aries and Libra are opposites, but in this case opposites attract.|`|7rrNvFK7aa	Libra women are just like the first poster said, beautiful. They are hotter than hot and pinker than pink. Us librans are graceful and I don't know about the selfish stuff. Maybe <br>  <br>  <br>  Libra sign|`|AA11245783	they are very sweet and peace-loving|`|gmVX2nZnaa	I think my libra chick friends give the best advice. They don't seem too judgmental or lecturing.

hJk9YZrAaa	Learn to do something together.  Take a cooking class, or art, or music.|`|KBkTDOZUaa	why does it have to be love songs? Just ask him what kind of music he's into and try and find some different/ up-and-coming bands that suit his taste. Then burn a CD with a variation of the bands you found. That's a whole lot more personal and considerate. Why not do something together like an assault course or paint-balling. Or go sphereing that sounds like fun and you can achieve something together whilst having each others support. You don't have to be predictable as long as you're prepared to think creatively.|`|L0QYYdxUaa	Well what i do sometimes is just take a walk in the local park on his b-day i got through him a surprise party with all his buds there he loved it!!

A baby is born in town at the same moment the bus crashes. The spirits of the four passengers are tied to the baby, Thomas. For some reason, Thomas can see them and grows fond of them. However, when people think that Thomas might have something wrong with him, they decide not to let Thomas see them, which devastates him. Thirty years later, Thomas has become a little jaded when it comes to letting people into his life, and the four of them are still with him though he can't see them. One day, they learn something vital to their salvation, forcing them  they to once more appear to him. They have learned that each must complete a final task before finally going to Heaven.<br>  Here's the movie trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kby6fF-eakM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kby6fF-ea...</a><br>  Here's Part 1 on YouTube!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R71ev-mk3c&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=8AA2A2925D0A97B0&index=36" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R71ev-mk...</a>|`|8g06tQ61aa	I never heard of it.

gGZz2EGyaa	The only thing I would suggest is to go onto the Countdown Channel 4 web site and email her from that site.  I have put the web site below.  I even tried putting her name in search but it only brings up one site and there is no contact for her on that just general information about her.  I have listed it as well, but as far as I can see there is nothing on it but I might have missed something.  Good luck.

5FYlXexLaa	You'd probably like Twin Peaks. Much like Daisies it was canceled before it should have been. The whole series of Twin Peaks is available on DVD. <br>  <br>  I will warn that although Twin Peaks can be very colorful, happy, and certainly unique, it can also be very very dark. But that is also what makes it so great.|`|6Ey9TYIhaa	Bones<br>  ER<br>  One tree hill (MAYBE)<br>  hope it helps, bones is the funniest<br>  oha nd forgot one: NCIS|`|88621de6d733c17b5cb18c7075ff1b1eaa	The french movie amelie has the same aesthetic as pushing daisies.<br>   It might not be as "colorful" and "happy" as P.D but there are 2 other shows that were made by the same man(bryan fuller). "wonderfalls" and "dead like me". I'd recommend them both as I like all of the shows he has made.|`|I8DXi3B3aa	Honestly, I don't think there is anything like it.<br>  <br>  You could try replacing it with a mix of shows: like Psych, which is happy, but not particularly colorful or unique, HeadCase or Arrested Development which are unique, but not colorful or happy.<br>  <br>  Colorful is harder to come by, mostly I am reminded of Sesame Street and HGTV shows. Adult Swim has Home Movies, which is pretty colorful, but not in the metaphor laden way Pushing Daisies was. Sigh.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm in total agreement with you about how fun that show was.

nMWtEmEFaa	I'm usually a big pansy, but this movie was really horrible and badly done. The special effects to make the film look creepy were just .. laughable.<br>  <br>  There were SOME parts in there that were kind of creepy (like, not knowing when the bad guy will appear around the corner to kill you etc).<br>  <br>  They have a scene were some person is walking on his hands and legs like The Grudge (it looked really pathetically done and not scary at all), and lots of heads rotating and stuff.<br>  <br>  The storyline was really .. stupid. Something about a a demon of some sorts trying to enter this world through a portal (they can enter through a mirror, and what better mirror is there than another copy of yourself; aka a twin?), and failing at it. I didn't care about the characters, and I was actually hoping for all of them to die at the end. <br>  <br>  I'd say, keep your money.|`|OVBuC8uZaa	It's not that scary, just the weird faces and monster things are scary. But if you're scared of most horror films then yeah you're going to be scared.<br>  <br>  P.S. If you're looking to being really scared watch The Uninvited
