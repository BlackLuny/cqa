I'm from Iowa where last week the temperature was in the -30's and all I heard was "so much for global warming".     If people actually wanted to learn the right facts rather than hear it from their parents opinion, they would actually understand what global warming is.     Global warming affects harsher weather such as floods, tornadoes, and so on. And of course global warming is cause by humans. EVERYTHING is affected by humans. Nature, animals, wildlife, and yes climate change.     There's no doubt that pollution is bad for us.       AND anyways if you really truly care for the earth. You'll do what you can to care for it. It shouldn't matter if you believe in it or not.

The real question is whether it's part of a natural cycle, caused/or influenced by man, or the result of something else entirely.    One thing that is interesting to note. While all the years in this century have been the hottest on record, the past two years have shown a downward trend. The question remains to be answer whether it's just an anomaly in a larger trend, or the start of a new trend.|`|DUOoMBqoaa	Climate change, definitely. Weather is getting erratic and more extreme.

7f7a52e305734e0a60a00a89605dd353aa	Yep, it is the sun.  To simplify the hydrologic cycle - Thermal energy evaporates water into a vapor which is brought to the atmosphere.  Thermal energy directly, and indirectly, produces the upper atmosphere currents that move the vapor around in clouds. Cold air can hold less water than warm air and since temperature generally declines with elevation the vapor begins to coalesce into rain drops and falls to the ground as precipitation where it travels to lakes, rivers, seas and oceans from which it is evaporated yet again.    The link is to one of the hundreds of images of the water cycle. The second link is to a good summary of the cycle with links to concepts such as evaporation, water budget, transpiration, etc.|`|5TmGu6LAaa	The sun is the energy that runs the cycle because without it then evaporation would never happen and without evaporation then we can't form clouds

Some of it is man made, by people who compile temperature records and do not properly account for the Urban heat Island effect.    But is can not be greenhouse warming because if it was, the troposphere would be warming at a faster rate than ground temperatures.  The opposite is true. It is warming at a lesser rate.    Edit:  I am glad you  agree, so now you can remove your question.  But seriously, that is a flawed logic.  Can you imagine years ago when they could not explain pulsars, and they concluded it has to be UFOs, since we can not think of anything else.  To prove your case, you have to prove it is co2.  The IPCC says if it is greenhouse warming it will have its  signature in the troposphere and as such it should be warming at a rate greater than ground temperatures.  But it is not.  Both balloon and satellite data confirm this. Therefore, one can not also conclude it is greenhouse warming.|`|DIBo12zjaa	The problem is short term verses long term. Escalation of CO2 doesn't correspond to population. Also they don't use PDO's nor El nino's for historical modeling, just for current simulation.

Scafetta1 and B. J. West1,2) Fig. 2. During the PDO cool cycle during the 40's through the 70's solar activity was high, the PDO cool cycle was not very effective at cooling the globe because of increased solar activity. The 1980's saw a renewed burst of solar activity along with the PDO warm cycle which consequently just ended a few years ago. However the Early 80's and early to mid 90's were tempered by volcanic activity and should have been warmer, which would have resulted in a steeper cooling trend than what we are currently observing, and somewhere entangled in all this mess is a linear trend of some small quantity associated with the added forcing of your CO2, if it's even measurable.    EDIT Dana:    Yes it does, if you do not understand how to look at a graph, please stop attempting scientific debate, a combination of increased solar activity and the PDO cause the warming between 1945 to present.    From 1977 to 1980 (3 years) the temperature jumped .2 degrees according to your data, it can only be explained by a PDO phase change, not CO2, emission controls or any other anthropagenic factor.    http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...  .  .|`|a85bd4d28281b52b7bdecfc33cd65da3aa	As with Tomcat, Im still not convinced that the Sun isnt a major factor.    If the rise was caused by CO2, then why is it that, in the last decade, CO2 rose 30% more than the average of the previous two decades, while temperature rose 40% less, and has been falling for the last 8 years?    If CO2 is currently rising faster than ever, shouldnt temperature be rising faster than ever as well?    So, what has caused the temperature to fall for the last 8 years?    And if climate scientists are so sure that they absolutely *KNOW* how the climate works (as we are lead to believe), then why didnt they predict this 8 year cooling phase?
cBNjgxW9aa	What you are describing is a perpetual motion machine.  The problem is that the fans to keep the turbine blades revolving would take more power than the turbines could produce.    But there is good news-at the height most turbines are set-in the areas that are chosen-there is almost always enough wind to turn the blades.  Where I live is a big wind energy area, and in the several years since the first turbines went up, nary a day has gone by that there wasn't enough wind to spin the blades.    The last I heard, turbines operate at about 60% of capacity, mostly down from the 100% level for scheduled maintenance.  The figure I was given is that a 1 MW turbine produces over $370,000 of electricity per year at that capacity.  With a 20 year minimum life span, I heard the payback is 6-8 years so the company is generating large profits for 14 years-and when the turbine's life span is exhausted, they don't have to replace all the infrastructure, they just replace the turbine.    So you can see that, as long as these figures are valid, there is no need for a perpetual motion machine.|`|YPtNr2O6aa	I understand what you are saying but you'd need one hell of a big (and energy guzzling) fan to move the blades of a wind turbine. I have a feeling that since wind turbines don't produce a huge amount of electricity as it is, once the wind stops and fan starts to blow it - the little power it would produce wouldn't be enough to power the fan and would promptly stop.  you'd be using the same amount of energy, if not more, to move the blades than the blades would produce as a result.    Im sure there must be some other reason(s) why it wouldn't work - but i cant think of anything other than what ive already said|`|AA12114251	Keep thinking about it-the light bulb sounded stupid before Edison figured out how to make it work.

Mhm3J5g0aa	How about because we don't believe liars ?  Remember the NASA scientist that claimed we had 20 years left ? well 20 years later and we are still here and nothing has significantly changed.  How about the one that said the seas had 10 years ? Its been that and still no change.  The irresponsible and BS we've been told by science just has not happened in the real world. They can only duplicate it under laboratory conditions.  Remember that "ozone hole" ? well the hole was biggest in 1956 before the use of CFC and was determined by credible scientists that it was due to the extreme cold.  How many times do we have to be lied to about drowning polar bears ? 75% of the actually live in Canada and the population has quadrupled since the 50's.  So the real question is how are you so sucked into the farce of Global warming ? Why do you so easily believe the lies ?  They take a picture of a receeding glacier and whine about global warming....then when the glacier returns to normal they keep quiet.  They cry about ice melt but neglect to tell you about the underwater volcanoes.  The evidence needs to be collected without bias and even then people aren't smart enough to actually duplicate much less predict the future patterns of weather.  When your supposed "experts" are caught lying to the population or on the pay role of leftist political parties...what do you expect ?  I've seen things do nothing but improve from the 70's on, we have been gradually cleaning up the air and water and we didn't jump on some "green warrior band wagon" and demand change now and hurt people's cost of living like they are doing now.  The planet is here for humanity, not the other way around, and if your alright with screwing people over to get rich or advance your agenda, then your no true humanitarian and your agenda is misguided. The whole idea was to make people aware and bring about gradual change in "bite sizes" so it doesn't make people hurt financially. Technology changes also govern how fast we change.  Just why is government telling us we have to use only Compact Flourescent bulbs by 2012 when there's no CFB's that work with dimmer switches and other controllers ?

Perhaps you are reading the causes of global warming. The reason people don't believe global warming exists is more of a political subject, and you are not likely to find it in a textbook.   One of the reasons people don't believe in global warming is because the people who explain it to them aren't willing to empathize with them and understand why they don't believe in Global Warming. So the people who don't believe in global warming, are simply confused, uninformed, or stubborn in their beliefs.    The main reason people don't believe in global warming is that doing so will change their lives, and humans in general have to take change slowly. Think of slavery and how long it took for people to realize how wrong it was, and even now there are still people who support racism.    I would have given a shorter answer had it been that simple, but it's not. I hope I answered your question.   I honestly don't believe in global warming, but this is my personal theory to why people don't believe in it.

20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	I think the question should be rephrased "how sure are you that AGW is wrong?".  Because Tomcat copped out in saying he's 75% sure he's right but doesn't care if he's wrong.  Apparently if he's wrong, it still doesn't mean AGW is right.  Although that's better than eric, who can't even answer the question.    That's the thing about denial - it doesn't leave any room for doubt.  The whole reason they're in denial is that they're scared of the consequences if AGW is right.  If they admit they're not sure AGW is wrong, they have to consider the consequences.  And it's quite evident that deniers don't have the balls to consider the consequences if AGW is right.  That's why they cover all the bases.    The planet isn't warming.  But if it is warming, then humans aren't causing it.  But if we are causing it, then the warming will be beneficial.    It doesn't extend beyond that.  They won't allow themselves to consider the possibility that AGW is correct.  Too scary, no balls.    Personally, I do think I'm a skeptic.  A real skeptic, like any scientist, and not a "skeptic", like a denier.  I'm 99% sure humans are the primary cause of the warming over the past 30 years, and if we don't reduce our emissions significantly very soon, it will have catastrophic consequences.  How much they need to be reduced and how quickly and how best to accomplish that, I'm much less certain about.|`|a85bd4d28281b52b7bdecfc33cd65da3aa	About what, Dawei? You need to more accurately define your question.    And the same is true about the second part of your question    And if you do end up being wrong    Wrong about what?    If were talking about some kind of catastrophe (20ft of sea level rise, mass extinctions and the deaths of millions of people) then Id say 99.999% and yes, of course, it would bother me if I was wrong.     However, Id have long since changed my mind before it happened, because if that *is* where the climate is heading (big if) then some decent evidence might just show up before we get there.    As weve discussed before, any money that gets spent on combating catastrophic Global Warming, must be diverted from other good causes. So, how sure are you? And would it bother you if you were wrong?    ::Edit::    In response to your added info    OK, in the limited sense of how sure are you that man is not causing global warming. My answer would be 0%. Why? Because I completely accept that mankind *IS* adding CO2 to the atmosphere. CO2 *IS* a greenhouse gas. Therefore mankind *IS* causing (some) Global Warming. No sane person can dispute that.    So, should I be worried about that?|`|0eFSeap5aa	You misunderstand the nature of knowledge, much as creationists think intelligent design belongs in a science curriculum or atheism is a form of religion.

I'm pretty close to 100% sure there will be temperatures a year from now and ten years from now.  But what those temperatures will be, of that I am not certain, nor do I believe anyone else is.    Try this thought experiment.  Pick out 50 cities scattered across the globe and predict their high, low, and average temperatures for next week and see how close you get, then try it for a month out, then a year, then five.  The farther into time you go, the more variables that can weigh on the outcome, and thus the greater chance of error.  At some point your predictions get washed out in the noise, that is to say your predictions become random because of the random nature of things.  They will have no correlation with what will happen.|`|C1d7VL5xaa	no one will ever know but regardless of the fact we are still destroying the enviorment so why not take all the precautions we can!|`|AA11289359	OK so what if we are all wrong!  Point is every time we try to do what we think is right for the plant we seem to always get it wrong.  This world is much more complex than we seem to think it is. It is a living breathing thing (maybe not in the same as you and I ) we breath oxygen while all plant life converts Co2 and sun light to breath. So now you want to take away the very thing that plants live on, and if we are wrong on that one we have sealed all of humanities fate.  PS  Co2 is only 0.037% of all earths atmosphere.|`|xo7Ea5fZaa	100% SURE.  If I was wrong, you would not be asking this question.  The AGW theory would be undeniably provable by any and every scientist on the planet.  It isn't and it can't.  Science is not pick and choose the data that supports your theory.  Next year might be warmer than this year, and they will all scream "See I told you so !"  How sure are you?  I hope you ask this in an objective manner and not looking for someone to regurgitate your own belief back in your mouth.|`|j8G3WkI2aa	I am 100% sure I am correct, based on other scientists conclusions as well as my own.  I believe that most people who "believe in" AGW (what a term there, I didn't think science needed "belief") are either ignorant of the actual data, been swayed by the media hype, or in it for the money (the other green stuff).  Or possibly more than one of the above.  Looking honestly and fairly at ALL the data, it is impossible to hold firmly to AGW.  On a side note, AGW is no longer the best term to describe this alleged "phenomenon," another phrase more commonly being thrown about is "Climate Change," which is just green-speak for "It isn't necessarily getting warmer, in fact it may be cooling, but that doesn't mean we don't need your money."|`|1oxBCtmZaa	I'm 100% sure that I'm right.    I'm not a denier, I'm a skeptic - I'm 100% right that man-made global warming remains unproven.    It may one day be proven.       What if one day it is, and until that day we don't act?        Wouldn't bother me one bit.    Burden's on the people wanting to limit everyone else's freedom to justify that.      It's like blaming the defense lawyers when a criminal defendant walks because the prosecutors bungled their case.|`|NqGkbDetaa	I didn't realize that Dana had joined the ranks of the Skeptics...... Welcome!!!!|`|db77723b96fc01eeed3d85a8a58e79ecaa	I think that based on the available evidence I've drawn the most reasonable conclusion I was able. I don't think I could meaningfully quantify my level of confidence in that conclusion. Let's say I'm confident enough to believe that immediate action is warranted, yet prepared to revise my position if and when evidence to the contrary comes to light.|`|2hE5Dvnyaa	I am a skeptic, yes!  Being a skeptic doesn't mean I think  I'm 100% right. It means I have doubt that GW is 100% man made.  My science background taught me to be skeptical.  I have about 72.4% doubt that man is the only cause.. To the 100% believers, it makes me a heretic!|`|ciIWFqLmaa	I love a dare.  Is there any doubt?  Go stand outside in your shorts.  The US has had some record breaking cold temps this year.  Ive been around a long time, Ive seen warm years followed by cold years, seems pretty natural.  Id say Im 100% sure that there is scam. You will realize the fact when you see how much the government will make ($$$) off of carbon taxes.  18 states have already started planning their own taxes on carbon emissions on cars, coming soon to you area. Im not worried, I love the fact that those who fell for the scam will pay the same price as those who were right. Question is: can we impeach a Nobel prize winner?|`|AA12114251	If you mean CO2 causes warming- I'm aware of facts that everyone ignores regarding how climate is powered. Science has no clue about how the power of the Earth is making things happen. Science makes models and hide from facts about Earth's power. They like to pretend mankind has much more power than nature has as you can see if you open any of several lines of reasoning about the energy balance of Earth.  Anyway, I'm 100% sure CO2 does not cause warming or cooling even if it seems to do so. But I'm really sure the mess should be cleaned up.|`|AA11225096	The point is that it is the job of the people putting forth the theory of man-made global warming to PROVE YOUR THEORY!!    It is you (or the AGW proponents) to convince the rest of us that the theory is true. It is up to the scientists that claim man-made global warming is in fact occuring, to put forth their theory, provide the evidence and their data, and allow others to examine it and attempt to duolicate the results. Even Einstein had to prove his theories and allow others to confirm his theories before the scientific community accepted them.    In this case, AGW scientists put forth models that are continually wrong, continually changed to fit the current climate events, the data is massaged, cherry picked and fudged, and in some cases the data used to put forth these models and theories are held from testing and scrutiny by their peers. Sometimes the methods are flawed.    So it is not the job of the skeptics to disprove AGW. It is the job of those that state it is happening to convince the rest of us beyond all or most reasonable doubt.    And so I can ask the same question. If AGW is wrong, will it have been worth the damage it could do to the environment, our economies around the world, and the people affected?|`|fcb9c7d570ea4f9bf655c4348c507672aa	Well, the fact is that the theory of AGW as absolutely no evidence to suggest it has anything to do with mankind. So every time some loon comes up with  a ******** idea, we should spend billions just in case it is real. Should we now spend billions in case a meteor hits the planet (we would have as much chance of stopping that as we can effect the climate). Should we spend trillions based on the outside chance the super volcano in America does erupt? The notion of spending billions on an unproven theory is not only ignorant, it is down right idiotic.     And, have you ever considered the benefits of a warming globe? Plants have been scientifically shown to grow 30 to 40% better in high CO2 environments. Humans have also prospered in the previous warmer climates. As far as weighing the positive vs the negative, the positives far out weigh the negative.|`|WA0ebmpsaa	its madness to believe we aren't having an effect on the planet|`|t1zlbOURaa	I'm 99.983% certain that people have virtually no effect on the climate of the earth.    Wouldn't bother me a bit if I was wrong. Humanity has adapted to much warmer and much cooler climates, and the sun has created those.    I'm also 100% certain that belief in AGW is more religion than science.    -- Your question is a typical dodge of the unsure. The "but if I'm right we've only improved things" tactic, which fools fewer and fewer people as they realize the socialist agenda of most of the AGW bible-thumper crowd.|`|eI0IUHQ2aa	CO2 up 15% in atmos since 1998     Global Temps are cooler since 1998    Obviously it has nothing to do with CO2|`|pZi3HXdnaa	Im about 75% sure I am right, and if I am wrong, I would be relieved, I don't think it will be that bad for the US, and I could care less about Bangladesh.

Work to unlearn poor ecological habits|`|qp6Mus6yaa	here is some ways to go green 1. Get a High-Efficiency Showerhead  A high-efficiency showerhead saves up to 3,000 gallons of water per person per year. You'll also save $50 of energy costs and 1,000 .lbs of carbon dioxide per person per year. Today's latest and greatest are specially designed to conserve resources while still feeling like a decadent showerhead. Sink aerator attachments also save major water and go for as little as $2 per sink.    2. Recycle Water in Your Bathroom  Use devices such as the Sink Positive system, which allows you to reuse sink water for flushing your toilet. Or keep a bucket by the shower or tub and fill it with the cold water that comes out before the hot water kicks in. Then you can take the bucket outside and use it to water your plants.    3. Compost  Use a composter to turn your food and lawn wastes into rich mulch. It's a great way to reduce your trash production, and the combination of food waste and all of those falling leaves is the perfect mix for composting. Next spring you'll have rich compost ready to go for spring planting.    4. Purchase Green Power from Your Utility  Most charge less than $5 per month extra. Not only will your power come from a renewable source, but you'll use the power of your spending to show utility executives and government officials that we need more investment in renewable energy projects.    5. Improve the Efficiency of Your Existing Hot Water Heater  Tankless and solar hot water heaters are great, but simple changes to your existing setup can cut your energy bills and carbon emissions by 25 percent or more. Reduce the temperature of your hot water heater to 120 degrees, wrap it in a water heater insulating blanket and insulate the first 3 to 6 feet of hot and cold water pipes. These changes should take you less than an hour and cost less than $50 to complete.    6. Use High-Efficiency Outdoor Lighting  A typical 100-watt floodlight, if used for six hours per day, can consume up to $40 of electricity over the course of a year and produce upwards of 400 pounds of CO2 depending on where you live. For starters, replace those floodlights with compact-fluorescent versions  they're just as bright and use 1/4 the energy. Next, replace low-wattage halogen landscape bulbs with LED versions. They cut energy use by over 80 percent and can last for 10 years or more. Finally, install motion sensors on any nonessential lights. New versions just screw right into your existing light socket.    7. Replace High-Use Indoor Lights with Compact Fluorescents or LEDs  Today's compact fluorescent bulbs are better than ever. No long waits to get up to full power, high-quality light, sizes for almost any fixture and even versions that are dimmable for all of those recessed lights. They're more expensive to begin with, but between energy savings and much longer lifespan they pay for themselves in less than two years. Also, consider LED bulbs for those non-dimmable circuits (especially for holiday lighting). They are true energy misers, and will last for as long as you live in your house.    8. Load Up the Washing Machines  Make sure you run dishwashers and clothes washers only when they're full. Clothes washers are huge energy and water users, so make sure you're doing full loads (or adjusting the water setting) whenever possible. And most of us use far more water (and soap) then we need to when hand-washing, especially when compared to todays' high-efficiency Energy Star dishwashers. So save your time, water and power by putting those dishes directly in the dishwasher after a meal.    9. Drive Smarter  Hybrids, biodiesels, electric - today we have more choices than ever when it comes to efficient transportation. But, some simple changes in our existing driving habits can improve fuel efficiency by up to 25%. Tips include driving at (or near!) the speed limit, keeping your tires inflated, making sure oil and air filters are clean, and stepping on the gas / brakes carefully. Driving like a drag racer may be fun, but it has a substantial environmental cost!    10. Avoid the Daily Waste of Fast Food and Shopping  Next week, keep track of how much trash you generate by eating out and making trips to the store, I guarantee you'll be amazed! All of those bags, cups, and containers really add up and are stuffing our landfills to capacity. Bring your own plastic/metal boxes to your favorite take-out joint. You'll save resources and save them money. Use reusable shopping bags whenever you go to the store. Say "No Thanks" when the pharmacist or fast food clerk tries to put your one or two items in a bag. Use reusable cups for coffee and other beverages including for soda and fountain drinks. And, reuse some of the extras at home - keep extra napkins and reuse plastic cups and cutlery.|`|5ZRekhIUaa	living green is a trend, your doing it because everyone else is doing it|`|wvDh3PdFaa	i tell my friends  that my secret  of maintaining a skin like mine  is eating more green leafy vegetables  . despite my age 50 years old   i dont have lots of wrinkles  thanks  , with  a lot  friuts  and vegetables.  and  so  can save money as well by planting green  vegrtables. campaigning  the  importance  of  planting vegetables create awareness so that our  environment  will be  greener  forever.|`|R2cQ7aRyaa	all you have to do is conserve energy. make sure you are recycling. make sure you are throwing away the items you use.|`|PWamfb8paa	turn light off, turn the faucet off when ur not using it, un plug things because thing that r plug-ed still use electricity, plant trees, carpool, walk, bike, stop playing electronics, stop watching movies (instead read a book, it's like a movie but in ur imagination.|`|eI0IUHQ2aa	If you only eat vegetables you fart more which puts more methane in the atmosphere|`|3Kv3vlebaa	well i am trying to be really green too.

You might be to young to watch the videos about slaughterhouses and what goes on behind the scenes. It's better to be a vegetarian because you reduce risk of getting heart diease and you live a healthier lifestyle. Also, half of americas water is used to 'raise' animals and 2/3 of the worlds greenhouse gases coem from them. also, because millions of animals are killed every year and the animals are fed steroids to make them grow fast and given antibiotics to make the meat bigger. So the animal is basically becoming crippled and sick from all these drugs. When the meat is prepared and sold to markets there is e.coli and other food illnesses hiding away in there so you have to be really careful when dealing with meat products. This is gross but, in every chicken package there is a little poop. I can give you a website that can explain a little better than I can of why it's better to be vegetarian.

We have had several record low temps this year across the nation. I urge everyone to fight back before we have to pay $$$.  This should have been stopped long ago. If you allow a tap/trade or tax on carbon, you and generations later, will pay forever because of a Huge Political scare caused by people who benefit finically, for the scare.
HB8uby7xaa	stop-motion videos are pretty fun. some people in my dorm did a recycling project where they took the trash from the dorm over the weekend, and sorted out all of the trash from the recycled goods, and built a sculpture with all of the recyclable materials. Building off that idea, what if you made a stop-motion video of all of the recyclable materials sorting themselves out of the trash can, and crawling over to a recycle bin, or doing something else humorous. Just use the video camera to take one frame at a time and move the cans/paper just a tiny bit every frame.  It would be funny, entertaining but it would make an impact when people see how much recyclable stuff gets thrown away (especially on the weekends when people dump all their beer)
nSMizwOqaa	read these papers about ethanol.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Corn ethanol is unlikely to continue to be developed as a fuel source due to its use as a major world food crop.    Other bio-mass can just as easily be used, such as Kudzu, as just one example.  Brazil has been doing this for years and run their vehicles on pure ethanol.|`|0KmJwYunaa	The amount of energy required to produce 1 gallon of corn ethanol equates to the energy in 0.8 gallons of gasoline.   Since corn ethanol only has 2/3 the energy of gasoline, you are actually effectively burning more than a gallon of gas to make a gallon of ethanol.    It would make far more sense to make ethanol from sugar beets like they do in France because it only takes the equivalent energy of 0.5 gallons of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol.   Ideally, sugar canes would be used as it takes the energy of 1/8 a gallon of gasoline to make a gallon of ethanol from sugar canes.    The whole corn ethanol bit is political.   The corn farmers have been subsidized to the point where they are paid to not grow corn hence creating additional markets for the corn will allow the government to cut back on funding them to not grow corn.    There is  an excess of corn production capacity in America so corn ethanol does not displace food production indeed the byproduct of fermentation is animal feed hence subsidizing corn ethanol effectively subsidizes the corn growers and the pig factory farmers.   Scientifically and environmentally, there's no point in ethanol from corn but there's plenty of reasons politically.|`|AA11289359	Ok if you take all of our corn that is shipped overseas and turn it into fuel or gas, did you know it would only make 0.3% of the gas we use in the United States.

z95FZsgAaa	Ok, have you not watched the news in the past few months?    People are already "not buying" and that's put all 3 in a financial crisis with GM and Chrysler speaking of Bankruptcy and such.  And they all want $$$ from the Govt to stay afloat.    OK, so they aren't refusing to buy, most CAN'T buy...but he end result is the same.  20-30% decline in sales...and the hurt is put on the Big 3 (and others, but they aren't saddled with the domestics other expenses)    So trying to incite a boycott to already insolvent companies isn't going to accomplish squat.          And to the person claiming there is an electric dragster faster than and NHRA Top Fuel car....please provide a link/source because that is BS!

Electric cars, or hybrids for that matter are not powerful cars, and are not built worth a crap. Plus the average hybrid does not have the expected working life of a better car at this time.    Diesel cars are a much better idea at this time.|`|WewCtMpzaa	I think many are scared of trying to mass produce an electric car. It seems that most are small time operations, and they produce a handful of concepts to try to sell to about a dozen people who are willing to pay the premium to own a lightweight, around a 100 mile round around distant to travel.    The logistics needs to be figured where a realistic fast charge could be done at a "filling station" at various locations. Right now, you have to do it at your house at 110 or 220. That means waiting six to eight hours to charge. If you went to a 480 primary service for electric, you could do fast charges yourself, but I think it would be more like 30 minutes, maybe even an hour, and not ten minutes. That kind of service would be on an interval meter, so you would be paying market prices for power like a manufacturing company would. It wouldn't be the same as a watt-hour meter that most homes have. It would be a low load factor as well, so the power company is not going to give you any discounts as you would be a low value customer.    I once saw where a guy built a generator trailer for his converted Porsche 944 with the nose of a Volkswagen with a diesel motor in it. He had it mated with a DC motor that gave him all the extra range for long trips. There are solutions for long hauls in an EV as well.    Most are stuck in their gas motor world. They are very comfortable with it. As for that comment that electric cars are gay, that's not a good answer. Many are golf cars on steroids, but some electric cars are really cool, and some are faster than any gas powered car on the drag strip. While a silly fellow in love with the sound of his motor, would only have that at a race as the electric car at full torque on take off would be nearly 100 feet down the lane while the gas powered car would be spinning it wheels. I have heard of one electric car now making the quarter mile at 3 seconds. That's really fast, and no gas powered car is going to catch that.    One of th companies just needs to take plunge and make a cool car that works, and mass produce it. It can't be a Geo Metro wannabe. It has to have some style, and be around $20k at first. It's going to have to be a major player who can finance as well, if they want many takers. These small time makers are just too far out for the average buyer who will finance half or nearly all their car. If it's going to be a person's main car, it has to have realistic options, than having a bay of batteries. It will have to have real solutions for long hauls, and other neat accessories to invest in.|`|0vQsoYIbaa	It's kind of funny that you are demanding that someone produce something that has not been developed.

I am going to force Mcdonalds to sell vegan only!  Electric cars are here now. For over a 100K you can get a Tesla. You refuse to buy a gas car fine,  you can just walk or just ride a bike for the next 20 years.  Do you know how good batteries are for the environment.  Do you know how heavy and inefficient batteries are? They suck. They weigh a ton for what they produce. You demand 70mph and 120 miles per charge. They should get right on it, since you demand it.   Your buddy, I mean president Obama is wanting each state to regulate the emmission standard. Great, 15 different car standards. If you buy a car in one state and bring it back to your new home state, it just might not pass the state emission test. You can pay thousands to get it right or just sell it. Another all time great idea.   Do you have any clue on the time and money it takes to build a new car from scratch? You want a new car with new technology. Get a clue.  It does not matter if you buy cars from the big (or little) 3 US car companies. They don't even have to make a profit to stay in business. Good use of TARP, I mean tax payer money.  I can't believe people are so clueless. No wonder Americans are considered to be stupid.|`|jssS7YULaa	Magicpie and Ap0stl3 don't really know what they are talking about. First off, the market for all electric cars isn't where it should be because there are a couple problems that one would be faced with. First off, the car needs to receive its energy from some kind of source, and it's counterproductive to plug a car to your house (disgusting electric bill I wouldn't like to receive) and where would you "refuel" if you're going cross country and you get stuck in the middle of nowhere? Also... duuuhhh, they would be stupidly expensive- hence- why bother? Today's hybrids are well made vehicles that makes it available in mass quantities to a broader group of people. It uses both gas and electric. When you are decelerating and breaking, the battery self charges, and when you accelerate, you get both the gas and battery power so it's not a little put put vehicle. You HAVE to drive them! If you didn't know better, you wouldn't be able to tell (particularly Honda)!     While the concept of hydrogen cars is genius, it really doesn't make much sense, nor do the cars that are flex-fuel (takes gas and E85 ethanol) because of the fact that the country does not have the stations to provide that kind of fuel! Hydrogen would be very expensive for the consumer because it takes a lot of time, money, and energy to create. No doubt though, it is better for the environment, but the cost for it will be astronomical. Same with E85. It's just corn, but the process to create it far surpasses the necessity for it. It's more expensive than diesel and most stations don't pump it, so you'll be relying on gas anyway. Stupid. The raising of corn for fuel is also stupid because that can really deplete the mineral deposit resources in the soil to be able to cultivate it seasonly.     In short, if you are more of a city driver, you are actually ok with a hybrid and you will be helping reduce greenhouse emissions. The government also gives you a great tax incentive (up to 3k back) when you purchase a hybrid. Also think about it this way: we've been having an environmental crisis for 40 years, and it's only been til now that the public has globalized "green." No one's been in a rush. We buy what they put out, and shrug and hope the next person will have better decency to purchase a greener vehicle because there are no "reasonably priced" options for us.|`|0KmJwYunaa	The energy density of lithium ion batteries is 250 WH/l by volume, 350 WH/kg by mass whereas the energy density of gasoline is 9,000 WH/l by volume and 13,500 WH/kg by mass.   Electric vehicles require that we more narrowly define our transportation requirements by two orders or magnitude in order to be practical.    Hydrogen compressed to 150 bar (147 atmospheres) has an energy density of 405 WH/l by volume and 39,000 WH/kg.   hence not only would the pressure tank be heavy to withstand the pressure but would be enormous.   Also pressure tanks are notoriously dangerous.   Liquid hydrogen has a more respectable energy density of 2,600 WH/l but still pales in comparison to gasoline expecially considering the cryogenics required.   Ironically, there is more hydrogen in a gallon of gasoline then there is in a gallon of liquid hydrogen.       Essentially, hydrogen vehicles is shear stupidity especially since C5 through C11 hydrocarbons (synthetic gasoline) can be readily synthesized from biomass gasification and even from CO2 and H2O directly.    The Fischer Tropsch synthesis of gasoline and or diesel from syngas (H2 and CO) has been well known since 1923 and has been and is being done in commercial quantities.   The syngas can be from a number of sources, gasification of coal, of stranded natural gas (which is being flared off anyways), or biomass (garbage) and from solar power as demonstrated by Sandia Labs.    The manufacture of a new vehicle has a huge carbon footprint in the materials, and energy of manufacture plus the transportation of said materials and final product.   Expecting everyone to switch over to something different will accelerate the release of carbon into the atmosphere whereas leveraging existing vehicle technology and just switching to carbon negative synthetic fuels (biomass gasification sequesters carbon in the ash) will not accelerate the release of carbon due to vehicle manufacturing.    The cost of synthetic fuels can be quite low, especially with newer more simplified synthesis processes like the acetylene oligomerization process, the demonstration plant has been running since 2005 and produces gasoline at $25 a barrel which is about $0.63 a gallon (Fischer Tropsch would be about $35 a barrel or $0.88 a gallon).   Yes the synthetic fuel approach has a large capital investment upfront but in the long run should be less expensive than fossil fuels.|`|0CkFC43raa	it will be about as effective as everybody not buying gas on wednesday, or tuesday or whenever. technology moves forward at a consistent pace, and while you can speed it up a bit, you cant force it to move at light speed. pure electric cars are going to show up in the showrooms one day, just not in the next few years.|`|1balnARjaa	The TESLA motor co. has an all electric car. $100,000.00 price. TESLA has just completed a $40Mil.contract with mercedes that will supply them with TESLA's drivetrain and battery technology for mecedes to build all electric cars. DO NOT look for the US car companies to use this kind of common sense. It is a travesty what is happening to our country. Take the initiative to solve your own problems and forget about our govt. I have successfully converted my 99 jeep to an all electric jeep. My range is 200miles. I live on OAHU so I can increase my range with lithium ion tech, but that is more expensive.

Patterns of climatic change when the continents were in different configurations and the earth's atmosphere contained 50% and less oxygen than today are irrelevant.    The modern system (Holocene) is 10-12,000 old. We have a better than-fair understanding of temperature trends over that period - as well as the major causal factors.     What we see over the period coincident with the Industrial Revolution (and after we account for the measurable [natural] causes we are aware of) is an unparalleled increasing trend in temperature since the last major ice age.|`|0IjomiJ2aa	this is why we need to be alarmed because the planet will fry tomorrow|`|53VgQm9Caa	Nobody is ignoring it - quite the contrary.

Also major geological events, like the development of mountain ranges effect global temperature.    http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/earl...

pnCOR1UVaa	There is more to a hybrid than the gas mileage, it also reduces emissions, dramatically if you drive in the city or stop and go traffic. Hybrids DON'T plug into the wall, at least not yet. The hybrid is not the final solution, it is just step on the way.     Here is the basics on a hybrid, it operates just like a regular car. I only put gas into it. I have a gas engine and an electric motor. When I'm sitting still both shut off, so no emissions. When I accelerate both kick on so I have plenty of power. If I am going a constant slow speed say under 35 miles an hour my gas engine often shuts off, when I coast both shut off. The battery charges when I'm coasting or braking. My car has been the least expensive car I've ever owned, at 6.5 years I have never had a problem, I get the oil changed every 7500 miles, I live in CA and don't have to get a smog certificate and the tires are cheap too.     They are developing models that plug in, but they generally go to specific markets when that happens, mostly CA and a few other states that support clean energy. In CA we are at the front of the clean energy march. We have strict laws which are systematically decreasing the amount of coal energy that can be produced or used in CA. I already have a solar system on my house, so I know for sure I'll be using clean energy when I get my electric or plug in hybrid.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	You're right, at this point electric cars probably aren't much better than gas cars. A large majority of our electricity comes from dirty sources. What is important though is that as we move towards more sustainable fuels our vehicles will be prepared to take advantage of them.    As far as hybrids go, they don't use any outside electricity. They gain their efficiency by regenerating electric power through braking. Assuming you're braking occasionally the hybrid will indeed be better than a gas model. As such, they're very suited to city driving.|`|6074ba9150b4dd8433de8921a00a080eaa	The reason that electric and hybrid cars are supposedly environmentally friendly is because electricity you use to recharge your cars is partially from renewable energies.

rFlhIgJXaa	1. When trees from a rainforest are cut down they are normally really really old and the soil beneath them has a thin layer of "good" soil with a bunch of essentially sand beneath it, when you farm this land it is not very long that it is good for because the trees that held the soil there previously are no longer there which makes the soil wash away which leads to essentially crappy land that is not very good for farming, except maybe grass which can be used for cattle but still...<br>  <br>  2. When rain forest is destroyed a lot of biodiversity is lost. Biodiversity is ... basically variety of organisms (plants, birds, animals, insects). Some of these plants and whatnot could hold potential medicinal values, maybe a cure for cancer we do not know. Once things are extinct they are lost forever (or maybe not if we are somehow able to clone them) and with them any potential medical benefits.<br>  <br>  3. The current worry about Climate Change being influenced by Carbon Dioxide (which in my opinion is bunk, but you asked about people not me) is another reason that people are concerned. Trees turn carbon dioxide into oxygen (and carbohydrate for themselves to "eat" which subsequently puts some carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, but less than they put in) and by cutting down trees we not only lose out on oxygen we basically lower the potential for carbon dioxide to be removed from the atmosphere.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	U are wasting your time .

A great many undiscovered species live in the Amazon, which means that the loss of rainforest habitat has the potential to eliminate species without humans ever seeing them, let alone studying them. Of course it is impossible to prove that undiscovered species have been driven extinct, so we should take that argument with a grain of salt.<br>  <br>  One serious problem with rainforest destruction has to do with the uses to which the altered habitat is put. People try to grow crops and graze cattle on land that was once rainforest. Unfortunately, rainforest soils are notoriously poor and devoid of nutrients. This means that after just one or two growing seasons, the soil cannot support crops and more forest land must be cleared. The abandoned land is left to "return to the forest," but the structure of old-growth rainforest is extremely complex so the land takes decades to return to its former abundance.|`|0178LGMraa	1 Global warming<br>  # 2 Global warming<br>  # 3 Global warming<br>  <br>  Deforestation is the second largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions today.

Sow1mTFuaa	I am not familiar with mountain ranges outside of America, but here in the states you typically see a range of climates during the year. The Sierra Nevada range gets rather cold every winter, with a range of temperature from -5 at night to 55 or 60 in the day. Averagely in the winter I would say you will see a temperature around 20-35 during a clear day and an average year weather wise in the Sierras. The snow in the Sierras is typically very wet and heavy, which makes great base for skiing or boarding if that's what you are interested. The Rockies on the otherhand, while the temperatures are typically just a little cooler than the Sierras, the snow is a lot dryer. It's fluffy type snow that you can just scoot through while walking.

kskCdIFVaa	Energy  With all the talk of solar panels, fuel cells, building-integrated wind turbines, and flux capacitors, it can be easy to think you need a million bucks to go green at home. Not so. Many of the most effective ways to cut carbon emissions are also the cheapest. Turn lights off when you go out, install energy efficient bulbs and appliances, insulate your home, and keep an eye on consumption.
