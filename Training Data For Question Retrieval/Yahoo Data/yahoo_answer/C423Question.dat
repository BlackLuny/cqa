20090227075029AAOLmVN	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Can I leave an open wound on a jade plant near the roots?	I have a jade plant with a shoot that connects near the roots.  As it is, the shoot seems to be interfering with the rest of the plant, but if I was going to cut it off and root it, that shoot would look great.      But if I cut it off, I would be leaving a wound on the larger plant under the ground.  Would this wound still being open and wet cause the roots to rot?  Should I let the wound dry and callous before putting it back in the ground?  Should I put it back in the ground but not water it for a while?      What do you recommend?
20090305102536AAhsJkS	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Crape Myrtle question?	I would like to trim my Crape Myrtle.   Does it matter for the health of the plant if I trim it more in height or in width or should I do both?  Which do you think is more aesthetically pleasing?  If I trim in height, will it bloom on the new growth?  Does it matter what time of the year it gets trimmed?  I'm in Zone 7b.  Thank you :)

I went to a Dollar Tree today and they had nice ceramic plates, bowls,and cups for $1 each and they looked almost identical to some that I was gonna buy at target for $50 next month and I could get a set of 4 for about $12 at dollar tree. I'm wondering if they will be of similar quality or if it even matters since it's just plates? My friend thinks it ghetto to buy them at dollar tree, but that's a big difference in price.
