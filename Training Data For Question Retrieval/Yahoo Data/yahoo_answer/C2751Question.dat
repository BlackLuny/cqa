20070607214249AABtR8Z	Pets;Dogs	Does my Dog Play Too Rough?	My dog is just breaking out of his shell, but I am worried that he is playing too rough. He isn't big, about 16lbs, and he generally only plays with dogs his size...but he runs and tackles them, jumps a bit on them...what is normal dog play vs. too rough where other owners will get mad?      And, if he is playing too rough...how do I get him to stop without banning him from playing altogether?

20070807074710AALBmDn	Pets;Dogs	Runaway Dog- Obediance Help?	Labrador/GSD, 11 months.. Every oppertunity he gets, he runs away. In my backyard he has managed to jump my fence, he can open up the gate.. We have a chain for him for when he goes out but sometimes the door gets left open. It's getting really stressful; if we call him it used to work but now he just stares at us, waits for us to walk towards him and then he bolts again. He has managed to slip out of his collar on many many walks, and I had it pretty tight.. Chasing him doesn't quite work either, obviously. I've tried many techniques; the praise when he does good, the 'alpha dog', the punishment when he does bad.. Nothing works, and if it does, by the next week we have to start all over again even with every day practice. Any advice?

I walked in my room to see it on the bottom of the tank, lying on its back with its mouth open. When I tapped the tank, it moved its legs a little. He seems a little responsive but... not very. Is he trying to sleep or is he on his way out? Thanks.

We checked the spot and the hair fell out easily, so we thought it was her winter coat.  We started to run our fingers through her hair and more came out so we pulled a little and we ended up with a huge handfull just from little pulling.  My dog didn't even notice yet now there is a bald spot and it has little red dots that look like pimples.  She doesn't seem irritated by it, but I don't know what to do...  Help???

20070803062048AAMhzGv	Pets;Dogs	Training an old dog to stay in a new section of yard?	Our old neighbors moved last year, the previous owners had a golden retrever that played with our golden lab freely.  Our dog was never trained to stay in our yard to that side because the dogs just played.  Now we have new neighbors and we are trying to keep her in our yard she is fine as long as we are standing outside with her (she wants to be with us) however as soon as she goes outside she heads right over there.  (I personally think she wants to go play with the dog that no longer lives there).  She does return when we call her, but she looks like we are torturing her.  Telling her to "stay close" will keep her nearby but she still wants to go over there.  So should I walk her there and tell her no or just keep calling her back?      Please realize that we live in a private area and nobody leashes their dogs.  If we are going to have her outside alone she is either leashed on the porch or put into her kennal.  FYI she is 6-years-old and was "rescued/adopted" at 14 months.

20090225152530AAe8UFB	Pets;Dogs	Why didn't the dog want to come in its own home?	When I got home, I spotted a dog on the sidewalk with a black collar, so I thought it should live around my neighborhood, and it was definitely not a stray. My brother said that its name is something like Roni and that it lived down the street in one of the houses. We tried to lure it to us and get a better look at its collar for a nametag. The dog took a loong time to get to us, but eventually it came really close, but the collar had a missing nametag. so we thought we could feed it some RiceKrispies and water. The dog licked us and it ate the RiceKrispies, but it was kinda scared.       Whenever we opened the door, he wanted to come in. We guessed he was pretty cold, so we went door to door to ask if they had a missing dog. The dog followed us, and it also wanted to come inside the houses, but it never went inside one. A neighbor said that the dog probably lived in a white house, so we went to the door and rang the doorbell. A man came to the door with crutches and the dog didn't want to go in, but finally it ran in. He said the dog's name was Tony. And then we left.       (No real answer, just suggestions)   Why didn't the dog want to come inside its own home?   Am I thinking too much? But, how did it get loose in the first place? Why wasn't he looking for the dog, himself? Even in crutches!

When I brought him home, I put a little food in his bowl (probably about half a cup) and he started chowing down immediately and has been eating on and off all day. However, I have no idea how much kittens this old are supposed to eat and I don't want him to get fat. How much food, preferably in cups, should I feed him each day, and how many times per day?      I know they say that most kittens will meow when they're hungry, but so far I've noticed this one will "meow" but no noise comes out, so I want to make sure he will have food when he needs it.      Also, does anyone know how old kittens typically have to be before they can be de-clawed?      Thanks,   Kaitlyn and Joey

20090128145605AANpKSe	Pets;Rodents	Is this normal guinea pig behavior?	I got 2 baby guinea pigs 34 days ago and they are really sweet. They are my 6th and 7th piggies so I have learned the difference Between there squeaks. Whenever I get home from school they starting squeaking for food. Trust me I know this is a food squeak. Are they supposed to eat all the time? I feed them every time they do and they gobble it up. They have pellets and timothy hay in their cage and they go outside to eat grass 2 times a day. Also they make this purrring sound that I used to think was a sign of Happiness. My piggie that died in May did this when we would pet her and she loved being petted. My baby does it to the other piggie just to get her out of the igloo. They will be 5 months old in 7 days. So I guess my 2 questions are:   Do guinea pigs eat all the time?   What does their purring sound mean?      Please no rude comments.

20081111151508AApHFBd	Pets;Dogs	Can I tell how large my puppy will be when full grown?	I've adopted a dog from the Humane Society. They told me he was a labrador/jack russell mix, though several friends (Jack Russell owners) have told me he doesn't look/act like a J.R. Anyway, I'm wondering if there is any way to guestimate how large he'll be when grown? I got him when he was about 3 months old and he weighed 9 pounds. He's now 5 months old and weighs 29 pounds. He's growing really fast! I feed him Purina One Large Breed puppy food and he eats about 3-4 cups a day. He's not overweight at all.

20081007163453AAAkiu7	Pets;Dogs	How can you tell if your dog has a broken leg as opposed to sprained?	  On Saturday my deadbeat roommates put my dog outside to be chased around the neighborhood by the kids (very mean, Im looking for a new place to live) I have a 8lb Min pin chihuhua mix and he doesn't bear weight on his back hind leg when on concrete. He walks on it fine when we're inside on carpet. I've rotated it and wiggled each of his toes and he was not bothered by any of that. He doesn't lick it or show any sort of pain other than just lifiting his little leg.  He does have a little cut on the inside of his little paw so I'm wondering if that's all it is.  I'm sure its sprained so what can I do to make him more comfortable?

We've kept her from scratching it by putting one of those cone things on her head.  We were hoping it would heal, but it's just bleeding more. My dad doesn't want to take her to the vet because he thinks they will put her down, even though she's still a happy dog full of life and energy. My mom thinks we should take her to the vet because they can't force us to put her down. What should we do? Do you think the vet can help? Last time we brought her when her hips were bad, they gave her medicine and she got all better. So is there still a chance?

20090128143853AABQnoh	Pets;Cats	Anyone have any suggestion on how to keep playful kittens off counter tops?	We have 2 HUGE Maine Coon kittens (our boy is already 10 lbs at 5 months) and when they play it can almost be lethal because of their size!  Our boy LOVES to jump up on the bathroom sink and play with my bobby pins and hair ties in the morning (as well as chill in the sink, so we have to be sure to dry it out after brushing our teeth, etc or he gets wet!). We let him do this for about 4 weeks because he is so cute, but I realize now this will become a problem, as he is relentless when I pick him up and put him on the floor.  He will just come barreling back into the bathroom and with one giant leap, up he goes!  He also chews on our toothbrushes and I do not want him to do this and get sick if the toothbrush has traces of toothpaste left on it. We can't close the bathroom door because we live in a 1 bedroom apartment and the bathroom is where their litter box it. And the only place it can really go for that matter. Plus anyone who owns cats knows if you close a door all they do is body slam into it until you let them in or they break it down. So, that said, any suggestions as to how to keep them off the counter tops?  They love tape and water, so double sided sticky tape on the counter will not work, nor will squirting them with a spray bottle.  Any ideas would be appreciated!

20090128160906AAP5mT8	Pets;Dogs	How do I stop separation anxiety in my new puppy?	I just rescued a puppy two weeks ago. He is a boxer, blue tick heeler mix I believe. He is definitely a boxer, but the vet thinks he has some kind of bird dog in him.    Anyway, He is completely attached to me. I can't leave the room, go outside, come back inside or leave the house without bringing him with me. He HATES being outside by himself (and that kind of sucks because I am still house breaking him and I have to be outside with him EVERY time for as long as it takes for him to go). If I close him in my room, he'll scratch underneath the door like he's trying to dig his way out. If I leave him outside, he'll sit outside the door and howl this pitiful howl. He follows me everywhere and hates it when I leave. He is not very old, maybe 10-11 weeks, so I am trying to help him with this early before he becomes "set in his ways". He is not crate trained yet, however I am working on that with him. Like I said, I've only had him for two weeks. If anyone can help with this, any advice will be helpful.

20090128153910AA9cLFw	Pets;Horses	Any Interesting Or Uncommon Facts?	Hey...I looooovvveee to learn new things about horses. Especially interesting little facts that not a lot of people know. So do you have any interesting facts that you would like to share?      Mine:    **Did you know that prehistoric horses had THREE toes? and were the size of medium sized dogs? lol. **cool zoology project informed me of this**      Not uncommon, but could educate someone:    **Normal body temperature is 99 - 101 F. A healthy horse's temperature can vary by 3 degrees depending on environmental factors.   **The pulse rate of an adult horse at rest averages 30-40 beats per minute (bpm). The average pulse rates for young horses are as follows:    Foals (70-120 bpm), Yearlings (45-60 bpm), 2yr. olds (40-50 bpm).   **The average respiration rate of an adult horse at rest is 8-15 breaths per minute.    **Adult female horses (mares) usually have 36 teeth. A mare may have up to 40 teeth if she happens to have any canine teeth, which is possible but less common. Adult males have between 40 and 44 teeth. (These don't include wolf teeth)   **A horse's upper jaw is wider than its lower jaw.    **The average horse's heart weighs approximately 9 or 10 pounds. The great American racehorse Secretariat had a heart estimated during his autopsy to weigh 21 pounds.   **Horses produce approximately 10 gallons of saliva a day.   **The tallest horse on record was a Shire. He was 21.2 hands (7 feet, 2 inches) tall.    **The oldest horse on record is "Old Billy," an English barge horse. He was 62 years old when he died, living from 1760 to 1822.    **The record for the longest jump over water is held by a horse named Something who jumped 27 feet, 6 and 3/4 inches on April 25, 1975 in Johannesburg, South Africa.   **Horses cannot breathe through their mouths.    **A horse's splint bones are thought to be remnants of toes from prehistoric horses.       I really like learning about equine health. =D So....what's your facts?

I looked every inch of the yard, (he never jumps the fence it's huge and he's older and chubby). So I went and sat on the steps kinda panicked, that this has never happened. I must have looked for a long time too, our yard isn't very big either.Then, all of the sudden he comes around the corner off the patio. I couldn't believe it I was so relieved.I had check all over there too. Where the heck was he? Do you think cats can go to other places or dimensions? I know that sounds far fetched but, I'm very puzzled and it's all I can think of. I think sometimes they can see things we can't,...what do you think?

She could use a little tiny bit of slimming down but other than that she has some strong legs as far as I know. Do they race Arabians? How good are they in Barrel Racing?    P.S.She is 5-6 y/o so I don't know if that makes a difference.

20090128203348AAjeAo1	Pets;Birds	Why is my Budgie puffed up most of the time?	I got a budgie Saturday, and ever  since then it has been puffed up most of the time. The only exceptions are when its flying or perching on someones finger. I know that it's not cold, because I have the heater on continuously for it. I heard somewhere that means they're content, but somewhere else said that it is settling in. But I heard somewhere else that means  its sick. What is the most reasonable conclusion for this?     She sits on a perch in her cage when shes puffed.  When she's eating or drinking she isn't puffed up, and when she is flying she isn't puffed up.     I let her out to fly around my room, but most of the time when she perches somewhere she puffs up too. Is this normal?

Hi i have a canary where he's starting to sneeze a lot in the night aswel as rubbin his face on the perch but the thing is i don't have enough money to go to the vets, because i am currently out of work with bills going through the roof.      It not as bad in the day time but the nite time its alot worse, he makes these strange noises and sneezes. He was fine the other day but later on yesterday is where it occured.      Ive been told he could just have either   respiratory infection   Cold   Air Sac Mites      Ive heard of lvermectin which you can buy from ebay and probably get it in the next 3 days or so. But i have read it can be become toxic and kill your bird if the incorrect dose is applied. not good      Or theres scatt which i heard is good and less dangerious than lvermectin from australia and can get it between 5 - 10 days which is a safer option but will my canary last another 5-7days?      Ive also phoned a few local pet shops who sell mite treatments for small birds which i could go and tomorrow, but will any of this work or improve my sick baby      Any advice much apreciated

20090225154829AALFw8L	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat want to pee in one spot outside of the litter box?	My kitten was peeing on my couch downstairs. I did not catch it until months after. I found it one day and figured that he was spraying before he got fixed. While I had it professionally cleaned and than I put blankets over it (like about 5 quilts, lol) and sprayed them with some SHOUT, which is a cheap deterrent from Walmart for cats and dogs.       Since than he has not peed there and I have been happy, until tonight where I found a new spot that he was peeing in another room behind an old couch in the storage room.       Why did he transfer spots?      I put a small blanket over the new area and sprayed it with SHOUT and I changed cat litter to a finer litter (cats seem to like the finer stuff I hear) and to a clumping one so that the litter box will clean easier and thus be less prone to stinkiness. What else can I do to break him of this? And why does he do this?

20090225154459AA2Rt1l	Pets;Fish	Please help us with our fish tank?!?	In our 50 gallon freshwater fish tank we currently have two Oscars (Astronotus ocellatus) that are about 5 or 6 inches long, and we had two Plecostomus fish that were about 4.5 inches long. For about two weeks now we've been noticing the Oscars laying down on their sides at the bottom of the tank, and not eating any food at all. Unlike the Oscars, the Pleco's still ate, but weren't as active as they should have been.       On Sunday, I noticed white crystal-like spots all over the Oscars and the Pleco's bodies, and little white cottony growths around the mouths of the Oscars. On Monday, we removed the carbon filters and treated the 50 gallon tank with 5 tablets of Tank Buddies Fungus Clear (we pre-disolved the tablets in water before putting them in the tank because the tank volume is over 40 gallons.) On Tuesday, we found both Pleco's dead (one floating at the top of the tank, and the other under the rock), and the Oscars still laying down on their sides. We immediately put the carbon filters back in, and did a 20% water change. Now it's Wednesday, and the Oscars are a bit more active (still not eating however), but they still have the white cottony growths on them.      We are thinking about putting 3 tablets of Tank Buddies Fungus Clear in the tank today to try and provide the Oscars some relief (we don't want to use a full dose because of the effect it had the first time.) However we have some questions first.   1. Are we taking the right actions in treating the fish?   2. Could the Tank Buddies Fungus Clear have killed both Pleco's in the tank, or did they die on their own?   3. Could the Pleco's have made the Oscars sucebtible to infection by sucking off their protective coating - or can that only happen with goldfish & Pleco's?   4. If the answer to number 3 is yes, then what other algae eaters can we place in the tank that would be compatible with the two Oscars?      Any & all INFORMED answers are welcome, and greatly appreciated. Thanks so much for helping.
