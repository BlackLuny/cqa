20090226135804AAMoGjP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Kinda long but i need your help.. does he like me?	Ok so im in 11th grade and this guy that i kinda like is in 9th.  Weve known eachother for 2 years (he went out with my bestfriend) but ive also been together with him a little since then about a year ago.  He's the kind of guy whos like a concieted jerk but can also be reallly sweet when he wants.  Whenever we hangout with our group of friends, hes all over me, flirts with me alot etc ( especiallly last week).  Our friends all think that he likes me but i dont know because this week in school hes been ignoring me and when i talked to him in the halls he was a complete jerk to me and so now were kinda in a fight i guess?  So what do you think... do you think he likes me? Its so hard to tell cause hes one of those reallly confusing guys and i never know what he exactly wants from me? Please help...

20090226142625AAoliqr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help!asap plz???????????????????	Well since a while now.   he's always eyed me up and down.   he's always staring at me.   if he gets a chance he'll walk past me and say things like   what up sexy?   or stuff like that.   Yesterday he texted me & told me he wanted a kiss.   he told me that he thought I was sexy && he thought we should go out.   I kissed him today.   It happened kinda quick.   It was just a peck though.   I kinda feel like he could be a player.   He's never cheated[as far as I know.]   But looking back at my past.   I have no reason to trust guys anymore.   Should I give him a chance?   Or should I tell him to leave me alone?   I like him alot and he says he does too.   && we kissed.   But nothing seems to mean anything anymore.   What d you think?

So, I'm going to a "club" for the first time, (it's for kids, I'm in 12th grade), and I'm going with my girlfriend of 4 months. Thing is, I don't know how to act at all for these things, (I even had a tea party outside of prom and homecoming with my friends). She, on the other hand, does. I don't want to embarrass myself, and I don't know how to dance or anything. What should I do?
20090226144857AAc1wzJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he using me... PLEASE READ, 10 pts to best?	I have been 'seeing' this guy for about a month. We're 19, and I'm in second year of uni - he's in his first because he took a year off to volunteer. He doesn't have a job because, as I just mentioned, it's his first year in school, plus he's the president of this club he started here so he's pretty busy with that. My point of all this is - he doesn't have a job right now (he's starting to apply for some though), meaning he doesn't have a lot of money. Therefore, most of the time when we 'hang out', we hang out in my room and 'do' stuff.      To be fair, we have gone 'out' to a couple things... he invited me to come out to the bar for his friend's b-day (I couldn't though), we went to some gathering at another pub one night with some mutual friends, he took me out for pizza at his fave place (very casual), been to Starbucks a few times, etc. But never out to a sit down dinner or to a movie or anything like that.      Now, I have been okay with this... I'm going on exchange next year and we both know this isn't going to be a long term/serious thing. But today my friend asked if I thought it was weird that we normally only hang out in my room and fool around. So it got me to thinking... do you think it sounds like he's using me? Or do you think it's just because our 'relationship' is super casual, plus his whole not having money deal?      Thanks in advance.
20090226144929AASqYFu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like a girl. why do i feel guilty?	i like a girl that is a strip club waitress(fully clothed). we have been friends for 2 months. i heard she likes me too. when i go to the club i turn down dances out of respect for her. she is a sweetheart. she doesnt accept half of the tips i give her. tonight i went there and she was off. my friend from high school who is a stripper was there. i took her to the vip room. in there she basically did everything but have sex with me. i tried not to touch her but she is very aggressive. she also kept putting her hands and mouth on my cock. so now i have a hicky and teeth marks in various places. she is crazy. anyways the waitress i like will be back in town tomorrow and i will see her. im not dating her so why do i feel guilty? also the stripper friend invited me to her party should i go? she said she promises i will get laid but i really just want to see the waitress.

20090226145446AAhqYRu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do men 50s and older think about sex often?	Would men in their upper 50s and older still be into sex (think about sex often, masturbate, visualize having sex, etc.)?      Let me explain - this guy and I have known each other for about four or five years; he'll turn 60 next month and I'm 25. We get along great and are good friends and he's been flirting with me a lot (I won't lie, I've been flirting, too, although I know the age difference is too much; but I am attracted to him).      He sits very close to me, smiles and laughs a lot with me, looks into my eyes all the time when we talk, sometimes comes close to touching me but doesn't (like once we were sitting next to each other and our knees came very close to touching); not sure if he wants to see how close he can come to me without touching. The last time we saw each other (after two hours of heavy flirting), he told me the next time I'm in town (I live several states away and won't be home til the summer) we can just meet at his house. Is he thinking what I think he's thinking or is it just being friendly? And all this after three months of not seeing each other. When I'm home over the summer it's gonna be at least six months!!      He, to me, is a very kind man who respects me. Of course he's the only one that actually knows this but do you think he sometimes sees me and thinks about sex?

We have some common interests, so it shouldn't be hard, but it is for some reason. Maybe because small talk isn't really something I'm good at. How can I get a conversation going??? What should I do? It always starts with one of us asking a question and saying something, the other one responding, and then it just kind of stops for some reason.
20090226144121AAZEU4a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just a friendly question or more?	I have this friend that I like. A couple years ago she said she liked me back , but saw me as someone she would settle down with, and wasnt ready to settle down yet. A couple days b4 Valentines Day, she asked me to take her to the dentist cuz she didnt have a ride. Were not best friends or anything, we talk here and there, and recently we went out twice, both times before this day. We ended up spending the day together. At one time, we were at my job, and as we were leaving, she asked "are you off Valentines day?" And me being the shy screwup that I am didnt think to ask her. Was she hinting to ask her out, or is everyone saying its a sign just getting my hopes up?

I Don't Mean by touching him or  kissing him.  But have you ever noticed a guy staring at you or perhaps drooling over you and then you decide to just entice him even more by allowing him to stare?  Or have you  leaned over in front of him or bent over and maybe stood very close just to turn him on and amuse yourself?   I would love to hear what you did and what happened as a result of you teasing him.   Thanks.

I found her myspace and we talked on there for 2-3days and I finnaly got her Aim Account, we been talking on Aim for 2 weeks and I really never know what to say to her in class so I dont.

And I find I always have to start the convos on aim, is she shy or what? Im confused         The few things iv said to her in person I felt PERFECT..

20090226145413AA01xq2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS ONLY PLEASE     Is he cheating?	My bf has been texting a single girl lately. I read some of them and they don't seem to be bad but his sound suggestive. She is way cute and much younger, I know he is flirting with her. Should I be worried he will go further? We have a child together, and have been together for about 6 or 7 years. He has been distant and somewhat depressed in the past, but says its work. I also noticed his texts for one day were not on his phone, and I know I texted him that day. He does not know I saw the texts, and by the way she is someone he should not have contact with outside of the professional business way. These texts were not bad, but not professional in any way. More like on a friendly basis, but suggestive. Should I say something or just keep my mouth shut and watch to see what happens?

20090226144130AAmuMIR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Like This Girl, and I Have No Idea What To Do?	I like this girl, her name is Abbie. She is very pretty (maybe beautiful), she has blonde hair, she is really smart (no she does not wear glasses-big stereotype people use is not ok), i hear she is really really nice, and she is really shy. How shy you may ask, so shy most of the time I cannot remember what her voice sounds like. So what is the problem you may ask? I am really shy when considering talking to a girl I like. So shy that most of the time when I get advice on how to talk to a girl I never act on it... ever. I just wanna ask her out or at least get to know her, but I have a major fear of rejection from women I like. If I do ask or try to get to know her, what if she already has a boyfriend? what if she doesn't want one? What if I wait until high school, and by then it is too late? Oh no... am I going crazy. I must be the shyest person in the world. Even when I go talk to the guidance counselor (school) about all the things that go wrong, it appears he does not wish to hear it (and I thought guidance counselors were supposed to listen... that is their FREAKING JOB)! I believe she is in Band Class at seventh period. Before we had vacation I wanted to send her a lollipop (they were selling and delvering them in a diferent room, so no one would know who sent them), but I had no money (I used one dollar to get a lollipop sent to a girl I used to like, big mistake, good thing she does not know because I put annonymous). Did I get a lollipop from anyone. NO! I did not get anything, that day I was depressed because of it. But anyway... back on topic. She was not there the next week, because they postponed delivering the lollipops until week. She was not in school. Why? Well as soon as vacation was over around Tuesday, I heard her say to the teacher that she was in Florida. How come I have not been to Florida, my mom was once in Florida, but I have never been there. I never really talk much in school because I hate mostly everyone there, because they are jerks (except for Abbie and a couple of my friends). I do not think she knows I like her. Although my sister told one of her friends in my grade that I like her, and she must have told a lot of people. But maybe no one told Abbie because she does not approach me about it, although she might not even care. Or she may care and might be too shy to approach me. If I make a move, people will probably make fun of me (although the fact that they are all in 8th grade and have relationships makes them a hypocrite. What if I get rejected? If I wait too long, like until High School, what if she finds someone else, while I am left in the dust. This is one of the biggest problems in my life right now (that and constantly being picked on). Everytime I see movies with romance I get jealous and I hate and bash it. Everytime people mention relationships I constantly ask them to stop mentioning it, it gets me mad this conversation. I have been rejected by women before (though not directly). I try and pull myself away, but I just can not break free from this cycle of rejection. But something is different, this girl is one that has all the aspects I want in a girl (except I do not know much about her but you remember what I mentioned starting this question). I just want one pretty girl I like to like me back. I mean it happens all these other other... people. A lot of times these people are the wrong people. Now I wanna destroy something. Sometimes I think if she ever falls in love someday in High School, that I should find someway of breaking them up (if it is potentially not me she loves). Am I a bad person to want this? To want a girl I like to like me. I just want this, I have asked God for this many times, but there is something wrong, Is there something wrong with me?      ~Inuboy Kendo~
20090226143321AAHzbMI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think? does he like me or not?	okay, so, there is this boy....   and i really like him and people say that he likes me but he doesn't act like it!!!   he is always taking my pencils and stuff and pushing me and he laughs at me when i 4get 2 do me homework cuz he is in every 1 of my classes. but then he texts me all the time and my friend said that he told her that he likes me and he helps me w/ my math hw when i remember that we have it and he helps me hide my fone from the teacher when i am txtng during school (we get our fones taken away and our parents have 2 come pick them up 4 us) when other people tell on me.    oh btw we r in 6th grade       do u think he likes me???      thx 2 n e 1 that answers the question!!!

My husband and I are wanting to get pregnant and so are our best friends (who are married to each other). So we have been swapping info and what not. The other day she called just to tell me that on average women need to be at least 120-130lbs in order to get pregnant. I'm a very petite women at only 105lbs and 5'3. This hurt my feelings because I don't think it was necessary that I know that. Women of all sizes get pregnant everyday. Am I being too sensitive or was she trying to help?
20090226144122AAvQoWQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP!! I LOST CONTROLL OF MY TEMPER AND HIT MY GIRLFRIEND!!?	This happened about a week ago.  I hit her really hard, square in the nose.  She was bleeding (I am pretty sure I broke her nose).  Right after I did it, i knew i was wrong.  I must have apologized for losing my temper about 10000 times, but she still ran out the door crying!  It has been about a week since I have seen her.  I hope she is alright, and even more importantly I hope she did not go to the authorities.  I dont wanna got to jail for something i did on the sput of the moment! I talked to my mom and my mom got scared, She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'.  I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror.  If anything I can say this cab is rare, but I thought 'Now forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air!'  I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later!'  I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.      What Should I do????
20090226145044AAYxs2i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why won't he ask me out? not interested?	This guy remembers even the smallest detail of anything i've ever told him, and often waits for me about half an hour so that we can go home together in the bus...  but even if i give him all the hints (flirt, talk about movies i want to see, etc)  he doesn't ask me on a date...  is he not interested? is he intimidated because i'm 25 and he's 21?   oh well, i guess i'll get him out of my mind and see him as only a friend
20090226144815AAqHIf9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? Is he just using me?	I have known him for fifteen months and have been best friends with him since we met. I love him more than anyone, romantic feelings aside. We talk all the time about everything and are each others go to person. He feels the same way about me and loves me and needs me in his life. About five months into our relationship we started getting with each other (making out, fooling around) but neither of us expressed signs of wanting more in our relationship besides friends with benifits because we were nervous of ruining our relationship (silly I know). I am 16 and he is 18 and when he went to university in September (he still lives really close to me) he met this girl and they started going out almost immediately. He still loves me and im his best friend and we have always had a "thing" for eachother (we talk about it) we flirt all the time and even though we label ourselves as just friends it is definately more than that. We did not do anything while they were going out but we still flirted. They broke up in november and him and I started hooking up again. I told him that I wanted more and he told me he likes me that way, and that he loves me so much, more than anyone, and we get with eachother all the time, but he isn't sure because his ex wants to get back together and he still loves her too. So the last four months he has been driving himself insane trying to chose between us two. He spends time with her at school and hanging out in groups (during these months) while in the meantime he spends at least three days a week at my house, we talk 24/7 and we have also had sex three times. In anyone elses eyes we would seem as a couple but he still doesnt know what he wants because he still has feelings for his ex.      What should I do? should I wait for him to make a decision? I know that he does love me a lot, and he does like me as more than a friend and he is attracted to me obviously and he said I was the best sex he has ever had, and he wants to make things official but he still likes his ex... and isnt sure if he wants to get back together with her or go out with me...       what are your thoughts on this situation? and just advice in general      thanks!!!      oh also his ex doesnt know about him and I... at all. she thinks we're just good friends and nothing more
20090226143345AAmTA62	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it true that if you dont trust the realatonship wont work? HELP!!?	I have always heard that trust is the foundation of a relationship but does someone honestly can say i trust my partner 100% eyes closed even if he goes out and doesnt call or whatever the situation is. Im trying to explain to my boyfriend i cant just trust him one day to the other and that it takes time. We were dating and while dating he was seeing other people i saw text messages and he was never wanting to make our relationship official, then i found out he slept with someone and that is when i ended our relationship. I guess that is when he realized what he lost and came back and now he is a different person i can see he is commited and he even ask me to move in with him, but still i cant trust him. i even found out that during the time we dated he slept with the mother of his daughter, his excuse is that he was very confuse and that is the reason he never wanted to make me him girlfriend officially. And now that is our main argument he says to just trust him and he swears that he loves me and that he realized its only me he wants to be with and i do see the change he calls me for everything we live together he doesnt go anywhere without me! But yet in the back of my head i still cant trust i always feel like hes up to something Y is this ever going to go away! especially since the mother of his daughter will always be around, we have even  talked all three and he told her that he wants to be with me and that its over for them. How can i trust again i need help its ruining our realationship when he doesnt call when he say he is i get anger and crazy thoughts come to my head is this normal.....HELP!

We've been making eyes, smiling, the whole flirty thing. I even walk her to her class sometimes. Here's the thing. I've never really been all too nervous around girls before.

I couldn't think of anything to say, so I just put my arm round her and smiled. Why can't I talk to her? Why is she different? I wanna ask her out tomorrow, but i'm afraid i'll choke.

I have known this boy since the 4th grade,But never really talked to him often. I noticed him in Middle School and found that I was very intrigued by him.       By 8th grade we were separated by having different classes. In High School we were finally reunited again. The same crush developed again.  Unfortunately each and every time it seems like we both feel the same way about each other he gets a girlfriend.       It hurts me but somehow I still manage to still have the same feelings. I am giving him all the signs I can that I am interested in him, but he just doesn't get it.      Should I really keep flirting, Should I back Off, or should I just wait till my turn if I ever have one?      Please Help,   Thanks in advance [?]

20090226162403AAGkgQl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Has anyone heard the original author of the Joint Custody Laws passed away?	Father Makes Two   Time Magazine   By Margot Roosevelt - Sunday, Nov. 11, 2003    http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...       Quote:   "As late as 1971, the Minnesota State Bar Association's handbook advised lawyers and judges that "except in very rare cases, the father should not have custody of the minor children. He is usually unqualified psychologically and emotionally." When James Cook, a Los Angeles real estate lobbyist, divorced in 1974 and sought shared custody of his son, "the judge thought it was preposterous," he recalls. "He told me, 'I don't have permission to do it.'" Outraged, Cook and some friends organized the Joint Custody Association and in 1979 pushed through the California legislature the first law encouraging joint custody. All 50 states eventually followed suit....."       James Cook passed away last weekend.  Though his name was not known in the annuls of history, the result of his work affected millions now living.       At this point, no Memorial has been announced.
20090226161203AAbZ5Sf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do I feel so down, ugly, worthless after a failed relationship?	At age of 28, I thought I have found my soul mate, the love of my life. While dating him, I felt I was the most beautiful woman in the world because he made me feel that way.   But after the relationship ended, I felt so ugly, worthless, and so down. I am not saying I let a man define me as a person. But it is the kind of feeling I can hardly describe. It is almost like I was high up there one moment and all of sudden, I fell down hard with all your bones broken. I can't describe it. It is just hard and it really sucks.   It is like the final break up is the biggest "F*uck you." All promises become lies. I can hardly breath.   How can I regain my self esteem.    On my day off, all I want is to find somebody whom I can talk to about him, but I find out the only person whom I can really talk to is he himself. It is such a scary thought. because I know I can NEVER get him back no matter what. IT IS OVER, DONE.   What am I going to do?   The hardest thing for me is the self esteem, and the hopelessness.   What am I going to do right now?   Have you ever felt this way? How do you cope with it? thank you

20090226161545AAlztNq	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have this really annoying friend?	She's really close to me although I've only known her for about one year. She's constantly calling me and is so clingy. She's a great and funny friend, but sometimes she can irritate me to no end. She doesn't know when to stop and is always using me for homework questions, even for homework that I've spent hours on, trying to get hte correct answer, she tries to just copy it off of me and doesn't even try looking for the naswer. Also, during class, she always talks to me even when I tell her to wait because I'm trying to figure something out and sometimes I miss what the teacher says. Btw, I'm a really good student and I really care about my grades. So, aside from the annoying factor, she's a bad influence on me, although she has a great personality and would never force me to drink or whatever. I've ignored her calls before, but then she just leaves messages asking for homework help and after a few times, I finally call her back, or else she'll suspect something. At times, she calls five times in one hour because I don't pick up. I'm just so sick of this but I don't want our friendship to end because I've had a friend who had a bad influence on me so I kind of started a fight with her on purpse so that we wouldn't be friends anymore but the way I went about it was kind of mean, and now I regret it. Please help! Thank you so much.

So its hard for me to tell whether or not he's being serious. He asked me to the school dance, but I wasn't sure. So I replied that could answer it correctly whether or not he was joking which was the truth that I had to go to my dad's this weekend. Then he asked again and he's always giving me hugs and stuff. Well I guess the main question is how do you tell when a guy is being serious.

I hang out with this close friend all the time and it is obvious to the both of us that they are jealous of our relationship. It's really eating me up inside that the others would say things like this about me but I can't confront them because then they will all know that this close friends told some info they were not suppose to reveal. What must I do?

20090226170127AABokT4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do I still have to respect him?	Here it goes... I have 2 wonderful girls ages 3 and 5...The father has never really been there for them...He only seen my youngest once in his life and that is when she was 9 months old. He has seen the oldest a few times but when she was still really young...He has not seen both of them at all for about 2 years, nor has he even cared to call or whatever. All he does is pay child support because according to him "he has to pay."       Anyway, my eldest daughter won a contest and became queen. I put an ad on the newspaper saying that she is the daughter of myself and my husband now. (he has been raising my kids since my youngest was 3 months old)...He treats them with all the love he could give and they love him so much.       My mom got all mad because I put child of me and my husband. she said I should still respect the birth father and that he will cut chhild support because of that ad. When I filed for child support he waived all rights to a DNA test and told the court my kids are his. But what does that show? Can he cut the child support? even if he does, whatever...      My kids needed his love and attention. Atleats a phone call once a week or a visit. But NOTHING...ZIP...ZERO...My baby daddy has 3 other kids and he is with them at ALL times, they all live with him(one is from a previous relationship also and 2 from his current girlfreind)...      I just want to know. Should I still respect him? He has done nothing for my kids. He blames me for everything before. He never shows any emotion for my kids. He does not ask about them or anything. In the beginning when I had my eldest he didnt even wanna see her. He was not there when I was pregnant, both times and he was not there when I gave birth both times...Nor did he support at any time...(I was naive and 10 years younger than him, I was dumb...so i fell for his lies twice!!!)      Please help me. I hate that my mom would tell me this when in the beginning she told me not to respect him, now I must respect him because he is paying child supprt!!! So what! That is HIS obligation, he is the natural father!!!
20090226163827AAXRN0D	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Property settlement........?	My husband ex wife has dragged her feet for years, and they are finally going to have their property settlement next month.      They had/have alot of marital debt, which my husband has been servicing on his own since separation, she has made no contributions whatsoever.    She has now gone 'bankrupt', to get out of paying her share, so obviously my husband has to be fully accountable for the debt.   They have a large investment which is enough money to pay off that Martial debt, We are hoping that the judge will order that the marital debt be cleared with this money.   Do you think this will happen?      Part of the reason she filed bankruptcy was because she went into further debt through lawyers trying to keep my husband from having visits with their children. But im assuming that that debt would be considered ....post separation debt, that my husband should not be liable for?..............am I right in thinking that?

20090226164340AA82jxp	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What the heck? Why did he go off on me?	Okay so I am married and have been for just 2 years but together for a total of 10 years. I have a very close guy friend that I have been friends with for quite some time. However, something happened recently and I am unsure what to make of it. Me and my husband sometimes have issues because he likes to go out a lot and I allow him because I don’t want to cause fights and I know he does deserve to have fun although last year there was an incident that gives me reason to not trust him because he was caught red handed doing something wrong but I chose to forgive him and move on.    In any event my best guy friend does know about this because I needed someone to talk to and vented to him at the time. Well the other night my guy friend asked how me and my husband were doing I said we are okay you know that my husband still likes to go out a lot but you know things are ok. Well my friend then kind of went of on me he said the following to me in a way of a rant in a bit of a feisty voice:      “You are a dream wife. But you know what in this case especially if someone wants to take advantage of you I think things are your fault to because you don’t yell at your husband and tell him he can’t go out and question what he was doing. You know you aren’t his property that he can think he can just put you up on a shelf to wait around while he goes out and has fun and then take you down from the shelf whenever he needs you for minute. Your not just something on the floor for him to step over or through in the wash machine whenever he feels. You know I see you 30 years down the line in the same situation still married to him meanwhile he has had 3 kids with other women and bunch of diseases and your still going around like “tra la la la la” I know you won’t admit it but you are just to afraid to leave, I know you love him but I know your not happy but you are just to scared to leave him. You never will. And I am telling you this because I don’t want you to ever say to me “well you never said anything” because honestly if your husband isn’t listening when you tell him how you feel well then he is just stupid”      UMM Ok things really aren't as bad as he makes them out to be and I never even really talk to him about it he brings it up to me so I don't get it.      Since then he has been distant and ignorning me when I text him so yesterday I gave him a hard time about ignoring me I was just trying to be silly and he responded and said "What do you mean ignorning you? And last I checked your husband was "name"      What is up with him? I don't understand why he is being so hard on me and doesn't seem to want to be my friend?

20090226164115AAHlcLm	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help, I'm not sure what I should do...?	Alright so I was just recently told by one of my close friends this. Apparently at the beginning of the school year, someone asked my friend "Kate" if I was desperate. She defended me and said no at the time. Now apparently she's thinking differently. She says she thinks I am becoming desperate and getting a "reputation", because I go out with guys and tend to like more than one guy at a time. I was told she's not sure she wants to hang out with me as much because she thinks she'll get this bad "reputation".      I've only gone out with 3 guys ever. Granted one was a mistake.... But they weren't serious or anything. And yes, sometimes I like more than one guy at a time, but thats because I'm not sure who I like better.      She also thinks I dont believe anything that she or one of my friends says aka rumors. which I don't. So whenever they tell me something, I always ask the person its about first, which I thought was a good thing to do.      I'm not sure what I can say to her. She's normally a really good friend, but now I'm not sure what to think, and I'm kind of mad at her. How can I talk to her about it????
20090226163127AAQg7XB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I connect emotionally? Ten point's for best answer, but I'm not a push over.?	So me and my boyfriend are very close. Allot of thing's have been going on at home recently.   My step dad who I adore, I have a bad relationship with my dad so James is pretty much the father figure in my life. He makes my mum so happy, he is great for her and I love him for that.   He went for his 5 year check up after having bowel cancer and they found something. They opened him up but decided that they didn't want to Proceed and they haven't said why. They discharged him and he's really confused to why.    He got s depressed that he left my mum, told her to never talk to him again and tried to kill himself. He then phoned her crying saying how sorry he was but he didn't want to cause her heartache if anything was to happen.    I feel like I need to just let out my emotion's and my boyfriend is the closest person to me. Should I tell him ? Will this connect us emotionally ?
20090226164242AAcGjtc	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you think I am going over the top?	A few months ago randomly out of the blue, my partners brother and his girlfriend started sending me abusive messages via MSN, eg im a fat wh**e/s**g etc a lazy bum (im a mom to 3 kids at home and also suffer with chronic sciatica) i dont respect my partner or kids (rubbish), that my partner pays all the bills (rubbish) that i should kill myself and that me and my "bratty" kids are nothing to do with his family (one is his nephew) etc theres a h*ll of alot more but it would take too long to type it.       Now obviously i blocked and deleted them. But I made up a new MSN addy and it added everyone off my old list even though they were blocked, so yesterday they started again only threatening to come down and beat me up  and kill me, even saying "can i kill you please" along with all of the bad insults you can think of!!       Now i told my partner about this when it started and he did nothing apart from tell his brother to stop it. Which i was rather annoyed at.       His Mom then started with the insulting emails and his sister who has never met me started today. I was crying hysterically down the phone to my Mom last night for over an hour about it and having nightmares last night!! I havent done or said anything.       They seem to think that i have wished their unborn baby dead! I am a mother to 5 why would i. All i said is that they should have maybe used protection as they are 16/17.       My partner just will not stand by me, I have been a nervous wreck, some of you might think I am being pathetic but it is really getting to me. I have told my partner that me and my kids including their nephew/grandson are having anything to do with them again or going up to visit, I have told my partner that i cant believe that he isnt sticking by me, his partner and mother of his child. He even had the cheek to laugh and snigger in my face when i was telling him everything that had been said!      One thing that got me is that the GF said that she is catholic. (i am not religious but i have alot more typical religious values inside of me such as treat all as equal, dont judge, be kind to thy neighbour etc etc)   How can she call her self catholic when she is speaking to anyone like that?      This isnt coming across as bad as it is when i am typing it down as obviously im not putting the chat logs on.       This is part vent, part question. Do you think I am over reacting? or would you feel the same?

Myself and this guy who we will call "Tim" are really good friends....in the last few wks he has told me that he felt more strongly towards me than merely friends,,,,i told him i was flattered and it moved on from there nothing happened between us...although i did think that perhaps his phonecalls were becoming alot longer and alot more flirty....At the time i was confused with my feelings in that i was not sure if i liked him as just a friend or if i felt something deeper for him...when you are friends with someone for a long time sometimes its hard to distinguish feelings....!!!Anyway one nite while chatting i felt that we were growing ever closer to each other and our lips almost locked only i hesitated and said we needed to talk first that there was alot at stake our friendship being most important......so thats what we did but i knew that what happened next had to be decided by me merely because he had persued me the first time and i hesitated...so the next nite we did actually kiss and everything was great....we chatted and said we would give things ago and i was delighted.....i realised that for a long time underneath our friendship also lyed a really close bond that i knew was more than just friendly.....however he what seems like panicked at the first sign of commitment and said i think we should only be friends...now i dnt know what to do, things seem fine but i wonder can we ever really be friends again.....i miss the closeness that we had only a few months ago i feel as though we are drifting even though he thinks not and i think that maybe the friendliness we are currently sharing may only be a cover on his part and that now he doesnt really want things back to the way they were previous!!!!???Any ideas as to how i can/ we can move on????Anyone been in the same situation before??Thanks.
20090226164942AANzlhL	Family & Relationships;Friends	High School Bullying. What can I do?	So basically, There's this guy that I've had a LOT of issues with. He was "in love" with my best friend, and kept saying he'd kill himself if she didn't love him, then he threatened to kill her. Later, he told me he wished he had.      Naturally, we no longer speak to him or anything. But now he keeps saying he's changed, etc, etc. I still wouldn't believe him and go back to being friends with him.      Now, whenever I see him, he makes snide, rude comments about me, and basically puts me down. I have to sit next to him at lunch (thats where all my friends are and we never switch seats) and he's always just saying "nobody cares" "you don't have any friends" "you're ugly," etc. I know thats stupid trivial stuff, but as someone who is recovering from a self-loathing problem and eating disorder, It really messes with me.      My problem is, everyone just thinks its high school drama. There's nothing I can do to make him stop, because I have no proof of the threats and things he's done. I try ignoring him, but it continues and I end up crying every day when I drive home from school. I'm afraid to walk past him in the hall, so I take the long way because I don't want to hear about how fat I am.      What is there for me to do?

Me, my friend and him were all in a hallway, and he asked her out right there and she said yes, and then they kissed. When they kissed, even in my sleep i could FEEL something. I can't pinpoint if it was anger, sadness, or envy, and all i can describe it as is the most awful thing i have ever felt, almost like a pain in my chest but also an emotion that ran through my veins.       Is this jealousy?   I thought i knew what jealousy was and had felt it before, but after experiencing this, i dont know anymore.      Any and all answers are greatly appreciated =]

20090226163839AAaxR71	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I know a deadbeat mom.?	This woman has three daughters with different husbands who have custody and was court ordered to pay child support in Alabama. She only works where she can get paid "under the table" to avoid having to pay her child support. Now living in Kansas and doing quite well, she is behind by at least 15 years. Is there someway she can be made to pay what she rightfully owes? She attempts to make people feel sorry for her because she has no contact with her daughters..........I just think all the focus is on deadbeat dads and for whatever reason the "moms' among us who ditch their responsibility get away with it. If anyone knows who I can report her to please advise.

20090226164731AAJnzab	Family & Relationships;Friends	What does "just friends mean"?	Theres this boy, I really like him, and I told him that. Then he told his guy friend to tell me that he wasn't interested, so I left him alone and didn't say a word to him for half of the day...like he apparantly wanted. The same day, in the afternoon at school, he wouldn't stop talking to me and giving me huge smiles. At the end of the day I went to get my coat, but it wasn't there, I soon noticed that he was wearing it. I said, "I don't understand...I thought you wanted nothing to do with me." He said, "i want to be your good friend, I want us to be tight." What do I do??? I still like him, but what does being tight mean?? Should I keep on ignoring him?

20090226173716AATjuZF	Family & Relationships;Friends	I ended our frienship. Was I wrong?	Recently my guy friend has been acting really odd around me at work. He barely talks to me and he barely looks at me. We used to be completely opposite of that. We talked and laughed as good friends would do. He has got me thinking that I did something to offend him so one day I sent him a message asking him if I had done anything that had upset him or made him mad and he denied it but then asked me how I was doing. After that I was like well ok maybe it was just a little phase. I thought that until a couple of days ago when I was standing right beside him and he didn't look or speak to me. It was like I didn't exist to him and he knew I was there because other people had said hey to me. He used to always tell me hey at least. So anyway I talked to one of my friends today and she told me that his girlfriend has some kind of grudge against me. I was furious but all the pieces came together. I sent him another message saying that I am deleting his number and his myspace and told him what I had heard and that I believed it was true and that I wish him the best in life. He definitely receieved the message but he didn't even reply. What do you think is going on? Why do you think he didnt reply? What do you think will happen?

20090226180943AAWVBLI	Family & Relationships;Family	Being kept from my father?	Hi, my mom and dad divorced when i was 4 and i now live with my mom and step dad and i am 14. I had supervised visitations with him for about 1 year but then it turned into visits at his house which was being paid for by his mother. But about 3 years ago, we stopped visits with him completely because my sister didn't want to see him anymore, so that meant that i had to stop as well. So i didn't see him for 3 years. After that, he lost his job and his mother (my grandmother) died. And he became homeless and now lives in his car. And it's breaking my heart. I can't stand to think of him like this. Last time i saw him was about half a year ago and he looked bad. He's loosing his hair- he's only 38- and his teeth look like they are rotting and he is so skinny and bony now. He didn't used to be like this. And he doesn't have a disease. I know it's from malnutrition and starvation.       Anyhow, I really want to see him again. He lives close to my city. But my whole entire family hates him and i know my family will be mad at me for wanting to see him again. But i can't help but love him. He's MY father and i should be able to see him whenever i want to. My mother insists that i only get to see him and continue my realtionship with him when i am 18. But i can't/will not wait that long. He may die from malnutrition then and it'll be too different. I don't want to wait too long, to where when i do see him-it'll be too painful. Him and i will look so different and i will be afraid by the time im 18. I want to see him and i want it to be now. Not 18, not 20, not 30, not even 15 or 16. Now. I don't know how i will do it but i am determined to. I think i may know where to find him but i do not want to run away from home, and i don't want to be separated from my mother. I just want to keep in touch with him and be connected and see him once in a while so i won't forget what he looks like, which has actually already happened. I envy my friends who still live with their fathers and i wish it could be the same. So many people are against him because he is different and rebelious and a GOOD parent. I love that about him. And i miss it as well. Please help me figure out a way to reunite with my father again. I don't know how to contact him. I don't have his number or e-mail or anything. Sometimes it scares me when my step father talks about how he will kill him if he ever sees him again. I have to close my ears when i hear him talking about how he can "throw my father through a wall". I want to be with my father, so much. Please help, thankyou .
20090226181251AAKYUrI	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I stop being so jealous?	I was fine with my best friend in the beginning of the year. Suddenly, I just SO badly wanted to be her!

And I love her voice and she's really really photogenic and super pretty. Everybody thinks she's adorable. I so badly want to be her! I went through this with my cousin too. I wanted to be HER too because she was smart and pretty and cleanly. How can I stop this and just be happy with who I am?

But he's so smart though: he almost always gets the correct answer on Jeopardy! He also doesn't seem to look ahead into the future...i mean, has he thought about how he's going to survive when my grandparents are no longer around to pay the house payments, bills, etc.? I wish he'd go back to school and get a better job but he doesn't seem to mind. I really pity him, he has so much potential to be so much more, but he just seems to be content the way he is.

20090226181236AAMxhd5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	For the asker who was disappointed with her wedding present from her MIL who lives in India (I think!)?	Well, this might not make sense, but here goes.      Earlier tonight, a woman asked for some support because her mother-in-law couldn't be at her wedding and sent her a wedding present that didn't really seem appropriate. She was disappointed, and her husband spoke to his mother, and the MIL put together a different package and sent it to her.      The question was deleted, probably because many hassled the asker about being greedy. However, I didn't believe her problem or question represented greed at all, and hope that the woman who asked that question reads this:      My original answer -       Well, I don't know if it's the materialism you're concerned with rather than the thoughtfulness. It sounds important to you for your MIL to embrace you and welcome you to the family, and the gift you received at first didn't really represent that. Since she couldn't be there to deliver he welcome and warm wishes in person, the gift, to you, became symbolic of those messages.      I think your husband did amazingly by discussing this with your MIL. I also think it was very, very thoughtful that she tried to put a few things together for you that were probably a little more appropriate.      Also, being away from her son, missing the wedding and not having the opportunity to meet you and know you was probably very traumatic for her.      I'd suggest that you call her (or write her), let her know that you are sorry that she couldn't be there for the wedding and that you know that must have been difficult for her. Also let her know how much it means to you that she took the time and caring to put such thoughtful things together for you. Before signing off, also let her know that you're very excited about getting to know her better and hope that the two of you can develop your own special relationship.      You'll be acknowledging her difficulties, thanking her for her kindness, and laying the groundwork for a healthy relationship that will be more in keeping with what your vision for your family is.      And know, please, that she will always treat you differently from her son because they have a different type of relationship. You and your MIL will develop your own special brand of kinship over the years to come.      I hope this helps some, and best wishes!

I've been liking this guy for a year and were good friends and all and throughout that year he's been on and off with his girlfriend, but they are very serious and seemingly in love . About 8 months ago i told him that i liked him and we've been flirting and hanging out ever since . WHILE HE STILL HAD A GF ! and about a month ago, he told me he liked me, and about 2 weeks ago, we made out & he was still with his girlfriend !      Im just so confused right now because whenever i see him together i tell myself that i don't like him anymore and go into serious denial, but then he does something so cute and charming, i fall for him again ! I am just so frustrated and so confused and im debating whether i just move on, or keep liking him .      yeah, sure, i should just move on, but it's not as easy as it seems;   i see him everyday on campus, and my bestfriends are really good friends with him .      what the fu*k should i do ?!

On top of that, when I asked if she was seeing anyone or if she was in a relationship when we first started chatting she said no. A couple of months later she confessed to me that she was with someone and that she had been lying to him and me. I told her it didn't matter as long as it was over between them and she said it was - two weeks later she move to my state and we've been together every since. When I asked her what the boyfriend did she said nothing but that she was just miserable, unhappy and wanted out. I asked her why she lied to me she said she didn't want to lose me because I was the only bright thing in her life. I felt so bad for her. I've already started to care about her. She said it was the first time she ever cheated on anyone. So, hypothetically speaking, if you were me would you bounce or give it a chance? The fact that she cheated and lied concerns me but I know everyone makes mistakes.

20090226180053AAjtNXT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Huge guy dilemma! 10 pts.!?	All right, I have been dating my bf for almost 3 yrs. now. We have had a numerous amout of problems and some how we managed to stay together. Just recently he moved and I only get to see him once a week.    About a week ago I met this guy who is a bit older than I am, and wow I am starting to feel things for him. I would love to date him BUT I have a bf. So I'm not even sure on what I'm feeling for my bf anymore. If I keep thinking about this other guy, does that mean I should leave my bf?    This guy that I met is exciting, fun, outgoing, and ambitious. I love that. My bf has none of those qualities. I highly doubt he likes me back. At first I thought he might but I'm not even sure.Besides he recently got out of a 5 yr relationship. So if I leave my bf, we'd both basically be on the rebound and that doesnt sound like it would lead to anything good. But omg this guy just completely blew me away and I want someone like that.   So here's my dilemma! What in the world do I do? Should I leave my bf and go after this other guy? Or should I just drop it? What if this other guy is not even interested??? Ahh goodness what do I do?   Thanks!!!
20090226180121AABsHxr	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can someone judge this and tell me if im acting normal or if I am just being a meanie?	Hi.. Let me get straight to the point.      There is this guy, he is 29 years old and im 19, anyway he is my neighbour and when I see him, I say hi and sometimes we have small talk.      Recently I added him on facebook and obviously he can see my conversations, pictures and beliefs etc      Now, he feels as if he can really relate to me and he has told me that if I ever feel stressed or if "life is treating me bad" that I can go to him and as a brother he will help me out.      This guy is like VERY spiritual and philosophical. He was locked up for 8 years when he was young for something he did not do (I know cause we go to the same community center)      Anyway he says stuff like "I can tell from your eyes that you are stressed and life is not treating you too well" and he always tries to be nice and helpful but the thing is... i hate him.      I feel like such a twat for saying this, I DNT KNOW WHY but i just really dislike him. He tries to act all nice but the thing is im not stressed or anything and at times I feel like saying "just fcuk off!" to him but obviously I cant!      Why am I being like this? Am I mean ? I seriously feel bad for saying this but the thing is.. I avoid him and pray I never bump into him.   His soooo emotional and ... spiritual and it bothers me when he says stuff like "Life is not being good to you" I mean.. how the F do u know?      ARGH! Am i being a *****?

20090226180609AAIlB9q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I situation i cant explain?	I'm in high school and I like this guy named Shane. He's in my grade and he's in 4 of my classes. I have never spoken to him. In the beginning of the year, at lunch, I had one of my male friends, Brandon, ask Shane if he had a girlfriend. Shane said no. Soon Shane found out that it was me who told Brandon to ask him the gf question. He found out that I liked him. Shane and his friends avoided me. I didn't try to get his attention after that. A couple months ago, I noticed that Shane has been looking at me A LOT inside and outside class and he started to hangout by me and my group of friends at lunch. We're outside at lunch and during the middle of lunch, Shane and his friends come out and stand a couple feet away from me. Whenever I look at him, his entire group of guys are always looking at me with no expressions on their faces. Seriously, they ALL look in my direction. I can't figure out why? Maybe you guys can solve this.

20090226171010AAZ0h9m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she trying to trap me with pregnancy?	i had a one night stand with this girl a few weeks back, shes been txting me asking me to meet up but i dont really want to, i've got a girlfriend now and everything, and today i told her that i had a girlfriend      before i told her she txt me asking me if i wanted to go to her house party cause it was going to be good ect, and asked me to bring a few mates, and made out there was going to be alot of people there with beer ect, she was being very nice about this, then i said i had a girlfriend and that i was going to her house for the night, then i got a txt a few minutes later saying she might be pregnant (keeping in mind she only told me this when i told her i had a girlfriend), the word ''might'' is a pretty dumb thing to say when you have tests available now in shops which give you an accurate answer, is she trying to trap me? surly anyone in the right mind would go to the shop and buy a pregnancy test if they had a slight concern about it, another thing is that surly if she thought she was pregnant she wouldnt be having an house party with beer ect?
20090226173549AAqlm9d	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	An Attractive woman without a man vs an unattractive woman with a husband?	Do you think that an unattractive married woman is more content and less stressed out than a pretty woman with no husband or boyfriend.      If the married woman is not in a good marriage, of course she will be unhappy...so let us just say that she is content in her marriage..       the pretty woman may get lots of attention and many men may ask her out but she is single and not in a serious long lasting relationship..      I hear that some men may be intimidated by having a really attractive wife..they may not be comfortable having a wife that many men will try to get next too..   No, I'm not saying that beautiful women do not get married and no i'm not saying that all unattractive women have husbands..      When I say beautiful women - i mean like beauty like janet jackson, beyonce, jessica simpson, vanessa williams...   unattractive - whoopi goldberg, Rosane,    these names are just examples not to be taken too seriously...gimmie a break all societies have beauty standards...
20090226180814AAyGPrK	Family & Relationships;Family	Having Issues with Mom!?	This may be a little long, i'm sorry :[   I'm 14, and have always had issues with my mother. Were always arguing, and if were not arguing, she's criticizing something about me. I can never just walk out the door without having something "wrong" with me. She wont let me have friends over, ever. And she never gives me a reason why, it just "is". I call her a "sour pickle" because she's always so negative about every situation life has to offer, and she gets offended by it.  I just feel like she seriously needs to take a walk in my shoes for a while, before she says things to me. She often talks about how disrespectful i am, and how my brothers were never like me, it makes me feel wrong. She always says "Thank God you have your mother and father!, You never thank God!" She has no idea how much i thank God, how much i hope, and wish, and wait. She has no idea! I am perfectly normal, i am a good kid, i get good grades, and i just want to be happy for a moment, and laugh. Be who i am without anyone bringing me down.   Any advice?   It would REALLY help :)   Thank you.

20090226175438AA4oTd3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to stop being secretly angry at my fiance?	I am feeling secretly angry and resentful at my fiance because of his many family friends.  I trust him, but it still annoys me.  They leave him messages saying they love him and hearts and stuff like "sorry I missed your call."  It just bugs me.  I have mentioned that it bugs me, but he always says he has no idea what what could possibly be wrong.  So I try not to mention it.  But holding it in is making me angry inside!  What can I do :( I don't want to be jealous.  But I feel bad about all his CLOSE female friends.

It must be annoying to have your mother say Have you eaten anything, are you hungry, do you want something to eat etc. Your child could be the most self sufficient person on the planet but when they come to visit your main thought is I must feed him or her.

20090226172011AAyCtKD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please answer I've asked before and got no replies!?	Ive been dating this girl a couple months and things have been going great. The last couple weeks we have spoken less although we had a really fun and romantic valentines weekend. She claims she is busy and havent been talking as much and her texts seem shorter and less enthusiastic. On friday I asked if she wanted to hang out this week if she was free. She said she definitely did and once again said she wanted to hang out this week to me on tuesday. Despite this we havent talked as much as Ive been trying to give her space. Tonight shes coming to my place then we're supposed to go get a drink and meet up with a mutual friend. Does it seem like she might be trying to spend time with me to tell me she's not interested? Is she just really busy? When I get her messages they just don't have the same 'feel' Im used to, but her friend said last week shes really into me and smitten. Is it a big deal what her friend said or should I ignore that?
20090226175543AAC61zP	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I become more confident when home alone at night with my two year old?	My husband doesn't get home until 12:30am, and after it gets dark I get so paranoid and scared. I lived in this house alone for three years before my husband and I married, but since our son was born a couple of years ago, I'm so paranoid to be home alone. I think I hear things all the time outside, and the other night there was someone walking around by our house (I saw them) and I just froze, called my husband and begged him to come home. I'm terrified to the point where I can barely move. He never bothered us, and I have a gun in the bedroom, but I'm still scared every night. It's like, knowing that I'm solely responsible for his safety is too much for me. I'm nervous all the time and it causes me to get short with him. I try and make hm stay quiet and get really upset when he makes loud noises.. IDK what to do. Should I talk to someone about this or am I just a freak? :/

20090226173344AAdmDx7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I meet him, should I not?	He is from another country.  We were going to university then, but due to family objections, we went apart and set up our own families.  Both our marriages never really took off.  We still keep in touch once in a blue moon. After 2 decades, there is a possibility for us to meet.  Though we are still married to our respective spouse, we still harbor strong feelings for each other.  Question is ... should I meet him if he is in town?  Remember... our feelings for each other remains strong despite being apart for more than 20 years.  One thing may lead to another.  What is your take?      I do not need character judgement answers please.   Thank you.

20090226175134AA0iPuZ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I leave him or not? (Long story)?	I'm in a long distance relationship. I met my bf in India in High school. It was love at first sight. My parents were in America at that time and I had no relatives living near the school I was going to, so I had to stay at the principal's house.    Before I tell u my love story, you should know a little about my past. Now, I won't take up all ur time and tell u my whole life story but u should know some details. When I was 4 yrs. old, I went to India in a boarding school while my parents were here in America. I was in India with my sister, who is 5 yrs. older than me so I was mostly raised by my sister. We only came here in vacation and started living here again after when I was 13 and my sister was 18. Now I'm 20 and my sister moved out when she was 22. As a kid, I spent really little time with my mom and dad, so sometimes I try to talk to them now. Unfortunately, I have a loud and sound like I'm talking from my nose. I tried to improve it so much, but I think this is just the way God made me. Everytime I try to talk to my mom, she just tells me that I'm annoying and walks away and my dad is very nice, but he just stays on his computer. My younger brother, 7 yrs. younger, also tells me that I'm annoying. I have no one to talk to. I don't evn want to call my sister because she's changed too. She is also against my love. She doesn't understand me anymore.   In the Indian school, first my teacher found out about my love. After having a lond talk with me, she told me to leave the guy, I said OK. But as soon as I come near my bf, I feel happy, otherwise I always feel depressed from my family. I didn't leave him so my tacher told the principal. Because I was living at their house, I was yelled at all the time. I thought my parents would understand, so I called them and told them that they are yelling at me. When the principal told my parents about my bf, even my parents yelled at me and threatened me that if I don't leave him, they'll take me back to America. I tried reasoning with my parents and told them that I love him and can't live without him. My prents just said that it was young love and obsession. To quiet down my parents, I told them that I'll leave him, but I didn't. After my parents found out again, they dad threatened me that if I don't leave him, he'll get people to kill my bf. I got scared and had to leave my man. One day, he asked me why I'm not talking to him so I told him what my dad said, but my bf said "I will die for you but I won't live without you". We got back together. One day, I was standing on the roof and he was passing by so he decided to stop and we just talked in our own sign language. When the principal's son saw us, he told his dad, his dad told my teacher, my teacher and the principal both told my parents. Next day, they told me it was a holiday from school, I thought that was kinda' wierd because there was no occasion on that day, but I didn't question him because he was the principal. After nearly 15 minutes, my parents walked in and told me to pack my stuff because they were taking me back to America. I begged and cried infront of them to let me stay but they told me "no". I had to leave without even letting my friends and bf know. I was taking the flight alone so I called my bf from the airport. When I told him what happened with me and how I was forced to leave, he started crying and he said "no matter what, I'll never leave u, I'll come to America on a visa and find u and marry u".   When I came to America, we e-mailed each other, but my dad found out. After that, my own dad called me names and threatened me again to kill my bf. I said "if u kill him, then I will commit suicide or die with him". But My dad said I'm being stupid and I should just leave him. Now, my sister and my dad check my e-mails. Since then, I've never talked to him.    I made a new e-mail address from school and e-mailed him and told him about what happened and told him we can't talk anymore. He said "I'll wait for u forever"...   Why my dad hates my bf? I have no idea. My dad says that he is not of my level, he has a dark skin and I'm light-skinned, he lives in India and I live in America, he gets low scores on his exams and i get good grades, he comes from a lower middle class family and I come from upper middle class family, and he's 2 yrs. younger than me(18 yrs. old). Being from a lower middle class is not his fault, his father passed away when he was 4. I don't know what to do. plz help me. and don't say try talking to ur parents because i've tried that already. Everytime we even watch a movie with a love story,  they say that it's just bullshit. I know my parents will never agree. His elder brother approves of me. He says that he can convince his mom, but I'm not sure. Do you think it's right for me to leave my bf from my parent's happiness and be sad myself?

He is actually not my uncle but i am consider him my uncle   Here is my story    I have 9 sisters 4 older 4 younger and my twin sister and one more sister on the way. I have to share a room with my twin sister and my 6-year-old sister. I don't care we have a big room. My twin and I are not 13 yet.   We all go to a private Christian school.

They are tying to get   Our parents to buy me my own makeup and girl clothes.

I like dancing and some other girly stuff. I do have some female features. My voice is soft like a girls. My hair is down to my shoulders. I look like my twin sister. I look like a girl. But i am a boy. I got a full body scan yesterday. I been have some pain. It feels like a girl having her period.    They did some other test today and They found out that I have a    working female reproduction system.    They believe that there me and my sister were going to be triplets but one did not grow and apart of the thing got on me to make me partly a boy. It is hard to explain    When i do get the surgery I have to be a wake. They wont be able to put me to sleep the stuff they use. will make me ill. So they said when i do deiced they will allow my twin to be in    the room with me during it. So she can keep my mind of off the pain.      I already have a girl name. The hospital messed up my name.   My name is amy. But I go by one of my middle names. I have two middle names. I go by one of them which is Jeremiah I have a long name.

I have female hormones.    After my doctors appointment. My mom and my twin sister and I went and ate at wendy's and talked.    Then after we ate. I went and got my ear's priced. Then my mom and twin sister helped me get girl clothes and makeup. Shoes, makeup. A purse.   Some days i fell like i should be a girl. I already have the girl name so i want have to change it.       I am scared of surgery. But i want to have biolgical kids. If I want    to have kids i need surgery and i know it wont take long. I know i    will have to stay in the hospital no more then a week.

20090226171102AAz9qXQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I avoid this family?	I have been seeing/ visiting my neighbors for about a year and a half now. I recently stopped (October to be exact) and I haven't visited them since. I just didn't feel the connection anymore, and the grandma there was too religious for my taste and a real sour puss. I used to like that, but I grew up a bit and realized I wasn't into that. Just today, my mom drove me over there without telling me, and the family smiled at me while the grandma bombarded me with questions as to why I wasn't visiting. And then when we were about to leave, they told me to visit them, or else they'd drag me to their home. My mom likes these people. A lot. But there's no "real" communication between them. When I did visit them a lot, I was overly cheerful and go-lucky naturally. Now I'm calm, thoughtful,  and I prefer to be quiet and to myself. How do I deal with this?

I've never even had a girlfriend or gone on a date even.  But my parents are constantly pressuring me to get married and even offering to find me a girl, but I am not interested.  Marriage has too many burdens and too few benefits for me to get into, at least that's how I see it.  I'm not interested in having kids or dealing with them because kids can be a big pain and I relish my freedom as a single person.  And I fear getting married because there are so many unknowns, and it is a very well known fact that the divorce rate is very high.  What's the chance for me to have a happy marriage anyway given the high divorce rate?  Seems that even many couples that stay together in longtime marriages have serious problems.  I've never really desired the company of a woman, and my desire for intimacy is quite low.  Since I am an only child, my parents keep yelling at me that I will have no family to support me after they die.  They especially panic about the possibility that I would get sick after they die and no one will be helping me.  How can I address this with them?  They especially want to live to have grandkids and they don't want to hear that I am not interested in having kids even if I get married.  I truly want to avoid all the heartaches of marriage and parenthood and it seems the only way to do that is to never get married.  Don't many marriages have constant fights?  Aren't most girls only interested in marrying boys to get their money?  I have a good job and a master's degree and don't want a woman to just take my money and squander it.  If I have kids, even they will want the latest and most expensive fashions, toys, and electronics that I have no interest in having.  I can only have complete control of my life if I don't get involved with women.  Why can't my parents understand that?  They think I don't interpret information properly when they tell me I must get married to have a companion.  I could never regard a woman as a "companion" anyway!  Women are mostly painful burdens to men, at least at some point.  I have only one life, don't I have a right to enjoy it even though it means solitude and celibacy for me?
20090226172210AA5mQcJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help with writing this girl a note?	Hey guys, so theres this girl i started to like about 2 months ago. So i go up to her, introduce myself to her and continously make her laugh. Some weeks i'd really talk to her, but realizing i was getting into the "friend zone" i would tone it down the next week, and pick it up again later. But recently i took a chance, i wrote her a note. I pretty much said she was the Greatest in big bubble letters, and that i was faster then her (shes a really fast runner). She responded by giving me this amazing note, i mean she must have really took her time with it. There was color and the letters were amazing, and she said i was the best in big bubble letters and she had a heart next to my name. She also said we should race some time, then finished it off with her name and a heart next to it. It was a big confidence booster for me, but the only problem is i dont know what to write in my next note. I kinda want to step it up a notch by subtly saying i want to be more then friends, but dont know how. help? Thanks.

20090226175720AA0fPsY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Have an irritating friend(s) or experienced similar situation? Advice?	I am quickly approaching the end of my high school chapter and have realized that though I have met plenty of fun friends, I cannot truly call anyone my "best friend." I've been quite alright with this fact for the past few years but, perhaps because I have changed, but I constantly notice how ignorant and immature my "friends" are.      I used to LOVE my friends. They were my everything; I switched out of a magnet school to go to my local high school because of them.   But as of today, I cannot, cannot stand them and I feel absolutely horrible that I can't just be happy.      For example, this girl I have known my entire life, whom everyone would expect me to refer to as my "best friend," is the biggest thorn in my life, ever. I used to LOVE her. Now, everyday, I notice how she constantly tries to outshine me (always checking my test scores to see if she did better, though with utmost humility: she NEVER does better, yet she checks every time anyways.) She yells out, "That's so gay!" to absolutely every situation and I just don't understand how a situation can be "homosexual." Her ignorance never ceases to amaze me: (these are the most irritating, imagine comments like this everyday) I tell her I was a plump baby, and she replies "What the hell?! That's so gross. I was skinny." or I tell her I went to Chinatown yesterday and she replies, "Oh my God. Asian people everywhere--that's DISGUSTING!" Keep in mind, please, that she is herself Asian. I discuss Judaism with her in AP World class and all she has to say is "Jewish people wear funny hats and have ugly curly sideburns." Seriously? What the hell.       Honestly, if we did not grow up together, I would never, ever be friends with this girl. But it's too late, I already am. There is absolutely no way to end our friendship because my hatred is one way and she would just not understand where I am coming from. I often correct her intolerant and ignorant comments by asking why she thinks that way but she replies with little more than "Oh, yeah, I guess you're right." No progress marked.      This is not to say that I hate all my friends. I adore some and get along with others who unfortunately act like 5-year-olds. We are extremely cordial towards each other, "friendly" and "friends," yet I secretly count down the days until graduation when I can leave them all behind.      Is this some sort of teenage angst I've never experienced before? Am I going crazy? I literally want to punch her in the face and I am probably the most pacifist person you will ever meet. Do I just tough it out and never talk to her ever again after Grad? I just need some advice to survive my final days. Thank you.

20090226180053AAHHjtq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i a bad person for doing this?	ok so i knew this girl from school, who would always try to make people think she was a bad *** (sort of). well in junior high she would always want to hang out with the crowd that got in trouble and she'd always make herself sound like she was in a bunch of fights, and she curses alot. well now where seniors in high school and i guess she left her family to go live with someone else, all of a sudden she starts calling me and telling me all this drama that's happening in her life, she even went as far as to walk to my house. i really want her to leave me alone, cause i cant handle to much drama right now, and she told my mom a sad story about her home life, but what she left out was that she wanted to leave and always told me she wanted to be with her boyfriend. but now my mom wants to help her, but i don't, i want her to stay out of my life. Does this make me a bad person?

20090226180347AA4kS8b	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How long is long enough?	So the wife and I have her step brother staying with us. We pay half the rent, he pays half. The family rule was always everyone pays their share, unless you we're married. Then you're considered one party and pay your share as such.    So here's the deal. For the past week her step brother has had this girl living with him in his room. She showers here, uses the puters and all that. He actually feeds her. (If you call a large pepperoni sitting in the fridge for the week a daily meal)   So whats considered long enough for this girl to be considered an equal party as far as paying bills go? 2 weeks? A month? 3 days? Is there an actual law detailing this? Thanks!

20090225115903AAFrYZB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Was I right or wrong when I told my daughter that hard work pays off, and  and one can feel rich being poor.?	My daughter is single with no children. She bought a home back in 2007. Since the times have gotten so hard, she now works two full time jobs. When she is going to and from work, she often pass people that have never held or quit their job, and some that have been laid off of work still or partying, playing card games in their back yard; in other words, having fun. She cannot seem to understand that, even though these people are not working, they can still be happy. I told her that happiness is in the mind, and a person can live in poverty, but yet fill rich, and she is very blessed to have two jobs. She feels that the government is unfair and that they should be spending their time job hunting and not so carefree.
20090226191239AApdOpY	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my dad keep stealing money off everyone in the family?	He works fulltime and so does my mum. 100% of his pay goes to pay mortgage and the family lives off my mum's salary. My dad gets $50 pocket money every week. My mum doesn't spend any except for her public transport fares. She's struggling and finding work very stressful. I'm currently studying so I cannot financially support the family this year. I just don't understand why my dad can't try and negotiate some more money if he wants more and instead goes behind everyone's back and steals. If he doesn't have any money he gets into depression and starts drinking instead. He's the type that can't stay home and has to be moving about everyday. He makes me lie to my mum when he has stolen money. I think he spends average $200/wk. Why is he doing this? How can I stop him from lying to his wife? I find his behaviour disgusting and unacceptable but he's my dad.

20090226191222AAnDu21	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why didn't he believe me, & now is blaming me for it?	Prior to marriage, I told my ex that I knew nothing about sex. He didnt believe me. Then we got married, and he found out, that I really knew nothing about sex. Then he told all who'd listen that I was bad in bed. I told him I knew nothing about sex. I did everything he taught me to do, and whatever came natural, I did also. I also dont kiss n tell adults about my sex life, so it was a shock n disgrace when he told all who would listen that I was bad. But now, it's my fault. We watched a few movies together, I did all those things he wanted. I wasnt a sexaholic prior to marriage, I didn't make a habit of looking at magazines or movies either. And of course, no practice. So with all these things, I thought I was ok. Plus, that's what he told me too...that I was pretty good. But once he was done with our relationship, he decided to make it my fault for not wanting it enough, and he went n told everyone. Then, he alleges in divoce papers that we NEVER did anything!

School work is adding too much pressure and lack of sleep and falling asleep in class the next day doesn't help.   My mom and I got into a bad argument and now she won't talk to me at all.   My dad and I aren't too close, so I can't talk to him about anything personal.   My sister is close to me and vice versa, but she's younger than me, so I can't go to her for most issues.   Lately, colleges have been sending stuff to me, including letters inviting me to visit their campus and consider their college when I apply next year.   I don't know why, but I want to get away from New York City.   I love the city and the people, but I have this feeling that some time away might do me some good.      Then I also remembered when I was little and sometimes now, at times I would feel unloved.   I've only made friendly acquaintices at school and no one from school has become my best friend or anything like that.

20090226184530AAEirKW	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Inappropriate music and the wedding dance?	I'm wondering if the wedding music at the wedding dance is suppose to reflect the ceremony or the couple? Or if it's just music and doesn't have anything to do with the wedding/couple?      For example, I'll pick a song which many people will be familiar: "One Way or Another" by Blondie. It's a rocking song that would be fine for a dance party, but would it be okay for a wedding dance? Basically she's stalking him! Would the guests relate it back to the married couple?       What do you think? I don't just mean that song as that was just an example; songs in general. Obviously there's going to be upbeat dance songs, not just slow romantic ballads.  Chances are the songs might say something that the couple wouldn't want to be associated with in the lyrics.  And of course I'd avoid any songs relating or suggesting a break up or leaving.       So do you think it's just music or that it should relate to the theme of love and marriage?

Finding things to fight about even though there is nothing worth fighting about?

When I first starting dating my bf he was involved with the yahoo personals and had a membership,  this was a couple of years ago,  well he said he is no longer a member and I believed him until the other day I was cleaning our house and looked at his credit card statement that was left on the counter,  I saw the charge for this dating service and he is still enrolled.

20090226181356AAUtOqF	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I convince my parents that I'm ready to get a new car?	I was in a wreck recently. It was an accident. I'd been distracted with other issues, and I guess my mind was somewhere other than on the road.       They were going to get me a new car because the one I wrecked (and totaled) had a bunch of miles and engine problems and it wasn't a reliable car. Then once the wreck happened, they said they want to wait a while to get me a new one.      I think I'm ready now. I realized the consequences of my actions, and I definitely will be more alert while driving now.       How can I convince them this?

20090225120108AA9t8lW	Family & Relationships;Friends	I made my best friend a photoshopped magazine cover that says man of the year, do you think he would like it?	I know it would be very ego boosting for him to see man of the year and it's like Time magazine cover. He's my best friend and I thought it would be cool, would you like that?      Also if you have any suggestions on what to write on the cover it would be greatly appreciated, I had an idea something like this but not too sure how it sounds:      The world thought that he was just an ordinary man. Now you find out how this man surpassed every record known to mankind! How has this man changed everything? what makes him so special? continuation on center pages.      Thanks for all the help! :P

20090225120617AAPw7zi	Family & Relationships;Family	Sister-in-law problem....is it fair?	ok......here it is......      MY STORY: I'm 20 weeks pregnant and I also have a 20 month old at home, with no help. My mother in law used to live with us and she used to watch him while I got some stuff done around the house. Now shes over at my sister in laws house, helping her.      SISTER-IN-LAWS STORY: To begin with she has always had a problem with me ever since I got married to my husband (her brother-in-law). Shes 10 years older then I am, 38. She always used to compete with every single thing that I used to do....from home decorating to clothes and eating and everything. She has a 11 year old and she started treating her the same way I treat my son, whos 20 months old.    Ok so now here is the actual story......ever since I had my son, shes been wanting to have a baby. And for some reason she cant really have one naturally, so she tried IVF. The first treatment she had 2 embryo's inserted and after 5.5 months the babies passed away. We all helped her out around the house throughout the 5.5 months because she couldnt really do much. But she didnt appreciate anyone helping her out. She still had the same attitude towards everyone. Then she had another treatment with just one and this time her body didnt accept it at all. So now she had her 3rd treatment with 2 and the doctor told her to rest and she cant do anything around the house.    Now my mother in law wants me to go over to her house and cook for her, while she sits in her bed. Just to remind you all I have a 20 month old at home and I'm 5 months pregnant.    Is this fair for her to ask me to help even though she knows my situation? I have told her that I cant come over every single day to help, but she pretends not to understand. My mother in law cant do much because shes old, so that is why shes asking me to do it for her. I mean why dosent my sister in law get her mom to come and help?

20090226182620AAGO5YB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women, give me your inputs in regards of twisted relationship?	Me and BF have been together for 5 years now. We had our ups and downs where the down part usually is caused by his parents. His mother dislike me based on my look because I look totally different then her. She likes to give racist comments, being sarcastic of my thin body and fair skin. I mean I don't even care about that! She tried hurting me emotionally a couple times but failed so a couple months ago, she flew her mother and sister here to Canada and they pretty much ganged up on me.       The BF is the kind of guy who respects women and mostly his mother. So even if her actions are wrong, he couldn't say a word about it. I understand his position but i wish he would man up for me sometimes. Lately, things were in the crappiest stage because of his mother unknown plan, now BF is in his original country and i'm stuck with his child here in Canada. While he was there with his mother, knowing how crazy his mother is, he realized that this has got to stop. He said that he would back me up and that he chooses me. We're getting married sometimes soon when he fixed the problem his mother caused that makes him unable to come back here.       Now the problem is, he is planning to bring me and our daughter to his country because he has business running there. I'm happy but... If i go back there with him, his whole family is there + the mother 12 brother and sisters who would totally gang up on me and i have no family member there whatsoever.       WHAT should i do? Should i go with him and support him like what a wife suppose to do or should i leave him and find another guy who have SANE parents. I mean i know he said he would back me up but I am kind of traumatize and cant trust him fully. Because for the past 5 years, he always follow and scared of his mother. What should I do? I now finally able to have my own family, own house and all but the family OMG i seriously dont know how to deal with these kind of people. Any suggestion?

I don't formerly hang out with her. But when I see her we have good conversation, flirt, etc. The thing is that she's subtly touching me everytime I am near her. Things include.      -she noticed I worked out and insisted on feeling my back   -I walked by her one time and before we passed she put her hand and grazed my stomach, when I looked back she looked at me and smiled.   -we were at a bar for a Valentine's Event our other friend hosted (we didn't drink) and she grabbed my hand to dance, and after that she grabbed my hand because she wanted to take pictures with me in the photo booth.   -everytime she looks at me she smiles.      I know her enough to know that this isn't common behavior (probably hung out as a group about 10 times). Is she into me? What are signs you girls show that you like a guy?

But the asker asked girls if they would rather date the good looking dude who is a bit of an ****ole or the chubby guy who treats her like a king treats his queen etc.  If so many women would go with the chubby guy who is "sweet" and all, then why do I, an overweight male in his early twenties, get rejected all the time?  In the meantime, I see all sorts of douches with...admittingly good looking bodies...with girls all the time.  I mean why do girls' actions say something totally different from their words?  The girl says looks aren't important but yet she sticks with her man, the jockish dude with an ego problem.  Meanwhile chubby over here is left confused by it all...

Then I was born then my younger brother then sister. This whole thing makes me really uncomfortable when we talk about it because I've dealt with this since I was 11. I don't tell anyone I know so it doesn't bother me telling about it here. But ever since I was a kid my little sis or bro would talk about it and as I said it made me sad. Then one time my mom or dad (i forget) said "If she would have lived Natalie (me) probably wouldn't have been born." Its scary to think that I might not be here...    You can find a different question if this sounds stupid to you      I know this sounds dumb but I feel my parents wish she would have lived. I mean everything that do is connected. All their passwords, there are pictures of her in the bedroom (she was a dead baby in the pix though), and there is even a poem in the living room of their house all about it. Its like 2 pages long. If my baby wasn't sleeping right now I would cry.       Well thanks for reading anyways... I don't want this question deleted so I 'm gonna ask a question      Have you ever lived because someone else didn't?
20090225121118AApaUfO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any suggestions for me (10 points for helpful answer.)?	Chris is the guy I like.   We talk pretty frequently, about random, meaningless, things, and he is almost always the one to start the conversations. I dont think he "likes" me (as in has a crush on me - or likes me more than a friend) and I want him to "like" me, because I really like him. I think he's a funny and sweet guy, and I think he's cute in his own way. He is pretty social, and I am... with my close friends. But with new people I have trouble just letting go - and being me, i'm just so shy sometimes. At first with him it was hard to breath - let alone be me!Any suggestions about this? I would love some advice from someone who can help. Thanks.

Now this is just out of plain curiosity coming from an oprah show i watched and from conversations recently we had with men regarding sex, porn and masturbation.      Now many Men in these conversations say that they are married and some of these men have confessed they often go to corny sex websites when their wives are gone so they can pleasure themselves? is it because its exciting to do it alone and imagining another person, is it because you wish you could be that man? is it because your not getting what you want from your spouse? what is it and why? I as a person have always been intrigued by the male point of view especially mens opinions on how they view relationships sex and marriage, because womenn almost can never really get any real answer face to face.      Now here on a computer where you can remain annoynous i feel perhaps we can get the truth just in case we are missing something that you guys need, i would like to know!      Now i do understand many single and married men watch porn but doing it behind your partners back i dont understand whether it be magazines,pictures videos.. whats the truth behind it..      thanks

20090226184202AAaGwcJ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Asking twice now......?	my names ewelina and im sixteen. i went out peter for a year. he treated me so good. i didnt deserve him. he was perfect. we fell in love. he meant everything to me and i meant everything to him. he was my first serious boyfriend. we were together every day over the summer, but once school started up everything changed. i got sent to private school and he went to public. i met a guy named zach and we became friends and i eventually began to like him and he liked me so i broke up with peter for zach. for almost a month peter did everything he could to get back wtih me. and me, being the dumb b*tch that i am, just ignored him. so now, three months later im still going out with zach and zach loves me, but i don't love him. i only care about peter and i just want him back. he means everything to me and i just dont see myself happy without him. like i cry whenever i see him or anyone who's friends with him. i've quit cheerleading and now im like 105 pounds and stupid and its just like everythings wrong when im not with him. when i was with him i was so happy. i was like 96 pounds and i was doing my sports and getting straight a's and i just threw it all away. it was killing me so i told him everything. he said that i "really messed him up" and that he "couldn't stand being hurt again" but he "loved me and always will" so we were hooking up when me and zach were going out and then i thought that maybe if i had sex with peter he might take me back cause he always wanted me to but i never would so i did and then he didnt talk to me again until about two months later at a football game. he told me he was getting better grades, making new friends, and met someone new and that he loved her and that he would "kill me for her".   when he said that i could literally feel a knot forming in my chest. like it felt like somone grabbed my insides and just sucked all the air out. i told him that i was happy for him and i havent talked to him since, but im still with zach even tho i love peter.      i know im a horriable selfish person who doesnt deserve happiness but i dont just want him. i need him. hes my everything.    what should i do?
20090226183950AAcJ0zf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Tell me what you think... Am I over analyzing?	So my husband had a secretive myspace. He states he never met any of the girls nor did he cheat on me. Yes, I know the myspace is an emotionally cheating but I was more concerned with sexually. He swore he never cheated sexually for multiple reasons: Im pregnant and he wouldnt want to give me nor our child something, he stated condoms dont protect from diseases, he loves his family and knew thay would be something neither of us could overcome, and lastly he did the myspace more for attention and he knows if he cheated sexually he would never be able to love me the same. Anyways, he swore on everything his kids, his mother, everything, and I believe him. I told him I forgave him for his inappropriate behavior and very disrespectful messages to the women but then 2 weeks later I decided to bring it back up and tell him I wanted him to take a lie detector test. He declined and said he wasnt taking it not because he was lying but because when we first talked I said I forgave him, believed him, made him sware om his children and its still not good enough. He stated if I didnt believe him I never would and it would jus have to be one of those things where I have to take his word. He has NEVER me a reason to doubt him and this is why it eats at me all the time. He has always been against lying and cheating saying if your not happy people should just leave but he didn't. He did exactly what he hated, why??? URRRRR... anyways since then we have been incredible especially because at the time he opened it from the time he got caught 1 mth exactly, we argued almost everyday, no sex, barely spoke, he says he felt as if I didnt care anymore and wasnt attracted to him. He felt as if I grew to not love him anymore. I will say I acted different but I never was afraid of losing him, I took him for granted, I even forgot to kiss him when I came home like I always did. I never wanted sex and he did but it wasnt intentional I just forgot what I had all until it almost ended. He never blamed me but those were the reasons he gave when I asked why. He said he was a coward and he should have just told me but he states he is happy I found the paper because he has his wife and family back. I agree cause things were soo bad but it is eating me up to even think he possibly could have been w/ someone else sexually. I believe him but then I start wondering( I am sure with my pregnancy all these hormones arent helping) lol but when he reassures me it feels so real and I believe him but then when I ask him out the blue he answers me but I can tell he is tired of me bringing it up since I said we will move forward... Just to confirm I love my husband and I know he loves me.. I believe he made a mistake and forgiveness is key but the whole lie detector thing eats me up cause if theres nothing to hide you hide nothing yet on the other end he was willing to take it at first until I said I believed him and would let it go and move on then 2 weeks later bring it up and say hey even though you swore on everything, were sincere, and I told you I would move on I really didnt so I need the test now???????? I guess since I keep bringing it up woudnt he just give in and say fine lets do the test??? In his mind even with the test it wouldnt be good enough, I will still question im, and me needing a test means his word will never be good enough since he messed that up
20090225120617AA3B8tU	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Girls does it sound like she's just really busy?	Ive known this girl over a year... we've been dating for 2 months and things were going great. We had a nice V-day weekend together, but ever since then we haven't communicated as much and it just feels like she's distant. Despite this, around the middle of last week I asked her if she was doing okay with regards to me. She said she liked the way things are going and she's doing good, and shes just busy but stuff just feels differently.       She texted me monday and said she wants to hang out this week. We're going to hang out Friday, but I'm afraid she's going to break things off with me or something. I dont want to ask her or bug her about it because I don't want to seem too needy. Does it seem like she might want to get together to tell me she's lost interest in me? How would someone lose interest when nothings happened really since the last time I saw her? Does it seem like she's lost interest or is she probably just busy?

20090225120538AAC8oVS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over a guy who's too old for you?...?	I'm a Freshman, and he's a Senior. Let's call him Bob.   He was in one of my classes first semester, and we've talked once and a while, and we ALWAYS smile at each other in the halls, and he even helped me when I was balling my eyes out.      Well, today I found out that he has a girlfriend. I'm heartbroken, and I even shed a few tears. I don't know if I actually liked 'Bob' or if it was a silly crush/lust. He's a Senior, which means he's graduating in May, and then he's going to college in another state. So I definitely know that a relationship cannot start.      Help me out here, I don't know what to do, he's just so cute!      When we had a class together, we talked all the time, now it's once and a while.      I don't want to tell him because I think he'll think i'm weird or creepy.      He's an exchange student. He moved here last year from France, so he still had to take some Freshman classes that are mandatory to graduate.

My sister and I are best friends, she moved out of our small town to  the big city over a year ago so we keep in touch via phone and email. Since moving down there everytime i try to talk about problems that I am having or problems like fighting with parents, school, work ect, she never lets me finish because she says "she can't hear it because its too negitive" or she says that shes too stressed out with her own things that she can't deal with mine on top of it. But then, only hours later she will call me and whine and complain about her problems and i sit and help her with hers. I find this most difficult because she is one of a few people that I talk to who i usually tell everything to and its hard for me to not talk to her about it. What should i do in the future?

20090226183603AAuoji7	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I feel guilty?	I have 6 months until my wedding and am now wondering if I should feel guilty about something that happened back at the end of '07, around the time I got engaged.      My FH and I and I had been together for nearly two years, known each other as friends for much longer, when we got engaged. My FBIL's gf of a few months freaked because he and I are i our early to mid twenties, and she was closing in on 30. She insisted on getting engaged less than three weeks later, announced first, demanded to be married before us "kids" and her 30th bday, took our original date in August of last year and our venue, wanted our plans, etc. She was a nightmare.      Right after getting engaged I was flipping through a bridal magazine and found the dress, but it had no info, so it wasn't easy to track down. While I was searching, she left her folder (idential to mine by the way) open in the living room. I picked it up and noticed that in her dress section she had a picture of my dress choice.       Horrified, since I had just found it, I ordered it and she freaked out claiming that was the one she wanted. She got over it, and eneded up wearing a very unflattering dress and used the BM dresses my MOH and I originally planned on (when didn't tell her we had changed our minds, lol).       Should I feel guilty? I had told my FMIL about the dress, and my FSIL was constantly kissing her ***, so I'm sure that's the only reason she even found a picture of it. It was for a petite person, which I am, and they only had my size in stock. It was the dress I wanted from the very beginning, and had spent two months searching for...Am I worrying over nothing? I feel underhanded when that wasn't the intent.

20090226184355AAA5qJu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can he bring a video camera to the child exchange?	Hi I'm going through a divorce right now and my ex has visitation with our 2 year old daughter on Tuesday and Thursday 5pm to 8pm and every other weekend from Saturday 9am to Sunday 7pm. I have a Domestic Violence Protection Order against him and he's not allowed within 100yards of me. But because of the visitation we meet in a public place which is the Wal-mart lobby area to do the exchange and I am allowed to bring someone with me.      Thing is I asked my lawyer if I could bring a video camera or tape recorder to record him in case he says anything bad to me, or intimidating, or anything that doesn't have to do with our daughter and the child visitation. She told me no that video taping or recording any part of the exchange is illegal and I can get in serious trouble for it.      So today my ex and his father came to the exchange and waited in the lobby area. His father recorded me getting out of the car and walking all the way into the Wal-mart and continued to record me during the whole exchange and I advised him that any type of recording device is not allowed during the child exchange.      Am I right? What are the rules about recording devices in that situation?

20090226190932AAOYJiO	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I convince my parents to let me go to a Marilyn Manson concert?	I'm a 14 year old girl (freshman), and I really think I deserve to go. I've gotten all honor roll in all honors classes at one of the best schools in the state, I played field hockey, and I haven't gotten in trouble at all. However, I think they might think the concert is "dangerous" or "out of control," due to Marilyn's reputation. How can I ask my (fairly strict but still cool) parents to let me go, and convince them I'm responsible enough? I generally have a great relationship with them, but they can be too strict when on the subject of concerts or sleepovers, etc. I really, really, REALLY, want to go to this concert. I've loved MM for almost 3 years now. Any ideas? THANK YOU :D

Me and him have been togethor for over a year already, but our relationship is not normal at all. We struggled seeing eachother because my mom has disliked him i think because if his race. She is going by the sterotype and thinking he is not going to support me and all he wants is sex. That is not the case with him. He has a job and he supports me and takes care of me. I just want her too see that. I feel like she is cpming around but i am still worried about my grandparents. They are the same way especially my grandmother. Everytime she brings up some racial comment i disrespect her all the time and i hate to do that but it does offend me cause that is my boyfriend. How can i deal with this?

20090226180217AA1iPcn	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need help with a difficult situation with boarder/fiance's best friend?	My fiance's best friend rents a room from us. All was fine until September, when he was laid off. Long story, the point is we're coming into March now and he'd still rather play video games than find a job. He owes us well over a thousand dollars in past rent, and it's getting to where we're having a hard time keeping track. We talk to him pretty often to see how he's doing about finding a job, and there's always something that he's just waiting to hear on, etc. We got him an interview with our other boarder's job which was more or less guaranteed, but Verizon, which had been stringing him along for months called him back to repeat his first interview that he failed and he chose to go to that instead. Surprise, surprise, they never called him back. That was over a month ago, and he hasn't applied anywhere else since, despite our constant harassing him.       We're having a very hard time kicking him out because he has no family to turn to and he's been best friends with my fiance for over 10 years. He also helps us out since we have dogs and work full time, and he lets them out once a day, and pup sits when we're on vacation. But we could really use that money that he hasn't been paying us right about now.       Should we set a date? Say, tell him "If you don't have a job by March __, you need to move out?" If so, when would be appropriate? And how can we say it tactfully?

20090226172958AA0ipaV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Missing sex with an ex?	I dated my ex for 2 months and slept with each other after a month of dating. He was my first(I was 21) and I wanted to do it and get it over with and I was really attracted to him. We had a lot of complications during our relationship, I would usually dump him after he does something I don't like and he would talk me out of it or ask me to take him back. I said things to him I shouldn't have and he broke it off. After a month of broken up, we started talking again as friends. At first he tried the typical booty call and I yelled at him. I said I will never give in to what you want and until you get that to your head then we can have a platonic relationship. After I said that to him we've hanged out and it got to his head that i'll never be his booty call, we went hiking on Vday (he asked me) and asked me to go to a beach party this past weekend, but I couldn't go. Now I miss being intimate with him, the whole thing. Kissing, oral and having sex. I would never have sex with anyone unless were emotionally attached. I still have feelings for him, but I'm trying this friendship thing with him and I don't want to ruin it. I guess deep down I want him to make the first move, it seems like he still likes me. I'm pushing it to him that we're just friends now, so it doesn't look like i'm longing for him desperately and being clingy, but lately I've been horny for him. I don't know what to do, did anyone feel this way too? Its not like he gave me the best sex ever, I guess i miss the intimacy. He was the only I had sex with. Should I just tell him how i feel, wouldn't that push him away?      I don't know if he still likes me, i think he does.  I was looking at his past mood and status on myspace.  I saw after I talked to him on the phone (friday night) before we went hiking on Vday that he put "<3" "I'm out of it". During the whole conversation, he would flirt with me and he would stare at me when we went hiking.

20090226173205AAst5yf	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do i stand up for myself?	there are these 2 girls in my art class who always have something to say. I have to sit next to them cuz i was there partner :[ well they are SOOOO lame like forreal. they are the youngest and most immature girls in the class. everyone thinks so. Well they talk about EVERYONE forreal. and they are so lame. when one says something lame, the other laughs at it as if its the funniest things in the world. ITS SOOO STUPID. well, they talk about me and its like the dumbest things in the world. my drawing, how i talk?, my hair, WHICH PEOPLE COMPLIMENT ME LIKE EVERYDAY ON IT, but they laugh. they're like freaking 14 or 15 and i'm 17. When i make fun of them back, they dont laugh. so its like my jokes are "lame" cuz they don't laugh cuz their friends, you know? its like they help eachother out. I dont know anybody in that class and i'm stuck with them cuz we're in a group. they tease me like everday about stupid stuff. and one point it got on my nerves and i told them to "shut the **** up" really loudly and they started mocking. like little kids. I want to beat the crap out of them or like STEP ON THEIR ARTWORK and push them. i wont get into to much trouble then, but i dont really want to cuz i know they're young. But my insults aren't working cuz they help eachother out by not laughing. what can i do? just ignore them?       i dont like to ignore people. i'm more of the i'll let you play with me a few times, but if you go overboard i snap! but when i snap on them, they act like its stupid. and its not! THEY'RE LITTLE FREAKING ANNOYING KIDS THAT I WANT TO BE THE CRAP OUT OF. BUT I CANT CUZ I'LL GO IN JAIL OR SOMETHING.       how do i handle this

20090226192017AAelmDQ	Family & Relationships;Family	I need help with REVENGE!! Please, My sister is wrecking my life!?	Okay, my older sister is such a *****. My entire life she has stolen my money, clothes, and other items and has either never returned them, or returned them broken. F*ck her. Sorry.       Okay, so last year for christmas. I got this really nice Dell laptop, I customized it for both of us, we each got our own. About a month after christmas, I believe it was january 27th. I wen't to school, and she was alone home, shes a failure, does not go to college or high school. And she left hers at her boyfriends house, well when I got home she was in her room, and I went into my room, my laptop had a busted screen, and keys were missing off the keyboard and the actual laptop was busted itself. So, she was home alone and wrecked all of it. Thats just one thing. She has stolen my brand new jackets in the passed, and tore them up, and sprayed perfume on them, and then returned them 2 months later when I caught her. I have lent her like probably $200 in my entire life, mostly when I was younger because she said she would pay me back. But whatever. She digs threw my room like a rat, looking for stuff she wants when I am gone. Stealing everything. She is really lazy, and all she does is smoke pot with her boyfriend and come complain to me about her issues with her boyfriend. We had a deal for new cell phones, we would split the price for buy one get one free, and she said she had the money, her, my dad and I went to the sprint store. And she brought a quarter. WTF?!? So I ended up paying $100 for them, she said she would pay me back, but you guessed it, she thinks I forget about this stuff. She stole my money from christmas when I was 10 years old, I was saving up for an Ipod and I had finally gotten enough, when the next day, she went into my room dug through everything, and stole like around $80-100 dollars. I knew she took it because I had a $20 with a red mark, and I saw her with it the next day. I thought I lost my mouse for my laptop 3 weeks ago, and I peeked in her room, and she had it. But now it is cracked on the top. Sh is a pig. She stole my laptop charger for her laptop, and returned it with scratches on it. I had to buy myself a new laptop after the time she broke it, it took me 5 months of working for people, and saving up. Whenever we get into an argument she curses indfront of my little sister and runs away and slams the door over something like peanut butter. Last week, I confronted her about some money she owed me, I was extremely polite because she usually flips out and leaves so she doesn't have to pay it. Then she flipped out, I pointed some stuff out, and she did to. And she was cursing up a storm, and she hit my new laptops screen and its kind of wobbly now. WTF I dont diserve this. She has pretended she has had illnesses in the passed and put my parents into major debt, getting like 4 MRI's, going to the Emergency room like 4 times only to have the doctor say "sorry nothing is wrong". She thinks she is ADD, Hypoglysemic sorry for spelling, AD-HD, Hypermobile, and she also thinks somethings wrong with her joints, her eye vision, and pretty much everything else. But I WANT REVENGE!! She has stolen stuff out of my room way too many times, and I need help gettiing revenge. I skipped 99.999999% of the story because this is long.

20090226191901AASMLGQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I feel guilty that I was maybe a little too obvious about my crush on my friend?	I think i might have been a little too obvious in my crush on my guy friend. He's a senior, I'm a freshman. We're good friends, so I didn't expect him to think too much if I did something silly or a bit stupid, because he'd never minded before. But I think I might have been a little too obvious. Because, when my friend told me that she told him I liked him, she said that he had first asked her why I was following him. In truth, I don't believe I was ever following him. I just happened to run into him alot, since we go to the same school, and whenever we had extracurricular activities together, maybe I did try to hang around him, but not obsessively, only when he was with some of our other friends. I feel guilty about this now, because now he won't talk to me. He ignores me. And he told me he still felt awkward a few days ago. It's been about a few weeks now. Should I feel guilty? I don't believe I was being really over-obsessive, but I might not have been paying complete attention to my actions. But he was my friend, right? I could afford being a little silly with him. Should I feel guilty?

20090226182940AA3jj54	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should I do about my ex?	My girlfriend of 10 months broke up with me one day. We hadn't talked about it at all beforehand but she just said that she didnt feel things were working between us like they used to. She didnt want to try to fix and she hadnt told me how she felt there was a problem beforehand, so I was unaware. I still love her and want to be with her. Should I give up? Keep trying? Any tips or help to get her back?      I know she must still have some feelings for me at the least. I just dont know if I should try and risk getting pulled back in or just leave it, though I really do love her and would try to make things work.      I know she isnt on another guy or thinking about that at all. She feels that things like this cant just be fixed in a relationship, and I dont feel that way at all. Ive talked to her, and it seems like she loved us, but doesnt want to take back what she ended. I am not sure why she wouldnt try to give it another chance or talk about it first. Id be willing to try to fix it all between us. Any help? please
20090226182932AA3UgZH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Please offer your advice: Experience similar situation? Dislike "friends"?	I am quickly approaching the end of my high school chapter and have realized that though I have met plenty of fun friends, I cannot truly call anyone my "best friend." I've been quite alright with this fact for the past few years but, perhaps because I have changed, but I constantly notice how ignorant and immature my "friends" are.      I used to LOVE my friends. They were my everything; I switched out of a magnet school to go to my local high school because of them.   But as of today, I cannot, cannot stand them and I feel absolutely horrible that I can't just be happy.      For example, this girl I have known my entire life, whom everyone would expect me to refer to as my "best friend," is the biggest thorn in my life, ever. I used to LOVE her. Now, everyday, I notice how she constantly tries to outshine me (always checking my test scores to see if she did better, though with utmost humility: she NEVER does better, yet she checks every time anyways.) She yells out, "That's so gay!" to absolutely every situation and I just don't understand how a situation can be "homosexual." Her ignorance never ceases to amaze me: (these are the most irritating, imagine comments like this everyday) I tell her I was a plump baby, and she replies "What the hell?! That's so gross. I was skinny." or I tell her I went to Chinatown yesterday and she replies, "Oh my God. Asian people everywhere--that's DISGUSTING!" Keep in mind, please, that she is herself Asian. I discuss Judaism with her in AP World class and all she has to say is "Jewish people wear funny hats and have ugly curly sideburns." Seriously? What the hell.      Honestly, if we did not grow up together, I would never, ever be friends with this girl. But it's too late, I already am. There is absolutely no way to end our friendship because my hatred is one way and she would just not understand where I am coming from. I often correct her intolerant and ignorant comments by asking why she thinks that way but she replies with little more than "Oh, yeah, I guess you're right." No progress marked.      This is not to say that I hate all my friends. I adore some and get along with others who unfortunately act like 5-year-olds. We are extremely cordial towards each other, "friendly" and "friends," yet I secretly count down the days until graduation when I can leave them all behind.      Is this some sort of teenage angst I've never experienced before? Am I going crazy? I literally want to punch her in the face and I am probably the most pacifist person you will ever meet. Do I just tough it out and never talk to her ever again after Grad? I just need some advice to survive my final days. Thank you.

She keeps saying she will pay me back but she borrowed the money in October, its now February!!! I know shes been bankrupt before and she has horrible spending problems. She continually keeps buying things she doesn't need and she doesn't have the money for.  Im upset because she hasn't paid me back, but now I mostly just feel really betrayed that she would steal money from her niece. I know that she has no intention of giving the money back but I could really use it! I have no idea what to do. I told my grandma that she owed me money (my grandmas sort of my aunts supplier for extra cash) and all she said was "Oh". I don't know what to do now.

20090226172639AA4TPNm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can i get custody of my girls if i'm in the military?	Ok well I recently got out of the army I met my wife there. I was in 5 yrs we both disliked the army. we got pregnant and a week and a half later i deployed for a year. She deployed also 4 months later. Well she then left before me. So she was away from our daughter for 5 months. I saw my daughter 1 month 3 weeks out of the first year she was born. i got home in august. ----- Then everything was fine I thought, Let me first say this i love her. I love her so much My KIDS & MY WIFE mean more to me than life its self. We talked about having another child and i said i didn't want another child until finacially we were able too. But she took as me saying i never wanted another child from her. And then she thought she was losing me, the hole time i was thinking we were deeply in love with each other never knew she thought she was losing me. Well we also talked about the next deployment and i didn't want one of us togo. Because our oldest was going to be 2 when we left and i didn't want both of us to leave her at the same time. Well we decided that she gets out for a pregnancy.........WHAT??????? -----------Thats right after she got back from the deployment she stopped taking her birth control but told me she was taking it. So like I was saying she lied to me and got pregnant to keep from losing me. But I she still kept tellin me she took her birth control. So I believed her well she got out right around her 7 or 8 th month so she went straight to stay with her family so they could help her with the kids. I was deploying right before her delivery date and the doctor said she shouldn't be traveling in her 8 th month so she left right away. Well this time i deployed for 15 months this time and i wasn't there for her berth (beyond my control), but i got there that night and they were both soooo beautiful. I missed them so much i was there 2 weeks. I was dreding the deployment well I deployed right after i got back. When I returned I saw my youngest about 31/2 weeks of her life. Well we decided to move to where i was from because i had some land there we put a place on it and i got out of the army. We moved here well when i got home some old girl i new contacted me I havent seen this girl in 12 years but she and i started talking just friends well she started texting me some stuff and i didn't stop it. But I never not once thought about cheating on my wife. Well I never delete my texts ever and she found them so she automaticly thought i had slept with her then when i told her i never did and never wanted to she said i cheated on her mentally. I apolligized and said that i knew i would have to earn her trust back. Well less then a month after that stuff happened. And after she said she would try and work it out she leaves with our kids(VERY FAR AWAY). And she never tried and now I found out she has someone back were she took the kids. I know she has been seeing this guy a few days after they got there. He tells her he loves her and she has said it to him on something like face book or myspace. I have seen it but I know we can work out our marriage. But she won't talk to me about saving our marriage. --------- BUT I WANT TO KNOW CAN I GET PRIMARY COSTUDY IF IM IN THE MILITARY? and if i do deploy the kids would stay with there mother. ---- PLEASE SOMEONE GIVE ME ADVICE ------

20090226175639AAnTRCd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If my husband married me under an alias is our marriage legal?	My husband married me under a different name,ss#,and date of birth than he currently uses. (The first name in one identity is the middle name in the other-the last name is the same in both identities-the ss# is different-the year of birth is different,but the day and month are the same.) Although I have heard him provide anouther birthdate that differs by three days on occasion.     My husband goes by one identity, and has since I'v known him, He married me under the other-saying at the time of marriage the name he married me under is his legal name-the one he was born with.Because the names are similar I did not think much of it-I just thought he usualy went by his middle name.    Well-after our marriage I learned the two names have different ss#'s,dates of birth. I asked why he did this,and why he has two ss#'s.    He said it was because he did covert work for the government for over 20yrs-then he said about 30yrs ago  he legaly took the name of his brouther who died in ww2. He said reason for this was his covert work.     A few months ago I learned the name he married me under was not his birth name as he told me-the other identity is. His sisier said they never had a brouther.    I asked my husband about this -he said his sisier was "mabye in denial" about their brother existing. Then he clamed-up.    I'v seen pictures of my husbands extended family,but never seen a picture of this brother,and no one has ever mentioned him except husband. Husband now says name he married me under is his legal name w/true birth date.But it is not name he was born with- the name he uses now is.     I don't know what to think-should I worry about legality of my marriage-how does/can use of alias effect legality? When people change name legaly don't they keep the same ss#?

20090226184524AABBrEF	Family & Relationships;Family	How to tell parents that I am old enough to make my own decisions?	Well, I'm a senior in high school.  On the 18th, I turned 18.  Around the end of last semester, I had sub-par grades, and my parents told me that I could no longer play video games during the week.      I ended up easing my way into playing from 3:30 to around 4:30-5:00, and then doing homework up until my dad got home around 6:30.  After that, we'd have dinner and watch TV until about 8:00-8:30 when my dad goes upstairs.  Now, this is when I'd like to go downstairs and play games some more.      My parents aren't letting me though.  I've gotten my grades all up to A's and B's, but I'm still not allowed to.  Now, here's the part that gets me-  They say I can go up in my room and watch TV or go on my lap top or watch a movie.  What is that?!?  It seems like they just want me to have not as much fun as I can.      I am 18, a legal adult, and have good grades.  I have already been accepted to a local University, so that's out of the way as well.  Now, I dont understand why I cannot go and play games when I want.  I am majoring in programming and minoring in networking, and looking towards going into game design (yes, nerdy I know, but it's kinda just a way my life has been tilted towards.  And no, I'm not that nerdy kid that no one wants to talk to.  I'm class president and rather well liked.), so it seems that this is a good way to further my career in a way.      Another part is that a few friends and I are going down to Meadowlands, New Jersey for the 2009 Major League Gaming Pro Circuit tournament (again, yes, nerdy... I know.), and my parents know how excited we are, and how much money we've already invested in this ($240 a team ticket, gas to drive down from WV to NJ, $100 a night for hotel room for 3 nights, and the fact that we'll miss 2 days of school).      So, we'd like time to practice together.  Problem is, we've got time issues due to this limit my parents have on me.  Just playing on the weekend doesn't cut it.      So what I'm asking here is how can I break it to my parents that I want to do what I want, and that I see it unfair that I have to listen to what mommy and daddy have to say about what I can do and when at this age.      Since the University I am going to next year is close, it is just sensible to commute from home, which I will be doing my Freshman and Sophomore year.  I cannot stand the thought of my parents telling me when I can and cant do something when I'm in college.      Please help?  Also, any stories of your own would be greatly appreciated.

20090226184709AAK0mgN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friend is not successful in winning this particular girl's heart because he loves her so much .advice?	my best friend is a very rich italian boy!! He is probably one of the most good looking boys you will ever meet in your life!! he is very sweet ,caring and romantic and very intelligent guy (in a university iq test he scored an iq of 156 ) . He is very talented , plays the piano, speaks in 3 languages of russian , english and italian and studies as a part time student in music college as a singer !! all the girls love him....... but last summer he fell in love with a particular girl and this girl (even though she never rejects going out with him and spending time with him) keeps on breaking his heart !! everytime  he starts speaking about serious stuff and how much he loves her and would do anthing for her. she says sorry I don't feel the same way !! Ok I should be honest this girl is a very good girl aswell and she is very beautiful , but the only reason I can find that she doesnt love him is because my friend is acting so needy and saying extremely deep and romantic stuff to her and tells her that after her no girl is attractive for her anymore.every times he says these words to her , they don't see each other for a week or so and my friend for one week becomes suicidal and drinks all night and speaks about killing himself !! but then again they meet eachother !!! they had slept with eachother in the same bed for 5 times and they only had sex once  (and that one time she said things went so fast and it didn't mean anything) !!       I am worried about my friend !! I don't understand why this girl doesn't love the most talented , good looking, nice and romantic person I have met in m life !!       what can I do ??? What should I tell him ??? I don\t want to see him keep on getting heartbroken !!! I tell him you shouldn't be so needy , but this is what he tells me " listen , I am italian !! We have the art of seducing women and playing mind games with them , but when it gets to this girl , i feel like I have no skills and when I see her beautiful face , all I want to do is to tell her how special she is to me !!"
20090226184836AA7lxc3	Family & Relationships;Family	Can my mother collect child support from my sister?	I know the question is a little off, but I have been trying to find out as much information as possible. My sister has three kids, all under the age of seven years old. They all have different fathers that have refused to claim the kids as thier own. My sister has been in and out of jail for drug abuse and my mother was given temporary guardianship of the kids. Her third child was born with a long list of bad drugs in her blood. The hospital reported it and my niece was kept at the hospital for a month before my mother was able to get her. My sister was then placed in jail for a year and was just released a few months ago. I had just found out she is using drugs again and told my mother she likes the setup of the situation. She likes the fact that, in her own words, "my kids are taken care of and I can visit them all I want and still lead the life I want." My question or questions are is there any way to get my sister to start paying my mother for child support and possibly back child support? And is there anything my sister can do to get the kids back if my mom asks for payment?      Thanks to everyone who answers!

20090226191006AAHWb51	Family & Relationships;Family	Lack of communication with my mom?	I've been depressed since I was really little. I go to a really inexpensive counselor who legally can't counsel me if I'm suicidal, but right now I am. I won't rant about that, though. My mom doesn't understand what I'm going through, or doesn't care, or whatever. When I'm upset, which is a lot of the time, I go to my room. If someone knocks on the door, I say "go away", and when I do that, my mom, instead of being all sympathetic and "was your day stressful?" or "are you ok?", she actually stomps to her room and shouts "WHAT'S YOUR FREAKIN PROBLEM!!!" I wouldn't be angry at her before that, just sad about everything in my life, but after she shouts at me I DO get angry. So  just stay in my room fuming at her, as well as loathing myself, and wanting out of the world. it doesn't seem worth it to try to tell her how I feel, why can't she just act like a sympathetic mom instead of an immature teenager..which I am fully aware that I am. this is just an example of our conversations, but they pretty much are always like that to some effect.
20090226192311AA6pW99	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	MY girlfriend calls me "daddy" during sex and wants incest sex role play, but is this wrong?	Me and my new girlfriend have a lot of fun in the bedroom. Recently, we picked up a book on all kinds of Healthy Sex Play.  I told her that I enjoyed rape fantasies and she really liked it a lot.  Last night, while having sex, she called me "daddy", and I didnt think much of it, but this morning she told me that she wants to engage in role play where I am her step father and she is my step daughter.       I asked her where this came from and she said that she was molested by her step father and that now, after years of therapy, her therapist said that it was okay and healthy for her to "re-enact" the act.  She tells me that she felt shame only after she learned that is was wrong and prior to that, she actually enjoyed it.        Im not sure how to feel about this.  Im trying to see it as just another fantasy, but not sure how to respond and whether I should do it or not.  We are both in our 30's and both well educated. She is a lawyer and I am a professor. Point? we are well educated adults who enjoy sex but Im not sure how to feel about this. I want to be supportive, but I dont want to cause any harm.        PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND???

20090226192455AA9a1gc	Family & Relationships;Weddings	"I can't marry you just yet..."?	I don't mean to cross the bridge before I get there, but I have a feeling my boyfriend might propose to me. I'm a senior in college and we've only been seeing each other since this past summer. He's a local in the college town and I'm from a completely other state.       I'm happy with him and I could see myself marrying him someday--someday being the key word. He hasn't dating a whole lot. I could see him finding someone he liked and asking her to marry him (I'm referring to myself) once he's comfortable even if it is rather sudden. Since I'm from another state, I could also see him proposing to try to keep me around.       We've mentioned marriage but haven't talked much about it. Like I said, I could see myself marrying him someday. But after college I have several internships I have to do and traveling that I've had planned with family for years. My life is going to be busy the next few years and I want to get through that first before I commit to marriage. I'd be fine with dating, I just am not ready for marriage just yet.       How would you handle it if your significant other proposed to you and you didn't want to get married just yet? I don't want to sound like I'm rejecting him; more or less suggesting he holds on to the ring and ask again further down the road.  I'm afraid he'd do something like proposing after my graduation ceremony this May in front of friends and family.
