Dunque ora mi chiedo...qual'è la verità? Scientificamente parlando è una cosa impossibile rimanere incinta e partorire vergini, questo si sa per certo...quindi questi sacerdoti hanno ragione e la chiesa ha creato una storiella di contorno?

Questo è quello che propone il mio "amico" Cicciobizzo (il nome l'ho censurato) Freguja.   Dice inoltre che i gay e i trans non sono normali, che le donne sono inferiori agli uomini e che tutti i "menomati sessuali" dovrebbero essere rinchiusi in campi di concentramento.....      Voi cosa ne pensate?       Io reputo quest'idea imbecille, ogni uomo ha il diritto di essere come vuole senza che altri interferiscano nelle sue idee, almeno che non invadano quelle degli altri... facendo un esempio, lui ha scelto di essere un'idiota, altri hanno scelto di essere gay... che differenza c'é? A lui non fanno niente di male!!!

20081005122105AA5eGE9	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Upset about being called out for a racist comment?	I am upset about something that happened to me yesterday- and I want people's opinions about it- and whether I was wrong in some way.      I was walking by a vendor who was selling sports team onesies.  I am 7 months pregnant, and I thought it would be cute to get one with my husband's alma mater- whose colors are black and gold.   The onesies cost $28- which is pretty steep for baby clothes.  So I said to my friend.  "It's a good thing it's black so the stains don't show".        Just then, a (black) man who was walking behind us confronted me- "What are you talking about "BLACK?!"  I said I was talking about the jumper- and he got really aggressive rolling his eyes and said "Yeah, I'm SURE that's what you were talking about" very sarcastically.       Mind you, I'm less than 2 months away from giving birth, so as soon as he walked away, I started to cry.  I've never been called out for a racist comment before- and I can't believe what he thought I was talking about was racist.      Not that it matters, but I'm a huge Obama supporter, and I have several black family members (by marriage/birth).        What do you think?

20080715053931AAZtrJ2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	L'immacolata concezione di Maria o no?	L'IMMACOLATA CONCEZIONE   La chiesa cattolica afferma che Maria sarebbe nata senza peccato. Quest'idea, conosciuta come "immacolata concezione", comparve per la prima volta solo nell'anno 1160. Fu ufficializzata nel 1477 da Sisto IV, e fu poi portata alla ribalta nel 1854 da Pio IX.   Questa nuova dottrina, non proveniente dalla Bibbia, fu rifiutata dai più illustri padri della chiesa cattolica, i quali si schierarono contro di essa. Tra essi ricordiamo Tommaso d'Aquino, Eusebio, Ambrogio, Bonaventura, Bernardo, papa Leone I, papa Gelasio I, papa Gregorio Magno, papa Innocenzo III e papa Leone Magno. Anche i domenicani la combatterono, mentre il Concilio di Trento non volle pronunciarsi.   Sant'Eusebio (260-340 d.C.) ad esempio dichiarò: "Nessuno è esente dalla macchia del peccato originale, neanche la madre del Redentore del mondo. Gesù solo è esente dalla legge del peccato, benché nato da una donna sottoposta al peccato" (Eusebio, Emiss. in Orat. II de Nativ.).   ....

I mean there are much better animal groups to join than P.E.T.A.  It is a FACT that P.E.T.A. supports Terrorists. They support ALF. An extremist group that uses violence to make their point known. (ALF stands for animal liberation front)  Also they have stated that they would rather have no animal testing than a cure for AIDS!! That’s kind of messed up as well.        So I ask people here. How could anyone be so crazy enough to join this horrible group? Why do they do it? It makes NO sense.      10 points to the person who makes the most sense.

Se qualcuno vi chiedesse di motivare il vostro non credere in dio, cosa rispondereste? Che discorso fareste? Che citazioni fareste? Come ribattereste alle più comuni credenze religiose?   E per chi invece ci crede, come ribattereste alle opinioni degli atei? (è per sentire dei pareri contrari che arricchiscano il "dibattito" che ho chiesto anche a voi religiosi di partecipare; ma non voglio scatenare un'altra guerra answeriana credenti vs. atei, quindi sarebbe opportuno da parte di tutti esprimere le proprie opinioni con pacatezza e ragionevolezza, senza offendere nessuno, ok?)

I've heard a lot from some christians about homosexuals apparently choosing to trigger homosexual feelings in their brain (Yes they said that). Apparently, it's a choice. I'm straight and there's no possible way in the universe I could suddenly choose to like men, my sexuality is SECURE, if your sexuality is so insecure that it's like a choice for you, than that's YOU. But don't go around preaching your ignorant narrow-minded Fundie propaganda about gay being a choice.      You choose to have sex with men, you choose to put your socks on in the morning but you CANNOT choose to directly consciously change your sexuality.      Also I've heard "It IS a choice but not always a conscious one", if it wasn't conscious, than how the hell could it be a choice?

I Testimoni sconsigliano di frequentare le Università e sconsigliano di procurarsi( verbo geovista) una cultura superiore. C’e’ da aspettarsi che il Corpo Direttivo che dà queste istruzioni poi le metta in pratica per se stesso, quindi,  a rigor di logica, nessuno di loro dovrebbe essere un grecista raffinato o un filologo preparato. Di conseguenza nessuno dei partecipanti al comitatio di traduzione era laureato in greco antico o in lingua Ebraica. Come hanno fatto allora a fare la traduzione?  In una maniera molto semplice : l’hanno fatta lo stesso, in alcune parti sbagliando per ignoranza, in altre traducendo male volontariamente, in perfetta cattiva fede, per avvololare alcuni dei loro errori dottrinali e ad alcune delle loro eresie. Ma, si potrebbe rispondere: potevano mai pensare di non essere scoperti? Questa domanda rimane senza risposta e fa parte del mistero della mente “ geovista” .    J.R. Mantey, noto grecista, nominato dai Testimoni di Geova come consulente nella loro traduzione del Nuovo Mondo, alla domanda di un giornalista rispose: “  "Dopo aver studiato la loro erronea traduzione in centinaia di versetti del Nuovo testamento, si è chiarita in me la convinzione che quando la Scrittura era in disaccordo con i loro particolari insegnamenti, essi deliberatamente l’hanno tradotta in modo erroneo oppure hanno alterato il testo al punto tale che potrebbe sembrare che ci sia qualche apparente sostegno per le loro opinioni non scritturali (…). Ma ciò che è di gran lunga peggio, (...) si sono resi colpevoli di deliberato inganno: Ciò rende la loro traduzione detestabile"   Tralascio gli errori di traduzione più conosciuti come quelli di tradurre : “un dio” ( minuscolo ) invece di “Dio “, in Giovanni 1:1, per avvalorare la loro eresia che Gesù Cristo fosse un Dio minore della specie degli Dei dell’Olimpo Greco. Tralascio la loro incredibile sfrontatezza di aggiungere parole inesistenti alla Bibbia, travisando la parola del Signore, per avvolarare i loro falsi insegnamenti, come nel caso della parole “ altre” aggiunta a Colossesi 1:15-17 . Vado solo agli aspetti più ridicoli della loro traduzione. Loro chiamano : “ immeritata benignità “ la Grazia , chiamano “ proprietario maritale” il marito, la criniera del leone diventa “la barba” del leone ( mio nonno aveva la barba non i leoni).    Ed hanno il coraggio e la cattiva fede di andarsene in giro con una Bibbia Falsa per avvalorare le loro falsità : 2 volte  falsi !   E la fine del mondo ?   Le date della fine del mondo, secondo questi falsi profeti furono nell’ordine : il 1914 ( la battaglia di Armaghedon ) , il 1918,  il 1925 ( risorgeranno Abramo e Giacobbe e milioni di viventi non moriranno mai) , il 1935, il 1942, il 1975 ( scadenza dei 6000 anni dalla creazione del mondo , come se il mondo avesse solo 6000 anni), il 1986,  l’anno 2000 ( scadenza del secondo millennio).  Che dire di queste falsità? Si può dire una cosa sola, con le parole di Matteo 24:36 e Luca 21: 8 : “?In quanto a quel giorno e a quell'ora nessuno sa, né gli angeli dei cieli, né il Figlio, ma solo il Padre...?. ?Molti verranno, si presenteranno con il mio nome e diranno: ... "Il tempo è giunto". Voi però non ascoltateli e non seguiteli?.   Nella Svegliatevi! del 1/1/2006, p. 6, parlando dei tentativi falliti di prevedere il futuro che sono stati fatti da molti "esperti", viene detto quanto segue: ?Gli autori di queste previsioni probabilmente ora preferirebbero non avere aperto bocca. Un giornalista ha scritto; "Non c'è niente come il passare del tempo in grado di far apparire le persone intelligenti dei perfetti idioti"?. Parole, come si è visto, che si applicano perfettamente anche alle numerose previsioni erronee dei TdG. Solo che anche in questo caso vengono rivolte “agli altri...”   Rimane solo una cosa da fare alle persone per bene:  non seguire questi falsi  profeti di sventura che si presentano usando il nome falso di Geova per dire falsità leggendo la loro falsa Bibbia !

Im Winter ist es kalt und es besteht die Gefahr einer erk?ltung. Bei einer Erk?ltung braucht ein Mensch Vitamin C um dagegen anzuk?mpfen.

20070728162617AAl13Ly	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Qual é a forma correta do nome divino — Jeová, Iahweh ou Javé?	Ninguém hoje pode saber com certeza como era pronunciado originalmente em hebraico. Por que n?o? O hebraico bíblico era escrito originalmente apenas com consoantes, sem vogais. Quando a língua era de uso diário, os leitores proviam facilmente as devidas vogais. Com o tempo, porém, os judeus chegaram a ter a idéia supersticiosa de que era errado dizer em voz alta o nome pessoal de Deus, de modo que usavam express?es substitutas. Séculos mais tarde, os eruditos judeus desenvolveram um sistema de pontos para indicar que vogais usar ao se ler o hebraico antigo, mas puseram as vogais das express?es substitutas em volta das quatro consoantes que representam o nome divino. Assim, perdeu-se a pronúncia original do nome divino.      Muitos eruditos favorecem a grafia “Iahweh”, ou “Javé”, mas é incerta e há desacordo entre eles. Por outro lado, “Jeová” (ou “Jehovah”, na grafia antiga) é a forma desse nome que é mais prontamente reconhecida, pois tem sido usada por séculos em português.      J.?B. Rotherham, na Bíblia Enfatizada (em inglês) usou a forma Yahweh em todas as Escrituras Hebraicas. Entretanto, mais tarde, em Studies in the Psalms, usou a forma “Jehovah” (“Jeová”). Ele deu a seguinte explica??o: “JEHOVAH — O emprego desta forma inglesa do nome Memorial .?.?. na presente vers?o do Saltério n?o provém de qualquer dúvida quanto à pronúncia mais correta, como sendo Yahwéh; mas unicamente da evidência prática, pessoalmente selecionada, do desejo de se manter em contato com o ouvido e o olho públicos numa quest?o desta espécie, em que a coisa principal é o fácil reconhecimento do nome Divino tencionado.” —?(Londres, 1911), p.?29.      Após considerar várias pronúncias, o professor alem?o Gustav Friedrich Oehler concluiu: “Deste ponto em diante eu uso a palavra Jeová, porque, na verdade, este nome agora se tornou mais comum no nosso vocabulário, e n?o pode ser suplantado.” —?Theologie des Alten Testaments, segunda edi??o (Stuttgart, 1882), p. 143.      O jesuíta erudito Paul Joüon diz: “Nas nossas tradu??es, em vez da (hipotética) forma Yahweh, temos usado a forma Jéhovah .?.?. que é a forma literária convencional usada em francês.” —?Grammaire de l’hébreu biblique (Roma, 1923), nota ao pé da p. 49.      A maioria dos nomes muda até certo ponto quando passa de uma língua para outra. Jesus nasceu judeu, e seu nome era talvez pronunciado Ye·shú·a? em hebraico, mas os escritores inspirados das Escrituras crist?s n?o hesitaram em usar a forma grega do nome, I·e·soús. Na maioria dos outros idiomas, a pronúncia é ligeiramente diferente, mas usamos livremente a forma comum em nossa língua. O mesmo se dá com outros nomes bíblicos. Como podemos, pois, mostrar o devido respeito por Aquele a quem pertence o mais importante nome dentre todos? Seria por nunca dizermos ou escrevermos o seu nome por n?o sabermos exatamente como era pronunciado originalmente? Ou, antes, seria por usarmos a pronúncia e a grafia que s?o comuns no nosso idioma, ao passo que falamos bem Daquele a quem pertence o nome, bem como por nos comportarmos quais adoradores dele de um modo que lhe traga honra?
20070815220005AA6SsEY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Por que se desenvolveria uma doutrina assim?	A Trindade tem raízes pag?s. N?o é um ensino bíblico, mas foi adotada pela cristandade no quarto século. Contudo, muito antes disso, havia trindades na antiga Babil?nia, no antigo Egito e em outros lugares. A cristandade incorporou assim um conceito pag?o em seus ensinos. Isto foi instigado pelo imperador romano Constantino, que n?o se interessava pela verdade nesse assunto, mas sim em fortalecer seu império composto de pag?os e de crist?os apóstatas. Longe de ser produto de um ensino crist?o, a Trindade era evidência de que a cristandade apostatara dos ensinos de Cristo e em seu lugar adotara ensinos pag?os.    Por que se desenvolveria uma doutrina assim? Por certo, tornar confusos e misteriosos a Deus, a Seu Filho e a Seu espírito santo n?o serve aos interesses de Deus. E, ficarem confusas as pessoas n?o serve aos interesses delas. Ao contrário, quanto mais confusas ficarem a respeito de Deus e de seus propósitos, tanto melhor será para Satanás, o Diabo, o opositor de Deus, o ‘deus deste mundo’, que se empenha em ‘cegar a mente dos incrédulos’. (2 Coríntios 4:4) Visto que tal doutrina faz parecer que apenas os teólogos podem entender os ensinos bíblicos, isso convém também aos líderes religiosos da cristandade. Ajuda-os a manter o seu controle sobre o povo.
20070812072002AAlqSPH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jesus Cristo alertou que viria um tempo em que muitos lhe diriam?	“Senhor, Senhor, n?o profetizamos em teu nome e n?o expulsamos dem?nios em teu nome, e n?o fizemos muitas obras poderosas em teu nome?” N?o obstante, Jesus lhes diria: “Nunca vos conheci! Afastai-vos de mim, vós obreiros do que é contra a lei.” (Mateus 7:22,?23) Se n?o é ao espírito de Deus, a quem, ent?o, atribuir o aparente êxito deles em realizar “obras poderosas”?      Em alguns casos, parecem estar envolvidas fraudes flagrantes. Por exemplo, The Herald, um jornal de Zimbabwe, falou a respeito de três pessoas que, segundo alardeava certo famoso curandeiro, haviam sido curadas. O jornal exp?s isto como fraude: “Uma das crian?as ainda n?o é capaz de ouvir e tampouco de falar; outra crian?a nunca foi muda e tampouco surda; e, uma mulher, que era simplesmente surda, ainda n?o consegue ouvir.”      às vezes, parece que as curas pela fé exercem um efeito placebo sobre o padecente. Em outros casos — especialmente quando passa um longo período antes que a cura se manifeste — parece estar envolvido o mecanismo de cura natural do corpo. No livro A Ciência e o Paranormal (em inglês), o Dr.?William Nolen afirma que “cerca de 80 por cento dos pacientes que procuram [um médico ortodoxo] s?o portadores de doen?a autolimitada — isto é, doen?as das quais se recuperar?o espontaneamente”. Portanto, com a passagem do tempo, o curandeiro pode facilmente assumir o crédito pela cura.      Por fim, a Bíblia adverte que “o próprio Satanás persiste em transformar-se em anjo de luz”, na tentativa de enganar. (2?Coríntios 11:14) Em 2?Tessalonicenses 2:9,?10, Paulo explicou adicionalmente: “A presen?a daquele que é contra a lei é segundo a opera??o de Satanás, com toda obra poderosa, [‘toda a sorte de milagres’, A Bíblia de Jerusalém] e sinais e portentos mentirosos, e com todo engano injusto para com os que est?o perecendo.” Portanto, acautele-se! A cura pela fé muitas vezes envolve poderes demoníacos! “Eu n?o quero que vos torneis parceiros dos dem?nios”, advertiu Paulo. “N?o podeis estar bebendo o copo de Jeová e o copo de dem?nios.” —?1?Coríntios 10:20,?21.

(Mt 5:25) Reconcilia-te depressa com o teu adversário, enquanto está com ele a caminho, para que o adversário n?o te entregue ao juiz, o juiz ao oficial de justi?a, e te recolham à pris?o. Em verdade vos digo que de maneira nenhuma sairás dali enquanto n?o pagares o último centavo.      ... ou sugeriu darmos fim a ele?

20070613095645AAlS2ap	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A evolu??o contradiz a religi?o?	Na minha opini?o nem sempre. Certamente ela contradiz uma interpreta??o literal do primeiro capítulo do Gênesis, mas a evolu??o é um princípio científico, como a gravidade ou eletricidade. Para se testar cientificamente uma cren?a religiosa, a pessoa primeiro deve encontrar algum teste empírico que dê resultados diferentes dependendo se a cren?a é verdadeira ou falsa. Esses resultados devem ser preditos anteriormente, e n?o apontados depois dos fatos.       A maioria das cren?as religiosas n?o funciona desse jeito. A religi?o normalmente pressup?e um direcionamento inteligente atrás disso, e um ser inteligente nem sempre é preditível. Desde que os experimentos que julgam cren?as religiosas n?o podem ter resultados preditíveis, e podem dar diferentes resultados sob a mesma circunstancia, eles n?o est?o abertos para inquisi??o científica. Santo Agostinho condenou isso em _O Significado Literal do Gênesis.       Algumas cren?as religiosas fazem predi??es. Essas predi??es podem ser testadas. Se uma cren?a religiosa falhar no teste, é o teste que contradiz a cren?a religiosa. A teoria que faz a predi??o correta n?o deveria ter nada a dizer sobre o problema. Isso n?o significa que cientistas algumas vezes n?o cometem erros dizendo que uma teoria contradiga algo.      Gostaria de saber sua opini?o.

Mas referindo-se ao lugar aonde v?o os humanos quando morrem, a Bíblia usa a palavra "Seol" nas Escrituras hebraicas e "Hades" nas Escrituras Gregas. Que estas palavras significam a mesma coisa pode ser visto pelo exame do Salmo 16:10, onde ocorre o Seol. Alguns afirmam que o Hades é um lugar de tormento eterno. Mas deverá notar que Jesus Cristo esteve no Hades.Devemos crer que Deus atormentou a Cristo num "inferno" de fogo? Claro que n?o!Quando Jesus morreu, ele foi simplesmente para a sepultura.   Gênesis 37:35(leia) fala sobre Jacó, que estava lamentando seu querido filho José, pensando que tivesse sido morto. Agora pense um pouco. Era o Seol um lugar de tormento? Achava Jacó que seu filho José foi para tal lugar, afim de passar ali toda a eternidade, e queria ir para lá e encontrar-se com ele? Ou, em vez disso, Jacó pensava apenas que seu querido filho estava morto e na sepultura, e que ele próprio queria morrer?   Sim pessoas boas v?o para o Seol...

A maravilha da água terrestre n?o é o fato dela existir em abundancia, mas sim, que possua a capacidade de manter a vida; pois entre os bilh?es de astros que vasculhamos, a nossa espa?onave atual é o único local que mantêm a água no estado líquido; numa press?o atmosférica favorável à vida.

"      PORQUE O SENHOR DEUS DIZ   EM Apocalipse 21:8:   " Mas, quanto aos tímidos, e aos incrédulos, e aos abomináveis, e aos homicidas, e aos fornicários, e aos feiticeiros, e aos IDóLATRAS e a todos os mentirosos, a sua parte será no lago que arde com fogo e enxofre; o que é a segunda morte."        PORQUE O SENHOR DEUS DIZ   EM: Apocalipse 22:15:   " Ficar?o de fora os c?es e os feiticeiros, e os que se prostituem, e os homicidas, e os IDóLATRAS, e qualquer que ama e comete a mentira."

I feel that way a lot sometimes and I am NOT an open person. I tend to keep to myself so I don't hassle anyone with my problems no matter how much it hurts me and worries others. I feel like a weakling if I have to get help from others because it makes me feel cripple (not knowing all the details of everything that I am trying to do) like a baby again. That is why I sometime would rather handle stuff myself but I think that attitude breaks the hearts of so many people at times cuz they worry.

20090205171032AAtYWwL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Wouldn't it make more sense that God actually only heals people who have the wrong beliefs?	I'm genuinely trying to understand the things said by most Christians in this section. So, hear me out, please.      Uncle Bob and Aunt Linny both had cancer. Bob survives, Linny dies.      Why did Bob survive? Common Christian answer: Bob obviously trusted God, praise the Lord, it's a miracle.   Why did Linny die? Common Christian answer: Not God's fault, she didn't have enough faith.      If those two common Christian answers are true, then God is    A) telling Bob (the firm believer) that he's not welcome in Heaven yet.   B) telling Linny (who has too little faith and will thus burn in Hell) that she already can go to Hell.      Doesn't sound like something a loving God would do.       If you're healed from cancer, and you assume a god healed you, wouldn't it make more sense to assume that all your beliefs before you were healed, have always been wrong ?

20090205171450AAErKnT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Could someone please explain the irony of this situation?	Whenever there is a discussion about WWII, people talk about how some militant Europeans managed to defend themselves.  Typically, people look at the militant Europeans of WWII in a positive manner (since they fought against the Nazis).  There is no doubt that more people would have died in WWII had it not been for the resistance put up by militant Europeans.  However, I find it very ironic that militant pro-lifers do not receive the same level of recognition and honor.  Militant pro-lifers also put their lives on the line to kill modern-day Nazis that prey on the unborn.  Why is it that they are seen as evil people from a moral perspective?  Yes, their actions are illegal.  However, many Europeans also broke the law when they took up arms against the Nazis.  These situations expose the contradictory nature of the moral values of secular society.  I want to know why these two groups (militant Europeans and militant pro-lifers are treated so differently).

"i know but we don't have the money right now" mrs.rabbit left the room thinking about how she can get money to pay the car note. though the car note was one thing that needed to be paid the morgage and the utility bill was over due aswell. then it hit mrs.rabbit kill. she returned to the room."honey remember when we killed that crazy lady accross the street and got the insurance money?"    "um yes why" replied mr.rabbit   "well i was thinking that maybe we could kinda have some more fun"   mr.rabbit looked up with a snister grin on his face " lets do it".   that night around 12 a.m. mr.rabbit and his wife got into their volvo S40 "ok remember be very quiete when entering the home and be sure to leave no evidence"    "gotcha" the black volvo slowed to a hault outside the home of mr. and mrs fox. the foxes were good friends of the rabbits and were relatives considering their son was dating the the other. " we have 30 minutes so be quick" said mr. rabbit.    ok" the two snuck into the back door. the sound of smooth jazz was in the air as mr.fox and mrs fox were enjoying their evening dancing in the front room.

20090205174007AAW0ubw	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why is my husband so upset with his birthday gift?	It was my husband's 24th birthday last week.      A couple of weeks before his birthday, his truck started having engine problems and he expressed his desire to have a new truck for his birthday.      So, the day before his birthday, I sneaked out of the house to go on a little birthday errand. I went to our local Dodge dealership to look into purchasing a new Dodge Ram, where I nearly fainted when I saw the price of those things. Oh my goodness! I did not know they were THAT EXPENSIVE! I began to rethink buying him a new truck.      I left the dealership and headed to a make-up store, where I bought a couple of different kinds of make-up that I liked very much. I figured that he would like this gift very much, as he might like the look of this expensive make-up on me.      So anyway, I came back home and left it in my brand-new (and also very expensive) Ford Expedition. In the middle of the night, I snuck out of bed and to the garage. I retrieved the make-up, wrapped it up in a very nice, pink box with purple wrapping paper and a bright yellow bow, and put in on top of the good of his truck. As I finished and locked up for the night, I thought to myself, "OH, I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE TOMORROW!!! " I then went back to bed, hardly able to sleep, as I was very anxious.      Well, the next day finally came. He woke up to the smell of a hot waffle breakfast along with sausage, eggs, and an ice-cold cup of chocolate milk, his favorite. He seemed very pleased, saying, oh, you are the perfect wife!!! We then made out for 5 minutes. After breakfast, we took a very nice, hot shower together for about an hour. We took a trip to the beach later that day, and we spent some good time together. As the day ended, we headed back home. I, along with a little of his assistance, made him his absolute favorite meal, grilled steak grilled with honey-Bar-B-Q sauce. It was an incredible dinner, the 2 of us absolutely loved it. After dinner, we had a great 2 hours of sex without a condom (I think he got me pregnant).      Then, it was time to open presents. He had to go to the bathroom really fast, so I sneaked out to the garage really fast to make sure everything was ready. This was going to be perfect!      So, my husband was standing right beside me, and I said, ready to see you gift? He couldn't wait, and I led him to the garage. I could see the excitement building in his eyes, and he said to me, oh, you shouldn't have, honey!      I put my hands over his eyes as I took him into the garage. I turned him to the direction facing the gift, and said, "One... Two... THREE!!!"      I moved my hands and he just stood there, shocked. At first, I though he was excited, but then he just said, "Oh." He opened the present, and at first, I thought he really liked I had gotten him, but then he turned around and slapped me in the face really hard and said, "Why did you have to get my hopes up so high!?!?!?" He stomped his way back inside the house, and I later heard him crying in the bedroom.      He hasn't talked to me ever since, and he still wont talk to me. What did I do????????????

I'm a Hispanic and recently I got in a relationship with a classmate(we're both doing our Pre Med together) of mine. She's Asian from the OC and ever since then I've been getting awkward looks from hispanic girls and asian guys; eveytime we're together in public.      I don't understand why do girls give me that look of disgust? Are they suggesting I should only date hispanic girls which in my past experiences have thought that I'm not a true Mexican who drinks and party's every weekend.      I look more like a white guy but my parents are both Mexican and I grew up in a different culture and I guess. I enjoy things that seem boring to those hispanic girls, but not for white and asian girls.      I don't understand can someone explain why its so wrong to date girls from other races?      Plus I'm well recognized in my university for being a well educated and driven for a hispanic person among my peers. Does that have anything to do with it?
20090205165842AAUEL6F	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do u have a different relationships with the natural world, with "the wild"?	When European settlers first came to this continent, it was all "wild", from their point of view (although, from the point of view of the Native  Americans, it was simply home, Mother Earth). They left they hade to "tame" it, rid it of dangerous animals and of dangerous Indians and make it safe place for agriculture and for industry, for cities and towns. That process has pretty much been completed (expect for much of Alaska and certain small areas that have been set aside as "wilderness", protected from development and meant to be "forever wild"). The story of America is the story of the conquest of the wilderness, the conquest of the "wild". Once, not too long ago, the forest was right hthere, just beyond the edge of townm filled with danger. Now, we drive hoursto find anything that's not the city, the suburb, the shopping mall. We buy books and see films with "wild" in the title. We are, in a way, obsessed with the thing we've destroyed. Is it this way in your country?

If all animals exist in their present states the way they were designed by "God" and evolution didn't happen, then:      Why do human beings have the genes necessary to create fully functional tails (not talking about tailbones)?      If we didn't come from an ape-like ancestor, and as a species never had a tail (because we didn't evolve), then why throw this extra piece of completely useless genetic code in there?      Hardly seems "intelligently designed" to me.
20090205174548AAiunmT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christianity, free will, and homosexuality?	Ok, so this is based on what I have heard from Christians (as well as logic) and is minimally scientific for the purpose of...well...christians …      (note: this question assumes that an omniscient "God" and the concept of free will are not mutually exclusive)      God gave man free will. Free will means that man has the choice whether to be with god or forsake him.      The justification that is given against homosexuality is that, despite mounting evidence to the contrary (ie the reasonable justification of the homosexual trait as a trait that increases fertility in females), homosexuality is a choice by man to forsake god, and is therefore an abomination, as is stated in the bible.      Animals were not blessed with free will, so they go about their lives as they were created by god. Man was given dominion over all the animals of the planet because they do not possess free will.      Now:      Homosexuality has been proven to occur naturally in animals.    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15750604/       so, If      there are homosexual animals      and if      animals do not have free will      then      homosexuality in animals must be a naturally occurring phenomenon (In other words, they were made that way)      and if      homosexuality is a naturally occurring phenomenon in animals, the same must be true about human beings as per simple reasoning      A logical person would see that if one species has the "free will" trait and one does not and that both of the two species share the potential to carry a trait such as homosexuality,   Then homosexuality must arise independently of the "free will" trait         If Homosexuality is then naturally occurring in humans, it is not a choice that some humans make to turn their backs on god.      If homosexuality is not a choice made by homosexuals, then it is logical to assume that homosexuals are as much in “god's image” as heterosexuals, and deserve all the same rights as heterosexual couples.      Long story short, was "God's word"  misinterpreted, or is the bible not the word of "God" in the first place?

To keep it simple, a fight broke out today between a friend of mine and another person. The reason is completely stupid so I won't bother with it, but everyone is telling me that - because I know the whole story behind it and I saw everything that happened from when she got up from next to me at the lunch table to walk out until she ran up behind the girl and began the fight - I'm going to be called down to the office tomorrow. Here's the problem, although I cannot agree with my friend's actions the girl was a bxtch (even I have bad experiences with her). I personally think they should have talked it through but as you can see, she had different opinions. Well tomorrow when I'm called down to the office and they say "Who started the fight?"/"Who threw the first punch?" I don't know what to do. The girl began the fight in the long run, but my friend threw the first punch.

20090205171333AAOYxQa	Society & Culture;Languages	German Grammar, Nominative, Accusative, and Dative.?	Recently in my high school class where I am learning German, my teacher went over some essential german grammar, but never explained it too thoroughly.   Pretty much, the grammar of a word depends on the placement of that word in the sentence, and it's gender, from what I know.   For example: I would say "Ein rot Kleid" or english for "A red dress", the Rot is normal because it's the subject, but what happens if it's the Object? "Ich will ein rot(es?) Kleid" Right? (I want a red dress)   I'm confused, please explain for this type of thing.. There is much more that I can't think of at the spot, but here is one more type of thing I'm confused on:   "mein Hund is sehr nett" (My dog is very nice) and then "Ich schenke mein(en?) Hund ein(er?) blau(en?)  Blumen."      Please help, it's UNIVERSAL german grammar I can't comprehend, I just provided some examples so that you would know what I was talking about, but I'm totally blank of ALL german grammar currently! \   hilf mich bitte, vielen dank! :]

Well, apparently, she sent her boyfriend some pics of her in just a bra. Well, her boyfriend was like oh send me some more or whatever. So my cousin did and now he won't talk to her or something.      So my aunt called me to find out why my cousin was all upset. Like, my cousin is wayy too young for that stuff. But I also want her to be able to talk to me and stuff.      So yeah. Thanks.      Hugggs.      Mini Poll: Do you have a "loop?" [Group of people you can tell almost anything?]
20090203065414AAHyfb7	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why are there so many jerks online?	Do some people enjoy being mean to other's? This guy and I texted back and forth for one week, then we were supposed to meet at a tim hortons at 7:00. At 7:20 I call him and ask him how he's going he says he's diong well and he's on his way there. at 7:40, I ask him where he is and he says he's in another city 2 hours away from where we are supposed to meet. I told him i was going to a nightclub with my friends at 10:00 and he should meet me there. then at 10:00. he doesn't show up and I texst him again, no reply. It seems there are a lot of perverted people online who think that because they don't know you, they can treat you like crap. Like I told him that I waited 3 hours for him to show up and he should have had enough respect for me to tell me he was going to be late, and he doesn't respond. Did he do this on purpose because he was having a bad day and wanted to make someone else feel bad?

20090205184635AAifP4g	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: any of you ever see this before?	Chemistry in Hell      The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington chemistry midterm. The answer was so "profound" that the professor shared it with colleagues, which is why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.      Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?   Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law, (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:   First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.      Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:      1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.      2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.      So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Teresa Banyan during my Freshman year, "...that it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you.", and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then, #2 cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and will not freeze.      The student received the only "A" given.             source:       http://www.cwru.edu/med/microbio/artslab... 
20090205184049AA1TvOY	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Flirting Tips For Gay/Bi Guys?	Ok, first of all I'm a guy (bi) and I like this guy which sometimes...is kind of hard to read...like sometimes he stands a little feminine, and most of the time he stands like a straight guy. His laugh is a little high pitched, but his normal voice is deep. We're in theater...and um our teacher put us to drill these wood walls together for the show, and uh he told me to hold the other side while he was drilling, so while I was doing that, he put his hands over mine...and I quickly lifted up my hand (I don't know why). Again, it happened...and I left it there xD. But then in a couple of seconds he took his hand away.-_-. So yea, guys out there...how do you flirt with a guy without scaring him off? And how do you tell when he's flirting back with you? I'm not really good on the signs, and flirting tips...that's the whole point I'm asking this question xD. (The whole hand didn't make sense, let me rephrase it....since i was on one side, he was on the other...there was a huge gap on top, and he could reach on to the other side with his arm, and where I was pushing against the wood wall, he put his hands there. That's what I meant. But I don't know, maybe he was just trying to use some force too. I'm not saying he's gay/bi.....yet. I just want to know his personal life, since he gets along with chicks well, and with jocks...i just see him laughing at their jokes. Not really included in the conversation. So yea, flirting tips please? Girls you can answer too:D Thanks for reading!!!!

20090205182556AA0mgMZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians who don't believe in the Rapture, did you know that ...?	Darby was NOT the first theologian who wrote about this event?      Early church writer Iranaeus, who was a student of the Apostle John's favorite pupil, Polycarp, wrote in approximately 180 AD that:      "And therefore, when in the end [Matt. 24:14] the Church shall be suddenly caught up from this, it is said, 'There shall be tribulation such as has not been since the beginning, neither shall be.'  For this is the last contest of the righteous, in which, when they overcome they are crowned with incorruption."  (Against Heresies, Vol. 5, Chapt. XXIX, paragraph 1)      Also, the Shephard of Hermas, written in 110 AD, mentions the pre-Tribulational Rapture of the Church.  It is stated within the Muratorian Fragment that many early Christians accepted this prophecy as inspired.  It reads in part:      "Thou hast escaped a great tribulation because thou hast believed and, at the sight of such a huge beast, have not doubted. Go therefore, and declare to the elect of the Lord His mighty deeds, and say to them that this beast is a type of the Great Tribulation which is to come. If you, therefore, prepare yourselves and with your whole hearts turn to the Lord in repentance, then you shall be able to escape it."      Ephraim the Syrian, another early church writer, wrote this in 376 AD:      "We ought to understand thoroughly, there my brothers, what is imminent or overhanging. Already, there have been hungers and plagues, violent movements of nations and sins, which have been predicted by the Lord. Prepare ourselves for the meeting of the Lord so that He may draw us from confusion which overwhelms the world. Believe me, dearest brothers, the coming of the Lord is nigh. Believe me because the end of the world is at hand.      Because all saints and the elect of the Lord are gathered together before the Tribulation which is about to come, and are taken to the Lord in order that they may not see at anytime the confusion that overwhelms the world because of our sins. And so, brothers most dear to me, it is the eleventh hour and the end of this world comes to the harvest and [to the] angels’ hands awaiting the empire of the kingdom of our Lord."

It is the strengh and the frequency of those what gives us permission to call ourselves "gay".

20090205185122AAwsZTx	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What do I do about a teacher harassing me?	Okay so my English teacher is always picking on me and I never done anything to her. I think it's because of my race and my shyness that she takes advantage of. Because she would let the (not trying to be racist here but using examples) black students talk as loud and as long as they want and she won't even say anything. But when I talk to my friend for no longer than 5 seconds, I get yelled at. And no one can even hear me except for my friend and one classmate asked me why the teacher yelled at me because she didn't hear me say anything. So that's one proof that I don't talk as loud as the black students.      And okay, so, she let one of the black girls call her ugly and she didn't get mad but when I tell MY FRIEND (not my teacher) to stick up the finger (not the finger you're thinking about), the finger she stuck up to another student and she said she's going to report it to the guidance office.... ? Wth is that. She doesn't even know what I'm talking about and she thought I was talking about the middle finger.      Okay, and there's another time where I didn't complete my homework because I was confused by it. But she claims that I was being "LAZY" and just ignored me. So I spoked to my biology teacher about this and she said that I'm not lazy and don't let her get to me.      Idk, what to do because it seems like everyone likes this teacher except for me because they think that a RUDE teacher is considered "cool." I want to report her for what she's doing but then I'm scared that everyone would get mad at me if she gets fired or something.      This teacher is completely rude and she doesn't even act her own age. She would make up rules like "Don't say shut up" , "Don't say gey", "Don't be mean to other students" , "Respect what others have to say". Okay, so she says shut up and doesn't respect me. Um.... seems like she doesn't even follow her own rules....

20090205180300AA8YqJi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Proof of God existence scientifically?	As we know that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. We say that we have born on a particular day but if we take our body it is not actually created. Whatever Elements (Earth, water, fire, air and ether that is there in our body) from which the body is made is the manifestation of the Elements that was there in the universe. Hence, we have got a particular shape on our birth day. That’s all. In other words, there is nothing new that is created during creation of this universe. The elements (energies) that was existing before (not created at any point of time) has only emerged (just like when you boot a computer all the file systems will be mounted and the computer will start). Explaining the creation without the concept of God is equal to explaining the chicken-egg problem by saying that some process has started when the question of which process has invoked it to start is not answered. So the process that has started the creation should be exclusively independent. It should not be any effect and it must be the cause of all causes. Everything in this universe should be emerged from that energy. For example, on IBM PC compatibles, the first program to load is the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). The BIOS performs many tests and initialisations, then the BIOS boot loader begins. Its purpose is to load another boot loader! It selects a disk (or some other storage media) from which it loads a secondary boot loader. This boot loader will either load yet another boot loader somewhere else, or load enough of an Operating System to start running it. However, the first process that kicks the operating to load is not actually master boot record or partition sector or the other thing. It is the human mind that thinks of starting the computer and presses the start button. With this comparision, I think science is failing to find the root cuase of the creation. It is under illusion that the secondary cuases of this universe as the real cuase. There can be only one root cuase and it is independent of all cuases.    There is one more question for atheist to ponder. When science tells that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, they must also ponder whether you (your conscious or soul) is also not created. In Bhagavad-gita it is told that individual living entity is part and parcel of God’s spiritual (internal) energy and Material nature (constituted of three qualities or modes viz., sattva, rajas, and tamas) consisting of eight elements namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind intelligence and false ego, is His external energy. By a combination of the three modes of material nature and under the control of time there are activities and resultant reactions. Although this cannot be scientifically proved, it has to be realized. There are many things in life we have realize instead of finding a scientific explanation. For example, science tells that gravity is something that causes the attraction of particles of mass toward each other. Then what cuases the gravity to attract particles of mass toward each other? So this chain of questions keep going on. How can scientifically explain the creation when we are one of the causes of this creation? When we are one of the causes of this creation, we are not independent. When we are not independent we are affected by this creation and our thoughts are also affected. This is why science tells that there is no God (main cause of all causes) and secondary causes as the main causes. Science do not have any tool to confirm that they have reached the root cuase also. Because they themselves are one of the causes of this universe. They may cannot think/go beyond a certain cuase and has considered that final cuase as the real cuase.

The covers were pulled back on the bed and the exterminator never checked the covers and we never saw any rats.

North Carolina could soon be taxing people who download music, ring-tones, movies and software if a legislative committee gets its wish. The revenue laws study committee recommended tuesday to the full legislature that the state and local sales tax be applied to these relatively new electronic transactions. Current law generally doesn't require the tax on these products because they're not considered "tangible personal property" or a service. An analysis of the proposal says the state could collect $8 million and local governments almost $4 million next year if charges were made. The General Assembly reconvenes today.

How can you recruit a teenager into the Army, or be an officer that orders someone's child to their death?      Most soldiers are high school kids who were allowed to fall through the cracks, only to be seduced by our government with a sense of importance and pride. But in reality, they will be sent to war and come back mentally and physically broken. I pity them.

Ok, I've already done an essay on this but I'd like to know what you think on:  Pre-destination vs. Free Will    Questions to "provoke" thought. If you aren't a Christian, please don't answer, it can get annoying reading answer like "get evidence, oh can't find any? too bad!". Thanks    So:  If God is all-knowing(pre) then does that mean that everything is already decided and we don't have free will?  If God is all-knowing, does He change our actions when He doesn't like them?  If we have free will, does that mean God doesn't know everything?    I think its a little of both, He knows what will happen but still lets you make the choices. I don't think He changes our actions because He wants us to learn from our mistakes.
