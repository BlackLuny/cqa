When our brave soldiers were fighting in the two world wars , do you think if it started snowing, they would have said      "Thats it lads, we are staying in our trenches today!!"      Of course not!!!  People have just used it as an excuse!!!!      I have just read that a fifth of England's workforce didn't turn into work today.      I can though understand why schools shut needlessly, you can just see it now can't you, a kid falls on the way to school, and the school would be sued, that's what this country has become, a blame culture, and after talking to a teacher yesterday, that's why the schools that have shut ARE shut, nothing to do with anything else!!!      And yes, that is maybe why people never turned up for work, cause no one to have the kids      England is fast becoming a joke nation now, to much of a nanny state, and refering to my first comments, is that what my Grandad died for?????

20090203153133AAy5yfM	News & Events;Current Events	How do you think, those Germans who supported Hitler can be called "innocent victims of nazi crimes"?	At the elections of 1933, Hitler got 43% of votes of Germans.That was quite enough for his Nazi party to come to power and drag the world in the war which took 50 million lives.   That was also quite enough for the USA, Britain to drop on Germany 3000 MILLION TONS of bombs during the air strikes on German cities.   And it did not occur to anyone to try to initiate the legal persecution of Roosevelt or Churchill, let alone Stalin, neither during these strikes-nor after them, because it was Germany who attacked first London and Coventry, and the answer of the Allies was quite fair: you bomb our civilians? Try your own medicine. It also did not occur to anyone to start to call to send humanitarian aid to Germans (who suffered much more than some unknown “Palestinians”),for very simple reason; those  who supported the regime which put as its objective the extermination of people just because they were Jews, Russians or Gypsies and the subjugation of the world  must pay the price.   And it was also fair: the people must assume the responsibility for the Government they choose,and Germans never even tried to pretend that they were some innocent victims of nazi crimes.They assumed the responsibility, they without a word accepted the expulsion from the Sudetes and never even tried to raise the problem of “German refugees”  or to get the Sudetes back, they dies by dozens of thousands in concentration camps where they were placed in practically all the countries of the world,from Norway and France to Russia and Yugoslavia …To put it short, they knew they were all guilty of supporting Nazis and did not play the card of “innocent victims of Nazi regime”.      At the elections of 2005,Hamas got over 80% of votes of Arabs living in Gaza.It means that 80% of these arabs wholeheartedly supported the programme of Hamas the main clauses of which are is the extermination of Jews(first) ,all Non-Muslims(second) and the subjugation of the world to the medieval ideas of Islam. Since 2005,these Arabs demonstrated their total and absolute readiness to support Hamas in its attacks on Israeli civilians(over 80% of Gaza Arabs support them,and more than 6000 rockets were launched by Hamas on Israeli cities in just 3 years),they readily serve as human shield to Hamas” fighters”, they are happy to give them their homes from which these “fighters” shoot on Israeli soldiers, they did not mind even when Hamas leaders during the operation “Cast Lead” got out from their underground bunkers with their babies in hands using their bodies as a shield against Israeli attacks.      And now these arabs invite us to believe that they are “the innocent civilians” .   And what is the difference between Arabs of Hamas - and Germans of Hitler?

I really hope she doesn't get those kids. she's getting everything she deserves. Those kids deserve better.      Octuplet mom fears hospital may not release babies      OS ANGELES – Nadya Suleman apparently has bigger worries than taking care of her 14 children. Talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw says she may have to prove she can handle the load, or else have hospital officials withhold her newborn octuplets.      McGraw said the 33-year-old unemployed mother called him Tuesday, distraught that Kaiser Permanente officials told her they were concerned about the babies living at her home in suburban Los Angeles.      "What she is telling me is that unless and until she has a better living arrangement, that they are not likely to release the children to her," McGraw told the Los Angeles Times.      Suleman has taped two episodes of McGraw's "Dr. Phil" show. The first was scheduled to air Wednesday.      Suleman gave birth to the octuplets Jan. 26 in Kaiser's hospital in nearby Bellflower. She has six other children, lives in her mother's three-bedroom home in Whittier and relies on food stamps and disability income to provide for them. The home is under threat of foreclosure and could be sold at auction beginning May 5 because Suleman's mother is $23,225 behind in her mortgage payments, property records show.      Kaiser officials declined to comment on Suleman's case.      "Any conversations that the mother may or may not have had on this topic are private and we could not discuss them," said Kaiser spokesman Jim Anderson.      Social workers evaluate parents of very premature babies to determine what services the children and family may be entitled to, said Vicky Bermudez, a neonatal intensive care unit nurse at the Kaiser hospital in Roseville.      The octuplets were born nine weeks premature.      "If they feel there's a risk to a baby, they contact Child Protective Services and Child Protective Services would make a determination as to whether or not there's a reason for concern," Bermudez said.      A call to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services was not returned Tuesday night.      Suleman has not responded to repeated interview requests from The Associated Press. Her phone has been disconnected and she no longer has a publicist.      ___      Information from: Los Angeles Times,  http://www.latimes.com

As tragic as this accident is, in which 2 women lost their lives & a little girl was seriously injured, don't you think the time to point finger of blame was earlier and not after the artwork was open to the public?       i mean, why was it open to the public if it was not considered safe? Surely, there must have been Safety rule tests conducted before it was shown around the world. And if it was shown around the world, without any mishap, how can the artist now be held guilty now?       LONDON: A London artist who created a huge inflatable sculpture that killed two women after it broke its moorings and flew across a park was found guilty on Tuesday of breaking health and safety rules. Claire Furmedge, 38, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, and Elizabeth Collings, 68, from Seaham, died when they fell from the artwork "Dreamspace" in July 2006. At Newcastle Crown Court on Tuesday the creator of the artwork Maurice Agis, 77, of Bow, east London, was convicted of one charge of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. The jury will continue deliberating on Wednesday on two other counts of manslaughter by gross negligence.       The exhibit, which had been shown around the world, was half the size of a football pitch, five metres high, made out of plastic sheeting and had walls that changed colour as visitors wandered through its maze of corridors. Up to 30 people were inside the walk-in sculpture when it took off. A gust of wind blew it nine metres above the park in Chester-le-Street. In addition to the two fatalities, Rosie Wright, who was aged three at the time, was seriously injured.        http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World...

Would the government and society be more developed, more informed, and effective if the United States government did not restrict what and how much information we receive through the national news, local news, newspaper, radio, and internet.       I would like to know your thoughts. Is it bad? Is it good? What are some situation in which you think the government told too much or not enough. Is "The Media" the fourth branch of government?
