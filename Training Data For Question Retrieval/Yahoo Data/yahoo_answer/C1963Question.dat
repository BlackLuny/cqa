I bought a gadget (Rock Band Stage Kit) for my xbox 360 and the instructions say to plug into ANY USB port on the console. Then right underneath it, it then says "do NOT plug into USB hub.

The stage kit also has a controller on it, so I would think it would plug into one of the two USB's in the front, but again the picture shows it in the back.

20090223050501AA8bJCf	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Help needed with Laptop to Plasma using HDMI cable.?	Hi,       I watch films on my laptop a lot, they are all good quality and the laptop has a reasonable spec to it. I use VLC media player.       I have an excellent quality HMDI cable, which I hook the laptop up to my TV with. The tv is a 50" Plasma, and although playback of movies is usually fine, there is a line which runs down the screen intermittently while the film plays. It doesn't make things unwatchable, but I was wondering if anyone knows if this is something I could easily fix ( Perhaps with a different Media player?).       Any suggestions would be greatly received.       Thanks      Simon
