r7tzSp9caa	Free download MediaWidget to try. Hopefully, it might help you get things back. <a href="http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/MediaWidget.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/MediaWidg...</a><br>  <br>  It supports the following function:<br>  "iPod Recover/Rescue/Undelete: Ever had stuff mysteriously disappear from your iPod? Did an iTunes sync accidentally wipe your iPod clean? In a single step, you can rescue your iPod. Recover all of your music, videos, and more from your iPod, and get them back onto your PC automatically."<br>  <br>  Just give it a try. Best luck!|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	The only way to get them back is to download them again.|`|6P27whuGaa	That was a bad idea. If you delete the songs and videos on your computer the next time you sync your iPod, they be gone off your iPod too. You do need the songs on your computer to put them on your iPod, hopefully if you didn't empty your recycle bin and you can restore all them, but you emptied that also, tough luck, the music is gone forever of your harddrive and it's impossible to get them back.|`|44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	Nothing i'm sorry to say. If you already let the ipod be erased there is no going back. There is no program to restore them. Before you plugged it in to your computer and the stuff was still on your ipod you had an option. There are programs out there that rip from your ipod and put it on your computer. Most cost about 20 bucks but I'm sure there is a freeware by now. Anyways it takes several hours but that is the only way... once you've let the computer erase your ipod you are out of luck I'm sorry to say... <br>  <br>  I really feel for you. That sucks. I learned that when I first got an ipod 5 years ago. Since then I have everything backed up on two computers and an external. It's never fun to go and find all those songs again online. <br>  <br>  The only nice thing is if you bought any of it from Itunes you can go and get those songs and videos back .... but those are the only I'm sorry to say.

aaMo4KIsaa	1) Sony KDL 46XBR8<br>  2) Samsung  LN46A950|`|mHyP6Ofwaa	The Best TV of all time is the Samsung LN52A650. I've had this TV since very early March. I've watched HD, SD and Blu-Ray and can not find a flaw. The 650 handles motion extremely well to where blurring and other artifacts are virtually non-existent. The AMP is a very cool feature that brings a realism to film making it seem more life-like, or as if it were originally shot on HD Video. Some have said this gives off a "soap opera" effect. I can see that description, but to me it makes film based DVD's and movies look more like your watching a real-life play, viewing it through a window. It's a very cool effect! <br>  <br>  I understand people's concern's with the glossy screens found on plasma and some LCD's. This screen is slightly less reflective than Samsung's 71 series but can still be a problem for some. It would be nice if there was an easy solution for this but there's not. Sony and other makers use a matte type of screen that certainly helps or eliminates the problem but introduces other negatives. I find colors and blacks just don't "pop" on matte screens and tend to wash out more for off-angle viewing. The 650 has a picture with great depth and color from any angle, greatly adding to the immersion effect. <br>  <br>  Much talk has been about the TOC bezel. I think Samsung has hit it out of the park with this. I absolutely love the red. I think it adds just a touch of class. It sets this tv apart from all others(though the picture quality already does this) while still being very subtle and retaining the ability to blend in with any decor. Most people who've come to my home do not even notice the red until I point it out. I'm a little tired of every set looking the same with either a piano black bezel or flat black. This is a very welcome change. <br>  <br>  I like many other suffered the shut-off issue. As has been mentioned it appears Samsung has fixed the issue with a firmware update. I've updated the FW and so far so good. It was annoying but not a huge deal to me. Samsung should be commended for how quickly they addressed the issue. I received several calls from upper level officials that were very concerned with my problem. I've never had this level of service from any other manufacturer. Well done Samsung! A side effect of the FW update is that the AMP processing received a boost. Before the FW update I usually had AMP on low at all times and would occasionally put it on High. Now, I still use it at the low setting most times but will put it on Medium occasionally, and find the High setting a bit much for me. I can put it on High without most of the annoying artifacts people have described the 71 series has, which is nice, nut the actual effect is bit much for me. <br>  <br>  Overall, this is best the LCD on the market. I can't see Sony or any of the other manufactures making a better TV this year. They may match it perhaps, but certainly won't surpass it. For those that were on the fence waiting to buy until the shut-off issue was fixed, your wait is over. Buy with complete confidence and enjoy one of the best TV's out there!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413DF8?ie=UTF8&tag=burtoa-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=B001413DF8" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001413...</a>

You can buy the phone outright, but won't be able to get any service or activate it until the deposit is paid.|`|bqdDRCeDaa	Unfortunately not. Carriers usually keep the records of a credit check for about 6 months. So if you want it now your going to have to pay the $500. If you want to wait 6-12 months and see if the deposit has gone down than you could do that, but until then you are stuck.

Higher prestige means that a flamethrower will be rewarded or its a cheat.. or hack...|`|3zPZOz18aa	Its a glitch, btw people can use all the perks before they unlock them with this glitch not just the flamethrower.You need two profiles. 1 profile has to be on level 65(only if you want the flamethrower), (lower if you want others) and your second profile has to be at least on level 4 (custom classes). In profile one go to custom slot ---1--- and put the perks you want on the other profile in this class. Next go to your other profile , enter custom slot 1 , and look in the perk slots. The perks you had in the other custom slot are now unlocked in this profile. As easy as !! But please don't just run round on level 30 or whatever with the flamethrower . People will hate you!! :-( But the wont Know if your using other ones !!! :-). You can repeat the above steps over and over until everything is unlocked in your new profile! Good Luck !

I always drop my friends and it works fine.. but if it does break, Verizon will sometimes give you a new phone for free or on a major discount- they have for me and my family a few times.. and we have no "special connections or anything.<br>  <br>  All the new Verizon phones hold about the same amount of txts (up to 200) maybe less if there are picture messages too. But, you can always clear you inbox/sent/draft and lock the important messages so they don't erase. <br>  <br>  Like i said... I have the Voyager and I have friends who have the enV and they are both really good phones is the Glyde does not work out. Hope I was of some help  :)|`|C527g3ojaa	Don't get it the touch screen is not that good on. look into the krave phone it is great i have one myself.|`|LkOcJRRWaa	never heard of it<br>  google it<br>  ok<br>  insurance<br>  unlimited text packages $9.99
Sg93t3Nraa	unfortunately they're not compatible, the ic902 has a sim card?<br>  u can try putting a boost simcard @your own risk of locking them, I DONT SUGGEST THAT AT ALL.

JqEPAz1jaa	The cheapest one possible. HDMI is a digital signal. With a digital signal, you either get it or you don't. There is no quality loss depending on what kind of cable you get. Like how US television is switching from an analog signal to a digital one. With the old analog signal, you have quality loss depending on where you are located and how good your equipment is. Not so with a digital signal, because you either get it or you don't. HD radio is another example. With standard radio there is quality loss depending on the same factors. With HD radio, you either get it or you don't.|`|x9lxPg35aa	Make your choice :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.memorybits.co.uk/search_result.php?keywords=hdmi+ps3+cable&x=0&y=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.memorybits.co.uk/search_resul...</a>|`|Id9ce5kPaa	Get the cheapest possible one.  There is no difference that you can tell with a $100 hdmi cord and a $10 hdmi.  It's just brand and prettiness.

With analog cables it is a good idea to get thick, expensive cables to shield noise from interfering with the signal and prevent a loss of the signal over a distance.<br>  <br>  With a digital connection, you don't have to worry much about any loss of a signal or the RF (analog) interference.  If the signal gets there, it gets there and any connection that gets there will work just as well as any other because it deals with 0's and 1's.  Just look around online for the cheapest cable, I found one for less than $5 and it works perfectly.|`|nYgUfUd7aa	The cheapest one you can find.  The digital data will transfer just as well with an $8.00 cable as it will with a $90.00 cable.  The only difference between the two is that the $8.00 one will show that you aren't a huge sucker...|`|fCl7qwD2aa	Some people argue that the expensive ones are the best, but they have done tests and the cheap ones are just as good as the expensive ones, so i would go for a mid range one that's like ￡20, if ur UK or $45 in US.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	hdmi is very efficient so there is very little to no data loss.  now if you were using a 500ft cable you may notice a difference, but really why would you have your ps3 that far away anyway.

b71d39001e1f7b83a6a4e79306f3a983aa	Depends on where your located<br>  <br>  The 141MHz band in the US is used by the military. In Canada alot of 141MHz is used by public safety. In other countries it may be used for alot of other users.<br>  <br>  462MHz band again, depends on where your at. In the US part of the 462 band is used for land mobile user (Business) part is used for paging and the rest is used for the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS Part 95 aka Old Class A CB) and the Family Radio Service (FRS, unlicensed).<br>  <br>  If your hearing a cordless phone in the 140 & 462 MHz area this is caused by a combo of various electronic factors like poor shielding and filtering of harmonics from the cordless phone, poor filtering and design of the scanner. If this is an import phone there could be a reason its on the 140 & 462 MHz channels as in some areas those are legal cordless phone channels, not in the US though. If these interferes with anything of the military's in the 141MHz area you can probably expect a visit to shut down the unit, they don't tend to take interference to their systems lightly.

If you order through the Apple Store it is sent to you with your name or whatever you want engraved on it. It is just a little bit more than the lower grade one but well worth it.|`|DSLMxNN0aa	I have the Sandisk sansa fuze 4gb mp3 player and I like it.  It has FM radio and you can put on music and video.  It works well.  I bought it for $79.99 at best buy.  It was one of the best mp3 players last year out beating some ipods.  But if you want to use itunes it doesn't let you because it's not apple, but I've downloaded music from amazon and rhapsody and it works.|`|QlzFoBS3aa	I understand the dilemma.  I have an 80g ipod classic.  The 8g touch does not have hardly any room for storage, although you can get on the internet in Wifi hot spots.<br>  I don't really care about the radio bit. But on my classic I have several thousand songs and several dozen movies and TV show episodes and several hundred HI-res photos, and I still have over 25 gig of free space!  As small as the screen is, it have very good resolution too!!!!<br>  I would go with the Classic first, and then think about getting that touch ipod as a 2nd player, you know the 1st generation touch ipods from 2007 are really a lot cheaper since falls of 2008 models came out, or you can also save on getting a refurbish touch, and have the best of both worlds!
TbTO5SXlaa	First, you must always remember this: "It isn't the camera, its the photographer."<br>  <br>  A person knowledgeable about light and composition and f-stops and ISO and shutter speeds will use either camera to make good pictures. A person who lacks that knowledge and skill will use either camera to make bad pictures.<br>  <br>  "Pictures are not taken, they are made." Ansel Adams.<br>  <br>  I have never owned a camera that took great pictures.<br>  <br>  I have never owned a camera that took lousy pictures.<br>  <br>  I have used a camera to make some great pictures and I have used a camera to make some lousy pictures. The camera doesn't get the credit for the great picture and it doesn't get the blame for the lousy picture. I get both.<br>  <br>  Since you're in the market, I suggest expanding your new camera search to include Sony and Pentax.<br>  <br>  ********** EDIT *********<br>  <br>  I got a good laugh from the comment "... most if not all professional photographers use Nikon or Canon ... " by tRuThBtOID. That is probably news to those professionals using a Hasselblad or Leica or Mamiya or Olympus or Fuji or an 8x10 view camera. Since they don't use a Nikon or Canon I guess they really aren't professional photographers.|`|a9398092706b68241341a0195af9943eaa	In point and shoot cameras go with Canon. DSLRS, Nikon has slight advantage.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Both are better. This is the great debate in photography and nobody is right. They both make fabulous cameras that are used by professionals all over the world. The one that is best is the one that you are most comfortable using. The one that fits in your hands best and has the controls where they make sense to you.<br>  <br>  Some will say that Nikon has the edge right now in there top pro models and they might but by next year it will be Canon then it will be Nikon again and so on. Find what you like and stick with it.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	I prefer Nikon|`|WseLyvSpaa	It depends on what the price point is.  At the top of the ranges, the Nikons may have the edge.  At the medium range, the Canons.  At the bottom rung, some even prefer Samsung or Casio.|`|Ap8tyiUlaa	Canon, jsut cause|`|f9No4eRBaa	Both are top notch cameras and if you choose either one, you cannot go wrong.  It's a matter of finance, personal choice, likes and dislikes. <br>  <br>  I have used both, like both and my present SLR is a Nikon D90.  I also loved my Canon Rebel but the Nikon did more for me (personal choice).  I found that the Nikon lens prices for the amateur level is higher than Canon lenses. This kicks back at affordability. You can buy a Canon digital SLR with two lenses for less than a similar Nikon, body only.<br>  <br>  You will be happy with whatever you choose.|`|7qoyVAIjaa	I recently bought my first DSLR. I ended up with a Nikon D90 but I also almost bought a Canon 50D instead. Here is what I learned in the 3 months of shopping I did...<br>  The camera best for you is the one that most closely matches your needs. It's true. Do you need faster shutter(more frames per second) for sports/action shots? Do you need better low light(ISO) performance?<br>  I could go on and on. The truth is, if you are willing to spend a fair amount of money either brand camera will be a good one.<br>  You will also find "Cononites" who swear Nikons are junk. And the Nikonians will swear Canons are no good. <br>  I say consider your needs and what features you are looking for. Go to the store and pick up both cameras. Feel which one is a better fit for your hands. This can make a big impact on your decision.<br>  Whichever one you choose, just pull the trigger and don't look back. Second guessing your choice will just spoil the fun.<br>  As I said, either one will make you a happy camper. Have fun!|`|UXQ22qeVaa	no matter how many reviews you do, and ho many time you read the manuals before you buy... you will always discover something you like from other camera and something you like on your camera over other after you star using it.|`|AA11539218	You can't go wrong with either of those brands....Most, if not all, professional photographers use either Canon or Nikon products. Both will take amazing shots and both are made with quality components and will last several years.|`|0PHR8cICaa	There is not much to choose between the two.  I decided on Nikon because (1) I liked the appearance better and (2) they've had experience of making photographic equipment for longer than Canon has.|`|MFjbr8t4aa	CANON|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	Nikon.  My old canon didn't take pictures very well but my nikon is great.  It has very clear images.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	that would be the mac or pc debate.  I've used both and got great results with both.  I could go either way with em.|`|yE1TnI6Vaa	It isn't really between Canon or Nikon, but rather which kind of either you were to get. Personally, I like Canon because its what I started on, but both brands have advantages.<br>  <br>  I would suggest doing a little research on the different kinds both of them make, and then decided on which would be the best for YOU.|`|1d4e0e45453512158e7c2dc21d0bb0c9aa	There are diehard Canon fans and then there are diehard Nikon fans.<br>  I work selling cameras and i have noticed a difference. Nikon pictures come out somewhat darker then Canons, Canon makes more vibrant pictures, and the colors look better to me.

f1lpdiNEaa	T Mobile no longer produce Sidekicks, they stopped last year (the latest model is a 'Sidekick Slide') The only way to get one at the moment is second hand.<br>  <br>  I got mine new and unused last year from Ebay, it was someone's unwanted upgrade. It cost ￡200. You have to use a T-Mobile contract SIM (not pay as you go) with it or else it won't work and you can't get access to many of the features. This is also the case if the ohone is unlocked so I wouldn't buy one of those either. I'm sure by now you can find one much cheaper than what I paid.<br>  <br>  If you get one from ebay I would advise getting one from a UK seller.

xG5ZlJDqaa	It does. It gives you that extra reach in the wide end to fit in that shot you would otherwise won't be able to get at all. But my experience with "add-ons" is that they introduce a lot of chromatic abberation and distortion, so they're not really recommended if you are serious with wide angle photography. The sigma 10-20mm is a good, cost-effective way to get into wide angle photography.|`|A1iyvh29aa	Hi Lana<br>  You are right that wide angle lenses are expensive.  I bought the Nikon f/4G ED IF Autofocus DX Nikkor Zoom Lens.  They are running around $650 right now used.  I know this sounds like a lot compared to the wide angle attachments however you will not regret it for two reasons.  One the wide angle attachments are going to give you a wider view but it will have more distortion and fuzziness on the edge of the pictures.  Second if you buy the actual lens you can always resell it if you need to.  The lens is going to hold value much longer and better than the attachment.  If you can go for this lens.  You will not be disappointed.  If you would like more information on the lens I have a review with a few pictures taken with it up on my website in my whats new section, and also at this link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.TysonJamesPhotography.com/Site/Nikon_12-24mm_f_4G_ED_IF_Autofocus_DX_Nikkor_Zoom_Lens.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.TysonJamesPhotography.com/Sit...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.TysonJamesPhotography.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.TysonJamesPhotography.com</a> <br>  <br>  Good luck in your search. <br>  Wide angle is very fun!|`|pZGLhV2Waa	I wouldn't use one but they will work. For $21 what are you wasting though. If you can't live with the results throw it out and save your money for a real wide angle lens. If you can live with the results then you got off pretty cheap.
sYZ6IPWjaa	I agree with HVS. You need to track your usage. I routinely only use between 40MB-50MB per month with my usage. 500MB sounds like more than enough if your usage patterns are around 25-30MB per month.|`|So1T9DKPaa	Check your usage on the your carrier's website.  If you use only 25mb, that's barely anything....so 500mb is plenty for you.  Unless you using 25mb a day then you'll be over the 500mb limit.

2stIKefLaa	yea 99 is the lowest price.<br>  it recently dropped from 199, because verizon is having a half off sale because they just bought alltel and want to sell off their smartphone (mainly blackberry) overstock. You may be able to find it cheaper else where but i highly doubt it because it is a new phone for verizon and anyone who bought the verizon version their contract wouldn't be up yet. <br>  PS you do have to buy the data plan so it is a more expensive plan so add $30 to whatever else you may want.<br>  <br>  Not to critique your age but i don't think you would need all the functions.You may have better luck with the LG dare. it's a touch screen. although it's more expensive on verizon's web page you may have better luck buying one via ebay.<br>  Or the Motorola Krave also a touch screen  <br>  I always shop Wirefly.com they are good dealer and give very reasonable prices i have yet to find a site that beats them. Except a Lucky thread on ebay.
mVX79DdNaa	Yes you can.<br>  basically you need an ether net cable you can run from your computer into the back of your xbox. i don't remember exactly what you do but go onto youtube.com and type in xbox live via laptop and you should find some videos guiding you through it.|`|md6eV0WVaa	Yes, you can.<br>  Follow these steps, please note that you must have an active Xbox Live Account<br>  <br>  1) If you don't already have one, you need an active Xbox Live Account<br>  2) Purchase a Crossover Cable, they're cheap and very similar to Ethernet Cables.<br>  3) Turn on laptop, connect to your wireless.<br>  4) Plug the crossover cable into both the Xbox & the Laptop<br>  5) Open up Network Connections, select the new LAN which appears as well as your active connection, right click and select "Bridge Connections"<br>  6) Your Xbox will then have access to the internet.<br>  7) Please note that while bridged, your laptop will most likely not be able to use the internet, when you're done on Xbox, unbridge to use the Laptop.
fynzkVK4aa	My partner had the same problem with 3 and rang them up this week; they offered to move his contract to Orange for free (don't know why), or otherwise he would have had to pay (according to 3) for the contract to be ended early.  He declined as he only has a couple of months to go on his contract anyway, and Orange has rubbish coverage where we are too, but they may offer you the same option if you give customer services a ring and complain.<br>  <br>  I was also told by a friend that works for the Citizens Advice Bureau that if you are unable to get proper service because of poor network coverage, AND 3 informed you before you took the contract out that coverage is good in your area, that you actually have a case against them for breach of contract meaning they can't make you pay, as they aren't keeping their side of the deal so you don't have to keep yours.  If customer services aren't helpful with a "nice" approach from you, it might be worth trying this argument out on them to see if it gets you anywhere?<br>  <br>  Failing that I would pop in to your local CAB and ask, as you may find you do have grounds for solicitors letter or something like that which may get 3 to see your side of things!  It would be worth going because it is free, and you stand to save a fair amount of money on 10months worth of contract if you can get them to cancel it due to poor coverage.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helped a bit!|`|e4fdd62c908dc0926239505b332c8286aa	I have a 3 contract and don't get coverage in my own house of all places.  I too will be dumping them when my contract runs out in two months<br>  You need to contact 3 to cancel your contract.  They will require it in writing too.  You will have to pay a penalty unless you argue the point of poor coverage.  They might relent on the penalty.  You can only try.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|oHmVGBCEaa	do 3 offer on there website a facility to check coverage? if they do and it shows your area has good coverage you could maybe call them to complain and state your case to them not sure it will get you anywhere since a contract is a contract that doesn't stop you cancelling though but to do that they will probably charge you for the remainder of the contract|`|AA12180617	Once you sign a contract you have 5 choices:-<br>  <br>  1. Cancel within the cooling off period of 28 days.. (too late for you)<br>  2. Die (bit too drastic)<br>  3. Be Made Bankrupt (bit too drastic)<br>  4. Keep paying until teh contract period ends<br>  5. Pay the cancellation fee (which will be the same total cost as 4 but without the calls).<br>  <br>  so you're stuck with it.  if you stop paying them you WILL get a RED mark on your credit report as defaulting on contract payments such as phone bills is considered MORE serious that missing credit card payments.<br>  <br>  Complain to 3 (which is if you can get through to someone who speaks english) and ask for a phone exchange or take it to a 3 shop

It receives signals from the output of a DVD Player or other sources that have HDMI outputs.<br>  The TV displays the Video signal carried by the HDMI and the Audio signal carried by the HDMI will go to TV's Stereo speakers. So all you'll get is Stereo, not 5.1.<br>  To get 5.1 for your receiver you'll need a cable from your DVD and other source, that carries 5.1. Many DVDs and other equipment have Optical and/or Coaxial outputs that carry 5.1. See if your Sony has at least one Optical input. If it only has one, it may also have a Coaxial. You can use that for another source that has a Coaxial 5.1 output. If the Sony has more than one optical, use those for other sources. You could also use an Optical Switch or Optical Splitter.<br>  Now, some receivers have HDMI feed-thru's. You connect the source to one and use another as output to your TV.<br>  You have to look at your manuals, it is otherwise a bit complicated to explain, since there are many different combinations you can use.

josOoA32aa	You have to turn the feature on. To do this, turn on your iPod and go to "Settings". Then go to "Playback" and then there is an option there that says "Shake". Turn it on and it will say "Shuffle" so now all you have to do is give the iPod a shake (like you shake those useless glass ketchup bottles to get the ketchup out, but about half as hard) and it will automatically shuffle to a random song for you.<br>  <br>  Also, if you go to the "General" option under your "Settings" menu, you can also turn on the "Rotate" option so whenever you turn your iPod sideways, it will go to the cover flow like the iPod Touch does.<br>  <br>  Oh, and also it doesn't really matter which direction you shake it, it's how hard. I'd say it's more of a flicking motion.|`|ChYa4LzXaa	You have to shake it a certain way.  Like, its either up and down or side to side, or diagonal.

qvWbPZrdaa	LIVE....simply because the players are 10000038230483048x better, i have 360, i went to my cousins house, he has ps3, i played CoD WaW on PSN and i got 12-13 kills a game on search and destroy....the players on PSN are horrible, they run like idiots everywhere and arent aware of anything, a level 10 on LIVE could probably beat a 2nd or 3rd prestige, no joke. like in LIVE the players know what they're doing, ps3-NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING, horrible horrible players, LIVE OWNS|`|dCuWCbRkaa	I do like Live's interface and being able to connect to your MSN contacts, but it's a lot of money considering all that you are doing is using the internet.  Also if you aren't right by your computer, then you have to either buy a reallllllly long ethernet cord or a wireless adapter.  So you either have a cord run through your house or you spent a fortune on a dumb wireless adapter.  PS3 can go anywhere you get an internet signal, so that's a plus for me as well.|`|PLXc64xjaa	umm i dont know which is more fun to play|`|kUyEpnYfaa	PSN for sure RROD haha and you all have to spend 30 bucks for like 3 months PSN is FREE lol|`|MhySf1guaa	Xbox live is the one for me because its allot smoother on inviting your friends to play with you and logging on is easier.|`|3cb6875042240bce6f9ff1da0741e078aa	The Xbox Live|`|yIMUfAj4aa	xbox live- better online community|`|RpCwfcRzaa	Definitely Live.

Also, no one uses a mic so you can socialize like on Live.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	since i own both consoles i can honestly say xbox live is much better then the playstation network
RSdcFIk7aa	I have the same problem...I have been looking into the LG Rumor. So far for my preferences it looks to be the one for me. Right now I believe they have a rebate for it as well as the $150 credit. So that brings it around to about $29 out the door.
Y5j2Cr14aa	No, they will have to earse and sync it anyway so it isnt like they will be getting free songs.|`|pVDC46CCaa	If you want the person who gets it to be happy that they don't have to spend time downloading music, leave them on.<br>  If you want it to look new, erase them.|`|uTot7vsRaa	No need when the buyer will put the ipod to sync all its old songs will be replaced.|`|ugCaMO3saa	i bought an ipod off ebay, it came with several songs on it.<br>  so i guess it really doesnt matter.
iX9YBcGeaa	LOL ive been looking for one too!! my boyfriend has all the hardcore games like call of duty, and grandtheft auto and so on, a sweet game is fable 2 check it out on google, or even look at the videos on youtube.com it is a pretty game, im not sure of any other games im still looking myself haha!<br>  goodluck and let me know if you find any! <br>  carri xxx|`|xnpRvPPcaa	I think i love Dani above.......!|`|i6hnPX14aa	viva pinata is a good one <br>  hope this heps|`|ufUGcQGdaa	Okay, im a woman and a pretty hardcore gamer to boot. Just wondering...have you ever played games like need for speed and grand theft auto? GTA is my favourite game series ever, it is so addictive. It is not neccessarily girly, but I would always recommend it, to anyone. <br>  <br>  I used to love spyro!! I have all the games for ps1 (they were the best ones) and a couple for the ps2. Thats off topic though! Tomb Raider is awesome. Although I will say, while it does have the female protagonist which makes it more girl-friendly, Underworld can be a bit scary. There are giant tarantulas in it you have to fight and i hate spiders :( but it is still a great game, just warning you though!<br>  <br>  Mirrors edge is tons on fun, you have to fight people but the game is more about speed and climbing. Can be a little difficult in parts.<br>  <br>  Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 for Xbox 360...a big favourite for women. Dancing game...kinda imagine wii fit. Get a dance mat, its tons of fun!!<br>  <br>  Dead or Alive 4. Dead or Alive Xtreme. Yes, it is a bit of a perverts game, but a fun beat em up!<br>  <br>  You might like Final Fantasy XIII...it's not out yet but its quite a female friendly. As the title suggests, its all fantasy a little like the Spyro games, but more grown up. <br>  <br>  Rock Band/Guitar Hero. Very popular with female friends, has got signing in it etc.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I find the big, more single-player aimed games that come out on Xbox are generally directed torwards boys. Just take Halo, Call of Duty and GTA.<br>  <br>  For the xbox its kinda difficult. There are loads of more 'girl' games on the Wii, and the PS2. For PS2, I will recommend Kingdom Hearts. I think you would really like that, its a great game and it has disney characters in it, but it isnt necessarily childish. I love that game :)<br>  <br>  Others for Xbox that I haven't played:<br>  Rayman Raving Rapids<br>  The is also a spyro title for xbox 360...The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|RpCwfcRzaa	I like more FPS and stuff like that, but there are a few games I and other female gamers like. Try:<br>  Viva Pinata<br>  Tomb Raider Legend<br>  Tomb Raider Underworld<br>  Mirror's Edge<br>  Some RPGs (role playing games) like Fable 2, Oblivion, and Mass Effect<br>  The Lego games- Lego Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Batman<br>  Rayman Raving Rabbids<br>  Scene It: Lights, Camera, Action<br>  Scene It: Box Office Smash<br>  The music games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero are great and are fun for the whole family.<br>  You may also like a lot of the games on the Live Arcade Marketplace like Uno, Hexic, and A Kingdom for Keflings.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You really need to stop copying my answers.

First, you will need an audio file or song in .mp3 format. You can email me if you need an .mp3 file for a specific song. Upload that song into Ventones. Once it is done loading, you will get to choose a 30 second segment from the song to be your ringtone. To make it sound more realistically like a ringtone, I would suggest choosing the one second fade at the end.<br>  <br>  Next, once the 30 second ringtone is done uploading, you will be given the options to either download the file to your computer, enter your phone number and have it sent in a text, or generate the download URL and enter it in your phone's web browser. (I would choose the last option to enter it into your phone's browser.)<br>  <br>  Once it is in your browser, it might get slow, just because the download files are setting up and all that stuff. It will automatically download (it's a very small file) in about a second or two. To find the file, go to your "My Music" section (name will vary based on carriers; just play with it a little) and set the song as RINGTONE. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, your song is a ringtone =)<br>  <br>  (Note: I'm not sure if you have to pay to download it because you're using the Internet. I don't think I had to pay)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!<br>  <br>  Explore the site, follow instructions.|`|jwV5qKpnaa	i had the same problem a long time ago with all my sprint phones. use this FREE site<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ventones.com/free-sprint-ringtones-without-internet" rel="nofollow">http://www.ventones.com/free-sprint-ring...</a><br>  <br>  sprint does not allow you to use mp3 files in the memory card as ringtones. they block that. the  only way is to follow the above tutorial from<br>   ventones and convert the mp3 files to a video file. then transfer that to your memory card. <br>  <br>  ventones is the only free ringtone site that allows you to do that. <br>  <br>  its awesome!

S4C6EkG5aa	Yes, the Curve 8900 is smaller than the Bold. But I definitely love the look of the Bold better than the Curve. It does have 3G network meaning it's going to be faster, but it's all about personal preference. They both pretty much have the same applications with the newer interface. You may as well just go to the store if it is possible and hold them each and see which you like the feel of.|`|sYZ6IPWjaa	I prefer the look of the Curve 8900 to the Bold, so I purchased the Curve 8900.

k0BF9M0Haa	There's two ways to do it.<br>  <br>  1: Go to your computer and delete if off your iTunes library. Then hook your iPod to it and start syncing, it should be deleted after that.<br>  <br>  2: Again go to your iTunes library and instead of deleting the songs, clik your iPod icon under Device and click the music (or was it songs?) tab and switch it over to manual. From there you can decide which songs you want to put on your iPod. Hook up your iPod then start syncing. (Same thing for the games.. just click on the apps tab)<br>  <br>  3: Delete it straight from your iPod! You can only delete apps with this option though... what you do is you hold an app button thing, (instead of tapping it to access it) and wait until the screen starts "shaking". After that the apps should have a little black x mark in the corner. Tap on that and it should show you a window it an option to delete and viola! it's gone!<br>  <br>  Anywho hope this helped!|`|ALFMVEPKaa	yes , connect it to a comp , also u can use the app uninstaller|`|YHIFlsvoaa	Open iTunes>Plug in your iPod>Click on the iPod icon>Right click the song you want to delete>Select delete

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	You posted a question about this already, about your JoyCam (and you never chose an answer).<br>  <br>  As I tried to explain before, Polaroid made a lot of weird miniature instant films in the late 1990's and early 2000's.  I don't think any of them are available anymore.  Polaroid 600 is still available (for now) but it will NOT work in your camera.  It's a much bigger cartridge and was made for standard size Polaroid instant cameras.  Your camera was a "mini" Polaroid camera.<br>  <br>  I just did a quick search, and I'm not having any luck finding Polaroid 500 film either, on eBay or Amazon.  The film was also called "Captiva" so you might try doing a search for that too.  Otherwise, sadly, it looks like your camera might be an "orpan camera"...a working camera, but unfortunately uses film that is no longer available.<br>  <br>  If it was a normal roll film camera, it is possible to modify cameras to use other kinds of film that are available.  But you can't really modify a Polaroid camera, and especially not a minature one like yours.

For a game like GTA, there are known problems with it freezing because of all the content they have on one disk and the fact that the disk can't spin fast enough to keep up with the graphics. Since it's happening to games besides GTA, your 360 may get the red rings of death soon. Freezing is the first sign of this happening. If you do get the red rings (3 red sections of light around the power button), Microsoft will fix it for free. Since you haven't had your 360 long, you may want to send it in to MS now before you get the rings. You can call 1-800-4-My-Xbox and they'll help you out. <br>  Good luck. <br>  <br>  BTW, the hard drive is on the left side of the console when it's laying horizontally, not inside the console.

But if you are intent on tossing Metro then you can  get an iPhone 3g from AT&T. I hear those rock. Not sure if they have a built in Camera though.
Yi1TkQZFaa	Hello<br>  <br>  The C905 has not been recalled.<br>  <br>  There have been issues with the software; many people have found that the phone freezes, switches itself off, or that the speaker stops working.

oQSzZeubaa	Hello!  There are a couple of options listed on the Stewart-MacDonald site.  First is a clever installation tool ( <a href="http://www.stewmac.com/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=SERVE&sku=4321&ITEM=catalog/sku.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stewmac.com/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi...</a> ), should you wish to retain your current jack.  Second is a different style of jack retainer ( <a href="http://www.stewmac.com/shop/Hardware,_parts/Electric_guitar:_Covers_plates/Electrosocket_Jack_Mount.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stewmac.com/shop/Hardware,_pa...</a> ), which although not stock-looking when installed, would certainly make for a solid mount!

k0BF9M0Haa	Hmm well when you transfer your music to your iTunes library (By opening up two windows and dragging it over) and window pops up asking if you want to convert it to a mp3 file. Just click yes and you should see it in your iTunes library and then you may start syncing your songs.<br>  <br>  If that option doesn't work anymore then i suppose you can google an online converter >_<<br>  <br>  hope this helped!

1HtTxOOQaa	Usually, before PS3 came out, games were in SD format. The SD format had a problem cause games came out in 2 formats. One was NTSC which is USA, Japan... which has a max res of 480P whereas PAL was in European region which outputted 500P(around 500, i don't know exactly, but same as 480P on NTSC scale). Due to this difference, one region games couldn't be played in another region. <br>  <br>  But, with the onset of HD, the world decided to have a standard resolution and so 720P was termed as HD ready and 1080P was coined as Full HD. This standardization means now a console like PS3 can play any format games (be it NTSC or PAL). Hence PS3 games are 'REGION FREE'. Yes, you can play American games on your Irish PS3 no problem. I personally have Resistance 2 from PAL region and MGS4 from NTSC region, and both work well on my PS3. So pick any game you like and the PS3 will run it no problem.<br>  <br>  Note: PS3 Blu-Ray movies unlike games are region coded. The regions are divided into 3 parts. Your Irish PS3 (if bought from Europe) falls under Region B and America and Japan falls under Region A. So you won't be able to play American Blu-Rays take a note of that. Usually behind the movie box, a world symbol is there with an alphabet A,B or C. Pick one with B for you. Games will work, but Movies (Blu-Ray movies only) will have problems if they are from other region.|`|1WgOj89kaa	This is just the video format for Asia and USA. The opposite to this is PAL, which is Europe.|`|gN7eEQeWaa	NTSC is the video standard used in USA and Japan<br>  in Europe and i think ireland PAL is used...

24d30303d7dfdc03b1d6d393f19ad4bcaa	Apple iPods are the leading mp3 players in the world. iPods are little expensive, but are worth the money you spend. The iPod line starts with the iPod shuffle, which is so tiny and doesn't have a screen. It is available in 1GB and 2GB capacities. It costs about Rs.4000/-. The next one is iPod nano 4th generation, which is very thin and elegant with a nice 2" screen and a click wheel. It comes in the capacities 8GB and 16GB (flash memory). The 8GB version is around Rs.8800/- and the 16GB one is around Rs.12000/-. Another one is the mighty iPod classic which comes in 80GB and 120GB (hard disk) versions. This one is perfect for anyone who has a great library of songs and videos with them. It has 2.5" screen and a click wheel. The 80Gb version's price is about Rs.11000/- and the 120GB costs about some Rs.13000/-. Last, but not least comes the iPod touch 2nd generation. It has an amazing 3.5" glass covered multi-touch lcd display and a physical home button. It isn't just a mp3 player, but can be regarded as a pocket pc with internet surfing, Wi-Fi, mail, YouTube, stocks, weather, maps etc. Its very thin and it comes in 8Gb, 16GB, and 32GB versions. The 8GB one costs about Rs.14000/-, 16GB is around Rs.17000/-, and 32GB version's price is about Rs.22000/-. <br>  You can have other branded mp3 players of Sony, Philips etc. Sony walkman players are known for their fidelity in sound. Its better to walk into a store and compare all the mp3 players available, on your own and come to a decision. Hope I helped you...|`|rm8ffJasaa	depends on how much media you have and what you are using if for mostly.  i have 70 movies (my entire DVD collection ripped and converted) and about 5,00 songs on my Zune 120.  the video quality is amazing, the User interface is 10X easier to use and understand than apples (my 55 year old father picked it up and found the song he was looking for in about 10 seconds....and this is the first time he ever used one)  The touch's are nice, but the limited size (32GB) wouldnt fit half my movies plus it costs like $400 i think...the Zune 120GB was $250.  i have a touch screen phone and i would hate to be cleaning the screen off on my touch.  I never have to touch the screen, plus the Zunes have glass screens unlike ipods which are plastic and scratch easily.<br>  <br>  in short, I love my Zune, i will never buy or own another ipod (i had a classic and a nano) after owning my Zune|`|rWZbtgXIaa	You have to choose the brand depending upon your needs. If you want just a mp3 player, you can go for either ipod shuffle, or for creative stone.

rJ3Pb4Qbaa	I think it is really good. It is responsive and normally quite fast, depending on what you've touched, as well as the connection speed when you are opening something. I like that you can add vibration and/or sound when you are touching something - it's easier because then you know if you've touched something by accident. But, if you don't like it then you can just as easily take it off. You have to be precise with your touching though.|`|uKYONq34aa	Its kewl.... i haave it..<br>  if u have quesstons on it contact me|`|nHhQ952Kaa	pretty sweet, vibrates everytime you touch it, changeable setting, only thing is scrolling and if you have a screen protector it is near impossible to avoid air bubbles while it make the screen less responsive.

deqc17Mkaa	On your 80gb console it is just there for show, it doesn't open at all. Only the 60gb console and the old 80gb MotorStorm or Metal Gear Solid 4 bundles (which you don't have) had anything under the door. What would have been under that door if you had one of those models is card readers for SD, Memory Stick's and Compact Flash memory cards which you don't really need anyway.|`|FIL4vngsaa	Sorry to tell you this but Sony removed backwards compatibility (use of PS2 games) and 2 USB ports (leaving 2/4) and they also removed the Card readers in order to reduce the price because everyone wanted the price to be lowered.<br>  And Sony thought they'd take to give.<br>  <br>  So, there is no card readers on ANY of the ne PS3 systems. <br>  I got mine in November 2008 and I was wondering the same thing.|`|HekFanRvaa	It should be just a matter of pushing it lightly  with your thumb (it's like a door with a hinge on top) to expose the card readers. But since yours does not have  a card reader (because you got the 80GB without backwards compatibility), you can't open it. It has nothing on it. but if you just wanna open it, a crow bar will do. lol... kidding!<br>  <br>  peace!|`|o0b6Ha49aa	You can't open that.

Plenty of gameplay, you can play it multiple times either being good, bad or neutral (what's the fun it neutral tho lol). <br>  <br>  Another good game is Mass Effect.|`|gqnyQ3L5aa	It depends what you like but I would say try Lost Odyssey its very similar to Final Fantasy series I don't know if you ever played any of those. And its really long if you gonna do all the side quests (4 dvds) it took me 80 hours but you can finish it quicker if you just stick to main story.<br>  Fable 2 is good I played it for a while but i did not find it very entertaining. Firstly because its very easy and the story is pretty lame I think I would recommend it to people who have never played rpg games before. It all depends what you like if you like fairy tales and easy game play try fable 2 lol.<br>  Mass effect definitely game you should have great shooter with rpg elements best game I have played last year on xbox .<br>  Whats all I can think of that's worth playing there isn't that much great rpg on xbox for now at least.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	soul caliber 4

Standard text messaging rates (such as international text messaging fees) do apply.  Consult your service provider to ensure that your text plan covers your Twitter usage. If you're using our international number, give your provider the Twitter phone number you'll be using to see if you'll incur extra charges.  If you're using Twitter from outside of the US, please consult your carrier, as every provider has a different policy.<br>  <br>  so if you have unlimited text messaging..so it wont charge you for anything else.

0GufmTWaaa	Iv'e had Pocket God for about 3 or 4 weeks. The thing is that the creators try to put updates on every Sunday. Every time they update it, it has something new. For example: for episode 8-jump the shark-they added a shark. They also try to put a secret unlockable inside the title of each episode. TO ANSWER your question: no, you cant go back to episode 1. Why would you? In episode 1 all you could do is flick the islanders. You see Pocket got isnt a game, it's more like an interactive setting. You flick islanders, throw coconut on their head, tilt the iphone to slide them into the water, etc. <br>  HOPE THAT HELPS!|`|SHtccptyaa	The episodes are just a fancy name for the updates,<br>   you dont really play through the episodes, each episode just adds new things,( and episode 8 has all of the things that have come out so far) so you are really playing through all of the episodes right now.<br>  <br>  when episode 9 comes out it will just add a new thing to do :)|`|hHNglWDwaa	Try resync wit iTunes or delete, reboot, and install again|`|NCpQ8MYNaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkKkt_44UynF9t_W3MXjzfPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304112718AAJYzda">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XnrL8oZMaa	Thank god i found someone like you im an apple ipor touch 2g app reviewer named ilovemeanpeople please check out my channle and subscribe i havent reviewed pocket god but my friend has it and you should get it if your bored and just want to pull out a game an play thats the game for you and also entertaing for young kids

d942b465d5e28d6f595812ffa5d06b9baa	Nah, thats crazy talk. The corporations tell you this so that you can shell out cash for their apps on the Apple App store. Seriously, hello! This is the 21st century, digital information is free, you just have to know where to look. I have 30 some games from the App store (including my favorite, Rolando!) all free of charge. Here is a quick and painless way to jailbreak the ipod touch 2g, how i did it. But...if you are not very comprehensive when it comes to computers, just go straight to the following link:<br>  <a href="http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/hd-video-tutorial-of-how-to-jailbreak-your-ipod-touch-2nd-generation-semi-tethered-jailbreak/" rel="nofollow">http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  I recommend you do my way though, because i can assure you it works, perfectly.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a windows computer, btw:<br>  I performed a successful tethered jailbreak on my ipod touch 2G one month ago using the RedSn0w tool for windows 32 bit, and I have used Cydia and Installer flawlessly. I rebooted or turned off the ipod a few times since (just to see it was possible), and everything is going great. Here is the site of the guide I used:<br>  <a href="http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/gui-jailbreaking-ipod-touch-2nd-gen-application-for-windows-released/" rel="nofollow">http://alltechrelated.wordpress.com/2009...</a><br>  This is the best GUI method out there, and really easy and quick (I used codename: Cynw00d). Follow the instructions carefully, and you should be set. The links of where to download the app are there. But you'll need the firmware ipsw file its self. I used the latest version of firmware for the ipod touch (5H11a) and it works great. Here is a trustworthy site where I always get my ipod touch firmware:<br>  <a href="http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/</a><br>  So thats it! Thats all you need to know! I will say this, there is this one step in the app where you need to select the firmware that you will patch to jailbreak. The first time I did this, I didn't highlight it. Everything wil seem okay, but a later step won't work. So don't forget to highlight the firmware you wish to use for the jailbreak when the app asks you!<br>  <br>  ~ilz<br>  p.s. If you're on a mac, use an app called "Crossover" to run the Redsn0w.exe. I wouldn't bother looking for a different method for mac, just because this one is so flawless.<br>  <br>  ***If for some reason you're still on a 1 g, go here:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI1PD6WKEo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI1PD6WK...</a>|`|BCF6HucXaa	The good thing about performing the jailbreak on the iPod Touch is that anything that you can do to mess it up you can easily fix jailbreaking is all software and you should be fine no matter what.|`|82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	No. Jailbreaking is very beneficial and allows you to do loads of cool things with your iTouch. There is no risks involved, and the process is completely reversible.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|8cG6OTcsaa	No way I've jailbreaked too many to count on my fingers lol. People who say it's dangerous don't know what they're talking about. Anything can be fixed by a simple restore. The only thing that can't is if you brick it. This means that a file needed to boot it has been deleted, so it won't switch on so essentially I'd is a brick, but if you take it back to the apple store as long as it's in the apple 1 year warantee, they'll give you a brand new one for free because they can't switch it on either. <br>  <br>  Although it does slow startup time a bit the benefits definitely outweigh the risks. Also it doesn't hurt to try, if you don't think it's worth it, then just click restore in iTunes and it'll be back to the way it was when you got it.  <br>  For easy to follow tutorials look at www.iclarified.com but if you want any more info email me and I'll guide you through any iPod related stuff.|`|t9IC0VWsaa	If you do the jailbreak right, it is completely harmless to your iPod.<br>  <br>  If you need any help with it, just email me bro :]<br>  -good luck!|`|iZpOBKtLaa	All I can say is, use a trusted source.<br>  That's all.<br>  It would be risky to use a complete random jb.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|XnrL8oZMaa	yes agreed when you jb it (jailbreak) you slow it down a tad bit...oh check out my youtube account for info on ipod touch applications more will be up. i dont know when i can do another vid but the name of it is ilovemeanpeople. thanks and dont jailbreak your touch
Xxviy63Paa	The message you're seeing is part of your monitor's ROM programming. It is its response to an input signal that it doesn't recognize.<br>  <br>  If someone makes a composite to vga adapter cable, it's because they can sell it, not because it works. While both composite and vga are analog signals, they are not at all the same format. The signal gets to the monitor via the vga connector, but it's still a composite signal. Your monitor is all wtf about it.<br>  <br>  You can make HDMI to DVI cables, but that's because they carry the same digital signal. <br>  <br>  There is basically no way to connect a ps2 to a pc monitor that doesn't have composite or component input, unless you spend extra money. That can be on either a signal conversion box, which cost at least $50 and might not work so good, or a capture or tuner card for your pc that can capture the signal and relay it to the monitor as VGA or DVI signal. Either method basically converts the composite/component to vga or digital.<br>  <br>  There is such thing as a ps2 vga cable, but it doesn't work under the normal ps2 operating system, only under ps2 linux. It's hard to find, too. No point looking for one cause you'd only get to play homebrew games of which there aren't many.|`|HekFanRvaa	you actually don't need the red and white to go to your monitor because those 2 are for audio.

KLL0Acrwaa	The Nikon D60 does not have the wireless flash commander built-into the camera, so the D60's popup flash cannot do wireless TTL flash by itself.<br>  <br>  To do wireless TTL flash with the D60, you need to add one of the following:<br>  1) the SU-800 flash commander, or<br>  2) the SB-800 speedlight flash in the hotshoe, or<br>  3) the new SB-900 speedlight flash in the hotshoe.<br>  <br>  The SB-800 and SB-900 flashes have wireless flash commanders built-in, so they can control an SB-600 in wireless TTL off camera.  The SU-800 is specifically designed to control flashes off camera.|`|d55HYaktaa	I recommend buying a SB-800, so you will be able to use the SB-800 for fill flash, and the SB-600 as an additional light source.<br>  <br>  If you put a remote flash controller in the D60, you will not be able to use the built-in flash as a fill flash.

r7tzSp9caa	Yes, if you click sync, it will erase all things on your iPod/iPhone.The most convenient and secure way is to use an iPod-to-mac transfer program to help you. This is how I did.

Also, you can use it to transfer files from iPod/iPhone to iTunes or from Mac to iPod in a direct way.<br>  <br>  The great thing is that it won't cause any deletion of any files while transferring, because: when this program is launched, it will modify the automatic synchronization of music/video to manual synchronization between iPod and iTunes.<br>  <br>  It even has step-by-step guide:<br>  <a href="http://gutensoft.com/Guide/How-to-transfer-music-videos-photos-on-your-iPod-iPhone-to-Mac.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gutensoft.com/Guide/How-to-transf...</a><br>  Hope it helps.|`|rm8ffJasaa	you need a 3rd party software (pretty sure cucusoft has it) it is an ipod to computer program that will take the music off your ipod and put it on your computer....it isnt Free tho.  there may be a freeware version out there by another company but cucusoft is the only one i know of off hand..........another reason Zunes are better....i can take all my music off the zune and transfer it to any computer that has the zune software in about 5 minutes|`|yfIOqSrpaa	you could connect your ipod and another device  to the same computer and sync all ur music from ur ipod to that other device than transfer it from the other device to ur macbook

The idea that "digital takes over" is misleading. Digital is already here. <br>  <br>  After the analog shutdown in June, a lot of stations will be changing frequencies and power levels. So your reception might get better, or not. <br>  <br>  Most likely you are going to need a better antenna.<br>  <br>  What constitutes a "better antenna" is extremely dependent on where the antenna is located.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	You have a good question.  The only thing I can think of is that the capacity of a battery is determined by it's chemistry and it's size.  A given amount (size of the battery) of the same type of chemicals (alkaline, etc.) will produce a given amount of energy.  Since AAA, AA, C, D, batteries are all a given size, the amount of energy is the same.  If one brand says it "now lasts 30% longer", the rest will follow suit in short order.  They just buy one of their competitors batteries and analyze it for chemical composition and produce the same power from their batteries in short order.  You can look up the mA or mAh rating of most batteries at the site below.  Just click on the battery type for full specs.  However, in many cases these "30% more" claims aren't exactly accurate.|`|OiT5SJM8aa	Yes, you're missing Mah.<br>  <br>  It's actually showing up on Cell phone batteries, laptop batteries and many more.<br>  <br>  mAh stands for Milliamp Hour, a technical term for how much power a particular battery will hold, thus, indicating how long it can last.<br>  <br>  Ask your local Batteries Plus ( <a href="http://www.batteriesplus.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.batteriesplus.com</a> ) if you need more info.<br>  <br>  You need to compare batteries for the same type of device in order to know which one is best.|`|fLYMqZ8zaa	It would bump the price up massively. Checking every type of battery for how much 'power' it holds and then ensuring each and every one of those types of batterys manufactured meets the stated volume of 'power' is extremely expensive.

If you see a cheat you would like to use, but you don't have that expansion pack installed, if you have any expansion pack that was released later (by EA -- not by how you installed the ep) then normally you will still have that cheat because EA included them into their later released expansion packs too.<br>  <br>  Oh, and at the top of the page in the link I gave to you is the word boolprop.  If you click on that, it lists a bunch of things you can do if you turn the boolprop cheat on.<br>  <br>  And, on the left side, you'll see links to other things on that site.  There is a spot that lists all of the different careers, which ep's they came with; all the levels in each career and what skills your sim will need to be promoted to that level, etc.  There is another page that lists the zodiac signs and which signs are compatible with which other signs.<br>  <br>  There's just lots and lots of good information about the game on that site.
jxpV13rTaa	there is no wifi in the ps2. the only way to get online is to use an ethernet cable|`|HekFanRvaa	you can get a signal but not enought to play online. it's only good for laptops for checking emails but not online gaming.|`|1WgOj89kaa	You cannot. The PS2 Does not have WIFI, so the only way too go online is too use wires.
b69Gm5fPaa	No. You can run the video through the VCR, but not vice versa.<br>  <br>  The cable out of the wall goes into the back of the DTV receiver where it says SATELLITE IN. A coax or composite cable (red, white, and yellow) goes from the DTV receiver into the VCR where it says IN. Then the same goes from the VCR where it says OUT into the TV.

I've gotten a Motorola Bluetooth headset that cost $30 (American) on Amazon, which would be about $35 in Canadian dollars. <br>  <br>  Don't get the Playstation headset. It isn't as high quality as the ones you can get online and it costs more.

nQ7G1nBVaa	It depends on the computer and TV.<br>  <br>  Most computers have VGA, and most flat panel TVs have VGA in, so you could use that. S-video may be an option, but is not as good. You will need to run separate audio cables.<br>  <br>  If you computer has DVI and your TV HDMI, you can get a cable for that.
VMVW3E7Aaa	It sounds to me like you're simply using a rather long exposure, which would cause the "blurring and partial transparency". The "slow processing" is part of that, too.<br>  I am guessing that you usually use Auto settings, but you don't understand how to use the other modes yet, right?<br>  There is nothing wrong with the camera, it is perfectly normal to blur on a longer exposure.<br>  <br>  Here is how to fix your problems: Learn about your camera !!!!<br>  <br>  Read your manual !!!! Read it several times, and practice in between.<br>  <br>  Attend a class, read some books, read/watch online tutorials.<br>  <br>  The major camera manufacturers (like Canon, Nikon, Olympus etc) all have very useful sections on their website for learning about photography.<br>  <br>  Understanding at least the basic principles  will enable you to make the most of your nice camera, and will make a HUGE difference to your images.|`|hCGR2Yjhaa	It's just a hunch anyway,<br>  <br>  But  I think it has something to do with your photo taking settings. For example, I had experiences with camera that anything it shots come out blurry. Because, I had it set on a settings like, Landscape shots. Or, a still photo like mode best suited for still pictures.<br>  <br>  Try reviewing the instruction manual or something. But, you could always experiment anyway. <br>  <br>  *or maybe, you become a vampire or a supernatural creature or something.*|`|TE7RrtMMaa	Okay your first problem is that you have a Canon...LOL.  Okay so i know a little bit about cameras and based on what you said, it sounds like your shutter speed is turned up.  That is why the shop is taking so long.  When your shutter gets turned up, your camera stays open longer.  The best thing you can do is look at the book that can with your camera an see how to adjust the shutter. Best of luck, and hope you have fun with you camera!!!|`|AA12323486	The light is too dim.  It takes too long to make an exposure in dim light, then takes a while longer to write it to the card.

YupMCYHlaa	There are sites on the Internet that do 'file transfer'.  The one I use is YouSendIt.com, but there are others.  You upload your file there and then they keep it for a few days and people you choose can download it.  They charge for really big files, but smaller files, I think up to several hundred megabytes, are free.  They even e-mail the people you designate to download it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you have to burn a CD or DVD and snail-mail that.

Motorola US will not warranty the phone here because they do not have the parts to do so. You should be able to call Motorola in any country and then ask them what is the country of origin of your phone and then they can refer you to a service center in that country. Please note that the warranties vary by country so you'll need to check to see what the warranty is for that country.<br>  <br>  You should be able to go to the link below, Enter your IMEI in the left column where it says Check Product Warranty and it may tell you where and if your phone is still in warranty.

It's better you get a contract free local SIM card/Cell Phone from RebelFone even before you leave US.

Try the link below:|`|678c4cdd58e1cfa7d327d2ca40068abeaa	Ok, the cheapest solution is to make skype calls from a computer, (2 cents a minute to the US).  But, obviously that's not the most convenient.  instead I would "unlock" my phone.  Call t-mobile, and as long as you are in good standing with them, request the unlock code and that should let your phone work on any "GSM" network.  (GSM is what most carriers across the world use to talk to your cell phone)  Then Purchase a SIM card for your phone.  I would look at this for instance <a href="http://www.telestial.com/view_product.php?PRODUCT_ID=MSIM-PP01" rel="nofollow">http://www.telestial.com/view_product.ph...</a>  All you have to do is once you get the SIM Card, replace the one in your phone with it, it's really easy to do.  Typically its a little card around your battery compartment that is removable, if you look at your phone right now you can prob find the slot pretty easily.  Prepaid international SIM cards make it super easy to use your cell abroad, and if you get one like the passport above it will let others call you at no cost to them (with a toll free #), although it still uses your prepaid money.  If for some reason you can't unlock your current cell phone you can just google around and find a cheap unlocked one and buy it.  I got a samsung D807 for $60 on ebay.  it's quad band so it works anywhere in the world, but technically a dual band or triband would also work for italy and greece.

You can put in the cell number, URL's, etc.<br>  <br>  I did this on my daughters phone because she was getting annoying phone calls & text messages. I was told to do this by the Verizon rep on the phone when I called to see if there was a way to block these calls & texts.  This will only worked with numbers that actually show the caller ID, if they are blocked, private, unavailable it won't work.<br>  <br>  If you need further information (as in exact buttons to click on), email me and I'll go into my account and look at everything and email you back the exact steps.

In that case they wud also need a police report...However if u dont wanna do that i do know that some fones CAN block sum numbers from contacting u. I wud suggest go into the call log select he number that is the problem and click options. from there u shud be able to block it. If however the person has withheld there number then ur not guna be able to block it and in that case wud be a case for the local police and verizon. Hope this helps and gud luck to ya
TU6hZ2Beaa	If you're looking for a Blu-ray player that can do it all, check out the Sony BDP-S550 player.<br>  It's got a ton of improvements over Sony's (and the competition's) previous models.<br>  <br>  It can internally decode all 7.1 next-gen audio formats. This is the player that will easily let you play Dolby TrueHD as well as dtsHD Master Audio soundtracks.<br>  <br>  It is Profile 2.0 capable right out of the box. No upgrades required (at least not right now!). With the built-in network port, upgrades are a snap.<br>  <br>  Sony's previous players (except the 350) had slow loading times. The 550 is much quicker. You even have the option of a quick start-up mode, even faster than the default standard one which is fast enough.<br>  <br>  Most Blu-ray players display total and elapsed time. This player also features remaining time, crucial if you want to know how much time is left on the disc.<br>  <br>  The 550 includes a backlit remote, a real improvement if you are using your player in a darkened room.<br>  <br>  The best feature of the 550 is its price. Although the $357.19 price tag may seem high to some, actual discounts are closer to $300-$330, which is about $50 higher than the bottom line 350 model. Considering how many extra features you get, it seems like a bargain.<br>  <br>  If want a reasonable inexpensive Blu-ray player that can handle all your options now or in the short-term future, the Sony BDP-S550 is the one to get!|`|AA11593071	The short answer is, if buying on plastic get both, try both and take the loser back for full credit, but keep all the boxed stuff.<br>  <br>  <br>  I went the BDP-s550, I hooked with HDMI, and it is a fantastic player,<br>  and the Sony will need a update, but ethernet will only take you maybe 5 minutes to complete. Same interface as the PS3, I just wish<br>  it had the ability to get the CD titles, and songs off the net.<br>  <br>  Probably same for Samsung.|`|0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	Sony is a better brand name than Samsung.

fKDZlxOsaa	glad you asked. I was just about to post a question on here about lenses for that camera.<br>  <br>  I  own the 40D myself and it's an outstanding camera. The kit lens, 28-135mm, is a piece of crap and I have NEVER heard of anyone using it. Almost everyone buys another lens for the 40D. <br>  <br>  So I would highly recommend the body only for the 40D and buying other lenses. Oh, you're short on money and want to know which lenses to buy? I'm glad you asked. : )<br>  <br>  The 50mm f/1.8 prime lens. You have no zoom, but it is super fast and great for portraits. stand about 6 feet away and point at subjects face and you get their shoulders and head. Also, great for indoors because at f/1.8 you don't need as much light. Best part: this lens can be found on amazon for $80 USD.<br>  <br>  A cheap zoom lens is the 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6. That's the kits lens for the rebel, but it's not that great either. without IS (if you can find it) it's about $60-80 USD also. with IS it's more like $150.<br>  <br>  A cheap telephoto zoom lens is the 55-250mm f/3.5-5.6 with IS. That lens takes better quality pictures for a great price. It's about $250.<br>  <br>  I don't entirely agree with above's opinion. It is possible to learn how to do photography on your own with the camera. I bought the 40D from my uncle and bought those 3 lenses and walked around teaching myself, taking tips from others, and reading the 40D user manual. You can do it yourself, but I would only do it if you are serious about it. Although you DO need a lens to take pictures, otherwise the body alone is useless.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Yes, It is absolutely necessary to have a lens. Without the camera is just a paperweight. The cheapest lens you can get for it would be the 50mm F1.8 at about $90.<br>  <br>  As this obviously is your first SLR you should really take a good look at the Canon Rebel series. They are much cheaper. Image quality will be exactly the same at low and medium ISO levels and you can afford to buy a couple of nice lenses. Believe me that unless you know a good deal about photography and have the ability to use the camera competently in the manual mode you wont appreciate the differences between the 40D and the Rebels.<br>  <br>  Aside from your skill level lenses are the most important determiner of image quality. It is best to buy a cheaper camera and invest your money in good lenses. Lenses last a lifetime while cameras become obsolete in a few years.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Hello Amanda.<br>  <br>  Without a lens your camera will make a nice paperweight.<br>  <br>  I, too, suggest taking a couple of photography classes before making such an investment.<br>  <br>   I don't know what your budget is but in my opinion the Canon XS with 18-55mm IS (Image Stabilized) lens for $523.95 from B&H <br>  ( <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com</a> ) would be a great "starter" camera.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Buy one of the entry level Canon cameras with a lens to get started ... once you learn how to use it (a year or two at least), you can buy a more advanced camera ... and it will use all the lenses you have been accumulating since buying the first one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/notcamera.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/notcamer...</a><br>  <br>  And NO.<br>  <br>  You need a lens ... since you didn't know that all by yourself, you really need to take at least one class in photography before you spend too much money, only to be frustrated and disappointed.

Rs1Mc34paa	I used QuickPWN to jailbreak my iPhone 3G and its really fast and simple. Just download the latest version from their website here:<br>  <a href="http://www.quickpwn.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.quickpwn.com/</a><br>  <br>  I think the download will come as a zip file so you'll have to unzip it. Just open up the QuickPWN.exe file and make sure your iPhone is connected. It'll guide you through the process. Oh, and make sure you pay attention since there will be a part where you actually have to hold down the home and/or sleep/wake buttons for certain amounts of time. At the end where it tells you to hold the home button for 30 seconds, you don't really have to hold it down the whole time, just until the timer stops moving and proceeds with the process.<br>  <br>  Also, a few words of advice. I have had both positive and negative experiences jailbreaking my iPhone 3G or iPod Touch. Although you don't have to restore to factory settings before jailbreaking it, I would recommend it if your iPhone doesn't have much available memory left. I am not sure why but whenever I tried jailbreaking when it had a lot of information on it, it tends to get stuck on the apple logo when it attempts to reboot so then you're forced to put it in recovery mode and restore it anyway. I found that the jailbreak process went smoothly when the memory was not as heavily used or was recently restored.<br>  <br>  Also, near the end of the jailbreak process, it'll say to wait for it to reboot and that the process is done. The process is not really done and you can tell because the iPhone will have images on the screen telling you what's going on with it. So it's best to just leave it connected until it fully reboots and you can see the lockscreen.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YxpfbQbSaa	Go to jailbreakme.com. it will instruct you through it. Mr. T|`|8cG6OTcsaa	Just like he said ^^^<br>  There are some great tutorials on www.iclarified.com<br>  Or if you want email me and I'll give you hand with it and any other iPhone related stuff, cause I'm quite experienced with all this stuff.|`|Fn7804Y6aa	download the newest version of quickpwn here <br>  <a href="http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/4689995/QuickPwn-225-2.zip.4689995.TPB.torrent" rel="nofollow">http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/4689995...</a><br>  <br>  then find and download the firmware from here<br>  <a href="http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/</a><br>  <br>  start up quickpwn and the rest is very easy it tells you what to do
