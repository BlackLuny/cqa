You can do some pre-stretches to help loosen yourself up, but the main things is just do them over and over until you are all the way down. It hurts, but it works! :)|`|9IAEhl0Maa	You should practice your all three splits every night before you go to bed. You can get your splits in two weeks! <br>  <br>  I do them in this order:<br>  <br>  -Right Split, Hold for two 8 counts.<br>  -Left Split, Hold for two 8 counts.<br>  -Straddle, Hold for two 8 counts. Then, while you are still in your straddle stretch, put your elbows on the ground in front of you and hold for 8 counts.<br>  <br>  If you want to, repeat this!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :D|`|qXHjguYiaa	Well to be honest practacing them is the best way. You may not be able to go all the way down but thats okey. And it you want it really fast try putting your front leg on a block a or mat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a foot off the ground... thats how i got it, and that was like 5 years ago, and even though i dont do my spilts much any more i can still do it! i hope this helps:) try it!|`|p9Ku6RKOaa	Yoga.<br>  <br>  Also, its hard to improve unless you have someone helping. sit down and spread your legs as far as you can...now have someone push down on you so you get your stomach as close to the floor as possible. it will hurt...but no pain, no gain!

WaJdOaFKaa	If there is one thing a photographer couldn't have too much of, its MORE gear.  Sure, he already has accessories, but there must be some lens he's been drooling over.  If he's already got every lens he wants, get him something useful, like a sensor cleaning kit or a copy of photoshop CS4 or elements 7 and a book on how to use it.  Believe me, I've got every lens I need to do what I do - but it couldn't hurt to have that new micro nikkor 105mm f/2.8 VR I've been looking at.  I like to think of myself as a very "general" amateur photographer, with no real focus to my work.  Though I can get to 105mm with one of my other lenses, getting a macro lens will allow me to shoot a different type of subject.  And I don't know too many photographers that couldn't use another good lens.  I've already got a good tripod, but a carbon fiber manfrotto tripod and head would be awesome.  So, even though your man already has some gear, there's nothing like getting more.  And remember, sometimes the little things can be quite useful, like filters, memory cards, and the like.|`|CAh2xCpOaa	Lenses are always good.<br>  <br>  There's one for every budget<br>  <br>  $90 for the optically well rated but cheaply built must have EF 50 1.8 II<br>  $600 for best pro lens value EF 70-200 4L telephoto lens<br>  $1700 for the amazing EF 70-200 2.8L IS telephoto lens<br>  <br>  See what kind of photos he likes to take, and decide on a type of lens: telephoto, wide-angle or "normal"|`|jtjISk6qaa	how about a new lens? a new camera bag? even Photoshop CS4 would be great!|`|i5OVORXgaa	Let him decide... get him a gift card to a camera store.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	What sort of photography does he enjoy most, and list for us the lenses, flash (if he has any external ones), and filters he has in his bag.<br>  <br>  If he has pretty much everything, the next step could just be some higher end software like Photoshop CS4 and Lightroom.

Firstly theaters have been around longer than the Greeks have. If you visit India or China, you will see theaters that are older than Greek Amphitheaters.<br>  Secondly, the idea that "strategy" is a Greek concept is really not very smart. Sure, it is a Greek word, but that doesn't mean that they invented it. Numerous other cultures have had strategies, since the time man started to fight one another.<br>  Lastly, sewing or weaving has been evidenced in Paleolithic cultures dating back to before 5000BCE in places like South America and Switzerland.

Dug6yDOLaa	I broke through the thick bunch of trees that surrounded me and saw a surreal sight. As I looked out in front of me in a dreamy state, I saw what now surrounded me. The small, pool of water surrounded me, gleaming a deep purple in the sunset. The water rushes in and out silently, it was the only sound I could hear. I watched as three ducks silently floated along, every so often dunking to catch a tiny fish for food. I looked down and saw the gleam of hundreds of little silver fish quickly swam along. When I looked up I saw the clouds a pinkish white, slightly covering the fiery orange-red sun. I twirled around and saw the mountain ranges, covered with the wild flowers and fir trees. I took my shoes off and walked into the water, compared to the air it was warm and comforting. As the sun set I swam in the the purple pool of water. I felt the rush of the water all around me and felt peace. The brush and small plants surrounded the lake, seeming to hide me from reality.

OYWqaDtOaa	It involves three story-lines that sort of come together toward the end.  It centers around a book and some letters that a girl finds in her father's library.  Her father begins a search for Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler, after finding this book in the university library.  His professor conducted his own search years earlier, and he sort of passes the torch to his student (it's not quite so simple as that, but I don't want to give away too much).  After the daughter finds the book, she takes up where her father left off.  The book is super creepy and the characters are pretty well drawn.  Kostova's Vlad Tepes is a rather interesting and different Dracula.  There are also a couple of love stories and an interesting and pretty unexpected family drama towards the end.  I recommend it.

IcvmE6UCaa	Bear in mind that across the centuries Naples (and indeed the whole Italy) has been dominated by people coming from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, France and Germany (that'is, among others, Normans, Suebi, Anjou, Capetians and the house of Hohenstaufen).<br>  <br>  As a result of such dominations and despite the stereotypes, the genetic pattern of southern italians still has features that are typical of people from north Europe such as blue eyes and blond hair that, together with black hair, eyes and dark complexion resulting from the arabic domination, are quite common in southern italy, especially in the areas of Naples and Sicily.|`|xnDcmV1xaa	I have a friend who is 50% Filipino, and she has very dark skin, hair, etc. <br>  <br>  It is true that northern Italians have light complexions and hair, but it all depends on genetics. For example, my best friend has full-blooded northern Italian grandparents. She has blonde hair and green eyes. <br>  <br>  Even though your grandparents came from Napoli, if their ancestors lived primarily in Italy for years, you could have had a great-great-somebody that didn't have the blonde hair or blue eyes.<br>  <br>  As for the Irish, you never know, there could be a gene floating around somewhere and you happened to get it!|`|Ir7JA6IUaa	No one here can tell you why your genes are the way they are. Your traits are all recessive, so your parents both carry those recessive genes, and you were the 1 in 4 chance that blond/blue eyes would show up in one of their kids. <br>  <br>  BTW, I've met plenty of Italians with blond hair and blue eyes. Even typically dark skinned and brown eyed Persians can come out blond and blue eyed.

You can also watch the movie, which might not be restocked after it comes out. they might run out! lol.  Also, you may want to play a game, like bobbing for apples and have everybody wear an old t-shirt so you can dye the water red. then place beautiful red apples in the water. whoever gets it first wins. that would be really fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!

The parties will be on Friday nights, and you will be able to buy the DVD at midnight on Saturday morning.  Also, play some kind of Twilight trivia.  You could write the questions on note cards, and play that.  Sit around and google Rob Pattinson. He is hot enough that doing that will keep you entertained.  Also, watch the DVD extras.  Wal-Mart is selling the single disc that won't have as many extras, so you may want to get the movie at Hot Topic.  When you buy it there, the DVD comes with a movie cell from the film.  From what I understand, they are planning cool stuff.  Or you could go from store to store checking out all the parties.  Get a photo cake of the cast of Twilight.  Kroger and probably Wal-Mart can take an actual photo that you bring in and put it on the cake.  You will be able to eat the whole cake, photo included.  Just print something off the internet and bring it, but call bakery's first to make sure they do the photo option.

At 16 you have a long future ahead of you, don't wait till your retired to pursue art if your serious, NOW is the time if you are serious. <br>  The older you get the more commitments and distractions will be thrown in your path. <br>  yes, it will be hard going, but if it wasn't everybody would be an artist. I'm on a part time college course for a Higher National Diploma wish I was your age again.<br>  Find out about local art groups or evening classes these are not expensive and will help you gain contacts, and advice.<br>  Please don't give up!|`|90Gf3ajvaa	Maybe you could do a short art course to develop your talent. Or possily go into art shops and see if they could help you. Maybe sendng things to magazines/newspapers/websites. I suppose you're going to have to start small, then work your way up. I wish I could've been more help.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Try going to Newcastle, Baltic Centre. It's an art gallery that buys art.<br>  Give it a try if you want. x|`|L2RP8kRFaa	Yes, there are jobs that will exchange art training(and hopefully pay) for your work.  Tattoo parlors may upgrade a floor-sweeper to a phone-operator to a sketch artist to a tattoo artist.  And a graphics company may take you on as a secretary or a mail-person or a ware-houser and let you help out in the art department when they're over-worked.  These are more exceptions however, and getting lucky enough to find a job like this will be difficult.<br>  <br>  I'm a graphic designer in the USA and after school, my first job was taking care of dogs at a kennel.  There, I had the means of paying for living necessities and the time to practice art.  <br>  <br>  I used that job to fund my tuition to a community college (not sure what the English equivalent is...) where I was able to take art classes and refine my skills.  I had the option of obtaining a basic degree and then transferring to a different college where I could get a more advanced degree in art.<br>  <br>  Employers like to see degrees or diplomas because it means that you're reliable and steady enough to invest the time necessary to complete them.  Even if there are people with better skills, you still have the knowledge and with job experience, you'll become more talented.<br>  <br>  I don't think the army is your only option, but you'll probably have to work some dead-end jobs to make ends meet while you're practicing art and/or going to school.  In the meantime, you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for that dream job.

QTxKxpMtaa	Dude- you really should learn how to dance. I didn't start until I was 42. Tons of women at these places, all eager to dance with men any age, size and shape. There is a definite shortage of men who know how to dance anywhere I go. I never sit down at a dance, and I almost never get refused. I have only been dancing 3 years and have gotten pretty good. Once women see you can dance, boy, look out.|`|02200970c8ed5e86bf84427d7244870eaa	It would be great for you, I think! I was always shy and sort of in a shell but dance brought about a whole new world and it's the best thing I've ever known. You should at least try it. No one can make you keep doing it if you don't like it. <br>  <br>  I am dancing in college and there are tons of guys in my classes. We all get a long well and have lots of fun.

Your parents are 100% correct. The boost in confidence and self-esteem are well worth it.|`|asxmrP9xaa	Yes, men should definitely learn to dance. I enjoy country dancing, and I'm perpetually looking for good dance partners. If you're shy, learning country dancing is a good place to start because they have specific steps (so you don't have to try to make things up as you go along). And the women almost always outnumber the men, so finding someone to dance with should not be a problem at all.|`|Sky9MrdCaa	go for it! male dancers are always in need, especially for partnering. Partnering would be great for you because you can get more comfortable with a girl (like touching her and holding her). then, as it becomes less awkward, like "oh i have to put my hand on her stomach and she has to hold my other hand..", you will be able to incorporate these skills in dating :)|`|a6GtqGCCaa	YES YES YES, not only does it make it easier to talk to women it boosts your self esteem through the roof.<br>  <br>  You just need to go for it.<br>  <br>  go for a trial lesson and if you don't like it don't go back but at least go for a test<br>  <br>  hope this helps xxxx|`|ftvxAS3saa	yes!!!!  dance dance dance, learn all types of dances, maybe u can woooo woo one|`|XeR3oN0aaa	Yeah go for it.

ScaAyzKHaa	For the First Crusade, Pope Urban convinced them Jerusalem had just recently been captured by Muslims and innocents were being slaughtered. People were happy to go off and 'liberate' it. The rest of them were just continuations of that theme, along with the usual reasons people went off to war at that time: younger sons needed to make money and names for themselves, see the world, adventure, etc.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	They were motivated by religion.  They believed that Jerusalem needed to belong to Christians, and that if they died in pursuit of this goal they would be rewarded in the afterlife.<br>  <br>  They might also not have a lot of exciting options at home.  Primogeniture meant all property was passed on to the oldest son, so younger children didn't always have many options to make a living.
2z1h5mfOaa	I am sorry but when you say French Revolution, it happened in 1789, and yes, there were revolutions going on in Europe around 1848, including in France, but they aren't the same and are not called "the French Revolution".

He was elected as president of the republic in December 1848 and became increasingly dictatorial.  He had posed as a champion of law, order and democracy prior to his election as president of the republic.  <br>  <br>  In November of 1852 a new plebiscite gave him the title of emperor of the French.  The Second Empire began and was divided into threee periods.  Until 1860 napoleonII ruled as absolute dictator.  From From 1860 to 1867, he lifted restrictions on civil liberties and widening the powers of the legislative assemblies, in order to garner increased public popularity.  The years 1867 to 1870 are known as the liberal Empire.  During this time the opposition gained great power under such leaders as Jules Favre, Emile Ollivier and Adolphe.  The time was marked by material progress, industrial expansion and imperialistic ventures.  Examples are the acquisition of Cochin China, the building of the Suez Canal, intervention in mexico and participation in the Crimean War.<br>  <br>  In 1849 French forces restored Pope Pius IX on his throne.  In 1859, following the Plombières agreement, he joined Sardinia in waging war on Austria.  Folowing his Pyrrhic victory of Solferino.  Napoleon III's separate peace peace of Villafranca di Verona antagonized the Italians.  The protectorate he had held over the papal states delayed their incorporation into Italy.<br>  <br>  The overestimation of France's military capacity on the part of Napoleon IIi contributed to the start of the Frnco-Prussian War of 1870.|`|oE1eCjRtaa	I have just finished doing this in history myself so here are a few basic things:<br>  <br>  feb 24---Louis-Philippe Abdicated,<br>  <br>  A temporary government was set up. The chamber of deputies rejected his grandson, (Louis-philippe wanted him to become the next king, which is why he abdicated)<br>  <br>  Chamber of dep declared France a republic and appointed a provisional government. However the socalist groups (who were based in the Hotel de ville, town hall) also set up a provisional government.<br>  <br>  They knew that this would cause rivalry so instead they compromised by Taking the chamber of deputies and added 3 socialist journalists, including Louis Blanc.<br>  <br>  The provisional government was made of 7 Moderates and 4 socialists.<br>  <br>  25 feb the tricolor was confirmed as the flag of the republic this was a win dor the moderates, but they did pass some of the laws that the socialists wanted to keep the peace.<br>  <br>  That's all we have done so far on this part, we do have more to do but we broke up for the holidays...

But its a good start.|`|GvxFdve3aa	i like it|`|E2GGUEBSaa	I would enjoy a slower build-up of her life and personality.<br>  Maybe some humour to lighten the tone, then hint at the arguments that occur and then introduce them.<br>  Maybe, she could be interrupted by an argument about something else (between her parents, not herself) mid-thought, before she gives up, dons the hoodie and leaves alone?<br>  The last part, introducing the danger, is OK, but gives any element of surprise away. We expect a climax, there's too much pressure from the beginning. Maybe everything's fine, she does the job, happy days! THEN danger kicks in. Maybe she witnesses a crime from the Inghams' house? I don't know what the danger is, though I'm intrigued.<br>  My opinion is it's too much too soon, and needs to slow down a bit. No rush, you can edit and change as much as you want later.|`|SyucfBnlaa	Omg!

vmmMqhxXaa	Danny from The Shining.  King really understands what it's like to be a very smart, very sensitive child in a scary world (as you pointed out about Bill from It).  Danny is likeable and entirely sympathetic.<br>  <br>  My second favorite:  Roland from the Dark Tower series.  In many ways he's the opposite of Danny:  he's neither vulnerable nor innocent.  He's singlemindedly driven, noble in some ways, flawed in others -- a complex and fascinating character.<br>  <br>  I also like his strong female characters:  Rose Madden, Lisey, even Annie Wilkes from Misery (nutty as my mother-in-law's walnut pecan pie, but outrageously funny...in a ghastly sort of way).|`|3uaN7eXQaa	I liked Ray Garraty (the lead kid) from the Long Walk<br>  <br>  I love Tom Cullen from the Stand (M-O-O-N that spells moon).<br>  <br>  I also like Dinky Evershaw from the short story "Everything's Eventual"|`|sI3BVNlFaa	All his characters are really memorable although I actually agree with you:<br>  <br>  Bill Denbrough is my favourite.  Not sure why, maybe because I can really sympathise with him. I can imagine him as the guy that everyone looked up to, although he probably went through the worst (having to face IT in the shape of his dead brother). <br>  <br>  Stephen King really knows how to capture the character and feelings of kids and how their minds work.  I love It because of the different characters and strong friendships that develop during the story.  <br>  (sorry for going off on a bit of a tangent...)|`|OaZk8It8aa	I love Nick Andros from the Stand, it's the first time I have ever read a book with a deaf-mute as a main character but they show his personality really nicely anyway, plus hes just really smart and a selfless but real sort of person with an interesting way of thinking to follow.|`|Bl9sJAydaa	I loved the lead kid from The Long Walk .. but dont remember his name. :(<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you like king, check out Mr. Build ( <a href="http://www.EvansKregBooks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.EvansKregBooks.com</a> )|`|RPYmXRDeaa	The apotheosis of all Stephen King's characters is Roland Deschain of Gilead from The Dark Tower series.

yOK32PM9aa	I don't agree.  They can be hell, it is true.  But in the context of Huis Clos (the play it is taken from) and his life overall, I think he doth protest too much.  Maybe he didn't get the adulation he craved on that particular day, but try telling it to someone who has lost a dear relative or has a painful illness.  Heaven is also other people.  Forgetting this makes one come across like a grumpy misanthropic child.|`|AA11635601	Ya people can be a constant irritant - you can get really sick of them, especially strangers, customers, bosses, people you don't really have any rapport with.  Close friends and loved ones, on the other hand, are the reason for living.  So it's odd - can go either way.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Other people make you change what you think of yourself through dialogue.

Its a rather cheap form of entertainment and self validation. <br>  Putting on airs with an elaborate vocabulary specifically designed to confound the average person they politely (with secret glee) make them look stupid without them realizing it.<br>  Words are the medium of truth so they constantly hunt for the right words in order to shoot the unicorn called truth and mount it on the wall.<br>  Present experience always eludes them so that they become an observer to every event even the ones in which they participate. <br>  They generally overestimate the roles that consciousness and reason play in everyday life.<br>  Philosophers may seem innocent and even noble. However, consider arrogance and tyranny----In the Republic, who would Plato have as king? --a philosopher. And Kant would just love to thrust his categorical imperative upon you.|`|BlA60kDVaa	We think about things very deeply.  We use a number of techniques such as socratical thought processes.<br>  <br>  Check out Albert Schweitzer or Emmanuel Kant for an example of great philosophers.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Anything they want.

asxmrP9xaa	Make sure you buy or borrow paperbacks, and carry them with you everywhere. Pull it out when you're waiting for the bus/ waiting for class to start/ before bed/ brushing your teeth... <br>  <br>  As for genre, I personally would suggest science fiction or fantasy because that's what I like best. Another thing you could do would be to get an anthology of whatever you think you're interested in (one of my favorites is Year's Best Fantasy) and figure out which authors you like best. Then you can go out and find their novels.|`|tL73W0VZaa	You set aside time for reading the same way that you set aside time for anything you like to do. <br>  <br>  As for what you should read, that depends. Chances are, if you've never read much before, you won't be ready to dive into Shakespeare or Charles Dickens. So, just think about what interests you. Look up your favorite movies, and see if they are based off books. If you love horror movies, then go through the horror section at the book store. If you like action or adventure, then browse in that section. <br>  <br>  Look at books that are set apart from the others and have their own stands, as they are the most popular. Pick up books with titles and covers that interest you, read the backs to see if they sound interesting, and then flip through the book (toward the beginning, so that you don't spoil the end for yourself) and see what you think of it. If a book seems interesting, but you aren't sure if you want to spend your money on it, then write the title down, and order it at your library, or see if you can borrow it from a friend. If you read a book and you like it, check to see what else the author has written, or visit a site called 'What Should I Read Next?' which will give you the names of similar books. You can also check out Amazon.com, which gives summaries of books, rates them, and tells you what other books are similar. <br>  <br>  I hope I helped!|`|MLzJGoZsaa	i would read whenever you have time, like instead of watching tv read, or if you can wake up early and stay up late. <br>  <br>  i would go to a library and look around because it depends on what type of books you like, just browse and if you see something that catches your eye, check it out and if you like it go onto amazon.com and see what other books are like it or by that author.|`|TAS1vdr9aa	Before bed ! It's very relaxing. :)|`|F5rI81Hbaa	I find  that for certain lengths of time I always stick to a certain genre, so start with a genre that you are interested in, and let yourself get roped in. If you really love reading, you won't need to make time.You'll want to read all the time (haha like me). I always lay out in the sun with my book, but don't forget sunglasses. The blinding white of the pages in the sun starts to hurt after a while haha.|`|SPvkz1kQaa	I think you should look for a book that you think you will really enjoy, maybe one recommended by a friend that has similar tastes to you. You should look around your local library or book store until you find something interesting, don't buy a book that you just like the cover of or one that you aren't really interested in.<br>  <br>  You should read whenever you find yourself doing something you don't really need to, like watching TV or using the computer because you will benefit more from reading than you would from those things.<br>  <br>  I usually set aside at least an hour to read each day, when I am having a break from other things. It is a lot easier to read a book you like than one you don't, so choose carefully as you don't want to put yourself off reading immediately by making the wrong choice and thinking all books are bad!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck in finding a book!|`|gtAb94d2aa	Well it really depends on what type of literature interests you.<br>  <br>  My brother who is 20 has a very similar reading taste to me, so I have a feeling you might like CHUCK PALAHNIUK. If you've ever seen the movie Fight Club, he wrote the novel that the film was based on. If you havn't seen it, I suggest you do! One of my favourite movies by far!<br>  <br>  So far I've only read the following novels by Palahniuk: Fight Club, Choke, and I'm halfway through Rant. Give those a try. Just carry them around with you on a daily basis to force you to set aside time to read them.<br>  <br>  He says the things we wish we could say, and has such an interseting way of saying them. And his ideas for his stories are somtimes so out there, yet seem very realistic at the same time. He makes us realize that there is no such thing as a 'normal' human being.<br>  <br>  His writing style may be better described by WIkipedia than me:<br>  <br>  The characters are people who have been marginalized in one form or another by society, and who react with often self-destructive aggressiveness. The narratives of Palahniuk's books often start at the temporal end, with the protagonist recounting the events that led up to the point at which the book begins.<br>  <br>  G'day!|`|8iHbDmHmaa	I read on my breaks at work.  It's great when I don't feel like making conversation with people lol.<br>  <br>  Like someone said, instead of sitting in front of the tv or computer, read a book instead.  There's always those times when there's nothing on, and instead of flipping brainlessly through the channels, pick up a book.<br>  <br>  When I am picking out new books, I grab one that looks interesting (by it's cover or title) and I read the first couple paragraphs.  If it doesn't catch my attention right away, I probably won't get it.  Different things may work for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck & happy reading!|`|Mumfvpuzaa	get some fresh air and sit outside to read while getting a tan (in the summer) <br>  read before bedtime<br>  read on your lunch break<br>  read instead of watching tv<br>  <br>  if you have a good book it's easier to find time to read than when the book is not enjoyable.

9Vgr5awOaa	I'd say try fanfiction.net, but (having a POB story up there myself) I know that the quality is probably not as high as your boyfriend would like it to be. I'd recommend (since he liked POB so much) to try reading some other Napoleonic Wars naval novels like Frederick Marryat, Alexander Kent, or CS Forester. Or he could go in a different direction and try Napoleonic wars army fiction by Bernard Cornwell, whose Richard Sharpe series is excellent.

When you love someone, you will make sacrifices for them.  It involves deep, emotional intimacy.<br>  <br>  Lust is hot and passionate.  You desire someone physically.  That's all it is.<br>  <br>  However, most long-term relationships are a combination of both elements.

sE0eZ9yYaa	Im not gonna lie, at first i really HATED Jacob, I was like "Why is this ignorant little kid trying to mess up Bella & Edwards relationship?" And then as the book progressed all I saw was was this really desperate guy to save the girl he loved. <br>  <br>  Okay, so the way Jake handled things werent always the best way...but I mean what other way does Jake know? If you read the books from an objective perspective instead of obessing over a particular character (which is fine if you like to) you can understand the characters decisions and emotions much better.<br>  <br>  Enough said...I'm team Edward all the way...BUT I do have a little soft spot for Jacob. He gets more than enough credit for trying any which way to "save" Bella's life from the worst possible outcome (to him).<br>  <br>  PS- Eclipse is my fave book!!! You just cant beat that kind of heart wrenching emotion (i.e when Bella makes out & consecuently breaks-up with jake and then cries for like 2days)|`|ee5LcXQraa	Aww, Jake's cute (not in looks from the movie, I mean his personality shown in the book).<br>  He's witty and fun, Edward is really serious, but I love them both.<br>  Like the author states, they're "Fire & Ice".<br>  Jacob is the silly, 16 year old, hormonal boy, whereas Edward is the 100-something, romantic Man.  They are totally different, and the little love triangle is part of the reason people love the books!|`|pgHlTuRnaa	Jacob can be a complete a ss<br>      *SPOILER*<br>  <br>  <br>  Like when hes like to edward leave bella and when he tells bella they cant be friends.

I'm sure if there was a poll 95% of Twilight readers would pick Edward over Jacob but they probably don't hate him. If so it would be because Edward hated him. (witch book our you on?)<br>  IF YOU AREN'T DONE WITH THE SERIES DON'T READ THIS!!!<br>  <br>  I personally think Jacob is better, I didn't like him more though until I found out how hot the actor was! lol <br>  Stephanie Meyer makes Edward the star of the book, and therefore people tend to like him more.

He kisses Bella without her consent and he even apologizes that he was disillusioned that she liked him. So, even he knows it lol.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I think a lot of girls who read Twilight are so passinately devoted to Edward that they are enraged by the idea that Jacob too likes Bella, and that she might be just alittle bit attracted to him.

I don't understand it myself, I like Jacob and I think he and Bella would have made a good couple.|`|v6CyvHLyaa	They're just racist.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Because the majority of people reading twilight are young tween girls, who are white.

You think they would be grateful right?  <br>  <br>  Well that's why, all subconscious prejudice taught by the public school system.|`|reHRXlZCaa	I don't dislike Jacob but he is written as a spoilt brat incapable of seeing things from anyone's perspective but his own, his background & his character aren't developed enough and when we finally get to see things through his eyes it's when events are about to spiral out of control, we get to see how loyal, brave & resourceful he is.|`|8BG2tqTGaa	i prefer jacob, he has more of a personality|`|vWKQJhwRaa	i luv Jacob Black!!!!!<br>  He's HAWT!!!!!!.....without the wig :D

No.  In fact I wouldn't be allowed to practice medicine until I finished my collegiate studies and many years on internship.  I firmly uphold that this should also be a rule for actors.  If you are interested in acting audition for a community theatre production.  If you like the feeling, do some research as far as acting schools go.  You can look into studying abroad (such as in New York, where schools are generally the most successful) or locally (possibly at a local university).  Keep in mind that everything you did in that community theatre will be wrong.  Professional and amateur acting are separated by a highly developed technique which the actor gains after years of training.  There is so much more to acting than just memorizing lines.  <br>  <br>  In summary: study, and study hard.  If you find yourself not willing to commit to such a task, accept that professional acting is not for you, and continue to involve yourself in community theatre.  Keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with being an amateur: amateur does not mean untalented, it literally means "for the love."  So by all means, if you find any reason not to commit years of your life, countless exercises which push you emotionally and physically to the limit, and thousands of dollars, to acting then find something else.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	Move to Hollywood.

Most of the participants, such as Adolf Eichmann and Reinhardt Heydrich were not nice people.<br>  <br>  The men responsible for setting up and administering the camps included Heinrich Himmler of the SS and Ernst Kaltenbrunner.

AA10276642	I need to first say that the whole notion of the "best college" for anything is totally bogus. Do you choose to eat only the "best" ice cream? What is that, anyway? Do you wear only the "best" shoes? Even if they pinch and give you blisters? Do you use the "best" shampoo? Are all hair types alike?<br>  <br>  Other people's ideas of what is best and what properties they choose to determine that are TOTALLY SUBJECTIVE. Not only does a dance college have to have the program you are looking for (for example, Juilliard and NYU/Tisch do not offer a focus in jazz), it should also have teachers who think you're wonderful and are going to pay a lot of attention to you. With all due respect to Rob-B, who definitely knows a lot about the dance world, the lives of male and female dancers are totally different. Male dancers are heavily recruited for dance programs at each step of the way. Female dancers have a lot more to consider.<br>  <br>  Dance education is not like learning an academic subject where everyone receives the same knowledge by sitting in a classroom and the teacher will always provide you with accurate information when you ask a question even if they don't like you. In a dance class, if the teacher is not interested in you, they won't bother correcting you, so you won't improve. If you're not selected to be in shows, you miss out on performing experiences.<br>  <br>  To the extent that there's a general "consensus" about which are the better college dance programs, the very fact that more people know about them means that more people are seeking to get into them. BY DEFINITION, then, the "better" the program, the harder they are to get into.<br>  <br>  So you're back to looking for the programs that are right for YOU. And, really, only you can answer this. It is NOT too early to start checking out college dance programs right now. You can start with the ones that are closest to you by going to see their shows. You might also be interested in making arrangements to go observe some college dance classes on a day that you're off from school. (High school spring break is a great time to do this.) Ask your dance teachers for recommendations. And if you attend summer dance intensives - which you really should do if you intend to continue with dance after high school - ask everyone what they know about college dance programs, as this is the group that networks more on a national scale and knows more about what's out there.<br>  <br>  P.S. Just keep in mind that New Yorkers are just a wee bit biased when it comes to programs that are in their city. Yes, NYC is the dance capital of the U.S., but they do not hold the monopoly on excellent dance programs. There are many other great programs out there. Get a copy of the Dance Magazine College Guide and carefully read through all your options:<br>  <a href="http://dancemedia.k-online.biz/cgi-bin/C4CF0A6C/mac/additmdtl.mac/showItemDetail?loadItem=08COLLEGE" rel="nofollow">http://dancemedia.k-online.biz/cgi-bin/C...</a>|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Funyuns.|`|5TgFBfY8aa	There are many dance colleges and universities out there. One that you may not have heard of yet is Oklahoma City University. OCU's Ann Lacy School of American Dance and Arts Management offers three unique dance degrees: Dance Performance, Dance Management and American Dance Teacher. Our school focuses on American dance forms, including jazz, tap, and ballet as used in musical theater. Our graduates can be found dancing all across the entertainment industry from Broadway to Las Vegas, from L.A. to Tokyo. <br>  <br>  The Dance Performance degree is for dancers interested in becoming a triple threat in the entertainment industry. Dance performance majors take classes in dance technique (jazz, tap, ballet, musical theater, pointe, partnering, rhythm tap, and more), acting, and voice. In addition to developing performing abilities, dance performance majors also learn to manage their careers through classes concerning professional standards and conduct, contracts, dancer’s health and anatomy. Dance performance majors also take classes in jazz, tap and ballet pedagogy and choreography, so they are also prepared for careers as teachers and choreographers as well as triple threat performers. <br>  <br>  The Dance Management degree is for dancers interested in dancing as well as the management of the arts. The dance management degrees supports a wide range of career possibilities for dancers. Dance management majors have a core of dance technique classes (jazz, tap, ballet, musical theater, pointe, partnering, rhythm tap, and more), arts management classes, and business classes. The arts management core of classes include: entertainment technology, non-profit management, fundraising and development, touring performing arts, presenting and sponsoring performances, contracts, stage management and costuming. The business core of classes include: marketing, economics, accounting, business law, business finance, statistics and management and organization. The dance management degree is ideal for a wide variety of dancers including dancers who would like have a performance career and then transition to a management career without having to return to college to supplement earlier training. Other dancers may want to work as a company manager, stage manager or another arts management position after college. <br>  <br>  The American Dance Teacher degree is for dancers interested in a lifelong career as an extraordinarily  well-prepared teacher. The new American dance teacher degree provides dancers with a depth and breadth of study never attempted by other dance programs. Dancers will experience a well-rounded program that includes instruction in: tap, jazz and ballet technique, tap, jazz and ballet pedagogy, dance history, choreography, anatomy and dance health, dance studio management, dance studio technology, marketing and advertising, contracts and management and non-profit management.

The earliest ruler on the King List of Sumeria whose existence has been authenticated is En-me-barage-si of Kish (ca. 2600 BC). <br>  <br>  The fact that his name is also mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh has led to the distinct possibility that Gilgamesh himself might be historical.<br>  <br>  We actually have records of pretty much ALL the Kings of Sumeria dating back long past 3000 BC.<br>  <br>  We might have another person we are positive of their existence besides En-me-barage-si of Kish, who knows.<br>  <br>  But in the existance of Kings, we have royal family lines, royal decrees, statues/pictures/depictions made during their time, the royal seal of King So&So, we know which cities they ruled over<br>  Homer was a story teller that got around, and probably never wrote his stories down.

ceBTTCPwaa	When I heard Steve Harvey had a book out on dating I rushed to the store to get a copy. Until recently, married PhDs have had the cornerstone on dating self-help and their advice has been lame, bad, and vague. I have found books by actual dating men to be quite refreshing and helpful on the subject. Books like The Manual: A True Bad Boy Explains How Men Think, Date, and Mate--and What Women Can Do to Come Out on Top by Steve Santagati (a model of all things) and God Is a Woman: Dating Disasters by Ian Coburn (a lesser known comedian.) These guys do things like attack dating norms, pointing them out to be stupid when they are. Like when Ian tells you how to date from momentum instead of from trying to keep someone interested. He points out you can control the first but not the latter. Really good, thought-provoking stuff these guys share and very effective, I've found. <br>  <br>  I thought Steve's book would build on this and go even more in the direction of analyzing and breaking down dating norms. His comedy is not only funny but also insightful, something alot of comedians lack. I thought his book would be like that. While there are some good points and a little thought-provoking, I found it to be a step backward to books like Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus: The Classic Guide to Understanding the Opposite Sex. It is all up to the women to get and fix the man. Men can have whatever fun they won't but we can't. We have to focus on landing one. No matter how successful you are, if you're a woman and you don't have a man you are missing out. There's too much of that old school thought in this book and that advice is unhelpful, archaic, and unoriginal. Save your money and borrow this book when a friend is done reading it. Sorry Steve. I still love your comedy, though!

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Without going too far into why its proponents believe it to be so, we can probably all agree that the primary component of emotivism is the notion that all moral statements are really ones that express a speaker's emotional reaction.  To an emotivist, when a person says "killing is wrong" they are really saying 'killing makes me feel bad' or 'I don't like it when killing occurs'.  This is pretty much what emotivism is.<br>  <br>  What makes it a form of moral subjectivism, then, is the subjectivity of emotions themselves.  If moral statments are emotive ones and emotive statements are necessarily subjective, then emotivism must be a form of moral subjectivism.<br>  <br>  Now aside from all the arguments about whether emotivism is actually so or not, it might be worth considering the possibility that SOME emotional statements are NOT subjective.  Most people get a little nervous around heights, after all, and almost nobody likes suffering in its thousand manifestations... at least not their own.  If we write off the few outliers as aberrations, it is conceivable that someone might argue that emotivism is not in fact completely subjective.  Your mileage may vary, of course.|`|AA11564934	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotivism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotivism</a>|`|yOK32PM9aa	In a nutshell, because everyone's emotions are different and therefore subjective.|`|yUudoO1Raa	Objective behavior may acknowledge the emotions one is feeling, but it also makes the choice to do what seems rational as opposed to acting from the emotions.<br>  <br>  Emotions are subjective, and we all have them. But the only way to find commonality among men is to put it aside, as we separate church and state. We should separate emotions and Reason, and choose Reason.<br>  <br>  This means that you "Do not say that you’re afraid to trust your mind because you know so little. Are you safer in surrendering to mystics and discarding the little that you know? Live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to the limit of your life. Redeem your mind from the hockshops of authority. Accept the fact that you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give you omniscience—that your mind is fallible, but becoming mindless will not make you infallible—that an error made on your own is safer than ten truths accepted on faith, because the first leaves you the means to correct it, but the second destroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error."

WshwHtk9aa	The most outlandish is to conclude that obesity is, in fact, not a problem at all, but a solution. We shouldn't overcome it, we should encourage it.<br>  <br>  Argue that fat people should be praised for their conservation of natural and financial resources. <br>  Oh sure, it *seems* as if they consume more than other people while they live, due to their obvious girth, but in reality, the fact that they die one, two, or more decades sooner than a healthy person actually reduces their total lifetime consumption - that when compared to a fit, still-kicking 80 year old, a fat, dead 48 year old has actually, on average, cut down 300 fewer trees, eaten 16 fewer cows and 312 fewer chickens, used 87,000 megawatts less electricity, consumed 43,000 fewer gallons of water, and saved 3141.59 pounds of fossil fuels (no more car or plane trips when you're dead!).<br>  And that's not counting the numerous financial savings. Peolpe who die young, even after some health problems, need no social security payments, have no medicare expenses, show no prolonged health problems or ongoing medical bills (would you rather pay for a really sick fatty for 5 years or a mildly sick fitty for 35 years?), plus, they pay their estate taxes to the government sooner. For private industry, the rotund also use fewer retirement benefits, reducing matching 401k costs by perishing 15 years prior to retirement and keeping annuity fund costs down. <br>  Just think, if GM had only offered up a free pizza bar to employees to encourage them to gain weight, the company might not have such upside down pension costs right now and would not be in risk of bankruptcy... <br>  <br>  Heck, the fat are virtual heroes! Eco-warriors and shrewd financial savers that benefit us all. More of us should take up their example.<br>  <br>  Plus, if you were to couple their already unhealthily beneficial lifestyle with higher junk food taxes now, they would gladly provide more income for the government while simultaneously subtracting expensive years from their life. <br>  <br>  Additional benefits include the fact that fat people are slower and easier to catch if they commit a crime, provide much needed income streams to manufactures who have to make everything bigger (and can therefore charge more for it), reduce global over-population and free up hard-to-come-by housing by dying sooner, and the fact is that their tallow-filled bodies can be melted down upon their death providing both heat and valuable biomass for making products like candles and soaps - which provides necessary goods while reducing the need to kill animals for their lard. <br>  One final benefit, while not looking to get too political, is that electing an obese politician is like selecting a natural form of term limits, keeping our corpulent governing body full of constantly fresh faces and ideas.<br>  <br>  All that and they prevent animal cruelty? It doesn't get much more Swiftian than that.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you want, much of the same can be said of smoking. We should encourage people to take up that habit, too. In fact, if people were only fat and downing two packs a day, the entire country would soon be on the road to easy street.|`|TODzjTczaa	The prevalent issue: obesity in america.<br>  <br>  The solution: universal bulimia!

iJzIIEdfaa	After the independence of India from British rule, the countries were split along religious lines. Muslim majority provinces were ruled by Pakistan and Hindu majority provinces by India. <br>  <br>  Pakistan ruled its present territory in addition to modern Bangladesh, then known as East Pakistan. Although East Pakistan held a majority in population (64%), the West Pakistanis (36%) controlled the economy, government and military disproportionately. <br>  <br>  In 1947 a Pakistani civil commission struck Bangla from the list of official languages of Pakistan, also removing it from stamps and coins and paper money.<br>  By the end of the year, there were public demonstrations and rallies in East Pakistan. Student organizations argued that Urdu wasn't even a native language of West Pakistan and that Bangla should be allowed for official use within the state. The brutal suppression of the protests by the police only increased unrest.<br>  <br>  In 1948 the Pakistani ruler, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, declared that only Urdu was the language of Islam and that those who disagreed were Enemies of the State. His government also proposed that Bangla be written with an Arabic script. <br>  <br>  These declarations were met with even more protests and demonstrations. These culminated on 21 February 1952, when students from the Dhaka University defied and were fired upon by police as they were organizing a rally. <br>  Their actions are immortalized in the song "Amar Bhaier Rokthe Rangano Ekushe February" which translates as 21 February Splattered with My Brother's Blood. <br>  <br>  These actions as well as the continued oppression of the West Pakistani government eventually led to the Bangladesh Liberation War in which the Pakistani army murdered over 3 million civilians, raped over 250,000 women and forced nearly 10 million Bangladeshis from their homes.<br>  <br>  This day is commemorated by the UN as International Mother Language Day and celebrated throughout many parts of the world as it is the only instance in history when people have laid down their lives to keep their own language in the face of oppression.|`|AA10729675	The movement started in 1948 and ended in February 1952.<br>  <br>  It was such that UNESCO adopted a resolution on 17 November 1999 proclaiming 21 February as INTERNATIONAL MOTHER LANGUAGE DAY.  I is an honour bestowed bu the international community of the Languafe Movement of Bangladesh.<br>  <br>  Pakistan was created in 1947, a brand new country.  It had to receive a name: Pakistan, "The land of the Pure".  Then, they had to decide on a national Language.  They opted for Urdu just as India opted for Hindi (the two being very similar but one written in Arabic alphabet, and the other in Sanskrit alphabet).  But the population was mostly coming from Bangladesh and was speaking Bengali or Bangala (Bangla).  So this created a movement which escalated.  The students got involved and fought the law which wanted Urdu and English as state languages.  They fought with the police and three students died. They are considered martyrs of the Language Movement.  They won.  The state languages are now Urdu and Bangla - since 1956.  Another one succumbed to his wounds.  A nine year old boy was also killed.  At the spot where they died, a memorial was erected.  In 1963, the temporatry structure was replaced by a concrete memorial, the Shaheed Minar (Martyrs' memorial).  <br>  So the significance is that it was a long fight, involving millions of people.  There were dead people, consiered martyrs and they won their case.  They also receive global honor for their deed.

Thank you for your question.|`|gspTDufpaa	We all see our own dreams.|`|05c920c9f1b5e4deb703e24090ba3744aa	Well, dreams are based off the things we see. The fact that we can recognize things as wild as a zebra that flies makes us have dreams. <br>  <br>  When you're born blind, you're brain never got to recognize any of those things except for sound. So when a blind person 'dreams', its usually a combination of sounds sometimes provoked by smells. <br>  <br>  So blind people don't see dreams unless perhaps they weren't always blind. But if they went blind at a very young age (one month old), then they're brain probably doesn't remember visuals from that far back.|`|fvPoiaAXaa	its obvious that they hear and taste in their dreams, if they've never experienced sight how could they imagine it? they could probably feel too maybe.|`|v6CyvHLyaa	They still have a working mind's eye.|`|RRJFI9Oqaa	All the senses depends on the development of respective centres in the brain. If born blind, there is no visual centre. They have no idea what the vision is. No light, no dark. There can be no memories connected to vision. <br>  So, dream can not be in a seeable form.|`|WwtUt6Pyaa	That is such an interesting question. Now i want to know.

I think they see what they think things would look like.|`|4gvw6nayaa	wow thats deep|`|EWb7yg7Maa	No.|`|1dzzgaGZaa	I don't think so, but they would sense them in every other way|`|AA11609300	I doubt they do because they wouldn't know what anything looks like in order to create a dream.<br>  I'm sure they dream conversations though.<br>  <br>  This is totally my assumption.  I don't know for sure.|`|FfeKzUycaa	I would assume they can if they've had vision before.  Otherwise if they do have dreams can they tell someone what they dreamed?  I wonder if they dream but without vision....like all dark?|`|4l2q4n1Baa	Yes they do!  <br>  <br>  But they dream i with sounds and such.  hard to explain but there you go.=)|`|64eea567c7ff43ccdfba58d650af4834aa	People who are blind do dream. The dreams of people who have been blind from a very early age (called “congenital blindness”) tend to be different from those who are blind now but had sight before. Those who are congenitally blind often have dreams that include more instances of sounds. Both groups experience dreams as imaginatively rich as those of sighted people.<br>  <br>  Whether or not congenitally blind people dream in images has been studied, but the findings have been mixed – some studies conclude that congenitally blind people do not dream visual images, while other reports conclude that they do.<br>  <br>  Helen Keller addressed the topic of dreams in her landmark work, The Story of my Life. Her dreams are discussed in Part. III, Chap. V|`|AA11691546	No. I've seen a docutmentary on a blind person who was asked this same question.  There's no point of reference; if you have no working memeory of visual images, it's impossible for them to have visual thoughts in dreams.|`|WVd2S6xWaa	Clinical research has shown that blind people hear dreams.  They have also been known to taste dreams<br>  <br>  try searching yahoo answers before asking. about a hundred people have asked this so dont be a dumb****|`|D0dWmhFxaa	Of course. Just because you can't see the world around you does not mean you can't see your own world, the one in your head...<br>  <br>  and if we want to get really philosophical, who is to say the world we see is the real world? maybe the real world is the one in our heads...<br>  <br>  ooooo :)|`|11UC8GcGaa	well since they have never seen anything....i would assume that it would be impossible for them to create a visual dream....however they probably have dreams...of feeling, sounds, taste......but im just giving my educated opinion....idk the facts|`|ewOD5x0taa	I love how you capitalize Blind Person.|`|2nsUmrV5aa	They dream blind.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: for example, take one of your dreams but take out the pictures and visuals and thats dreaming blind:)|`|Xcwm4gCNaa	Well, they are blind but I would of asked the same as you, i mean why could not they see dreams???

v6CyvHLyaa	It depends on the person reading it, sweet pee. I like both well written, profound books and badly written but entertaining ones. I'm easy to please.|`|6lkNOFNlaa	I like a book that's well written to start with, and a writer who knows her target audience.<br>  I love suspence through a book so that I'm not guessing the right answers. Predictable books are boring.<br>  Characters that I can relate to are also needed and a wide variety of characters helps. I love Harry Potter because of how many characters there are. Not only are there so many characters though, we get to know each one throughout the series and are not just given loads of information about them that we are expected to remember. That is also what a good book needs.<br>  <br>  I don't really chose a book because it's a romance, or a fantasy etc. I read it if it seems to have an interesting plot.<br>  <br>  I love happy endings but I also love tragic endings. I don't like endings to be too happy, where a character has got everything she wants because that is boring and a total let down.<br>  <br>  I love the small parts probably more than the bigger parts, for example, I love a character's consistent humar, and that's another thing. A book needs to be consistent in it's characters behavior and it's style of writing. I can grow to love it one way and when it changes suddenly in the middle, I kind of feel put out and let down.<br>  <br>  Big things are important, but it's the small things that really count. Saying that, if you are writing a novel, don't go and write the small things really obviously because then it becomes cliche and not so small anymore.|`|hQWucH5uaa	The talent of the writer is the sole determiner of a good book.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the subject, it the writer cannot handle grammar, syntax, and stylistics, he or she would not be worth reading.<br>  <br>  So the author's ability to handle: pathos, bathos, ethos, logos, logic, and irony are essential to any "good" book.<br>  <br>  Please look up these terms.|`|lJhB4GSnaa	To me a 'good" book is something that has me wanting to keep reading, has relatable, yet unique characters, has enoguh action in it to stay interesting. I know a lot of people might disagree but i don't like happy endings, I like bittersweet endings.

People are divided within themselves, they are a mixture of many "I's" some so different from one another, some in the mind, others in the body, and others within their emotions. I see nothing about man that is both conscious or indivisible. To say one has a strong sense of "I" is to say that one has a indivisible "I" that they can sense, see, and feel. But this is not the case, in life people are mostly, if ever conscious of themselves, and at any point if they were they would know how fragmented they are. <br>  <br>  We only discontinue from it, if "It" is run by only external forces/stimulus. But if we develop it, and gain a degree of unity, through struggle in a right manner and our actions further become a expression by our own volition, that is we begin to have a united will and move by "I", truly, then it death can not claim it.|`|RLqmrHlIaa	You think life is reality.

Does it have a fixed state, given that we are changing every moment? I don't think so.<br>  When our lives are based on the physical reality of our bodies, why is death discontinuous with that? It's completely random of you to say that it might be so. <br>  <br>  I could say: Given that elephants are big, with a habitat in africa, is an baby elephant in America discontinuous with reality? <br>  It's crazy!<br>  <br>  Have a nice day.
AA12339318	A lot will depend on the conditions for which you want to protect the camera.  If you intend diving to any significant depth, you'll just have to shell out bucks for specially made housings.  And, by significant, I mean even in as shallow a depth as a dozen feet or so.<br>  <br>  But, if you only intend to protect the equipment from incidental splashing, I have used those one gallon zip lock bags successfully on rafting trips.  I secured part of the bag around the lens with rubber bands. (this was a digital camera with no movable focus or apreture rings on the lens)<br>  <br>  There probably was some effect on image quality, but not so much that it was noticeable.  The bag was clear enough and the auto focus managed to percieve the proper distance.  My biggest concern was not so much getting the camera wet, but for losing it if I went in the water.  I couldn't figure out how to strap the camera around my neck, so I just held on.|`|0LgpcOBDaa	Underwater housings are made to fit cameras like dentures in your mouth.

HSIi8qOWaa	Well! If you want to read something that's a classic book about this topic, I recommend The Awakening by Kate Chopin. This is my favorite book of all time. It was written in the 1800s, a time when women weren't allowed ANY independence. The main character, Edna, decides to go against society's constraints. She has an affair, she decides to leave her husband and her children, and ultimately, she learns that she is ahead of her time. It is a wonderful book, and I recommend that EVERY WOMAN read this book.|`|pgrWxz08aa	i just got done reading one of those kinds of books..<br>  <br>  Killing me Softly-By:Nicci French<br>  <br>  this book is probably what your looking for...|`|DJOEV2TDaa	Well this isnt really about an affair, but it is about a very ODD and strange, very unlikely romance between a woman and a very different kind of man.

Most guys would prob. just leave the girl alone and get on with life. And not to sound like a jerk; but that's actually my advice to u. I just got married myself; and I couldn't even begin to imagine how I'd react if something like that happened on my wedding day. But I'm pretty sure most of my friends' response would be "2 words: Strip Club!" And that's prob. exactly what I'd do. Your intentions are no less than honorable; but it's not your job, and it's impossible, to save every lost soul u come across. She knows how and where to find u if she wants to come back. Aside from that- I'd say u've done all u can.

You say you don't want anything from her.  Why do you want to help her with her life?  She doesn't seem to need anything.  She was working and making a living.  She is going to do that again.  What you should do is ask yourself why you think you get to have two wives.  Were you going to promise your fiance that you would love, honor, and cherish her in sickness and in health, till death you do part?  What if she became mentally ill?  Would you lie again and break your second "vow?"  <br>  "Oh what a tangled web we weave!"  So what are you going to do?<br>  If you really want to help her, what would be the way to do that?

dQmFoRRiaa	Line three of your first stanza has the correct syllable count but not the iambic feet required.  The rest of the stanza is fine.  In your free verse, there is some nice phonology, but 'butter-yellow' is a compound adjective and could use a hyphen.  L2 of the concluding stanza is slightly irregular metrically, but only slightly.  "...counterpanes of sacrificial leaves" is a beautiful and extraordinarily potent metaphor, recognizing that life's seasonal turn is a sacrifice.  We too die to the world and are reborn from within.  As Elaine has already suggested, your first and last lines must be the same.  A nice poem and a Dorsimbra in the making.

I might be having problems in life,  But Ill find my own way to deal with them.  Like the moon,   All calm and nice,  I might even disappear,  If a stronger person,  Like the Sun,  Comes and hides me for a time being!    I wont run away,  Ill face it,  Ill stand there,  And the problem will gradually diminish.  I might cry a little,  To help myself feel good.  But to others,  Ill spread light,  So that they dont see the spots on my skin.    I will not change my ways,  Ill be the way I am,  And if someone tries to intimidate me,  Ill calmly be there,  Smile as always,  And accept the,  I am the way I am,  And so Ill always be!    This tiny moon,  So big enough for a while,  Can hide the mighty Sun,  If it comes in the way.  Like an eclipse,  Ill grab my chance,  If youll be irritating,  Ill doom you!        i've to be quick,  or else i'll be late,  i have to cope up with the others,  who are much more efficient than me.  but the journey is too long,  and time is running out,  i can't take a break,  or i'll be out of the race,  of the journey called life!    And as I move on,  Ill have to ask them,  If theyll ever remember me,  As who I am,  Or who Id be?    I dont want to lag behind,  Im in a journey of time,  And those who stay back,  Many are happy,  But Ill be the one of those,  Wholl sit and cry there.    So before one such day would come,  Let me open my eyes wide,  For all those dangers out there,  And lead the race,  And complete it in time.

oytbZuIkaa	In my opinion, we are ALL equal human beings, however, some people think they are superior to others and look down at them. Also, the people who are rich or well off seem to live better, get treated better etc. in society, so although in theory we are all equal, in practice, the ones who are not so well off will not always get treated with the respect or equality that they deserve...|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I think we are all the same, we sin, we laugh, we cry, we all have pain and sorrow, we have all been let down, and let others down, we all have victories, and we all have losses.

People who think they are superior are just smug and arrogant.|`|O15my3olaa	It is quite impossible to compare accurately one individual with another because everyone is unique.    How would one determine factors like intelligence, creative skills, talents, level of command of language and knowledge of numerous subjects, looks, health, wealth, and many others.    Everyone would also have his own set of weaknesses and strengths, thus there are really no yardstick. And it is also unfair to say that tribes and people living in Third worlds are inferior to those living in First worlds where there are also 'inferior' persons who are not educated, skilled or cultured. The use of such words in civilized society is most unwise and unacceptable because it may lead to social tensions and disharmony. Let's just accept all persons of any gender, race or nationality should be treated equal.|`|K7z5rkOVaa	Of course there are superior and inferior people! But I would think the people listed under superior or inferior would change as you changed the criteria.

EktKaBXuaa	I was just searching this question (or a question similar to this) on google and a link to your question came up. I have just read that 81% of people want to write a book. And Im part of that percent. I read soemwhere that most people want to write a book even if they dont even have a story idea, but they just might want to write a book because they like the idea of becoming an author or want to be rich.     But if i became a writer I think ill use a pen name. I don't want my whole world too change in the off chance i become famous or anyhting (which i doubt.)    It really is my dream to write a book. I imagine flipping through the pages of a book I have written. And it would make me extremely proud if it was a best seller but I really don't think i'll ever finish the book (I have been trying to write the first chapter for a year now. And all I do is fill up my recycle bin with waste) I have an idea. That I have. But I can't write the beginning. And everytime I throw away the beginning it seems like the whole story has been changing for the better. And I am happy and am suddenly realizing a quote that said something along the lines of "We have to write 100000 words before we write something good.    Yeah I agree with you about the any ideas for my plot kind of thing. I mean i've been tempted to say that. I might have asked my bro for a few ideas for my story (not that he answered me or anything.) but its not your own story if you get your ideas from someone else. It bothers me that a chachter has the same name as someone in the twilight books because I don't want to be told I was copying the name when I wans't. Oh Well. Reading twilight has let me think if i should add a smidge of romance in my story. Or the question what should I name my story. Its your story. We can't name it just by a little summary of what you've written. And I don't mean to be mean to anyone whos done that, this is my own personal oppinion, I think its quite funny actually.     I guess it would be cool to be the next stephenie meyer. I love stephenie but her books arn't my favorite. I'm more team rowling. I just think the plot is better. I do like the twilight books though.     I guess I jsut write because I have an idea and I don't want to waste it. I spend hours thinking about my idea pretendign I'm the character or something. I love the characters I've created and the enviorment there in. And even soemtimes its a pain to write and then throw out the chapter every single month. I find I like it better to just write from the middle of the story or write the intresting parts. And then I really enjoy writing because its creating the life in your mind on paper.|`|0K9p9OPfaa	Not everyone writes a story because of Stephanie Meyers.  Last time i checked people enjoyed writing too.  Not just for money and fame.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I haven't read "Twilight'" or seen the film adaptation, so I can't use that as an excuse.  Why do I write?

The first offical finished draft I have worked on is similar but my second piece is actually opposite, it's more like Narnia.     Seriously, I went to a bookstore one day and spotted so many vampire books and novels now. My reaction was...GAH! Being attacked by a vampire trend! I'm actually far over the whole 'Twilight phase' only because I liked it before the movie began production and now it's just a trend.    Anyway, writing creates a much better reality then what we really see in the real world. To me, writing is like a dream that I can enter at any time especially when I need to be alone.    :D|`|Q7Ed9UHIaa	I like doing Fan Fiction at the moment, it gives me alot of practice.

I think most people just want to write and getting to be a best seller is just a bonus. Writers write, lucky writers get paid to write.  Maybe we should blame NaNoWriMo.|`|dPZJ7GTiaa	1. People like to read, so there's a market for it and a lot of demand for new material    2. People often get creative and like to share what they come up with. (I'm working on 10 different plots right now, three of which I want to turn into a series. (not with each other)    3. Most people THINK writing is easy, so it's an easy hobby to attempt. Then they get into it and find out it's NOT all that easy, so they either stick with it or drop out, but either way, some fun short-stories might come out of the "drop-outs".|`|8411085d73dfc634c33d30af14909a59aa	Writing is a form of art, just like music and painting.

The dream of becoming a famous and rich person is universal and can take many ways (some dreams about acting others of book writing and sport stars).    Its many people out there that writes books and good books without becoming superstars and blockbuster seller but its a very slim chance to become the next Rowling. So while its a good and admireble thing to write its nothing worth giving up school or everyday work. Johan.|`|Yj9k39Utaa	I write cause well... I want to write. I love it. It's just something I enjoy because it comes naturally.  And I've never read Twilight, although I watched the movie and found it alright. I like the plot idea of vampires but from what I've heard, her main character Bella is quite mary sue which off sets me.  Anyway, there are so many other brilliant authors out there that inspire people to write, like J.K Rowling, Stephen King, Holly Black, J.D Salinger. From how I see it, people write because it gives them some sort of pleasure, because if it didn't, then why write?|`|Iwk92vqyaa	I've answered some of the questions you mention. Others are impossible to answer. To your 'details,' I would add "What are good character names?" even before an idea.     1. I think many young people read books they like a lot, see it is easy reading, and want to write something themselves. No harm in it, if realization arrives through it.    2. If a young person (often very young) reads only one or two series, even more, plus a few books required at school (please, young writers, read those with interest), and maybe a popular classic or two (frequently Pride and Prejudice; good book, but there are many more): the thought they can just 'write a book' like they've read, slightly differently, is a frequent trap, done without awareness.    4. I realized I did that when I was nine; I had only re-written a couple of favorite books. It was a eureka moment, not disheartening. I recall thinking: I need to have adventures of my own!    1: I greatly increased the scope of my reading to all genres & types.    5. I wrote a few short pieces and urge new writers to do the same (for local papers, etc.) and generally kept my eyes open to all around me, always ready for adventures.   I had many. Still do.     6. After university and post-grad writing courses in everything from journalism to writing plays, I was off and running. First as a journalist (many adventures) and still on the short fiction writing, back in the days when magazines picked up reasonably good stories a lot. It was all good. One play I wrote was even produced to success (lots more money in that than I'd suspected). Made my living as a writer, editor and tutor.     7. Now I'm retired, but working on my first book with an editor and agent, a biography of a very elderly, very witty and experienced friend.  Doubt the bio will be a 'best-seller.' The person is not famous or weirdly fascinating: just a person who was really 'there' all her life and lived with both gusto and deep meaning. Interesting to me; probably not to many. [Editor and agent like it though.]    *8*. What is needed for young writers is to read ALL kinds of books, always stretching for more depth, etc.; to first write short pieces, learning how to write; and to go out and LIVE, with the eyes and ears of a writer. Then maybe think about a book.    ADD: Regarding your addition: yes, I love to write & to re-write. Witness: this answer.|`|Syuk7XsVaa	they think that it is so easy to write a book and they want the fame and fortune sge has gotten - they don't realise that actually SM was very lucky -a- that someone was silly enough to publish her "saga" and -b- people were dumb enough to read it and like it.     I'm from Uk and the twilight buzz only really cam around when the movie was released so i have 100% confidence in saying that when i started writing my book in Dec 2007 - i was in no way influenced by Twilight and am thankful to say that it is in no way similar- no "vampires" or "hot dudes with abusive tendancies"
0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	The League of Nations was afraid to act and in their fear, they emboldened Hitler to go for more.
rtsfPQqMaa	The Jews did not kill Jesus- Crucifixion was alien to the Jews- In the Old Testament it states "for he that is hanged is accursed by God"    The Romans did, capital punishment by crucifixion was common during the Roman Empire and used for people who where traitor to the State and the Emperor. Crucifixion was public humiliation, victims were not supposed to die soon. Suffocation was how you die on the cross, the head would eventually droop forward and oxygen deprivation set in. So to delay the death a single piece of wood was attached behind the abdomen that could be sat on or by the feet to stand. After a few days if the victim had not exhausted his strength soldiers broke the legs.  Tens of thousands of men were executed on the crucifix; To the Romans Jesus preaching was a betrayal to the Roman State and the Emperor.    Now, Anti-Semitism has been commonplace since the creation of the Old Testament, when it was written in Genesis- "your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates" - known as the Promised Land. It has transformed multiple times in history to amalgamate new theories and ideas for both political and religious purposes.    Hitler claimed that Jews were enemies of the Aryan race. He held them responsible for Austria's crisis. He also identified certain forms of Socialism and Bolshevism, which had many Jewish leaders, as Jewish movements, merging his anti-Semitism with anti-Marxism. Later, blaming Germany's military defeat in World War I on the 1918 revolutions, he considered Jews the culprits of Imperial Germany's downfall and subsequent economic problems as well.    But Hitler's rise to power was not based on his ideological principles regarding the Jews; it was cemented by his ability to initially ameliorate many of the problems Germany faced after WWI.    This is all to say, that the persecutions of the Jews during the Holocaust were not karmic punishment or divine retribution, and while it is definitely a modern example of such pogroms, I dont believe it will be the last.|`|t79pLOCUaa	The occupying power at the time was the Romans.  They killed Jesus. The Jews had little to do with it.  And no I don't believe your question.  Hitler was a product of 1500 years of European antisemitism.|`|xQwU590Laa	NO, absolutely not.  If God wanted Jesus to die, so he could be resurrected than he could hardly want to punish them for it.|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	Of  course not. For a start I don't believe in divine retribution. And if there was such, and if the Jews had such a guilt (which I don't accept) why did the Almighty wait nearly 2000 years to wreak revenge?|`|G2JHunHjaa	I am shocked to see such bigotry allowed in Yahoo Answers|`|xfqHi1tRaa	No, since the Romans did it!  Besides, one must remember Christ was Jewish!|`|AA10405801	Obviously you know nothing about Christianity, or you wouldn't need to ask this question.    The Jews did nothing that deserved punishment.

It definitely was not my favorite book of the series and I felt like it ruined it to an extent, but then it did do well at accomplishing a few things-- it takes us further into the story and tied it all up while still opening doors for other books about these characters.  IF SMeyer wrote from another perspective, I know I would read it.|`|WTXvmcxcaa	What are you talking about?!!! Not all books are perfect you know! If you thought it ruined the series, then why don't you rewrite it and see how easy it is!!! :P|`|oyjP2mZBaa	Definitely not me,<br>  I think it put a good ending to all of it.<br>  Bella ended up with her man,<br>  Jacob fell out of love with Bella,<br>  and no one got hurt.<br>  <br>  I think it's kind of freaky how Jacob fell in love<br>  with Bella's daughter, though, haha.<br>  Imagine explaining to your kid that her boyfriend once<br>  made out with you.<br>  Geeeez!|`|AA12320240	i think it did because she could keep wirting about the cullens and it would make me happyier if she did but i didn't like having jacob life in the book it was weord not to read it as bella|`|h3NJO9dWaa	I loved it, I thought it was great.

I was reading it and was just constantly thinking 'WTF was she HIGH on when she wrote this???'<br>  <br>  It took me ages to read as well. I just had to keep stopping because I was so disgusted with the awful predictability of it.

He really makes you think about people, motives, religion, life in general... but he has a really humorous, dark approach to the whole thing. I recommend Survivor for what you're describing. But, Fight Club and Haunted will also make you think about a lot of things. Any of his books, really. Just trust me. :]<br>  <br>  Kurt Vonnegut is similar, but he wrote his books many years earlier.

5HbA73qAaa	some people have described the sound of silence as deafening.  The above verse / stanza describes a person walking the streets at night thinking.  It is an old or reproduced street and the cobblestones are uneven which reflect the restlessness of his thoughts and dreams as he jumps from one to another.  the street lamp shines down and on the pavement the light forms a circle which 'halo' is an illuminating metaphor of.  the person is trying to shut out negative thoughts - the cold and damp bit.  Their solitude is disturbed and they are brought forcibly back to reality with a stab of neon light from a sign.  The flash rips the dark night apart and further illuminates the scene - lines 5 & 6 are violent - this is done to them against their will.  with the splitting of the night silence is there - perhaps it has quietened his/her thoughts?? As the first answer said I would research the last line a bit more...

We humans were zygotes then babies, then teens, then mature, then old, then dead.    View of Islam scholars as believers in Creator,    One person who knows all the letters in alphabet  and who can write words with these in mind, knows very well this;     after writing down "fish" , it is not required to use the same letters in "fish" to write down "frog". Therefor, Creator Who created fish, is able to create frog, monkey and man separately. Every specie comes from its own ancestor and is going to end with a descendant from its same specie.    There is not transformation from one specie to other, if it would be so plane tree would have come from parsley.

Within that cycle evolutionary growth and decay exist.|`|VA2Sb4Q8aa	Suppose I tell you that GOD HIMSELF is evolving; what will you say?   In fact every thing is evolving; including GOD. Look at this from VEDIC point of view.  In RIG-VEDA there a lot many hymns on beginning and creation. I quote just on Hymn.  " In the beginning there neither nought nor aught,  Then there was neither sky nor atmosphere above.  What then enshrouded all this universe?  In the receptacle of what was it contained?  Then was there neither death nor immortality,  Then was neither day, nor night, nor light nor darkness,  only the Existent One breathed calmly, self contained". (Rig. 10-121-1)    Hymns like this are in line with the theory of BIG-BANG, which says that the entire universe is a result of a big-bang out of nothing. This theory also says that the universe is ever expanding. Old starts are dying and new stars are being created. And after the force of big bang reduces the universe will collapse and come back to original form of nothingness. You may read "Brief History of Time" by Stephan Hawking.    I believe this entire universe is GOD, which is evolving every minute, every second. We are just a small fraction of a fraction, and we are part of that God which is always evolving and expanding.  Therefore it will not be wrong to say that GOD HIMSELF is evolving.|`|suKoM2owaa	god only fits in the brains of religious people because of all the empty space there...|`|PFncnta2aa	Replace abiogenesis with "godidit".

They were written down as (a) guidance on leading a good life; (b) in some cases, as a written record of what had been handed down orally as creation myths and a history of a particular peoples. Do not rely on them as an accurate scientific explanation of the creation of the world (Creationists are really the silliest people in the world today) or as an accurate historic account (if God sent an angel to save Shadrach, Meshach and Abenego for the Burning Fiery Furnace, why didn't the do the same for the millions of Jews slaughtered by the Nazis?).

Jesus was never considered a God nor the son of God until AD325 at Council of Nicea where he was voted by men to be so and by doing so those in power were able to manipulate the Bible and by the teachings of Jesuss as they pleased Pagan Chrisitians have manipulated the true person of Jesus the Messiah into being a representation of the son in order to allow their followers to indirectly worship the sun.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	None -- or all.  It depends upon your own religious beliefs or lack thereof.|`|nRnokrwKaa	As this question is posted in the history section I shall answer from a historian's point of view.  None of the 'holy books' are historically verified. Right from the Iliad and the Odyssey, which laid down the pantheon of the 12 Olympians worshipped by ancient Greek and, to an extent, Roman, religious men and women, all the way up to the Bible and the Koran, which are the more recent religious handbooks, all have dubious validity in the historical record, although it may be argued that they were based on real people and circumstances. The Iliad, for example, is argued by many classical historians to be based on a Trojan war that actually happened, but it is unlikely that, if he did fight in it, Achilles duelled with the river Scamander, or that, in his duel with Hector, the Gods passed his spear back to him after he had thrown it and missed, allowing him to win while Hector could only use his sword.   I see the more modern handbooks in a similar light. I believe it likely, due to Roman records, that a 'Jesus' actually existed, but I believe that his miracles etc must be falsified as there is only one source attesting to them-the bible- and those who wrote the bible had much to gain from publicising such miracles.   I as such, provide another example which may clarify. Alexander of Macedon, (i.e. 'the great') fancied himself a god, and publicised himself as one, even insisting that people greet him in the traditional persian greeting for a God; by prostrating themselves in front of him. Legends of his divinity are attested to and publicised by his successors, the likes of Ptolemy, Antigonus, Seleucius, etc, but these men had much to gain (divine validation of their rule of portions of his empire, to be exact) from publicising him as a God. A book was even written, the Alexander Romance, which provides a false history of his life in which he encounters everything from flying horses to the depths of the ocean. Because we have detailed knowledge of him as an important historical figure, however, other, more likely alternatives of his life are available, which are those considered to be true over the 'Romance'. Hence, Jesus and the others just weren't important enough to be considered historically relevant, only mythologically so.    So, in answer to your question, none of them are right. In fact, from a historian's point of view, the only criterium there appears to be for a book to be 'holy' is that it is not based on historical facts.|`|x0flaLfUaa	None and all, they are all open to interpretation.

They also try to explain (often wrongly) what are now known as scientific reasoning for the world, universe, etc.  But remember that this is because they were the "educated" of their day and did their best at trying to explain the inexplicable.  If they did not know then "it was the will of GOD".|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Did you know that the bible of the Hebrews demands that raped women have to be executed ?

The New Testament is no older than 2000 years old and less. The father of History, the Greek Herodotus lived 500 years B.C. but we still give credibility to his accounts. You can believe the Bible or not, but there is a lot of truth recorded, make of it what you will. Not believing because you do not want to is ridiculous. Socrates did not write anything.  The dimensions of Noah's Ark are accurate for a ship of that size.  Jesus was born and died as recorded. The Disciples did live and were kn own in their day.  St. Paul was a Greek Roman Citizen educated in Jerusalem by the Pharisee Gamaliel.He was beheaded during the purge of the Christians by Nero, St. Peter was Crucified. No, as a minimum, the Bible is a recording of History. Again make of it what you will.

A group of scholars called the Cannon decided what was genuine and should be included in the Bible.

Hence the good news of Jesus Christ, who died to take the punishment of our sins upon himself. For those who have faith to believe.  Jesus taught a new way, as recorded in the New Testament.

They are really good and I don't want to spoil them!<br>  <br>  READ THEM!!|`|KtLG7HJtaa	i'm sorry but there is too much info to answer|`|R9175t9naa	The first book, the Uglies, is about this girl named Tally Youngblood. She's about to turn 16. In Tally's world, when you turn 16, you get to have a special operation so you become "pretty". Everyone else that didn't turn pretty is called an "ugly". When you become pretty, you become supermodel gorgeous. Tally's best friend, Peris, had been turned pretty because he was just a few months older. Now then, Tally meets a new friend named Shay. Shay isn't really sure she wants to be pretty. She has had contact with rebels who live outside government control in a hidden refuge called the Smoke. She doesn't want to become a pretty, and instead escapes to the Smoke just prior to her birthday. When Shay invites Tally to come to the Smoke with her before she leaves for the Smoke, Tally refuses to join her. Shay leaves alone but gives Tally a note of cryptic clues to the Smoke's location, should Tally change her mind. Tally then promises never to reveal the Smoke's whereabouts.<br>  <br>  Tally's excitement about becoming a pretty disappears when her operation is preempted with an ultimatum from the city's secret police organization, Special Circumstances. A "special", Dr. Cable, tells Tally that she cannot become "a pretty" until she reveals Shay and the Smoke's location. Forced by Special Circumstances to find and infiltrate the Smoke using Shay's directions, Tally changes her mind about becoming "a pretty" shortly after arrival and meeting its charismatic leader, David, with whom she starts to fall in love. She learns from his pretty parents, Maddy and Az (who no longer have lesions), that the pretty operation does more than just change appearances: more specifically, it makes people docile and more compliant with authority by creating lesions in the brain. Despite Tally's effort to stop Special Circumstances from arriving at the Smoke, they track her anyway, destroying the Smoke and capturing all but Tally and David.<br>  <br>  Tally and David mount a successful rescue operation on the Special Circumstances headquarters, returning with their friends to an abandoned "Rusty Ruins" city. David's dad (Az) has died and Shay had turned into a pretty with lesions in her brain. Maddy discovers a cure for the lesions but Shay refuses to take them. Tally decides to sacrifice herself for Shay. Maddy wants to cure the "lazy vanity"[3] created by the surgical brainwashing done to pretties, but needs a willing subject to test its efficiency and safeness. Tally volunteers to return to the city to undergo the pretty operation and then be the test subject. The story closes as Tally turns herself in to the city authorities, saying, "Make me pretty."<br>  <br>  <br>  The characters are:<br>  Tally Youngblood: The main protagonist of the trilogy.<br>  <br>  Shay: One of Tally's best friends.<br>  <br>  David: Tally's boyfriend(not until the middle of the book) who has lived his whole life in the wild (as one of the Smokies). He is the son of Maddy and Az.<br>  <br>  Maddy: David's mother, and was once a surgeon for turning Uglies into Pretties, along with her husband, Az.<br>  <br>  Az: David's father, and was once a surgeon for turning Uglies into Pretties. He was captured and killed during an operation led by Dr. Cable.<br>  <br>  Croy: One of Shay's friends who lives at The Smoke.<br>  <br>  Peris: Tally's best friend since they were littlies.<br>  <br>  Dr. Cable: Head, or leader, of the Specials of Special Circumstances<br>  <br>  I'm only giving a description of the first book because after reading the first book you pretty much have an idea of what the sequels will be about. Personally I think it's a really good series.|`|yYQJS2paaa	ok so its set in the future and the world is basically trouble free. In this time as soon as you turn 16 you get "the operation". which is like a way better version of plastic surgery where they change nearly everything about you. If we all lived in that time we'd all be considered Uglies even the best looking person in our world.<br>  <br>  I wont ruin the middle bit but theres a problem with the operation where they pretty much take away your free thought. so you pretty much go along with everything and you stop reacting to things quickly. Thats y theres been no wars and the world is so peaceful.<br>  <br>  As the title suggest in the first book shes an uglie  in the secong shes a pretty and in the third shes a special which is like a bad pretty.<br>  <br>  Sorry i know this description is really bad sorry|`|AA12320240	the uglies series are a great read they are about a girl name tally and how she a her friends are like rebels in their towns and the thibng is that the poeple are into plastic sugery so much that when kids turn sixteen they are taken to the hosptial and get a tottaly new look then live in pretty town. Personally i highly recommen this book to anyone that like to read about weird anf fanastany worlds|`|a767b0c8663df6066e1e450f78440868aa	So when you turn 16 you get turned into a "pretty person" and the chemicals and stuff used to turn you "pretty" is really bad for you.<br>  And the main girl, i forget her name, has to find the hiding spot where the people who revolted to be turned "pretty" were hiding. so ya that's like a general highlight of it.|`|ee5LcXQraa	Ugh, really slow, and not worth it in the first one.<br>  Had to force myself to finish it, then had enough tolerance for the rest of the series.<br>  Ehh, not so great.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You don't need background knowledge.

iT9S20zvaa	The above answer is correct.  The author is Shannon Hale.<br>  <br>  She does have several other books, which are:<br>  The Goose Girl (Other than The Princess Academy, this is my second favorite book by Shannon Hale)<br>  Enna Burning<br>  River Secrets  (This and the two above are companion novels)<br>  Rapunzel's Revenge (Graphic novel)<br>  Book of a Thousand Days<br>  Austenland: a Novel<br>  The Actor and the Housewife (which is coming out this June)<br>  <br>  I thought The Princess Academy, though I am much too old for it, was a beautiful story.|`|440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	Shannon Hale<br>  And no, not to my knowledge.|`|zYbT5dqFaa	It was written by Shannon Hale, and I agree- I loved it too!<br>  There aren't any more in a series or anything, but she has written other books, such as:<br>  Repunzel's Revenge<br>  River Secrets<br>  Goose Girl<br>  Enna Burning<br>  Book of a Thousand Days<br>  Austenland<br>  <br>  Out of those I've only read Goose Girl and Book of a Thousand Days...

The action of love has no motive and every other action has.<br>  <br>  Thought is founded on memory, and love is not memory.<br>  <br>  Is there love when there is defence?  Defence is resistance which prevents understanding.<br>  <br>  Where there is love the problem is simple, where there is no love the problem becomes complex.<br>  <br>  Where there is a feeling of lonliness, love is not.<br>  <br>  If there was love in your heart, you wouldn’t be concerned with good and evil.|`|H6ixrUYLaa	I don't believe in "soul mates" because I think half of loving someone is your choice.  You can love more than one person, though not at the same time.  But after you get over another person, you should be able to love another in a matter of time.  <br>  So no, I don't believe in a "love of my life", but I do greatly believe in sharing your love.  If it lasts forever, it lasts.  If it doesn't, then you'll find another person.|`|19pBM4GSaa	this is one of those questions were the answer can only be opion an not fact, but from my personal experience i do think there is such thing, i at the moment belive i am with the love of my life, i cant see myself being with anyone else, still after 4 years he makes my heart race just by walking in the room, dont get me wrong you could ask me in a years time and my opinion could have drastically changed, people make you feel diffrent in many ways, its yourself that interpritates these feeling into what you belive they are. (if thats makes sense).  but yea i do belive there is xxxx|`|ehUrxExbaa	Yeah but there's probably quite a lot out there. It's too much of a coincidence to say that two people are 'meant' to find eachother and are soulmates. Probably more like a million potential soulmates in the world which gives you a decent chance of finding one. After all, why are we here in the first place, but then maybe we are all just lizards and don't know yet.|`|az2ZBy3iaa	You just feel this way due to recent emotional stimulation. Give it some time.

You will never find a piece that pleases everyone.  You and your friend will, simply, have to agree on a piece and do it.  Just remember, you can't automatically expect HER to change her mind.<br>  <br>  Here is what I read from your question:  <br>  <br>  You don't want to do her song choice.<br>  <br>  You don't want to do a song that people may criticise.<br>  <br>  You don't want people commenting on what you wear.<br>  <br>  You don't want to do a solo.<br>  <br>  What you want is YOUR WAY, no matter what anyone else wants.  Guess what, if you don't already know this.  You can't always get your way.  Do you think Brittany Spears would have started her singing career if she was worried about what the press and many people might think about her later behavior?  That's what being onstage is all about.  It's about letting oneself be vulnerable and being strong enough to take it because performing is THAT important.<br>  <br>  Get up there and do a number, or stay off of the stage.

You don't have to flex as hard as you can or anything. (I might be wrong about this, since I'm not in your classes or anything. But that's my guess. XD)<br>  <br>  It might not be a bad idea to practice releves with your toes a little up. Like if you do them at the bar or whatever, try lifting your toes with it so that you get used to how that feels. It's basically just trial and error, keep correcting things with your feet until you figure out how to get it right :)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|G2mJppm0aa	PRACTICE or tape your toes with athletic tape.

wGEYqauWaa	You need to understand that the price you pay for low action is buzzing when you strum or pick too hard.  There's really an optimum action that represents a compromise between low (ease of play) and high (lots of room for the strings to vibrate freely).  If you veer from that optimum too far in either direction you're going to pay a price.<br>  <br>  The first two responses were correct; this has nothing to do with cutaway versus non-cutaway.|`|W1h3w5gdaa	Yeah, I have to agree with TW. I've never heard of a cutaway feature impacting the action at all. On an acoustic guitar, the bridge saddle height and the truss rod position (both in combination with string gauge) will determine the action of the guitar.|`|rFmBtm3eaa	No, a guitar's action is determined by a multitude of things but nothing to do with whether or not it's body had a cut away. A cut away is cosmetic and functional as it does generally give you easier access to certain frets on the guitar neck

42Snaj8jaa	It starts with Raoul buying the monkey music box. Then the auctioneer starts talking about the "strange affair" of the phantom of the opera as it goes back to the past (past shown in color) Carlotta, the Prima Donna, leading lady for 5 seasons is rehearsing for the upcoming production of "Hannibal" when the manger comes in and announces that he is retiring due to his health and is going to Australia. He presents to them the two new owners of the "Opera Populaire". They ask Carlotta to sing a song called "Think of Me", but she refuses to sing after she starts because the phantom dropped a backdrop (ironic?) on top of her. Madame Giry then tells them that Christine Daae could sing it, but not after giving them a letter from the phantom requesting his salary of 20,000 francs (roughly 7,000 dollars) and that they continue to leave box 5 open for his use. Any way Christine sings and Raoul recognizes her as his "childhood sweetheart". After the performance, Raoul goes to her dressing room, they reminisce then he leaves. The phantom gets jealous and appears before her for the first time, for he had been giving her singing lessons from behind her mirror. He takes her to his house under the opera house. The next morning out of curiosity she rips off his mask to reveal his horribly, deformed face. He becomes mad and takes her back. Meanwhile the managers are recieving notes from the phantom detailing how "his" theater is to be run. They don't listen to his demands and he makes Carlotta croke like a frog and kills Joseph Buquet. Christine runs up on the roof with Raoul and they proclaim their love, they phantom overhears and becomes angry. He is not seen from for a while after that only to appear at the masquerade ball to make demands that they will perform the play he wrote "Don Juan Triumphent" with Christine as its star. You then find out that madame Giry saved the phantom as a child from a circus attraction. Christine later goes to the graveyard to mourn her dead father. The phantom follows and convinces her to come to him. Raoul shows up on a white horse (yuuk!) to save her. The phantom and Raoul get in to a sword fight and Christine stops Raoul from killing the phantom. Later his play is played as a trap set for the phantom, but the phantom is not in the audience he kills the leading man and takes his place and sings to Christine declaring his love. Christine rips his mask off along with a wig. He takes her back under to his house. Raoul comes to save her and the phantom threatened to kill him if she did not marry him, so she kisses him and agrees. He lets them go because Christine was the first person to show him kindness, for even his mother dispised him. He smashes the mirrors and leaves. The hunting party comes only to find that everyone is gone. Meg, Madame Giry's daughter finds his mask. (It returns to the present) Old Raoul goes to Christine's grave, puts the monkey on it and sees that the phantom had left a ring (that she gave him) and rose on her grave.|`|zkMuv2FKaa	Phantom gets owned. :'( It is very sad.

KGOVQIKAaa	I've actually been to Proscout. If you haven't already signed up and paid for it, please save your money.<br>  <br>  The initial interview for Proscout is free. They tell you what Proscout is and make you believe that a lot of people get discovered and get big contracts from attending the Proscout invitational. After they tell you about Proscout, they quickly meet all of the people who attended and decide whether or not to invite you to the big Proscout even (which costs $800 to attend - or maybe even more now.)<br>  <br>  I went to Proscout when I was younger. Definitely one of those mistakes I learned from. It was expensive to attend, and like all of the aspiring actors and models out there, I thought that if someone in the right place could just see me, my career would take off. It doesn't happen that way.<br>  <br>  It was huge and chaotic.You don't really get any personal critique or one on one time with anyone who can actually teach you something. There were some seminars, but nothing you couldn't find somewhere else for A LOT less money. The whole thing was actually rather long and boring. I found someone else there who was also more interested in acting than in modeling - and Proscout really didn't have much there for actors at all. So we both commiserated on that point. It was entirely worthless, actually, going there with an interest in acting.<br>  <br>  What happens is that you're given a number, which you wear on your clothes. You come with two pictures of yourself (or they will take them there for a price) and then you stand in line and eventually walk down the runway with everyone else while agents from various places watch and if they're interested in you they will write down your number. Later the various agencies will read a list of numbers they would like to see - and the people who are called go into this big room and stand in line to see someone behind the table from that agency. They had several schools attend, too - and so you get called and go in, only to find out that they want you to go attend their schools and take their classes (and pay their tuition).<br>  <br>  All of this, of course, is after a huge seminar where they brainwash you into thinking that tons of people have gotten huge contracts from being "discovered" at Proscout. Very few have in fact gotten any jobs in this way.<br>  <br>  I don't think anything really came of it for the people I met there who were aspiring models. It is such a long shot to even be noticed in such a massive cattle call. It's not worth the money at all - and you feel a bit duped at the end of it when you come away with nothing - not even a new piece of knowledge except not to waste your money on something like that again.<br>  <br>  So, I would strongly advise you to save your money and if you are seriously interested in acting and modeling, follow the advice of the people who know what they're talking about in this forum. Get into acting through classes and going to actual auditions - not falling for these over-blown cattle calls that make you pay money to attend.<br>  <br>  It should never cost anything to audition or be seen by a modeling agency.<br>  <br>  The agents who go to Proscout are paid to come - and they are not necessarily looking seriously for any new talent.<br>  <br>  Did you know, that you can submit yourself to all of the agencies that go to ProScout - and more - for the price of a stamp each? All of the big modeling agencies including Elite, Ford, Wilhelmina accept submissions from aspiring models. You don't even have to have professional pictures - you can just send them a good picture of yourself - a close up of your face and then a full body picture - along with your stats. That's it.<br>  <br>  For talent agents that represent actors, you can also submit yourself by sending your headshot and resume along with a cover letter.<br>  <br>  That might equal out to 90 cents per submission (assuming you're using a nice big envelope.) That's $2.70 (for 3 submissions) compared to $800 for Proscout (which doesn't actually necessarily have those three big modeling agencies attend.) Any real information on the modeling business you can find out on-line or from people in the know here at Yahoo!Answers.<br>  <br>  With the $797.30 you save from NOT attending Proscout, you could get Professional pictures taken. AND buy some outfits. AND probably have enough left over to actually take a trip to NYC to visit the agencies personally.<br>  <br>  It is up to you what you want to do with your money. But if you are serious about a career in acting or modeling, your $800 could be better spent for your career than going to Proscout which will do virtually nothing for your career - except perhaps make you a bit wiser about those over-promoted cattle calls where they make YOU pay to attend. It doesn't really make sense, does it, when you really sit down and think about it.<br>  <br>  If, however, you have already paid and you are definitely going, here are some things you should do to present yourself in a positive light...<br>  <br>  *Come with two really good photos of y|`|OHfZFR31aa	Just google them + scam and you'll see what comes up. There doesn't seem to be much positive news. And modeling competitions in general mainly attract scam agencies that will try to charge you more money for classes, photography and other typical scams. No matter what these type of competitions say, the major agencies DO NOT send scouts - they don't have to. They have thousands of people a month sending in pictures and coming to open calls so they don't need to go there to find new talent<br>  <br>  As the other poster says, don't waste your time and money with competitions. Send in your pictures directly to agencies, or spend that money on a trip to NY, LA or Miami and attend agency open calls directly. Here's a list of top agencies  <a href="http://models.com/agencies/top/" rel="nofollow">http://models.com/agencies/top/</a><br>  The individual websites all have information on how to be considered.<br>  <br>  Remember it should never cost you anything to get started in modeling.
AA12339318	It clearly stemmed from the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s and before.  For many, especially young blacks, whatever progress was being made was not fast enough.  For many, they could not understand why concepts of equality, fairness and tolerance could not be applied immediately.  If the law gave people certain rights, then one could just reach out and TAKE those rights due to them.<br>  <br>  Of course, some whites resisted those demands so, the concept of a united Black Power movement was invoked.  The range of strategies went from vocal demonstrations on up to extremely militant organization.  Interestingly, by the 70s, even some of the most militant groups, such as the Black Panthers, expanded their programs to incude schools for black children, food banks and other charitable activities, as well as political action and continued demonstrations against percieved injustices.<br>  <br>  The movement continues to this day in various forms and as a response to ongoing racial predjudice and such.

Put yourself in their shoes in the trenches - with mud up to your knees made from last night's rain and the blood of your fellow soldiers from this morning's battle.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	I think you have somewhat missed the point of that agreement.  In a sense, all of them are about seeking a kind of freedom and not about restraining yourself.  It is the freedom of focusing on the right goal and not being constantly distracted by a hundred other details.  It is simplicity and it is letting go.<br>  <br>  So the fact that you have thoughts and feelings that you WANT to express but aren't suggests that something is not working correctly here.  There is still a tension and not a relaxation.<br>  <br>  So think about being impeccable with your word in that context.  The focus is on brevity and on honesty.  Not on deception, not on censorship, not on presentation.  You say what you mean and you mean what you say.  And this only works if what you say reflects exactly what you think and what you feel.<br>  <br>  The reason why gossip is not appropriate in this mode is again because it is a distraction.  You can't really know what other people are thinking (don't make assumptions) and what other people are doing doesn't really have much to do with you anyway (don't take anything personally).  Instead, you are concentrating on doing the best you can do.  And that's how being impeccable plugs in very well - you will have done your best to explain yourself to others, and they won't have to second-guess you to cooperate if they wish to.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's most helpful to get in the right focus if you make a special effort to.  Instead of writing down all the bits about other people you might be inclined to, every day write down all the good things that you've done that you're happy about.

You see, thinking is out of our control.  That is why we need meditation and all this kind of things.  But word is an action.

So, it is not against the Four Agreements.  I love the book and I own it.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	I HATE the four agreements. It's a total denial of what we feel, when what we feel is constantly being discouraged already. Words aren't the basis of communication, setting is. When sticking to words' meanings you are ignoring the totality of the dialogue which includes a million different things. Paying attention to just one is meaningless in comparison.<br>  <br>  Always do your best: Intentions are impossible to predict, and can have the opposite effect. Best compared to what? The human potential hasn't been measured. Doing this constant comparing is nauseating and can have serious stress problems.<br>  <br>  Don't take anything personally: This is spirituality in a nutshell, and only serves the purpose of avoiding reality. If you are going to do anything at all about anything, it is automatically personal, and for a good reason. We don't get upset for no reason, that's absurd.<br>  <br>  Don't make assumptions: Everything we do is an assumption. We trust the sun will come up tomorrow, we trust we exist. There is nothing constructed in our reality that is truly "as it is", and instead is always measured in relationship to us. That's why reality is a hologram, it's projected in time and space to give location.

AH8gMq5Saa	As Rome grew into a city and began to become more powerful it came into contact with the Greeks, who had a complex Pantheon of their own.<br>  <br>  i.e.<br>  it showed cultural diffusion with other earlier civilizations<br>  they also had their own list of gods (even though they were just                      manipulated from the earlier greek gods)<br>  showed how they were polytheistic and that history (polytheistic history) was preserved in the Pantheon.  This is especially important, because later, they converted to Christianity and a lot of that history would have been lost without the pantheon<br>  <br>  It has this name, perhaps because it received among the images which decorated it the statues of many gods, including Mars and Venus; but my own opinion of the name is that, because of its vaulted roof, it resembles the heavens. (Cassius Dio History of Rome 53.27.2)<br>  <br>  i.e.<br>  it was believed to be a place where the people could be closer to the gods (esp. because this was a place of worship for ALL of the gods)<br>  <br>  he origins of the Roman pantheon began with the small farming community that made up the ancient village of Rome. The foundations of the mythology included nameless and faceless deities that lended support to the community while inhabiting all objects and living things. Numen, as the belief in a pantheistic inhabitation of all things is called, would later take root in more clearly defined system of gods, but early on this belief that everything was inhabited by numina was the prevalent system.<br>  Even though the early Romans were not very concerned with the distinct personalities of each god within their pantheon, there was a rigid clarification of what each particular deity was responsible for. All aspects of life within Rome were guided not only by the pantheon of familiar names we are accustomed to, but to the household cult of the Dii Familiaris as well. With this belief set, every family or household was believed to be assigned a guardian spirit known as the Lar Familiaris (Lars). All family functions included these spiritual guardians in some form or another. Among these spirits that played a role in the spiritual life of Romans were Genii for men and junii for women. Each of these individual deities stayed with a person for life and represented the creative force that determined gender and allowed individuals to grow, learn and behave morally within society. The Dii Familiaris were so ingrained within the household that several spirits were assigned to specific responsibilities within a home. Forculus protected the door, Limentinus the threshold, Cardea the hinges, and Vesta the hearth.<br>  <br>  Most of the Roman gods and goddesses were a blend of several religious influences. Many of these were introduced via the Greek colonies of southern Italy and others had their roots in the Etruscan or Latin tribes of the region. In some cases the Etruscan or Latin names survived throughout the cultural existence of Rome, but many were adopted so completely that they maintained their names from other cultures. In the east, the Greek names remained the choice of the people and the major gods of the system therefore, were known by both.<br>  <br>  The gods of the Roman pantheon began taking on the forms known today during the dynasty of the Etruscan kings in the 6th century BC. These gods, Jupiter (Zeus), Juno (Hera), and Minerva (Athena), were worshiped at the grand temple on the Capitoline Hill. As Rome's power grew and expanded throughout the known world, the Roman Empire came into contact with the cultures and religious beliefs of many cultures. The Romans, happy to absorb and assimilate any culture they encountered thereby reaping the benefits of both its wealth and religious influence, were a mosaic of belief systems. Foreign gods and customs not only played major roles but were also given temples and priesthoods within Rome itself. The goddess Cybele, a Phoenician god was adopted during the Second Punic War to counteract any benefit that Hannibal may have gained. Even after his defeat, Cybele remained an integral part of the Roman system. Another very popular foreign god was the Persian god Mithra. Overwhelmingly supported in the Legions, this deity offered eternal salvation for the immortal soul and its popularity helped pave the way for the later Christian cult whose similarities made its adoption less difficult.<br>  <br>  With the passing of the Roman Republic into that of an Imperial system, the nature of Roman religion expanded again to include the Emperors themselves. Julius Caesar, having claimed to be a direct descendent of Aeneas, the son of Venus, was among the first to deify himself in such a manner. At first, such a system of human divinity was largely rejected by the masses, but the popularity of Caesar helped pave the way for future leaders.<br>  <br>  As the Imperial system gained hold, it was common practice for the Emperors to accept divine honors before their deaths. These living gods, in some cases, required sacrificial rituals|`|1hvrQYWiaa	It was the basis of official Roman religious belief - Emperors would sacrifice to the gods,ordinary people would pray to them, the priests would interpret dreams and augurs (omens)<br>   Emperors would curry favour with the gods by making offerings or building huge statues to the various gods

Kd6XgBlcaa	Yes, if you want, you can go to BN.com and read a sample chapter on it. If it suits you read it. And if you are into the Historical Fiction, read The Pillars of the Earth. It is the greatest historical fiction book in the world. Oh, The Other Boleyn Girl does have a few sexual parts to it. Not to mention somethings relation to the homosexual. But it is a good book. Read it and the Pillars. You will not be disappointed.|`|SIFwDinAaa	i wouldnt, the movie is kinda grific and wasnt at all very good. it had no point of making the movie in the first place. but i love their dresses :)|`|A1PLJKhUaa	Absolutely, it's a great book. It does go into some detail, but you can always skim over those bits.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	I read it a month or so ago and I really liked it, even though it's not a genre I usually read. Much better than the movie, although I liked being able to envision the characters using the actors who played them, Portman especially.|`|hDs9Yr8vaa	yes!<br>  the book was amazing! <br>  and i love how it was a true story!<br>  well it was based on a true story.|`|sjkASt4Raa	i watchedthe movie it wasnt the koolest|`|avpv7u8saa	Yes! Its amazing just like the movie|`|aSxl6l0Gaa	Yes, indeedy. I actually HATED the movie, since it was a poor abbreviation to an otherwise great book. I don't like historical fiction at all, but Philippa Gregory is the reason why I converted to a lover of the genre.<br>  <br>  However, I wouldn't read this particular book first. I think you should start with The Virgin's Lover. It was the advice my friend gave me when I had asked her about Gregory and if I should read her books. The Virgin's Lover is excellent and isn't TOO heavily laden with the history.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't necessarily say the book is graphic, but this really depends on your definition of "graphic." There is some sexual content, if that's what you mean, and references to incest, but there aren't detailed accounts of said things.|`|VFyERjSSaa	YES!!  read it!!|`|X3FJZPjxaa	if you have time.|`|nDHyeDVoaa	Yes!

ufdFei1jaa	Practitioners of health care in the 19th Century focused on providing care that was generally based on a minimum of causative information.  Doctors in 1800 did not have X-rays to help them see inside the body.  X-Rays were not discovered until 1895 and the use of them in medicine developed almost immediately to provide one of the first true diagnostic tools.  19th Century health care had very few diagnostic tools.  Most 19th Century health care practices relied almost exclusively on the cataloguing of the symptoms and history of the outcome of similar ailments. 19th Century health care may have included doctors care, a visit to an apothecary or if you were very ill and in a hospital.  However, the prognosis of all three choices was not typically very good.

This relates to a prisoner,who would be engaged in an 8hour activity whereby he would have to turn a wheel 10000 times. This served no purpose other than to teach the prisoner that crime doesn't pay, there wasn't any outcome from turning the wheel, you were just turning it 8hours a day for no reason. If you were turning it to fast, and you were in danger of reaching 10000 revolutions before 8 hours then an officer would tighten the screw to slow you down, hence the term."Screw". The sad fact is this activity was much more favourable than starving to death on the street, and many well educated, all be it middle class, religious types realized that poverty breeds desperation and no amount of punishment can stop it, so the slow assent to the welfare state began.

The last one was unheard of, until the 19th century.<br>  <br>  The 19th century also started the move away from capital  punishment, and corporal punishment.  The last capital punishment in Britain was in the early 19th century, due to anger over a boy who was hung for stealing a loaf of bread.  Most nations in Europe abandoned corporal punishment by 1880, through a movement started in Italy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_reform" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_refo...</a>

AA11219693	I like the way you further qualify the question of life: why is there something at all why is there not just nothing? This is a state of wonder associated with the very fact of your being and the existence of things in life, and the answer to this is nothing but a perpetuation of the same state of wonder until the mind is distracted by something more realistic and immediate to your being than to the rest of your world.     I think in the end all that matters is what came closest to us in life. Our thoughts are always equidistant from all things in our life and ourselves; all our concerns, passion, admirations, faithful beliefs, hopes, intentions, expectations and outcomes of our deed are what we earn in life, but our love always remains closer to our being than we ever can be to ourselves. We all are a being of love. The further we move from our essence into the winder and wonderful world around farther away we fall from the true objective of our being. We might have seen atrocities being committed in the name of peace, slaughters being carried out in the name of religion and humanity, and corruptive deeds being perpetuated in the name of freedom of action and ambition. A state of wonder in relation to all this is quite innocuous nature however it could take us far from the essence of our being into an unknown world around somewhere.    The simplest answer to your question therefore is: there is something, and everything, and not just nothing, because you are something yourself, and not just about anything, everything, or nothing. This is important to consider that you are something first, as someone then everything is what it is. The question therefore is, why are you? This question can be asked by anything or everything the existence of which you have objectively yourself in your question.    May God be merciful!|`|j1FCM0pqaa	just live it n be happy and dont ask stupid questions like this  :P|`|n3Rx3PYyaa	.

In regards to the "something" and "nothing" part of your question... "Things" and time is a human concept.  All "things" are simply formed matter viewed by human eyes.  Time does not really exist.    All simply 'Is'.  To simply 'Be'.  All are and is unity of energy, of Light.  We are souls having a human experience.  Evolve this human experience to Truth of Love.    The One Light (God) is Love.  We are not THE One Light (God), yet we are OF the One Light (God).    Humans are energy, matter.  As humans we play, create express . . .evolve.  We are unity of oneness.  We are Love.  Full human awareness of that is the evolvment.  . . .Purpose / meaning of life is energy and matter evolving.  .|`|3uGcqN2Eaa	I ask myself this all the time.

God mad the earth and everything on it except people then mad people in the haven they were, then came down to the earth.   so the life is with or without us.|`|N9CtBJnnaa	in my opinion, the sole purpose of our existence is to procreate, in order to continue the human race|`|OUbNSXjJaa	We, as individuals, have to give a proper meaning to life. For each individual, therefore, the meaning of life is different. If one knows how to add values day by day, he can easily give a proper meaning to life. This requires discipline and mental control or training.    If there is something, it is sufficient. A small fire can only become a big fire. If nothing (no spark of fire like spiritual energy) is there, then it will not grow and develop. We should know how to grow in positive direction.|`|Bl9u2e73aa	hmm. i always thought that life was just a big story that someone read.  i know i know kind of weird.    but i also thought that we were put here to accomplish something. and if you fail to do so. you're taken away        OR it's a privilage. and you're put here to gain self defence//confidence.etc. and then you relive life over and over and over. but you don't remember your past lifes.|`|BPoZPvGoaa	many people including myself have asked that question in one form or another.    I think it is different from people to people.  a rich guy would say they can buy other rich guy out, a king will say which country should I invade next? to a poor guy. if only I have enough to eat today.    it is much easier for someone to talk about something rather than nothing.

Its about fulfilling your own potential and being unique. The meaning of life to me is not related to the big "god" question. There is not agreed reply to what life means, its different for each and every individual. I think people need to come to their own conclusions. I don't think life can be fulfilling or rewarding if you don't have any meaning to your own existence. It doesn't have to be "finding" religion or god, but something that feels important and matters to you.|`|sWLRSa6Caa	Life is an opportunity to "realize" our connection to all that is in the All That Is...that we are not separated, individually functioning beings, but that we are intricately woven into the web of consciousness out of which everything finds and shares eternal sustenance.      The worldly norm is that we experience ourselves and "others" whom we see as  distinctly apart from ourselves...but this is the very illusion that dreams and perpetuates itself...the split ego mind painting fanciful tableaus of "you and me," "us and them," etc.      The Reality is that we are one thing, given life and sustained by The One/Source/God/All That Is.  Each "one" is dependent upon and affected by every "other one" within the Whole.  All comes from Source in constant, uninterrupted flow...some would say "Beingness."  This is the Reality beyond the dream that we dream of independence and sovereignty...imagined queens and kings, each envisioning unreal domains and realms over which we appear to rule.     But this dream "kingdom" we seem to perceive is external/without, and of our own making...while the True Kingdom is internal/within, the place we have never left.  It is our ultimate purpose to leave the fantasy of separation from Creator and our co-beings and to merge back into realization of our true essence as one within The One.    i am Sirius|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Life is how the universe appreciates the beauty and the horror of itself.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Life is what you make it.

God is not an object out side us. In fact we all, in fact the entire creation animate and inanimate is a part of God. Really speaking the entire space from hear to the farthest imaginable star is GOD.    Therefore to say that we are created in image of GOD; is yes and no. Exactly the way your hand or foot is made in your way.     To say all these things is very easy.

It does not mean we are perfect it just means we have the same number of toes, fingers, mouth, eyes and ears.|`|wZH6PBIGaa	Well as a christian, I'd answer like this:  The Bible says we're made in God's image - and we are. Like God, we have spirit, free will to choose. The Bible also says that in the beginning things were perfect. But God gave us the same choice he had himself - we could choose to disobey him, and do wrong, indulge in sin, or we could choose to live with him in the perfect world he'd made for us. Unfortunately Adam and Eve listened to the devil's temptations and took the fruit, disobeying God and so beginning the downward spiral that the Bible calls 'sin'. 'Sin' is 'sin' for a reason. Sin hurts and damages things. Think of murder; of all the ways that hurts people, it causes death.  So back to your question: Why aren't we perfect if we're made in the image of God? Well, at first, humanity was. We aren't perfect, because unlike God, who hates 'sin' and is perfect, never doing anything wrong, we chose 'sin'. So whilst we retain the 'image of God', we've spoiled it. It's like copying a beautiful painting and smearing black grease all over it. There's still good in there, it's just marred and spoiled.  Hope that helps clear things up for you a little.  =)|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...not having expectations...     ...accepting and knowing myself...  ...being confident and responsible for all my choices and actions in my life...    ...after all god is a belief and a creation of man, knowing this...    ...making the best of my world one day at a time...  ...good luck...|`|0bc986861c0e5afae15d606bc6b9fbc4aa	The first man Adam and eve where created in the image of God.

It breaks both men and their pain is intense.|`|QNZg0MCdaa	he is old and he has grown up on the ranch, he has seen many people start working and leave, and his dog had to be killed beacuse he was no good any more, and the dog was candys life, he knows the history of the ranch .

Maybe gods good is not "your" good and your evil is not "gods" evil.|`|i6d582PFaa	From God's perspective there is no evil  from human perspective there is the evil of separateness, being apart from the Truth.     The universe is One, so think how lonely it is to be a separate entity.|`|AA11503678	"The acquisition of evil, that is, the desire for evil, is evil, but the creation of evil is not evil." (1)    A lazy man who receives damage from rain, which comprises many instances of good, may not say that the rain is not mercy.    That is to say : "If there were no knife, that man wouldn't have been stabbed to dead, so knife is evil, also the one who made the knife is evil"|`|m9KRdETTaa	As to your question God did not create evil, evil in itself is a choice that people have. In other words people have the ability to choose to do God's will or evil ways.|`|8BG2tqTGaa	he didn't, satan was origionally one of God's angels.|`|J9AvKefwaa	Where is the evidence for any of this? Who says God exists at all? Who says even if "he" does that "he" is "good"? And who says "he" creates things good or bad? And who says evil is a creation? There is no evidence that god exists or created. IF... god exists why blame "him" for evil? Every individual should take responsibility for their own thoughts, actions and behaviours. What you do is up to you and I don't "buy" this blame god excuse.|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	By creating good the opposite must come into being, at least as a potentiality. God created a world where we have free choice, where good things can happen, but good things are only known as such by the possibility of bad things happening.  The idea that God did not create everything is to have a very limited, if not primitive, idea of God.   Evil is only seen as true evil from the human point of view, God can see the greater purpose, if we could see the greater purpose it would no longer serve its function as evil. We can at least understand we do not understand.|`|iuwLHT2Taa	It's just a part of god's plan just live with it|`|4Td1aRWSaa	Maybe God isn't good, then. Or how about, your particular idea of God is just a fairy tale, just like all those other gods which you don't believe in, and trying to figure out how God can be both good and allow evil to exist is a waste of time and a fruitless mental exercise.|`|y4xqFCnDaa	yeah, god didn't create evil. evil and good always existed, and god is sort of the champion of good causes. it is we who choose whether to follow a good or evil path, whereas god reminds us and helps us to achieve the good way.|`|Ci5QDEW5aa	Evil does not exist. Only the actions of man. Ask yourself why do you think evil exists as an entity. I bet the answer is that you were told this as a child. If that is the case then you were programmed to think that way.|`|suKoM2owaa	maybe god is dead, or he's a Palestinian. did you ever think of that?|`|eC2sLc3iaa	Evil is lack of God, a choice made by the human being to ignore His presence. He therefore doesn't create it, it is there by itself as a result of human ignorance.   Knowledge of God makes eventually everything good even that which is generally refered to as evil.

Just like the rest of them. So while we can all go on rattling of our differences, the list of similarities is much, much longer.    "Animals are a major group of multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia or Metazoa. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on in their life. Most animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently. Animals are also heterotrophs, meaning they must ingest other organisms for sustenance."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal    Such a basic paragraph, a couple of sentences, about four facts; yet this sums up all animals. The seemingly endless diversity is really an elaboration on a basic form and function, spear-headed by the homo sapien.    What distinguishes humans from other animals? The same as what distinguishes a Mercedes Benz from a Toyota: one is just a fancy version of the other: a slightly more advanced variation of the same thing.|`|m9KRdETTaa	We can talk.|`|UY2MJtfGaa	Brain, philosophy, mathematics, science|`|zqOelChsaa	The tail (or lack thereof in the humans case). Especially in males--that's the only difference I can see.|`|64d77l4qaa	The ability to express our thoughts beyond "I'm hungry".  We have a rich imagination that allows us to bring others into our thoughts. We can solve problems by sharing our thoughts and bouncing ideas off one another. This has created sciences, literature, artwork, music. We define and approach life differently.    Animals can discover or "invent", like dolphins using a sponge on it's nose while foraging, and some animals can even teach other animals how to do what they've discovered.    But you don't see monkeys sitting around inventing stories to entertain or teach eachother with.    I don't think it's simply that we have a more complex language. It's that we're driven by more than just the desire to eat, sleep, and reproduce. We set life goals for ourselves. As far as we can tell, animals don't do that.|`|Ci5QDEW5aa	People have the ability to understand the concept of right and wrong. People have a conscious mind that can make decisions beyond basic survivak needs, eg fashions.|`|suKoM2owaa	we do senseless things like play golf and that stuff you americans call football...and we are aware that we are...|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	Humans have eaten from the the tree of good and evil, or more accurately translated from the Hebrew; the knowledge of that which is advantageous and disadvantageous.  In other words we think about, food, sex, and shelter, to the point of freaking out if it's not there, or worrying about losing it if it is. Animals just deal with it.  Animals play, where did that one come from?|`|TOTt5Ygjaa	Our intelligence.

According to Hindu philosophy there is a word "PURUSHARTH" which means the man stives for. There 4 things that man works for or stives for because man feels that he is not complete. To make himself complete the nam works or puts in PUSHARTH.    There are 4 things for which man works.   1. Kama (Pleasure)  2. Arth (Security)  3. Dharma (Righteousness)  4. Moksha (State where there are no desires)  1..Kama is pleasure. This inclusedall pleasure giving things like food, sex, etc.  2.. Arth is security. Security may be in form of money, bank balance, house, clothes according to weather, etc.   It can be seen that these two things, KAMA and ARTH are common to all the living beings. Even an animal needs a shelter for security. An animal also enjoys food and sex.     Here the similarity between animals and human beings end.    Human being needs a life of RIGHTEOUSNESS. A human being want to be fair to every one and expects every one to be fair to him. This is not applicable to animals.    The ultimate goal as Hindu philosophy is to attain Moksha; the state where one does not desire anything. This is satate which is completely ego-less. In this state one becomes one with GOD. Even the desire of being desireless is not there. This state can only be imagined.    Therefore in Hindu philosphy it is very clear that all living beings need Kama and Arth; while human beings need Kama, Arth, Dharma and Moksha.|`|ead05986610bd3aee9f8b22328f904ddaa	Multiplied capabilities

Psalmulus Grey, an emotionally scarred, fifteen-year-old participant of this world order, lives within its guidelines until one night when an angel of God appears before him and makes it clear that he is one of the Father’s chosen. Meanwhile a much more sinister plan is unfolding within the city of Neo Creek between Maxwell Steeleworthy, a wealthy capitalist, and Zegudalia, a demonic being from the Abyss. In an epic battle of divined proportions, Psalmulus manifests vast supernatural abilities as he struggles with the decision to fulfill God’s will for his life and become a Guardian of Light or succumb to his own vengeful desires. Many forces from the side of light as well as darkness rise to the occasion to see their goals met as Psalmulus is forced to do battle with humans and demons alike, but most of all--himself.<br>  <br>  Book Trailer Here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnMR6l5oKfA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnMR6l5oK...</a>|`|XjYy1k5Xaa	THE WINNER STANDS ALONE (2008)<br>  THE MAGICIAN, FERNANDO MORAIS (2008)<br>  THE WITCH OF PORTOBELLO (2006)<br>  LIKE THE FLOWING RIVER (2006)<br>  THE ZAHIR (2005)<br>  ELEVEN MINUTES (2003)<br>  THE DEVIL AND MISS PRYM (2000)<br>  VERONIKA DECIDES TO DIE (1998)<br>  THE MANUAL OF THE WARRIOR OF LIGHT (1997)<br>  LOVE LETTERS FROM A PROPHET (1997)<br>  THE FIFTH MOUNTAIN (1996)<br>  BY THE RIVER PIEDRA I SAT DOWN AND WEPT (1994) - my favorite. i cried when i read this book. <br>  MAKTUB (1994)<br>  THE VALKYRIES (1992)<br>  O DOM SUPREMO: THE GREATEST GIFT (1991)<br>  BRIDA (1990)<br>  THE ALCHEMIST (1988)<br>  THE PILGRIMAGE (1987)|`|p5cYEPASaa	I dunno.

To Zoey, being marked is truly a blessing, though she's scared at first. She has never fit into the human world and has always felt she is destined for something else. Her grandmother, a descendant of the Cherokee, has always supported her emotionally, and it is she who takes the girl to her new school. But even there the teen stands apart from the others. Her mark from the Goddess Nyx is a special one, showing that her powers are very strong for one so young. At the House of Night, Zoey finds true friendship, loyalty, and romance as well as mistrust and deception.<br>  <br>   Blue Bloods Series by Melissa De La Cruz- The Blue Blood Series by Melissa De La Cruz- About a group of Vampires called Blue Bloods who try to do good in the world, only to realize that one of their own has turned from them.<br>  <br>  Daughters of the Moon Series by Lynn Ewing******<br>  Five regular girls from down town Las Vegas are not as normal as they seem.

cgz85foTaa	She really always knew.<br>  <br>  However, the reader might be confused because when Salamanca says that her mother was "resting peacefully", the phrase has two meanings.  One meaning is that people say the phrase "resting peacefully" to describe some one who is dead.  Another meaning could simply be that her mother lives somewhere else and is having a good time there.  Salamanca knew that her mom was dead, she just didn't really want to admit it to herself.  Her mom died when she was away, so she doesn't really and truly believe it.  Salamanca needs to see for herself and to be able to finally say good-bye to her mom.  That is the whole point of going on the car trip.|`|iT9S20zvaa	I have always thought that the memory of her mother's death was too painful for Sal to deal with, and she allowed herself to believe otherwise.  <br>  My opinion, though it has been many years since reading Walk Two Moons, is that she knew all along; it just took her awhile to really come to terms with things and admit that her mother was never coming back.|`|na2axA4taa	ill google it then get back to you in a min as i want to give you the best answer i can<br>  hope my answer helped and have a nice day x

2TLXfQKDaa	Just like writing a paper you need a good flow of information.  Your topic sentence and opening description of services alone will turn people away or keep them reading.  A picture is worth a thousand words and often is why they're incorporated into brochures.  A problem with this, many people get caught up in the clipart and get excited about showing a lot of pictures.  Simple works best, don't clutter.  Unlike a written document you don't necessarily need a summation type closing, but something to really pull the customer in your direction is always helpful.  Testimonials and or contact information is usually found at this point.<br>  <br>  Think of a brochure as a 3 columned written synopsis.  You want it informative yet brief, clear and concise.  Hope this helps.  <br>  <br>  To get an idea, check out some digital brochures on the web.<br>  <br>  <br>  One last tip.  Get creative with it, and when you think it's about finished, sit down and really analyze the aesthetics of your work.  If it's not visually appealing many people often will pass your brochure up for another.

I read once that well-balanced names should consist of parts of varied syllables.  For example, people with lengthy last names, theoretically, should select first and middle names for their offspring with fewer syllables, and vice versa.  For Liv, you might use a name such Alexandria or Miranda.  Don't choose Victoria or Veronica -- names beginning with V as then it becomes difficult verbally to separate the two names.  You don't say what her surname is to be or whether Liv is to be a fictional character; if so, you might give her a two-syllable last name (not Tyler!).  I hope that the foregoing will be helpful!|`|O2ddslf2aa	You must take into consideration that Liv is an abbreviated version of Olivia (hopefully, or I'll sound like a complete idiot!) <br>  I think you need to choose for yourself. I assume you are writing a novel, short story or some other form of writing? Good! From experience I know that it's better to name your characters yourself. Just now you don't need to worry about your characters' middle names, instead concentrate on the characters themselves. Thus you should get to know them better, characters don't even need names, one only has to read du Maurier's Rebecca to realise that. (Great book by the way, have you read it?) Get to know your character, develop her and understand her. Later, she will tell you her middle name. No need to worry about that now. <br>  Hope I helped<br>  ~Kirstenn(:|`|AGuKRhfXaa	Liv Marie<br>  Liv Paige<br>  Liv Adelyn<br>  Liv Kelly<br>  Liv Allison<br>  Liv Rae<br>  Liv Jade<br>  Liv Riley<br>  Liv Elaine<br>  <br>  <br>  that's all i can think of! hope I helped.|`|5UKw5D33aa	Liv Anne, Liv Elise

2TLXfQKDaa	Any program with layers can accomplish this pretty well. This is the simplest way to do what you're asking...<br>  <br>  Find all your pictures on the web or whatever.  Use a program like Gimp.org (<-- free program downloadable).  Create a new document which is the same resolution (pixel size) as your desktop. 1600x1040 or whatever you use.  Copy and past the pictures into the new document and situation them as you please.  Save as jpg, gif or bmp and you're done.
lqD3rVfDaa	You should read books about writing by writers to see how long they work and how they break up their day.  No one answer works for everyone.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of down time and diversion time in an 8-hour work day.  Concentrated writing is very tiring.  The first Thomas Wolfe said he could only write abut five hard hours a day and he was exhausted.  Jack London said he wrote as long as it took to get one thousand good words down on the page and then stopped for the day.<br>  <br>  Every writer has to find his/her own work habit.|`|IvF3rdwnaa	I agree and disagree with this. I would say for the most part you are right, but there are definately times when no writing occurs really . . . well at least productive writing because you get somewhat stuck or caught up with something in regards to where the character(s) should go next. In THESE cases, while no productive writing is going on, I'd say instead of walking away still plug away at it on the mental end of it working relentlessly to remedy whatever the issue may be. That way instead of just putting it on the back burner, walking away, and doing something else; you could still utilize the time by finding a solution quicker than normal, putting your writing back on track A LOT sooner.  This would definately utilize the 8 hours and may even cut it down a lot if you can work all the kinks out as well as potential ones.  ^_^|`|AnSFRCnraa	It might get boring,but it kind of depends, if its really something your passionate about and you really are enjoying the way your story is going...then it shouldn't get boring that fast.And your kind of your own boss so you could have longer than normal breaks and a lunch break,but you don't exactly have to treat it like a 9 to 5 job.But that's just my opinion.Just write when you feel like it,and when the story comes to you.|`|9jCGK0g1aa	Yes, I certainly agree. It depends on what kind of story you're writing also... but writing 8 hours straight.. that's just crazy!! maybe if you write like for 2 hours a day i think you would be able to come out with a good book to read in a month. Trust me.|`|bUeMqGgMaa	I can't blieve u asked that q! You should work however long you need to and want to! My tip is to not make yourself write, but to let the ideas come to you. I have found that the writing is better this way!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You've missed something here. Most authors don't earn enough from their writing to do it full time (the average author in the UK earns just 1/4 of the national average wage from their writing, not enough to live on). They have a job as well. They don't have 8 hours a day available to write.|`|zUFdTyqZaa	But it's not like you can force an author to write something (good).<br>  It comes when it comes; it takes me like a week to write a good few pages.|`|440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	I think authors write when they feel like it. If you're taking about someone like a novelist, then they write at home whenever they feel the creative juices flowing. Writing isn't as structured as other jobs where you have to go to an office and be there for 8 hours. With writing, you have deadlines but it's not like you have to write a certain amount every single day.<br>  That's for someone who writes at home but if you were to write for a magazine, like my aunt does, you sometimes do have to go to the office and sit and write for a certain amount of time. But with my aunt, who writes for an alumni magazine, she goes into work every weekend and writes while doing other things as well.<br>  <br>  Also, as another person pointed out, few authors just write for their living. For most, they don't make nearly enough money in order to make a living. Writers tend to have other jobs as well, which cuts into their writing time.|`|AA12129792	Check out the book On Writing by Stephen King.  In it he gives tips to aspiring writers including when, where and how long to write along with other details on everything from dialogue to editing.<br>  <br>  In this book I think he says he does about 4 hours uninterrupted writing a day except Christmas and Thanksgiving.|`|4FqP313qaa	well, if you're really into a story, than its not boring..but you really don't have to consider being an author a full-time occupation. it just messes up your inspiration when you feel like you have to write for a certain time of day, with certain scheduled breaks, and certain days off. then its no better then an office job.|`|f2e71f6Gaa	it kinda varies depending on how into the writing you get some days you could be on a roll and not want to stop writing and other days you can take it a little bit slower. its really a job where you can control the hours you work. thats what i think anyway.

snrdDbLAaa	It is probable that I do not follow all of the masonic iconography (`Shining Delta's eye'), but this appears to be a direct and rhetorically simple poem.  The octave is all in the vocative case; the sestet is an invocation, the couplet of which provides the obvious eschatological conclusion.  Unlike Donne or Shakespeare, your sonnets do not use extended metaphor as a form of argumentation, but as ornament; in this sense your writing is more akin to Keats, Wordsworth, or the Victorians.  <br>  <br>  `Seed' (l. 11), punning on grain and pearls, draws the mind to the suffering of the Son; this is the sole reference to the parable to which the title alludes.  Yet, the poem is more personal than this, much as the original parable was (which Father Al charmingly renders above).  In a similar vein (hah!) we have wine and blood (ll. 4 and 9) and the charming (were it not for `depart') life in the agricultural cycle.  I personally enjoyed line 2, though it does not make a perfect counterpoint to line 10; the Delta of line 3, the downcast of line 5, the briefly extended water imagery of ll. 8-9 (which surprisingly skips the miracle of Cana), and the silk of the couplet all seem disconnected from one another.  Except for line 2, these do not add up to a coherent picture of the speaker's faith, so that, `by your grace' in the end seems almost superfluous, even repeating a word and the notino of softness from l. 6, since it is unclear how the speaker thinks he has offended, as would be so terribly manifest in Donne.<br>  <br>  I am tickled to see a Eugene Onegin sonnet, but the form does not quite add or detract from the meaning of the poem.  I think I recall seeing at least one other Onegin sonnet of your composition, in which these worked in more obvious concord.<br>  <br>  Please do not think I do not find this a `good' sonnet; your technical skills in modulating sound are not always as varied as our better poets, but are certainly always as pure.  What often seems to interest me is how you structure discourse and carry an argument forward, so I find myself commenting on this, and forgive me, if it is perhaps excessive.  In this case, dissonances, such as where the rich man does buy the pearl in the original story, draw me to to question the precision of the poem's intent.|`|srNBx7sLaa	Three words will suffice...very, very nice.

Tolkien's son), Warren "Warnie" Lewis (C. S. Lewis's elder brother), Roger Lancelyn Green, Adam Fox, Hugo Dyson, R. A. "Humphrey" Havard, J. A. W. Bennett, Lord David Cecil, and Nevill Coghill. Other less frequent attenders at their meetings included Percy Bates, Charles Leslie Wrenn, Colin Hardie, James Dundas-Grant, Jon Fromke, John Wain, R. B. McCallum, Gervase Mathew, and C. E. Stevens.

fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	Quite a few- and most of the nastiest ones.<br>  <br>  There is Joseph Stalin- the US supported him in his fight against Adolf Hitler. Stalin got almost 1/3 of his tanks from the US and Britain- some soviet armoured divisions were fitted exclusively with US gear! From uniforms through rifles and with tanks. BTW-90% of "russian" WW2 trucks were made in the US and shipped there. After WW2- even during the so-called "cold war" the US supported the soviets by selling them food at knock down prices. Imagine- feeding an enemy.<br>  <br>  Then there is Mao tse Tung. A really mean guy with a body count of around 70 milion. The US supplied him with guns during WW2 and later allowed him to get into power by boycotting the Nationalist Chinese government. Nixon "warmed up relations" with them- in the middle of fighting a war in Vietnam where the enemies of US were supplied by CHina. Clinton sold them missle technology. Then of course there is the recent boom of US investments in China- whose system has not changed since Mao and is as bloody as ever.<br>  <br>  Lots of more dictators- though all are nitwits when compared to the two above. Just about the only dictator the US has not supported (yet) is Fidel Castro in Cuba.

It's not all opinion when it comes to a guitar, but it is more than most people give it credit for. People become fans of a particular brand, even a model, and assume that everyone else in the world should feel the same way.<br>  <br>  The fact is, there are a lot of crappy guitars out there. It's the number one selling musical instrument in North America, and outnumbers the next 5 or 6 top selling instruments combined in terms of revenue and units sold. This means everyone's gonna have an opinion. And you know what opinions are like...<br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to define a price range (which you have) and then go to a guitar store. Play with guitars in your price range. If you think you're not very good and are embarrassed playing in public, get over it. Play to your little heart's content, fall in love with a guitar and take it home. You will never be happier than if you follow that method. <br>  <br>  And, unless it's the only guitar store in town, don't settle. If you don't fall in love with it, don't buy it. Try a different store, and keep playing them until you do. Trust me on this one.

After the Second World War the UK had to borrow heavily from the USA. The Suez Crisis (1956) destroyed any pretentions that the UK was a major power.<br>  <br>  It was a long process as the UK over-extended in the nineteenth century and reverted back to it's correct world-power position by the 1950s based on economic productivity, population and resources.    <br>  <br>  All Empires follow a similar course.|`|RLQPWkXCaa	They had the will -- look at the British involvement in Malaysia -- but they simply didn't have the money.

I imagine that Britain needed to withdraw a bit to focus on rebuilding its own country with the few resources left.|`|AA12145054	A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (following the 1707 Act of Union, Britain) the dominant colonial power in North America and India. However, the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after a war of independence was a blow to Britain, depriving it of its most populous colonies. Despite this setback, British attention soon turned towards Africa, Asia and Oceania.<br>  The growth of Germany and the United States eroded Britain's economic lead by the end of the 19th century. Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War, for which Britain leaned heavily upon its Empire. The conflict placed enormous financial strain on Britain, and although the Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after the war, it was no longer a peerless industrial or military power. Despite emerging victorious, the Second World War saw Britain's colonies in South-East Asia occupied by Japan, which damaged British prestige and accelerated the decline of the Empire. Within two years of the end of the war, Britain granted independence to its most populous and valuable colony, India.|`|fKpBXXJbaa	The "Jewel in the Crown" was India, much of the rest of the Empire was acquired in order to safeguard shipping routes to India, while it had been policy since the 1860s for the white colonies - the Canadian provinces, Australian states, New Zealand, South African provinces, Newfoundland etc to be self-governing and eventually independent. <br>  <br>  Newfoundland was a bit of an oddity, since it was the first English colony, established about 1500, became an independent Dominion early in the 20th century, then suffered badly in the Depression in the early 1930s and reverted to being a colony, before it eventually voted to join Canada in 1949.<br>  <br>  From the 1930s onward it was clear that India would eventually become independent (India Act 1935), the 2nd World War delayed things in some ways, but once India and Pakistan became independent in 1947, the reason for keeping much of the Empire disappeared, and the African colonies started becoming independent starting with Ghana in 1957. It didn't help that WW2 virtually bankrupted Britain, and most of the Empire didn't earn money anyway. The earlier answer that WW2 rationing continued in Britain until the 1970s is utter crap, by the way - rationing was ended in 1953.|`|sRKO8s6jaa	The British Empire went bankrupt after World War 2.

dXW9cPWMaa	This is something I had a big problem with my freshman and sophomore year in my lit classes. As a junior, I somehow have no problem now, but maybe it's because I have the confidence of being an upperclassman.<br>  <br>  That aside, there are a few things I wish I would have known that I use now to say things in class.<br>  <br>  When I read, I always try to write down three or four things I found interesting, so if I get called on, I can always say something I liked. Then I try to pick out a few things that are important in terms of maybe race, religion/spirituality, important themes during the time - that kind of thing. As bad as this may be, sometimes if I'm not sure of what to do I'll get on Wiki for some guidance - I don't ever use this by itself, but it's often a good jumping-off point for ideas.<br>  <br>  One thing one of my teachers always told me was to always come with at least one thing to say, no matter how "good" I think it is. It doesn't matter if you feel like you're inferior to the people in your class or if you think you're the smartest person in the room. If you have something to say, people will respect that. Regardless of what you might think, everyone is a little intimidated by speaking in class.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I sympathize. :)|`|d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	I suggest you read the assignment and then a thoroughly as you can write down a question for yourself of the reading.  Then when you get to the point in class for participation be the first to ask your question.  Be the one who kicks off the conversation, play devils advocate and cop to it.<br>       If the subject is let's say Christian Wars.  Ask if that isn't an oxymoron.  How is it so easy for men to base the taking of life that their creator has made and take it away in the name of that higher being?<br>     ---  Granted that is a question but it shows you understand the topic even if not clearly.  It also opens the floor for explanation.  You can later come back to the question and say, 'How can men fighting in such wars Justify the act of sacrificing life whether theirs or others when commanding an army for the sake of Christianity?'  And if you can show at this point a biblical reference to war or use a quote from an author or even a general.  At this point use references from current events as well referring to Kamikaze pilots from WWI or Al Queda bombers or even Roman mythology where Valhalla (a type of heaven for warriors killed on the battlefield) awaits the 'righteous soldier'.  <br>  <br>  ---  Understand asking an informed question is definately a good thing.  If you start off early then your ignorance is okay because it hasn't yet been delved into and it will cause for others to jump to find the answer for you.  If something is unclear keep to the words you've read, repeat them in your own fashion and ask.  It will get you that participation mark.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	you just need to know enough information about the topic to fill in the gaps and relate it to the conversation. that's the key to participate w.o sounding retarded.

I think about it all the time, but the unknown is unknown for a reason. If someone told me about the future I wouldn't have any mystery to uncover anymore and I'd feel like I was just waiting for death. I wouldn't be surprised by the bad things, but I wouldn't be surprised by the good either, and I don't think that would be a life at all.
U3brmiC1aa	just main colours like yellow red blue and white and ocre. but don't use black because it make your Colour dark  and not shiny.
wYF6U6qlaa	In my opinion, leave it out for now.   Many of the best writers purposefully leave room for projection because the Reader feels closer to something he has had a hand in creating. <br>  <br>  Beginning writers (not sure if that's you or not) often get really caught up in what their characters look like, and feel that they must dump that information in right away.  Sometimes it's better not to, because it leaves the Reader the freedom to make the character their own.  For example, if you describe your handsome Romeo as blonde-haired and blue-eyed, you're automatically making the story less accessible for those who prefer dark-haired gentlemen.  How many times have you ever seen a movie based on a book you loved, and said to yourself, "That's not how I imagined it at all!" <br>  <br>  In my opinion, unless it's relevant to the plot (for example, Katarina has a scar across her cheek because she was kicked by a donkey during her childhood years on the bleak Russian potato farm) or is very important to defining the character ("O'Malley hated his red hair, his ruddy cheeks - when he saw himself in the mirror, he imagined himself lurching, drunken - a reflection of his father) just don't stress it. <br>  <br>  But otherwise, you don't have to say much.  It's a book, not a movie, so you have the advantage of defining by what they do and how they think and what they say.  If you don't have much of an image in your mind of what your character looks like (and you don't seem to) don't try to make one up just because you think you must.  It will make the character seem ever more fabricated, to you and the reader both.   As your story progresses you'll probably begin to naturally build your character anyway, and drop the reader hints without even realizing it :)|`|Lj3LyPUUaa	Dark brown hair, Black clothes always, Blue/Green eyes, sharp facial features, sort of buff, but not too much.<br>  <br>  Just a guess.|`|AGuKRhfXaa	well if the story takes place in italy, i would make him have some features that are italian.. for example:  olive skin and dark brown hair.  brown eyes too.<br>  <br>  i'd give him long hair and a beard.  <br>  <br>  it's all up to you!
bUeMqGgMaa	Great I loved it. The only thing I would suggest is this: When Sparrow meets Will she instantly warms up to him, even though they have not seen each other for years. If you meant it to be this way, the details and dialogue iimmediatly show that there is going to be a love connection between the two. Is there? You want the reader to be suprised! Another thing, when she scares the soldiers away add more description of what happened. I was kinda confused. You showed such great details in the parts that didn't matter, but yet when it got to the part that really let the story free, you lacked description.<br>  Hope I helped.:-)<br>  Love,<br>  sweetgrl|`|47vcHR2daa	i love it let me know when you write more its about time someone wrote a good book like that or at least the first chapter|`|r1lGbEKqaa	Pretty good, I don't think you need much change.

God is seriously up there, and has planned out everything for you, so that yes everything happens for a reason. I set my tone according to that saying everyday. If something bad happens, just say to yourself that it did happen for a reason and somehow, whether you may believe it or not, something will come good out of it. That good may not be for  you, but someone else. You never know. But everything DOES happen for a reason!|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	No but you can find reason in anything that happens. <br>  The dump truck of life dumps crap on all of us an some point or another Some people wallow in their pity on how it smells while others take the time to spread it around the yard and gardens and surround them selves with the beauty it helps create. <br>  It is not what happens what is important  it is how you respond to it. <br>  If all you do is abandon your will to it you will never see the benefits in the lesson you can learn from it.|`|yDB2EUbDaa	yes<br>  everyone i have met i have met for a reason. It has been planed that i would meet them to DO something for them (and get something beautiful from them) like their humility or something.  In the beginning its all very confusing but once i see Gods plan for what He wants from this (what ever it is) its really beautiful how much he loves us, and places us in perfect positions for each other. like i met this lady who was crying in church and if i had just gone 20 minutes later i may never have met her. But something made me meet her to help her with what she was going through. We can just listen to his plan (and it always works out  best when we do) or not. We can choose to do right or wrong to help those who are in our path or just leave them wondering if anyone loves them. <br>  And when it seems like everything is going wrong maybe im just suppose to offer it up for everyone who's going to hell, or just for someone who is miserable? This probably is not clear at what im trying to say at all but i hope i touched you in some way or another by how great and wonderful God is.|`|BS2dgOIWaa	I like the law of karma, because it's so easy to understand and apply to your life. If you want to apply that to your life you will make a very conscious effort to be a better person. Predestination is not something I subscribe to, but if that is a part of your belief system then I guess that's good for you.|`|6xC6OaAqaa	Nope. What's the reason for the innocent getting slaughtered, the homeless getting beat with bats by rich kids, and kids being left in garbage cans? Some kind of great divine plan huh? Spare me.

I really prefer to believe in free will, which seems to validate choosing good over bad... Perhaps I could say that I believe some things happen for a reason.|`|AA10729675	Oh, yes.  Absolutely.  Even if this reason is put to light years later, many years later.|`|eph8JOhBaa	no I don't. whose reason? it's just a way of coping with everything that life throw at you.|`|A01w1dHqaa	yes...The reason is to learn to love.|`|81f4bd177f89ba16026dc0eb51fd1cbaaa	Yes everything does happen for a reason -- this is very clearly demonstrated when one looks back on their life and see how everything, like a spiders web linked to get them where they are. <br>  <br>  This is true to me, because of things I have experienced, which showed me a determinism of events. There are no coincidences, one who is in a state of suffering, is for some form of development. Everything happening for a reason, doesn't mean it has to coincide with ones very limited perceptions -- it doesn't have to be politically correct. And the person who said what they said was reality, it's not.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	No, I don't. Because I've seen enough to know better. And because I live my life as logically as possible, and faith is a logical fallacy by its very nature.<br>  <br>  My godmother was a saint. She was kind to everyone and helped everyone she could. She was always there for you whether you were happy or sad. She had an emotionally abusive husband. She died in her forties of stomach cancer, slowly and painfully. While this was happening, her husband was unattentive, unsupportive, and uncaring. His family made jokes at her expense as she was on her deathbed, and he allowed it. After she died, he got a chance with another woman whom he is still with, even though she knows about everything he's done.<br>  <br>  I don't have the faith to believe that any of that was for a reason. And none of it has a practical reason to our world. None of it has benefited anyone, nor will it ever. Not unless you contend that her body will provide the fertilizer for some miraculous tree that will cure cancer.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Hmm, yes i like to. It make me feel better in a **** situation and then more optimistic about the future, But as said by the first answerer, it may not apply to everything...but i think some people are just meant to be evil to try us...and get stronger.<br>  <br>  To get on with it: why don't you get on with it, stop being one of those people who uses their bad life as an excuse. Iv also had a **** life and alot of hurt but i'm not using it as an excuse as to why my life may not be what i want. Iv worked for everything iv got...maybe you should try it too.

And by observing - knowing - understanding (science) we can change our futures|`|UW6mrUOSaa	i think "everything happens for a reason" insofar as events and actions have earthly causes and consequences. but, i don't believe in fate or the notion that everything happens for a spiritually significant reason.|`|fvPoiaAXaa	I live by that rule as well.

EFmdy8kiaa	No.  It is only the format that constitutes a sonnet.  Sonnets are 14 line poems in iambic pentameter (short syllable, long syllable X 5.)  The subject matter is whatever you choose to do.  The only thing that differs is the rhyme scheme.<br>  <br>  For instance: the two most famous types are Shakespearean and Petrarchan sonnets.  The rhyme scheme for a Petrarchan: the first eight lines create an octave, with the rhyme scheme a b b a a b b a. The last six lines make up a sestet and may consist of following rhyme schemes: 1) c d d c d d 2) c d e c d e 3) c d c d c d.<br>  <br>  for a shakespearean the rhyme scheme is abab cdcd efef gg|`|dQmFoRRiaa	It's just the form; the possibilities for topic are all but inexhaustible.|`|v0596BTeaa	It is the form.  Sonnets have 14 lines, rhyme at the end in a pattern - although patterns vary, are often written in iambic pentameter - 10 syllables to a line, but can be about any topic, although they often are about love.  Sonnet is Italian for 'little song'.

q9KsymlIaa	This is a very honest poem that makes me wonder if you have lost someone close recently - I think the line when you say "looking down to see if I am ok" is really effective because it introduces a note of panic and also gives the poem a dramatic and dreamlike note - looking down to where? From where?<br>  <br>  I think "ha" is like a note of sarcasm - perhaps these are the thoughts of someone confronting death trying to convince him or herself that it will be a welcome relief - then they realize they are scared.<br>  <br>  All good so far. But I wonder if some of the thoughts here are a bit cliched - maybe you could have found a shorter, more "poetic" way of saying them? This read more like a dramatic monologue than a poem.<br>  <br>  In Hamlet, Shakespeare wrote:<br>  <br>  "Since no man has aught of what he leaves<br>  What is't to leave betimes? Let be"<br>  <br>  Which says more in two lines than most poems do in 16. <br>  <br>  Of course, that was Shakespeare, and that doesn't stop your poem being good, which it is.
oLkjwMWYaa	i thought that was really good! it makes me want to keep reading it.  it was very well written- if the rest of the plot is good, i'm sure it has a chance. what age group is this for? children/teen/adult? but yeah, definitely want to read more!|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	Absolutely you have a chance. This is very good stuff! If it is cleaned up a bit you could probably submit it to certain markets. Although...I wouldn't necessarily depend on people's feedback on Y!A. Fellow writers, editors, and agents are the best judges of your work.<br>  <br>  If you want to be a published writer, I'd suggest this:<br>  1) Make a schedule for yourself to write, instead of writing on a whim. This is how most successful writers get published and improve their writing. <br>  2) Try joining a writer's group where you can get critiqued by other writers - some critique can be useful, the rest discarded.<br>  3) Buy or borrow a copy of The Writer's Market<br>  4) Read Stephen King's memoir "On Writing". My creative writing teacher is using his memoir as our textbook. I've read quite a few How-to books on writing, and SK's memoir is the best by far.<br>  (Another good book "The Novel Writer's Tookit")<br>  5) Write a lot and read a lot. <br>  <br>  I'm so glad to see a fellow writer.

I am very interested in the story, and it makes me want to keep reading the book. I think that if you worked on editing it a bit more, depending on the storyline that it comes out to be, that yes, you would have a chance. :-)
mmnkMU5paa	Your question in asking "What did they mean?" does actually reflect the purpose of Socrates's questions, which were to obtain what Aristotle calls "universal definitions" of what various things mean.<br>  <br>  Aristotle attributes two contributions of Socrates to philosophy which were (1) inductive argument and (2) universal definition in his treatise on being entitled The Metaphysics, which he called primary philosophy or "1st philosophy", quote<br>  <br>  ARISTOTLE:<br>  "But it was natural that Socrates should seek the essence [ie. formula or definition KB] For he was seeking to syllogize [reason deductively KB] and 'what a thing is' (ie. The essence KB) is the starting point of syllogisms.  But there was as yet none of the dialectical power which enables people even without knowledge of the essence to speculate about contraries and inquire whether the same science deals with contraries.  For 2 things may fairly be ascribed to Socrates --- inductive arguments and universal definition, both which are concerned with the starting point of science."<br>  <br>  ****Metaphysics BK  13. Ch. 4; 1078b lines 23-30 ****<br>  <br>  So another way of trying to determine 'what a thing is' or its "essence" is to, very similarly, ask, 'What does this mean?', which is your exact question above cited.  In effect "What do my friends mean by saying that I have a tendency to reason Socratically?"  In other words, "What is the essence of the Socratical thought process?"  In short, "What does the Socratic thought process mean?"<br>  <br>  That process is excellently demonstrated by your question.  You are asking 'what is the essence?" of such "Socratic" process, which is exactly to obtain the "essences" or "meanings" of things.  That process is exactly what Socrates was trying to do with his questions.<br>  <br>  Your first 2 answerers are wrong in saying that Socrates "knew nothing".  What Socrates actually said was that he never thought that he knew something which he, in fact, did not know.  Others, whom he questioned, had that failing, in thinking that they knew things, which, in fact, they did not know.  Socrates thought that was the most blameable form of ignorance --- to think one knows something which he does not know, for that kind of ignorance is entirely difficult to cure, whereas acknowledged ignorance facilitates learning, for humans naturally desire to learn about things which they do not know.<br>  <br>  In trying to discover what things mean, you share the same attitude and desire to learn as Plato describes as Socrates's major characteristic in the Platonic dialogues.  Don't ever lose that curious characteristic which you share with Socrates.<br>  <br>  Kevin|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Well, the Socratic method is shown through many of Plato's books. Basically, it involves making lots of statements to an opponent, then pointing out where his views contradict themselves. You end up looking clever, leaving the opponent looking foolish.|`|Cfuy2fHSaa	he thought the only wisdom is knowing that you know nothing|`|AA10729675	maieutics.

If your friends haven't actually read the book then they can't really judge it, can they?|`|xOcfOy1vaa	guys can like it too.|`|5JKLgnyeaa	no, guys can read it too. no book is made for one gender or race. girls like the book and guys choose not to like it to look cool and manly. reading isnt somthing only a girl can do and because girls are reading a book doesnt mean that you cant read the same one. a real man would do whatever they want without giving a damn what people think.|`|L280cFeOaa	YES. Well really i'm only saying that because it's awful and you shouldn't read it. It's NOT just for girls but it seriously is awful.|`|nhNa2NZuaa	well not necesarilly if you like young-adult romance with vampires and that sort of things you should really read it.I love it!|`|4FqP313qaa	no way!!!!<br>  i love it..!! =)|`|AnSFRCnraa	No way its for boys and girls, so ignore your friends when they make fun of it and tell them they don't need to diss it until they've read the series then they have that right...if they don't like it that is which will probably be unlikely.So read it cause I think its cool when guys read Twilight.And I agree I don't like Bella either.|`|Wjc3Lc9Zaa	No book in this world is for a certain gender [unless it is mentioned by the author or something], so Twilight is NOT just for girls. Sure, girls can relate to the books more because it is from a girl's [Bella] POV, but guys will love the action in it!|`|bw9JNUCSaa	Its not really for a specific gender, but more girls read it than guys. If you want to read it then you should (: Buuut you may not enjoy it that much. It depends... Do you mind romance in books? Cause thats basically all thats in twilight lmao<br>  (:|`|bgbUQ3Wnaa	No way. Many boys I know are reading the series and enjoy it. Just because it's about romance doesn't mean guys can't watch or read it, too. Tell your friends if they read it or if they saw it they would probably like it too. Good luck (:|`|TOAiSbPYaa	No not all the Books they are just written in Bella's POV so girls relate to them the most ....But guys who read them are usualy just obsessed as the girls so the answer to your qusten is no, not at all !<br>  <br>  <br>  ** Esme Cullen **|`|440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	Twilight should only be used to keep a wobbly table level.|`|jzdDF3Ljaa	some boys like it.<br>  <br>  but I didnt.<br>  <br>  and I'm a girl.|`|AVYBazOEaa	Not at all;- Loads of guys like it.|`|jybtJVa6aa	noooo i know like 50 guys who read it<br>  my brother actually tried reading but hes a loser and cant stick to anything<br>  but yeah i would have never thought he would read it<br>  but its for both <br>  i personally love the book but hate bella =/<br>  so yeah its boring in the beginning <br>  just heads up|`|0bvjQtyhaa	no its not a chick flick. it has were wolves and vampires in it thats not the point i thi9nk its a great book for both genders and all ages. but breaking dawn is a little more mature|`|14HpUr89aa	Personally I like guys that read books.|`|1g9EJiwIaa	your friends are just trying to be cool. anyone can read anything they want, including guys reading love stories.|`|kT2dQhfNaa	No I know 2 guys who have read it and enjoyed it.|`|z2eEgDk4aa	NO!<br>  <br>  www.twilightguy.com|`|5uAaJfaaaa	nope a load of my boy mates love it

Hell IS supposed to intimidate (I thought that was obvious), but the bible doesn't actually say what modern religion says it is. Life on earth is the desolation (or hell) that the book of genesis talks about. The King James bible has hundreds of mistranslations.|`|H6ixrUYLaa	All of this really depends on what you believe, but I don't think God is the one that sends a person to Hell.  I think that's the devil's doing.  So he's not the one hurting us.<br>  And I don't believe that people go to Hell for eternity.  I believe in different levels of Hell.  When you have paid back for all your sins, you will return to Heaven.|`|2nsUmrV5aa	Your question is ironic. Christianity is not a lie. God doesnt send you to Hell, neither does the devil. You make a choice. Your choice will either get you excepted into Heaven or God will choose to deny you. God doesnt have control over your life. He gave you free will. The only place God decides to have control is in Heaven. During judgement, if you made the CHOICE to deny Christ, then He will deny you just the same. You are then given into sin (satan) and must suffer the consequence, of the wrong choice you made, in Hell.

Experts say that the amount of knowledge we learn in the first five years of life would take 10,000 years to learn as an adult.

If our learning mechanism goes a bit too far at times, realize what a hugely powerful too imitation is and you will see that these "robotic" concerns are trivia.|`|CLB32006aa	People want to feel accepted and if you don't follow what is culturally accepted like a robot then you might not be socially accepted.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Keep thinking :)|`|bC5XeVEIaa	We're not. Because if we were really robots, then we'd be logical and would let emotion interfere with our decisions.<br>  <br>  As for your interpretation of the figurative sense, it's because we are capable of being programmed just the same as robots. And we are, every day of our lives. Faulty data that goes into the appeal of minority demographics perpetuates harmful stereotypes. The news perpetuates misconceptions on current events that no one questions.<br>  <br>  And at an even deeper sense, we are engines of social, psychological and physical conditioning. There is something known as the Pavlovian Response. It affects us all. You should look it up.<br>  <br>  We basically are robots. Very intelligent, advanced, biological robots equipped with illogical emotion, but robots nonetheless.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	"Necessary" is a judgment that can only be decided by your brain, nothing inherently necessary. We're a bunch of robots, but as far as I can tell, we all act in opposition to that whether or not we believe it. It is convenient to say we are all robots because we can conceptually avoid responsibility for ourselves.|`|YmtNel5haa	Robots don't display inhibitions, insecurities or any other emotions that humans experience.<br>  I don't think your question makes any sense.<br>  and I don't mean to offend you but it just doesn't.|`|xmnlLubzaa	Because out of combination of society, most people have been and are currently being brainwashed into thinking that they must do just as others do- if they do not, and instead they think for themselves, they are abnormal and outcasts to be spitten upon-  In addition, people are conditioned to be emotionless and apathetic like robots. Just watch the news for example- "In Iraq, 22 soldiers killed, all had family and children, oh well , BUT IN HOLLYWOOD NEWS!!!" --  Think about all of what society brings to people >> insecurities, conformity, blindness, immorality, violence, the list goes on and on--   Then I constantly hear people saying, "Oh, these kids today are this and that and everything bad"-- It is in no way the kids fault- Look at what they have to live with everyday > only those blessed with EXTREME willpower will be able to end up positive.   I think that you should be applauded very much for being one of the few to actually notice this phenomena!|`|H6ixrUYLaa	I agree.  People do act much like robots.<br>  People are taught that having a family and a lot of money is the "American dream".  It's the thing everyone wants, right?  I mean, if you're taught to want that, the chances that you will is high.<br>  Then there's the media.  The most disgusting provoker of all.  They put out movies, music, video games, etc. of skinny fake girls and power hungry boys.  Nice cars, long blonde hair, action packed lives.  People eat that up.  They want it.<br>  The majority of people won't take a step back from the media and all that's put in front of their vacant minds to see that life isn't about it at all.  In most extreme cases (the great depression, as an example), the truth is revealed because people don't have anything else.  They take care of each other instead of racing across highways just to get to the mall before the car behind them.<br>  If people realized that, then I doubt they would be a big bunch of robots.|`|KXiwLOtOaa	I think you are asking why in general people in society tend to behave in a more sheep-like fashion than they once did. I think it is probably the institutionalization. A child today is usually put in day-care at a very young age and then kept in one institution or the other till they come out of university. After that they often take work with a large employer with very similar structuring to the schools they have become accustomed to. All of these institutions need to control large numbers of people and so maintain highly regimented organization. In such an environment individual thinking usually causes one grief or at the very least is not very helpful so we gradually become conditioned to simply follow along and not make waves. This is of course all fine until the powers that be either fail or develop an agenda that is harmful to us and in that situation we really are in deep dodo. At a guess I would say that time is now.|`|vPeNKLK7aa	Biological robots.  Driven by greed.  Controlled by mass media lies & deception.  Fooled into believing that this is as good as it gets.  Programmed at school, drained of all usefulness at work and then left on the pensioner's scrapheap to waste away.

Even in the absence of a cop, there is a feeling in us that the police is just around. Most of the time, it is not because we dislike something wrong--wrong in the eyes of the society, but because of the consequences. Social domination--what we have been told from childhood has been inscribed in our body and taken as something natural. I like the works of  Michel Foucault on how society creates and recreates docile bodies.

YupMCYHlaa	Life expectancy improved by 15 or 20 years during the 20th century.  You could look up the numbers.  But in a way that's misleading.<br>  <br>  In ancient times, average life expectancy was somewhere in the 30s, but there were lots of people running around in their 60s and 70s and even 80s.  The reason life expectancy was so low is that there was a lot of infant and child mortality.  And it was the same up to the 19th century, nearly half of all deaths were before the 10th birthday.<br>  <br>  In the 20th century there was a concerted effort by governments of developed countries to fight childhood diseases through vaccines, better nutrition, etc.  Infant and child mortality are way down as a result.  Some diseases that used to kill thousands of kids a year are almost unknown today, like smallpox, tuberculosis, polio, diptheria, tetanus, whooping cough, etc.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	'It's That Guy' has a very good answer.  Indeed, infant mortality was high; most adults expected to live into their seventies.  Dante (author of the Divine Comedy, in the Middle Ages) wrote that he was wandering in the woods 'in the middle of his life', meaning he was 35 years old.<br>  <br>  But did Health Care increase life expentcancy a lot, in the 19th century?<br>  Maybe it has lately, as it's gone up to 75 for men...The first increase for males in decades.  But back in the 19th, very few people could AFFORD decent health care; especially seniors (no public pensions back then).<br>  That's why so many people bought 'quack' medicines, that did more harm than good.  Many argue that most of the improvement has come from better nutrition, and better cleanliness.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Sorry, I usually charge for homework answers.<br>  <br>  I mean....it is quite obvious.

Their labour was not cheap, it was free...this idea that slavers crippled themselves with overheads is simply not true. Don't watch reruns of Roots, thinking that slaves were all happy in the Plantations...they were expected to subsist, grow their own food, fend for themselves to agreat extent. They did not get a health plan or pension you know! <br>  So, the pro slavery lobby knew how much our western economy depended on that free labour.

1A4klmh7aa	The UK title is the "real" title. That's why real literary purists will read the UK versions only (or first).<br>  <br>  They didn't want to put "Philosopher" on the American version for a couple reasons. They were worried that American children wouldn't know what "Philosopher" meant (which is likely, knowing how ignorant some American youth are).<br>  <br>  Also, there was hesitation to use the word "Philosopher" because it implies a link to philosophy, which is entirely too lofty and unappealing to American audiences. <br>  <br>  So, the title was changed to try and appeal to the masses because of the cultural differences. I don't think it would have really mattered all that much, but what's done is done. <br>  <br>  I've read that J.K. Rowling regrets letting them change the name on the American version, though.|`|KPJ8uFuUaa	You can watch the trailer here <a href="http://thehotmovies.info/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-hd-trailer" rel="nofollow">http://thehotmovies.info/harry-potter-an...</a> <br>  :)|`|ZMSG9Jdaaa	sorcerer and philosepher is probably a pretty close translation.|`|zFOC0PZnaa	Apparently, the American editors thouth that Americans were stupid and wouldn't know what a Philosopher was. Seriously, that's the only reason. I don't know about you, but I definitely know what a philosopher is, and I know that it's different from a sorcerer. So there was really no reason at all for them to change it, but there's nothing we can do about it now.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	all of the books have slight differences. i think you should read both versions, personally. it's nice to get a taste of another culture once in a while
MBZTkOJ7aa	Okay, let's see. I have absolutely no clue what your book report is all about, but I'm guessing you had to write about the characters, author, atmosphere, opinion, yada, yada, yada... right?<br>  What I always do for book reports (if oral), I say something like (fitted for twilight) "So if I was to give the book a rating from 1 to 10, 10 being the best, I'd give it a 10, because it was a page-turner and i couldn't stop reading. It was perfect and impossibly interesting! I'd recommend to all girls under 18!"<br>  <br>  If it's a written book report (not about the characters but your personal opinion) I'd finish with a summarizing sentence. For example: Overall, the book was a great read, which expanded my vocabulary and also triggered a curiosity for vampires in me.<br>  <br>  I don't know, something like that. Try not to finish it with a super short sentence like "It was good." <br>  Make it final. <br>  <br>  And remember that the last sentence is not your last paragraph, meaning that you should not try to summarize your whole book report in one sentence. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped a bit! =]|`|fGwZMglGaa	and so the deer loved the lamb.<br>  Or whatever it is lol<br>  Something like that.<br>  Or, forever ends now.|`|Li0q9NKCaa	I would need to read your whole book report sorry|`|TZTJRrM4aa	This book sucked.<br>  <br>  thats a good ending sentence!|`|jBOZfs9Qaa	When you can live forever; what do you live for?|`|uhHfm3Azaa	forever. begins. now.|`|rFmBtm3eaa	"I am sorry" would be the perfect ending sentence to your Twilight book report.
wGEYqauWaa	You need to make sure that the capo you buy is for a 6 string steel string acoustic guitar.

esOaJoqBaa	Initially it caused Christian to go underground. They had to hide their beliefs, and often worshiped in catacombs. Those who did not hide it were often executing. This spurred on the movement by creating martyrs and saints whom people looked up to and revered. This lasted until  the time of Constantine, who made Christianity the official religion.|`|KV9iJyjqaa	it created a lot of martyrs and sympathy for the Christianity. however since the roman empire was a multi-ethnic entity, most of the persecution was derived from the emperors, the regular people subjugated by the Romans by no means share the same sentiments. as such, they either became Christians as well or simply did not care. by 200ce, despite Roman persecutions, converts to Christianity began to incorporate latin and greek politicians and intellects and gain influence in the upper levels. <br>  <br>  the story goes that Constantine converted because it helped him win a battle and the emperorship at 312ce. the edict of milan legalized christianity but by no means installed it as the official religion, the emperor after Constantine, Julian the Apostate, was pagan. perhaps what attracted to Constantine about Christianity was its universality - meaning it accepts everyone. this was something that Constantine could used to unite a fractured Roman empire under attacked constantly by foreign invasions and domestic revolts.

The Federalists were led by John Adams and Alexander Hamilton while Jefferson and Madison led the Democratic Republicans, the forerunners of today's Democratic party but composed of the conservative elements which represent today's Republican party. Kinda funny he said this back in the 1790s and here we are 230-240 years later still failing to achieve this.
4U7327Mzaa	Well to begin with, he was a decorated hero in the French and Indian War.  The British Army, of which he was then a part, respected him enough to promote him.  Then later, in the American Revolutionary War, he led his army to defeat the British and played a key role in America's independence.  He went on to become the first US President.  As far as I am concerned, those are major things.  In my opinion, George Washington WAS and IS a hero.

EFmdy8kiaa	In my opinion no.  It's a very fine line to tread between making your characters related and making them essentially the same.   If your supporting character had a completely separate goal/plot, then what would make him a supporting character?  Without something in common between them, it's almost like you're telling two different stories instead of one unified one.  Your readers will constantly be jumping back and forth between plot lines and often, if the characters have similar mannerisms or undistinguished dialogue, readers may get confused.  When the distinguishing between characters fades, you're really in trouble because you have to go back and rewrite from the part where the clarification began to get lost, and often you don't realize that this has happened until an enormous amount of information has been compromised. <br>  <br>  My advice is for you to have your main character have a distinctive goal, but then have the supporting character in either the same situation with less prominence than the main character (playing a more minor part in whatever your plot calls for) OR have the main character and supporting character have a common place, event, time, etc. at which they meet one another and the reader gets the two stories related at the same time.  For example, the main character is going through some traumatic event, but the main character and supporting character meet every tuesday, friday, and sunday for drinks at a local bar.  Something along those lines.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|f2e71f6Gaa	yes definitely it would be a lot more interesting for the supporting character to have a goal as well other wise the character could appear boring and not really of much use in the book.|`|LbVxNyKxaa	well, wouldnt they have to some how be related to one another?|`|b59YABdDaa	It would be better if I had an idea of what specifically those goals are but generally speaking I think that would be really interesting. if the supporting character had the same goals and plot line then he/she would always be outshone by the main character. With a seperate goal and plotline the supporting character won't be a waste of lines: he or she might be able to make a greater and more interesting impact on the story. I hope that helps.

I would also feel guilty for just abandoning my family and friends. Just ditching them for someone I've known for a few weeks. My friends and family would be more important to me than a boyfriend.|`|Wjc3Lc9Zaa	I agree with the first answer.<br>  Bella didn't GIVE UP her life...she NEEDED to become a vampire to SAVE her life.

bmv05Tk6aa	Visit Bboy.org to find all the stretches/workouts you need for Bboying (breakdancing). Very supportive community if you are interested in the culture and the dance :)<br>  <br>  ABOUT THE QUESTION: If you begin learning the foundations (toprock, 6-step, baby freeze, etc), you'll start to develop the musles. Because, although you can work out in a weight room, a lot of bboying/breaking develops "odd" muscles, only worked whilst breaking. Begin with the basics, and you'll already start to develop the muscles. STRETCH EVERY DAY ALSO!<br>  <br>  P.S. - A lot of it is more about balance, style, rhythm, and creativity. To be a true bboy/bgirl, you're expected to be able to Toprock and Downrock along with the Power moves (the "ooh and ahh" moves).  But if you're just looking to do those Power Moves, then yes, upper body strength/stamina/balance is imperative.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and have fun! I know I do haha.|`|G2mJppm0aa	All of them.|`|WvlGfAqWaa	You need a lot of upper body strength for breakdancing.  So you would need strong biceps, triceps, and shoulders.  Also, you need a strong core for balance.  So you would need to work on your abdominal muscles.  The best workout to target all of these areas, would be to hold plank position for about a minute to a minute and a half a few times a day.|`|pehaGih3aa	You need a great deal of strength in both your upper and lower body.  Work your chest, biceps, triceps, all of your abs, quads, hamstrings shoulders back, calves, wrists and ankles.<br>  <br>  However, strength and rhythm alone won't do much for you unless you have a great deal of flexibility.  Take some yoga classes or get somneone to teach you how to do some really intense, deep stretches.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

oLkjwMWYaa	ok, I think the preface is way too...short. you need to build the scene a bit, don't just go strait to her lying on the floor soaked in blood, you have to Create suspense suspense suspense - that's what really makes a book scary, suspense.  like start it off how its pitch black in the dead of night, she knows something is wrong, her hearts pounding, he hears something,  she realizes she's soaked in blood, starts to shake, to scared to move, suddenly - she sees so and so standing in the shadows...just build the scene.  <br>  <br>  as for the first chapter, its super super fast. i've written stories before too and it takes forever to write but then you read it and its only 2 pages. i would start it out by having lisa getting ready for the dinner, thinking back on her slow day at work, that way it doesn't go through 6 hours in 1 paragraph.<br>  <br>  but it sounds like a good story, just add some suspense and don't move move through the story too fast. but you can just email me if you want anymore of my advice or help on grammer or anything. i'm actually looking into being an editor..so yeah, nice story and good luck!|`|bUeMqGgMaa	Too convenient that a gun lay on the floor.|`|DCEygQ96aa	make the preface abit more fast moving.|`|pqwan2Vuaa	your story needs more descriptive or adjectives  to make it more like BAM! you know what i mean?to start off with a good story you always want to engage the reader and make them want to read more so take a look at your opening sentence and see if it needs a Better one.oh,and check your grammar and spelling.<br>  <br>  <br>  need more tips tricks just email

It has a much different tone that your usual poems.<br>  I think it emotes childlike sentiments ... especially the 3rd and 4th stanzas. You could put "in sin" in quotations which would give the illusion of it being more a child's memory than a teens, but i wouldn't change too much with this.

The references made of the family and the simple word choice really gave it away for me.  <br>  <br>  If you really want to employ better repetition to emphasize the child-like aspect, i would suggest a successive repetition, like almost an inculcation of an idea.  <br>  <br>  For example:   <br>  the wind was cold as I sat on the bank<br>  the same bank where I caught my first salmon<br>  my dad was so proud of me on that day-<br>  "so proud, so proud, he said."<br>  that day we fished off our Alaskan island<br>  <br>  I don't know if you will like that or not.

Just so happen the knife went down to my index finger and bout cut it off. Blood spurting , scared.. i wrapped it up in my tiny dress that i wore. Green stuff i found on the pond hoping daddy wouldnt see the mess i made cause i knew he would be mad. Coming back daddy saw right then my bloody dress and began to look as he unwound my hand.

So, the butterfly doesn't cause the tornado but is essential to the initial conditions resulting in a tornado.|`|pehaGih3aa	The short answer is that it is a metaphor. However, since you placed the question in the philsophical section here is the long answer.  All things in nature are connected by one common universal spirit.  It is possible to harness up an enormous amount of energy so that what would otherwise go un noticed, such as a butterfly's wings flapping--could other wise cause a hurricane!|`|392a91e32207acc30c423125f639d22aaa	The fall of one domino causes the rest of them to be triggered.

Carla feels annoyed by Turk and they both begin a small fight, the one that J.D tries to avoid by running away. In his attempt to run away, he collides with Laverne, who was holding some drinks and she drops them. Elliot then pops out and asks the Janitor to help her find a toy of her patient with Cancer. The Janitor, however, is busy cleaning the drinks Laverne dropped, so Elliot doesn't get any help from him. J.D then goes to a reunion with Dr. Kelso and Dr. Cox, but Dr. Cox was late, so J.D is given the privilege to run the hospital for a day. Meanwhile, Carla got in trouble with Dr. Kelso for being late in the morning, but Turk defends her (after the incident of the butterfly in the girl's breast), which upsets Carla because she didn't want to seem defenseless. Turk then asks her to go look for a lucky object of him, so Carla goes to their home. She finds an old chocolate and when she's about to eat it, Elliot calls to ask for her help to find the toy. Carla leaves to help Elliot and forgets to bring Turk his lucky object. Meanwhile, J.D and Dr. Cox are treating a patient who had abdominal pain, but none of them are sure about what he has. J.D spends some time trying to imitate Dr. Cox now that he gets to run the hospital. Elliot then appears again and asks J.D to ask for his help to find the toy so he goes to help her and doesn't run tests on his patient. Elliot doesn't find the toy and disappoints her little patient. Turk is upset at Carla for forgetting his lucky object so they both begin a small quarrel. Right then, the patient J.D was treating goes through an aortic intersection that could only be treated with urgent surgery. Turk feels demoralized without his lucky object but he goes to operate on the guy anyway. Unfortunately, he didn't manage to save the patient and the patient dies.<br>  <br>  However, the show then changes when something else happens at the beginning. The butterfly, instead of landing in the girl's breast, lands in the chest of a hairy guy. Both J.D and Turk stare with disgust and Carla notices how both of them preferred to look at the guy rather than at the girl's breasts when they were so revealed. No fight occurs between Turk or Carla, so J.D doesn't move from his place and doesn't collide with Laverne and her drinks. Because the drinks don't fall, the Janitor doesn't need to clean anything, so he decides to help Elliot look for her patient's toy. The Janitor has access to the lost and found, so Elliot recovers the missing toy. J.D, however, was late for his reunion with Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso because he had been talking with Turk and Carla, so he doesn't get to run the hospital. Once again, Dr. Kelso screams at Carla for being late, and this time, Turk doesn't defend her. This upsets Carla because she wanted Turk to defend her, but he still asks her to look for his lucky object. Carla goes home and because Elliot doesn't call her, she has time to eat the old chocolate she had found. The chocolate was rotten so she rushes to the bathroom to throw up. In the bathroom, she finds Turk's lucky object and goes to the hospital. Because Elliot didn't need J.D's help and J.D couldn't mock Dr. Cox's way of teaching, J.D has time to run some tests on his patient. He discovers then that he was close on having an aortic interception and he is taken to surgery (though it was not urgent). Turk is more enthusiastic now that he had his object so he goes to operate the patient with a smile. Unfortunately, he couldn't be saved, and the patient dies. <br>  <br>  I think it's a really clear example about the Butterfly Effect and how things can end up in a way we didn't expect them to be. I hope that wasn't too long x3|`|8uJVN1n3aa	You should do your own homework, but its just a metaphor for small actions having large and exponential consequences.|`|U3ZJzfDQaa	It's the butterfly effect :), where the wings of a butterfly can change the wind climate and things go bad from there.|`|uXN1SkEOaa	Nopeey x|`|mXUKca6naa	...riding on the back of a nuclear warhead ICBM detonating in the Caribbean Sea and drastically changing the weather patterns causing a destructive hurricane to devastate the islands of the Caribbean as it heads north...|`|AA10729675	It means that we are responsible for our actions.

Putting a mask on something else is bad.|`|4Y1qzeBfaa	Apparently, sometimes it hurts people feelings to be too honest...<br>  But I rather be honest and tell someone what's on my mind instead of letting them assume.<br>  <br>  I'm french, and we have the tendency to tell it how it is, which is why we are perceived to be rude by some people|`|fvPoiaAXaa	It's good to be honest, but not brutally honest. to the point of crushing people's feelings and hopes and dreams lol. <br>  <br>  sometimes when someone asks you "do i look weird" its okay to say a little white lie and say that they look fine. but if its your best best friend or close relative, etc you should just tell them straight up how you feel so they dont make a fool out of themselves. but in a gentle manner.|`|uXN1SkEOaa	Yhh x|`|MJR4Om7taa	Do you want an honest answer? You wouldn't like that so maybee I should just smile instead<br>  <br>  :-)<br>  <br>  It depends on the person, I'm someone who doesn't lie as he doesn't see the need, I'm no angel but I don't need to hide anything. And I prefer people to be completely honest with me inall, even when it's harsh, it's constructive and at least I know I can trust that person to be honest with me no matter what. Some might say I'm a bastard but I'm just honest, you know you can trust me and that I'm not hiding anything, you might not like that but that’s your problem. And I expect the same of others; I don't get upset by what people say to me so let loose, anything bad is constructive etc...<br>  <br>  (I don't go around randomly insulting people BTW, I'm only honest if I'm asked, otherwise, their is no need... That's just rudeness)<br>  <br>  BUT! It depends on the person, not many people like me and many get hurt and upset. So case out who you want to be first :-)<br>  <br>  People can make a case about 'what if you need to lie to cover something you or someone did wrong' well, I wouldn't, I've done bad things but I'll freely admit I've done them, and I'll expect others to do the same, and not lie to cover their cowardice.<br>  <br>  I often find those not liked by society for being 'rude, callus bastards' are usually the ones that can be trusted to be honest, and a lot of what society deems 'nice, charming people' will lie and stab you in the back.<br>  <br>  As I said though, their is a differance between honesty and being rude, namely if it's not nice then hold your tongue unless you are asked or feel it's needed<br>  <br>  That’s my opinion anyway. :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL:<br>  <br>  the other aspect of your question 'is it bad' now you are bringing up the idea of good and bad, is their such a thing or is it all a matter of perspective? I'll leave that to your own thinking|`|V1IipJkGaa	You have pretty much answered your own question but it needs fine tuning.  I try to make a point of alerting people that if they only want to hear what they already believe, don't bother asking me.  Then again, if asked, you need to evaluate the repercussions of your answer.  Sometimes no answer at all is better than a truth that will unnecessarily cause pain to someone you care about; it's a tough call.  If not asked, especially in a situation that does not directly involve you, keeping your mouth shut is usually the best bet.  Honesty is many times the best policy, but silence has virtues of it's own.|`|IX4i2tjcaa	honesty seems to be a naked person, we need to dress it and sometimes make it apealing in order to be acceptable and rare cases we need to mix honesty with lies so it won't be too obvious. honest people don't exist, we are a generation of liers and deceivers. why can't we just tell the truth, because of this and that. even i do this and sometimes wonder why i do it? why is it difficult? i guess because we don't want to be hated, but its our culture that makes honesty and truth to be ugly and wrong. that's the honest thing about us.|`|bbdOikOqaa	No its not bad to be honest. Its just easier to lie. Sometimes white lies are ok tho as they can help people but honestly is the best policy. Unless what you are saying can hurt someone. If that's the case and theres no reason behind it (to help them for instance) then thoughts should be kept to peoples selves|`|gaHc6UONaa	how can you be too honest... oh wait yeah it is for example a friend wants to go to a party or concert (whatever) and her parents ask you where is she ? if you say the truth you would be betraying her agreed??|`|WgBSE0DCaa	i definitely think it depends on what you're being honest about.<br>  you have a friend that looks like Sloth from the Goonies.<br>  and she asks you if you think she's pretty.<br>  What are you gonna tell her?<br>  haha.|`|2nsUmrV5aa	No. Honesty or even Lots of Honesty is better than a lie.<br>  <br>  If you dont wanto tell the truth, then dont say anything at all.|`|Cwex6straa	The truth hurts sometimes. I prefer the harsh truth to comforting lies any day but some people don't.|`|qfQ3gJV4aa	No not really depends if it hurts people's feelings ....<br>  Try to think before you say things. But try not to lie too much either.<br>  Good Luck .|`|AA11564934	Of course "Mom you look really fat in that and this dinner tastes horrible"<br>  <br>  wow|`|AA10729675	No.  This is the only thing we own: the courage to be honest.  This is a duty and a privilege.<br>  However, since things are not always in such contrast, if your too much of honesty has to harm someone, then just hold your words, and do not harm.  We do not have to be aggressive or harmful in our honesty, especially verbally.
mMnRmYvNaa	Always. I've written 60 articles for the Herald Mail that were predictions of the future -- way out beyond anyone could imagine -- every single one came true -- zero errors -- 100% perfect predictions. <br>  <br>  A few of my pieces are still up on the internet if you Google "Robert Gary Herald-Mail". I predicted the global economic collapse two weeks before it happened. The details in my article were 100% accurate. <br>  <br>  I also gave investment advice in another article. It has turned out to be 100% correct. I said buy junk silver coins when they were selling at $11.25 per ounce, now they are selling at $14.01 per ounce. <br>  <br>  Seeing the future is my gift, or curse. I see it, I say it, and people just go on, 99% pay no attention, then it happens, just like I said, then most forget what I said, then I offer a new prediction, and 1% pay attention -- it's the Cassandra syndrome.<br>  <br>  My articles are now appearing on Helium.com.

bC5XeVEIaa	I think, therefor I am. Existence is objective. The existence of perception is existence in itself. The fact that you ask this question at all means that you exist. The fact that the word nonexistence exists means that something exists to have made the discrepancy between existence and nonexistence.<br>  <br>  And the fact that you were capable of making a decision on my answer to your question in order to give it a thumbs down means that you exist. Why do we believe that we exist? Because we BELIEVE that we exist. If we didn't exist, neither would the mental facilities to identify our own existence.<br>  <br>  Edit: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7o...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: "Do people need to exist for me to talk to them?"<br>  <br>  Not necessarily. But you must exist to talk to them or to identify them.<br>  <br>  Edit: "Nothing can ever exist. It's impossible."<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as the concept of impossibility without the concept of possibility. To say that one thing is impossible is to say that something, in its place, is possible. To say that existence is impossible is to say that non-existence is possible. And to identify it as a possible concept brings that concept, that idea, into an existence all its own. <br>  <br>  Nothingness transcends words. If it can be identified as nothingness, then it can be identified as such as an element, or lack thereof, outside of oneself. To regard it as impossible is to regard it as a consequential element, even if only an idea, and it therefor exists.<br>  <br>  I can do this all day. You can thumbs down all you want, it doesn't make it any less true.|`|26DoxkOBaa	Whatever is infinite must transcend duality; it cannot be one part of duality. That which is truly infinite cannot be the dual part of the finite. If the infinite is regarded as existing side by side with the finite it is no longer infinite, for it then becomes the second part of duality. God, Who is infinite, cannot descend into duality. So, the apparent existence of duality as infinite God and the finite world is illusory. God alone is real. He is infinite. One without a second. The existence of the finite is only apparent; it is false; it is not real.<br>  <br>  How does the false world of finite things come into existence? Why does it exist? It is created by Maya or the principle of ignorance. Maya is not illusion, it is the creator of illusion. Maya is not false, it is that which gives false impressions. Maya is not unreal; it is that which makes the real appear unreal and the unreal appear real. Maya is not duality, it is that which causes duality. For the purposes of intellectual explanation Maya must be looked upon as being infinite. It creates the illusion of finitehood; it is not in itself finite. All the illusions which are created by Maya are finite, and the entire universe of duality, which appears to exist due to Maya, is also finite. The universe may seem to contain innumerable things but that does not make it infinite. Stars may be countless; there are a huge number, but the total collection of stars is nevertheless finite. Space and time might seem to be infinitely divisible, but they are nevertheless finite. Everything which is finite and limited belongs to the world of illusion, but the principle which causes this illusion of finite things must, in a sense, be regarded as not being an illusion.    <br>  <br>  Maya cannot be considered as being finite. A thing becomes finite by being limited in time. Maya does not exist in space and cannot be limited by it. Maya cannot be limited in space, because space is itself the creation of Maya. Space, with all that it contains, is an illusion and is dependent upon Maya. Maya, however, is in no way dependent upon space. Hence Maya cannot be finite through any limitations of space.|`|AA11114869	HOLY SH!T!!!<br>  I don't fvckin' believe it, man!!!...<br>  STOP THE PRESSES!!!<br>  You've finally done it!!!...<br>  ...EUREKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  Of all of the hypothetical and theoretical proposals in the history of the subject of metaphysics --- it is you,...<br>  ...'Dee',...<br>  ... who will forever be remembered as the Y!A genius who, in an apparently exhaustive effort, - managed to put an end to thousands of years of countless metaphysical debates by posting  A MERE 2 SENTENCES!!!<br>  <br>  Given your profound philosophical proof it seems that I, as well as this answer, must now vanish in a puff of sophomoric logic.<br>  <br>  ---...

The first book in the series is 'A Game of thrones'. Each book is huge and some are split into several volumes.<br>  More frivolous and less X rated is Terry Pratchett: I wouldn't bother starting at the beginning of the Discword series though (you can always go back to it); rather I would start at around 'Moving Pictures' or, alternatively, just try the 'Wee Free Men' scion.<br>  Best wishes!!!

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	What IS hatred? Most dictionaries define it as a strong feeling of dislike. But put that way, is it really bad?<br>  <br>  Is there something wrong with disliking something? Or even with disliking it to an extreme degree? I think if you had good reason for that dislike, nobody would argue with it. A person allergic to peanuts probably SHOULD hate them - a slight exposure might be lethal!<br>  <br>  If hate is not intrinsically bad, then there must be some other underlying problem that people are mis-identifying with they express a profound dislike (hate?) of hate.<br>  <br>  I suspect this to be the opposite of the above situation: an IRRATIONAL hate. One that cannot be argued against with evidence nor, perhaps, checked by social norms. Xenophobia, prejudice, stereotyping... THESE are the kinds of hate that people dislike and want to eradicate. And they are frustrated because, being irrational, there aren't too many ways to do it.<br>  <br>  To make matters worse, some hate is probably instinctive. And not only that, but adaptive. It is natural to favour your own tribe over other tribes - a tribe of people that favoured others over themselves would probably be leeched of resources and eventually eliminated. So a certain amount of social self-interest is GOOD until these benefits are swamped out by other drawbacks.<br>  <br>  Studies show that there are ways to overcome these obstacles... some of them are even rather easy. For one, just re-define the groups. Create a different 'them' and you have a different 'us' (you'll note many countries do this intentionally during times of war to create nationalistic support). Confront bad ideas with good ones and sometimes the former goes away.<br>  <br>  None of these will entirely eliminate hate. Nor, as I argue above, should they. The trick is just to distinguish between that which serves us and that which does not. To use our feelings instead of be used by them. Peace.|`|pehaGih3aa	The trick is to embrace everything, hate nothing.  Does not require you to like and or love everything, just embrace it all, acknowledge, for example what a negative energy sapping emotion is, then let that thought/feeling go and embrace those that do not have the mental capacity and the compassion to understand this answer!|`|IX4i2tjcaa	how can you hate hate? if you mean hate people that hate then you would say you hate their ideals or behavior. i don't think there is a paradox here i think you missunderstood something or have a little idea of the whole concept. you can't hate things that don't make actions you hate things that are alive. man hating his clock that wakes him up every morning, doesn't mean he hates his clock it means he hates something about his daily routines from work to family or something.|`|yOK32PM9aa	You can have hatred for hate itself, and, unlike a "war to end all wars" you can still keep your credentials as a pacifist.  But my view is that hatred is just hard to bear; and that one form of it feels just as bad as another.  So you might as well learn to give up all types, not just the types that "other people" indulge in.  For me, the trick is to have compassion for yourself, the bit of you that is hating and hurting.  Slowly and calmly reflect on it: does it make me feel better?  What will it lead to? Is it useful?  Is there a way I can extend good will to all involved in a situation, including myself?  f you treat others with love, they become much easier to deal with.  The same - exactly - applies to bits of ourselves.|`|AA11828439	Haters are losers. It is a wasted emotion.

In fact President Harding served liquor at parties at the White House.<br>  <br>  Prohibition led to a huge spike in organized crime, which in turn led to the corruption of police departments across the country.  The FBI as we know it basically came into being because local and state law enforcement agencies were so corrupted by gang money, not just for booze but for prostitution, numbers rackets, drugs, etc.  Channels were found for smuggling liquor, and that made all kinds of smuggling easier. <br>  <br>  Strangely, statistics show people drank MORE during prohibition than before.<br>  <br>  People point to the parallels between prohibition of alcohol in the 20s and prohibition of marijuana today, and feel pot should be legalized for the same reasons.|`|isnHOG0Waa	The mofia happened.

DPgktezcaa	Have you thought of drawing realistically? Take a picture of yourself and try and draw it but use an array of tones. It might change your drawing techniques slightly because you need to add more to the picture than, say, a cartoon like sketch. <br>  <br>  Back to the main question and direct answer, you need to remember to have three different tones in a good drawing (with exceptions of course). they consist of:<br>  <br>  Black<br>  White<br>  And a good range of grey - this will take up the bulk of the drawings<br>  <br>  I think my favourite of your drawings would be the "Cross". Not only do you use a good array of white and grey, but you implement the reflectons that would occure if under such lighting - this gives realism. However, the picture is missing black, an important aspect sinse it really makes the picture stand out from the white. One other problem is it's hard to tell exactly where the light source is coming from. <br>  <br>  Perhaps when you next draw, look at something like a book or ball - focus on where the light comes from, see the colours and how they range from white to shadow. A helpful thing would be to take a picture of that ball then print it out in black and white - this will help you better understand the three main tones.<br>  <br>  Like most peoplebelieve, drawing isn't all about lines but rather different tones, conveying from colour to colour and shade to shade. <br>  <br>  Anyway, hope I helped and good luck with you art =)|`|AA12339318	It is very clear that you draw from memory rather than from real life models.  The best way of improving your drawing skills is in hours of practice from real life, or, at least, from photos.<br>  <br>  You'll never be able to draw believable images, even fantasy and cartoon images, until you train your hand and eye at capturing real life images.  Draw family, friends, furniture.  Draw your pets, your car, your house.  Make sketches of your bedroom, your backyard, your stack of homework.  Draw trees, clouds, boats, benches, zoo animals and anything else you see.  The more you practice, the better you'll become.  This truism is no different for singers, dancers, runners and stunt pilots.  They practice the skills they want to improve.  If you goal is to make amazing but believeable images, then you start from real live, and THEN let your imagination take your from there.|`|AejJW0Moaa	your Manson pictures are very good, and from my point of view i think you should add more value to the pictures.

AA11114869	"If everything is abnormal then everything is considered normal", - is a simple argument which proposes that a state of normality cannot exist without something to contrast and compare it to, - and similar arguments of that type have been used to qualify just about any polarized subjects; right and wrong, good and evil, light and dark, etc...<br>  <br>  In this, your "knowing everything is knowing nothing" query is more of a quantitative one than a qualitative one and, as such, neither affirms or contradicts the 'Normal, Abnormal' argument; they just simply do not relate.<br>  -|`|UW6mrUOSaa	It's a borderline paradox. If everything were abnormal, then abnormality would be the norm, and thus everything would be normal in one sense. But, if you were to ascribe a certain set of characteristics to "normalcy" and label everyone as having abnormal characteristics, then they would simply be normal in one sense and abnormal in another--the two don't conflict. The second question relates to the "normal, abnormal" argument in an abstract way. Think of everything and nothing as separate concepts, each having nothing to do with the other. Then, if you know everything, you don't necessarily have to know nothing, unless you consider nothing to lie within the set of everything. If you think of nothing as a concept one would inevitably understand if he/she were to know everything, the answer to the question would be yes, and again wouldn't necessarily make it a paradox.|`|HSIi8qOWaa	They are two separate ideas. The better way to look at the "normal, abnormal" speech is to say this: because everything in the world is abnormal in some way, then abnormality must be normal". In other words, society prescribes social norms for people to follow, which television and the media play a huge role in. When we watch tv, or read a magazine we are learning how society wants us to behave. However, no matter how hard anyone and everyone tries to be "normal", there are still huge qualities within them that society would consider "abnormal". But that's only one example of many, but I feel that this is the most relatable. <br>  <br>  When you mention the philosophy  about "If you know Everything does that mean that you know Nothing", I feel that you misinterpreted the philosophy. This has to do with Socrates saying that a true wise man (or woman, hehe) knows that they know nothing. <br>  <br>  By the way, just because you can't know everything doesn't mean you can't stop learning! I'm like you, and I'm happiest when I'm learning something new about life. Keep it up, the world needs more people who want to learn, and aren't afraid to ask the questions that are worthwhile.|`|fvPoiaAXaa	okay i have no clue what to answer for the first question. but you never learn anything in life, teachers never teach you anything, youre only reminded about things you already know. <br>  <br>  think about that now.<br>  lol|`|IX4i2tjcaa	abnormal or normal there are just points of views. just because you can see the sun and some other guy is able to see the moon doesn't mean the world is abnormal or normal it simply means those two guys are living in different places. is everything abnormal? no, because we can't live in a place we consider to be chaotic or unbalanced only nightmares are abnormal. the world we live in is normal because we shape it to be so, if its war or peace time that's the result of people's choices. the world is normal because its real, something that's not real is abnormal.|`|gaHc6UONaa	okay to the abnormal normal thing "normal" is just what you see the most or what happens the most abnormal things are rare things not bad or good.<br>  and if you know everything you know everything it's that simple <br>  maybe not "one"(a person) can know everything but what about a different being or creature or thing<br>  and second it was theoretically speaking|`|Xcwm4gCNaa	WHAT??|`|AA11564934	those 2 concepts "everything" and "nothing" are meaningless. How can one know everything?  The location of every atom in the universe?<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it and enjoy life.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	You can't know everything, because everything is subject to change. Therefor, if you believe you know everything, then you know nothing.<br>  <br>  In a way, it does relate to the logic behind the Abnormal/normal argument, because it is an example of that evident change. Normality is a statistic, and it is subjective. It is the conduct by which the majority conforms. If one mode of conduct is deemed abnormal, and it is suddenly adopted by the majority, then that conduct is now regarded as normal.<br>  <br>  For example, the style in previous decades was to wear a hat. Every man wore a hat, it was regarded as normal. And by hat, I mean a hat of that era: a fedora, a bowler, a boater. Nowadays, none of these hats are seen as normal style, nor is the necessity of a hat regarded as normal. So, therefor, that which was normal has become abnormal, and that which was abnormal has become normal.

About 1500 calories a day, depending on your size and metabolic rate.  Doing anything, thinking well, and so on requires usually much more effort than that.  And then there's what economists call 'opportunity cost' - whenever you are doing one thing, that means you can't be doing something else.

5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	If your child is a model, they are working for an ad agency.  The ad agency is hired by clients, such as Target.  The agency will select several children from it's roster of models to the client along with their suggestions for the ad series the client requested.  The client will pick the faces they want from among those the agency preselects.<br>  Bottom line, there is very little way to arrange for your child individually to model for Target in particular, unless there is some compelling reason, such as your child has a strong personal relationship with Target's national art director, or he or she is the CEO's grandchild.<br>  If your child has a pleasant, easy going temperment, is eager to please, is patient, fits standard sized clothes, and is telegentic, then it might be possible to get an ad agency to take them on as a model. <br>  Take some good quality color photos (4 x 6, or 5 x 7 sizes are fine,) in a variety of poses, in different types of clothes and hair styles.  Take a few in full length and several close-ups.  Outdoor, natural light is best, but they may be against a plain backdrop or a simple background.  (Try not to use indoor shots with a flash.  Be sure to correct any red-eye problems. Remember that you want an engaging face to be the focal point of the photo and to have as few distractions as possible.  Home photos are fine to start, if the agency is interested, they can direct you to a professional photographer for better head shots.)  Mark the back of the photos with your child's full name, DOB, and your contact information and submit them to a legitimate modeling agency.  (These will only be in large cities, so if you don't live in or near one now, that means travel at the drop of a hat.)  <br>  Be sure to keep a set of copies yourself and don't expect the photos you send to be returned unless you ask specifically and include a stamped, pre-addressed return envelop.<br>  It's a business, and it's a disciplined business.  Be prepared for rejection and make sure your child understands that the rejection has nothing to do with them.  If the agency does take them, you might get one job and passed over for the next 15, for no other reason, than they just are the size, gender, hair color kid that the art director had in mind.<br>  At this point in time, kids with an Hispanic, Asian, or slightly exotic look will have an advantage as will mixed race children.  This is a time, when ads are trying to better reflect the diversity of the population.<br>  That said, red headed kids, kids with freckles or those missing their two front teeth will always be appealing.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	Companies like Target NEVER hire models and actors directly; they contract the work to an advertising agency, which goes to talent and modeling agencies for the models.<br>  <br>  If you're interested specifically in Target, keep in mind that, in general, children's modeling is exceptionally difficult to break into, because of the intense competition. ("My daughter is so beautiful that she ought to be a model." Parents' feeding this line over and over to their children not only believe it themselves, but in time, their children buy into it, sometimes to the extent that it skews their self-image.) For Target specifically, a call to their PR department would be a logical first step.<br>  <br>  A bigger, and more significant, question to ask is, "For whom am I doing this, my child or me?" Is your child the one seeking to get into modeling, or are you attempting to live through your child? When parents do the latter, it harms the child psychologically in the long run. If it's your child's dream, then personally, I respect that, having realized my own dream in a different industry altogether some years ago.<br>  <br>  Either way, the key is to start doing your homework. Nothing may come of it, or you may find your child modeling for various chains.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your efforts.|`|AA10547800	What ever you do stay clear of places like Barbazon, an others they just rip you off, my ex fell for it hook line and sinker, spent a fortune on my daughter and then at the end there's this great trip to LA, what a waist of $5.000, for one week. my daughter was so sick of it she didn't want to model after it, make sure it's something your daughter wants to do.|`|LVpyaf48aa	newmodels.com has a section on child modeling truths and requirements. <br>  <br>  you will probably feel like you were slapped in the fae after reading it but wouldnt you like the truth up front instead of after you put thousands of dollars ahd hundreds of hours into making your kid a model?|`|i5OVORXgaa	Contact a modeling agency... where are you from?

However, the military did not consider surrendering under such terms, partially even after US military forces dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, and the Soviet Union entered the war against Japan on August 8. <br>  <br>  On August 14, however, Emperor Showa finally decided to surrender unconditionally|`|7uGMyGn2aa	This poster suggests so:<br>  <a href="http://opal.kent.ac.uk/cartoonx-cgi/ccc.py?mode=summary&search=Vicky+find+out+if+it+worked" rel="nofollow">http://opal.kent.ac.uk/cartoonx-cgi/ccc....</a><br>  <br>  However i struggle to believe it. Like someone has already said - Japan was preparing for an invasion. And to the allies (in particular the americans) the atom bomb seemed the only option considering the number of casualties sustained when battling for the pacific islands - a perfect example being Tarawa when 1,000 americans were killed and over 2000 injured fighting for the island which is absaloutly tiny .(no more than a couple of hundred yards wide in places) And considering the americans were attacking the island with 17 aircraft carriers, 12 battleships, 8 heavy and 4 light cruisers, 66 destroyers, and 36 transports, its no wonder they were so worried about an attack on Japan! At the time it was estimated that an invasion on Japan could result in about 1million americans and allies killed. <br>  So although terrible, and morally wrong, the bomb was their only really effective weapon in knocking out japan and saving millions of lives. PLUS its not like japan wudnt have done it if they had had the chance. they were one of the cruelist nations during the war.|`|RLQPWkXCaa	Shoot.

5ulr9xLQaa	This is a great question.  First, Rome was just a small village with an army and a dream to conquer the world.  As their armies gained more land they got more people.  Most of the people were poor and had to pay taxes.  About 400 years into the Roman empire the armies were spread thin all over the world and subjects of the Empire started moving to the cities.  Rome had a welfare system and those who lived in the cities were the beneficiaries of the system.  Towards the end of the Roman Empire there were several roving hordes of barbarians that would sack the cities eventually ending in 410 AD when the Visigoths sacked Rome.<br>  <br>  As you can tell this parallels the growth and dominance of the United States.  Initially the US was just a few colonies with some wealthy and some poor trying to survive.  As more people arrived from Europe there was s move to the West.  By the time the country was 100 years old the US stretched from east to west on North America and the population continued to grow.  Both Rome and The US had slaves at one point in their histories.  As the US grew the large cities developed and grew.  People moved from the country to the cities and more people emigrated, just like in Rome.  There was a welfare system that was set up in the US just like in Rome.  Furthermore, just like Rome there are factions that are starting to attack the US from both within and from outside of the country.<br>  <br>  I am not saying that the US will meet the same type of end that the Roman Empire did, however, we need to look at history and determine if the current course that we are on is the wisest.|`|OvYNWnQ0aa	The Roman Empire was the main world superpower, and had basically their pick of the litter in international markets and controlled all foreign politics by way of all other nations being scared to get on Rome's bad side. <br>  They did what ever they wanted with the nations that they dominated or conquered outright, and the world had to pledge it's allegiance to Rome or Rome would make a great example of them and bring them doom.<br>  <br>  Obviously this is identical to the USA's current world situation<br>  <br>  That's the darker side of things, on the lighter side:<br>  <br>  The empire held strong for a very long time because Rome always made sure to impose their flavor of democracy and capitalism on all the nations they conquered, and they made all of the subjects citizens of Rome. Once you were taken over by Rome, you (in theory) became a Roman with all the perks and benefits of being a Roman, you could travel and trade freely as such,<br>  where most other empires made slaves and exploited the nations they conquered. This made people less resistant to Rome, and US by comparison allows equal citizenship to all those who are citizens, there are no slaves (again, in theory).<br>  <br>  Rome projected itself globally as an icon of enlightenment in a world of primitive darknesses, the highest level of society to which others will assimilate, and the USA most certainly does the same thing and in almost the same exact way<br>  <br>  <br>  The conclusion:<br>  <br>  Rome was great but grew too big for its britches, and severe corruption and political engineering began to take place, conflicts were engineered, and the ruling classes began to weild all the power and wealth of the great empire to chase after their individual lusts and vanities and ahwaa<br>  <br>  The USA has begun to show distinct signs of the same exact pattern emerging, and so many people tend to suggest that the USA, will, as rome did, fall into a great civil war and collapse upon itself, and the glory thereof will burn out and die as Nero did|`|RuOTJLyvaa	ancient rome?
