I’m sure that I will always be   A lonely number like root three      The three is all that’s good and right,   Why must my three keep out of sight   Beneath the vicious square root sign,   I wish instead I were a nine      For nine could thwart this evil trick,   with just some quick arithmetic      I know I’ll never see the sun, as 1.7321   Such is my reality, a sad irrationality      When hark! What is this I see,   Another square root of a three      As quietly co-waltzing by,   Together now we multiply   To form a number we prefer,   Rejoicing as an integer      We break free from our mortal bonds   With the wave of magic wands      Our square root signs become unglued   Your love for me has been renewed      Is the rhyme scheme aabb, ccdd, ee, fg, hh, iijj, kk      I've never done a rhyme scheme before lol so i have no idea what im doing...      i also don't know what to classify this poem as.. a sonnet?

I've been acting semi-professionally for the past 15 years in Boston but never got my "big break".  I know I have the talent, but I don't have an agent and casting calls are always for minor roles...big parts are almost always by invitation it seems.  Now I've moved out of Boston for my family and I'm living in central Ohio.  I thought there might be less competition in Ohio but I can't get *any* information about auditions at all.  There is tons of theater in Columbus but I can't seem to break in.  Does anyone have any advice on how to get noticed in the theater world?

20090309182437AAzQrXl	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Will this "One World Currnecy" End us?	Does this idea sound crazy, or what?   I was recently on a Luke 18 retreat. We began to discuss one world currency. My friend seems to think it could lead to the end of the world. His theory is so close to true, that it is kind of scary. Take a listen.      (First, I am a Catholic. Most of this theory deals with the Holy Bible. Please do not religious flame here. I respect your different religions, please respect mine.)      The Bible speaks of the beast (satan, the anti-Christ) at the end of the world. It says that those who accept the mark of the beast will be doomed to hell, but those who do not accept the mark will be cast out from society. I know what you're thinking...what does this have to do with one world currency? Well, one world currency could be used through a marking system, possibly a printed bar code or tattoo that will be printed on the body to be scanned and used as your money system. This could be the sign of the beast. And like the Bible says, those who do not accpet this sign will be marked out of society. (meaning if you do not take it, you will not be able to buy things.) After this one world currency and new world order is developed, the Christ will return in a blaze of glory and will fight of satan. He (Jesus) will find those with the mark and damn them. He will find those without, and bring them up with him.      This theory is very scarry because it is very possible that it could become a reality. This is strictly my friend's theory, not mine. sure, OWC (one world currency) may not be used by marking of the body) but it is possible. What do you think about this? Will OWC end us?      (This is my friends theory, again. please do not think I'm crazy....blame him!)      As a final question, do you think OWC will hapen? Please give an opinion about both the theory and if OWC will even take affect.      For the last time, PLEASE don't call me crazy...this is my friend's idea and opinion... i just want to see what other think.

So which evil prick do you find yourself loving? What about them makes your eye twitch in annoyance, yet you crave for more scenes with them?      He isn't a classic, but I just adore Draco from Harry Potter. He is such a little prick. The ultimate annoying bully you just want to punch into oblivion.

I've just been using myheritage.com, but I'd kind of like to get a program so I can have a copy of the information on my computer, and not just online.      I've downloaded a couple trials, but I just can't seem to 'click' with them.... maybe it's just me, I don't know. But I really like the interface that the myheritage.com website has. I've entered over 80 people, and I'm just really comfortable with it, it's simple yet holds alot of information. Mostly I like how it shows so many generations on the "main" viewing page, and when you click on a person the information on them comes up on the side, still leaving the family tree showing.       Anyone have any recommendations? I'm pretty new to this, so please forgive me if any of this sounds stupid. :)

In the light of the quotation below from Aristotle regarding moral value of resentment and indignation in the face of our own mistreatment. Do the teachings of Jesus preclude resentment and indignation?         "...people who are not angered by the right things, or in the right way, or at the right times, or towards the right people, all seem to be foolish...Since he is not angered, he does not seem to be the sort to defend himself; and such willingness to accept insults to oneself or to overlook insults to one's family and friends is slavish."

20090309195858AAhC8aD	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	I haven't seen her in awhile, but we still stay in touch.      She makes me happy, and I cant thank her enough.      As her happiness begins to fade, I can help but want to help.      Why can't I help?      Why are my prayers not working for her?      Why her?      why not me? surley I would trade places if possible.      Because as she begins to break I do too.      I feel her pain, and she feels mine.      We have been like this forever.      and swore to never change,      As her luck begins to shift, I am overwlemed with joy.      Finally my friend will be happy, but to be mistaken was what I was.      She must move again, for her mother health.      She said they are not good in weath there anyway.      I cant belive whats happening.      Why are these prayers not working?      Why cant I help her like she does for me?      Why her?      Oh god please make it be me!      I would do anything for her, everything.      Why cant I, I would sacrafice everything, even myself.      But the problem of that is a secret hidden under blankets of insanity.      We made a promise, a oath, a swear.      If one is to die, than the other is to follow soon after, because heaven would not even be close to our friendship.      Insanity? yes      Foolish? Indeed.      true? Anyday, anytime. Every hour of every breath I take. This will be true.      So if to find a friendship so strong, and a person so great.      why her?

Lost into each others eyes,with hands so closely held,   Cozy smiles on our faces,we lay on the flower bed!   The dewdrops falling over,sound like the church bell,   Then your eyes open wide,seeing the lovely sea shell!   Wondering what is inside,your hands are shaking,   Tears cloud in our eyes,our hearts start racing!   As we shake the seashell,pops-out a beautiful ring,   Twinkling and sparkling,our hearts begin to sing!   I slide it onto your finger,and it fits you perfectly,   No words are being said,as we are kissing gently!   Even if it is just a dream,Love is all I wish for you,   Standing by you I wish,your dreams do come true!

In a number of instances, (such as the Tea Act of 1773 and the change in 1772 so that payment of governors' salaries came from the king and not provincial legislature)  the impetus for these acts was not wholly the attempt to impose despotic government by the king. Explain how these acts could be seen from a British point of view as ethical and legitimate and not as attempts to oppress the colonists.      Thanks.

20090309194200AAIJEhB	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writer's block dillema! My fictional characters need help! Escape plans!!?	I'm currently working on this online story in an internet publishing site.   I got 3 chapters in, and decided to give up as nobody was reading or reviewing it.      In three chapters, my character was introduced as a notorious criminal. Right when the police got her, she siezed and was taken to the hospital. She woke up in a hospital room, certain she was somebody else, with two close and concerned friends. The moment she recovers, the police outside were directed to take her directly to 'the law.'    She must find a way out, and her friends are totally up for any way they can help. Once again, she is suffering identity crisis.      Wouldn't you guess that immediately after I decided to give up, I got flooded with reviews from people who couldn't wait to find out what will happen to her, how she gets out.      I feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew. Any decent, believable ideas for escape routes?

I do realize that England was under a mutual assistance treaty to protect Poland, but Poland seems awfully far from England and I guess I don't understand what the connection was between Poland and England that necessitated this treaty to begin with?  As a sideline, from what I understand, Czechoslovakia never quite forgave England for not coming to its assistance when it was overrun by the Germans, and that was six months before Germany invaded Poland.

20090309192030AAkTPrU	Arts & Humanities;History	Cultural and Intellectual Trends help !?	6.   How did Benito Mussolini gain the support of the Catholic Church?    He threatened to execute the pope, his bishops, and cardinals.   He gave the Church money and official recognition.   He expanded Vatican City's land greatly by giving it control over half of Rome.   He assigned squadristi to be "food tasters" for the pope.      7.   A factor in leading many Germans to accept Hitler and the Nazis was    Hitler's abolition of the Reichstag.   the regime's temporary suspension of all crime for four years.   the Catholic Church's support of the new regime.   the belief that Hitler had ended Germany's economic depression       8.   What were the "Nuremberg laws"?   They excluded Jews from German citizenship and forbade marriages between Jews and Germans.   They banned books, magazines, and newspapers not strictly approved by the Nazi government.   They outlawed all religion in Germany, making Hitler's regime a completely secular state.   They imposed high fines for citizens having loud, boisterous parties in their homes.      9.   Dadaists were artists who    were ordered by Hitler to create pro-Nazi, pro-Germany works of public art.   tried to express in their art their revulsion for what they saw as the insanity of life.   separated everyday objects from their normal contexts.   thought modern art was degenerate.      10.   The Triumph of the Will was     a Nazi documentary film that forcefully conveyed the power of National Socialism.   a surrealist painting by Salvador Dali.   a novel by Hermann Hesse that showed the psychological confusion of men.   a dadaist photomontage by Marilyn Monroe that commented on women's roles.

20090309203014AAibHjU	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	Poems, Actually. The two were written To go with each other. I want your interpretation of them. What do they mean to you?   This was the first written.   The Tale of the Blue King"      The man wore bags under his eyes like a proud flag,   And he loved everything blue.   The world, it's sky; it's mid ocean tide, and even you.   He was king and he saw one thing,   Your deep, deep blue heart.   He wanted what he couldn't have, and took terror instead,   Because everyone knows fear is blue.   He reigned with fear and thought you'd come here to sacrifice your blue, blue heart.   But when you came and showed instead that your heart was in fact red,   He was angered but remained calm and blue.   So greedily, he decided if he couldn't have you,   He'd paint a smile on his face, and make everything blue.   As he burned the towns down and you asked him stop,   He took your heart and burned it too,   And then he most arrogantly said "Let it burn til its blue."   This is the tale of the blue king who took what wasn't his,   And the last thing he said before he died was 'I pass my blue reign to you.'      This is the second I wrote.   "The Tale Of The Blue Queen"    The world had ended, abruptly,   He was done with the world,   Throwing it away like crumpled paper.   She was left to carry on a blue reign,   With a burnt blue heart, she had nothing else,   A tyrant was born.   Foreseen by the king himself,   And her pain   would reflect   Upon the faces of the inhumane crowd.   Anger on the Innocent,   Hate upon the bowing few.   But let us worship this blue woman,   For we all know,   We are no better than her.

20090309193037AAUDj2o	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you like my poetry?	I am a thirteen-year-old girl with a passion for writing. I've always written short stories and fanfiction, but lately I decided to step into uncharted territory and try my hand at poetry. Nobody will give me any feedback except my mom (and I value her opinions) but I'd like some more feedback. Here are a few that I've written. What do you think?         ___A Counterfeit Smile___       Eyelids flutter open   From the lips escapes a yawn   The last wisps of Dreamland drift away   With the arrival of the dawn.        Her foggy mind still in a haze   Her legs as heavy as lead   She tried to remember exactly why   She bothers to get out of bed.       Golden locks are smoothed into place   Stiletto heels kiss the ground   Over her lips she pastes the counterfeit smile   That her life revolves around.       This young lady is fooling us all   With her giggles and grins of deception.   The whole world is allowed to feel sorrow and rage   However, she is the only exception.       She glides through the hallway with painstaking ease   Her optimism seemingly endless.    Despite all her beauty and riches and success   In reality she’s utterly friendless.       Oh sure she has legions of admirers   But their grins are as fake as her own.   She scorns them all, for they’ll never know   What it’s like to be truly alone.       Her status is higher than Everest   Most say she’s a work of art.   And even though she knows this   A storm cloud lurks in her heart.       Whispers of admiration stick close to her heels   Though in her sadness, she threatens to drown.   But she’s built this fa?ade up for far too long   To let it come crumbling down.       So she flounces her way through her daily life   Not unlike all the previous years.   Everyone she knows is completely unaware   That she lives on the verge of tears.       So the next time you envy this “perky” little blonde   Here’s a secret you may find worthwhile:   Her life may seem the pinnacle of bliss   But she wears a counterfeit smile.         ___Why I live___      I get out of bed      For those who’ll never get a chance to wake      I hope      For those who persevere and forever refuse to break.      I sing      For those who’ll never get to raise their voice in song      I pray      For those engulfed in war who just can’t get along.      I listen       For those whose voices are too little to be heard      I speak      For those who’ll never get to utter another word.      I step up       For those who just need somebody to lead      I learn      For those who’ll never get a chance to learn to read.      I laugh       For those who don’t know what it means to be lighthearted      I take the leap      For those who have no one to get them started.      I stay true      For those who don’t know just quite who they are      I wish      For those who’ve lost their faith in each and every star.      I believe      For those whose will has long since been expired      I write       For those all over the world who need to be inspired.      ___Opportunities___      Chance of a lifetime   Bolt out of nowhere   Open Door.   Revel, Cherish   Value, treasure   Propitious good fortune.   Unbelieving   Inexplicable   Incredulous coincidence.       Cautious, guarded   Wary, careful   Whatever shall be choosen?   Ponder, musing   Meditation, reflection   Difficult to deem.   First one hand   Then the other   Which palm is outstretched?   Safe way out   Sheltered harbor   Or the road less traveled by?       Opportunity knocking   Screaming, shouting   Too absorbed to hear.   Contemplating choices   That need not be made   Time hungrily ruining chances.   The verdict is reached   Your decision final   You reach out to seize the day   But by now, to much sorrow    It pains you to find   It has migrated out of your grasp.   Empty feeling.          Slips out of fingers   Tired of waiting   Whispers a bitter farewell   Tumbling, hurtling   Shrinking, parting   Too fast to hear your regrets   Plummeting, falling   Sinking, plunging   Down, down   Gone.

I must be stupid,   I must be bad,   What else could have made,   My daddy so mad?   I wish I were better,   I wish I weren't ugly,   Then maybe my mommy,   Would still want to hug me.   I can't do a wrong,   I can't speak at all,   Or else I'm locked up,   All day long.   When I'm awake,   I'm all alone,   The house is dark,   My folks aren't home.   When my mommy does come home,   I'll try and be nice,   So maybe I'll just get,   One whipping tonight.   I just heard a car,   My daddy is back,   From Charlie's bar   I hear him curse,   My name is called,   I press myself,   Against the wall.   I try to hide,   From his evil eyes,   I'm so afraid now,   I'm starting to cry.   He finds me weeping,   Calls me ugly words,   He says its my fault,   He suffers at work.      He slaps and hits me,   And yells at me more,   I finally get free,   And run to the door.   He's already locked it,   And I start to bawl,   He takes me and throws me,   Against the hard wall.   I fall to the floor,   With my bones nearly broken,   And my daddy continues,   With more bad words spoken.   'I'm sorry!', I scream,   But it's now much too late,   His face has been twisted,   Into a unimaginable shape.   The hurt and the pain,   Again and again,   O please God, have mercy!   O please let it end!   And he finally stops,   And heads for the door,   While I lay there motionless,   Sprawled on the floor.   My name is Chris,   I am three,   Tonight my daddy,   Murdered me.

When you went to school, wasnt there something motivating you? I dont know why I am so happy when I see her. I am a girl by the way, so I kind of see her as a role model as well. Why do I feel sad then when she isnt at school one day. I want to get to know her better but dont know how, I think she is very inspiring to the school, and myself. What is your advice on how to handle this whole thing? Its the kind of feeling you have when you see your favorite movie star of all time, you get all excited and happy but dont know what to do with yourself!
20090309202333AATB45g	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please critique my poem?	I'm so used to the tears, I can't even remember what it's like looking through clear eyes.   It's been so long since I've heard the truth, that now I've mistaken it with lies.   I've been overlooked so many times, that I find comfort in second place.   I'm so used to being blew off, that I'm used to being replaced.   And you can't understand why I'm angry, you say I just assume.   Thankfully through this pain, I've learned to grow immune.   The tears fall for hours, but my cheeks are all that's wet.   I always make myself push through, cuz "I'm not done yet".   It's like I'm so used to pushing, that I carry all the weight.   I refuse to let us fall when so much is at stake.   It's like I never get tired, I never take a break.   But as everyone knows, there's only so much I can take.   Could this really be the time, could I really be done?   I mean, to all this pain, I've just grown numb.   But the tears fall faster, and they just don't stain my shirt.   They're making me grow weaker, and making me get hurt.

He leido creo que 4 de ellos, ademas leo de mas autores y otras novelas que no son moralistas y de "vida real" con esas. He notado la verdad que las obras del Sr. Sanchez nunca me satisfacen y las encuentro verdaderamente lamentables, pero no se identificar exactamente que es lo que lo diferencia de una buena novela como Cien A?os de Soledad.      Parece ser tambien que quienes empiezan en la lectura siempre comienzan con este tipo de libros y se los recomiendan unos a los otros como buenas y educativas obras.      Pero, entonces exactamente que considerarias tu de los libros de Carlos Sanchez como bazofia o por que la mayoria de los lectores conocedores lo marcan como libros de muy baja categoria ?

20080219085253AAH78v9	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Harry Potter wand ownership?	okay, so we all know about how the elder wand was transferred (sort of) and we all know that a main theme in book seven was about the how a wand not belonging to a wizard won't work as well for him. so obviously the ownership rules apply to all wands and not just the elder wand. if all this is true, then who owns who's wand? the members of the DA disarmed each other numerous times. and what spells "defeat" a wizard? obviously expelliarmus and avada kedavra, but what about stupefy? the jelly-legs jinx? transfiguration? what about hitting someone with an ax? does that defeat them? do they have to let go of their wand to be defeated? because in that case, crouch jr. defeated harry so the holly-and-pheonix wand shouldn't have worked as well for him after book 4. but it still did.   any ideas?

I don't know how I got it but I did, and I am having a hard time hitting the really high notes. For "My White Knight" and "Till There Was You", I cannot even touch the high notes. Do you have any idea how I could hit those? Another thing, I had a bad cough last Thursday, do you think it's okay that I started to sing again? Could this be why I can't hit the high notes as well as I want to? Is there any way I can get myself to hit those notes, and still make it sound good? PLEASE HELP!

20081012232302AAHqcLE	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please read my poem? thanks!?	it is about twilight      a parallel divide,   a crime against the books.   it's right and it's wrong,   i'm hot and you're cold.   we're proof of attraction,   separate walks of life.   your touch against my skin,   so firm yet gentle.   the gold in your eyes,   burn sparks of desire.   oh, how you ache,   and how you fear.   the struggles you choose to battle,   to keep my heart & cheeks in tact.   you've got so much more to give,   and it fills me with such anguish.   let me quench your thirst,   i swear we'll hurt less.   let me be your equal,   and i'll remain breathless.   no more beauty sleep,   for i shall be exquisite.   let me be strong,   to withhold your love.   don't give time the chance,   of taking me away.   feed what you crave,   here i stand before you.   taste the life inside of me,   and forever i am yours.
