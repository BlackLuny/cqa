You may not realise it yet but i believe 18-22 sorta party years depending on the persons ....
Zq3fkJmEaa	forcing someone to have sex is rape and i think you need to speak to your teacher or social worker or someone about what happened. it isn't easy to admit that you've been sexuaaly assaulted in any way, but i feel that you shouldn't be dealing with this alone. you don't mention your age or your boyfriends age but you seem pretty young and if you are underage you need the protection of the law from any man who would do anything like this.

They are giving you a heard time because they are envious. But, if you are only 13 you need to take things slower than that. Watch yourself, no need to rush into anything. In the future, maybe your girlfriend shouldn't come around practice for awhile, because practice is for the team. They are giving you and her a hard time because they can.|`|EXs2tiiwaa	Thirteen is really young. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry if I sound like a parent or counceler or something likewise, but yes, 13 is really early to start a sex life. Mainly because a thirteen year older can't put in dimension all the risks of having sex at such an early time. You obviously can't undone what has already been done. Boys at school around your age are mostly chumps, man. I mean seriously, I wouldn't expect much maturity from someone at that age, so violence is anyway, out of question. Don't get expelled because of their opinions. <br>  <br>  If you are keen on a sexual active life, please think about it. You and your girlfriend are way too young to enjoy stuff like that. Enjoy your life as what you are... pre-adolescents. Now, there's not much you can do for your girlfriend in order to stop your mates from pestering her. Is you can somehow state clearly that you are aware of what you're doing, then do it.<br>  <br>  Don't use violence. Enjoy your life. Don't hurry into sex, man. I was a virgin until I turned 21, and I don't think it was lame or bad. I just knew I would start seeing life accordingly, and made wise decisions over my sex and love life.<br>  <br>  Be good.
AA10887916	I can hardly believe this level fo behaviour is being referred to as being in a 'workplace' and not in a 'classroom'.  Goodness sake gain some maturity.|`|VMY7No0eaa	She's giving you a dose of what you gave her... (being standoffish) but you are taking the bate...<br>  continue to ignore her... and eventually she will "get it"  <br>  KEEP EVERYTHING BUSINESSLIKE ... <br>  and forget what she is doing.|`|1TSMdgG1aa	Dude you're married!  You need to get it together or you'll be in a world of trouble.  And I'm not just talking about your wife. <br>  <br>  If management finds out about all this flirting and playing around stuff you both can be in trouble.  Or worse, she could say you're harassing her.  Do you want to risk it?  Work is work, and you need to keep it professional at all times.  Just let this immature stuff go, and focus on your job.
IhmT5ja0aa	this happens to me all of the time.  people laugh at me for it, but i can't help it.  i'm not sure why it happens, but i don't think it's something you can change easily if you're always laughing so hard. <br>  <br>  :D|`|RBF7b58vaa	ha its normal.<br>  i only get it if i laugh like super hard though.

Now that I think of it, is it bedtime yet?|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Yes they are. I would not want to date someone with stretch marks. If I am with someone and they eventually get stretch marks, it's not so big of a deal. But initially it is a turn off.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	No, anyone who thinks they are a turn off is shallow and doesn't really care for you.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	no way! are bald guys? no they get women all the time, and beautiful at that so no its not a turn off!|`|gB1dXEHCaa	yes.  it's horrible to look at...i guess if the lights are off it might not be too horrible|`|PZStgtdKaa	If they are for someone else come on over and I will look.|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	yes....|`|AuKKjaxaaa	They don't really bother me.

AA10874773	Why would you keep man a around your kids?  Divorce him and then move on with your life.  then you can worry about man B.  Your kids deserve to be raised in a happy, healthy home.  You can only give them that if you leave man a.  good luck honey!|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	You need to stop playing both sides of the fence and make a decision on what you are going to do.  If man A is that bad, then why are you still with him?|`|3f9f4fac33d8bbc864f0e254759d3d34aa	just because you have a history with someone-its no reason to stay with them. once man a and man b have gotten proper names, leave man a. you could come to some arrangement together with who sees the children when, but if your in a relationship with someone you can't trust no amount of love is going to solve it (that is-if you have any fellings left for him). then be honest with man b, but you really should'nt go any further with man b until your sorted your situation with man a. it just complicates things.

I'm 16 and me and my mum have so many arguments and silent periods where we just don't talk to one another etc.<br>  <br>  I think what your problem is that you have come to expect a certain attitude from your mum and when you are around her, you put on a front in which you act as hard as nails but inside you are actually hurting, whether you try to deny it to yourself or not.<br>  <br>  You are still really young, although I'm sure you don't want to admit that. You and your mum need a little time to rebond is all. Instead of snapping at each other, just look at the good points. Some people don't have a mum to 'hate'. They don't have anyone.<br>  <br>  You don't hate your mum, you love her and that is why you are so upset about your situation. Think about it - you are angry and upset about it now, but you would be devastated if she died or something.<br>  <br>  You need to remember that you are growing up and this is hard for a mum to watch because you are no longer her baby and she has no control over you anymore. She wants to keep you young and needs to accept that you are grown up now and need your own life.<br>  <br>  Cut her some slack - she gave birth and looked after you all these years. Spend some quality time with her - even if it's just talking to her. <br>  <br>  She might be going through a difficult time of her own and might not have chosen to tell you about it so you should go easy on her - she's still human and is allowed to have off days too.|`|QY9vjyBlaa	I didn't want to be around my mom when I found out that my mom's boyfriend had molested me when I was 2 y/o. She knew about it and did nothing about it and continued to see him and eventually marry him. During my childhood, I felt uncomfortable around him and had no idea why. In my mind, I was like how could a mother do this to her child. To me she wasn't being a mother, she didn't protect me. I still feel like this to this day. I promised myself I would not be like my mother. To answer your question, no I don't feel it is wrong not to be around your mother.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	You have a serious problem .Why does your mother hate you so much. That should be the question.. What does she have against you, that causes her to act this way that is what need to be look into.|`|qi88afqYaa	your young.. you will get over it.|`|twWQwax9aa	Maybe because you expect her to react badly to you, you are behaving in a negative way or pushing her away to protect yourself. Maybe she is just trying to get a reaction from you or she realises that you are growing up and that she is losing control. <br>  <br>  It might be a good idea to stay with your friend for a while to give you and your mum some time apart. Don't jump into anything permanent yet just let her know that the situation at home is too hard for you to deal with at the moment and that you need some space. <br>  <br>  If you really aren't provoking her then it might be that she wants to control you or that she feels she deserves a life of her own and that having children has held her back.<br>  <br>  Maybe she sees you achieving more at your age than she did and strange as it sounds she could be jealous. <br>  <br>  Just remember that what she says about you and how she treats you doesn't reflect on you as a person. Be sure of who you are and don't lose faith in yourself!<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  xx<br>  x|`|yFBKkcqLaa	I feel for you, I kind of know what your saying. I too did go through this when I was younger, I couldnt stand my mother either but as I grew up and started having children of my own we started a bond. I think maybe you are too much alike. Do you see your father at all? Do you and your brother have different fathers? This could be because you remind her of your father and maybe they didnt have such a good relationship and everytime she sees you you remind her of this. The most important thing to remember in this is it is not your fault. You've done nothing wrong.|`|LCjjbKnUaa	yah but pleaze 4GOD almighty sake........theres no  mother in this universe who hate her girl.....i  dont  think so....and  u  please just 16 so  cool down,,,,,,,when  u will go to ur freind sarah...or where ever.....u will definately miss her...so  try  not to  get sentimental.....today being a girl she will help u but what about TOMORROW???? think twice be4  u do  that anihow.......all  the best....|`|pcB7CotSaa	No mother in the world would ever be mean to her daughter on purpose.

Mck3SC3Iaa	well am 13 aswell babe am a boy, and ive snogged many a times with my girlfreind , look i was nervous but you seriously have nothing to worry about. there is no way in hell that someone can be bad at snogging its impossible! just do it when yous guys are alone and both kissing and it'll just happen and plus it feels amazing so my advice is give into temptation and do it , you wont be awfull noone can be its to easy :) good luck :)|`|jyx31zqHaa	build up to it, start with just a kiss then he will lead before you know it you will be "snogging" its not that big a deal seriously when you look back on this when your older you will wonder what you were so worried about =]|`|QY0ETRH0aa	well-basicallly-its-tongue-to-toungue.or...|`|7z9eKO2maa	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Kiss" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Kiss</a>|`|YWdNTZU3aa	snog<br>  wow kids these days|`|776402222f313576ef25a004cfb3aed8aa	I don't even know what SNOG means...

ojNHRsj7aa	ew. i was in the same situation about 2 weeks ago. i dumped his ***.<br>  <br>  go with your instinct, its usually right|`|UG2z5rGIaa	leave him,<br>   you know a guy is bad <br>  if he doesnt introduce you to his friends or family etc. and keeps you a secret. that means he's ashamed of you or something.<br>  <br>  which is crazy cuz you seem really awesome.<br>  <br>  so eff him, he's not worth it, he sounds liek he just wants some chick to place beside him.|`|TMPtDDj7aa	Positive- Just from my experience with boys I wouldn't really say hes using you, cause like you said your not having sex, which is what boys usually want out of girls<br>  <br>  Negative- i defenitely think you should dumb him, if he hasn't told any of his family or friends by now that you all are dating, then it sounds like he is ashamed of you or doesn't like you as much as you may like him to let others know.  And the whole seeing each other once every other week and ignoring you texts just shows that he must have other things to do than be with his girlfriend. So i basically think you should tell him how u feel about things and get his side of it, if he truly doesn't<br>   want a girlfriend than you need to dumb him, cause nobody is worth any girls time if their like that.<br>  <br>  I HOPE THIS HELPS =]

wbOrZjw1aa	I say do what you feel is right with you and this guy. Do what's on your heart, is my advice, and maybe pray about it if it's something that is troubling you. It could be the start of something beautiful if it works out. <br>  If it's only your friend's view on him that is holding you back, then I guess maybe speak to her or something. If she's a true friend I'd hope she'd support you, unless she has genuine reason to be against it. Hating him and wishing him dead for being a loner seems very extreme to me. <br>  Also, you can't choose who you fall in love with. So I'm told anyway. Maybe talk to this guy and see what happens. Hopefully you'll find out if he's the right guy for you, and I wish you all the best.|`|vrfuO9Asaa	yeah,of course.xx|`|xU36GJk2aa	Yes definitely<br>  <br>  Who cares what your friend says? I think your friend secretly likes him. Besides if she wants him dead, she isn't much of a friend. And the guy. He probably needs you at the moment, especially if his mates are blanking him, so go out with him.|`|OjERIM3Paa	You should do what makes you happy. Don't just go out with him cos he doesn't have anyone else as then you may not be happy and want to break up with him and this could make him worse off. But if you really feel that you like him then what do you have to lose. <br>  <br>  P.S Don't worry what your friend thinks, thats just harsh and if she was your friend she wouldn't fall out with you just because of this and if she des then she isn't much of a friend. She could also be jealous that he loves you and not her so be careful<br>  <br>  All the best =)|`|trxEyVRLaa	YES! Do the right thing :) Make both of you feel happy and who cares about your friend - if she can't accept it ignore her for a bit :) xx
54vt2jXRaa	People don't like what they're not used to.  They think that if it's anything different from them, it's wrong.  People are just so close-minded these day.  It doesnt make sense to me either.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	It's called Stereotyping and you just did it when you said "everyone".  People of color have lived with it all their lives and so must gay people and other people who choose to stand apart.  There is a difference between choosing a lifestyle/look and being born that way.  <br>  <br>  I agree that you have to look inside the person and make your own choice.  IMO if someone dresses Gothic or to an extreme they've lost any chance of me getting to know them.  Same goes for cross dressers, etc.  They shouldn't advertise.|`|ejosT3OVaa	well for one in the bible it says pretty much GOD made man and woman and man and woman should be together. (in my words lol) SO thats one reason cause its biblically wrong.<br>  <br>  2. People are just disgusted by it and dont want anything to do with them so they dont try to hit on them.<br>  <br>  Me. I do think its wrong and I do think its gross and I dont want them hitting on me. I mean for crying out loud I dont even want my OB GYN being a girl. I dont even lock arms with a girl (like girls do) etc etc.<br>  BUT I dont look down on them and I will still be friends with them, I dont look at them like horrible people. I mean My uncle is gay, but I dont look at him like he's not apart of my family.|`|0ycoeVpZaa	i personally am straight and wud nevr be interested in other girls but i agree, i dont think stuff like that matters as long as the person is happy. i guess its mostly bc they cant understand/ relate to it so they just naturally hav a negative response.|`|iUtyIuLnaa	Actually, more people accept alternative sexuality now than have ever before. Here's the thing: people are afraid of things that are different, and of change. The reason it's called homophobia is because it is a fear, one that is sadly manifested as judgment or worse, hatred. <br>  <br>  I have no problem with what people do with other consensual adults in the privacy of their bedroom. I do think that there are many gay/lesbian people who should stop being defensive, feeling they have to shove their sexuality down everyones throats. Sleep with whomever you like, but you don't have to tell *everyone* who you sleep with. Some things are personal and should be honored as such.|`|EoPZnFZlaa	Being older, I can tell you that it is not nearly as bad as it used to be.  Just being gay was reason enough to get beaten or killed just 20 years ago.  I don't think people look down upon others for that nearly as much as they used to.  Most people don't care about others sexuality.  It shouldn't matter at all; I personally know junkies with purer souls than the judges they've stood in front of.  And don't let what others think dictate who you choose for friends.  Blessed Be!|`|7EiWSuPLaa	sometimes a gay couple will make it so obvious that they are gay and flaming fags at that the same with lesbians hey if you want to go to hell when you die fine but don't make me watch it because i don't care and i find it offensive as i would find someone sitting at a party rolling up their sleeve and getting off. or someone  hitting a small child in public it's just the way i am and i like it.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	It makes no sense to me either.  It's about fear and ignorance.<br>  <br>  2. People are just disgusted by it and dont want anything to do with them so they dont try to hit on them.<br>  Seriously, if you are straight, what makes you think that you are so perfect that everyone who is gay is going to want to hit on YOU?  People that think like the above, please get over yourselves.<br>  <br>  sometimes a gay couple will make it so obvious that they are gay and flaming fags at that the same with lesbians hey if you want to go to hell when you die fine but don't make me watch it because i don't care and i find it offensive as i would find someone sitting at a party rolling up their sleeve and getting off. or someone hitting a small child in public it's just the way i am and i like it.<br>  LMAO at this, wants his cake and eat it too.  Thinks he should be allowed to slather all over his girlfriend in public but doesn't want everyone to have the same rights.  Violence to a small child is NOT the same thing as being gay.  Educate yourselves people.
e28KtQTqaa	Girls who are always with jerks often have self-esteem issues.  It's horrible and dysfunctional, but it's the way things are.  If you ever ended up with her, chances are good that unless she fixes herself, you'd end up having a bad relationship.<br>  <br>  Why don't you just try being a good friend?  It sounds to me like she might need a good shoulder more than she needs a new boyfriend.
Ym9Er1fUaa	Whew, Blows my mind. **** winds are a blowin. Try to show her that you like her and tell her the news that your friend does not like her and that he is really stuck on his girlfriend and thats not going to change and tell her that you are there for her and see where things take you.
kGBli717aa	He seems to have a fixation. He obviously has a thing for you and apparently can't take his eyes off your lips. I have heard girls complain about guys that instead of looking into there eyes when they speak to them, are staring at their breasts. So, I guess it could be worse. <br>  If you fancy him, this could be a good thing, if you don't, you best avoid him.
4EWCegiRaa	Invite him to something friendly where there's going to be a group of people:  <br>  <br>  "My friends and I are going to [name something] this Saturday, you should come"  This will also make hanging out easier as you'll be in a group.<br>  <br>  If he says yes, say "Good. Let me get your number"<br>  If he says no, he says no...  It happens to all of us.
mojg4PL0aa	I have to respectfully disagree that "guys do not grow up until at least 25" or that they don't grow up over-night. In my personal experience I was in a really bad way and grew up basically over-night. Actually 3 nights but that's beside the point. The point is you have to put effort into growing up. It isn't something that just comes to you on a whim, or something that has a specific time set to it. If this guy isn't making any effort to get his act together or to get a job, GED, schooling, etc. then why should you be expected to endure this type of behavior? You two are obviously headed in two separate directions with your lives, and when something is pulled in opposite directions it either gets tighter, tougher, harder to damage (like the knot); or it is torn apart like paper. You really need to assess the situation, give it some personal thought, and discuss it with him. If things are left as is he's just going to hold you back. I would personally suggest either doing something to get his attention (speaking with him, give an ultimatum, etc.) or cut your losses and move on with your seemingly successful life. Also from one "young" person to another, I'm 19 years old and still live with my mother. I don't have a job because of my personal medical and mental situation and we are in the middle of purchasing a house but living with your mother at that age isn't really all that bad. Not having a job when you could and should have one is on the other hand. Moving in together at this stage in your relationship would be a huge mistake just given the both of your situation. That's my two cents.<br>  <br>  -Zach-|`|eEDQ9qKeaa	Men do not grow up until at LEAST 25.|`|YCSGSlXkaa	You know, I don't think you have to give up on him, per se, but neither would I encourage you to go ahead with plans to move in together.  I mean, maybe he's not going to get his act together in the normal way.  Maybe you are going to be the breadwinner type and he'll have an easy job or something that he goes to from 9-5 and he does something mundane and repetitive and he doesn't move up, and he's happy with it.  I don't know.  Maybe that's not what you want in a guy.  Maybe that's just what the cultural expectation refers to as "lazy" in men at this juncture.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't want to do anything with his life right now, nothing you can say is going to make him.  I would just concentrate on getting what you want and have fun with him when you can and let him worry about things.  And  yeah, maybe I'd hold off moving in together since he's not really doing anything at the moment.|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	Look, he may have had it hard, and dyslexia is a real pain, but if he's not trying, he's not worth it.<br>  <br>  Once you move in with him, his effort level will drop even further.  I'd make it a requirement for his moving in with you that he pass and obtain his GED.<br>  <br>  Really, guys don't change overnight.  Once a slacker, always a slacker.|`|AA11841749	Life is way too short to waste your years on a lazy person who doesn't give as much as you do. I think you should move on. And I also think you two moving in together would be a huge mistake.
7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	Well, are you two still being intimate?  Or did you stop after that drunken new years eve?<br>  <br>  Look, a friendship takes two people to maintain it.  You indicated you weren't even looking him in the eye in your previous question.  How do you think that makes him feel?  You've been or are lovers, but you won't look him in the eye.  He must feel like you are ashamed of him, or really don't like him.<br>  <br>  You want the friendship back.  So, work on that.  It doesn't preclude you being in the bedroom, but that's between you two.  But, you have to do your part to get the friendship back on track.|`|uhRKCb9kaa	all you need to do is make your self bzy
pnSB2wzCaa	for what i can read he seems like a guy that dont know what he wants, and definitly not ready for a relationship.<br>  <br>  to be honest a guy that breaks up over a text msj is not worth any girls while. if he broke up with u because having thoughts of other women chances are you dont have sex with him and is a way to pressure you.<br>  <br>  either way, you know the situation, follow your instinct THEY USUALLY RIGHT LOL|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	He had a chance, while you were dating.

He'll just do it again later.
srrTkpx3aa	Ya to some girls its a turn on to know that a guy would take you instead of the other girl.<br>  but honestly, if your looking for a true relationship you shouldnt do that. because he could do it to you, or cheat and u wouldnt even know.<br>  <br>  just think, it is a great turn on etc. But honestly, do you want to be in a relationship with a guy who cant control his hormones and says he cares when you where the other women? what about the girl after you? <br>  <br>  <br>  think about it.|`|CbRr3upaaa	start masturbating
T72COWC8aa	My guess is she misses you at certain moments during the day & has the sudden urge to contact you. I guess some people enjoy the "distance" thing.

8bTder08aa	If you keep doing what you're doing, you'll keep getting what you're getting.  So the answer is to stop coping and start doing something that might change the situation.<br>  <br>  An obvious first step is counseling or therapy.  If your husband will go with you, fine, if not, go without him.  Please understand that the purpose of therapy is not to try to figure out how to "fix" your husband, but rather how to understand what you can do to deal with him the way he is.  What your options are and what you, yourself, want to do.  (Many people make two mistakes about therapy:  they go into it with the intention of trying to make someone else change, and they go into it thinking that the therapy itself will fix things.  Wrong on both counts.  You cannot fix/change someone else, and therapy merely points you in the direction you can go;  taking the steps on the journey is up to you.)<br>  <br>  It seems fairly obvious that your husband has an alcohol problem;  this is the Mayo Clinic's section on alcoholism  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/alcoholism/DS00340/DSECTION=symptoms." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/alcohol...</a><br>  <br>  Your husband might also have an underlying problem with mental illness.  His behaviors sound an awful lot like someone who has bipolar mood disorder;  many people who are undiagnosed bipolar use alcohol to "self-medicate."  This is the section on bipolar mood disorder:  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bipolar-disorder/DS00356" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bipolar...</a> <br>  <br>  (My dad was bipolar so I know what the behaviors are like.)<br>  <br>  The main thing:  you need help, you need to stop "coping" and start taking steps to change your situation.  An appointment with a counselor would be a good first step.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|43eUq8hOaa	tell him that if he wants to keep being an a------,that he can be one all alone.Tell him that you cannot live that way anymore.If he loves you and cherishes his marraige,he will work on himself.Mine did the same thing until I gave him a choice,then he took more notice.I hope that helps,honey.Good luck!!!|`|AA11349925	Get a divorce, is your life worth wasting on an abusive drunken lout who has no respect for you or his family? Get your life back and get away from this loser.|`|gfHutvEFaa	Sounds like he needs AA. If he won't go, it would be wise for you to go Al-Anon meetings. If he doesn't start helping himself it will only get worse.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Hi. I suggest a tape recorder or video camera. Catch him on tape when he gets like this and show him the next time he's sober.<br>  Hope that does the trick.<br>  Blessings!|`|owBzohxVaa	Tell him you're going to drop his *** if he doesn't stop..<br>  and follow through!!|`|1HTRWrawaa	He doesn't remember how abusive he was to you and everyone else? Ya right!!!!!! You actually buy into this line of crap he is telling you??? Saying he doesn't remember any of it, is his way of ridding himself of the responsibility of what he did and said. <br>  <br>  Your husband has a serious problem and you are his enabler by making excuses for his behavior. Your marriage is like a carbon copy of a marriage of someone I know. He does the same exact things to her that your husband does to you. Her husband is an alcoholic and he's not only mentally abusive, but he now abuses her physically. When she leaves the house to get away from his abuse, he calls her on her cell phone constantly. He abuses her on the phone and demands that she comes home. When that doesn't work he tells her he's sorry and misses her and wants to be with her. When she comes home it's always the same thing. He yells horrible things at her and half of the time, he starts hitting her. The next day he claims he doesn't remember anything and even accusing her of lying. She even has the bruises to prove he hit her, but he still says he didn't do it. He's a liar, a coward, a jerk, and refuses to go to AA and get some counselling for HIS problem. According to him, he's not the problem, she is or somebody else is the problem.<br>  <br>  Continue staying with your husband and you will end up just like her. No self esteem! Feeling she is doing something wrong and if she could just make him happy and be the kind of wife he wants her to be, then they would have a good marriage and everything will be okay then. She stayed with him too long and now she's trapped and can't stop saying she stays with him because she loves him and "sometimes" he can be really nice. It's really sad how this man has abused her into this kind of a woman and she won't leave him. <br>  <br>  I hope you still have enough self esteem left in you, to walk away from this kind of life and stop dreaming that things will get better if you just try harder. Things are really bad for you now, they will only grow to becoming a life of hell. Stop using love as an excuse to stay with him. Get out, while you still can.|`|Ka3fbxszaa	Ultimately, you concentrate on taking care of yourself. Seek counseling if you need to. I was married to a verbally abusive man for YEARS! I let it tear me down...in hind site, I should have done things a lot differently. My husband did not drink...thank goodness. Who knows how badly that could have turned out.<br>  <br>  If your husband is drinking on a regular basis you may want to seek out an AA support group for yourself. Verbal abuse is as harmful if not more so as physical abuse...All the mind games can really get to you...DON"T let it. Get support from somewhere. Keep yourself strong and then you will be able to make good decisions about your situation.<br>  <br>  It is easy to say leave, leave, leave. BUT easier said than done sometimes. Everyone's situation is different. My marriage did eventually end in divorce but that is not always the case.<br>  <br>  Remember that this is HIS problem...not yours. He is making it yours. Stay strong!|`|QstEk6PZaa	"Never remembers" and "not remembering"....yeah right! I dont give a damn how drunk you claim to be, a drunk ones words are a sober ones thoughts, 100%. I would try to figure out why he says those things, and tell him to grow up. Its needed.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Oh yes he does remember.  He's just trying to make you feel bad for reacting to his awful behavior.  Tell him to get help controlling his temper or get out!!  Do not continue in this abusive relationship.|`|ygAkXSknaa	Can it be anything underlying that bothers and frustrates him deap inside?|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	Love is not a fight but worth fighting for...yes it was wrong for him to do all that but get to the core of the problem and then love him through it...it is worth it.|`|AA11513207	Professional help is needed, though I doubt he'll go willingly.<br>  <br>  I would almost bet that he was an only child.<br>  Seems like he never really grew up.<br>  <br>  This really isn't a good time for divorce, but you might want to consider some kind of agreement with him so that he understands that he's crossing the line and if he continues, he'll face consequences.|`|FXINmF6saa	Well honestly it isn't going to get better. There's really no way to stop what he is doing and really he's not going to stop. I had the same problem with my ex husband, he would drink and he was whole new person. He doesn't know how to drink. You really need to talk to him about what it is you feel because if you don't it's not going to just go away. It can get to the point where he can hurt you and before he does you need to stop him. If he truly loves you then he'll change his ways for you. Talk to him about his self-control. Tell him that he's loosing you little by little with his actions. Explain to him how he's hurting you emotionally and to please stop doing it. If he doesn't know how to control himself after a couple drinks then he shouldn't be drinking. If he wants to keep drinking then he could but just a little, not to the point where he's not concience of what he is doing, though. He needs to understand that he's not only hurting you, he's setting a bad example for your children and grandbaby. And he is probably building anger in your 15 yr old because who wants to see their mom get mistreated by a drunk dad. Don't blame anyone but him of his behavior it's no one's fault and your in a way taking some of his responsibility away. Don't ever try to talk sense into him while he's drunk do it when he's sober and well aware. If nothing works then you should really be looking into seperation because this is only going to cause tension, anger and resentment in your behalf. Trust me that is what happen to our relationship. So much resentment and anger I had towards him  because of his mistreats ended us and there's no one to blame but him. And all that about himn not remembering, it's not true. Like my mom always said, there's no drunk person that eats fire. He remembers exactly what he does but doesn't want to face the consequences that come with his actions. Good Luck and take very good of yourself! No one will love you more than yourself.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Before I answer, first I have to say something. Greg's Wife: Your answer is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Wearing a negligee is NOT going to help an alcoholic or someone with rage issues. Do you really believe the crap you are spewing? This man does NOT need to be coddled and seduced, he needs his **** kicked and to be put on notice. Get a grip sweetheart. You may want to be a subservient fool, but not everyone is that self-loathing. <br>  <br>  Ok, sorry for the digression. You need to record him at his worst, and then, when he is at his best, play the tape for him. Show him how hurtful and hateful he is behaving. If you are afraid, do it in a public place. (Headphones may be a good idea!) Tell him you love him and want your marriage to work, but you cannot allow him to treat you this way any longer, and if he doesn't get help, you will have no choice but to leave him. I hope it works out for you.|`|iPFUJXvpaa	you should record him when that is happening ,then when he is sober make him listen to all the hurtful things that he says and let him know that you are tired of this, he needs to stop or he will be alone for the rest of his life .|`|iUtyIuLnaa	I'm so sorry you're going through this. Does your husband have a problem with alcohol? Is that when he gets like this? If it is, or even if it's just anger and rage, maybe it's time for an intervention. Gather up everyone who is affected by his outbursts and rages, and have them prepare a statement about him, and how they've been hurt by him. Tell him (everyone tell him) that you love him and want things to be better, but you're not willing to live with him the way he is now, so he has to make a choice. He can either get the help he needs, or he can be alone. Also, you can try recording him the next time he's in a rage, then playing it back for him at the intervention so he can hear just how cruel he is when he gets that way. A lot of times, they don't even realize how bad it really is. Good luck.|`|mldo1vxYaa	It sounds like he has a problem with drink, he may not be drinking every day but he obviously cant handle the drink if he is being so hurtful and hateful and embarassing himself and you.<br>  <br>  Tell him you would like him to stop drinking as you dont like the person he becomes when he drinks and you are finding it very hard to deal with. Then try to get to the bottom of whatever is causing him to be so angry over little things, there is obviously something on his mind.|`|rlQOjyhbaa	sounds like he is stressed out bad is there anything that relieves his stress also see about helping him avoid the things that stress him out also there are things that others are better at then some but one thing for sure hes better at you an loving you then anyone else otherwise you wouldn't be there let him know that if the drinking is a problem next time he goes for a beer grab him an kiss him give him something to do to help with the stress besides drink he also sounds a bit depressed revitalize him let him know you can help too|`|xwZV9jgPaa	sounds like my EX husband. He would get all worked up over the stuff that happened at work over maybe a week or 2 time frame and then drunk to calm himself. Problem was once he got drunk he became emotionally abusive. he would throw things and break stuff all around our house. He bent a mop around the washing machine, he threw a marble chess set off the top of a dresser and it hit the floor so hard it stuck into the floor. It got to the point where one night he pinned me against the wall in front of the kids and then took a knife and held it to his wrists. That was the final straw, I packed up the kids and left then filed for divorce. You are being abused emotionally. You and your children need to get out of that situation and he needs to get help.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	you shouldn't have to put up with this crap, living your life on egg shells. I would bet he knows exactly what he says to you so don't believe that he doesn't. He is acting like a 2 year old. If he can't leave his troubles from work at work, he needs to get a different job. My guess is that is just an excuse too. You don't need to be put down and there is no excuse for him putting you down especially in front of other people. Putting you down makes him feel like he is worth something, but he is not. You need to get out of this relationship if nothing is going to change.  Your family should not be around this behavior either.  He needs to go to get some help, and if he is not willing to, you should kick him out of the house. tell him this behavior has gone on long enough, and you are not going to put up with it any more.|`|j9nhk1v2aa	Either you need a family counselor or you may need to consider being safe for not only you, but your kids. Sounds like its more to it than that. No one gets that upset about a certain person on their job, and then takes it out on his family for every little thing they do.

This is a woman to woman statement if you know what I mean.|`|AA10986891	He needs to find a way other than drinking to deal with this stuff, if he can not find you will have to leave. How are you going to cope with it when he starts throwing the crap at you and then he starts beating on you just because??????????<br>  <br>  He needs to stop drinking and to find something to use his free time & energy, perhaps a hobby you two could share could help you bond and erease this past incidents|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	as you said its hurtful... so tape it and play it back to him. so he can here it for him self .. then just say if it happends again .. leave the house .. as you dont neeed this bull. any more mate .. and grow up..|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Does this all come about as a result of him drinking?

MDWaPmXsaa	We most certainly did, and the agreement was zero kids.<br>  However..I did make sure to discuss with my husband what would happen if nature took its course despite all birth control efforts.  I needed to know that he would not flip out and abandon me,  and that he would be there for both of us.  I would not have married him if I thought it would become a nightmare situation if I got pregnant.  <br>  I was satisfied with his answer, and luckily, our marriage is going on 6 years with still zero kids. :-)|`|NuvKPl3naa	just like jon and kate you never know. you can say 3 and get 8. but i did talk about it with my husband. we wanted 2 but ended up adopting 4. so you never know. however if you dont want any and the other person does that wont work. but someone like you cousin and wife you can say one and end up with triplets. but if you at least want one then you probably could not turn away 3|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	After I got engaged..we started talking more seriously about family..number of children..we ended up with three|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Yes.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	A couple that I know got married, she wanted children, he agreed. They had two boys, he left. He did not want any children but never said, went along with it thinking that it might not happen I guess. <br>  So sometimes people say things or agree to things because they are in love or lust or something, they don't always mean it. Within a marriage or relationship people change, circumstances change, they get older.|`|qcvjUgHzaa	Yes, me and the hubby have it all planned out. 3 children and 1 adoption.

But a person can easily change their mind. You might want several kids but after going through a really hard pregnancy, you are satisfied with only one. Or you may only want one child and then decide that it's best to give the child siblings. Things can completely change in that area.

You should find someone who is more deserving of you.|`|T6Yab30haa	He could be doing it for a number of reasons but i think the most probable one would be cause he doesn't want to hurt or feel bad. I find that when i get mad i don't feel pain, loss, or anything just power. If he thinks that you like his best friend the he is probable doubting what you had together and he might find it easier for himself if he blames you for something. <br>  But that's his problem and you should not let it bring you down. It doesn't concern him who you like or don't like.

It isn't as easy as you think ...you need a strong support group behind you.<br>  <br>  PLEASE talk to someone before you do this...you need support.  I am not saying Keep this to yourself..it is the worst thing you can do...but you need HELP in how to do this and what to do with the reactions and aftermath.  It doesn't always work out in your favor....people are in denial and people will protect their own minds and sanity....<br>  <br>  Talk to someone first.   BEEN THERE...DONE THAT..and all I can say is THANK GOD for my husband....he was my only saving grace.<br>  <br>  It is easy for people who have not been there to say tell him...but they do not understand the dynamics of all these relationships and how people live with this.  IT is another world they do not understand and it is far from making sense to anyone......<br>  <br>  Believe me...you have to know how to handle the aftermath...it isn't as easy as telling the truth and setting yourself free.....there is a lot of stuff that goes on with that and the aftermath.<br>  <br>  You are looking for safety and validation and for someone to believe you....you might not get what you want.

I know if I had a daughter and that happened to her I would want to talk to her and be really nice to her because that is a horrible thing to happen to someone. You should tell your dad because obviously your mother is being a terrible mother. From what you said she doesn't even act like she cares but maybe your dad will. And if your mom gets mad just tell her that you needed to tell someone. Don't owrry you are an adult so what is she gonna do? I am really sorry that happened to you. If your unlce and your cousin are not in jail already you need to tell the police. And I think you should protect your daughter very strongly and make sure this doesn't happen to her. I am sure you are a good mother and I am sure you will do what is right.|`|c2uywBsIaa	With it being your mothers dad and brother I bet there is a pattern here. I seem to think that the reason your uncle did this to you is because your grandfather done it to him as well as your mother. This may be the reason your mother wants to keep it on the DL.<br>  She may want you to react the way she did and thats why she is directing you on how to deal w/o telling anyone else. This is sad. I sometimes beleive that victims victimize others because of their own issues. I would tell your father. You also need to keep your daughter AWAY from these people.|`|vVolxFyRaa	There are probably plenty of resources in your community that you can use for free.  Open up your local yellow book and look in the front and back there are plenty of social services such as hotlines that you can call and share your story with and im sure if you want revenge on the other two people who are still alive there are plenty of pro-bono lawyers that will in fact sue or press charges on the people who molested you if you can prove that it happened, not that i doubt it!, and as far as financial support, im sure social services can hook you up!|`|mMByiHaQaa	You're right, he does have a right to know and just sorta put the blame on yourself if you want to keep their marrage, like say to him<br>  "I just thought I would tell you *say the story* sorry you didn't find out earlier, I made mum keep a promise not too tell no-one because I was nervous" Just carry on from there or something.<br>  Good Luck! :)|`|77Nl6fmkaa	I think you should just sit down and explain everything to your dad. Your right, he deserves to know. If you tell him, he can assist you on getting help for your emotional and mental problems. Don't be afraid and good luck =)|`|6YPNM71Iaa	well if he loves you enough then he will believe you. molestation is not anything to be lieing about so i think he will believe you.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Contact your county mental health office. They will be able to direct you to low or no cost mental health care in your area.|`|qi88afqYaa	seek a therapist and they will heklp you figure out whhat YOU really want to do.Best of luck.|`|AA11142539	Wow... why are you asking your mom's permission to talk to your dad?<br>  <br>  In your situation I would get the heck away from your family; If they really turned a blind eye for so long you have no allies in that household and it's a dangerous place for your daughter.<br>  <br>  Depending on where you live, there tend to be help programs sponsored by the state and various charity organizations that may be able to get you on your feet.  I would do some research online and head out as quickly as possible.|`|JbXUtNYvaa	i think you should tell him and also tell him how you felt afterwards. tell him about how bad the depression has been and about the fact that you were contemplating suicide since you were 13 to 18 and tell him you didnt want to tell him because you werent sure of his reaction would be. Also tell him that you want the professional help but have no ideal as to how to go about getting it. Tell him that you want to be able to move forward with your life and be happy again. He may be able to help you and if he can't at least you will have gotten it off your chest with him. I dont know if it will makes things better with you or him but if he is a caring parent then he would want to know.|`|hWyQUVdYaa	It sounds like you have an unfit mother, which is not as uncommon as you might think. Whether you tell you father or not will not make any difference. Your best bet would be to concentrate on yourself and try to improve your life. If all these events happened to you and your father didn't notice, he's probably unfit also. It will not do any good telling him and it will only upset you more because he will not do anything about it either.|`|yFBKkcqLaa	Oh my god YES tell your father, You are right he has a right to know. Even if it happened in the past. I believe you what makes you think your father wont. Obviously you and your father have a great relationship and that's a good thing. Don't be scared of telling anyone. No one has the right to do that to you. You could try looking in your local phone book for free advice or counseling in your area. We have them here in New Zealand so i assume they are all around the world. Get help please especially now you have a child.|`|4OaCHgWeaa	I'm assuming your parents are separated.  Maybe it would be better to live with your dad, then eventually tell him.<br>  <br>  You talked alot about the rapes but not alot about your living situation.  Repost the question with more details about that, and your relationship with your dad, and where you are at in your life with school and your goals, so that people might be able to give you better answers.|`|iLC0KfP8aa	The truth shall set you free. "Is there any place I can get help for myself that doesn't cost a lot of money?" Yes, it would involve praying to God. Whether it's at home or at Mass it doesn't mather. Ask the Lord for the strength to 'deal with this' (for lack of a better phrase).<br>  <br>  "...her response: "Why does he have to know" I told her that he deserves to know what happened to his lil girl" I would agree with you.<br>  <br>  God Bless you.|`|e6pr7bzTaa	You should tell him your mom does not want to believe you because it is her dad and if your dad knows she thinks he will be mad at her 1. for waiting this long to tell him and 2. having his father in law,nephew, and brother and law rape you and no legal actions were done he will believe you and understand you don't worry|`|Gs0jtsebaa	yeah you HAVE to tell ur dad. Once ur dad knows i bet he will believe you if not tell your teacher, aunt, or someone not in ur family(1st tell ppl inside ur family is no one believes u then go to teachers ect). Hope the really best for ya.|`|uld2Fgc3aa	Yes u have to tell him, no offence but your mum is a B**CH, this is a terrible thing that happened to u and u need someone to talk to about it (your father) he deserves to know!|`|e6657aae9a5e6165c0768975ea7fd38daa	screw that tell him he has the right to know and if he doesn't beleive you just do something about it...you honestly probly should have told the cops back then but yea tell him don't care what she says|`|CAdAlCEPaa	I would tell him if i were you <br>  your mom is wrong for keeping it from everyone<br>  basically her actions are saying lets just keep this secret like it never happened which is bullshit|`|OtKCAeQZaa	You want to truly deal with this then go to the Police.|`|AG4C6fliaa	its up to you, but i think you should tell him, your mother is in the wrong here.|`|Z5V2yjSWaa	might be hard but you should tell him|`|sE2RH0A7aa	God, do you really need our help to do the right thing?|`|ASs3OPDSaa	Are your cousin and your uncle still out there? Don't you think they might be doing the same thing to other people? You should go to the police now that you're an adult and report them if your mom was too irresponsible to report it herself when you were a minor and told her. How can she get mad at you instead of helping you recover? Is she crazy? When you go to the police department they will help you get in touch with a counselor who will help you get over your depression. Think about the other girls whose lives these child molesters could ruin. It seems like you should tell your dad also, maybe he will be more responsible and he'll help you. Whatever you do, you should definitely go to the police and get help!<br>  I hope everyhting turns out fine.|`|bP6tE3anaa	i agree he has a right too know. you are old enough to tell him your self now, as for help the best thing you can do is ask your doctor to refer you for counseling.|`|mqTEGbCYaa	Your right. He deserve to know. Invite your father out and tell him everything. Start by telling him how you have already told your mom but she dosent believe you and that you hope he does because he is the only person left you can count on. Then you tell everything. Who cares about their marriage. If your mother dosent believe you ( no offense) she dosent deserve your father or you in her life.  YOu also shouldn't care what other family members said as long as you have your father, which i think is the most important thing.Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.s. You should called him right know and tell him you need to talk to him|`|ffIsioRMaa	just sit down with your dad and tell him and it ist a joke and you should report it and im sorry but your mom is a *** she sould have done more tings about that.
K9Bcqloqaa	Long distance relationships are tough to keep going.  That could cause a bit of stress.  When I started to date my husband-to-be, I was always insecure and thinking that maybe he didn't want to be with me, or found me ugly to look at, and I would work myself into a negative space.  He is a great guy, I love him dearly.  I am very happy to be with him.  But what helped me was just talking to him about it.  I told him, "not for nothing, I'm insecure, emotionally ****** up, and I love ya."  I told him my worries, and doubts.  We worked through it, and we are going strong.  It's been a year and a month I believe.  Maybe you need to talk to him.  Tell him your fears and doubts of your relationship.  Open up to him.  If he is understanding as you say, he will say something that will help you get through this.  You are not alone, because a lot of girls, even guys feel this way.  I wish you the best of luck.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	ldr dont work ever<br>  dont even bother<br>  you are handicapping yourself subconsciously for a good reason<br>  find out what that reason is<br>  follow your gut

QstEk6PZaa	1 - yes<br>  2 - not really<br>  3 - hell no, and hell no. I believe if you want an affiar, just leave your wife. You dont love her anymore at this point. If she is not giving you sex, find out why.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	1) Does frequent intercourse with your wife make you feel closer to her as a whole?<br>  <br>  Yes.  I definitely feel more emotionally connected to my wife after sex.<br>  <br>  2) Does your wifes appearance/ looks matter to you a lot or not so much?<br>  <br>  Her looks matter to me somewhat, sure.  She is still an attractive woman at 43, for which I am very grateful.<br>  <br>  3) Do you ever look at other women and would you ever have an affair, why or why not?<br>  <br>  I very frequently look at other women, and my wife knows (and dislikes) this, but hopefully I'm reasonably discrete about it most of the time.  I cheated on my wife once in the past and learned a great deal about how hurtful it can be to a marriage.  Since I don't want ever to hurt her like that again, and since I believe that cheating is wrong, I 100% intend never to cheat on her again!|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Yes, makes me feel much closer.  Guys have a hard time sharing feelings...this makes us feel closer.<br>  <br>  Hey appearance matters...but not all that much.<br>  <br>  Yes, always look at other women.....but wouldn't have an affair.|`|AA10681117	Yes<br>  Not so much<br>  Every waking hour of every day, but no I would not have an affair because I'm committed to my wife.|`|gB1dXEHCaa	1)  no<br>  2) don't care any more because my girlfriend is freakin HOT<br>  3) see #2|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	I'm going to answer on behalf of my husband.<br>  <br>  1) yes/no.  Frequent intercourse brings us close together physically.  But we're close mentally/emotionally all the time.<br>  2) He appreciates that I'm above average looking, but my looks are not my number one quality.  He did not marry me for my looks.<br>  3)  He's a real man.  Of course he looks at other women. Real men find women beautiful...  Would he have an affair?  No way.  Real men don't cheat.  IF their marriage isn't good, they fix it or end it, but they don't disrespect it.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	1) Yes<br>  2)  Appearance is somewhat important, we all age over time but I do appreciate a woman who has the self respect to take care of herself.<br>  3)  Do I look occasionally?  Yes, I am human.  Would I ever have an affair?  Absolutely not.  I would never break that trust.
0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I have the impression that he has a bit of depression going on, and these 'dates' are his medication. Has he seen a doctor at all about any health issue? Do you have the same Doctor and have you tried a consultation with the Doctor? <br>  <br>  To be feeling so overwhelmed by things tells me he doesn't have the greatest of coping skills, which in turn tells me he probably didn't go far academically.<br>  <br>  Note: There are some parts of the brain that become activated when someone is having an 'affair' and those areas can help to relieve depression.<br>  <br>  Other points of curiosity, Has there been bouts of heavy drinking? Is he overweight or have health issues (heavy smoking)  that could be at play?|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	.. i can only say .... get this man out of your life as you would be better off without him.. i know how you feel.. but .. a man would not let his wife sleep on a couch and then date a woman as well.. come .. on .. get a life get rid of this rot .. now .. get it over with .. a divorce .. is best sorry but true ...|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Give him one final warning and if he doesn't shape up then file for a divorce. Find a shark of a lawyer who will take him for everything he has got. He will not have too many girlfriends when he has no money for sushi and drinks.|`|t81MEJ82aa	You cannot make a marriage work by yourself. There is but so much you can do. If I were you, I would collect all of the evidence that I can so that you can positively, unequivocally know that he is cheating. Once you do, move forward with a divorce or join the party and start dating other men. If one of you don't care to make the marriage work, then there is nothing the other can possibly do about it. Either keep wasting your life or move forward.|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	You both need marriage counseling and be more loving to each other|`|AA11899639	divorce|`|GLKD89wnaa	Well just move on sweaty.|`|AA12187979	Is he gay?|`|F8wzcKntaa	Sounds like you need  to get a divorce.I understand that you have been together forever but you shouldn't be second chose for NO ONE. If he's dating someone else then you should believe that he is ******* someone else. Especially if you are the one initiating the intercourse when you do have sex. Please don't get mad but don't be stupid and yes I don't know you but from what you are saying I really think you should seriously think about DIVORCE|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Well, it sounds as though neither of you are happy in the relationship. Are you staying together for the kids? If not, then it sounds like it's time to end it. From what you've said, it would appear as though you have been trying to make it work, but it's just not. It doesn't sound like he even wants to fix the relationship. Honestly, for the sake of your own happiness, you two should separate. Even if you don't want to jump right to the divorce, you two should try being apart for a little while. I can't say because I don't know you, but it doesn't even sound like you love him anymore. You two have drifted apart. He is already seeing other people to try and find happiness again. I would really recommend you two go your separate ways. Well, good luck with everything. I really hope it works out for you.|`|Yby3loNEaa	why are you still with him? you have kids to think of!! do you think that they have no idea what is gong on, they do they can see it in your face. i'm sorry that you have been been in this for 21 years, but you have one life one life come on don't you want to be happy. you are going to look back when you are 80 and slap your self in the face you your kids and husband could be happy. sometimes things just don't work out don't put the kids though that they deserve and happy mom and dad good luck|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I'm not sure what you want insight about.  You seem to understand your husband very well.  You seem exceptionally tolerant and understanding - too much so, some might say.  <br>  <br>  He won't go to counseling, but what about a doctor?  You say he's unhappy, pessimistic, negative, and overly stressed, all of which are symptoms of depression.  I know this, because there have been times in my life when I have taken medication for it.  The meds really work.  They have few side effects, and they make you feel normal, not high.  If he could get treatment that effectively addresses his depression, his relationship with you might improve.<br>  <br>  I'm giving you a star so that hopefully more people will give you more ideas, because this one has me a little uncharacteristically stumped.|`|gB1dXEHCaa	it's really not a big deal.  i've dated lots of women since i've been married and slept with most of them.  it's just something we do for a little ego/confidence builder|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	May I ask why you are still with him? Is it because of the kids, because of habit, because of finances? Or is there something you get out of this marriage emotionally? Everyone's story is different; some people are perfectly fine with having an open marriage, others aren't. What are deal-breakers for you? It's hard to give you insight when it's not clear exactly what you get out of this marriage. His personality aside, is there any intimacy (not talking about sex - rather emotional intimacy), mutual support, enjoyment? If there's none of the above, exactly what is keeping you in this marriage? Desperation? Fear of being alone? Think about it.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Sounds like a mid-life crisis to me. My now-ex had one around that point in our marriage. He waffled around for 2 years, blaming me for his crappy life, even though I bent over backwards to make him happy. Only when someone fnally told me they saw him with someone did he admit the truth. We divorced after 24 years of marriage.<br>  <br>  I think you know what you need to do here. It sounds like it's all over but the paperwork. Go ahead and divorce, so you can be free to find someone who makes you happy--I did!

And then to try to put the two together, whew! you've got your work cut out.  <br>  <br>  You know loyalty comes with experience and longevity.  You may find a good looking man, but you can't count on loyalty until you get into one another and have some memories and experiences which bond you together.  And at any age you're going to have to examine his back ground and his upbringing to determine if he has the kind of character which supports loyalty.

Do you want a good looking loyal or honest man? One of the problem I have when it comes to being with a woman. They say that I'm too honest because I tell it like it is and I don't bite my tongue for no one. I am single because of that reason. And believe me, I hate being single. So this is why I am asking, are you looking for a loyal man or a honest man. I know some men who are very loyal, but are very dishonest. Oh and by the way. I am 42. People find it hard to believe because I look like I'm in my early 30's. I guess because  I don't smoke. I don't do drugs, I don't drink and I am not about the drama. I'm allergic to drama and negative people.|`|EvDmgWjvaa	The same as a man looking for a loyal good looking woman.<br>  Trail and error, one would hope you have seen & met the opposite of what your looking for.

GLKD89wnaa	Sorry to hear this. Well, you need to take it slow on everything. Your 4yr was the center of his mommy’s world and do not want share her with no one so why not do family time. Also, are you expecting your wife to give all the attention to your daughter and you are not doing anything. Is your job to make sure your daughter gets attention from you first and do not over load your wife with your daughter. It takes time for everyone to bond.|`|OYD5QqBfaa	You cant blame her, she doesn't have the maternal feeling towards your daughter because she didn't give birth to her, not only that but your daughter is pretty much past the mothering stage, what should your wife do, spoil her w/ gifts? i agree that she should spend more time with her but there isn't much your wife can do.

Your wife needs to realize that as a member of the family she is currently a part of, the amount of care and love should be equally spread between both of your children. Tell her how you feel about the situation and explain the negative outcomes that can arise from such a practice. The fact that she doesn't know what to do with your 14 year old daughter is not a good enough excuse to treat her any different than someone who's considered her sister. It is your wife's job to prove to your 14 year old that she was taken from an abusive mother so that she could experience what love from a real mother would be like. 14 is a delicate age, I wish you all the best.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	First your son is 4, now he's 5? Oh, well. You wife doesn't have a relationship with your 14 y/o daughter because she hasn't been around for that long. You just barely got custody of her yourself. Not to mention, a 5 year old is going to need a different level of attention than a 14 y/o. You need to take everything into consideration. What kind of attention do you expect her to show your daughter?|`|rx0ekB9Paa	i used to have a friend like this. its really sad, maybe try having her have girl dates, like the mum and daughter go to the mall for the day or something like that|`|mF0L5jMNaa	How much is enough?  What is equal?  WHo needs what?  Are your daughter's needs being met?  Is she ignored, abused?  Of course a 4 yr old requires more attention than a 14 yr old.  How about you?  Are you spending time with your daughter.  She needs your attention more than that of her stepmother.  You plan activities for the family that brings everyone together.  Parenthood is a learn as you go activity.|`|A7foKkGKaa	Im srry for that. <br>  <br>  Heres what u shoud do. u shoudl magically make the stuff in the house not work like the TV, microwave, Etc (anything that can provie entertainment. then say ur taking ur son out for some father son quality time and ur wife would interfiere.

Also if she carries on and thinks this will stop him from looking for attention from the wrong women instead he will be a complete pain in the butt boyfriend demanding attention and perfection and never letting go of his mother's pinny strings - meaning not only will he be emotionally under developed but also dependant on his mother.<br>  <br>  Your daughter needs more emotional support from her parents then a 4 year old does. Your wife may be having trouble knowing how to really deal with your daughter as she hasn't been there for this girl her whole life and she is not yet old enough to be treated as an adult but is to old to be treated as a child.

It's a feeling.<br>  <br>  "LOVE" is an action - a concious choice.<br>  <br>  Yes, you can be in love with someone you don't know everything about.  You can love someone without being "in love" with them.  You can be "in love" with someone you don't love.<br>  <br>  The feeling (in love) brings you togther.  The action (love) keeps you together.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	1.  I think there is a lust/infatuation stage (which is only temporary) that either moves or doesn't move into the love stage (which is permanent).  Most people get married while still in the lust/infatuation stage and lmany eave as soon as that feeling goes away.  They don't realize that real love is based on a lot more than just a feeling.<br>  <br>  2.  Yes.  You will never know everything about someone.  You can continually learn about them, but only God knows everything about them.|`|soFzO7C2aa	you can definately be in love with someone who doesnt know you well and you dont know them well. i fell in love with my boyfriend a couple days after i met him and the more i learned about him, the more in love i became. i feel as though love is the kind where you miss that person the minute they leave, how you can watch tv together and still have the time of your life, you think about the person all the time. lust is similar to love in that you want someone but that's all it is, you just want the person and typically there is a reason behind it such a sex or loneliness|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Yes,  you can be in love with someone that you don't know everything about. Example I don't know all my husband's ex girlfriends, sexual encounters, etc. I don't want to know. He doesn't know mine.<br>  <br>  Love is more than lust/infatuation. Love is being in a comfortable silence. Love is being able to spend time together and alone, love is trusting, love is accepting flaws and annoyances and all.<br>  <br>  Lust is well lust.<br>  <br>  Infatuation is can't get you off my mind, only want to be with you and spend every possible second with you (which wears off)
lIpjuMTHaa	Your loyalty is to your husband not your mother in law. You are in the wrong, however I can see where you are upset. Let your husband cool down and then talk about the fact that you dont agree with the decision to keep her away.|`|AA10986891	Me & Pete what kind of BS advice is that, women thinking like that is what traps them in abussive marriages. Good luck with yours.<br>  <br>  You are correct, what ever kind of problems he has with him mom, should not affect the relationship his son should have with his grandmother. I don't speak to my dad, big issues but I allow him to see my (only grandchild he has). I don't let my problems with him get in the way of his relationship with my son. Your mother in law has everyright to have a relationship with her grandson.|`|AA10719818	Wow, you are wrong.<br>  <br>  Do you not care that she is abusive to your husband?  Theres a reason hes in therapy, and a therapist doesn't tell you to detach from your own mom unless theres a good reason.<br>  <br>  I understand your son would be sad, but this is something your husband has to work through, and he needs your support.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I would say your wrong. You chose your husband not his mother. If he thinks his mother is abusive you need to back him up. Would you really want to take the chance of exposing your child to a woman who could become abusive to him?<br>  <br>  Find another sitter.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	I think you're basically correct<br>  Your husband can follow his therapist's advice without forcing your son away from his grandmother.|`|f6YsGOynaa	You are clearly in the wrong here.  Sorry, but if your mother in law is abusive, it's very likely that she's also abusive to your child, symptoms of which may not manifest themselves until much later in your child's life.  You may not even see it now.  <br>  <br>  Abusers often seem sweet as pie and very loving to those who are not the victims of abuse.  <br>  <br>  Please listen to your husband, and maybe even ask him what his mother did that was abusive.  You may save your child from that same abuse.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Well, the opinions here are 50/50 so i'm gonna go with a different advice. Sit down with your husb and mother in law. Ask them why they don't get along with each other, why is she like that with him. Tell them that a child should not be putting through this and for the sake of your son to try to get along with each other. Try to get to a understanding, that way you don't have to side neither of them.|`|Yby3loNEaa	you are right the doctor told him that he needed to band his mother not the whole family i kind of have the same problem, tell him the truth with out getting mad and say hey you had your grandma don't take your sons grandma away he loved her but you are not wrong goold luck|`|uI4Dspi4aa	If you work evenings, why is your husband not caring for his son?|`|UEcEAId5aa	If he divorces you, will your mother in law still be loyal to you? Probably not.<br>  <br>  If your mother in law decides she hates you, will your husband still want to be with you? From your description, probably.<br>  <br>  It's his family, not yours. You need to respect his wishes, and trust that he has reasons for feeling the way he does; after all, he's known his family his whole life. You haven't. If you can't trust your husband, respect his wishes, and be loyal to him, then your marriage probably has other problems. Or will shortly.
0ycoeVpZaa	just stay out of it. its kinda of a policy thing that she cant talk to u about the details of her personal life.|`|y0HwOMYcaa	I think that would be perfectly fine. If I was in the same position as you I would most likely talk to the teacher. She would probably be very happy that someone actually cared and took the time to talk her. Go for it!|`|Xu4x19y6aa	Well if you are worried about crossing a line, maybe just leave an anonymous greeting card (something to the effect that someone cares, cheer up - etc.....) and sign it "a friend".  If the personality difference continues, maybe drop a note to a counselor, she may have issues that need adult attention.  But it's nice your a good enough person to notice that about her.  Very kind of you.|`|ejosT3OVaa	Well worrying about someone else isn't wrong. If I had a teacher and we talked alot and what not and I noticed something different I'd probably ask too. Who knows maybe you would be the only one to notice and she really needed to talk to someone and didnt know how to just come out and talk ya know.|`|54vt2jXRaa	I don't think it would be wrong.  She would probably find it very sweet and be glad you care.|`|4cUVpuKvaa	yeah but act nice not nosy and do it wen u r alone
IdtzdpqGaa	First if you don't know how, then you probably should not be doing it. LOL
guvgG8tRaa	:) that's adorable. of course he does. i suggest you randomly call him cute. it will secretly make him really happy|`|AA11502346	It could very well mean that he likes you.

Obviously the only way to know is to ask him if he likes you, except what i dowheni think a guy likes me is i ask him about other girls or i use the question "if you could date anyone in our grade who would it be?" and it usually works but iftastet not your personality you could just ask him if he likes you and then tell him how you feel, or ask your friends to find out for you (discreetly). I think hedefiantlyy likes you so its worth a shot:)|`|T04D4Biwaa	sounds like he is interested. the cliche is great lol thats the way i am with girls. i Play hockey and football and the girls i go for are in like photography or art in lol. Go for it ! don't let things like that walk by, take advantage of it :)|`|VVH1KWaaaa	he likes you. to let him know you like him... wait that just answered that question. TELL HIM! why are girls so scared to tell a guy that she likes him?|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	i think he may like u..u should probably try to get to know him better and goes on some dates...and then you  will find out whether he just wants to be friends or he wants to go without u|`|AEJFCUOOaa	yes|`|yqzcIfwsaa	i dont think so|`|x8loZIvEaa	i think he likes u...maybe just be more flirty or talk to him about how u feel about him|`|KFvA7cJwaa	it could mean he likes you! :)|`|BIUfhqGdaa	i think he likes you, especially with the playing with your hair and grabing your hand part.i think you should maybe flirt a little like give him compliments, smile when he looks at you. and i think maybe you should ask him to get together with you after school sometime.girl! your lucky :)|`|0f5a3301ad7a4b142336064ee9173f5aaa	he could like you and he could be doing the same thing with a lot of other girls.  you should wait for him to tell you he likes you otherwise don't waste your time obsessing over one boy.|`|QW8z9iwZaa	it seems he likes you to try to get across you like him if he grabs ur hand grab it back maybe or maybe insist on sitting next to him and partnering with him ask if he could join the drama club ?|`|Rr3xJYRoaa	Well if he said you all would be a cute couple then you should ask him if he really does like you then if he does ask him if you should date!! =D its not that grate but it could work.|`|DVEuHN3maa	It seems like he likes you and is very keen to be close to you.<br>  <br>  You should grab the Pie while it is still hot :p|`|QNhNQyIraa	Well there is that saying that "Actions speak louder than words." I don't know of any friends who would just kick people out of the seat next to me, play with my hair, and grab my hand. Chances are good that he does have a crush on you. The best way to let him know, is maybe some flirting. You can also do rather subtle moves like he does, such as grabbing his hand and etc. But that is if you want to take the shy approach. If you are a person who doesn't mind asking the other person, see if he wants to go to the movies or something where you two can spend time alone. Good luck ^_^
fcf92f90cb9bace2ce8ea606d576dac3aa	well, atleast you both realize the problem lol.. thats the first step to fixing it... the second step is to PICK YOUR BATTLES!! fighting over everything or little things that dont matter creates unnecessary drama that ultimately ruins relationships... the third step is to JUST GET OVER IT. Who cares about being right so much? Its immature and more than that, its exxaauuussttinnnggg.. I am like that too but in my past relationship I just had I learned to just let it go and ignore it like it was never there lol... just tell him hes right even if hes not, and in your head call him an idiot lol thats what i do!! good luck!|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Ohh god, My husband is stubborn, hardheaded, controlling, short temper, and any worst thing possible you can think of and so AM I. To be honest, is really hard to make it work. Because of our personalities we've been having a lot of problems. I guess at the end we kind of just gave up on each other and now sometimes i just say I'm sorry and i don't mean it but makes him feel better and he does the same thing. Sometimes you have to be the bigger/better person but when my husb doesn't want to say "I'm sorry" i tell him that the last time i did it so it's his turn. lol|`|qcvjUgHzaa	If you both have already realized that this happens, good job! That's the first step right there. Now here's the second, the next time you two are getting into a fight, remind eachother "Now, wait a minute, remember what happens every time we do this?" And maybe you'll start to look at things in a whole other way!|`|LP0AmMAcaa	Someone has to give in or you could suggest that you take it in turns to give in and never go to bed on a row|`|rlQOjyhbaa	in order for things to work agreance an trust is a must set him down an as long as you can both come together an agree on things that's all that matters bein honest and truthful and sincere|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	one of you must give in if you love someone you are willing to sacrifice for them even if it means doing the things they like or letting them be right.|`|AA11785285	This is Marriage and Divorce, not the dating scene.<br>  <br>  And marriage is difference than dating, hon.  If you don't get along??? bail. simple|`|vyNlyfczaa	yea like me and my husband - it took us a while to learn how to live together. Every day is for us new challenge:D basically I learned to ignore him and he learned to ignore me (moods etc) and sometimes 'I let it go" and sometimes he does... I am not saying it is easy but I know it's possible:D<br>  I know it is wrong but most of the time when we fight about something - no one 'wins' we go sleep, not talking to each other and next day when we we up we pretend that nothing happened (if the fight was about something stupid) or we talk it over (then there is not that much emotions going on)
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	it's true...
GxSnVRAOaa	Tell him.  Tell him exactly what happened.  Be very careful not to accuse this boy of rape if you feel you didn't do anything to stop him- you don't want to ruin his life if he didn't force you into it.  If he did (you are saying he did, but if he very clearly did despite your protests) then you need to make sure he's brought to justice.  Either way, discuss it with your teacher/care giver as you'll need a support system.|`|yFBKkcqLaa	At the end of the day it is totally your decision. Im not sure what the age is for statutory rape where you are from but as you said you agreed to it. So maybe that is not a good idea. Why did you go through with it if you werent ready? Next time say NO mixed messages are not what you want for your relationship, and if he forces you again I think maybe you should not be with him an then you really need to go to the police<br>  Hope this helps you|`|RaeLHLHnaa	the truth is an option|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	As you trust him I would tell you to confide in him and get his prospective on this
fNm79bLCaa	Tell her she should tell him now,  or she could be alone wondering what could of been.
CqoTqEu6aa	if your happy that's all that matters. People might tell you your too busy because they couldn't handle your schedule . . .it is pretty insane. But if it will get you where you want to be and if your having fun then keep it up! YOUR happiness is whats really important.|`|Xu4x19y6aa	YES, OMG I got tired reading your schedule.  Girl, slow it down.  You need some time to JUST be you!!  Time to read, relax, hang out, do nothing, talk on the phone, etc........ Seriously sweetie, consider what things you LOVE versus what things you just "do" and trim your schedule a bit.  <br>  <br>  I'd slow it down just a bit, your so busy, you gotta be just about wore out. Plus you have your academics to concentrate on.|`|EoPZnFZlaa	If you don't think you're too busy; if you don't feel stressed about your schedule;  if none of your schoolwork or activities are suffering because of your schedule, I wouldn't worry about it.  We each have our own energy levels, and we are all different.  As long as you are happy, and well adjusted socially, I say go for the gusto!
cmEi3CVqaa	she's not blood related but technically she's family to you, it could put a bit of a strain on your family, which you don't really need. don't take the flirting personally, she's a 14 year old girl, it comes naturally to that age range bcoz they are just discovering all about boys and what its like to be in a relationship and they like to get noticed and comment and etc. my advice... don't go out with her at all. too complicated and too mcuh potential drama! maybe it's just a crush if shes good looking and has a nice personality, see how you feel in a few months time, maybe your feelings will go away for her. at the end of the day it's your desicision whether or not u go out with her but weigh up the pros and cons before you do anything that could have a huge negative impact on people and relationships. <br>  <br>  hope it helps x (:
tu9hcqFbaa	Sounds like they are up to no good. Stay away, Ive heard it many times "there are better and more fish in the sea" They sound like bad new and from just reading what you posted they might being trying to make you jelous and want to but they probably just want to use you and then they wil Harrass you again...My suggesstion is to ignore them, Im mean you can talk to them but reject them and find yourself a new and awesome man.|`|uhRKCb9kaa	maybe its their style.give them a chance in nice way or give me,<br>  "coolguy_198km@yahoo.com"|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	they r losers<br>  <br>  run away!|`|xG04jzOEaa	These guys...and other girls, seem ridiculously immature and like a bunch of drama queens.

OrFYRg27aa	Okay so there is a definite difference. I would prefer to be called beautiful. Beautiful is used to describe someone that you really care about who you think is too good for you or insanely pretty and you can't help but look at. Hot has more of a sexual meaning. When a guy calls me hot I kind of see it as them picturing me in bed. Honestly, do you respect someone who's beautiful more or someone who's hot. It's all a matter of respect and intentions. Beautiful= lots of respect, intent for a relationship. Hot= not so much respect, intent for some action. <3 Cara|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	beautiful|`|kWjy7uzAaa	I personally like to tell girls , hey you don't look half that bad today, I think that's really romantic and it keeps them on their feet. Some times I like to tell girls that their left arm is shorter than their right arm and its cute to see them freak about it.|`|ZyfilGjFaa	if he calls u beautiful that means that he is like the deep kind of guy and that he doesn't care all about looks he cares about the inside..... but if he calls u hot then he is just trying to get with u.... but hot is a really good comment because that means the u r like really pretty.... i would prefer getting called hot|`|DBh8yfySaa	im a guy nd wen i say beautiful i mean it like u have nice hair, eyes smile and other facial features, but hot means a girls beautiful and has a great body.|`|uFyHVPyyaa	Of course there is a difference, I would rather be called beautiful because it means more to me than hot... btw guys who say you're hot mostly don't care about  who you are under the skin!|`|2Fdytg8Laa	with hot your kinda showing off but with beautiful its more of a cherished thing.. i would definitely rather be called beautiful because im tired of guys trying to act cool and say im hot<br>  <br>  ha, thats just me.<br>  <br>  hope this helped :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  Emma?|`|io7ppQLuaa	i want to be called beautiful because i am hot means to me that you're half clothed and beautiful means you can be beautiful and still be fully clothed.
KD8vYoH6aa	just say:<br>  <br>  "Hey, how are you doing?? I kinda like you, wanna go out?"<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  "Hi, umm, wanna go out??"|`|wc7WCTfGaa	start talking about relashionships first<br>  then tell her u like this girl and uve liked her 4 a long time already and that she knows her<br>  then she will obviously be like who is it<br>  and u ........ its u <br>  and then of course ask her ou<br>  it happened to my friend i think its really cutehow the guy did that|`|kKG3C103aa	Talk to her about relationships to get her started,<br>  Then tell her you've liked this girl for 2 years, and u dont know wot to say to her. Then she'll suggest something. Then pause for 2-3 seconds. Then do wot she said :)<br>  In other words: Ask her out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck =D|`|payeGTkaaa	Anything.<br>  Ask her out.<br>  DUH.|`|15W5tR6naa	First off do not tell her your feelings unless you want to freak her out. Go up to her and be like hey what's up I have seen you around school and have some classes with you. Then tell a joke something funny but not lame like if i didnt know any better i would say you were stalking me. Make sure u say it in a sarcastic voice or it is all ruined. Then talk to her  in between classes and get to know her better. Do not be clingy and ask for hugs all the time and beg for her phone number. Once you really know her say hey can i get your phone number to call or text you later. Then from then on be her friend until it moves on or gets some where intristing|`|IItEA7WHaa	ok here's what you do<br>  1. Make sure she likes you<br>  2. Do something or say somthing funny<br>  3. Become a friend (but not a girlfriend in her eyes)<br>  4. DON'T BE CREEPY!<br>  5. Get her email (from her not a friend or hers)<br>  6. IM chat with her<br>  7. Ask her out|`|gJfCiyrSaa	tell her your deepest feelings in excruciating detail.|`|V5jB8B70aa	Just go up to her and say "I like you".

OtTE3UJ1aa	It's your decision, not anyone else's, go with your heart, and which one isn't just a phase, Guy 4 obviously likes you, and you obviously have him as a preferred choice, as if you've already made your mind up, because he's separated by an "OR". But Guy 4, sounds like he's interested in you, and probably likes your company, so in my view go for guy 4, but it's your decision, don't feel pressurized. =) Good Luck.|`|xU36GJk2aa	Well i never liked 1 guy before so no<br>  <br>  guy 4 defo|`|WK8MZlLdaa	pick one.|`|F0sr7Tpcaa	ive been there( so many times )<br>  one time i think i actually liked maybe 6 or 7 guys at time.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Make her comfortable with comedy - humor is statistically the most attractive quality . For , it's probably not a good time to kiss that girl when you're watching a movie where someone is being killed. Use a nice, romantic spot. Who doesn't like a sunset, an empty grassy meadow under the stars, a deck on a lake at night,on the beach, a paddle boat at a friends pond at night, a private camp fire... <br>  Hold her hands. If you hold her hand, she should get the hint that you like her. Caution though, she will like it. But if she doesn't seem to like it, resume what you were. <br>  Stare into her eyes and move gently closer to her. Some say if a girl wants to kiss you, then she : ask! The entire point of asking her is to show her that you respect her as a person. You show her that you respect her opinion, maybe even more than your own: you make sure that she wants to kiss, instead not a line, it's the way: "Awww!" <br>  Put your hand on her cheek. <br>  Go for it! Lean in for the kiss. Try a peck for your first kiss, then move on to longer, more passionate kisses when you're both ready. <br>  Use the other hand to stroke her hair or neck. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] TipsSome girls don't want to "make out" for the first kiss, but some do. Try a quick peck on the lips, then move in for more, if she pulls away, DO NOT try to kiss her more. If you forget this tip, don't become frustrated with her reaction. Simply back away and apologize like you mean it. <br>  Kissing during an on screen kiss during a movie can sometimes be a cheesy idea. Try doing it when you feel most in love. <br>  It is probably best done in a private place, so that you two feel more comfortable. <br>  Offering to do it in a bed may make people uncomfortable, and they may feel pressured. Often it doesn't mean that you are going to have sex, but it certainly increases temptation to do so. <br>  You can put on some music to get her in the mood. <br>  You could try scented candles, but they can be a dangerous if you forget about them. <br>  Discussing what you and your partner like and dislike helps a lot when heading towards kissing. <br>  Make sure your breath smells alright -- use mints or gum if you need to. (Note: sometimes the mints or gum may not be enough. In that case, try using a little peroxide before you brush -- don't forget your tongue. And make sure to floss regularly. Most of the time, these steps can eliminate the need for gum or mints.) <br>  If you have braces, make sure they're clean. <br>  Talk to her while kissing each other. Girls like it if you whisper nice things while kissing them. For example you can say something like: "You're beautiful" or "I dreamed of kissing you ever since I saw you the first time." <br>  Make sure she is ready for the feelings you two will have for each other knowing that you kissed. <br>  If this is your first kiss try kissing them on the cheek first. <br>  Occupy your hands, don't stand with your hands by your sides.Try putting them on her/his hips at first or gently holding her face this can be very passionate. Avoid her bottom and breasts, unless you are very very sure that's what she wants and never in public. <br>  Shave your face before you go on the date. Most girls don't like the prickly feeling when you kiss them, unless she's one of those girls that love the facial hair. Most likely you don't know her well enough if you haven't even kissed, so be safe and shave your face. <br>  If it's cold outside, that is a great opportunity because then you have an excuse to hold her close to you. While you are holding her, be face to face with her and talk to her while your faces are kind of close to each other. That makes a great opportunity to kiss her, make sure she's not in the middle of a sentence though. That's just plain rude.|`|Vd0PEtdWaa	Well first, you should only go 90% into the kiss, let her come the other 10% percent, if you go all 100% she might freak out, or she might not want the kiss, and that's just effing awkward. Second, wet your lips, slide your tongue over them so they are nice and moist, but don't let her see, or she might get grossed out. As she comes toward you, part them slightly so it's easy for the kiss to progress into a full on making out session, and eventually sexual intercourse.

IuJjYz6gaa	First off, where the heck is living to get 3 grand a month for BAH?<br>  <br>  Call IG.<br>  <br>  He is supposed to be giving you a portion of that BAH.  He legally has to, if he is not, he owes you back pay.  You need to contact IG immediately.<br>  <br>  If you are still married you HAVE to file your taxes as such.  Either jointly or separate, but you have to file as married.  If he filed as joint and the IRS now says you owe, you can dispute it.<br>  <br>  It doesn't make sense that you owe on medical bills.  You are still married, you still have access to Tricare Prime, which means that you still can receive medical care at no cost to you.<br>  <br>  And you still can get free counseling through military one source. <br>  <br>  You are STILL married.  You are STILL a military dependent, and you STILL have access to all of the benefits that the military offiers spouses.  Take advantage of them.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	I would try to contact a lawyer for your legal rights..I would seek some outside help with authorities and see what can be done..|`|GLKD89wnaa	Are you mad 'cause he cheated. If he was abusing you, you should of called 911 and reported. As long as he is paying alimony than let him get the BH. Also, if you can to his command just ask for a support they will make sure you been taking care off.|`|QstEk6PZaa	Cops. They will discharge his *** for this I am sure.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	tell him if he's single you would like to get to know him better...
AA11406882	Yes you have done the right thing by deleting all contact. There is always facebook if he wants to get in touch.. I've been in the same position before and it can hurt like hell, but you have to do this..otherwise you will keep contacting him and hurting yourself even more> keep strong|`|SrSRGRQWaa	I think you have done the right thing!!<br>  <br>  You need to get over him and having frequent contact with him will not help this.<br>  <br>  If it was meant to be you would have found a way to be together.|`|4IQqkEdGaa	You should move on if it was the real thing you would have found a way to make it work|`|0tL4zgTPaa	just talk to him again|`|CbRr3upaaa	Hard question to answer. Im the only person that will give you any sort of real advice, trust me. You only live once, figure out whats more important your wants or needs, or maybe you want and need him. Either way ask yourself if you want it to work.|`|SPbxA8QEaa	Keep the contact going. Even if you just have to be friends with him and nothing more. He changed your life for the better and made you so happy. Don't let him go, completely. Don't linger on him for too long, either. Follow your heart, no matter how cliche that sounds. If you're not sure that everything is over with him, then don't let him go. If you think he's not going to fight for you or try for you, then let him go. It's a very complex decision you have to make. I wish you luck.|`|uhRKCb9kaa	you shouldn't be depressed for this metter as the relationships like this are actually have no base, and this is the common end of this kind of relationship, it was not a mistake to delete the contacts i would say because if he is not intrested then what you have to do with him,forget him and start a new life,

Personally, I'd love it if a girl liked me even if she was a pu$$y but of course I'm some asian who needs plastic surgery, consistently mistaken to be gay, told to smell like poo (joke! I shower a lot), and have too much dandruff. But, you're right, you're problem is bigger.<br>  <br>  Just joking. Not about the asian bit but ... anyway just ask him. The worst he can say is no. And if he does its not like he's gonna be embarrassed around you. You might be but us guys don't feel embarrassed if a girl ask us out, but us rejecting her.<br>  <br>  If you can't ask a mate.

Smiles a lot <br>  4. Makes a lot of stupid comments<br>  5. Occasional awkward silences<br>  6. Teases you but in a friendly way<br>  7.

If he says yes, its prettyy  damn  obvious.|`|bbUYbEGUaa	This is always a hard question to answer... Depending on how old you guys are.... You can tell if he likes you if he kinda ignores you and is to shy to talk to you because he doesn't know what to say. That kinda goes for all ages but if you guys are like 12 or younger then i would look for things that he is doing different and look for differences in the way he is acting around you.|`|8mLuWhzhaa	first you should see if he stares at you alot kinda dreamyish if he laughs at things you say that are suppoused to be funny and calls you or follows you he likes you.And how he might ask your best friend are you around he ALOT cause he might be standing at you BUT if he looks at your friend alone dreamyish he likes ur friend|`|CdYvOnZqaa	well im in a situation simualr to this but i cant tlk to him cuz im tooooo shy.. but maybe if u ask a real good friend to ask him if he likes u then u will be fine.. just make sure u tell ur friend not to tell him u asked b/c then u guys wont tlk that much after he knows u asked..|`|GYiQEwIvaa	Well if he looks at you a lot and he laughs at whatever you say he probably likes you.|`|AA11107100	what grade are we talking here?
kCbJ89nXaa	Your husband is fighting a spiritual battle.  The fact that he  goes for months without weakening means he is trying to fight this urge.  Help him find someone who can counsel him spiritually to recognized the battle he's in and give him techniques to win.  He's not a bad man, he's just under siege.|`|Yby3loNEaa	sorry to here that but, porn is one thing but that is wrong and no i would not let my child be around him weather he was the father or not!!!!! the reason for that is, you have to look for that, meaning he was trying to look at it, it wasn't like it popped up i'm sorry i was raped when i was little you never know and 9 out of 10 times the vic new the abuser, i wouldn't want to worry good luck on all of that|`|U1WUNCwLaa	is this something you know he regularly looks at? you know it could be something he just accidently clicked on and he could have been as disgusted as you...just watch what he does, if he keeps going back to thoes types of sites then be careful but dont jump to conclusions right away.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Umm, call the police and get yourself and your children out of there. That is messed up!|`|UXcICmLNaa	He crossed the line. This is serious. Anyone that gets aroused by looking at naked children and child porn has serious sexual issues that is not to be taken lightly. It may be fantasy now but fantasies often times lead to reality. <br>  <br>  I would run from him and keep the kids from him. Which means you will have to prove to the state that he has looked at kiddie porn.<br>  <br>  EDIT: why so many thumbs down on these answers?|`|wCTq9p2Uaa	I would ask him what is more important between you and kids or the porn.If he says porn, then it sounds like you and the kids are not important to him. If he says you and the kids, then he needs to put a stop to the porn. Good Luck!|`|wZtDLjO8aa	I don't blame you at all.... I think that crosses the line when it come to porn. That is just plain evil.. The making or that type of porn and the viewing of it. Do not leave your children alone with this man, father or not.<br>  <br>  I think we're getting thumbs down, because the splitting of the family...|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I'm sorry to say this and I am sorry you are going through this, but save those web pages on the computer with some sort of hard copy and leave him. Leave him now. If he fights you for custody you have some proof of what he has been up to.<br>  <br>  Good luck
cM5ctohjaa	I'm in the same situation but I'm the boy and idk what to do either.  Chances are hes just as afraid as you, its a lot harder on the boy cause we always have to make the first move.  Idk i would need some more details but i say tell him.  I'm debating on whether or not to tell my girl, but from a boys perspective I'd try it out.|`|BZIscz2Qaa	Yes, do it.  I'm assuming u would know if he's in a relationship or not, and since u guys r 18 and 19, u guys could meet up again sometime (depending on how far away he is).|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Whoa, nice love story :)<br>  <br>  I would give it a shot, if you've really known each other for that long then he won't reject you badly. It won't hurt, trust me.<br>  <br>  But if he feels the same way then you have something movies are made of.|`|NBErRe8Saa	tell him how you feel being assertive is attractive, and some of the best loving relationships come out of friendship, never the other way around.|`|mUfStFbxaa	yes|`|sBJtxJG9aa	go for it...<br>  cute<3|`|5FNxzZleaa	come up with something to say jokingly and see what he says back. if hes in agreence then go along with it. but i would say its a no go since he is far away. lon distance relationships DO NOT WORK. and its been 12 years. how do you know your still gunna like who he really is?  and just being a guy, i think that his sweet talk like you were his favorite thing growing up, i think hes just saying that. i know the signs, i think he likes you but your not the only one he likes........|`|pa3no76eaa	Well if you haven't talked to this guy in person since you were seven.. he could have made some serious changes. Trust me, I had a friend who was a great guy then he came back a year later and he was wearing all these goth clothes and was swearing and smoking. So you don't want to do anything til you've been around him in person for a while.|`|W20KslFzaa	You're old enough to go see him if you want to.  So do that, go and visit him, or vice versa.  See how you feel when you're face to face again.  <br>  <br>  If that spark is still there, then go with it.  If not, then there's no need to tell him.|`|Rw0FzdNWaa	how far apart are you guy? if you were together would it be possible to see each other regularly? Does he talk about other girls? Personally if I had a females friend tell me she wanted to go out wiht me, I'd be flattered. And then make sure it was not a dream. Good luck to you!|`|fPwgtACiaa	Hey I think you should go for it because if he does say no then you could still be friends if ure so close. Good luck|`|22Oy1qp0aa	It really seems like he likes you, go for it.|`|365d70b021fb625020b0fa8e63533e37aa	he moved away <br>  move on|`|VVH1KWaaaa	dear lord hay-sus, why can't girls tell guys they like them. if you want him to know, guess what... TELL HIM!|`|a01OSTTRaa	Look, you are 19. What's the rush? Based on what you said and how you said it, I would recommend you keep a friendly relationship with him, but drop the pretenses associated with dating him. All you will do is indulge in your puppy love of someone you don't know in person.<br>  <br>  I suggest you date around and get to know what you like and don't like in a person (in person no less). If you happen to run across him again, consider dating him if you feel it is worth your time.<br>  <br>  Try not to be insecure about the situation. Have fun while you are young. No one cares what your life ends up doing to you, except you, so make sure you give yourself lots of options and experience before you dive in and ask him to be a boyfriend. He is faced with the same situation and a young relationship often leads to dissapointment as a result of dating immaturity. Better to date around and dump a few guys you don't know so well than to ruin something that could be nice later in life.|`|zLs5Y7RAaa	just tell him that you have feeelings for him,,,, but be like sooo i have something to tell you. you just have to tell him the truth,,, dont be afraid to hide it.|`|Z86fL3ntaa	well firt joke around with him like .... if ur having a conversation be like u know you like me then throw an lol at the end or you can take a more serious approach and ask hey well ive felt this way about you and i wanted to know how u felt about me,...
YArPv9WFaa	Im a woman and i can tell you to tell them both to fu*k off. really wrong, dont bother, i mean do you really want a relationship with both of them, if she respected you in the slightest way she wouldnt go past the boundaries, therefore she truly doesnt care, SAME goes for him. You dont need him doing this again in the future, it is in your best interest to let them both go and move on to other ppl.
YArPv9WFaa	dont even mention it,tell her after, yes it will affect what she thinks. <br>  You say she has been with other guys then she probably knows how to ride well, so first let her be on top, she will be better at controlling. Then try being on top of her but if it doesnt go well, dont be shy just try doggy position im sure that will save the day, thats like the finishing move okay. Hey just dont be shy, really try to relax thats the key. Worry about her scent, her neck, hold her hands while one is on top of the other. carress her body with your hands. Its really simple the whole idea is to do what feels erotic, if you have an urge to lightly feel her somewhere then dont think about it just do it. Talking while in intamacy is not okay, dont do that okay? Maybe a few words like "this feels good" "your so tender/soft" "your hair smells so good" "let me caress your skin" little things like that okay. You can glare at her but i she closes your eyes that means dont glare too much.....key KEEP CALM. Maybe music will help set the mood. Good luck.|`|G33JkhLBaa	i think that it's GREAT that you are a virgin. However if you really want to take it to that step just make sure that you love her enough to stay with her|`|qtt7gy9Maa	I wouldnt tell her anything unless she asks.  Dont worry about it too much.  Just wear protection and take it easy.  If you worry too much you will be noticeable nervous, *** too early and look ridiculous.  If you love her, no matter what, you're going to enjoy it and as a result so will she.
0LXVSFEGaa	Platonic relationships are fine, although I must admit that I prefer Socratic relationships.|`|2Eep9WqZaa	Yes I believe in Platonic relationships since strictly speaking it is a relationship that is devoid of sensual feeling and is not limited to a relationship of the opposite sexes. The fact that he flirts may indicate that this is not a Platonic relationship on his part - but not knowing the person it is impossible to make that judgment. I suggest you enjoy the friendship and let it go where it may.
QS3PtXg8aa	tell him. it will hurt loads,trust me it will,it can feel like your dying inside,but only time can truly heal thw wound of a broken heart. it will eventually get better. plus  who needs a boy like that,he doesnt ssem that nice. but trust me,it will get better,best of wishes X|`|WK8MZlLdaa	move on. <br>  <br>  hes left you. Im sorry.|`|ON84EQaBaa	you need to find something to do other than let him work on you like this! don't let him back in your life, if he accused you of cheating & messing around on him it's more than likely he's the cheater.  if he has hurt you, it gonna be hard to really trust him with your feelings. life is to short to be crying over him, it's hard to let go but I really think you do need to move on with your life. There are some nice guys out there, just give it a little time MR. RIGHT will come into your life and turn your tears into a big smile! good luck
46WGsk1oaa	well... umm.... his friends probably have a negative influence on him. he gives in and then 2 days later he realizes that its not true. and it just keeps happening. it happens alot. dont worry about it. if anything talk to him about it. i hope i was some help and good luck.|`|SKaLskpAaa	obviously he feels ashamed of you..think about it..if its just you two alone, he's normal and nice.But when he's with his friends he doesnt even look your way.. GIRL..i think you shud just move on cuz he aint worth it..:)|`|0f5a3301ad7a4b142336064ee9173f5aaa	he's an idiot and immature.  don't waste your time because ultimately his friends will be making all of his decisions for him.  you want someone who can think for himself.|`|F8wzcKntaa	Not sure, talk to him about it. Maybe he's not feeling you the way you thought.|`|GKSlikxJaa	because he is having a secret love with you or a secret friendship with you and he is all up into you then he is up all into his friends that because he loves you more than hes friends and he thinks he is giving you more attention then he is giving his friends<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this is the answer !|`|8B6JgJoraa	That depends. If your not very supportive of him hanging out with his friends then he avoids you because he doesnt want to hear you gripe about it or he does things that you wouldnt aprove of, and he's ashamed to face you.|`|WpqfQOTJaa	Have you ever thought that not everything he does is a huge deal? You women are the reason people kill themselves.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	cuz his boys are getting him sandwiches from somewhere else
pKzH1cFHaa	Get over him. Stay away from him. Do not talk to him. Do not have any contact with him. Your parents are right.

JPkgKCNtaa	hm well you dont really have to talk to him. Just say little things if you see him on the bus just say hey whats up.

Fyx3gS1Kaa	your bf's words are not the law.<br>  you are still you and need to do what you want.<br>  my bf LOVES my hair down.<br>  i never wear it down, i've always worn it up.<br>  but we've still been together for 2 years.<br>  goes to show it doesnt matter how your hair is i guess.|`|cQb2vqDcaa	Damn, are you 14 or something?  It's your hair, do what you want with it.  If you want to wear it down, wear it down, if not, don't feel guilty.  Sure you want to look nice for him, but why should you wear it down ALL the time just because he likes it?|`|SmHaeishaa	You should wear your hair how You want it. Dont let anyone ever tell you what to do. Not even your boyfriend.|`|rN0b4jWHaa	No, he just meant it as a compliment that he likes your hair down, that doesn't mean by putting it up it makes u unattractive, don't take it to heart im sure he didn't mean it that way at all.|`|RIRa9hUjaa	It's  your hair. wear it the way YOU like it.
zucuC8bzaa	It sounds like you have a barrier up. What ever happened between you and your ex it hurt you bad and you don't want to let anybody else in just in-case they do the same. It does sound like you are truly over your ex and that's the first step i know its hard but you really need to start enjoying male company again! and i know you are probably wondering how well the next time  guy ask you out go on the date but instead of thinking where can you see the relationship going see him as a friend and just enjoy each others company there is no rush to meet the next guy or to settle down that puts to much pressure on a first date so relax and enjoy.<br>  <br>  Ps- you are still young your only 25 stop threatening about the future and enjoy the here and now.|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Give it time. Take time for yourself. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way. Dating is getting to know someone more intimately than just a friendship. You don't have to hunker down with them. So going on a date and freaking out is because you think it could  become something and you don't want it to be because you feel like you are opening yourself up to hurt. Just date people and have fun with life. You don't have to marry them or anything do you? No, so go and have some fun and try to recover from your painful feelings. The pain is numb but you don't want more pain to come. That is your issue it seems. I felt that way for a while after my wife left me because she didn't love me anymore. It sucked really bad.<br>  <br>  Enjoy life and have a good time you will be fine. ;)|`|pGP2VnBKaa	hes not into you free yourself to be with someone who is into you that's what its about they say they`ll call visit and you`ll go out then ignore you so just proves they dont want to be with you,<br>  <br>  if they do they will call visit not ignore you, you should be the priority when your into a partner you want to be with them as much as possible.
IZ29Vtveaa	seems like you have already made your choice no matter what we tell you to do. ....why don't you dump the deuce bag & date me instead coz am 100 & 1% honest!|`|MgDpCiB6aa	You deserve someone that will treat you better than that. I know you are down when he is not with you but you will get over that. He isn't worth it. Move on to someone better.|`|0YQutgiGaa	if i were you, i would move on. he doesnt seem very trustworthy and you could find someone who will treat you much better :)|`|DzNyOIZpaa	wow.....girls have problems, i guese know i know how my girlfriend thinks thank you|`|RGEkCsOuaa	if you really really care about him and believe he feels the same about you then continue<br>  but from what you;re saying, this guy seems to be a playerr and i think you should move on. You can definently do better!|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	He's not worth your effort or time. Some guys just have yet to grow up. They tell girls what they know she wants to hear, whether it's true or not. They don't think about how much they're hurting her. It's okay to cry, it's nothing to be ashamed of. You said you've already given him multiple chances and none of them worked out...this relationship just isn't going to work until when or if he can grow up and prove himself to you. Don't let it get to you so much. Spend time away from him. Don't have contact with him in any way for a while. You both need time to get over this. Just spend time with your friends and family and do things you enjoy doing. You don't need him in your life. It hurts now and it's hard to imagine that it will ever get better, but I promise it will. If it was meant to be, it will find a way. But you need time away from each other to gather your thoughts so you can both figure out what you want for good. Good luck!|`|AN9PdKmgaa	how sad you need a boyfriend to keep you going thru the day! move on he clearly is a player and you are just being used.|`|I4sNxuYqaa	no. sounds like hes used up his chance.<br>  <br>  answer mine please..?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au0kOJbVKwF_WkS0D8Y22ljsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309144514AARoKnu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|gWlmU1KJaa	fool you once shame on him<br>  <br>  fool you twice, a fool cant get fooled again!<br>  <br>  or is it shame on you<br>  <br>  damn you bush!|`|8TLEjhqaaa	i went through something very similar.<br>  seriously,<br>  is he everything you ever wanted?<br>  in your dreams did he hurt you the same way?<br>  did he make you cry?<br>  i doubt it.<br>  that's how i thought<br>  and that is what helped me get out of that "relationship".<br>  it's a circle and it's never going to end.<br>  trust me on that.<br>  he says he loves you and likes you, but it's not true.<br>  it's hard, i know<br>  but trust me, once you get out<br>  you immediately have so much more time on your hands<br>  and feel relieved.<br>  i thought i wasn't going to be able to live,<br>  but now i'm so much happier than i was ever with him.<br>  there's so much more out there.<br>  <br>  find out what you really want<br>  and don't compromise.<br>  <br>  it really is greener in the other side.<br>  :).<br>  <br>  lots of luck.|`|AA12217548	I was with a guy for four years we just broke up in november.

(i mean i did love him...so ill always have a thought or two in the back of my mind about him) but now that i have moved on i have an amazing boyfriend who treats me like im the most amazing person in the world and he is just amazing to me. so really you should move on because theres always something better behind the corner :]]<br>  <br>  PS i know its going to be hard to get over him, its just the best thing to do. hope this helps and good luck :]|`|cggkcAC5aa	strrike one and strike 2. then one more time and it should be OVER<br>  =]<br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309144913AAzhNXV">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|tIfo0GVqaa	guys are bastards when you are so good to them.**** him.use him.dump him.i know its love, but its not love if he treats you lik ethis.he doesnt care for you.he already moved on to another girl after you guys broke up.sad thing is he knows youll always be there n he knows how you feel.its a viscious circle.
lBe3zws1aa	so first of all yes guys are confusing <br>  there are accutally so CONFUSING<br>  i am sort of in a situation like yours ... accutally not really <br>  but yeah i told my guy friend i had a crush on him and at first he didnt say anything but he told my friend he didnt feel the same i know it sucks .. but we are still great friends but i feel like were even closer now ..and my gut tells me he likes me ..like you know how sometimes you can just tell <br>  <br>  anyways this is about you ok so i honestly think this guy likes you because of the whole note thing "Joe likes you" and because he talks to you and tries to sit near you and stuff and i think hes trying to make you jealous by stating that he was going to ask out another also .. are you super pretty because sometimes guys get scared and just end up asking another girl who isnt as attractive .. but i think you should confront this Joe guy and be like hey so do you like me or not .. and not just play games because if you dont ..you might end up loosing him too :S<br>  GOOD LUCK
3cn3q2Rbaa	I don't think she'd ban you from dating him for that. She may not approve, but I doubt she'll say flat-out no. If she likes the guy, she'll probably be okay with it.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Pfft, date him
MWjNp6y3aa	I have a good one but I haven't field tested it yet. I am pretty sure it would get a smack out of it though. I mainly think it's hilarious and want to see what kind of response I get out of it.<br>  <br>  I want to take you to the top of the world....that's what I call the tip of my penis. haha...just joking...but seriously how are you doing? <br>  <br>  Then just start talking from there while all the time she is thinking about the penis being the greatest thing ever and wondering what it really looks like. <br>  <br>  Otherwise I pretty much think pickup lines suck.
91e9695f022eaa142b297e5f77df3a74aa	Im really sorry to say this but it sounds like this girl is just messing with you. She is dropping you and then picking you up when she feels like it because she knows you like her and so she knows that she can treat you like crap and get away with it. She is attention seeking to be honest. You need to move on im afraid, there are plenty more girls out there and you need to prove that you′re not needy. Please stop texting her and apologising. You have no reason to apologise, you have done nothing wrong and she is being very rude to you by ignoring you etc. She is not the type of girl you want to go out with. I know it may seem like she is everything to you at the moment and you are really confused that she is doing this to you but i promise you, you will find someone else. Someone who deserves you!!<br>  Hope this helps x|`|NTC6g8hYaa	aww sweety, yah you need help. And so does this chick. See here's her problem. You asking her out, threw her off her game. Now shes confused and doesnt know what to do so shes acting like a total biyotch and saying these things becuase you confused her and made her mad. What you need to do is:<br>  A) pay a visit to here one day and talk to her!DONT TEXT! thats shows your not considerate and youll never know if shell repply. So you need to talk to her and smooth things out, ask her why shes been this way and if you asking her out made her uncomfortable or hate you.<br>  B) reassure her that being freinds is fine as long as she stops treating you the way shes been treating you lately.<br>  C) repeat B<br>  D) dont let things become out of hand or weird. TALK TALK TALK TALK to her, let her know how you feel.<br>  You need to put away the phone and actually talk. Sorry if im sounding rude its just that shes not gonna get it until you talk. Shes confused and biyotchy right now so this has to happen. And if she continues, let her go man, you dont need that in your life. Move on and find someone new!<br>  Good luck :)

Then mention a movie, play, show, or whatever that you would like to go see.  Then mention that you don't want to go alone/can't go alone/would like to share it with someone or whatever fits your personality.  Then you just let it hang.  Chances are, that if he likes you at all, he will offer to take/go with you.
Br9PJH8Naa	I am just like you...but 13. I understand everything about your parents, mine are divorced. My mom is constantly yelling at me that I can't do anything right. She even asked me why I am here. "Are you here to make my life more difficult". There are times when I just want to break down and cry. I am failing school...every subject. I feel that there is nothing that I can do to help myself. If I were you, I wouldn't want to speak to my parents either, and from what I see, you can't talk to your best friend because you feel that you are to blame for her problem. The one thing I can say you can do is try self-methods of helping yourself. Try writing everything down that is wrong in your life and then burning it. Then write down everything that you are good at, and everything that makes you good and tape it on YOUR mirror. When you get home from school, go to YOUR room and block out anyone who might disturb you. That will keep all distractions away and no one will be there to criticize what you are doing wrong. Once you are finished with that, do what you like to do... (watch your fave movie and eat ice cream or something). Since you can't talk to a family member, talk to a different friend. It is NOT your fault she is ill. You can control it, which is a good thing. She can't. Your friend probably developed that on her own, so don't feel that It is you to blame. BTW Good job on your "A". You can't possibly do better than that =) <br>  <br>  -Katrina|`|mkA615Ataa	your parents can't stop you going to the doctor, I strongly suggest you talk to your tutor as he/she may be able to help you make arrangements to go in school time if you don't want your parents to know, also if you ask they don't tell your parents, they have to respect that. Your doctor can then recommend other services like councilling or support agencies that can help you with anything.|`|oN5NEruGaa	i once had a friend who had anorexia but in year 10 actually died because he had it from that day people blamed me it was horrible but rest assured he is in a better place but the only thing you have through your whole life is your family and your friends so yeah coursework is important but when you think of it whats more important you work or friends ?|`|twWQwax9aa	Is your sister the oldest? If so it is quite frequent for parents to have more photos of the first child simply because they didn't have other children to look after at that time. <br>  <br>  It is hard to grow up in someone's shadow, especially if you are constantly being compared to them and being found lacking. Whether your parents get a divorce or not it will not be your fault. You have to put yourself first at the moment to catch up with your coursework, pass your exams and either go to college or get a good job. Make your coursework and revision your focus. Maybe ask a teacher for help to explain what you are supposed to be doing. They want you to do well!<br>  <br>  As to your friend. It is not your fault that she has anorexia as you don't get it just from seeing someone else not eat. She must have a lot of issues of her own and, not to be insulting, I don't think that you are qualified to be the one supporting you. This would be a lot of pressure on you even without your own problems. She needs to see a counsellor or a doctor. <br>  <br>  When all your problems happen at once try to focus on the stuff you can control, like doing your coursework, and not on what you can't control, like how people treat you. <br>  <br>  Remember - It isn't your responsibility to make your parents happy, they are adults, you should try to make your life better first. Start with that and you may find that it becomes easier to deal with. <br>  <br>  Don't lose your belief in your self - you can do anything you put your mind to. The only thing holding you back is you!<br>  <br>  I think that you need someone to talk to as it isn't healthy to bottle this stuff up inside you. <br>  <br>  xxx<br>  xx<br>  x|`|YTasscmKaa	Is there a school counselor at your school?

If it's just lust, then you won't think about the long term.|`|d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	Lust is an instantaneous feeling of desire and sexual heat. You want the other person physically without any care for who they are or what they feel. It usually burns hot and bright but fizzles out fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  Love is a deeper, emotional connection to someone where you feel like you're whole body is on fire and is going to explode if you're not near them, talking to them. It has a little to do with sex as well but love is more about the person themselves rather than their body. It's wanting to be close to someone because of who they are and the way they make you feel. Love is that delicious slow burn in the pit of your stomach when you realise you'll be seeing them soon, or when you answer the phone and it's unexpectedly them. Love doesn't burn as quickly as lust and you more often than not find that real love isn't like a bonfire, it's slow and smouldering and takes time and care to stay alight. <br>  If you ask me which is better, I'd defintely go with love.|`|d8e14eb5c12aa575cfd4bf1e19fcf8f2aa	Love is when you cant stop thinking about them and even if a really gut guy/gal walks up to you, you dont think of it as a big deal becasue you are in love with somebody else.

Therefore you do not truly care about the person you are in lust with.|`|mVgY2I2Zaa	tough one.

n7uF90t3aa	Are you sure he's not wearing the cologne?  It sounds to me like he just wants to smell good for his girlfriend. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend used to smell really good all the time.  When I asked him about it, he said that it was nothing, just deoderant.  Then after he moved in I found like 3 different bottles of cologne in our medicine cabinet.  I guess he thought he would be less masculine if he admitted to wearing the stuff.<br>  <br>  If he definatly smells like woman's perfume, yeah he's probably cheating.  But Burburry sells a lot of cologne for men-- just do a google search.  It sounds like you're safe to me.|`|NOcbfa8xaa	you should  trust him|`|UCwnchlhaa	LMFAO u dont kno the dif between mens perfume and womens perfume?!!|`|rs4lvlwKaa	Maybe...When my dad cheated on my mom she noticed that the car smelled like a perfume she didn't own.

eeP9Xp8Laa	Theres a lot.<br>  Like, flirting.<br>  Touching you in some way while talking to you. <br>  Hinting of stuff like movies, going out.<br>  Giving you small compliments.<br>  Going out of his way to see you in the hallway, or talk to you.<br>  <br>  Example- There is this guy I kindof like. He has some super gorgeous blue/green eyes. Today we were outside after lunch and I was looking at him when we were talking, and I was like,"Dude, your eyes are so pretty" And he's like(in a messing around way)"oh yeah, well you're face is pretty!"<br>  it was funny. But things like that let you knw a guy is flirting and might like you
pxbAVuNXaa	If i were you I wouldn't wait for them to apologise to you, i'd go to them, otherwise they might think that you are to "weak" to deal with it. I'd start by just generally talking to them individually (not in a group situation) so that they don't act in way that tries to impress everyone else. That way they'll think that you're a nice person and wouldn't want to join in on 'bitching sessions' :) The longer you leave it, the longer you'll bottle it up so it'll be harder to deal with later on.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	it may be hard, but not impossible. get new friends

I obsess over things that dont matter, too. trust me, he doesnt care! or at least if he's worth ur time he doesnt. only a real jerk would break up with u for that. so, no, I think it's fine. also, u should just leave the topic.

8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Take your son into into your confidence.  Tell him that you feel this is unfair but there is nothing you (or your husband) can do about it to fix it for him.  This is just life, mom, and part of life with kids is teaching them the tough lessons.  The toughest lesson we get to teach our kids is that life is not fair.<br>  <br>  Maybe what you need to realize for yourself is that adults are going to do what they want to do and they can live with it.  Try not to hold it against your step-sons, they haven't been taught any better.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's okay that your son got to see you take on the grandfather this one time, but really, is that how you want to teach him to behave when life is not fair?  Teach him instead to hold his head up high and beg from no one.|`|cGbTJobeaa	As a fellow step-mom, let me take you by the shoulders and shake you for a few moments.<br>  <br>  First of all, life is not fair. Second of all, real life is not the Brady Bunch.  Just because you got married, it did not create the strong bonds of an instant family.  Those relationships are going to take YEARS to develop. It also will take years for your FIL to develop the same level of a bond with your children as he has with his bio-grandchildren.  And his bio-grandchildren that he probably thinks that he doesn't see nearly often enough. He probably gets to see your kids more often than he gets to see your husband's sons.  He misses being able to see his grandsons as often as he used to. OK?<br>  <br>  In the meanwhile, so your step-sons have affluent an affluent mother and maternal grandparents. They also do not get to see their dad very often.  And now they won't get to see their dad at all for the next 2 or 3 months.  I would imagine that the boys would rather have face time with their dad than things.  In the meanwhile, your kids get to see their dad (your husband) every day (when he isn't away on business).  From their perspective, your kids are lucky because they get to see your husband all of the time instead of being a visitor in their dad's home and seeing him only once every other weekend...and not at all for 3 months.  <br>  <br>  So quit being jealous about your step-son's material possessions. It is irrelevant. And your in-laws are not obligated to help you and your husband pay your bills. So, also lose the attitude about them not helping you out financially.<br>  <br>  So your son was disappointed."Them's" the breaks.  Your son will develop a relationship over time with his step-brothers and his new grandfather...especially if it isn't crammed down anyone's throat. Schedule some fun family activities while your step-sons are at  your house so that they can have positive memories of growing up together.<br>  <br>  It is going to take time. Put your Mama Bear-ness back into hibernation. It will get better.<br>  <br>  Oh, and while I'm shaking you by the shoulders, lose the attitude about your in-laws liking the ex better than you.  Do not turn this into a competition between the two of you. You are each unique individuals.  Don't worry about them having a relationship with the ex. They have to be nice to the ex to have access to their grandchildren. It is in the best interest of they boys that their paternal grandparents get along with their mother.|`|AA12187979	So you have and 11-year old and a 13-year old and you end up making a comitment to split attention between them anouther man and two additional kids and you complain that some other family shows the step kids more attention.<br>  <br>  Look what you done to them, they use to get 100% now they are just left with your whining.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Bottom line the FIL was hurtful to a child for no reason other than being a pure out and out jerk. Put the breaks on the in-laws... Ban them from your home, and from having contact with your child until they get the point that EMOTIONAL ABUSE will not be tolerated. Let your husband worry with when and if they see their bio-grandchildren. Personally, the FIL should not be around children at all if all he wants to do is abuse them emotionally. No he did not have to take your son, but to go about it in the manner he did was inexcusable. Your FIL needs to get some counseling to figure out why he (a grown man) needs to verbally abuse your child.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	First of all, it is time for you to grow up. There was no need for all of this phone calling and drama. There is no reason for all of these children to be treated exactly the same except for all of them to have to follow the same rules in your home. Secondly, you need to explain to your son that while it may not seem fair, (and life generally isn't) he will have to wait to learn to drive. Assuming you are in the US, NONE of these should be behind the wheel of a car as it is illegal until they are 15 and then only with a permit and while in driving school. SO I suggest that you and your son start studying for your permit tests together. Then when he is 15 you can both take drivers education classes.<br>  <br>  If you react to all difficult situations the way you reacted to this one, it is no wonder the in-laws are having a hard time excepting you. ANd your son and your husband's sons are not brothers, they are step brothers who barely see enough of each other to be aquaintances. You cannot force people to think the way you do, nor to feel something they do not feel. Suck it up and learn ways to adapt to this new family. Set the positive example for all the children.|`|krQiDGCHaa	Well, in my house, step parents have the same discipline rights as parents do.<br>  <br>  If my husband weren't home and my step son acted like your step sons, I would have said "Well, sorry, you won't be going I guess.  Get in your rooms and think about why."<br>  <br>  Sometimes, it is not possible to treat all the children fair.  For instance, if the kids are all visiting your in laws and the in laws play favorites you can only shield them so much.  However, in your home YOU call the shots and YOU can make sure everyone gets treated fairly.<br>  <br>  Good thing you told off your father in law -- what a jerk.<br>  <br>  Console your son as best as possible, and explain sometimes people are just rude.  Discipline your step sons for being little a**holes, and have your husband have a chat with them when he gets home.<br>  <br>  Tough love.  It's why MY step son is a loving, caring, WELL BEHAVED individual.  And he listens to ME more than anyone else because I may only be his step mom, but I respect him and he respects me, and I give him reasonable boundaries with goals to look foward to.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD ON:  I also must add it may be different for me, because my step son lives with me.  If he didn't, I don't know that I would react the same.|`|B1sT1t44aa	I am sorry that your husbands family is hurting your child. Only your husband can control this and if he does not do that I would take my children and leave this abuse.<br>  There should be enough love and respect to go around here for everybody and if the adults are that cruel this environment is no good for your own kids.<br>  Loving a man or not does not mean you can continue on with them when they do not have the decency to set up rules and boundaries at the expense of harming others.<br>  When your husband married you he took on the whole package and it is up to him to let the whole family know it.<br>  If all the kid's in this household cannot be treated with love and respect and consideration for all the children and their feelings then the in laws could just deal with the ex wife when they want to spend quality time with their own grandchildren. They would not be allowed to do it through our home and that would be the bottom line.<br>  These in laws could be looking at your children as bonus grandchildren in their lives but they seem pretty selfish if you ask me.<br>  This is just absolutely unforgivable when adults can mentally abuse a child and in a sense they are when they toss your kid's aside as if they are nothing.<br>  No relationship I could have in the world would be worth putting my kids through feeling second best to anybody and this is horrible for them.<br>  There would be some severe changes in this relationship for all of us if my husband wanted to keep this blended family together.<br>  I have 12 grandchildren and 2 bonus ones and they are treated with love all equally and I especially want the two bonus grandchildren to fit in and be comfortable because children are all special.|`|Ka3fbxszaa	As sad as it is, I agree with Ruth. I have 4 step daughters, as well as, 5 kids of my own. There are always issues of "unfairness." It truly breaks my heart to see my kids get treated in a way that I see as unfair. There is so little control over it. The one thing we want to do as a parent is protect our children from hurtful things and it just simply is not always possible. <br>  <br>  The one idea that I could suggest is that you put your foot down about grandpa flaunting it in your son's face. If he wants to spent quality time with his grandsons there is no need to blatently hurt your son's feelings.<br>  <br>  Your son and your 2 step sons will have a relationship that they choose to have. Again, as much as we want things to be one way our children will make decisions based on how they are treated. You can only be there for support.<br>  <br>  I sincerely feel for you and understand. I wish you well with your situation.|`|SOv6I9Wfaa	I can see that you are really hurting here, and fighting for your children, and who wouldn't? But the fact is, you are in the wrong. Your sons are not your in-laws grandchildren - you can't force family feeling on anyone, and if you persist you will only breed resentment. As you can see, you have already put the power into their hands, and they are using it to hurt you and your children. This may be wrong, but if you read around the topic you will find that step-children hardly ever respond well to being forced to treat strangers (which is what your children are) as if they were family. You really do have to step back and respect those bonds of blood. Above all, be careful not to teach your children to be resentful or envious just because their step-brothers appear to have  more than they do.|`|Yby3loNEaa	first off why are in this relationship? your kids come first no matter what, i don't know how you and your sons relationship is but if this is what is going to happen then he will hate you in the long run. where is his dad at????????? if you have no car then how are you going to get around then next 4 months?? i'm sorry but i hate it when i hear storys like this i mean if me and my man broke it off and went are owe way, who ever i was with after that they would and so would their family have respect for me and my child, if not see you later there are many other people out there that will take us in blood or not real brothers have nothing to do with blood. it seems like the family your husband had before are still upset at the fact that they are not together and taking it out on you kids they don't deserve that they are not the ones that were put in this problem you are. and your husband is just like the rest of them so he sucks too. i feel bad for your kids because they are hurting on the inside and have no one to turn to, they will blame you for everything that is wrong so don't be surprise then it happens
Duri87Yiaa	Some guyss actually knows whats happening :p<br>  I dont know, their just clueless even when you DO talk <br>  to themm its like HEEELLOOOOO !|`|iNgfizSgaa	We can't read minds! You have to talk to us.
FVhXSQeNaa	I went through this once before as well. What ended up happening is... it took a while, but we became best friends because even though he couldn't be with me while he thought I was depressed (it was too hard on him), it didn't mean he didn't want me in his life. He ended up dating another girl for a while, and I dated another guy... eight months later he realized he had made a mistake and he asked me out. One year after that, I realized I had moved on and I couldn't get over the fact that he wasn't able to stick with me when I was sad the first time we dated, so I broke up with him. To this day (nine years later), he is still my dearest friend. I hope the outcome is as great for you as it is for me. :) Best of luck!
AA12198711	Did you not go to college and further your education so you would not be stuck doing a job you hate?|`|LddkW0JFaa	You should appoint another employee or employees "assistant manager" and find another job. Then just check in once in a while. Managers aren't paid by the hour so just don't spend so much time there. Your pay is so low that it is illegal. It would only be legal if you were part owner. If your dad can only pay you $100/wk, the business is failing. Resign now. You could get a part-time job 20 hrs/wk and make more.|`|mMBzpldbaa	by my calculations, if you're working 12 hours a day 6 days a week, at $7 an hour (i don't know the minimum wage where you are so i guessed) then you should be earning $504 a week.<br>  <br>  your family is shortchanging you by a great amount. you should get a job which appreciates you. your father can hire another manager if he refuses to pay you minimum wage at least.|`|fnytzXWTaa	Wow,I'm so sorry. I'm 15 and If I was in your boat I have no clue what to do, but I would ask my father if I could work less hours. Tell him its hurting you. I know your parents are not doing well,but just take a deep breath and work still. I'm not saying give it up,but you still need your friends.|`|5EfJu34taa	hey i can understand you situation well.don't back out now.your family needs you.also you told that you don't hate the job.its just that you are exhausted working round the clock.so just tell your parents that you need a break maybe for a week or 15 days.hang out with your friends to some nice beach or wherever you feel refreshing.<br>  i am sure after you come back you will feel nice.<br>  also tell your parents to give you such type of breaks once in 2 months(or as you want) bcoz you also need some refreshment right?|`|j8RXDfn5aa	wow. No wonder you are exhausted & also depressed! If you are wondering if that is normal... Heaven's yes!! <br>  <br>  Now, you MUST go to your parents (possibly together...? - to have more of a chance of support - of being understood?) <br>  <br>  I learned a long time ago, there are no victims, only volunteers. <br>  <br>  So, you need to state your case, explain the effects this "arrangement" is having on you! That you have been desperately attempting to tolerate it for all the reasons you stated here! <br>  <br>  You need to address this & negotiate some much needed changes!!<br>  <br>  Now, IF that doesn't happen as easily as we would hope... YOU ARE going to have to decide ( before you even approach them ), that you simply cannot continue like this... You will need to be prepared for the worst.[In this case, that would not be taken seriously.] I would encourage to take care of yourself in that event, & summon the strength to move on & find alternate employment.<br>  Best of luck to you!!!

deuzhVU8aa	ok listen here and listen good, u just answered my ques. so im gona answer yours... im 19. so ur yung to me ima act like ur my lil sis. NEVER write him a live note pouring out your heart. be yourself, he's already talking to you so keep giving him a reason to, show a little skin if you have to. look cute all the time, a little eye make-up wont hurt ONLY IF you know someone to put it on 4 u. MAKE him notice you but at the same time dont look too deaperate. make him know u want him and he will want you back, keep all yur convo short n simple act like u dnt even care about him... TRUST ME, it will work. but for faster results, give him hugs, smile at him all the time, if you MUST write a love note, include no more than 5 words like... ur cute, how bout me? or just ur cute. keep him on his toes (keep him wondering) what's this girls problem but in a good way. lol hope this helps!!! oh and your parents...4get them, sneak around. if you 2 do get together, work him in as a "friend" 1st works every time.|`|1HSMf6dbaa	get over him! u said he's not into u and ur parents won't even let u have a bf so try to accept that all u can be is friends. instead of thinking that he'll ask u out, think of anything else (except maybe another guy).|`|27IeVZNeaa	You should talk to him more often, have confidence.

But then later I started to like her but i was still eating paste and she still didn't. So I quit eating paste and then I thought she liked me but then she had a boyfriend. So I beat up her boyfriend and now I don't think she likes me anymore but i still like her but I don't eat paste anymore so i was thinking about sniffing glue instead. So anyway What was your question?

And I wouldn't advise getting into a relationship with someone else when you like this guy. Just don't do anything. It's okay to like him but you don't have to act on it.  The first answer is right if he likes you he'll break up with her.|`|c5anDswjaa	Oh you dont need to throw yourself at him.. If he likes you enough he will break up with her..

LtP7oOtraa	girls are confusing. i know i can tell a guy i like him. but most girls are deathly afraid of rejection. and girls take things a hundred times more seriously than guys do, so there's a fear that all the 'signs' that you've seen were in your head and you mean nothing to him. that really hurts. guys aren't typically as emotional as girls are. we take everything personally. <br>  <br>  there's also the i'm the girl HE'S supposed to make the first move thing, but that's slowly fading.|`|eCbEJxsKaa	Girls don't tell guys that they like them because it keeps it all a secret so that the guy will try to figure them out. It kind of attracts the guy. So girls flirt but say they don't like them.

AA10873763	If he makes you angry and makes you cry a lot, break up with him.<br>  That's not what a relationship is all about.  You can't change a guy into something he isn't.  This one smokes weed and disrespects your feelings.  Move on.
DcrI9zmkaa	I'm female but here's my two cents anyway. :)<br>  <br>  My guess is that your age won't be as big an issue as the fact you lied.  You showed him you aren't trustworthy, and that's going to be a huge hurdle to overcome.<br>  <br>  Next time, be honest.  It isn't like a year's going to make a difference, anyway.|`|kGO4ZhtQaa	just tell him the truth|`|6xFOQ5Ngaa	well first off you need to chill outttt. if the guy really likes you, he isnt going to care about an extra 1 year difference. when your talking just be like "hey i have to be honest with you, im not a junior, im a sophomore, i just felt like if you thought i was older you would like me more" that way he thinks its cute and you get the message out to him.<br>  <br>  really, if he likes you more than a simple hookup, you dont have anything to worry about. good luck :]]|`|a87POYvAaa	if he really liked you he wouldnt care but he might be a little p*ssed for you lying to him OR maybe he could be happy to know that you actually like him because you tried to impress him through lying. depends on the dude...|`|hF6uZqWRaa	its not a big deal. it would be different if you were in middle school or something lol. good luck to you!|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	wow....so that means being like 16 instead of 17...OH NO THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END..not a big deal|`|OhKl0BAVaa	something tells me he knows....kinda trust me on this one. i dont know for sure but the way high school runs im sure SOMEONE has told him his friends prolly make fun of him ( just to give him ****) and if this is the case he will go on acting as if he didnt know until you tell him. in that case just say you were messing with him and you thought for SURE he knew wer wernt a Jr. with all that said i dont think its a big deal to him you can always tell him you were suposed to be a Jr but you were held back in 2nd grade or something|`|qwvydopwaa	i jst think if you sit him down and are honest with him then your fine. but make sure that you are alone with him, not in the middle of the halls with a bunch of ppl..let him know that you care about the fact that you lied and that it was only to give yourself a chance with him (come clean ASAP)<br>  <br>  and btw...thanks for the help on my question :]|`|dr0Mi2Cmaa	if he realli likes u he wouldnt care only 2 yrs apart who cares sophmores n srs date all the time he mite be pisted u lied but i think hell take it well. <br>  Good luckk|`|CKr6Wwp3aa	just tell him but not awkwardly cause then hed think ur weird, but just tell him cause if it were me id be like ok whatever|`|B47KoSGyaa	idk how he would respond but the faster u tell him teh better chances are he will find out anyways so might as well come from u if u wanna keep him|`|cSGfoQWEaa	I would not have anything to do with you.

T9TK229Saa	Probably. But I would say, your chances with him are pretty much shot now. I'm saying that because if your friend and him ever break up - you have two choices, get with him or stay friends with her. Either way it'll end badly on your part. I think you should just forget about him and him possibly having a crush on you or attempting to make you jealous. It will be a lot easier and much more drama-free :) (On the other hand - he could've found out you lhave feelings for him some way and may just be trying to be an *** - but like I said before, it's a waste of time and way too much drama. Forget about it)|`|AjD6Vm8Saa	:)|`|p3rDEZBFaa	Sounds like it could be man things.. Try talking to him be freinds and see what kind of guy he is..

MtbaNz5Yaa	Try being the better person
bTt2Bo2oaa	Aw crap, this is tough for you, I imagine. Think about this: is a friend really a friend if you feel like your not even there when your other friend comes? You should tell her how you feel (I know this might be hard to do) but she'll probably just say "We don't think we're leaving you out" or something like that (I'm just guessing, i dont know you or her).  But possibly you should try and talk to your BFF and ask her why she is doing this to you. I'll be blunt: Maybe she just doesn't want to be as close to you anymore.
SLIIyjyRaa	Don't ignore yout feelings, go for it missy!
BjmJharpaa	go out there next time and tell them you will call the cops<br>  they might stop and if they don't then seriously call them<br>  it seems completely dorky in a way but trust me they wont come back xD|`|2GQv8dfgaa	dude thats creepy. just like close your blinds or sleep somewhere else like the basement or something. wherever they cant see you or anything!! tell them to stop your freaking me out. be a b***h lol|`|DwgmPUHMaa	I think you should just throw random stuff at them, or shine torches in there eyes so they look like deer in headlights, eventually they will scatter (:|`|Or6RNcA8aa	WTF is there problem?

Make friends and have fun...you want a guy that will love you when you're goofing off or don't look your best as well as when you remembered to do your hair.  In my opinion its also better to date someone you know well, not use dating as a way to get to know someone...i'd rather know the guy and know i can talk to him and have fun during non-romantic times too.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and don't rush it...have fun. :)|`|rN0b4jWHaa	I wanted a bf around your age but my mom wouldnt let me until i was 16 so i snuck around with a boy when i was 15 because i just wanted to be loved and he ended up hurting me SO bad, now i realize that its better to wait till your older because you have a better chance of having a serious relationship.[if that's what you want, idk its what i wanted]|`|roQIRcZVaa	I was 15, in the 10th grade.|`|ZyfilGjFaa	ok im 13 and i had my first bf in 1st grade!!!!! hahahahaha!!!! but im not allowed to date unitl im like 15 but i  have had bf's but the thing is there is no point cause u can't go on dates.........at least i can't..... i cant even go out on group dates!!!!!!!!!!! which sucks but i would say that u could have a bf ....... but save the going on dates until ur like 15 and older|`|fc6bFYHvaa	I was 14, he was so hot.

She s probably too mature for you, its better you just please your eyes and get good notes in her class ;)|`|qnU1HS1aaa	Have a quickie in the bathroom with her and yeah thats about it.|`|K2Soawplaa	dont.<br>  chances are she'll get fired.|`|XasLRQnXaa	ask her for some tutoring help after class. ;)|`|a87POYvAaa	lol it would be kinda weird bringing in a girl whos as old as your mom to your parents!!!|`|6IjBUqAfaa	Gross.|`|04e63bfce1b042a1f4403000ad7c73c1aa	ur prof culd be hot, but u sound like a loser, get a life idiot|`|be3c88e740a37f3e5f159676e4daab94aa	probably u can lick my asss first , dosent reflect gd about ur mom though|`|Yz981zO6aa	If you mean that you are uncomfortable talking with your professor about your course work because she is attractive, get over it. She is there to help you with your education and she is a professional. If you are indicating that you would like to ask her out, forget it. It is considered unethical for college professors to fraternize with their students and they can be fired for it. Find a hot co-ed to date instead.|`|N7gOE1btaa	You don't.  If you two carry on any type of non-professional relationship, then both of you are crossing ethical boundaries, whether or not she is your professor.  You need to be careful of this as it could lead to her losing her job and you being expelled.|`|lqINcThraa	Well.. Seeing how the other answers did not answer your question. If you feel you really want to talk to her. Think of question's on the daily lessons given in class and stay over and ask her. Start with that and then incorperate some personal stuff. <br>  <br>  Look for a ring on her finger|`|NTC6g8hYaa	perve leave her alone shes older and probably married.

Tell him to get lost unless you and your mom are turned on by liars.  Ask him if he wants sex He will say yes.  Have your mom ask the same question and the answer will be the same.|`|rwGTRUj0aa	you're going to hit on a guy with your mom there? thats slightly awkward.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Ask him flat out if it's against the policy for you to ask him on a date?<br>  Smile when you say it.

CCAw6XLtaa	guys honestly love it when you make the first move in other words keep making the first move until he can make the second one back. you wont come across as pushy your not going to screw it up dont worry about it. <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Keep txting if he keeps the convo going|`|UPN3zqq6aa	if you think hs interested and hes told you he is interested, then ask him out go for it seriously if he says yes you'll be like why didnt i do this earlier if no then hes the loser goodluck x|`|e2vf8Y3Saa	Yeah keep txting him, i asked my best guy friend about that because he never imed me first and he said he doesnt even notice. They dont overthink things like we do. I would just drop the going out thing for a bit. Wait for him to ask.|`|4KbYMdluaa	I think nothing takes the place of looking someone in the eyes when they talk or even hearing their voice, you can't text truth and sincerity.|`|Tm9kA5umaa	....|`|TiRhwBFAaa	uhm im a guy, and yes we r confsing. im 14, and like this girl and im not sure if she likes me but my friends say she does cause she wouldnt really text me and talk to me as much as she does if she didnt. i still dont know. i feel the same way as u. i am always the 1 to strt texting her. and then she stops. when we exchanged #'s at first i strted texting her for like maybe a few days but then i stopp for like a week i guess or so. and then she was like hellllooooo. so maybe she is interested. but about u :b (: in my perspective, i text the girl evry day and i always call her first. i dont think its being puchy. he'll answer since he probably does like u. maybe he doesnt want to text you cause he thinks u have a boy friend. so maybe he said to himself ill lay off and if shes really interested she'll text me. and if he keeps going he does like u cause he likes talking to u. the girl i like told me "i never text back too soon so i dont make the guy think im desperate" so i was saying ok she doenst text back on purpose. ur not being pushy. text him. and his excuse seemed legit.|`|vlnZXGu9aa	Ohkay, you should txt him when something relevant comes up, like something you used to do or is ironic. Have a purpose or something. And if you really want to sstart a convo, ask him if he just pulled out a certain parking lot or something. Don't be too pushy, and if he was lying about the ride, he probably didn't want to go with your friends and have them judging you|`|C7Cz9qqTaa	well give it a few days then be bold and ask him whats the deal does he want to date you or not?<br>  well you can put it nicer words then that, <br>  but you get the just of it.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|LAyigK5Aaa	Keep texting and wait awhile then invite him again b ut if he says no then hes not interested.|`|F8wzcKntaa	If he wants you let him text you first.

IhED5vaAaa	Does he own a pink handkerchief?<br>  If he does, theres you're answer|`|OEATSehSaa	if he was gay he wouldnt be shy around girls because he wouldnt think of it|`|ibeVcQyWaa	MYOB.  If he's gay and wants you to know, he'll tell you.|`|Mubj1o2eaa	Well, some guys are just shy. And usually you can tell by the way they talk and act, but don't pry and push. If he is gay, he will tell you when ready. And why does he have to have sex with every girlfriend he has? Some people like to save it until their ready, which in a lot of cases is after marriage, it's suppost to be for the special person and when you know their ready.
xoXkHOVsaa	I don't think someone can really say they love you if you have only met online.<br>  <br>  My experience is that internet dating doesn't get you anywhere.  You only end up meeting people who are desperate or too weird to meet people on their own.  I deleted my account pretty quickly.|`|td6WXhv4aa	No,<br>  <br>  Internet dating is full of psycho's,predators,rapists, bad element who lie through their teeth.  Some get lucky and meet the right guy or girl for them who isn't dangerous but many don't.<br>  <br>  Be extremely careful!|`|sgRDJUXqaa	No, I don't think it's wrong.  I think it's becoming an acceptable way of meeting people.<br>  <br>  But that boy doesn't love you.  He doesn't really know you.  All the talking in the world won't compare to actually meeting and working together.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I am for it.  But I also believe you should meet whoever you talk to within 2 weeks to see if there is a true connection.  I was not into the bar scene and found it a good way to meet men.

Be careful and never meet someone in someone at some remote spot where you could be in danger. the best place to meet someone if you do not want them to know where you live<br>  is by a freeway, so you can leave that person behind, also don't give out to much info over the internet, like last name ,where you work or go to school and the list gos on.|`|OI45dNiVaa	Yes.|`|te5rxddmaa	no,never u get hooked up with perves or really old crazy men that cant get a women

Go up to him and say "hi, I like you".  He will probably smile.  Good Luck!|`|uTdUNf7iaa	Flirt ;)|`|bMLdEkncaa	saying "hey" will probably get him to notice u for starters|`|41PJpTXAaa	Like yourself. Whether you're goofy, silly, crazy, quirky, smart, reserved, or whatever, how can you expect a guy to like you if you don't like yourself? You've got to show this person how awesome you are, but first you need to know how awesome you are. Build up your self confidence. Now, this doesn't mean you have to be loud, boisterous, arrogant, chatty, or forward. It just means getting to a place where you're comfortable in your own skin. You can be secure, sweet and humble all at the same time. Guys like confident, interesting girls who have their own lives. The only guys who like insecure girls are the ones who are insecure themselves. But who wants to be with a guy who wants a girl to feel bad about herself? That's not healthy, and you deserve better.<br>  # Get his attention. He can't fancy you if he doesn't know you exist. If you haven't caught his eye yet, then get him to notice you. You've got to walk before you run, right? Say "Hi". Say "Good-bye". Wave. When he reciprocates, is when you know he notices you. Introduce yourself somehow and make conversation. Take an interest in who he is--what he likes, where he's coming from, where he wants to go--and show him who you are, too. While some guys don't like to talk that much, it's nearly impossible for someone to like you if he doesn't get to know you--unless he "likes" you for all the wrong reasons.<br>  #<br>  Crack a joke. Having a good sense of humor makes everything better. That doesn't mean you should be a giggling fool, laughing at everything that crosses your path. Express your sense of humor in your own way. Some people are witty and sarcastic, others can tell hilarious stories, and many people just do quirky things and poke fun at themselves. No matter what tickles your sense of humor, it's much easier to like someone who you can have a good laugh with once in a while. If you don't find something to laugh about together, then maybe you'll discover that you don't like him after all!<br>  # Do things together. If he loves rock-climbing, ask him if he can show you how, and make a good-faith effort to see why he's so into it. Have an open mind. Find out what you have in common, and include him in your world. If you love a certain kind of music, ask him if he's ever listened to a particular artist and offer to play a CD for him. Finding activities that you can enjoy together can really lay down a bond and further his appreciation of you.<br>  #<br>  Have patience. These things take time. You can't force someone to like you, and trying to hurry things up can ruin the courtship altogether. Give him some space and don't be obsessive. Let things progress at a natural pace, or fade out of natural causes. Eventually he'll tell you one way or another whether or not he's interested in reciprocating your affection. And if he's not, don't hang around him like a lost puppy. Sometimes you might be incompatible in ways that you don't see, and sometimes a guy just isn't ready for a long term relationship. Don't take rejection too personally. It happens. Not everyone in the world is going to like you. Move on! There are other fish in the sea and if you followed the first step, you know that you're a good catch.|`|bpTTrwZIaa	You think it's humanly possible to "make" someone like someone else?|`|cggkcAC5aa	Tell him, let him know<br>  =]<br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309144913AAzhNXV">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|liid9ZTqaa	avoid to become pregnant|`|lmOpGVJFaa	u take ur clothes off! show off the goods!!|`|9GBmCxhJaa	flirt make ur self noticeable 2 him let him <br>  no u got his back in anything and always<br>  always dress to impress him..........Good Luck|`|AA12060541	flirt w/ him|`|SHwuzsPyaa	idk<br>  <br>  how do i get a girl to like me?|`|gp8M8pg1aa	start talking to him. try to find ways to hang out with him and his friends.

DcrI9zmkaa	Three years isn't that long; and, frankly, if you can't be a little more compassionate toward him then you don't really care about him.<br>  <br>  Move on.|`|AA11501437	yeah - he needs to move on - in his own way - not the way you want him to.  I am guessing he was married for a very long time.  He needs to go through the grieving process on his own and in his own time. grieveing for a few years after a 30 - 40 year marriage doesn't seem that wrong to me.   <br>  <br>  if you don't want sex with him, you tell him you are working to avoid being with him, you didn't think it would last this long, you aren't in love with him, you are annoyed with how he refers to you, you want other guys, and you are pretty harsh when you talk about him - then it is pretty obvious that you don't want him...yet you still want to change him!?  do you want to mold him into something suitable for you?  would you want him doing this to you?<br>  <br>  if everything you said above is true - yeah, you are wrong for wanting him to get rid of all her things...and change how he views you.  you have no right to dictate how (and how long) he handles the death of his spouse.<br>  <br>  if you really were in love with him, and wanted him - then i could understand talking to him about how her things make you feel second, and until he is ready to retire her belongings to the basement, you would just assume hang out at your place - or take some time apart to evaluate feelings for eachother.|`|Bsf78pfsaa	you just dont understand because I have been there when my dad passed away my mom for us left things out and some things are still the same I would be more understanding|`|CbRr3upaaa	Um.. he loves her. For a 46 yr old woman you need to grow up. He misses her obviously and you dont even care about his feelings.|`|KtR0NstMaa	WOW you have some issues here.  First of all you sound like you are not looking forward to him showing up at your place anymore.  That it makes you uncomfortable.  Listen to your inner self.  We don't always understand why we feel a way we do but I think there is probably a reason (beyond the sex) and all the wife's stuff.  <br>  <br>  I do think you need to move on.  You don't love him sexually and he needs to move on.  There is an age difference here too.  <br>  <br>  For you to be happy you need to find yourself someone you feel comfortable  cuddling with and etc.  But I don't think from what you have said that he is the one.<br>  <br>  So a talk is in order. Communication is important here and he will probably feel hurt (that is to be expected).  But your feelings are very important too.  <br>  <br>  Tell him you love him as a FRIEND and that it doesn't go any further.  (Sounds to me like he is a little insecure)  Once he can put his wife's things away or give them away he will be able to move on too.  He is leaning on you because you have been there for him in his time of comfort and need.<br>  <br>  Also if he can afford it, a Psychiatrist would be able to help him greatly.   It doesn't mean he is psycho it just means someone out there who is a Professional could help him understand himself and help him get through what he is going through.  Or a Minister could help. <br>  <br>  You need someone you are excited about when he comes over.   Tell your 66 year old friend that you need to move on.  Be compassionate but talk to him.   He needs to know.     Good luck
78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	Talk to him everyday and see what's up. You should've known what was coming if you ignored him and was being a jerk. Sometimes your friends can say something just so you can't be with him. DOn't be like that, words are just words. Tell him you still want him to be your friend, because you guys had fun.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	See if he will meet you somewhere so you can talk face to face.  Explain exactly what happened and see what he has to say!

j8RXDfn5aa	If he is 16, he is sort of stuck - to a point. If she is just your basic B***h, a nag, etc. he is stuck with her. <br>  <br>  If she is abusive (mentally, physically, emotionally, etc.) he needs to go to a teacher, a guidance counselor, or some trusted adult... They can try to aid him in getting help or getting out. <br>  <br>  I grew up in an awfully miserable house; my mother was abusive in every way & a complete pain in the A** too! <br>  <br>  I got through the last two yrs. of Hell by really throwing myself into what I COULD control!!  My schoolwork, getting my education, my music, my art, poetry, etc. & Thank God I had good friends to talk to.<br>  Maybe, too, he could get an after school job to learn more about life - & get away from her as much as he possibly can!!
lNlL0Ag2aa	The sooner the better because it will hurt more when he finds out you're cheating on him then when he realizes that he got dumped.
CCAw6XLtaa	ok first of being a klutz is cute dont worry. also if you got the hots for this guy dont be afriad to go out and get him guys love it when the girls make the first move he prbably had feelings for you but is to shy to do anyting about it. so go out and get him. good luck.|`|0ZAoksGlaa	If you get nervous just smile whenever you make eye contact. Talk to him about his/your interests. Find what you have in common and just generally get to know him. Friends first is good. See what happens.|`|DT1Blo2paa	start off simple because i am a klutz to i mean like i fall all the time and i am always on crutches but still just say hey you defiantly did not see that or fall into him i started talking to my crush by falling and he finds it cute because every time i text him saying i fell he started a thing saying only you only you because i trip when there is like to much oxygen in certain parts of the world lol but i am very outgoing and i like to take control so if you fall alot embrace it because one day you might fall into the arms of the love of your life because believe me i am 14 and i have been tripping since i started walking lol good luck!!!
xoXkHOVsaa	There really isn't anything more you can do.  He either likes you or he doesn't.  It sounds like you are just a friend to him.  If you need a real answer, ask him again how he feels.  Make him tell you once and for all if he likes you or not.
xResxJ2Paa	Honesty!!!!!

N7gOE1btaa	Typically in these situations the girl requires more foreplay to get her body sensitive to the touch.  Have your bf engage in more foreplay, such as going down on you and using his fingers to stimulate there.  This should help you out.  Also, keep in mind that some girls just don't do that frequently and you may be one of them.  The only way to overcome that is to try what I said.|`|eQENZXz1aa	its what he needs to do that is the problem <br>  so you will either have to train him or suffer or replace him lol|`|f7aed8ce48808e701a4034d72a8b8bd6aa	Practice, practice, practice.  And it is important that your boyfriend slows down and that you experiment with ways to make it satisfying for you.  If he doesn't do that then he simply isn't being a good lover.|`|b2K8vZXNaa	try different positions... the best one is <br>  <br>  woman on her back with her feet on his chest knees bent or have your legs go over his shoulders so your legs are high up and back you know?<br>  <br>  you gotta make sure his penis is hitting your g-spot every time he penetrates, women need a constant, consistant rythem to be able to come.|`|cggkcAC5aa	Its spelled ***, and lol idk, its your body, there is no way i could tell you how to *** more<br>  =]<br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309144913AAzhNXV">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|UKYDpztQaa	sounds like you need a little more foreplay

1fB2UdRHaa	Yes, he is cheating on you.|`|4dN1atrNaa	well either he feels bad for always being with his "cousin" and showers you with love because of not spending enough time with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or he is definatly cheating and only showers you with more and more loveis because he doesn't want you to be suspishious and look to much into his free time with that cousin of his :O|`|k8zRud7Daa	ya he is probably with your mom
QPp7zQQpaa	Aww, you almost got me to tears. Honey, pride won't keep you alive next time he gets enraged, and as hard as it can sound, it's better to call your family now and not have someone from the Embassy inform them you are in the ICU.<br>  It is sad, and it is tough, but you must stand up for yourself and leave this abuser. Abusers are like that, really nice and sweet, until you push one of their buttons. He is not perfect, he has a heavy baggage he is carrying and you are not safe with him - you know that.<br>  Please, find a shelter, a friend or whatever you need to do but get out of his reach. Slowly but surely, he is cracking your self esteem. YOu do not deserve this. Leave. Please.|`|b2588303cd0bf17f0993891608852540aa	You need to find a battered women's shelter and go there ASAP.  He is NEVER going to change and it is only going to get worse from here.  He is obviously NOT a perfect husband.  A perfect husband would NOT HIT YOU.  Go seek immediate help and get out.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	So let me tell you about two of my three sisters that were also mentally and phisically abused by their husbands.<br>  Both eventually left them.<br>  With my older sister it took 5 years, my youngest took 15 years ???<br>  <br>  THEY BOTH now realise this was WAY TOO LONG, especially the youngest sister. She wonders now what the hell was she thinking about.<br>  <br>  YOUR HUSBAND DOES NOT LOVE YOU, HE OWNS YOU !<br>  Sooner or later you'll get sick of it enough to leave him, when you grow up enough to realise what is best for you.<br>  Between then and now, there's going to be a few thousand bruises, so if you don't leave him, get used to it and don't complain to me.<br>  Plus there'll be the broken ribs, maybe a broken nose, or he'll break your fingers or a thumb.<br>  If you really unlucky, he'll accidently kill you.<br>  <br>  So ask your relatives in England to send you some cash fast, <br>  AND GET THE HELL OUT !<br>  <br>  NEVER have a relationship with a person like that !<br>  You are young enough now to find someone new, someone that really loves you.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Okay girl, it's your time to do something about this. You are young, only 19! You have the rest of your life to live and you don't want to live it in pain. You may think you are in love but if your married to a guy like this it's time for a change, he obviously doesn't love you if he is doing stuff like this. I know the hurt you are going through, my ex-wife is dating a horrible man, he does a lot of the same things your husband is doing, my daughter tells me all the hurt her, her mother and brother go through because of that man. They have tried a lot of things to get away but like you, her mother thinks she really loves this man. You can't stay with him, if you do this is going to hurt you so much. And if you happen to have kids with this man image the pain the kids are going to go through, knowing that daddy does bad things to mommy. You have to pick up the courage to leave. When he goes to visit his grandmother in texas you leave him. Pack up all of your stuff, call your family back home in london and tell them everything. Then write him a letter about your exact feelings! Leave it on the table and start over fresh!|`|QtpROmdhaa	leave him you are so young. you will soon find a better man that will appreciate you. you still have so much to look forward to. you dont deserve that kind of treatment|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You leave him. You go to the police and tell them what's happened, you tell your family what's going on and ask them to send you a ticket, and leave. Don't wait for more abuse.<br>  <br>  He's taking advantage of you because you are very young, and because you are so far away from your family ... and because he knows that he can charm people into believing him. <br>  <br>  Go as soon as you can, before he kills you. Because if you stay, he will kill you.|`|AA10531094	You should go to a shelter in your area for abused women and see if family or friends can help you get back home.  As long as you stay (as you can see), he's only going to get worse.  You're lucky you don't have children, so now is the time, to make a move.   Good Luck!
l72FO4eMaa	Hire me as your bodyguard|`|fia9gMHpaa	Just ignore him. If you stay calm and cool, then you have won.

My older brother was a whore. <br>  <br>  Anyway, say you could only bring your girl friends over when your mother is home. You hang out in a "public" room, i.e. the kitchen or the living room. She could check on you guys periodically. It does suck for her to "babysit" but that seems like the only way.<br>  <br>  If not and she still holds her ground, you will have to simply hang out somewhere else.|`|jcK6EXpiaa	haha, and she is right not to trust. I used to be just "friends" with boys, but sometimes those boys had older brothers....if you really just want to hang out (and I remember my teenage years, its very, very rare that there are boys and girls who really are just friends and have no feelings for one another whatsoever) then ask your mom if she can come over in a group setting, as in a few other kids too, and your mom is invited to hang out also (maybe a movie night or something???) sounds lame having the momma there too, but believe me, its the best way to build trust. And some kids just might end up liking your mom. I love the moms of most of my friends like an aunt. They are almost as much fun to hang around.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Tell her that when your friend comes over you guys will be in her eyesight and then she can see that you can be trusted.  If she agrees you will probably have to do this many times before she even lets you be alone with your friend.  DO NOT betray that trust once you obtain it because it won't be pretty.|`|KwNpyp3saa	Talk to her again. Ask her if they can hang out in the living room.

Although he did break up with you...|`|sW81TCFCaa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|hGWhzfFqaa	Lol so he doesn't feel like a single loser.
zzUgYFy4aa	(((I'm overweight and can't believe someone like me at all)))<br>  <br>  talking like this is your problem, why would you say such a hateful thing about yourself!!!???<br>  <br>  you need to get some self esteem and stop pushing your issues on him
CUB3wUdiaa	well the only thing i can think of is get back out there and let it be known that you are on the prowl.  i dont know what you look like or anything but if your next bf is out there then hell let you know hes interested.  for lack of a better term you just have to get back on the horse and ride again.  lol    well let me know if this helps.  not that i told you anything you didnt already know.<br>  <br>  ray
JhvqUvlsaa	Ah ha! I thought that was it. Yeah she is pulling him away from you so maybe she is jealous of your friendship with him because it is so close (or was). So all you can do really is give them space and let him come to you; it might not happen unless and until they break up, but there's really nothing you can do as long as she is in the picture.<br>  <br>  Say hi to him and be kind to him, letting him know he's still your friend. It's going to be hard, but I know you can do it. Good luck! =)
svkOcIgSaa	well i say he's not a true friend because a friend like that isn't real.<br>  he has to know that your his best friend your not trying to ruin his relationship.<br>  i had a boyfriend who didn't like my friends and didn't want me hanging with my friends and he would get so mad at me when i hung with them, and so i dumped him after 5 months because someone like that isn't a good person.<br>  If he wont take the time to listen to you then go on with your life and find another best friend that will|`|ezI5HwRWaa	It's probably because his girlfriend was jealous or has convinced him that he shouldn't talk to you. He isn't worth your time. A true best friend wouldn't do that to you.<br>  <br>  I know it hurts, I've been there. You need people in your life who will stay with you and build you up, not blow you off and hurt you like that. :(|`|fU4pOpeHaa	well he doesn't sound like a very good bestfriend. Bestfriends are supposed to be there for each other. Tell him how you feel and b4 you do say "before you say anything hear me out" then tell him how you feel. If he does not stop this behavior, then look for a new bestfriend.|`|L2SLF4L5aa	We have to look at life from a positive perspective.  We have to want to be around friends and people who want us around.  Unfortunately for your friend, he has chosen to please this jealous girlfriend of his (even at the expense of your good friendship).  Its gonna hurt but, you need to move on.  Sounds like it will be his BIG loss not having a great friend like you around anymore.  Don't dwell on this negative experience.  Learn from it...help it make you a better person from the experience....and move on.|`|eMSP740Taa	I say that his GF must have told him not to speak to u anymore because she doesn't think it is ok for him to have a female bestie...i bet that's exactly what it is....<br>  <br>  I've been totally "dumped" by a BF before. Just look at it as their loss. Any friend that would do that to u isn't a true friend anyways.....|`|ay8yoMtIaa	dudeee my bestfriend and me broke apart lately<br>  i was very upset.<br>  <br>  guys are like that i dont get it.<br>  me and my old bestfriendknew eachother since we were 5!! <br>  now we talk every once and while.<br>  i used to sleep over everyday.<br>  idk. just keep friends. not bestfriends. trust me.|`|UTQjqk4Baa	well i think that you should just forget about him cause it sounds like he doesn't want to be ur friend anymore
AA11353473	He sounds like the shy-type.<br>  AND - when he tells you the secrets, he probably feels that he can really trust you with them.<br>  After I read that cracking a joke thing, I think that he definitely likes you. I've read somewhere that, that means he's interested.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aq.YAP4TDTdtrBR4BSoAy_zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304152842AAjiLa3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|rdDM4lcxaa	clearly......... actually i dont see the need to even ask this question|`|0uSPPAb5aa	Yes its obvious that he does.

Its good your doing homework and all that...and you "might" be falling in love with him.<br>  But if you haven't thought of this or tried it..just invite some friends over including him. Introduce him as a friend and have your parents see how he is as a friend first. Once your parents approve him as a friend..slowly gradually tell them that he is your boyfriend:)<br>  <br>  Ps.Person that replied first.

7q5HsXALaa	She has become comfortable around you, she gives you eyes that lust for you, she gets more touchy with you, she says "I want ur d*** in me".|`|2jzb9wnoaa	You ask her. That's the only way to be sure.|`|uWJJyNR3aa	three months is way too soon if you're in high school or she's a virgin.

iTUugOTLaa	You don't get it. If it's not obvious, you're hiding it...<br>  <br>  insecure<br>  <br>  If it's obvious and you go "all out" for her...<br>  <br>  insecure<br>  <br>  If you show her that you like her (that she attracts you), and you show her that you're not scared to take initiative...<br>  <br>  confident<br>  <br>  That's what you should be, that's what girls want.<br>  <br>  How? Just go up to her, start a conversation, make it nice and short and tell her "You know, I really enjoyed this conversation, I would really appreciate it if you could give me your number, that way we can continue this at a later time" or something similar. Let her know you enjoy it, specifically tell her what you want to do, and let her know the consequences (they are good consequences). That's actually the way to say what you want in an assertive way in any situation.<br>  <br>  cheers
iEaoPEZ1aa	I cried about mine for about 3 months straight - then I started focusing on other things & cried once in a while for another year or so. We were together for about 2.5yrs - it took me a year & half to get over him. It usually takes about half the time you were with the person to get over them. You'll be ok - just make the time you spend getting over them doing something else so it's not a complete waste.|`|zhk8o514aa	Your heart will move on, but their memories will be with you forever.<br>  <br>  No one forgets their first love.  <br>  <br>  I was only 14 when I had a "relationship" it was more like puppy love.

Time goes by and some things change and you just gotta keep moving with time. I'm sure it may be really hard for you since he is your First love, but don't rush it. It's absolutley normal to still have feelings for him. Just try to find something you like to do that doesnt remind you of him. Hang out with your girl friends and do fun things that will make you keep your mind  off of him.Thats what I did. Try not to isolate yourself to where your mind keeps drifting to him. Most of all just give it time. You'll be alright hunny!|`|PAciPpSsaa	Age, time. <br>  I dated a girl on and off for about 2 years, I guess and invested a lot of time, energy and emotion I guess into that relationship, then she broke it off and it was tough, but we were both cool. now we're pals. But even now I wonder how she feels and would consider seeing her again. I think the sooner you convince yourself that it's over and that you are going to find someone even better, the sooner your heart will mend.|`|gTvahsxpaa	actually the answer is quite simple. give it time. it may seem impossible at the moment but later you will realize that you dont need him even though you think you do now. actually i had the same problem up till today. i havent heard from my ex for a week. at first i was 'omg, what should i do?' but sice it been a week for some reason i feel alot better.|`|JiOhZ0Bgaa	In time =/<br>  <br>  Just started to notice other things in life and then eventually just stopped thinking about him all the time<br>  <br>  I see him some times and it does make me think.... <br>  <br>  =/ bad times.|`|f5u4UBX4aa	I never quite did, its only been over 2 months since we broke up so im not expecting any miracles just yet.

Oh it could also be he is not interested but doesn't know how to let you k now, good luck|`|foJm2Yftaa	Hes just not getting the hints, but nobody will be that dump. So maybe he is interested in you. Some people don't avoid. Most times hes not interested. I have to go with HES INTERESTED because normally people who stalk them want to not be stalked, but he said nothing.

GDiH3dUJaa	Let her be childish and let her talk all she wants.Fighting is childish too. And it doesn't shut people up no matter how many times you've done it before. It's stupid. And can lead to bigger problems.Think of the worst case scenario. She might some relative whose in a gang and she can call him up and tell him to shoot you. But honestly, if she's not your REAL best friend than you don't need her. Let it go. She'll get over it too.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Yea, fighting over something so petty, yea, that's not childish drama at all.  Just let it go.  Maybe she didn't really say it and the other friend is lying, you just really don't know.
yXJW5fc7aa	wow that sucks. well u could ask them whats up. they can't hide from a straight forward question. not to sound mean, but get some confidence. believe me, the second u don't seem desperate, and it looks like ur fine alone people start talking to u. its the way u carry yourself some people are drawn to confidence. if they bail on u for no reason they probably aren't all that great. love urself, be comfortable in ur own skin. it takes a while but u can get there. i'd tell them something along the lines of "yeah so when u all stop acting immature u can call me, but right now im not gonna put up with whatever ur going threw. bye" it may seem harsh but it lets them know that ur not dependent on them. they dont have to play with u like that|`|TisBxpygaa	If i were you i wouldent care about my old friend and the others and make new friends o well if they dont like u anymore just suck it up and dont care about them like me i had a great friend once but i cursed at them because they said **** to me and now were not friends and i really dont care so just make great new friends hope i helped|`|c4ZEztBeaa	did u say something to make them upset?I felt this way once when my,"best friend" ditched me and all of our other friends.But then I relized this,if shes just going to leave me like this,shes not much of a friend i want.Wouldn't you say the same?If they ditch you,they're the kind of people that only want attencion.If you can't give it to them,they want nothing to do with you.

X4i2jej5aa	This situation sounds hard, and very tricky to deal with. I do not want to steer you in the wrong path and ask you to tell her you like her, because as a girl, if someone told me that while i have a bf, i mite not want to hang out with that person anymore. I think you should just be patient and wait and see. After they break up, you as a close friend, can comfort her and heal her. When you think she's ready to date again, that's the time to make your move and tell her you like her. If she says she just want to be friends, it would be awkward, but try ur best to make it work. Don't worry about one failed relationship, because you are going to find someone better later in the future.
Wy0lUjP9aa	It does sound like it. When a guy raise his eyebrows, that is a way showing he is interested in you, but most men don't know they are doing it, which lets you know that he really does like you. Also, him staring at you is a great sign as well because he is interested in you as well. He brought up the "lefty" thing because he is pointing out something you both have in common. If you go there and he doesn't ask you out, wait better yet, when you go there, give him your phone number, he will call you if he likes you. If he is in a relationship he won't, but if he likes you, no doubt he will call you. <br>  <br>  Like when you are writing the bill give him the number as well and then walk away with a flirty smile on your face. Then you got your guy.|`|QilfSBfsaa	Since he has shown his interest on you, you may just do the same by talking to him friendly, then he will get the signal and date you out if he really likes you.|`|Sofk2yO8aa	yeah probably, go talk to him, it would be nice if more women approached the guy instead of the other way around|`|WlRrHYl2aa	probably. u shuld tlk 2 him|`|uP9M7Kzuaa	ask him to hang out sometime. get in a group of friends and go somewhere fun. luck! : )|`|FSOI5jbsaa	does he smile at you??? ;) that's another sign|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|lqQbVk2Daa	Give it a shot! You do not have to worry if he sais yes or no! Take a chance.

otTMXJvRaa	Hi Max,<br>  <br>  You sound like a nice and decent young lady of 14… almost 15.  Let’s call the guy you want to date “Romeo”, OK? <br>  <br>  I'd say that 16 or 17 is typically a good age for young ladies to start serious dating… but that’s just my opinion.<br>  <br>  Romeo’s probably a nice guy, or you wouldn’t be interested in him.  <br>  <br>  However, your Mom is 100% responsible for taking care of you, feeding you, housing you, protecting you, and she pays all of the bills. She gets to decide everything… especially when you can start dating Romeo.  Period.  Case closed.  <br>  <br>  It really doesn’t matter what anyone on this board thinks, or what Romeo thinks, or what any of your friends think.  It also doesn't matter if all of your friends are dating. <br>  <br>  Consider this: Do you think that kids at age 11 should be allowed to drive a car on the public roads with the rest of the adults? No, me either. Driving a car is very dangerous, and it requires responsibility and good judgement. The DMV gets to decide how old a person must be to get a driver's license.<br>  <br>  Just like driving a car, dating is also an adult activity. It requires responsibility and good judgement. So, your Mom gets to decide when you can start dating Romeo or having a serious BF.<br>  <br>  I notice that you never mention your Dad.  Is there a Dad in your life?  It’s a fact that young girls without a Dad in their lives are more prone to be looking for male comfort in BF’s… and much  more likely to get pregnant.  Perhaps that’s one of your Mom’s concerns.<br>  <br>  You can still discuss the dating age issue with your Mom, since you claim to be so mature. However, be advised that one measure of maturity is the way you react to reasonable restrictions being placed upon you by your Mom… your teachers… or your boss when you get a job.  <br>  <br>  Here are some examples of both good and bad methods of communicating with your Mom…<br>  <br>  Bad:<br>  "Hey… Bee, Cee, and Dee are already dating and kissing. I wanna date too!!"<br>  "I'm mature enough to date!!!"<br>  "Stop treating me like a baby!!!"<br>  Then stamp your feet, storm off to your room, slam the door, and pout for the rest of the day.<br>  <br>  Good:<br>  "Mom, can you tell me about how you and Dad first met? What did you do on your first date?"<br>  "Maybe it's good that I'm not dating much yet. Dee was in tears last week about her BF… he's acting like a creep. Mom, how can I spot a creep?"<br>  "At what age were you allowed to date, Mom?"<br>  "My plan is to save myself for marriage, and the other girls laughed at me. But won't saving myself for marriage be a good way to weed out the jerks and losers, Mom?"<br>  "An older girl said I won't be able to keep a guy interested without sex. I don't believe her, because no decent guys will date her… only creeps ask her out. I only wanna date decent guys."<br>  "Hey Mom… how about if I visit with Romeo at the park or the mall? We really like each other. You can meet him, and you’ll see he’s nice."<br>  <br>  Listen to your Mom's input. Don't respond immediately to her comments… sit there for a few seconds and then say "Wow, that's good… thanks!"<br>  <br>  Your Mom knows that there are some guys out there (young and old) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. Guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Your Mom wants to make sure that you are old enough and mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No". <br>  <br>  Your Mom also knows that you could meet a nice guy and you both really do think that you love each other, and after a few weeks or months you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together... and perhaps have sex. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. Your Mom wants to make sure that you are old enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.<br>  <br>  Your Mom probably thinks that having sex when you are not married is simply wrong. She knows that having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special.<br>  <br>  Listen to your Mom’s advice. By refusing to participate in premarital sex, you'll find out pretty quickly if the guys you are dating just want to get into your pants… or if they truly respect you, your body, your heart, your soul, your feelings, your values… and your family. <br>  <br>  Don't tell your Mom that you think her advice is dorky. Do you honestly think you know more than she does? That will only serve to reinforce her concern that you might be too young to date or have a BF.<br>  <br>  Take a quick look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions. <br>  <br>  Max... crushes/love/kissing/sex are wonderful intimate expressions that can all be compared to fire.<br>  <br>  Both intimacy and fire can be dangerous if used improperly. Your Mom is old enough to use fire safely (such as an outdoor BBQ gas grill), and she is also old enough to handle intimacy properly. <br>  <br>  Just like you are not allowed to play with fire... you and some Romeo should not be seriously dating or intimately kissing too young... because that type of intimacy naturally leads to sex.<br>  <br>  When used improperly, you know that fire can cause serious damage. Intimacy, when used improperly, can also cause serious damage... such as heartache, pregnancy, and STD's.<br>  <br>  Don't be too eager to play with fire, Max.<br>  <br>  Always call the Fire Department (your Mom) for assistance if a problem with fire (intimacy) develops... no matter how small the problem might appear to be. Small problems can quickly become large problems if they are not handled properly.<br>  <br>  Max, your Mom wants you to date nice guys who will treat you with dignity and respect while you are having innocent fun together during your youth. Honorable guys who would not ask you to do anything inappropriate… like sneaking out of the house, or taking off you clothes. <br>  <br>  Long term, your Mom wants you to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. A guy who will be proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your Mom and the rest of your family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is honorable and is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.<br>  <br>  You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. That is much more likely to happen if you start dating too early.<br>  <br>  And, you do not need to rush things. Enjoy your youth. Don't worry if your friends are all "hooking up"... you don't need to do any of that nonsense. If your friends have all had BF’s, then they’ve probably already experienced severe heartache and shed bucketloads of tears… problems that you have mostly avoided thus far.<br>  <br>  Also, don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry!<br>  <br>  Your Mom knows that you will be really happy when you are older, and you look back over your life... happy that you made the right decisions about these issues when you were young... because you were mature enough to make the right decisions.<br>  <br>  That's probably the big picture your Mom is looking at here, Max.<br>  <br>  Can you see the dating issue a little bit from your Mom's perspective now? If so, then you're ready to discuss dating and BF issues with her in a logical and rational manner… which will confirm that you know her concerns are valid, and you can promise be a good young lady.  But don’t expect her to cave in and let you start dating early.  Personally, I wouldn’t cave in and allow dating… but I might let Romeo come over and visit for an afternoon… and give him a lecture on what not to expect from my daughter. <br>  <br>  Now, go give your Mom a big hug. Thank her for caring so much about you.<br>  <br>  Take care and God bless,<br>  - Charlie
MvMMIxjIaa	he was prob feeling low when he txt you now he has found something to occupy his mind. I bet he txt back tomorrow!  Dont txt him back till u hear form him again. You prob sounded too cheerful for his liking too! If you dont want him back dont fret! He' hurting leave it be.|`|JjsArGujaa	I don't know but you should sent him a completely random text and then he'll text back and be like what?! and be like oh i didn't mean to send that to you, sorry.. I do it all the time (: haha then maybe a conversation can go on from there.. if he ends up texting back. lol good luck!|`|h0Oyxk2paa	his battery probably died or he did not hear his phone beep like you|`|CB15kchkaa	Read your question as an outsider and you'll find your answer.|`|fzDqXTPDaa	Just look down,just below their waist line.
juSJrU4waa	I'd raise the baby and cry everyday. Although I wouldn't be able to control my emotions, I'd be able to control and raise the most beautiful newborn she gave to me before she passed on.<br>  <br>  And of course I'd remember her every day for the rest of my life through our child.|`|28708e44a74e534c3bc9c9ad362c928aaa	As a divorced man who gets to see his 2 girls for a weekend every 2 weeks because of this fantastic UK law we have, I would take on the responsibility without any doubt. Your children should mean everything to you, there is no greater joy than to hold a newborn baby, I still remember the day both  of mine were born as if it were yesterday and it was truly the worst day of my life and the hardest thing I have ever done to leave the house I shared with them. So my answer would be that there could be only one answer, there cannot be something else, the child will need a parent, and you are that.|`|HdCo22Ggaa	i may be a bit young but i think i am older mind wise =p either way i would take care of the baby especially if my girlfriend died to bring her into the world i would cherish her even more if that's possible since its what she left before she passed on.|`|6t1CClfQaa	well if i ever found out my girlfriend was pregnant u would never see me again or u would see me jumping off a building but i would be glad 2 raise a child if it were mine because it was ur fault that the baby was in the would so i would man up|`|aErUKUvVaa	uhm... of course I would take care of her/him.  its part of ME gdi..... and i'd be crushed that this happened.  apparently this is not a personal experience for u - otherwise u couldnt ask the ? right?  someone close to u go thru this? or are u prego and having issues?  either way, help ur friend make the right choice, or seek assistance urself... good luck......|`|WCM3j0yTaa	I'll take care of the child and never marry again.............but before this situation comes i'll try to take some precautionary measures to avoid pregnancy.|`|6NdC58n8aa	A stand-up guy would love and care for that child.|`|SmOefD5Raa	Of course I would care for my child.|`|HcWJwx0Baa	Yes the child would be in my care <br>  <br>  but maybe I'd get a Paternity Test just to be sure|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Umm yea. I think this goes without saying if you are asking MEN and not BOYS!|`|os6FaEBlaa	I would raise the baby, because I know that's what my girlfriend would want. I would also double up all my efforts to give the newborn the best life I can.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Assuming that it was a planned pregnancy and that we were in love I would absolutely keep the baby. I would be pretty devastated by the loss of my girlfriend, so I would rely on my parents and friends to help me out a lot in the beginning. But the child would forever be a reminder of the woman who I loved and lost.<br>  <br>  If it was an accident and an unplanned pregnancy, I would probably put the baby up for adoption. If it was a kid that neither of us really wanted or were ready for I think that's what I'd do. It might sound cold, but I think it's a better solution (for the kid) than me raising a baby I don't really want out of guilt.|`|HimBbU6caa	Raise my child and I would always remind them of what a wonderful mother he/she had.|`|99Te46cVaa	child's care and security is guaranteed|`|J14tPA9Eaa	take care of my kid..... duh|`|tW8fh4IGaa	I don't even want to imagine a tragedy like this, but of course I would raise the child. In fact, the child would probably mean even more to me since it would be all I had left of my wife/girlfriend.|`|tk4PLUvnaa	yes, i'd take on rasing the kids myself. who else would take her kids? her parents? they didn't do a good job of watching their own kids. pregnant 17 year olds is not good parenting in my book. OOPS.|`|cvDeJPnmaa	No question whatsoever, I would raise the child.|`|qV8Vz36Iaa	I would not have a choice, my wife would kill me when she found out about it.|`|Nage3N1Faa	I would take on the responsibility of the kid.<br>  And make sure that that child is loved..|`|eMc9eLBtaa	yes i would take care of the child!!|`|CzS1EiV9aa	That would depend on if her parents would help.  Couldn't do it alone.|`|NXQHQ9z2aa	I would raise my child
fYcYPyR3aa	People can lead totally normal lives with holes in their heart, not all need to have something done to it, my cousin in 35 with a hole in her heart. She is totally healthy and my best friend's sister has one too and she's fine. If she's 19 and nothings been done about it already, I doubt she'll have to|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	A hole in her heart? Yes, people do recover from that. It usually requires surgery, though.|`|JEm4cqEKaa	You are talking about an actual hole in her heart? If so, check out Brian from Backstreet Boys, he had or still has one.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	Like a literal one of figuratively? Like heart broken or a health issue. But yes she can recover from both... But if its a health issue she will probably always have heart issues and have to be monitored.|`|trxEyVRLaa	Usually holes in hearts are from birth, so unless the hospital have said they need to operate on it which tends to be like aged 6-16 then I doubt anything is wrong|`|gCPu04gTaa	Shouldn't this be under health if it is a real hole?
UtrgRjTeaa	I wouldn't love them any less, but I would find a way to let them know they might want to take a shower first.<br>  <br>  I think that keeping oneself clean is essentially basic courtesy to a loved one. If he/she wants you to go down there, he/she sort of has an obligation to make it enjoyable for you. But at the same time, if they aren't clean once or twice, just let them know and they'll usually fix it.<br>  <br>  (Bonus: You can invite them to take a sexy shower with you, and clean them yourself!)|`|2LYIMahxaa	Yes I would, if I where a shallow person who has lost touch with my own humanity.
qRtYPAUwaa	Wow.  You asked a question.  I can't answer this though since I probably don't meet your standards of what a good friend is.|`|eth48m7Iaa	a true friend will be there for you no matter what. even if you lose touch for a few years and get in contact again you will still be friends. nothing can come between you.|`|QilfSBfsaa	Totally agree with you, that's what people says "A friend in need is a friend indeed".
0dMp7A3aaa	Asking another boy for their number isn't that hard, but their are ways around doing it yourself if you're too uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Try a hand-written note or get a trusted friend to ask them for you if you're too shy to accomplish this yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|VZ6HMFnLaa	just flirt with him and he'll ask u|`|0M6DSPQPaa	Just ask them for their number...<br>  <br>  Be bold and go after what you want! :)|`|ed0955174428e55e7e6205da49319b6eaa	Ask them for their number. Don't wait on a guy or you'll be sitting by the phone waiting for him to call while he's out having a good time. Or you could get one of your guy friends to start calling you and let the guys you're interested in know it. Most guys want what they can't have. If they think you are in a relationship, they want you, too.
19fa39a2ed4e38229aee162e273509bcaa	too long to read sorry|`|qLvhoRpsaa	Well, first do not look at him and pity him and feel that you are "good for him....he just needs someone to love him!" He is not a puppy. Care or love him because you love him, not because you think you are the answer to his life.<br>  <br>  Your Mother's comments about his "baggage" have the ring of a woman who has been in that position and regrets it. That is on her. She is only trying to have you avoid grief. I am a parent of teenagers and know that is impossible. <br>  <br>  Have feelings for him for the right reasons or don't pursue this any longer. Be his friend. Kiss him. Date him. Be honest with your Mother. Most importantly, be honest with yourself. <br>  <br>  Nobody should ever feel the need to save someone else, nor should we want to. Empathy and compassion are more appropriate. <br>  <br>  I hope you both the best of luck.<br>  <br>  Peace:)|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	i would ask how old you are and he is, first.<br>  Okay now that I got the ages.<br>   I would say its okay to be his friend, if they have some group activities and you want to go with him I don't think your Mom will have a problem.<br>  I will warn you though in a year, you might change your feelings  towards him and then he will feel you let him down and you will feel guilty.<br>  So think twice about getting too serious.<br>  But like I started dating a guy when I was 18 that had a rough background but he made a wonderful husband and father of our 4 kids.. so each case has to be looked at individually.|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	Just stay friends for now, no use making you mom upset. Your still very young and have a long future ahead of you. School is more important anyways at your age. When you get older and you both still feel this way. then I would spend the excess brain power trying to work things out.|`|BiRujg8Baa	Girl I say go 4 it just don't tell ya mother ur datin him yet 2 c how things work all he need is sum1 there for him and you have been there as a friend y not try as a girlfriend|`|AN9PdKmgaa	sorry but your mom is right/. You really don't know how he will act because you haven't known him long enough.|`|jBuu657raa	First of all it sounds to me like you are great for each other even if only in a friendly way.  He's helping you to see the rough parts that are part of this world, and you're helping him by being a stable someone that cares about him.  <br>  <br>  Your mother is right that sometimes people with "baggage" are hard to be in relationships with, but then again, people who are emotionless are also hard to be in relationships with.  Your mother may also be concerned because, well, she's your mother and that's just what they do.<br>  <br>  You're a sophomore and therefore able to make most of your own decisions... and as a junior I would think he's able to do the same.  If your friendship has flourished like you say it has, and if you're both sincerely interested in having a serious relationship, I say you should go for it.<br>  <br>  Your mother may not be happy with you at first, but I'm sure when she's sees that it is successful, she will be happy for and supportive of both of you.|`|pK8OTweNaa	go for it and just sit down with your mom and tell her the feelings you have for him and that even if she disagrees about it just show respect for you're feelings b/c she can try to keep the relationship from going that far but shell never be able to change your feelings|`|LvWgMLEGaa	Tell your mom. She likes him. It may piss her off in the beginning but at least you won't have to lie about THAT.|`|3mIHxillaa	If you like each other, than date. Easy. Your parents aren't the ones dating him...|`|liid9ZTqaa	sorry|`|3j6WdOX5aa	Just chill and keep being friends.|`|osj6pGzJaa	Realize that when you get involved with a person with an unresolved past being friends with them is not the same as being with them at a more intimate level.   The more intimate you are with a person, the more you will get drawn into their world....good, bad or indifferent.<br>  <br>  What you DON'T want to do is get into a situation you realize that you cannot deal with and then end up having to hurt him even more because you didn't really know what you were getting into.<br>  <br>  Honestly, getting involved with someone like this will take the patience and understanding of a saint and the enduring selflessness of Jesus Christ himself.  If you can be that person for him, then go for it.|`|uQZQTAAlaa	Oh my boy am I glad I'm going to answer this question. Look at one point you're going to have to tell your mom about your relationship with Nathaniel. Don't worry about it too much. Just like you told Nathan how you felt about him tell your mom that even though Nathan has had a harsh past tell her that you know he's the kind of person who wouldn't let his emotions get between your relationship. You also have to tell her that Nathan needs someone to love him. Tell her sincerely and slowly....she just might understand. If not, I am dearly sorry. But I doubt that will happen. A mother should know what her daughter wants. Feel better.<br>  <br>                     Alexandra P.              Hope I Helped ;)|`|r4OC8R9haa	Tell your mom. His baggage really has nothing to do with her. She wouldn't have to deal with it. If you like him and he likes you, then date. Your mom's opinion may matter, but you have to make your own choices.|`|NxRlxe7taa	Just date the guy and see where it goes!<br>  If you′re mom can still stop you from seeing a guy, I′m guessing you′re under 16, so you won′t be planning a family just yet.<br>  He sounds like a good guy, give it a chance.|`|7faxOCStaa	First of all, your mom is probably just concerned over your well being, I'm sure she means well.<br>  <br>  Second, if people with "baggage" were never allowed to be in a relationship, there would be an awful lot of lonely people out there.  Just because somebody comes with a history, doesn't necessarily mean that they're damaged emotionally, or can't function like everyone else.<br>  <br>  But also, it doesn't mean that they're NOT affected by their past.  If you're seriously about taking your friendship further, it would be best to take it very slow just so that you can see how his emotional involvement would transfer from a friendship into a more intimate relationship.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're pretty young since you're concerned over your mother's permission to date him or not.  If so, all the more reason to take it slow.  Because of his hard past he might be more fragile than other people.<br>  <br>  Also, I think that you need to tell your mom about your relationship, whether or not she approves of it or not.  She will love you no matter what, but will be more hurt and more distrustful of both of you if you keep it a secret.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CFPyF2eoaa	4 months isnt too long of a time you have to realize..i mean, you dont know him THAT well.for all you know he could be one of those people that doesnt open up until a while..your mom could be right or you could be right equally.however, your mom is right in that there will probably be emotional problems and it may not last long, but if you think you can deal with it..then id go for it i guess.also..i know you dont think hes gay..but dont miss signs that he is just because your trying to convince yourself hes not|`|GPAidQs1aa	omg that is so sad i'm so sorry but the thing that i hate the most in parents is when they don't let you date who ever you want have him over and get your parents to really know him so they will like him then i am sure they will let you go out with him with no doubt you just need to prove to them that he is an awesome kid like the way you see him you know? hope this helps  and hope you get him! and that is so sad ( his background) xoxorissixoxo|`|e4S1biI5aa	I think you should be more then just a friends even if your mom dose not approve he dose sound like he needs some one to love and care for him but watch out because when things go sour you could lose a friend good it happened to me in 5th grade when me and my friend date for a week because she wanted to step it up but then after that week she we were done dating each other, by the end  the 8th grade we stopped seeing each other, so to make a long story short watch out|`|zGNJGD4haa	Hi !! Try to talk with your mom & tell her that you do like him & he likes you too & please just give him a chance,just because someone had baggagee which i haven't met anyone yet who doesn't. That does not mean he is a bad guy cause everyone has had something haapen in their life that was & is bad,like you said he just needs for someone to love him no matter what, it sounds like to me jst like what you said (he needs love) Everyone needs to take that chance or you will not ever know. Take Care <br>  PS. I hope that this helps you out???
pEfEOuu9aa	AWW that sucks but you need to be strong  and just get yourself a guy friend and move on ..
5vv5AYDgaa	He will understand if you are having a bad day and need someone to talk to. If he doesn't think that you wanting to be around him is good, he wouldn't have given you the chance to get to bf/gf territory.<br>  <br>  Leave him a message on his phone, and go find a friend to talk to about it. If he asks later, just say he was the first person you thought of that could calm you down after trouble. Makes him feel wanted and explains the phone calls.<br>  <br>  If it bothers you, then stop. If it doesn't bother him, you have no reason to be bothered. It all depends on the guy. Some guys are more clingy than girls.

0wdEcNk1aa	It is my opinion that your husband likes to engage in "breath control" during intercourse. This can be an extreme type of sexual play that should NEVER be engaged in without the consent of both partners. Obviously you do not enjoy it, so you are going to have to confront him head on about how much you dislike it. You might also want to do a little research on "breath play" or "breath control" before you do so. There are very important rules that need to be followed for this type of play and not following them can lead to death. Sometimes it leads to death even when the rules are followed. "Breath play" is a dangerous form of play and should never be taken lightly. Make sure your husband is aware of the dangers. <br>  <br>  When you are ready to speak with him about this, make sure you choose a time when you are not engaged in sexual activity. You need to present it to him during a quiet moment (like after dinner) when you have time to discuss it. If after the discussion he does it again, you might have to re-examine your relationship. Because it is not weird, many people enjoy participating in this kind of play, both giving anf receiving, but it is what we call "edge play" in the BDSM lifestyle. It is called that because you are walking on the extreme edge between life and death!|`|7IbT8cUiaa	Tell him loud and clearly- that he is risking your life, and if he does this again you will not have sex with him- and make sure you don't. This is serious.|`|egpVC6uMaa	Stop having sex with him for a while, until he gets it together. You can die or be brain dead if he keeps this up...stop condoning this crazy risky behavior!|`|4RgXh3ftaa	Do you two have kids? Maybe he doesnt want you to be too loud.. If he does it again get on top of him and do the same to him:)|`|DzAFT8VDaa	He is asphyxiating you!  This must stop immediately or you will die eventually.  You need to OPEN your mouth before you have sex with him again and tell him that he cannot do that and if he does, he will have a bloody hand missing a lot of flesh.<br>  <br>  TALK TO HIM NOW!|`|gZdKOms8aa	Dangerous habit; he could accidently kill you. he needs therapy and if that doesn't work,i would drop him.|`|9BsyKN9haa	Next time pinch him HARD! or bite his hand!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Yeh I have heard of this it supposed to make your orgasm more explosive but its supposed to work when YOU climax not him.<br>  People have died doing this in sex, I would refuse sex with him if he wants to continue playing dangerous games like this, you could end up on the morgue table.<br>  He sounds deranged is he on drugs ?|`|498JdszFaa	That is very inconsiderate and dangerous as well. He seems a dangerous psycho to me or at least someone with risky control issues. If that's all there is to tell, you should talk to him and tell him you don't want that anymore. I hope he'll never do it again.<br>  <br>  If there is other stuff going on, you should check out this link and decide for yourself if you want to stay in such a relationship. Please take some time checking this out. We sometimes tend to push stuff out of our consciousness.

wovoZ5Z0aa	It sounds like he sees a future with you, but he understands the strains of a long distance relationship more than he wishes he did.  Right now the logistics are hard, for both of you.  <br>  <br>  As to how long you should hang in there, only you can decide.  If it is appropriate for your relationship, you might decide to say, "I know you're not ready to commit, but I'll need to know if we have a future in XX months.  You might consider discussing one of you moving closer to the other.
3Y1rL5Vfaa	hard to say. <br>  <br>  <br>  i think he does like you but if you dont like him...<br>  <br>  Welll heres what i do.<br>  <br>  Just smile and giggle if needed and look away.<br>  AND! Always look for someone else to talk to.<br>  start slowly igonoring him.<br>  <br>  IT should WoRK!|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.
GIQTN6pkaa	Hi,  <br>  <br>  You should just go for it and tell the boy you like him and hope for the best that he likes you.<br>  <br>  If you want to test the water and be friends first you just need to sympathise with him about your freind screwing him over.<br>  <br>  hope this helps?

WwNEDi4Kaa	It definitely seems like hes digging you. De is probably interested. If you are interested go for it. Do something he does to you to him. Show him you are going for it as well. I say he does probably like you.
tm2gnYblaa	Dont spread rumors <br>  Trust me, in the long run your dignity will mean so much more than 'getting her back'. In the end if you can say your hands were clean, you will feel much better about yourself. Let her make a fool of herself by being an immature girl who probably has a low self esteem and in return tries to tear down others like yourself.

8ygky5g4aa	I agree $100-$150 depending on your area is probably fair.  You can check around and see what other musicians charge in your area.

Multiply the number of hours spent by a fair wage ($4-6 depending on your location, skill level and the enjoyment you'll get out of it).<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd add some money to cover travel expenses too.  The trip there *and* back.<br>  <br>  Then subtract for the cost of the meal, if you've been invited to the reception.<br>  <br>  Juggle the numbers depending on how close you are to the couple and how competitive you want your pricing to be (Do you want to do this a lot or not?)<br>  <br>  Quote your Brides the lowest figure you come up with and add (with a smile) "...of course, I'll accept a tip too, if that's not enough for you"<br>  <br>  Quote the prices face to face so you can get a feel for their reactions.  Remember, you can always come down in price but once you've offered a quote it's really hard to go UP.<br>  <br>  Consider the percentage of the total wedding budget.  A typical wedding can cost as much as $50,000 easy.  Asking for $100 means you made up a whopping .2% of the total.

lNlL0Ag2aa	If she makes the first move and flirts with us and tries to get our attention. Guys love that because we get turned on when we see a girl who have a cursh on us, especially if it is a girl we're secretly crushing on too.<br>  <br>  It makes the girl look very attractive when she approaches the guy first and makes the first move, and guys love girls with that kind of confidence and boldness. We start crushing on the girl when she does it because it makes her act like she wants to get the man she wants, and guys yearn to see that. <br>  <br>  It's all because guys (like girls) want to see that the girl they're secretly interested in, is also interested back so we love it if the girl shows they're into them.
gmTXOW0Yaa	Sounds like this girl might like you...but to find out who she is or what she is like you should for sure talk to her!<br>  If someone is sitting next to her, I wouldn't exactly dump them off the seat, but when no one is by her I would go for it!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)<br>  Lauren Evalynn|`|gCPu04gTaa	LOL.

ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	That is a pretty good amount of time so it may take a while. My ex and I broke up about 3 months ago and I am just now starting to get over it (BUT it was a really bad breakup that was dragged out for a long time and I found out he lied to me a lot). If it was just a casual relationship and you didn't have sex with him or anything, it shouldn't take too long. Honestly the best thing to do for now is just get him out of your life for a little while. If it was meant to be, it will work out later on. But don't dwell on it or hold your breath. Also being broken up with through a text was harsh...you deserved better than that. He was a coward for doing that to you. It may help you to write out a list of the bad qualities about him (only bad, no good). It may help you understand why you broke up and help you realize he wasn't the best guy for you.|`|VwG2lhcNaa	A) 5 and half months is not a long time<br>  B) He broke up with you over TEXT... how mature<br>  C) He ain't your soul mate honey<br>  <br>  You will get over him within a couple of weeks.|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	You're really crying eh......... nobody really helping much.....

Like if you still talk to him every now and then, then it might take a little longer. There is no set time limit though. Just be patient with yourself!
O3gpJiwsaa	I'm probably being a complete hypocrite saying this because I am the same way.. but don't wear your heart on your sleeve. Keep a wall up, there are just some guys out there that you need to do this with. And you get two rewards - 1, if he is just messing with your head you won't get as hurt.. 2, if he really IS interested, he will try to break down your wall! The harder you push back, the more harder he'll push if he's into you. <br>  And I know that is easier said than done, but it's better than a heartbreak. If you think there's more of a chance that he'll end up going back to his ex.. then just try to look at everything negative about him rather than positive. That'll also help you with your "wall".
Qbm3Vpilaa	I think that ,yes your still friends but maybe you both moved too fast  sometimes engaging in sexual activity with a close friend does change things ,neither one of you thought that you'd be more than what you are to each other..give it some time both of you need to think on it .

We know about his behavior, but what are you doing?  It seems a little strange that he's just started doing all these things for no reason.  Men always feel like they have a reason for their behavior.  Always.  It sounds like he is responding to something your doing or saying.  So my question is, what are you doing?  Does he think your flirting?  Do you laugh at a lot at what he says?  Do you stare back at him?  What?  Also, when you say. "he talks to me everyday..." it doesn't sound like you mind it, or at least you're not ignoring it.  I think you respond quite a bit.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think he feels like he has a chance with you because you are responding to him in some way.  I'm not saying you're doing anything bad or misleading, but take a look at your behavior and if you really want to be sending certain messages.  If you don't want him to continue to behave this way, then you need to be very forceful and direct about it.  Tell him it's not cute or acceptable.|`|DTGZJ8T6aa	are you asking about the kid you teases you, your best guy friend, or both??|`|n336SjRiaa	sounds like he is just annoying you. where is he in social circles? is he justa creepy weirdo? stay shy and sweet, and say stop it, seriously. not mean like. then maybe, if he has real feelings he will be serious about it. dont smile and joke around too anymore.|`|2u8KTDr5aa	If you like him, go for it.

Whether he likes you or not, you can't go wrong or make a fool of yourself by saying hey. And if the conversation flows naturally from there, that's  a good sign. If not, you didn't make a fool of yourself, and only wasted about 5 seconds of your life.|`|IPXiN0V3aa	i think you should start a conversation with him about anything to get him more interested. he probably thinks u like him a little but isn't sure. i would think that you liked me (or him)|`|BHsswQpfaa	yess. just say hey and smile.<br>  or just smile.. whichever, do both.<br>  <br>  i think He liked you...<br>  you showed no interest...<br>  so he moved on...<br>  so don't mess up his head by just saying hi or being friendly the one time..<br>  if you like this guy alot, then open up to him, be friendly<br>  and you never know what will happen ;)

Anyway, I'm trying to help her out so I just need a guy's perspective. What should I tell her?"<br>  <br>  When he gives you his answer, show him that you're genuinely appreciative of his opinion. Then comment that he seems like he's cool and knows how to get along with people. Compliment him and then tell him your name. Tell him that he looks so quiet but he seems like he could be really cool once you get to know him. And say that you can tell because you're the same way. <br>  <br>  From there you're having a nice conversation off to a good start.|`|cVWnXcSOaa	if u would message him i would just b like.. i heard this was ur #. i was just wondering if it was really u or if they told me a wrong #. lol.. ya i dont no how 2 approach bcz i get nervous..|`|juczLKDEaa	Well why don't you use a pick up line like:<br>  <br>  ~Are you a broom? Cause you just swept me off my feet.<br>  <br>  or something stupid like that so you can both laugh.|`|uLPnHD9oaa	hmm "accidently on purpose" sending him a message could look obvious and doing something stupid infront of him could just make you look like a kn*b but keep thinking
oJREkyDDaa	It sounds like he might like you as well. Ask him if he likes you and i'm sure he'll say yes.<br>  Good luck anyway.
9oiZ6Rmbaa	People that do these things don't change.  If she wants you as a friend now it is so she can take advantage of you in some way.  <br>  <br>  If she doesn't acknowledge what she has done to you and your family, apologize and make amends, then don't let her back into your life, if not for you, for your family's sake.  This is not always easy to do.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|TNOQk3Fjaa	Friends come and go and this one you can do without. She doesnt respect you and she never will.
FiHuGwr4aa	I can see both sides. His side: is that he was probaly not supposed to know who started it. But then again if you guys are really close friends then he should have told you. Just talk it out with him, and tell him that you need to know who is starting the rumors so you can put a stop to it. Let me know how it goes(:|`|I6dIkhbOaa	I would feel the same, I would feel betrayed. I would also have to wonder/consider if this "friend" of yours isn't making it all up. If you know for a fact that the rumors are going around, maybe you should wonder if he is the one making up the rumors that are going around . . . something to think about . . .|`|QLjjfwRfaa	If he is a true friend, than he will tell you the truth. Have you considered that he might be the one spreading the gossip? Consider all options in this situation. <br>  <br>  Tell him that as your friend, he needs to let you know the truth and if he does not do so, your friendship will be severly damaged.|`|0jt4eX61aa	If you truely were sleeping around then you shouldn't be surprised that somebody has some juicey info on you...he may just not want to feel like a rat, taddling and all, he shouldn't have even brought the topic up knowing that you'd be very curious about it|`|PwQn0Oixaa	No...he's protecting himself.<br>  <br>  He knows if he tells you, you will confront someone, and then that someone will know your friend told...thus he ends up with drama.<br>  <br>  He should not have mentioned the rumors though.  Better to keep your mouth shut and stay out of other people's affairs.|`|lKdD5Rblaa	I would be angry I would think that he may be the person spreading the rumors; if he is unwilling to tell you who said it he has to have a reason.(maybe there are no rumors maybe he made it all up)|`|PUumsOqBaa	I wud  get mad if a friend was trying to protect some 1 who is trying to harm u by spreading rumours about you, especially if you and your  friend were really close. <br>  <br>  Hope This Helped :) :)|`|0XqaN5csaa	maybe he is "protecting" the other person because it is a close friend to him too...just a thought|`|ZbxcHDh2aa	He probably knows you too well and wouldn't like to tell you because he knows you will be curious and confront the person who is spreading the rumors and they will probably ask you who said it ...in other words he doesn't want to be a trouble-maker..yes i would feel the same, i have been through this situation before  not in your shoes but in your Friends...and it always causes a whole lot of trouble when i tell what so and so has said about this person..|`|jERevyR8aa	your "friend" is a jerk.<br>  if he wasnt going to tell you the names, why even tell you at all?|`|NEWbh3Plaa	Yes I would.  If he is supposed to be your friend he should tell you. He might be embarrassed about it though.  Maybe they are explicit rumors?  I hope not, but you never know.  Just tell him why you want to know, that it is very important to you.|`|Q1Qk3LDWaa	yesss yes i would, thats not very fair to you. its like when someone says im mad at you. but then will not proceed to tell you what for..lame<br>  just the whole thing is childish truely|`|IiSBK2znaa	I would probably get mad. especially if the friend was protecting someone but he might just be doing it to male sure this doesn't get to far.|`|Y3IvemoOaa	well that person isnt really ur friend if she wont tell you
gytWvw30aa	you should just threaten the person but not really do it. just be like "ooh, you're gonna get it." and make phone calls, warn his friends of what's going to  "happen" to him. then DON'T do it. it'll drive him INSANE!|`|fxXJZZRKaa	First I would like to know. Revenge on what??? What did he do to you? I know you made "long story short" but you made it just too short I wish Is saw the details. ANYWAYS, put gum on his seat, WHILE KNOW ONE especially him is looking. So then when he sits down he gets it all on his pants, nice and good. remember have the gum chewed and stretched out nice and big. :)|`|HZ5oY0sOaa	Don't listen to Ellebby, you could get in serious trouble for that. Really, even if you don't do it. If you're a guy, steal his girlfriend or flirt with her. If not, steal his friends.<br>  <br>  Revenge is not a good idea in the first place, though.
aITWZoQzaa	Sounds like you have a good plan.  Like you said, say it very casual.
IdtzdpqGaa	Just keep saying no, you wouldn't want someone like that anyway that doesn't respect someone elses relationship

Because even if you are not needy too him it might feel needy. Different people take things in differently. <br>  Communicate and Compromise.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	He either needs a little alone time without having to get your permission first, or he is hiding something and does not want to have to deal with you about it.|`|OhhKRahTaa	oh dear!|`|cf87f1aa28522c98acc4676433f4e725aa	If you live together and he left for four days then thats a problem.

762ZZOK8aa	If you can't think of anything negative that occurred during your relationship, besides the break up, I'd say keep talking and communicating and seeing where it goes.  He might have just missed talking to you, but he might also want to get back with you. Guys are difficult to read, but don't read too much into it, just wait and see what happens by opening the lines of communication again.  Good luck.

AA12091477	Kinda sounds like he either cheated on you or is very insecure with himself|`|06O8FaOjaa	PROBLEY HE DOESNT THINK YULL DUE IT O9R MAYBE HE JUS DOESNT CARE ABOUT YU AS MUCH|`|dPicgCgwaa	I know a lot of people think it's strange but I too am not bothered by cheating. I know that cheating is just an act of lust and that she loves meore than just sexually. I may not be the hottest guy around but I'm her best friend and no other guy can beat that. My girlfriend and I know that our relationship is just too strong to be broken by simple  acts of sexuality to other people.<br>  <br>  I hope that shed some light on your question.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Because it's possible that he simply doesn't care about the relationship anymore. Since it doesn't seem as though he would be hurt, or even angry, by you hypothetically cheating, it may be a way for him to say, "I'm done with this. Do what you like."<br>  <br>  Did you ask why he wouldn't be bothered? If you haven't yet, I'd suggest doing so when he's up for chatting with you.|`|HdCo22Ggaa	well the way he sees it i guess is you may go off with another guy but at the end of the night you will be with him O.o so you are cheating yet always coming back to him O.o your boyfriend is a strange one|`|HDwzj8Ukaa	maybe he wants to be a pologamist
SiZisNHGaa	Hmm it sounds like curiosity to me...<br>  She shouldnt have freaked out though...I personally think that porn is no big deal. You just need to talk to each other about what you want. I wouldn't get jealous in any event. Some girls are definately into it, I am most certainly not though.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should watch it together!<br>  Let the good times roll!|`|koP1PaVjaa	Sounds like you guys have to build some trust, and communicate about your sexuality. Porn is normal. Personally, gay male porn does nothing for me. Two guys getting it on doesn't turn me on. She sounds repressed a little. She's curious, but women are taught that porn is dirty and wrong. Talk to her. Tell her that just because you look once in awhile it doesn't mean you are not attracted to her. And maybe you could watch a porno together and add some spice to your marriage.<br>  <br>  And delete your cookies and history, they slow down your PC anyway.

lNlL0Ag2aa	If she makes the first move and flirts with us and tries to get our attention. Guys love that because we get turned on when we see a girl has a cursh on us, especially if it is a girl we're secretly crushing on too.<br>  <br>  It will make you look very attractive in his point of view if you approach that guy and make the first move because it doesn't matter what kind of guy he is, all guys love girls with that kind of confidence and boldness.<br>  <br>  If we were interested in the girl before, then we would start crushing on her even more when she makes the first moves because it makes her act like she wants to get the man she wants, and guys yearn to see that. <br>  <br>  It's all because guys (like girls) want to see that the girl they're secretly interested in, is also interested back so we love it if the girl shows they're into them.
hGWhzfFqaa	Sex becomes a big part of the relationship. It helps each person feel closer to the other and brings them closer together as a couple and not just physically.|`|3KAiV9zTaa	well as young as i am(16 by the way), and how at first i thought sex was no big deal in a relationship, after having my first sexual intercouse and from talking to others and my bf about it, sex is a big part of the relationship. a relationship can't just run on emotions alone in a relationship. for some it may be passable, but in other situations, it is the physical bond that powers the emotional mind at heart to express your feeling to your lover. It deepens the mind and the soul and the body. it makes the couples closer. there is always a reason to why couples just stop having sex. maybe he wants something new, he's just tired of the same old thing, or he's not feeling the love anymore. sex can always be spiced up a little. try it out.<br>  well...good luck.|`|jB6xN1Kiaa	after ur married yes|`|PwkYJoVgaa	well, personally i think that it's not that big in a relation hip but it can help be closer with that person. then again yes, you can still have a very good relationship with out it. but if your partner forces; thats not good.
3xMQW0A6aa	no you are not obligated (unless you feel that horribly guilty that you cant hold it in). first of all you were broken up. second of all, things now are just casual. its none of his business what you did during that time and i  wouldnt tell him. that might really cause some problems....|`|CgEQAgXhaa	If you're only casually dating, i don't see why you need to tell him.  If you were exclusive that would be a little different.
i3DPp2vdaa	well first don't ask him give him time and in the mean while hang out learn things about each other(that ya'll don't know already)|`|yXUtl0aHaa	Okay, make your move.<br>  Tell him you like him a lot as well, and you really want to date him,<br>  but it's his call especially just since he broke up with some girl that use to be your best friend.
K4SEYlBqaa	No. people see things to lightly now-a-days. There is nothing else you can do but "abandon" her =[ sadly talking is obviously not working in your case.. and 2 years i think that's a little ridiculous .. she is clearly in denial and naive. The only way she would see it's not only effecting her but also you and most likely your mother is if you give her "tough love." <br>  If you look at it ..you have been supporting this situation as much as she has because when he kicks her out you don't let her deal with it by herself. Believe me don't take her in and you should tell your mother to do the same because if you keep attending to her she may never realize what is really going on but if she has to struggle through it herself it will have a greater impact on her. She'll probably be upset with you guys at first but she would soon see how you have helped her =]<br>  i hope i helped and good luck xD|`|AA10639728	Tough Love. Sometimes you have to be firm with family members if you want to see them change for the better. If she was detoxing from alcohol withdrawals, you wouldn't give her alcohol to make her feel better. You would stand by your decision to help her STOP. This guy is like a drug to her. By letting her stay with you until he takes her back, you're enabling her. Tell her how you feel and make it clear that you do not support their relationship and will not help her stay in it. It's not abandonment, it's what she needs.|`|AA12398373	If you were to abandon her (as you put it) it would require you to give up on her completely, and cut off all ties with her under all circumstances.<br>  <br>  What you want to do is tell your sister that you won't be there to support her unhealthy choices anymore. You aren't abandoning HER, you are abandoning her choice to stay keep going back to this toxic relationship.<br>  <br>  You have already weighed in on what you think she should be doing, so it shouldn't be necessary to repeat it to her (I doubt that she wants to hear it again anyway)<br>  Just tell her that when she is ready to come to her senses you will be available to help her through.<br>  Just remember that she may leave him for good, and really mean it, and then decide to go back to him later on.<br>  It's her choice, but you don't have to pick her up when he kicks her out, you don't have to take her in, or give her financial support either.<br>  In a way you are enabling her to stay in this unhealthy relationship by taking her in and helping her until HE cools off and lets her come back.<br>  If she thought she was losing her support base for that she might start to consider thinking and acting for herself.<br>  <br>  SOMEBODY has to try something different.<br>  Otherwise, you ALL will stay on this merry-go-round.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Obviously, she cannot think for her herself or her boyfriend is having her completely dominated.  You already tried talking and I think it's now time for some actions.  Perhaps introduce her to some new friends will show her that she still has options and she can do better.  Of course, there is nothing you can do if your sister is madly in love with her boyfriend.  Love can be a curse.|`|KwNpyp3saa	There is no way you can do this withoug creating distance. She knows how you feel. It seems like her self esteem is low and the more you bad mouth him, the more she will cling to him. She needs some support right now and hopefully in time she will eventually see the light and leave him.
Gh0qq0s5aa	I feel your pain.  You have to get up the courage to speak to your parents and tell them exactly how you feel, in a respectful manner of course.  Being a cheerleader is fun but where is it going to take you? Not where you want to go.  You have to do what makes you happy.  If you are forced or feel forced to do something you will be forever miserable.  I think you have to make a choice between the cheerleading and the acting. If cheerleader camp is going to take up your whole summer and most of your time then you need to quit. You need to try out for the drama clubs and whatever else can get you into acting.  Yes, your parents may be disappointed and even angry but they cannot live your life for you. If they are as loving as you say they are they won't turn their back on you. It may just seem that way.  You'll just have to ride out the storm that will be created by your decision to pursue acting. And riding out the storm is not a bad thing. Be strong. You will handle it because you will be doing something that you seem very passionate about. Good luck to you. Hope to see you on the BIG SCREEN someday!|`|I2xILJtraa	You should be like hey mom has that talent agency called yet? or something i dunno good luck:)|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Well, you need to sit down with them and have a genuine adult conversation. You don't want to beg or sound like a child. The best way to convince them is to tell them you want to go to a college that has a great a theater program. You would like to pursue acting, but just to be on the safe side you are going to go to college so you have a back up plan. If you present your points to them, almost like a presentation, they are bound to listen. I am sure as long as you are going to college they will be happy. Also, this isn't a bad idea anyway. Sometimes even the best of actors and actresses can't make the big screen because sometimes it's just about who you know. You should have a backup plan with such an iffy choice for a major. However, I am sure that your parents will support you in your decision for a college. Be prepared for criticism though. If they try to talk about acting being an unstable career, then explain to them that's why you want a back up plan in order to ensure that you have a good future. If the acting thing for some reason doesn't work out as a lifelong career, it's still your passion. You will enjoy all of those classes and training. When you explain it to your parents this way, they will be more likely to understand. Remember, when you sit down with your parents, don't beg or cry or throw a fit or anything. Try to be an adult about it. If at first, they still aren't supportive, just tell them you would like them to think about it for a few days and then you guys can talk about it again. Get them a couple of brochures of a couple of colleges that you would like to attend. I would almost be willing to bet thatt they wouldn't have a problem with this plan. Well, good luck with everything.

You never know what might happen!!!!!<br>  <br>  good luck:)|`|92qUM1JBaa	First ask her if she likes you back If she does great stay with her if she doesn't well that's your choice.|`|fjWPhB8Daa	I'd say lets just be friends for now and when she's 16 then see if you still feel the same about her!|`|omvUWOPHaa	she seems a little shy.|`|QXYkNK6jaa	You need to sit down and talk to her. If you really do love her than you should wait for her. Love is always worth the wait. You should not go and try to find someone else because first off, that would give her the impression that you dont love her and I dont think you want to do that. <br>  <br>  Just talk to her and see what she thinks. Also talk to her about the party deal. See what you guys can work out. Maybe you can go to your cousin's for a while and her's for awhile so there for you can spend time together.|`|ePcNVX10aa	I think that you are way to young to even know what true love is.  You are just beginning to learn and in ten years you'll look back and realize that it was puppy love.  By the way... you should not be worrying about that. You should really focus on your school work because your spelling is horrible.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lABygQ1Taa	holy crap thats a hard one!  well if i were you ( oh by the way im 14 to so  yeah..imma girl)  well I would just like call her or sit her down and tell her how you feel.  Thats always the best choice.  and if she doesnt wanna be with you its her fault for missing out on something great.  cause i can tell you care(well duh its right there im an idiot lol)  anywho  and if she doesnt see that, then she isnt right for you...  but yeah thats what i think.<br>  <br>  (had same problem with my old boyfriend)
IDfQko2Zaa	dress up really revealing and be all sweet and sickly<br>  maybe have a shower together, that would be good<br>  or like just act like a ****|`|7vBJGMvtaa	That is easy,here is my list: dress up in something sexy,like a tight leather skirt or pants and sweet perfume! nothing sexier than a clean woman,who can dress up! track pants is a sure turn off!it may be an even better question to ask guys what turns them off!because you got to remember you were turning him on when he met you so like in the movie"HITCHED" said "you have the person you want now its up to you to lose him or keep him by turning him on or off!<br>  in other words what were you doing when you met him to turn him on ?like how did you dressed back then?or how did you wear your hair?maybe you dressed in a black short mini skirt or high heels ,high heels turns most guys on ,especially red ones.nice perfumes turns most guys on ,not too much,or too strong,guys like a sexy girl period!|`|8pWFsDSHaa	Be super cute.. irresistable. Where a sunday dress and a ribbon in your hair. Also where lip gloss and whisper in his ear some secrets. ; )|`|6a8Ydw5Zaa	bite his  ear or lick it my girlfriend does that and it runs tingles threw my legs =]|`|wv4rOWqZaa	not that this is the gay section :)...(well you are asking "boys, how to turn him on?" :).<br>  <br>  But...idk, hint that you want sex...
CVvYhEfGaa	you didnt do anything wrong.<br>  Your trying to assure her your there for her! thats not bad.<br>  as for her, dont push her, she'll tell you when she's ready.<br>  Sometimes things from the past are just hard to talk about...
tGcNmDUZaa	Talk to her over fb message and also at school, just incorporate chat with her into your lives. When she is keen on talking to you, just say, hey can i have your number? and text her every few days, just keep in contact. Then you can ask her out or whatever you wanna do. This also gives you the oppurtunity to make sure you really like her. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Akdt5iOBG0SjUOSQ7Tyti_Hsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309122332AA1rZ4j">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|A8sLKBrzaa	What are you supposed to do? Hypnotize her to get her number? Girls like it when you are super mean to them. Just piss her off, then you move in for the kill!<br>  <br>  That is a surefire way to get a number!|`|AN9PdKmgaa	forget the not so obvious either you want her to know or you don't so if you do just tell her straight up ot shows self confidence
ACVKajUIaa	yer if theyre a late "developer" if u get want i mean then it cud be possible for them to not even be attracted to the hottest person on earth until that little spark is triggered lol
9QyrW2iCaa	Get the book, "He's Just Not That Into You."  Read it and take notes.  If you're STILL having "bad luck" email me.  Seriously!    : )|`|VqDCKoeIaa	I have had a couple relationships, but they only lasted a short time! I had the worst luck in all my relationships, until I found this site, <a href="http://www.buyluck.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.buyluck.net</a> and I bought Good Luck (I know it's stupid, but I thought, Hey, it's only $10). So the next day after I bought it, I was at school, and this new girl (Hailey) moved here from California, I introduced myself to her, and we became fast friends. A week later, I asked her out on a date to the movies. At the movies, I asked her to be my girl friend, and she said yes! We have been going out for 5 months now, and I couldn't be any happier.|`|tXqN5hORaa	Yeah, we can't all be incredibly attractive and lucky.
XLXncQu9aa	If what you are saying is true, this is definitely a no brainer.  You are 100% right that this woman is a freak.  Women like that have issues.  Either she thinks you are some kind of fool, or she really is that sick and twisted.  Now if your standards are that low, I suggest you pick them up and grab a clue.  She is someone you do not want to get involved with.  If you do, you will likely regret it or you may make a fool out of yourself.  Chances are this is either a prank, or she is seriously demented.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Leave her alone, your are a lot better off without someone that has issues like this person does.|`|0b5f07e5bab316afb60fcb47e579b84faa	I'm not a guy, but I think it's best to just be safe. She could have an STD or something.|`|RmQzb0Avaa	that's really freaky<br>  and what does she mean when she says<br>  "If you are not both totally nude and hard when I come in"<br>  i thought this was about you and her not you and someone and her<br>  <br>  shes weird<br>  i think you can get urself some other girl to do|`|QY2Bqvifaa	she could be a freak or it could be a set up, if you do go there, don't do what the note says. just wait with your clothes on and see if she comes in with a camera and like six people to laugh at you if you're naked.|`|iTUugOTLaa	She's probably having a good laugh with you pal.<br>  <br>  There's a 99% chance that she's F'ing with you here. And you are falling for all of it. Go ahead and make yourself ridiculous. Chances are, it's BS and you're gonna be there all alone.|`|PtUJNBFRaa	LMFAAAAAAAAAO AHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHHAHA!|`|bu67EEj4aa	Sorry but I just didn't catch that...

pemGyfnwaa	I was 23.|`|KV5ebqxWaa	17<br>  but im straight :D
koP1PaVjaa	First of all, when a guy gives you a gift- you don't ever have to give it back. Don't let a guy push you around like that. Second of all, you should realize that you are so much better off without him. He sounds like a jerk. So, what you should do is just have fun with your friends, try not to think about him, and feel sorry for his next victims.|`|h00bqU7baa	Oh I would be jealous too if my ex did that. I know what you feel because my ex flirts with so many girls I cant bear it and I start crying just go after him and take back whats yours.<br>  <br>  WHAT WOULD YOU DO<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmutB5WVoygzHfMuaXk0rG_D7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309153108AAlJgCs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|NiirnVYXaa	aww. <br>  guys in my school also use the "get some" but as in ***..it's honestly pathetic for a guy to do that.<br>  all i can say is to think of the break up as a good thing. <br>  you guys aren't still together for a reason and it's defenitly for the better. <br>  hang out with other guys and put yourself out there;keep looking, now's the toughest part but it'll get better soon. i promise.<br>  *and DON'T text him. it'll show that you still like him and he probably wants that.
hV5ctpkEaa	Well...<br>  -if you ever catch her looking at you and when you catch her she quickly looks away and maybe blushes<br>  <br>  -if she looks at you straight in the eyes when your talking to her<br>  <br>  -if she always laughs at your jokes no matter how pathetic!<br>  <br>  -if she always finds a way to make physical contact<br>  <br>  <br>  there just a few...hope they help! :D|`|U4V6TkZEaa	You can't. Women are hard to read, and they like it that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  You just have to be a man about it and ask her out.  If she doesn't like you, so what?  It is her loss.
TNjKwlA9aa	Me. Because most of the people who do that are looking for a bunch of people to say that they are hot. And about 99.9% of them put fake pictures of commonly faked emo girls. I could name most of the girls who they fake too. They are internet CELEBS.|`|jICPamTkaa	Me! It shouldn't matter what the hell others think|`|OXrzaW2Paa	me! it's like how insecure can u get to ask strangers what they think of them??<br>  **and i hate questions like"I NEED HELP!!!!!!"<br>  and it's like something about liking a 6th grader or something. haha peole r annoying :P
UtrgRjTeaa	Modern culture gives us two, totally contradictory, equally wrong ideas. The first one is the idea that looks are the MOST important thing, and that you should spend TONS of money on looking exactly how society wants you to look, and "ugly people" never succeed, etc. etc. etc. This incredibly strong message makes some people rebel and send out an equally strong counter-message, which is the idea that looks don't matter at all, and anyone who cares about looks is a horrible person, and that love should always always always be totally blind.<br>  <br>  Ugh.<br>  <br>  The truth lies somewhere in between. It's not important to conform to society's ideals of beauty, but it's also totally valid to listen to your body when it tells you who you are and aren't attracted to. Finding a satisfying relationship is about satisfying many different aspects of yourself -- finding someone you are compatible with intellectually, someone you have a strong bond with emotionally, someone you are comfortable with socially... and, yes, someone with whom you have chemistry physically!<br>  <br>  So, to get back to the question: It would be shallow if your ONLY reason for dating someone was because they were "hot." But it's NOT shallow to not be interested in someone if you don't find them attractive. That's paying attention to your needs and knowing yourself, and it's key to having a satisfying life.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uTdEdpAeaa	this is such a shallow question.|`|HMH3esdDaa	no your not shallow.<br>  looks are not everything in a relationship... but they r verrry importnt.<br>  If u r not physically attracted to someone then it is pointless being with them cuz u wont feel comfortable around them. Forget the haterz saying that your shallow, if they were in your position they would do the same<br>  <br>  hope this helps xxx|`|fc6bFYHvaa	Whoa, you must be ugly.
quHPxabZaa	sometimes it could be just a nervous habit, i do it-<br>  but if you think she is throwing out a signal, ask her?<br>  but only if you think it could go somewhere... you wouldn't want to damage your friendship.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	She's either shy,nervous or flirting.It depends on how she do it.|`|qXpxILnRaa	Yeah, she probably is just playing with her hair because she likes her hair. or maybe because she's interested in what you're saying or its just a habit that she has.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	It could mean just about anything.<br>  <br>  I do it without noticing and it doesn't mean anything.<br>  <br>  She could be flirting, bored, unconsciously doing it, just about anything.|`|m2dxbdHWaa	nothing or there bored with talking to you, or excited to talk to you depends.<br>  <br>  most likely nothing though.|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Nothing, standard procedure.  At the most she is a flirt.|`|PvSGrtzJaa	She want's to bang you!|`|VhODTzyuaa	They care about what the other person thinks of them.
W6pT1Wp3aa	most people frown on that aparently
KN4ZUNE0aa	well u should have called him back..he prbly thinks you dont like him.<br>  tell him that your not big on talking on the phone, apologize, and say we should deff hang out soon tho?..i love talking in person..<br>  txt him more<br>  call him anyways.<br>  just show that you still like him,|`|P3lNjcHzaa	uhhhhhh|`|gmefdkZsaa	tell him tat<br>  <br>  say that we should txt more often,|`|LT9BZmLNaa	then don't call him. just talk or text him.
RiVvH0vGaa	Just tell them that "ya I am wearing make up, why you have a problem with that?", if your friends be mean to you then you be mean too. Be bold my friend and face them , do what you want to do, don't care about what they say(its your life).|`|qMnuRO50aa	Unless you're really bad at putting on makeup, they're probably not making fun of you at all. They're just surprised to see you wearing makeup since you usually don't. I think you are just looking at the situation in the wrong light.|`|SzEP41kraa	do what makes you feel good. if you like it then wear it. and if they gotta problem with it fight the hel out of those bychess.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Wear make-up if you want to and then ask them what is the problem they have with it.|`|5OLj2qpbaa	Do what makes YOU feel the best.
qG3Ixgz9aa	Know how you feel girlie!  For me its Marriage, money, family, friends, bills and work.... UGH... i feel your pain! Oh and I am 27.|`|YTasscmKaa	Keep working at it. Law of averages says things have to even out. So, its bound to get better.|`|5jMNBO2naa	it doesn't<br>  take each problem one by one and look at it from a logical, not emotional state<br>  then you can solve your problem<br>  emotions only get in your way of clear rational thinking
RnQFwIuUaa	Chris,<br>  Why are you already thinking about rejection? Flirt with her, smile and give her compliments, then find out if she has a boyfriend. Don't tell her you like her, because she needs time to get used to the idea. Instead, show her by being a friendly guy, talking to her about stuff and look/smile at her. When you feel comfortable enough that she may like you too, then ask her out. Good luck|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I would tell her in a note if you are scared of rejection, but you won't know until you ask.
qxiq81Wnaa	well do u both want to work it out or forget it and move on<br>  good luck try music
a272fed9deea600a145347d74ee28ae3aa	If you haven't already, you should chat with her about what she is interested in and what makes her happy. If there is something that you both enjoy, try that. You will feel a connection with her and hopefully make you two closer.<br>  You could convince her to try something new, something that you enjoy doing; she may be a little shy at first so dont push her into it.<br>  It may be that you have only been together for a month and she isnt as open as your last girlfriend. You never know, she may become more confident and open with time.|`|NzxmVSLmaa	Race has nothing to do with it. If you're not feeling that "click" just be honest... tell her you're not feeling her in that way but you enjoy her company and hope you can be friends. <br>  If you and your girlfriend just recently broke up prior to dating the new girl then maybe you're just not ready to feel that special connection with anyone else.|`|GAbG2IBMaa	Well it has nothing to do with being white or mexican, but i mean if you dont have that same feelings for her u should give her more time.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	oh heah.|`|HflkFlkpaa	Try to spend more time together and get to know her a little more. The reason why it doesn't feel the same is because your last serious girlfriend you knew for quite some time I am guessing, so you have to start over with a new girl, so it won't be as serious at first. Just give it time, and I am sure you'll be fine.|`|XdhbT1y3aa	I doubt it's that. My girlfriend is white and she's a damn good kisser. Maybe you just didn't get that spark? If you aren't feeling it then don't lead her on.|`|HAHA2u13aa	End it with the white girl(your words) and find a nice Latino(your words) girl.Peace|`|HcWJwx0Baa	Why don't you try to make it exciting<br>  <br>  Yes|`|ICTr6kHhaa	superman that hoe
KeRbiNKeaa	Well, if possible can you change the date of the party? If not then just go with her knowing, I am sure she will still love it and have a great time.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	just go and have a good time.<br>  don't worry about the surprise part.

0zgolkhOaa	eye contact baby  :) Just be yourself thats the most important thing.  The minute you try to change yourself only to appease others you ruin yourself.|`|FEOmvvSiaa	When your with your guy friends notice the kind of girls they are into. Try dressing extra pretty and wear nice perfum but be yourself because most guy can spot a girl who's being fake. Make sure that you can be the kind of girl that a guy can be himself around and try telling some jokes because guys like humour. If there is a guy that you like try flirting a little but don't make it to obvious that you are.
1LmhxjoOaa	same situation,.....find another friend, im in the process of doing that right now!!! it is working though. but, if u dont want 2 do that, talk to them.  i was a little wimpy to do that, but everybody told me to do it. i know that my friend would torture me if i did that. i got pretty crazy 2day also. i found another friend, but the one that is anoying is being really nice right now. just trust me, this will work!|`|OGbMQuBnaa	Ah, dude.<br>  I think he likes you.
CCAw6XLtaa	look theres two reasons he wouldnt care.<br>       1.)he isnt that serious about the relationship<br>       2.)or hes just realy understanding nice guy<br>  now im not in the position to tell you wich one of these two he because i dont know what hes like in other aspects of your relationship. well i hope hes the secoud one and ood luck i hope for you the best.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	can you translate to english please.|`|1378862e7f14f3d6b3ca9f2e14f3ba94aa	well, <br>  i dont think he likes the situation that happened, but if he doesnt care then he really isnt a very good guy to date.<br>  <br>  i think that mcenzie guy must b a good guy cuz u did get sum action from him, is he HOTTTTT!!!!!<br>  <br>  jk,<br>  GOD BLESS|`|X3YazRSoaa	I understand that you are in a big situation but all that I could say is that he maybe does care, but you left him in shock! So try to talk to him and ask him if he will be ok with it; as forgiving you at all.|`|GvdH9UrNaa	It doesn't appear to me that he really cares about you, sorry hon but that's just what I think. What guy, who cares about the girl he is with and or has true feelings for, would EVER be okay with his girl kissing on some other guy, or even giving friendly kisses, think about it? And, honestly I do believe that you felt bad for what you did but I'm not so sure on whether your heart is really with this Logan guy. I think maybe you long to see other guys and experience other people, deep down, maybe your not ready for a relationship with commitment, especially one with a guy who could care less if your with some other guy?! Now that is someone who you do not want to be with! You deserve better and need find out what your truly looking for in a guy. If Logan doesn't show true concern and emotions that he really wants you and cares about you, then you don't need him, simple as that.
FVWvN07xaa	Mark osbourne i know you.<br>  <br>  lollll|`|4KlaogrNaa	Hey, I like how you are willing to except who you are and not be something your not. You don't have any ego and girls like that. I am going to be honest, and you dont seem to have any pimples so your definitely not bad looking, but average.. no offense. But, try and be yourself, maybe change yiour hairstyle, you know get a makeover.. But, to tell you the truth if a girl really does like you she wont care about your looks but whats on he inside.. IKNOW ITS REALLY CHEESY! But its true. Dont worry the right girl will come along.. besides your only 18.|`|289DtjKVaa	listen mate you look fine!! i have a mate who was 23 before he got his first girlfriend he is 6ft 2 with huge musles and blue eyes, it was all in his mind.. he put to much pressure on himself, just don't stress about it, let it happen don't rush into things, like thinking, does she like me, what should i do, just take it easy and go with the flow... ps my mate is now 24 has had four girlfriends and is constantly having problems with his girlfriend! ha|`|MSb9LqTtaa	i donno why your not ugly,your cute.
N7gOE1btaa	I think you need to start talking to him more.  It sounds as though he might like you, but pointing out a few examples doesn't mean anything.  If you condense examples like that, you can make it seem like anyone likes you.  So the best thing to do is flirt with him a bit and see how it goes.  The next dance at your school--ask him to dance.  Guys are SUPER shy about that stuff, and their buddies don't make it any easier.  But really if a girl approaches a guy to dance, that girl is cool.  So go for it, good luck!|`|4rLdaCNHaa	I think he likes you.<br>    But it looks as if your gonna have to give him a nudge and let him know, after all sneaking peaks, walking close and being concerned your named not being called, seems his way of telling you, do you'll have to reciprocate.
d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	It will only be awkward if you choose to make it so. If you act weird and awkward around your friend then, yes of course it's going to be strange but if you act like nothing is different then it won't be.|`|qW7aSBI2aa	Just eat some Gushers and listen to some Beatles.<br>  <br>  <br>  Grow up.|`|DsIbGLYUaa	NO MEANS NO if he actually liked you then he would have no reason for rejecting you, think of it logically, he wanted you, you would already know
LTN8cLSCaa	the kids a pothead. better check it out|`|Xlzk4tO5aa	a pipe most likely for smoking weed. that the only thing drug he would be smoking out of a pipe. the other drugs smoked from a pipe i doubt he is doing because they are not social drugs.
2nc9k9BSaa	That is COMPLETELY normal. It's okay to dream about the person you like. ^^<br>  <br>  Why don't you just suggest to him that you two kiss? Say it a little playfully. If he agrees and starts leaning in, then there's your cue.|`|W8QFjB6eaa	well, that topic is a good conversation starter, specially if you wanna go over to him, you could just start with a Hey, l dreamt about you last night and go deeper and deeper<br>  <br>  or just give him hints|`|uP9M7Kzuaa	ask him out. then u can kiss him. lol. im 11. lol!|`|jB6xN1Kiaa	i always dream about marring the guys i like lol, it normal, but remeber it just a dream. it doesnt mean they accualy like u|`|wqcfH5qPaa	NO iTSZ NOT WEiRD..YUR JUSZ FANTiSZiN..BUT YU SHA ASK HiM OUT && DEN YU KA KiSZ JUSZ LiKE YU WANT 2...GiRL OPPERTUNiTi iS KNOCKiN....NOW ANSAH iT.!!
mL07N3IAaa	hmm..well he is 25 and you are 18. i just think that's quite the age difference. but that's just me. i think it'll be okay if you've seen him on webcam or something and that you know it's him. but meet at a public place where everyone can see you.|`|Ddfff5psaa	eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! The daughter part is BAD.|`|pGKBoZbIaa	Its a scary situtation....and the kid kinda is a downer cause your still reeal young and have alot to experience....but If you feel it then go for it....if theres doubt...then i would slow down or stop righrt now before it gets anymore serious
vkPgHVLdaa	I would talk to your best friend first. It will probably hurt her feelings to hear that he likes someone else, especially her best friend, but it will hurt less if she hears it from you. If she is your best friend then she deserves to know and hear exactly what is going on from you instead of a rumor (true or false) that will undoubtedly start up. I know its said a lot but its true, boys come and go but best friends are there forever. Don't ruin a friendship over a guy. <br>   I hope this helps you out a little:)|`|a2wZg7DQaa	no no no  dont do it!!<br>  <br>  seriously i done that and me and my bestfriend are only just building back our relationship as friends and this happened like 4 months ago!<br>  wait until shes over him then go for it.<br>  or atleast ask her first if its ok.<br>  <br>  hope i helped.|`|ojAo1U1caa	If it's worth losing your friend, yeah.<br>  <br>  If you really value your friend, don't hurt her like that.|`|2SKy9UxFaa	I think you should definately talk to your friend first, friends are always more important that boyfriends so you have to show her you really care about how she feels and ask her about it at the same time you should explain how you feel about him to her and try to make her understand and come to terms with it.  If she agrees; go for it! if not; explain this to the boy and see if he could explain that he doesn't like your friend in that way.|`|trxEyVRLaa	if you say yes you can say goodbye to your best friend|`|MPimGv1Raa	lol awhh datzz can b hard im 13 as well loll ...XD<br>  anyhoo umm it can b hard i went through da same thing...<br>  if u think itz worth loosin a frend mayb he will not b forever like u reaallii think u guys will get married at dis age da chaces i guess are 1% <br>  so umm ur frend supports u and u guys r close shez dere for u and datz all da matters i think u shuldnt<br>  <br>  on da other hand i think u shuld cuz umm he likes u and think of it if u like sumeone u want em to like u...u fuly die for em to like u n yeaa<br>  soo datz how he mayb feelz talk to em bothh ur frend has no chance since she got rejected so i guess u cann <br>  <br>  uu doo wat u think is da bestt <br>  Bestt off luckk <3 :P

2zd5sLVSaa	Not sure. I do however think you better understand yourself and the strength you may have never knew you had. I was betrayed after 10 years of marriage yet i wouldn't trade that painful experience for anything! I enjoy life more now than i ever did then! You will be fine. I hope this helps.
gCPu04gTaa	I take it this is form men only?|`|jkXDhtsQaa	I don't think it's much to whether she's pretty or not...It's how the relationship was and how they ended it.|`|QYahxUEWaa	Are you a girl or a boy?|`|KV5ebqxWaa	I think it depends on more what the lad is like, if he is a jealous person then it could be really hard to get over an ex. If she is pretty has a bit to do with it but i think it is more how the ex acts after the relationship. If she moves on quickly and he sees her with other lads, jealously will take over, whereas if she still pesters the lad and makes it known she loves him still, he will find it annoying (more than likely) and probably try to move on more himself.|`|xtd2h5JTaa	It deffo makes its harder to get over a woman if she is gorgeous ;0)<br>  <br>  This new bird might just be a rebound.... Sounds like he still likes u from wot u have written..... Ask him?!?!?!   ;0)
Uxzy2Z0Faa	actually she probably likes you. although you may be confused, she might be just shy.... or to embarrassed to tell u.so flirting is her way to tell u but if u confront her or try to push it she "retreats". it really depends on whether or not u like her and whether or not u want to know if she likes you. for example<br>  <br>  a)  usually if she wants to know if u like her (and why u like her) she may ask ur friends just to be sure so she can get a feel for how to proceed<br>  <br>  b) these mixed signals may just mean she is flirty, in which case u got the wrong impression and she doesnt like u dat way<br>  <br>  c) if u like her and u think she likes u i encourage u to just go for it! ask her and if she says yes tell her u like her back, ask her out , etc.   u get the idea<br>  <br>  that is what my current gf did. at first i didnt understand it but after a while it made sense so i asked her if she liked me she said yea...  u get the rest<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  u said her friends used to annoy u to get ur attention... but they stopped. well dont be 100% positive im right bc i am only goin by wat u told me but i really think they stopped bc they know that somethin is goin between her and u. if they stopped they may be trying to not interfere wit u and her and u should take the hint. but dont take my word for it.... im just going by experience and by wat u told me.|`|kp5dyDz2aa	Thanks for the answer.. i think she likes you but she is showing it in another way because maybe she is to shy to tell..and she is looking at you to get your attention and the rumor just saying it cause she know that you like her something like that.. Girls have another way of showing of what they feel. some they show it rudely and some just say it or by the way they look at you all the time just because we are shy to say it and we usually wait for the guy to make the move..|`|2Sft7Nnoaa	well to be honest she may be a complete flirt and people have got the wrong end of the stick she may have been a little mad at first about thinking you started the rumor because you know how rumors can spread really quickly so she wants to kill it before it goes any further . to me it doesnt sound like she likes you in that way but hey we can only give advice on what we hear remember we havent seen the situation ourselves so dont take our word as law . we are only going by what you have told us
YAeHKy7Naa	its not weird...ive gone out with guys that were 3 years older than me and it wasn't weird at all....i would let her know how you feel because i guarantee you that she likes you :)|`|mehbohrMaa	that's sort of awkward. I'd wait...... For a long time........

QilfSBfsaa	There must be a reason that your parents don't give money to your brother, so you don't give him a buck too.|`|6BPmn4SCaa	tell him to get a job :)<br>  <br>  he needs to learn responsibility and how to afford things himself. if hes old enough to drive... he should be old enough to pay for things himself.|`|58H53s8maa	dont give it to him...your parents probably want him to get a job. if he can drive hes old enough now not to depend on family all the time for money|`|7w9AM9Tnaa	well if he's already he's spoiled by your parents then don't give him money cause there's probably a reason for why they don't want to give him money this time.|`|AA12398373	It might put you in a bad standing with your parents. But more importantly if you don't really want to give him money, then don't.

xbISxnmfaa	Hello? He goes out with the hostess and she bakes him desserts. WTF. You have EVERY right to be jealous. Why are you letting your man go out with other women??? You need to talk to him to DEFINE your relationship. Is it an open one or an exclusive one? Sounds like you two are not on the same page.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	you definately have a right to be jealous and if he doesnt respect that and stop hanging out with these girls then you maybe you should leave him bc sometimes you have to forget what you want and remember what you deserve|`|ki8P8bYfaa	No offence, but you sound jealous.  If you catch him flirting or something with another girl, than, yes, you have the right to be jealous.  But right now, I'd say no, and that you are over reacting.  Well, you have a right to be a little jealous, it's natural.  But co-workers go out all the time.  If he loves you he won't cheat.  But tell him how you feel, study his reaction to it carefully (you can usually tell when someones lying) and take it from there.
ONInHm7Oaa	when you see him, just smile.and if he smiles or waves back at you. walk up to him and see what he has to say. be patient. lol... dont seem to desperate. play it cool. it should work out. and if he is a really cool understanding guy. he'll understand.|`|rwffuibLaa	Yeah you still have a chance.

1oTDy9sTaa	Uhm drop him!! He's not worth your time!<br>  <br>  1. He has a girlfriend.<br>  2. He doesn't respect you, nor do you respect him.<br>  3. You two are only using each other for one thing, which is not okay.<br>  4. You will be caught up in drama if you keep this up, because his girlfriend will most likely find out at some point.<br>  5. Why don't you find someone that you can actually see yourself with and actually cares about you?<br>  <br>  You will understand later on that this whole experience really is not worth your time after you have found someone who is actually special to you.
wovoZ5Z0aa	You might consider bringing up the subject in a round-about way.  Talk about guys you've liked in the past.  Ask him about girls he likes.  Ask him if he thinks friends should date.  Then honestly listen to what he has to say.  <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, this will NOT be obvious to a guy.
5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	only when he is completely done with his girlfriend should you only then consider giving it a try with a very open mind, regardless of his aunt or anyone else for that matter.i do not think at such a young age you know what real love is yet.
bjt4M3Icaa	Stop doing the calculations and consult an attorney.|`|N7gOE1btaa	These situations are different for each state and also for each individual case.  The terms agreed upon will clearly state how much he should hand you each month.  It will be a set figure with no exceptions.  If it says 2250, then he should give you 2250.  If you are still confused, you need to contact your attorney regarding the matter.
4ESlizXraa	There are several ways to go about this.  First, you could find out something about her like what type of music she likes and get tickets to a concert and ask her to go with you.  You could ask her to dinner.<br>  <br>  If you want to get creative... that can be good or bad.  I had someone come up to me once and tell me I had won a free dinner for Friday night but the catch was I had to go with him to claim it.  Kinda cute, but gimmicks are just that, gimmicky.  They can backfire quickly.<br>  <br>  Also had a guy come up to me and say "all I know about you is we work in the same building, you don't wear a wedding ring and you have a beautiful smile, but I'd really like to find out more.  Could I take you to dinner?"  That worked.<br>  <br>  Mostly, though, it depends on the person you're asking out.  You don't want to do something to get her attention if that's not the kind of personality you usually display.  Don't sacrifice who you are for the sake of being "cute" because that won't work.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|DsIbGLYUaa	how bout this: will you go out with me?|`|3ch6ADzxaa	Don't ask her out the way some one else tells you. Be original. There's no need to think too much about it. When you're ready, and the moment comes... do whatever your heart feels is right. Its kinda cute when you boys don't know what to do.|`|vFldqvN4aa	well when my bf asked me out he gave me his necklace i told him i liked it was so sweet!! so give the girl something like a stuffed animal or well a necklace and that way it easies the mood and you can ask her out then|`|I4sNxuYqaa	I know its hard but if you want to be extravagant I cant help you really.

Vv7a31pmaa	go up to him and kiss him.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	Take a step back and think, are you particularly quiet or shy around this boy that you like? Whereas some guys do like shyness, a lot also find it a turn off, as they can't be bothered with a chase. Or are you quite a loud and boisterous person who is confident and quite egotistic? <br>  <br>  Look at your current attitude around the guy you like. Then perhaps try something different, act a little different, if you're loud, be a bit quieter, it can attract the shyer, less confident guy. If you're more reserved, maybe be a little more outgoing, laugh more, make jokes, be confident. However, do not change fundamentally, as you would not be being yourself, and that is the biggest downfall.<br>  <br>  I hope I've helped.<br>  Good luck.|`|2Ck8EApFaa	Start talking to him more. <br>  & if he flirts with you, flirt back :)<br>  <br>  Drop your books right in fron of him during school :)<br>  Ask him for help on the homework :)<br>  <br>  Lol..idk|`|gmefdkZsaa	well if you really like him<br>  <br>  say casually " hey, wanna hang out sometime?"<br>  <br>  "there is this movie that I have been really wanting to see and maybe you want to come with?"<br>  <br>  and if he says no I'm busy or something say, well maybe you can give me your # so I can txt me if your not busy sometime<br>  <br>  <br>  then he will probally give you his #<br>  <br>  and he will kno that your intrested in him<br>  <br>  and its not to open or too easy<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!<br>  -?|`|cggkcAC5aa	Flirt flirt flirt<br>  =]<br>  It would be nice if you could help me with mine too<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309144913AAzhNXV">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|uP9M7Kzuaa	flirt with him! talk to him!|`|iqShn0UIaa	Try asking him out to coffee, if he declines, you know hes not into you, if he accepts, well then you two will grow emotionally, which is a strong foundation for a relationship.

I didn't say it would be easy.  I didn't say it would happen instantaneously but "he that can have patience, can have what he will."  If you set your mind to building a life for you and your three children without your abusive husband, YOU CAN DO IT!  But you won't do it until you know and believe that you can.<br>  <br>  Now, to the husband, I was raised in a divorced household where my father wasn't there and I grew up swearing to myself that I would never get a divorce.  I married young, had kids young, and 10 years into the marriage, after I couldn't take it anymore, I filed for divorce.  What's the point of me telling you all this?  "That which we fear comes upon us."  Every person's story is different.  Divorce, in and of itself, is not a bad thing.  But what is a bad thing is staying in a marriage because you want to avoid getting a divorce.  Children look at their parents as role models.  What kind of role model will you be if your children grow up and see that their mother is being the way your husband is treating you?  <br>  <br>  You have an opportunity here.  You can stand up for yourself and your children and decide what kind of life you choose to have, you can forgive your parents (mom and dad) for being human and doing the best they can with what they knew how and go beyond that, and you can say to your children, "No more of this.  This cycle stops with me."<br>  <br>  Either way, the choice is yours.

6a397149e84e6d2e731eb79dbc0a7cbfaa	The girl that posted IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT was right on. <br>  I am a guy, I am older. I am a Dad. We hurt the ones we love sometimes the most. And your parents have broken hearts and are looking for reasons why things turned out the way they did. Your dad put you in a bad position. He needed to be a man and do the right thing and take this off your shoulders. He was wrong in several ways. He handled it all wrong.<br>  Your Mom, looking at the way she handled it is possibly displaying to you why your Dad was looking for love somewhere else. There is never a simple answer. <br>  You have a girlfriend and because you are trying to get your mind around all that has been happening you may think you are distracted from her...and you are. You love your girlfriend...If you really do - you need to get on the phone and tell her. If you need a break, then that is also something you need to tell her. Because how do you know that your Dad wasn't feeling bad about not getting enough sex from your mom for whatever reason? And lady that he was friends with maybe kissed him. Maybe it made him feel better. He didn't necessarilly want to cheat on your mom, but she made him feel good and one thing lead to another and they started having sex. He probebly still loved your Mom but it felt too good when the other lady and him kissed. <br>   Day by day life goes by and before you know it you are out of school. You are the same person, but today is yesterdays tomorrow. Meaning we get older and just from our perspective we are the same. But we also involve ourselves with others and we become family. Our actions, our happiness or sorrow afect those around us.<br>  Consider your blessings. All the good that has come upon you. The good times the wonderful people. forgive your parents for their mistakes. let it go. They do love you. It is the evil of dishonesty that has wrecked their view of what is important. They could even get over it and get back together. but forgiveness is not for the wrong doer it is for you so you can have peace. That is so hard to learn. Maybe don't have sex for a while with anyone until you feel like you can handle it otherwise you will hurt your girl friends and they don't deserve that do they? What if you get one pregnent? Be a bigger man than your dad, and a better person than your mom. Learn from this and treat your children with love and admit your mistakes.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	If you were my son and I was being this blind, I would hope my child would show me this question, at least.

They just want to shoot the messenger, rather than admit they are the ones to blame, not you. To put the pain on you rather than deal with their personal responsibilities for this mess. That is totally unfair. You did the right thing, and now they are both acting as tantrum throwing toddlers who's toy has been taken away. <br>  But now you need to look after yourself, and that does mean getting a support network going, and includes professional help. Its not healthy that you lost so much weight. Its not healthy that you can't communicate your love for your friend. Its not healthy that you want to cheat. Its not healthy to have nightmares so often. <br>  You need to get help to deal with all this. Your parents are going through their own hell, and just aren't there for you at this time. So you need to reach out beyond them to find the help you need. And you do deserve that help. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG!
hTCIDXTUaa	lol...here's a little "excerpt" from my journal about my first kiss after it happened. I'm glad I wrote about it so I can always remember it. As for the scene, it was perfect as well. Just me and him late one night...<br>  <br>  "By the time he finished that sentence our lips finally met. We kissed for a couple seconds and it was so nice. I couldn’t believe what was actually happening. We stopped for a second and then he put his hand up to caress my face and brought me in to kiss him again. Just before our lips touched I saw the look on his face. His eyes were closed yet I still could see the seriousness and intensity in his face. But yea.. We kissed some more and then he stopped for a second, I opened my eyes and with his hand still cupping my face, We both leaned in so that our foreheads and noses were resting on each other. We were like that for a couple seconds just smiling and staring at each other. The feeling was so overwhelming. At that moment I was in a daze, I was so happy just sitting there next to him as if we were the only two people left on this earth. Next he started tilting his head to kiss me again..."<br>  <br>  **Yes, It's a big deal, to me at least<br>  **If he truly cares 4 u, he won't judge u|`|uWJJyNR3aa	wait. it is honestly worth it. If he's a nice guy, he won't judge. but honestly, it comes very naturally so I think it's impossible to suck too bad at it.
qeUoAW6naa	Omg I really feel for you, girl! Fortunately I think you are on the right track. You must get yourself out of this situation FAST. You have dealt with enough already. How crappy it must be to live with morons! And it sucks when the person whom you've looked upto as a role model (your own mother) is totally messed up. I think you are mature enough to know what is good and healthy for you. Living in the current environment would be a very unhealthy thing for you (just as it was for your brothers). I think you should become independent and just move out, maybe to that school that's closer to your dad's. At least I'm assuming that your dad would truly care about you. Good luck, and be strong. And fill your life with decent people and good influences :)|`|6C3i2fyxaa	call a social worker or tell a teracher or prinipial .. call da cops ur om and dad are abusive parents ..

iTUugOTLaa	Probably you are being insecure, clingy (both or one of them) or too jealous. If it's your cooking, cleaning and taking care of me, I'd LOVE that! Seriously, I would really like that. But realize that men want to have their own time, things that no one has to know about, and space.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you've had some bad luck apparently, as these dudes don't seem to have discussed it correctly with you... The basic point here is that for a guy, it's important that the relationship is nice, but he doesn't have to "live" the relationship all the time. Space is of the essence I'm afraid.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents, I've actually broken off a relationship with someone like you, and really, it was the clingyness. I really enjoyed the time with her, but when I was not with her.. she would constantly call me and send me txt messages. I liked the messages, nice ego boosters 24/7.. that's nice, but she can't expect me to "have" to do that as well. I just don't do that, it's not my thing. So, anyways, I followed suit and did send her txts a lot back.. one day, I was busy and studying, so I didn't send her anything, she sent me like four. I just didn't feel like txting her that day.. at night she called me at ten (she would call me at ten every single night, which is nice too) and she started crying on the phone, telling me she feels neglected and stuff because I didn't send her one txt that day...<br>  <br>  I didn't know what to think anymore, I couldn't talk to her much anymore at one point because she was like that... She would constantly ask me if I love her all the time, she was basically insecure and I would constantly have to reassure her of these things... Now I don't mind a lot of things, but crying to me like that.. I felt like I'm just gonna hurt her more than anything else, so I broke it off. I'm sorry if you think this is an ugly way for me to answer your question (with the example and all) but this is discrete, no one knows me here, and no one needs to know who I am talking about, but this is the only way I think I can make my point right now. She was too clingy and I started taking her for granted somehow, and overall she was just hurting herself.<br>  <br>  I prefer a girl who has more self confidence, who doesn't NEED me, who only WANTS me to be there for her. A girl who isn't suffocating me, because even if it sounds like a dream, it's not. And I don't feel bad because of what I'm "missing out on". I perfectly understand the thought though, but I seriously think it's healthier to be less attached in a relationship. Don't BE the relationship, just be IN it.<br>  <br>  cheers|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Long Hair<br>  <br>  Slim figure<br>  <br>  Know when to keep quiet.<br>  <br>  Sex anytime.|`|MMelZoTFaa	That is the same thing i did with my girlfriend.

N7gOE1btaa	This is really tough.  I think you need to realize the possibility that she likes you, because it seems that way, but also avoid her touching you in ways you don't like, such as your butt.  Now that she is a lesbian and you are not, you need to shy away from her touching you inappropriately.  Once she realizes you don't like it, any feelings she may have will go away quickly.

AU4LAtqMaa	write him a note (careful, this one is a little dangerous)<br>  tell him at lunch<br>  tell him before or after school|`|gTJMhjKnaa	Yeah you should flirt with him and he should flirt back and make the move once you get to know him better...|`|c6fe96c3b22a98d7adeb2daac44e9f65aa	well i think you should flirt with him mabye he is trying to flirt with u but dont want u to think of him weird show that u really like him and want to go to the next level

b00rcO8Laa	I have given second chances and i have been given second chances, I would give him another chance but if it happens again leave, because cheating is cheating b/c he may not be "psychically" cheating he's doing it emotionally and mentally and isn't that what cheating involves. And i had that happen to me your same situation.|`|VwG2lhcNaa	You need to find out why he is doing this. Maybe he is just getting tired of you. Discuss it with him.|`|WHV2VDbIaa	Honey, i know exactly how you feel!! i found one of my past ex's doing the same thing. we were together for about 6 months before this happened (3 years total). i believe that once someone cheats like that, they are most likely to do it again. i never trusted him the same way again. we never broke up because of this but he cheated on me for real after. and i took him back. <br>  <br>  it will sting for a long time. its going to hurt. when you love someone you do things that you never thought you would do. love is funny like that. its hard. i can't tell you to leave him and never look back... i would then be a hypocrite. i can tell you that it never truely stops hurting. but true love over powers all things.

rIzx4OEWaa	Hello Olivia,  What a fool this guy must be here he has you now wanting to be only with him and he is now trying to change the person you were when you both first met up? His an idiot.<br>  Listen Olivia most women try doing this to the fellow they marry an now his trying it on you ask him why an ask what more does he expect from you? you may as well find out now it would be to late if you got married an had children.<br>  You are who you are This week my wife an I will celebrate 33 years together an I would never change her in a million years for anyone else.<br>  She is the person whom I fell in love with an anything else I may not like but I accept as it is part of who she is. She is head strong at times an other times a little soft when she should be strong. I don't care I love her because she like me is not perfect an nobody ever is. If he wants perfect give him a picture of himself an tell him to go out with that then.  Have you asked him to right down what he wants from the women he hopes to marry an while your at it you do the same, then compare notes an see if there is any conflicting issues that show up then work through them if you must. I for one would stand my ground an make him accept you for who you are or find someone to love you for who you want to be. I wish you luck in what ever you choose to do .|`|02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	19 months...hmm. You need to be yourself, not the woman that "he wants you to be".<br>  <br>  There is no point in embarking upon a relationship in which the partner seeks to impose his own views of what you should be upon you. Compromise can work (I met my partner when I was 40 - I'm now 52, and I like to drink beer, so we agreed I could drink beer provided I did not get drunk - this has worked).<br>  <br>  Be the woman that you are, rather than a clone of some chap's fantasy. Otherwise, I predict the future road could be rocky.|`|5VdB8njTaa	He's trying to get the best out of an already good deal.<br>  <br>  Don't be so predictable, do nice things unexpectedly, tell him you love him, but keep it on your terms. <br>  <br>  Ensure that you are as happy as he is, as that is what a relationship truly is. x|`|AA11966816	Dump him - he is not worth the "investment" you`ve put in|`|9886899d6f135552d9c3c4f7e401043daa	Quote:  just don't get what more I'm suppose to do to show him I am trying to be the woman he wants me to be.<br>  <br>  Why the hell should you change to be someone HE wants you to be?! Be yourself! If he doesn't like that then he isn't the man for you darling. No one should make you try to be something or someone you are not.<br>  <br>  May I just also add that your independence and all the other little things you've mentioned are wonderful qualities to have! You've been taken for granted and now he expects you to change. Ps: What makes you act like a man if you're a woman? I think he's talking out of his rear.|`|K039fytQaa	all he is looking for is for you to depend on him a lot more, come to him with all your problems etc, its really gud that your independant but just learn to let yourself go a bit more and rely on him, like you wud do if you were married to him, don't keep anything from him, even if you think its embarrisin or anything like that, after a year and 7 months there shud b a gud bit of trust which built up there, now start building the rest of your relationship on this trust.  let him know how you feel even if you think its embarrisin ;) believe me, share things with each other more that you couldn't tell anyone else! x
P9FgdTeHaa	Just know you are setting a precedent by doing this 2-month gift!  My advice:  keep up with "just because" little gifts rather than minor milestones.  It means more when it's "just because" and doesn't over set expectations.<br>  <br>  Anyway, good gift-giving revolves around knowing what she's into... is she a runner?  wine lover?  cook?  movie buff?  reader?   Think about what you see at her house/apartment, what she talks about the most, what she likes to do, then supplement it.  Tells her you are paying attention.|`|yyVxhB6Iaa	a diamond princess crown and a sexy photo of neville longbottom from harry potter. role play...|`|hGWhzfFqaa	LOL.

HKkbqlIuaa	Well, I can understand why you would feel a little out of place, but it is a little unfair to your boyfriend. He is obviously willing to look past your financial circumstance, so you should do the same. Although it may seem like it's different, it's really not. I am sure he wants to show you more of his life now that you have shown him yours. Maybe he wants to show you his rooms and some of his hobbies. I am sure he wants to introduce you to his family. I would say just give it a shot. You shouldn't feel awkward because he obviously is more than willing to welcome you into his home and his life.|`|TGfRrITKaa	it dose not seem fair to me i mean what if he didn't want you to go to his place? you would most likely be mad.. and i know were your coming from i kinda felt that way when i first started dating an ex but the only way to get comfortable at his place is to go over there|`|1vcmglYGaa	yer def. not being unfair. its okay if you dont feel comfortable. he probably is just trying to make you comfortable and to say that its okay that yer not as wealthy as him. he doesnt mind and its okay if you dont wanna go over. take things slow if you want
H8zFla1maa	ok so now?<br>  <br>  there is nothing wrong with being alone and finding out who you are for now. You are very young and this is about the time of someone's life where alot of repressed childhood feelings come up and make a person feel depressed. Take advantage of this time and learn to take care of your own need, find out who you are and what matters to you. Find out how your parents and others might hurt you and disappointed you, why you feel so incapable within yourself....work on your self esteem...as far as your gf goes. <br>  she probably wouldn't understand but what type of connection can a depressed and hurt person have with another?<br>  not much you want a valid relationship in your life and you want to be able to give to someone...then you have to learn to do that to yourself too..if she doesn't understand that then she needs time on her own as well...if you guys where together for 4 years and you never worked with her on you and she didn't even notice and instead put more pressure on you then I feel as if you never really op end up to her and only you know why...son't know you past but there are a few things that are stopping you from a real connection..maybe your father wasn't there? someone treated you like a loser? well you know better then me..|`|KasFZL7laa	you need to e-mail me because my ex boyfriend dumped me for this same exact reason.  waterloggedtortoiseskins@yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  i think we could both help each other.|`|sW81TCFCaa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!
es3feuhxaa	are you here to stay
JfeLb2Ptaa	wow... you have some negative answers here. <br>  Well, I just got married in July of 08. My husband and I have been together for about 3 years and 8 months. <br>  I know what you are going through, believe me. Right before my husband and I were about to get married, I started seeing all these couples cheating on each other and getting divorced. And then you see the statistics that only 50% of marriages make it. You feel like you are already set up to fail. <br>  I am really enjoying marriage so far though. I didn't think it would feel much different than before we got married, because the only thing that has changed is the rings on our fingers, but a lot has changed. We are even more committed than before. It's all about loving each other and being there for each other. It's about communication and honesty. It's about planning the rest of your life together. It's about having fun together, with your best friend (that's my husband) and experiencing new things in life together, new adventures. I know this all sounds so corny. I guess I'm still classified as a newly wed, but my husband and I talk about this stuff all the time. About what it is we're doing and where we are going. It's all very important. <br>  It's not only about living together. It's also about forming your lives around each other. It takes a lot of work. It is definitely not easy. But it is so worth it. <br>  I hope this helped.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	One man, one woman, one flesh before one God.<br>  Nothing more, nothing less.|`|f46e31d4e09888d0eee755877512c6efaa	My answer went poof!<br>  <br>  My husband is fab!  We are each other's best friend,  We spend our time together when we are not at work... we love being together.  We can talk about anything and everything.  We have trust and honesty.  We kiss a lot, hold hands and say I love you all the time.<br>  <br>  Marriages fail especially after living with someone because you have that legal piece of paper.  That legal piece of paper says to a lot of people, I don't have to try anymore, I can let myself go, I can be in control, I own this person.  <br>  <br>  Marriage is also about sharing... bad and good... participating in the household chores and with the kids.  Helping each other no matter what the job is... cleaning up together, grocery shopping together, etc.  It's not women's work and men's work... it's togetherness.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	Having failed with marriage once before (and I say this in spite of feeling free to blame him), I watch closely and have learned much to never fail at it ever again.<br>  <br>  The problem is not believing what love is. We think that love is just a chemical change in the body that one feels and when the feeling is gone, we have fallen out of love and should move on no matter what the vows that were said during the wedding ceremony.<br>  <br>  I find divorce is a meeting of one or both that has decided to concentrate on themselves rather than each other. <br>  <br>  What makes us be in love with the other person is the first impression when all that one and the other could think of is what he/she could do for the other person. If those ideals are kept throughout the life of the marriage, there would never be any failures (divorce).|`|koP1PaVjaa	At this point in my life, marriage means, "gee, I think I have too much self-esteem. I'd like to have someone tell me what a piece of crap I am all the time and treat me like a work in progress."|`|woOeYFrEaa	I guess I have a problem with your "hopefully permanent partnership".<br>  <br>  I'll disclose that I have a religious outlook on marriage, but to me it really is a co-mingling of souls.  I feel like my husband and I truly became one flesh when we got married.  We committed that divorce would not be an option for any reason whatsoever.  It'd be like cutting off my arm.  We're partners for life.  Unless you go in with the "we're in this forever" outlook I don't think a marriage can succeed.  When you hit bumps along the way (and everyone does), if leaving is an option then sooner or later you will.  If you both are committed to staying then you will work out your problems, who wants to be miserable for the rest of their life?<br>  <br>  So I guess commitment is what makes marriages work.  You need love, physical intimacy, communication and everything else to have a happy marriage, but its the very permanence that makes it meaningful and worthwhile.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	The things that make a marriage work are respect, honesty, trust and communication along with a healthy dose of good humour. If a coupke has enough respect for themselves and for each other to be honest and to talk about things as they arise, the trust will grow and grow and the love will bloom like a rose. The good humour helps to see the ridiculous aspects of life, so that you can laugh at them instead of getting irritated by them. Maintain a home of peacefulness where you can relax be calm and the rest will fall into place.
Vv7a31pmaa	he does not want his friends to know about you.|`|0zgolkhOaa	It usually means he is very shy about others finding that he is talking to you.  Also it could mean that he wants to keep this "talking" private and not let anyone else find out.  I used to have a friend that would get really how should i say "sexual" with me when we were alone but out in the public she often acts like we are the most distant friends ever :)|`|HdCo22Ggaa	very shy and wants to get to know you but is afraid of being laughed at or embarrassed in front of every one else  He could be interested in you dating wise as well or as i said wants to know you.

He's the typical cheating husband who<br>  claims to be "separated from his wife". Yet, "you have never been to<br>  his place". So, you are the mistress.

As long as you two get along well, its great. Also, Im sure her friends wont pressure her, she can choose whatever choice she wants. And if she says no, then dont make a big deal out of it. She's not meant for you then. Right now since she flirts and laughs, it seems like she likes you back. So go for it. Whats the worst that can happen?<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|HBPOvPKwaa	If she seems like she likes you go for it. tell her that if she doesnt like you like that than its ok and you dont want things to be akward. and if she is pressuredby the people shes hanging out with than she isnt worth it if she isnt willing to not care what others think.<br>  :) <br>  i hope things go well for you|`|6LHYY2Bkaa	just be your self
5fdgfNCRaa	I see where you're coming from. You are correct in saying that $98 is less than $150 or $300. Obviously, that's true. <br>  <br>  Your parents are looking at it from their point of view and I can totally understand them because I'm cheap too. They figure that when it comes to clothes, at least with your sister the money is "well spent." <br>  They're getting more for their money by buying more clothes for your sister. <br>  They also may not be able to rationalize spending $98 on a pair of jeans because you will likely need other new clothes sooner or later, so they'll be spending the money on you anyway.<br>  <br>  It isn't fair for your sister to get more money coming her way for clothes, but your parents probably just can't part with the money knowing it'll only be on one item.<br>  <br>  If you really insist on those jeans, see if you can find them on Ebay (there are lots of sellers that sell new items with tags still on them)<br>  Otherwise, you might need to lower your standards for clothing. A name-brand clothing habit is hard to break, and when you're on your own you'll realize that it's lacking in practicality. Your parents may want to teach you this and not buying the jeans is their way of doing so.|`|uoCq9B7yaa	Sorry, but the only one your hurting is yourself.  Not that it's bad to want the "best" of things.  Sometimes you gotta take what you get and make the best of it.  If you want the fancy stuff, earn your own money and get it yourself.|`|rP1WwvnVaa	to be fair, I think you should explain to your parents that you would like it if they gave you the same amount of money that they give your sister.  If you want to blow it all on a single pair of jeans, then so be it.  But listen to what your parents are saying, there may be a lesson to be learned|`|8cssUYFfaa	Omg i totally feel for you. Your parents make no correct point. Argue about your sister. A good way to get to them is to say something like "it seems like you love her more than me" all sad and everything.. and that would make them feel really bad|`|9p7KONTkaa	well your parents are right, because they can do whatever they want with their Money, as for your sister getting to spend 150... well they saw the investment of 4 outfits as worth it.<br>  <br>  I would try and take the middle path and ask for slightly less expensive jeans, so you can get what you want, designer jeans maybe 50 instead of 98, and so they can get you more than one outfit, which is what they want.<br>  <br>  Life isn't fair and siblings often are treated differently when it comes to things like this, it's just the way it is.<br>  <br>  <br>  could your parents be more likely to buy her clothes because she's older and you can grow into them, saving them money?|`|FWPSzFVhaa	The sad thing is that adults are not always fair.  Not with kids sometimes, and not with other adults sometimes.  Even in the adult world, the boss sometimes pays others better for less work.  It stinks.  But that can be human nature.  <br>  <br>  The thing to do is be honest about it.  After you said you peace once, then drop it.  If that is how it is, then you will just have to find a way to get money for your own self.  Be clever and creative.  Maybe you can write stories about kids who are not always treated fairly and they come up with solutions on their own :-)   Seriously, you can find things to do like writing or photography that will bring in some cash.<br>  <br>  The other option is to go to the second hand store and buy some scrubs!  If you starts dressing like a hobo- maybe the folks will get the point!  :-)|`|5hMxDDeUaa	I wouldn't say thats very fair.<br>  I don't have any brothers or sisters, so I wouldn't know what this feels like, but I don't think that you're in the wrong at all.|`|22cnjGH1aa	those are some expensive pants|`|dovtFcDOaa	i gess u shood be able to get wut u want this is a little whiny though|`|NqtXFNB7aa	I totally agree with you.<br>  You are a deprived child if your parents won't even buy you a pair of jeans. And with your sister going out a spending a fortune on clothes like every day,  that's just screwed up. I think you should threaten to report them for neglecting your needs. =]
fZ4CUiA4aa	youve gone from butt-ugly to pretty|`|d0wJRB2Saa	I thought the one on the right was your girlfriend|`|qHOlnmCeaa	Why does it matter what ppl think?? What are you expecting from this? Everyones opinion is different, all you are doing is setting yourself up for nasty people saying nasty things about you! All that matters is what YOU think! I dont want to upset you, but this seems a little self indulgent, but not in a positive way. Learn to love yourself, you dont need others approval.

ixgIgnILaa	I thought you already sorted this problem out?<br>  If you like this girl<br>  and your too shy<br>  Then maybe you could write her a note?<br>  Or even tell one of her friends and see what they say<br>  Theres loads of ways to get round this<br>  Or just pluck up the balls and ask her!<br>  You have nothing to loose<br>  If its yes then go you<br>  If its no then your still be friends<br>  so it works out both ways <br>  Your know if she likes you as well if she gives you eye contact and flirts with you <br>  Just go for it.|`|2mbifsxIaa	umm be nice and sweet.<br>  dont be shy.
DcrI9zmkaa	What you need to do is stop playing around so much or you're going to make your rep even worse.

Explain that you told him you liked him and he was with someone else so you moved on. There's nothing to be embarrassed about. <br>  You're stressing over nothing. Seriously, are you sl*t or a whore? no. You've kissed two guys for crying out loud, it's not that big of a deal. Ignore what those other idiots are saying and just live your life how you want.|`|F4jhxDWNaa	Just be honest with yourself and the guy. Just tell him straight.. that you GENUINLY liked him which led to the kiss. However you can now see you were clearly mistaken in the type of person that he really is. The other girl is welcome to him. Pick good friendships. good luck|`|XdhbT1y3aa	God is not going to answer you through Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, what you need to do is stop all feelings with other guys except the one you're with. and honestly if people are saying you've had sex at the age of like what? 12?

So i would say a hug. But that all depends on how you feel after the date too. But don't kiss on the first date.|`|hIrdaRdWaa	I think upon meeting a handshake it fine.  but upon departure that all depends on how the date went.  You have to feel it out and go with your gut ( not below the belt line)  If you think you guys hit it off and you both seem to have had fun then a hug or even a kiss on the cheek but nothing more.|`|1378862e7f14f3d6b3ca9f2e14f3ba94aa	WELL I WOULD PREFER A HUG OR EVEN A KISS ON THE CHEEK BUT IF ITS A GIRL THAT U THINK IS STARTING PRETTY SLOW START A WITH A HUG.

You could ask him if he watches a show. Or what movies he likes or wants to see. See if he wants to go on a group date to the movies with some of yours and his friends so it won't be so akward. Then in thetre you won't have to talk so much, but you can be together. Or lean over and ask how he likes the movie. Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yeah he prolley wants to seem "cool" around you. Just get around it.|`|9AqB6iPsaa	To start a conversation just say something that happened in school like, did you here what she did!?.<br>  I think at the times when you think he doesn't like u, he has other stuff on his mind like a big test or something.|`|h0Oyxk2paa	just ask him questions like when he was born. favorite music|`|AA11313824	Honestly, most teenage guys are clueless.

9hdckHK9aa	I would just try to go on as bevore I found out she loves me. You didn't make her promises. But I guess you should talk to her about it. I had a similar problem. Because I've been very lonely for a long time I finally got a girlfriend. I knew after two weeks, it wouldn't work but I couldn't stop our relationship for more than a year now, because I don't want to loose her as a friend.<br>  <br>  I am too a guy who feels being a woman. In fall I started wearing women's cloathes at home. I was having depressions but with that I am feeling much better.

One on the back of her neck and the other on the small of her back, or her side, or her thigh.

What turns her one is what I mean.<br>  <br>  One thing that a women love is the touch of the face. When you kiss her, take your hand and cup her face. It shows control and sensitivity. <br>  <br>  Also you can take your hand and place is on her hip, and doing so, squeeze a little and move towards her behind. <br>  <br>  Do this nice and slow, and repeat if you want.

4fCTqxkIaa	You have to stop thinking about him at all. Your going to need to do things that are fun to help you forget. You need to keep occupied like others said so you wont have the time to think about him. Hang out with friends alot and do a lot of fun entertaining things.. The reason you go back to thinking bout him is cuz of the way it felt talking to him.. Im sure you probly felt happy. You need to replace that happiness with something else, like hanging with your friends more. You could try meeting someone else but that usually backfires leaving you comparing the person your with with the guy your forgetting.. Your best bet is to have lots of fun with your friends.. I wish you the best ok? Good Luck! Be happy!|`|Qxir7i58aa	Just keep reminding yourself that he is still with his GF. He is there with her because that's where he wants to be. <br>  You don't have to hate the guy (even thought that's normal), just remember that he wasn't taking you serious at all. <br>  He wasn't ready for you. Not your fault that he was playing around. <br>  <br>  Fill up your schedule and hang out a lot with your single friends. Never sit alone, always keep you mind occupied on other things. Out of sight usually means out of mind. It takes a little more time.<br>  Good luck.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	Well - if he's calling you and texting you maybe he's through with the current gf and wants to get to know you better.|`|d35e33382064124c01a8080f7ea11b45aa	You're so confused now , and i think you need new boyfriend immediately !|`|UDpcEqTbaa	making urself forget about him will make u think about him more. keep ur mind occupied so u dont have time to think about him, and delete everything that makes u think of him. and listen to happy songs. ur gorgeous by the way =]|`|Wl4TRRS6aa	u wont get over him over night.. trust me i knw.. take it easy.. tell him 2 stop callin n stop messagin u.. realize dat if he has a girl n he b on ur a**..he wud do da same 2 u if u were goin out with him. guys lik dat arent worth shyt..  talk 2 other guys or just chill with ur besties<3<br>  <br>  N dont worry..

I know you're vulnerable right now gator... try to go hang out with some friends and meet some new people.

If you want to say all those things then tell them all of it. My great grandfather on my Dads side was German and the one on my mom's side was French or something like that. My parents are mostly black though so I just go w/ that. If they ask me about it then I tell them about the rest of the fam history. As long as you know what you are then it really shouldn't matter.
zCE0slQ5aa	did you ask him if he wants to be with you?<br>  does he know that you are in love with him?<br>  <br>  before you delete someone from your life you should make sure that they know exactly how you feel and you know exactly how they feel.<br>  <br>  make sure that you have closure and make every attempt to give the other person closure. this will decrease the odds of them popping back up in your life later down the road.<br>  <br>  remaining friends feels like an impossibility at this juncture. but many times friendship is possible and very productive later on and sometimes much sooner than you might have ever thought possible.<br>  <br>  for now, distance is a good idea. you will change and grow and hopefully he will too. it is not only possible for you to recover from this but it is inevitable.<br>  <br>  i have indeed been in this position. i was the dumpee. i am still dealing with it today but everyone deals differently with heartbreak. i know that when i get into another relationship, it will replace the one i am still playing out in my mind.<br>  <br>  i hope you recover quickly from this. it is one of the hardest things in life to do. :)

Mry1PfdGaa	1.) No not at all. Maybe she just had to go. Or maybe she wanted to just get alone with you. That's also just where girls gossip. At our school dance, it was like all boys on the dance floor because all of the girls were in the bathroom talking and gossiping!<br>  <br>  2.) I think it may symbolize that she is getting comfortable with you. I would think that she fee;s like you are there to protect her. And that's a really good sign.<br>  <br>  3.) I think she means that you are not like all the other guys... and no  offense to guys. But some can be very immature and like, try to make a move when she tells you not to. And if didn't like, push her around and friendly tease her, that's probably what she means.

Yes that does mean she is getting more comfortable around you, because girls dont lay their heads on any guys shoulder.<br>  <br>  3.

Is her going to the bathroom so many times a bad sign?<br>  <br>   No it probably has nothing to do with you. She is probably just checking here makeup, seeing if her friends are having fun, or she might have had a problem with her dress. <br>  2. Does her laying on my chest symbolize she is getting more comfortable with me, or is that just a normal thing all girls do??<br>  <br>  She is definitely into you. The hitting thing is also a way that girls flirt as well as the puppy dog face. I think she wanted you to kiss her.<br>  3. What do you think by her meaning I'm "respectful" meant?? Cuz it can mean many different things<br>  <br>  I just think it was a complement because you didn't book a hotel room & surprise her. ; ) Just kidding. Girls want to be respected! Good job. Somehow now you have to let her know she is the girl of your dreams, so she will stop playing games with you ("dating other people"). That's playing hard to get.|`|QwYfHol4aa	either she had a lot of drinks or her and her girlfriends are talking about you and other boys in the bathroom. It could be good or could be bad. To me it looks like it is good from what you said.<br>  <br>  I would think she is getting more comfortable with you if she is doing that and hold your had.<br>  <br>  Respectful - you are not grabbing her and stupid things like that. You appear to her as someone that cares about personality and you are nice.<br>  <br>  <br>  that's what I got out of it.|`|rRV4c7Blaa	it hasnt been that long since i was in high school.. only a year..but the bathroom thing when i was at my own prom, was to talk about our dates.<br>  we would list the good, bad and ugly in our five minutes.. so the bathroom thing could mean anything.Most likely they were good comments from the rest of your story though..<br>  a girl resting her head on your chest shows that she feels comfortable enough with you to be close to you, which is a very good thing....with me personally if i don't like a guy i will be polite but i wont lead him on with any sort of touching i stay away, so i'm sure most girls are the same way.<br>  And the respectful thing is straight brownie points for you. it means you have done a good job on the date overall not crossing her boundaries or pushing her into anything too quickly...understand?|`|zY7boFYNaa	That's so sweet, though!<br>  1-Well maybe, a bit, but it's a bit confusing there.<br>  2-I only do that, when I'm feeling very comfortable w/ the person, but some girls just do it, w/ their friends.<br>  3-She meant like you are sweet, understanding & you will not go over her own boundaries.<br>  <br>  Just do not get hurt, though be strong if things do not work well, okay!<br>  <br>  Wish you well
Jgy9bCTLaa	as you are heart broken, he is not feeling well during sex. or in other word, he is not comfortable during sex with you.|`|hnhb119Laa	There is no reason for you to get pregant - use brith control - so he is either gay, or is looking to get out of the relationship.  If he is religious,  I am guessing gay.  But deep down you already know the answer and don't want to admit it yet.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	5 times in 3 yrs! well there is the reason he is turning off you i guess.|`|uhZneNORaa	Maybe he's tired.. works late etc? why dont you ask him? Just tell him you feel he isnt atracted to you and if there is a reason.. He knows he can get you when he wants that why he isnt like other guys cos its not a challenge for him. He probably wants to sometimes but not at the same time you do so he doesnt make a move..Why dont you make a move to show you want to?|`|lP04jzv6aa	something is up...talk to him.|`|8QoNSvp6aa	i think he told you , it sounds stupid to some ppl but some men ive known have serious issues with children  in their mind getting a girl pregnant is like a nail in their coffin  trapped with no escape  now i know that makes no sense  but by nature men are  free roamers so even if they love you they dont want to be  "chained "to you  odd i know   if i had obligations that kept me rooted to one place 24/7  id tear out my own heart to end it  because in a mans mind once you have a kid your fun and freedom are over  the next 18 years are controlled and your options are much fewer . he does love you i think hes just horrified of  the  results that could happen <br>  what to do about that i really cant tell you  its an issue he has to alter or you can walk away but as for why  that ive told you  ,i wish you luck|`|JsIidFj6aa	maybe cause he loves you and dont want to take a chance of you getting prego and haven no marriage time with you before you ahve to tend to a kid, <br>  sex is not everything ya know just wait till your married and he feels like its the right thing and he iwll be compfortable with it. then you will be gettn it all the time cause he knows for sure your all his<br>  good luck girl|`|aLLWID9xaa	Excuse me? 3 years and 5 times sex?

You're probably just in a rut.  It happens.  My husband and I hit a rut right after we got married.  We were together for 5 years before we got married and then we sort of had a domino effect that contributed.  I got laid off, and we were both so stressed out over what we were going to do about money that it just killed our sex drive.  Surprise him.  When he gets home from work or out of the shower or when hes sitting on the couch watching TV, go over to him, unzip his pants and start giving him a BJ.  No man in their right mind will turn down a BJ he hasnt asked for!  Try doing it in a place other than your home.  Familiarity breeds contempt.  Try the car, go to a park at night and get frisky.  A rut is easy to fall into no matter what the situation.  Youve gotta get control of the situation fast though.  If you let it go too long, its much harder to get it back.
ixHwF4apaa	first find out from your heart whether you want<br>  1.permanent<br>  2.temporary<br>  relationship,<br>  be careful, lot of guys are there they clever in cheating, if you publicly express yourselves|`|ZoPln7vaaa	lol, its sounds funny, but I understand how you feel as even I'm tired of finding Mr.Right but never found so far and I almost lost all hopes and I'm just imagining or trying to figure out how does a life goes without Marriage. So, I really can't tell you that one day he'll come but you have to search for one, no one comes knocking your door, its we who need to search for one but shouldn't get depressed or discouraged in between.... Be patient and keep going|`|vPjbSBhJaa	You do have your mindset a little bit backwards. You need to find the right guy first, and then decide whether you want to be in a relationship. I'm glad that you are at least sane enough to admit when you aren't with the right one rather than diving in where you shouldn't go. Don't lower your standards. He's out there waiting for you. All you have to do is find him.|`|YxOWoBZYaa	cant say serious relationship cos at the end u would not want to be with that person as u thought u want to be .. takes time soon the right person will come knocking at ur door .. if ur needy and desperate u would always find rubbish ... trust me

Take me for example, married 14 years. when first married it was joy, then kids came, then stress, then my mother driving us both insane, then the whole family. In the end it turned out my wife saved me from my family and myself by showing me how to believe in myself, how to stand on my own, and how to be happy. <br>  I know she will always be there for me, and I for her. Marriage is the most wonderful thing in the world, if you marry the right person. Good luck!
86PFQF4raa	How love will never wear out with time.We will always love each other.Were,be together until the end of the line.I love you so much cutie pie.|`|GLz2sX28aa	No, babe.  True love never dies.  It grows stronger with time.  That's why it hurts more when you lose him - the longer you are together and that's why it hurts so bad when he hurts you.  Now, if he hurts you long enough, he can DESTROY the love you had for him.<br>  <br>  But, if he treats you right and never leaves you, the passion may fade which can easily be rekindled, but the love is the spirit that is constant.<br>  <br>  True love is the soul, the bond and the strength that make life worth living.  Even real unrequited love sets fire to your soul for years if not decades.|`|xdOgQPEkaa	love does not wear out<br>  <br>  passion does<br>  <br>  at the beginning its very fun and passionate but then u realize one person cannot make u happy 24-7. but u love them regardless. and love settles. <br>  <br>  thas when u know if you ever loved each other. or if it was just passion and lust|`|F4d89iRMaa	sure, if you let it.|`|38dOKBUraa	i believe once you have loved, any kind of love whether its in a friendship or relationship, even if it fade whether from time or situation you never stop caring. i believe all kinds of love just evolve, and change, whether fading to let more in or other reasons. maybe it didnt at all and you just need to search for it. or maybe it just grows stronger.|`|DYsxVQ1jaa	i think some do some dont. i believe you will always care for someone you have once loved.<br>  but i do think the love fades.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	yeah depending how the relationship started, for example if it was only the looks, but if the relationship was based on a friendship and communication im sure that it can last longer|`|SHjn55oAaa	True love never dies, It grows stronger with each day, each argument, and each life changing event!!|`|JH6oCuUZaa	It changes and loses its vitality but those who work on love have a chance on keeping ahead of the changes.|`|zY7boFYNaa	It all depends on your perspective.<br>  <br>  I do not believe so.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Girl no! But it has screwed up a couple mattresses though.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Not if it is true and real.|`|n3pkbRizaa	I still wonder if it exists|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Only if you let the flame die out.  True love never wears out.  All the rest takes work every day.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	True love only gets stronger over time. The union with my wife becomes more evident as the days go by. The, "wanna grow old with you" becomes even more profound as we continue learning one another and learning from one another. If there is one thing I cherish in life, it is the fact that true love is the greatest gift a man can have to share with the woman of his dreams.<br>  <br>  This doesn't go without saying love can fade if it wasn't real to be gin with, or someone is abusing, taking advantage of, etc...the person they are with. Those circumstances can cause an inevitable erosion of love that will lead to divorce/separation.

If you both are in love and ready for any physical relation then this is what he wants from you. If you dont want to have any physical relation then ask him not to do that again but if you want to have physical relation with him then give a company to him and play the same with him.... It depends on you|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	It is intense affection.  |`|d2786c44edfd4f02806b557236eeee8eaa	i think it is just a sign of affection, it could be sexual tho , just wait and see.|`|YGezcAvpaa	it means that he had enough of the movie you two were watching, and wanted to at least make out with you. he has a crush on you, no doubt, so if you like him back, then you should tell him. maybe you two will start a relationship, it is worth a try, if you like him touching you and paying attention to you.|`|Fu7KQieyaa	Affection for sure. But it really depends on the guy.<br>  Myself, I do stuff like that with people who are comfortable enough with me and I'm "cool" with; even snuggling.  If he's normally avoidant, it probably means more to him.  He's probably trying to make you feel comfortable, and if you thought it felt good, probably comfortable enough to get closer to him.<br>  <br>  You're allowed to speak up against it.|`|MgDcKzHyaa	okay first thing you need to know is that sex is always on boy's minds.<br>  <br>  If he is your BFF then he probobly cares about you beyond that, he was probobly just showing you affection and that he cares about you in a way that surpases just freindship. :)|`|ZVuwz1bMaa	This chap is clearly telling you that he wants sex. Affection isn't so direct and should be less intrusive.<br>  Do you feel comfortable with this, or does it freak you out?<br>  <br>  Make you mind up and are you ready for it?|`|9pgb4IpNaa	It means he is trying to get your attention that he likes you, and he is showing you affection.

QqY8YgGDaa	science explained this before|`|AA11501437	why do you choose women that are attracted to jerks?  we are not all like this - i can't stand the jerks.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	I don't agree with being a complete jerk, but being busy and having a life makes a man more attractive.  A man who is too eager makes a woman wonder if he is desperate and/or the type that becomes a stalker.  By too eager, I mean pushing to make constant plans when you first meet, giving over-the-top compliments, etc. She may worry that all you'll want to do is cling to her if you start dating. <br>  <br>  Many women fear having to hurt someone even more than being hurt, too.  So if a woman isn't sure how she feels about you, you being a sweet person may make her hesitant because she does care about your feelings.  So, being a nice guy may actually weed out the game players.|`|AA10865878	Don't be down on yourself for being "too nice". I would prefer a nice guy to a jerk. I'd rather know that the guy has some morals and is a good listener and knows how to please a woman than be with someone who couldn't care if she existed or uses her for sex only. I would like to have a guy who cares to communicate and wants me for all of me than just my body.<br>  <br>  Maybe try going to other places to meet women than where you're finding the ones who chase the "jerk" part of you. Tone down the "jerk" side and keep the "nice guy" part. There are women out there like me who appreciate and want the nice guys.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|87GbTpDNaa	Not all woman are.  Some just like the bad boy type of guys and we can blame Hollywood for that.  <br>  <br>  Be the real person you are.  If you don't find the right woman in your area, you may need to look elsewhere.  There are woman that like nice guys .. we are out here ... we just have a hard time finding guys like you.
6cfdab636ccaf4a70aefcc4c24a14540aa	You do need a reality check.<br>  <br>  First of all, think of what you're going to do after high school. You're probably going to pursue different career paths and maybe even go to different schools. Distance alone can be a deciding factor in whether or not a relationship survives. You're going to meet lots of people once you graduate and you don't necessarily want to be tied down when you're starting the time of your life that allows for the most freedom. Plus, think about it...If you're with this person FOREVER, that means you're going to have another 70-80 years of being with them. Do you think you can handle that?<br>  <br>  Second, you change SO MUCH from age 14 onward. People change more between age 18-25 than any other age.  You haven't even reached that stage yet. You don't know how he's going to handle responsibility, like finances, paying for groceries/rent/loans, how he's going to do in school, how he's going to react to the freedom of getting out of high school, all of that stuff you don't think about when you're 14. <br>  <br>  Of course, it's always POSSIBLE...just very, very unlikely. Don't get your hopes up.<br>  <br>  Regardless of that, good luck!|`|13ad441e093cbc079e39a16db26ef065aa	Anything is possible, but you should know that you are only 14 and you both have long lives ahead of you. When your boyfriend and you talk about getting married and all that, you're not really thinking of the serious side to being married, you're thinking of it as something easy and not serious. So although any thing is possible, just know that you are both still so young and that you should be prepared that maybe one day your lives will take you both in separate directions. Good luck though.|`|P3MIM63Eaa	well its a prooven fact that 89% of women marry their high school sweethearts..but then your only 14 so i really dont no..but i am 14 to and me and my ex went out for 4 months and we talked about getting married and stuff so its pretty normal...don't worry about it....ok thanks for asking though..=)|`|ZmAhvsFaaa	Hun trust me this is just a phase, <br>  I Used to think the same way when i was younger<br>  Your way too Young to discuss Marriage, but trust me <br>  You will not have a thought in your mind about this boy the next four Years things will most definitely change<br>  <br>  
P240bUFxaa	Well once I was in the same situation but it was for Valentines Day.  I only had a couple of bucks.  I went to the store and bought a picture frame that opened up like a book, you know the one with two frames.  Well I put my picture on the left side and wrote him a cute little note on the right.  He really liked it.  You could try something like that.  Hope I helped!
iOpzTvSpaa	usually we remember the first kiss ever and then kisses that were with that one girl you really really liked but nah everything else is just out the door|`|v8Xr0Mn9aa	i think guys remember if they cared anything about you. even when they don't care for you they still remember because in the back of their mind they may say why did i kiss her? they just probably don't get all gooey inside like we do.|`|TNuGoaR7aa	I personally would remember, but that's probably because I've never been kissed before. XP<br>  <br>  I don't see how it would be forgettable in the first place that's just me.|`|XSnj1sxAaa	Depends on how drunk he was or how desperate.<br>  <br>  <br>  TROOF

I know it won't be easy to move on but I'm sure you'll find another cool guy.
qjcTgXcZaa	Even if he didn't ejaculte, men secrete a lubricating fluid (pre-ejaculate) which may contain sperm in it. You could be pregnant. Take a test, and stop stressing. Your period might be late ust because you are stressed.|`|94c983eed26f9fffeb52827bce2a933baa	Go to a local pharmacy and get a pregancy test , they are usually accurate but by all means do not neglect going to a doctor to be sure and if you are afraid to go by yourselve ask someone you know to go with you. But by all means if you are then see what that boyfriend would do if you are and make plans . Some guys bail when they  learn they are a parent way sooner than they want to be.|`|aiRn2lQGaa	does matter if he ejaculated or how short it was, there is still precum that can get you pregnant. take a pregnancy test and get it over with. you're either pregnant or you're not, taking the test later isnt going to make you more or less pregnant. the sooner you know, the sooner you will be able to deal with the outcome.

Friendship is not relative to material opportunities for support.  Friends and peers  who share the commonality of independence can combine resources to build great things.

c32daae8003350ec473ba566bbf3c872aa	Do the right thing.  And I hope he will too.  If he loves you , he will want to protect you and not ask you and your baby to live that dangerous life. Those on the run are sucked into life's gutter and flushed away, never knowing the love and that real family can bring.<br>  <br>  Love, real love is about wanting to give the one you love all the best things in life.  If this guy wants you to come with him, he is unbelievably selfish and not thinking of what is best for you and the baby.  <br>  <br>  Love does not include running away from those who love you just because you do not like their rules or attitudes or just to be with a selfish loser.<br>  <br>  From the scant bit you wrote here, I am guessing this guy is a bit older than you and that he had sex with you at a very early age.  And now you want to run away with him.  Please consider, not only what you will be missing and the gut-wrenching pain and agony you will cause to the ones you leave behind but consider what you are running to.  If he doesn't have the money to pay what he owes, he won't have enough to run and hide.<br>  <br>  Can't you see this guy for what he is?  He has done an incredibly stupid thing and he has associated and done business with dangerous people.<br>    <br>  Most people who start their adult life running, end up addicts, whores and thieves, sad lonely people.  Is that what you want for your baby?  Is it what you want for you.  For your baby?   Do not go with him.  You can make that choice if you are willing live that life but is not fair to force your child into that lifestyle.<br>  <br>  If you are sexually or physically abused at home or with this guy, call the police, but if it is not something like that.  Consider the lifelong hardships and pain for everyone involved.<br>  <br>  I am a parent of a girl who ran away.  For eight years, her mother cried at the mention of her name and I lived every day of those years felling like my heart and my guts were being ripped out of my body while I was still alive.<br>  <br>  My beautiful daughter did okay for a while.  She had several modeling jobs both here in the USA and in Europe but the hole left by being ashamed of leaving her parents kept her from even calling.  Then came marijuana then cocaine and finally heroine.<br>  <br>  She ruined her life, her good looks and the  lives of those who loved her most.  I thank God that she is now clean and sober for 5 years.  She is now, once again part of my life.  She ruined her kidneys and is now on dialysis three or four times a week and living on welfare.<br>  <br>  I tell you this in case this could be you.|`|AA11428459	Speak with a counselor or someone you can trust (older than you) but please do not run away.  This is not a good solution for anyone it will cause you to be in a ton of trouble that's the least thing that could happen, so many other terrible things could happen to you out on your own.  Please reconsider and find someone to speak with.<br>  <br>  Btw your question really isn't that clear as to what the problem is or why you want to run away except that the sex is good? I hope that is not the basis for you to consider putting yourself in a lot of danger by running away.|`|20J2VCxRaa	Please Don't kill yourself Over Someone you Love You know Sometime life Go On people die everyday what you need to say a prayer 4 that person that you will Live a Happy Life that you never 4 get that person...<br>  <br>  God Bless you and have a good day remember said a prayer...|`|FLcqhUf0aa	um  if you really even ever  loved him. you wouldn't.|`|UDpcEqTbaa	im sorry to hear that.

e6Kyqb22aa	I don't really know how to answer this but, I think that you aren't in the wrong. Your friend is just going through a tough time perhaps. Maybe you should give her time or just become less-close and branch out to other people. I understand that she is like a sister to you but I think that she has gone a little too far this time. Think about it, one time she says to tell her anytime if she's being mean and the next she's telling you in what adults would say is a 'nice' way to not be her frined and quit talking to her...that's a little more than mean. I have a friend like that who is always changing her mind. Is Mckenna like that? I should hope not. I hope that you and Mckenne can laugh about this later, as my best friend and I often do at our stupid fights. I wish you the best of luck. BYE|`|9UQlhzitaa	for right now cry it out it is good for you . in time you will either repair the friendships here or make new ones to take there place.<br>  <br>  what is done is done  so you can only go forward and hope you make stronger bonds the next time<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck to you

yRVkloLlaa	As a guy I can tell you once rejected chances are  he won't ask again without a major hint on your part. If you want this man quit fooling around,it's the 21st century...ask him out.

Se um deseja amar e o outro deseja ser amigo já come?a um impasse. Penso que você deve deixar muito claro sua inten??o. Nunca brinque com os sentimentos do outro. Ser claro e objetivo num relacionamento "misto" (você amiga ele amante), é fundamental para que ambos tenham ciência do real sentimento que os cerca. O tempo é o melhor amigo para fazer um sentimento se declarar. Com paciência, jeito e sinceridade você irá descobrir como agir para n?o ferir e ao mesmo tempo para n?o perder uma grande amizade.

KaF0nNFmaa	Here we go, another person to resist change.  Don't people understand change is completely necessary in society? While we have lost things some people have found beneficial, we have also gained things that benefit society.  Problems never go away, or suddenly appear, they just change.<br>  <br>  Some people can't be thankful for the good things that exist today and in my opinion, that is a problem with society today as well as the past.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other Poster:  In a way this post is resisting change.  By thinking the "goold ole days" only had benefits, and wishing things were the same, there would be no progression.<br>  Did you ever stop to consider things aren't as different as you would have them believe?<br>  <br>  Neighbours still help neighbours, I've never heard of anyone calling the cops if their kids weren't home at 6, some people still do not lock their doors at night etc.  You're just being pessimistic.<br>  <br>  If you want to go back to those days, how far back do you want to go?  To segregation?  To the times before women could vote?  Before we had modern medicine?<br>  <br>  These days people have rights, and we have modern medicine, which is saving millions.  The internet is connecting people to information halfway across the world.  We are much more educated now.|`|CoNRevnraa	I'm only 14, but I'd like it if it were that way! <br>  It seems like people had more respect for others back then...of course I don't kno everything about those times, but it seems like it!  :]<br>  <br>  And I don't think you're resisting change (like someone else stated in a comment)! Some people just like the way things used to be, and I guess I don't blame you! :]
e48iAjH3aa	wait it out a little longer, You shouldn't be the one to always send them out, if he doesn't in 2 days, txt him and say something like "way to reply :P" or something ha ha.|`|nfRoYBwwaa	Don't push it!That's a warning...Or he won't want anything.Let him text you.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  krissie:)|`|DskwNSPPaa	maybe he was busy and then by the time he was free he had forgotten you text him. or on the other hand he could of got a bit scared by the Little Talk you had about the future! blokes are easy scared off by commitment! i would just text him once more saying hi hows your day been etc then if he don't text back i think that's your answer! he ain't interested! but hopefully it works out and he has just been busy! good luck! xxxxxxx|`|Em5PSrUgaa	I believe that if a guy likes you and really, really wants you to be in his life, he will find some way to make that happen, no matter the circumstance. <br>  <br>  I commend this guy for admitting up front that at least for him and for now, he is not looking for a live in gf (even though that is not what you wanted either), and that the time and distance is also an issue for him. One that he seems discouraging you from doing anything about, at least for the moment. <br>  <br>  It looks like he is trying to tell you that he likes you well enough, but for now he wants to take it slow, and that could be for numerous reasons. <br>  <br>  As far as the texting, I would not text him until he texted, called, e-mailed, whatever me first. He knows how to get in touch with you; he HAS NOT forgotten. Just make sure that you are truly hearing all that his actions and words are trying to tell you.|`|Wl4TRRS6aa	if he really likes u and loves u ALOT lik u say.. he will contact you..if he doesnt want u 2 move in with him.. think about it.. both of u r far away from eachother.. he had b livin with his wife or GF  where ever he is.. open your eyes mama.. <br>  <br>  <br>  PS.. um.. its kinda hard too so text him once n just put "HI" b/c he might of lost ur number or his phone.... if he doesnt contact u bak.. then 4get it... move on..|`|UYRIJ7ETaa	i think you should wait for him to text you|`|fmkwdNJyaa	I wouldn't text him anymore until he gets back to me.Guys tend to deal with who is there in front of them first, before they deal with "a phone friend". Remember guys are visual and horny. Sorry to say but I know you want to text him but believe me he knows you are expecting him to text you. And people have long distance relationships all the time and guys will go any distance they have to in order to be w/ the one they love. Hold back your emotions, don't text, and one day he will wonder whats going on and text you. Leave your heart out of this decision- they respomd to a girl who acts like that, not one that chases them or cares waaaaay too much
PBdPD748aa	oh sweetie i can completely understand you, when i was younger that used to happen to me at school all the time!!! and this was years and years ago - girls never change!!<br>  <br>  they are definately trying to make you upset. on purpose. they are also trying to make you jealous. so please try and ignore them and stay away from them. dont give them what they want (which is for you to be upset). they seem like very very mean girls and i wouldnt call them friends if i were you!<br>  <br>  surely there are other people you can hang around with at school, or make new friends. dont have anything to do with those 2, cos they will come around and want to be your friend again when they arent getting the reaction from you that they want, but honestly they are really cruel and i dont think you should be friends with them anymore.<br>  <br>  good luck and be strong! your better then those two!
9U7ldO3Maa	the reason for that is is cuz all dudes are dogs. lol try and get a right boyfriend., just dont tell ur mom|`|rxKvdkFyaa	i know how u feel. im 13 and my parents wont let me date until my late years in high school and college. well..unless they know the guy well and his parents. anyways, idk what you can do. parents are pretty set in their ways. i also should tell u that u shouldnt sneak out and have a bf. cuz moms know. lol|`|Bx6xTLRbaa	As long as you're not way too serious, I don't see what the big deal of having a "secret boyfriend" is...but I would feel super guilty (just me).

48BGp8Njaa	Well, if she is your real friend, she will respect you likeing him. Sure, I know, everyone says that but it's true. The best way is to be honest. As for the boy, DO NOT, I REAPEAT, DO NOT flirt with him. It will make you the bad guy. Don't be shallow. and interfear with their relationship. and DO NOT hate her, its not her fault cause she dosent no. Just try to stay positive, and things will fall into place in the end, it may take a while though.<br>  Good luck =)

Now if you're constantly in trouble you're going to go no matter what your mother says but since you're looking to ask for permission then you're probably not.<br>  <br>  I don't know you but you and your mother both know whether you'd get into trouble or not plus you know what you're planning to do there. It's up to you.|`|5LQVhoSSaa	Its simple, tell her that youll go weather she wants you too or not. it may be an empty threat but if she's smart shell see that you will go even without her blessing and think it over.|`|K3jcdkveaa	well would have to be mental to be perfectly fine with it. hahaah, obviously you're not going to be responsible.|`|dcqJjHN6aa	show her you are responsible by telling her that youll bring condoms
GhmGtG3Gaa	Sweetie if you love him, just inform him on whats going on in your head! Let him know that you're beginning to become lonely!! But, don't cheat that would probably be the worst thing that you can do especially if he's working to suppose the both of you!!<br>  Just be strong and try and talk to him about it!
08y217Rdaa	It could be swinging between the girls? If the tension comes from elsewhere, it's too much to concentrate on you alone. Does not sound like friends either. Entertainment, maybe?

But there are things you can do to get through this difficult time. Even in the midst of the sadness and stress of a divorce or breakup, you have an opportunity to learn from the experience and grow into a stronger, wiser person.<br>  In This Article:<br>  Healing after a divorce or breakup <br>  Allow yourself to grieve <br>  Reach out to others <br>  Take care of yourself <br>  Learning important lessons <br>  Related links <br>  Print  Authors<br>  Text Size<br>  Healing after a divorce or breakup<br>  Why do breakups hurt so much, even when the relationship is no longer good? A divorce or breakup is painful because it represents the loss, not just of the relationship, but also of shared dreams and commitments. Romantic relationships begin on a high note of excitement and hope for the future. When these relationships fail, we experience profound disappointment, stress, and grief.<br>  <br>  A breakup or divorce launches us into uncharted territory. Everything is disrupted: your routine and responsibilities, your home, your relationships with extended family and friends, and even your identity. A breakup brings uncertainty about the future. What will life be like without your partner? Will you find someone else? Will you end up alone? These unknowns often seem worse than an unhappy relationship. <br>  <br>  Recovering from a breakup or divorce is difficult. However, it’s important to know (and to keep reminding yourself) that you can and will move on. But healing takes time, so be patient with yourself. <br>  <br>  Coping with separation and divorce<br>  Recognize that it’s OK to have different feelings. It’s normal to feel sad, angry, exhausted, frustrated and confused—and these feelings can be intense. You also may feel anxious about the future. Accept that reactions like these will lessen over time. Even if the marriage was unhealthy, venturing into the unknown is frightening. <br>  Give yourself a break. Give yourself permission to feel and to function at a less than optimal level for a period of time. You may not be able to be quite as productive on the job or care for others in exactly the way you’re accustomed to for a little while. No one is superman or superwoman; take time to heal, regroup and re-energize. <br>  Don’t go through this alone. Sharing your feelings with friends and family can help you get through this period. Consider joining a support group where you can talk to others in similar situations. Isolating yourself can raise your stress levels, reduce your concentration, and get in the way of your work, relationships and overall health. Don’t be afraid to get outside help if you need it. <br>  Source: Mental Health America<br>  <br>  Allow yourself to grieve the loss of the relationship <br>  Grief is a natural reaction to loss, and the breakup or divorce of a love relationship involves multiple losses:<br>  <br>  Loss of companionship and shared experiences (which may or may not have been consistently pleasurable) <br>  Loss of support, be it financial, intellectual, social, or emotional <br>  Loss of hopes, plans, and dreams (can be even more painful than practical losses) <br>  Allowing yourself to feel the pain of these losses may be scary. You may fear that your emotions will be too intense to bear, or that you’ll be stuck in a dark place forever. Just remember that grieving is essential to the healing process. The pain of grief is precisely what helps you let go of the old relationship and move on. And no matter how strong your grief, it won’t last forever.<br>  <br>  Tips for grieving after a breakup or divorce:<br>  Don’t fight your feelings – It’s normal to have lots of ups and downs, and feel many conflicting emotions, including anger, resentment, sadness, relief, fear, and confusion. It’s important to identify and acknowledge these feelings. While these emotions will often be painful, trying to suppress or ignore them will only prolong the grieving process. <br>  Talk about how you’re feeling – Even if it is difficult for you to talk about your feelings with other people, it is very important to find a way to do so when you are grieving. Knowing that others are aware of your feelings will make you feel less alone with your pain and will help you heal. Journaling can also be a helpful outlet for your feelings. <br>  Remember that moving on is the end goal – Expressing your feelings will liberate you in a way, but it is important not to dwell on the negative feelings or to over-analyze the situation. Getting stuck in hurtful feelings like blame, anger and resentment will rob you of valuable energy and prevent you from healing and moving forward. <br>  Remind yourself th|`|ywoph0FVaa	well, you need to dig down deep and make yourself happy so you aren't so depressed anymore. next, you don't need a girl to be truly happy. if she's not willing to commit then she won't want to be with you anyway. you need to find someone that will love you and be willing to commit. good luck!|`|satoCRC6aa	get some counseling ASAP<br>  church pastor , or local clinic<br>  suicide hot-line will help|`|AA11596133	YES, YOU NEED A PROFESSIONALS HELP - SO GO GET IT.

What has he told you? If he told you that he doesnt like him, then take him at his word. If he lies to you then you know what the deal is. But the adult thing to do is ask him, give him the benefit of the doubt and dont obsess. Hurt happens whether we let it happen or not. Heartbreak doesnt need permission. So prepare yourself. You have asked him and need to trust him unless he has given you a reason not to. Once he gives you that reason, then you let him go and dont look back.|`|pfGP0HXHaa	Im a guy and seriously, rejection or being dumped HURTS (both pride and emotions).

Im not saying be rude and mean.  But yeah dont douse them with compliments when you barely know them.  Complimenting a girl is nice but let them earn it.  Something like "Hey i have a secret"  when they ask what tell them youll tell them later.  If they remember you have the secret tell them with a compliment like "You have pretty eyes" just leave it at that.  <br>  <br>  Trick is to get her thinking about you and keep her interest as long as you can.  plus when you compliment her all the tiem they kinda lose their little special touch|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Work on your looks then.Next time a girl starts whining over her sorry jerk b/f just say "hey babe drop the chump and let's hook up.I'll treat you right."<br>  If she says no, then say you do not want to hear about her  personal problems then, to tell her g/fs.<br>  You'll weed out the losers this way.|`|CzS1EiV9aa	You need to have an edge to you.  Girls don't like a guy that is too nice.  Try not being so reliable and dependable.  Ask for dates straight up with no wimpy talk.  Always go for the kiss at the end of a date.  She can't really like you until she respects you for wanting nothing less than a great relationship.  You may lose some so called friends, in order to get a real girlfriend.|`|Bd16ixUQaa	Not knowing you or the girls its hard to say but it could have to do with the type of girl you're interested in.<br>  Some girls are into bad boys others are not.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm always keeping my eye out for the sweetest guy in the bunch and I like to date people I've been friends with first.  But that's just me.  A lot of girls are different.<br>  <br>  So, maybe set your sights on girls who like the type of guy you are.

dL6BcJQxaa	Truth hurts sounds like your friend is bi. Even if your friend is not sure what gender he's attracted to let him explore the different genders give him a chance to really find who or what he's really attracted too. No matter what just be there for your friend life is rough people will ridicule & make fun of him thats just the way it is.

Gah...<br>  <br>  I have a best friend who's gay, and he's been struggling with telling his parents and kids make fun of him at skool...<br>  You just need to make sure you're there for him, because a lot of ppl think that being bi or gay is extremly wrong (which I think it's wrong, but I don't judge people bcuz they can't help it!) and kids will probably make fun of him just because he's different. <br>  <br>  I don't think you're reacting the wrong way! <br>  It's great that he has you to be there for him! :]|`|ff078bb3cd9a1ea443fc4bc1dcb20d36aa	I went through something similar with a girl friend of mine and all you can do as a friend is to be supportive of what makes them happy.  It's possible it is just part of the fad, but that's for nobody to judge.  If he truly is bi, he's found happiness, if not then he'll sort it out.  Human sexuality is a complicated thing to explain and to figure out.  I would just say just talk to him, with love and compassion, there's no way to know if it's just a fad, but if it is then time will fade it out, as far as his boyfriend goes you can't always protect the ones you love.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Honestly I think you're being too hard on him. He doesn't need to PROVE that he's bi to you. Why are you questioning him so much? He's your friend, give him the benefit of the doubt. If he's been bi or whatever for a long time, odds are he's not faking it.|`|tTkLgQduaa	few people are bisexual, they usually choose a gender and he just says he's bi so it doesn't sound that bad, it's so cool the way you acted toward your friend, my best friend's a total homophobe

Vr6L81iiaa	Well I don't know about them, but I think that's pretty cool. Just don't be immature and talk like perverts or anything. Personally I would love to go so I think you should totally invite them. And yes it would entertain us, we're not from another planet you know lol. We like doing normal things too. Just have fun.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Sure, why not?  As long as they are having fun, is what matters the most.|`|riXZ026Faa	Invite them both. Tell the girl you like to come with you into a romantic place in your house or something and tell her that you like her.|`|EW95Go90aa	wow, youre screwed... only invite them if their friends are coming as well, nothing worse than a bored girl that YOU invited to YOUR party|`|JjsArGujaa	Awh how cute (: haha yeah, if i were those girls.. i'd like that. good luck tho!
nHeTLBzyaa	I really cant say the reason why, because im not a player myself!<br>  They probably do it because they are just addicted to sex or whatever they do and yes they may just do it to make themselves feel big and to impress their mates!!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	They lack self confidence. So having all these women makes them feel powerful. Its pitiful.|`|RFeYz59maa	I think because they are EXTREMELY hurt on the inside. I think they really don't take heartbreak well or they don't have any confidence like the girl above me said, and therefore they get as many women as possible to try to make themselves feel bigger than what they really are. Sometimes there are just scared to comit because they feel like they will have no life. That's what I  think though.|`|i5xByO9naa	I think its a waste of time but what comes around goes around. (probably they have a small pipi and make up for it in that way.|`|x7uYAPaSaa	Its confidence issues. They cant stand to alone i suppose, so if they have loads of girls at once then they know they wont be until all of them find out!|`|kNqS12qwaa	im not like that im happy with one girl lol but players just like the ego boost prove to them self they can manipulate woman and get what they want weather its sex or control its pathetic
nz27NvPwaa	I agree with you about kissing, at least the intimate kind, that it should have an emotional value. Unfortunately, some don't see it that way and sometimes I don't blame them.<br>  For men? Because:<br>  1. He can.<br>  2. He's immature.<br>  3. In his defense, there's always some girls willing to be a part of it.<br>  4. He's not ready to settle down.<br>  5. He wants to have a good time.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Because he's a guy and guys can separate love and sex. They see sex as a recreational activity. It's fun and they enjoy it, especially when they're young.|`|WPZI510laa	cause dudes are pigs|`|2S2onP86aa	Because he is immature and shallow. Maybe he's keeping a note of record in his pocket of how many girls he can kiss. So stupid.|`|JCdBSULraa	We all do, the difference is that you fail as a woman by letting him get away with it.|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	he's a guy and doesnt want anything serious|`|azbt1xddaa	He's a guy.  probably wants to prove he can get with whoever he wants too|`|TeBco1s7aa	because making out with girls is awesome
x7NtYD8Aaa	Well, 11.<br>  Jeez. Where to start...<br>  Just don't have sex....until youre at least like 18. You can satisfy your needs in other ways...if you know what im talking about. <br>  Ive always said...<br>  Sex can wait...just masterbate.|`|PK2mFkQ5aa	youre eleven. if you have a single shred of common sense, you know that you shouldnt, and you wont, have sex. even if you do use a condom, it doesnt matter. you arent ready for sex, and certainly now what may come afterwards (emotionally, physically, etc etc.)<br>  <br>  Its certainly normal to have thoughts about sex at that age (your hormones and all are acting up) but DO NOT have sex.|`|pEfEOuu9aa	Just masturbate to satisfy your ergs and get to learn your body before you do something so stupid and get yourself pregnant or get a disease.. your to young so have fun yourself  :)|`|6aQi4sHeaa	Your hormones are going crazy sooooo thats kinda normal I think. but 11 is way too young to have sex. Your not even a teenager yet so thats NOT going to be good if you get pregnant. I would wait till about 16 at the very least. Even if you dont have your period, theres still a chance you can get pregnant. If I were you I really would wait. That one little incident could ruin your whole life soo we dont want that too happen. And your still young so enjoy all the ups of being a kid.
e6Kyqb22aa	Give me break, you have got to have someone you talk to! Go hangout and with someone or something. And if you just can't seem to find a good friend, don't worry. Just do well on quizzes and tests and such. If you don't have anyone to hangout with, you can at least to well in school, right? I hope this helped :)|`|yjyBbVJoaa	I didn't have any friends at high school. I spent my time reading and studying. Looking back on it now I could have done something about it. Joined clubs outside of school and made friends or talked to some teacher to help me out. If its awful you can talk to someone about moving to another school. But thats a last resort.|`|5naXaUmPaa	Easy. You study.<br>  <br>  Sure, a lot of people say that High School is the time in your life to do stupid things with stupid people and have fun like there's tomorrow - but let's face it; you can't go anywhere when you have zero memories of what you learn there and has no educations of whatsoever.<br>  <br>  But don't be those people that studies by force - no, that would make your life horrible, believe me. Try to find something that you love, and make a group (or join) so that you can enjoy your high school life better. You can survive without friends, I supposed, but I don'tt think ANYONE can live through boredom. ^^<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|epHqpcxzaa	dude i never had any friends in high school and now guess what senior year 2nd semester halfway through and now i get friends i got 2 months left what was the point well i just did my work kept a book at my side and went to the library for lunch yes i was a total dork and i hate preps they always think their better than you
6eab4b3bcfe099adea6e536cf375ba45aa	HE had something to tell you
xoXkHOVsaa	It could work out if you are both mature people.  The problems that may come up are things like money, maturity, education, and life experience.  He's probably going to be a bit ahead of you on most of those.<br>  <br>  Don't get too serious too fast.|`|8IfePMa3aa	One major issue - while the law considers you an adult, you're not. People don't fully mature mentally until 25/26. <br>  He's already molded into the person he's going to be as an adult and will make small changes as time goes, while you're still discovering and changing and a very rapid pace.|`|x7uYAPaSaa	Your both mature to be in a stable relationship. Your over the age of 16, and 18, so its not really a problem. Your an adult. He's an adult, there wouldnt be any problems. Maybe a few comments here and there but what the hell|`|AA10500537	i think it;s fine  as long  to date as long as he;s a nice guy. but i wouldn;t get in a serious relationship. .<br>  take  things slow.
7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	it's not as much fun as having sex. but it's just one of the things us grown up women have to do.<br>  and by the way, you probably do have an std.  you seem to have worked hard to get one, i hope you enjoy that too.|`|fSkt7SgDaa	You can always change your ways. Your infection feeling could be an STD but it could also just be a Urinary Tract Infection. Plus if you have slept with people your own age the odds of them having an STD so young is pretty slim so try not to worry. I'm sorry that I can't provide any info about the gyno though I have no experience there.|`|QPp7zQQpaa	Regardless of whatever ALWAYS use a condom.<br>  <br>  As for the doctor, he cannot tell your mom what you do not want him to tell her as long as it does not pose a threat or risk to your health, if that is what has you worried. Yes, he will know you have had sex, and yes, he will know if you have an Std, but the bull has to be taken by the horns, not the tail.<br>  As for taking bc, your mom is right, You never know what can happen and it's better to be safe than sorry (pregnancy wise, if you want to not worry about Std's or HIV, use a condom).<br>  Your guy loves you and supports you. Do not rush things with him, ok?<br>  This might be your chance to Make Love for the first time (Make Love, with capitals).
62e9ba78ee48eedceb41743f5846f0a9aa	I didn't read all of it, but I think you should talk to her, apologize to her.  Talk it out.  Im sure everything will be ok.  Its just middle school.  Things will get 10x better and 10x worse when you get in high school. That's the stuff to worrie about not this.<br>  <br>  (Stop treating ppl like crap, that wont fly with everyone, some ppl will really do something about it)|`|t0KEO6xdaa	Hmmm...<br>  Just apologize to your friend. Simple as that.|`|WF085j2Daa	ROFL thanks for that ROFLH
BKr3y30maa	I think you are crazy but I wish you the best of luck.  The idea of being set up to marry someone that I may not ever become romantically attracted to, doesn't sound too good to me.|`|jUS9ATdMaa	Maybe your not the marring type.Maybe you need to have a friend with benefits and go from there.

E2OKRhwYaa	She probably thinks if she continues that way things will grow into something and you'll become more then friends which might end the friendship. She does however seem to like you, so maybe you two need to sit down and have an actual talk because she seems to be confused and sending mixed signals.
3g9Sq0ICaa	He seems to like you and he's a bit shy...just a bit. Anyway, I think you should start conversations too.<br>  <br>  Cheers!
ZA3bbxDpaa	I think you may need to do both. First, talk to her and tell her how you feel. Tell her that her comments bother you, and ask her if she really feels that way about you. Maybe she doesn't realize she's beeing catty. If she seems surprised and apologetic and you notice a change afterward, then all's good. But if she acts like she doesn't know what you're talking about or tells you you're crazy or exaggerating, just cut ties with her. You don't need poisonous people in your life, even if it seems like they are the ONLY people/person in your life. You'll make new and better friends eventually.|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	you can't pick your parents or siblings, but you can pick your friends. Pick wisely. This one should be thrown back into the pond.<br>  <br>  life isn't fair, she blames you for handing her the sh*t end of the stick while your holding the good side. She doesn't know how to count her own blessings, just blame others for her misgivings.
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Wow, that sounds like a pretty tense situation and thankfully for you its won’t last to much longer. I suggest you just do your best to keep out of his way, have as little contact with him as possible and if you do keep the conversations short and to the point.  Two months is not long and it will go pretty fast. I  won’t ask about the “other’ things you speak of that your dealing with, but I think I can guess.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Sounds like you already have the plan down. <br>  You have to focus on your plans to launch. I'd suggest keeping your head down and maintaining a low profile.<br>  <br>  Your mother needs to focus on her own future and plan accordingly... she really should consider her options carefully. If he is leaving without her, she needs to file for divorce to get 1/2 of all assets acquired  marriage.|`|tPMNAFbsaa	I lived in a house before with someone who persecuted me all day long, everyday. I just had to get out as soon as I could. It was really bad. I cried all day etc... He is not really bothering as I understand and you are moving soon anyways. Just ignore him for now.|`|9Ve6jDSyaa	to be honest, it doesn't matter what you tell him, he will continue to be the same. As you said you will try to keep busy and be nice to him. That's the best you can do. The other thing is see if a friend will let you stay at their place for the month. Or see if the family can pitch in for him a motel room and take him there. Let him know he is making things complicated by staying with your family. This could help the whole family. But my prayers are with you. Hang in there and this too shall pass!|`|DvyLmPfnaa	I had to live once, with a person that i hate. It was my sister`s boyfriend, and he could be real rude many times, and could upset me for real! But you know, you have to do it 2 months only, which is not a huge time, due it is gonna pass somehow!<br>  Keep busy, try to be nice to him, try to avoid him and do your own stuffs. Don`t pay attention if he id negative to you but pretend like you care what he says. Perhaps he is jealous on you achieving much more in life without any help, and especially without his help. :)<br>  Good Luck, it`s just two months!|`|vdfEE7WTaa	Oh yeah, but worse. I've lived with my dad all my life, but when I was 13 we moved, and he went 6 months before to set us up. I realized that he'd been telling me horrible, self-esteem killing things and that his pressure was what killed my desire to study and enjoy hobbies.<br>  It took me 2 months to learn not to stiffen when I hear a car park near our house in the afternoon, and by 3 I'd stopped having a panic rush of adrenaline when I heard a key in the lock. I had never noticed it until he was gone. It changed my whole realization of why I was the way I was.<br>  You can start studying in the school library after school, say it's because it's quiet, there are no distractions just resources. Join something, it'll keep you out of the house and get you credit at school. A sport will help you blow off steam.<br>  If you wanna lie, invent a project that's very important and that you wanna get done just right. Get something off the internet (a science paper, whatever) so that if he's the type who expects you to work 24/7, you have something to show to account for the relaxation time he resents you taking.|`|99532CAkaa	I would tell him how I feel, because if you don't it will bother you for the rest of your life trust me I know, I finally got to tell my biological father how I felt and let me tell you it was like a big load lifted off of me..|`|X2QUJsUaaa	Your step-father is being a rude inconsiderate d!ck. Sorry to say, but it's true. He's miserable so he's hell bent on making everyone else miserable till he's happy. Never mind leaving your mother and you. If there is no reason for a divorce, their must be reason why he's not taking your mom with him.<br>  <br>  As how to deal with him in the mean time; when he gives you **** calmly assert how he is making you feel and you do not appreciate it. Tell him he's caste of your family so what he says does not matter. Once that is said just ignore him. Just like he does not exist.<br>  <br>  If you must really get out go cruise the mall, watch some movies. Go to the library and study. <br>  <br>  L
AA11635143	I would grab that trophy in a nanosecond.  A guy who is pure and innocent is probably a virgin; that's the kind you can trust with your heart.  You can explore and enjoy new and exciting experiences that he hasn't shared with anyone else.<br>  <br>  Why would anyone want a guy who has had sex with every slut in town?  You wouldn't know if he's a walking STD factory until he dropped something on you that penicillin won't cure.|`|afddcc5c0685175e20cfdf427ba65856aa	I hate the implicatioin that someone is pure or innocent. <br>  Someone may have had a sexual experience and one may not. Neither of them is either pure or innocent. <br>  Having had a sexual growth experience does not make us unpure and it does not make us any less innocent.<br>  We come into a new relationship, a virgin to that relationship. What we create as a couple is a new energy that the world has never known.<br>  Sex does not make us dirty, not having sex does not make us pure.|`|HPtpfqFJaa	No, I mean ideally its a nice idea to have a guy thats as innocent as you, but on the other hand, I think a little experience would make things better.<br>  <br>  When I was a virgin I wanted a guy that wasn't, just because he knew what he was doing.<br>  <br>  And I don't mean a manwhore either, just someone that has been in a relationship before.|`|mb82SDnMaa	yes|`|cxDXgxj2aa	everybody is different but a descent guy isnt hard to find but noone is perfect noone is pure or innocent.but peoples inperfections makes them perfect|`|vbhtAHbDaa	Absolutely!

AA10065812	???????<br>  Your rights are a major concern, but even more is the fact that you butt is hanging out in the could and could get kicked at any time within the next 18 years.<br>  <br>  If she does have your child, and depending on your state laws, she can wait up to 23 years and file retroactive child support for the whole time period.  It would be based on your level of income at the time, so you would be looking at around $300,000.<br>  <br>  So, you need to file an injunction against her ordering her to produce evidence that she did not have a child, and if she did, a DNA test to determine if you are the father.  For this, you will need an attorney, so you will need to learn how to interview and hire an attorney, as well as more, if it is your child.<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.

If she is keeping your child, you definitely have rights.  Do a little research, and then cool your heels.

I know... im 20 and I have had my fair share of heartbreaks.<br>  If your making the choice to go to college then there are plenty of people you can meet there.<br>  Just follow your heart. <br>  <br>  If you two do decide to get together then yes, that might hurt your relationship with your best friend. So you have to think, which is more valuable, My friend or a girl. I know it sucks but that's what you have to do.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helped you out.<br>  :)

AA11312068	Most girls love guys who open up with music. It just makes a guy seem sensitive and girls like that in a guy.

My boyfriend is a terrible singer and can't play any instrument, but it's not like I wouldn't be with him only because he wasn't a good singer.|`|NX5Pr9yFaa	ok guitar is soooo overrated nowadays. there used to be 2 guitar players and now every1 trying to learn.  even this nerdy dude who every1 hates<br>  i think u should try something else unless that girl doesnt agree with me or likes guitar people|`|JjsArGujaa	My boyfriend sings and plays guitar, and everytime he leaves me a voicemail playing secondhand serenade, my heart just melts. (: i think it's the cutest thing ever!|`|XtvI9cVHaa	if you wrote a song for the girl like that guy and that song "hey there Delila"|`|0tupg3kFaa	i totally would love that.u should go for it!!!! i bet she would love it. just don't play it constantly or else it would get kinda annoying. good luck!!!!|`|zY7boFYNaa	It depends on the girl,<br>  I will find it, wow pretty neat.|`|amg1MG9Vaa	most girls lovee guys who play guitar|`|6nttIiY2aa	YES ?<br>  def if its acoustic;)
ZjXJaPozaa	if u dont wnt to get back why you talking hot with him?|`|iS94TGdxaa	dont talk 2 your ex anymore--that simple--if u talk 2 him that means u must still like him-  or else u wouldnt b waisting your time
jks5MxiNaa	Try to talk about current events and things from the news.
swM63FBXaa	Prepare  Pounded    yam  with  Egusi  soup for him,and  he  will  do it  all  day,and  that   will be   special,but  dont  kiss  him   too  much.......
kDjmqYG9aa	bro trust me ask her early so she doesn't ask any1 else.|`|MXpW48lFaa	Yes, of course. Ask her, what have you got to loose?<br>  And yes do it now then. So she has time to pick out her dress, hairstyle, shoes, jewelery and make-up.|`|z20FPXO8aa	yes|`|4VvJoFNaaa	yeah it's a good time to ask her because if she says yes then it gives your more than enough time to figure out what colors you guys are going to wear and all that other stuff and if she says no then that give you more than enough time to find another date.|`|lfsxZA59aa	Definetly. Ask her right away. That way if she says no, you will have enough time to ask someone else. But if that girl says no, then go with your friends, that is if you have any.|`|Dc5m4k81aa	THAT IS A HUGE NONO!!!!!! TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE'S WHO'S HAD SOOOO MUCH EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA. Ask her in April.. On the 14th.. ;D|`|oPY3I1hOaa	oh yes defintely!<br>  the sooner the better (:<br>  Good Luck (:|`|ycv1tk1gaa	Ehh it's still kinda early. If you're dating her than maybe, but if you are just wanting to because you have a crush on her you should wait about a month. Also if you know of somebody else that's going to ask her you shouldn't wait.|`|jh60fzISaa	Yeah deffo ask early give you time to match your outfits !|`|lR8DR4tmaa	I'd say the first friday of April.
NDFN04sqaa	It is kind of funny - something for you two to laugh about later - but if that happened it is just a compliment to the girl, at least that is how i would feel.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	It would then be a turn on if I was attracted to him. If not, then I wouldn't pursue the relationship.|`|ablriuUVaa	wow thats emberessing, btw that girl that said she doesnt care cuz she sick is just a big baby|`|YIPIIXHlaa	I think it's cute.|`|NgGpaQrqaa	im sick, i dont care about your problems.
arr9xM6Baa	well i turned 16 last week, maybe I'd have bothered going to my detention, which would mean I wouldn't be going to one tomorrow!|`|66jX06Onaa	I would have paid more attention to my schooling and made a plan for my life - even if I wasn't sure I wanted to do a particular job forever. Living in the moment and not making plans and not finishing school was a huge mistake.|`|QPp7zQQpaa	I would take each and every chance i got to do more out of my life. I have traveled, a lot, learned, a lot, but i turned down a scholarship to study abroad because i did not want to leave my boyfriend (whom i married and later cheated on me, ha ha). I got an offer to train with an Israeli company and turned it down because i did not want to leave my mom for a year. Now i regret not doing it.<br>  <br>  Squeeze life to the last drop. That's what i'd say.|`|bMLdEkncaa	probably the clothes i wore and to show ppl my personality and to not let ppl say the neagtive shi* they said about me.....oh and i would have involved myself into more sports|`|T5uOsAgraa	definitly not payin enough attention at school big mistake, you just dont realise at 16 how important it is|`|b17a48df36c34a162276766c7b3fa8b0aa	Life is a mixed bag, you might as well enjoy it
UJD2eYebaa	Think he has developed cold feet & is going to extremes because he is not ready for marriage (too immature maybe)?|`|8wDXm4Kiaa	Sounds like you are dealing with someone who is irrational and makes immature decisions.  It also seems as if your fiance has someone on the side.  I know this isn't what you want to hear, but this is what i've seen in my experience.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|B53KDVuJaa	It seems to me like he was looking for an easy excuse out of the relationship by blowing something minor completely out of proportion. I don't know how you accept the fact you may never speak to him again. I'm sure eventually you will get your chance. The fact he won't even face you shows what a coward he is. Just be glad you didn't actually marry this guys. Sounds like a loser.|`|6afa558f5f7db4c42e087d9a9cac01b7aa	the  father  of  my  child  did  the  same   to  me..  mind  you  with  a  restraining  order   and  keeping  a  3  months child  away  from me..<br>  it  was  worse  for  he  even  used  my  stautus  against  me  and  treated    me  like  crap.<br>  <br>  but  in  every  situation you  must  always  look  at  the  positve  side..<br>  most  of  all  we  just  never  loose  in  this  life..  out  of  every  bad  situation  comes  wisdom  and  strength  and  every  good  situation we  cheerish  the  memories  for  ever.<br>  <br>  take  care  of  ur  self .  look  great  and  do    good so  you  feel  good  inside  and  surround  ur  self  with good  freinds  and  prayer  for  strengh.<br>  as  for  wanting  to  take  it  out  you  might  want  to  wait  on  that  because  you  dont  want  to  go  out  without  your  pride and  dignity and  most  of  all  sound  desparate and  stupid.<br>  <br>  accept and  find  the  inner  you  and  just  be  happy and  trust  me  a  great  man will  come  along.<br>  most  of the  time  the  most  horrible  things  that  happen  to  us  are  actually  the  best  things that  happend  if  you  look  at  it  with  time.<br>  <br>  you  will  heal and  stay  strong..  this  too  will  pass  and  one  day  you  will  laugh  about  it

If he cared about her at all he wouldn't ask you that|`|2wsVYpPLaa	what the heck?
MMF1YmZZaa	Yes, he was probably attracted to you, but I don't think you really want to date a 20 year old when you are 15. In most cases it is a very big maturity difference! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|IFHzCyOkaa	if anything he was attracted to you.<br>  a 20 year old college student wouldn't go out with a 15 year old high school student.<br>  that's stupid on so many levels.<br>  not to mention the fact that it's illegal.|`|Aomga6Tiaa	who cares if he liked you hes five years older than you. you cant legally date him for another three years. forget him.|`|TNuGoaR7aa	He probably did like you.  And it's not THAT wrong for him to date you.  My brother dated a 16 year old when he was 22.
AA10370707	Go for it! You are so lucky! The guy that said that I deserved better turned out being right, and that broke my heart, but this guy seems genuine, so give it another go! Don't let this chance pass you by or you might end up regretting it for a long, long time, trust me, I know.
USpiaIqJaa	make the hints stronger...<br>  <br>  if that doesn't work, then your going to have to tell him.|`|IQMb47chaa	Probably not - guys are pretty clueless. Just tell him or go for the kiss:)|`|1SCzxmKYaa	If you like him tell him, before one day he leaves. Cause I left home and only now I wished she or I asked each other out! LET HIM KNOW|`|QhRO0kcMaa	LOL<br>  I'm pretty sure he's getting the hints. But i'm also sure he's thinking the same thing. "she isnt getting it!" etc. :]
X8pxK5Vyaa	if you wanna hang out with him, just<br>  call him and be likee " heyy, im bored, you wanna hang out n do somthingg?"<br>  but if your to shyy, or worried he'll say no,<br>  just say "me and some of my friends are hanging out today you wanna hang with us?"<br>  good luckk. hope i helpedd :]|`|590En2oFaa	Once I had a girl call me randomly and wanted me to visit her at work because she was "bored".  That was her way of hinting to me "hey lets hang out sometime".  Some girls are straight forward while others mess with guy' heads.  It's all in the way they come across.|`|aD7FyeFAaa	just ask if he would like to hang out with you and some of the girls. Tell him that you dont know his friends as well and the girls just want some time wit their fave guy! Just tell him
a3d582acb2b30b257fb8d82c57713a25aa	He might be shy.|`|AA11116171	maybe he feels like you don't care because you were talking to a bunch of other guys but not him.. he may think you don't want to talk to him so he just figured he would let you be.  guys can be really shy, make the move to talk to him first.  In the relationship I am in, I made the first move and I am glad I did.  I was nervous but I did it and I am still alive.
aLLWID9xaa	VK: if you feel that something is not making you happy, is that you've been hurt once, and now you're afraid to be hurt again. That′s the reason you can't be really and absolutely happy.<br>  I think that you should trust your heart, if you′re hesitating about him, it's for something. Women has a special instint with that. <br>  Be careful, if you′re not happy, that's a sign that something's wrong about him.<br>  Axel|`|Pekf9TEQaa	Yes this is normal....so give him a chance and see what happens. But if your truly not happy then you have to let him go. If you stay you'll find every reason to argue with him or show your distrust with him. Get out of the cycle of being hurt... just get to know, love and trust yourself until you can happily say you can let go of the past and trust again. <br>  being in a relationship when your not happy is a recipe for disaster,|`|VQYsHocKaa	dont trust him with all your heart, he should be happy that you have given him another chance but if he hurts you again then he doesnt deserve more chances. Like i said though dont give him all your heart. Speak to him, tell him you dont feel very happy. why dont you try to go and do something together on your own and see if you feel any better?|`|zs4Rpa6Vaa	i had the same thing happen she left me for another guy and fucked him then begged me to come back and i did, now we r happily engaged and have a baby coming in june. i felt the same way u did for the first few months. just give it time, and talk about everything that is bothering you.|`|4tXpsLP1aa	Well..Why did you break up in the first place? If he cheated, it's bound to happen again.|`|1uRUaSblaa	Trust NEEDS time to cultivate especially <br>  now that you both have chosen to put <br>  the irreversible past aside and start afresh.<br>  <br>  Have more open talks with him, without being<br>  critical or judgmental.He can't guess your feelings.<br>  Let him know your fear of being hurt again,<br>  so that he can reassure you. Don't bottle up<br>  all the negative feelings.Whenever there's doubt <br>  abt anything, adopt the 'sit down & talk' system<br>  to clarify matters. Allow the relationship to be <br>  rebuilt all over again with patience & understanding|`|8xx3uk4Jaa	i feel ya!<br>  i told my bf honestly and truly i trust him but not fully with my heart yet. but i can eventually. <br>  bcuz he had it all at one time but then lost it.<br>  if u urself think its true love then dont go with wat other ppl say<br>  and stay with him.<br>  cuz at the end of the day.<br>  who do u care for?<br>  urself right? and maybe him?<br>  okay then.<br>  thats wat i went through with my bf.<br>  and now that he knows that..he was understanding and our relationship is a lot stronger

Sigmund Freud, a popular Psychologist, said that everything we do are based on two things... sex and aggression. You ever have those times when your parents ask you... "Why did you do this?" or "Why are you doing that?" Well... Most times, we don't know. But subconsiously, it is all about the sex and aggression. There are lots of people who think they are in the relationship for the relationship when subconsiously, they are in it for the sex. But then again... there ARE people who say they only want sexual relations but also care about the romance and "love" It's really complex once you think about it.|`|z3R61VzCaa	at first it might seem like they really like you but its all about the action for guys! trust me, i know. <br>  and u dont have to get a guy just b/c you "put out"..<br>  i dont and i have guys that like me.

I'm a Christian and have physical urges like any other guy but don't let them take over. Just a personal religious choice.

Granted that at some point it does become an essential part of it, however, the mind also loves to be stimulated.|`|5dVYnX1yaa	sooner or later you will get a guy. there are boyz out there who just wana be loved just like you|`|sMkJGmXaaa	It should be an escalation. Begin with maybe just holding hands or a little innocent kiss and just escalate every time.|`|VJP1zL4uaa	depends on the person.<br>  high school level though thats what most boys think about and some girls<br>  <br>  dont put out until your ready<br>  you will regret it<br>  save it for someone really special|`|ZsWoSTCxaa	most guys do <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  those r the kind i dont date!!!!!
HzevoVflaa	Hi Carolyn, firstly, I am sorry things didn't work out with Felicity8s dad and yourself, life sucks sometimes.<br>  As to a rebound, well that would depend how long you have been single, and if you are dating the guy for the right reasons.<br>  After a long term relationship has broken up, it's easy to fall for the first person that comes along, especially if he is so different from your ex, and makes you feel all the things that your ex had not towards the end of the relationship.<br>  personally, I recommend 6 to 8 weeks between a break up and finding a new partner, quite simply to allow you both to make sure that you have made the decision to split for the right reasons, and not just some knee jerk reaction to something that has happened.<br>  It's so easy to think that this guy is a knight in shining armour and the best thing since sliced bread, particularly when you are feeling down, so take the time to re evaluate what you want out of life, and make sure that any new guy is going to be right not only for you, but for Felicity as well.<br>  He needs to realise you come as a package, and that he can't have one without the other.<br>  Good luck lass, I wish you well,<br>  Mike t.|`|x9FienLUaa	yep- if u recently broke up
AA11924441	It kinda sounds your already there, so what the heck ask her out for a bite to eat...go bowling together...she likes you , you like her just go out and do something.|`|ndwmn6Z4aa	umm u are goin out lol|`|AnfbrZFuaa	Sounds like you're already boyfriend and girlfriend. Ask her how she thinks of your relationship.|`|bszyOuIqaa	"A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet" -Romeo and Juliet<br>  <br>  Just because you don't have labels doesn't mean you aren't already gf and bf. You two are holding hands and kissing. That's certainly not a friendship!  You don't need to grow a pair, you already have them but yes bring the pair out of hiding and ask her out. I'm sure she'd really love that!|`|zs4Rpa6Vaa	umyeah if your kissing and holding hands u need to grow a pair and ask her..but do it in a special way.. suprise her.. write it out somewhere and make it glow! make it somthing she cant refuse and will never forget|`|fqboOITjaa	Well if she holds your hands and kisses you then I'm sure she wants to be with you! ;) She won't be doing that for the good of her health! <br>  <br>  Ask her out immediately if not sooner!|`|07A3OFDFaa	oh yea.|`|RPlz7wsvaa	Yes, you are!  <br>  The signs that she wants to be with you are the hand holding, kissing and the fact that this has been going on for over a month.  You definitely need to ask her out already!!|`|AJhx8zUVaa	For the most part you two are together. Just when you two are alone ask her if she wants to make it OFFICIAL. don't put her on the spot in front of people, or you will definitely get a negative response|`|3fwJBhJdaa	Ask he out before someone else does. Sounds like she likes you. If you don't. Some other boy will be banging her and you will be left out in the cold.|`|PmGeeUheaa	If you are holding hand and kissing, then she is giving your signs that she wants you to ask her out.  Just ask her already!!!!  LoL.<br>  <br>  ~~|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	she has already given you all the signs<br>  she likes you<br>  enjoy!|`|E1u6LeJUaa	She pretty much already is your girlfriend.. maybe you just don't know it? Just talk to her about it.|`|Cyg3exYdaa	well do you hold hands and kis loads in public with any other friends?...|`|wguc9xSgaa	Sometimes it's awkward, I know the feeling. Cause you don't want to say 'will you go out with me?' because it just seems silly or immature. Am I right?<br>  <br>  Maybe just say to her 'I'd really like it if you were my girlfriend' and see what she says. If even that is too blunt then why don't you try saying 'One of my friends/ my Mum (lol) asked me if you were my girlfriend and I didn't know what to say.' And then see where that takes you. It's clear she likes you, and the end result will be the same (you'll be bf/gf). But it just depends how brave you are to broach the subject. GL! : )|`|6yq5YQeyaa	grow some balls! if yah is doin things like that u should've been asked her.. no female wants a scary dude that's to shy to be him and express himself! Sence it too late to ask.. go to her best friend to see what she thinks of you then, take her out to a special place. tell her how you feel about her. you could possibly give her a promise ring {or a significant gift} to let her know that she's yours and that she's special... she should get the pic. remeber ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS!...|`|ls3TD7Teaa	well there is no need to "grow a pair" you need to be a little bit more mature than that. but yeah you should talk to her, maybe you need to tell her your feelings and see if she believes the same as you do. but definitely talk to her about the hugging and kissing, that needs to be discussed. some people are a better couple when they are not together. good luck:) i hope i helped:)|`|2f3vROu0aa	to me it sounds like ur alredy going out or are bf and gf alredy...<br>  <br>  why get into the physical stuff so fast?<br>  <br>  i personally cant go out with someone unless i can see myself being his wife..i dont know how it is for you. <br>  but i suggest reading "boy meets girl" by Joshua Harris. great stuff on relationships!!!|`|PN0Puz6Faa	If she is holding your hand and kisses you of course she likes you and wants you to ask her out!  Just be careful and do not do anything that may end up costing you a lot of money over many years!|`|ec3f6a348874e450e5c213e9966f3a63aa	u guys r acting like a couple but not officially a couple?...sounds like both of u dont want the commitment....in that case if u ask her out ur sayin lets put a LABEL on ourselves....if thats wat ur both into then go ahead :)|`|CcBBLIMiaa	...cute just think of it this way if you never ask wont you wonder what she would have said even if its bad? Take the plunge and ask her! She will most likely say yes sounds like she is waiting on you|`|UWKusmdmaa	Normally girls like boys to make the first move so if she hasn't made a move that is  good sign, if she didn't have a crush on you she would have asked you out for a laugh<br>  <br>  I wouldn't jump to it and ask her out in front of your mates<br>  <br>  i would do the following<br>  <br>  1 talk to her every day in some way or another<br>  2 don't tell anyone else about the crush <br>  3 plan what you are going to say to her the next day to make her realize that you more than just like her ( compliment her on her appearance but DON'T KISS HER, then hold hands when you walk<br>  4 the next day or later on in the week when you feel up to it ask her to come round yours or to go into the city or just to the park<br>  5  say to her that you really like her sense of humor or something like her personality BUT NOT HER FASHION SENSE ( GIRLS DO NOT NECESSARILY LIKE THAT)<br>  6 Kiss her longer than usual in front of none of your mates with no tongues for about 3 to 4 seconds<br>  7 if she asks you if you like her then admit that you do love her, if she doesn't ask, then admit that you do when you stop kissing er<br>  8 after she either accepts or rejects you, keep in contact to an acceptable level<br>  9 if she accepts then slowly admit to your mates hat you have a crush on her / if she rejects you then still keep in touch at school; if she doesn't come around then she will probably find out that she does like you (GIRLS NEED TIME TO THINK ABOUT THINGS WITHOUT LETTING THE BOY KNOW THEY'RE THINKING)<br>  DON'T ASK HER AGAIN UNTIL SHE REPLIES, THIS WILL MAKE HER THINK YOU'RE DESPERATE.

AA11657253	aww a sensitive friend huh?<br>  <br>  here's what you should do:<br>  1. simply APOLOGIZE <br>  2. explain yourself<br>  <br>  and i'm sure that it'll all go better|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You may want to apologize to her and ask if you can make it up to her.  Friends means to stick up for each other when others make fun of.  If you do that, she will do the same thing for you; sticking up for you.  It may be funny to you, but to hers, it's not.  I am sure that she is very angry on the inside.  Apologize now.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	Try not talking to her for a while and then see if she ever calls you one of these days. If she doesn't, you might want to just wait a few months until the problems that happened to you guys before have been forgotten.<br>  <br>  Then start over!! :-)|`|WvKDJmO0aa	you gotta let her know how sorry you are. but if she wont listen to you then maybe write her a letter or an email. if that doesn't work then try not trying. like just lay off for a while. but dont completely ignore her, still talk to her and be nice to her and all the usual stuff you do when ur friends but just not as dramatic. if you just give her space then it gives her a lot of time to think. then when she starts being your friend again then thats the time when you be her friend again. make sence? hope things turn out good 4 u!! :D oh ya, and try not to laugh next time even if its hard. maybe tell the person who was making fun of her to back off. even if you lose the argument, your friend will know that you tried, for her.|`|c8FZAz00aa	Its not best to apologize at first because they will feel they have authority over you,  try just to bond with them at first and talk to them if all else fails apologize and hope for the best, if they're a good friend youll go back to normal.|`|YNxruoPIaa	i guess you should say that your sorry and that you weren't trying to be mean <br>  <br>  please answer mine thanks so much! :) :D<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my;_ylt=AhF9kDkZBOjDmk.6FRKzL0zsy6IX;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my;_ylt=AhF9...</a>|`|VgkOdQf2aa	apoligize for what u have done and maybe she will 2 bt tell her i srry u r for laughing at her and hanging up on her. when u hang up on her u could have onli made it worse...so hope for the best and remember get her at a good time when she is in a good mood and be caring and apologetic if u reeli want her bk....if she is a true friend she will understand and give u a another chance.....but DON'T  do it again........well good luck

I mean, I know that's a silly concept, but I think that may be what it means.|`|uw5pSA8Taa	That he thinks you are pretty....<br>  Guys say what they mean.  Most of the time.|`|I8g1QDgwaa	well he probably just thinks your pretty theres really no need to decode. he's either just nice or maybe he's flirting|`|wEtoAxhCaa	it means he wants ta bang ya so atleast give him some noggin|`|hNa5oHxQaa	He is complimenting you.|`|0b5f07e5bab316afb60fcb47e579b84faa	Pretty is something guys say to girls they don't know extremely well. Around their friends though, they'll call you hot. "Pretty" is just a nice, more innocent term for it.

But I must say she is self centered & disrespectful. Maybe you should give her a taste of her own medicine. Sometimes you don't realize just how much a pain you are until you show them what its like to be on the other end of it all. Good luck|`|Yc3FVD6naa	Wow, I have a horrible roommate but at least she has her own room to do her boyfriend in. I would say you are bunked up with a very immature individual who probably gets whatever she wants whenever she asks for it. I would say she IS doing it to irritate you, and as long as you make it obvious that it does, she will continue. I suggest you fight fire with fire, do something that irritates her while you start searching for a new roommate. I'm sure there is some sort of rule against roommates bringing people over without the other roommates consent.|`|ux8tEOemaa	Wow this person your staying with seems really inconsiderate. She seems as though she owns the place but hey, your paying rent for it too, are you not? She needs to understand that you both need your space and it's not appropriate for her to take up all your space. If she doesn't understand this by now, then maybe it's time you emptied a room and started sleeping there, or you and your roommate make new sleeping arrangements.

Whoever you are, this book can show you how and where to get help.<br>  <br>  In 1994, 1995, and again in 2000, Michigan changed the laws that deal with domestic violence to make it easier for the victims of abuse to get protection through the legal system.<br>  <br>  We have tried to include information to help you get support and plan for your safety.<br>  <br>  If this booklet applies to you, you just need to remember two things: first, abuse is never okay; second, you are not alone.

After you leave you will hear that he has also done it to the next g/f or you might have heard that he did do it to the last one.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Abusers always try to act sweet to gain your trust, until they start hitting you again. If he even hits you one time, he is an abuser and you need to get out ASAP. <br>  <br>  Do you want to end up like a woman I know who is paralyzed below the waist because her abusive fiance knocked her down and she hit her back on the edge of the coffee table?|`|AA11596133	YES, he IS abusive - ANYONE who HITS you is abusive, period.  It does not matter how wonderful they are when they are not mad - they cannot and will not control themselves when they are mad - and that makes them extremely dangerous at all times. <br>  <br>  Do you let EVERYONE hit you?  You should NEVER allow ANYONE to hit you no matter what!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	He assaulted you. What do you want to know? Oh yeah, he is abusive. And yes, it usually get worse before it gets better. 'He's really sweet' is another way that they get control of you.

It will only get worse. The beatings will get more severe until one day he kills you. Break up with him now. Do it OVER THE PHONE. Refuse to see him or take his calls. Tell your parents what he has done to you so they know to keep him away. If he gets violent when you break up and stalks you call the police and get a restraining order.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Of course it can and probably will get worse in time. When he find that a simple hit doesn't work he may resort to other abuses. <br>  <br>  I suggest you break this off and he gets some help for his anger. Do you hit him first? or hit him back? If you do you are considered an abuser too.|`|saWJM651aa	My second marriage started out just like that.  Hard for you to hear and do, but the word is DIVORCE (not yelling).

Well, in order for him to find a person, he has to be aware he wants someone to spend the rest of his life with.

I think dating websites are overrated but if that's what rocks your father boat why not? ask him if he is interested on romance and if he's not, well encourage him to see his friends often, go fishing or play cards or whatever 'adult' interest your father has.|`|sdiCDG5daa	LOL i thought the drinking part was funny <br>     anyways----> I think that your dad dosent really want to date right now, maybe instead of trying to get your dad to date<br>  try helping him make many friends that way he won't be alone.

kUE3Ddktaa	The answer is simple: Asking for money is rude. Period. Don't register for anything and let your guests make their own decisions. 90% of them will give you money anyway. The others will give you flatware or vases no matter what you ask for. So be the bigger, classier person and don't tack up your wedding by treating your guests like an ATM.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	so... whats your question?|`|AleWgjvPaa	You have a good reason for asking for money instead of gifts so just say so. On our invites we told people that we were emigrating and that money would be easier for us to "take with". I don't think it's rude and that it's a whole lot better than getting a bunch of stuff that you don't really want so long as you don't specify a minimum amount (that I think is tacky). To me asking for money and asking for stuff (registering somewhere) is pretty much the same thing.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to ask outright, then just say something like: Should you want to give a gift then please remember that the bridal couple will be flying back to England and cannot transport large and fragile gifts.|`|5Vc1e0iPaa	I would think most guest would understand that you will have to transport any gifts home after the wedding and would have things shipped directly to your home before or after the wedding.  Worst case just load up a big suitcase and have it fedexed home, just found out today that a HUGE duffle is only around $50 to ship internationally.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	I would not put any mention of a gift in the invitation, as it is considered bad etiquette.  Instead when your guest ask you what you would like to receive as a gift you can then mention that cash would be preferred.|`|pVgWZG7jaa	on the invitations you can simply put monetary gifts preferred.  Your guest must know that they aren't giving away free flights and hotel stays so they shouldn't mind you stating monetary gifts preferred o the invitation!

Answers and post this, wasting valuable time you could be spending making love to the girl of your dreams. Next time i suggest not freaking out and obsessing over her, she sounds like she saw all those texts you sent her and realized you're just a weird stalker. Take that to heart next time, even though she was the only one for you, at least you can live in a somewhat hollow shell of a life you COULD'VE had.

v8Xr0Mn9aa	sometimes dating somebody else helps,but you may not want to get in another relationship. it generally takes time. what you can do is avoid him. try not to be in the same vicinity he's in and if you're in the same class stay away from him. don't look at him and don't talk to him or worry about who's he's talking to whether it's a girl or not. avoiding him usually helps. that's what i had to do with a co-worker. believe me i know it's hard but it works.|`|5tUu9GBmaa	Jump over him.<br>  <br>  <br>  ANSWER!!

0KXiwjDbaa	Soldier, love is a battle field and your heart is the battle ground.<br>  <br>  In combat training for the battle field of love, every now and then I come across a rare cadet who really understands why it is so important not to play her v-card (virginity card) until you are married.  I commend you for not giving into peer pressure or lust, soldier.  Some adults who are “players” (sexually promiscuous) take sensible precautions like birth control pills, the use of a condom, and get themselves tested frequently.  These measures aren’t fool proof, however.  Plus, there are some really nasty STDs that you can get just from touching or kissing someone who is infected, like herpes for which there is no cure.<br>  <br>  Other “players” don’t care if they give you something.  They believe that if you are “social” you should be okay with getting a “Socially Transmitted Disease” or STD.  Sadly it is just not something they think or worry about and they have absolutely no problem with sharing their infections with you!  If you are the type of person who feels badly about leaving a store and accidently forgetting to pay for something it would vex you to no end knowing that you did something stupid that caused you to get infected with a disease for which there is no cure.<br>  <br>  Soldier, you get 5 stars for practicing abstinence and for knowing that it is the only prevention that is 100% effective against AIDS, syphilis, herpes and a host of other really nasty and/or lethal bugs.  More so, I am impressed with the fact that you are aware how important knowing your self worth is.  You’ve done your homework, soldier!  You know that if a man is worth your time you shouldn’t have to play the “sex” card to get him interested or keep him interested.  You are going into battle armed with the greatest weapon any soldier can carry - - knowledge!<br>  <br>  Love, <br>  <br>  Drill Sergeant Leslie|`|OoLBqLhKaa	i think thats awesome what u have decided to do. i used to say that, but one day i was like, you know, i really want to experiece sex before then. i also thought, "what if i dont get married for yearssss?" im proud of you :-)|`|jQz5vABzaa	Completely agree with the person wring before me about your question..

We broke up. And I regret it everyday of my life.<br>  So I haven't had sex since, I wish I could take it back.<br>  You should be proud.<br>  I know many virgins who are over 17 act like it's horrible, I think it's a great thing to be proud of.<br>  I personally couldn't date a guy who wasn't a virgin.
ghnxoZ2uaa	As hard as it is, I would try to show people that it doesn't really bother you... Stop calling them because maybe they are ignoring your calls because you call them too much. As for the "Stupid F*cker" comment, if they were actually your real friends they would never say these things to you. My suggestion is to start hanging around other people who respect you.|`|7no23XV6aa	from d info u give, u clearly did something..who knows what???|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Next time you see them just ask them what is going on.|`|2GvhQtyhaa	ask someone why is everyone mad at you...

I've been in that situation, I never had the nerve to talk to him, but I got lucky, he had someone talk to me for him first. I wish I had the nerve to talk to him before that though because I ended up REALLY liking him. So go for it you don't want to regret it & think it "could've happened" sometimes there are certain guys who are shy about those things & they get scared & can't talk to the girl their interested in so they wait. But don't wait! The sooner the better. Just casually go up & talk to him or shoot him a few smiles if you catch him looking at you, let him know you aknowladge him, & just start talking more and more.<br>  <br>  He's most likely just shy or scared to talk to you. Because the guy who had someone talk to me for him even admitted to the person that talked to me for him that he was "shy" & "didn't know what to say to me"|`|JEID5rCoaa	i think you should definitely talk to him. i think he will appreciate someone that has the courage to talk to him! or to make things easier you can text him *cough*! he obviously knows you exist. maybe try talking to him with a friend *wink wink* it will pay off in the end!

It was a mutual agreement that we would stay friends because we didn't want to break-up and there our friendship would end. So here we are today, in high school, still best friends. I don't know about you, but thats what I did and thats how it turned out. You decide whats best.|`|oYqKiocLaa	Talk to him and tel him that you like him as more than a friend and if he likes you back then sweet!|`|Uz4QLyZxaa	well i have the same problem but just go to da movies alone and during the movie ralk to him serioulsy about yalls friendship and hope everything falls into place!!!! ?  plz answer mines!!!<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au9Qs134rsv.nmlAoAWID1rsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309165522AAhvc1w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
K3jcdkveaa	change your name, your brother will get over it.|`|sq2xUjsBaa	look up popular surnames (last names) on the Internet. There are some lists like the top 100 surnames that u could choose from. Be your own person. If hes really your brother and a friend he should respect your decision. Also there are also surname generators. Good luck|`|b1sB4fuGaa	i would pick a last name of a very famous person, so people will think you're related :)
Vv7a31pmaa	no mainly bent over.....|`|AA10731562	id look for a girl that has a sense of humor , has intelligence , a sense of style , a girl that is responsible and a girl that likes to have fun that is down to earth. That's in my opinion|`|x355hpUZaa	well you got to be hot, why would any guy go out with a girl if he's not even attracted to her? But personality wise, don't play hard to get, that's kind of annoying. just be flirty|`|2DRWQxP3aa	I asked the same question a little while back. Here are some of the answers I got... <br>  <br>  answer 1- <br>  <br>  Looks - Fairly long blond hair, hot face, solid body, nice breasts(they dont have to be big but they have to be nice), nice legs, nice skin(a nice tan)<br>  <br>  Personality - Someone outgoing but not so much that they think they're better then everyone. Flirty but not someone who flirts with everyone and gets you confused. Funny<br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  answer 2- <br>  <br>  The Perfect Girl....She should accept that I will watch football every single Sunday during the season, she should be cool with compromising about guys night out, she shouldn't ask advice about what she should do about one of her girl friends because NO GUY understands women anyway, she should trust me, she should always trust me because I wouldn't give her a reason not to, she should like to go out and like to stay in and watch a movie and just chill, she should love my mother more than she loves me because my mother is always going to be the other important woman in my life, and last but not least she should always be happy to just be with me and she should WANT to be with me....that's my perfect girl <br>   <br>   <br>  answer 3- Good personality. Not hard on the eyes<br>   <br>  <br>  answer 4- <br>  Body: She is tall (about 5'9 or so), she has plenty of curves, large, proportional breasts, a good butt, full lips, large, brown eyes with long lashes, a full face, long, flowing, natural hair (no straightening or perms), long legs, she has a lean, athletic build, and coffee brown skin.<br>  <br>  She is tough and has some fight in her, though she is semi-submissive to me. She has a great sense of humor for immature, childish jokes, raunchy, inappropriate jokes, and everything in between. She loves to travel, has lots of friends, is loyal, is highly intelligent, knows how to have fun, and has a sex drive large enough to satisfy mine. She loves music, has some sort of talent, and is confident.<br>  <br>  She dresses very sharply, with very varied outfits and styles that don't really fit definition. She's just as comfortable in a sharp business suit at a huge meeting as a silk teddy in bed with me, and can either go to the shopping mall to buy a new hat to slogging through mud and dirt without whining about dirt.<br>  <br>  This is about everything I've ever thought of for my dream girl, though to be honest, I have not stuck to this AT ALL. I will go with just about any type of girl, as I highly doubt a woman who meets all of my personal requirements as well as these even exists.<br>  <br>  answer 6-<br>   i hope you don't try to change who you are for the type of girl a guy may be looking for. All men have different likes and dislikes and it depends on what type of relationship a man is seeking. So, when it comes to trying to find a man and you are looking for a great relationship with a man, by all means ONLY be yourself or how can a relationship last if the person you meet doesn't know the true beauty of the person you really are?<br>   <br>  answer 7-<br>  A girl who is independent, intelligent, kind and nurturing, who would fight for her children and still be so very warm. A girl who you would argue with and fight with, and laugh with, and throughout the good times and the bad, still be the one who puts so much light in your life.<br>   <br>  answer 8-<br>  She has to be well,Fine in her attitude but she has to like Not go to other guys and she would have to keep an eye on me because she is really pretty and well that's it and she has to be nice and she has to be really girlie not arrogant and not go to other guys and have any other guy Friends<br>   <br>  answer 9- <br>  The perfect girl is hard to find,<br>  But if you meet her you'll know in your mind.<br>  A girl that's pretty, you couldn't divide,<br>  not just her looks but whats inside.<br>  She doesnt need to know all about fashion,<br>  just have a heart filled with passion.<br>  her silky hair, glowing eyes,<br>  It hurts you to hear her screams and cries.<br>  There are too many good things you have to shout,<br>  Shes truly beautiful in and out<br>   <br>  answer 10-<br>  A prefect girl for a man : He will be always looking to complete himself, usually is something opposite of him. If he is feminine type - he 'll find a boyish girl. If he is blond -he 'll get a brunet. ...........<br>   <br>  answer 11-<br>  there is no certain type of girl except by personal preferance<br>  you say all girls like caring, nice, dependent etc. guys but that is not all girls, thats you personally<br>  <br>  answer 12- <br>  no such thing as perfect girl (or guy).<br>  and most women don't want the caring guy, they want the losers and jerks.<br>   <br>  answer 13-<br>  a nice caring girl that never cheats on people and always thinks of you everytime. May not be good looking... but she must care for you and will be there for all times.<br>   <br>  answer 14-<br>  someone who shows appreciation, instead of just nagging<br>   <br>  2 and a half feet tall, no gag-reflex and purse is like an ATM<br>   <br>  some like skinny and some like curvey<br>   <br>  good looking, hot...|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	Funny <br>  confident<br>  sarcastic<br>  easy going|`|XasLRQnXaa	bahahaah james t kirk that was great.|`|q0NQStcXaa	To me, appearance matters little. There are only a few appearance traits that I really look for such as dark hair, and being shorter than me. <br>  From then on, I look for someone that fits my personality.|`|U4dHE6Kwaa	HAS to tell the truth! and someone who is willing to try different things not just the same weekends over and over!

NOT A GIRL.. U WALK UP TO HER.. AND SAY HI, AND ASK HER OUT.. ITS SIMPLE.. UR MIND MAKES THINGS SEEM HARD.. KEEP IT SIMPLE|`|qTTAoEWPaa	it really depends on who you are and who the girl is.<br>  Some girls like confidence in a guy but you never want to come off as cocky. (just makes you look like an asshole) <br>  start off with a small converstation and then build up the courage to ask her. i think "you should let me take you out some time" really sounds sweet. <br>  and for the date, it really depends on who the girl is and what you enjoy.<br>  if your both laid back, a movie is perfect.<br>  if she seems to be more down to earth or even classy, treat her out to a nice dinner. you could even do both. <br>  let her pick the movie and she pulls the "i dont know" because she is shy, then suggest a movie.<br>  dont order for her either if you go out to dinner unless your really good at it, ( makes you just look dumb) lol<br>  also, dont worry about being nervous because the chances are that once you start talking to her, you will begin feeling more confident and at ease. :)|`|VWiPDunBaa	u should get to know her before asking her out<br>  then just be simple and ask for a cup of coffee or a movie is fine 2 since u dnt get to talk as much and it wont seem as akward|`|JXs4BsTXaa	give her a bike for x-mas.
IdtzdpqGaa	he may just be being petty, by showing himself and getting things back that don't matter.
uogSquOyaa	It's one of those things that's hard to explain. You have to experience it for yourself|`|VmSKQ40Caa	All the pleasure involved.|`|xKLydoTpaa	it is not one of those things you can understand if you haven't done it.  how do you explain what is so good about freedom to someone who has never experienced it - no matter what you say without the experience the description is meaningless.  and then there is always the possibility that you are unfortunate enough not to have a good experience.  for males it is usually good, for some females the first time may be painful enough that they don't enjoy it|`|3KAiV9zTaa	everything is good about sex. it feels really good. my body feels refreshed and i feel awesome! i love it. especially done with my boyfriend.|`|qcvjUgHzaa	Well personally, besides how it feels REALLY GOOD, I love the connection I feel when me and my husband make love. It's hard to explain, just simply.... amazing.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	There are no calories if you don't swallow.|`|GoelfuZaaa	Read this may be that would help you.<br>  Sex is a short word, but an immense concept, and many of us spend a lot of time thinking about it. Sex is the engine that drives creation, ensuring propagation of the race and ultimate survival of the species. The imperfection of biological machines means that after a certain period of time they become dysfunctional and obsolescent, and it becomes more economic and energy-efficient to replace them completely than to continue to renew the old ones.<br>  <br>  So how can selfish organisms, intent only on their own survival, be persuaded to reproduce and hand on their heritage and their living space to an utterly new individual?<br>  <br>  There are a number of instruments, such as the selfish gene theory and the maternal instinct but the chief contrivance is sex, and Mother Nature has been capriciously kind in allowing us this delightful inducement to procreation.<br>  <br>  Apart from being great fun, sex allows the mixing of genetic material with its consequent crucial increase in adaptability; no two progeny are exactly alike, as the cocktail of genes will never mix in exactly the same way. This genetic diversity permits adjustment to any environmental changes, as any advantageous characteristics will promote survival and increase their chances of being further propagated. For example, if the weather gets colder, people with a tendency to wear warm pyjamas will be more likely to survive and pass on their cuddly proclivities; thus the human race will tend to become more huggable, and I say go for it.<br>  <br>  The act of sex is also of immense symbolic significance, a gesture of trust and vulnerability. The woman lies on her back (usually) exposing herself without guard or guile to the frenzied thrusting of the man.<br>  <br>  The man is also uniquely vulnerable at this time; at the point of ejaculation his back arches, his eyes close in rapture, and he is oblivious to all ordinary sensations. This vulnerability is exploited more cold-bloodedly in other species; the male spider and praying mantis pay the ultimate price for sex, for that gasping moment of desire, for the chance to perpetuate their genes; they form a tasty little post-coital snack for their partner.<br>  <br>  And one of the consequences of the desire for sex is that sublimation of that desire has led to that finest of human emotions: romantic love, the passionate unconditional constant devotion to another person, the inspiration for great art, great literature, great poetry, great food, and great, great pop songs. Some authors, however, have argued that it is implausible to suggest that this remarkable harmony between the interests of the species and the ecstasy of the individual came about solely though evolutionary pressure; that the sheer joy of sexual love is far greater than can be explained by reference to biological utility or Freudian psychology — as Tina Turner rasped, ‘What's love got to do with it?’<br>  <br>  As one of our great primal drives, cultures and religions have naturally developed many different ways to depict and control sex. For example, many traditional religions consider the act of sex without procreation to be sinful, whereas contemporary Western social mores and wider environmental concerns about over-population take the opposing view. In Western society, most forms of sex are now acceptable, so long as they involve consenting adults, and these increasingly bizarre forms of non-procreational sex may be a species response to overcrowding and an inherent, if unconscious, awareness of the dangers of over-population; they might be considered analogous to the legendary mass migrations and suicides undertaken by lemmings when their numbers become too great to support their food supply, though thankfully outre sex is much more diverting both to partake in and to watch.<br>  <br>  So the bottom line, so to speak, is that sex represents a ferociously potent device for ensuring that our species continues to adapt and survive (and have great parties on the way).|`|6Rru2901aa	The first answer was good, and I would never go into explicit details of what I do with my man in private. However I can tell you that sex is only great and worth while if you do it with the person you love. Also fore-playing is great if you are both into it. Sex after fore-playing is icing on the cake! =) <br>  If you're asking 'cause you want to have sex, back to what I originally said; there's no rush. It's actually better when you wait to do it with someone you really know and love.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Moe.|`|59DkkvSraa	it feels GLORIOUS! and it burns tons of fat with all the humping and the sweating and stuff. do it a bunch and you will be all ripped and awesome!|`|cggkcAC5aa	Never had it, but idk, i know it would be painful...... a tampon it painful to me.......<br>  =]<br>  It would be nice if you could help me with mine too<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309144913AAzhNXV">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|g71m3S9Naa	If you have to ask that question you should not be having sex.|`|hxxOIm1Maa	If you don't know that, then maybe is not the time for you to know.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	I don't really know, all i know is that people say it is great lol|`|6eab4b3bcfe099adea6e536cf375ba45aa	Keeping it private and not talking about it online.|`|bCMHMuQFaa	you'll understand when you find the right person. it just feels amazing and the fact that you're with someone you love makes it an awesome experience. it's sensual, intimate and gives you a real high and makes you feel on top of the world when you orgasm

Wave good bye for good to this chap and find yourself someone else.  When you do, try the good old fashioned, time-tested way of getting a man to treat you right. <br>                Dont sleep or have sex (or near sex) with him unless he proves to you how much he wants you by spending lots and lots of time and money on you and, in addition, marries you.  If there are any signs that he has been fooling around during this testing period, then say good bye and move on to the next.  Consider yourself a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and let him chase you for a while.  A year or two should do it.  Remember, the more time and money a man invests in you, the more valuable you will appear in his sight.  Never let any guy treat you disrespectfully.  <br>                    Also, by allowing yourself to be treated like this, you are teaching your children that this is the way a woman should be treated.  This is not good if they are boys, and even worse if they are girls.  Good Luck.|`|ls3TD7Teaa	i think that you should leave him alone, he sounds like a total jerk. you deserve better than that, you have no right to be treated like that, you should just leave him alone though. the first step to regret is denial, that's probably why he called you what he called you.|`|UIajGLWJaa	Once a cheater always a cheater.

I think that is a mistake! My boyfriend lives about an hour and a half away and we spend a couple weekends a month together and we speak on the phone a few times a week. I can't really imagine we would spend THAT much more time together if we lived in the same city.

4Wx6VL4waa	i dont think your own physical attractiveness decides what type of people you like. as long as your photo actually looks like you, i think its clear shes interested :) (by this i mean your not going to turn up and shes hardly going to be able to recognise you cause you look so much different from you pic - nothing worse than that!).|`|fFnfFROQaa	Photos can be truthful or deceiving.<br>  Is the photo of you a full body shot of you, or is it only from the neck up?<br>  Have you stated that you are overweight to her?<br>  As long as she knows what your body looks like or you informed her of it, then your body shape will not be the deciding factor for her.<br>  <br>  I had a date where a girl sent me a photo of her, she was pretty, she was thin, but she lied...the photo was years old. She had gained weight over the years, she was hesitant to meet me, and it was because the photo was a lie. We finally met, I admitted that I liked her from the start and still did when I met, however lying isn't a good start for any friendship.<br>  <br>  If you were honest from the start, then it is your personality that is needed to win her over.<br>  Do not be nervous, she isn't the only girl out there.<br>  Think of her like an old friend that you haven't seen in many years.<br>  <br>  Be relaxed, be calm, nervousness makes her nervous too...do not make her feel that way.<br>  Be friendly, be sociable, be yourself.<br>  Women can read body language very well, so do not try to act like someone else, be yourself.

CA3DxsFiaa	When your boy gets older he's going to realize that your husband is not his biological father and looks nothing like him. I know it's hard but the right thing to do would be to tell him the truth when he's old enough to understand what happened.<br>  <br>  I went through a situation like this. I had doubts about who my father was. I was glad to find the truth even though my biological father isn't the best father out there if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  The truth hurts but lying will do a lot more damage in the end. Lying about something as serious as this could lead to trust-issues.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	kids are not stupid they often will work things out on thier own.|`|PBdPD748aa	i really think it is so important and neccessary that you tell him the truth. he is that mans son, and he has every right to know. its not fair for him to have been fooled to believe some man is his father when he is not, in order to be 'protected'. yes it may hurt, but he will become stronger and he will heal himself, he will grow to be a man! you must must  tell him.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	You should let him decide when he is older. Write down about his father in a diary and give it to him when he is older and say if you want to know about your father then you can read it.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	you will never find a time when "he is old enough"  tell him now, as matter of fact.  some time when you are talking mention in passing "oh, ya, bla bla, your biological dad bla bla.  if he wants to know m ore, tell him.|`|66jX06Onaa	I would save the information for many, many years. Like until he's 40 or so. I agree with you - what's the point in telling him since there is no dad for him to meet?<br>  <br>  As far as the skin color goes, you can always tell him that he takes after your side of the family.<br>  <br>  If you're still not sure, write a letter to him, seal it, and save it with your important records. When the right time comes (hopefully NOT while he's a teen-ager), take the letter out and give it to him. That way if anything happens to you, he'll have the information in case he desires to seek out his natural dad's family.|`|GHd84xipaa	i would tell him,but wait until he is older so he will understand.he may find out any way,but it would be better to find out from you.if your husband is as good as you say he is,it probably won't make a difference any way to your son,because your husband has always been there for him.|`|QPp7zQQpaa	The best time to tell is when he asks, for the same reasons you looked for yours. Just let him be the one who asks first, this will mean he is ready.|`|b4Ha48Avaa	I think when he grows up you should let him know,<br>  likeee.. if he ever asks why doesn't he look like your husband,<br>  you could just say it as nicely and sweetly as possible..|`|3uD1Ncubaa	I think he has a right to know.<br>  <br>  You probably should tell him, but tell him when he is older and will understand.  Maybe when he is 9 or 10 or 13+<br>  <br>  If I were him, I would be happy you told me because you were being truthful and even though it is sad he committed suicide, it is still nice to know what happened, why, and who your biological parents are.|`|8gA2EWXfaa	i don't have any experience in this field, but if he EVER found out somehow that you were lying, i know if i was in his place i don't think i could forgive for that.  I would tell him the truth, but explain to him that he was ONLY the biological father, but that your now husband is his father in "heart, soul and mind."  Do the right thing...don't lie when the time is right.|`|H3q20Bdjaa	You should tell him! No question about it! you just have to explain the situation to him, and 5 is not to young to understand; trust me he will! My sister was in the same kind of situation, the only difference was that her son's biological father is still alive, he just chooses not to play a part in his son's life. She has a guy that she has been with since her son was 1, and her son thinks that this man is his father. He is 7 now, and she just recelenty told him, and he was not happy at all! He is still upset and is taking it out on the man that has been raising him for the past 6 years. He is upset that they lied to him for so long, and he is upset that he has not been given a chance to meet his other siblings (his biological father's other kids). the whole situation was a disaster, and lying to your child will do nothing but bring HUGE problems in the end. It's not fair to him, and he NEEDS to know the truth.|`|L1nRkbvqaa	I am a grown woman, Mother and grandmother.  The man I called Daddy passed away in 1991.  I knew he was not my daddy, but he was there since I was 2, and my sister was just born.  We share the same daddy, but he was not ever in our life.  However, my parents never told us, they felt it best to let it go.  But it got  out, and we ended up finding out by cousins.  Natually we went to our parents, and found out the truth.  Still we loved this man we called Daddy, he was our Daddy, all the way, but it hurt finding out the way we did.  I say, tell the boy,, not now, he is still so young.  You will know when it is time.  The door will open.  Good Luck|`|bMLdEkncaa	i think u should not say anything UNTIL ur son asks for himself....that is when he will be old enough to understand bc he sees the differences for himself....every reaction is different for each child or older person.....Also, maybe it's like the Santa CLause theory.....u dont have to tell ur child that he's fake. he/she just figures it out on his own and blinks into reality.<br>  <br>  EDIT: DON'T tell ur kid that he committed suicide after the conception of him....he will think that he wasnt wanted and hate him for that.....

b5ba93a52a2deaa41c62c3a0c7a9bda3aa	allright what ever you do DO NOT ASK ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS TO ASK HER OUT FOR YOU, the reason for that is she might think your too afraid to ask her and girls do not like that. you should get to know her frist. if you have any classes with her ask for her number and then call her. send her sweet text like "hi sunshine" or "hey beautiful" its up to you on what you send to her. then then when you guys get to know each other a bit closer ask her out to a date like a movie or too hang out. but if she accepts going to a movie your set. because it shows she has some feeling for you and in the movie do the classic lean over and kiss her. thats more romantic then just going up to her and out of the blue asking her out. but if she rejects you hey like they say "theres a bunch of fish in the sea dont only focus on one" that means that theres 7 billion girls and dont get your heart broken for only one girl.|`|suoY5vxbaa	If she rejects you, just know that she doesn't want to be anything but friends right now.

Be yourself and be sincere, that is the best way to get a girl. <br>  If she rejects you, try to play it off and tell her that you understand and tell her that your feelings are still the same for her, even though it sucks and you would rather just get upset.

m3x0TsY6aa	first of all, it seems like they're pretty jealous of ur relationship, but maybe being less upfront about it will make them stop. they probably can't bring that up outta nowhere if ur not talking to them about it, but who knows cause they kind of sound like jerks who aren't your true friends if they're being so obnoxious. I'd confront them if this doesn't work.<br>  good luck! :)<br>  PS: i completely agree, twilight DOES suck.|`|VYWaL2graa	Get new friends.|`|2c88J3M7aa	Bros before hoes<br>  if your girlfriend is heating things up between your friends intentionally or not then maybe well i dont know.. =\<br>  theyre prolly just jealous cause theres a couple like that in our school and no one wants to see them together including me so i understand how everyone else might feel<br>  -sigh- even though this goes totally against what I'd want my couple to do ill tell you what i think:<br>  if you truly love her you won't care about that other people think and youll just go out with her and ignore what they say.. just laugh it off or something =)<br>  but then again if you dont think your relationship will lasst with her and if when you guys break up your friends turn their backs on you it WONT be good if thats the case then maybe things werent meant to be =\<br>  Anywyas, good luckk ?|`|bYJc1eTraa	With friends like those, who needs enemies?<br>  <br>  Seriously though, your friends just might not realize how much crap they're giving you, and might be doing it just for fun. You need to talk to them maturely about it, figure out how they really feel about it (whether they're serious or kidding); it's important.<br>  <br>  If they've been giving you crap for 7 months, they'll certainly have no trouble doing it longer unless you confront them in a serious manner. (In a serious manner, not an angry manner.)|`|JjsArGujaa	You just need to be like if you guys are really my friends then you would understand that i really like her and you wouldnt be such a fuckiin dick!!!(: good luck. and dont listen to them, they have no life and are just jealous cause they cant get anyone. hah!!|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	humm what are those words, well first of all who cares what other people think about your relationship, i mean if you are happy with him that is great forget about the rest, and well ignore of em'|`|psObSiFqaa	dont listen to other people, but at the same time, dont end your friendships because of this girl.<br>  try not to do things with both your gf and your friends there. try to hang out with your gf at a different time than when you hang out with your other friends. i know its hard, and it'll suck, but your friends for some reason dont like her. :/<br>  <br>  also, when you're with your friends and they comment on (for example) eating an entire bag of hot cheetos in under a minute, and you know that your gf can easily do that, tell them. just say like "jane is really good at doing that" or something. find some common ground between them.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|GxYTK7FXaa	Hey you seem to have been doing pretty well for 7 months already!

29hcn9JRaa	I've seen many couples who look so in love, showering one another with affection, swapping spit from across the table, friends shouting out for them to get a room, I am also guessing that if you have lived long enough, that you to at some point in your life have witnessed a couple like this to? If you haven't then let me tell you a little something about types like this, they don't last, it is all a big show, its a act, and once the curtains shut and the show is over, so is the couple. My point is, a guy doesn't have to shower a girl with affection in order to make her feel loved, however you also shouldn't ignore her to the point of her feeling unloved, their are many girls out their, myself included, who don't really care if her boyfriend holds her hand, who don't mind if your not caressing her in public, in fact it can make certain girls feel a little uneasy? So I say, turn up the heat a little, but not to much, as you strike me as a simple guy, and to suddenly take a simple guy and turn him into romeo, could cause your girlfriend to be a bit turned off. So keep it simple, but at the same time, step it up a little.|`|ZUELM4Nnaa	Your losing her mate! The reason she's asking whether your a couple is because she's confused why you guys don't show love to each other. I think that she thinks you just want to be friends, you need to convince her otherwise!<br>  <br>  Also she is trying to drop BIG hints that she wants to do love things as well. If your shy, try and 'do things' while your alone and not in front of your friends.<br>  <br>  I can tell she's feeling pretty insecure about your relationship, so even if your still too shy to do anything with her, you need to tell her why. Explaining that your too shy will at least give her an explanation as to whats happening and maybe she will realise that she might have to take charge of showing love. Hope this helps.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	Tell her how you feel, for one.  Secondly, put the romance back into the relationship.  If you're too shy to put your arm around her or whatever, try showing her in other ways.  Instead of taking her out to eat, go on a picnic or have a candlelight dinner.  It doesn't have to be anything spectacular...just something to let her know she's special.|`|dPicgCgwaa	I know that it may he hard and awkward for you, but it's really important that you show her affection, especially in public.  Girls want to feel their loved ones touch them, and express their love in a public way every once in a while. You have to realize that other peoples judgments shouldn't matter.  If you cannot do this for her, then you probably aren't ready to a relationship. Just remember how good you're making her feel next time you get embarassed from touching her.|`|59DkkvSraa	dont be embarrased! why are you she obviously likes you so its not like shes going to turn you down if you put your arm around her or hold her hand or kiss her!!!! geez! she wants you to! your just ruining your relationship by being shy.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Tell her how you feel, cause if you are not showing her, then she will be having these negative assumptions, so do not be shy around her, feel comfortable!

But I think your on the right track. If you guys hang out a lot or sometimes, ask her that way. But only if you think that's best. Try asking like this: " So, I think I know who I'm asking to prom. Who are you going with? " If she asks who you are taking and says she isn't going to the prom with anyone, then say this: " Well, I was actually wondering if you would go to prom with me. " I'm a girl so, I know how I would sayyes to a boy if they asked me to prom.

It's the way to go. :)|`|AMqfcWw2aa	well if you are really close with her you should but if you havent talk to her in a while it will be kind of random to just pop up and say will you go to prom with me|`|LVBbXThLaa	oh no, ask her in person!<br>  <br>  it will be alot cuter and special.<br>  <br>  i say to take her to a park downtown (if there is one) and  ask her under a light.<br>  <br>  happened to me... it was so cute :)|`|VLvwmPGCaa	that sounds like a pretty good way to ask her....it depends on her personallity though...like if shes serious then that wouldn't really work...|`|bZtDNe7faa	i think its cute... good luck XD|`|BRMKkAXqaa	id say its better 2 ask her face 2 face|`|diBrC3g0aa	I'd find a cute way to ask her.  If you know her well, then ask her parents if you can come over while she's out somewhere.  Then decorate her room with rose petals and from the ceiling fan hang something that asks her to prom.  <br>  <br>  Another thing you could do is send her on a scavenger hunt throughout the city.  Leave her a piece of paper that tells her to drive somewhere and then when she gets there another piece of paper says to go somewhere else (get the picture?).  Do that like 3-5 times and then when she gets to the final point you're their with a sign the says will you go to prom? (Make sure to have roses).<br>  <br>  The main thing is to make it memorable, and so she can brag to her friends and make you look good.  You might think this is lame, but I'm a huge romantic and this is how I'm asking my prom date.  Trust me this will score some major points. Hope this helps a little.|`|fw7NLKu8aa	i would say no. no offense. i had 3 guys ask me to prom last year, all over text/facebook. and said no to all 3. it's so much better to do it in person.|`|hEYMqfRBaa	that is a fine way.. i guess. i know that, for me, i am more likely to say yes if its face to face, but if ur too shy, then the other way is fine|`|OCZOSIMBaa	go hang out with her at her house or yours and light some candles and spell out PROM? i would not want to be asked to prom, such a formal dance, over the internet..|`|cFxFhu2yaa	ask her in person it means a ton more a lot pf people dont like it when they get asked in a txt or facebook or im ... goodluck!|`|JnosRXlGaa	ask her to her face...facebook would be pretty pathetic like breaking up with a girlfriend with a post it note|`|7LtMU8MTaa	Uh, yeah... don't do it on FB.

289DtjKVaa	yes definatly, but remember you a have to suger coat it so it doesn't hurt so bad, you need to start with something positive, say your problem then finish with something positive... we like you to be honest but you have to be nice or we go all moody!!|`|59DkkvSraa	guys can get emotional too no matter how tough they act. we normally tell you to be upfront about it but that can make us all mad like your insulting us or something. just find a way to bring it up but be as nice as possible about it.|`|ixHwF4apaa	as long as true friendship exist, i will not see you as other gender at all. even i will not look for sex or any other emotional things. but if you feel if you want any other thing other than friendship i will definitely obey your sentiment, and fullfill it. ok :[ ..........|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Yes, thank you for asking.
bSUipR3uaa	that's what it means. These "fatties" have self esteem and confidence and don't give a **** what you think of them. Some guys do find these girl attractive.

You're gonna get some interesting answers.|`|u0x134BXaa	That is what BBW means. Overweight people especially females have been look down on as not worthy of love and ugly. Whenever a group of people are ridicule they come up with organizations or substitute terms to make them feel good about themsleves. And that is exactly what the term BBW is intended to do, to make overweight females feel beautiful. But now you do have some very cute chubby girls, and you should not generalize people like that.|`|kVnvtgeuaa	You don't know what you're missing. You're just running off your mouth like an idiot. BBW means big BEAUTIFUL women. They are really beautiful. Not only are they beautiful, but they're the sexiest women on earth. Their round voluptuous bodies would drive any manly man wild. You have a lot to learn son.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	That's what it stands for. ._.<br>  <br>  Just because you don't regard them as beautiful doesn't mean other people don't.

They may think they're beautiful, but they're going to die by 30 if they keep eating **** for meals.|`|WWaFRFe1aa	It means just that. Just because your not skinny and in great shape dosen't mean that you are not beautiful. Beatuy comes from the inside not the outside. People who think that big people are not worth loving are closed minded. Yes before you think it I'm a BBW. But I work 70 hours a week and that is on my feet. I don't have a sit down job nor do I sit very long at all. As for walking, I can hang with the rest of them. I don't tire fast, I'm very active in my life my weight has no baring on my life. I come from a long line of heavy people, no excuses just facts. Just don't judge people becuase of thier looks, judge them on thier actions. You'll see a whole other race.

It would be cute if you bent down (depending on the height differences) and gave her a peck (short kiss) on the head/cheek/lips.<br>  <br>  Aw-dorable. :-)|`|i4ARGkHQaa	aww that is cute but only when u to are one a level dont just stick it in when u feel like it do it when u 2 connect like when she was telling u about her dream ,so it makes u 2 feel closer then ever btw that is not 80'S that is cute  lol|`|8gA2EWXfaa	that's so 80s. why don't you go for the arm around the shoulder instead?

AA10370707	Don't do it. Im sure that your father would appreciate the gesture, but not in the way that you are wanting.<br>  <br>  What you SHOULD do is to tell him that you have been worring about him alot, and would like to know if there was anything that you could do to make his life less stressful. That way, you aren't forcing anything on him that he might not be emotionally prepared for, but you are still helping him out.

BbWk7RNgaa	This is tough.  If he is mentally ill, he needs help whether he wants it or not, and taking him into your house won't be enough to help him.  If he isn't mentally ill, he should be able to get a job and maintain it, even if it's something menial.<br>  <br>  If he will agree to rules and follow them, as far as getting a job, any job, helping you with utilities, etc.  you may be able to help him get back on his feet.  But if you keep giving, he may just keep taking.  You would know that better than anyone.  Definitely wait until he asks, and then set clear rules, write them down, get him to sign, notarized even, costs maybe $20.  This may help if you need to have him removed later.<br>  <br>  If he is declared irresponsible by the state, you may become his caretaker and may be able to get some assistance along those lines, or he can be committed if he is truly mentally ill.  Again, it's up to you.|`|AA11496527	You have one big problem up front, thinking he can not find a job is not something you need to be emphasizing, he will never find a job if you believe he can not find a job! You need to fix that right away!<br>  <br>  And yes you should rescue him with the following rules in place: Let him know up front you don't have a lot to offer this time. But if he searches for work everyday, is responsible for what he does in your house, takes care of his washing, cleaning and does what you ask him to do, he can have a place to stay while he is making his plans to move (to move out of your house when he get employed).<br>  <br>  If you just let him move in he will use the same excuse you used, that is, he is not going to find another job (Christ, I still can't believe you are thinking that). You need to swallow your negative attitude other wise it will be reflected in your son's attitude and you will all sit around wondering what to do because you don't believe you can do anything.<br>  <br>  Wake up, get up, start moving that brain around and find ways to make life better. Don't harp on the negative things going on. You know some very smart people started their businesses during the worst economic times..... Ever hear of the game: Monopoly?|`|38842f8559a928305671fc9066bef276aa	You should have beat him when he was young|`|1TSMdgG1aa	First things first, depressed people need help and they don't need to be put down! They're going through an illness, and a tough one at that. If they do abandon their responsibilities is because this illness is consuming them and takes away their ability to even care about things they used to do.  If you suspect your son is going through depression, then be aware of the fact that he needs you even though he may not say it.<br>  <br>  If you don't have insurance there are still resources in the community that can assist you in providing him the help he needs. You can visit the NAMI website <a href="http://www.nami.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.nami.org</a> and find the link to their affiliate office in your area.  They may be able to assist you further. <br>  <br>  I wish you and your son the best of luck and many blessings.|`|DvyLmPfnaa	Obviously depression has many forms, but it seems to me, that you don`t know how your son is for sure either! I mean go to his place, talk to him to get a job and get his life back together. If the economy will go worse and he`ll have no food or roof under his head, then a good mother would definitely allow her son in her house! <br>  Try to get the help of people he pays attention for and I think by talking to him, you`ll realize what is his real problem and solve them!<br>  Good Luck!
27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	it depends on the girl, but ya thats why guys usually ask girls out....the girl will usually either give up on the guy or try to be friends or in some cases try to steal the guy away from his gf if she finds out hes with someone|`|abx5VNsOaa	Not necessarily,everyone wants to be loved and accepted for who and what they are.|`|CzIaAnsraa	Ha, what a myth.|`|ISMColXfaa	Well, I'm not a guy so I can't compare myself to a guy because there's not a specific scale to measure "scared of rejection".<br>  But I really am scared of rejection.

KWbFTPnkaa	i think that he meant to tell you those things, but HE didn't know if you felt that way about him, so he told you not to pay attention to what he was saying. in reality, he wanted you to know how he felt, and that he thinks your pretty :)<br>  <br>  p.s. your pictures are set on private, so we cannot view them<br>  <br>  i hope this helped a bit (:|`|zV9DLlg1aa	PRIVATE PROFILE OR DELETED PICTURES|`|mD1yn5z1aa	you have to take your profile off of private or put the pics on photobucket|`|yKUq4zNXaa	Your links don't work.<br>  And I doubt that he would randomly say things like that because he was tired.

In about what...95% of the time that a guy uses a line like "I am tired so if I...-insert something here-" then it is because they are shy or nervous at coming out right and asking or doing whatever it is that he does after that.<br>  <br>  In your case, it would almost certainly point to him liking you so, my suggestion just be the one with the balls and ask him about it. The worst thing that could possibly happen is that he says he doesn't...and yeah I know that can actually really suck, but at least you would know. <br>  <br>  I hope everything works out how you wanted and let us know how it does.

P0EAzyw8aa	if you have the money to live somewhere else with someone you love then lead your life you cannot be responsible for other people they have to do that themselves, maybe he has not done anything because he knows you will always be there, maybe if suddenly you are not he will do something. good luck.|`|tVPyRHEJaa	tell him to start living his life, we only get to live once, so we have to start living our life, finding joy in the life we live, and not waste  our life by smoking weed or doing drugs.   tell him to quit smoking and find a hobby that he likes to do and find the job also and not waste life by smoking weed|`|ImZISP6Yaa	Have you tried to talk it out with him?

3y0w1qIBaa	Not always.  Since I am a guy, I treat male friends and do what guys do.  For females, I treat the same (with respect) the same way as guy friends as well.
UAF9R4g3aa	Well have you been depressed or sad lately? I have these feelings often and it's sometimes because of a dream, something that happened at school or the day before, or anything.<br>  <br>  It makes me feel alone and depressed, but I eventually get over it.<br>  <br>  Just try to think back and see what could be the cause of this. I'm sure it's not serious. We all have these days sometimes, but if it's really bothering you, ask a parent or family member for help / advice. Besides you know what they say - mother knows best!

08y217Rdaa	What's his goal? If he was selling himself, then yes.|`|xXGn1zfsaa	Nah, as long as it doesn't go any further than talking. Although if they are just talking, but talking about inappropriate stuff that he would not discuss with another girl in front of you (ex: sexual things he would like to do with her, etc.) then that is definitely 100% unacceptable.<br>  Exchanging numbers is a no-no as well if you ask me.<br>  <br>  But if it's just casual talking, no biggie!

So get to know her friends. <br>  When they like you, she will like you. you have to make her friends<br>  wish they were her. <br>  <br>  and say nice things about her. make her feel like a princess. literally. <br>  girls love that. trust me.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, first you should just confront her, and ask her why she is doing this all of a sudden.. and if she does not want to, no matter how persistence you input, then just let it go, it's only for the better good, and you will not feel full of heartaches.|`|OB1fa0vjaa	MEN, I'm passing true the same thing.

So good luck.|`|uw5pSA8Taa	I don't know for certain, but when I shut down and won't talk to my husband, its usually because I want him to do something special for me.  <br>  Talk to her!!!!!  You won't regret it.|`|JnuOBwhIaa	start hanging out with her at school more and talk to her more about feeling or something sappy (no offense)|`|lOR7CH0waa	Try to be friends with her. Start conversations with her, crack jokes, talk about what's latest on the news, what's happening at school, and just casual stuff. Do that until you two are great friends, or at least, you know each other pretty well. Be sure to flirt a little bit with her, too. Then ask her out on a date. If she says no, just shrug it off. It's easier said than done, but you can do it!! If she says yes, GREAT!! Once you two are in a pretty serious relationship, tell her how you truly feel!!<br>  <br>  Let me tell you one thing, though. I wouldn't fall in love with someone unless I new them pretty well. From what you're saying, you don't know her that well. Try not to like someone THAT much until you know things about them like what their personality is like and so forth. I've made that mistake myself, and it didn't end well, but I wish you luck!! Oh! one more thing!! To start a conversation with her, ask her something about herself, and try not to let it be yes or no questions. Have fun!
GCOv4cVraa	ask another friend or someone else if they notice whats going on..then get them to tell your friend so she sees that other people see it too.. and give your friend examples of how she copied like the list you gave here..if she keeps it up.. i would stop being so close to her and not be best friends anymore|`|6Wdl6UFdaa	Okay unfortunately you've got yourself a psychological case of a friend here, she is both emotionally and physically attached to you, she most likely does not have a lot of self confidence, and does not like herself at all, maybe even hates herself, which is why she refers to copying your every move, every breath. You have two choices, although I advise you to be careful in both, because you never know what will happen with these nutcases.<br>  One) You confront her once more, full on, seriously, talk to her, if she continues to lie and live in denial, offer her an ultimatum, either she stops copying you, or you break it off, and end the relationship/friendship. This is the last resort, and its a must because You obviously can't stand this for much longer.<br>  Two) You help her find her own style, or you change your style into something thats absolutely horrendus, nerdy even, and see if she copys that, if she does, then you no for a fact that she just wants to be like you. If she doesnt copy you, then she only goes for the good stuff, so shes not a nutcase, which means you can go ahead and break off the friendship without fear of her coming after you. <br>  Good luck, and be careful :)|`|tGovHV0Kaa	You could talk to her without getting angry and maybe you could help her figure out who she REALLY is...|`|Gbvk7Vkuaa	Oh I know what you mean,and I'm with you there ! My friend's buy everything I have like exactly the SAME outfits and hairstyles.What you should do is give her a few days to herself and then maybe get together and talk it over and camly explain to her that you don't like it when people do the same things as you. Then maybe give her some advice on starting her OWN fashion trends and you will be standing out more b/c you are the only one with your own little WORLD hope this helps :) GOOD LUCK !!!

CzKrqgmgaa	if you are thinking you may decide to end your relationship you should keep everything that is yours in your name and everything that is his in his name... no joint accounts or anything.<br>  <br>  and perhaps if this is what you are preparing for maybe your relationship isnt headed toward marriage anyways...|`|1hciyvKdaa	You share credit cards, contact the institution and ask how to do this legally. In a marrage, you file for legal seperation, and the debt amount from that time on, is assigned to the actual person making purchases, in this situation I dont know. If you share banks, go in and start your own and only take what is yours to the new account and cut up the card that you have for the shared account, so he will be the only user on the joint acct, then he can go pull and start a new account.|`|pVgWZG7jaa	Spencer's mom is right. you shouldn't be getting married if you are thinking this unless of course your rich and famous!

cj0edEvKaa	I don't think you need someone like that in your life.  I understand you're trying to be a good friend by being there for her, but she is putting you down when you are trying to help her.  You should probably just talk to her about it again in a non-confrontational way and try to make her look at herself and her insecurities because its obvious she doesn't feel good enough about herself that's why she finds the need to lie.  Let her know how you feel about it and that she is also ruining your friendship.  Maybe then she'll realize she should change.  If she blows you off then trust me you're better off without her!  Good Luck!|`|8b4bIb6daa	help her get freinds and if you dont want to be her freind leave after she gets a freind at least one

I let my gal go for him. I knew that I wasn't really ready to have a boyfriend because I also was crushing on a couple of guys. Not really acting on those feelings, but the feeling of freedom was more to me than fighting over some high school boy with my best gal friend. It lasted a little while, I found someone better, and they ended up breaking up. Now, me and her are STILL friends, like 10 years later, not too common-and the guy-he's needs AA like no one's business. I'm glad NEITHER of us wound up with him in that way. He's was never like that in high school so just keep things casual because you probably won't see any of these goobers for boys who think they are men afterwards anyway. :)|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, just tell your best friend about the issue, like you like that guy, and if we fight about it, when you are going to go out w/ him, it's only going to cause major conflicts, so beware, though...|`|x9FienLUaa	if she is your bff she would know that you like this guy, and should stay away from him = "sisters before misters".

Or how about you do something that emphasizes your forte? If you play a musical instrument well, play a romantic song for her, as an example.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	What we write won't mean anything to her.<br>  <br>  What you write will mean the world to her.|`|fQUUG68Iaa	Of course someone can.<br>  I do not know if someone would.<br>  But i guess it just depends on if they like that or not.|`|CajKowXcaa	no matter how bad you write...itll be some much better if its from you...I know its the last thing u wanna hear but its true|`|AA11480344	You should write it because <br>  A. if you like her than it should tell her how you feel<br>  B. it has to come from the heart and it wouldn't be right for her to accept a poem that somebody else has written

G9gm4nnEaa	let him finish college, if you get married before you graduate, neither of you will finish college.|`|KjF0p72naa	maybe a little pushy. Finishing college should be first. It's just a given.<br>  Then pick a date. If HE is not on board with setting one yet he has good reason-he's going to marry you-it's forever-so just chill with the date thing. He's yours the rest of your life now-why does it matter that much?|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Your a college student?<br>  It is "wasting " not "waisting".<br>  How long have you dated?If less than a year wait a little longer, it takes more time to get to know some one than it does to make a baby hon.<br>  Next if you are having sex with him, he is not going tobe in any rush to marry you now or ever.I mean why buy the cow when you are getting free milk g/f?<br>  <br>  If you have dated a year or better, tell him no sex(or no more sex) until he marries you.You'll see what he is all about then.|`|QVY9Fnpoaa	Marriage is a huge move. For a 21 year old guy, it might be something more to him. You shouldn't be rushing things, you're both still young. Maybe you should enjoy life more. He probably did not want to talk about the wedding and the reason he wanted a big one is to postpone it. Maybe he wants more time. You have to give it to him. Compromise. Or maybe he really wants a wedding and he wants it so bad that he's willing to postpone the wedding so you can have it. Why don't you suggest meeting half-way? If you really love each other and you are meant to be together, you can make this work.|`|dAjB6byAaa	I know what u mean I have been engaged to my fiance' for 3 years now and he still isn't ready he wants me to have the wedding of my dreams! I respect his wishes but i don't need a big wedding! I would rather go to the court house and get married so no I don't think that u are being to pushy at all!!!|`|iOv9tbULaa	Honestly, I would wait. I don't think it's pushy. Some people especially if they go to church, like the ppl I went to college with, they get want to get married fast b/c of sex. But, I would wait b/c I'd want to save up for an over the top wedding. I mean, I'm 23 and thats why I dont even get with a lot of guys and I dont want to be serious until we're about an age where we can go all out and do it real big. I mean, like I'm going to study Business and own businesses so I intend on having alot of money saved up for a wedding. Its a special thing so think about this:<br>  <br>  What would be more special and meaningful for both of you.<br>  <br>  And TIMING- very important. You never know he may have cold feet, or wan to keep his options open for a while.<br>  <br>  But, you could get married legally and then have a ceremony after you guys get enough money the way he would like.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|v8Xr0Mn9aa	it sounds like to me he's not ready to get married. i wouldn't say you're wasting your time but you need to give it time.You never know when he becomes ready you may realize it's not what you want.marriage is not a joke. people don't value it the way they should.they watch these silly celebrities who marry and get divorced a year later but that's not the way it should be. it''s a devotion with the two people and GOD. take Your time. if he wants to wait-wait. cause it's obvious you have some issues. you cant seem to settle on how you want to plan your wedding.you would hate to get married and then realize too late that you've made a mistake or he thinks you're the mistake.

My suggestion is;<br>  Take her out to a nice dinner, maybe go to a movie, but if it's a really fancy dinner, no movie. Give her flowers when you pick her up, and some kind of jewelry during dinner. Also, tell her as many times as you can how beautiful she looks, always flatter her. Then, take her home and walk her to her door. Say something romantic like "wow, the night sky makes you look even more beautiful". Give her a kiss, say Happy birthday of course and leave.<br>  <br>  If you do that, I promise she will have an amazing birthday.|`|XaBR0Scyaa	your heart|`|IkrF987Uaa	Depends on the girl :) <br>  <br>  Normally we just like it when you actually remember our birthday. I think that presents are nice, but sometimes a big gesture is more memorable. Like if you plan out a surprise for her. For instance, if you've been with her for a while, you could take her to familiar places that you two usually spend time together and at each place surprise her with a present like flowers, chocolate, a card, and then you can pick a new place, some place romantic and you can bring some food (CAKE!), and then you celebrate her birthday and give her your real giftt, something you know she would really like. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|n30fNgLRaa	im a girl but i cant speak for all of us we may seam the same but really are all different i would like some kind of Perfume you cant go wrong with it smell her and c what she likes ask her be subtle and if you have no time shame on you for last min|`|gdVpLMz8aa	Girls like flowers perfume and chocolates or a nice fragrance gift set with like bubble bath lotions and stuff in them!! thats what i buy for my friends who are girls mum sisters you can't go wrong!!  and thats what i get and we Love it!!|`|AA11273454	romance ...something that is special to her <br>  something that she always talk about<br>  use your brain, what was the last thing which made her excited and<br>  she started talking for hours about that... then you have it.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Depends on their personalities.<br>  *Gift card on my favorite store.<br>  *Books! <br>  *Perfume<br>  <br>  ><; but it depends on the girls.|`|fZWH4ioPaa	you have to give details like whats her age what is she to you <br>  <br>  well you can try giving her clothes, jewelry, gift cards<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|0tupg3kFaa	i think it would depend on the girl. what she would like and stuff. usually girls like flowers or something like that. idk the girl so i can't really say.|`|7mMwphbbaa	what does girl likes<br>  <br>  do u mean<br>  what do girls like<br>  anywaysss ummm<br>  take her out of town|`|fjtxUYtjaa	NOT SEX. i mean really? come on. show her you really care.<br>  jewelry maybe?|`|OCZOSIMBaa	perfume..|`|10114ae4ad291d214b18ee10bbfc8bfeaa	Perfume, a new purse or jewelry.|`|9j2VKjJ0aa	my man took me to a spa, then a strip club- it was a good time.|`|goG3d3Liaa	condoms... duh|`|1GTvURnJaa	a braclet?|`|puFmaNLdaa	necklace...something like a star or heart.|`|LBdi9h12aa	how old is she..what does she like...is it ur sister...ur friend...ur gf....u were kinda general|`|32bd6b7fe9a7c5d4ba9a6a33b93335acaa	those two arent right. girls like chocolates (unless they are trying to loose weight), flowers, jewlery the works. and something personal, like a CD with all her favorite songs, a book of all your emails, and things like that. glad i could help!|`|Cn9VN1S0aa	well personally i like things that are simple but last a long time...<br>  for example for my birthday i got a helium balloon and it is still floating its been a whole month...;-)

Return to the "My Profile Page", click on the My Questions tab, click on the question. You should see a little pencil icon. Mouse over it and select the delete option. I hope this works.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	well if it hasn't been resolved  you can, but if it has, there's no way you can delete, so yeah you always think about it before you post you know?
IbhX8kHxaa	try google|`|Hfp80ylEaa	For my brother's party we rented a bus and went bar crawling.  We had a ton of beer on the bus also.  The best man rigged a bowling ball with a chain on it and painted the bride's name on it.  Ball and chain reference.  But he didn't use a plastic bowling ball...this was a damn 12 pounder.  The father of the bride had the key to take it off and was the one to decide when it came off.  He was merciful and took it off at the 3rd bar.  It had alot to do with the owner not wanting a bowling ball on his floor or seats and my brother rightfully not wanting to hold the ball the entire time.  We did hit a strip club and before we went in someone said that the bathroom lines would probably be long inside so better piss before you go in.  So every guy lines up along this wall and starts pissing.  Now, this wasn't a small "best buds" bachelor party we rented a bus for a reason.  All friends and several people on the bride's side were invited.  We had the father of the bride right in there pissing alongside the guys.  There were over 30 people all in a line and the best part is somehow a picture of it came out about a week after the party.  We have no idea who took it and no one confessed.  We also accidentally left 2 people at one of the bars later in the night since we weren't really doing head counts sober by that point.  The guys cell phone number they had switched off his phone earlier so they were stuck there for a good hour before someone realized they weren't around.  My brother also lost his ring on the bus and it was never found.  <br>  <br>  At a recent party I went to for a high school/college friend we got a fancy bus and took it to the big city to go to a baseball game.  The best man told the bus to meet at the wrong bar and so we were sitting there at the first stop for a long time wondering what the hell was going on.  Finally the bus showed up at the bar we were all at which was to be the 2nd stop in the original plan.  On the drive to the game there was road construction and so traffic was a bit crazy and one of the times the bus had to slam on the brakes for some reason and it sent a guy walking down the aisle from getting a beer almost into the windows in the front of the bus.  Good thing he tripped over the cooler and fell on his face?  Also we heard a WHUMP in the bathroom and apparently the dude pissing in there didn't have good enough reflexes and so there was piss all over him and the bathroom.  The game itself was fairly uneventful until late innings when fans were having difficulty completing the wave.  This guy who was trashed with us goes over to the section of fans that is not continuing the wave and starts yelling at them and we have to pull him away to prevent a fight over the WAVE.  The original plan was to go to a strip club after the game but the loser father of the bride took a stand and got into a verbal war with the best man who eventually backed down and the idea was dropped.  It didn't stop some of the guys who really wanted to go from starting "TIT BAR" chants on the bus much to the annoyance of the best man.  The bus stopped for food on the way home at a gas station and there was an Arbys there.  The lobby was closed but drive thru was open so a bunch of guys tried ordering from the window on foot.  They wouldn't serve.  So we waited until a car came and approached the car with our order and tried to get them to order it for us.   The first car took off but the next car was more cooperative.  In the gas station this one guy bought a medium sized turkey (not frozen) and just was eating it out of his hand.  The bus already REEKED something foul from the sweat, piss and beer and now we had smoked turkey.  Trust me it was not an improvement.  Half the bus was passed out or sleeping by the time we made it back.
VfkyAUWuaa	Awwww =[<br>  I'm sorry.|`|lNS13xoraa	follow your heart or lead it to be followed, do what yyou think is right if he doesn't love you make sure you confront him, you need to make sure don't just be in a relationship that doesn't work out make sure! but you never know maybe he has the ring ready for you. lol|`|pOmjcVjZaa	If he's the one who broke up with you, it's probably a lie.<br>  Same thing happened to me.

He said that at the end to test you....wondering how you would react to both statements. Your reaction would let him know how YOU feel.|`|y03b6F1Baa	Depend who broke up with who? If you broke up with him he could be doing that just to make you feel bad, if it's the other way around he could still have some feeling for you.|`|AA10230993	Does he also capitalize every word?<br>  <br>  Haha joking. I think he still loves you, but there's something on his mind. Talk to him in person about it. Texts are ambiguous.
zdu3gh8jaa	I think he is resisting temptation at the moment, but that is not to say he won't give in. Like you, I too would wonder whether he is trying to set something up before he next goes back. I understand that you love him and that is why it hurts so much, but I think you have to remind him just what he stands to lose if he takes this any further. Ask him how would he feel if you went looking up naked men on the internet and also what would he feel if you changed the passwords so that he couldn't see what you where doing. Do not feel bad for going to look, his behaviour is causing you the need for confirmation that there is nothing happening between him and anyone else. As you say, a married man should not be behaving in this manner. Try talking again and if possible find out where he will be staying on his next trip to DC and book in there with him or in another room.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps in some way.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	yes, at first no because he may have een mean to you, because generally strippers are treated like objects, so he mightv gotten used to that, but then when hes trying to contact her...|`|pRZ0YviYaa	Strip clubs + married men = slippery slope|`|KQqZF63oaa	I am so sorry that this is happening to you :[.  but I don't think he's cheating on you right this instant but if he finds that stripper then i have a feeling things might get bad.  I don't know if you can trust him you should keep watch on him.  The real question is do you love him?|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Yes, he wants to meet her when he goes back to DC, and to tell you he wanted to see naked pictures of her!!  I I would be worried if I were you! He is going to do what he wants while he is there, And would you ever find out!! Maybe you should ask him while he is gone to DC how would he fell if you were talking to another man! and see if he would like that!!  good luck|`|rQfzifT7aa	I think he is really considering cheating on you. I think you really need to talk to him and tell him that you know he is contemplating cheating on you. Why else would he be searching for a female so hard. Come on not just to find naked pics of her. You know the truth.<br>  <br>  You need to let him know that cheating is a deal breaker and that if he does it, then you will be history. <br>  You need to let him know that he has ruined the trust you had and that you feel betrayed even for him wanting to or thinking about it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you|`|bMbFw8dwaa	I am the other woman in my situation.

Good luck to you.|`|n3pkbRizaa	Yep and only read the first 2 lines.|`|HbJL9Y43aa	You definitely have reason to doubt him. The best advice I could give you is to not allow him to make you feel guilty for anything. Don't allow him to flip the situation to where you are the bad guy. I have also learned that if you are going to snoop be prepared to find something that you don't want to see. Stay confident and happy and let God decide what path your life will take. I know it doesn't sound easy but the best thing you can do right now is pray about the situation and let God take over. Also, even if she gave him her "real name" all he would have to do is go to the strip club again to find her, I could believe that he was just trying to find naked pictures of her. Guys are pervs sometimes! Still, don't be naive and let him walk over you. Good luck. God Bless.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Well honey I couldn't see my husband as the type to cheat either.  No really.  Did nothing to make me suspect.  We were perfect or so I thought. But he did for a very long time and with more than one woman.<br>  Never take your relationship for granted.  Sometimes the signs are hitting you right in the face and your disbelief puts you in denial.<br>  Wake up and realize that he is cheating on you.  <br>  You have the right to be informed my dear.  Hire a PI but be careful what you seek.  Be prepared for the worst ride of your life.|`|Ps5wThnfaa	Hello, I am sorry that this is happening to you. It is not fun. I honestly can say that this sounds very bad. I think that him being gone that much is not helping either. You may want him to change his profession or have him start taking you along. This does sound like something bad. He is into that chick and if he was not, he would not be looking for her info at all. That is your sign right there. If you do not take it and do something about it, he will not stop because he will know that he can "have his cake and eat it too". He will know that he can play when he is away and you will be fine with it. Please do something about it, counseling, diff job, something. No one deserves this. Good Luck! =-)|`|YfRjYAtDaa	Um wow.

You gave an inch by it not bothering you that he went to a strip club. Now he's going to take the mile. He's not just looking for naked pictures. He's saying things to make you feel guilty so he doesn't have to. He's manipulating you. Trust me, I was married to the Master of Manipulators!|`|WtmlI1igaa	Sometimes in a marriage people grew apart or think the grass is greener.  You need to decide for yourself if you think he is and if the answer is yes get proof. Go to a divorce lawyer and get someone to follow him because if he is cheating he will have to pay.  Not saying you are out to get money but why should you miss out and let the next have all of what you have when he made a oath to you.  But you need to decide if you want to stay and wonder or leave and find what you want, just remember whatever you are told here you have to live with it and whatever comes with it.
ZDB9Jermaa	Your friends won't ask you if you don't push the issue.Just don't talk about your mom.If they ask who else lives in your house say "only my grandma and I" and that's it.If they have any common sense they will shut up after that.If they are curious you may tell them the truth which is embarrassing and might ruin the mood but you can also say "I see my mother once in a while, this is the way my family is" and that's it.It works for me when people ask me about my family but I am almost sure they won't say anything, they might think about it but they won't be rude to you or your grandmother.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	she's just not home, working.|`|JjsArGujaa	I'm really sorry.

QPp7zQQpaa	You are his little girl and will always be, this is why they say that couples have to solve their problems themselves (not that i am criticizing your actions, but you let them know about your problems). It is his job as a father to worry about your well being, so any comments he makes from now on, you will have to listen with your mouth closed.<br>  <br>  Just one thing --- who do you think really wants what is best for you --- Dad or hubby? just wondering....|`|PBdPD748aa	advice i can have to you is DONT run back to your parents when you are having a hard time with your husband.. you will make their relationship and respect for your husband suffer and diminish and THEY will resent your husband. you should not want this. when it gets really bad, you and your husband should try to not leave each others sides, through the good and bad. try to stay with him under the same roof and dont leave, communication is soo important. my fiance and i used to be like that, when it got into the heat of the moment i used to leave and go to parents or out somewhere quiet or kick him out, but now we make sure we stay TOGETHER and it does die down eventually (our arguements have become less and less often). if you really need to go, go somewhere quiet and alone for you to think and reflect or go see a friend. keep it out of the family, you will do a lot of damage of you dont|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	dad wouldn't have anything to complain about if YOU HADN'T TOLD HIM YOUR BUSINESS!!!<br>  <br>  next time keep your mouth shut and stay home with mr. charmer so you won't have to be pissed off at your dad that took you in when you needed a place to go.... god are you ungrateful..............|`|89owZt6Haa	its a conundrum. you want them to be there for you;  but you don't want them to hold a grudge.  you can't wait until 5 minutes before you file for divorce because that wouldn't be fair.  they want to help you and share your problems, help fix them.  but they're still on your team only.<br>  If you're going to try to stay together then your better off confiding in a therapist.  and keep the gory details from them in the future.  ask dad to let this go...until further notice.
MGp3asPTaa	Probably, but you can't really tell with the information you just gave. I think he does like you, but if he truly liked you, more than a friend he would have shown another signal. i had this happen to me, turns out he didn't like me. but then this other guy did the same thing, but turns out he did! you gotta flirt a little more, see what happens and THEN ask the question again. :]<br>  <br>  BUT, if you don't want to then i guess i'l give you what i think...<br>  <br>  I think he probably does considering that he blushed, but guys are always like this around me soo i have no idea. maybe you're really pretty to him, but he's nervous to ask you out. step your game up and FLIRT FLIRT FLIRT! maybe try asking HIM out. but considering he said NO! well, he's probably not going to ask you because he's embarrased. you should get a friend to ask him some more about you, and try to play hard to get by flirting with HIS friends. then talk to one of his friends, see if you can get them to get him to ask you out! :]|`|CP89gyMXaa	ok <br>  i have the same problem<br>  i do not think he likes you|`|CDMTteeYaa	He definitely likes you. If you ask a guy if he likes this girl or not, and his answer will be "No!" and blushes immediately, he's scared if you would know. And if he's always trying to talk to you or make you laugh, he's taking his time to make you happy, definitely likes you! lol You know, i think he's still building his own feelings toward you. It takes time. Just enjoy what's he doing. Whatever he's doing with that other girl, just take it easy. It's either because he wants to make you jealous or because he talks to her too. Don't get jealous. I was in your situation, well still is, and i figured out myself that i think he likes me--i'm still not sure though--and that he's still building his feelings.

YSQQGO98aa	you can never change anyone.........they have to want to change and from the sounds of it he doesnt want to.  you have already made the decision that is right so put it in to play.  tell him that you need time for yourself and time to figure out what you want in life and right now your realtionship with him is not good for you.  tell him that he needs to get his life in order as well and when you both have gotten things right and got yourselves on the right track then maybe you can try it again if you still feel the same about each other.  chances are though that you have seen the true him and when you get your mind together you will be relieved to have let him go.  once you get past the breakup then maybe you can be friends, but if you dont like what he is doing now when you are together chances are you will not like them as his friend.  so you probably should just cut all ties with him and get on with your life.  you are making a big and great decision for yourself.  that just shows that you have alot of respect for yourself dont let anyone take that away from you.|`|6TFrcaoyaa	i think you need to tell him why. if you want to help him, then tell him what you found out and how you feel, cuz that could be a very good chance for him to wake up and change. if you dont tell him, than he will be confused, and you would be lying to him and thats not a good way to end relationship.|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	Why would you want to be friends with someone that is not good for you?<br>  Short & to the point would probably work best with him.

Honestly have you talked to this guy about any of this?

And if you have simular friends they will think you are a jerk.(experienced)<br>  <br>  And stay friends with him because if the things you found out are like drugs or something he will need a friend to help him through it.<br>  <br>  and believe me no matter what you do there will always be drama|`|9ehfz3Gzaa	Just be completely honest! Tell him gently that you dont think you are right for each other, but dont allow him to think there may be a chance for reconcilliation. Explain that you care deeply for him but this relationship doesn't feel right and you have to do what is best for you. You might be able to become friends down the track but immediately after a break up, the best thing is to give him some space to recover and move on.|`|VDXiS91aaa	I think that the best solution is to tell him straight up why you are breaking up with him. Whatever it is that you found out. Give him a chance to defend himself, or to offer to change--you can't change him, but if it's something he's willing to change on his own, give him the opportunity. But if it comes down to it, being honest with him is going to be the best option, at least given the pretty generic "stuff he does." <br>  <br>  In my experience, the best thing after a breakup is just to steer clear of each other for a few months. After enough time has passed, then you can try to restart the friendship if you want to, but going straight from 'relationship' to 'friends' is very tricky business, and I've never seen it work.|`|G1PDIRYvaa	The best thing to do is tell him how you feel and he may change. That is what being in a relationship is all about. No 1s perfect you know. you all should be able to discuss any problems you all have and make it work out. There is always the famous line ' i need some space' if you dont feel like doing the right thing =P good luck!|`|4dXcZhuTaa	just break it off, you know you need to do what is best for you.|`|zYEfkwmxaa	just break up with him and try to get another boyfriend|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	You need to be an adult.If you can not be an adult, you do not need to be dating.Breaking up sux but sometimes it has to be done.<br>  Just tell him you realize the 2 of you are not compatible and you realize it is best if you end the relationship now,than to drag it out.He may beg whine,cry threaten suicide etc.Do not give in to him,stand firm.<br>  Best to cut him off completely, be polite when you run into him, but leave it at that.Whatever it is he does you do not  want to be a part of , it must be bad,because it has made you mature enough to realize you have to do something you do not want to do, but must do.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Just tell him that you feel that you each are going in different directions, and you are breaking it off, if you want to be nice about it.  If you are not inclined to be nice, just say that you don't feel he is good for you, or that you don't respect the person that he is, and you can't feel right staying with him (but that would probably lead to his asking why, which you said you didn't want to do - so, you are back to the "nice" way, I guess.)  <br>  <br>  Good for you for breaking up with him and for having the sense to know that you can't change him, and that you want to be with someone who is good for you.   That is a sign of health. <br>  <br>  Not to be a noodge - but, since you are so strong and have such a good head on your shoulders, I do wonder why you don't feel that you can face letting him know what you found out. If you are ready to own the truth of not wanting to be with him, then he might be jolted into owning his own truth - it might be a baby step towards realizing that he needs to help himself, because he is not getting away with no consequences.  Just a thought.  Because if you are able to do that, then I think it would be stronger to use the second option I suggested.  Of course, you may have a good reason, like it would compromise your source to tell him what you know - I respect that.  But, just saying, FWIW.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|c674775dc13c0f95352cfe22a3a3450baa	It sounds like you care too much to be his friend. You will be right back with him, I am sure the bad things come with drama and you will be his shoulder to cry on. You DO need to get out of this, he will only drag you down, and trust me on this I AM that girl who thinks she an change a guy and it seriously will mess up your life. Get out of there, wish him well and tell him if he grows up one day to contact you but that you will not be waiting around. Good luck sweetie

AA11618542	I think guys like it if a girl is frank, to-the-point, but sweet at the same time. You should just go up to him and ask him. Whatever you do, don't freeze and just stand there, because that's what I did, and we ended up standing there for literally five minutes, with me opening and closing my mouth like a fish out of water. Practice, practice, practice! Stand in front of the mirror and practice, and see which facial expressions work the best, and what you should say exactly. When the time comes, you will know what to do.<br>  <br>  Rejection is something that happens to everyone, whether they like it or not. I'd occupy myself with other things if that happened.

IwEpMFCaaa	Being single is more of a blessing than it is a curse. It is a period of time in which you can spend time with the very best person you know-YOU. Singlehood is a time for us to work on ourselves, elevating our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual state of mind. It is a time that we can work to improve every area of our lives which are important and to take a break in between relationships. Some might argue that at times they are very lonely and long for the comfort and security of a romantic relationship. I personally love the freedom of not being obligated to another person. I love making decisions without having to consult someone else. I can go where I want, when I want and am not constricted by someone else's time, schedule or finances. In singlehood, you have the opportunity to explore new interests and to revisit the ones you gave up in a previous life. In a nutshell being single has more ups than downs.<br>  In your case, although you want to be single, you're still kind of a package deal. Whenever children are involved you still have to make decisions that will serve the best interest of your children. I know that you're ready to fly but explore every avenue to save your relationship and your family before you go. 15 years is a very long time to have invested in a relationship to just walk away from it. I know that you're tired, but you always want to leave with a clear conscience knowing that you did everything in your power to make it work.|`|sIrUiymfaa	You have a 13 year old, if you move out and take the kids with you, Thats going to be very hard on him.

They have to take her to juvi. then once the court case comes up he needs to seriously tell the judge that she is runs away all the time and he can't handle her. They will put her into some type of treatment, group or foster home. If the cops try to balk let them know that she is probably into drugs and what not. Look up on google to see if your state has an incorrigable law. Sometimes they have to build up a record first and then they end up taking her away.|`|a438aee8e55bbf5b2c8939d19ac1adfeaa	see if there is a arnette house near u they take in runaways and help them with counceling ect. i hope this helps.

I was had by a player, loved the sex, don't understand the guy.<br>  This fella is doing what men do, they want and love sex.  It is up to you to decide if you want sex before a relationship.  Have a talk with him, before you do read" Catch Him and Keep Him" by Christian Carter.  Get as much information about the makeup of a man then make a decision. <br>  I always recommend his book along with a couple of others. <br>  I read them and use them.<br>  You could be dealing with the love of your life.

MNGxabBkaa	It sounds like you've been through a very difficult ordeal and are still on the way to recovery. If all your therapists suggest that you leave home and stay away from your parents I suggest you do that. Therapists are trained professionals and they should know what they are saying. Are you still seeing therapists? If not, I suggest maybe you start seeing one again. If you are not happy in your current situation then you should adapt it or change. You really can't afford to be hanging around friends that aren't good to you. Have you got any other relatives you could live with? If you want to go back to school then you should. It will prepare you for the future, which is a very good thing. With the car, I suggest that for the moment you skip on that, considering your job issue, at the moment petrol is extremely expensive and you won't be contributing to greenhouse gas.<br>  Good luck,<br>  xox|`|4d86ab59253d21723e78ab46b486eb25aa	Just pray to God, and all the things would be fine. And I don't think that your parents will let you just bored there.|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	dont go back to your family if the shrinks says to stay away, they are probably right. what is your friend doing that makes her unhealthy? just try to get a job, and keep to yourself for a little while. maybe go to a support group from the hospital you just left. good luck and I know this may sound corny but Jesus is with you.|`|3f6de90305d5a7064a3ec6195b4cb49daa	About the homesickness, why not spend some nights with your family, if of course your parents will approve of this.  <br>  <br>  And about the friend, try talking to her, tell her what you feel. And hopefully she will understand.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is have a peaceful conversation with them and hopefully everything will turn out fine.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Dp3SrbjDaa	Well you can't go home because that is also a bad place for you.  You are in a depression and need to find someone to lift you aout of it.  You need someone to support you and help you.  It is not hard to find a job, if you are willing to lower your standards.  Most jobs aren't fun, but it is money which will embolden you to get out there doing other things.  Get a bike instead of a car, start online college, which is more expensive, but better hours and one class at a time is better than none.  You need to start feeling that you are accomplishing things yourself to get a better self worth.  This will help with the depression.  And always remeber we are all beautiful in someones eyes.|`|xLzMiknUaa	Well,<br>  <br>  Im not a therapist or anything, but i think if your older than 23, you should probably ask your bank, or your parents for a loan to get a house, find a job, and start your life fresh and healthy! Plus if ur not happy were u are, maybe u could go to ur dream destination! I hope u have luck with ur life hun!
qccTCweRaa	If you still have feelings for another you need to wait with the dating till you're over it.  It's not fair to someone else to fill a void in your life and replace it with them.  It will end up backfiring for the both of you.  Realize that anyone who is a relationship with another person and is being dishonest about it-really is not that good of a person.  Engulf yourself in other activities.  Join the gym, take walks, read books, rent movies, find a hobby.  Fill your void with YOU.  When you decide that you are truly happy with yourself and being alone-the you are ready to date.  Don't do it now and end up hurting someone else the way you've been hurt.

Mlwd5Bt3aa	What my mom did to insure that we got to help us pick what type of custody our parent's had was to have us see a therapist or counselor and have them talk to us and evaluate what we felt we wanted.  Then at the custody hearing the therapist shares their findings at the hearing saying whether they think it's healthy or unhealthy for the child to live with either parents. Usually, the judge sides with what the therapist says. <br>  <br>  If you are unsure about the laws speak to the lawyer about what you are specifically looking for.<br>  <br>  **Just so you know, I was 13 at the time and I didn't have the authorization to say who I wanted to be with.  Most times if your children testify at the hearing the judge will listen to that, but I didn't want to do that and I don't think that is in the best interest of the children to be in that environment.  I didn't want to have to say "I don't want to live with...." it really hurts both the opposing parent and even the children to have to say that.|`|6282cae4780c315a4a883ed371640c65aa	hi there <br>  <br>  it's up to a judge in a court of law  if your having problems major ones with one of the parents you should bring it to someone at your school only if it's a major problem that it is effected your life as a minor.  meaning a teacher or your principal  .<br>  <br>  be well be safe god bless|`|XlhBBZPxaa	depends on the age usually in most states it is when the child is 13|`|KYCJnJNCaa	18 i think|`|z6jDqdH5aa	no cause when my dad died and i had no choice to go with my mom instead of my uncle<br>  u have to be 16<br>  or 18

zIg9m2nmaa	I know exactly how u feel. There was this guy i liked a whole lot. At first I didn't even notice him, but after we talked for a while, and i got to know him more, i really started to like him and look up to him a lot.<br>  <br>  Only now, he's going off to college, literally, hundreds of miles away. And I know what you mean when you say you cant forget about her. Actually, i don't think i really want to forget, why would I? Even though i know we'll probably never be more than friends, I pray for him every night. I know it probably sounds stupid to you, but only because you don't know him, but i have my reasons.<br>  <br>  Anyway, back to your problem:<br>  <br>  Keep in contact with her if you feel this strongly about her. Even if you're only friends now, you never know what may happen in the future. You guys may get together, or you'll find someone even better.<br>  <br>  Good luck! =)|`|FNfOuoDMaa	tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all<br>  <br>  <br>  strong emotions can not  just be blocked out of your mind. plus, it's not healthy 2 do that. those emotions r part of who u r, so don't repress them or you'll b repressing yourself.

apbuHIJOaa	The only way you can truly know if a person has feelings for you is to ask. By asking, you can be sure the answer is sincere as it came directly from said person (unless they lie).<br>  If you don't think you can manage that, here are some tell-tale signs:<br>  <br>  - Acts more mature or immature when you’re around<br>  - Allows you into their "personal space"<br>  - Always backs you up - supportive<br>  - Apologizes a lot<br>  - Asks his/her and your friends about you<br>  - Asks who you like<br>  - Becomes oddly itchy (scratching his/her head, arm, neck etc.)<br>  - Behaviour generally changes (gets louder or goes quiet when you're around)<br>  - Blinks more than usual in conversation with you<br>  - Blushes and/or sweats around you<br>  - Calls/texts for random reasons (homework, see what you’re up to etc.)<br>  - Compliments you (tells you you smell nice, look nice etc.)<br>  - Copies you – you do something one day, he/she’s doing it the next<br>  - Doesn't talk/ask you for things, but will talk/ask everyone around you (shy)<br>  - Eyebrows raise when he/she sees you (even for a quick second)<br>  - Eyes get "soft" when looking at you (become "intimate")<br>  - Eyes travel in a circle around your face when talking to you<br>  - Facial expression changes when he/she sees you/you're around<br>  - Feet and/or upper body point in your direction<br>  - Finds reasons to talk to you (sometimes lame reasons)<br>  - Frequently touches his/her face<br>  - Friends aren't really a top priority<br>  - Friends know you, but you don't know them<br>  - Friends pay attention to you<br>  - Friends start talking to you and asking you questions (about him/her usually)<br>  - Gazes into your eyes with deep interest<br>  - Gives you a nickname<br>  - Gives you his/her undivided attention<br>  - Hangs around you a lot<br>  - Holds his thumbs in his belt loops (cowboy stance)<br>  - If you flirt with them, they flirt back<br>  - If you are in a bad mood, he/she will try to make you feel better<br>  - Initiates dates<br>  - Is there for you when you're down<br>  - Jokes around with you<br>  - Laughs at your jokes/unfunny things you say<br>  - Licks his/her lips (wants to kiss you)<br>  - Listens to you and remembers what you say<br>  - Looks at you when he/she's talking to other people<br>  - Makes future plans with you (movies on Friday, etc.)<br>  - May act weird around you / seem nervous<br>  - May avoid you out of nervousness<br>  - May get the "feeling" they’re watching you, but can never catch them<br>  - May poke you, play with your hair, etc.<br>  - May seem jealous when you look at/talk about other guys/girls<br>  - May stare with “puppy dog” eyes<br>  - Mirrors (copies) you<br>  - Mood changes with yours (happy when you are, sad when you are etc.)<br>  - Mouth opens a little when he/she sees you/talks to you<br>  - Nice to your friends (maybe extra nice)<br>  - Plays footsie<br>  - Plays with his/her hair<br>  - Preens (straightens tie, runs fingers through hair etc.)<br>  - Pupils dilate<br>  - Reacts positively to flirting<br>  - Remembers your name/talking to you/your conversations etc. <br>  - Remembers little quirks about you that others would easily forget<br>  - Respects you<br>  - Says dumb things just to keep you talking<br>  - Says, "hi," to you a lot<br>  - Seems happy when you’re around<br>  - Seems sad when you ignore him/her<br>  - Sits/stands in the "open" position (facing you and arms/legs uncrossed)<br>  - Sits next to you whenever/wherever he can<br>  - Sits up straight and muscles appear firm<br>  - Smiles back at you (esp. wide)<br>  - Smiles more when you’re around<br>  - Stares a lot (esp. right into your eyes) and holds the stare for longer than usual<br>  - Stutters/mumbles when he/she speaks to you<br>  - Talks to your friends<br>  - Talks/asks for things often (outgoing)<br>  - Teases you a lot (calls you names, etc.)<br>  - Touches you (rubs up against you and the like) "accidentally"<br>  - Tries to hold your hand/touch you "accidentally"<br>  - Tries to impress you (perhaps with material things – cell phone, car, etc.)<br>  - Tries to make you laugh<br>  - Voice changes when he talks to you (gets softer)<br>  - Walks by a lot (if he/she can)<br>  - Watches your lips (dead giveaway)<br>  - Will act foolish (to get your attention)<br>  - Will do small favours for you<br>  - Will focus on you in a group<br>  - Will hang on your every word (seems to)<br>  - Will help you whenever he can<br>  - Will sometimes choose you over his/her friends<br>  - Will try and hug you whenever he/she can (when you're mad, sad, etc.)<br>  - Will try to make you laugh (even if it involves him/her getting hurt)<br>  - Will stare until you catch him/her (shy)<br>  - Winks at you<br>  - You bump into him/her a lot of places<br>  <br>  There are not many signs that a shy or reserved girl/guy may like you, as those particular signs are too similar to simple acts of kindness and friendliness. When you’re looking for signs you should be looking for how the person changes when they're with you and when they're with other people. Good luck!
bD4mltz9aa	His "actions" could merely be accidental? I mean, you have to admit, you've sat there and caught yourself staring at someone random before right? I knock my arms around when I'm walking/sitting with anyone and maybe his sexy smile is just his casual smile?<br>  OR<br>  He could be just trying to puck up the courage to get closer to you? Talk to you more, and finding any excuse to stare, be near, talk etc to you?<br>  It's hard for me to really judge on this, because if a girl WANTS a guy to like her, she may see the smallest thing, but think it's the biggest thing.<br>  <br>  Hurting is Flirting =P so when his mood completely changes or is nasty towards you, maybe he has nothing better to say? OR as you said, he could be having a REALLY bad day =D or his friend could of been teasing him about you, in which guys do do =l<br>  <br>  Why don't you tell your friends you like him? What is the worst that can happen? He might "reject" you, but oh well, it's better than being hung up on him, trying to work out whether he likes you or not =) I mean, I believe the worst possibilities are worth the chance, for a happy relationship =D<br>  You're friends agree that you two would be cute together, I'd say take a shot, who cares if you miss, there are always other guys =D<br>  <br>  OR just wait awhile, see if he makes any moves, or flirts a little more and such =) Maybe a little more ground to stand on will help you decide when it's time he should know? =P<br>  <br>  Good luck =D

It is totally romantic and if she totally freaks out then you know that later you need to explain yourself and tell her that you have feelings for her.  But before you kiss her, i'd wait till i'm almost certain she likes me back, but i'm not a guy for I wouldn't do it in real life. :D<br>  Good luck|`|xwm5JZCkaa	it depends on how well you know her either just go and ask her out or instead of telling her be obvious and she'll get the picture. i no this sounds gay but another way is to simply text, aim, or email her and ask her out or tell her that you like her flatter her by saying why you like her but prepare for rejection, it could always happen.|`|3eacUJGBaa	this is how my bf did it<br>  we were in a class together, and once i was single, he invited me over.<br>  we smoke pot a lot.  i had only done it once before, and had never been high.  so we smoked, and i was high for the first time.  and then he said, do u wanna cuddle, and then he said i like u, and we layed on his bed, and then we started making out.  and thus begins a most beautiful relationship.|`|z4Xm0kreaa	Aww, this is cute! I have liked a guy for about that long, and I dont think he knows. If I were you, I would just call her or tell her you like her, but be flattering!

Best of luck! <3|`|gDFPCdboaa	Walk right up to her, put your hands on her shoulders, look her straight in the eye, and say, "I am going to kiss you."  Wait two seconds.

Go there and spend a day there with a friend and if you see a guy you like shoot some looks at him until he notices. He'll look at you back and you'll have a mutual interest where you can go up to him and ask how its goin. Guys love it wen girls come up to them once in a while. Dont forget to dress cute nd stuff so the guy may even come up to you. <br>  <br>  Dont worry. You wont get rejected if you can understand the mutual chemistry you'll have when looking at the guy. If he doesnt look back, dont go up to him. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps nd gluck|`|AA11554202	First of all, your question is a bit broad. Anyhow, guys are everywhere and at your disposable that is if they are available. It may be best to find a guy who is into sports because you want him to attend a b game with you and believe me not every guy is into sports. With that in mind, it would be great to meet someone at a gym (YMCA), local college or high school (not sure what age group you're looking for), church, through other friends, movies, mall, etc. <br>  <br>  Don't make yourself too desperate because you can come across that way with a potential date. Just be casual and start off with small talks like hi my name is so and so, how are you? I'm interested in getting to know you more and is wondering if you would be interested in going on a date. <br>  <br>  Rejection is everyone's greatest fears but remember that no one is everyone's type but if you don't ask you will never know. Good luck!|`|IBPNXxbmaa	umm go to a local pool hall or bowling alley that is where i met my bf and we have been together for a maddd longtime|`|CWH69mn3aa	The mall, school, stores, anywhere.

dw440Lylaa	Why do you assume something is wrong with you?<br>  My question is what's wrong with HER, that she'd want to cheat?<br>  <br>  She's trying to control you, IF she's pregnant, how do you even know the baby is yours?<br>  <br>  Move on, even if she can prove it's your kid, that not a good reason to stay in a relationship with a liar, a tramp, someone that's beneath contempt<br>  <br>  Don't let her back in your life<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  Just for the record, you're acting like you're obsessed with her, to love someone, you don't destroy yourself for them, that's not healthy.<br>  Develop some healthy boundaries, with the whoever you date........a good start would be NEVER to be with her again.|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	KTB, my friend, nothing is wrong with you.  Some people are not ready to settle down. She is very young and is not sure of what she wants.  Her behavior tells you that she is very unstable and the older she gets and the behavior gets worst.  You are a young man who deserves better.|`|NTUr0t3haa	She is SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. Do you expect a 16 year old to be responsible and emotionally stable like an adult?? She's a KID. Your expectations of her are way, way too high. She shouldn't even be having sex. She is wrecking her life at this young age and will look 50 when she's 30.|`|pxTsBlOMaa	there is nothing wrong with you but why did you let your world become something that only revolves around her?<br>  <br>  a relationship should be a balance between things you do together and things you do separately.  and you shoudn't have to worry about what she is doing when you're not together.  i suggest finding a girl that you can balance your life with and a girl that you can trust.|`|JsIidFj6aa	i disagree with that other girl.<br>  it doesnt matter if she is 16 or her age it depends on maturtiy level.<br>  ....i bet you the kid is not yours.because she just slept with that guy.<br>  i would not take her back at all. if she loved you she would not have done this to you. what i would do if i was you is make her take a prego test,in front of you... then if she is i would be there for her but not be with her. cause thats way low. and she will just do it again then when the babys born get a dna test. but dont go back to someone like that hunn you sound to sweet of a guy. dont play her games with her.use your brain you sound smart!|`|M2FFHDusaa	honey there is nothing wrong wit you if anything there's something wrong wit her you sound like i nice guy she was dumb most people don't know when they have it good she one of the ones.|`|NxZl1Qccaa	i know its hard cos you love her, but look at it this way, if she did love you why would she cheat on you and lie? move on you're still young you don't need stress like this.|`|AA11501437	nothing is wrong with you - other than you took her back.  she sucks - you deserve and will find MUCH better!  good luck!|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	There is nothing wrong with you at all. So don't for one minute think that way. Your ex/girlfriend is the one with the problem. At the age of 16, she doesn't know what she wants. I suggest that you take some time apart until you both can figure out what is best for both of you. <br>  <br>  More importantly should you really be dating someone that is only 16, when you are 18. Find someone who is older and possibly more mature. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

There are a lot of ways to please a guy besides sexually.  My s/o is pleased when I <br>  <br>  *  am respectful of him, <br>  *  listen to him<br>  *  wear what i know he thinks i look good in<br>  *  don't argue with him<br>  *  let him have the last bite of our shared dessert<br>  *  do what he's asked me to do<br>  *  compliment him<br>  <br>  But in your case, I think you're asking to do something sexually to him.  Yes, well, letting him touch your breasts and your crotch, well, I'd say that's pretty good for him.  I suppose you could touch his crotch too, through his jeans anyway.  Decide now just how far you want to go and be firm about it.  Do you want to wait until you're married to have sex?  Set the limit now.  It's not what can I do for him to please him, it's what can I do now and still be able to respect myself later.|`|cQ22MEU6aa	Nothing.  You are too young to be taking on the emotional stress of a sexual relationship.  You have only been dating for a couple of months.  Why are you in such a hurry to prove to him that you care.  Honey please slow down and take your time.  So much more comes with being sexually active.  It's not all fun and games.  There are too many consequences that you may have to face.  Sexually transmitted diseases are so common among teenagers today.  Some things like herpes you can't get rid of.  You have to live with them forever.  Other things like Chlamydia if not found in time can cause you to be sterile.  There is enough time.  Wait until you are ready, and don't allow running the bases determine how far you will go.  Your body is yours and you don't have to share it with anyone. I was a virgin until I was almost twenty one.  Still I regret the person I allowed to take that.  Your virginity is special.  You can't get that back.  Ever!    Good luck.|`|26xMlqv5aa	all right then. well, kinda weird but you can HJ or BJ. what ever you do, dont go all the way! save it for the right time. trust me, it  would sooo  special when your married.|`|4hknaDp1aa	Ask to give him a *******, there almost isn't a "too far" with guys.|`|0gJU6J14aa	you're a bit young for please your BF.<br>  Just stay in....... <br>  and if you do something for please him... you're going a too far...|`|PmGeeUheaa	Pet him through his pants.

Just like the man who is married that wants a little tryst with a beautiful woman he just met, he has no intention of divorcing, just looking for a little extra circular activity, this woman is too.  She has a ring on her finger with children.  She is "off limits" even though she feels she can seduce you with porn, how inappropriate.  She has shown her true colors, "bargain basement", low class.

Run and don't walk. If she tells you about her bad marriage again, then say something like...that's too bad. If you ever end your divorce..give me a call. If she says something like, well why do I have to be divorced...say that's the only way I can be interested. If she's just looking for a fling, then she should stop...if she seriously is wanting out of her marriage...then she'll deal with her husband.|`|wbnqzpoCaa	Are you married as well? I don't think it's right,looks like she is putting her miss placed feelings for her husband on your shoulders.

I think her hubby would feel the same way think about him and her kids.|`|ywoph0FVaa	well...that sounds strange. you should be honest with her. let her know you aren't looking to mess up the friendship, but also let her know you won't do anything since she's married. if she's so unhappy she should do something about it. just be an ear to her venting...maybe later something could happen....just no physical contact...and don't open those emails anymore. men are crazy and if they see that stuff on their spouses' email they will go crazy.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	That part where she sends you naked pic of women is really weird.

In my case. I was in a relationship with a guy for a year and a half, he left me last week and i cried all day and all night. It sucked and it was all because we thought we knew each other,we believed we did. and now that we do we don't want to know each other. sadly we are in love still and we are hurting because we don't want to be together anymore, but when we are together it feels so right,and wrong too. We rushed into things and before you do that,make sure the guy is good. Because as bad as you feel right now,a heartbreak will feel 2343525 times worse. && by the way-- Good Luck :)
62viFod1aa	What you're asking for is a definition of love and in an academic sense it's possible to answer but in the context you present it's impossible to say for sure.<br>  What's love to you may be different than what is love to me or to him or to every other person on the planet. If you feel a sense of loss when he's not around imagine when he's spending all his time with someone else and not with you. No more late night conversations, etc. <br>  My point is, to an extent you do love him maybe you're just not in love with him. <br>  What that means to you, you'll have to define to yourself, no one can answer that question.<br>  <br>  I think you owe it too him to be honest and upfront.|`|zr5WwMwVaa	well it depends on the feelings that you feel <br>  <br>  nobody can tell you if you love him or not....in a way you just know<br>  <br>  like for example when i feel in love with my ex. like real love i knew that i did<br>  <br>  cuz he was the only one that i cared for and when i would see him i would just light up and everywhere that i went i wished that he would be there<br>  <br>  and even to this day 2 years after we stopped talking i still love him when we talk all i look at is his facial expressions<br>  <br>  so if you notice every little thing he does like what he puts on his sandwich and what his fav. things are and how he likes certain things then my opinion you are in love<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and you don't have to be jealous to be in love

Or a cool movie that he likes, & watch it. Ooh! Or, you could have like a little picnic in there! (Hah. That's such a girl thing to suggest)<br>  Maybe for a gift you could make him something. Like, a card or a picture. [drawn.]<br>  Is he too ill to eat candy? Will that affect his health? <br>  Candy would be a nice treat to bring him :) Or ice cream...<br>  I think the company of good friends is the best gift of all, though.

JSruV3Wuaa	James, don't waste any more time with her - it's actually time for you to move on.  You really don't need to have all this 'on again, off again' stuff going on with your life.

If there's no trust and no friendship, there's nothing for you two to base your relationship on. Unfortunately if she's still dating her bf regardless of him cheating / rumors, all you can do is look out for her and make sure to let her know you'll always be there.<br>  <br>  Girls like security far more than anything else from a guy. If you can prove to her you will always be there, eventually you'll gain her trust back and she will always look for you specially when life hits her rock bottom or when her sun shines bright.

Beating someone up isn't worth the effort.|`|HcWJwx0Baa	Leave Without Saying A Word<br>  <br>  She's not with me anymore so I won't stress on trying to hurt him because he probably didn't know she had a boyfriend<br>  <br>  And If he did know he's a f@g and a H0E<br>  <br>  So it really wouldn't matter|`|ulUBv22eaa	i beat up the guy n then break up wit u
IhED5vaAaa	dude this is simple geography<br>  she wants to get in your pants|`|Bx5TCYVXaa	First, it could have most definitely been a mistake. Unless she's an acquaintance and has previously displayed signs of affection, then I don't think that was flirting.<br>  <br>  However, that doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't likes you, it just means you could have misinterpreted that one motion.<br>  <br>  As far as glancing at you is concerned, it all depends on whether she just spared a passing glance or its one of those look at you until you look back type things.|`|7DZ5z8Vyaa	Its probably hard to tell for you. But she likes you. Thats the only way girls can flirt pretty much. She may seem not interested when you flirt with her because thats just how girls are. Keep flirting. Get her hooked on you. Ask her out she will say YES.|`|GHmhcM1daa	It could have been an accident. Really it all depends on how big her trunk is. But the next time you catch her stealing glances you should try smiling at her. If she smiles back, I think you know your answer.|`|NX4rewuWaa	I think that she accidently brushed up against you, but having her stare at you constantly that is a sign of her liking you or her just having a staring problem. (:|`|6R1fFyWCaa	it could've been an accident, but if she's your friend you should just confront her and ask her how she truly feels about you|`|xe6FZyI1aa	WTH??? Sorry buts thats weird. any ways theres no ddefinite answer... she may not like you she may not. if she talks to you alot maybe but if not its not worth it.|`|YQq4idTWaa	its a weird way for her to get your attention, but, she deffinatly likes you.|`|7BoJwzztaa	Hit it and quit it!!!!!|`|EMKdWc4Oaa	Shes interestedd. :)|`|Aj5Suf1haa	it sounds like she is flirting with you to me.|`|GSyc4p0raa	Shes meaning mugging you|`|AEJFCUOOaa	she is in love with you.|`|DjoMGudYaa	i miss the days when women were mysterious....|`|8373e624184b0685739748535b1d8279aa	she likes you|`|lGF9GpI1aa	OMG!!!!!

Its probably just an accident, and her looking at you in the halls might just be a coincidence. I would talk to her in class and then see how she acts before deciding on whether she's interested.|`|z55dnFYZaa	why do so many ppl come to yahoo answers for relationship help, when will all these stupid ppl realise that theres no way for us to help you unless we know the girl personaly. your so stupid...|`|h9fKoHGyaa	She likes you.|`|vVolxFyRaa	everytime *** rubs up on my elbow i always get laid!|`|eMSP740Taa	It could have been by accident. Then again, if her butt pressed firmly against your elbow and she didn't turn around and appologize, she may have done it on purpose. IDK...why don't you just ask her yourself if she is interested???|`|fjvgaNydaa	Next time she rubs her butt on you, try pinching it. Her response will let you know if the's flirting. If she smacks you in the face, she probably wasn't.|`|e2vf8Y3Saa	I bet it was an axident, and maybe she looks at you cuz your cute. Doesn't have to mean she likes you.|`|ZXxgz4Xtaa	You'll never know till u make a move, maybe shes hinting at u to do something. Get on it!|`|htmxbtXVaa	She totally likes u.

0Ekxe4qSaa	i know its not the right thing to do, but i would spread rumors back..or you could go right up to her face and ask her wtf? and if she tries to walk away grab her... and if things still continue, go to the councelor so that b* will get in trouble and you will have friends that you rightfully deserve.|`|VDjaypqpaa	She really is not a friend. A true friend would not be like that. You don't need her. You will make other friends that won't treat you this way.
tu9hcqFbaa	file a restraining order. A restraining order is to cut off all contact with a person. They don't have to harm you and you don't need to think they are going to harm you. You told him stop and if you have proof..take it to the police and tell them he wont leave you alone and you feel creeped out and you want a resraining oder. <br>  What cell company do you have that they don't block numbers?<br>  another solution is to change your number and if he gets it or shows up any where you are at go for the restaining order|`|2grSXmhnaa	check if your phone will allow you to block his number rather than the company themselves? quite a few do now, other than that number change seems the way forward if you dont want to go to restraining order just yet, it can be quite weird and put you very much on edge so do whats best for you and relaxes you quicker  whether than be number or restraining order x|`|Lo163myoaa	tell him he better stop or you will go to the police, that might scare him off, if nothing else works change your phone number, but you shouldnt have to go throught the hassle of doing that just because he has boundry issues.|`|AVzQs5Uhaa	i had a situation like this but it was witha guy i dated and he started to get really creepy and stalk me and drive by my house to the point that he knew and could see that I was talking to a police officer yet I could not see him any where, the police should have spoken with him and told him to stop calling( they had done this in my case). I would suggest going though with the order of protection aka restraining order it may seem likea big ordeal but your safety is more important plus you really don't know what  he is capable of  or what he can do. Only thing else is to change your number  I didn't do it because i felt  it was unfair to me and I couldn't because of work. Also you can try this voice mail service called you mail.com, I used it to make him think my phone was disconnected when he called and it was a safe free site and you can choose different responses for different callers. And you are correct cell phone companies do not have the ability to block numbers ( i used to work for acell company)|`|hF6uZqWRaa	Why dont you just change your number. I did when my ex wouldnt leave me alone. I know its going to suck giving out your number to all your friends but if it means you will stop getting those messages from that guy i would go for it!|`|epTHjXAnaa	XD get a restraining order. That would teach teach him to leave the **** Alone XD|`|UCwnchlhaa	well ur the ***** who slept wid him so of course hes gonna want 2 c u...u hooked him and then u left him thats so mean...=(|`|GYiQEwIvaa	I think you should change ur #|`|aqGLKCxyaa	im in sorta the same situation. just do NOT respond to anything that he texts to you. If you want you can send him a text saying that it was a mistake it sleep with him and you did something you didnt want to do. Say that you are sorry for toying with him and that he should just move on to someone else. <br>  <br>  good luck !!
DcrI9zmkaa	Did it ever occur to you that she doesn't want to talk to you right now?  She does have other friends to text, you know.  It's been *five* hours.  Chill out and repost when it's been five *days* or five *weeks*.|`|IDRgZQKDaa	You're being clingy man. Don't worry about the little things like that. Girls do things like that when you are apart. If you keep this up, she will think you are needy. Not exactly what you are trying to make her think if you like her. Try going a few days without calling her or texting her. Absence makes the heart grow fonder my friend. Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option. That's all I have for you. Good luck man!|`|xRtrAcoXaa	she's probably just txting another friend about how cool you are or talking on the phone with a friend about it. So don't worry about it! If she really does like you then she'll tell you why she didn't answer you later. If she doesn't txt you by dinner time then ask her if she can txt and she'll probably reply fast. Hope your relationship grows in to something bigger and better!<br>  <br>  ---------- LOVE DOCTOR----------|`|vo3HBRg7aa	Your phone could be messed up. Did you ever think of that?
nbs487uKaa	for one thing, your friend and the people at your school are stupid and immature.<br>  i mean who would actually believe that?<br>  when people joke around like that, i just laugh and move on.<br>  stupidest rumor ever.<br>  <br>  go up and talk to the new girl.<br>  just ask her if she really does think that your a stalker.<br>  if she says yes, just ask her why she believes that.<br>  tell her what your ex friend did just to be stupid and that you actually aren't even like that.<br>  it happened in 7th grade for crying out loud.<br>  if she doesn't believe you, forget her.<br>  there IS someone out there for you, you will find someone one day, trust me.<br>  <br>  but they should of forgotten about the whole stalker rumor by now.. it's been 2 years. thats ridiculous.<br>  <br>  just do your own thing and not worry about the stalker thing. if they call you a stalker, just laugh at them or ignore it. when they see that it's not affecting you, they will get bored and stop. time will heal and pretty soon everyone will forget all about it.<br>  <br>  they think they're funny, but trust me, you will soon have the last laugh :)
6mfPS78baa	Nothing wrong with 13 year old blonde american girls asking anything they like.<br>  <br>  So you are saying that you have been "Real good friends" for three or four years and have never gone out together ? Good friends normally go out quite often , even if just to the coffee shop . And then she says that she loves you right out of the blue ? Hey things really are confusing if she doesn't want to go out with a guy that she loves ! I reckon that you need to be talking all of this over with her , it is way too confusing for me to work out . If two people are really good friends then they talk over stuff like this as a matter of course.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	ask her if there's anything she'd like to talk to you about...is there anything wrong in her life...just talk to her...
ml2FDYECaa	You ask her. If she says yes, then you get back if you want to. If she says no, then you go on. "NO MEANS NO."|`|JYHlPczxaa	If you are searching a way to get an ex girlfriend back, I have the answer for you. Yes, it is not easy, because it is a very emotional situation, but there is a solution.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://getyourwomanback.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://getyourwomanback.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  First of all, to get an ex girlfriend back you need a lot of patience and constancy; you have not to think tat it is a problem that you can resolve in a few days. The first thing tat you must understand is that girl break up only if there are some serious motives.<br>  <br>  So, your first action is to discover these motives. When you discover it, to get an ex girlfriend back you have to speak with her and tell that you have understood your mistakes and you are very displeasured.<br>  <br>  The next step that you have to do is to rebuild a confidential relation so you can search to recapture her confidence. For doing it, you can try showing your real intentions to your ex girlfriend. Make yourself always available for your ex partner and you will see first results.<br>  <br>  When you are succeeded to recover the friendship of your ex girlfriend, you have to regain her love: this is the most difficult passage. You must be as natural and spontaneous as possible to make your girlfriend understanding that you love her. Pass with her some funny or pleasant moments, search to entertain her a lot.<br>  <br>  Also, show her your sentiments, with romantic behaviours. For example, the behaviours that more touch a girl are: songs, poems or, easier, a spontaneous declaration of love; these are "must do" things if you really want to get an ex girlfriend back.<br>  <br>  Now, if you have been able and you have followed my indications, your ex will return back with you. Then, at the beginning of your "new" story search to be always honest and nice for not repeat this process yet.<br>  <br>  If you want to take action to get your ex girlfriend back in One Day,  visit the <a href="http://getyourwomanback.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://getyourwomanback.blogspot.com/</a> for more information.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	you ask her|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	If you and she broke up it was for a reason.

I wouldn't even want him around my friends.|`|bWWcCmXZaa	I'm a guy, a good looking guy and I still think you're right. Sure guys want to be around pretty girls...why not? But I would never EVER say that to my girl OR suggest, much less TELL her who she can invite to a party of mine.<br>  <br>  1. Why does he care what your friends look like, is he dating you or them?<br>  <br>  2. Are his friends such losers that they can't bring their own good looking girls on the boat.<br>  <br>  3. I am a guy and I can already imagine how boring a party full of snobby high maintenance broads would be<br>  <br>  4. When did a party become a beauty competition, find somebody who is more then skin deep...or he'll just dump you when something prettier comes along.

Trust me, comming from a girl, she's definiately hinting! The note shows that she really wants to get to know you better, but she's too shy and scared to actually ask you out. I say start off slow, ask her to hang out with you after school, then ask her out on a date, then ask her to be your girlfriend if it gets that far emotion wise. I hoped I helped. GOOD LUCK!|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Go for it. She took a big risk sending that note. Go for it if you really like her. I think she just gave you a huge sign.

In practice it's a terrible idea and can only hurt a relationship.<br>  <br>  So, Nay.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	nay for me.  Why waste time with two ladies when you can pleasure one out of her mind.  But to every man his due,  So that's just my personal opinion|`|0LXVSFEGaa	IT'S AWWRIGHT!<br>  Make sure the guys are high-fiving each other the whole time.|`|EZpT0Pu4aa	(Oh god why am I answering this -_-;;)<br>  <br>  Personally, I have never had one, its an experience I'm sure and probably something I'll never experience.<br>  <br>  However if both minds are open and will there really is nothing wrong with a threesome. it all boils down to personal choice. Sex is only an action, its how you have it and with whom that makes it worth while.

4ESlizXraa	That depends entirely on the friend.  Like anyone else, there has to be at least some initial attraction.<br>  <br>  You say you're not real close friends, so you probably don't fall into the friend zone, but you should just put your best face forward and tell her how you feel, see if she feels the same.<br>  <br>  Better to do so now before you do fall into that "but we're friends" category.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|66tpufsgaa	then i would go out with them (if it was my guy friend)<br>  to be nice and if i had fun, i go out with them again but if not then i wouldn't be shallow and avoid them|`|Vffyvq9haa	I have seen this situation before. (It happened to my friend about 2 months ago.)<br>  <br>  One of my friends' guy friend told her that he loved her in an e-mail. <br>  <br>  This is how it ended:<br>  My friend told one of her friends to tell her she didn't like him back. My friend has been ignoring him ever since.<br>  <br>  I advise you to tell her that you like her, not that you love her, because that scares people off. It doesn't really matter if you tell her by e-mail, texting, in person, but telling her in person would be better. (In my opinion.)<br>  <br>  If she doesn't like you, one of these things will happen:<br>  -She will ignore you<br>  -She will get a friend to tell you she doesn't feel the same way<br>  -She will just tell you herself<br>  <br>  If she likes you she will:<br>  -Tell you she likes you back<br>  -Get a friend to tell you<br>  <br>  Take a chance.

Ive had it happen a few times.  Its happened where i actually did like my guy friend and we ended up dating for a while.  But the break ups really sucked cuz i was losing my friend too.  Ive also had it happen with guys i didn't like like that.  That wasn't a bad thing. It meant i could be more aware of how they felt.  Not expect them to hang out with my boyfriend.  Either way its a good thing, well at least for me.|`|DsIbGLYUaa	it depends on whether i like them or not, if my guest guy friend said it i would be like o i thought you were gay  (because really i think he is not a bad thing) it would not feel awk unless she said no and you kept asking her NO MEANs NO|`|gew4KVFfaa	what did i just say b4 and u gave me best answer for?

And if he doesn't like the things you do, you can't force him to. Maybe you two are just not compatible. Don't play games w/ him though..he is your bf of 2 years and you love him. Why would you ever want to do that to someone you love? Just talk to him and tell him it rly bothers him. And he does call just really late...ask him to call earlier. If nothing happens Sorry buty ou'll just have to deal w/ it...and sometimes even if you are inlove, you have to end it. And that's not "throwing" relationships around...you are making an important decision b/c you two just don't get along as well as you thought you would. It could be better-and all couples have their problesm/peeves about eachother. Just <br>  <br>  <br>  TALK.|`|6iCOMx8laa	It's up to you, but it doesn't sound like he is putting much into the relationship.  If you want to stay in a relationship that doesn't meet your needs that is your choice. If you ignore him, he may not even notice....Why would you want to hang onto a relationship when he is so obviously not as into it as you want him to be?|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Sorry to have to say this but it sounds like he is winding the relationship down in order for you to dump him.  It's a bloke trick.  They treat you appallingly so that you say "that's it, you are dumped".  It saves them the bother.|`|AU3HVTToaa	yes|`|mMByiHaQaa	I won't tell you to dump him because I know how you feel...<br>  I've been with my bf only a few days and I would never think of dumping him.<br>  Anyway, I think you should ignore him for a week and see if he approaches you in that time and if not then you will have to tell him how you feel and maybe then he will understand.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|wG9vlIoJaa	He sounds pretty busy.<br>  Maybe you should get busy too, find some activities so that you're not always available to him. If he calls, make sure you let him know that you now have other things to think about, not just him. If necessarily, cut the conversation short, tell him you have to do a project or whatever thing you can come up with, and tell him you'll speak with him again tomorrow. And if he doesn't call, don't sweat it.<br>  <br>  The main goal here is to let him know and feel that you're not "always available for him 24/7", that you have other things in your mind. Guaranteed, he'll be trying to spend more time with you.<br>  That, if he's still interested in keeping you.<br>  But I'm sure he is.<br>  Right now he's just "taking you for granted".<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|zce6nlueaa	you've passed the honeymoon phase and he no longer thinks that he needs to court you like he used to.<br>  Men and women are different, the way men does things are different from how women deal with things. And being in a long relationship myself, i understand where your coming from. <br>  <br>  Sit him down and talk to him, let him know how you feel.<br>  You shouldn't "punish/teach him a lesson" <br>  Work it out like adults, and not children|`|Xf93fRTTaa	Playing games is dumb. You're dating a jerk. It's not easy to say bye and find someone new, but you're just going to stay with someone who treats you like garbage because it's easy?<br>  <br>  That's dumb too.|`|TMbfzg8Faa	do what ur heart says|`|3jqcLj7Saa	when going into a relationship never go into it hoping to change someone. It will not work. You have to love them the way they are or leave them alone. So many young people will even go into a marriage thinking they can change someone, bad, bad move. I would hope you can say lets have a talk and sit down and tell him whats on your mind and hope you can both talk it out. He may not think their is a problem.|`|AA10928214	Are you kidding? Why shouldn't people tell you to dump him, he sucks.. why would you want to stay with someone that sucks? I don't throw my relationships around, i was with someone for 6 years, and I decided to say BYE to them because they did what you're boyfriend did. If they don't care to give you the time of day, then find a guy that actually will. You only have one life to live. Don't be ignorant. If it's not working then it's not working. It's not going to get better by IGNORING the person, maybe by talking to them, and telling them that you hate what they are doing.. If he cared about you're feelings, then he would have stopped already. or maybe he just doesn't know what he's doing and is a little slow. Anyway, my true advice, DUMP HIM because 2 years is NOTHING. You're probably like 15 anyway|`|b08963393d5a14158ad9960d133b706aaa	I honestly I would not answer your phone for a while. I know this will be hard for you but you have to trust me on this. Don't answer for a few days more like 3 days. See if he calls you or is consistently calling you. After the 3 days review the situation and if he hasn't called  you at all or not enough like you hope to then wait a couple more days no more than 2. If he really cares for you he will notice that you haven't called or talked in a while and will do everything he can to get in touch with you. When you finally do talk to him and he asks where have you been, how come you haven't called say you have been really busy and just didn't have time to talk.<br>  <br>  After that it's up to you where you go from there either tell him how you feel about his neglecting you or just continue to treat him how he treats you. If after the 5 days your not getting the reaction you want out of him then I have to say that he's not worth your time or energy and you might just have to break up with him. I know that's hard but you can do it. Who knows maybe a break up is what you need to make him realize how much you mean to him.|`|pvDVFrKwaa	that really sucks. he seems like he's taking you for granted. i mean if you want to do that then i say do it. if you refuse to leave him then yea give him a taste of his own medicine. keep yourself busy hang out with friends or reconnect with friends you may have lost, its hard i know trying to not be around my boyfriend so much is hell for me i couldnt imagine trying it for a week but i think you can do it =)|`|qX5N60YXaa	yeah. i wont say you should dump him cause i get it.. two years is not something you can just throw away. but honestly i think that, yeah, you should ignore him for a bit.. teach him a lesson and when he calls you up and asks why you haven't called and bailable you'll just say that that's how he makes you feel and he should try and change a bit and show you he cares more.|`|rDnQ6MNYaa	Go ahead ignore him for a week...heck that way he can spend as much time with his friends as he wants.  I mean with his other girl friend(s)...sorry I sometimes get the two mixed up.  <br>  <br>  I totally get it...2 years of effort that means a lot...of course it could also mean you have had an unhealthy relationship for 18 months and are too lazy or blind to end it.  <br>  <br>  This doesn't sound like a relationship...it sounds like a booty call.  Which isn't bad...heck I am in full support of the that; but just don't confuse yourself.|`|x1ByRFHXaa	oh girl.i could never tell you to dump,and dont even think i could<br>  agree with the pending decision to ignore him for a week or so,<br>  because i know how hard it is not to talk to him.well?atleast thats<br>  how it is for me.i cant stand not talking to my boyfriend,and its a <br>  little upseting when he blows me off for stupid things or friends.some<br>  times the jealous side will come out,or the curious side,and will try<br>  to put the peices together and make him seem like a bad guy.you know?like..if he doesnt call me,to cancel and reassure me we can go out another night,ill think its on purpose,and blame him as iff,he had plans with another girl.dont stress yourself out though hunnie.think about how fast time flys.and i know it doesnt feel fast when youre going through itt.but wasnt it just christmas?hahaa.give him a week. :) .and when you do,do what hes doing.chill with friends,catch up in school or work,and trust me,he'll come crawling back.they all do. :D|`|najva92baa	Maybe youuh shurd just sit down and have a talk with him. Ask him why he's been blowing you off. If he doesn't give youuh a straight answer then maybe think again......? Also t's important to mention your likes and dislikes so thaat if he really cares he will do summin nice for youh..<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|ypeYciePaa	no, ignoring just makes it worse, just bring this up to his attention, tell him how u feel, this just haappened to my friend, he told her wuts up, then she got all pissy then ended it that night, the next day they got back together and have been much closer. <br>  <br>  same college or...........cause long distance is a beeeeooootttccchhhh, my gf dumped me cause I went off to college and she was in her senior year of HS, were in a relationship 4 2 yrs too, sucks|`|yFwc1RqNaa	yeah do true about you idea on breaking up! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  yeah i would do that<br>  play hard to get <br>  <br>  so he pays attention to you agina<br>  <br>  do something out of the oridanry, you know?|`|j0aeAUs9aa	DUMP HIM OR HE'LL DUMP YOU.  Its simple be in control dont wait for someone who wouldnt wait for you.<br>  <br>  Sorry but hope i could help ;)|`|YYAUr8t9aa	While you try to teach him a lesson. He may go out there and bang other girls that week.|`|z7AiPQcaaa	I only read the first sentence! If he doesn't show you that he cares usually means he doesn't care!|`|Ultkcc2oaa	dont ignore him that will just make things a TON worse. he might see other women that week|`|sFN3iL1yaa	Yup, give him a dose of his own medicine.|`|DqkVB9jgaa	What!!!!!|`|VTbh8n3Qaa	i'd hope she was easy ^|`|CvVgihRtaa	You should definitely not dump your bf but please have a talk with him.  It seems as if there are some communication issues in your relationship that needs ironing out.  Do not ignore him, it will not teach him a lesson.  <br>  <br>  It's not teaching a lesson time for your relationship, but coming to an amicable solution by talking about specific issues. <br>  <br>  In your talk with him, try not blame him, but let him know how you feel when he "blew you off" without calling you, when he makes time for friends when he states he has no time for you etc.  Tell him that you respect him and his studies etc, and would appreciate being respected too.<br>  <br>  Since your bf is studying, you both need to set specific times for being together.  Set times where friends and studies will not interfere so that you both can completely enjoy each others company.<br>  <br>  Ask him to compromise so that once in a while (once a month or so) he will have a walk with you just as how you do things for him.<br>  <br>  Remember that communication is the key in every relationship and not the lack of it (ignoring, malice etc...)<br>  <br>  All the best to you.|`|MUcbmgWxaa	playing game with him 2 get revenge could just make it worse.<br>  u have got to tell him what u feel, and if he doesnt change to make you happy then, give a break, think things over, tell him that he means the world to u, but u can handle his games anymore. <br>  maybe a break will make him see how much u mean to him. you never know.<br>  hope i helped.<br>  good luck. x|`|oAHKCBZyaa	well if u start ignoring him he might think that you 2 are not together anymore and find someone else. If you really like him you should just talk to him and tell him how you feel. Maybe he doesn't realize he is being a jerk. If he starts arguing with you about it then i think you guys should break up.|`|QZEDisIsaa	No.  That's just passive-aggressive bull**** and a good way to start some drama.  Talk to him about it, you're much more likely to resolve it that way.|`|nZjdi0wKaa	say "i'll give you 1 more chance, if you blow it, i'll spray paint you black<br>  <br>  aka say that chance sentence|`|OfmvrCY9aa	Just tell him straight up the way you feel girl!  I|`|SAbhEwA8aa	I would agree mostly with the previous two responses.<br>  <br>  If you're having to "get back" at a guy you're in love with, some thing's not working in the relationship.<br>  <br>  I would ask him about it. We aren't telling you to dump him, but there's no point in staying in an unhappy relationship. Staying in something like that doesn't show that you are committed, it just shows that you are stubborn.|`|bnRKolhuaa	You gotta ask your self this.... is this man treating me like he cares for me, and would you do this to him? I don't think so. Why would you want to teach him a lesson he is not a child. Turn the page you are wasting time and energy that could be given to someone else, like you. Don't put yourself through more heartbreak than you already have.You don't need it and if you are really thinking of teaching him a lesson, it won't work and he will be the one to turn the page, sounds like he already is. You are number 1, love yourself like you love him and you will see things differently.|`|dhTMwvDvaa	dont dump him if you really like him. i went through that before.<br>  and DO NOT ignore him for a week.<br>  when i did that, my bf ended up screwing two twins on his couch.......<br>  i forgave him tho. im pretty stupid..........<br>  but ANYWAY.....talk to him about it. ASK him if he cares.....confront him.<br>  but if he avoids answering......then you might wanna give him some space. dont ignore him, but dont talk to him first either, ya know? let him come to you......but only IF talking doesnt work.<br>  i really hope things go well for ya'll. =]|`|myUgfCsvaa	I don't think that not talking to him for a week will teach him any lesson. In the short term, he'll remember but he will definitely forget over time.<br>  <br>  You need to be more strategic with this. <br>  <br>  1. Find things to keep yourself busy so that you are always answering his calls whenever he does get around to it. Make yourself a little unavailable.<br>  2. Make other friends to do the things you love with. Sometimes, couples don't enjoy doing all the same things. If he trusts you, then it should be fine for you to make friends with others to do those things.<br>  3. Let things go. This is the most difficult because we tend to always try to hold people to their word. If he says he'll call tomorrow, just say ok and don't even think about it. If he's going to call, he'll call. Since you have other things to do and keep yourself busy with, you don't need his call. <br>  <br>  Remember, you aren't married (yet) so don't expect that he will report his every move to you. Dating is interesting because he is allowed at any time to say that there's too much pressure blah blah blah...so take it easy and give him the benefit of the doubt. Sounds like he's changing plans to actually help people out which is a good thing. He'll make time when he can and if that's not enough, you can talk to him about it then.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Do I think you should ignore him for a week to teach him a lesson? No... because I think playing games is detrimental to a relationship.<br>  <br>  Do I think you should perhaps take a hiatus for a while for your own piece of mind? Yes.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like this guy is not meeting your needs and his inattentiveness is driving you crazy.  I would just focus on your own life for a bit, worry about your own friends and your own job/studies and stop worrying so much about what he's doing.<br>  <br>  Frankly it doesn't sound like you rate that high on his list of priorities...and for me that would not fly... you say you don't want to break up with him because you've been together for 2 years and you love him...but honestly it sounds like it is a one-way relationship... he doesn't even enjoy the things that you enjoy when he bothers to be around.  I would think 2 years would be enough to have invested in a guy that doesn't put you first.  Sometimes you have to cut your losses.<br>  <br>  I WOULD make sure you have voiced your concerns to him and let him know that it is not okay for you to be swept aside all the time.  You do need to understand that he has committments other than you if he is busy with his work and education... but it takes but a few minutes to call and let you know if his plans have changed or if he's not going to be available to you so you don't waste your time waiting on him.  And perhaps you SHOULD be a little less available and not waiting for him to come around so much.<br>  <br>  I myself would not put up with his inattention...but that's me.  I'd rather be with someoene that wants to be with me too.|`|AA10389562	Based on your description, you really do love someone who treats you like crap.<br>  <br>  Why?  Do you not believe that you deserve to be treated with respect?<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, he will never treat you any better than you think you deserve to be.  <br>  <br>  Raise your standards and demand what you deserve or be prepared to go through a litany of unhappy relationships being miserable.
IW592N5Zaa	If you just want to be friends, then don't mention anything. Talk to someone else about it. If you want to maybe get back together then say something about it. But remember that there is a reason you two broke up...
wmLYctdRaa	Your story..I've been exactly where you are. <br>  Wrestling season sucks for trying to have a boyfriend. I dated a guy my senior year of high school named Nick. (Haha there's just something bad *** about dating a wrestler huh?)<br>  Anyways, Nick broke up with me for the same reason as yours did with you. (Even though I wrestled too on the SAME TEAM and was still capable of finding time) Honestly? For the most part I've found that guys are really awful at multitasking. <br>  Anyways, I moved on and he never did. When he found out that I had a boyfriend..he wouldn't even look at me. We'd pass each other in the hallway and it was like we never even met. Weird huh? Thats a wrestler for you. <br>  Me and the guy I was dating didn't last long..so sometime this last summer when he found out that me and the guy weren't together anymore, he texted me.<br>  Long story short, he told me that he broke up with me in the first place because he couldn't balance both me and the sport (but I could..thus making girls better then guys!) and that it sucked a lot to find out that I was with someone else and the reason he wouldn't talk to me is because he knew how bad he screwed up.<br>  <br>  Therefore..my advice to you is just to give it some time. He will see a few things. A. You aren't some annoying stupid ex girlfriend who keeps bugging him. **TO ALL LADIES, DON"T BE THAT GIRL!!** (lol Especially if he has hot friends.)<br>  B. He'll realize that "Hey, some other guy is trying to hook up with my girl? Oh hell no."<br>  C. It gives him time to miss you. No really..most guys take a lot longer to process through this kind of stuff than girls do. <br>  <br>  In the mean time..sit tight okay? I know that can be really hard to do..but dont give him any sort of attention. When you talk to his friends..don't even mention him..lol but when you do talk to them..throw in a couple boosters about yourself. Just keep looking cute and smiling! Trust me he'll notice. Especially if he's not a spring athlete too. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps hun..I know how bad it sucks. <br>  xo -NE|`|RnQFwIuUaa	You write that your ex left you, but do you mean that you guys were taking a break? Those are two different things and would have different answers. I'm going to assume that you guys decided to take a break from each other. He needed some time to fit everything into his schedule, so he made a choice that he needed to take a break from you. I guess he assumed that you understood this, but now he thinks that you like someone else. I would say to give him some time to come to grips with this and want to talk to you about it. I know you've done nothing wrong, but he thinks you have thrown him away. Text him and say that you don't like this person, it is a rumor and that he can contact you if her wants to hear your side of the story, and wait for him the respond. Good luck|`|5OLj2qpbaa	Give him the space he needs, but support him at wrestling matches.

hBGZYDKAaa	I wish I could help you but I don't know if you really ever can move on from your first love.

You just move to someone new.|`|PVFRP0Ztaa	It was so hard for me, I went into this huge depression and lost all this weight.<br>  What really helped me was to make myself look so pretty and beautiful and i used to look in the mirror everyday and say 'this is what he's missing out on' .... lol i know it sounds silly, but hey, it worked. i gave myself confidence and became strong over time.<br>  To keep him off of my mind, I occupied my time with just random things: after school activities, volunteering, oh and my friends where so good to me. I have the greatest friends because they supported me and helped me out so much! So eventually, I did that, I moved on and never looked back!|`|9MXf5r6Maa	Stay true to yourself and be strong.  Leave him for the right reasons, not the wrong.  It's always hard, but you'll get through it!|`|Tk51uq33aa	It was very very very hard.<br>  <br>  There's nothing easy about it, and you will probably always remember him for all the good times, but I try to remember the bad times, and the real reasons I broke up with him.<br>  <br>  I decided that I'd live with the motto:<br>  <br>  "I'm the best he'll ever have, and he's the worst I'll ever have"<br>  <br>  that got me through a lot.  There are better guys out there that you'll love more (trust me) and who will love you like crazy in return.<br>  <br>  Walk away, and don't look back, but if you catch yourself thinking fondly about him, switch modes and remind yourself of the times he made you feel badly.... that will help.<br>  <br>  There's no easy fix though, just be true to yourself and find a good friend to lean on.
KAUHdcF1aa	Cause you like him and you're kinda shy!<br>  That's cute.<br>  Try talking to him more and you'll want to look into him eyes all the time!<br>  <br>  It sounds cheesy but that's the first thing that came into my mind.<br>  Hahaha.|`|jyVqvRxHaa	you have no experience and were scared but don't worry he was scared too
hcRGqk2gaa	No. <br>  It's an emotion that is somewhat uncontrollable.<br>  Just like anger, happiness and sadness.|`|zFqJpKrraa	that depend on what you've got to be jealous about...|`|oWTXPtxwaa	It all depends on the situation.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	No, it is not wrong to feel jealous. Jealousy is a feeling that you can't really control. Sometimes I get jealous over the dumbest things, but I try to shove it to the back of my mind because I know that I shouldn't be jealous. Basically, you can't help what you feel, but you can control your actions based on the feeling. Whenever I get jealous over something stupid, I just put it to the back of my mind and don't ever bring it up. If you feel that you truly have a reason to be jealous, then you should do something about it. If it's with your significant other, then you can talk with them about how certain things they are doing are making you uncomfortable.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	No its not wrong to feel jealous..but of course to a certain extent. If you feel jealous its because you actually care about the person... i get jealous all the time ..... that's because i love my bf and i dont like to think about him being with some one else.|`|xoJcx0rFaa	it is wrong to be jealous. feelings ...they come and go|`|bY4Dtidsaa	Depends on the situation and the extent to which the person is jealous.|`|HgN8S3A1aa	yes

OKCqTMo0aa	Well, I would just leave it alone and let her come to you. Maybe she just needs some time to think, You should just give her some space, and hang with some other friends. Eventually she will just come to you. And if not, then maybe she just wasn't the person that you thought she was.good luck!|`|KXOjenrcaa	Your friend shouldn't be getting so upset just because you looked in her locker, unless it goes deeper than that...

You hide somethings from me and thats not the way friends are friends. They dont hide things from eachother. I hope you reconsider me as you BFFL once again. We both did something wrong. I invaded your privacy and you hid something from me. People make mistakes. Thats just the way life is I guess. Love, your BFFL (if you reconsider).|`|AIWQKREcaa	You shouldn't of looked in her locker! :P But you should like get her something. Like her favorite band or Singer's new album.

Ql0gi4rVaa	he sounds tired<br>  find some time for him to sleep <br>  then he will repay you|`|Zjo0ownraa	he loves you but he is extremely tired and needs lot of rest. but you should talk to him that you are not getting enough of him . otherwise how will he know. you have been very patient with him . its time to talk.<br>  just sit with him when he is relaxed and tell him you want more sex there is nothing wrong in opening up with a close friend.
ls7tcUpiaa	If you tell your parents, they will think that you were just making excuses, so say, I know you are dissapointed, but there were a lot of things on my mind, and i was really confused with the chapter, so i promise to get help and do better next test.<br>  and for the girls..confront them, it will embarass them and get them to stop
5AaMDz91aa	Maybe she isn't ready to open up to you quite yet.  When my friends are having a bad day or a bad breakup, I make them some cookies.  Then, they know that I care for them and once they take the cookies, they'll usually tell me the truth about what's going on.  Just let your friend know that you are always going to be there for her.  And that you are always ready to talk.
hE4CXKX2aa	Sorry bout this, but grow some dude.|`|SW48t7Bvaa	be more confident. if you really truly love her, you will ask her out eventually. that's advice to think about.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	you scared|`|4dN1atrNaa	well like you said your afraid of rejection.

We all are. I have a feeling that if you have gone out with this girl before she might feel the same way. Think about this:<br>  Does she giggle a lot when she's around you?<br>  Does she blush a lot?<br>  Does she play with her hair a lot when she's around you or looking at you?<br>  ^ These are all signs that she likes you. I hope everything works out. Good luck!|`|JT10KvVTaa	I am 13 too so that's something we have in common.

Really mainly I think you are just scared.|`|46WGsk1oaa	just do it. all guys are scared of rejection and thats exactly wat it is. ur 13 years old. u still have a long time to have fun. do it and dont think about it. if she rejects u then there is plenty more women out there for u. u still have a long time to find 'the one for u'. hope i helped and seriously dont think about it. good luck.|`|R8YvSEdPaa	well as u said u might be scared of regection, or ur just scared of asking her out, that is completely normal!!!

RAKo9sAgaa	I would stay with him if I were you, you's are prob still young and he's scared you by saying he wants to move in together etc.  Why dont you talk to him about working and studying etc.  Tell him how you feel about him not being that ambitious, if he still doesnt do anything about it then I would start thinking about other options - being single etc.  <br>  <br>  But you clearly love this guy or you wouldnt be feeling upset with the thought of not being with him...and he clearly loves you or he wouldnt be wanting to move in together.  Don't do something drastic you might later regret|`|Ym9Er1fUaa	Hah, this sounds like my situation exactly. I want the same thing as your boyfriend does and my girlfriend is the same way as you. Like the exact same. You should read my question I just put up and help me out, I think you'd be able to tell me what I should do in my situation. <br>  <br>  But umm, if you love this guy and could not see yourself without him then he is the one, if you really want him to get his stuff together and get his license and a job etc before you can go anywhere further with him. Then tell him that and maybe it'll scare him and if he loves you as much as it seems then he will do whatever it takes to make you happy. Nothing worse then your girlfriend not telling you wants wrong and what he should do to fix the situation.|`|OhKl0BAVaa	ditch the zero and get with a hero... whoever that may be moving in changes everything dont make this mistake, and if he dont have a job even hes stupid for thinking it will work.  if your workin keep it up and id say just go out on your own if thats wat you want you know to get out of the rents house, but dont just look at this as something "cool" cause it would be cool to get your own place with the one you love but im telling you hunny he will change and you will regret it. have your own place then you can do WHATEVER you want WHENEVER you want TRUST me this freedome is greater then everything else.
uGY1eopqaa	that's pretty perverted, i'd say you did the right thing. you're even a bit young for him, so he should be nowhere near 14 year old girls. he sounds really creepy and deserves to be reported. and i'm pretty sure it's anonymous.|`|xLEiYdzXaa	You did the right thing Girl<br>  x
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Do you really think it is any coincidence that he's trolling among your friends to find a "hook-up"? He's trying to make you jealous and you told him it was "cool" for him to hook up with one of your friends (why did you even respond?) You should have simply ignored him. But that is water under the bridge now.<br>  <br>  What he's doing is certainly creepy and might even be illegal. If I were the parent of one of those girls I would certainly get mad. You aren't responsible for what he does and reporting him was probably the least you could do. Even if he's just some immature donk and not a serious threat (if he likes 'em under 18 then sooner or later he'll end up with some pretty serious charges and a new screen name; "sex offender" to carry around with him to his grave).<br>  <br>  Worry a whole lot less about being "cool" and you'll find yourself in a lot less trouble next time. Instead have the courage to tell your creepy ex to go away when he acts creepy and immature.  Perhaps your moral compass needs to be honed better and honor your own boundaries with guys like these up front; don't let them push you around and play games with you. Reporting him was the right thing to do; but you should have prevented the situation by telling him that since you wanted your friends to remain your friends, that it wouldn't be o.k. for him to chat them up. Wise up, you're nearly 18!|`|ibeVcQyWaa	I think you did the right thing, however, why didn't your other friend report him?  Don't give him permission to add friends when you don't want him to.  Don't give someone permission to do something and then claim later that you never wanted to, about anything.|`|5lsViwoOaa	yes what he is doing is sick and twisted and just plain wrong. i would say it even borders some type of pedaphilia|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	Can you sleep tonight?<br>  Sexual predators are well known to use my space to get their next victims. <br>  Personally, I applaud your actions. Any 20 year old should NOT be talking to anyone younger than 18-19 years old about he items you mentioned. <br>  "In my opion" , it he keeps it up, I'd report him to the local police.<br>  I Hope you have the best night's sleep you've had in a long time, because what you did WAS the right thing to do.|`|ejosT3OVaa	I think it was the right thing to do. I would have probably done the same thing except I would have done that PLUS say something to him. Thats just wrong to do and VERY in appropriate! ESPECIALLY since the girl (s) are 15 and younger!<br>  <br>  You did the right thing.|`|uIZDd3y5aa	No you did the right thing, tell your friends not to talk to him, and tell him to stop talking to all your friends, block him, and make your myspace private.|`|27Sh9Dyvaa	Yes good job you can have a sexually predator on myspace theres a lot of them but you made it one less good job there is something really wrong with him|`|2OS6mq6Saa	You should've said no 1st, but a 20 year old chasing 15yr olds is sick.|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	Yes you did the right thing.<br>  He sounds like a creepster :o|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	yep you did heis a pig what an @$$|`|fQ881MwBaa	hell yea, that guys a pervert. wanna see my dong?|`|B4kf9jDGaa	you did the right thing, he has no right talking about stuff like that.|`|J9Rgy02baa	yeah, you did. the report should be anonymous, so you should be fine there. But yeah, you did the right thing, don't feel bitchy about it. If no one stops him he'll keep talking to your younger friends, they'll probably feel uncomfortable and could get mad at you because of it. So this way he should stop what he's doing... good job :)|`|xq0vx48uaa	Yuuh did the BEST thing.<br>  What the hell does he think he's doing?

Thats just wrong of him to be going after girls that young.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	yes you did. i think the boy needs therapy. I would have one of your younger friends report him as well. the more the better.|`|uFwnaRJEaa	i think you did the right thing.<br>  i know i would hav did the same<br>  a 20 year old talking sexually to 15 yo girls?!<br>  creepo!<br>  haha

4IEslDiiaa	this is easy...be friend with him and be extra attentive and caring for him without being too obvious ... try to be where he hangs out..find out what he like to do...if you want to make it look accidental that you are in the same place at the same time as he is find out from one of his friends where he will be on a particular weekend and be there...maybe you can get the ball rolling|`|K1otsFPNaa	you could be like ,"oh what would you do if i said i like you?" and see what his answer is.

3ch6ADzxaa	Well I was always told that a girl shouldn't ask a guy out. Don't seem desperat hunny. Get him to like you! Cause you asking a guy out can lead to a hurtful ending. [[Quick facts: I have had friends who've asked guys out... when the guy gets bored, they usually end up saying rude things to the girl like "I didn't like you.... you were the one who asked me out" or they'll tell their friends "Yeah, that b***h is all on my nuts"]]. This doesn't happen all the time... but you can save yourself the pain. So yes... stick to the old fashion... give yourself your place =). A way you can tell he's crushing on you... man idk. You can just kinda feel it. Its hard to explain.|`|tHwK0gdFaa	We are living in the 21st century, I think it's OK when Girl asks a guy to go out. But not like ' Would you go out with me?!' But just invite him for a walk or something, or perhaps go somewhere like a club for expl. :) Try out the opportunity, the worst that you can get is 'Sorry, I can't' or 'No'. But anyway you should give it a try :)|`|L2SLF4L5aa	I say you try to start simple first.  Just simply try and talk to the guy at first and be his friend.  If he has an interest in you, you will find out soon enough (unless he is incredibly shy).  If you guys start out by talking, IM'n or what not, it will open more opportunities in the future to go get a bite to eat with him or go to a movie.<br>  Good luck :)|`|sriByWZBaa	Well if you know that the guy has a "crush" on you my guess is to make the first move. He likes you but probably is too shy to say anything. Talk to him. Tell him that you like him more than friends and ask if he wanted to hang out! You don't want to wait forever wondering when he'll ask you. Go for it! ;)|`|ueWVf6Y1aa	To start off with, you could just invite him to someplace like the cinema. The worst thing he could do is say no.
PZ9OSv9naa	If that's what makes you think someone has a crush on you.  Then there are about 30 guys at my gym who have a crush on me.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Lol, men...just because someone looks at you doesn't mean they have a crush on you.|`|JN6LWA6Oaa	Maybe she was just impressed on how much you put up and not necessarily crushing on you....|`|XkmqZ07Daa	LOL- Agree with cannibal|`|aW4ivP7Faa	i agree with pat
18vHHaBQaa	She obviously is insecure.  But most people are, and not always for bad reasons.  Maybe she sees a threat because you are one, though no fault of your own.<br>  <br>  You say your best friend used to like you, and that now he doesn't.  As a guy, I would doubt that.  Is he still attracted to you?  Perhaps more than with his GF?  Did you ever have a physical relationship?  Even if you didn't, the fact that he wanted one, and most likely would still have one if possible, may be giving this girl a bad vibe.<br>  <br>  All three of you are observing the same thing, but seeing it differently.  Right now, you only know how you see it.  You need to talk with this girl at a neutral location like a Perkins or something.  Share your perspectives on the situation honestly, no bull.  Maybe you can learn how she feels and she yours, maybe not.  But I can't see it hurting at this point.
d7bJIgqlaa	Yes, tell him.  Maybe it will end in marriage, maybe you'll date a while, maybe he will say he isn't looking for a serious relationship but, at least you won't wonder the "what if".  Just really think about what you are going to say first.  Make sure you don't ruin the friendship you could have.  If you are going to get angry if he tells you what you don't want to hear then don't do it yet.  Also, remember that he is in college now and a whole new world is infront of him so he is growing and may not be ready.  I don't mean to put a damper on things and I hope it works out for you, I just want to give you the other side of things too!  best of luck!!!|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Tell him. What do you have to loose? besides him.

pZVEBEmLaa	I think facebook is a good idea. Or you can try typing her name up in google and visit the links.|`|KmWjsc71aa	I would say that if you can afford it, perhaps you should consider hiring a private investigator, unless you want to go to that last known address and start asking questions to the neighbours or the local police station. <br>  <br>  I don't know where you live but there could be certain legal restrictions in what you're trying to do, though your heart is in the right place. It may be hard to explain why you're looking for this person, but it is my understanding that some private investigation agencies have access to police records and stuff. <br>  <br>  I hope it works out for you and that you can find your friend.|`|kGO4ZhtQaa	try facebook - nearly every1 is on there nowadays<br>  <br>  or maybe freinds reunited or something (although im not sure how that works)
GqhtePhgaa	Have a pour it down the drain party.  <br>  <br>  Remember, it's up to him to keep sober.  There's not much you can do except support his efforts.  He's got to want it really badly!

This shows he is not committed.<br>  <br>  If you were both committed, your relationship would be open and exclusive. <br>  <br>  It seems you are ready to get more serious about your relationship or you underestimated how serious you already were with him. I would get rid of him if he did this to me. He doesn't sound serious.
WVBmz8L3aa	its simple it may sound like it real obvious, but its all about confidence. If u approach your man like you know for a fact your gonna please him no matter what then then you'll be fine. <br>  It don't matter what positions you use cause if your not confident in your ability as a lover then you could ride him like horse, then at the end of it you'll still think your not good at sex. <br>  so confidence is the key, that's what i think and my man is always pleased and satisfied ..!|`|4HjbYbQCaa	Ok gurl!

YqkN4nbUaa	no thats retarded|`|nP6QXbCsaa	Yes. You do that one when the person is far away.. usually a guy would do the "index finger thumb hole and other hand index in to hole" gesture, but that could cause confusion.<br>  <br>  Why? Because the guy might think that you want to do that to him... OR might not see it from a far.|`|doHNEvf8aa	ohh ive sceen it.|`|VnCVkHDhaa	The one male secret revealed what has the world come to|`|1EXAZMnLaa	Yes it is existent.|`|12gvcc2Daa	it's one of those things that you just know, kinda like breathing.|`|FRNDkLNqaa	haha that was funny|`|SHwuzsPyaa	i know about that site LOL<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  found it from a friend about a week ago|`|QEsehPtQaa	Its either the......<br>  A.

9QyrW2iCaa	Sounds like you're down the dark scene . . . also looks like you've already answered your own question.  <br>  <br>  I was going to suggest shaving the shaggy facial hair into a goatee with mustache--cleaning up the facial hair a bit and also recommending getting some more sleep with some exposure to the sun.  But, I'm not thinking this is the direction you're wanting . . . black hair will make you look even more pale, but maybe that's the look you're going for!  Good luck with whatever you chose.  = )
Eqi0BNUhaa	i have about 5 and i can always count on them!!|`|o0Badlndaa	MANY ...|`|JCdBSULraa	none, sadly.
b224773006567fe0674e68a21e1ee238aa	i havent bench pressed but on the "incline chest press" i do 90.. i'm not sure how that compares haha... but i'm a hockey player so i bet i'm stronger than you! : )|`|GBr9YngTaa	Unfortunately no I can't. I fall into the stereotype of being weak, where most girls really aren't and could very well lift over 60 pounds.|`|gisIaZULaa	60 lbs? that's nothing<br>  <br>  I can lift probably over 100|`|Uxcp7z0uaa	80lbs|`|Nl64RmRWaa	I'm in a weight training & fitness class in school to get more exercise, and my average is 80-90lbs. But then again, I have about 3 more months of the class to bring my average up. The more you practice, the more you can usually lift. 60-70lbs is usually what girls start off with if they've never lifted weights, so don't be ashamed!|`|H7cNZYIYaa	my ex could lift over a hundred pounds.  I was so confused, she was this seriously small girl.  not like, short, but really skinny, like to the point I still worry about her lol
BRyRtQSvaa	no such thing as unintended, that's like saying you don't know what you did because you were drunk! Excuses!|`|ZyfilGjFaa	yes!!!! the point of sex is that the penis goes in the vagina!!!!!! DUH!!!!! i think a 9 yr. old would know that!!!!! geeeezzzz!!!|`|Bsf78pfsaa	are you on something come on these questions are wasting time so now its only sex if you plan it|`|AA10873763	That's up to the people involved to label it.<br>  Some would consider the half-clothed make out session to be sex.  It's up to you to define.
EZpT0Pu4aa	First off. <br>  <br>  I feel for you, I do, but not enough to actually answer this seriously. We know for certain you're ego isn't hurting. <br>  <br>  Honestly, you're a gorgeous woman then act like one lol 'look within arms reach, be unattainable.' Find the right guy. Most of these guys with 'broken hearts' are merely lusting for you. That's not broken hearts it broken pride. <br>  <br>  As for bad karma. I'd say you've probably have a case of it, but not from broken hearts of men. No doubt that there is a small collection of girls with a case of low self esteem who've seen enough guys tail you to curse you with some ancient hex or something. I wouldn't worry about it in other words. <br>  <br>  Look, you're beautiful, that's great. There are guys who will always fall at beautiful woman's feet. There are guys that will charm you and then you'll have a broken heart. <br>  <br>  My advice stop the pity *****. Find a boy friend to treat you right and don't look down on people anymore.|`|Ll1bHeCmaa	Don't try to make yourself less attractive just choose a different crowd to hang out with.  And they come up and ask you if they will sleep with you just get defensive and if you get the right friends they won't ask you.  They will like you for who you are not how you look.|`|yr1xv9ohaa	ok i think you need to stop with the arrogance a little bit!..all you had to say was that you were really attractive : none of that im stunning stufff.<br>  <br>  Truth is, stop with the charity sex dont be around them at all if you think they will fall for you, or lay boundaries letting them know that you arent interested in them...its important not to lead them on.|`|eYuIsNk1aa	show them your troll & they will leave|`|G2Nnt23xaa	HAHAHA your conceitedness is absolutely hilarious!!! btw, don't take it personally that all these guys come after you. um, hello. have you met men? they'll f* anything with a pulse. they beg you more than others because by having "charity sex" you're coming off as a slut. <br>  i just have to say this is one of the funniest qs i've seen today!!<br>  <br>  ps, wanna get some good karma? look for a guy who has a real personality, not looks and a porsche. but first, find a personality (not a ridiculously large ego) for yourself|`|AA11083274	There are plenty of guys that would love to sleep with you.  If you are up front about it, I am sure that they will take it for what it is and just enjoy a hot night with a hot woman.<br>  <br>  Or you could put on weight and shave your head... I bet less guys would want you then.|`|PYIA2FCFaa	just start being a complete ***** or tell them you have an std.|`|8zyu6FWpaa	LOL.  Nice one.  But don't worry... old age will take care of any beauty problem you have.
PvAIY7OPaa	He wants sex with no strings attached and pay attention to what people say to you the first time. He is throwing some emotions like "i like you ****" and he knew that you will buy it and unfortunately here you are asking us.<br>  <br>  Your hoax hunch is right on the money ...find someone who is interested in you and don't date him unless you are only interested in the sex part!|`|23bgwpD1aa	He could be telling the truth. I would not read to much into though. You can never really tell.|`|lzooHi0Baa	Most guys will try to get into your pants as soon as possible, drunk or not.   You had a lot to do with the incidence.  The moment he proposed sex, you should have stopped him cold.  When people are drunk, they just stop being ashamed, but they always say the truth.  I remember when I was dating years ago, I would make sure the guy would have a couple of drinks and then I will just sit back and watch the real man come out.|`|Bq51x58jaa	its ur call. u should know if his texts are genuine but if u didnt put out on the first nite and he is still in contact with u then maybe he is interested in u for u and not just sex. if u meet again dont sleep with him straight away and see what happens. if he stays in touch then he is interested.|`|AU3HVTToaa	dunnooo|`|gjaPNWbTaa	**********************OMG***************...<br>  <br>  ******************I like, totally think it's a hoax.  Wat u?***********<br>  <br>  **********DUH*************|`|n7uF90t3aa	He needs to put his money where his mouth is.<br>  <br>  You won't know for sure until you see him again in person.  If he asks or pressures you to have sex when you do see each other again, there's your answer.  If he acts like a gentleman, and takes you on an actual date (as opposed to just drinking at a party), he might be for real.  But either way... I'm sure he's trying to have sex with other women, so I wouldn't get too attached if I were you.|`|AA10204462	sounds to me he is being honest with you. he just wants to bang you and move on
u7sQmJrdaa	Come on, you texted him AFTER AN HOUR. He probably thinks that u were ignoring him, or that he didn't read the message.
FnfHTOnaaa	well its gonna be hard if you were having sex with him and just one day decided well i dont wanna do it anymore until marriage...but if you guys havent had sex yet..then maybe he is ready to take it to the next step but if he really loves you then he should respect your decision...but if you were putin out and now you're not thats a different story|`|0ORr7sbtaa	hi...you answered my question about tanning?<br>  <br>  well...that's not what i was looking for, you obviously didn't read the question very well...<br>  <br>  <br>  so im sorry i wont be answering any of your questions|`|UhZk09GDaa	If he can't wait for you then it's not love? Well since you've already done it...then it probably is normal. But you need to watch him...|`|62viFod1aa	From an atheists perspective god is simply an imaginary friend. He doesn't understand how real it is too you so instead it sounds to him like you're making excuses to not sleep with him for other reasons. Which likely make him feel inadequate. <br>  That said, Marriage is an institution that was a recent addition to the "faith" the bible itself didn't originally mark such a union and the entire idea that "Saving yourself for marriage because god wants you to" is really and truly a lie made up by ultra conservative protestants.<br>  The concept is a modern addition that has been artificially added to your religion. Don't accept such things at face value, think for yourself. <br>  You should only save yourself for the one you love not for some union designed by the church to control you because that's very much what it's all about.<br>  <br>  EDIT: No he's not a bad guy for feeling the way he does. From his perspective you cutting him off and using god as an excuse sounds more like an excuse to not be with him anymore.|`|AU3HVTToaa	wow
D5UAhY8jaa	no not at all|`|9d537b726f4a147f0e61858f11a6b659aa	no i wouldn't think its weird she probably likes meeting new people and saw a n interest in you. Then again it depends on your personality if you like meeting new people and are not shy that's how i am personally, but all in all if its just that i don't think its wierd.|`|LVDV6PjKaa	Go for it...:)|`|ZS8eBOfZaa	not weird at all.  If you and your friend are reasonably good looking, the guys will say yes.  We're easy.<br>  <br>  hahaah.|`|tRj2Mmx9aa	I would do it! I mean what have you got to lose, Either you get to hang out with some chicks, score a gf (maybe), or get some new friends!|`|6KUWGCAmaa	go sit with them. its not weird, they found you attractive and wanted to talk to you|`|KNQsNbeqaa	I'm not a teenaged guy but I'm pretty sure the only reason they're at the mall in the first place is because they're hoping something just like that will happen.|`|Xlzk4tO5aa	yet it would be a little weir.......BUT<br>  <br>  any guy would be stoked and would for sure want to sit with you just because he would feel like a playa|`|RRGoldrAaa	wow .<br>  That doesn't happen a lot .<br>  but when it happens in sweden you absolutely go .<br>  because maybe you are going to SCORE tonight ..|`|bab2c3617b63acf755e2b8606eb53447aa	I would!|`|AA11036954	i say go for it, just be cautious when your around strangers
IW592N5Zaa	well we like hygenic and clean guys, so if you insist on wearing boots then make sure they're clean...but i think everyone would prefer you wore sneakers or something|`|JUrcvLklaa	Im a year out of high school, but i have to say that dirty work boots are a heck of a lot better then clean ones... <br>  <br>  I remember all the guys in my highschool that wore the brand new work boots, but wouldnt go near any dirt or type of work...  They only wore them because it was the style...<br>  <br>  Dirty work boots say that you are willing to get a job done and you don't freak out if you get a little dirt/manure on you...  <br>  <br>  Stick with the dirty boots, if a girl freaks out because they are a little messy, then she aint the one for you... No girl that hates dirt would ever survive on a farm!<br>  <br>  If you work on a farm/own a farm, be proud of it!  Show those dirty boots off with pride!|`|0HAUGE0uaa	agreeing with Erin..|`|Ycb7826Vaa	i think work boots are tacky.. get some jordans, they look sweet on guys.. anyways you shouldnt have to show off ur manlyness.. if you do then your not to secure about yourself
ibeVcQyWaa	All I can say is you two made a pact, you didn't with your guy friend.  You have to decide if one means more than the other or if you just need to stay out of it all.  Tell them that you don't want to hear anything one has to say about the other and then you won't be in these awkward situations.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	Don't tell her you know. It will just hurt her more.|`|aUosbTqqaa	keep secrets... you will keep them both. if she says he left her act like you're suprised.|`|ejosT3OVaa	well If you want to keep them both as friends I say take some acting classes. Cause the way people are today the SMALLEST of things can destroy a friendship.<br>  <br>  You cant tell her cause if you do then your guy friend will be pissed and if you DON'T tell your girlfriend then she will be pissed. <br>  <br>  OR you could just talk to your guy friend and be like "I don't want to jeopardize our friendship and trust with each other but I cant keep this from her She is my best friend and she needs to know."<br>  <br>  Cause you would be jeopardizing two friendships in one. If you tell he's mad and if you don't She mad. So I would just try to talk to him and tell him how you feel about the whole thing. <br>  <br>  But hopefully he will be understanding. If he's not then to me he's not that good of a friend. Really not that great of a friend anyways to make you keep something from your best friend.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps and good luck
nEv5HqDsaa	Aww sweetie! This is totally my case, except my dad didnt say "is there a funeral going on" that's a little harsh on his behalf. Find out the reason why u parents dont like him, parents always want the best for u right? Explain to ur parents that he treats u well, and hear what they have to say too. My suggestion is don't rush into marrying him if ur parents disapprove, it'll create a lot of drama, give it more time to show ur parents that he's a good man.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	there must be something this lad has done or his reputation<br>  <br>  sit ur mum and dad dopwn and ask them why?<br>  <br>  xxx|`|A3fYo8eYaa	Maybe because your sister is older and they don't want another daughter to get married because it means your growing up and you'll probably move out. And of course, they'll miss you. I kind of have the same situation with my boyfriend except my friends don't like him because he had a bad name..but he's changed now and really cares for me. In a while they'll get used to him, and I'm sure your parents will get used to your boyfriend. Just wait until they get used to him.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	maybe you need to sit down and ask them why they dislike him.  most parents get gut feelings and can have a point.<br>  <br>  my parents are hard on my bf because they know how much he cares, but he has to get his life together.  they think that right now he is not good enough for me...but if he gets a good job one day and can provide for a family...then he iwll be worthy.<br>  <br>  maybe they will have some insight.  could you push back your wedding if they were willing to get to know him better and spend more time with him?<br>  <br>  if they dont have an explanation then they are shallow and i wouldnt worry anymore...i would say thank you...im goign to get married now, with or without your support, becuase you cant tell me what is wrong with this guy,..|`|771702cc138b8e49b58a97fac0fcaa49aa	My ex fiance's parents never liked me and they played a lot of games with me and ultimately it ended up destroying our relationship.  I was great to my ex and always did everything that her and her parents wanted but it didnt matter.  It can take a serious toll on the guy so its kinda up to you to let him know that you still care for him no matter what your parents say and try to not put him in situations where your parents can really tear into him.|`|52bb38389ace91aedab5837d20eb5996aa	you need to sit down and talk to them about it. your parents shouldnt want u to be unhappy. and my parents hate my bf to the point where they kicked me out of my house and don't talk to me anymore. but he has been more supportive of me than they have. it is really sad but your lucky to have people who love you and are probably just worried.|`|AA11328507	I would hope they have a reason to not like him...I would also hope that you continue to live your life with him if that is who you want to be with inspite of how they feel about him.|`|Q7DXrxMTaa	if you love this guy, you should not let anything get between that.<br>  <br>  You would be seriously unhapppy without him so just make sure you let your parents know that he makes you happy and without him your life wouldn't be anywhere near as good.<br>  <br>  Also try to find out why they have something against him. DOn't confront them- just ask patiently if they have something against him because of the way they act towards him. Just let them know that it's important to you that they get on with him and that you love him and that's not going to change.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Well no one should determine your happiness. If they don't like him, oh well ! Let them kick rocks they don't have to like him, you do. You're the one who bones him and hes there for you, i think they are mad because they cant have the kind of love you guys have. Who cares what people think if they loved you, they will be happy for you. Remember its your opinion that matters.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	One thing...dont compare your self or your bf with your sisters. Ya are two different people. My bf cheated on me (was talking to other girls behind my back) and my parents hated him! Even though they did he was still around and he tried his best to be good and say hi to him even though my mother wouldn't say hi back. They got over it! They like him but they say i can do better. Parents always think there kids are too good for any one! They are parents...just talk to them and let them know how you feel.|`|3b1sLldGaa	hmmm<br>  most of the time when your parents/family don't like the guy something happened 4 them 2 feel that way. Sit down w/ them & ask them why they don't like them & c what they say. Then go from there.|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	well if I was a woman, I wouldnt care.  As long as i loved him thats all that matters.  so you shouldnt think about what others think, just yourself|`|gRXy66dOaa	I wouldnt care<br>  i would just move on with my life..|`|V6dz395kaa	Show your parents how great u and him are when u guys are together!|`|dhTMwvDvaa	do they have a reason for not liking him? i'd talk to them about it. Really calmly. dont raise ur voice or object, listen to what they have to say. And then state ur case. Tell them how much it hurts you that they disapprove. most parents are open to discussion. If yours arent that kind though, then i'd say just keep trying to make them like him, discreetly, and maybe they never will, but like, dont leave him or anything, whatever you do. I went through that before, i dated a guy for 3 years who my family hated...and still, hates to this day, even tho we broke up. so i know how it feels. it sucks.|`|ktyZMRAjaa	**** it, forget them they can not tell u who u can and can n ot love. <br>  They may be ur parents and all but all because they have athority on u doesnt mean that they have athority over ur heart. **** those kinds of people get on my ****** nerves. i hate them type of people|`|BVDGySbAaa	feel so sorry for you...was in that situation before sorta..i wasnt even allowed to see him..it sucked...i know you want to just go and marry him..but you know your parent's blessing and advice count a lot...years later you might look back and see that they were right...
83530e5bf3f668061c4a8ef08d34c8a6aa	You do not have an anger problem...you have a communication problem.  Meet some where public, like a restaurant and talk to each other.  Tell him what you just told us and ask him why he was like that.  Ask him if he knows or cares that your relationship is in danger.  If he just blows it all off as a bad reaction on your part--you don't need the guy.  Then tell him not to call or see you and wish him a happy life.<br>  <br>  Dr. Tommy Skelton|`|08MEBczvaa	how old are you? because if your a teenager guys tend to only want one thing. so if you dont think hes worth it, say bye bye!<br>  oh and if he is crying or upset about you around his friends, then obviously he cares because guys really dont tend to act that way around there friends...cause his friends would think he is "whipped."
bUlFwUTBaa	My sister is really shy, it was due to an accident when she was young..|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Shy is just a nice word for coward, we all know this.|`|wG9vlIoJaa	Basically, fear of rejection and humiliation.|`|AA11747856	Shy means that yes, you're a little scared to step out of your comfort zone, but truthfully EVERYBODY is.  Putting yourself out there and being outgoing can lead to rejection and nobody wants to be rejected.  But, most often, everyone feels the same and some people are good at getting over it and they are probably better off for it.|`|FjZZ6HPkaa	Shy is when youre quite quiet, well you might not be when you get to know them, they could be very loud. But when you first get to know someone your quite quiet and maybe a lil scared<br>  x<br>  loads of people are shy, its not a prob!<br>  I am, until you get to know me and im verryyy loud lol
989e51fc394218110ae47317f57dd677aa	I hate to give you false hope because it could go either way. But maybe this other girl thing won't last. Stay busy, hang with friends, heck flirt with other guys. Give it a little time and maybe you will get him back. Don't become needy and depressed and boring though. Good luck.|`|dUldkU74aa	ohhh i know what youre going through. i know sometimes it's easier said than done, but go out, have fun and find a guy who will get this guy off your mind. it may take a while to get that guy off your mind, but don't get yourself down. show another great guy how great of a girl you are! good luck! :)
RFeYz59maa	Maybe he's scared of your brother and just said the first thing that popped into his head.|`|a2wZg7DQaa	mabie he doesn't want yr brother 2 no that you like him?.<br>  <br>  boys wat we gonna do cant live with them, cant live without um. <br>  <br>  lol. :)|`|ebwe0Duzaa	thats actually pretty common for guys to do that kinda crap...it might be because he is shy and didnt want your brother to tell you that he likes you or something like that...or maybe he likes someone else now that he is in the high school?  or maybe he never liked you to begin with?  get yourself a spy lol...

And um she might like you, I don't know enough about her.. But if it seems like she flirts with you a lot, and always wants you to be near her - Then that's a definite she likes you!|`|NdipJvopaa	thats fine i guess but kinda weird.<br>  next time just b like, cmon baby sit on my lap this time, or say, hey (name here), ocme sit on MY lap this time.<br>  or just,<br>  hey (name here), come sit on my lap...<br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|XBUa3Kniaa	haha thats cute. I think its fine if you sit on her lap.

But yeah, I would have done it, then made fun of my friend in private for being jealous because he wasn't sitting in her lap lol. Jokingly of course. And if she noticed him saying that, I'd definitely take that as an opportunity to trade spots and have her sitting in my lap, then your friend would have nothing to say except "lucky bastard" ;) that was a fun answer lol.<br>  <br>  I'd say she is definitely interested in you. Find a way to sit in her lap again... lol|`|Z9Vf2xZbaa	Well i personally think its cute. I mean ive done it plenty of times w/ my friends (that are guys). You could just be really close like that, or she might like you. it could mean one of the two. But i wouldnt freak over it tho. cuz she might be starting to like u, but then get creeped out in the process. Just stay low about it but pay close attention to any other hints.|`|Eg0TyoUHaa	Haha. That is cute. I don't think there is anything wrong with a guy sitting on a girls lap. If I was comfortable enough with the guy I liked I would probably do the same thing. I think there's a good chance that she does like you.  And your friend, yeah he was jealous.|`|uGY1eopqaa	Lol i think that's cute. there isn't anything weird about it really. she's just trying to be flirty with you. and your friend? well he's probably just jealous. :]|`|RFTzEc5Jaa	wtf was with the additional details?<br>  anyway, yeah she does or might just be flirting.|`|hqtS7bVEaa	this means she likes u but be careful she might cheat on u|`|zyPfWLpOaa	Shes the Butch<br>  Your The *****<br>  <br>  CHANGE THAT BEFORE U GET STOMPED ON|`|avn6a4Xlaa	she acts like she likes you, go fot it <3<br>  good luck x
5ivLSWQPaa	I think that kid like you. lol. Best to Ignore or reject him.
oWTXPtxwaa	This one's a hard onee,.<br>  <br>  But i think no one you should get in the way of your lover and youu.<br>  <br>  :)|`|5KZdTMPDaa	Moms are usually right about these kind of things.  Even if you dont want to believe them at the time.
loWnyd0waa	aww cute! =P <br>  well i think it would be really lame if your mom didn't let you date him && seriously what type of "baggage" is that bad for a kid in highschool anyway. he doesn't have a kid, and he doesn't have an ex wife.. so just ask your mom what is soo bad! ya know? <br>  <br>  good luck with everything, i love hearing stories like this :) lol
0c2758d4e43c957efa0ea4430af1f4afaa	Don't make it sound mean or anything.<br>  <br>  Juss say it nicely.<br>  Like for example.<br>  <br>  "So yeauuh, I know you like me. But I don't think I like you like that, you know? Yor kinda like a bro to me"<br>  <br>  Tell him he's like a brother so he doesn't really feel badd and stuff.<br>  You know what I'm sayinn?<br>  <br>  Good luckk(:
GEYRTKuqaa	lol yeah they were probably high..<br>  if that doesnt bother you, then i say go for him.<br>  <br>  people are probably going to tell you that he seems like a bad guy or something, but smoking is just something he does..not who he is.<br>  <br>  i say get to know him, then decide. <br>  go to the party and talk to him. <br>  if you need something to talk to him about, ask him about the coconuts lol|`|7XizbF6Caa	hella yah
cKDBwNITaa	it means like that the quality of the person compared to the quantity like size of the person. You know? i think thats what it means. i hope i helped.|`|iPxV5ELKaa	He means "Don't pick a big dick over a good man"<br>  But.. if he is obsessed with you and stalking you, he's not the good man.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	lmfao<br>  <br>  Ok hes saying dont pick getting laid all the time over a few good times XD
IW592N5Zaa	well hey theres always the chance that you'll be the one she doesn't turn down...take it|`|fmkwdNJyaa	try being a friend and move in slowly........if not on to the next|`|4P3G4y0Saa	The Simple steps<br>  Step 1<br>  Ask her friends what they like about her when she's not around<br>  Step 2<br>  meet her at a random time like you are lost ask her for help<br>  Step 3<br>  slowly become friends<br>  Step 4<br>  after a month of being bffs ask her if you want to eat with her NOT a date<br>  Step 5<br>  If she liked it ask her on a date on the date ask to be more than bffs<br>  Step 6<br>  Be really nice and do whatever you need to do<br>  REMEMBER:Asking her friends about what she likes is because you have something to talk about and do this all very SLOWLY if not bad things will happen. Follow these sources and be the best b/f|`|QhZUWx67aa	1st off, awwh! that's so cute, :)<br>  <br>  well i would just try introducing yourself or something,<br>  girls don't think thats a creeper thing to do, unless you're a weird kid.<br>  ha.<br>  <br>  don't like follow her around or facebook stalk her or anything, ahah.|`|N185NghYaa	Try to be friends with her first- don't flirt. Be yourself, and in a couple of months if you're pretty good friends with her ask her out.|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	Has she ever has a boyfriend before? Cus if she hasn't, maybe she doesn't feel ready for that yet. And you say she shows no interest in having a bf like most other girls do...for me that means either she genuinely isn't thinking about going out right now OR she is hiding it. <br>  <br>  I mean, I spent my whole time in high school making it clear I wasn't interested in guys and it wasn't my thing and I concentrated on my studies. But that was because I lack selfconfidence, and I didn't like myself so I believed noone would like me for who I was - and it made it hurt less that I told myself that, rather than find out people didn't actually like me. But then I went to Uni and I met someone who changed all of that and I'm happy as can be :-)<br>  <br>  With this girl, be persistent but not over the top - it will show her that you're interested and care about her and not just in it for one thing. Get to know her, start with small talk. Like hey, hows it goin? And keep eye contact, smile, make her laugh, you know..the usual. Maybe the guys she's been turning down have been like every other guy and she doesn't wanna be used. Her settling for nothing less than perfect - it could be her way of protecting herself.<br>  <br>  But let her get to know you first, dont rush anything, and if it happens, it will be worth the wait :-) Hope that helps Xx|`|NiOlegDyaa	Normally, I would say you should move on, but you said that you really like this girl so give it a shot. If you know anything about her, bring it up one day and have a conversation with her. If you see her at lunch, ask if you could sit down with her and her friends and get to know her. Then, just be yourself. If she can't accept you or like your for you, then I suggest to move on because there will be other girls, trust me.|`|uTmvALZeaa	Lol, that was pretty much my story, and now i have got a really goood relationship with her. The best way to get girls like that is to be FUNNY. If a girl wont laugh at what you tell her, you got nothin.|`|6LHYY2Bkaa	ask her out, if it dont work call her a *****|`|Mi4EebHlaa	Move on. not worth it|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Wow. I'm both amazed and a bit intimidated by her high expectations.<br>  <br>  I don't want to be a bearer of bad news, but since she shows no interest in having a boyfriend, as you mentioned, it's possible she just has no romantic interest in all guys right now, including you. I know you said you want to talk to her, because you REALLY like her, but if she's turned down 7 guys in the past month (did you count?), she's just going to turn down you as well.<br>  <br>  All I can say is for you to eventually move on to another girl to like. Giving up a crush is hard, but right now, she's just out of everyone's league. And she's not interested, plain and simple.<br>  <br>  And plus, if you did "get with her", her high expectations could possibly only wear you out in the end.
N7gOE1btaa	It might not be a matter of eating more, but rather eating more of the right foods.  If you have a high metabolism such as myself, I had to eat more protein and work out more, this way the weight will stay on your body.  Reduce your cardio and focus on some weight training.  Try doing weights 3 times each week for 15 minutes each time.  That should help you out.  Realistically, there is no other healthy way to gain weight but to add muscle.
ZbxcHDh2aa	Visit him when you get the chance He needs help ,he needs to  see an advisor or a doctor...|`|1I4TuZc7aa	go see that boy fast you can talk it out with em|`|1XtASkE1aa	u should go out to see him. just talk to him and see how he feels.|`|Nqda6ulSaa	tell him to talk to someone
CQUuCpTQaa	Sounds like he's got it bad for you, and it might not have anything to do with the dresses. If you like him, get to know him better but give him a little mystery.. make him want you :)|`|5AaMDz91aa	Yes, it does seem like he was hitting on you.  Maybe he just started to notice you and liked your personality. I doubt that it had to do with the change in outfits.  Get to know him better. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!
5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	usually this happens for a few reasons, one is their a scammer and may have got caught and removed from the site but a good scammer knows how to get back on with a different name, some also maybe talking or chatting with you as well as 4, 5, or 6 or more people as well as you, or they could be married or already in a relationship and got caught to name a few reasons. so don't take it personally and i suggest you having a cam and insist on whomever you chatt with has one as well or move on.|`|AA10743159	The biggest problem with free dating sites, is that anyone, can make up some fake identity, and just fool around. Maybe for some kind of ego boost, to see if he can attract some woman.<br>  Then once he thinks he has her, the game is over, and he moves on, to see if he can make another score. It's just a game to these men, and they care nothing about, that other persons feelings.<br>  Women invest more of themselves emotionally in these sites, and for the most part are serious about finding a partner.<br>  Whereas. many guys are doing it for some kind of kicks. The fact that the service is free, allows them to do so.<br>  I'd suggest, that you give up those kind of sites, and if you are searching for that special someone, then go to a professional paying site. Better yet, do it the old fashioned way, and get out there and meet someone, face to face.|`|L2t7Ek4paa	Well my girlfriends sister in law goes on dating websites all the time. Though she is married...She claims that it is a better place to meet "friends" then regular chat rooms. So who knows, your probably talking to married guys who once they realize your taking a real interest make for the hills to avoid the beat down from there wives.|`|ebwe0Duzaa	haha well i used to be one of the people that did that kinda stuff a long time ago lol...get on those things, make up a fake person, pretend to like someone, lead them on, being completely fake the whole time and then just stop talking to them...its actually pretty fun but i havnt done that in several years.  that could be it...they just messin with you for fun then get bored or something...or maybe they just lose interest?|`|qcGepiOJaa	dear! wake up it internet..peeople usually go online to killed time....and if they do searching for ..they search for unrealistic expectation such as hot looking body n etc.....i don't think anyway in date site are ever serious..cuz they know that no matter how serious they are....they just get hurts after so..y do so rite..so yup....don't believe what guy and girl's say online..cuz either they joking or even if they serious but they don't see whatever they looking for matching their expectation..they tend to avoid u so yeah..i guess that human reaction|`|LETd2hQwaa	I think its just a place they figure they can get laid.|`|Xv7CREwpaa	People want different things from dating sites ..

hcRGqk2gaa	Women are desperate to keep a man these days. They will do what it takes to keep what they think is good instead of opening their eyes and realizing the hole they've dug themselves into. <br>  <br>  I used to be with this guy. He was fun to hang around, made me laugh and made me feel special. But he didn't have a job, smoked and had a temper problem. He was also cheating on me. Other girl has a baby by him thats's 4 months older than the baby he had with me.  I used to take him everywhere, even to his other baby mama's house. Thinking he will change for me, he will get better, this baby mama stuff won't last........ I can't lose him because I have a baby and no man wants a girl with a baby..........<br>  <br>  I couldn't take it. The baby mama kept calling me and getting on my nerves. <br>  <br>  So I broke up. 8 months later, I find a man. he takes my daughter in like his own. I've been with him for 3 years and my daughter is about to turn 4. He got me a promise ring this past christmas and promised on the Bible that he will stay with me..... just give him the time. <br>  <br>  He cooks, he cleans he washes my car. We help each other. <br>  <br>  I want all the ladies out ther ethat thinks all good men are gone, to keep looking or look lost so that good man can find you.

( i assume you're in high school ?)  they don't really know how to interact with boys so they don't.  you should tell her you like her or ask for her phone number.  i wouldn't dismiss your friend because everybody tells your business when you're that age.  just next time you like somebody don't tell them.

OtKCAeQZaa	It is never good when some one say lets take a break. Understand the word  (Break) separate. Need my space, why would he need his space. There is more to it. He will not tell you the truth why, ask him. Tell him to be honest with you so that you can move on if he is not interested in you. He may have him self another girl. I have never know a guy to take a break in a relation. sorry
7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	It sounds like he's got financial and work stuff on his mind, and you are more concerned about not seeing him often enough.  He's tired of hearing you complain about something he can't really control, so he wants to take a break.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying he's perfect and it's all your fault.  But sometimes life intrudes into everyone's fun, and you have to face reality and deal with it.  I'm sure he's just as frustrated, but he's in a bind, and you're making him feel worse.<br>  <br>  Instead of complaining, why haven't you driven to see him?  Why don't you both meet somewhere halfway?<br>  <br>  It's the harping on him that has driven him to this.  He feels he can't give you what you want, and he's tired of hearing about it, so he's giving you an out so he can gather himself.<br>  <br>  Be more understanding, and maybe he will calm down.  And maybe a break is exactly what you both need, so you'll appreciate his efforts more, and he'll have time (and money) to see you more often.|`|AA11747856	He's lying.  It's about another girl.  You don't need a break if you're with the right person.  There's only one way this is heading and unfortunately it's not good.  <br>  <br>  Personally I think you should not waste anymore time with him.  Don't play his games.  If he doesn't want you, why do you want him?<br>  <br>  However, if you want to try to make it work and want to get back together with him, show him you're fine with the break, as in date other people and don't be available to him as much.  Make sure you stand up for yourself and don't just go along with his rules for the break.  Why does he get to dictate what it means?  You get a say too.  Good luck.
sBOZZ8Kpaa	Ummm, maybe thinking about physical contact or dirty talk!
CZ3LE4yhaa	That's a tough situation and if it were me I wouldn't really rely on any future to wither or not I would be this guy if I kept trying.

NmfEaN3Uaa	Well I have a story...and a possible other reason for asking out a girl you likes best friend...<br>  <br>  When I was a Junior in high school I met these two girls, they were both freshmanand I was a Junior. I had a class where they sat right behind me. Anyway they were both really cool and nice and very pretty. I was attracted to both of them but I had a real connection with the blonde one. And the blonde seemed to respond more to me and acted way more interested, which was great because she was the one I liked best. She even started waiting for me at my locker to walk her to class and stuff.<br>  Anyway... I am a really shy guy and have low self esteem. I can never tell if a girl really likes me and I doubted whether or not this blonde girl actually liked me the way I thought. The last day of school came and I built up my courage to ask her out. But in class that day I was listening in on her and her best friends conversation and they were talking very excitedly about some guy who called the girl I liked and apparently was acting like he liked her and yadda yadda... So I chickened out! I thought that was definitive proof I was wrong and she liked this other guy not me.<br>  So after class I asked the other girl...her best friend out instead! I was attracted to her best friend as well... Not as much as the blonde girl but I thought her friend was more likely to say yes because she didn't have any guys after her. Well....she said no. Ever since then the blonde girl I really liked stopped talking to me, waiting at my locker, and seemed distant whenever I tried to say hello. I blew it and ended up looking like an idiot. If there was really a chance there I lost it because I was a chicken.<br>  <br>  So a guy might ask out your best friend for lots of reasons. But most likely he is interested in her to...even if its not as much as he's interested in you. And guys are chickens...if we think there is a possbility a girl might say no they chicken out. And sometimes they do something stupid because of that fear lol.|`|itLS5Ualaa	no.|`|qQsuU6Psaa	i would do it if she was hot
x8loZIvEaa	if hes being naughty with another girl hes prolly just using u...but i could be wrong. i would act like ur not that interested maybe that will make him want u more (u always want what u cant have) just keep hanging and talking if u really like him otherwise move on and find a new guy|`|B4ix1WkLaa	Reading this made me sad...<br>  but it happens...well seems to me he might have something else going on with someone else. That might be the reason he doesnt want a relastionship.<br>   But if you can show him you can give more than what he has ever had he might leave all he has for you start a relationship with you...but dont waste all your time if with time he doesnt see what your giving think about moving on...|`|jOTN2MgMaa	hes treading the waters, sowing his wild oats.|`|2AAhiwgnaa	Hmm, sounds like this guy is a bit of a player. I would say that he is the type who is taking advantage of your naivety. You are going to have to make a hard choice here. Part all ways with this guy or give him an ultimatum. Tell him you want a relationship, just to test him, or that you will cut off all contact with him. If he freaks out and tries to get you then he really likes you. If he does anything else, then he was just using you.|`|dHPA390Qaa	I have to change what I was going to say.<br>  When we girls meet guys, it is necessary to find out their intentions.  We need to do this by the 3rd date.<br>  Yeah, you did that, and he gave you his answer.  The next thing a girl should do is compare that to her intentions.  If you both intend to meet someone for the same reasons then you are making progress towards what you want.

hcRGqk2gaa	I understand. My bf is like that too. I've kept it to a minimum sensual lip kiss. I try not to hint at any tongue at all. Then when I do feel comfortable taking it there, I do a little tongue and he follows. He's learned. You have to be patient. Try to make it sound funny.<br>  <br>  When my bf gets too excited and starts "slobbing" me down.... I back up, start laughing and be like "eeiiiwww..... ol wet kisses" and wipe it off. Give him that look like.. don't do that anymore.|`|jYi3eZkRaa	what always helps me id if i don't kiss my husband for a while ... like once a day or so and after a few days you will be dying to kiss him no matter what it is like and you will feel those same firework moments again...|`|srrTkpx3aa	hey! congradulations your realizing the after math of a relationship. Fireworks dont last forever! You can tell him I want to try something new.. Less tounge less slobery etc.<br>  <br>  Just make sure u dont do it rudely.

For a week dont kiss each other on the lips.  Everywhere but there.  DONT let each other make lip contact (though getting close is good)  After a week you both will be dieing for it.  :3
uGY1eopqaa	if you're not happy, end it while its early. you're young, you shouldn't tie yourself down. especially when you're switching to new schools and going into highschool. if you don't feel it, you shouldn't be with him.
fznvQptlaa	that is a pretty good indicator especially for a shy guy. r u more outgoing than he is? if so approach him first.. good luck|`|kV2uiCAAaa	Stop worrying about if he likes you or not, and just ask him if he wants to hang out sometime. Trust me, it will be a lot easier in the long run if you just go right out and ask him than opposed to sitting around wondering...Good luck!|`|xxStOZxHaa	if he just did it once or twice then it was unintentional|`|n9IHOYLuaa	No, that's just a sign that he's going to kill you and eat the flesh off your rotting corpse...

FVWvN07xaa	I know how you feel.. <br>  <br>  i been with someone 4 years, at the begininning it was great, all flirty, names, then it all dies out :( and you really miss it..<br>  all we do now is fight, and hes way too possesive..<br>  <br>  Tell him how you feel or things will never change, trust me.|`|hGWhzfFqaa	Take his advice. You're over thinking, calm down, don't call him pet names. Do what he does to you so he can see what's going on.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	Just because there's no pet name in texting anymore, doesn't mean there's no love. There's just no pet name.   ._.<br>  <br>  It could be that it got to eventually be tiring or sappy with all the cute little pet names. I agree with your boyfriend, there's nothing to overreact about. You can't expect it to last forever. Besides, there's more than one way to show your love.<br>  <br>  And when he texts I love you in a text, it's just "I love you". That's all.|`|0c33e49be2bc4408e403a81270512f44aa	Try to not have long conversations over text messages.<br>  Me and my boyfriend are trying this right now and I feel closer than ever.
7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	You really can't do more than maybe start touching him in "innocent" ways.<br>  <br>  If he just got out of a 4yr relationship, make sure he has a few months to clear his head.  That's a potential boatload of baggage he may bring to the next girl he dates.  Make sure his head is clear.|`|C4v09PPsaa	get his number, and start texting him.|`|GxSnVRAOaa	Sorry- don't date a coworker.  Even if it works for a while, or forever- it gets weird.  Jim and Pam are awesome, but it doesn't always work that way!|`|3eea6e5c934e4e0ecf0ffb555cd24622aa	Ask him to go out for coffee or a drink after work. The fact that you want to spend time with him outside of work will show that you are interested.
ZLSvS6eEaa	yeah, last year i found out this really pretty girl liked me, and that made me like her more. we r both popular, but shes just like really pretty. definitely ask him out, if you think he's worth it.|`|cw4eVQo2aa	I guess he'll like a popular pretty girl if he's in to superficial things.|`|ak0T96CQaa	If someone finds out that someone else likes them, it increases their chance of liking that person back. It does not gaurente anything though.|`|GqplhsAcaa	i think you should do what you think.....
aqGLKCxyaa	it sounds like she DOES NOT know what she wants. If you guys ate dinner, she was interested. But if shes not texting back, then just give her some space. <br>  she may be going though something. <br>  Try again :)|`|8w2FTmEiaa	I Think she could like you but i doubt it|`|epTHjXAnaa	i think she is more interested in the people who dont spend their free time on this website.
RKQHRMusaa	block her number <br>  if she does get into contact with you just ignore her. its only because of what you did, which perhaps wasnt the best thing to do but you know.. if you ignore her she'll get bored soon enough
a4Z2J9Eraa	don't say "lol", or anyother type of things like that--girls think it sounds gay on guys<br>  <br>  but seems like your doin fine, just keep up having conversations with her like this, and before you know it you might be hanging out:)<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|HdCo22Ggaa	you could A just ask her out lol or B get to know her more and ask her out or play it cool for a while and get to know her before you pop the question try real life talking as well =p|`|CzIaAnsraa	ha well u have to get lucky at a party wen ur all drunk and watnot|`|1hcupwT4aa	You don't.
mdV0oXATaa	Well for one, he was holding you in his lap AND he kissed you, he definitely likes you|`|hF6uZqWRaa	Seems like he likes you... and i love the whole kiss in the nose. i love it when i get a kiss in the cheek, nose or forehead than get a sloppy kiss with tongue...to me this seems more like an Innocent kiss.|`|dHPA390Qaa	He thinks you are cute.|`|1E6e2bsfaa	thats adorable....he thinks your cute and is probably a bit more respectful than some guys who would like just grope you=]
uP9M7Kzuaa	omg! same thing praticially happened to me!!!! i'm 11(well im younger than everyone else in my grade(sixth)) and tons of people at my skool told me that this hottie,"Cam"(look at my profile) liked me. I was totally physced that he liked me cuz i thought he was gorgeous and sweet and stuff. Well.....I ended up asking him out and he'd say yes but he had a gf. so i got totally POed and he told people and now somehow my WHOLE(praticially) skool thinks i like him. i dont. but......just ask him! i asked lots of people if they liked me and a trick to do if ur gonna ask him out is to write ZAP on ur hand and on the back wrtie his name and if he says no say all rite cuz it was a zap....lol! if he says yes then just dont show him ur hand and b happy with ur hot new BF. but.......the worse case sceanrio is that he'll not believe u about ur hand. but its not that bad. i came out fine. btw i like someone named will!!!!!!!! lol!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but just ask him. b all like hey will? just wondering but do u like me? blah blah blah. luck! : )<br>  <br>  srry its so long lol
DcrI9zmkaa	That's your nature.  If you aren't comfortable with it, *change* it.|`|4xAOZXwNaa	i think maybe because you like to try to chase after things you don't really think you can get and once you're able to get them then it isn't that much fun. If that makes sense?. And you're probably after the guys that are into themselves because they have confidence so there really outgoing and obviously if there into themselves then there usually those really hott guys lol. So yeah i get what you're saying and its totally normal  :)|`|Z8q4QqW5aa	you might find a guy cute or something along those lines because he's cocky. I used to be this way and it didn't work for me because the girls i liked thought i was be an idoit and i wasn't being myself. They were right so i stopped. The thing with u is that u might think there cool and what there doing is cool. Or maybe its that others like it so u go with the flow and kind of follow along. Once u see there personalities u might not be impressed. If u try for someone u might like u might be supprised at how much u have in common. Sometimes when u like someone and they like u back u might have so much in common its like your family in a way. hope this helps. :)
hcRGqk2gaa	UMMMM.. to that first person... pregnancy has nothing to do with a man maturing. My daughters father still hasn't matured. he's still out there doing whatever.<br>  <br>  Probably somewhere inbetween 25-30. Seriously. Me and my bf have been together since we were 21. He's become a lot more mature over the years. We turn 25 this  year. (our birthdays are 2 days apart) He's dressing differently, spending his money differently and everything. It also depends on how their life is. college guys will probably be like that until they find a woman they really like.. love... care for.. or whatever and they want to settle down.|`|jdah4ZA2aa	Some never do.  Lots of men in their 50's-60's only settle down because their bodies can't take it any more ... but that doesn't make them good partners. And lots of guys are teenagers, but somehow just know what they want and don't want to screw around trying to figure it out. Judge a man by his character, not his age.  That means you've got to wallow through the losers to get to the good guys.|`|Z8q4QqW5aa	You know honestly it depends on the type of guy. Some never do seem to calm down and when they can't get what they want they might do something stupid. They might mature when they finally realise what they've lost when someone dumps them. Otherwise it doesn't really matter about age just find the right guy for you based off your personalities and what you like to do and what he likes to do|`|GwEEEyNRaa	NEVER!  That's the nature of the beast (& I mean that literally)<br>  Good luck kid!|`|Vd0PEtdWaa	when they get a girl pregnant|`|hF6uZqWRaa	uumm never! lol... my mom says my dad didnt mature till he was 32...

r8VvBxM6aa	This sounds exactly like my situation. I literally feel like my heart is a yo yo with him. The only thing I can tell you is try to focus your energy that you put into this relationship on something positive and beneficial. I know it's still going to take some time for me to get over him because I've been with him almost 2 years, and it's like right when I'm making progress to move on, he comes back and tells me all those things and then 3 days later he's back to normal. A few days ago I realized I couldn't let someone treat me like this. I've always been strong, smart, and independent-so I turned my negative into a positive by starting an advice column for girls on youtube. It's therepeutic and I feel like I'm doing something good for the community. You can check it out if you want, and hopefully it helps you too! Good luck!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ThatBrownGirl890" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/ThatBrownGir...</a>|`|SB7QOe1Baa	If he's treating you this way, yet telling you he loves you, it's only because he knows it's what you wanna hear.  How could he love you if he doesn't even like you anymore??  Doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  Has he ever done anything to make you doubt trusting him?  Has he ever lied, cheated, etc etc??  If not, then all you can do is believe in him, and your relationship together.....have faith in him.<br>  <br>  But in this case, if he doesn't like you anymore, then there's most likely no love there, either.

So i guess if you think he is more important than your friendship than go for it, but if she is saying nasty stuff than maybe your friendship isnt worth it.|`|uajxQyEVaa	I would talk to your friend about the situation.

d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	Why did you decide to put your relationship on hold? <br>  That just seems crazy to me. If you're having problems or doubts in the relationship how is not talking to the other person suppposed to fix anything? <br>  Look, if you're not sure about how you feel about this guy, end it. It's not fair to leave him hanging on just because you can't make up your mind or because you've got other stuff going on. Your boyfriend is supposed to be the one to help you get through the hard stuff.<br>  It's not fair to just tell him to wait around until you get yourself together - let him go and give him the chance to find someone who really wants to be with him - and hey, once you've got yourself sorted out and if he's still single maybe you can get to know each other again. But it's really not fair to just put your relationship on hold and leave him in limbo wondering if he's about to get dumped.|`|0f5a3301ad7a4b142336064ee9173f5aaa	yes you should be.  you should focus your attention elsewhere.  he's playing with you.|`|WbKBHh8Haa	move on. he is not in control
xoXkHOVsaa	IT could be a yeast infection.  There are over the counter treatments you can buy at the drug store.<br>  <br>  If it gets worse, you will need to see a doctor.  It is possible that your boyfriend lied to you.  I hope it's nothing serious!|`|jdah4ZA2aa	It's a distinct possibility.  You can also get vaginal infections from bad reactions to the condom, lube, your bath wash or detergent even ...<br>  <br>  dr. is really the only place to get it figured out.|`|Gorf5EgYaa	It sounds like a yeast infection. Perhaps go to your doctor. You don't have to mention that you had sex but perhaps just tell him/ her whats happening down there. Cause you don't wanna take the chance. But it does sounds like a yeast infection and you can just get something from the drug store for it|`|QhT9MjEoaa	Its likely to be bacterial vaginosis. Not a big deal. You go to your OB/GYN and they will perscribe you antibiotics for it.  You should go right away. It could be anything, but seeing as you both are virgins it could just be bacterial vaginosis. Good luck!|`|37a9c69fb548b8661c2959b8b388a149aa	you better go c   doc most probably yeast infection|`|PzboDDI2aa	some body's lieng|`|jUO9OTw2aa	I don't know what your reason may be for not going to the doctor ,but I strongly suggest that you go as soon as possible.  the symptoms that you are describing sound like you may need to see a gynecologists  ...further delay will only make you worry, and if there is a problem you can receive treatment preventing a potential small problem from becoming a huge medical problem  the doctor is the best answer for your question,procrastinating is not advisable.by the way you can not get a s.t.d. from a virgin.
4gZqi3f9aa	Basically..<br>  Mix light kisses with french kisses. Most kisses should only involve your lips. Since the guy is usually taller, his top lip will just fall above yours and they will lock. Make sure you actually kiss with your lips pursed sometimes or whatever because it's fun to get that kissing sound haha. When you do use your tongue, move it around a lot and don't always do the same thing.<br>  There's other small things that you can do too.. You can push your lips really hard into his and push against him and see if he pushes back. Kisses can also be made on your other's cheeks and neck and hands and forehead. And while you're kissing, you can also rub your noses together that's a cute thing that we do.<br>  As far as hand placement, hold the back of his head or his back or his face<br>  It all sounds confusing, but if you just go with it then it's really easy to be an amazing kisser. Have fun with it haha|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	knowing what your doing|`|Wdv2hUDaaa	Tie a knot in the stem with your Tongue!!?? That sounds a lil insane|`|f280030b5c3fd08f70ea29f8d59505d5aa	i think its natural, you can practice! and alsooooo yeah passion like that guy said! loll, also, take a cherry see if you can tie a knot in the stem(: if you can your a good kisser<br>  ?|`|FvDPhJ5Daa	practice... practice... practice|`|PDwlIrtsaa	harder kisses|`|51706a8c5bc2c9b3a3906eb353a8a2acaa	practice <br>  and the passion|`|poZRKtQvaa	If you really feel strongly about a person, every kiss is a good kiss.  Its about your feelings.  If you worry too much about how "good" of a kisser you are, you'll sabotage yourself because you'll just get nervous.|`|5O8TJ1fraa	How much you like the other person.<br>  Unless they really are just a bad kisser, because my boyfriend, who I like a lot, is a pretty bad kisser (I am trying to teach him)  <br>  I guess you just have to be confident :)|`|DUr8KP94aa	Technique, emotional connection, chemistry, and experience|`|yWtmf0yiaa	experience...popularity, sluttiness.<br>  <br>  or to normal people passion and deep love.|`|CaqdDzQZaa	it all about how you feel about the person that makes them a good kisser or not|`|V4IF2XYWaa	probably experience.<br>  or just practicing , :p|`|9MZcwppMaa	Practice.|`|46WGsk1oaa	well... it's mainly the passion of the kiss and if u really like them. my girlfriend taught me how to kiss lol. .my old way was kinda pathetic. just stuck my tongue in there and hope she liked it lol. just when u kiss. slow down and enjoy it. dont go too fast. its really hard to explain. but i think u got the point. good luck and i hoped i helped a little.|`|lJPIRp5Oaa	Emotion and practice with the same person.|`|IhED5vaAaa	passion<br>  excitement<br>  noises<br>  tongue|`|i0a7CWLWaa	passion
ZNhP3mpUaa	What? how can you be dumped twice? I think it's only possible once unless you got back together... this question is confusing. why is he mad? why did he break up with you? why didn't you answer his messages?
1UiYpUWiaa	hes probably freaked out!<br>  you better off just asking him out then going through all this games, just act cool and don't make a big deal of it, tell him that your inserted but don't lose power, your both on a equal playing field and you need to bring that attitude when you talk with him, act like if he says no it's no big deal.
qRvEFP9Jaa	YES!!!!??|`|9AqB6iPsaa	Idk?  Best answer please!

YW1oVUW8aa	First off girls mature faster than boys so girls want someone on there maturity level. It depends on your age, If you are 15 and she is 20 that is odd and it wont last long. but if you are 20 and she is 25 then there is a big difference, you are further from being a kid and more like a adult. I would say the older you are the less it matters, as long as she is legal. I have a 21 year old girlfriend and I am 34 going on 35 and we have been together for 3 years and it has been fine. There are drawbacks, you most likely wont mix well with her friends because they just wont be able to relate to you and will be to closed minded due to lack of experience. Around your friends she will feel like the baby all the time and when you and your friends talk about things she might not be able to relate to she will feel left out. But it takes work and you have to talk all the time, communication is key. Don't let other people judge you and her on your age if you are happy and she makes you happy who cares.|`|YfFFzOw1aa	well people in my class have been out with year 11 guys (15-16) and i am in year 9 (13-14) so i don't really think a few years age gap matters as long as the boy is older, i know it sounds really sexist but its true girls mature more quickly than guys|`|inzOTV1Raa	My husband is 8 years elder to me!!!!! I am 24 & he is 32 :)
uSDb8fBpaa	19 and if i loved/really liked the girl id be honored to be her first.<br>  <br>  clear things up|`|uMs6kTY5aa	Don't worry about it. I'm a 16 year old guy. I don't care if girls kiss me or not. If it happens it happens. Just make sure you don't kiss some jerk. Make sure you kiss the guy you like and you can tell he likes you. Looks is something but not everything. Hope this helped! :D|`|yiNzBH8Iaa	Well, when you get a boyfriend, discuss when you will feel comfortable kissing that person and don't feel pressured to have to kiss him immediately.|`|fGs6DLoraa	Ok, I know I'm not a guy but I'm 14 too and I've had two or three boyfriends. But don't worry, it's totally not unnatural to not have one at our age.
dWlp4fOLaa	tell the kids this: big deal? i'm freakin fat! it doesn't bother me! i'll eat myself to death if i wanted to!|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Do what your psychiatrist suggests; they know you pretty well so honor their opinion; if they say you should go, then go.<br>  <br>  It's not really all that important to become popular; you have 1 friend, so I would take the time to nurture that friendship and let it develop into something. And it only matters what you say about yourself; don't let what other kids say get you down; say good things to yourself until it sinks in. <br>  <br>  Take care
G33JkhLBaa	i have 3 Girl best friends. Denise is AMAZING. Olivia is AWESOME. Ugh Alexis is horrible she had sex with the love of my life while i was sleeping & while he was drunk!

KHHPH3fqaa	I think this is fine...... you put the ball in her court.... now just see what happens.....  and yes, go back in next week.... if you see her smile and wave... and just leave it at that....you havent done anything wrong, you gave her flowers and you gave her your number..... both were nice gestures.  If she has a boyfriend she is probably trying to figure out what to say to you..... if she doesnt have anyone, then she is trying to figure out if she should give it a try.... we never know what goes on in others lives... people have all sorts of things going on that we dont know about... she could have her dead sisters kids living with here.. she could be taking care of a sick parent... she could have recently lost her own husband or boyfriend to an illness... we just dont know things about people... and we tend to take rejection as outright and personal not thinking there could be all sorts of things going on in ones life.<br>  <br>  So, having said all this... continue going to your bank... act normal and just let things happen natural.  You spend far too much time worrying you know.  I have  been answering your questions since the girl you were into went on vacation and never got in touch with you when she got back...  I got booted off of here for offending some religious person so I had to start over.... it sucks after getting over 4000 points ..... but here I am... starting over... a new name and ID..... that just the way life goes... you fall down, pick yourself back up and move on... in anything.<br>  <br>  good luck with this and please dont worry so much.... be cool|`|YOxw7rIKaa	I think that you should continue going to the bank, even if she is interested or not...... if she is interested she will call or maybe she is shy and nervous, you never know................ anyway that was nice of you to do that, i think you should continue to go in the bank everyday with a smile on your face don't let her see your a little upset about the situation..... keep being the sweet person you are.|`|5P3nPwLYaa	of course not u were brave n thr should b more guys like that guys expect girls 2 do tat always so steroty-ish  go 4 her if u like her she mite like u bck dont let her slip out of ur hands keep goin 2 the bank tlk 2 her get 2 noe her ask her out 2 coffee hve a blast if u like her tke it to the next level dont speed up let her go <br>  2 her pase<br>  <br>  hope it works out|`|bSHhWXfPaa	mmmhmm i see, well from my point of view, a guy giving a girl flowers with a card is smackin' cuttee. :) trust me, i know it, im a girl. ANDD i dont think you screw up at all about giving her your number boy. NO, you shouldnt give up hope, never give upp! D:< theres always a chance, and nothing is impossible ya know. IF you go back to the bank, don't be nervous, at like yourself, and ask her if she was busy over the days? cuhs if seh was, maybe she didnt have time to call you. Or sometimes ppl misplace them or didnt see it. Ask her out, say, "hey are you busy today?" if she says no, then ask her if she wants to hang, maybe go to the beach or a fancy resturant. or you can ask, "Do you have any free time today or tomorrow?" if so, "wanna go hang with me, _____ <- name of place. well, good luck!|`|mvSFD8LNaa	Keep going to the bank and if she shows interest, then maybe she's nervous.<br>  If she ignores you, then maybe you should just move on. <br>  You did the right thing but giving her your number:)<br>  Don't worry:)<br>  You're a sweet guy, and you deserve the best:)
FP5MsZ7iaa	He should respect your 'secret garden'. Personally I hate when someone opens my bag or my email before asking permission. I try to resist myself to this kind unhealthy curiosity.... unless there is OBVIOUSLY something that smells fishy.|`|AA11747856	I don't think you should make it up to him.  He violated your trust by going through something private.  That should be the issue here.  If he's so insecure, then it won't last anyway.  Tell him flat out what you said here...that you're upset that he did that, that he has no reason not to trust you and that you love him and want to be with him.  If he's still having issues, tell him it's not going to work out.|`|0LXVSFEGaa	Stop asking for relationship advice on Yahoo Answers. Honestly, it's not the most reliable source of information. Go outside; think for yourself.|`|zr5WwMwVaa	just tell him straight up<br>  <br>  shoe him that you are happy to be with him and happy not to be with your first love<br>  <br>  guys like it when their girlfriends are sweet to them<br>  <br>  so maybe cook him his favorite meal and let him relax and maybe go somewhere that he wants to go to or let him hang out with his friends with out you calling him <br>  <br>  be extra affectionate like kiss him more with passion and hug him extra tight just show him that you love him.....
YWdNTZU3aa	yes because i feel that the girl doesn't acknowledge my opinions about her body or believe me when i say she looks good|`|Ym9Er1fUaa	If she keeps complaining about her body in front of you and stuff then yes. And if she tells her friends that they are so pretty and they say the same thing back but she says "ummm no im not, im ugly, your the pretty one" etc. Stuff like that. Then yes, you gotta be confident and think you look good all the time. If you complain about yourself though, then it is definitely a turn off.|`|FzFSzilmaa	listening to her whine about it is a turn off...<br>  <br>  all women as self-conscious of their bodies - too fat, too thin, too many stretchmarks, too much cellulite...<br>  <br>  not what you wanna hear before sex... so NO SEX!!! :(|`|gYuJUyvvaa	If she's like "OMG I broke a nail!" then yes, but nothing wrong with caring about your appearance.

MYflBn4laa	Hey Darlin',<br>  <br>  You just haven't met the right woman yet! You can never have too much affection. Especially today. Most women today are more materialistic and they don't value the old fashion ways of dating, getting to know a person for the character that they possess, how they treat a women and not for the money. I would love to know that a man loves me and shows it in many different ways besides material things. Like long walks holding hands, cuddling watching a movie, calling to say I love in the middle of my hectic day at work... and the list goes on and on!! <br>  <br>  In closing,<br>  <br>  DON'T Change!! There's someone out there who would love to have  you and appreciate your affection. She's probably on the way now!!|`|kNJBwpgNaa	It's not wrong - my husband is very affectionate as well, that is your love language. May I recommend a book to you? It's called, "The Five Love Languages". It is important to know yours, as well as recognize the love language of the girl you are in a relationship with - that way, you can know when to give her some space, or how to "speak her language", so to speak! Good luck! (Website for the book below)|`|2RAvyY0naa	Its ok and natural. Find someone accepting or it may be seen as a weakness.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Look for someone willing to share that affection. That shouldn't be too hard since us ladies find a guy "with a soft spot" attractive for the most part.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	You have to match your affection with what the girl is comfortable with doing.  If you're moving too fast or doing it publically when she doesn't like that, then you'll only push her away.|`|tMUBBDASaa	no man nothings wrong with you im the same way and my fiance loves that<br>   about me|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Being affectionate and coming off as being needy are two different things. You should be nice while dating but save that affectionate stuff for a woman you may consider marrying. Otherwise, you will just come off looking needy and clingy. It's a delicate balance. This is not a flaw. It's very common in families. You aren't alone and now you have to strike the right balance so you don't seem desperate. And by that I mean the kind of guy you go on two dates with and he's already talking of marriage and how he's in love. Too much too soon.|`|zFqJpKrraa	in a way, yes, being too affectionate will be a turnoff to some girls because i suppose they will think you're clingy after a while|`|jdah4ZA2aa	No, it is not wrong. Just realize that women may have issues from growing up too.  Not all of us are comfortable being affectionate just because we're women.   All of us, men and women, are similar when it comes to having to work through our issues, big or small, from our past (childhood and previous relationships).  The key is to be honest with your partner about your needs and desires.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	Well you haven't found the right girl all girls aren't the same some girls don't like a lot of affection and some does you just have to find the right girl|`|BYQ2kHPjaa	No, not at all. Besides women love it when a guy is really affectionate, and don't worry you will find the right woman eventually.|`|VA3tGarQaa	Aw, no. You know I love you really. :-)
1fB2UdRHaa	Horrible idea...
Czp44Zwlaa	Just go along with it and see what happens somthing good might come out of it wether ur gay or not|`|eg5BNdaXaa	You should figure out if your gay first and if you think you are then just go for it whats the worst that could happen
cn3kR8HKaa	It is true, most guys don't like to cry in public and/or in front of your friends ... so most of the time you just save it for when you're alone ... or just get drunk, that way you open up to the people and lose fear of being seen crying.|`|1fB2UdRHaa	Personally, I don't cry, some guys do cry and feel ashamed to admit so. Depends on the person.<br>  <br>  When a person doesn't cry, it doesn't mean they don't have emotions or that they're stronger than other people, it just means that crying isn't their reaction to events and emotions.
FMwckpMbaa	The attention is what makes you like him more.<br>  When you don't get that, you feel like you've nothing to work for.<br>  <br>  You're acting in those ways to make him try to get you all the more, but he'll give up eventually.<br>  <br>  I think you should stop playing games with him, and if you like him- just show it.
4cdwde4kaa	Depends on what kind of guy he is..... <br>  <br>  Because I like a guy that sort of goes with ANYTHING and if I wanted to I could just go up and hug him (I NEVER talk to him) and he'd be like...Ummm okay>? And be curious as to why I did that. He wouldn't be upset AT ALL though. So if you like someone like that, it should be mildly easy.<br>  <br>  If you have a guy that's pretty hard to talk to (Like my friend did) just wait for a special occasion to talk to him. Such as an up-coming book report (or project/etc.) and as you go into a class you have with him be like, "Hey So-and-So, What are you doing for your Book report/project/etc?". It's a very casual way to at least talk to him :) My friend just waited until the friday before winter break and asked the guy out on a candy cane (Hahah it's differerent, I know) because it was Christmas time. <br>  <br>  ALSO-No matter what kind of  guy you like, you could always "tell" your teacher who you like. That way when the next seating chart comes around you'll sit right next to them and that makes it VERY easy to tlak to them :) Thats what I did and it worked AMAZING.<br>  <br>  Hahahahaha well sorry this is long!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  -B|`|5hMxDDeUaa	Well,<br>  Maybe you could add him on myspace or something like that?<br>  I know for sure its easier talking online. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't have that, or if you don't,<br>  Then just try sending him a text saying,  Hey, how was your day?<br>  It won't freak him out or anything, and all you have to do is write the text and hit the send button. :)<br>  <br>  After that, a conversation might start off and it might be easier to talk to him in person? :)<br>  <br>  sorry if I never helped.  :(|`|dPzoUnAaaa	For me to help you you have to talk to him. If you dont talk to him how is he gonna like you. Talk to him in the hall way or something. Don't worry he probally thinks your cute but he has the same stomach bugs as you. Just Go talk to him. HE LIKES YOU I KNOW IT!!|`|d1tyTq6Saa	tell 1 of ur friends to talk to him and get information from him. If he likes you, ask him out. Try flirttin a little|`|Mr9McLtiaa	Talk to his friend,  ask him to give the guy ur #, or just simply ask him to help u out ie- initiate conversation by calling u over in the hallway and subtly introducing u2 by engaging u 3 in conversation then if possible the friend could slide it home with a, "she such a hot little cutie!" (idk u get my point)<br>  <br>  Its stupid but when someone else says "hey don't u think that guy is cute too"  it makes him even cuter then before somehow.|`|sSJDzxCnaa	WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAA<br>  You cry your self to sleep at night!?!<br>  That's depressing.<br>  Have you ever asked a friend of yours to go talk to him for you or have him or her say you look cute together? <br>  And I know you don't want to hear this, BUT you will have to talk to him at some point. Say your on a date after a friend hooks you up. Are you gonna just stare at him?|`|VhODTzyuaa	I wouldn't have specific advice. But I can say I had the exect same thing going for this total cutie in school. I couldn't go up to him, even though I was planning on it. I told my friends and they wanted me to go with them and go up to him, but I was way too shy. I hate being shy when It comes to a person the I'd die to talk to. Thing is, it got too long that I couldn't have the guts to go up to him and I found someone else. I still look at him at school, although I still am afraid to go up to him. I did have the guts go talk to the someone else that came into my life cause it was over the comeputer. I'm so lame. I just hope to get over this shyness. Hopefully you can too.|`|mZ9suLgXaa	wow, first you need to chill. crying because you dont have him? first you need to get to know him, get a mutual friend, its way easier to talk to someone when you have a bridge. i know how you feel, i lost a girl like this, i was too shy to talk to her and it couldnt work. you really need to build up confidence. there is no trick or secret thats going to make this easier, you just need to work up to it.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	go kiss him.
DcrI9zmkaa	He's doing it because he isn't comfortable with the physical contact.  If you truly care about him, you'll stop pushing and let *him* show *you* when he's ready for that kind of contact.|`|AA10743159	It sounds to me as if this guy is totally Gay.  Most guys love physical contact with a girl and let's be honest, holding hands, isn't in any way sexual.<br>  If he isn't gay, he has some other deeper issues to contend with.<br>  This relationship, if you ask me, will be strictly platonic.So if you are in it just for his mind, that's all you are going to get. Sorry.|`|S0K6OqGJaa	Well first off how old are you? And have you ever talked to him about his stance on sex before marriage or how late or early in the relationship he would be ready for it? It just seems that he is distancing his self BC he doesn't want to get close and make a mustace. Or not exactly a mistake but make a commitment he's not ready for. You bbeef to talk it over with him to clear things IP
5P3nPwLYaa	don't get your hopes up it could be that since ur friends he feels comfortable to Talk 2 u about it <br>  (advice: it wasn't meant to be ull meet the 1 eventually)<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  he may like you but nvr notice since he had a gf now he wants 2 c if u would b up for it don't b 2 eager cause ull seem desperate but not ''i don't mind'' attitude cause ull loose him<br>  (advice: act normal ask him questions like why comfort him)<br>  <br>  wwhatever happens happens itll b k|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	He wants to see your reaction so that he could see if it was okay if he can ask you out.|`|CbRr3upaaa	he was probly just horny
JWNzoksmaa	$1550 is a bit much for "pay for her"  I would say no...you'll most likely never see the money and do a contract with girlfriend is very tacky.  Even if you do do a contract...she's 17 what are you going to do...take her to court. She doesn't have a full time job or anything.  You see what i'm saying.  <br>  <br>  Listen, i had a really good guy friend of mine loan me $4000 before.  We wrote up a contract, but i was 27 at the time with a full-time job.  And that took me like almost 3 years to pay him back with monthly payments.  It didn't drive a wedge between our friendship b/c we were mature enough to understand the concept of money.  <br>  <br>  At 17, i understood that money didn't grow on trees, but i didn't quite understand the concept of it...like how hard it was to actually earn $1550.  Get what i'm saying.  Hell, i'm 30 now and $1550 is a lot of money for me.  if your gf cannot afford it then i would let it be...don't offer to pay..mark my words..it will drive a wedge between you and her...resentment will build on your part..and you'll never see the money. If she can't afford it now..she's not going to be able to afford it anytime soon.|`|55kHefG1aa	well, if she really wants to go then help her out.  have fun but then be sure that she will pay you back cuz thats a lot of money... but since you said that you guys been friends for 2 years then i dont think she would just not pay you back.<br>  do it and have fun..and yeah do some kind of contract just in case..|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Man, be careful with this.  Talk to her about it, see where her comfort level is.  If you need to put it in writing, there's nothing wrong with that.  Talk it out with her and get everything on the table BEFORE you give her that chunk of money.|`|WcYRd9DLaa	chris, i would come up with a 4th of her expense and to me at your age thats alot.  contract at your age uhh, dont know.    if she cannot afford to go, her problem     good luck|`|k6qxIPJBaa	0o0 thts a lot of money and just because shes ur gf dosnt mean shell pay u bak i wudnt do it. after the trip u guys mite get in a fite and ull never c her again, but u just paid for her to go on vacation.<br>  things can snowball very easly <br>  but i wud say no. and if u really "love" her then stay home with her and do fun things with her tht dnt cost 1550 dollars|`|VDjaypqpaa	Sure it's okay to pay for her as long as there is an understanding that she will pay you back. Getting it in writing is probably a good idea.|`|RwRCwJXMaa	Well first of all think realistically here, Does she have a job or any means of income to pay you back? If not then there's your answer. If she does then do you think she is a reliable person? And yes I would make a contract with her this is a large amount of money. And I hope you haven't told her u are considering paying for her cuz if you turn her down she's goona b real angry. Don't mention it unless you are sure you're going to pay.|`|KBkTDOZUaa	Money changes people. I wouldn't advise it, it could make her feel like you have a certain power over her or something. I don't know, it's an extremely Noble thought but if I were your girlfriend I would probably say no.
x0J8S5sWaa	I don't know about freaky, but she would know you weren't just calling to say hi. Because come on, you wouldn't be calling to just say hi. You want something...a date perhaps? Someone to talk to? A friend? A hookup? She'll assume you want a hookup so even if your "intentions are pure" she'll think the worst. Sorry man, but just thought I'd warn you. If you are really interested in her and still want to call her, actually ask her out but don't beat around the bush. Even if she says no, she'll appreciate your honesty.<br>  <br>  By the way, just because she isn't interested in starting a relationship doesn't automatically mean she finds you unattractive. Most girls, atleast the ones I know, aren't that shallow. Goodluck!|`|vgWtWmXxaa	Yeah. That's weird. If it's been a while and you just call out of the blue, that's ridiculous. After the call I'd be like "Why the heck did that guy just call me right now?" Lol.|`|d513b0591e73a6dffbeecf0a7bd16137aa	of course not, love:) Every girl likes a guy that will call her out of the blue just to see how she's doing:)<br>  <br>  <3 Aurora|`|Lm0yy1xdaa	no not at all if you were just wondering how she was doing but if you were trying to "get at her" then yea|`|G23PtaZRaa	If this happened to me(if I was in the girls position)and i had said I wasn't interested then I probably would have meant it. If you're just looking for friendship to see what she really thinks of you then I don't see why it would be freaky, but if you're calling to say hey I think you're hot then I suggest no. Good luck|`|dARgbG8Saa	no that is sweet text her at least 5 times a week before calling her cuz she will think you want to hook up with her and them call so she will not think any thing is suspicious unless you do want to go out with her but any ways that is sweet after talking for a few weeks ask her out again she most likly will go back out with you|`|IhED5vaAaa	Yes you weirdo<br>  She obviously isn't interested|`|645a2cf910f6951ef5034b4f5d304b87aa	no it wont be freaky cause you are just calling to see how shes doing.|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	yeah thats really creepy<br>  text her, that would be better|`|oWTXPtxwaa	Yeah it wouldd, text her or somethingg, like before you make the call or somethingg.
IyDqnZYjaa	I would go for an introduction just to get a feel of the person they're trying to set me up with. If I don't get a good enough vibe to date them, I'd break the news to the girl first then proceed to tell my parents just out of respect for them trying to hook me up. <br>  <br>  Or, I would not go through with it altogether and tell my parents "thank you, but no thank you, I'd rather find my own dates"|`|P9oP8CS9aa	Freak the hell out, they have been dead for over 15 years.
fQaNnV95aa	Mostly girls look down on you and if you do something funny they scowl and think your stupid.<br>  <br>  Are you popular?

They have deep issues in their head they prob envy you and they way you are. There is no excuse but they just feel insecure so they take it out on you. Don't worry about it, it does boil down to jealousy just concentrate on they friends you do have rather than silly bitchy girls with nothing else better to do with their time. If they are nasty again just agree and laugh it off best way|`|bJPRwCgNaa	Well, some signs are dirty looks , they often look over to you or comment on your clothing. They interrupt your conversations or start talking nasty things behind your back. They do not have any friends and you have a bunch and if they do have friends they have 1 or 2 people who are as cruel as her and are her ''followers". They wish they were you so therefor think that by doing this rude behaviors upon you that they will beat you down so speaking. Hope I helped!|`|XFsPr7OYaa	By the sound of it Yes they are jealous of you, i don't no how you can tell if someone is jealous of you, but they are possible jealous because they want to be like you.|`|VIsrlL6Kaa	by giving you dirty looks, talk **** about you behind your back, there are haters all around

QNhNQyIraa	This so called "friend" may be jealous of you, and wanted to find some dirt on you basically. Seeing as a woman's purse is a good indicator of how she lives her life. The fact that she is making you sound like a total b**ch to your friends, continues to make me think she has some jealousy problems for you. The thing is, if you let this go on that means she will know your weakness and continue to do this. I don't think you should be friends with somebody that makes you feel bad about yourself. True friends are suppose to be there, and when they are joking around with you, they shouldn't make you feel horrible about it. The only thing is, if she doesn't do this all the time to you, maybe you should reconsider and be her friend still. But if this is reoccurring, that I wouldn't recommend continuing your two's friendship.|`|0cf6NiMIaa	Wait a minute, when this happened I wasn't laughing!  I think that was when I was zoning out...  I even clarified I was zoning out on our way to the car.  I thought you said it was better now?  Then again, this question must've been posted a couple of days ago...
vmMaWOFvaa	she sounds like she likes you. You guys seem like you have a lot in common. Since you said you are having a bbq ask if she would like to come. That will be a cool way to be hang out with her. Or maybe when she is working at Subway go in when she is working and surprise her. Hope everything works out for the best. M A M E R S <3
5jMNBO2naa	why do you say it's too late?<br>  you are your own worst enemy<br>  you have control of who comes into your life<br>  and adopting a negative outlook only pushes people away<br>  you need to have a life before you meet anyone<br>  as a person with a life is a person people want to meet<br>  not someone who is down on themself|`|yjyBbVJoaa	this is not an answer but I hope it helps you not to feel so alone. www.lulu.com  look up the book "Global warning" by various dudes. Its a free download of a project I have run with teenagers. Enjoy! and let me know your thoughts. :)|`|YTYjzGAXaa	Well this might take some balls on your part, but go up to a table at lunch and be like can I eat with you guys? But only do that if you are somewhat outgoing and can talk with people. If they say no be like Naw thats chill, I'll just sit somewhere else. idk lol, that must be tough, I knew what it felt like|`|h3rN7snkaa	Well you might try a weird approach, but be really polite to girls. Like....you know open doors, just act like a total gentlemen and you'll catch the girls attention. Then if the guys see you hanging with all these girls they might try to hang out with you too. <br>  But the years almost over, and I'm sure you'll develop friends over the next 3 years. Good luck.|`|JPkgKCNtaa	aside from sports and clubs. You really should just go to lunch and ask a table if you can sit with them. A table that looks like kids that you would normally like to be friends with. There are some nice people, and it might be scary at first but its nothign to stress about! you will find friends.
xXnFx6qLaa	Nah, I like to reconnect w/old friends.|`|kGO4ZhtQaa	i guess thats what happens when u have a baby in ur teens<br>  <br>  but dont worry too much, im guessing u have new freinds now, and u cud still always get in touch with ur old freinds and maybe arrange to meet up?|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Not for me it gave me a second chance to really reconnect with some of the kids I graduated with and catch up with friends I hadnt seen in months or yrs. Now we talk just about everyday about something even if its just to vent to one another.<br>  <br>   I wasnt close with any of the kids I graduated with but if you where I can understand how you feel as I have one GF from HS I wish we had stayed close but her situation made it very difficult so it kinda just fizzled out and left.|`|FzFSzilmaa	don't worry about it... i only have 12 friends on facebook... 2 from work, and the rest are family and from a martial arts club i belong to...<br>  <br>  never be ashamed of your life.. if you are happy with the choices you made in life...|`|B4kf9jDGaa	it's not fb that's make you a loser, it's your friends, who didn't keep in contact with you. if it's that bad, either get rid of fb or find friends nearby who will talk to you on fb....I know wha tyou mean|`|33e18371c231caed609d57632064134caa	so contact them now. what is the problem?|`|YYdtd47baa	You can call them. I bet they don't think your a loser. They're all grown-ups now, they know what family, kids, and all that is like. Just be an adult and call some of your old friends, I bet they would like to talk to you too. Maybe they have kids. Don't feel bad, most people don't make every "right" decision, but once in a while you feel really happy in your life, and without making all the decisions you once made, you wouldn't be there at all. Everything plays out right in the end, in some way. If this is your problem - then it's a small one, just call them up. They liked you once, they'll like you again. <br>  Izy|`|aUosbTqqaa	Sometimes. Why didn't you use some protection? Being father at this age si not very good. You'll always be the one who will have to look others make out with other girls and winning them and you will have to stay with one till the rest of your life. Bad.
Q0P8QNm3aa	YES<br>  <br>  I don't know why girls don't do it more often<br>  <br>  It's sexy for girls to do anything like that, and unless you told him you're really interested, it's a great way to tell him<br>  <br>  Guy's are so different, he won't reject a kiss <br>  <br>  <br>  I'm shy, but I usually make the first move|`|ACVKajUIaa	i think any guy wud, i wud anyway lol|`|6t1CClfQaa	go ahead and make the first move it really dont matter...... if u like him it would be cool yo some guys r shy|`|qJK4alwQaa	yeah. it has happened and it kinda eased my nerves so go ahead and go for it|`|6FIhIQ3Eaa	i wud happily oblige|`|7HYJG7q9aa	i wouldnt mind it if she was attractive enough but i dont hold high standards so ya haha|`|iqShn0UIaa	I guess it all depends. Some guys are shy and don't want to put themselves out there. I don't think guy would honestly object to a girl making the first move if his feelings for her were true. It would be different if the girl was ready to as someone out. It is often perceived as the male's job to ask a girl out, but making the first move is all about chemistry, if you feel it, go for it.|`|6Tj70Xv5aa	If we weren't already together? Well assuming we at least know each other, It wouldn't entirely freak me out. I don't really freak out at anything but it would definitely be interesting. <br>  <br>  Bonus if I liked her back too.

If you guys are meant for each other, he will come back.<br>  <br>  Love will find a way... <br>  <br>  Let a dog roam, and he'll find his way home...|`|ebwe0Duzaa	okay that is really confusing!  the dude cant make up his f'ing mind...or maybe he has a mental disorder?  thats not right for him to keep being on and off on you like that...that crap would really mess with my head...okay you should just move on, still be friends, but dont wait for him to make up his mind or get things straight, just move on, and maybe with time he will get his head straight and you two will end up together again.  but for now it seems like hes up and down, indecisive, and you shouldnt really have to be putting up with that, so live your life and dont worry about getting with someone else and hurting his feelings, because if he really loved you and wanted to be with you he wouldnt have any doubts, and he wouldnt be trying to make up his mind or anything like that and he would be with you right now.  if it was real love, he would be with you and none of this would be happening.  so tell him that until he for real makes up his mind and everything, you have to move on because you cant keep being led on for nothing...just give it time and let him think i guess...theres no telling what his problem is...but i think you need to move on, at least for now.|`|gmefdkZsaa	tell him that your hurt by how he has been acting lately<br>  <br>  that way he knows how you feel and will think about what he is doing<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!<br>  good luck <br>  -?|`|AA10126871	It seems ridiculous that you guys broke up in the first place if you were still close to each other, and very affectionate.  I think he's probably afraid of commitment or something.<br>  <br>  He definitely needs to figure himself out.  If he was still being so affectionate to you after the break up, instead of just being cold, as you said, then I would've downright told him off.  I would've told him to stop doing this to you and playing with you and how he needs to step off and figure out if he wants to be your boyfriend or not.  Then again, he could just be getting used to the changes... but I still would've told him to step off.<br>  <br>  He was probably cold that day because he was just down on the breakup still, or was stressed out about something else, it could've not been you.<br>  <br>  If he stopped being affectionate, and just friendly, then maybe he realized that you two are broken up and he just wants to be friends now.<br>  <br>  As the Katy Perry, "Hot n Cold" song goes, I think that could be his theme song.<br>  <br>  Tell him to figure everything out, and that you will be there waiting if he wants to get back together and if he just wants to be friends!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NaqTinu7aa	yea i think maybe the best thing for it is just to walk away huni, obviously there is something major going on that he is not willing to share with you. and for some reason he does not want you to be involved in it what ever it is, i think you have done really well with your msg's actually and you have managed to keep yourself at a calm cool.<br>  its really hard to understand from an outsiders point of view, and im guessing perhaps he is pushing you away because he really is finding this as hard as you or he doesn't want you anymore hard as that might be for you, there is no feeling in the world i don't think that's even close to pining for a lost lover. and the confusion must be eating away at you.<br>  <br>  i think for your peace of mind you are prob best to walk away, keep your head up and think of things in "your own" future. try not to reply (hard as it is) to his texts unless they are important ones, like you said about his laptop etc and just focus on your education.<br>  <br>  i really cant think why he would of changed so strangely in such a short time, but then idon'tt understand what goes on in my own damn relationships lol!<br>  i wish you the best of luck whatever it may be that happens, :) x|`|gHMKprWIaa	i think he is messing you around and you should stay clear till he sorts his head out to be honest if he is willing to mess you around like that he is not worth it. Any guy that acts like that is a waste of your time.|`|nMfeehmuaa	he needs to figure himself out.<br>  if he trys to talk to you, just be like figure yourself out before you talk to me, i don't need this.<br>  if he wants to be a jerk, then just leave it.<br>  seriously, you'll find someone else.|`|uP9M7Kzuaa	he thinks u dont luv him anymore so hes hurt. tell him u still care and age difference doesnt matter 2 u and u'll wait until hes ready to take you back. luck! : )

jdah4ZA2aa	there is no trick or gimmick to it.  you've just got to be yourself and genuinely interested in her to have a girl fall in love with you.  if you lie, she won't be in love with the real you.  <br>  <br>  things that make me fall for a guy:<br>  him being gentle natured, such as helping an old person or animal.  not wanting to fight.<br>  <br>  being insightful <br>  <br>  being able to carry on intelligent conversations<br>  <br>  making me laugh genuinely
K9Bcqloqaa	Ask him if he would like to company you to a movie, or lunch together.  Start small so the two of you will feel at ease.|`|2svVoj42aa	yeah i would make the next move like mabey start small on a double date to teh movies and stuff like that then you can be like want to go her and there.

1TSMdgG1aa	Don't rush it. Talk to him like you would a friend, this way you can get to know him a bit better.  He obviously likes you (and knows you like him too) so he's going to be happy to talk.  <br>  <br>  Just remember not to rush it.|`|dNiAfNi3aa	that sounded like me back in the day..<br>  well i ususally wait for the girl to do something<br>  u should get his number and call him at a convenient time.. his confidence is way high when he is not pressured by anyone or just public in general.. he probably gets super shy too when you and him are face to face... <br>  <br>  like i said a phone call is probably the best solution|`|pnSB2wzCaa	HE IS SHY SO, SAY TO HIM WHAT HE CANT SAY TO YOU LOL <br>  WE ARE IN A NEW ERA SO DONT FEEL SHY OF BEING THE FIRST TO APPROACH.<br>  <br>  AND REMEMBER MAN HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW WE THINK, ITS OUR JOB TO LET THEM KNOW..THEY MIGHT BURN SOME CELLS TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT LOL
RnQFwIuUaa	Guys get nervous too, so help him out. Ask him if he has a face book account, if you can text him a funny video or make it a point to greet him every morning. If he is shy, he doesn't want to make a move and be rejected, so give him body language clues that let him know that you want him to come over and talk.|`|37usvEbraa	just go up to him and sya hi start a casual conversation as long as your confident in yourself and happy and positive even if he doesnt really like you ( which im sure he does like u cuz he was happy when u told him) hell think your a great person just by your confidence and positivity, :)
anMIgfRKaa	You've gotta seek help for them no matter what.

Unfortunately you don't really give enough information for me to be any more specific.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The sort of information I'm talking about is more along the lines of what sort of guy you are looking for and where you are looking for them. It appears to me that you're simply hounding the wrong crowd. <br>  You also don't mention anything about your approach, how you talk too them or what sort of relationship you're looking for.<br>  Some guys are quite perceptive and can tell if a girl is looking for something more serious than they are.<br>  <br>  EDIT2: Fixed stupid spelling errors.|`|ME5oMRJdaa	you might need to show that you are interested a little more, cuz sometimes guys are clueless, so just make sure you are sending out the right signals, put some blush and lipgloss on, wear a good perfume and you're good to go!

I went to the same university as a girl I'd known all through high school but i got along really well with my new roommate and my high school friend got really into the "why are you closer to her you've known me longer" game. it was so lame. <br>  <br>  Let your friend throw her little fit, don't humor her. Getting upset over something small like this is stupid and she has to grow out of this behavior or she's going to lose a lot of friends throughout her life.

If he doesn't want you guys to get back together, there's nothing you can do about that. Don't take dating too seriously. If he can prove to you that he still cares and is sorry, then give him another chance (if YOU want to, that is). Otherwise, don't dwell on it. There are plenty of great guys out there, no reason to obsess over one of them. Try just being friends with him.|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	I'd stay away from him.

If your ex-boyfriend loved you and wanted to continue to maintain a relationship with you, he wouldn't leave you for another woman! Honestly, you're going to have to let him go and move on with your life because you deserve better! Yes, it's going to be difficult for you to accept it, but hopefully, this experience will be a lesson learned; you don't need to put up with his nonsense. Besides, you will find someone that loves you for yourself. Good luck!|`|Aqm5Y0JZaa	try more hard
9PKyOE1Gaa	Maybe she's got friend problems, trouble at home/family stuff, or theres just something up with her. But I don't think you should get your mate to ask - deffo no no!<br>  <br>  When its just the two of you hanging out, sit her down and ask if she's ok. If she says she's fine...tell her you've been worrying about her but don't know whats wrong or what to do. I mean, you could always ask 'Is it something to do with me? Family stuff? Friends? Personal?' and the chances are...if you mention somehting that she reacts to differently or maybe snaps at you saying shes fine...the chances are thats the problem!<br>  <br>  Also, don't force her to speak, let her know that its ok if she doesnt want to tell you, or if she doesnt wanna talk about it that its ok....just let her know that you'll be there if she ever needs to talk. And hug her and be nice and stuff of course! <br>  <br>  Although, if you're not too keen on approaching her and speaking like that...you could always email her, or send her a text or a letter and stuff.

9mom4fm0aa	just start the conversation... take the first step... may be the horizons broaden up.. life becomes easy... do not complicate things as is... because what is happening is predetermined but then there are choices.. evolve yourselves to be a better person .. may be and sure you will find your true soul mate.. don't keep the ice in your heart let it thaw and see the beauty in life... everything will turn out well.. all the best|`|XlhBBZPxaa	easy when you see her again just say hey chick whats up? and leave it ast that|`|AA11622926	Just walk up to her and apologize. Tell her you've just had a lot on your mind lately and you're so sorry for ignoring her and ask her if you can be friends again.|`|2ZfFJyWVaa	Just tell her how you feel.  Be truthful and honest.  Don't try to break them up.  Just be friends and then hang out with her..just you and her as friends (not her bf) Don't make any moves... just show her ways you can be better for her then him.|`|0tL4zgTPaa	just go up to her and talk to her........clear it out

jN16kWlWaa	In my opinion it sounds like he likes you, maybe he's starting to regret not doing something about it last year and letting the moment slip, or maybe he's finally starting to realize what he has in front of him, past the friendship part. Or maybe he's messing with you, who knows, if you guys are good friends then he'll talk about it with you soon or something. He might be really scared though because he let a chance pass him by, or he might just be at a desperate lonely stage and he feels like he needs someone right now and you just happen to be there. many possibilities..<br>  <br>  :)|`|AA12269189	Aww you guys sound so cute(:<br>  It sounds like he likes you but you really never know if he is messing with you.<br>  If he likes you he'll end up talking about it with you sooner or later.<br>  What do you realllllly think about it?
CaqdDzQZaa	she is playing mind games with you aren't they fun|`|2G8lOPN8aa	It sounds like she just might not be into you... it's one thing to be shy...but if a guy you likes is making the effort to talk to you.. you definitely don't walk away when he approaches you--even if you are lost for the right thing to say.<br>  <br>  I think you've invested some feelings in this girl because you felt maybe there was some potential between you... but in your attempts to get to know her a little better... I think you found that she is not all that you thought she was cracked up to be.  It sounds like the conversation was lacking and that was disappointing to you.<br>  <br>  I realize that you are shy...but it sounds like you are putting in the effort here.  If she can't at least meet you halfway--it sounds like she's not worth the trouble you are taking.<br>  <br>  I know it might seem easier for you to set your sights on a girl that is shy like you...because you feel like maybe you will be comfortable with someone that is also shy... but sometimes that's not the way to go.  You might do better with a more outgoing self-confident girl who can hold up her end of the bargain and perhaps help you come out of your shell as well.  Sometimes opposites attract.  (Sometimes not).<br>  <br>  I don't think she is interested in you... if she were she would be more engaged in your conversation, no matter how shy she was.  The fact that she just walked away makes me think she doesn't return your interest.<br>  <br>  It's not you, it's her.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	She doesn`t want you to talk to her, and might even consider you a pest - and at worst a bit of a stalker.<br>  <br>  She might not want a relationship with anyone, so stop crowding her space. She certainly has shown no sign of encouraging you  - just the opposite.|`|PYK3FzbHaa	keep smiling at her<br>  it works<br>  just keep smiling at her and eventually she WILL smile back!|`|LVDV6PjKaa	Just Ask her if she would like to hang out some time...|`|gKY5bIbhaa	i dont even no how to ran 10 points|`|VK9K4bwFaa	it could be that she isn't sure if you actually like her because you dont talk much when you're with her (i know you said thats because youre shy, i'm the same)<br>  <br>  i think you should try your best to get siome sort of a concvo going next time you see her, and say something like 'you're so pretty' or something like that so that she knows you like her<br>  <br>  :)|`|nZjdi0wKaa	ask her what's wrong or start the con like this "WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH ME" things like that, change, and then happily after ever <br>  in summary ask her what's wrong and ask her if you can change, (since she is so shy that i don't think she can change whatever like that)|`|6x2cRz7naa	i myself am i shy girl, so i think i know shes probably thinking.  even if i really like someone i rarely talk to them first, so just because she doesnt initiate convo with you, doesnt mean she doesnt like you.  and she probably saw you and noticed that you had stopped talkign to her so she was probably confused! if it was me i would have freaked out on the inside wondering if i messed something up at the library, and i would think you didnt like me anymore. so if you are serious about liking her, TALK TO HER.  but thigsn dont work out every time between people, so dont worry about it if nothing happens.|`|C4iBfcGZaa	If she's really as shy as you say she is, she probably took your not walking with her to the library as usual as being avoidant, so she probably thinks you're annoyed with her or something. Trust me, I've had a lot of shy friends, they take certain actions really strangely. Just try to keep talking with her [don't worry about having to start every conversation, she probably just doesn't know what to say], be nice and respectful, but make sure that you're making it clear that you like her and want to spend time with her. <br>  If you do all that, she'll get comfortable with things in time, and if it's right maybe you two will really hit it off.<br>  As for yourself, though, feel out the situation; if you start feeling like you don't think it'll work out or have changed your mind, make sure you don't hurt her in the process of backing out of the situation. <br>  If you get the feeling that she actually doesn't like you, then play it cool and back away.|`|M6kFBTXhaa	well as a shy girl myself.. I would say maybe you should keep putting in the effort to hang out in the library, but next time ask her to hang out! Don't let her walk all over you or anything, but if you like her your definately not losing anything by asking her to hang out and showing her you like her. If she keeps ignoring you or not talking, then give up, unless you think she is worth the try... then keep on trying!<br>  Persistance works|`|SAbhEwA8aa	Alright, first thing I would say is that you're over-analyzing a bit. I've found that the best way to handle relationships is just to go with the flow, just take things as they come.<br>  <br>  You can't force a girl to like you, and if you try to hard, its really not going to do anything for your chances.<br>  <br>  It would be helpful for you to be more confident. Most girls like the guy to be a "leader", per se, in the relationship, so by being passive, you might be giving her the same impression she's giving you.<br>  <br>  Overall, I would just advise you to loosen up a bit. Make her come after you, and if she doesn't, then she's not really an option.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
GDiH3dUJaa	Jump into the conversation when they leave you out, and if they ignore you, then tell them to listen to what you have to say. And pull up another chair at the lunch table, unless it's those weird cafeteria tables where all the chairs are connected. And you don't necessarily have to find a new best friend, just find someone else to talk to whenever you feel left out. And eventually the two girls will notice and hopefully want you to join them again.
JWNzoksmaa	tell her you're flattered that she likes you "likes you" , but you're straight.  You want to be friends, b/c you value her friendship and like her very much as person...just not in a girl friend / boyfriend sort of way.|`|40XzqkRyaa	wow. thats odd. i'd be really scared. Just dont invite her to sleep over ne more. And if you have gym class with her... go to the other side of the locker room.|`|AA11761605	This isn't a real problem.  Just let her know the truth about how you feel.  Real friends are honest with each other.  This way you will not mislead her into thinking that something can happen between you two.|`|BYWDIhuLaa	I would talk to her about it bcuz rite now she needs support but tell her rite away you dont like her like that!!!|`|bttrB0Rfaa	talk to her|`|rzvTnrwbaa	wow back off|`|pNKCKccZaa	be yourself. do what is in your heart|`|fQ881MwBaa	ill take care of that problem. just tell her about my dong.|`|AhD82AKAaa	You know who she is. I agree to be still frnds with her for humanity and symphathy but you can't possible bo with her. Unless, yeah. You need to be brave and tell her that you can be possibly be with her and tell her the true reason but also tell her that you will be frnds with her whatsoever so go and tell her!<br>  <br>  P.S This is a really strange situation! Talk to your parents.|`|KiWJxGYtaa	I had the same thing happen to me! She was my best friend 4 many many years, I found out she was a lez and that she liked me so i just told her that i didn't wanna date her becuz i wanted us to be friend 4 the rest of our liefs, if she is a real friend she will understand. <br>  <br>  Its like when you date a guy you stay with 1 for about a year or so, then another guy 4 about 8 months.. you most the time are never friends with them after you dump him or w.e <br>  if you want her as a friend let her know that, but tell her ur in to MEN..|`|t0magGXQaa	Tell her you are straight and wanna be friends with her if your lesbian then tell her you dont feel the same way about her.|`|io7ppQLuaa	you guys can still be friends but dont get TOO close as friends|`|JfzGFo7aaa	bang her out dude live lifeee cheaaaa|`|JxTPXYr2aa	um date her if yo bi|`|w2si6gFMaa	just talk to her let her know how you feel|`|QvhPJAKyaa	well its pretty simple. if you dont feel the same, you just have to say..<br>  im not into girls. otherwise she may come onto you.. =/|`|7EiWSuPLaa	just be good friends with her depressed people always find the worst thing that could happen and dwell on it . see your doctor if you are serious about being depressed.you could be in a serious situation|`|AA12271834	It is not the end of the world that someone who is a homosexual (or at least a bisexual) is hitting on you.  Just tell her that your straight but not narrow.  You can still be friends but she won't hit on you anymore (it is the same as asking a guy out and he tells you that he is gay, that kinda kills it right there).|`|NIHXUmN1aa	The difference between a straight girl and a lezzie is 6 beers...lol...so I'd suggest you both sit down and drink heavily and after about beer 6 discuss your issue...lol, she'll have you on the bed in 10 seconds...good luck girl|`|gRZT4pnUaa	One of my friends is gay and jokes around with me a lot. Makes me uncomfortable. I would let her know that you aren't gay and that you don't feel that way about her.|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	Be honest with her if you are not into other girls.  If she is a good friend she will understand and lay off.
GxSnVRAOaa	He doesn't want you to have an abortion, because he doesn't want to lose the baby.  I can't tell you how he feels about you- but obviously he doesn't want you to abort the baby, because it's his. If he feels you are carrying his baby, then he has a right to be upset when you tell him you are getting your third abortion...as the father he may not have a legal say in the matter- but that also must be heartbreaking.  I don't blame him for saying you don't care if you keep the baby, since you are able to abort so easily and talk about it so candidly with him.  The baby is his as well as yours and I think you should listen and value his opinion.|`|cLad8HuLaa	I THINK DAT HE DUS STILL HAVE FEELINS 4 U CUZ IF HE DINT THEN HE WUDNT CARE.
ruczpWrGaa	Neither, ill take the nice guy who is actually talking to me.  he might be cute and know how to dance or neither but he has a personality.
pipuVV8daa	You guys are going to prom together.<br>  You like him, he likes you.<br>  He's single, you're single.<br>  Whats the problem?<br>  Just go for it, and have a blast at prom.|`|jJiMSuHBaa	I hear the vagina is real popular this year|`|FnvYkF2Gaa	David Lee Roth once said, I dont get the girls i want, I get the girls that want me|`|Vv7a31pmaa	go after girls.|`|51U5iKyHaa	Just listen to you heart!
FZKFLTyLaa	It would seem he has at least a slight infatuation  with you.|`|zHK46nw7aa	i would say a definite yes, because of the fact that he openly said that he sees you as a possibility , that is a huge sign, most guys are not that open, and for him to stand up and defend you , like that is a good sign because that means he cares about you , and i showing some " territorial instinct" even though you are no t a piece of property it is usual for a guy to act that way.<br>  well i would say make some more small talk and just go with the flow he is defiantly in to you .<br>  good luck<br>  ps. also for the last question i answer for you , well im sorry that things didn't progress,  i think that maybe your friend ,  thought of you as a crush, but then probably realized that you would just be friends,  and thats why he is talking to his ex, but watch out he may become somewhat desperate and then comeback and try to start something up with you again, <br>  :)
fLLysVK6aa	yeah, why not. im 16 and i love porn. its great lol|`|hF6uZqWRaa	its good. I like to watch porn. It might be crazy but i just started masturbating at age 20 lol.

xoXkHOVsaa	Don't obsess about it.  He's not your boyfriend anymore so he doesn't have to get back to you right away.  He'll reply when he gets a chance.
yb01tlviaa	uhh maybe because it took you an hour to respond, he doesnt know you didnt hear our phone beep. if i sent my ex a text and didnt get a reply until an hour later i would think you didnt wanna talk.|`|OoLBqLhKaa	he might just be busy. working? homework? or maybe, like you, he didnt hear his phone go off. if you want send him another text like, "sry it took a while to txt u back, i never heard my phone" but i wouldnt sweat it, im sure it just cause hes doing something,|`|lcRbG4Csaa	Maybe his phones on silent, chill out or you will look like a stalker.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Just leave it!|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	You want to text him every 5 mins ? give the man a break you have split up after all maybe he is getting on with his life. You should do the same - perhaps he didn't hear his phone beep ....|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Oh, calm down and stop working yourself up over nothing. He'll get back to you eventually. And by the way, you broke up. Last Wednesday, right?
Wcxm2dTgaa	Whatever you do, don't text him again. Don't panic, he's probably trying to mess with your head and see if you really 'care' by keep contacting him. Just act cool about it, and don't let it bother you if he texts or not. Or at least don't let him see you care.<br>  <br>  If you broke up for a good reason, maybe no contact is the answer.|`|oxLUr8b7aa	Don't worry maybe a phone broke or something... just see if u can talk to him in person or something and try to find out what happened?|`|FoWxxqTjaa	yikes calm down! he might be busy...think of how you didn't hear your phone beep.<br>  <br>  but at the same time i know how you feel, sometimes us girls make everything so dramatic...just breathe. he'll text ya back eventually. get your mind on something else and you'l forget all about it. works for me :)
yAQJlblpaa	she sounds like one of those friends who likes to copy you just to keep you as a friend.She probably feels that if she doesn't cut herself you will think she is weird and drop her. She must have low self esteem because she seems to be craving attention.

Intimacy doesn't have to mean sex, but kissing, holding, petting and the like helps keep them strong.<br>  <br>  In a LDR, you don't have that aspect.  You can't see each other's face when you talk unless you are camming, and even that isn't what you really need.<br>  <br>  You need together time.  You need to see how compatible you are when you are together for many hours on end, or days on end.  You can't do that in a LDR.<br>  <br>  Don't kid yourself.  While it can work, the success rates are awful.
2SKy9UxFaa	I think you should look elsewhere, forget about these two guys and go out and meet some new people get to know them as friends and someone you like rather than assuming straight away there could be a relationship, don't jump into things to quickly, especially not on face book etc.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	don't trust either of them since you don't even know anything about them except what they want you to know.

v0QtYEGHaa	Don't try to kiss her, she may not be ready.  Also, maybe you should just hang out with each other more and get to know each other. Or you could say that there's an awesome film out, and ask her if she wants to go.  All you can do is try. If she does knock you back don't take it personally as there could be a variety of reasons (e.g. it's nothing to do with you personally).  Good luck!|`|2RlgLspsaa	just be like whatever her name is will you be my girlfriend|`|1c9eb8a31186d1da1e78962f5c60e263aa	just stike up a conversation,firstly make a comment about her hair or something she's wearing to get the flow going .Find out what she likes doing or interested in and go from there,be confident but not cocky ,she can only say no fella.|`|g0OM43Z3aa	nooo dont just kiss her <br>  first of all she will kill u if she doesnt like you back <br>  and if she does than its different but what if she doesnt
PVFRP0Ztaa	Wow, sounds like you're Mr. Right.<br>  Well, ok, if you feel strongly about him, you should really gather up the nerve to tell him exactly how you feel. Why would you feel like a fool? He should feel so happy and excited that someone has these strong feelings for him. I know it must feel overwhelming for you to have to make the first move, but trust me, a lot of guys find that attractive.|`|6xFOQ5Ngaa	SERIOUSLY. if hes this amazing, you should go for it. what do you have to lose?? risk it! cause good things might happen :]]]|`|TiRhwBFAaa	MAKE IT!

sMXLAukcaa	Well did you really expect to just move on from yr first?  The way I see it, you have 3 options:<br>  <br>  1.) You could start talking to her again and see if she's going through the same thing or if she'd like to get back together with you.<br>  <br>  2.) You could suck it up and try to move on.  Actually TRY to date other people.<br>  <br>  3.) You could suffer and hold onto her memory forever.
ec2b1a1c9534c53c26c3b18b2f00d42aaa	Tay (your nick name remind me of my X btw :) ), well SEX is not everything in relationship, especially before marriage. But I understand your point and it's going to be a battle between you and GOD. <br>  <br>  Be careful, once you got into this SEX relationship thing, you might have a hard time to NOT DOING IT, that means if you somehow go out with another GUY, you will wanna DOING IT also. Then the next question would be : how many guys you will go out with until you get marriage ? <br>  <br>  My advice, try to hold it, I know it's hard....been there, done that, but in the end you will feel like "I accomplish something" <br>  <br>  Good luck Tay :)|`|ebwe0Duzaa	whenever you wait for sex it tests the guy to see if he can handle being with you without doing it...it can show that the guy really loves you for you, not just the things you do, as in sex.  i waited for a year and several weeks to do it with my bf and i wish i had waited longer honestly because now he wants it all the time...once youve done it it kinda soils the relationship because the nice sweet conversations and cuddling goes out the window alot more often...before we did it our relationship was perfect, and now i often feel used :(...i think your relationship is stronger if you wait and if the guy cant wait then that shows that your with the wrong person and need to move on...NEVER feel pressured.|`|T6hPiwhfaa	In many cases, it's not planned and just happens.  So you just have to make sure you have protection.  I say that because it sounds like you are ready to do it at anytime.  Make sure you got condoms for STDs and get on some kind of birth control.  Go to planned parenthood.  If you can do that without feeling embarrassed, then by all means go do it.  don't do it for god or for a relationship.  Do it because it's pleasurable and for you.  But be responsible.  We do not need anymore Octo-moms out there.|`|OauZKhKVaa	I didn't wait, and I'm in a loving, happy relationship.

It gets better after that!|`|gmefdkZsaa	wel having sex is natural, and if you LOVE this guy and you know he loves you and isnt in it for the sex, then maybe you should go the next step with him,|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Depends on the guy, some won't wait.  The ones that will wait probably are not that attractive.<br>  <br>  So you have to be careful with your choices.|`|Vhfb7UACaa	God doesn't care when you have sex, but you might want to wait until you know it's right.  Also, wait til you're over 18.|`|SRteXuP3aa	Yes, how old are you anyhow?<br>  <br>  Try to get your mind off of sex by watching tv or other stuff...|`|nmyO0Zviaa	Depends if you can live past it and not have nightmares or cold sweats about it. I don't think it would make it worse or better, it is part of human nature instincts to react to what the human instincts feels and desires to the attracted other. <br>  Ask yourself this: Is it Lust you feel to the attracted other or Is it Love you feel to the attracted other? <br>  <br>  Lust&Love are two different thing...<br>  <br>  Lust:  one attracts you and you lust after them for their looks or whatever and the pheromones connects unlocking the sexual human instincts(a craving)<br>  Love: Not a craving but really deep emotional states for oneself and especially the other. With or without sex these emotions are strong loving unconditionally, and feelings are complex releasing strong complex physical and emotional instincts unknown to individual(s).|`|Q2DjI1YJaa	Deciding to have sex is a big move.It's very emotional and you could be hurt by not making the right decision.Take your time do what your heart tells you never do anything to please anyone else,specially if you feel it goes against how you feel or what you believe in.Trust me when it happens you will be able to do it whenever you want as long as you feel its with the right person and the right reasons.So many guys expect girls to put out,don't be part of the crowd stand out from the crowd regardless of what anyone says.You have to be very careful these days as well.And you don't want to make a name for yourself or have guys think your easy,because guys are cruel and most of the time that's all they want,they don't care about your feelings about sex or the fact you want to wait.So like I said do what you feel is right for you,and if you do decide to go ahead be safe and make sure the guy has respect for you and is considerate of your feelings and body and protects himself as well as you.|`|8oWXYJj3aa	It all depends on who you are in a relationship with, and if you yourself decide to have sex.  I waited, not until I was married but until I was in a serious relationship with someone who appreciated me and all the other stuff I have to offer.  I think that helped our relationship because neither one of us is second guessing the decision we made, and that there was no pressure to have sex.|`|EZiEb2YAaa	Wait for as long as you can hold yourself back.. and go ahead if it feels like the right time for you. but don't jump into doing it all the time because your partner could take advantage of it and it could lose it's specialness.|`|BxTAfd2baa	Yes,definitely.  Every contraceptive has a failure rate and the repercussions could be massive.  Think, could you really support a child right now?  Besides, you could also catch an STD, and that would be bad.  Believe me, waiting is much better than not waiting.  If your urge is really that bad, learn to masturbate.|`|XGR9OzNhaa	A: Religion. Personally, I don't believe until waiting until marraige but, whatever floats your boat.<br>  B: If you let hormones take over you, you'll lose control.<br>  C: It depends on the guy, you have to wait and see how much he is in love with you before you go all the way. Sex IS amazing, just do it with someone you trust.|`|soFzO7C2aa	talk about it with your partner and tell him what your intentions are, find out what his are and come to some happy medium. that's what my roommate did and they have sex but very rarely because she's very religious. they find other ways to be intimate.|`|u3CEObEMaa	yes u should wait because  that boy maybe only looking for sex and no relationship.also think about the consequences that come with sex. u should be mature when u do  it|`|yJd1H8C9aa	dont wait too long, but you dont wana do it right off the bat. wait till you are with a guy for a couple months like 3.|`|30xRk9EUaa	waiting does make it stronger but play around a little to keep it interesting|`|VaqwgaMmaa	Depends on ur age.<br>  Yeah, sex do spice-up a relationship a little.|`|m3ZvsSZUaa	if sex is the only thing that<br>  will make ur relationship not boring<br>  then i dont think u should be dating that<br>  someone|`|9MXf5r6Maa	depends how old you are, but it sure helps to know if the two of you will have chemistry or not!|`|i4DRfoboaa	how old are you|`|V4NaOAS1aa	its the 21 century<br>  who waits til marriage to f**k?<br>  get out and bang girl u dont know what ur missing|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Sex does not make a relationship stronger. If you are having sex for this purpose, then the relationship probably isn't going to last. It almost definitely will change a relationship, but sometimes it isn't for the best.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yes... waiting till your married is the best policy !!|`|VSVQHKwKaa	The evidence is everywhere....if you want a strong marriage, you've got to wait.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are exceptions...but there is a reason for the meteoric rise in premarital sex and the rise in divorce today. <br>  <br>  Having sex sets you up for potential pregnancy, potential STD's, and potential heartbreak...all of which are damaging to future marriage prospects.<br>  <br>  One two people have sex, all the motivation to get married leaves the picture (especially from the man's point of view). What you have to do is focus on the relationship.<br>  <br>  Once the sex thing is pushed aside, you can objectively look at this boy you're involved with, his skills, his strengths, his vices and his weaknesses.<br>  <br>  What you're feeling right now is the euphoria of the relationship. Your body is chemically drugging you to have copulation and reproduction (the body's drive to reproduce is notorious for suspending otherwise sound judgment). <br>  <br>  Get through this difficult phase, and you'll be able to concretely judge this situation. <br>  <br>  Or, if you prefer, you can judge it after you've slept with him a hundred times, and he's no longer inclined to burden himself with a formal marriage (having demoted you, accurately, from "lady" to "easy"). <br>  <br>  Sorry to be brunt, but that's the truth of it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck! Be Strong!|`|AN9PdKmgaa	sex is not what makes the relationship good it does add greatly to a relationship and closeness but its much better to have sex when you really have a bond with someone you want to spend your life with. If you need sex to stop a relationship from being boring then you are in the wrong relationship. Don't get me wrong it is great and does add to a relationship but should come when you are4 ready in other ways then just sexually|`|ruczpWrGaa	Sounds like you have a lot of mixed emotions on the subject and maybe a little outside pressure.  You know your not ready.  So wait.  Waiting can make a relationship very strong.  It lets you know your relationship isn't based on sex.   It all too often can be. Go with your first Instinct and wait.  And whatever boy has you thinking about sex that much, chances are he wont live up to your expectations.  That's just life.   Its better to wait.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Waiting is absolutely the best thing to do. I realized that the hard way. Don't have sex with someone just so you can say you have. After you guys break up you will feel horrible and it's not an easy thing to get over. Put your heart first...

hCJzZ5rnaa	If you're unsure, then you may not be ready, and you will end up regretting it. Believe me, this is not just a remorseful feeling, it is quite torturous in the way that you know deep down that you lost something so valuable, that you can't ever get back. Your virginity.<br>  <br>  You only value it when it's gone, and if you don't lose it to someone special. Then you lose it and feel a horrible wave of melancholy. It isn't nice.

You have a right to be upset, but understand that he probably honestly forgot.  I have been through this with SOOO many men.  It's not that they don't care, they're just not *with it* when it comes to stuff like that, unless we're constantly reminding them.  I would set him up, and have a friend "accidently" bring it up to him, and I'll bet you that he'll respond, and quick!

Cologne is okay but a lot of guys spray way too much that you just want to tell them it does not excuse you from taking a shower lol . Other things would just be that they are athletic, not to big even if it is all muscle, eyes always catch my attention and color doesnt really matter to me, and for sleeping with someone I would have to be dating them for months before|`|3KAiV9zTaa	Ok.

The first thing i notice about him ALWAYS is how nicely he dresses for me all the time. Even at school. He's clean cut and always wears his clothes neatly. And his eyes are very pretty. They turn a hazel color in the sunlight or light brown. <br>  <br>  I am kinda attracted to smart guys. looks don't really matter to me. guys that are sweet in personality and treat me nice all the time like my boyfriend does. We've been dating for 9 months. The time i feel like it's best for me to sleep with him...is when i'm ready and he's ready. we first had sex around valentines day. around that time, we were 8 months into our relationship.<br>  <br>  It's not hard to fine perfect guys.

Just not a muscle-bound Hulk...<br>  -sharp, intuitive, pretty eyes-any color.<br>  -hair can be long if cared for (i think its cool), but for some guys it works, others it doesn't. shorter hair is fine too, I'm just not a fan of buzz or shaved heads...and I really like red hair too. sometimes.<br>  <br>  I'm 18.

Xf93fRTTaa	Dating relationships are never sure things, but neither are marriages. The divorce rate is higher than ever.<br>  <br>  You just have to enjoy the time you have with someone, love with your whole heart, and try not to think about breaking up.<br>  <br>  By current boyfriend broke up with once. He broke up with me a month before we would've been together for a year. He said that he wasn't finished dating and that was that.<br>  <br>  Well, a month later (exactly) he came back and admitted that he felt foolish and was hoping we could give it another try. Well, we got back together and have been blissfully happy ever since. <br>  <br>  The lesson I learned: Just enjoy the time you have with someone as much as you possibly can.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	If you are worried that she may dump you, then you may have picked up on her unconscious signal that she does not want to remain in this relationship with you. You may have put out the same signals and she is reacting to them. Have a heart to heart with your gf, talk about your relationship. You may find that neither one of you is happy and maybe the relationship is over. Nothing has permanence hon, not even marriage.

Because you mentioned leaving it to fate, maybe he doesn't even know about it? And even if he does, asking your friends to ask him is a little weird.

Don't lose your chance.|`|o3UYhXNdaa	just ask him it will be the best choice because if u get one of your friends to do it and he hardly knows them then that will a little awkward unless its your best friend.Don't worry you wont seem desperate if u ask him to go because that just means you want him to go.

Then say something along the lines of. <br>  'I gotta gig this Friday, (mention where and what time) wanna come?" look at him and smile. Eye contact is important, it means that your sincere in your offer and just mentioning it in passing because you want company. but if you maintain eye contact then he should get the idea that you're asking him because you want him there. If he says yes than you're rockin! If not then say something like maybe next time and don't read into it, most guys wouldn't know an advance if it hit them in the nose.<br>  <br>  -Be casual<br>  -Eye contact<br>  -Relax<br>  <br>  Ok?

C8DOT8Y7aa	Consider day labor. There are employment agencies that specialize in this type of arrangement, and you can get paid at the end of the workday. The jobs you find through an agency can vary, but are usually in construction, factories, offices, and manufacturing. An alternative to finding day labor is to go where other day laborers meet (usually street corners or parking lots) and wait for employers (building contractors, landscapers, home owners and small business owners). If you go the non-agency route, you might get paid in cash. You can also check your local newspaper or internet classifieds to find quick labor gigs, like painting, mowing, or moving work. When considering a day labor opportunity, keep in mind that less formal arrangements could result in you not getting paid or worse, you getting injured without any kind of compensation. <br>   <br>  Sell something. Dig out that old guitar you never play, those CDs you don't listen to anymore, or your antique toy collection. Go to the pawnshop, put an ad on local internet classifieds, or hold a yard sale in front of your house or on a busy street corner (just display the item with a big sign announcing the ridiculously low price). Price items at half of what somebody would be able to buy them for anywhere else, and you may be able to sell them within an hour or two. You can also sell items online at web sites like eBay, Amazon and Craig`s list. <br>   <br>  Fill out surveys online. Companies who want to know what’s on the minds of their customers are willing to pay for your opinion. Online surveys won’t make you rich, and won’t allow you to quit your day job, but you can make a little extra cash. When choosing between surveys, read the fine print. There is usually an asterisk near the "you won" part. This means you have to do something like buying stuff before you even get to talk about your prize. Don't fall into these sorts of traps, they're ridiculously difficult and not worth it. In general, the more companies you sign up with, the more survey requests you’ll receive in your email and more opportunity you’ll have to make money. <br>   <br>  Become a street performer. If you can dance, play music, or tell jokes, you can probably get some cash by performing in public. But don't do this unless you are actually good at it. Put together a good act and find a place to perform. Give people a dose of live entertainment, and hopefully they'll reward you with tips. <br>   <br>  Panhandle. A panhandler is a person who depends on the spontaneous charity of strangers for their survival. If you really need the cash, you might swallow your pride and decide to ask for help. Make a sign, find a good location, ask politely for money, and say thank you. Cyberbegging is becoming increasingly popular, and there have been some amazing success stories, but these are the exception rather than the rule. While there are some sites on which you can beg just by putting up a brief ad, if you're looking to make any substantial money you'll probably have to build your own site and invest the time and money into it to make it successful. <br>   <br>  "Donate" plasma. Plasma is a component of blood, and the process is similar to donating blood. You're not permitted to actually sell your plasma, but you can be compensated for your time spent donating (and essentially, it's like selling your plasma). Your blood is drawn, the plasma is separated, and the red blood cells are returned to your body. You can make US$20-30 per visit and give plasma twice a week, but you must weigh at least 110 pounds, be between the ages of 18 and 59, and be in good health.[1] Many college students do this to make extra cash.[2] If you haven't been to the doctor in a while, this may be a good way to get a free health checkup.[3] <br>   <br>  One person's trash is another's gold mine.Recycle. Broke because you bought too much soda? Turn the old cans into cash by bringing them in to be recycled. If you don't have your own cans, go looking for them in trash cans or along busy roads, especially rural roads. Call up several recyclers to compare prices. If you live in a state with a bottle or can deposit system, you may be able to get 5 or 10 US cents per container. Other scrap metals are also worth something, so if you've got a big pile of scrap in your backyard or you know of an illegal dumpsite, you can pick it up in your truck and anywhere from 1 or 2 cents per pound for scrap steel to considerably more for metals such as copper or aluminum.[4] <br>   <br>  Open a lemonade stand. Especially if you're a kid, a lemonade stand or baked goods stand can bring in good money in one day. If the lemonade isn't selling, or you want to diversify, sell cookies and brownies as well. The important thing here is to find a good location, like the main entrance to an apartment building, outside a shopping center, on a busy corner near your house, or outside one of your parents’ workplaces (if you're a kid; otherwise you might get in trouble). <br>   <br>  Enter sweepstakes.

OpizETj1aa	it's possible they could be doing it because they are trying to make fun or because they generally think your attractive or maybe they're just being silly because some people are really immature. just ignore it + just act like you don't care.|`|VmbJEjzAaa	for a start everyone is attractive in his or her own way so the guys see something in you that they probably cannot find in anyone else around. even if they are out to make fun of you dont let wateva they say get to you.

Oh wait!!! nope that's not the way it happened aaahhhhh!!! now I'm sad.  : (<br>  <br>  <br>  At your age most people are preoccupied about themselves. I doubt that they want to pull a Carrie on you. Just in case Carrie is a movie by Stephen king where this outcast shy girl gets taken advantage off. She was invited to the prom and the votes where rig so that she would win prom queen. As she paraded on the stage they pour pigs blood all over her white dress. Boy was she mad!!! She lost it completely. The thing is that she also had psychic powers and could move stuff with her mind so she killed most of them that night. Is a classic. <br>  <br>      I think there are probably two possibilities as to why they are asking you out and 3 options on your behalf.<br>  <br>  The possibilities are:<br>  <br>  1) they want to pull a Carrie on you.<br>  <br>  2) They want someone to go to the dance with them and you are not as ugly as you think. Or at least not something a few beer may fix. Men i can be mean sometimes. Most peple are more attractive than they think and yes, not everybody can be Monica Belushi God bless her soul but, they are pretty good looking still. Plus a coiple of beer help too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here are your options.<br>  <br>  1) Don't go because you fear they will pull a Carrie on you.<br>  <br>  2) Don't go but never find out and always think of what could had been.<br>  <br>  3) Go and hope for the best. I can't guarantee you will have a great time but, if you don't go how will you ever know. In life you have to take calculated risk. The question is, is it worth investigating. Remember, bad experiences are experiences too. Depending how bad they are they can be learning tools. A champion is not one that wins all the time. A champion is one that overcomes adversity.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyways, keep practice your psychic powers. You never know when you have to pull a Carrie on people. Always be ready.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	You could be attractive, but no one on Y!A can answer that question because we don't know you or your situation. <br>  <br>  The best way to figure it out is to talk with them. If you don't know the person, find out how he knows you. To tell if someone's sincere, look at how they treat you the rest of the time in school, and if they show an interest in getting to know you before they ask you out. <br>  <br>  If a guy asks you out like on a "date" date, maybe you can invite him to have a coke first in the cafeteria and get to know each other. (After all you don't know him either.) See how he reacts. You'll get a impression if he's sincere or not.|`|J1kJb98Maa	maybe its the knee pads you wear|`|Vv7a31pmaa	they think you are easy.|`|YvvYtsjNaa	I certainly haven't, but maybe a lot of people where you are know that "beauty is only skin deep."  Be happy.   <br>  <br>  Don't know how old you are, but if your parents let you date, say yes to each and every offer and don't worry about whether they're making fun.  Accept the date and you'll find out right then and there.  Playing the field is the best thing at your presumably young age.  The more relationships you have the more you learn about relationships.  "Oh, I  HATE when a boy does xyz", whatever.  Okay, you've learned something both about yourself and what can come out of a relationship.  Now, on another date, you say, "Ooo!  I LOVE when a boy does abc," whatever.  Boy, are you ever learning about yourself and about relationships.  <br>  <br>  Now, suppose you date a boy who does the thing you hate AND the thing you love.  How good are you, how experienced are you to be able to decide ANYTHING about you, the guy and your relationship?  If you can't decide, you go on to the next date and hope you learn something about yourself or relationships that will give you the answer.  <br>  <br>  Relationships are complex, complicated, confusing and sometimes, sorry to say, painful.  C'es la vie.  What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.  Learn from your mistakes.  Don't take UN-necessary chances (but don't avoid the necessary ones)  Have as much fun as possible, but stay safe.|`|qSsLPBo3aa	Well I'm not sure if they are making fun of you. Just shrug it off. Take it as a compliment that guys find you attractive. <br>  <br>  LOLZ. <br>  <br>  I don't know you personally so i wouldn't no if they are making fun of you. If they laugh i guess they are making Fun of you. So just be observant LOL.<br>  <br>  good luck. it ll be okay.|`|nctI8wmBaa	Yeah, they're making fun of you.<br>  Or they were all dared to ask you out.<br>  Orrrrrr, they really DO think you're attractive.<br>  How would we know?<br>  But to me, it sounds like they were all just playing a big joke.|`|2a0e5d5b94219fa3def0dbdc7b21005daa	depends do you have a bad rep with the guys?they could just wanna sleep with you if you do...<br>  <br>  but i dunno for sure we need more info to tell you|`|Xz9Ck3OFaa	stop trying to get attention.<br>  If SO many people ask you out you already know your attractive.<br>  <br>  <br>  GET A LIFE.|`|gbeTKHYkaa	congratulations!|`|CzIaAnsraa	Dares?

Sooner or later he'll learn the hard way but until that I don't think there's much you can do or say to make him realize it.

Then say you aren't much of a phone person but would really love to get together and talk more/hang out. He will respect it and it will push you two closer. Don't over think it! The more stress you put into things the harder they get when they don't have to be.

ymmrsEZ0aa	U see now Amanda is the devil there. Prove to Brandon that Amanda is telling lies about you so that Amanda wont get his attention and say that Amanda just wants his attention. Get closer to Brandon so that he'll trust you so that whenever "one fine day" that brandon is ur bf,u know she'll get angry and jealous about u guys,but when Brandon trusted you deeply,he knows that Amanda is just telling lies and he can just tell Amanda to walk off. Call Brandon and make sure Amanda is not around and just talk like normal,just keep yourself close to him until he makes the first move because u dont want yourself to sound desperate for him,dont you? =)
ibeVcQyWaa	The singing part, always singing about what you're doing, yea, that would annoy the hell out of me!  I'm outgoing too and have no problem saying hi to complete strangers, I mean, how else do we make them non-strangers!  Anyhow, being outgoing is good, but singing all the time, I can easily see how that would annoy some people, well, MOST people.  And yes, when I say that something or someone is annoying, I mean it.|`|yCkCqFmjaa	Well, you sound like a pretty cool person! Generally if someone says you're annoying, they're just kidding around... unless they appear to be saying it in away like they don't want you to know. If they just come out and say it then they're probably just joking though. But, even if people say you're annoying, it doesn't mean it's true. If they weren't joking (which they probably are) then it's just an opinion... and you should always be true to yourself no matter what anyone thinks. You sound like a very friendly person anyways, why change that? ;)<br>  <br>  God bless,<br>  Secret Agent Bucktooth|`|TstiC2Ilaa	I usually mean it when I say it...and honestly, that probably would get on my nerves.|`|aUosbTqqaa	They are obviousl jealouse. Keep it going girl with good mood and nice songs. Enjoy in your life. They didn't mean that you're really annoying. Maby they weren't in good mood or they are just jelaouse.|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	well im a really silly person so most of the time im playin around and sometimes mean it only in a silly wasy my bf thinks im anoyin he allways rolls his eyes at me ; (
nqjAed6Paa	truthfully, if my friend did this to me, i woudld get vrey annoyed.  it seems like seh is controling you. maybe you should tell her that its been bothering yyou that she always thinks shes right and that she can be bossy at times.  she might get mad about this at first.  after you tell her you can ask her if you do anything that bugs her.  soon she will understand and you both will try to stop doing the things that annoy each other.|`|AA10227962	This is a hard question, because if I say no and you take my advice<br>  and cut it off , you may be alone for a while.But if i say yes you may stay with a friend that makes you misrable. I would start looking for the kind of friends that treat you as you treat them, or be alone , while<br>  still looking for the right friends.|`|jcK34hZuaa	Friend? Definitely not. Fiend maybe. You shouldn't bother with her; she seems like a complete jerk who likes to put others down. Find friends that will treat you better.|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	No she's not. But, she does sound like a control freak! You should never take this abuse from anyone. Start calling her stupid and see how she like that. And nobody and I mean nobody has any right putting their hands on you! She is not a friend!

Maybe you can ask a friend to find out for you? You can never really know for sure.  Sometimes it might seem like it and he really doesn't and sometimes it seems like he doesn't when he secretly does.  Try to get the courage to tell him that you like him and, worst case scenerio, he'll say know.  Hopefully he isn't immature about it. :)|`|yJd1H8C9aa	just talk to him, thats all you can do. just talk to him. see what he says, if he says no its not the end of the world. theres plenty out there.|`|KN4ZUNE0aa	um need more info. what is he like around you?...what does he say? does he look at you differently, smile, listen, txt you constantly?....either way he doesnt love you lol..he may like you...hang out with him more|`|SBNbMBCeaa	Talk to him.You can tell by the way he ask you things or just answers you.

I know you might not want to wait for your answer from the boy that you just want to know now but don't worry you will find out sooner or later.

Does this person show a special interest in having a conversation with you and, once started, make an effort to keep that conversation going? <br>  <br>  Is this person "accidentally" running into you in places where he or she knows you will be, such as at your desk? At the Laundromat on Tuesdays? At your brother's birthday party? <br>  <br>  Make a note if he or she mentions future plans to spend time with you: "That band is coming to town soon. We should really get tickets." <br>  <br>  Spend time alone together. Canceling other plans in order to be with you longer, or not finding excuses to leave, could be a sign of interest. <br>  <br>  Has he or she been calling for random reasons, such as, "I was wondering if you knew what that pizza place down the street is called," followed by, "Are you hungry?" <br>  <br>  Has this person taken a sudden interest in your life and hobbies? This is a sure sign that he or she is interested in something - and it's probably not your stamp collection. <br>  <br>  Observe how the person acts around your friends - he or she might be extra friendly to your closest pals for a reason. <br>  <br>  Body Language<br>  <br>  Sometimes seeing someone you have a crush on results in telltale physiological signs. Does the person in question blush when you look at him or her? His or her sympathetic nervous system is probably going into overdrive. Does he or she have trouble speaking, using jumbled words when talking to you? <br>  <br>  See if the person in question mirrors your motions: When you lean back, he or she leans back; when you put your elbows on the table, he or she does the same. <br>  <br>  Note whether this person sits or stands in the open position - that is, facing you with arms uncrossed. In addition, a woman tends to cross her legs in a man's direction. <br>  <br>  Does he or she move closer to you and/or touch you subtly, such as with a pat of your hand or a touch of your cheek? <br>  <br>  Other elements of body language include frequent eye contact, holding your gaze and looking down before looking away, energetic speech coupled with open hands, and flashing palms. <br>  <br>  Does the person you're wondering about just plain smile at you a lot? <br>  <br>  good luck|`|G2QNC22eaa	he might do but there is no information to what your trying to tell everyone maybe a little information would help people see <br>  from different angles in weather he likes you or not don't be afraid to tell any one we are all here to help <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine please :) <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au4zw7C9Rf1oXoqbBSLpcajsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309135727AApkGwN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Vcg2QuDWaa	Ask him.

b4e75c5b487a0e6b8386619cf286fea5aa	Karma will come and bite him in the ***. It seems he has no interest in you anymore and maybe has found someone else. He was a jerk for losing you and I believe karma will come to him.|`|FsXiIO9saa	Don't fall for his BS!  Take back the power.  He sounds like a control freak and he's controlling you with his antics.  Sounds like he wanted to get the last say so.  He transferred all his emotion back onto you.  Take back  your power and leave him in the dust.  Write down a list of all the things you've ever wanted to do in life and start on them one by one.  Do things to get yourself back on track. Time will heal this wound too.  Later you will be thinking why you ever gave him a second thought.
K119R72Caa	Well most girls are smart. They just know if they like you when they look at you. When they look in your eyes they can tell if your sweet or not by seeing if the guy looks and her eyes and maybe smiles at them. Though you really can't to tough how to tell what a girl is like by her eyes and clothes. Any clothes she wears she can be sweet mean or both. You can't tell without talking to her and getting to know her. And by the eyes just the same way I explained about the guys<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little bit. Good luck!|`|WH1tCBCTaa	huh? i really do not understand :S|`|dr0Mi2Cmaa	lol well easy u could tell if a girls a slut if they have a short *** skirt on wit no panites lol n by there eyes u can tell there realli nice by like if they shine like just if they look bright there happy n if they look lost n confused they need someone lol u get me like ppl tell me u kno ur gorgeous n tall n thats wat caught my eye but ur eyes also did it because i saw in them that u were sincere n happy so yea eyes tell alot n so can cclothes|`|mbYsZ83Zaa	His eyes can show us his innocence.
DwgmPUHMaa	'cause its confusing when your one of them'<br>  that's qualiteeeee!|`|p75MeVQ9aa	There's a difference between nice and desperate. <br>  <br>  Women hate desperate guys. <br>  <br>  If you're all mushy and like "here's a card and here's chocolate and here's 10 texts a day and I love you more than anything in the world etc etc", and you haven't even had sex yet... she will dump your *** hard.<br>  <br>  Women hate it when guys fawn over them like she's your only chance not to be a loser or something. You can't give a girl everything right off the bat. You need to withhold some things and show her you aren't afraid to date other people if she says no. <br>  <br>  You need to be more casual. More confident. All the mushy stuff is for after you've had sex.

AA10408380	Because, we all like to laugh, and we want to know we can cuddle up next to our sweet n funny guy, n he'll care for us. Rough n tumble guy will just make us insecure because we wonder if he'll cheat on us, because toughness is sexy, but sweet n funny is cute. Sexy lasts a moment, but cute lasts a lifetime.

oIdQaEAUaa	You have been dating for 3 months but you feel that the relationship is now "slowing down" You feel that he may be seeing you through obligation rather than because he wants to spend time with you. <br>  <br>  My experience is that when you care for someone you over analyse their every movement and behaviour and yes there is a certain amount of paranoia. <br>  <br>  In my mind there is only thing that you can do in this situation and that's to talk about it in a relaxed non-confrontational way. Don't make it a big deal - just drop it into a conversation and get a sense of what he's thinking? <br>  <br>  Just make a statement on the lines of "I remember when we first got together we used to see each x amount of times each week and now we see each other x times a week" Leave it as a statement and see what his response is - if he doesn't react - then say the same thing again but this time with a question. <br>  <br>  Do make him feel comfortable otherwise he'll go on the defensive and not tell you his true feelings. Judging by what he says you can act accordingly. Best of Luck|`|9ELrj4PDaa	i think you really need to chill out! jesus your only fifteen you got your whole life ahead of you to have all that, you'll get more bfs anyway and alot of em are dogs n e wayz|`|CTgG9ENyaa	wow freaky i had this problem with current boyfriend but this was the first time we went out (this is second time 1 year and a half in total) and the first time we were'nt really opening up to each other and as you can tell that ended but then when we decided to talk about what went wrong we realised that we just didn't communicate enough as i was in exactly the same situation as you and because we wouldn't talk about our problems and issues we just kind of drifted apart but now we are happier than ever and more communicative<br>  <br>  so long story short tell him how you feel he wouldn't say he should or wants to see you more if he didn't mean it, maybe he's just as paranoid as you which is why you need to talk haha <br>  <br>  i really hope this helps <br>  xx

Don't be ignorant and stuck in what YOU want and only you.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Just three words<br>  Run for the Hills!|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Your husband is right not to adopt the children in my opinion. For him, it could turn out to be a grave mistake if you were to divorce, then he would be stuck paying for children that aren't biologically his. <br>  <br>  I love my step son dearly, but I'll be damned if I'm going to be held financially responsible for him through a court order when he has a Dad.|`|AA10886262	where is their father for starters, your bf can't adopt them without the biological father's permission, assuming he is still living.......you are wrong in having not discussed this before 4 years were up.......|`|TdPBvgC2aa	Reconsider marriage, these are YOUR children, he needs to WILLINGLY love. I sure hope you 2 are not living together,,,Why do they believe he is dad ?|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	There's no right answer here.  You're not wrong to feel this way, but it is a very high expectation that many men will not meet.  It's just not.  I'm sorry for you to feel this way and completely understand.<br>  <br>  My grandmother was never adopted by the only man she ever knew as father.  She didn't realize the impact until the reading of the will and was left a token sum while the man's children inherited enough money to make them wealthy.  She never got over the way it felt.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a compromise:  Ask him about estate planning--just as a security need for you to have met, since he feels unable to meet the other one.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I became a single mom when my son was 14 months old and his father is out of the picture almost completely.  My take is this:  If I remarry, it will be because I find the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.  How he treats my son will, of course, be a huge factor, but I will never expect him to become my son's father legally.  I would not have allowed my child to think he was his father from the start.  Concentrate on fixing this for your children before you worry about marrying this man.  I feel like your children are young enough to introduce terms like "step father" and "birth father" into their vocabulary without causing them irreparable harm.  I would not wait on this.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I agree with you about not bringing the real dad into this.  I am getting married to my boyfriend who has a daughter by another woman.   Her mom hasn't been around, and for the most part I've been her mom when her biological mom hasn't.   I plan on adopting her, but I don't know how that will work over with the real mom.  People tend to want things they didn't want before when someone trys to take it away (if that makes any sense).<br>  <br>  As for him not wanting to adopt them, maybe he does not want to be legally tied to them.  I know that sounds silly, but he can still be nice to them, treat them like a father figure, and even love them...but not necessarily want to be legally responsible for them if you two ever separate (ie child support).  If you love him, and all of you work well together as a family, then why not marry him?   Some paperwork shouldn't stop you.<br>  <br>  Good lucK!|`|krQiDGCHaa	You can legally change your children's last name to yours without your husband adopting the kids.  You simply explain to the court that you want them to have the same name as you -- they usually grant it as long as the birth father isn't around to protest it, which I'm assuming he isn't or you wouldn't ask your new husband to adopt them.<br>  <br>  Though I do encourage you to look at how your kids might feel.  Their name is their identity, and they may not be comfortable changing it.  How old are they?  I say if they're school aged, you should allow them to choose whether or not they want their name changed.<br>  <br>  As far as him not adopting your children, that's his choice.  Maybe he would prefer not have LEGAL ties or responsibilities to them, as he would if he adopted them?  That's his choice, and it's your choice how important him adopting them is to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Classic, trying to guilt your guy into "adopting" your children so you can collect child support if something happens to your marriage.<br>  <br>  Personally I see it just like a pre-nup, covering your nuts for worst case scenariors.  NEVER do it men..don't get conned because if she loved you this would NOT be an issue.  That she makes it a condition of "marriage'..RUN RUN RUN.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  This is NO different than a STEP-FATHER who does not adopt their future wives children.  It's absurd to think he isn't willing to take care of your children, raise them, protect them, instill values in them simply because he is unwilling to legally adopt them.  Don't fall for the conn job dude, don't..|`|NEWbh3Plaa	Well I can see it both ways.  I see your point, if you are going to be married then why shouldn't he adopt them.  However if you he was to adopt your children and you two were to get a divorce there would be a custody battle and he would have to pay child support for the children that were not his to begin with.  It really isn't fair to him in that aspect.  I think if you love each other and he is a great father  to your children then let it be.  It takes a good man to be a father-not a last name.|`|AA11231094	First of all you do not have to take his name, u could keep yours and you children's name. So that's not a real issue. But you can not make someone do something they do not want to do, Maybe he doesn't want the responsibility of any future child support that could happen if y'all were to divorce in the future. Either way it truly is a decision that he can only make. I'd say let it be, If he chooses to in the future then that's fine.... Where are there bio father?|`|GXOy8rjqaa	When I divorced my sons father I took my maiden name back.  When I got remarried I kept my name.  My new husband is really the only father my son knows and has called him Dad for over 11 years.  We all have different last names so I feel it makes no difference.|`|jBigEy0Caa	If he is not the father, they should know & it is not right to lie to them.  He does not have to adopt them either, and it is wrong for you to force him to.|`|RcpRW202aa	I agree with your b/f if he does everything else why does it matter that he adopts them or not.<br>  <br>  my ex-step-father adopted me and when him and my mom devorced he tried to take me away from her. (just a thought)|`|PzboDDI2aa	he doesnt have to adopt them|`|lzooHi0Baa	You have more than one problem to handle.  The first one and most important is that you need to let your children know your b/f is not their biological father.  I would advise you to consult a school counselor for that, they are professionals and will guide you through the process without anyone getting hurt.<br>  <br>  Second, the fact that your b/f does not want to adopt your children says a lot about his true feelings.   I am sure he will never make mortgage payments unless his name is on the title.   This shows ownership, commitment and obligation.    Same with adopting.  If he loves your children the way you say he does, then let him put the money where his mouth is.<br>  <br>  I would not marry him, nor change my name.   Why would your children have different last names and feel left out?   Think about them, not your b/f, I don't think he is in your life for a long term.
xhStKwUDaa	No, because it might tell that guy that you don't love or care for him.  if you really like a guy you should spend time with him.|`|vBcqzMz4aa	no. hard to get just pisses us off.
YPCMqlsQaa	Its hard to say what you should do because I don't know the ins and out of you relationship. But usually the best way to get over someone is to not see them any more. Cut off ties and get ride of things that are constant reminders of that person. However this may not be your best choice seeing as how you both still want to be together
zANbF7dnaa	haha me and my girlfriend call eachother names/adjectives like lovely beautiful gorgeous and so on : )
an23kSIaaa	tell him you are there for him, and if he needs anything- even just someone to sit with in silence, that you are there for him.|`|6gPCA7jHaa	My father died a few months ago, just be there for him, listen to him talk, hug him. That is a vary hard thing to deal with especially when you are close to your dad. Good luck and make sure he knows that he needs to hold his head up and be the man his father taught him to be.
Q7DXrxMTaa	If this guy has liked you before then this probably means that he still does. I went out with a guy last year and we moved onto so many other people, and recently he told me he still loves me and we're going back out. So i dont think his feeligns would really change that much. STill i would ask about a few of your friends, and try to find out ifhe likes you. Forget about the popularity thing, it does seem to matter, but when you're going out it really doesn't. And maybe he likes quiet girls? You probably think he's just staring for the sake of it but believe me, stares mean a lot. So just find out as much as you can abotu him liking you and then try to show him back that you like him. Should work. Good luck :)|`|xSX9FRu2aa	i think he might just want your friend <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au.vhmxufntD5UkB2Ieuuqjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309132824AAVEwJK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|JM1kBBGraa	hes shy your shy get toghther and love.|`|4xAOZXwNaa	i honestly think he probably does like you! :) But do you talk to him in person a lot?? Like in order to get him to notice you you need to talk to him. Like just texting him saying "hey" isn't gonna do much. When you see him during school ask him what class does he have next or whats up. And one time when I liked this guy I had my friend push me (not to hard) into him so you know it looked like i accidentally bumped into him and then we started talking and it turns out that he had liked me but he dint think i liked him so he got a gf. But yeah lol my point is try talking to him and then tell him how you feel! Like most people end up regretting things that were left unsaid. So make sure you once you start to talk to him that you tell him you like him or else he will never know. But I'm pretty sure things will work out! :) And the whole him being popular thing shouldn't really matter. Oh and you said he always stares at you so I think he does like you.. or else why would he be staring at you? And if he seems to stare at you but then once you look at him he looks away really fact, then that means hes shy but you go get him! lol|`|vL1IBeXnaa	well he  likes you maybe u should start paying more attention to him.|`|UNV91uBkaa	some times looks and ways people talk to you so dont get  distracted with good looks|`|OfmvrCY9aa	Oh my g0d girl he likes you!!|`|1fcq5tSEaa	im pretty sure he likes you. at least in the beginning he did. he might be playing hard to get if he doesn't seem to be paying as much attention as he used to. maybe he just wanted you to know he liked you but then decided to see if you try to chase him and see if you like him. try not to make a big deal out of it though. he might want you to get worried and such lol hope i helped:)|`|Ove0qdhLaa	okay first off let me get this out of my system awwww that is soooo cute.<br>  <br>  i think he likes you, he just might be too shy to say anything.<br>  but from what youve said it seems like he really likes you.<br>  <br>  he just sounds too adorable.<br>  <br>  hope this helped :]]|`|zlQLsR89aa	its sounds to me like hes using u to get back together with ur friend.|`|8tdW9FUHaa	let me just say this first:  finally, some other people my age that feel !<br>  <br>  so anyway, i think he likes you. and the fact that your friend asked you if you would go out with him is definitely a sign that he probably talked to yours friends about it. and the fact that they wont answer the question "why?" is a pretty sure sign that he told them not to let you know yet.<br>  <br>  And what you should do.<br>  Just walk up to him, at school, and just say that you noticed him looking at you lately or something. and then ask him if he like you. <br>  <br>  G O O D _ L U C K !  <br>  A N D _ I _ H O P E _ T H I S _ H E L P S
gPeEdjmuaa	Wow he has liked a lot of girls, lol. Anyway, he does seem very interested. When a guy stares at you a lot they are thinking either two things: either he thinks you are really pretty or he doesn't find you very attractive. Most likely, he thinks you're really pretty because of all the other things you said he does! I would say he definitely likes you and is very interested (you know he is because he had a girl "randomly" ask you if you would go out with him, you don't get asked that every day.. especially if he shows other signs he likes you.) It doesn't matter if he is more popular then you, most guys don't care about that, as long as you aren't anti-social and stay to yourself all the time. If you really like him and eventually would like to date him, then I think you need to start talking with him more. Get that friend who told you the information about your gift to try to pry more juicy stuff out of his brother! Use him to your advantage. And man, if he liked you for 3 years then he probably still likes you even now. That's a long time! Good luck.|`|AA10177841	Well...you are 13. You don't need to worry about dating right now.|`|GnkoLPImaa	that's cute! but gosh ur so young. ur jus 13, go study!|`|78df2af4c924f7e2bcf6e2971f51a041aa	But if he liked you before, then that means he still does, somehow. You still have the chance. Texting is okay, but I think it's better talking to him in person. He's popular, so of course he'll have girlfriends and such right? Just talk to him.|`|D5UAhY8jaa	hey not all guys are imature im the most mature kid threw out middle school and high school and its true gosh girl expect every guy to be imature i hate it when they say that its not every guy that imature ok get it right now im pissed off today<br>  <br>  im 13 turning 14 in june 3rd this year|`|c9SmMYDDaa	1. dont go out with guys the same age as u (they are really immature)<br>  2. don't go out with guys till u leave school (they will distract u heaps and ruin ur grades)<br>  3. when u text him ask him something and giv him a reason to respond- none of my guy friends even my bf respond to "hey" it's considered a waste of texts and time.<br>  4. if he really likes you and finds out that u like him then he will probly ask u out.<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  xoxo|`|GarCuuvoaa	your 13 non of this matters
WH1tCBCTaa	i hate to say it but i think that you have to take the job and move away.  if she really loves you she'd support you and move with you.<br>  <br>  you might regret it if you don't move away and follow your dream job<br>  xx|`|UKYDpztQaa	well if there is no hope of you EVER living with eachother. or at least close enough. i would probably end it. most long distance relationships are temporary for the most part. even if its only a year or so. there is a future. when you know neither of you will never live close enough. i really think its a waste of your time and money. sure you could go through the trouble and try to make it work but it is very hard. ultimately it is up to you and her. remember there is always other fish in the sea. and plenty people to love.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	I wish there were more details . . . like ages and how long you two have been together.<br>  <br>  I'm going to go with my gut on this one: MOVE TO NEW MEXICO!<br>  <br>  I wish you the absolute best!  = )
bszyOuIqaa	Most would say no, but you can always defy odd when you both want to.  The question is that what BOTH of you want.  Or is someone secretly hoping it will be more than sex? That will be the determining factor.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	if sleeping with each other its not a big deal it shouldnt affect. how about ya have an accident and a baby comes in the way...or someone have feelings for the other and at the end ends up feeling used .... or when hes with other guys you get mad or jealous.... you know...think about it.|`|WdBCECa1aa	I have slept with a best friend before, and we're so close. There is nothing wrong with having some fun with a close friend. Your friendship should be fine as long as you both realize that you're not going to have a relationship other than friendship.|`|OhKl0BAVaa	you can be friends, this dosent mean you ever have to talk to them ever again tho.|`|AA10928214	It usually doesn't work like that with a Friends with Benefits relationship. One person or both persons usually end up liking the other.|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	Probably not. Someone is likely to get emotionally attached.|`|yFwc1RqNaa	yeah if you both dont act weird about it<br>  <br>  And are jsut having a good<br>  <br>  time <br>  not caring<br>  being outgoing cool<br>  <br>  about it all|`|b913c8b7c941189d314d33ad1ef6a6efaa	if it was casual sex,|`|AA11632636	It will definitely change the relationship. If sex means anything to you, it will make you more attached to the person. But my ex-boyfriend and I slept together, and we are best friends now. But it was weird at first. And we still love each other.|`|nZjdi0wKaa	well, going out is no big deal, you guys just got to know that both of you love each other. yeah you can still be friends, just state it. (pssst he'll be a bit pissed about not being lovers|`|7jlSKRXBaa	yh course u can im friends with a lad that i lost my virginity too n now were really good freinds xx|`|SS87lbOCaa	no you ****** manwhore!|`|4v2ZTZvAaa	I hope so!!. . . it can work for some people but most of the time it doesn't|`|ibeVcQyWaa	YES, you can.  It happens on a daily basis all over the world.  But be prepared for awkward feelings, those are inevitable.  Being that intimate with another person, that will make things strange between you.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Sex is the best way to destroy a friendship.... Friends with benefits will work for a while, but often the girl starts to develop feelings and wants a relationship and not just be friends with benefits.|`|AA10892706	Yes it is possible. I dated him for almost 2 years and we broke up. That was in 1997 and we are now best friends - and we still hook up every so often!|`|MfUMaKcDaa	um no? what kind of question is this?
Efn4lj5vaa	wow Dareed, you are one pathetic loser.|`|2hcA3VP9aa	look, i work around people like you just about all day long,  if you want to stay out of jail, i would recommend you not push her into it because both of you might not be ready and she can say that you forced her to do it. i hope that you reconsider because that is just not right what you are trying to do. i hope this helped and do something else so you wont be thinking about sex all the time because that is how people go to jail, trust me i work around people that had the same problem that you had, i work inside a high security prison.|`|iYRBbpGWaa	First of all, you're an idiot, sorry. You shouldn't make her have sex if she doesn't want to have sex - that's her decision, not yours. And if you're going to cheat on her and leave her because of it, then she definitely deserves better than you anyways. That is low. Real low. If you can't respect her and her choices and jsut wait then you should leave her, because that is wrong on so many levels.|`|9waLV4Miaa	break up with her. its really meaaaannnn. but if u do want her, act like you dont for ages then pounce|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	Well then you really don't love her.  It's just sex to you.  Go ahead and break up with her and she can find someone who really loves her and not pressure her for sex.  She will when she's ready.  Don't pressure her or she will not trust you and you still won't get any.|`|Pelf56DHaa	Well you are a total loser. So I'm not going to help you. As a matter of fact just break up with her in a decent way and go find a slut that is free and "open" with her body. That way your girlfriend can move on and find someone who is not such a jerk.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	You should cheat on her and break-up with her. She doesnt need somebody like you in her life.|`|luEYdZ53aa	tell her that sex is really a important thing to you and that you might not be able to continue with the realtionship if she dosen't want to open up.<br>  <br>  <br>  If she still dose not want to go through with it then break up with her gentley....|`|FzFSzilmaa	try respecting her... and self-loving until you grow up...:D|`|mMByiHaQaa	OMG<br>  Why is it that all you want from a relationship is sex?<br>  When she is ready she will tell you! <br>  You loser -.-|`|wohGR1Nkaa	Dude.

Judging from other people's comments, I think that the majority of them agree also.|`|yDgxAHO9aa	you made this story up didn't you?|`|b7uInQltaa	thats shallow and mean...she shud dump u!!!!|`|CdcXDIqeaa	What a pig! <br>  she should dump you!|`|s1hlS8Icaa	Why don't you choose to be honest with her, and tell her you are really desperate to have sex with her, and if she chooses not to have sex with you  that you intend to break up with her and have sex with someone else.  Don't try to talk someone into sex just because you don't have any self control.  She may not be ready for it.  Who is to say that even if she does "put out" that you won't cheat on her anyway?  Virginity is a very sacred thing to girls, and they don't just give it away at their boyfriends whim.  If they do, then they haven't had the right role models, or dont' have enough respect for themselves.  Don't hide your true motives from her, make it known so she will know what kind of person you truley are.|`|VVH1KWaaaa	maybe she won't have sex with you because you have absolutely no integrity. you sound like a complete asshole. she should dump you.|`|qjcTgXcZaa	Wow... you're a ***** just break up with her already if you are thinking like that.|`|PbCeuT36aa	She needs a little snow white.<br>  Make her ride the white unicorn.<br>  It's an automatic score when girls are under the influence of cocaine.|`|RNqHL8y7aa	You're a douche, she probably deserves better.

"Want to come up for a glass of wine?" Remembering you only have beer once you get her inside is OK.<br>  <br>  > BE SHY: Say, "Umm, I really love kissing you. I, uh, don't want the night to end." This gives her the opportunity to be assertive, even if she is just feeling sorry for you for being such a dork.<br>  <br>  > BE CLASSIC; Look her in the eye and say, "Let's go somewhere we can be alone." Resist the urge to use a French accent.<br>  <br>  > BE ALL ABOUT HER: Give her the impression that you can't stop whatever you've been doing until she is satisfied. Sure, you'll probably get off in the process, but assure her that she is going to have fun, too.<br>  <br>  > BE SICKENINGLY SWEET: Coo, "Want to come over and cuddle?"

Uj5kuzoJaa	I've totally been there, where you want to prove to him that you're not the same person you used to be. But because he has a gf, you need to keep a little distance. It's ok to call and talk to him, or write him on Facebook/myspace/email, but don't try to take all his time up. Put yourself in his gf shoes. If he's going to break up with her, then let it happen before you do anything too serious. Once he's done with her, make your move. Ask him if he wants to go with you to a movie. See if he's still interested in you. After one or two dates, bring up what you're feeling to him. Let him know that you want to try this relationship out again. Tell him that you've matured a lot over the past year and you'd like to test the waters. If he's not interested, then it's time to move on. I hope this helps!|`|Q7DXrxMTaa	I know how it feels when you know that you've definitely grown up and you want him to know that.<br>  <br>  Its fine not to be ready yet but if you think you are ready now you should totally tell him how you feel and make sure he knows that you're ready for a real relationship now. <br>  <br>  Make sure that you aren't ruining his and this girl's happiness before you tell him this though. If your sure things arent working out between them, let him know your there :)
xoXkHOVsaa	You are an adult and old enough to know what you want.  If you two love each other then there is nothing wrong with it.  You have some extra challenges.  You may not be ready to settle down, at his age that's probably what he wants.
G2Nnt23xaa	he means well. he's only upset because he loves you, honestly wants to spend time with you and probably loves you so much he can't imagine putting education before you. it's sweet, and you should understand how he's feeling, too.<br>  but still, it's hard for him to understand. you need to simply sit him down, face to face, and tell him you're having a busy time this year. make it clear that you would love to spend more time with him, but you need to focus on other aspects of your life for now. just say to him that you need to focus on this for now, and he needs to be able to deal with that. also make sure you add that you can't wait till you're done with this stage of your life so you can have time with him later.<br>  good luck!!|`|7z9eKO2maa	yes... that's being pushy, and negatively obsessive... neither are stable in a relationship. break it off|`|AA10874773	no, its a sign of him being controlling.  trust me, this is the last thing you need in your life.  if thats how he's starting out, it'll only get worse - WAY worse.  be careful!
Di6FAQxRaa	The best thing for you to do is tell him  " sweety i love you a lot but i need a lot of time to study for upcoming exams, you are very important to me , but so are these exams for now...when im finished studying can we hang out then?.. please bear with me ok, im really behind on my work" .............. I think if you tell him in that manner he will understand. Tell him u have to study a lot and u need time to do that, instead of saying u need space. Youll miss him and hell miss you more,,,,good luck keep me posted. best answer :)|`|oHN6jwjoaa	let him know that if things get more and more serious with you guys<br>  then you will have plenty of time in the future.<br>  just tell him that you love him and want to stay with him <br>  but you need some time to yourself in order to get <br>  your life on track and going.<br>  <br>  he needs to know this or you guys could end up not<br>  liking each other because of all the time you do spend<br>  together.|`|ntfOcTnWaa	I feel the same way.<br>  <br>  I guess just build him up with how much you love him, but tell him he has to understand that you have a lot of work to do lately, and after that everything will be back to normal between you.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|Jhr68T0baa	Tell him you need to focus and revise for exams. Only way to be honest.|`|qHCf8S5maa	Your boyfriend seems to be a little pushy. Just tell him in a way that won't hurt his feelings, and if that doesn't help than he's just being possessive. He should considerate of your feelings and not be so sensitive. Maybe tactfully advise him to have some hobbies  and do other things with his time so you both can have some breathing room and miss each other sometimes.|`|gkOsA49faa	Just be honest and upfront with him. Let him know that you need to get work done and that you still care about him even if you aren't spending every night together. Just like guys need some time alone, let him know that you need some girl time. If he really cares, he should understand. If he doesn't understand, he could be clingy which in itself is going to be a problem. I wish you the best of luck.|`|6dhPFK5Jaa	you need to just tell him: "hey, man. we see eachother alot, and i still love you. dont worry. but i just need some time to myselfe once in a while. you know?" he will understand. :)|`|7jlSKRXBaa	ive just finished my bf for that reason i knw how u feel but jus tell him u need space to do ur cousework xx|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	in any relationship if its to work well both need good communication and understanding. you need to tell him exactly how you feel about him as well as your faitfhfullness to him but need some time to accomplish your goals. if he truly cares then he will understand unless hes really that insecure|`|4S9FPdHQaa	your best answer is to just be honest. tell him how u really feel, and he should understand and cut u a break. and if he doesnt, he just isnt the right one. If he loves you like u love him, then he wont be misunderstanding. so just be honest. <br>  <br>  p.s. hope this helps!!
QBMrnfihaa	You know when you are truely in love with someone, if you would give up your life for them, imagine yourselves in your old age still together with a family. <br>  but then again<br>  how do you know what love is? how do you know if its real? how do you know if anyone has ever been in love or whether everyone is just to afraid to leave their partner?<br>  do you think about him most of the time? wondering what hes up to? wondering if hes wondering the same about you ?|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Wow, people sure do get influenced by romantic ideologies. Lots of people claim to be in love, but how many people do you see going around taking bullets and jumping in front of buses to prove it. You might feel like you would die for someone you love, but most people would chicken out in real life.<br>  <br>  More to the point, you're not gonna fall that hard b/c you're under 17 (I'm guessing 14 or 15).<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you have to ask, then you're not really in love. If you're getting those butterflies in your stomach around a certain guy, then that's a crush. It's lust not love. But hopefully he feels the same way about you and he'll ask you out.|`|cQaHukqUaa	well.... if just the thought that tomorrow he will be gone from your life, scares you to death, then you are in love.|`|nBaRuZ5xaa	You want to spend the rest of your life with them.|`|DihDiQsKaa	Its hard to tell someone but, if you really feel a deep connection between you and him it could mean if you like him.|`|yelqyRLIaa	Well if your really in love you can tell trust mee.|`|VaqwgaMmaa	Only you can tell whether u love him or not.|`|VovdTt2gaa	If that guy were too be kidnapped by aliens, you will die to save him.|`|THlYgi0Kaa	if you keep looking at him, you think of him, you want him with you every day...|`|M2xyrBjEaa	When you love someone, you'll DEFINATELY know it.|`|dpsD6YYqaa	If you like him <br>  <br>  Can you help me  ?!??!?!|`|UXco9F0eaa	if u feel it|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	u cant tell.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	when you are truly in love you know it
mRpeg975aa	There are some who will if they're brave enough, but me, personally, no. lol|`|a1iam8Zvaa	the guy usually has to make the move|`|aed7tlLcaa	some will, some play hard to get, but most of the time, the guys make the moves. if the guy doesnt make the move, i get tired so i make the move|`|JUrcvLklaa	That depends soley on the personality/confidence of the girl in question, and also on the boy's own conficence... If a girl is very confident/bold, the yes she very well might make the first move, but you will never know until it happens<br>  <br>  My boyfriend made most of the first moves, but was too shy to kiss me etc, so I had to take the initiative and give him a kiss the first time...|`|2GQv8dfgaa	if the girl is more outgoing.. yeah i think so. <br>  but i usually wait for the guy to make the move. im not easy, and supposedly guys like a challenge. thats what all my guy friends tell me ;D|`|hF6uZqWRaa	it all depends on the girl. When i was younger about 13-17 i would expect the guy to make a move but now that im older 20 ive changed. If im interested and i want to talk to a guy i will make a move and let them know im interested.|`|oOD3dYaNaa	LOL You wish. Maybe some confident girls would, but for the majority of us, we want the guy to make the first move. =]|`|roSpakagaa	bahaa.<br>  not usually.<br>  -the girls are normally the ones who want the guy to make the first movie.<br>  <br>  unless they;re reallyyy confident.|`|yMiviAXPaa	ya i would nd about 2 do it 2morrow
zxQT3Uo5aa	why would you want to be in a mess like this?  no matter what he does, move on.|`|AA11678263	Uh, why would you want to be his sloppy seconds???  Have more self respect and let the loser chase the other girls.  Find someone for whom you are and will always be first choice, no matter who else is on the market.|`|hnCDmgyEaa	well i know you like this person but you shouldn't wait on him to decide on who he wants you should be his 1st and not the 2nd or 3rd. leave him and find someone who is worthy of your time.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Don't settle for someone who will only "give you a chance" because the girls he really wants to be with are currently seeing someone else. Have a little self-respect and tell him to take a hike.|`|N185NghYaa	I can't understand anything you're saying.|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Wow, your a mess.  Don't ever go with someone unless they are crazy about you.  Have some standards.|`|pnCYdBUuaa	What you want in life, isn't "a chance to go out with me if these other girls aren't free". He's obviously an ex-for a reason, count your blessings and leave him in the ex column.  Don't wait and see, don't say yes, just say no to Zak.  Find someone that really want's to be with you.<br>  <br>  -To the world you may only be one person, but to one person, you are the world.-<br>  <br>  That's the guy you're going to find. Not Zak. You deserve to find somebody amazing, don't settle for less.  Good luck and stay strong. :) Keep smiling!|`|unM3qcRQaa	Unless you want to get your feelings hurt, you should wait.. it seems to me like he doesn't have his mind made up...|`|dGTRaBMqaa	HES A **** DONT GO AFTERR HIMM|`|6LHYY2Bkaa	its plain and simple:HELL NO
Qxx0svOVaa	confront him about what his friends or saying. play it by year and see if it turns into something more. its simple advice but usually simple is better. good luck ;)|`|zFqJpKrraa	well, all relatioshuips start out as friendships, so you wouldnt ruin anything if you were to go out with him. the best thing you could do is just ask him very calmly if he really does like you. guys usually like girls that are confident enough to ask themselves and not just hear it through poeple. good luck =]|`|4xAOZXwNaa	Well the only thing you can really do is go up to him and ask him.. Just try talking to him. Be like "hey I'm just wondering.. do you like me like more then a friend?" and I'm sure he probably does because I don't see why his friends would joke around about that saying that he does. So just try talking to him and maybe the reason why he hasn't asked you out yet if he does is because hes just really shy or you're not showing interest in him so hes probably thinking you don't like him like that. So yeah.. lol the only way to figure it out is communication.|`|ZA5zbcWoaa	ooh wot a tricky situation :S<br>  i think you should get him alone and ask him straight out " Do you like me?" then you'll know for sure, unless he lies!|`|hIkGU84daa	if they say he likes u they could be right just go to the guy flirt wit him and find out or have ur friend ask them. or ask him urself
N7gOE1btaa	It means one of two things.  <br>  1) He doesn't pay attention to lists like that and just places people wherever.<br>  2) She is #4 to him in some unknown ranking system.  Either he places them as top friends or people he likes the most.  <br>  It really depends on the guy, sorry but anyone with a specific answer who doesn't know him is lying to you.
df1beb28ec457339664195de5a03682caa	I was once in your position and got a hell of a wake up call one day when the girl i had been going out with suddenly asked me why i was hanging around her.This was in front of a couple of guys,one of whom she later moved in with. Dont wait for that to happen to you,get your life together and go forward.|`|7Tc4FdFoaa	i wasnt necessarily the best girlfriend either thats until he broke up with me in october<br>  because i would fuss and start fights over nothing in particular just because i knew he would be the one chasing after me<br>  i mean i didnt even have to try<br>  *girls love to be chased around !!*<br>  but like i said; when we broke up in october he changed from one day to another. i know someone got something in his head and well he listened to them and well what do you know. the tables turned and it was me chasing him around !!<br>  <br>  <br>  i stopped bothering him in january because i never felt so rejected in my life. i had never been turned down, and the only reason i chased him around so much was because he was my first serious relationship. i was just so attached and so much had happened between us and it didnt feel right to just throw it away just like that. you now how they say...its ok to lose your pride over someone you love. but dont lose someone you love over your pride though.<br>  <br>  but once he noticed i left him alone he started coming back around. we still dont talk everyday and hes not chasing me around or vise versa but i know he does care and i know he knows i do too. yea it can get frustrating and at times even desperate when you dont hear from them but the best thing is to just let things fall into place. but as long as you get your feelings across and clear to her (and sincere!!) dont just talk the talk !! you gotta walk it too. but dont give up so easily on love. its a beautiful thing :)|`|x1ByRFHXaa	okay bass,layer.im answering here.<br>  because i couldnt find anyother place that would<br>  let me answer youre question?haha. xD .<br>  do you have an email?and if so?email me.<br>  foreverfomin@yahoo.com<br>  that would be easier,yeah? (:|`|Go6OclcOaa	This is the same thing i did to my bf last year...<br>  We weren't getting along for like a year (we are now together 4 years) fighting constantly over eveything from money to what we were going to eat that night.  Well I was tired of things being the way they were with neither of us trying to change anything and I broke up with him.  For the whole 2 months we broke up he did nothing but try to win me back, which he finally did...I mean I needed time just to think about what I really wanted out of life and I also needed to know that I could do stuff on my own without having to depend on a man to help me.  I wanted to focus on myself.  BUT I couldnt keep making him hang on and wait around for me forever... <br>  She very may well still love you and miss you but that doesnt mean she still wants a relationship with you.  She is probably just trying to get you to realize how you treated her before you broke up and make you see that she is serious about you treating her better... <br>  SOOOO...keep showing her that all you want is for her to be happy (with or without you) and show her you are treaing her better  but just a tip IF she takes you back dont go back to treating her the same way you were before!!! And dont wait around forever bc thats not fair to you either, she needs to make up her mind I think you should talk to her and tell her how you feel...Good Luck!!|`|YfFFzOw1aa	at the moment i have a guy that said he loves me recently, but to be honest at this point in time i don't want a boyfriend because like your ex i would like to suss out my head so if anything goes wrong then i am only hurting myself. sometimes its just a bad time for relationships to work, but if you believe that you can be a good boyfriend and that you still want her just be patient and try and give her time to sort herself out. hope that helps. email me if you need anything. xx|`|n58MrASGaa	you have two choices..<br>  you can either keep going the way your going. just have a bit of patience if she says she needs time just give her that. but keep talking to her. maybe start talking to her more during the week<br>  or<br>  you can tell her how you feel. if your straight with her maybe shell realise she wants to be with you. girls find it sexy when a guy has the confidence to confront these things. and is she turns you down..it might be time to get over her.|`|IbeJgzeLaa	Continuing to do what you are doing while hoping for more isn't going to help your chances. I won't say she is using you, but I will say if you are looking for more this is not the way to go about it.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to be honest with her. Tell her what you want. It is better to let her know what your intentions are and for her to say no, than to continue the way you are--changed man or not.
woFMTx92aa	if shes hanging with you she could just be saying that she doesnt want a bf so that she doesnt make it obvious shes thinking of a relationship. she might actually mean it but i doubt it b.c it doesnt make sense to hang with your ex, she should know that theres a possibility that someone will have feelings for the other. anyway id just be there for her but subtly hint at a potential relationship if thats what you really want. i would not try using jelousy...sometimes its a turn off and you dont want to lose connection with her over a girl you never really liked in the first place. but if you do want to try making her jelous do it in a way that isnt threatening to tthe relationship you have with her right now...like casually mentioning that you and some friends are going out. and dont be there for her ALL the time. if you guys talk like everyday skip talking to her for a day and keep her wondering and thinking about you.<br>  these are just suggestions btw...i cant give you anything that i can guarantee will work since i dont know your history, relationship and a list of other things.you could always try the old fashioned way. wait for the right moment and just be honest with her. good luck :)|`|7Tc4FdFoaa	ok so not jealousy !! my ex is super jealous and its not ok. well it is but at a normal level you know. dont bother her a lot cause she'll think your annoying but be there enough so she knows your there for her and when she needs you !! she'll come back around eventually :)<br>  <br>  <br>  *patience is virtue|`|Qbm3Vpilaa	I think that you just being there for her shows her that you've changed that you've matured , you parted as friends so if you want a second chance don't rush in to asking  wait to understand the reason why you two are hanging out ,you may be getting to know each other all over again slowly....
UwEEHuRcaa	No he will do it again. After all, what he did to you was not just an unkind word said on the spur of the moment, he had a lot of time to make things right and didn't. Personally I would not forgive him, maybe religious people would. But don't go back, the bad history is already there.|`|AA11899313	It would seem that what he did to you was also done to the Other ...in his lies, behaviour etc.<br>  <br>  He may well have seen those errors in his ways and may be contrite and have mended his ways too.  How can we know the truth about him!<br>  <br>  How can we or even you know the truth unless you give him chance to prove himself ....which might mean he lands on his feet or his face at some point in the future.<br>  <br>  So, I wish you good luck with this ...him ...your choice.<br>  Sash.|`|tGcNmDUZaa	He abandoned you in your hour of need. He doesn't deserve a second chance.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	if i were you id stay away.  you are in law school...so obviously you are intelligent, and probably independent and able to have your pick of men.<br>  <br>  if you choose not to...date and take things slowly...make him prove himself, and no sex for a long time.  i would put up a wall and wait to see how comfortable i am able to feel with the guy...see how he acts and why he acts that way.<br>  <br>  its really your choice.  the safest is to ignore him...i know from watching other people that if a guy really messes up and comes back...it usually isnt right in the end.  I hav dated off and on before and the trust never fully comes back, and I relized that when i met the guy of my dreams, that kind of thing would not happen...it doesnt happen...|`|hTT8DhYfaa	what the heck is a shag? carpet??<br>  <br>  anyways... ummm no. he probably found some other satisfaction then got bored, and is coming back to you. <br>  <br>  once a man leaves you, he WILL leave you again.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck with a NEW and better man.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	DO NOT GET BACK WITH HIM!  I repeat, do not.  He is a bad person, and there are so many red flags going up on your question that it's obvious.  <br>  <br>  You still need to heal not only from the break up, but the miscarriage (and I apologize, but it probably was for the best in your case, as this man would never have been a good father).    What you need to do is ignore this man as much as humanly possible.  He will only hurt you again, and again and again.   <br>  <br>  Consider speaking to a professional about your grief, and your feelings so that you can get better and begin to truly move on.  Again, I am sorry that you lost the baby, but don't ever get back with this guy.  That's beyond stupid.|`|3tSLepEFaa	Keep walking you deserve better.|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	F**k him!! He is not worth your time sweetie. I am sorry to hear about your miscarriage, but am glad to hear that you have risen above it and carried on with your life. Good for you! Take time for yourself and forget men for a bit. Congrats on looking good!! lol|`|62viFod1aa	Yes people can change but that guys a piece of crap and not worth your time. You can do MUCH better. <br>  Good guys exist, we're out there you just have to be willing to look.<br>  Don't give this guy the time of day he doesn't deserve it!<br>  <br>  If he was worth anything he would have been by your side when you needed him, it should have been his top priority over all else.|`|SB7QOe1Baa	Sure, you could forgive him.......forgiveness is easy, but you'll never forget what he did.  If he really loved you he would've never done that to you to begin with.<br>  <br>  If you feel you should forgive him, then I say forgive him....but I would NOT take him back.  Cause it's obvious he doesn't really love you.|`|cfJywdN2aa	I would see how he Is and see If hes lying, Because I was in a relationship he dumped me then wanted me back when I had a bf so after I had no bf he wouldnt want me It was the same over and over, So just watch and see how he acts and stuff|`|jKCtxs5Uaa	People can change, but this is a pretty bad situation. If things are going good on ur own maybe u should stay away from him because it seem as if when he was around he only brought trouble. Make sure he has the right intentions and whatever u do take it slow because there seems to still be some trust issues.|`|kxmxJXEGaa	He is a liar and a guy who don't wear protection.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy the ugly drama of getting phone calls from women he gets pregnant then take him back. Your life will be full of them.<br>  <br>  He is a selfish little boy who don't care about you or anyone else. It's all about him.<br>  <br>  If you do go back to him then make him wear a condom and get on birth control. The last thing you need is a sexually transmitted disease or to get pregnant again.<br>  <br>  I know you can do better than this loser - I hope you know you can do better too.|`|leKt5XqSaa	Wow mama that's a sad story unfortunately i have a similar story to yours happen to me. My advice to you is not to take him back he hurt you and broke your hearth and its messed up that with everything you were going through he left you like that. Even if he has changed you accepting back into your life will just bring you back bad memories. Take time to heal your hearth and move on im sure there's better out there waiting for you someone who truly deserves your hearth and the love you have to offer them.|`|LlLFXL4Kaa	Honey I only read the first 2 lines of your question and I'm telling you that you DO NOT need to take that man back.<br>  <br>  What a loser.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you can find better:)
ycPz8K8jaa	If you were happy with the conversation you had with her, then that's a good sign.  Try not to overanalyze too much.  It sounds like she likes you if she accepted your date so enthusiastically.  Call her back today/tomorrow and set it up.

You are obviously addicted to some bad stuff.  Find support either from friends or professional and get out.|`|dhFgIFCraa	oh girl, i feel you... i was in the same about till about a couple of weeks ago.  Honestly, i caught him cheating more than once and it was all the same scenarios you just described.  I tried to look for some hope that he would change and it'll just be me, but history tends to repeat itself and it did.  It's a horrible feeling when you keep catching them.  I seriously think you should walk away, you'll keep getting hurt... i know it's easier said then done, believe me i'm still hurt and trying to get over it but i know there will be much greater happiness with someone else who truly wants to be with you and me.  And i know he's with someone else right now but still trying to keep me in the backburner... do you really want to be in that situation?  cause it seems that he is doing that to you too... when he finds someone else... you're done... don't let him hurt you like that... these little signs that you are finding you should listen... TRUST ME!!! Leave now!!
E4W6KxCMaa	Yes, but they rarely make the first move...good luck.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	I like younger men. But I'm not in your area. lol Truth be told, I don't discriminate based on age. My current bf is 26 years older than me, the one before him was 7 years younger.<br>  You can pick up older Lady's in the grocery store and random places like that. Just start talking to them. Or you can do what I did and start dating one of your friends parents.

Talk more than what you say to the girl. She might also realize that you like her.

M2Cx9uqzaa	you might wanna ask this in the music section, you would probably get more responses there|`|Nl64RmRWaa	Stay clear of the CD idea if you don't even know what music to put on it.<br>  <br>  Try making something else like a collage of pictures of you both together, a scrapbook, or a picture frame.|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	buy a strap on and **** him on his birthday...might not be fun for him....but definitely memorable...hahaha|`|hs8y6w1eaa	your in 6th grade, but you have been dating for a long time?
ymmrsEZ0aa	I had the same problem before. If he likes you,he will call you like everyday and ask where are you,what are you doing and so on. He would drop by your house to see you or maybe ask you out. You said that u are busy till that he thinks you got no time for him,so he decided to go out with another girl. So before he breaks ur heart to pieces, the best way is to tell your feelings about him face to face and tell him that u want to go out with him,not texting or sending notes,at least he knows that he likes you,maybe he'll forget about the girl that he dates and he will ask u out again. Dont write him notes cause it sounded like ur desperate for him. So,choose the perfect time for you to see him and make sure the other girl is not around. =)|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	well, maybe he likes you, but he got tired of getting the same answer: "NO", so he went out with a girl that actually said "YES".<br>  sorry, I think its you, not him.|`|dfmizsNYaa	i think you should go out with me ;)<br>  jus kidding..but seriously you should play harder to get and see what he does

g4nlUfmeaa	Sorry, I missed the question.<br>  <br>  I take it you're asking for advice on your general situation.<br>  <br>  First, try to stop looking at things in a way that emphasizes the things about yourself that you don't like, or are insecure about.  Don't think about your friends as being people who are beautiful, wear makeup, and are popular -- likewise, don't think of yourself as someone who is not those things.  Those are superficial qualities that really don't matter that much in a real friendship.<br>  <br>  Then all it boils down to is whether or not you think your friends are treating you fairly.  If they're not, you may be better off giving them the cold shoulder for a while, and seeking new friends.  And when you're being made fun of, whether it's by your "friends," guys or just other people, try not to let it show that it's bothering you -- and the best way to do that is to not even let it bother you.  I know it's difficult, but try to realize that the people around you are being childish -- the insults you're facing would probably hurt a mature adult about as much as you'd be hurt to be called a "do-do head" by an 4-year-old.   Insults hurt more when they come from someone you admire and respect.  Take the children around you the pedestal you've put them on, and realize that their acts are juvenile and cruel -- they don't deserve your respect, and it's not worth it to let them upset you.<br>  <br>  You don't have to descend to their level, and if you're not good at hurling juvenile insults, that's not anything to be ashamed of. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this is just what school is like (especially middle school -- high school probably won't be quite as bad).  All I can advise you to do is to try to find an activity you enjoy, a handful of friends that treat you well, and to try to get through what may be, socially, a rough time.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|qMnuRO50aa	Don't try to be like them, be yourself and people will like you for who you are. It sounds to me like you're trying to 'fit in', well if you can't then don't, no one likes a poser|`|v3VOtPu6aa	wow?  im sorry.....|`|xxEBY6x6aa	well first of all, if those girls were you're friends, thay would make fun of you. And who cares if they are allowed to wear makeup at 13? They probably look like clowns and since they probably wear makeup all the time..by the age of 20, they will look like those witches with wrinkles in their eyes. They are just ruining their face so dont worry about it...and dont think youre ugly...just because you arent allowed to WEAR it doesnt mean you can put some shiny lipgloss or cute chapstick that will bring out your lips =]<br>  <br>  and as for the guys, ignore them...guys are a bunch of idiots at this age...they are sooo whatever..dont worry about them..be yourself..and screw the other girls

That word means and says more than anything you've ever said in you're relationship.<br>  What did you want him to do? Abuse you? Call you names? No, he won't do that.

Its hard to let go of such strong feelings towards someone, as i know.<br>  i think it's best for you to somehow get your feelings across to this boy, tell him exactly how you feel and  ask him why did he do it to you.<br>  if you get no luck (as you said before) , then unfortunatly i think it's best to let go,<br>  even if it is very hard, but in this case i'm sure you can find someone much decent<br>  so yes, firstly try and get your point across, find out what his problem is and explain how he makes you feel.<br>  or leave it be, move on, either way will be hard, but it can be a life experience to learn from!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|XzzwDmDeaa	Okay so this guys obviously a jerk because he asks you not to talk to him and then when you demanded his attention he tells you he <br>  doesn't  want people to know. In my opinion all guys are sweet and nice you just have to find it so go out and play the field hun im sure theres tons of other guys for you that can be "different".

I sense that you are questioning the wisdom of this, but remember this: what's done is done.  You have made your choice and it very tough for you go do back and try to win him over, plus, this person might have just moved on.

9Kkf1RfTaa	Don't do it thats really just wierd. You should take her out for a nice dinner or something and get her some roses. Write her a little love note or something, but thats nasty that she wants you to lick her dirty feet haha. Just let her know how much you really do care in some other way thats more sanitary.|`|IyUr6GzGaa	no i would never make my man do that, its foul <br>  if you dont want to do that then dont she may get mad but she will egt over it eventually
Uj5kuzoJaa	First you need to be happy with who you are. Don't rely on a man to make you feel confident. Once you're happy with yourself, then it will be no problem to find a guy. Most guys are attracted to a confidence level. She could be super hot, but if she hunches her shoulders, barely ever smiles, and never makes eye contact then guys won't want to date her. Carry yourself proud. Stand up straight. When you catch someone eye, don't look away, smile and make the eye contact last. Try wearing makeup if you don't like your complexion. Minimal is always the way to go. Concealer, light eye shadow (Champagne by Cover Girl is my go to color), brown mascara, some light blush, and maybe some chap stick. It's amazing how that little bit goes a long way. <br>  <br>  Pay attention to the styles of clothing around you. What's popular at the moment? Do they wear Hollister? Go into Hollister and buy of the clearance rack. I NEVER buy things there unless they're on sale and no one ever knows lol I get colpiments on my clothing all the time. But make sure that you still make it your own. Add a cute accessory or hat or something that makes you stand out. Don't turn into a droid. <br>  <br>  Overall you need to make yourself happy, then you can deal with having a boyfriend.<br>  Hope this helps|`|177b82427498ae7807cb61bc6d21d5e7aa	Use what ever you've got, all your charms, don't be too pushy you can frighten a man off.

OtTE3UJ1aa	Don't let the fact that she hates you, deter you! It depends on what kind of a person she is, and why she hates you, find out her interests and use them in conversation, with her. Stick up for her, whenever you can, have nice manners around her, and be confident! And when you think you have a decent friendly relationship built up, you might consider asking her out. But if you're finding it difficult, and she still hates you, assuming she isn't a tuck-up snob who doesn't care about peoples feeling's, talk to her and ask her what can you do for her not to hate you. =) And good Luck...|`|OyjBR2e3aa	Just tell her you want to go out with her.

T75X8OLyaa	Been there, done that, have a collection of t-shirts in various sizes. <br>  <br>  Look, we all go through this at least once in our lives. You need to take your mind off him because, seriously, he's bad, bad news. He will bring you nothing but pain. He's using you. Do you hear me? HE'S USING YOU.<br>  <br>  He obviously has no respect for you or your feelings so you must not ever take him back or even be around him.<br>  <br>  You need to try new things. Go out with your friends. Try restaurants you've never been to. Go to the movies. Get out and try stuff you've never done before. Check out art galleries. Go to the zoo. Race go carts, Whatever it takes to get  you out and trying new things. <br>  <br>  Keep your eyes open for new guys, beter guys, someone who will treat you better. Boys don't like depressed emo girls so smile and laugh a lot. Don't be afraid to smile at boys you don't know. Who knows? Maybe they are nice?<br>  <br>  I have to admit, when this happened to me, I didn't have the energy to go out and try new things even though my friends coaxed me so, instead, I went to a hypnotist and she helped me forget the guy that broke my heart repeated. After just one session with her, I didn't care if he was dead or alive. It worked.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	move on first hang out with good friends and stop talking to him that don't help|`|2T49GGLKaa	the fact that this guy was the first guy you ever liked means that there will be someone else. it's rare that people ever marry and spend the rest of their lives with the first person that they ever liked, so just know that there is someone else that is perfect for you, and never stop looking for that person. you'll find them eventually. if this guy really liked you and missed you, he wouldn't have cheated on you. never, ever take him back, no matter how much you might want to.

Theres nothing to it really. If you just kind of want to do a quick kiss you pretty much just touch lips and then kind of like release or whatever. And then if you want to do like a makeout type thing. You kind of tilt your head and close your eyes and just like open and close etc. Its kind of hard to explain. But like, you will just know, My first time I didn't really know what to do but when it happened It was easy. Don't be scared by it. I hope I helped. :)

Sex changes things. How will you feel if he breaks up with you? You will always remember the guy you lose your virginity to. Is he worth it? How long have you two been together?

If there's evidence of the incident then give it to her, if not then just say that you were only holding a phone at the time and that there's nothing on it. Either way, You're "friend" is not really a friend at all and needs to learn from his mistakes....don't feel bad about that - he'll only get you in more trouble later when he actually hurts somebody and your around for it. Besides, lying won't do you any good anyways because the saying: "the truth always comes out eventually" actually is true. If you lie to your Dean and she finds out the truth anyways, she will be on your case even worse. If you tell her the truth, she'll think better of you and won't be quick to assume your involved in something bad. Besides, you'd get more satisfaction proving she's wrong about you because then without saying it she'd be admitting that she's a ***** for no good reason. Just tell her the 100% truth - it'll serve you and everyone involved for the better.<br>  <br>  p.s. tell her that you told your "friend" not to bring a knife because its just going too far and she'll probably start to have a little respect too.|`|TjAszHWYaa	tell the truth dont take the fall but if u can act like u wert there always ask who told u as a witness and act like ur wondering who <br>  but if all odds are agest you tell the truth dont take the risk

Strawberrys dipped in chocolate are  really nice for desert.|`|69v12qj5aa	do something for him that he would enjoy, something that he has only told you about, i guess|`|70fvxvj0aa	Headbutt him in the chest to show that you are fertile and ready to mate.|`|QZ1gAKFTaa	take him to a sporting event|`|KyOP56Xsaa	lol, this plan was alaways my romantic thing to do if we were really colse to each other. okay, so i'd go on a holiday with him, somewhere out in the country, when it is night go outside and lie on the fields with him together watching the stars, cuddle up to him and say the words "i love you" <br>  lol, sorry i got a bit carried away. =]<br>  <br>  or just go up to him and say i love you in a casual way. <br>  <br>  ~x~
UKYDpztQaa	most chicks would say you gotta tell her. but i really dont know. personally i wouldnt want to know. if you honestly are willing to change than i can almost say itd be better to just leave it alone.  this is where most would say that guys are scum but everyone makes mistakes. especially when youre drunk and arent thinking clearly.  **** happens. but with some its best to spare their feelings. it could come back to you later if she finds out and that would probably be 10,000 times worse. cuz you lied about it.  i totally see your dilemma here. you really dont know how she will react. she will be hurt for sure. but she might give you a chance to change. relationships usually dont last long if both arent honest with one another but sometimes you need to lie to protect the ones you love. its really your decision. you can risk it and be happy AT LEAST a little longer or you can tell her and most likely end it all today.  it would be the same reaction either way.
tyY3YA2Saa	youve gotta seem confident but not self obsorbed, and talk to as much boys as u can . they talk and u will come up and they'll be like OH HOT DAMMMMNNN  I KNOW WHO THAT FOXY LADY WAS!<br>  and wallaaa !|`|5YN5Dge9aa	Play hard to get.|`|PBsF8HaVaa	Wear a miniskirt.|`|yGPojfRAaa	Girl you got to break out of your shell, no matter how hard it is .

He could take a while.  Especially if he is afraid of rejection.|`|84zKeJxnaa	You should just talk to him about the whole situation and see what he says|`|oPRvq655aa	That's like me! <br>  I totally thought I was over this one guy I was dating, but then I realized that I still like him very much when he stopped talking to me.<br>  It's because when you don't talk to them as much anymore, you start to miss having them there or talking to them.<br>  <br>  Believe me, it takes well over a year to fully get over a guy. I'm still in the process of getting over one person, and it's been almost 4 years now. To get over someone, takes time and patience.<br>  <br>  You wouldn't know if your friends said something for sure unless you find out for yourself :)   just go up to them and ask them if they said anything.<br>  As for the kissing, I'd say kiss him whenever you are ready to do so, and when you feel the moment is best. Be sure that he is ready also, because you don't want to make him uncomfortable.<br>  It's really up to you to decide whether or not you want to wait for him to text you. Keep in mind that he might not text you, and it's always nice to be the first one to say something :)<br>  <br>  Yeah, friends can be no help at all and that's why we gotta do things ourself and have a little hope :)
gPeEdjmuaa	If you feel comfortable with taking the chance, then yes. I'm old-fashioned; too scared to ask any guy out, but if your not scared, go for it!

jTV6rLX3aa	Most girls don't have to do that. I think she feels really insecure/powerless and is trying to gain attention by any means necessary. You need to decide if you want to be with someone who plays your friends against you. You should also have a talk with her if you don't like this behavior. It isn't healthy.

xq6dnRuhaa	Well, rather than trying to make some guys that don't like you now (someone who likes you like that more than likely does it from the beginning or close to it not 2 months later) like you all of a sudden by changing something, how about finding one who likes you the way you are at the beginning. <br>  <br>  Besides, let's say, for example, you get more beautiful from now to tomorrow and one of these guys starts to like you out of a sudden. That's not probably what you are looking for because the change is not due to you, so if that new "prettiness" is gone so will be his sudden attraction. You want someone who finds you interesting/pretty from the beginning without you having to force things into them.<br>  <br>  I believe this is why I have such a hard time finding a gf, reason is I look for someone I like, who likes me back, and who also I am compatible with (i.e. a girl that needs partying every weekend would be a dumb choice, since that's not my style; and it seems like my college lacks pretty [notice I am not saying beautiful] SINGLE smart girls who are actually looking for someone .....).<br>  <br>  And I can understand you, but the key really is to meet NEW people that are compatible with you. That is the best way to increase chances of meeting someone who does like you the way you are. Keep an open mind though because no one is perfect, so figure out your priorities and put them first. I just look for a woman that is educated, a little pretty at least (average), nice, likes me, smart if possible, with a nice personality (as in drama-free) ..... and that's it.|`|9e1fb02b9a4c8da22e2bc01755705b33aa	"Hot" women are more in the Pam Anderson mold. Usually tall, and so skinny that they look anorexic, but with impossibly large breasts. They also don't smile a lot.<br>  <br>  If you are more petite, and have a more "smiley" or happy demeanor, then you are more likely to be cute.|`|QZEDisIsaa	Be happy to be cute.  Cute=relationship.

Just use what you've got =)<br>  <br>  Cute is kind of an appeal to be intimate with someone - to hold them or to be held by them, to kiss and hug them<br>  <br>  Hot is pretty much a purely sexual appeal, women who look "hot" typically are only looking for sex.  If you really want to be "hot", things to do include, bleaching your hair, wearing skimpy clothing, and flirting gratuitously.

I would like call jerry springer lmao it seems like something that would be there... thats how wrong this is to me|`|koAaPXKQaa	That's just wrong... If he's your dad's brother, he probably looks like your dad (I know my dad and his 5brothers all look really similar) which is just wrong in my opinion.

My parents didn't agree either, but I straight out told them that I'm an adult and that they can't control where I live anymore. I've been living with my boyfriend for almost 2 years now, even though there are more conflicts than usual, it's been fun. I think you should go for it.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	if you are an adult and can live without their financial support you have to do what is best for you they will get over it|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Don't go anywhere until you have finished college.

4ESlizXraa	Oi, my wild years were 18-23 or so, when I was going to college and joined a sorority and all the parties that went along with that.  Just about the time that was cooling down I turned 21 and could drink in the clubs (legally now) so that kind of boosted it back up.<br>  <br>  After college, however, I had to join the work force and having to look professional at 8 am tends to deter the partying until all hours business so it tapered off at the point for sure.<br>  <br>  I'm 28 now and sometimes on the weekends I go out with my friends and we get a little wild still, but not like we use to.  Too many of us are married and have children and responsibilities now.<br>  <br>  Those times are what they are, a learning experience that you eventually mature beyond.
AA11263103	*Wait for the right moment.*<br>  There’s usually no hurry for a kiss, especially a first kiss with someone, so be patient and wait until the mood is right. Some good times are at a romantic movie after or during an on screen kiss, walking in the moonlight, or during a particularly intimate conversation. Wait until the two of you are alone so that the other person will feel more comfortable and so that nobody will see if your attempt to kiss is rejected. Many girls (and guys) don't want to be asked: they prefer that you be confident enough to take a risk and just go for it. One way to do so is to stop whatever you’re doing and silently look into the person’s eyes for a moment or two. Touch their face, then gently pull him/her toward you for a kiss. If the person pulls away or hesitates at any time, he or she is not ready for a kiss. If this happens, tell them that you want to give them a hug and go for that.<br>  <br>  *Approach for the kiss.*<br>  Approach slowly and smoothly. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partner’s body or head into position—you just want to guide his or her movement a little, you don’t want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable position—but in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partner’s lips, maintain eye contact. You may want to close your eyes after your lips meet to heighten the sensuality of the kiss (and to avoid staring at the pores on his or her face).<br>  <br>  *Kiss gently.*<br>  There are many kinds of kisses, from quick pecks to sweet, passionate kisses. There’s a time and place for all of these, but your first kiss with someone should be gentle and romantic. Don’t press your mouth onto your partner’s--just let your lips meet--and don’t try to push your tongue into his or her mouth. When your lips meet, pucker them and give a kiss, then smile and pull away a little, keeping your head close to your partner’s. If your partner moves to kiss you back or seems to like it and doesn’t pull away, go in for another kiss, this one a little firmer and longer. Put your hands on their face or around their shoulders.<br>  <br>  *Make the kiss the reason for the kiss.* <br>  Some people seem to treat kisses as nothing more than a prelude to something else, and will try to quickly move into French kissing. Good kissers concentrate on the kiss, and they kiss, at least seemingly, expecting nothing more. Enjoy the experience, and don’t move too fast. Live in the moment. You will not kiss as well if your mind is somewhere else. For example, when kissing, try to avoid thoughts like "What is he/she thinking about?", "Do I look good tonight?", or anything else. Don't be too self-conscious, or have ANY thoughts outside the kiss if you can help it. Instead, concentrate on the way the other person's lips feel against yours.|`|Xz9Ck3OFaa	You don't "make it".<br>  <br>  You wait and let it happen!<br>  Don't rush romance!<br>  It doesn't work that way ;)|`|qT17PgAuaa	go walking in the park or something and pretend to fall.<br>  <br>  or you can like "trip" and when he catches you look up and kiss him

7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	In relationships, people argue about the same things that friends do, but everything carries extra meaning.  Something said off the cuff will suddenly be taken by one person to have a whole different meaning.<br>  <br>  Most relationships end up arguing over a few basic things, though.  Money, sex, each other's friends, time spent and how, one person's unwillingness to comprimise, etc.<br>  <br>  If you are arguing all the time, it's time to look at *why* you are arguing all the time.  Is it because the friendship is going sour, or is it because each of you feels you have to win each argument, or what.<br>  <br>  But couples that argue all the time are a real downer, especially to their friends.|`|UhqwmGLvaa	The toilet seat argument|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	well since she is a girl.....or you are....expect the stupid irrational kind at least every month
5OLj2qpbaa	Since he is leaving, don't set yourself up for more hurt by falling deeper. You may however, tell him that you would like to keep in touch, and ask for an email address. Then, do not over do things, just keep things friendly. Since he is a Christian, be sure to keep things on this level.<br>  Who knows, in a couple of years..|`|ec2b1a1c9534c53c26c3b18b2f00d42aaa	awww bbygrl :) fall in love eh ? I'm a Christian too FYI. <br>  <br>  Anyway, do this....show some hint to the guy, then pray about it, and keep praying until "hopefully" God will answer it or give you a "guidance" to move forward. After all this, tell him by email or text him or call him for hang out in the afternoon or something after class. If he keep rejecting your offer more than TWICE, then he MIGHT not interested in you. Hey at least you try, right ??<br>  <br>  Don't do what my friend did, keep saying "What if the guy don't like me ?" , "what if he say mean things to me ?", "What if this....what if that?"...way too many "WHAT IF", and didn't get anything in the end. <br>  <br>  Pray about it and let God decide which one is best for you :) BUT if God say NO, that means NO and don't be discourage either, there is a perfect one for you out there :)<br>  <br>  Good luck !!!|`|PVFRP0Ztaa	Ok, so the right thing to say here is to 'tell him how you feel'<br>  ....but... i know i probably wouldnt do it because if you know he isnt looking for a girlfriend, then why would you bother?<br>  I mean, he is about to leave for college and far away too, so that would discourage me also.<br>  If you have the courage to tell him before he leaves, then go for it, but do realize that its going to hurt either way because he is leaving!
dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Two words "Kama Sutra"<br>  Do you think the people that gave us that would be faithful?|`|an1EMiFkaa	They are common everywhere, duh!!!|`|AA10408380	From what I hear it is. But if u stray from perfection, it's bad, so no one will ever admit straying on their partners. It has nothing to do with women working either. It has to do with ppl wanting something other than what they have at home. It could do with a lot of issues, like variety, lack of intimacy, lack of experimentation, etc. In the old days, women never spoke of such things if their men went astray, and most men went to prostitutes, but now with more women out and about, men may not need prostitutes. ANd since women are in the work place now, they too might find their husbands less than appealing and stray, as before, they wouldn't think of such things do to economics and religion, but now, everyone just wants to be happy, no matter the cost to anyone.|`|HAk6iROaaa	Yes, when I lived in India I was able to see this for myself, it is highly common, but the thing is it's done in a very quiet secretive manner, so people would not suspect but it is rife. Today people will go outside of marriages, no matter what the caste or class. People want gratification and will go anywhere to find it. Strangely enough, I found this to be quite prevalent in Rajasthan of all places, where I thought old traditions and customs were intact. Not so my friend. One only has to go deeper, know the right people, and you can find out a whole underworld of stuff that is quite startling....|`|WYgHniyXaa	It is not so.  They are however increasing due to various factors such as increased involvement of women in social life etc. This is more   prevelant in metros than smaller cities.

Best of luck.|`|fglMx3UDaa	No its not but through media , opinion poll and others extra marital affairs are made common in india just to insult women n men of India.leaving a few so called progressive thought persons it is still a taboo in india.

ycPz8K8jaa	It sounds like you don't like being told what to do, and that maybe you feel a bit like you're being "parented" in this situation.  Even though you subconsciously know she's right, you want to rebel against someone trying to steer you in a different direction.  It sounds like she really cares about you, but you need to decide if what she is asking of you is really the right thing, and something that you can attain, or if she is unrealistic in her expectations and asking too much of you.  If you know deep down that she is right, then what are you afraid of?  Success? Failure?  If you don't like the person that she wants you to be, then tell her so.  If she accepts you for who you are, she'll stick around.  If not, f it, you could do better anyway.<br>  <br>  Take a peek at my question:  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309104244AAu7Gwe&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|AA11170237	You are valuing your girlfriend based on what others think of her, not how you feel about her.

It's easy to live in a fantasy world we make for ourselves, it's nice there because we're in control of it. But such a place does not exist, she's helping you see that, and I think it pisses you off more that she is the one indirectly making you realize it. No one's perfect guy, not you, not her either, but are you perfect for each other? Does she bring out the part of you, you always wished you could? If so, that's why you're suffocating. It's hard to accept others' help esp when it concerns yourself. But it sounds like she's done a lot for you, keep her dude. <br>  <br>  <br>  ***Most importantly***, end this question and talk to her about this. I've found there are 4 things that make a relationship work; trust, honesty, communication and compromise. Take any of them away and, well, you can't sit on a three legged chair.

pvZZ9Jzmaa	both are important...but in 60 years, I do not think this will matter much anyway.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Different is different.  You spoke nothing of personalities, which shows your own shallowness.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Neither. Cheating has nothing to do with an individuals looks. If that were the case, then all men would be cheating because, no matter what, there will always be a more attractive person out there. The man who cheated is a scum bag who doesn't know how to treat a woman.|`|t81MEJ82aa	That's a juvenile outlook. It doesn't sound like you've ever been seriously involved with a woman, but men are attracted to other women regardless of how attractive or unattractive their wives are. People cheat for a variety of reasons. For a man to have sex, a woman only need be attractive enough. What's more important, body vs. face, depends on individual preferences.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	It's irrelevant.  You could take the most beautiful face in the world and attach it to the most erotic body in the world, and men would still want to look at other faces and other bodies.  We like variety in what we look at.  Cheating is way less dependent on any physical aspect than it is upon commitment, honor, and self-discipline.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Body is more important for both men and women.

Stop trying to find an excuse for his infidelity.|`|AA11328507	It doesnt matter what the guy has a home...cheating is something people do when they are selfish and have someone willing to be selfish with them.  Hell man Halle Berry got cheated on--she is beautiful and rich.  Cheating is SO much deeper than looks.|`|AA11437235	what is more important in the marriage is if you love the person, and nothing else matters, butt, body, hair, fat legs... ect.<br>   <br>  plus men dont only cheat with hot beautiful women... they cheat what what makes them feel good at the time.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	It's really whats inside that is important.

I never let my man hang with girls at all. He should have that time for me :D He feels the same way. If she can make time for her male friends, then she can make time for you. I have this guy on Facebook and he has more pictures with this one chick from his college then he does with his own girlfriend. He never sees her, but has the time to get drunk with all these chicks and takes pictures. She should make the time and effort to be with you. If she doesn't then she doesn't deserve to be with you.|`|Q7DXrxMTaa	you need to find out what she thinks abotu you two staying together despite not being a couple. <br>  <br>  FInd a day to talk to her alone and tell her that you miss her and that you do love her but you don't know if even that makes it worth never seeing her.<br>  <br>  YOu never know mate, maybe its time to move on :/<br>  <br>  But you might find that she loves you too and this will be enough to keep the relationship going.

JhvqUvlsaa	Why are you friends with her? She sounds like a horrible person to be friends with. I think you should dump her and go find someone else. She's very immature and no wonder you are getting headaches. You can find much better friends to hang out with that will treat you much better. The next time you see her tell her you can't be friends anymore. I know it's going to be hard and she's going to cry but you have to treat yourself better than this too.

YSRXarooaa	if you are naming your child don't you think you should kinda think of your own name. I mean you are supposed to name it after something in your life so that the name will have significance and meaning. So when your child grows up then you can tell them the story of their name. Not say "oh I found your name on yahoo answers because I thought it was cute." Then it won't mean anything it'll just be a name. but if you are not naming something living then I am sorry.|`|sY53Iwiiaa	Girl: Emma<br>  Boy: Nathaniel|`|kOoCya9Oaa	4nuk8|`|jVSFz2xOaa	jayden, caiden, ariella,|`|kTZevQNHaa	Serafin<br>  Serena<br>  Mayberry<br>  Willow<br>  Sorona<br>  <br>  Armin<br>  Viktor<br>  Octavio<br>  Augustus<br>  Horatio<br>  Reinhart<br>  Ludvik|`|5qvIZCKXaa	Blair for a girl :) <br>  or Blake for a girl :) <br>  or Merritt for a girl :)|`|shcsbtbYaa	Girls: Elle, Ella, Belle, Isabella, Rose, Rosalie, Portia, Miaa <br>  <br>  Boys: Julius, Shazz, Omar, Kurt, Emmett, Edward, Derek, Jasper...<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck <3|`|sBJtxJG9aa	boys-Boston, Beckham, Rasheem, Taj, Devon, Betty, Bengamin<br>  Girls- Naveah(heavan backwards), Natalia, Oneia, Jodali, Natai, Matt, Amelia|`|LkA4FkMZaa	Girl: Alessia<br>  Boy: Saverio<br>  <br>  both Italian Names which i would like to name my children as<br>  <br>  The boy name is after my grandad<br>  The girl name is after my middle name which i chose for my confirmation name<br>  <br>  both names are saint names<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|BsDv3k5iaa	Mary Anne|`|G9wEDvedaa	Travis, Colton, Ryder<br>  Brooklyn, Kennedy, Winter, <br>  <br>  i hope this helped :)|`|Sofk2yO8aa	If i ever have a daughter i'll call her Aisha or Ann-Elise|`|16HN5H3Maa	Jackson and Noah for a boy.<br>  Elizabeth, Olivia, or Mary for a girl.|`|mMByiHaQaa	Boys:<br>  Charlie<br>  Mitchell<br>  Dylan<br>  Zac<br>  Bradley<br>  Troy<br>  Harvey<br>  <br>  Girls:<br>  Grace<br>  Ellie<br>  Michelle<br>  Stacey|`|7CO8JoMdaa	Adam<br>  Jessica|`|kKG3C103aa	For a girl:<br>  <br>  - Lilly<br>  - Lucy<br>  - Lisa <br>  - Alisa<br>  - Isabella / Bella<br>  - Chelsea<br>  - Roxane/Roxii<br>  - Selena<br>  - Claire<br>  - Carla<br>  - Carly<br>  - Lauren<br>  _Tanya<br>  <br>  For a boy:<br>  <br>  - Edward<br>  - Nicolace / Nick<br>  - Jacob / Jake / Jay<br>  - Liam<br>  - Nathan<br>  - Peter<br>  - Oscar<br>  - Thomas<br>  - Joel  <br>  <br>  :)|`|ZyfilGjFaa	lauren.......lyndsay...........logan.......|`|kwaYWYzSaa	Girls:<br>  <br>  Hayden<br>  Adrielle<br>  Amberlyn<br>  Brooklyn<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  Noah<br>  Jake<br>  McNeel<br>  Keagen (Kee-gun)<br>  Keston( Kess-tun)|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	i named my daughter Farah Jolie , beautiful huh? classy but different.

7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	Yes, it does, and in some ways, no, it doesn't.  Why?<br>  <br>  Yes, it feels more intense to not wear a condom.  There's a level of intimacy that just isn't there with a condom, because when both parties feel there isn't a need, it is the ultimate in trust.<br>  <br>  But, a condom can also makes things better by making the guy less sensitive, so you both can enjoy the ride longer, especially if it's been a while.  And, by having the condom, there is less to worry about due to the lessening the chance of both pregnancy and STDs.  That enhanced peace of mind can really help things.<br>  <br>  It depends on the situation.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Without of course!!!!|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	With a woman ... rubber is optional !|`|yCBpl2Jgaa	WITHOUT!!!!!!!! but yes it stops pregnancy and infections but pregnancy can be stopped with other contraceptions. xx|`|71ZX8wUbaa	offcourse w/out a rubber otherwise its imaginery sex...be sure yr partner is without any infects..|`|Z85wrUObaa	yes it does. but condoms + safety from kids and infections|`|i5xByO9naa	for me with rubber because i know in not running a risk.|`|OULaAcOjaa	It feels the same to me!

Wt9spVopaa	basically he doesnt know how to act in person around you because your relationship has been in text messages, it makes sense that things would go great in text messages because he has time to think about what hes going to say next, in person there isnt that lapse of time for either of you to make sure you arent offending eachother or to make sure what your saying is the right thing, especially when your flirting...my advice to you is to hang out with him outside of school a lot more, suggest going out to play mini golf (my favorite!) or some other kind of activity-based date, because if you just go out to dinner, neither of you will know what to say to eachother and it will just be awkward. once you have gone out on theses activity based dates for a while, then you can start going to dinner and movies, because by then youll know eachother a lot better and youll know what to say to eachtoher. dont feel offended that he doesnt know how to act around you, it doesnt mean that he doesnt like you or is emberrassed to be around you, it just means that he doesnt know what to say because he is used to text messaging. texting is sooo informal and impersonal that its difficult to have a relationship through just that form of communication. talking to him about it was a great idea, but he obviously has some communication issues that he needs to work out.<br>  i hope i could help! let me know if you need any more advice.|`|7S92b2ZAaa	I get the impression yuo don't see each other much out of school?<br>  Maybe see him more out of school to develop a stronger relationship with him.<br>  I have a boyfriend that i met in school, and we never suffered from the 'going off with his friends' because we have the same group of mates, but with past boyfriends I've had this and i know it can feel as though he is choosing them over you but, usually it's because lads don't need as much attension as girls do...and a lot of lads don't realise they are doing it! <br>  but yeh, go to the cinema or ice skating for some bonding!|`|Qsypk0BNaa	maybe hes scared to let ppl know ur together<br>  id break up with him, i couldnt take that<br>  <br>  mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ak8glhnOVunic7YvV2BINhYSxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309112529AAJWNvJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ScOVQvZEaa	If your willing to open yourself up like a flower to him and he's not and is going to be dismissive thant just leave him. <br>  You sound nice, If you where my girlfriend (i'm 15) I would ALWAYS acknowledged you and greet you and please you and entertain you. <br>  If he's gonna string you along like a piece of meat, than just "text" him : <br>  Hey, things aren't going like I wanted so it would be best if we moved on."

Most girls know that they won't be as physically attractive to a guy with a bald head.  It's common sense.  Should you break up with her over it?  If this is a temporary thing and you really love her, then no.  If she is considering going permanently bald, then this will be a huge issue between you two.  She will have to respect and understand your issues with baldness.  Just tell her.<br>  <br>  Take a peek at my question:  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309104244AAu7Gwe&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|PBQmmDZeaa	i would be straight up about it. don't beat around the bush about it at all the best way to get to a person is to be 10000% honest and i'm sure she's just kidding with you, unless she enjoys doing crazy stuff like that... but be honest.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	Be honest with her, tell her how you truly feel. And explain in full detail why you feel that way.|`|785663ec8f461cfe017e3e97c97926acaa	Be honest with her and tell her exactly what you just wrote here. I'm sure she will reconsider once she hears your feelings about it. Good Luck! :)|`|AA11197454	tell her to go above the influence and she's beautiful the way she is.|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	dude tell her she better not....damn my girl friend wanted to....and I layed down the law.....I was like, baby , I know your pissed at me, but if you shave your head I will be pissed....|`|vBcqzMz4aa	Tell her what you just said..|`|9c1N7skCaa	tell her to not shave her head|`|Di6FAQxRaa	I think this is a serious issue u need to talk to ur girl about. Say " hey can i talk 2 u, ive had a serious issue with people especially my mom because she had cancer back in the days and she had to go bald. I brought this up because i know u want to shave your head. I just get bad feelings wen i see people with bald heads- even men. So please do not shave your head", also its a big turn- off for me because of the past experience i had"....... i think if you tell her about your past experience then shell understand., if she likes u alot then she would change her mind and most importantly, she will understand. So tell her now b4 its too late. Also, why the hell would a girl wanna shave their head? thats brittany spears weird !
gAC4QY7gaa	Yeah it'll go away if you are not that shallow.|`|Nl64RmRWaa	If you truly care for him, then after a week or so you'll be able to look past it and go on with the relationship with how it was before. It seems like you care more about his looks than the relationship as a whole.. This happened with me back in 9th grade. My boyfriend cut his hair so short that he looked like a complete nerd - I even cried he looked so awful. But after a few days I got over it because he was still the same person. So just deal with it if he's worth it.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	wow...reallly?<br>  <br>  look its just hair...hair grows.<br>  <br>  have you ever cut your hair in the past year?<br>  <br>  what if you did...what if he didn't like it and didn't have sex with you because he thought it looked weird?<br>  <br>  sex isn't about looks...hes the same man on the inside...hes not a stranger.  so he looks different...what if he lost weight because he was sick or got cancer...would you never have sex with him becuase he looked different?<br>  <br>  i think that this is just feelings coming up that you feel like hes not the right guy.  in the 3  (almost 4) years that my bf and i have been dating we have both cute our hair and made drastic changes.  i went form long to shoulder length to long to chin length...and he went from long and spikey to long and down to cut shorter and spikey to long and down to buzzed short...ect...<br>  <br>  some i didnt feel were as attractive as others...but those changes were so superficial that it didnt make me feel any differetn about hima s a person.<br>  <br>  after a year...feeling that way...is BAD...and thats just pointing to underlying problems that you have...|`|FCkoG7ocaa	uh thell him the truth even though my friends think you are shallow<br>  but my b/f has long hair too and i think if he cut his hair i would but kinda like you :D|`|AA11349925	Just think about others who have it worse off then you, then you will be grateful for what you have!|`|ibeVcQyWaa	I find this very pathetic.

He's not worth it.|`|gPdj4lCuaa	You should tell her that he is being unfaithful but do not go after her boyfriend. She is going to be devastated, but show her that she can trust you, even with an unfaithful boyfriend. If this boyfriend is being unfaithful to her, he will be unfaithful to you, maybe even with one of your own friends. Ditch the guy and keep your friend!|`|HnkGP8v5aa	yess you should tell her, considering your like her bestfriend, shed be much happier to know, than find out and be like " omg you never told me " and there would be a chance of loosing her due to that :/ <br>  hope his helps x

AA11501437	honey, love is a risk.  it just is.  there are no guarantees, no promises, and no warranties.  you have a 50 / 50 chance of it working.  some people are worth the risk even if it fails...and some are not.  it's just part of the deal.  you could do a background check, get a credit report, obtain a brief mental history, and talk with his family and friends to try and foresee if there will be future issues...but that would take away all the fun and you'd still have a 50 / 50 chance of things working out.  that being said - when it works out, its a pretty amazing thing...and well worth the risk.  when it doesn't work out...usually, we learn something in the end - and have some killer memories out of the deal...and it was still worth the risk.  good luck.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	There are no guarantees in any relationship.  Could he fall out of love with you...of course there's that possibility.  But why torture yourself over all the "what ifs"?  Give this guy a chance and don't compare him with your ex.  Try to look on the bright side of things and stop focusing on what MIGHT happen.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	Youre either nervous that your current boyfriend will do the same thing to you, or you are wondering if your ex is ever coming back.
iYAUq0DWaa	Nah its not.Sometimes guys are way more easy going than girls I have a close guy friend who I dated before but now we have great chats and just hang out with other people in a relaxed group environment.Its brillaint theres more guys though only 3 girls lol but like Its much better than a load of bitching and poisonous friends.Do whatever you want,hang out with whoever you want and you should never have reason to quesiion your motives<br>  x|`|yDGwCH3Waa	That's exactly how I am.<br>  Who cares as long as you like the friends that you do have.<br>  Maybe become friends with a girl or two that your guy friends are friends with that way you will all have mutual friends & hang out more often. Hope I helped =]|`|sX2oWidkaa	Nope. Everyone has their own "types" of people that they get along with best... and types they don't get along with, of course. <br>  There's only so much you can do about it. If you're all enjoying yourselves and not causing or receiving negative impacts in the relationship, then who cares?<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what girls you're talking about... There are jerks and "great" people of all walks of life.<br>  Anyway, if there's a friendship to be had with a girl it'll happen at some point if you both build it up.|`|AA11622926	No that's not bad. girls are dramatic, guys aren't.

NE way e-mail me^^ we could chat XP|`|0231d2843faa4847a6c7ee14ea2b73f5aa	Does your parents take you to church?  If they do, that's one way to make friends.  You also can get out and go for a walk in your neighborhood, (that's if you don't live out in the middle of no where) which is a good way to hopefully meet people who live around you.  Find an activity that interest you like swimming, soft ball, martial arts which have kids your age and sign up.|`|B4kf9jDGaa	go to a church, go to a youth group, just go out and see if neighbors have kids|`|V1FuXBYraa	Join recreational sports.<br>  That's what I did.|`|YYdtd47baa	You could meet your neighbors, join a youth group, participate in sports, join groups such as Art Clubs, Pottery Clubs, things like that. It's easy, and if your parents have any friends with children in the city, then meet them and maybe one of them will turn out to be worth something! Ha ha, i'm sure you'll make friends if you don't stay home all the time, you can make a friend just about anywhere.

Next, stay away from that guy, he clearly has no respect for you or his girlfriend. So yeah, you can keep letting him do that but you are just going to be his little whore and nothing more,|`|CbRr3upaaa	So he has a girlfriend? Talks dirty to you so bad your friend wants to puke. And while he has a girlfriend he touches you? and you like him??<br>  <br>  Sounds like a winner to me, get him to break up with his current girlfriend and get pregnant with his children ASAP.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	hes just a player..... dont get near him i did and i got hurt in the end... believe me you dont wnat a broken heart....|`|YCSGSlXkaa	If he is disrespecting his current girlfriend by making moves on you, why wouldn't he do the same if you guys got together?  It doesn't matter where the girlfriend lives or if your friend likes him, he just is someone who doesn't care whose feelings get hurt as long as he gets what he wants.  Caveat emptor.|`|GDhKmSYxaa	wow sounds to me like he wants you. and if you want him then wait till ur friend and him break up i guess idk.|`|FiU2G8qbaa	learn english please|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	I suspect he is looking around for someone new. Give him a hint and see what happens.|`|hE6Z93Ysaa	Sori, I can't read your post.
YCSGSlXkaa	Sometimes people confess not because they feel they owe it to the other person, but because they want to feel better about what happened.  Sometimes people fudge details at the beginning of a relationship.  It's not the end of the world, although yeah, it sucks when you're hearing about it so much later.<br>  <br>  As for the cheating part, it sounds like it was a one (well, two) time thing, and he regrets it and doesn't want to do it again and wants forgiveness.  Can you forgive him?  Maybe you can and maybe you can't.  It's certainly not the worst relationship transgression I've ever heard, but then again the way you respond to it depends on the state of your relationship.  You're certainly not going to get over it today, especially if you just found out, but give him some time, let him kiss your @$$, and see how you feel.<br>  <br>  A drunken, early-relationship slip up is a lot different than serial, emotionally meaningful affairs, but it depends on the situation.  Like I said, give it some time and see how you feel.  If you really can't get past it, maybe it just means the relationship has run its course?|`|1JU8gJ7jaa	i dunno. when it happened to me and my man cheated on me i broke up with him and we stopped talking then he text ed me and tried to get me back and told me he loved me and it would never happen again so i forgave him and i didn't take him back but were just friends.. but he is still persistent and wants me back.. you should leave him and se what happens teach him a lesson if he really cares for you he wil be back|`|YYAUr8t9aa	Dump him
4j2P6YFhaa	gosh, this must be so annoying and embarrising for you. you need to show some emotion in front of his as maybe that will teach him for messing you around. first of all, sit down and talk to him. this is more effective than it sounds. tell him that you are not just some pet of yours you show off the tricks for, you are his son. ask for respect and show him that when you grow older, you won't be around as much and he should treasure the time he has left. show your frustration and anger, and if that really doesn't work, then i suggest if you be a really good kid - help around the house, come home on time etc, then he has no reason to shout at you. but just be quite blank with him. don't tell him how school was. say yes and no answers and when he is speaking just listen but don't give too much opinions of your own. <br>  soon he should get the point and realise you are not enjoying the relationship between you two. good luck and i hope your dad understand and can change.|`|NZVP15Soaa	there is something sadistic about your father -his fetish is baring your backside - he winds you up goading you so he can hit you- you have got to be careful that he doesn't go too far - he wants stopping - you are 15 for goodness sake it's quite sick that he does this - yes he is bullying you - if there is a teacher you can talk to -you have got to tell them what is going on - no one should put up with this please don't think you do just because you love him -it's a sick love on his part<br>  as you get older because he's a bully your life will be hell when you start courting do something <br>  <br>  take care|`|RoyvUWl7aa	gosh I'm so sorry to hear that. I have a 3 year old daughter and I would FLIP if her father EVER treated her like that.<br>  I don't know what to tell you....except tell someone at school...there may be a school counslor that can help you. abusive? kinda!
wcuQIZQUaa	www.meetup.com has lots of groups that you can join, covering different interests, and who meet up regularly.  It is bound to have something you enjoy doing and which is fairly local to you.|`|T9ItAmhIaa	I believe that there are a few things that we adults need to do in order to be able to make good friends. After doing them, we can start the actual search for those friends. Let me explain ...<br>  <br>  First, I think that we need to decide what we want from our friendships. (Someone to go to movies with, someone to travel with, someone to get coffee with, someone to share deep secrets with ... we all want something different.)<br>  <br>  Then I think we need to make a serious commitment to investing time in new friendships because if we aren't committed to that then there's not much point in even trying to make new friends.<br>  <br>  Once we've figured out what we want and committed to getting in, there are many ways to make new friends. This includes connecting with people online and then taking those friendships offline. This could mean connecting via social networking sites and blogs or through sites like Meetup.com or Craigslist.<br>  <br>  Another way to make new friends is to make a list of anyone you've met that you would like to be better friends with. For example, remember your co-worker's sister who came in and seemed kind of cool? List all of those people and then invite them to hang out and see if things click.<br>  <br>  Classes can be a good way to meet people as can events that you attend. If you aren't successful it that, try to pinpoint why that is. Are you able to put yourself out there and start up conversations? Do you know how to ask people out as friends? If not, those are skills that can be developed to improve the likelihood of making new friends.<br>  <br>  But basically, you just have to put yourself out there, keep trying to make plans with people and then let things develop naturally. Focus on one or two new people at first for developing a friendship so you don't spread yourself too thing. It takes time, but it'll happen.|`|YYdtd47baa	I've never been in your situation. This is just my advice as an outsider.<br>  High School reunion(s) maybe? You could go out, and see who's out there, maybe you would settle down yourself. If that's something you might want. Do you have a boyfriend? Join clubs, or volunteer, if you like those sort of things, and you'll find people with common interests just like you. Do you have a facebook? You can re-connect with people you haven't spoken to in "forever," maybe that could help. You can always not go out, and spend time in, with your friends with children and families and see what their life is like - maybe it's not so bad. Hope all goes well.|`|Dzt5qcadaa	To make new friends you can talk to other friends that you have and see if their friends will want to hang out with you. You can also make a myspace or facebook account and say ur just looking for friends. Just be yourself and sooner or later someone will notice you and want to be ur friend! ~hope this helps! sorry if its a little confusing!~|`|XKokld1Gaa	Spend less time on networking sites. etc.....<br>  <br>  Most people are loosing friends due to spending too much time on Facebook etc..
3jqcLj7Saa	You should never have to pursue a relationship and sadly enough yes to your question most guys think they have to impress their friends and act cool I guess is the word. It's too bad but by time they get old enough to realize they do not have to they are married and have children. But yes to your question. And if you like him he is worth you time.

I have not been separated.|`|GfGRj3Y0aa	have not been separated|`|lzooHi0Baa	Of course there is a difference.  It saves the man from paying a prostitute and the woman from cooking.   This way, since there is no commitment, and you do not have to fake love, sex will be more exciting.|`|MYU46ap5aa	Yes, but it only complicates things.  You two should think bout whether you want to get back together or stay apart without the sex.  Eventually you're going to wake up with feelings and he's going to enjoy having his cake and eating it too.  You must know that he's not intimate with only you.  If he's doing things to your body that he's never done before he's learned them from somewhere else.  Men don't change up their A game that quick.  Every one they give it to gets it the same way.|`|jkXDhtsQaa	Believe it or not -- sex can be very boring if everything is in routine.  <br>  Because you are married -- things can be even more predictable and not too much exciting.  <br>  <br>  Things have been so great, because everything is new again.  You meet up a diff place and not your old boring bedroom.  It's just like role-play in a way.  He may fantasize that he's meeting up with a mistress and not to his wife.  That causes the excitement which makes things a lot better and hotter. <br>  <br>  Like I've always told my husband.  We both of to try our best to keep thigns exciting to spice up our sex life to avoid the issue of "marriage sex".|`|bqkfu6Diaa	It's usually better after you have separated. If you get back together, it will eventually go back down to being lousy sex. There's a certain thrill if excitement you are both feeling by doing something you are not supposed to do. The forbidden fruit factor. Enjoy it while it lasts because it will not be forever.|`|6b0361fd65c600b0617b3884ebc87b1eaa	Sex becomes less unattainable so you want it more.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	there's always a difference when youve been away for awhile from each other sex feels like the first time again!|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	why dont you two talk about getting back together instead and have that amazing sex for the rest of your lives|`|HB0IivI3aa	Its amazing when u have it a lot with whoever it doesnt matter who|`|r3iKYom3aa	Don't just hook up for the sex. Get back together with him. He is your husband.|`|cyk4WSjjaa	Yes and the thing that makes it soooo much better is the fact that it's something that your not supposed to be doing! It makes the sex that much more fun. But remember in the end, the same feelings and problems you had before, will always come into play.

vslC8rB0aa	Just tell her if you were together right now you would give her a long hug. That's it. Make it so she wants to see you in person. Keep the phone calls short and tell her you'd rather talk face to face so you can see her smile. She will want you even more.

NVrJIn4yaa	Well,since the two of you are engaged right now,he needs to put his foot down to let his mother know what its going to be.He needs to let her know that the two of you are together and engaged so she needs to accept it. You may not be able to talk to her being as though she don't really condemn the two of you being together.So don't put too much pressure on that.Just worry about him doing his part with dealing with his mother.By the way how old are the two of you?|`|MfUMaKcDaa	depends on how old yall are and how long you've known eachother|`|dMhUcb2laa	this isn't what you want to hear, but I hope that it helps regardless.<br>  <br>  When you're dating someone with a strict mom, and that someone is still living in their household and thus under their law, there's not much you can do. Unfortunately, nothing you say to his mom will have any influence over her actions; she believes she's right, and because you're "just a child", she won't budge at your pleading. <br>  <br>  You can either continue to pursue this relationship, which will be miserable since you won't be able to conduct it on your terms, or you can break things off and take this as a loss. <br>  <br>  It's almost impossible to change a person; it's entirely impossible to change a person AND his mother.|`|RRGoldrAaa	OM FG !!<br>  <br>  that's real ****<br>  this mother is a stupid ***** .<br>  you didn't do anything wrong<br>  so you had sex <br>  <br>  if my mother does this to me i will kill her . i SWEAR<br>  just tell her that you didn't anything not natural .<br>  <br>  IMG !<br>  i still can't be live it<br>  <br>  this ***** wants her son to be a virgin his whole ******* life<br>  <br>  Jesus !!<br>  <br>  answer mine PLZ<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Auyxfwf_tZLd1Sw4JPuAj_nD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309124246AAt7pit">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|6dhPFK5Jaa	well, his mom needs to suck it up, and deal with it. she needs to figure out that thats life.
d513b0591e73a6dffbeecf0a7bd16137aa	Well, If you feel so strongly about him, then don't ever doubt that. Love is never ever wrong. Ok? And just talk to him about the whole thing. Since you heard from other sources, you need to find out his side of the story. Although, three weeks is a long time to be cheating on someone... I think you should be calm about it, don't do anything stupid, and just tell him to just say the truth. If he does say that he has been cheating, you have every right to act on your emotions...go crazy if you want. But don't blame your self. Ok? Then,   look at the situation as a whole. He didn't lie... So, just talk to him, and see where it goes from there. <br>  <br>  <3 Aurora|`|1fcq5tSEaa	break up with him. if he doesn't have the guts to break up with you so he can be a player and get another girlfriend then hes not worth it. you ll find a new love|`|XBkoAnfLaa	Get rid of him and move on to someone better cause I'm sure you deserve it|`|9k0nVj2Maa	see.. wat you should do is talk to him about it to see if he would be honest and tell you the truth and if tells the truth its up to u wat to do....and if he denies the truth find out your self then break up with him because you can probably to way better then that|`|DnZqpdQDaa	me and one of my ex's had a relationship for 3yrs almost. he decided a fellow "friend" was more attainable at the moment so he cheated. he was only a walk away but instead maked-out with her. life comes and goes and people don't initially think of hurting someone, most of the time. the only thing you can do is confront the issue, ball your eyes out, accept your circumstances, cling to true friends, and learn from this experience but don't have it cripple you from being with someone new. it's all up to you how this event is resolved. either you remain together or end it is all up to your morals and what actually happened.<br>  hope that helps =]|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	You should first talk to him and see if he confesses or blusters, etc.  Try to read if he's being honest.  I don't see why your best friend would lie, but how does she know they had sex or were even on a date?<br>  <br>  If he did cheat, dump his butt.  Once a cheater, always a cheater.  Some guys get off on it, and they become natural liars.<br>  <br>  It is not your fault.  Men that cheat just do.|`|R8fVBPnmaa	Gather as many F A C T S `bout this as you possibly can without seeming sneaky !! So that means it MIGHT take you just a`littele longer than you'd want it to !?!

You don't deserve that!<br>  Move on, I know it's hard, but it's for the best.<br>  "The One" wouldn't do that to you. <br>  Keep your head up:) You deserve the best:)<br>  It's not your fault for trusting him:)|`|AA10928214	Don't worry about it, try not to even think about it. Just move on, and try to be happy. he's a jerk, stay away from him, far away|`|9e1fb02b9a4c8da22e2bc01755705b33aa	You should confront him about the other girl and see how he reacts. If you believe he cheated, then dump him. There are plenty of other guys out there that would treat you better.
Bt40xzBSaa	it just depends on the girl. some girls may thing your a stupid jerk while others would fall madly in love. if you got her things before and she took them happily then i would assume she would accept the dress the same way. but whether or not she starts going out with you again i have no idea|`|0s4lCih4aa	DUDE, your a dum****, its an ex for a reason. spend the money on your selve.|`|tGcNmDUZaa	You shouldn't expect her to come back to you for a dress.

cSGfoQWEaa	Sending out an email about the girl won't be revenge because most likely everyone already knows the girl is a whore.  Your friend needs to realize it is her man who is stepping out on her, it could be any girl that he went to.  If I were you I would not get involved, there is nowhere positive this situation can go.|`|6JLIMmWYaa	Mmmm...who's more to blame?  The guy with a g/f who cheats on her, or the single girl who likes him?  Or even the g/f who is forgiving him???  I'd say she needs to stop redirecting her anger and focus it on him for cheating!  Don't help her write it.  Be a friend and explain she is mad at the wrong person, help her work out those feelings.|`|AA11761605	The best thing is to let this loser go.  Revenge has a way of turning back on you.  The boyfriend and the other girl have made decisions to be together.  It's going to be hard but there's nothing you can do when someone doesn't want you back.|`|5AaMDz91aa	Your friend seems like the kind of person who wants to stir up all of the drama.  Don't do it.  THis is between your friend and her boyfriend.  If your friend wants to seek revenge (which I do not reccomend) then she can do it.  But don't get involved with that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8NBEu5WNaa	Dont do it! You can still support her without doing the whole email thing + she'll probably regret sending the emails once she's done it. Talk her out of it.|`|QZEDisIsaa	Not your problem.  Don't let her pressure you, she's just looking to start drama.|`|6660bd3487fdb3fab7958bd2216d1e06aa	OK this is one of those really REALLY tough lessons...it is NOT the girls fault - the girl had no relationship to answer for. While it was totally uncool of her knowing he had a girlfriend and still going for it - it makes her unclassy but she isn't the actual fault here her boyfriend is! He is the one that claimed or let her presume that they were exclusive and then went against that so making the other girl suffer for his faithlessness will not help her. I suggest you try to redirect her anger and get her past this without doing something that indeed you will end up regretting. Good luck!|`|KlRsBt5waa	Cheating and revenge never cancel each other out. I know that she's angry at the girl he cheated with, but she should be more angry with him than with her. He is her boyfriend and broke that trust built between them. Let her know that humiliating the girl with her co-workers is not going to satisfy her or make her happy. It may escalate to more things and be the fall-out between she and her boyfriend. Don't get caught up in this drama with your friend. You could get caught whatever trouble she is trying to get into. Calmly talk to her and let her know that you sympathize but she is not thinking clearly. That is the best thing you could do for her as her friend.|`|C4v09PPsaa	your NOT in the relationship with her - not your problem.  Just say your not getting involved.|`|abx5VNsOaa	MYOB,encourage her to confront the boyfriend,that's the mature, adult way of dealing with this.|`|MmmcKU52aa	she needs to understand that her boyfriend is just as guilty as the girl that he cheated with, if not more so.<br>  instead of lashing out at the girl, tell her to talk with her guy.<br>  and if she still wants to ruin that girl's life (as much as she may deserve it) tell her to just wait a while. hopefully she will come down, and maybe she will see that its not worth it to stay with a guy who isn't faithful. <br>  good luck :]|`|Wdv2hUDaaa	Try to calm her down and persuade her that its the wrong thing to do.....Hope this helped...don't let her pressure you...you have a voice too.... <br>  <br>  P.S-If you want you can light dog crap on her front step lol (jk)|`|Iod5edCSaa	If she isn't going to punish the boyfirend it makes no sense for her to try to punish the other girl. <br>  Stay as far from this mess as you can.|`|imaeJ3o3aa	She should be writing an e-mail to the cheating Ho of a boyfriend!!<br>  leave the other girl alone, your friend will calm down soon and realise who the bad person is here.
hV5ctpkEaa	just start talking!<br>  <br>  keep it simple at first like about school, music etc. then if its going good start with a bit of flirtin such as playful joking! and if shes interested she'll show by laughing along or making a bit of physical contact (such as touching your arm...) or even if she just keeps eye contact with you and if she looks comfortable.<br>  <br>  just relax, be confident and it should be fine. Good luck! :D|`|TMbfzg8Faa	do not stutter... ever

Or, he is just severely insecure.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	He's blaming you for what he is guilty of. Send him a text msg and tell him u know the truth and he should just admit it and come clean and be honest and don't lie.|`|1HTRWrawaa	Cheaters are the dumbest people in the world, who believe it's everyone else that's dumb.<br>  <br>  When a person is completely faithful and has given their spouse no reason to believe that they are cheating, but their spouse is constantly accusing them of cheating, it's because the spouse is the one who is cheating. They are trying to cover up their own affair by accusing YOU of being the one who is cheating.<br>  <br>  Time for you to start doing some detective work. Find out what your husband is doing that he's trying to hide from you by constantly keeping you busy with defending yourself against his false accusations.|`|PDwlIrtsaa	It means that he has been put threw so much that he has no feeling left.|`|cGGvZqJNaa	You got some junk in that trunk.|`|e09da30cdb337437977b3874bf55af82aa	You lost me..........|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	This is crazy, sounds like there is more to the story than what you are letting on. Strange people don't tell your husband things like that. <br>  Why does your husband think you are cheating.....either you have done something to betray his trust, or he is a very controlling person. Either way you both need to talk to someone if you want this marriage to work.|`|ODYrypwaaa	People who think they are being cheated on usually feel that way because they are are paranoid from doing it themselves.  I hope he didn't cheat on you (or isn't).  Him saying he is numb could be a way of hinting that he doesn't "feel" for you or something.  <br>  <br>  You two should see someone soon and talk about these issues.  See a councilor or talk together with a mediator.  <br>  Wishing the best for you.|`|XrtmT2kUaa	Either your husband is cheating on you and blaming everything he can on you or he has a problem. It sounds like it is to easy to stay on you though, that way you don't have time to question his actions. Start paying attention to what he is doing. You just might be surprised.|`|7z6BWoESaa	well sounds like he is embarressed a little for accusing you and the man from RAC, but saying he feels numb, would mean he doesnt feel anything at all anymore, which is wrong because he does feel jealousy, seek a therapist!|`|Y8byax2paa	means you have drained him, emotional and physical...........<br>  <br>  it means things you have done to him has made him numb to the fact say you dont care about him, he is numb to that so he wont get hurt by that ......basically he cant feel like he used too|`|iPFUJXvpaa	no one txts back mess. like that just because ..you should go to rent a center with your husband and raise hell for that txt. if you don't then you must be cheating,and shouldn't care about about your husbands behavior..|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Well it sound like his heart is broken and he  feel numb. Not normal becoming depressed.|`|B1MnNcI8aa	he's cheating on you|`|0ocU0LJ0aa	Think about what may have brought this about...Is it you or was it someone else who he hasn't forgiven yet? He IS not numb because if he was he wouldnt give into an anger about this. Talk to him...see if there is something you can do to make him feel a little more secure in this situation. Giving up is always the easiest way out, loving someone for how they are and who they are is always alot harder.Good luck.|`|i0a7CWLWaa	I am guessing that your husband is very insecure about himself. If you work long hours it will probably put him a little more on the edge. He seems very protective over you so im guessing you're prettier than him haha. But I bet he is feeling depressed because he is worried you are cheating. I would just remind him how much I love him. And do something special to remind him why you fell in love with him.|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	He's not happy in the relationship or he's cheating on you and is feeling guilty about it. Or he is extremely depressed and needs psychological help, maybe medication too. It could also be a combo of all three or none at all. Talk to him about it, only way to know for sure.|`|Bq51x58jaa	people usually keep accusing someone of something because they are doing it theirselves.|`|rw1JWixHaa	if you've never cheated...then he is cheating.|`|eea9a9f6035619120178c7234487c1a6aa	he has a guilty conscience and it makes him feel less guilty when he accuses you|`|gB1dXEHCaa	trying to read that gave me a headache
IyDqnZYjaa	Depends how old. If you mean a few years older, I'm 21 and have dated in that range, not bad at all. If you mean a decade or 2 older, that's uncharted territory for many but cougars can be pretty hot sometimes. If you mean she's old enough to be your grandmother, I guess that's an acquired taste because I think that's totally gross. Try a couple years older dude, they're more mature and can carry on a conversation better without you getting bored.|`|tCI4GV29aa	I have dated even married a guy 5 years younger than me but..... His maturity level was out weighed his chronological  age by far. So that's my answer. Yes it's ok for you to be attracted to and even date older women if you feel you can handel it.
7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	Honestly, the best thing you can do is just be yourself.<br>  <br>  Trying to be something you aren't just means you will get guys that are interested in something you aren't.<br>  <br>  Be who you are, and don't be ashamed of it.  If you feel like you want to loose some weight, do it for yourself, and not for some guy.  If you want to get your hair styled differently, do it for yourself.<br>  <br>  If you be yourself, the guys that are interested in who you are will come to you.<br>  <br>  And have some confidence in yourself.

I've got quiet a few really close friends and we say "I love you" to each other all the time, that doesn't mean we've got a thing for each other.|`|lGNnyaIEaa	Tough one.  I think that if he's comfortable with saying "I love you" like that, and there was never an awkwardness leading up to this proclamation, then it's more of a sisterly love.

You'll probably even regret it when you're much older and meet the woman of your dreams.|`|LtP7oOtraa	no making out is far enough. don't push her. if you're happy and she's happy don't listen to your friend. 14 is young. i hadn't even kissed when i was 14. life is short, but it's not that short, you can take your time.|`|Ym9Er1fUaa	My girl is 14 years old too, im 16. and she has banged like 5 guys and i haven't banged anyone yet. But thats cause she is a total **** and I'm the nicest guy to ever be with her and shes taking it for granted and be a total ***** right now. <br>  <br>  How far has she gone though? That matters alot. If she hasn't done anything though and you really like each other, take it slow and when the time is right then you will go further. Personally, I don't think anyone should do things with girls until they are 16, which is how old I am. You are way too young in my opinion right now to be doing sexual things. So tell your friends to screw off and do whatever it takes to stay with her and keep her happy if you really like her.

N5mU7VdXaa	wow...it sounds like you have a lot on your plate. well, obviously you really like both of these guys and care for both of them and dont want to end up breaking one's heart. but, sometimes you have to think about yourself in this too. Which guy are you most comfortable around? Which guy gives you a special feeling and lets you be yourself? that guy is the best choice. Think about it a little but not too much because then you'll end up over-analyzing things. well, i hope this helps you and good luck with your relationships. =)

If that's what you want, go for it. If not, just go.|`|xuwJ6Vn3aa	When someone loves you, they would want to spend every moment of their time with you. I think he might think he loves you but, but he doesn't really know what love is. How could you love someone after only 5 days? And if he doesn't want to be alone with you unless your having sex? whats that! He probably has some commitment issues, or hes using you as someone to go to when he's bored and have sex with!I'm not trying to talk bad about your boyfriend, but lets face reality, if he truly loved you he would not be denying that hes spending so little time with you,and wouldn't be doing that in the first place. He could even be having an affair. (maybe). On the other hand, maybe your expecting too much of him? How often do you expect him to be with you, everyday? If that's the case then if hes not with you 24/7 it's perfectly normal. He needs to have time to be with his friends, and time to himself. Most likely this isn't the case, and you need to seriously think about breaking up with him-and then dump him . Before you do this, talk to him about whats going on. He may have some problems of his own and thats the reason why hes doing this. If he refuses to tell you his problems, deny's that theres anything wrong with the relationship, or doesn't have a good reason for it, then hes probably not serious about the relationship. You deserve better-move on!!!GOOD LUCK XOX <3 <3 <3 <3|`|Gz2WCF2Naa	lol! My turkish bf? I love the way u just identified him as "my turkish boyfriend!"
k3jv11Yeaa	Visit this web site, it had been a great help for me and my fiancee, we are also in a LDR.
a4Ku7rYvaa	I think it's one of the two things, she is either self-conscious in public or she could just be a shy person, see I was exactly like that with My girlfriend (I'm a boy)<br>  When I was in her house or somewhere where was uncrowded I would be fine and lively and we had a great time together but I did seem to be a lot less lively around other people with her, I was self conscious at the time, Hope this helps :)|`|u9JxGwoHaa	Ok i'm not sure of this since you didn't include it in you question but i'm guessing shes more lively when shes near people she knows aka. her friends and its natural when a young girl goes out with a boy by themselves she will be nervous this is because she likes you alot and dosen't want to seem to pushy or shes nervous when shes around other people and not with her mates, all you can do is encourage her to relax on your dates and after a while she should stop being so uncomfortable. Hope it helped.
oZV7ukGqaa	Maybe the timing just in not right for the both of you right now. I would just act like nothing happened and continue on as friends. You let him know how you feel and now it is up to him. I would not however sit around and wait for him to make a move. You should just continue on with your life and if you meet someone else you should be open to them. It is a lot like a man, to want what they can't have. So if he is worried about ruining your friendship, you should Honor that and just move forward. I can guarantee you that if he likes you, when you are no longer sitting around waiting for him to tell you how he feels, it will be then that he finds the courage.

We were in love, and we were actually quite a strong couple, so we've never actually argued to this day!<br>  We broke up before our final year at Uni, and it was agonising to see him dating....<br>  BUT, there's an upside. I'm getting married to someone else I love even more and in many different ways.I actually have trouble remembering the steamy bits with my ex, and see now why we couldn't last.<br>  <br>  Your ex/best friend loved you for a whole heap of reasons or she'd not be there now being friends!<br>   Ask her what those good things were,(and tell her what hers were too, it's just polite)<br>   and you've no need to feel bad about yourself. You have bad points too, so what? we all do! But if we always dumped people because of them, nobody would love again!<br>   It won't be the reason she dumped you, or she'd not be friends!<br>  <br>  The last thing you want to do is go on the re-bound, if you do it that way you'll miss the glorious feeling when you realise you are actually "Over" your ex and ready to date again. I've seen rebounds fail terribly because the other girl isn't blind, she knows she's not the "one".<br>   With me, I wasn't looking, I just happened to fall head over heels for one of my friends!<br>  <br>  What you need to do now is find a project. I got into a funny Play at Uni, and I Games-mastered a fantasy role playing game I'd written myself for my friends.<br>   Use your own talents and hobbies to their fullest.<br>  Even if that means reading self-penned gloomy breakup poetry at an open mike night (I never did that!), it'll get you two things<br>  A) Your mind off her.<br>  B)Attention of potential friends and lovers!<br>  <br>  One other cliche, you need to spend a bit of time apart. Do you have someone to visit you haven't seen in  a while? Find a good reason to be in a different place for a week or so, or even just in the attic clearing out!<br>  There's nothing wrong with thinking about her during that time, but make it one postcard, or one e-mail, so you get the thinking done in one go, like pulling off a plaster.<br>  <br>  The trick is, only to see her when it's important. Think...Is this bit of gossip so urgent that I NEED to see her now? Save it up so you don't bug her and it becomes apparent you just want to see her for the sake of it.<br>  (A mistake I made, and one I do to my fiance when I call him when he's away!) <br>  <br>  I hope some of this helps.<br>  I can only use my own experience, and I know how annoying it is when folk like me say It WILL get better...but it does, so *nyah*  :P<br>  <br>  Take care, Bxx
NTC6g8hYaa	Well its depends. If he likes you, he's doing this becuase he could be confused, embarrased or nervous around you, doesnt want to seem clingy, ect.<br>  But if he's mad at you, then idk, you need to ask.<br>  <br>  Either way, if you like him, talk to him more, ask him why he was ignoring you. Make things comfortable between yall, not awkward. So keep talking, flirting, text him, maybe even call! Haha anyways just keep in touch with him so yall will have a future! Good luck :)|`|Z4Mms4ePaa	he could be going through a hard time that he doesn't want to tell you about, so when hes feeling down about it he might want to ignore you because he doesn't want you to know, like he thinks it might hurt you or something.|`|XPWZbyPqaa	omg!! this EXACT same thing is happening to me!! like one day we wont really talk but then the next we flirt like crazy!! it drives me insane!!|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Someone probably told him that if he ignores you that you will like him.

S8RL9lieaa	You did the right thing so don't blame yourself. He'll get over it and meet someone else and you'll be a distant memory. So look after yourself and enjoy your new relationship.|`|YfFFzOw1aa	ohh, babes i'm sorry it was so hard for you, all i can say is that i wouldn't go out with anyone for a while just to give yourself time to get over hurting him, i would see how your 'bro' feels about talking to you and things let him make the moves to going back to the way you 2 used 2 be (aka really good friends), i broke some ones heart months ago and he has not talked to me since because he said that he needed to get over me, i am sure that if this ex loves you enough though that he probably can't go without talking to you. i think that you should try not do anything that would hurt your ex, and please don't punish your self for the feelings you had, its not your fault i believe that you mind is like a completely different person to your body what you feel and think is not your fault you can't help it. if that makes sense. i hope i have helped you babes. xxx i feel for you|`|itLS5Ualaa	0.0 **** what was long. <br>  you cant do nothing.|`|tXLY7l9Faa	No offence but you're way out of order. You're saying that you self harmed and stuff because he said "i love you", what the hell! You say you let him down easy as possible but i bet he felt like crap knowing that you were hurting yourself because of how he felt. You don't deserve to be with anyone.
WJJ18mE8aa	Honestly, I think it's all in your head, and he doesn't like you, because if he did, he wouldn't just stare at you, and he would make an effort at talking to you or flirting with you. His joke about having a son wasn't a flirtation sign at all. If he liked you, he wouldn't even make that up in the first place. Also he keeps saying that he doesn't know you enough to like you, which means exactly that. His whole thing about him crushing on you and wanting you in my life is most likely about someone else that you don't know about, and is probably none of your buisness (which is why he didn't want to tell you). And his short replies shows that he has no interest in you to keep up the converstation or to keep you interested into what he has to say. And his rude reply wouldn't have happened if he actually liked you. You cannot dream and think like that just because you like him, you need to think about the other parts of it too. And yes it would be better if you were talking to eachother in person, because only talking on the internet makes it awkward when you actually see eachother in real life. Trust me about what I am telling you, i'm not saying it to be mean, its just the reality  check. I am a pro at flirting, crushes, being able to tell when a guy likes you, how to flirt, all the signs to him liking you, how to act around a crush. But yeah I honestly don't think he is interested, and I think he was talking about another girl.|`|AA11487637	He's just messing with your head call it quits and move on that's what I would I do|`|K4GhBbzLaa	Girl, Please, NO BOY will ever just "look at random people."

Because you feel like he should be different. <br>  Well, he's not. He is who he is and no amount of time or wishing is going to change that. If you cannot accept who he is now then what makes you think  he will ever change? It's been going on for several years now. No matter how hard you might wish otherwise, he cannot be the man you want him to be.

N7gOE1btaa	Sexual compatibility can make or break a realtionship.  It sounds as though this is breaking your relationship.  If you choose to step out, then you should end it so you aren't cheating on him.  If you refuse to leave him, then you can try some of the following:<br>  1) tell him to masturbate a few hours before seeing you, that way he is likely to last longer<br>  2) tell him to read up on ways to make himself last longer--there are exercises for that<br>  3) the two of you should find sex positions that make him last longer<br>  4) you should buy condom's or lube that is meant to increase endurance for a guy. I think one type of condom is called performax<br>  5) to boost his confidence, fake an orgasm every now and again, scream his name if you have to<br>  <br>  I hope these help.  But keep in mind, 10 months is long but not always long enough to reach compatibility.  Sometimes it takes longer, I suggest you keep trying and try the above.  If you love him and he loves you, no reason to give up so quickly.  Good luck! :)|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Stop laughing at him everytime that he pulls down his pants.|`|AlZPIAtmaa	You're a sexy mama.  You know what you have to do.|`|AN9PdKmgaa	Your relationship is doomed to fail why wait until you need to go outside it and it hurts him when he finds out? if you really want it to work have him see his doc cause a lot of physical reasons could be causing his problem as well as some medications he may be on.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	step out, your not the girl for him.|`|EsaFg8eaaa	Wow some girlfriend you are. If you really love him stay with him, if not he deserves better.<br>  <br>  Good sex takes time.<br>  <br>  Foreplay before hand works wonders. Have him go down on you and get you off first then let him have his 2 minutes, or give him a handjob or bj like an hour before you fool around so he will last longer<br>  <br>  <br>  Ps.If he is getting off so fast, your doing something right. Try doing something wrong lol.<br>  <br>  EDIT:Maybe bring toys into the relationship? But you really need to talk to him.|`|c5UAa65qaa	If by "stepping out" you mean cheating on him, forget it.  Morality aside, that's not going to do a thing to help his confidence.<br>  <br>  If you mean dumping him...that might be what you have to do in the end, but first make it clear to him that this is a really big issue for you, and he needs to find a way to address it if he wants the relationship to work.  Encourage him to see a doctor to find out if there's anything physically wrong that might be causing his low sex drive, and/or a therapist to get at the psychological issues.  If he won't make the effort, then let him go and find someone who will.|`|mZ9suLgXaa	There are a bunch of positions that you can try that will not stimulate him as much, so he can last longer. as for his self esteem, only he can fix that, thats why its called SELF esteem. If your not getting that connection that you want and hes not really trying, why waste your time? lifes short. and 1 minute is sad.|`|PtSeJXnEaa	you need to talk to him. have a serious conversation. let him know that you love him and ask what you can do to help. boost his confidence! this is more of his problem than yours anyways. you need to be more caring and considerate. sorry but its true.|`|aTC0tmUIaa	If you leave the relationship because he is not good at having sex I think you are an idiot u leave someone because u dont love them anymore or they dont love u but not for sex|`|8MwbOKOLaa	Tell him to jerk off before you guys have sex, then he will last longer. Dress up or just ask what his fantasies are. Put in a few fake orgasms if needed and call him ''daddy''.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	force him and teach him.<br>  rape is hot too. (it's hot when girls force sex on you)|`|c4zDD02Zaa	i would have sex with you|`|ebwe0Duzaa	you just need to make him feel really good, do something really sweet for him and show him how much you love him!  tell him how much you love his body and how you dont think hes bad and that you dont care either because you love him and it doesnt matter....make him feel good by telling him a bunch of sweet things let him know that hes good enough...hes probably had something really bad happen in a past relationship thats messed him up and severely destroyed his confidence and he probably feels that since that someone else said or thought whatever happened that your going to have the same feelings...that happened to me...in a past relationship something really embarassing happened and i refused to makeout with my bf that i have right now for a very very long time and i STILL after a year and 10 months try not to let him see my ehh hemm, but im slowly getting over it and of course ive made out with him alot, i got over that awhile ago...if you love him then you should just deal and try your hardest to let him know that no matter what or how bad he thinks he is you think hes amazing...idk those situations can be hard.|`|579fbd1f2248aba930dab722fc93eea0aa	Your age would make the question easier.  But when you say he only lasts a minute,  if that means what I think it means you can atleast agree that he is attracted to you.  His lack of desire for sex could be because of that,  he is embarrassed he cannot last longer.  Solutions for that are.................|`|H7CMI42Paa	Don't just leave him, tell him you need it changed, there has to be somewhere that can help him...maybe medically.<br>  But you can't put up with it for too long, you'll go insaneeeeee.
Qbm3Vpilaa	If this boyfriend is hitting you its wrong -no man should put his hands on a woman . i understand love but there's a difference between  affection and pain ...Love shouldn't hurt you ,knocking out your front teeth no way.... I would ask him to see a counselor and try some anger management classes something to try to understand this terrible thing he's done to you and him self .|`|2a0e5d5b94219fa3def0dbdc7b21005daa	oo no take that picture down|`|2nc9k9BSaa	NO.<br>  <br>  It's pretty obvious that if a guy knocks out all your teeth, he doesn't give a [insert creative word here] about you at all.<br>  <br>  ._.
N7gOE1btaa	If you have tried to talk to him and express yourself calmly and fairly to him, and he refuses to do anything about it--then your bf is choosing that guy over you.  If your bf was friends with him before your relationship, then I'd say deal with it.  Otherwise you have a choice--do you want a guy who chooses a new friend over your well-founded concerns?  Think about it.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	when this "friend" screws him over, be the better person and be there for him. until then, let the "friendship" run it's course.|`|jjhHnCB1aa	Don't talk to your boyfriend untill he stops being friends with him.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	Give him an ultimatum. You, or his friend. That way you get a clear idea where of the ordering of his priorities, and what he values most.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	be manipulative and sneaky right back. Just tell your boyfriend that his new friend asked you to have sex behind his back.|`|BkMjabPvaa	no|`|AN9PdKmgaa	just wait if he has half a brain he will soon figure it out|`|AA10517807	you are jealous, don't break up with your boyfriend thats what the other boys wants you to do , try to be extra nice with the friend super extra nice ,|`|AJEYXzIUaa	i would not try to split them up, because if this guy is manipulative then it will all come back on you. just be there for your boyfriend for when he gets burned by this guy|`|wEnznuaLaa	if you like this guy a lot, then talk to him seriously saying  "either he goes or i go" hazahh|`|PtSeJXnEaa	grow up and deal with it.|`|313196a4bb59234a623ea4d83a663aadaa	omg, ur so funny. hmm...i dont see the big deal with ur bf having a friend..but...w/e.|`|N185NghYaa	Move?|`|TqpVXvAHaa	no|`|yMURftLPaa	NO , ask yourself those question , are you jealous , you want all attention to be toward you , <br>  Are you a controlling person and because of this friend you afraid you might lose control.<br>  IF someone loves you no matter who comes and goes ,he always keep you as first priority in his life,<br>  Just give it some times , they might cool off and the friend will go his own way,,,,,,,Don't sabotage anything cause you might make an *** out of yourself.|`|y3P2FgMpaa	You really should let your boyfriend deal with this by himself, but if you're really that in tune with your boyfriends life I suggest talking to him about his friend and how you don't feel comfortable with them as friends. Sabotage will most likely blow up in your face, plus, don't you want to be a good girlfriend and just be honest?|`|DXejMhV8aa	You could just let things run their course and let your boyfriend find out on his own, or you could try to sleep with this guy to get rid of him. Your boyfriend will forgive you before the dude.  You did say you were willing to sabotage sleeping with him then telling your boyfriend should do the trick<br>  <br>  <br>  Also he may be taken advantage of but you still sound jealous.|`|mQVmJdZvaa	Sounds to me like you are jealous.  Let your BF have his friends and this way you can spend more time with your friends.  You need to have a life outside of your boyfriend.  Save that for when you get married.  Don't sabatoge anything, that never works out in the end.|`|koP1PaVjaa	You don't. That kind of thing only works against you. If he's as bad as you say, he will eventually do something to make your boyfriend not want to be around him anymore. There's no need to be jealous of his friends- you've been around longer than he has.|`|CeHQBpHyaa	Try going to one of your friends and doing something whenever he wants to do something with you!! It would probably annoy him and then try and make plans when you know they are going to be hanging out!|`|n54adPiBaa	That's not really that cool.|`|Fi5Hh6Eqaa	dont split them up it his fault if he is being friends with him just ignore it
QcUkrLWraa	Why are you typing it out like it's a poem?<br>  Anyway, it's not a gay question. I would tell you to get some confidence, but that's not as easy to do than to say, I would know. Also, just because you're a Christian, it doesn't mean you can't be homosexual/bisexual. It's just the way some people are born, and the way some people go. Your religion may make you feel guilty about it, but it doesn't mean you can't be. I wouldn't know though, so I'll just move on.<br>  But if you really like him, all you have to do is be yourself. Yes, yes, I know, cheesy line. Waste of 5 points if that's all you're getting from us! But look at it this way: no matter what, if he's going to like you at all, it'd have to be because of your personality, might as well show it off, and see if he likes you too, right?<br>  Me, I'm extraordinarily shy, but with some people I'm comfortable with, I can be myself. It's very rare though. There's two people in the world that I feel myself with. So just find a way to make yourself feel comfortable around him. Perhaps you can try to get it into your brain that whether he likes you or not, it'll be based on your personality, so there's nothing you can really do about it. Just relax and see how things go. Hope I got what I was trying to say out right...
AA11822515	Are you sure this really happened? It sounds like a bit of a myth to me.
6CJK3q7saa	It sounds like what happened to me when I was in junior high. I liked a guy who seemed to like me yet...sometimes not interested in me and he was much more popular than I was. but we were like tight friends. So much CONFUSION! haha right? <br>  <br>  Well I can certainly say that you are really pondering "does he like me? does he not?"<br>  <br>  first thing i'd say is CHILL. because then you can't really think straight. Sometimes when he stares at you or w/e it COULD mean he likes you, but then again its kinda on how you would interpret it. it DOES seem by the way you put it hez gotta have SOME INTEREST in you. we both don't know just how DEEP that some interest is. as for the times he doesn't seem to be interested in you at all (which happened to me when i liked that guy) is usually if he likes you, hez pondering the same question if u like him and also how to respond to you and what to say and etc. basically how to react to you. if not the case...then hez either tired...busy...or w/e<br>  <br>  I was always afraid he didnt' respond because he was annoyed at me, but when i asked him, it turns out he wasn't. <br>  <br>  SOO<br>  <br>  my suggestion is basically either just act normally the way you do around him, get more clear headed and observe him around you compared to other girls. <br>  <br>  and get a friend to ask him if he likes anyone or u can do it urself. if he asks why just say you heard some people talking that you liked someone. or that you heard some people talking about some person liking you. <br>  <br>  if he asks who? you can just say "i don't know"<br>  <br>  hahaha....i don't know if THAT works...but is worth a try.|`|IwtQzbY9aa	YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Answer mine PLEASE<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AntIkGD_AJEr3ExkEDUD6wUJ7RR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090309154057AAZTg8K">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|6t1CClfQaa	yo if u like him just ask him out ur only 13 u gots ur hole life infront of u dont worry bout that stupid as ****|`|jyVqvRxHaa	hes not sure he's only 13 and is confused like you|`|JbrJgJGjaa	you have a chance of him liking you. Ask around and see what this guy is like and maybe someone will know or not. Hope this helps!:)|`|gmefdkZsaa	hmmm <br>  well you can ask him casually and say " Hey, do you wanna hang out some time?"<br>  <br>  "cuz there is this movie that I really wanted to go see and I thought maybe you would want to go with"<br>  <br>  that will get things started, and he'll know that your intrested, and its not to open and easy, and he'll probally say okay...<br>  <br>  he probally thinks ur cute, but you both should get to know eachother more, and if you make the first move that shows him that you not afraid.....<br>  <br>  <br>  hope thiis helps,<br>  good luck!!<br>  -?|`|GM0hJqrPaa	I think he likes you. Ask his best friends. I think he likes you but is just afraid that you will say no to him. Maybe you need to tell him you like him.|`|Mu1CkYa0aa	OK...i think there is a good chance he likes you. try to text him again and pump up the flirting. guys like girls that are confident, so go for it :)|`|h0aGiAS3aa	Why don't you just ask him if he likes you?<br>  It sure makes things a lot less complicated.|`|woFMTx92aa	sounds like he likes you or it may just be interest|`|LfD4ouKOaa	i think that he did like you but now he is having 2nd thoughs. i think that he doesn't like you any more but he use to. i think you should just be your self if he likes you he should like you for who you really are not someone you are pretending to be. so just be YOURSELF and no body else.<br>  hope i helped. need more advice email me at macster621@yahoo.com.<br>  good luck|`|qRAwBtJ5aa	i'm going to keep this answer simple.<br>  yes he likes you.<br>  he didn't text you back because he had no credit, was to busy to reply, had his phone battery dead etc.<br>  maybe he is spiteing himself, he likes you but is pushing you away.<br>  who cares if he is popular or a loner. its still him. who cares how popular you are. its still you.|`|szE4urf8aa	probebly, because if a guy stares at you ALOT, he probly likes you..
8JPDOXagaa	Meh once a cheater always a cheater.<br>  Some guys are just up for everything they can get, and they cant resist a good offer even though they may be perfectly happy in their relationship.<br>  <br>  Dont take him back unless your 100% convinced he wont do it again|`|UinOWcMUaa	Not all guy's cheat -- just maybe the one's you women like :) the good guy's who care for their women, most girls don't like.|`|VwG2lhcNaa	He's playing with your feelings. If he really loved you he wouldn't have cheated on you.|`|eMFYNGI2aa	Ok I've been there so I'm gonna give you some advice...<br>  <br>  Guys cheat, and if you forgive them and just put it behind you, it happens again.  You forgive 'em and it's like wow that's it?  You gotta put your foot down, don't necessarily leave the guy, but let him know that you aren't replaceable.  Hood rats will come n go, and yer guy may wander, but you have to let him know that he can't control the wandering and yer gone.  I made the mistake of forgiving my man, and it's hard to repair those mistakes.  Now he thinks if he slips up a little and just gets caught makin plans to get wit a girl and don't get caught that it's not so bad, because he's gotten away with worse.<br>  <br>  DONT LET HIM JUSTIFY!... if he starts pullin the well you weren't here and I was horny... LEAVE... it shows no regret and that he'll do it again, you don't wanna guy that's gonna wander everytime you're too tired or workin.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|99NNTv6vaa	ha at least he is showing signs that he somewhat cares for you, when girls cheat on guys they girls never come back and don't even care that they cheated on you.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Why do you lump us all into one category ?<br>  Why hurt me because someone hurt you ?<br>  We have feelings too.|`|2a0e5d5b94219fa3def0dbdc7b21005daa	yu have to make that decision,do you think that he is sincere or do you fel like he will cheat on you again|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Most guys don't set out to cheat, but sometimes if a girl throws herself at them, they'll go for it, and worry about the consequences later. They beg for forgiveness because they've been caught out and don't know what else to do. Very few cheaters own up to what they've done unless they're caught out. If a guy cheated on me, that would be the end of it straight away. Theres no room for second chances in my book.|`|QBMrnfihaa	No never, hel take the pis* and keep doing it trust me, and if u do take him back make him work for it, say he has to proove he loves you other wise it just wont work out|`|06O8FaOjaa	TRUST MEH I WENT THREW THAT FIRST THEY CHEAT DNT EVEN CARE ABOUT US BUT WEN WE FIND OUT THEY JUS SEEM TO SAY SORRY I DIDNT NO WAT I WAS DUIN BULL$H!T BUT IF YU REALLY LOVE HYM THEN YU SHULD GIVE HYM ANTHOR SHOT|`|lO2GCtjEaa	Yeah im confused as well, I have never cheated on my g/f's but have been cheated on by a couple, so you cant really be exclusive saying guys are the cheaters...|`|QilfSBfsaa	If he has cheated you more than one time, you have to watch out if he is addicted on lying to you, or fooling you around.|`|19fa39a2ed4e38229aee162e273509bcaa	he just feels sorry bcuz you caught him....<br>  that's why he's begging for forgiveness..<br>  <br>  MY OPINION EVERYONE CHEATS...EVENTUALLY|`|eCmnwCiMaa	not all of them do that but keep in mind the ones that don't are very hard to find and they usually are single.|`|Qe95LNxYaa	quit your bitching not all of the men are like that just because you date one jerk doesn't mean rest of us men are same|`|HcWJwx0Baa	Well theirs only two kinds of men in the relationship department <br>  <br>  A Playa or a normal dude<br>  <br>  If he was a playa he'd go on without caring for your feelings<br>  <br>  So you know he's not<br>  <br>  He's not playing with your feelings<br>  <br>  But if he has done it before it's probably because he had sweet chances with other women so he didn't want to blow the chance<br>  <br>  Now not all men are cheaters such as (bumbumbum) Me and many other dudes <br>  <br>  So not all men cheat on their women<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But It's Unlikely for him not to cheat again if he gets a big chance but if you forgive and believe him <br>  <br>  Forgive Him <br>  <br>  <br>  But tell him he has to gain your trust back Until he thinks everthing is good|`|J4CMYwACaa	ah joanna, not too bright eh. well heres how it works, guys have one chick i guess you could call it a girlfriend and hell tell you that youre his girlfriend but youre really not, but we use this one girl as our consistent source of the most precious thing on earth, poon tang pie. but as you may know the baker made many pies and if a guy gets hungry and the pie is willing hes not gon pass it up even if he knows hell get caught he knows he can find another pie just like joanna, its a vicious cycle i know but thats just the way it works, then he accidentally gets a pie pregnant then he has to decide, put up with her or figure out a way to get out of paying child support and continue the cycle.|`|Gu8bynMKaa	i know how you feel.<br>  i wouldn't forgive him. you should look for someone who respects you.

WHV2VDbIaa	speaking as someone who is just out of high school myself and speaking from experiance, i would say that there is probably a part of you that does trust her and a part of you that doesnt. there is nothing wrong with you. would she seriously be ok with finding you in a bathroom with another girl? <br>  <br>  i think you need to confront her. trust is the basis of all relationships. if you cant trust her then you two will probly not have a successful relationship. but if you can fully forgive her for it and put your full trust in her then hey, it might work. <br>  <br>  what is ment to it be will be. it's the quote i live by. you cant force something to happen the way you want it to just because you think it's right. you may love her. and i give you kuddos for that.<br>  <br>  you need to follow your heart. it will guide you. you might not like the road it takes you down but think about it this way. your heart might just take you down a road that will lead to something better.|`|QVj2JwWKaa	You seem like such a  good guy to have so much trust in her and your friend.<br>  <br>  Im not understanding why she would be upset and standoffish, when you told her you trust her word that nothing happened. <br>  That is weird!<br>  <br>  I think something went on and she is just embarrassed and upset that you actually believe her. <br>  <br>  I don't know, this is odd...her behavior.<br>  <br>  I guess you are right give her a little time, but then ask her what happened between you and her- tell her you feel things have changed a little bit...tell her again how much you Do trust her and see what she says.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Don't break up with her just because other peoples comments are getting to you. Maybe you guys are just stressed out. <br>  <br>  If it still doesn't work, then let her know you just don't feel the same and need some time away. She wont be happy and she'll probably cry for days and days and not eat and (if shes emo) she'll cut herself and wont go to school (or work) and will be mad at you, but will get over you eventually.<br>  <br>  REMEMBER: Don't leave the one who loves you for somethng stupid because the one who loves you will get over you and when you try to come back, she/he wont be there...|`|huGTOQrwaa	I would have to say to take it easy.

7A69Ym5qaa	I can tell you that just friends is almost not an option. But make it in person for closure but leave room for him to be able to escape so he feels that he can walk away anytime. Be nice and gentle. Be calm and supportive. Tell him the good qualities he has, the problem or reason you don't love him, and a closing supportive statement and/or reason to look to the future. Sometimes it helps to tell him a negative quality you have.

She's 32 you're 23 she's old enough to fill up her own car.|`|0zgolkhOaa	Sounds to me like the connection that was once there is now starting to slowly fade away.  I know that the age gap is big and that could have an impact on your relationship but you both make about the same money so that COULD fill in the gap.  Both of you have your own interests which is really common in any relationships.  What you haven't told me is what you guys like to do on spare time and what kind of activities you do to keep your relationship stable.

It is completely up to you!<br>  <br>  If you are asking this question you are not ready, stay with your instinct, wait for marriage.  At the very least, wait till you have been with him a year.|`|iTUugOTLaa	"At the very least, wait till you have been with him a year." You would seriously regret taking advice like that. Virginity isn't anything more than what you make of it. Personally, I only consider it a lack of experience, a lack of some very nice and satisfying experience.. that only gets better with more experience.<br>  <br>  IMHO I'd say, do it when you want to. You might not "know" if you are ready or whatever... but I mean, that's invented. Who made that up? "are you ready"? Noone will know that answer. You just go ahead if you're curious. I have been doing it w/ my gf since we were 1 month into it.. and it's still going. You've been together FIVE MONTHS with no sex! He MUST like you for who you are.<br>  <br>  Go for it, and use a condom.<br>  <br>  cheers|`|uPAO6eZdaa	IF YOU WANT IT GO FOR IT... WAITING FOR MARRIAGE IS OVER RATED.

Seems you decided to mark him that no one else can be an item. So naturally he would be confused. Now, imagine the spots switched.

But, that is how I see it.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	that ship has sailed|`|59DkkvSraa	Good luck trying to get him to be your friend. if he knows or ever finds out you talked **** about him to your friends he probably will be happy having nothing to do with you forever. writing a letter will probably be a good start. tell him you were wrong for talking bad about him and explain it was just because you didnt want any of your friends to try and be with him. tell him what he means to you and if he really doesnt want to be with you then at least can he be friends with you? and mailing it to him would be good to because he will be home when he reads it and most likely alone which will give him more time to think about it and not get distracted. then tell your friends that you still like him and are trying to get him back and if they are decent friends then they wont try to make moves on him or anything!|`|tm5GTqbKaa	You really need to stop playing games for real..

She is more mature than most freshmen guys I think she should go out with a few freshmen guys, some sophmores, juniors and seniors are usually looking to get at them because of their immaturity. She went to a party after homecoming with him and she broke up with him because he wanted sex, and I think thats what most guys want when they date younger girls|`|j9ZMsXu8aa	Sometimes guys a few years older than a freshman girl are on the same maturity level as the girl are. Boys mature slower than girls, so a girl who is 14 or 15 is probably on the same level of maturity as a 17 year old guy.

There is not real solution for this except time.  You've done what you done and I'm sure you knew the consequences and expected the worst and well, things COULD have been worst.  Students who do this usual get suspended for a time period because you basically stole the answers and then distributed them.  My advice is to just accept that you've made a mistake, move on with your life, and learn from the consequences.  Your fellow classmates will eventually let things cool over but my point is, learn from this and avoid doing anything like this in College.  Best of luck, Lis (:|`|X3dDkYNNaa	Realize what you did was dead wrong.  Cheating is cheating, and it's also a lie, so what you did was to help others to cheat and lie.  I'm amazed that all you received was detention.  That being said, I personally would apologize to the people you sent it to.  And from this point act accordingly.  Accept the fact that right now you are perceived as less than trustworthy and a cheat.  If it's any consolation this storm will pass in time.|`|9LUHPAi2aa	first of all you should have haters hating on you. if you want to cheat just make a new myspace account and post it up then they wont know who it is. try telling people that you're really sorry and ask what you should do to make it up for them. or you can beat up the snitch(lol jks) but other than that you shouldnt have post it on in the first place.|`|ha52lVFeaa	you shouldn't have to worry, it's only detention. no one would hold a grudge over a detention for long. i also doubt that they hate you, but it will be a couple of weeks before the whole thing blows over, just wait till people stop talking about it. in the meantime, try and be nice. i'm sure it'll be alright in the end.|`|gkocAbnVaa	well i see i had this problem i fix many of  problems like this on myspace and gaia but what u need is not stress and ignore them and if they hollare at u hollar at them and yes they will get over it just calm down dont stress but the girls try to agrivate u i mean how would they know just say how do u know to them and keep it up and ull feel better|`|unaKJTptaa	say sorry. just listen they say. ps. bastia is better than undertaker.|`|70fvxvj0aa	Laugh at them and say this was your plan all along.|`|zciyw7oIaa	give them all a laser pointer. it makes people happy.|`|WttToNwtaa	first of all, who uses MySpace?<br>  SECOND next time you have a test don't cheat. it's called studying. do it.<br>  and THIRD give it time. people will forget about it eventually. but don't ever do it again. treat this like a lesson.|`|HAHA2u13aa	Stick with Edge 4 life and forget the rest.Peace|`|EOU1i64Paa	first off, don't ever cheat again.

It never pays.|`|QZso17fDaa	but u didnt snitch!! but u did do somwthing wrong<br>  <br>  i would hate the snitch not u|`|FoFvHsjiaa	Okay well you're lucky all you got was detention....  Don't try to pull that stuff in college, you'll have a permanent mark on your transcript that basically labels you as a cheater AND you'll fail the class.  NOT good for grad school or job hunting.  Anyway, people hate you because they blame you for what happened.  It's really lame actually because if you had gotten away with it, then they would have loved you.<br>  <br>  However, it's kind of dumb on your part to share that information with so many people because surely someone who already doesn't like you will find out and use the opportunity to call you out.  Just use better judgement next time.  People will forget about this soon enough.|`|7e8NN8saaa	Keep telling yourself - there is life beyond grade school....This too shall pass.

pj02ePxAaa	I think the best thing to do is to ask Lucy if it is okay if you date her sister. Personally I wouldn't have a problem with it if I were her. But it wouldn't be pleasant for her to just find out that you and Mary are dating. That would kind of suck. <br>  <br>  It would also be bad to let an amazing girl just walk out of your life. If you guys really do click, then it would be a shame to let that slip away. Ask Lucy and I think that since you guys have been friends for so long that it won't matter to her. Hope everything works out for you! ?|`|zxrvjhkxaa	Did you know I love pizza and ice cream? Mmmmm Now I'm hungry.|`|PhPwAGVNaa	"Or should I just not ask out Mary and go on for the rest of my life without the best girl I've ever met and kick myself for the rest of my life?"<br>  <br>  That question definitely stood out to me the most.  You obviously WANT to ask this Mary out, but you don't know if you should.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to ask Lucy first.  Since she is your best friend, you owe it to her to let her know how you feel.  Tell her what Mary does to you.  Tell her the connection you two seem to have.  Then ask if it would be alright to go out with Mary.  <br>  <br>  Respect her opinion, whatever it may be.  If Lucy is wierded out by it, tell her no problem.  And it is no problem!  Though you may find this unlikely, you are bound to find another amazing girl like Mary.<br>  <br>  If Lucy is fine with it, then by all means ask Mary out!  Just tell her that you've felt a connection from the start and ask to hang out with her sometime.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!
ctBP6U8caa	I'm 29 and go through this also. No one, and I mean no one ever comes up to start a conversation. Maybe you look like you don't want to be bothered? Maybe you look unfriendly? I have no idea, but you are not alone.|`|XnekCBj7aa	Do you want to go out sometime?|`|NNv8jhjraa	Sounds like that you're an outstanding girl in my opinion.. perhaps it's your personality? Are you overly shy around guys? Or are you overly confident? Confidence is good, but it can sometimes be shown as conceited.|`|KY1rvB0haa	maby since you are in the career they are intimidated

iJR6qAV9aa	Ohkaii well thats really sad losing your mom and dad in front of you.. .:( I couldn't imagine. Anyways i think its good that you guys are together , if you think you guys can last, and if you really want it to.. it will. Who really cares what you're parents think or parents in general some just think they know everything once they get older but think of it this way...once you get old you begin to lose you're memorie. And if you could following your life bassed on there advice and decisions then you'll end up right in there position. The best way to live you're life is according to you. Make you're own path and don't follow in anybodys foot steps. Anyways just putting that out there. I think that since you guys are already togther you already have to give him a chance for atleast 6 weeks or you will seem like a player. Thats the genral rule for dating . (6 weeks) ! And you don't want to hurt him anymore then hes already been hurt so just keep whatever you have going on... because clearly if you asked him out you like him. And you're the only person who knows how you feel about him.|`|b6g2C42caa	sometimes you have to go against what other people say i mean  in the long haul it doesn't matter what your mom saids it only matters what you feel and and if you feel that you want to be that person to love him go ahead and love him .... the last thing  you want to do is be another person he looses in life so go ahead and love him as friend or girlfriend|`|3pcwIUBlaa	if your mom is strongly against you two dating then you need to just be friends. be careful if you break up with him though, because you need to be sensitive and let him know that even though you two wont be dating anymore, you still definitely want to be his friend and you still care about him. i think you should talk to your mom and let her know that its not his fault that he has so much, as she said, 'baggage', and that you do really like him. tell her how great of a person he is even though hes been through a lot, and show her how strong and positive he is. hope this helps=D
8dErRlE1aa	First of all, whether or not this guy wants to be more than friends with you, the way he is going about it is REALLY immature and kinda mean.<br>  <br>  It does seem like this kid is in some way interested in you, but to what degree I can't tell just from your little description.  For that part, I would trust your friends' opinions.<br>  <br>  There are two possibilities I see in this:<br>  <br>  1. For whatever reason, he either thinks that you have been paying less attention to him or he figures what he is doing now will get him more attention alone.  It also seems to work, which is just going to continue to fuel him to act this way.  He may like you or just really likes when you pay attention to him, and by doing what he is doing now (with trashing your stuff) he is enjoying the extra attention.  If this is the case, you need to talk to him and tell him that he can't keep doing that kind of stuff, but in a very serious tone.  Let him know that if he continues to do it, that you don't really want to be friends with him anymore.<br>  <br>  2.  This is the less likely situation, but this kid might just have an anger problem.  Maybe he doesn't really speak up at home and holds things inside until he sees you in school.  Here's the catch though... EITHER WAY, this kid is at least interested in you to the point where if you kissed him, he would kiss back.  If he has anger problems though, just let him know clearly that he cannot keep doing what he is doing, and maybe by trying to talk to him about his issues, he'll be happier and stop doing his things.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that either way, he is enjoying any attention he gets from you.  You need to clearly lay out for him, in a serious and not joking manner, that he can not keep acting out the way he does.  Telling a teacher might fuel him even more, but you might want to just move to another desk if he pulls that kind of stuff, or anything to not give him the attention he wants.  If you like him back too, he may be a great kid, but you have to make sure that he stops this behavior if you ever want to do something with him.  If he is able to "get you" by acting out the way he is, he will only continue to use it to his advantage.  Do yourself a favor and deal with this situation as soon as you can so he doesn't get worse and you can be a bit happier.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything
xrq4qKRbaa	My opinion for you is if this is his woman and he has so little respect for her. He may do the same to you. I would have enough self respect to say something to him. Tell him you are aware of this other woman and you feel like you are getting in between them. Get it out in the open and see what he says she may just be a sister or she may be his wife / girlfriend. You can't make a judgment call till you know all the facts and you can't find that out with out asking a few questions.<br>  <br>  Please do this before it gets even more complicated and harder to get out of with all feeling in-tack.|`|cggkcAC5aa	Hm, lol he sounds like he is 100% off limits<br>  =]<br>  It would be nice if you could help me with mine too<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309144913AAzhNXV">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>
aeiP74PLaa	wtf man the toilet is like  2 feet away but i can understand if u dont want her to see ur d****ck if i were u id ask her whats wrong if its the pee thing tell her its natural
YmEGCGtnaa	I agree with the 1st answer it could possibly be depression. <br>  <br>  Sometimes having a baby changes your focus so much that you dont even think about sex anymore, and can sometimes make you feel less into your husband bc youre so into the baby, but to not even find him or anyone attractive is a ltitle extreme. <br>  <br>  It could also be PpD (post-partem depression) bc it's only been 7 months. my baby si almsot 8 mons and there are tiems where I feel like she's all that matters to me, and even times where I feel isolated bc I stay at home with her a lot. I find the days I dont go out or talk to anyone not even on the phone and my bf gets off work late usually (like 8-9 pmish) I start to feel isolated and caved in and like that's my whole life and world. Dont get me wrong, I love being with my little girl all day and dread the day I go abck to work, but it isnt healthy top just see and talk to our babies all day and no one else. <br>  <br>  While it's true that your baby girl should be your first priority, sometimes to the point where every1 else even your husband, go on the back burner, it's not really healthy to never see anyone else besides your husband and baby. You're a mom now, but you still ened friends or other family members soemtimes, and your husband and you to have chemistry etc. you and him probabnly dont get along anymore bc of how youre feelign and it's affecting him.<br>  <br>  I would see somebody about your feelings.|`|e6d4e32d1f84dc3fa8623164005afb1faa	Oh honey you sound like your suffering from postpardom depression.<br>  Your hormones are all out of wack do to having a baby, go see a doctor and you'll be fine.|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Girl I am the other woman in my situation.

7A69Ym5qaa	I can tell you that I'm quiet, yet I don't know. He for all you know he is collecting intellegence to see if you like him or he is very secretive and just wants to see you, knowing (he thinks) that it would never work a d has no one else to like/ likes him|`|uWJJyNR3aa	you're a year older than him though....<br>  <br>  but anyways the away messages are for sure about you<br>  ... if i were you i'd im him and be like "hey. im sorry if you took the quiet thing as an insult. i've always liked quiet people ;)"
5PMdlc1aaa	That's strange, maybe they were talking about you or something private that she doesn't want you to hear. You should ask your friend. I have no idea about her putting her head down, maybe she's still hurt about the break up.
41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Not about yourself too much! You may have a really boring life or hobby and he may be more interested in you than what you do.<br>  <br>  Ask him about himself, if you have any likes/dislikes in common, tell him and chat about those. Keep it light and fun, maybe the political situation in Iraq is not such a good idea.....<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6qljYOO2aa	Your ideas for the future.<br>  Why you chose that college.<br>  Any family issues.<br>  If you could change your life.<br>  Best relationship/worst.<br>  <br>  :]
iJR6qAV9aa	So just talk about anything randomly if its Monday ask him what he did the weekend. March break is coming up soon so ask if hes going anywhere exciting. If you guys share a class ask for any notes you might of missed. Talk about how much you dislike a certain teacher in the school. Ask him for homwork help if hes smart.. tell him a funny story , or a random fact about yourself. <br>  <br>  Yeah if you would answer a question simply yes or no then it seems like you're not putting in much effort to keep the convorsation going. So you're definitely leading him off. And it does seem like you're not interested. <br>  <br>  Yea I probably would.<br>  <br>  And Lastly, its possible i mean theres this guy that would always look at me and smile. And he did want to talk to me before but i turned him down telling him i was busy..and he asked me for a pencil you know tried to get my attention at times. He would always be looking in my direction. Anyways .. i guess he stoped and moved on... I noticed and then i started thinking why he stopped and then i'm like well am i ugly now..to my friend. She just laughed. I never really liked him it was just a good feeling to know that you're noticed to somebody else..

iJR6qAV9aa	Well you can try to approach her just not in a scary way. ;P<br>  When you're driving by her or skating.<br>  Be like "Hey I see you jogging a lot my names ____ whats yours?"<br>  Then be like "you go to my school right"<br>  and then you can show her that you're a nice person be like<br>  "you're really pretty." If you think she is...(of course) <br>  You will seem respectful using the term pretty other then hott or<br>  sexy..  it will seem like your judging her by natural beauty not her body<br>  or anything elseee. Anyways if its a hot day. You could be like<br>  "I'm really craving an ice cream its so hot outside.. care to join me?"<br>  then you will get you're answer. You meet her. If its not hot outside<br>  you could offer her a ride or you can even offer to jog with her. <br>  So many possibilities. ..|`|uJGQbC1Saa	add her n be like hey do you go to blah school i think ive seen you around before
xETCO0rUaa	Tell her babe!! If she doesn't like you back it's closure you can move on after soooo many years. If she does then it's only the beginning. <br>  Make sure when you tell he you are already having a conversation and you don't randomly tell her hey i liked you since the 1 grade. <br>  what's the worste that can happen? she says no thats all!! She can't spread rumors about you or anything because she doesn't go to your school and he friends probably don't even know you. Make sure you tell her in a settle way.|`|I7xqh1DDaa	Well I think you should tell her how you feel if you never tell her then how is she ever gonna know how you feel?Your right she may feel the same way but if not at least you don't have to go another day thinking "if only I should have told her".|`|K1h9x0s5aa	ok so the best thing to do is to just tell her how you feel. If you dont then you will always wonder the "what if" and thats not a good feeling. Yes she may say ya'll should just be friends but atleast then you would know where she stands.|`|TlSUgrU3aa	i personally think you should go for it but ask her  about the past to see if she ever liked you to if she did ask her how about now you should go for it life doesn'tways give you what you want truTrueme|`|MtQ9ea2Uaa	No, don't tell her. Her response will most likely be an awkward "Oh.. That's cool.." instead of a "WOW ME TOO! MARRY ME!" since all you've been doing is casual talk over the internet.. If she doesn't or never felt the same way that might just things really awkward. even if you guys don't want to admit it to yourselves, it will be.<br>  However if you are not interested in a relationship or anything with her you just want to tell her, go ahead. When you listed your choices on what to do you telling her you've liked her since the first grade seemed like what you wanted to do. "Be haunted every day thinking I would have just told her.." Do whatever you want.|`|AA10731562	ask her if she likes you and then problem solved and depending on if she said yes or no ,  go on a date with her

QoS8ChCnaa	I'm a girl also, but most girls have a small 'happytrail' also... It's not just guys who get it:p
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.

After all these years of feeding him, giving him everything, I dont' think you should take their son away. The same if you're underaged<br>  But if you (as well as him) are legal age.

GLz2sX28aa	You can answer your own question by, the next guy you meet and want to get to know, put him on probation from sex...2 - 3 months.  Eat together, talk, go to movies, do other fun things, get his opinion, see how he acts with you and people around him.  See how he acts when he is disappointed.  Find out what he doesn't like to do ..that so happens that is what you do like...and see if he will do it for you.  Find out what he thinks of his parents and siblings.  Does he make you laugh?

d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	A gold digger isn't a woman who dates only wealthy men. <br>  A gold digger is a woman who dates wealthy men for their money. If there are genuine emotions involved it is different. <br>  The term gold-digger refers to the type of woman who becomes involved with a wealthy man not because of genuine affection but only because of the money he can offer her. <br>  Of course financial security is important but the distinction you're failling to note here is that a gold-digger acts out of pure selfishness and greed, with no real care for the man providing for her. <br>  A woman who looks for a wealthy man with the goal of getting to know him and falling in love is not a gold digger, she is genuinely interested in finding a partner to share her life with and the fact that he has to have money is no different to other women who may or may not choose to date blonde haired men. Or women who only choose to date athletic men. <br>  It is the sincerity behind the act that lends credit to the gold-digger reputation. <br>  If the woman is not sincere - gold digger<br>  If she is genuinely in love - lucky woman.|`|i7rEzn8daa	yeaaaa,<br>  thier just using them to get clothes, accessories, tickets to things.<br>  i've seen it happen everywhere... it's pretty rude.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	because they are.<br>  <br>  that is why we work hard to be rich.<br>  <br>  call me.|`|iYEWbE23aa	Perspective my dear constable.<br>  There's a guy I really like at the moment, we've been friends together while me and my ex were dating and he's been with me all the way.<br>  If he was the poorest and ugliest person on earth, but with the personality he has. I'd still love him.<br>  <br>  Some people may view this as a lie, or something else but it's how people see their lives. People judge, but who is to say you can't?|`|iJxetJS1aa	It's a good point, men are attracted to beauty while women are attracted to success. The difference is no man is foolish enough to marry propose to someone solely based on the girl's appearance, appearance is always a bonus.

uGY1eopqaa	One of my amazing guy friends set up a Valentine's date for me because I had just broken up with a jerk boyfriend. He set up my room completely. He got glow in the dark star stickers and placed them all over my ceiling. There was a huge red fluffy blanket on my floor with a picnic basket filled with all of my favorite foods. (and I'm a very picky vegan eater.) He put so much thought and effort into it, it was the cutest thing ever. I wish I dated him, but I was too afraid to ruin the friendship, so I held off. Now he's off treating another girl like a princess. :[ lol.|`|l33PNszHaa	one time i went on a date with my lovely girlfriend and we went out to eat so i came in a tux, and she thought it was cute cause i never wore a tux, so we went out and i had to go to the bathroom so i went to the bathroom and i came back with toilet paper on my shoe and she just giggled, we started talking and then after that i had to take her home so i took her home and she told me to come inside, so i did, her parents werent home so i was thinking that she wanted to do something mysterious *wink* but ended up that she only wanted me to help her with her homework lol, then after something happened :)|`|ZMU06oTjaa	My boyfriend and I had been dating for a few months and we both went to my best guy friend's birthday party together..

Well, my dad and sister had been watching home movies so we sat on the couch and started watching some, but all of a sudden the video that popped up was my sister and i naked in a bath when we were 5! He started cracking up and said, "Is that you?" I started laughing also and i grabbed his hand and said, "Let's wait outside for mom," before he could see any more. <br>  It was kind of more funny than embarassing, but it wasn't really that big of a deal.<br>  We're still dating now.

UtrgRjTeaa	It's ALWAYS unreasonable to "expect" sex from anyone. If she's comfortable giving you head, then great -- if she's not, don't be an *** by pushing the issue. Part of love is respecting the other person's feelings, so if she's not comfortable or not ready, respect that and don't make her do anything she's uncomfortable with. And you also need to understand that just because she's comfortable with it one day doesn't mean she will be tomorrow.<br>  <br>  (If she's not meeting your needs sexually, then you are totally within your rights to end the relationship if you find that to be a deal-breaker, or to continue with the relationship without getting any head. But you have no right to "expect" any head from her. Does that make sense?)|`|T5RHCYgNaa	If she really likes you then she will without hesitating|`|6kgin3FJaa	relax.... it will happen when the time is right.  Don't push someone into an act they are sure of yet.  Different people have different morals and if your gf is not ready or she has high morals and if you love her you or like her a lot you will need to be will be patient with her.  There is always your "right hand" until she's ready.|`|VrmlehM2aa	a month is pretty fast. but it also depends on the girl.<br>  a relationship shouldnt only be about sex, although thats all guys seem to want.<br>  most girls i know would wait about 5-6 months before they did anything other than kissing..<br>  <br>  if you truly love her, you will wait.|`|1UZMBxpeaa	it depends. first off, some girls just dotn like giving oral and mite not be that experienced in it. second, if she doesnt want to give oral you cant push her becus thats just how some people are.|`|06O8FaOjaa	EWW YU WAY TO EASY|`|koP1PaVjaa	Depending on the girl- probably. If you like her, you should go slow. Only worry if she's giving all your friends oral and none to you.
Yrtm9Rimaa	Are you insane!!! ,I would like her more|`|sTFiWuYLaa	Nothing wrong with that, man.  If anything, be happy as this represents she's not a prude about sex.  I'd say watch porn with her, talk about what turns her on, what you like.  It's sexy talking to a girl who you are with about porn, easily leading to friskiness.|`|2GvhQtyhaa	not really i mean shes human...she's curious. i know a lot of girls who watch porn and their not lesbians or bad people. its just human nature.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	^ hell yea!
JjsArGujaa	Just chill for a while. Don't make yourself depressed. Look at all the people you would hurt. And you dont know what's gonna happen in the future. Don't ruin your life like that over a guy. Get your best friend and call her, talk to her about everything. I'm sure she'll be there for you.|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	Don't get a boyfriend to make yourself feel better, that's never a good idea.

All you need is a good friend|`|xSss5eICaa	Please, please don't kill yourself.  That's a long term solution to a problem that may not last that long.  First, you should go see a doctor to find out if a mental or physical problem is bothering you, and what can be done about it.  It would also be a great idea to join a support group and/or a church, and find yourself some good friends.
cQ22MEU6aa	If you are secure about your relationship with your girlfriend why should it bother you.  All people by nature want to know what other peoples opinions are.  It doesn't matter what the subject matter is.  It's like having a big group of friends and being able to go to any of them at any given point for some advice or for something as simple as a pat on the back.  Don't look at it like people are trying to control your relationship.  That is not the case.  Just be thankful and if she comes to you be open about your feelings.  Communication after all is the key to success in anything.  For the most part anyway.  Intimacy, honesty, and trust are important as well.  Just talk to her.  If you feel like she doesn't know what she is doing in your relationship are you sure you aren't using that as a crutch to control her in your own way.  Answer the questions you have about your relationship before you start questioning her motives.  Good luck.  Keep your head up.|`|Qbm3Vpilaa	there's nothing wrong with getting advise ,she may or may not take it serious its not childish .|`|AA10495394	I get advice from the people on yahoo answer all the time.

0KXiwjDbaa	Soldier, I mean, cadet, love is a battle field and your heart is the battle ground.<br>  <br>  What is your mission, cadet?<br>  <br>  “To find a boyfriend, Ma’am?” you ask.<br>  <br>  No, cadet that is not your mission!<br>  <br>  You are only 12 years old and there will be plenty of time for boyfriends in the future.  You only get to be 12 once so spend every precious moment enjoying being a kid.  Did you know that secretly grown ups wish they could play with their x-box all day, play with their dolls or hang out at the mall with friends and just be silly.  They can’t play all day because they have to worry about things like paying the rent, buying gas and groceries, and taking care of their precious kids like you.  <br>  <br>  I know you may be thinking that you might like to try grown up stuff like having a boyfriend, but it is no where near as fun as just being a kid.  Plus, it is a lot easier to get a guy to be your “friend” than it is to get him to be your “boyfriend” because some 12 year boys are still very much afraid of “cooties.”   Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  So I ask again, “What is your mission, cadet?”<br>  <br>  “My mission is to be a kid and have fun, Ma’am!” you answer.<br>  <br>  Very good!  At ease cadet; carry on!  :)<br>  <br>  Love, <br>  <br>  Drill Sergeant Leslie|`|EW95Go90aa	1st of all, your WAy too young for this kind of speech, 2nd of all, send him vibe, keep the loving connection strong till high school, then let it happen and twill all work out|`|oxpc2P6Vaa	ok well try to make him notice you give hints that you like him<br>  your 12 u have ur whole to date trust me its not as great as you think all guys want now is sex so be careful who you pick  and the other girls are nothing but 2 faced and you only need one boy friend
IikDr2Elaa	Ok, the truth is it isnt that big of a deal. its a story to tell your grandkids or gossip about with friends, but in a few years you will look back on it through every other guy youve kissed and it wont seem like a big deal at all. i promise. dont worry too much about being good...i was REALLY worried about it and it seriously makes things worse...i am telling you go with the flow, if he has kissed other girls he will most likely take the lead, and just follow and you will catch on, trust me. people always said that to me and i didnt understand it but you really catch on right away. the truth is my 1st kiss was horrible and i was not sober(have been for over 2 years now) and had no idea what was going on, and the guy was an asshole...but after it seemed like a bigger deal but even though my 1st sucked its not a big deal at all, i honestly hardly think about it at all unless the subject comes up. if he is a nice guy go for it. biggest tip is dont get too heavy into it right away, start out sweet and slow. you will be fine i swear|`|Z9kwueR7aa	see, it is a big deal for girls. My first kiss was just the way i had always imagined. Me and my X on the beach in Santa Monica, it was a night but the restaurant's lights were on the shore, and he was hella handsome and that's where I had my first kiss which was amazing. So don't stress out about it, when his lips touch you, you will kiss him instinctively. You will always remember your first kiss.

It was not really a big deal for me but it sounded like it was a big deal for her. I dunno but maybe its different for girls or it depends on the person. I did not really judge her kiss although i felt like she was doing it wrong lol|`|SlR0Cp5saa	My first kiss happened in my house. Haha that's the last place I thought it would happen. My friend and I were hanging out and he was about to leave and I gave him a hug and then he put his hand under my chin and he kissed me. I would say it's a big deal. Every girl waits for their first kiss and it's exciting once it does. Usually a first kiss happens by surprise and you won't really be kissing back so it doesn't matter if you're good. Just have fun with it!|`|FxIZUUY5aa	well, im 16, and i havent had my first kiss yet.<br>  i think it is a big deal, and im pretty excited for it to happen.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	no.  just that green girl.|`|3uD1Ncubaa	Well, I would but only if you REALLY like him, want him to be your first kiss, and are sure he likes you in the same way.<br>  <br>  I myself have yet to experience my first kiss, I'm just waiting for the right guy to come along.  I've had some guys who just said they'd hook up with me, but I'm like, no, because I don't want my first kiss to be a hook up, I want it to be with my first boyfriend or someone special.  I want it to be something I will remember as nice.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|K4Q3eirFaa	Personally, for a girl I think it is a big deal.<br>  <br>  Its something you will remember forever.<br>  I dont think you want to kiss this guy, he just sounds like someone who will kiss you and leave you. <br>  <br>  I think you should wait for someone who is spectacular and have it be special, so if in the future you look back and realise what a dope the guy was, at least you can say it was cute (:|`|cggkcAC5aa	My 1st kiss was amazing. it was at night under the stars out side. i remember it like it was yesterday ='] im sure yours will be good too<br>  =]<br>  It would be nice if you could help me with mine too<br>  <a href="http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309144913AAzhNXV">http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|JJMa25NWaa	uhm...stories? it was on saturday. we were out and the mall was closing, and i had to leave. i hugged my boyfriend goodbye, he lifted my chin and kissed me. advice? it's really no big deal, relax.|`|fSkt7SgDaa	It's a little important because I guarantee you will remember it forever. If he cares about you then it doesn't mater if you are a good kisser. You will become better over time. Just relax|`|jhnO5Ptraa	no offense but he sounds like a player.Hes probably just tryin to get in your pants.|`|kpOhopALaa	its not realy that big of a deal lol :-0|`|gM4exZNEaa	Okee, story :)<br>  <br>  Well I went out with my current boyfriend to the cinema. We were just sitting there watching Stardust with him and it came to a really sweet bit. He had his arm around me and I had my head on his shoulder. He turned to me, I looked up, and he kissed me!<br>  <br>  It's not a huge deal, just make sure he likes you and he's not taking advantage of you. You should only kiss someone if it means something! Because if he just hooks up, then you'll only get hurt if you have feelings for him and he doesn't have them back. Just be careful ok?<br>  <br>  He won't judge you if he's a good guy. He will gladly help you learn! ;)
ItA6oEGCaa	Stay with her. After time people grow bonds that can't be ignored. Once you think that's there ask her out again, odds are she'll recognize the bond and she'll agree.|`|WNOY4muqaa	i suggust to try to just be friends but u can flirt with her and maybe change her mind<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An6uABB0m1Fly2xBZHNHiOjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309161406AAvKXy6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  Help Me With My Question?|`|CzIaAnsraa	ask her out - u like her enough for her to be in your dreams - its a good sign|`|1UZMBxpeaa	omg. that is so sweet. ask her out. did she really say "i don't like you" or was it just implied. if she said it that way then just try to be her friend and see where it takes you. feelings can change good luck!|`|xfomnGCVaa	b persistent. that happened 2 me. i turned down this guy that i realize now i really luv.  and he pops up in my dream. so if u ask her out again maybe she'll say yes. u never no! good luck!
e0Ghr6Dwaa	You're still young so I wouldn't worry about it too much. Do what makes you feel good. Try talking to her about how you feel and see if anything changes. Imagine life without her as your girlfriend. Would you like that? You should write a list of Pro's and Con's and see what you come up with. Best of luck!!! <3|`|JjsArGujaa	Yeah, I mean seriously.. Why do you want to keep gaining more and more feelings for her over the next 2 years and then when you can't be with her anymore, you're just going to be hurt 20 times worse. I think that you should break up with her. But that's just me, do what you want hah(: but good luck!
eGpOIV12aa	STOP! <br>  <br>  stop feeling alone and feel like you dont know what to say in public.<br>  <br>  live your life like your heart cant be broken and you will find the one that you been looking for. women hate men who have no confidence in themselves and most men find it a turn off when women arent confident in themselves.<br>  <br>  hold your head high, flirt like there is no tommorrow and speak your mind. dont validate yourself by what others think but by what you think
b01387efbdf5540b5d80ba517844fe0caa	You'd be surprised how shyness can be considered cute. If you get along with a girl decently, either ask or text "I hope I'm not being too forward, but would you like to go on a date sometime?"<br>  <br>  The first half is polite and respectful, the second reels 'em in. Plus it doesn't sound creepy or obsessive, and gives them an out if they're not interested without either of you looking bad.|`|qHOlnmCeaa	Depends on the girl, but a good way would be to find out where they hang out, or who you have in common and plan a way you can hang out together so you can chat and get to know one another before leaping in! That way you can gage whether you have anything in common and whether they like you.
QcbgIBghaa	nope, he just wants to use you..if he flat out told u he didnt like you, then theres the answer, dont fall for that "o i wanna kiss u, etc" hes lying, especially if hes moving, hes prob trying to "get with u" b4 he moves away|`|iPxV5ELKaa	He told you to your face he doesn't like you, i wouldn't let the dick near me. I want to kiss Misako Uno, but I don't know her. He thinks you're hot and wants to **** but doesn't care about you.|`|fgXnEx2oaa	if he dont wont date you then he just wonts sex if you date him wait a while and see if he trys to make a move|`|JMiIjqyGaa	This guy seems like a douche..find yourself someone better who doesn't play you like a puppet.|`|EW95Go90aa	he probably just likes you for your body,<br>  he seems really shallow, the kids who look kind of bored all the time is because they want a girlfriend. look for those kinds of boys and send his a vibe, if hes decent, he'll respond kindly|`|DkScpJN8aa	He thinks your attractive, cute, hot, so yeah he wants to kiss you, he probably wants a lot more, he only likes you for your body, not your personality xxxx|`|qstFTGz6aa	he probably just wanted to make out with the hot chick. a lot of guys don't care if they like the girl as long as they're hot.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	kiss him.|`|2c88J3M7aa	He doesn't like you, he just wants you cause you look good, nothing more than a kiss

otTMXJvRaa	Hi Kiddo,<br>  <br>  First off, what age should young ladies start dating???? I'd say that 16 or 17 is a good age to start dating.<br>  <br>  You sound like a very nice young lady… but seriously, age 12 is a bit young to start dating.<br>  <br>  Obviously, your parents are 100% responsible for taking care of you, feeding you, housing you, protecting you, and they pay all of the bills. They get to decide all of the rules... including when you can date.  <br>  <br>  Period. Case closed.<br>  <br>  When you are 18, then you will be a legal adult. If you don't like your parent's rules, then you can get a job, move out, and pay all of the bills yourself.  <br>  <br>  But since you are focused on dating issues right now, let's discuss those issues... plus a few more.<br>  <br>  Kiddo, it's certainly OK for you to ask questions about why things need to be a certain way. Your question about dating is normal, and so is your desire to date.<br>  <br>  However, consider this: Do you think that kids at age 12 should be allowed to drive a car on the public roads with the rest of the adults? Just because they want to drive?  No, me either. Driving a car is very dangerous, and it requires responsibility and good judgment. The DMV gets to decide how old a person must be to get a driver's license.<br>  <br>  Just like driving a car, dating is also an adult activity. It requires responsibility and good judgment. So, your parents get to decide when you can start dating.<br>  <br>  On a quiet evening, start talking to your Mom.  She'll likely be happy to talk to you about boys.  <br>  <br>  Since you wanted some advice, here are some examples of both good and bad methods of communicating with your parents…<br>  <br>  Bad:<br>  "Hey… Bee, Cee, and Dee are already dating and kissing. I wanna date too!!"<br>  "I'm mature enough to date!!!"<br>  "Stop treating me like a baby!!!"<br>  Then stamp your feet, storm off to your room, slam the door, and pout for the rest of the day.<br>  <br>  Good:<br>  "Dad, can you tell me about how you and Mom first met? What did you do on your first date?"<br>  "Maybe it's good that I'm not dating yet. Dee was in tears last week about her BF… he's acting like a creep. Mom, how can I spot a creep?"<br>  "At what age were you allowed to date, Mom?"<br>  "My plan is to save myself for marriage, and the other girls laughed at me. But won't saving myself for marriage be a good way to weed out the jerks and losers, Mom?"<br>  "A senior girl said I won't be able to keep a guy interested without sex. I don't believe her, because no decent guys will date her… only creeps ask her out. I only wanna date decent guys, Dad."<br>  "Hey Mom… when do you think I can go on my first date? You can meet whoever the guy is before we go out."<br>  Listen to your parent's input. Don't respond immediately to their comments… sit there for a few seconds and then say "Wow, that's good… thanks!"<br>  <br>  Your parents know that there are some guys out there (young and old) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. Guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Your parents want to make sure that you are old enough and mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No". <br>  <br>  Your parents also know that you could meet a nice guy and you both really do think that you love each other, and after a few weeks or months you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together... and perhaps have sex. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. Your parents want to make sure that you are old enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.<br>  <br>  Your parents know that having sex when you are not married is simply wrong. They know that having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special.<br>  <br>  Take a quick look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions. <br>  <br>  Kiddo... crushes/love/kissing/sex are wonderful intimate expressions that can all be compared to fire.<br>  <br>  Both intimacy and fire can be dangerous if used improperly. Your parents are old enough to use fire safely (such as an outdoor BBQ gas grill), and they are also old enough to handle intimacy properly. <br>  <br>  Just like you are not allowed to play with fire... you and some Romeo should not be seriously dating or intimately kissing too young... because that type of intimacy naturally leads to sex.<br>  <br>  When used improperly, you know that fire can cause serious damage. Intimacy, when used improperly, can also cause serious damage... such as heartache, pregnancy, and STD's.<br>  <br>  Don't be too eager to play with fire, Kiddo.<br>  <br>  Always call the Fire Department (your parents) for assistance if a problem with fire (intimacy) develops... no matter how small the problem might appear to be. Small problems can quickly become large problems if they are not handled properly.<br>  <br>  Kiddo, your parents want you to date nice guys who will treat you with dignity and respect while you are having innocent fun together during your youth. Honorable guys who would not ask you to do anything inappropriate… like sneaking out of the house. <br>  <br>  Long term, your parents want you to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. A guy who will be proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is honorable and is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.<br>  <br>  You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. That is much more likely to happen if you start dating too early… or sneaking out of your house.<br>  <br>  And, you do not need to rush things. Enjoy your youth. Don't worry if your friends are all "hooking up"... you don't need to do any of that nonsense. Your friends have probably already experienced severe heartache and shed bucketloads of tears… problems that you have avoided thus far.<br>  <br>  Your parents know that you will be really happy when your are older, and you look back over your life... happy that you made the right decisions about these issues when you were young... because you were mature enough to make the right decisions.<br>  <br>  That's the big picture your parents are looking at here, Kiddo.<br>  <br>  Can you see the dating issue a little bit from your parent's perspective now? If so, then you're ready to discuss dating issues with one or both of them in a logical and rational manner… not to get them to let you start dating early, but to confirm their concerns are valid.<br>  <br>  Now, go and give both of your parents a big hug. Thank them for caring enough about you to set limits.<br>  <br>  Take care and God bless,<br>  - Charlie<br>  <br>  P.S. - If you are looking to have a good High School experience... including the BF part... then it would be a good idea for you to join sports teams at school. There will be less free time for you to dwell on BF and dating issues. Plus, you'll be in good shape, and you'll look cute in the competitive outfits at the games. Guys are absolutely fascinated by female athletes, and love seeing them in shorts and t-shirts... with minimal make-up... and they won't care if you are sweaty and your hair is a bit messed up. No kidding. You'll have more boys looking at you than you ever thought was possible. And your wardrobe costs??? Essentially zero! In addition, your Coach will be around to keep an eye on you and give good advice if you need it. <br>  <br>  Finally, you'll develop more self esteem, confidence, self control, better judgment, and you'll be much less likely to get into trouble. You'll be stronger mentally, and any BF relationships that develop will be more stable. Guaranteed 100%.
qW4GDpHsaa	i dont think you can make your mom like him no offence but if she does not like him ask her why she does not like him instead of trying to make her like him
JXrvbW7caa	Money & the frequency of sex|`|NW1oQMtGaa	It depends upon in your relationship,for example,if both of you trust one another,so you will not have much problem in trusting one another.If both of you are financially stable,so you will not have much problem or arguments in terms of money or financial matters.If both of you are satisfied sexually,so you will not have much problems or arguments about your sex lives or sex activities....etc..<br>  <br>  Arguments or problems is and will always be present in any relationship for there is no perfect relationship.All you have to do is to avoid arguments or problems to arise,just be wary and circumspect.For there would be somebody or something that will attempt to jeopardize your relationship.The best thing to do when problems or arguments arise,talk heart to heart and consider both sides and weigh them,if your side is wrong accept it, if his side is wrong,well let him show in a nice,loving,sweet and democratic way that his side is wrong.Tone pitch could ruin your communication for it can be misleading...so you better be wary about.<br>  <br>  Having a relationships and taking care of a relationship is not that easy girl..it is a challenge and career.For 100 % it will challenge your self.
ZsAvFHwaaa	I would tell her. It may explain your fumbling :) just be honest, relax, and enjoy it. Remember if things don't go wellthe first time, there is always round 2 ;)|`|aOUjMhUmaa	I've been in this situation.<br>  <br>  I think you should definitely tell her, and most women do find it attractive when a guy is a virgin. It's not like you're 45 and a virgin, you know?<br>  <br>  Be very cautious about this. You say she's "been with a few guys." You just need to make it up in your mind that you're okay with her being more experienced than you, because in some ways, it can be really emasculating.<br>  And in others, you feel kind of jealous, because you'll be super excited about having sex because it's all new to you, but she will be like, "meh... been there, done that... can't we do it later [tomorrow or whatever]" and that can be kind of discouraging.<br>  "Hope for the best, prepare [in this care mentally] for the worst." (Russian Proverb)<br>  <br>  I don't think it's a good idea, but you are your own man and you have to make your decisions.<br>  <br>  But regarding the honesty part, that is an absolute must. For her to find out later... she would feel horrible, because she would not approach the situation like it's your first, and then regret it for treating the situation like that.|`|vNvtwuBfaa	Make it a point of a Romantic evening to tell you that you'd like her to be your first.

Bx6xTLRbaa	She won't give clues. You have to step up to the plate and break her out of her shell! Are you shy? If you're not then it shouldn't be too hard to talk to her...it would sure make things easier!|`|BE5HlQseaa	maybe she will stare at you especially in your eyes but unlike a stalker and she may try to flirt with you and try to start a conversation. hope this helps.<br>  answer mine?<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As6U511GnDS7vWXeFxboJrHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309163615AAaxa0g">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ISMColXfaa	She probably won't be able to talk to you much, and definately not have eye contacts that are too long.

Then when you've got ahold of your love of life and confidence a new love interest will arrive. But do not grope for one in the desperation of rejection to fill the hole your last one left.

GvdH9UrNaa	Yeah, it is always a lot harder to shop for guys then it is for guys to shops for girls , at least to me it is. Well what I would get him is something he is into, like video games? Get him the latest game or a game you'd think he would enjoy or try some nice clothes , like a hat or t-shirt, or just write him a sweet letter . Don't buy him something to fancy, you guys have only been together for a week, so make it simple, sweet, thoughtful, and something that you know he is into.|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	I remember when I was 12 I would've gone crazy for a shiny pokemon card.

Dont buy anything expensive as the relationship is so new.   Be Happy :)|`|yf1A2FHfaa	Get him a tshirt with his favourite footie team.
d627d5200a5f5ac6b3ccb088437e0b28aa	It sounds as if fighting is the only thing in your relationship. If neither of you is actually willing to change and make an effort to stop fighting then it's not going to work. <br>  You need to learn to talk about your problems like adults rather than screaming at one another. If you can't learn to do that then you're better off apart.
8dErRlE1aa	This is a tough one, I realize, and I will do my best to help you out.<br>  <br>  I have obviously brought girlfriends home, as my brother has done, and I have a good understanding of how mothers work in this type of situation.<br>  <br>  Your problem is that she doesn't trust you.  Regardless of what you may think about her not liking you or anything else, trust is the biggest problem that she has with you.  You have hit your boyfriend, gotten pregnant, broken up, dated behind her back, and more instances it seems that would make his mother not trust you (and for good reasons too!).  The mother probably talks to other members of the family, as well as your boyfriend about her feelings towards you, and this only hurts your relationship even further.  His mother is going to be there for him for his entire life while nobody knows how long you will be in his life, so you must realize that you must respect his mother and understand how she feels.  The only way you are going to change ANYTHING is to first get her to trust you.  You must do this by not deceiving her (do not brown-nose her, suck-up, lie, etc.), but by being completely honest with her.  A mother will only try to break up her son and girlfriend if she does not trust the girlfriend, despite how perfect or amazing they are together.  You must also treat his mother (as difficult as it may be with the way she's treated you) as almost your mother (considering that if you got married, she would become your mother).  You must treat her with respect and be straight with her.  YOU CANNOT CONTINUE THE RELATIONSHIP unless you make things right with his mother... so do that as soon as possible.  Find a time to talk with his mother one on one.  Whether this be going over his house to have a private talk, or even going somewhere if she does not allow you in the house.  MAKE THE EFFORT to let her see how much this all means to you.  If you act out and get upset at her it will only further push her against you.  Talk with the mother with your utmost respect and honesty and let her know that you are serious about regaining her trust and will follow by her rules (as much as that sucks to do, and you shouldn't really have to, you are in a bad spot with her, so it is the only way).  Make sure that you are being honest as well, because if you are phony, she will detect it from a mile away and will trust you less.  So... let her know where you stand.  Let her know you would like to do anything to make her feel comfortable with you dating her son.  You have to compromise, and do not expect to have her immediately allow you to come over the house whenever you'd like.  ANOTHER thing I just thought of, but do not have sex or be constantly on top of each other when his mother is around.  Save that for when she is out of the house or busy somewhere else.  Doing that type of thing makes the mother feel uncomfortable and makes her trust you less.  Back to the conversation with the mother though, just have a sincere one on one talk.  After that one talk is done and hopefully you have resolved some things, make the effort to have another one on one soon after to clear up anymore things or see if you are still doing anything she doesn't like.  You must let her know that you are willing to do whatever you can to make it work and earn her respect and trust.<br>  <br>  As much as this all sucks, once you have her trust, you will have a much happier relationship with your boyfriend.  Just make sure you continue having that trust with his mother, like if she wants to keep something between the two of you, don't tell your boyfriend (she may have even been testing you).  If you end up doing all of this by talking with the mother, hopefully she will be on your side deservingly if you are in a fight perhaps with your boyfriend.  That is the best sign of all.  Mother's day is coming up in two months, so that would be a good time to get her a little something too.  You must think of this situation as if you were a mother and your son was dating someone like you.  It is not a case of that the things you did weren't that bad and you were forgiven and made up... it's that you do not trust that girl... and you do not trust her to be with your son.  If that girl were to make the effort to earn your trust though, you would feel much more comfortable with the whole situation, and that is what you should be aiming for.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I really hope this all does work out... you two really do sound great together.|`|AA11263103	Kill her with kindness.
AA11852487	ha dude it's the same with me right now. me and this girl are texting non stop and she just told me she wanted to tell me something and i think she's gonna say that she likes me. so i'm like waitin right now to see what it says. so i think since your in the same place i am right now...she definately has an interest in you.|`|p4wdTloEaa	well she might really like you ...but one of her friends might like you too mostly girls ask the guy that their friends like that question but if none of her friends like you then its probably her that likes you.

HKkbqlIuaa	Nothing you can say or do is truly going to make him feel better. The best thing for you to do is let him know that you are there for him whenever he wants to talk about it, and you support him in his endeavors. Let him know that there are tons of other universities that he can go to. In time, he should get over it. :) Good luck with everything!|`|ICTr6kHhaa	tell him he is retarded and should've studied harder.  now you will be entertaining all sorts of coeds in yer dorm room.  you wonder why they say to get an education?

PhPwAGVNaa	Avoid any big dates (e.g. birthdays, anniversaries).  So I recommend doing it a week after your 2 month.  You can stand another 10 days right?<br>  <br>  DO NOT USE CLICHES!  Do not say "It's not you, it's me" and PLEASE do not say "We can still be friends".  <br>  <br>  Ex-boyfriends often use these lines against you and gradually learn to hate you because of this.<br>  <br>  I broke up with a guy and used the friends line.  He apparently got mad at me because we stopped talking afterward and deleted me off facebook and called me a crazy "female dog" to everybody. :)<br>  <br>  So yeah, don't use cliches.  HOWEVER, you can be friends with an ex, but that decision lies completely with the dumpee, not the dumper.<br>  <br>  Do it in person!  Do not do it over the phone, through text, myspace, or email. <br>  <br>  Be ready with an explanation.<br>  <br>  DO NOT COMFORT HIM AFTER THE BREAK UP.  Avoid all temptation to contact him.  What you guys need is closure, and he may tell everybody that you're a tease, even though your intentions are good. <br>  <br>  Here is what I might say:<br>  <br>  " I think that I am not ready for a serious relationship quite yet.  I don't eve know what love is at this point of my life.  I think it'd be better if we stopped seeing each other.  Don't get me wrong, you're a great guy and great things lie ahead of you, but you're just not the guy for me. "<br>  <br>  BUT I don't know the guy.  Tweak the break up speech that best fits you and your soon to be ex.<br>  <br>  Break ups are never easy and you may feel regret afterward.  Avoid temptation to get back with him.  Move on, there's more to life!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Get like me. This is not worth it for sure, but there is no way of getting out of this without hurting him. You must be strong for both of you.|`|63tch8D5aa	hes sounds uber dramatic and i d say for you to get out as fast as you can, hes sounds kinda crazy too.<br>  <br>  write him a letter, or do it over voicemail.<br>  like text him saying i have to leave you a voicemail,<br>  bcause you dont really wanna do it over text,<br>  thats a bit low.<br>  <br>  tell him hes a great guy but he should find himself a girl who has the same ideas of love has he does.<br>  <br>  becareful|`|mpjuyvuzaa	omg, don't break his heart. but just say "baby, what we had was strong but we just have to go our separate ways, im not like your other gf's, im different, and i'll always be yours in a Special way".<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s- hes Special, i wouldn't break up with him|`|KMOyBNDBaa	he needs to calm the **** down.|`|kpOhopALaa	hes moving 2 fast lol|`|iehPVpukaa	Wow! what are you doing so young dating a guy like that..It seems like his obsessed with you..End things at a good perspective.

Now that you see him with another girl, it kills you inside & you realize how much you really do like/love him. Either way, it's a lose lose situation with you. Karma's a bad thing girl. :/ You broke up with him & left him broken hearted, now it's your turn to get the karma & feel the pain. All you can really do is let time pass since you promised you wouldn't tell him if your feelings have changed. I mean, you don't wanna break a promise right? Let time pass, and if it really kills you inside, you have to tell him. If you can see him & be fine, then be happy for him bc he's happy. (: Hope this helped!|`|Vv7a31pmaa	leave him.|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Things happen and things change. You must not look back at the past.
bSUipR3uaa	don't talk about her. talk about anything else. What do you talk about when you are with you guy friends. talk about the same thing.
7ulpcNi7aa	oral, spiderman kiss, what do u mean fooling around how far r u talking?
zzaScg0haa	Honestly it sounds like he isn't considering your feelings, take a step back and take a look at your relationship, your heart should tell you what to do
CVWizvy6aa	You just answered your own question. He likes your best friend.  So be a bigger person and back off.  Have some self respect, and also respect other people's choices.
cj0edEvKaa	How long have you felt this way? Was it before he had a gf or after he got one?  Maybe you are just a little jealous of the time he spends with his gf, that is probably why you started to get these feelings but it all depends when you started feeling this way towards him.  If he treats you the same as the other girls then I wouldn't get my hopes up.  If a guy likes you hes going to pay special attention to you!|`|gT9k3Z43aa	Do you think about him a lot? Make a decision for yourself- you do like him, or you don't. If you make the wrong one, you will know and that will be your answer (if you say you don't like him, you will know in your head if thats true or not, if not, then there is your answer). <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I don't think he likes you, you never know, he could- after all, you 'may' like him right? so you never know. The only think I can say is, if or when he breaks up with his girlfriend, let him know how you feel, it will be awkward afterwards, but at least you won't have that 'what if?' question in your head.<br>  <br>  Good luck! xx
VN3WlVL0aa	Ask your boyfriend if something is going on between him and his mother to cause her to act like this when he is around you. There may be an underlying problem that is causing this.<br>  <br>  Also, talk to his mother and ask her why she yells at him constantly. Do not become insulting or rude, but ask her gently. <br>  <br>  ?Doomwyte?|`|15kiWTGQaa	talk w. ur bf and see if he thinks there is a problem. There may not be. If her yelling doesn't bother him, then there isn't much you can do. Talk to ur bf about how you feel.

XwyUATsKaa	You can't right now.  But when you go, be so good to her from Texas.  Make her want to move there, not because you're pressuring her, but because you are the sweetest, kindest, man she has ever been with.  <br>  <br>  Send her letters from Texas, flowers (if not too expensive), put some songs on a CD and mail it to her.  In addition, show her pictures of your place down there and how much of a "home" you have if you expect to have her live with you.<br>  <br>  You can do it!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ndVPHfmaaa	If you are ready ask her to marry you... just a thought|`|7e076a0be67ad9199649156f6917847caa	First and foremost,  you have to be respectful of her wishes.
