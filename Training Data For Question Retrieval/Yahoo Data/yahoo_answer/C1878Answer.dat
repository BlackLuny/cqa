Con ello casi todos los reproductores lo toman automáticamente. Hay algunos a los que tienes que decirles cual es el archivo de subtítulos.<br>  Ahora, si lo que quieres es integrar los subtítulos en la imagen para que ya no sea necesario el archivo aparte, hay programas de edición de video que lo hacen. No lo encuentro práctico, pues ya te queda la película con esos subtítulos sí o sí, y nunca podrás pasarla sin ellos o con subtítulos en otro idioma.<br>  Saludos

AA10102453	Not to worry. The modem speed listed is if you use a telephone line for internet connection. DSL is hooked up through the LAN connection. You will connect at your subscribed speed.|`|h4YPo90Maa	If you use wired DSL (wire with RJ45 connector plugs into your computer) you use the Networking Built-in 10/100Base-T Ethernet LAN . It will probably connect to your  DSL modem at 100 Mb/s. Your actual internet speed will depend on you internet plan and usually is between 600Kb/s to 5Mb/s download speed.<br>  <br>  If you use wireless DSL you use the Wireless Networking Built-in high-speed wireless LAN (802.11b/g) . 80211g has a throughput of 54 Mb/s maximum, 19 Mb/s typical.<br>  <br>  You will only use the 56 Kbps modem for dial-up internet and faxing.|`|ZIsFy7HXaa	DSL does not use the 56K modem at all...it uses the 10/100 Ethernet or wireless connection. The speed will be the DSL rated speed.
yHI6rfeUaa	All VoIP phone services that use the internet as the carrier are subject to service problems.  There is no getting around it.  <br>  <br>  For VoIP to work properly, voice packets must be marked for priority over data packets and all network hardware must respect and provide the priority.  This is critical because voice packets have to reach their desntiation in about 125 mSec for good voice quality.   If the packets are late or lost, Quality of Service (QoS) becomes poor or worse.<br>  <br>  Voice Packet slowdown and loss occurs whenever any network segment becomes congested.  When there is no congestion, no packets (data or voice) are backed up and QoS is fine.  In the real world, congestion happens in one segment or another all the time, much like major roads observe traffic back up periodically.  While you must have sufficient bandwidth for VoIP, sufficient bandwidth on your end does not assure end to end QoS.<br>  <br>  The general internet does NOT respect priority packet forwarding.  It is not designed to do so.  <br>  <br>  Therefore any phone service that uses the general internet for transport cannot assure any QoS because they cannot control the internet and the internet does not respect priority packet markings and priority dispatching of priority packets.|`|lOcX7WCSaa	most likely you don't have enough band width to support Skype|`|IFtV7g2Zaa	Getting cut off when using Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) has nothing to do with your credit, and everything to do with:<br>  1) Your internet connection<br>  2) Skype's congestion.<br>  3) Your computer's performance.<br>  <br>  First, most DSL and Cable, Internet connections are prone to frequent service "pauses".  In other words, one minute you've got an excellent connection, and the next its so slow you wish you had dial-up.  You're still connected, but for a few moments, no traffic goes in or out, or limited traffic gets through.  If that pause lasts longer than Skype's timeout period, then the call gets dropped.<br>  <br>  Second, Skype, being a mostly free network, has more customers than their networks can handle.  If enough people are connected simultaneously in your area, then there is less bandwidth available for everyone.  When this happens, a few people will lose their Skype connection so that others can continue talking.<br>  <br>  Third, you may have a fast computer, but if its infected with viruses or spyware, you may not have the necessary performance to utilize Skype.  Scan your computer for viruses and spyware.<br>  <br>  I use Vonage for my business lines.  Its a more expensive than skype, but for the home user it can be as cheap as $15/mo per line.  It drops the line maybe once in a month or two.  Both Vonage & AT&T's CallVantage work by plugging a standard telephone into the VOIP network device, so although your network must be up and running, your computer doesn't.

AA11573126	Why bother even trying to overclock a Presario?  If you succeed, you'll just make it unstable.<br>  <br>  The processor speed is based on the FSB speed and a clock multiplier that's locked on the processor.  The item that can be controlled is the FSB speed.  However, the BIOS on a Presario's OEM board would not have the ability to crank up the FSB speed in increments, the way the BIOS would on a retail motherboard.  I suspect you'll need a 3rd-party BIOS to get the incremental controls you need for overclocking.  Then maybe you can bump it by 5 or 10 percent.<br>  <br>  Last comment...You'll just make it unstable.|`|uoAxxzC8aa	i agree, i think it would overheat unless you put in an advanced cooling system, compaq's, like almost every other major corporation computer, never took much stock in cooling

Are u buying it for necessity of business or to spend time in enjoying the multimedia capabilities. So a laptop varies in price majorly on the three factors....<br>  <br>  1. Platform of processor (Intel Centrino: a.Core2Duo(High end), b.Dual Core or c.Cleleron / AMD: Turion (High End) or Sempron Mobile)<br>  <br>  2. Features available as it is (ex.RAM (DDR I or DDR II) and its Capacity, Hard drive capacity, Bluetooth, Wireless LAN, DVD Burner, IEEE fireware ports, media card readers... etc.<br>  <br>  3. Build & Backup of the battery. Lookwise u shud be satisfied and should deliver a decent amount of battery backup.<br>  <br>  One important and must look factor before purchase is the after sales support. So if the LAPTOP that u r mentioning does come with majority of all the points mentioned and if u r satisfied with the specifications then make a move.<br>  <br>  Acer is a popular brand..... so make decision by comapring with similar products....<br>  <br>  Happy buying|`|AA11638221	20999 $ or Rs/- ?

On the Acer the second partition is set for backups which so many people fail to do. So if the D partition is empty just delete it. To do that go admin tools in the control panel.

If there are external drives involved the drive letters may have to be changed. This i done via right click change letter|`|1PnXWqYcaa	I think what you should do is just take out all your stuff like on an external hard drive. Then what you do is just delete the drive that has been created already and then partition the drive like you want.

One partition could be for music, another for games and other important programs, and another for temporary files. Hope this helps!!!|`|WWhzNMxnaa	Unless you're rocking Linux or mac OSX you can't resize partitions.

m0lfLCNtaa	Hey, hey, don't be so hard on them!<br>     Google is one of the biggest search engines worldwide, and they have just launched their own internet browsing service, Google Chrome. And, also having Gmail and iGoogle, they seem like very busy people, and with hungry computers awaiting to feed in the updation software to all of you. Yet you want to complain??! Well, I`m sorry, but that is very un-grateful.<br>     Updating a software, (in this case, Google Earth) is not as easy as you may think it is, you don't suddenly notice all of the changes, and it does give you a full view of the earth, lets you search it, see your home/others houses complete with all of your garden items, such as a pond/shed. Often, updating something makes it faster, smoother to run, and easier to understand. Only when the company feel they have all this on their previous version, will they start working on how it looks, and extra features. <br>     What I'm saying is, with Google worrying about updating their internet, browser, iGoogle, Gmail, etc., they don't have a lot of time on their hands to meet your requirements straight away.<br>     I think Google Earth is pretty clever and neat, so what if it isn't perfect graphics? Do you really need those to find a location? <br>     Google Earth was not designed for people to locate a house or school, hotel, anything they like, and compare the distances. <br>     It is NOT meant to have 100% perfect graphics, you can see perfectly from the maximum zooming in tool, and spin around. If you don't appreciate it, try finding a Yahoo! version of it.<br>  <br>  Oh, wait.<br>  There isn't one. <br>  It is Google's special feature, please appreciate that.|`|oR1JbnPRaa	About Google Earth update can be read in <a href="http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=Google%20Earth%20update" rel="nofollow">http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=...</a>|`|5fVnwm0Aaa	they use various satellites that orbit the earth, they compile million upon millions of images to make one true earth, rather than update the pictures they have they are more working on composing pictures of the places they haven't, and they do actually update there pictures just not very often because it would take a hell of a lot of work.<br>  <br>  What they have done though is bring along street view, enable this in the bottom left task bar and you can view any street in the united states, all the images used in street view are no more more 1-2 years old!

Then get Norman Cook (aka fatboy slim) 'Skip to my Loops' refill, thousands of dope drum lines, easy to rearrange (each piece of the live recorded drum line is chopped up into 'slices', so you can move them around to change the beat).  Tons of different music genres.  You will not be sorry if you follow my advice.  Spend some money on Reason 4.0, and an M-Audio Axiom 61 midi controller.  Put the power at your fingertips.

81pm9Ckoaa	You need to get hosting and a domain name.<br>  <br>  I recommend one of these: <a href="http://www.hosttell.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hosttell.com/</a><br>  <br>  Powweb has the best offer right now. It's on a 50% sale - $3.88/month ($46.56/year), and you get a free domain from them. (like www.mywebsite.com)<br>  <br>  Their hosting plan includes web builder, so you can create your site just by drag and drop (without any programming), or you could install Wordpress (easy, one click install from their control panel), choose a theme that you like, and start adding content.|`|vvcaO1xgaa	What you decide depends on a number of factors, say, what kind of a server you wish to deploy your website on or your own skill set. You could use a third party tool like dreamweaver to design your application. Dreamweaver supports both client and server side scripting. The latter, in the form of ASP, PHP and Coldfusion. If you're sure you'd be deploying your application on a windows machine then you could also use ASP.Net which is rather simpler and cleaner as compared to ASP. Mind you, you'd be limiting yourself to microsoft's IIS server with ASP.Net.<br>  You may also use JSP if you wish to make your website independent of server platform. JSP is supported by a large no. of servers including weblogic. However JSP would require you to have good programming skills and an understanding of Java.<br>  <br>  After you've created your website you'd need to buy a domain name and host it on a public server (or even on your own machine if you have a public IP address. This would ofcourse mean allowing anyone and everyone access to your system if you can handle that!)|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Try using Macromedia Dreamweaver for the design and the contents of you website.

You can also buy a new domain instantly, or host your existing domain for free and make it your own (www.yourown.com)<br>  <br>  If your looking for something more advanced but still user friendly then try XsitePro, Sitebuilder Designs or Calvary Studios, they have everything you need in building your own website: domain name registration or domain transfer, web hosting, web builder, site maintenance and email accounts. Everything is laid out in an easy to follow step by step instruction. Some of the features included enable you to add your own themes, videos, images or mp3 music making your site unique to you. Pricing is comparable and affordable too. <br>  <br>  I hope that I was of some help and answered your question.|`|SwCKOP6xaa	Try front page or macromedia dreamweaver website templates to start with web.. then try to b innovative by making some changes into the ready made templates :) u'll gain HTML knowledge urself by doing such activity :)<br>  but for the start use front page or dreamweaver templates :)
4He3bNO7aa	Are you a musician?<br>  <br>  Most musicians in SL purchase a stream, but many venues have streams you can use. I'm no expert, but I have booked performers for events. You connect to the stream via a port code and that enables you to stream live into SL.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is to join two groups: Strangefates and Circe's Circle of Sound. Both are for live music venues with many varied performers. Look out for group notices (usually containing landmarks) and go to some of the events. In particular, speak to Circe Broom, who (I think I'm right in saying this) was the first person to run live concerts in SL. What Circe doesn't know about live music in SL probably isn't worth knowing. You can check out her live venue at a region called Laurel, where you will find two ground-level stages and another up in the sky called the Sunset Jazz Lounge. Circe is always looking to find new musicians in SL, so she's worth talking to, especially if you are a performer.

The power button on the front of the machine actually just signals the OS to shut down, and it then shuts down gracefully.<br>  <br>  If the power goes off instantly when you press the button, then your computer isn't the kind that shuts down gracefully. In this case, there is some risk of data loss if your disk drive is formatted in the FAT file system.  If it is NTFS, there will probably be no corruption of the file structure, but you might lose whatever the computer happened to be doing at the time you turned it off (if it was idle, chances are that it will be fine).<br>  <br>  If your power button turns the computer off instantly, it's better to use the Start button in Windows and select "Turn off the computer" to turn the machine off.  Normally after Windows shuts down it will turn the power off, but if this doesn't happen on your computer, you can turn the power off yourself after Windows shuts down.|`|c59cf7cc029c6a1b7b26e42a74c186caaa	Yes!!! should be the answer.

" onClick=\"javascript:urchinTracker('/out... . $site_client . "');\">example</a>";<br>  ?> <br>  <br>  <br>  Simply define the site_client variable to store whatever page you'd like the outbound link to show up as in the Top Content report and the site_link variable to store the hyperlink that should be followed when a user clicks the link.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...
SHXzkL6Gaa	People with watercooled systems have almost no airflow cooling the PWM and Northbridge, that is why these optional fans are provided - in order to cool these components.

Just make sure you have good air flow from your case fans and you should be ok.|`|HakdwKKAaa	That fan does almost nothing.

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked.

wQFZKkWHaa	I digital frame won't be able to act as a primary monitor, though you could still run a photo slideshow on a regular monitor of course. I've seen a few small peripheral or secondary displays, but none that are that size and meant to be used as primary displays.
SNZ88BfKaa	When the line of code in your setTimeout call is executed, the show() function has already fallen out of scope, which means your 'h' variable is no longer defined. Unfortunately, I don't believe having an inline function would work either,because the 'h' variable will only be in one scope, so it will stay at 51 after the loop is done executing (which will happen before 200 ms). <br>  <br>  So, you need to do this:<br>  <br>  setTimeout("document.getElementById( 'test' ).style.height = " + h + "+'px'",200);<br>  <br>  However, that will make all of it happen at once (all calls of that line will wait 200ms, and they all happen at about the same time). So, you'll want to do something like this:<br>  <br>  setTimeout("document.getElementById( 'test' ).style.height = "+ h +"+'px'",100*(h-25));<br>  <br>  You'll also want to prevent it starting over every time you mouse over. Also, you can't see any apparent change by changing the height of the ul (I made a div to make sure this code works).<br>  <br>  Edit: Now, with that all said, here's how I would do it:<br>  <br>  <script type="text/javascript"><br>  <br>  function show(div) {<br>   var h = parseInt(div.style.height);<br>   if (h < 50) {<br>    div.style.height = (++h) + 'px';<br>    setTimeout(function () {<br>     show(div);<br>    }, 100);<br>   }<br>  }<br>  <br>  </script><br>  <br>  <div id="test" style="background: green; height: 10px" onmouseover="show(this)">hi</div><br>  <br>  If you want explanation, e-mail me.|`|jSqUmFJJaa	If I'm reading this right, it all has to do with variable scope.  Instead of <br>  <br>  var h = 25;<br>  for(h=25; h<=50; h++)<br>  <br>  Get rid of your first declaration for "h" and initialize it in the for loop:<br>  <br>  for(var h=25; h<=50; h++)<br>  <br>  Give that a shot, and best of luck.|`|Tkb1TKwZaa	I'm not familiar with the "var" class, but try changing "var h" to "int h"?  Java might need you to tell it that "h" is specifically an int and not just a "var" to work correctly.

Secondly, there are CD burning programs that can create image files as well as burning actual CDs.  You use the two together.<br>  <br>  There are different types of image files, and some programs make their own type. Your best bet is to use the .ISO type, as that's the standard that all programs can use, and it usually works best.<br>  <br>  If you're using Mac or Linux, you probably have these things built-in already.  If you're using Windows,  you'll need something like Daemon Tools Lite, for the virtual drive, along with your CD burning software.

dca582dcac9ba5d7f83b88ba006f4da0aa	xml is basically a data source. I suspect you're xml file has some data in it which the flash file points to and uses as a data source so as long as its in the right folder it should work.<br>  <br>  Normally you'd use server\client side scripting (which is probably what the flash movie is doing) to parse the data in the xml file and display the images in the banner. You can't really put it in a page in its raw form, well you can but it wouldn't do very much or look very good either. Usually you'd transform xml into html\xhtml\pdf or some other format.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, any other questions just contact me :)<br>  <br>  *Edit it tells you on the page "Control the source path for each banner / image from the XML file"  so open it up in notepad (or dreamweaver) and make sure its pointing to images that exist and it should work!:)

yHI6rfeUaa	You are suggesting two different problems as follows:<br>  <br>  1.  Problems with a Linksys router<br>  <br>  2.  Problems with a Wi Fi signal range.<br>  <br>  Now let's review them in more detail:<br>  <br>  1.  Linksys and all other low end inexpensive home grade routers are low end, inexpensive, and home grade.  If you don't like low end performance, buy a better device and pay more.  Get a Cisco, an Adtran or a 3Com.  These are commercial grade, more stable and reliable, and better devices.  There is a reason they cost more - better hardware and better firmware.  Did you ever hear that you get what you pay for?  That adage hits home here for sure.<br>  <br>  2.  Wi Fi range - The 802.11 standard defines the range.  It is not infinite.  If you have range problems, add more wireless access points on your LAN as everyone else does.  This means running cable from the router to the access point.  <br>  <br>  My straight forward and explicit answers are meant to only clarify the issues without confusing.|`|BtcJHbILaa	just get a D-Link wireless N router.

GxXpvNIwaa	If your computer always restart, There are some reason:<br>  I. It's Hot in There<br>  Sometimes this can be caused by an overheating situation. Itunes, RealPlayer, Windows Media player,etc. require a lot of processing power to decompress and decode music files, which can cause the processor or hard drive to get hot.<br>  Memory Fails Me...<br>  If you determine that overheating is not the problem, the most likely suspect is bad memory.<br>  II. Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III.

jSqUmFJJaa	Could be any number of things, mate.  Post some more detail.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	DSL is NEVER 100 Mbps. This is the speed of your LAN connection. The broadband will be up to 8Mbps on most services, often a lot less. There are a few who claim higher, but they often can not deliver even eight. Your web page problem may be nothing to do with the connection.  Can you ping or look up an address? Try opening a command window (start/run and enter cmd) and type :<br>  nslookup www.bbc.co.uk<br>  nslookup www.yahoo.com<br>  You can do others, if you get a fast response you may have problem with your browser, try another to prove this. You could have spyware, in which case a scan in safe mode with a good fully updated anti-spyware.

1NWjta2jaa	Netbooks are great for exactly what they are designed to do - Internet, email and maybe some "light" computing (typing up a letter, a report, looking at photos, even light editing of photos.)<br>  If you want to run Photoshop or do video editing, or design something in Autocad, forget it. Not enough power. Yes, you can run some "real" programs on it, but it will be a pain.<br>  One more thing to consider is that Netbooks have no built in CD or DVD drives. If you need to install a program from a CD, you'll have to buy and use an external drive.<br>  In short, I love those things as an additional computer to carry around, but not as your main machine.|`|xtnzs27daa	I have one and I love it! It's the size that makes it so convenient. I would definitely recommend buying one. <br>  <br>  I have a 10" one cos I wanted one with Windows on (at the time Windows was only available on 10" versions), and the keyboard is just tooooooooooo small on the 8.9" one.<br>  <br>  The HDD on mine is 80GB but i've never found that to be an issue because all my files are saved on my network; they make a 120GB version for the same price now.<br>  <br>  Get one, they're perfect for typing, web browsing and email, but the battery life is a bit disappointing. (To buy a better battery is about ￡40)|`|AA11811976	The keyboard is slightly smaller on them,  yes.<br>  You will also need an external cd/dvd drive as they do not have them.<br>  Personally, I like them because they take a laptops portability and mobility to the level it should have been, and some have battery lives of up to 7 hrs.  However, to conserve energy they use very low profile specs (not the fastest) so I am going to wait a year or so and let the technology catch up.  Yes, those solid state drives of 8GB are brutal.<br>  Also, Vista sucks up so much of its resources most of them come with Linux or XP.  I probably wont ever use Vista so that works for me, but if for some reason you wanted it, you'll have to wait.|`|t5sYXwSqaa	I have a 7'' version and find that the keyboard is actually okay to use. The machine (linus based) loads very quickly and is very fast to use. I can do everything that I am able to do on an ordinary laptop with the exception oftwo things.

Make sure the one you choose has a good graphics card.<br>  <br>  The keyboards are not that small and are very easy to get used to or use. Better than a desktop for a student or businessman, (or woman) definitely.|`|M7i30zP6aa	I am in the same debate myself and here are my thoughts so far:<br>  <br>  1) If you go out alot and have access to wi-fi, it will make alot of sense to carry one of these around, especially one with long battery life, ie, at least a 6-cell configuration, so you don't have to take the charger with you and shave another pound in your bag.  Best choice will be Asus eee pc 1000HE on JR.com.  Around $350 after cash back from live.com.  <br>  <br>  Spec: Intel Atom N280 1.66GHz / 1GB RAM / 160GB Hard Drive / Intel UMA Graphics / 802.11N / Bluetooth / Webcam / Card Reader / Windows XP Home / 3.2 lbs<br>  <br>  2) I tried both 8.9" and 10" and you really want the extra inch.  The weight and size is not that far different but it makes reading alot easier and slightly bigger keyboard usually means better configuration as well.|`|qV5LuLA5aa	For a netbook a 120gb hd is more than enough. Your not using it for your main computer I hope. And the 10 in is the way to go. The keyboard isn't too too small and you get used to it after a while. Just make sure it has at least a 1.6 atom processor and a gig of ram. 2 gigs of ram would be better though.<br>  <br>  I had a Eee Pc 1000h for a while and really liked it because it was light and easy to take with me places. I gave it to my mom though since she got surgery and needed something small and light while she was in a wheelchair.

jSqUmFJJaa	A slide transition is how the slide comes on the screen... fade-in, fade-out, wipe, vertical.... Basically it's the animation that makes a slide come on the screen instead of the default "appear out of nowhere".|`|PXuoxlwbaa	each page is a slide. there should be a tab saying animations or transitions. a transition is hwo the slide enters or exits the page.|`|FthSZ0ngaa	In Powerpoint, each page is considered a slide.  When the page (slide) changes to the next page (slide), it is called a transition. Transitions have different effects that can be applied to them (slide left, right, up, down, fade, etc).  I would recommend doing a search on Google for free powerpoint tutorials.  You can find alot of information by viewing the tutorials for powerpoint.<br>  <br>  Other than that, play with the software and familiarize yourself with it.  The best way to learn something is by messing with it first.

Try issuing a traceroute to the site or use one of the proxy web services to see if you can get there from the other site through your network.

MxHC2HZJaa	eBay ha vari metodi di pagamento. Quello preferito (da loro) prende il nome di PayPal. Che cos'è? è un conto on-line che agisce in forma del tutto sicura perché non richiede la condivisione di numero di carta di credito o codici pin né da parte del venditore né da quello dell'acquirente. L'unico 'problema' di PayPal è che, qualora non dovessi possedere un conto in banca, i fondi del conto non sono trasferibili e quindi sono riutilizzabili esclusivamente con PayPal (e quindi, per esempio, per acquistare su eBay). è sufficiente registrarsi al sito <a href="https://www.paypal.com/it/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_registration-run&business_only_signup=1" rel="nofollow">https://www.paypal.com/it/cgi-bin/webscr...</a> e disporre di un indirizzo e-mail valido e di una carta di credito da associare (va bene anche la PostePay ma in questo caso si verifica quel problema di cui ti parlavo sopra).<br>  Qualora tu non divessi disporre di fondi sul conto PayPal non c'è da preoccuparsi se vuoi comprare un oggetto su eBay. PayPal infatti conclude senza problemi la transazione prelevando il denaro dalla carta che hai associato.<br>  <br>  Gli altri pagamenti previsti da eBay sono quelli classici: bonifico postale o bancario, contrassegno e pagamento per posta. è inutile dire che, pagando con PayPal (creata da eBay), sia il venditore sia l'acquirente hanno più privilegi, sono tutelati e concludono in fretta.|`|170qUt5Waa	altrimenti usi la carta di credito ma nn ti konviene fare acquisti finke ankora nn ti sei specializzata nel kampo cioè capito il sistema|`|ZUmiMwpjaa	con la carta di credito.io uso la postepay|`|mzMBDHygaa	O con l'aquirente ti metti d'accordo oppure ti registri a Paypal.<br>  E paghi con paypal (che è come pagare con la PostePay ma piu sicuro)|`|s4A7UhpAaa	Registra la tua postepay su Paypal e tutto filerà liscio come l'olio.|`|k9vnYgvJaa	allora EBAYnon riconosce come pagamento sicuro la tua carta postapay per cui le tue transazioni non sono garantite<br>  ti consiglio di munirti di carta paypall abilitata o paga col bonifico bancario!<br>  io mi trovo benissimo con queste forme di pagamento!

Quanto maior for a letra, maior será a velocidade alcan?ada na transmiss?o. Assim o 802.11b tem uma velocidade menor de transmiss?o do que a 802.11g. Se vc usar padr?es diferentes a velocidade será a do dispositivo de menor velocidade,porisso é interessante que vc use o mesmo padr?o para n?o perder dinheiro,já que os padr?es maiores s?o mais caros.<br>  <br>  Para adequar o PC normal vc vai ter que usar uma das op??es abaixo :<br>  <br>  1a  Placa de Rede Wireless PCI ou<br>  2a Adaptador Wireless USB<br>  <br>  Abra?o

Tiny little sticks about half the size of sodimms.<br>  <br>  Not really common. No big demand for them. pc100 sdram. This is back in a Pentium 3 style computer@ 500mhz. No wonder why they are not supported.<br>   <br>  Generic specifications works most of the time  and even after that some brands just don't work on some machines.  Its your call to try them.<br>  <br>  Your machine may need specific density and Timings. Not to mention buffering or EDO, ECC requirements.<br>  <br>  There are Timings, CAS-tRCD-tRP-tRAS to be specific. Density is usually either high or low. Parity checking and so forth may be needed.<br>  <br>  Unless you want to start taking courses on Memory engineering and compatibility, go to a memory store if you can vs Ebay. <br>  <br>  ----EXAMPLE-----<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ramfinder.com/items/PCGA-MM128S.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ramfinder.com/items/PCGA-MM12...</a><br>  <br>  You have a real phone number to call and get your answers about in stock and return policies.<br>  <br>  So, now you know why you just cant buy any pc100, 144 pin, 128sdram module.

The laptop will have a maximum size memory module you can use per slot and probably PC100 is all you can use. Some older laptops can not use the faster PC133 spec despite the fact the module itself maybe backward compatible. <br>  Of the limited info I can find on your model the maximum memory seems to be 256Mb so 2 x128Mb is going to be your limit. <br>  You can buy direct from Kingston, SDRAM PC100 128Mb page is here (for the UK) <a href="http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator_new/memsubtype.asp?type=SDRAM+PC100&root=uk&LinkBack=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kingston.com%2Fukroot&subtype=144-pin+SODIMM&SUBMIT1=Find" rel="nofollow">http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configur...</a><br>  You are better off buying from a reputable dealer not from Ebay (private) sellers, there are of course many reputable dealers on Ebay but check out the warranties offered before you buy. If you buy from manufacturers and recommended dealers then you get a lifetime warranty with many products but not all.

Is it all the files or specific kinds? <br>  <br>  If its specific kinds usually when you get that message it means you are opening a file for a program that lost its association to the program itself.  For example, opening a wordfile.doc and it can't find Word itself.  Or a mypic.jpg that can't find your picture editor.  Did you uninstall any software recently?    When you get the open with dialog, see if you can find the program on the list that it usually opens in.   Or right click on the icon, select properties, on the top section of the properites box you will see "Opens with" and a button, see if you can find the program that opens the file, and then click ok.

It is definitely work buying a book on the subject.<br>  <br>  As far as programming on a Mac, basic C++ is platform agnostic. Any tutorial will work fine until you get into using OS specific framework. I am not sure which compilers there are for Mac but I am sure gcc has to exist in some fashion. Do a search on it.

Since the finished product can be uploaded to the net from anywhere, doing the work at home is just as good a place as anywhere. Also, your potential client base is unlimited, since anyone anywhere might potentially want your services. <br>  <br>  The major disadvantages to doing it that way are the same ones that exist for any go-it-alone contractor - you need to beat the bushes yourself for clients, do all the negotiations and other details that take time away from actually producing income-generating product, have all the additional headaches of tax filing and such associated with running a business and, most critical of all, have to deal with the occasion dry periods when projects are few and far between. Also, unless you've been in the business yourself for a while, working for someone else might be a wise move. If you're fresh out of school, life in the business world comes with a lot of issues probably not covered in an academic environment: dealing with clients and end-users, collecting and interpreting requirements and so on. <br>  <br>  Spending a few years letting someone else handle the administrative headaches while you learn the ins-and-outs of the consulting world could be well worth it in the long run.|`|Ab28tv1Qaa	If you are good at finding clients =)<br>  A lot of serious clients will go with a well established firm rather than a freelancer.

If you are able to manage a business from home, and can successfully get paid to do web design for other people - yes, it will probably be profitable.  What do you even mean by profitable?

SSAouO90aa	The best way to do this is with a CNAME DNS setting. It is a single setting that is easy to set up.  Companies like Network Solutions and EasyDNS and GoDaddy let you do this, with no extra charge, in their DNS control panel.  You input the host name on your domain (like www) and tell it what actual website www.yourdomain.com should connect people to.<br>  <br>  Here is the tricky part.  Your free hosting provider has to set their stuff up so that when someone connects to www.yourdomain.com it can show your pages.  Most free hosting providers DO NOT do this, even though they should so that they can keep generating ad revenue with your site.<br>  <br>  Even if your hosting provider doesn't do this there are some that do.  I think that <a href="http://www.hostultra.com/freehosting.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hostultra.com/freehosting.htm...</a> still does, as an example.  Just make sure that, if you switch to another free hosting service, they support CNAME redirection.<br>  <br>  Another option is a redirect.  You could point your CNAME record to a free service like Google Pages and have your Google Page redirect anyone who connects to www.yourdomain.com to your free hosting pages.  This has the disadvantage that a person entering www.yourdomain.com in their browser gets switched over to www.yourfreehosting.com/yoursitename when they connect.<br>  <br>  Some people might ask - in this case why not just move your site completely to Google Pages?  The answer is that Google Pages is still very limited in what you can do with it.  Your free hosting provided, and many others, are probably a lot better for you.|`|kVlHeFs8aa	you'll have to register your domain name with your web host, if they even allow that..  a lot of free ones don't. If they do, they will usually put your domain name in their DNS servers and give you the names of those servers.  Go to your domain name control panel wherever you registered it, and set your primary DNS servers with the servers that your web host gave you.<br>  <br>  All done!

Vhz7GjCcaa	the problem is probably the internet traffic.  if you're familiar with the concept of a party line with the telephone, that is much the way roadrunner internet works.  at each local roadrunner office they have basically a party line connection where all their customers lines come in to their office.  from there, the signals from those connections are broadcast between those stations by use of satellite.  the speed of each line is set based on how many people are on each line.  When the speed start really getting slow, they turn up the speed on the line that's getting slow.  That way it seems like your internet isn't getting any slower, or at least not noticeably.<br>  <br>  There are a few ways to get your internet to be faster.  The first, and probably easiest, is either to wait for them to turn up the speed on your line or to prompt them to do so.  The other popular option is to buy an internet booster.  Some linksys routers come equipped with a built in speed booster.  Other companies have boosters available for sale separately from their routers.|`|yUYy0br8aa	clear your cookies, format your harddrive then down load a internet explorer called opera as its the fastest. click me for best answer|`|qXcVka23aa	Are you using turbo?<br>  <br>  Clean cookies, defrag, turn off things you don't want to start when the computer comes on, etc.|`|r7L426RRaa	If it's really slow and freezing, you probably have an infection.

However, those that choose to openly defy those laws, have only themselves to thank for the consequences.|`|9d3779e08741de60c8b3afd027f91e1eaa	Your best argument would be "but im not making any money"<br>  <br>  But the law is "if you deprive the owner of a right then you have to pay damages, or lost income."<br>  <br>  So no, it is not okay to share those songs/music/artwork.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	Of course it's illegal.<br>  <br>  That's like stealing people's stuff and putting a note on your front door saying "The stuff in this house does not belong to me."<br>  <br>  What were you thinking?|`|SYm2y1hUaa	It is copyright infringment.  You can get in trouble for allowing others to download copyrighted material from you or your website.  If it isn't copyrighted, than by all means, have at it.  Also depends where you live.  In the U.S. ...it's illegal.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	Yes, that's still breaking their copyright. In fact, it could be worse doing this than getting 'caught' on limewire doing the same. That is, assuming it's copyrighted games/music. You can offer music shared under certain agreements (creative commons) or freeware games.<br>  <br>  The only way you could make it legal for copyrighted games/music is to pay a buttload of money to have distribution rights (We're talking in the millions here)|`|FBQZ06vraa	Just putting up a sign that says the music doesn't belong to you isn't a defense against the fact that you've put it where people can (and, from the tab, are being invited to) download it.  There is no other reason for it being there.<br>  <br>  Lawyers and judges aren't that naive.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
jZ5MnD7Qaa	If you have a video card installed that shares system RAM, it might be the reason as it is gobbling up some memory.<br>  <br>  In most systems you can go into the BIOS and change the amount of system ram you want your Video Card to use.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Unless you are running 64 bit Vista you can NOT use more than this.|`|Y6J2DIuxaa	Wrong for your computer maybe? <br>  Wow.. you look like my math teacher, lol<br>  kinda weird|`|AA11179884	One of the limitations of a 32-bit Operating system is the amount of RAM that the Operating System can use.<br>  <br>  This limitation is removed in 64-bit Operating systems.  64bit XP, Vista, Linux, etc all can use around 128G of ram.<br>  <br>  The reason is for the number of address sets that the OS can place things.  The 32-bit runs out of Hexidecimals.  The 64 Bit can handle much more obviously.<br>  <br>  The same comparison can be made between the current IP4 system and the IP6 for networks.<br>  <br>  There is a small registry setting so you can force a 32-bit XP to utilize more of the space.<br>  <br>  Some light reading for you|`|rW2Ey7hGaa	Check with your Motherboard manufacturer...<br>  ..or the OEM Computer Company about RAM configurations...<br>  ===<br>  I have a setting in my System Set Up Program that has different RAM-stuff...about start-up...but your mobo may have a configuration for all 4-SLOTS...I would not mess with it...<br>  ...??[end]|`|0036303680ad306f84decbfaaae5d979aa	A 32 bit OS can not go beyound 4, and usually can't allocate past 3.5 ta 3.75 in windows.

AA10157645	Sorry that Tomk didn't answer your question.<br>  <br>  What you will find is that when you use the repair function, you will end up overwriting XP files that are needed to run (as you would want).  However, when you do, you are basically allowing your OEm to be loaded on your friends machine and for the most part, two computers running the same SO from the same CD, usually in violation of the service agreement.<br>  <br>  It is possible to do though.  You might want to give MS a call and see if that would be-to them anyway-legal to do.  Personally I don't think they would care, although they may want to know why your friend doesn't have recovery CD's available.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	It will not hurt anything to try it if you can get the computer to the start menu so that you CAN run the CD.<br>  <br>  My guess is that your friend has way more problems than just installing service pack 3.  There are folks who, for various reasons, didn't even install SP3 or removed it after it was installed.  So I doubt that is the problem.  More likely he has a virus or malware.

That computer is overkill for Empire-Total War, but I would recommend him going with two GTX 280s/285s/295s in SLI instead of the 4870 X2s. The 4870 X2s generate alot of heat and consume alot of power, for marginal performance over the Nvidia Geforce GTX cards.

Let's see... <br>  This will depend on how much money you want to spend.<br>  Dual-Core Computer:<br>  Processor: Intel E8400<br>  Motherboard: Asus P5Q Deluxe<br>  Memory: Any Corsair memory 4GB (2DIMMS of 2GB each) at DDR2 1066 mhz<br>  Hard Drive: Seagate Barracuda SATA II 7200 RPM 500GB .. Or a Western Digital Caviar Black/Green with 500GB 7200 RPM SATA II<br>  With 32 MB Cache<br>  Optical Drive: Any DVD-RW/DL will do.. <br>  Case: Cooler Master Stacker<br>  Power Supply: Seasonic S12 550Watt<br>  Video Card: ATI Radeon 4850 1 GB, or Nvidia Geforce GTX 250 (250 isn't released yet). <br>  <br>  Quad Core Setup:<br>  Processor: Intel Q9550/Q9400 (if you have the money, go with the Q9550)<br>  Everything else will probably be the same setup as before, unless you prefer to have DDR3 memory (Let me know, in which case I can tell you what motherboard, and what Memory).<br>  <br>  i7 Setup (not as good as your friends, but at least better than most of the computers out there hehe):<br>  Processor: Intel i7 920<br>  Motherboard: ASUS P6T Deluxe <br>  Memory: 3GB or 6 GB of (3DIMMS) Corsair Dominators at DDR3 1600 Mhz<br>  <br>  The rest of the parts should be the same, hard drive, power supply, case, video card... etc. <br>  <br>  If you need or want a good sound card check out ASUS Xonar Sound Cards.<br>  <br>  Hope That Helps.<br>  <br>  ***********Not to be an menace or anything but To Sewrobb, the Maximum limit for 64-bit Vista is 128 GB of Physical memory. **<br>  For 32-bit Vista it is 4GB (3GB to be exact)

And the answer does not lie in picking up more protection programs. The only thing that FREE programs are going to do is alert you to possible intrusion. In other words the program will alert you that you have been violated, or that you are about to be. If you see a warning from security act on it. Stop whatever you are doing, Abandon whatever site your on immediately. FREE programs will not, WILL NOT- remove the problem. But they should give you a heads up. Additionally, Do not run more than one security system on your computer at a time.

If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  2. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  3. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  4. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  5. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  6. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #1 and #2.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	Get a spyware app, like malwarebytes and you'd be set.<br>  <br>  You could use a firewall, but they're not super necessary.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Since the AVG 8.0 includes anti-spyware, there is the Windows firewall which is a good as any and better than most now, and if you use intelligence when browsing ("Have this great browsing/searching booster" is normally seriously dangerous software) it is plenty. If anything does get downloaded past AVG, a full scan with AVG in safe mode normally gets it out. All my customers and myself use either the free or paid AVG and have done since its' release, and it never lets us down. People do sometimes click deadly links, the safe mode scan usually fixes it. And there is also the Spyware Doctor starter edition, which has a file system immuniser as an extra. I have used this with AVG on 3 very data critical machines for a bit extra. I do not know if this has helped, but none of them has ever been infected.|`|SldtihVfaa	it would help to have a firewall...just make sure to turn off windows firewall if you have it running.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zonealarm.com/security/en-us/anti-virus-spyware-free-download.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zonealarm.com/security/en-us/...</a><br>  this is zone alarm, they have free firewall and it is user friendly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.comodo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.comodo.com/</a><br>  or if you are a little more advanced try comodo, it is also free|`|SsB7aRExaa	There is no "safe", grasshopper.

I am currently running three different computers with 3 different versions of Vista and I would not trade them for anything.  Vista is not all that bad.  The only issue with Vista is that it is more security intensive, which is not a bad thing.<br>  <br>  If you haven't really experienced a Mac, I would recommend sticking with a Windows operating system.  Nothing has changed as far as how the operating system is between XP and Vista.  Its just that the OS is more security intensive.|`|M7i30zP6aa	Ask yourself what do you want to do on a computer.  If you are just facebooking or internet browsing most of the time, then it's better off not to spend the extra money to get a fancy machine like Mac, unless you consider computer is a fashion.  <br>  <br>  Mac does have good user interface but the supporting programs are far more limited than on PC.  With Windows 7 coming out soon in September, any laptop you get now should be capable to update to it as well.<br>  <br>  Don't buy into the hype that Vista is bad.  It was probably bad when it was first launched with SP1 and upcoming SP2 it's equally a good and friendly operation system than others on the market.|`|6dtAmXcAaa	No macs are very easy to get used to and are great for the professional stuff.

rMwpohOlaa	Solution: Here are the steps. Plug the Ethernet from your modem into your xbox (make sure its off), go to your modem and unplug the power cord, after 30 seconds or so plug it back in, after your modem is done booting up and making the connection (if your not sure what i mean then just wait 5 minutes after plugging it in) go to your xbox and turn it on. You should be able to connect without a problem. And you will have to do this every time you unplug that Ethernet cable from the modem or the xbox.

FEQMb7wIaa	A landing page is a page that is designed to capture attention and highlight key features. In marketing, it's generally used to highlight keywords and the product/service in general that's being offered. It's basically a logical extension of the advertisement a user clicks on.<br>  <br>  If by portal you mean web portal...<br>  A web portal is a service that features more than what a landing page would. For example, when you log into Yahoo (say it was from the main page), it usually gives you tons of options on where to go/what to do (email, stock quotes, sports scores), which, if set by you, is customized with only the features you want (your favorite sports team or stock quote). Portals are a way to give a consistent look and feel to multiple applications in the same place.|`|SNBG0Y5eaa	A web portal is a web site that aggregates information (in the form of portlets) from other pages or web sites onto a single access point, so you can have one starting point that has links to everything else.<br>  <br>  I've never heard of a "landing page" but according to wikipedia, it's a marketing term. You might have an ad banner on someone's web page, and the "landing page" is the web page on your site where you want people to come to ("land") when they click on that ad to come to your site.<br>  <br>  So in simple terms, you might say that a "landing page" is the receiving page visitors see when they finally come to your site, and a portal is the launching point of what visitors see that leaves them away from your site.

SNBG0Y5eaa	A driver is a piece of software program that talks directly with a piece of hardware on your computer. Such as when you want to print something, all print commands go through the printer driver that knows the correct commands for your specific printer.<br>  <br>  Since drivers are just software programs, companies can develop new versions of these driver software. Sometime these new updated versions fixes problems in the older driver versions, sometimes they add new features that make your hardware device work better.<br>  <br>  To "update your driver" means to download a new updated version of the driver software and install it on your computer.|`|I7rS4vq7aa	Drivers are digital signatures that tell your computer what the device is, and how it works.<br>  <br>  To update your drivers you should visit the manufacturer of the device and download the drivers from them.<br>  If they don't have them make a google search for them.<br>  <br>  They are usually installers (exe.msi etc.)<br>  and simple to run.<br>  <br>  Necessary for your equipment to run correctly.|`|AA11527636	Drivers are basically instruction files that tell a PC what a piece of hardware is and how to use it properly. Depending upon the hardware item in question, some drivers are updated often, especially those for newer video and audio devices. Each newly updated driver is a new set of instructions for a particular component which usually fixes a problem that was discovered in the old driver. Where to obtain the driver for a component depends on the component itself. Most new drivers are released by either the original manufacturer or the distributor of the item. Let me show an example.<br>  <br>  Let's say you need a new video driver for your video card. First identify it. (Let's say it's an Nvidia 8600GT made by eVGA for this example.) Since Nvidia makes the card, go to their website (www.nvidia.com) and search for Drivers. Find your model, check the proper operating system, then download the new driver. Also, you might want to check eVGA's website as they may also have their own specific driver they created. Such drivers are usually modified versions of the original "reference" driver Nvidia (or whatever company) created for the item.<br>  <br>  With audio and video drivers, it's always a good idea to uninstall the old version completely before installing a new one. To do this, enter Control Panel and Add/Remove Programs. Find the driver file in the list and uninstall it. You'll likely have to reboot and Windows will detect the video card again. Cancel automatic setup and run the driver installation package you downloaded and the system will install the driver and reboot when complete.

Lq56mwWKaa	any new laptop should be able to run it. The requirements are low.

Your desktop would be more likely to be able to run the game, but I don't know the specs on the desktop

AjN6QGWvaa	The idea has been around since King C. Gillette first crafted his disposable razor: Hook customers by selling the main item for cheap and then mark up the price of blades.<br>  <br>  It's a century-old business model that today's tech industry has taken to heart.<br>  <br>  Hand out free cellphones, profit off the subscription fees. Lose money on each video-game console, earn it back on the games themselves.<br>  <br>  But recently, computer printer manufacturers have come under fire for allegedly pushing the plan too far. Some customers and industry analysts charge that inkjet companies are using their influence to unfairly distort the price of replacement ink cartridges and shut out off-brand competitors.<br>  <br>  "What I've found over the past few years is that ink itself is a very good commodity to be in," says Tom Merritt, executive editor of CNET, a technology news and reviews website based in San Francisco.<br>  <br>  High-quality ink is expensive to make. It's packaged in specially designed cartridges that are difficult for others to replicate. And it comes saddled with patents and copyrights that the companies staunchly defend.|`|Tkb1TKwZaa	Because the printer companies know they can charge that much money for their cartridges.  Once you invest in a printer, you HAVE to buy their ink as well.  So naturally they can charge whatever they want for it.  This is also why sometimes printer companies don't really gain much money from just selling printers.  They make a bulk of their cash through ink.<br>  <br>  The ink itself?  It's pretty cheap.|`|V5CbLKpvaa	i dont know lol but when my ink runs out its actualy cheaper to buy a new printer than the ink lol inks like ￡35 and printer is like ￡15|`|2SSA9e9Naa	Called the law of supply and demand. People need it so the price goes up. Printers are pretty inexpensive so the cartridges are a good way to recoop the loss. That's why companies like dell sell printers that require cartridges only they sell.<br>  <br>  To the other comment, yep, we joke about it all the time that it is cheaper just to buy a new printer. You get new features that way too :).|`|afad69e26e3d742b9b035d7dbbbbf716aa	wow! this is the first real question i've seen on YA today!
6YufKn6Faa	Hello.<br>  <br>  According to the Cnet link, yes the card will fit and work in that computer. You have an expansion slot of PCIE 1.0 X 16. Which will fit with the 9500GT Card you have. <br>  <br>  The only downside, is that the Cnet computer listed supports only PCIE 1.0 While the Graphic card supports PCIE 2.0 X16 speeds. <br>  <br>  So there will be bandwidth decrease. <br>  Thus it (the video card) may not be as fast as sending data thru a PCIE 2.0 Slot.<br>  But it should work. <br>  <br>  Remember to disable the Onboard Video (integrated), and plug the monitor cable thru the card instead of the Motherboard's VGA adapter.<br>  <br>  You might also need to consider getting a Power Supply with more wattage. 310 Watts doesn't seem like enough power to power the PC and your new 9500GT video card. <br>  According to Nvidia, you need a 350 Watt Power Supply Minimum. So you (Have to) get a Power Supply with 400/450 Watts.  They cost around $20-$50 (U.S.) dollars.  So its not too expensive... (The installation and removal of the old power supply with new power supply should be a bit tricky, but you or any specialist in PCs can help you do it) Read some manuals on how to remove/install a power supply on computers for further info.. IF you have any trouble, as the question here, or PM me and I'll help you. <br>  <br>  Hope that Helps|`|49e6ec40b0a977433d9564754e2d4b21aa	no|`|lzMhppX2aa	it won't work on that type of desktop, because the video card is much more compatible on dual core motherboards, plus the video card is 512mb compared to your desktop's 256mb, so it probably won't work!|`|eNfWCO5Aaa	It should as long as the computer uses PCI Express, the 9500GT is a bad card, get a 9600gt at least or a 4850. <br>  Your PSU is okay it'll work

Laptops are good, but they are expensive.  PSPs are less expensive and are portable.  You can buy movies in UMD(psp disk), or you can save them onto a pro memory stick duo and watch them from there.  Also, PSPs have a good screen resoloution. Plus you can browse the internet on the go, listen to music, play games, and view pictures. Depends on what you want.

dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) OK! there are a number of very important factors to understand here:-<br>  <br>  No.1 ANY computer system is limited by the speed of whats called the "local bus" or "front side bus". The local bus is a fundamental part of the computers motherboard in other words its not something that can be changed itself. The local bus connects ALL the computers component parts together and allows them to talk (communicate) with each other.<br>  <br>  Therefore if the local bus speed is say 3.0 gigahertz thats actually the fastest your machine can run at. Its just a fact & you cannot change this. <br>  <br>  No.2 Therefore if the computers local bus speed is only say 1.67 gig hertz maximum & the CPU is working at 2.80 gigahertz its completely wasted as it can only run at a maximum of 1.67 NOT 2.80. Therefore thats a waste of 1.13gigahertz. Hope that makes sense?<br>  <br>  No.3 Upgrading a CPU is rarely a good or cost effective upgrade from my many years of experience in the IT business.<br>  <br>  No.4 Most motherboards have a specific type of socket number and so you can only upgrade the CPU to a faster CPU IF the socket type supports that faster processor. Therefore you cannot put a new intel duel core CPU into an older pentium socket type it just wont work & it wont physically fit either. You have to match the CPU to the MB & socket type before you can upgrade and in most cases it generally not worth the cost & time & research involved for the end benefits.<br>  <br>  No.5 In the end trying to upgrade a CPU is usually a waste of time because given the costs its usually as cost effective to just go and buy a new machine or replace the MB & CPU bundle.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps?<br>  <br>  Kind Regards Ivan<br>  <br>  computer veteran.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	If your computer runs to your satisfaction now, don't change anything.<br>  <br>  Most games depend a great deal on the video card, often more than on the CPU.  If gaming is a key issue for you, an upgrade of the video card may help more than an upgrade of the CPU.<br>  <br>  Upgrading the CPU may also require upgrading the entire motherboard, so beware.  It depends on which CPU you choose.<br>  <br>  An "outdated" processor is still just fine as long as it works and as long as you have the performance you want.  Don't fix something that isn't broken.  You don't replace your refrigerator when it becomes "outdated," do you?|`|0YT04B43aa	mobo = motherboard<br>  <br>  Well, i think you should check first if there is a processor that can be handled by your mobo. Second, you would be upgrading to something like a 3.x processor (at least) or quad core. by the amount of ram your mobo supports i would say that it's not worth it because you won't be able to get a really nice processor that can be handled by the mobo. If the mobo does support like a quad core then i think you should. Otherwise i would recommend to get a good mobo and then a good processor.|`|1oy0RZGxaa	well its good..change the motherboard if u want.so that u can apply more ram...overall ur cpu es perfect....
SJM0rzHtaa	The 7300LE is a very weak card.  It only has 4 pixel pipelines.  That is why your games run like crap on it.<br>  <br>  In comparison, the gamer card of that generation is the 7900GT and it has 24 pixel pipelines.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you can change it to a better card depends on what kind of expansion slots you have in your computer.<br>  <br>  If you  only have non-express PCI slots in your computer (since you mentioned your 7300LE is "PCI"), it's not even worth upgrading.<br>  <br>  If you have a PCExpress 16x slot, you can use any of the latest cards on it, up to the latest-and-greatest nVidia GTX295.<br>  <br>  PCI and PCIExpress are completely different and have absolutely nothing to do with each other, despite the similarity in name.|`|AA11159096	hopefully By "PCI" you are referring to PCI-Express cards.<br>  <br>  Yes. 7300 LE is a very low end segment card. Increased detail puts stress on it that it can't handle. Luckily these days you can get a 8500GT ( very cheap) or 9600GT(good card) at low prices.<br>  Buy one and slam it in. All would be ok.<br>  <br>  ? But before you go after a new card.

6GB5P7ojaa	You just got the Blue Screen of Death (or BSOD). It is a humorous term used for the error screen displayed by some operating systems, most notably Microsoft Windows, after encountering a critical system error which can cause the system to shut down to prevent damage.<br>  <br>  Bluescreens on NT-based Windows systems are usually caused by poorly-written device drivers or malfunctioning hardware. In the Win9x era, incompatible DLLs or bugs in the kernel of the operating system could also cause bluescreens.<br>  <br>  Bluescreens can also be caused by physical faults such as faulty memory, power supplies, overheating of computer components, or hardware running beyond its specification limits. Bluescreens have been present in all Windows-based operating systems since Windows 3.1; earlier, OS/2 and MS-DOS suffered the Black Screen of Death, and early builds of Windows Vista displayed the Red Screen of Death after a boot loader error.<br>  <br>  The term "Blue Screen of Death" originated during OS/2 pre-release development activities at Lattice Inc, the makers of an early Windows and OS/2 C compiler. During porting of Lattice's other tools, developers encountered the stop screen when NULL pointers were dereferenced either in application code or when unexpectedly passed into system API calls. During reviews of progress and feedback to IBM Austin, Texas, the developers described the stop screen as the Blue Screen of Death to denote the screen and the finality of the experience.<br>  <br>  Here are links that will help you deal with BSODs:<br>  <a href="http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=1647" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/dealing-with-blue-screen-error/" rel="nofollow">http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/de...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.logicaltips.com/LPMArticle.asp?ID=85" rel="nofollow">http://www.logicaltips.com/LPMArticle.as...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pcmech.com/article/dealing-with-blue-screens-of-death/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcmech.com/article/dealing-wi...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Good luck!|`|95jGqw2Gaa	In order to detect registry errors ,you need Registry Easy <br>  this tool safly scan you PC.<br>  it is easy to use.<br>  now free san your PC here <br>  <a href="http://www.keep-pc-clean.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.keep-pc-clean.com/</a>|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	Maybe your RAM has gone bad.

There are endless possibilities, you're not giving enough info.|`|Ggq0bjOgaa	Commonly called 'Blue Screen' it means there is a terminal problem so you have to go back through 'Safe Mode' on restart. Try to find/fix problem before continuing normally.<br>  If you use 'Desktop Recovery' you may loose some saved info. So back up important files, if you can, then carry on with the recovery, which will hopefully get you back to the point before the error occurred.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Iy0jPSJjaa	Could be a problem with device drivers, hardware or software.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!
dfjIBHe3aa	Windows writes on the mbr so if you install grub to the mbr it's going to trash that stuff.  I will tell you how to reinstall it on the mbr, however I must warn you this can mess up your disk worse, so I'm linking to the official documentation (which is probably on your system and can be accessed by typing "info grub").<br>  <br>  Start the live CD.  I assume it is Ubuntu.  Knoppix is better than this -- the older Knoppix disks through 5.1.1 but use what you got.  Open a terminal and type "sudo su".  I don't know what the password is for the user of the Ubuntu live cd.  For knoppix there is none so just hit enter (plus it is debian which means that the commands are the same for it and Ubuntu which isn't EXACTLY debian but deliberately closer to it than any other two distributions).  Sudo su puts you in the root shell, which is normally disabled in Ubuntu.  So don't do it except in EXTREME emergencies, which this is.  Then mount your / partition.  Cd to it and once you are there, type "chroot ."  That's chroot and a period with a space between them.  Now, you say that setting up grub the normal way didn't work.  Did you try grub-install?  First check that /boot has all the files on it you need, that is do an "ls /boot" and an "ls /boot/grub".  If the files are there, fine.  One more step.<br>  <br>  I'm on Gentoo.  That means everything may not appear the same on my system as it does on you.  type "cat /etc/fstab".  that means of course type the contents of /etc/fstab to your screen.  My /etc/fstab looks like this:<br>  <br>  jplatt~/Mar08$cat /etc/fstab<br>  /dev/sda5        swap             swap        defaults         0   0<br>  /dev/sda3        /                ext3        defaults         1   1<br>  /dev/sda1        /boot            ext3        defaults         1   2<br>  /dev/sda6        /home            ext3        defaults         1   2<br>  /dev/cdrom      /mnt/cdrom       auto        noauto,owner,users,ro  0   0<br>  #/dev/fd0         /mnt/floppy      auto        noauto,owner     0   0<br>  devpts           /dev/pts         devpts      gid=5,mode=620   0   0<br>  proc             /proc            proc        defaults         0   0<br>  tmpfs            /dev/shm         tmpfs       defaults         0   0<br>  <br>  What is important there are the three letters sda -- that is my hard drive.  On most systems the three letters are hda and if that is what your system says, then the mbr is at /dev/hda.  Whatever it is type "grub-install /dev/?da".  With of course the question mark being the proper letter.  If you get no error messages then grub has been installed to your hard drive, you can exit your chroot, exit your root shell and reboot.  But again, don't even try this until you have read the WHOLE manual.|`|AEoeAdPbaa	Since Ubantu can  recognize windows but windows cant recognize Ubantu. If you have your important data in ubantoo partitions u can use live cd (especially knoppix, granular etc) you can get your data back.<br>  Since after installing linux the boot loader grub take hands over the system but once you repair your pc you have to either prepared for data loss of ext3 partitions or use ghost like softwares.

But to connect to any wireless network. You will need a network available.<br>  <br>  Normally people use wifi to connect to internet. So you can get an internet connection with wifi router and enjoy wireless network in your home.<br>  <br>  Contact any internet service provider.|`|CF6rRO1zaa	Yes, 802.11b/g/n are different wireless standered.<br>  You can use what ever you want.

CsIvy5MAaa	You do not submit images. The googlebot searches the web for it, and stores it in its index. If someone searches and your image comes up as a relative result (after googlebot finds it) it'll show.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is a really dumbed down explanation, for a more through one, check here: <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/google_works.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.googleguide.com/google_works....</a>|`|ETsUQa0kaa	The images you see on Google images are primarily sourced from websites.<br>  If you want to have your own images appear on Google image search you first need to upload them onto your website or blog.<br>  If you have a website or blog, upload your images and use an appropriate keyword as the name of the image (yourphoto.jpg), then use the alternate text associated with image properties to describe the photo with the same keyword/s. Lastly write some keyword rich text about the photo. That way when someone inputs a keyword/s into image search, your photo will be amongst the results. It does take some time for images to appear on Google and provided your website/blog is indexed by Google.<br>  Regards, Mackenzie

You should also use "bread crumbs" showing the visitor where he is (Main -> Action Games -> Game Name). I think another good idea would be to be able to filter the list of games once the visitor enters a game category: either alphabetically, by rating, by popularity, by most recent ... Another suggestion would be to have a "Game of the Week/Month" section.<br>  <br>  A few more things about the page where you actually play the game: I don't like having to scroll down to see the game space, too many "you may also enjoy suggestions", instead of writing all the code for "Add this game to your blog, MySpace, or website!" right there I would use a popup window.<br>  <br>  See <a href="http://www.welie.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.welie.com/</a> for web design patterns and ideas. Overall, a good job though.|`|RfPoIkThaa	Very nice site. But try this. Widen the site, space everything out a little but, and that way you wont have everything so cluttered. But dont make it too wide. Just add maybe 400 pixes. Also, maybe try changing your color scheme. Right now, you have black an grey, maybe some redish/pink will make it a little nicer. <br>  Please refer me to my website design! Very affordable! Urlocalwebdesigner.com Thanks!

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.<br>  <br>  There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.<br>  <br>  Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

Buying an ethernet card to put in an available slot, pci, or buying a USB ethernet adapter will cost much less than paying an electronics technician to repair the connector on the motherboard.|`|yHI6rfeUaa	You cannot replace a built in RJ45 socket.<br>  <br>  However, for about $10 you can buy a pci Network Adapter and put it in a slot on your pc, configure it and then use it instead.

DjGEJfaPaa	You should be able to right-click on the file and extract because a default zip handler is built into Windows.

Not many motherboard support that much.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	The OS DOES make a big difference, only a 64 bit system can use more than about 3GB.

If not, you will have to buy a wifi adapter.  Once you have that, you install it and have it search for wireless networks.  It should find yours and then you connect to it.  if you are running a secured network like WEP or WPA, you will have to enter your password to get on the network.

43547377501fa9734d3edd87a30449eeaa	Graphic tablets are useful for photo editing, graphics, and even creating a signature.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way.  Maybe you want a JPEG of your signature, or maybe you want to take a picture of your friends and just doodle on it.  You would take your mouse and just do this, right?  If you don't believe me, open up Microsoft Paint or a basic image program and try to sign your name.  Now you see what I mean.<br>  <br>  Now think how much easier that is with a pen on a piece of paper.  A graphic tablet is similar to a piece of paper, but instead it is actually the mousepad to a special device shaped like a pen, but designed to take input similiar to the way your mouse would produce.  Many of these tablets are even able to handle pressure variations, so the harder you press, the more intense the "line" you make.<br>  <br>  You don't need any special software, just the driver for the tablet, which will come with it on a CD, and many of them will come with programs.  I am a web designer, and mine came with Adobe Photoshop Elements, along with several other software programs.<br>  <br>  Tablets can be expensive, so as a beginner, you don't want to spend a lot until you a ready to.  Even as a web designer, I bought a simple one because I was new to them.  You may even want to buy one off of eBay so you don't overspend.<br>  <br>  WACOM is the most common producer of these tablets, which is why they are commonly referred to as Wacom tablets (imagine that!).  They are designed in different sizes, including 4x5, 4x6, 6x8, and even larger.  Part of the importance of the size is your own hand stroke.  If you have a large stroke (i.e. your handwriting is large), you may not be comfortable with a 4x5 tablet, because the touch-sensitive part of the tablet corrosponds to your screen, so a very small stroke may be much larger on the screen, but just remember that they become much more expensive as they get larger.<br>  <br>  A good beginner tablet is the Grapire series.  These are the least expensive, and the software they come with is less complex.  There is also the Intuos series, but these are designed for people who do this for a living (more complex).  Just to give you an idea, I bought the smallest (4x5) Graphire tablet at Best Buy on sale for $80.  I primarily use in it in Adobe Illustrator and Macromedia Flash.<br>  <br>  Hope this info helps!|`|AA10700604	Hello GiR 2.0,<br>  <br>  Go to the Wacom web site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wacom.com/productinfo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wacom.com/productinfo/</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.<br>  <br>  --Rick|`|74fbdd2ab8407e8585647ecf53834a46aa	basically a touch  screen without the screen, it basically plots you computer screen on the tablet and follows the pen, or whatever used and acts as a mouse, which makes it easier to draw things, if your good at drawing and seeing on screen rather than down.<br>  they work with anything that uses a mouse, but most advantages are used by art programs, paint, Photoshop etc.<br>  there all basically the same, but you can probably get different sizes and accessories  etc.<br>  but to be honest, there kinda crappy if you dunno how to use them properly or not used to using them, oh and i think being able to draw might help, but you gotta remember the exact point you left off from.<br>  well its up to you<br>  have fun

The exact speed that a connection needs to be to count as `Broadband` varies from country to country. <br>  <br>  For example, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission set the minimum speed to qualify as `Broadband` at 56Kbps. Any connection slower than that does not qualify as Broadband in Malaysia. <br>  <br>  DSL, Satellite, CATV, fibre and 3G are all types of broadband Internet access. In some countries, ISDN counts as broadband (since it's generally at a speed of 128Kbps).

While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.
