Such as people with autism might do.      I just rock ever so slightly, but it isn't on purpose.  I just find that i am doing it every now and then.  I thought only our heart and things were involuntary muscles?      Could it be to do with posture, like a tower that might sway a little if it wasn't structurally strong enough?      Are my muscles too weak to hold me upright perhaps?  are they perhaps taking it in turns causing one set to relax while another set of muscles holds me upright [while sitting].

20090203131152AAfNrtb	Science & Mathematics;Geography	What is another way to say this ?	Globalization was inevitable and is desirable for all. It facilitates the building and the sharing of wealth. Through trickle –down economics, even the world’s poorest benefits from it. Globalization forces inefficient business operation to become more efficient and more competitive. Every region has its own resources and strength, and Globalization maximizes the development of each area’s resources and allow others to benefits from their strengths. Globalization moves the world in the direction of economic convergence, poorer countries catching up with richer countries. Globalization encourages countries to adopt a policy to fiscal responsibility, which benefit everyone within those countries.
