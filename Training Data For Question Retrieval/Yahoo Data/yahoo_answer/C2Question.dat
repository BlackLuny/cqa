Bill "for a lifetime of all kinds of experiences"      Here's the video:    http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/...       After the oath, Clinton joked, "As Joe laughingly referenced, neither one of us thought that we would be standing here together, doing what we are now doing together. Life has a funny way of unfolding. And politics is even stranger."       But the crowd roared even louder with laughter after the new Secretary thanked her husband and cracked a joke that made the former president turn beet red.      "I am so grateful to him for a lifetime of all kinds of experiences," Secretary Clinton said as the crowd erupted with laughter and applause, "which have given me an extraordinary richness that I am absolutely beholden to and grateful for"      Was she joking about what we were all thinking? lol

20090202194248AADvc0W	Politics & Government;Military	AAFES Lost Prevention ?	I work at AAFES and have been for quite awhile now. I had a customer awhile back buy something that was supposed to be $5.99 but it rang up in the computer as $2.39. The customer was irate when I told them that this must be the wrong price and went back to confirm with a manager the real price which in the computer stated that it was $2.39. I went ahead with the sale and it was done. After a couple of weeks another customer bought the same item and it was still $2.39 in the computer so I went ahead and sold it to the customer thinking that it was a liquidation item. That night before I got off of work I went and bought the item for $2.39 in front of the manager and was told that it wasn't the right price and it was going to be changed the next day. A few weeks passed and someone new bought the same product and guess what? It was still $2.39, thinking the manager found out that it was the right price I went and bought it again at $2.39 and put it in the employee break room. After about an hour the same manager as from before came to me and yelled at me that I didn't tell her that it was still coming up the wrong price, that was that and she let me go home without saying another word. Next day I get a call from the security manager asking me to come in. He sat there and explained that I was stealing from AAFES for buying a product that was in the computer at $2.39 and just because they messed up I should pay the difference or be sent to jail and fired. Needless to say I paid the $3.60 and that was that. Should I feel like I stole something or is it the manager's fault or the person who prices the items? I am having my integrity question for buying something at price and having a receipt to prove it. Do you think that the store is going to press and more charges? Should I find a lawyer and get my money back because I bought it for the price it rang up as.

America went from a poorly equipped Army to creating superior weapons which helped defeat the Germans and Japanese in a matter of a few years.      What is the obsession with spending billions a year on military technology? The Raptor has been in development for 23 YEARS. Most of these military projects are corporate welfare; until combat is actually fought, most weapons manufacturers don't actually really know what to build or design. Case in point is Iraq. Look at Israel, their weapons are designed for the type of warfare they know they'll be engaging in.      Rumor has it manned fighters are very close to being outdated. Unmanned is the future, and can defeat any human pilot in terms of maneuverability.       Why hasn't the Army been able to replace the M-16 after all these years? They can buy G36's from the Germans, even license it. It's one of the most perfect weapons ever made. Nooooo...they turn it into another pork project...most likely trying to figure out how to cheap out on the design...guess what, it failed too.      Republicans will never get it. They're the victims of one pyramid scheme after the next. Keep supporting this nonsense.

20090202113001AAQnhOP	Politics & Government;Politics	Should abortion be used to prevent global warming?	Apparently, this idiot believes so...and you should not have more than 2 kids, if you do, you are irresponsible.       Question: What do you make of these comments? Is the left, attempting to make us into a China?      COUPLES who have more than two children are being “irresponsible” by creating an unbearable burden on the environment, the government’s green adviser has warned.       Jonathon Porritt, who chairs the government’s Sustainable Development Commission, says curbing population growth through contraception and abortion must be at the heart of policies to fight global warming. He says political leaders and green campaigners should stop dodging the issue of environmental harm caused by an expanding population.       A report by the commission, to be published next month, will say that governments must reduce population growth through better family planning.       “I am unapologetic about asking people to connect up their own responsibility for their total environmental footprint and how they decide to procreate and how many children they think are appropriate,” Porritt said.       “I think we will work our way towards a position that says that having more than two children is irresponsible. It is the ghost at the table. We have all these big issues that everybody is looking at and then you don’t really hear anyone say the “p” word.”       The Optimum Population Trust, a campaign group of which Porritt is a patron, says each baby born in Britain will, during his or her lifetime, burn carbon roughly equivalent to 2? acres of old-growth oak woodland - an area the size of Trafalgar Square.       The British population, now 61m, will pass 70m by 2028, the Office for National Statistics says. The fertility rate for women born outside Britain is estimated to be 2.5, compared with 1.7 for those born here. The global population of 6.7 billion is expected to rise to 9.2 billion by 2050.       Porritt, who has two children, intends to persuade environmental pressure groups to make population a focus of campaigning.       “Many organisations think it is not part of their business. My mission with the Friends of the Earth and the Greenpeaces of this world is to say: ‘You are betraying the interests of your members by refusing to address population issues and you are doing it for the wrong reasons because you think it is too controversial,” he said.       Porritt, a former chairman of the Green party, says the government must improve family planning, even if it means shifting money from curing illness to increasing contraception and abortion.       He said: “We still have one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancies in Europe and we still have relatively high levels of pregnancies going to birth, often among women who are not convinced they want to become mothers.

These 13 nations received over $2.7 billion in U.S. arms transfers under the Foreign Military Sales and Commercial Sales programs in 2003, with the top recipients including Saudi Arabia ($1.1 billion), Egypt ($1.0 billion), Kuwait ($153 million), the United Arab Emirates ($110 million) and Uzbekistan ($33 million).      The largest U.S. military aid program, Foreign Military Financing (FMF), increased by 68% between 2001 and 2003, from $3.5 billion to nearly $6 billion. ... Military aid totals have leveled off slightly since their FY 2003 peak, coming in at a requested $4.5 billion for 2006. This is still a full $1 billion more than 2001 levels. The number of countries receiving FMF assistance nearly doubled from FY 2001 to FY 2006-- from 48 to 71" ( http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms...  ).

A photo of Phelps smoking marijuana out of a bong at a party in November has brought his endorsement career to a crossroads, marketing experts say. And the megabucks that were flowing in could soon go down the drain unless America's superstar swimmer, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games, changes his ways.      "It's certainly not good and it’s a disaster in terms of the near future," said Robert Tuchman, president of Premiere Corporate Events, a sports entertainment firm. "He's very unlikely to have new sponsors come on board and endorse him. And there's the potential for other sponsors to pull the plug on him, using this is an opportunity. He's going to take a big hit on this."         I think he was busted before for drunk driving.  Typical Republican behavior.

20090202142555AA8ZHDB	Politics & Government;Immigration	Will we ever see true immigration reform?	Maria Mora's husband was returning home from work about two years ago when he noticed a van moving slowly through the parking lot of their apartment complex in south Orlando.      Emblazoned on the vehicle were the letters that strike fear in the hearts of undocumented immigrants: ICE -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement.      The Peruvian man walked discreetly past the van and reached his apartment, where he quickly alerted his wife. They locked themselves in a room with their three U.S.-born children, afraid the agents would bust through their door to take them away.      It turned out to be a false alarm. Still, news of ongoing immigration raids and deportations throughout the state and the nation kept the Moras on high alert. Now, Maria Mora says the election of President Barack Obama has brought a feeling of hope for her family.      "We are very hopeful that he, as the son of an immigrant, will have a heart," said Mora, a finance graduate in her native Peru who is now a stay-at-home mom. Her husband, an engineer by trade, works at a car-upholstery shop. They came to the United States eight years ago on tourist visas that expired.      Undocumented immigrants such as the Moras and their advocates are counting on Obama to deliver on his campaign promises of immigration reform -- a divisive issue for which the last administration could not gain consensus.

In Ontario, if i own a medical practice and am part of a corporation, and another doctor wants to buy the practice. Is it legal to just sell the corporate aspect and not sell practical?        The corporate is just the shares to the building.    The practical would be the documents and patient care.       Or is there a law in Ontario that, if I sell the building, then the documentation must also be included in the deal?  Specifically selling to doctors only.  Because I know if I sell to a business man, then they just want the building.  But selling to another doctor may be a different issue.

He says he hates gay people and frequently makes fun of them and their lifestyle and makes fun of them wanting to get married, supports abortion(pro-choice) but also supports the death penalty, supports gun rights, wants universal healthcare but low taxes, claims he hates Bush but likes Obama.

Latins can compare i guess   But if you compare African American communities to other minority communities, seems like they are still struggling.

Every time I turn on CNN, they're interviewing a Republican who's claiming that Obama's economic stimulus plan "won't work."

This is no time for negative thinking - our economy is at stake. What does CNN hope to accomplish?

The topic came up today after a (good) 15 year old was removed from a home against her will. Both parents appear to be in loving marriages who can provide a good environment.  However, dad makes a good deal more and won custody of her.  The kid was never asked where she wanted to live.  I didn't know where to begin looking for the answer other than calling an attorney directly.

I know you have to record your income on a ledger but how do they know your recording the right amount? Like say your a plumber, and you charge one thousand dollars to install a water heater, but on your ledger you record that you charged seven hundred and fifty, you could do that with every job, record it as twenty five percent less than what you really charged, therefor owe twenty five percent less taxes. How would the IRS catch on to that? (No I'm not planning anything, just curious.)

20090202154843AABra3S	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Does this make me a pedophile?	OK, My brother thinks I am weird because I have this big interest in working around kids. At church there are these 3 boys who have it pretty bad. The 4 year old gets all the attention from the dad, while the others don't. I at the moment, am also having it pretty bad with work and such, so I cant be a 100% active person in their lives. So on Sundays I spend time with them at church when I get the chance. Not just that It might just be a small talk or I might sit there with the 4 year old, while he colors his coloring book.The oldest has it even worst. He is currently in the hospital, recovereing from a nervous breakdown, and still has suicidal thoughts. I have made a promise to my self, that even if it takes years I am gonna stop him from doing anything like that, and I am gonna try to be a part in the lives. I don't care about my life, but only theirs. I know the things I do seem pedophilia, but really that's not what I am trying to do. I would never harm a child like that, I would rather die. So do the things I do make me a pedophile? and is it right for me to step up for these boys, even if its a small part?

20090202143345AArkV86	Politics & Government;Military	Can I transfer my dodmerb from the Army to the Marines?	I'm in Army ROTC, but am also trying to get into PLC with the Corps this summer (to try out both branches, see which one I like more). My question is this: I've already had (and passed) my dodmerb for Army ROTC (had it taken Dec 5, approved on the 15th IIRC), but need similar approval to attend PLC with the Marines in the summer. My problem is that I'm in the middle of a very busy college term, and don't have time to go all the way down to Boston (2.5 hr drive, plus I need to spend the night) for MEPS.      Is there a way I can have my completed dodmerb sent to the Marine Corps as well, and if so, what is this process?      One last note: I've noticed even putting Army and Marines in the same sentence on Yahoo Answers has the unfortunate effect of provoking people from both branches into flaming the other. Don't bother here, I'll make up my mind this summer (if everything goes as intended)

20090202165424AARnZO9	Politics & Government;Military	Why are the British so stubborn when it comes to WW2 history ?	Every time I talk about WW2 online some Brit flips out and keeps telling me that "Britain stood alone" for the entire war, and that they always took the hardest jobs and battles, and that the US did almost nothing.      I would argue that the US did A LOT in WW2 including saving Britain's ***. the only hope they had outside the US was the Soviet Union who would have just as simply invaded Europe after defeating Germany.      So why won't any Brits accept that the US played a major roll in ending the war in Europe? Is it that they can't accept that their old colony has surpassed them as a world power?

20090202133238AAuqGjP	Politics & Government;Immigration	What do U Think  Calif claims state spends well over $5 billion a year on illegal immigrants & their families?	What do U Think  Calif claims state spends well over $5 billion a year on illegal immigrants & their families and this is after paying all their taxes so how is it, illegals are not a drain for the State Of Calif ?   If you figure that the children of illegal immigrants attending K-12 schools approximates the proportion of illegal immigrants in the population, the bill currently comes to roughly $4 billion. Most is state money; some local property taxes.      * Illegal immigrants aren't entitled to welfare, called CalWORKs. But their citizen children are. Roughly 190,000 kids are receiving welfare checks that pass through their parents. The cost: about $500 million, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.      Schwarzenegger has proposed removing these children from the welfare rolls after five years. It's part of a broader proposal to also boot off, after five years, the children of U.S. citizens who aren't meeting federal work requirements. There'd be a combined savings of $522 million.      * The state is spending $775 million on Medi-Cal healthcare for illegal immigrants, according to the legislative analyst. Of that, $642 million goes into direct benefits. Practically all the rest is paid to counties to administer the program. The feds generally match the state dollar-for-dollar on mandatory programs.      So-called emergency services are the biggest state cost: $536 million. Prenatal care is $59 million. Not counted in the overall total is the cost of baby delivery -- $108 million -- because the newborns aren't illegal immigrants.      The state also pays $47 million for programs that Washington does not require: Non-emergency care (breast and cervical cancer treatment), $25 million; long-term nursing home care, $19 million; abortions, $3 million.      Schwarzenegger has proposed requiring illegal immigrants to requalify every month for Medi-Cal benefits, except pregnancy-related emergencies.      There also are other taxpayer costs -- especially through local governments -- but those are the biggies for the state. Add them all up and the state spends well over $5 billion a year on illegal immigrants and their families.       Of course, illegal immigrants do pay state taxes. But no way do they pay enough to replenish what they're drawing in services. Their main revenue contribution would be the sales tax, but they can't afford to be big consumers, and food and prescription drugs are exempt.       http://www.latimes.com/news/columnists/l...

Most people see me as an easy target to walk on. Yet, I stand up for myself when needed and this gets me in trouble, esp. when it comes to dealing with various personality types at work.      I don't understand how I can get through to snobby people who toy with you and your emotions, especially on the job. Nor the bullies. Never could understand how to, in the workforce, deal with them in a diplomatic fashion, where they can just behave.      I'm a rational and direct person. This is what I understand and deal with on the job, and the malicious instigating people use this as ammunition to spew all sorts of lies and gossip (like, she doesn't get a lot does she? She must be autistic. She must have a tantrum when she sees a crack on the street).

Teddy believed that if the United States made a show of force to the rest of the world, other nations might be more hesitant to challenge the American military. Teddy also understood that the threat of force rather than force itself was often sufficient to deter military conflict. The press instantly latched onto this saying and used it to describe Roosevelt’s style of foreign policy as big stick diplomacy, Roosevelt brandished the Big Stick several times during the times as president, most notably in Latin America. Again he was the only president that thought this.   Teddy was the nations 26th president and is considered by many to be our “Conservationist President”. Roosevelt is remembered with a national park that bears his name and honors the memory of this great Conservationist.   Before becoming the president, he was also a Republican candidate of Governor of New York state and a vice president. He was best known as Teddy the Trustbuster. He was also the first president to take action towards dissolving these private owned business, because he felt that the United States Government should be involved, so that it wouldn’t be private and everyone would know what they are doing.   My words were Diplomat, Conservationist, and Trustbuster. Teddy was known for his belief of diplomacy, for his ways as a great conservationist, and the name “Teddy Trustbuster” explains his amazing ways of bringing the government into important things.

What are people going to do when they can't get unemployment insurance? Starve? No one warned them to save because this was going to happen, and they can't save anyway making minimum to slave wages      WASHINGTON — Despite soaring unemployment and the worst economic crisis in decades, 18 states cut their welfare rolls last year, and nationally the number of people receiving cash assistance remained at or near the lowest in more than 40 years.The trends, based on an analysis of new state data collected by The New York Times, raise questions about how well a revamped welfare system with great state discretion is responding to growing hardships. Michigan cut its welfare rolls 13 percent, though it was one of two states whose October unemployment rate topped 9 percent. Rhode Island, the other, had the nation’s largest welfare decline, 17 percent.      Of the 12 states where joblessness grew most rapidly, eight reduced or kept constant the number of people receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the main cash welfare program for families with children. Nationally, for the 12 months ending October 2008, the rolls inched up a fraction of 1 percent.  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/us/02w...

20090202193704AALlhQn	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Civil unrest likely in the uk this summer ?	I believe there is definitely a good chance of civil unrest happening although it will require certain factors to be in place to trigger these events       1) unemployment continuing to rise at the rate it currently is      2) a spate of major injustices relating to immigration in the news similar to the current controversy involving the Italian workers being shipped in to work on the Total oil refinery       3) a warmer summer than we have had for the last few years is an important factor people don’t seem to like going out rioting in the rain       4) some kind of act of police brutality etc would probably be the igniting spark to tip this simmering tension into civil unrest      Considering what we have seen over the last few years in France and more recently in Greece police brutality is often the trigger for civil unrest.       Unemployment is certainly forecast to rise by at the very least another million in 2009 this may possibly result in angry protesting on the streets and at this kind of an event police brutality is always a definite possibility as tempers on both sides run very high.      I’m in no doubt some news story’s involving government sleaze corruption or incompetence will rear there heads in the forthcoming months or possibly more banking scandals with everyday people loosing money etc.      I doubt we are going to see the government sending ship loads of asylum seekers back to there home countries any time soon on the contrary I can easily imagine yet more asylum   Scandals coming to light.      For the weather I cant say! will it be a long hot summer will the country become a tinderbox of social tension ready to burst into violence I don’t know!      One things for sure there are going to be a lot of angry young unemployed people around this summer roaming the streets with nothing to do and no money and that’s always a good prerequisite for trouble!

She is a very strong candidate who can hit hard on the main issues. She was also helpful to garner some of the Hillary votes and that helped to close the gap between McCain and Obama. I also think that 2012 will be a much better year for the GOP because then the GOP states will have more power. I think that North Carolina messed things up for the Democratic Party and California's vote (didn't surprise me) put Obama in the Oval Office. What do you think? Who should be the GOP's next candidate? I think that it will either end up being Governor Sarah Palin (AK) or Bobby Jindal (LA). what do you think the outcome will be based on current trends in the population movements into the GOP states?

This past weekend I went to portland,or and had a hotel reservation at a hotel. I flew up from out of town. When I arrived at the hotel desk on Saturday morning the desk agent refused to check me in. The desk agent handed me over to the manager. The manager on duty asked me some strange questions and was rude. Some of the questions were do you have brain damage?, do you really want to stay here?, where are your parents? After arguing with the rude manager and finally just spit it out and said we don't rent rooms to slow people. I told him I'm not slow and he is horrasing me. He said it's not worth the laibility to rent rooms to mentally unstable people and it's hotel policy.       I know myself that i'm not slow. I graduated college with a BA degree and drive a car.      I'm almost 30 years old and have stayed at many hotels around the country alone. I have never had this problem ever.       While this hotel refused to honor my reservation they charged my credit. Card one nights rent for a no show. After trying to find other hotels in the city many others also refused to rent to me.       I finally ended up at a dumpy motel.

On 1/31, last saturday, I was arrested at my aunts house, at first for resisting arrest and later when i was let out of jail it said for underage drinking.      There was a party at my aunt's house and the cops came and said that there was a noise complaint. told us to turn it down and keep it down. about ten minutes later they showed up again saying every one needed to be out. they wanted to come in and were told clearly that they could not come in unless they had a warrant. which they did not. they still came inside the gate and some of them came into the house and rushed every one out.      I was one of the last to come out because my niece, age 5, was still inside asleep and my aunt and uncle were placed in hand cuffs and in the back of a cop car. when i got outside people were inside our gate but sitting down in lines and some were in cuffs.      the cops got in my face, im guessing for being the last one out, and yelled "sit down or i'll sit you down." and i said "you don't have to sit me down." as in "I'll sit down myself." but he shoved me on the ground and i wasnt expecting to be shoved so i fell on my right knee (and cut it open). Then i guess cause i still want exactly "sitting" they one of them shoved me on the ground on my back and then one of them tazered me, another pepper sprayed me and then i got tazered again and hand cuffed extremely tightly. he felt the cuffs go on and then the officer sqeezed them a few times on purpose. (once i was released i went to the er cause my hands were still numb and the dr told me it was a tendon that was hurt and i have to wear one of those braces for 1-2 weeks and i have to go to the dr again with in a week. my thumb is still numb today 2/2)      At the time I was hand cuffed i repeatedly asked if i was under arrest and no one answered me. then i asked that if i was under arrest for some one to read me my rights and no one did, and i was asked to get up but pepper sprayed and hand cuffed i couldn't get up, so i was dragged out of my aunt's property placed inside the cop car.      i was taken to the hospital as procedure because i was tazered and pepper sprayed but the cuffs didn't come off until i was in a holding cell. there i asked two of the officers there if i could see the nurse about my hand and all they did was bring me and ice pack.      i have to go to court for resisting arrest and underage drinking in march.      Can anyone help me figure out what the best way to go about any of this might me?

20090202135208AA9rnSs	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Time off for medical appointments.  What are my rights as an employee?	Here's my issue.  I work from 7 am - 3:30 pm Mon - Fri.  I am going through some medical procedures that I scheduled outside of my job.  I have to go through physical therapy with a specialized therapist. The latest appointment I could make is 3:30 pm.  So, I asked my boss if I can take my lunch at the end of my shift on this one day a week until my therapy is completed and I was told I couldn't.  I was told that I had to take a half day for the time off.  I then asked if I could make up the half hour one other day during the week and that was shut down.  Now, other people in my job were permitted to do this.  When I asked HR for a copy of the employee handbook that stipulates these rules, I was told there wasn't any.  I honestly feel like they are singling me out by not allowing me to just take the half hour/make it up.  It has nothing to do with my job performance or responsibilities.     My question is, what are my rights as an employee if there is no paperwork stating the "policies" they speak of.  I also know of other employees that this accommodation was made for.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!

I'm thinking about joining the Marines after high school. a few questions- from the very beginning of training, to the end of my required service time (4 years i think?), how long do I serve?    When I grow up i want to do something along the lines of contracting, or some kind of skilled profession that doesn't involve sitting in an office doing paper work, and something that pays well. what kind of skills can I get in the Marines for jobs like that?   Is there a maximum amount of time they are allowed to have me shipped out, or could they have me away from home for 4 years straight?   Could I wait 3/4 months after I graduate from highschool to enlist so I can still enjoy summer break with all my friends?   thanks for your help

When i think of the army and serving my country and seeing the places my father and brother where stationed just makes me want to join even more. Back to my problem in the video it showed them doing lots of push ups and pull ups, I CANT DO PUSH AND PULL UPS. Thats my problem, i was wondering if there was anyway i can talk with my recruiter and maybe he can work with me before i deploy or what i don't know but now with my life i don't have much time to work out so i cant work on those. I was also wondering if in the army they still accept people with GEDs and not high school diplomas and if so do they restrict those people to specific jobs?

20090202194705AAcZaCP	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Book store wouldn't give me a full refund?!! not even a partial refund?	++++ This is little bit long, but please, hear me out, ++++      This one book store wouldnt give me any refund but just buyback..   and they are willing to pay only 1/4 of how much I paid.      I went to this textbook store for my college classes      on last Tuesday 27th.       I realized that we did not really need this book in my class.      I decided to return this book later on.       on the receipt it says about return policy and it says that      last day to return the book and get full refund is Saturday 31st.      I really did not have time because of work   (this might sound excuses but I cant afford college and car without working)      so I decided to go to store on Saturday.      so on friday night,I called them to check the open and close time on saturday for that store      worker exactly told me "opens at 9, and closes at 7 on saturday."      so after I went to church, I went to store and i got there exactly at 5pm.      and the store was closed and it says that on saturday       they close at 3pm!!!!!      I was like what the heck is this??!      I called them today, which is monday, and asked about it       and this workder told me that,       "They just changed the policy, so some of the worker did not know   the new closing time and gave you wrong information"      I was so mad that what kind of worker make mistake on      such a important stuff, which their policy is changed, I just went there for nothing on saturday.      They told me that I can still return it..      Then I went to store today, few hours ago, and      they were doing buy back thing, and they said they could only      give me about 18 dollars, when I bought it for about 70 dollars.      I was so shocked and told that I couldnt return this at right time      because one of your worker made a mistake and it isnt my responsibility.      I wanted to talk to manager, and manager came and she was already      mad about it.      I said "if you guys told me that it closes at 7pm, then i could come here at 6:50pm and still could get a refund. one of your worker told me the wrong time and i went there even before the closing time, but it was already close and now you are telling me that I cant get refund?"      Manager said "Our policy was changed and some workers didn;t know and gave you wrong info, even if you came it was close already,   like I said, it opens at 9, and closes at 3, you even had enought time   to come here way before, we were open monday ~ Friday, it is your fault that you didnt come during week"      Then i said "What I did was just following what the policy said on the receipt, and what your workder said, and I work during week days, also, I can come on saturday if I want to as long as your policy says I can come on saturday, you are not making sense"      and she said she didnt care, and she told me I wasnt the only one,   she was very upset that she had many arguments before me.      she said sorry with such a mad face and I knew she wasnt' sorry   so I said you are not sorry and came out with the book,.      I thought it was better to keep the book than sell it for 18dollars when I   bought it for 70 dollars.      is it just me??? or do you think it was store's responsibility and fault?      I totally followed what their policy said, and they JUST HAPPENED to      change the policy.... unbelievable.      I thought that then they can change the policy whenever they want   and people who bought the book there wont be able to do anything about it.      is there any way that I can get full refund or is there anything i can do?      I just can not believe this situation and I am seriously mad.      As a manager, her action didn't even resemble how a proper manager should do.   They dont do anything when they make mistake and customer gets trouble.      Can anybody help me out here? or give me any advice?      I am sure that They just lost MANY potential customers because of this >:(       I still dont think it is my fault.

Okay so tomorrow I am going to the first intake hearing for custody, my ex filled the papers and I know he has the right to see her but since I was pregnant I gave him and his parents the chance to visit her.

Well anyways I am not going to get into the whole story I just want to know what is the necessary documents to bring?

20090202142649AAZngP6	Politics & Government;Politics	Do I have a question about the Presidency?	Yes!      Sources:   I actually do have a question about the Presidency:      Hi, I am a heterosexual African-American male, and am currently in a stable relationship (23 years of age). I was just pondering about the Presidency of the United States of America. I thought to myself "If a President has to live in the United States for at least 14 years, does this have to be continuous prior to their campaign, or can they live here for 14 years, then move to the UK, then move back and run immediately?"       Although I am African-American, my girlfriend is caucasian, but I don't think that matters.
20090202135856AAtrYAg	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think the world would be like if the US had never seperated from Britan?	Do you think the US would be like Canada is now? Do you think we would have lot more civil liberties like Canada does? State health care? World Wars prevented because of great britan's greater strength (US ended both world wars when we decided to step in, if we were a sovereign nation of GB we would have been in it from the get go) Would Imperialism have prevailed longer? would other countries not have sought their own independence?

20090202113319AAm0Rso	Politics & Government;Politics	Are there other Democrats who think Tom Daschle should remove his name from nomination?	I think his explanation for the failure to report a quarter of a million dollars in income is ludicrous. You don't need to be a CPA to figure out that being given a chauffeured Cadillac to use for 3 years is income.      Second, after leaving the Senate he made big piles of money from insurance companies and health care companies. I didn't like it when Bush took people out of an industry and put them in charge of regulating that industry. And I don't like it now. That's not the change I signed up for.
